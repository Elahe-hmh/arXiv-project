quantum generalization of the classical notion of\nf-divergences, and are a special case of Petz' quasi-entropies. Many well known\ndistinguishability measures of quantum states are given by, or derived from,\nf-divergences; special examples include the quantum relative entropy, the Renyi\nrelative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that\nthe quantum f-divergences are monotonic under the dual of Schwarz maps whenever\nthe defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all\npreviously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the\nmonotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility\ntheorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability\nmeasures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and\nshow that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a\nset of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be\nreversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the\noriginal one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for\noperator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main\ningredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality\nand the case of equality. We also consider some special cases where the\nconvexity of f is sufficient for the monotonicity, and obtain the inverse\nHolder inequality for operators as an application. The presentation is\ncompletely self-contained and requires only standard knowledge of matrix\nanalysis.\n", "  We consider a modified setup for measuring the Aharonov-Casher phase which\nconsists of a Josephson vortex trapped in an annular topological\nsuperconducting junction. The junction encloses both electric charge and\nmagnetic flux. We discover a deviation from the Aharonov-Casher prediction\nwhose origin we identify in an additive universal topological phase that\nremarkably depends only on the parity of the number of vortices enclosed by the\njunction. We show that this phase is $\\pm 2\\pi$ times the topological spin of\nthe Josephson vortex and is proportional to the Chern number. The presence of\nthis phase can be measured through its effect on the junction's voltage\ncharacteristics, thus revealing the topological properties of the Josephson\nvortex and the superconducting state.\n", "  We used a thermal model of an iron core to calculate magnetodynamo evolution\nin Earth-mass rocky planets to determine the sensitivity of dynamo lifetime and\nintensity to planets with different mantle tectonic regimes, surface\ntemperatures, and core properties. The heat flow at the core-mantle boundary\n(CMB) is derived from numerical models of mantle convection with a\nviscous/pseudo-plastic rheology that captures the phenomenology of plate-like\ntectonics. Our thermal evolution models predict a long-lived (~8 Gyr) field for\nEarth and similar dynamo evolution for Earth-mass exoplanets with plate\ntectonics. Both elevated surface temperature and pressure-dependent mantle\nviscosity reduce the CMB heat flow but produce only slightly longer-lived\ndynamos (~8-9.5 Gyr). Single-plate (\"stagnant lid\") planets with relatively low\nCMB heat flow produce long-lived (~10.5 Gyr) dynamos. These weaker dynamos can\ncease for several billions of years and subsequently reactivate due to the\nadditional entropy production associated with inner core growth, a possible\nexplanation for the absence of a magnetic field on present-day Venus. We also\nshow that dynamo operation is sensitive to the initial temperature, size, and\nsolidus of a planet's core. These dependencies would severely challenge any\nattempt to distinguish exoplanets with plate tectonics and stagnant lids based\non the presence or absence of a magnetic field.\n", "  We revisit Villani's approach to the study of hypocoercive diffusion\noperators by applying a variant of the Bakry-\\'Emery machinery. The method\nrelies on a generalized Bakry-\\'Emery type criterion that applies to Kolmogorov\ntype operators. Our approach includes as a special case the kinetic\nFokker-Planck equation and allows, in that case, to recover hypocoercive\nestimates first obtained by Villani.\n", "  The increasing precision in the determination of the Hubble parameter has\nreached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced by\ninhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. Here we use\nlarge-scale cosmological N-body simulations to study statistical properties of\nthe local Hubble parameter as measured by local observers. We show that the\ndistribution of the local Hubble parameter depends not only on the scale of\ninhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in the\ncosmic web and what reference frame is used. Observers located in random dark\nmatter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at random\npositions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect is\nstronger from the halo rest frames compared to the CMB rest frame. We compare\nthe predictions for the local Hubble parameter with observational constraints\nbased on type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and CMB observations. Due to cosmic\nvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the Hubble\nconstant determined from nearby SNIa may differ from that measured from the CMB\nby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. This scatter is too small\nto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between current\nmeasurements assuming a flat LCDM model. However, for observers located in the\ncentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard LCDM model, we find that\nHubble constant measurements from SNIa would be biased high by 5 per cent,\nrendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.\n", "  We propose a construction of a cholesteric pitch axis for an arbitrary\nnematic director field as an eigenvalue problem. Our definition leads to a\nFrenet-Serret description of an orthonormal triad determined by this axis, the\ndirector, and the mutually perpendicular direction. With this tool we are able\nto compare defect structures in cholesterics, biaxial nematics, and smectics.\nThough they all have similar ground state manifolds, the defect structures are\ndifferent and cannot be, in general, translated from one phase to the other.\n", "  Knowledge on nuclear cluster physics has increased considerably as nuclear\nclustering remains one of the most fruitful domains of nuclear physics, facing\nsome of the greatest challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. The\noccurrence of \"exotic\" shapes in light N=Z alpha-like nuclei and the evolution\nof clustering from stability to the drip-lines are being investigated more and\nmore accurately both theoretically and experimentally. Experimental progresses\nin understanding these questions were recently examined and will be further\nrevisited in this introductory talk: clustering aspects are, in particular,\ndiscussed for light exotic nuclei with a large neutron excess such as\nneutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectrocopy.\n", "  We present a non-diagonal phase field model for phase transformations with\nunequal but finite diffusivities in the two phases. This model allows to\nrecover the desired boundary conditions at the interface, and especially the\nelimination of the artificial surface diffusion effect. The model is\nnon-diagonal since it incorporates the kinetic cross coupling between the\nnon-conserved and the conserved fields that was recently introduced [{Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 86}, 060601(R), (2012)}]. We test numerically this model for the\ntwo-dimensional relaxation of a weakly perturbed interface toward its flat\nequilibrium.\n", "  Blazar population models have shown that the inverse-Compton and variability\nDoppler factor estimates yield consistent results at the population level for\nflat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). The two methods, however, are inconsistent\nwhen compared on a source-by-source basis. In this work, we attempt to\nunderstand the source of the discrepancy by tracing the potential sources of\nsystematic and statistical error for the inverse-Compton Doppler factors. By\neliminating these sources of error, we provide stronger constrains on the value\nof the Doppler factor in blazar jets. We re-estimate the inverse-Compton\nDoppler factor for 11 sources that meet certain criteria for their synchrotron\npeak frequency and the availability of Doppler factor estimates in the\nliterature. We compare these estimates with the average of two different\nestimates of the variability Doppler factor obtained using various datasets and\nmethodologies to identify any discrepancies and, in each case, trace their\nsources in the methodology or assumptions adopted. We identify three\nsignificant sources of error for the inverse-Compton Doppler factors: a)\ncontamination of the X-ray flux by non-synchrotron self-Compton emission; b)\nradio observations at frequencies other than the synchrotron turnover\nfrequency; c) non-simultaneity between radio and X-ray observations. We discuss\nkey aspects in the correct application of the inverse-Compton method in light\nof these potential errors. We are able to constrain the Doppler factor of\n3C273, 3C345, 3C454.3, PKS1510-089, and PKS1633+382 effectively, since all\navailable estimates from both methods converge to the same values for these\nfive sources.\n", "  Measurements of cosmological parameters via the distance-redshift relation\nusually rely on models that assume a homogenous universe. It is commonly\npresumed that the large-scale structure evident in our Universe has a\nnegligible impact on the measurement if distances probed in observations are\nsufficiently large (compared to the scale of inhomogeneities) and are averaged\nover different directions on the sky. This presumption does not hold when\nconsidering the effect of the gravitational redshift caused by our local\ngravitational potential, which alters light coming from all distances and\ndirections in the same way. Despite its small magnitude, this local\ngravitational redshift gives rise to noticeable effects in cosmological\ninference using SN Ia data. Assuming conservative prior knowledge of the local\npotential given by sampling a range of gravitational potentials at locations of\nMilky-Way-like galaxies identified in cosmological simulations, we show that\nignoring the gravitational redshift effect in a standard data analysis leads to\nan additional systematic error of ~1 per cent in the determination of density\nparameters and the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that our local\ngravitational field affects our cosmological inference at a level that is\nimportant in future observations aiming to achieve percent-level accuracy.\n", "  We present the general theory for proton nuclei scattering in a bichromatic\nlaser field. As a physical example we consider proton collision on carbon\ntwelve at 49 MeV/amu moderate energies in the field of a titan sapphire laser\nwith its second harmonic.\n", "  The relationship between carrier envelope phase (CEP) slip of cavity soliton\n(CS) and pump phase detuning is derived analytically and numerically. To\npreserve the stability of CS, CEP slip always equals to the pump phase\ndetuning. When CEP slip fails to follow the pump phase detuning, CS becomes\nunstable. The locking between CEP slip and pump phase detuning results in a\nscaling law for CS.\n", "  Transporting ensembles of electrons over long distances without losing their\nspin polarization is an important benchmark for spintronic devices. It requires\nusually to inject and to probe spin polarized electrons in conduction channels\nusing ferromagnetic contacts or optical excitation. Parallel to this\ndevelopment, an important effort has been dedicated to the control of\nnanocircuits at the single electron level. The detection and the coherent\nmanipulation of the spin of a single electron trapped in a quantum dot are now\nwell established. Combined with the recent control of the displacement of\nindividual electrons between two distant quantum dots, these achievements\npermit to envision the realization of spintronic protocols at the single\nelectron level. Here, we demonstrate that spin information carried by one or\ntwo electrons can be transferred between two quantum dots separated by a\ndistance of 4 micrometers with a classical fidelity of 65 %. We show that it is\npresently limited by spin flips occurring during the transfer procedure prior\nto and after the electron displacement. Being able to encode and control\ninformation in the spin degree of freedom of a single electron while being\ntransferred over distances of a few microns on nanosecond timescales paves the\nway towards \"quantum spintronics\" devices where large scale spin-based quantum\ninformation processing could be implemented.\n", "  Recent ARPES measurements [Phys. Rev. B 92, 041113 (2015)] have confirmed the\none-dimensional character of the electronic structure of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, a\nrepresentative of BiS2-based superconductors. In addition, several members of\nthis family present sizable increase in the superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc under application of hydrostatic pressure. Motivated by these\ntwo results, we propose a one-dimensional three-orbital model, whose kinetic\nenergy part, obtained through ab initio calculations, is supplemented by\npair-scattering terms, which are treated at the mean-field level. We solve the\ngap equations self-consistently and then systematically probe which combination\nof pair-scattering terms gives results consistent with experiment, namely, a\nsuperconducting dome with a maximum Tc at the right chemical potential and a\nsizable increase in Tc when the magnitude of the hoppings is increased. For\nthese constraints to be satisfied multi-gap superconductivity is required, in\nagreement with experiments, and one of the hoppings has a dominant influence\nover the increase of Tc with pressure.\n", "  We obtain exact analytical results for the evolution of a 1+1-dimensional\nLuttinger model prepared in a domain wall initial state, i.e., a state with\ndifferent densities on its left and right sides. Such an initial state is\nmodeled as the ground state of a translation invariant Luttinger Hamiltonian\n$H_{\\lambda}$ with short range non-local interaction and different chemical\npotentials to the left and right of the origin. The system evolves for time\n$t>0$ via a Hamiltonian $H_{\\lambda'}$ which differs from $H_{\\lambda}$ by the\nstrength of the interaction. Asymptotically in time, as $t \\to \\infty$, after\ntaking the thermodynamic limit, the system approaches a translation invariant\nsteady state. This final steady state carries a current $I$ and has an\neffective chemical potential difference $\\mu_+ - \\mu_-$ between right- ($+$)\nand left- ($-$) moving fermions obtained from the two-point correlation\nfunction. Both $I$ and $\\mu_+ - \\mu_-$ depend on $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$. Only\nfor the case $\\lambda = \\lambda' = 0$ does $\\mu_+ - \\mu_-$ equal the difference\nin the initial left and right chemical potentials. Nevertheless, the Landauer\nconductance for the final state, $G=I/(\\mu_+ - \\mu_-)$, has a universal value\nequal to the conductance quantum $e^2/h$ for the spinless case.\n", "  We present a calculation of the strange and charm quark contributions to the\nnucleon spin from the anomalous Ward identity (AWI). It is performed with\noverlap valence quarks on 2+1-flavor domain-wall fermion gauge configurations\non a $24^3 \\times 64$ lattice with the light sea mass at $m_{\\pi} = 330$ MeV.\nTo satisfy the AWI, the overlap fermion for the pseudoscalar density and the\noverlap Dirac operator for the topological density, which do not have\nmultiplicative renormalization, are used to normalize the form factor of the\nlocal axial-vector current at finite $q^2$. For the charm quark, we find that\nthe negative pseudoscalar term almost cancels the positive topological term.\nFor the strange quark, the pseudoscalar term is less negative than that of the\ncharm. By imposing the AWI, the strange $g_A(q^2)$ at $q^2 =0$ is obtained by a\nglobal fit of the pseudoscalar and the topological form factors, together with\n$g_A(q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form factor $h_A(q^2)$ at finite $q^2$.\nThe chiral extrapolation to the physical pion mass gives $\\Delta s + \\Delta\n{\\bar{s}} = -0.0403(44)(78)$.\n", "  In this paper we study some properties of the newly found Arnold-Beltrami\nflux-brane solutions to the minimal $D=7$ supergravity. To this end we first\nsingle out the appropriate Free Differential Algebra containing both a gauge\n$3$-form $\\mathbf{B}^{[3]}$ and a gauge $2$-form $\\mathbf{B}^{[2]}$: then we\npresent the complete rheonomic parametrization of all the generalized\ncurvatures. This allows us to identify two-brane configurations with\nArnold-Beltrami fluxes in the transverse space with exact solutions of\nsupergravity and to analyze the Killing spinor equation in their background. We\nfind that there is no preserved supersymmetry if there are no additional\ntranslational Killing vectors. Guided by this principle we explicitly construct\nArnold-Beltrami flux two-branes that preserve $0$, $1/8$ and $1/4$ of the\noriginal supersymmetry. Two-branes without fluxes are instead BPS states and\npreserve $1/2$ supersymmetry. For each two-brane solution we carefully study\nits discrete symmetry that is always given by some appropriate crystallographic\ngroup $\\Gamma$. Such symmetry groups $\\Gamma$ are transmitted to the $D=3$\ngauge theories on the brane world--volume that occur in the gauge/gravity\ncorrespondence. Furthermore we illustrate the intriguing relation between gauge\nfluxes in two-brane solutions and hyperinstantons in $D=4$ topological\nsigma-models.\n", "  We explore the distribution of topological numbers in Calabi-Yau manifolds,\nusing the Kreuzer-Skarke dataset of hypersurfaces in toric varieties as a\ntesting ground. While the Hodge numbers are well-known to exhibit mirror\nsymmetry, patterns in frequencies of combination thereof exhibit striking new\npatterns. We find pseudo-Voigt and Planckian distributions with high confidence\nand exact fit for many substructures. The patterns indicate typicality within\nthe landscape of Calabi-Yau manifolds of various dimension.\n", "  In this paper we analyze some properties of a scalar field configuration,\nwhere it is considered as a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate in a\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter background spacetime. In a natural way, the geometry of\nthe curved spacetime provides an effective trapping potential for the scalar\nfield configuration. This allows us to explore some thermodynamical properties\nof the system. Additionally, the curved geometry of the spacetime also induces\na position dependent self-interaction parameter, which can be interpreted as a\nkind of gravitational Feshbach resonance, that could affect the stability of\nthe cloud and could be used to obtain information about the interactions among\nthe components of the system..\n", "  Previous studies using numerical simulations have demonstrated that the shape\nof the cosmic web can be described by studying the Lagrangian displacement\nfield. We extend these analyses, showing that it is now possible to perform a\nLagrangian description of cosmic structure in the nearby Universe based on\nlarge-scale structure observations. Building upon recent Bayesian large-scale\ninference of initial conditions, we present a cosmographic analysis of the dark\nmatter distribution and its evolution, referred to as the dark matter\nphase-space sheet, in the nearby universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey main galaxy sample. We consider its stretchings and foldings using a\ntetrahedral tessellation of the Lagrangian lattice. The method provides\nextremely accurate estimates of nearby density and velocity fields, even in\nregions of low galaxy density. It also measures the number of matter streams,\nand the deformation and parity reversals of fluid elements, which were\npreviously thought inaccessible using observations. We illustrate the approach\nby showing the phase-space structure of known objects of the nearby Universe\nsuch as the Sloan Great Wall, the Coma cluster and the Bo\\\"otes void. We\ndissect cosmic structures into four distinct components (voids, sheets,\nfilaments, and clusters), using the Lagrangian classifiers DIVA, ORIGAMI, and a\nnew scheme which we introduce and call LICH. Because these classifiers use\ninformation other than the sheer local density, identified structures\nexplicitly carry physical information about their formation history. Accessing\nthe phase-space structure of dark matter in galaxy surveys opens the way for\nnew confrontations of observational data and theoretical models. We have made\nour data products publicly available.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an intermediate type of quantum\nnonlocality which sits between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. A set of\ncorrelations is Bell nonlocal if it does not admit a local hidden variable\n(LHV) model, while it is EPR nonlocal if it does not admit a local hidden\nvariable-local hidden state (LHV-LHS) model. It is interesting to know what\nstates can generate EPR-nonlocal correlations in the simplest nontrivial\nscenario, that is, two projective measurements for each party sharing a\ntwo-qubit state. Here we show that a two-qubit state can generate EPR-nonlocal\nfull correlations (excluding marginal statistics) in this scenario if and only\nif it can generate Bell-nonlocal correlations. If full statistics (including\nmarginal statistics) is taken into account, surprisingly, the same scenario can\nmanifest the simplest one-way steering and the strongest hierarchy between\nsteering and Bell nonlocality. To illustrate these intriguing phenomena in\nsimple setups, several concrete examples are discussed in detail, which\nfacilitates experimental demonstration. In the course of study, we introduce\nthe concept of restricted LHS models and thereby derive a necessary and\nsufficient semidefinite-programming criterion to determine the steerability of\nany bipartite state under given measurements. Analytical criteria are further\nderived in several scenarios of strong theoretical and experimental interest.\n", "  This paper contains some personal reflections on several computational\ncontributions to what is now known as the \"String Theory Landscape\". It\nconsists of two parts. The first part concerns the origin of big numbers, and\nespecially the number $10^{1500}$ that appeared in work on the covariant\nlattice construction (with W. Lerche and D. Luest). This part contains some new\nresults. I correct a huge but inconsequential error, discuss some more accurate\nestimates, and compare with the counting for free fermion constructions. In\nparticular I prove that the latter only provide an exponentially small fraction\nof all even self-dual lattices for large lattice dimensions. The second part of\nthe paper concerns dealing with big numbers, and contains some lessons learned\nfrom various vacuum scanning projects.\n", "  Near-Earth asteroid 2014 AA entered the Earth's atmosphere on 2014 January 2,\nonly 21 hours after being discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey. In this paper\nwe compute the trajectory of 2014 AA by combining the available optical\nastrometry, seven ground-based observations over 69 minutes, and the\nInternational Monitoring system detection of the atmospheric impact infrasonic\nairwaves in a least-squares orbit estimation filter. The combination of these\ntwo sources of observations results in a tremendous improvement in the orbit\nuncertainties. The impact time is 3:05 UT with a 1-sigma uncertainty of 6 min,\nwhile the impact location corresponds to a west longitude of 44.7 deg and a\nlatitude of 13.1 deg with a 1-sigma uncertainty of 140 km. The minimum impact\nenergy estimated from the infrasound data and the impact velocity result in an\nestimated minimum mass of 22.6 t. By propagating the trajectory of 2014 AA\nbackwards we find that the only window for finding precovery observations is\nfor the three days before its discovery.\n", "  We analyze and give estimates for the long-distance coupling via floating\nmetallic gates between different types of spin qubits in quantum dots made of\ndifferent commonly used materials. In particular, we consider the hybrid, the\nsinglet-triplet, and the spin-$1/2$ qubits, and the pairwise coupling between\neach type of these qubits with another hybrid qubit in GaAs, InAs, Si, and\n$\\mathrm{Si_{0.9}Ge_{0.1}}$. We show that hybrid qubits can be capacitively\ncoupled strongly enough to implement two-qubit gates, as long as the distance\nof the dots from the metallic gates is small enough. Thus, hybrid qubits are\ngood candidates for scalable implementations of quantum computing in\nsemiconducting nanostructures.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional topological non-Fermi\nliquid in strongly correlated electron system, which has a holographic dual\ndescription by Einstein gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS)\nspace-time. In a dyonic Reissner-Nordstrom black hole background, we consider a\nDirac fermion coupled to the background $U(1)$ gauge theory and an intrinsic\nchiral gauge field $b_M$ induced by chiral anomaly. UV retarded Green's\nfunction of the charged fermion in the UV boundary from AdS$_4$ gravity is\ncalculated, by imposing in-falling wave condition at the horizon. We also\nobtain IR correlation function of the charged fermion at the IR boundary\narising from the near horizon geometry of the topological black hole with index\n$k=0,\\pm 1$. By using the UV retarded Green's function and IR correlation\nfunction, we analyze the low frequency behavior of the topological non-Fermi\nliquid at zero and finite temperatures, especially the relevant non-Fermi\nliquid behavior near the quantum critical region. In addition, we find that\nwhen $k=\\pm 1$, the effective mass of bulk Dirac fermion at IR fixed point is\ntopologically quantized, consequently the Fermi momentum presents a discrete\nsparse distributed pattern, in contrary to the Ricci flat case with $k=0$. As\ndemonstrated examples, we calculate the spectral functions of topological\nnon-Fermi liquid due to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($|\\vec{b}|\\ne 0, b_0=0$)\nand chiral magnetic effect (CME) ($|\\vec{b}| = 0, b_0\\ne 0$), which can be\ntested in topological materials such as topological insulator and topological\nmetal with strong couplings.\n", "  We present a novel method for solving population density equations (PDEs),\nwhere the populations can be subject to non-Markov noise for arbitrary\ndistributions of jump sizes. The method combines recent developments in two\ndifferent disciplines that traditionally have had limited interaction:\ncomputational neuroscience and the theory of random networks. The method uses a\ngeometric binning scheme, based on the method of characteristics, to capture\nthe deterministic neurodynamics of the population, separating the deterministic\nand stochastic process cleanly. We can independently vary the choice of the\ndeterministic model and the model for the stochastic process, leading to a\nhighly modular numerical solution strategy. We demonstrate this by replacing\nthe Master equation implicit in many formulations of the PDE formalism, by a\ngeneralization called the generalized Montroll-Weiss equation - a recent result\nfrom random network theory - describing a random walker subject to transitions\nrealized by a non-Markovian process. We demonstrate the method for leaky- (LIF)\nand quadratic-integrate and fire (QIF) neurons subject to spike trains with\nPoisson and gamma distributed spike intervals. We are able to model jump\nresponses for both models accurately to both excitatory and inhibitory input\nunder the assumption that all inputs are generated by one renewal process.\n", "  In the present work we model dark matter as a Bose-Einstein condensate and\nthe main goal is the deduction of the microscopic properties, namely, mass,\nnumber of particles, and scattering length, related to the particles comprised\nin the corresponding condensate. This task is done introducing in the\ncorresponding model the effects of the thermal cloud of the system. Three\nphysical conditions are imposed, i.e., mechanical equilibrium of the\ncondensate, explanation of the rotation curves of stars belonging to dwarf\ngalaxies, and, finally, the deflection of light due to the presence of dark\nmatter. These three aforementioned expressions allow us to cast the features of\nthe particles in terms of detectable astrophysical variables. Finally, the\nmodel is contrasted against observational data and in this manner we obtain\nvalues for the involved microscopic parameters of the condensate. The\nstatistical errors are seven and eighteen percent for the scattering length and\nmass of the dark matter particle, respectively.\n", "  The canonical redshift-scale factor relation, 1/a=1+z, is a key element in\nthe standard LambdaCDM model of the big bang cosmology. Despite its fundamental\nrole, this relation has not yet undergone any observational tests since\nLemaitre and Hubble established the expansion of the Universe. It is strictly\nbased on the assumption of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric\ndescribing a locally homogeneous and isotropic universe and that photons move\non null geodesics of the metric. Thus any violation of this assumption, within\ngeneral relativity or modified gravity, can yield a different mapping between\nthe model redshift z=1/a-1 and the actually observed redshift z_obs, i.e. z_obs\nneq z. Here we perform a simple test of consistency for the standard\nredshift-scale factor relation by determining simultaneous observational\nconstraints on the concordance LambdaCDM cosmological parameters and a\ngeneralized redshift mapping z=f(z_obs). Using current baryon acoustic\noscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data we demonstrate that the\ngeneralized redshift mapping is strongly degenerated with dark energy.\nMarginalization over a class of monotonic functions f(z_obs) changes\nsubstantially degeneracy between matter and dark energy density: the density\nparameters become anti correlated with nearly vertical axis of degeneracy.\nFurthermore, we show that current SN and BAO data, analysed in a framework with\nthe generalized redshift mapping, do not constrain dark energy unless the BAO\ndata include the measurements from the Ly-alpha forest of high-redshift\nquasars.\n", "  Gapped quantum liquids (GQL) include both topologically ordered states (with\nlong range entanglement) and symmetry protected topological (SPT) states (with\nshort range entanglement). In this paper, we propose a classification of 2+1D\nGQL for both bosonic and fermionic systems: 2+1D bosonic/fermionic GQLs with\nfinite on-site symmetry are classified by non-degenerate unitary braided fusion\ncategories over a symmetric fusion category (SFC) $\\cal E$, abbreviated as\n$\\text{UMTC}_{/\\cal E}$, together with their modular extensions and total\nchiral central charges. The SFC $\\cal E$ is $\\text{Rep}(G)$ for bosonic\nsymmetry $G$, or $\\text{sRep}(G^f)$ for fermionic symmetry $G^f$. As a special\ncase of the above result, we find that the modular extensions of\n$\\text{Rep}(G)$ classify the 2+1D bosonic SPT states of symmetry $G$, while the\n$c=0$ modular extensions of $\\text{sRep}(G^f)$ classify the 2+1D fermionic SPT\nstates of symmetry $G^f$. Many fermionic SPT states are studied based on the\nconstructions from free-fermion models. But it is not clear if free-fermion\nconstructions can produce all fermionic SPT states. Our classification does not\nhave such a drawback. We show that, for interacting 2+1D fermionic systems,\nthere are exactly 16 superconducting phases with no symmetry and no fractional\nexcitations (up to $E_8$ bosonic quantum Hall states). Also, there are exactly\n8 $Z_2\\times Z_2^f$-SPT phases, 2 $Z_8^f$-SPT phases, and so on. Besides, we\nshow that two topological orders with identical bulk excitations and central\ncharge always differ by the stacking of the SPT states of the same symmetry.\n", "  We study evolution of voids in cosmological simulations using a new method\nfor tracing voids over cosmic time. The method is based on tracking watershed\nbasins (contiguous regions around density minima) of well developed voids at\nlow redshift, on a regular grid of density field. It enables us to construct a\nrobust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from\ninitial conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach\neliminates strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids evolution is\ntraced by matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo\nmerger trees). We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a\nstandard LambdaCDM cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties\nof typical voids (with effective radii between 6Mpc/h and 20Mpc/h at redshift\nz=0) such as volumes, shapes, matter density distributions and relative\nalignments. The final voids at low redshifts appear to retain a significant\npart of the configuration acquired in initial conditions. Shapes of voids\nevolve in a collective way which barely modifies the overall distribution of\nthe axial ratios. The evolution appears to have a weak impact on mutual\nalignments of voids implying that the present state is in large part set up by\nthe primordial density field. We present evolution of dark matter density\nprofiles computed on iso-density surfaces which comply with the actual shapes\nof voids. Unlike spherical density profiles, this approach enables us to\ndemonstrate development of theoretically predicted bucket-like shape of the\nfinal density profiles indicating a wide flat core and a sharp transition to\nhigh-density void walls.\n", "  A likely source of earthquake clustering is static stress transfer between\nindividual events. Previous attempts to quantify the role of static stress for\nearthquake triggering generally considered only the stress changes caused by\nlarge events, and often discarded data uncertainties. We conducted a robust\ntwo-fold empirical test of the static stress change hypothesis by accounting\nfor all events of magnitude M>=2.5 and their location and focal mechanism\nuncertainties provided by catalogs for Southern California between 1981 and\n2010, first after resolving the focal plane ambiguity and second after randomly\nchoosing one of the two nodal planes. For both cases, we find compelling\nevidence supporting the static triggering with stronger evidence after\nresolving the focal plane ambiguity above significantly small (about 10 Pa) but\nconsistently observed stress thresholds. The evidence for the static triggering\nhypothesis is robust with respect to the choice of the friction coefficient,\nSkempton's coefficient and magnitude threshold. Weak correlations between the\nCoulomb Index (fraction of earthquakes that received positive Coulomb stress\nchange) and the coefficient of friction indicate that the role of normal stress\nin triggering is rather limited. Last but not the least, we determined that the\ncharacteristic time for the loss of the stress change memory of a single event\nis nearly independent of the amplitude of the Coulomb stress change and varies\nbetween ~95 and ~180 days implying that forecasts based on static stress\nchanges will have poor predictive skills beyond times that are larger than a\nfew hundred days on average.\n", "  A two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in yields and\nspectra derived from the charge-multiplicity dependence of 200 GeV p-p\ncollisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) is extended to\ndescribe p-p spectrum data from the large hadron collider (LHC) up to 13 TeV.\nThe LHC data include spectrum ratios that provide only partial information on\nthe TCM. The LHC ratio method is applied to well-understood 200 GeV spectrum\ndata to derive an algebraic link between spectrum ratios and the full TCM. Some\naspects of the form of the hard component on transverse momentum are found to\nbe $n_{ch}$ dependent. LHC spectrum ratios are then analyzed to obtain $n_{ch}$\nand collision-energy (over three orders of magnitude) dependence of isolated\nsoft and hard TCM spectrum components. The energy dependence of the spectrum\nsoft component is a new result suggesting a relation to Gribov diffusion. The\nspectrum hard component varies simply and smoothly with $n_{ch}$ suggesting\nbias of the underlying jet spectrum and linearly with QCD parameter\n$\\log(s/s_0)$, its properties consistent with minimum-bias reconstructed-jet\nspectrum measurements.\n", "  The ability to generate phase-stabilised trains of ultrafast laser pulses by\nmode-locking underpins photonics research in fields such as precision metrology\nand spectroscopy. However, the complexity of conventional mode-locked laser\nsystems, combined with the need for a mechanism to induce active or passive\nphase locking between resonator modes, has hindered their realisation at the\nnanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that GaAs-AlGaAs nanowire lasers are capable of\nemitting pairs of phase-locked picosecond laser pulses when subject to\nnon-resonant pulsed optical excitation with a repetition frequency up to\n~200GHz. By probing the two-pulse interference that emerges within the\nhomogeneously broadened laser emission, we show that the optical phase is\npreserved over timescales extending beyond ~30ps, much longer than the emitted\nlaser pulse duration (~2ps). Simulations performed by solving the optical Bloch\nequations produce good quantitative agreement with experiments, revealing how\nthe phase information is stored in the gain medium close to transparency. Our\nresults open the way to applications such as on-chip, ultra-sensitive Ramsey\ncomb spectroscopy.\n", "  In previous works, we showed that an optimal quantum algorithm can always be\nseen as a sum over classical histories in each of which the problem solver\nknows in advance one of the possible halves of the solution she will read in\nthe future and performs the computation steps (oracle queries) still needed to\nreach it. Given an oracle problem, this retrocausal explanation of the speedup\nyields the order of magnitude of the number of oracle queries needed to solve\nit in an optimal quantum way. Presently, we provide a fundamental justification\nfor the explanation in question and show that it comes out by just completing\nthe physical representation of quantum algorithms. Since the use of\nretrocausality in quantum mechanics is controversial, showing that it answers\nthe well accepted requirement of the completeness of the physical description\nshould be an important pass.\n", "  After a very brief recollection of how my scientific collaboration with Ugo\nstarted, in this talk I will present some recent results obtained with\nlocalization: the deformed gauge theory partition function $Z(\\vec\\tau|q)$ and\nthe expectation value of circular Wilson loops $W$ on a squashed four-sphere\nwill be computed. The partition function is deformed by turning on $\\tau_J\n\\,{\\rm tr} \\, \\Phi^J$ interactions with $\\Phi$ the ${\\cal N}=2$ superfield.\n  For the ${\\cal N}=4$ theory SUSY gauge theory exact formulae for $Z$ and $W$\nin terms of an underlying $U(N)$ interacting matrix model can be derived thus\nreplacing the free Gaussian model describing the undeformed ${\\cal N}=4$\ntheory. These results will be then compared with those obtained with the dual\nCFT according to the AGT correspondence. The interactions introduced previously\nare in fact related to the insertions of commuting integrals of motion in the\nfour-point CFT correlator and the chiral correlators are expressed as\n$\\tau$-derivatives of the gauge theory partition function on a finite\n$\\Omega$-background.\n", "  We calculate for the first time the electric dipole moment (EDM) of $^{13}$C\ngenerated by the isovector CP-odd pion exchange nuclear force in the\n$\\alpha$-cluster model, which describes well the structures of low lying states\nof the $^{13}$C nucleus. The linear dependence of the EDM of $^{13}$C on the\nneutron EDM and the isovector CP-odd nuclear coupling is found to be\n$d_{^{13}{\\rm C}} = -0.33 d_n - 0.0020 \\bar G_\\pi^{(1)}$. The linear\nenhancement factor of the CP-odd nuclear coupling is smaller than that of the\ndeuteron, due to the difference of the structure between the $1/2^-_1$ state\nand the opposite parity ($1/2^+$) states. We clarify the role of the structure\nplayed in the enhancement of the EDM. This result provides good guiding\nprinciples to search for other nuclei with large enhancement factor. We also\nmention the role of the EDM of $^{13}$C in determining the new physics beyond\nthe standard model.\n", "  Using the non-equilibrium statistical operator method (NSO), we have\ninvestigated the spin transport through the interface in a\nsemiconductor/ferromagnetic insulator hybrid structure. We have analyzed the\napproximation of effective parameters, when each of the considered subsystems\n(conduction electrons, magnons, and phonons) is characterized by its effective\ntemperature. We have constructed the macroscopic equations, describing the\nspin-wave current caused by both resonantly excited spin system of conduction\nelectrons and by an inhomogeneous thermal field in the ferromagnetic insulator.\n", "  In the framework of quantum open systems we analyze data from KamLAND by\nusing a model that considers neutrino oscillation in a three-family\napproximation with the inclusion of the decoherence effect. Using a $\\chi^2$\ntest we find new limits for the decoherence parameter which we call $\\gamma$,\nconsidering the most recent data by KamLAND. Assuming an energy dependence of\nthe type $ \\gamma = \\gamma_0 \\left( E/E_0 \\right) ^n$, in 95 \\% C.L. the limits\nfound are $3.7 \\times 10^{-24} GeV$ for $ n=-1$, $6.8 \\times 10^{-22} GeV$ for\n$ n=0$, and $1.5 \\times 10^{-19} GeV$ for $ n=1 $ on the energy dependence.\n", "  The decay mode $B\\to K^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$ is one of the most promising modes to\nprobe physics beyond the standard model (SM), since the angular distribution of\nthe decay products enable measurement of several constraining observables. LHCb\nhas recently measured these observables using $3fb^{-1}$ of data as a binned\nfunction of $q^2$, the dilepton invariant mass squared. We find that LHCb data\nimplies evidence for right-handed currents, which are absent in the SM. These\nconclusions are derived in the maximum $q^2$ limit and are free from hadronic\ncorrections. Our approach differs from other approaches that probe new physics\nat low $q^2$ as it does not require estimates of hadronic parameters but relies\ninstead on heavy quark symmetries that are reliable at the maximum $q^2$\nkinematic endpoint.\n", "  We study the doubly charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^+$ in high energy nuclear\ncollisions. We solve the three-body Schr\u007foedinger equation with relativistic\ncorrection and calculate the $\\Xi_{cc}^+$ yield and transverse momentum\ndistribution via coalescence mechanism. For $\\Xi_{cc}^+$ production in central\nPb+Pb collisions at LHC energy, the yield is extremely enhanced, and the\nproduction cross section per binary collision is one order of magnitude larger\nthan that in p+p collisions. This indicates that, it is most probable to\ndiscover $\\Xi_{cc}^+$ in heavy ion collisions and its discovery can be\nconsidered as a probe of the quark-luon plasma formation.\n", "  The classical electrodynamic two-body problem has been a long standing open\nproblem in mathematics. For motion constrained to the straight line, the\ninteraction is similar to that of the two-body problem of classical\ngravitation. The additional complication is the presence of unbounded\nstate-dependent delays in the Coulomb forces due to the finiteness of the speed\nof light. This circumstance renders the notion of local solutions meaningless,\nand therefore, straight-forward ODE techniques can not be applied. Here, we\nstudy the time-symmetric case, i.e., the Fokker-Schwarzschild-Tetrode (FST)\nequations, comprising both advanced and retarded delays. We extend the\ntechnique developed in \\cite{DirkGuenter}, where existence of FST solutions was\nproven on the half-line, to ensure global existence -- a result that had been\nobtained by Bauer \\cite{Bauer} in 1997. Due to the novel technique, the\npresented proof is shorter and more transparent but also relies on the idea to\nemploy asymptotic data to characterize solutions.\n", "  We present an atomistic description of the {\\it fcc}--to--{\\it hcp}\ntransformation mechanism in solid argon (Ar) obtained from transition path\nsampling molecular dynamics simulation. The phase transition pathways collected\nduring the sampling for an 8000--particle system reveal three transition types\naccording to the lattice deformation and relaxation details. In all three\ntransition types, we see a critical accumulation of defects and uniform growth\nof a less ordered transition state, followed by a homogeneous growth of an\nordered phase. Stacking disorder is discussed to describe the transition\nprocess and the cooperative motions of atoms in \\{111\\} planes. We investigate\nthe nucleation with larger system. In a system of 18000--particles, the\ncollective movements of atoms required for this transition are facilitated by\nthe formation and growth of stacking faults. However the enthalpy barrier is\nstill far beyond the thermal fluctuation. The high barrier explains previous\nexperimental observations of the inaccessibility of the bulk transition at low\npressure and its sluggishness even at extremely high pressure. The transition\nmechanism in bulk Ar is different from Ar nanoclusters as the orthorhombic\nintermediate structure proposed for the latter is not observed in any of our\nsimulations.\n", "  This paper studies the stochastic differential equation (SDE) associated to a\ntwo-level quantum system (qubit) subject to Hamiltonian evolution as well as\nunmonitored and monitored decoherence channels. The latter imply a stochastic\nevolution of the quantum state (density operator), whose associated probability\ndistribution we characterize. We first show that for two sets of typical\nexperimental settings, corresponding either to weak quantum non demolition\nmeasurements or to weak fluorescence measurements, the three Bloch coordinates\nof the qubit remain confined to a deterministically evolving surface or curve\ninside the Bloch sphere. We explicitly solve the deterministic evolution, and\nwe provide a closed-form expression for the probability distribution on this\nsurface or curve. Then we relate the existence in general of such\ndeterministically evolving submanifolds to an accessibility question of control\ntheory, which can be answered with an explicit algebraic criterion on the SDE.\nThis allows us to show that, for a qubit, the above two sets of weak\nmeasurements are essentially the only ones featuring deterministic surfaces or\ncurves.\n", "  We discuss the correlation function for the metric for homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmologies. The exact propagator equation determines the correlation\nfunction as the inverse of the second functional derivative of the quantum\neffective action. This formulation relates the metric correlation function\nemployed in quantum gravity computations to cosmological observables as the\ngraviton power spectrum. In the Einstein-Hilbert approximation for the\neffective action the on-shell graviton correlation function can be obtained\nequivalently from a product of mode functions which solve the linearized\nEinstein equations. In contrast, the product of mode functions, often employed\nin the context of cosmology, does not yield the correlation function for the\nvector and scalar components of the metric fluctuations. We divide the metric\nfluctuations into \"physical fluctuations\", which couple to a conserved energy\nmomentum tensor, and gauge fluctuations. On the subspace of physical metric\nfluctuations the relation to physical sources becomes invertible, such that the\neffective action and its relation to correlation functions no longer needs to\ninvolve a gauge fixing term. The physical metric fluctuations have a similar\nstatus as the Bardeen potentials, while being formulated in a covariant way. We\ncompute the effective action for the physical metric fluctuations for\ngeometries corresponding to realistic cosmologies.\n", "  The multi-flavor $BF$ theories in (3+1) dimensions with cubic or quartic\ncoupling are the simplest topological quantum field theories that can describe\nfractional braiding statistics between loop-like topological excitations\n(three-loop or four-loop braiding statistics). In this paper, by canonically\nquantizing these theories, we study the algebra of Wilson loop and Wilson\nsurface operators, and multiplets of ground states on three torus. In\nparticular, by quantizing these coupled $BF$ theories on the three-torus, we\nexplicitly calculate the $\\mathcal{S}$- and $\\mathcal{T}$-matrices, which\nencode fractional braiding statistics and topological spin of loop-like\nexcitations, respectively. In the coupled $BF$ theories with cubic and quartic\ncoupling, the Hopf link and Borromean ring of loop excitations, together with\npoint-like excitations, form composite particles.\n", "  Support for extremist entities - whether from the far right, or far left -\noften manages to survive globally online despite significant external pressure,\nand may ultimately inspire violent acts by individuals having no obvious prior\nhistory of extremism. Examining longitudinal records of extremist online\nactivity, we uncovered an ecology evolving on a daily timescale that drives\nonline support, and we provide a mathematical theory that describes it. The\necology features self-organized aggregates (online groups such as on Facebook\nor another social media analog) that proliferate preceding the onset of recent\nreal-world campaigns, and adopt novel adaptive mechanisms to enhance their\nsurvival. One of the predictions is that development of large, potentially\npotent online groups can be thwarted by targeting smaller ones.\n", "  In this paper we calculate pair production from bremsstrahlung as a classical\neffect in Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron electrodynamics. In this framework,\nworldlines are traced out dynamically through the evolution of events\n$x^\\mu(\\tau)$ parameterized by a chronological time $\\tau$ that is independent\nof the spacetime coordinates. These events, defined in an unconstrained 8D\nphase space, interact through five $\\tau$-dependent gauge fields induced by the\nevent evolution. The resulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from\nconventional electromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an\nequilibrium limit. In particular, the total mass-energy-momentum of particles\nand fields is conserved, but the mass-shell constraint is lifted from\nindividual interacting events, so that the standard Feynman-Stueckelberg\ninterpretation of pair creation/annihilation is implemented in classical\nmechanics.\n", "  We investigate the quantum interference effects of single photon transfer in\ntwo-atom cavity system caused by external excitation phase. In the proposed\nsystem, two identical atoms (with different positions in the optical cavity)\nare firstly prepared into a timed state by an external single photon field.\nDuring the excitation, the atoms grasp different phases which depend on the\nspatial positions of the atoms in the cavity. Due to strong resonant\ninteraction between two atoms and optical cavity mode the absorbed input photon\ncan be efficiently transferred from the atoms to the resonant cavity mode. We\nshow that the quantum transfer is highly sensitive to the external excitation\nphases of atoms and it leads to quantum interference effects on the cavity mode\nexcitation. Besides, the quantum transfer is also influenced by the\ndipole-dipole interaction dependent to the atomic distance. In this system the\natomic positions also determine the coupling constants between atoms and cavity\nmode which causes additional interference effects to the photon exchange\nbetween atoms and cavity. Based on the characteristics of excitation phase we\nfind that it is a feasible scheme to generate long-lived dark state and it\ncould be useful for storage and manipulation of single photon fields by\ncontrolling the excitation phase.\n", "  Motivated by observations of saturation overshoot, this paper investigates\nnumerical modeling of two-phase flow incorporating dynamic capillary pressure.\nThe effects of the dynamic capillary coefficient, the infiltrating flux rate\nand the initial and boundary values are systematically studied using a\ntravelling wave ansatz and efficient numerical methods. The travelling wave\nsolutions may exhibit monotonic, non-monotonic or plateau-shaped behaviour.\nSpecial attention is paid to the non-monotonic profiles. The travelling wave\nresults are confirmed by numerically solving the partial differential equation\nusing an accurate adaptive moving mesh solver. Comparisons between the computed\nsolutions using the Brooks-Corey model and the laboratory measurements of\nsaturation overshoot verify the effectiveness of our approach.\n", "  Assuming the standard axioms for quaternionic quantum theory and a spatially\nlocalized scattering interaction, the $S$-matrix in quaternionic quantum theory\nis complex valued, not quaternionic. Using the standard connections between the\n$S$-matrix, the forward scattering amplitude for electromagnetic wave\nscattering, and the index of refraction, we show that the index of refraction\nis necessarily complex, not quaternionic. This implies that the recent optical\nexperiment of Procopio et al. based on the Peres proposal does not test for\nhyper-complex or quaternionic quantum effects arising within the standard\nHilbert space framework. Such a test requires looking at near zone fields, not\nradiation zone fields.\n", "  The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model lays the foundation of many important\nconcepts in quantum topological matters. Since it tells one that topological\nstates may be distinguished by abelian geometric phases, a question naturally\narises as to what happens if one assembles two topologically distinct states.\nHere, we show that a spin-dependent double-well optical lattice allows one to\ncouple two topologically distinct SSH chains in the bulk and realise a\nglided-two-leg SSH model that respects the glide reflection symmetry. Such\nmodel gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena beyond the paradigm of a\ntraditional SSH model. It is characterised by Wilson line that requires\nnon-abelian Berry connections, and the interplay between the glide symmetry and\ninteraction automatically leads to charge fractionalisation without jointing\ntwo lattice potentials at an interface. Our work demonstrates the power of\nultracold atoms to create new theoretical models for studying topological\nmatters.\n", "  A discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method based on dynamically\nadaptive Cartesian meshes (ACM) is developed for a full-wave analysis of\nelectromagnetic fields in dispersive media. Hierarchical Cartesian grids offer\nsimplicity close to that of structured grids and the flexibility of\nunstructured grids while being highly suited for adaptive mesh refinement\n(AMR). The developed DGTD-ACM achieves a desired accuracy by refining\nnon-conformal meshes near material interfaces to reduce stair-casing errors\nwithout sacrificing the high efficiency afforded with uniform Cartesian meshes.\nMoreover, DGTD-ACM can dynamically refine the mesh to resolve the local\nvariation of the fields during propagation of electromagnetic pulses. A local\ntime-stepping scheme is adopted to alleviate the constraint on the time-step\nsize due to the stability condition of the explicit time integration.\nSimulations of electromagnetic wave diffraction over conducting and dielectric\ncylinders and spheres demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a good\nnumerical accuracy at a reduced computational cost compared with uniform\nmeshes. For simulations of dispersive media, the auxiliary differential\nequation (ADE) and recursive convolution (RC) methods are implemented for a\nlocal Drude model and tested for a cold plasma slab and a plasmonic rod. With\nfurther advances of the charge transport models, the DGTD-ACM method is\nexpected to provide a powerful tool for computations of electromagnetic fields\nin complex geometries for applications to high-frequency electronic devices,\nplasmonic THz technologies, as well as laser-induced and microwave plasmas.\n", "  Quantum emitters, such as q-dots and dye molecules, in the immediate vicinity\nof plasmonic nanostructures, resonantly excite surface plasmon-polaritons\n(SPPs) under incoherent pump. The efficiency in the excitation of SPPs\nincreases as the number of the emitters, because the SPP field synchronizes\nemission of the coupled emitters, in analogy with the superadiance (SR) of\ncoupled emitters in free space. Using fully quantum mechanical model for two\nemitters coupled to a single gold nanorod, we predict up to 15% increase in the\nemission yield of single emitter compared to only one emitter coupled to the\nnanorod due to plasmonic SR. (XW: I use emission yield because the quantum\nefficiency is one for emitters in free space and there is no room for\nenhancement). Such emission enhancement is stationary and should be observable\neven with strong dissipation and dephasing under incoherent pump. Solid-state\nquantum emitters with blinking behaviors may be utilized to demonstrate such\nplasmonic SR emission enhancement. Plasmonic SR may find implications in the\nexcitation of non-radiative modes in plasmonic waveguides; and lowing threshold\nof plasmonic nanolasers.\n", "  Rains' bound is arguably the best known upper bound of the distillable\nentanglement by operations completely preserving positivity of partial\ntranspose (PPT) and was conjectured to be additive and coincide with the\nasymptotic relative entropy of entanglement. We disprove both conjectures by\nexplicitly constructing a special class of mixed two-qubit states. We then\nintroduce an additive semidefinite programming lower bound ($E_M$) for the\nasymptotic Rains' bound, and it immediately becomes a computable lower bound\nfor entanglement cost of bipartite states. Furthermore, $E_M$ is also proved to\nbe the best known upper bound of the PPT-assisted deterministic distillable\nentanglement and gives the asymptotic rates for all pure states and some class\nof genuinely mixed states.\n", "  We study nonlinear heat conduction equations with memory effects within the\nframework of the fractional calculus approach to the generalized\nMaxwell-Cattaneo law. Our main aim is to derive the governing equations of heat\npropagation, considering both the empirical temperature-dependence of the\nthermal conductivity coefficient (which introduces nonlinearity) and memory\neffects, according to the general theory of Gurtin and Pipkin of finite\nvelocity thermal propagation with memory. In this framework, we consider in\ndetail two different approaches to the generalized Maxwell-Cattaneo law, based\non the application of long-tail Mittag-Leffler memory function and power law\nrelaxation functions, leading to nonlinear time-fractional telegraph and\nwave-type equations. We also discuss some explicit analytical results to the\nmodel equations based on the generalized separating variable method and discuss\ntheir meaning in relation to some well-known results of the ordinary case.\n", "  We construct the most general composite operators of N = 4 SYM in Lorentz\nharmonic chiral ($\\approx$ twistor) superspace. The operators are built from\nthe SYM supercurvature which is nonpolynomial in the chiral gauge\nprepotentials. We reconstruct the full nonchiral dependence of the\nsupercurvature. We compute all tree-level MHV form factors via the LSZ\nredcution procedure with on-shell states made of the same supercurvature.\n", "  Here, we present a detailed study on low bias current-voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristic of graphene superlattice (GSL) resonant tunneling diode (RTD)\nwith heterostructured substrate and series of grounded metallic planes placed\nover graphene sheet which induce periodically modulated Dirac gap and Fermi\nvelocity barrier. We investigate the effect of GSL parameters on I-V\ncharacteristics within the Landauer-Buttiker formalism and adopted transfer\nmatrix method. We show how the engineering these parameters results in\nmultipeak NDR in proposed device. Moreover we provide a novel venue to control\nthe NDR in GSL with Fermi velocity engineering. From this viewpoint we obtain\nmultipeak NDR through miniband align in GSL. Maximum Pick to Valley ratio (PVR)\nup to 167 obtained for correlation velocity of 1.9 and bias voltages between\n70-130 mV. Our finding in low bias regime and high PVR multipeak NDR have a\nconsiderable importance in multi-valued memory functional circuit, low power\nand high-speed nanoelectronic devices application.\n", "  We solve for properties of $^6$Li in the ab initio No-Core Full Configuration\napproach and we separately solve for its ground state and $J^{\\pi}=2_{2}^{+}$\nresonance with the Gamow Shell Model in the Berggren basis. We employ both the\nJISP16 and chiral NNLO$_{opt}$ realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions and\ninvestigate the ground state energy, excitation energies, point proton\nroot-mean-square radius and a suite of electroweak observables. We also extend\nand test methods to extrapolate the ground state energy, point proton\nroot-mean-square radius, and electric quadrupole moment. We attain improved\nestimates of these observables in the No-Core Full Configuration approach by\nusing basis spaces up through N$_{max}$=18 that enable more definitive\ncomparisons with experiment. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group\napproach with the JISP16 interaction, we find that we can significantly improve\nthe convergence of the Gamow Shell Model treatment of the $^6$Li ground state\nand $J^{\\pi}=2_{2}^{+}$ resonance by adopting a natural orbital single-particle\nbasis.\n", "  Multistability is a ubiquitous feature in systems of geophysical relevance\nand provides key challenges for our ability to predict a system's response to\nperturbations. Near critical transitions small causes can lead to large effects\nand - for all practical purposes - irreversible changes in the properties of\nthe system. The Earth climate is multistable: present astronomical and\nastrophysical conditions support two stable regimes, the warm climate we live\nin, and a snowball climate, characterized by global glaciation. We first\nprovide an overview of methods and ideas relevant for studying the climate\nresponse to forcings and focus on the properties of critical transitions.\nFollowing an idea developed by Eckhardt and co. for the investigation of\nmultistable turbulent flows, we study the global instability giving rise to the\nsnowball/warm multistability in the climate system by identifying the climatic\nedge state, a saddle embedded in the boundary between the two basins of\nattraction of the stable climates. The edge state attracts initial conditions\nbelonging to such a boundary and is the gate facilitating noise-induced\ntransitions between competing attractors. We use a simplified yet Earth-like\nclimate model constructed by coupling a primitive equations model of the\natmosphere with a simple diffusive ocean. We refer to the climatic edge states\nas Melancholia states. We study their dynamics, their symmetry properties, and\nwe follow a complex set of bifurcations. We find situations where the\nMelancholia state has chaotic dynamics. In these cases, the basin boundary\nbetween the two basins of attraction is a strange geometric set with a nearly\nzero codimension, and relate this feature to the time scale separation between\ninstabilities occurring on weather and climatic time scales. We also discover a\nnew stable climatic state characterized by non-trivial symmetry properties.\n", "  We study the noncommutative corrections on the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm\neffect when both the coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum\nnoncommutativities are considered. This study is motivated by the recent\nobservation that there is no net phase shift in the time-dependent AB effect on\nthe ordinary space, and therefore tiny derivation from zero can indicate new\nphysics. The vanishing of the time-dependent AB phase shift on the ordinary\nspace is preserved by the gauge and Lorentz symmetries. However, on the\nnoncomutative phase space, while the ordinary gauge symmetry can be kept by the\nSeiberg-Witten map, but the Lorentz symmetry is broken. Therefore nontrivial\nnoncommutative corrections are expected. We find there are three kinds of\nnoncommutative corrections in general: 1) $\\xi$-dependent correction which\ncomes from the noncommutativity among momentum operators; 2) momentum-dependent\ncorrection which is rooted in the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative\nextended model; 3) momentum-independent correction which emerges become of the\ngauge invariant condition on the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative\nmodel. We proposed two dimensionless quantities, which are based on the\ndistributions of the measured phase shift with respect to the external magnetic\nfield and to the cross section enclosed by the particle trajectory, to extract\nthe noncommutative parameters. We find that stronger (weaker) magnetic field\nstrength can give better bounds on the coordinate-coordinate\n(momentum-momentum) noncommutative parameter, and large parameter space region\ncan be explored by the time-dependent AB effect.\n", "  In this paper, new electrically charged asymptotically flat black hole\nsolutions are numerically derived in the context of higher derivative gravity.\nThese solutions can be interpreted as generalizations of two different classes\nof non-charged asymptotically flat spacetimes: Schwarzschild and\nnon-Schwarzschild solutions. Extreme black hole solutions and black holes with\nnegative mass were found.\n", "  In previous publications, we illustrated the effectiveness of the method of\nthe inhomogeneous differential equation in calculating the electric\npolarizability in the one-dimensional problem. In this paper we extend our\neffort to apply the method to the three-dimensional problem.\n", "  We define notions of local topological convergence and local geometric\nconvergence for embedded graphs in $\\mathbb{R}^n,$ and study their properties.\nThe former is related to Benjamini-Schramm convergence, and the latter to weak\nconvergence of probability measures with respect to a certain topology on the\nspace of embedded graphs. These are used to state universality conjectures for\nthe long-term behavior of the network flow, or curvature flow on embedded\ngraphs. To provide evidence these conjectures, we develop and apply\ncomputational methods to test for local topological and local geometric\nconvergence.\n", "  We undertake a covariance error analysis of the pion-nucleon-nucleon coupling\nconstants from the Granada-2013 np and pp database comprising a total of 6720\nscattering data below LAB energy of 350 MeV. Assuming a unique pion-nucleon\ncoupling constant in the One Pion Exchange potential above a boundary radius\n$r_c=3 {\\rm fm}$ we obtain $f^2=0.0763(1)$. The effects of charge symmetry\nbreaking on the $^3P_0$, $^3P_1$ and $^3P_2$ partial waves are analyzed and we\nfind $f_{p}^2 = 0.0761(4)$, $f_{0}^2 = 0.0790(9)$ and $f_{c}^2 = 0.0772(6)$\nwith a strong anti-correlation between $f_c^2$ and $f_0^2$. We successfully\ntest normality for the residuals of the fit. Potential tails in terms of\ndifferent boundary radii as well as chiral Two-Pion-Exchange contributions as\nsources of systematic uncertainty are also investigated.\n", "  In this paper we develop a geometric version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nin the Poisson setting. Specifically, we \"geometrize\" what is usually called a\ncomplete solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We use some well-known\nresults about symplectic groupoids, in particular cotangent groupoids, as a\nkeystone for the construction of our framework. Our methodology follows the\nambitious program proposed by A. Weinstein, [62], in order to develop geometric\nformulations of the dynamical behavior of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on\nLie algebroids and Lie groupoids. This procedure allows us to take symmetries\ninto account, and, as a by-product, we recover results from [14, 29, 31], but\neven in these situations our approach is new. A theory of generating functions\nfor the Poisson structures considered here is also developed following the same\npattern, solving a longstanding problem of the area: how to obtain a generating\nfunction for the identity tranformation and the nearby Poisson automorphisms of\nPoisson manifolds. A direct application of our results give the construction of\na family of Poisson integrators, that is, integrators that conserve the\nunderlying Poisson geometry. These integrators are implemented in the paper in\nbenchmark problems. Some conclusions, current and future directions of research\nare shown at the end of the paper.\n", "  The properties of coherence and polarization of light has been the subject of\nintense investigations and form the basis of many technological applications.\nThese concepts which historically have been treated independently can now be\nformulated under a single classical theory. Here, we derive a quantum\ncounterpart for this theory, with basis on a density matrix formulation, which\ndescribes jointly the coherence and polarization properties of an ensemble of\nphotons. The method is used to show how the degree of polarization of a\nspecific class of mixed states changes on propagation in free space, and how an\ninteracting environment can suppress the coherence and polarization degrees of\na general state. This last application can be particularly useful in the\nanalysis of decoherence effects in optical quantum information implementations.\n", "  We investigate the origins and implications of the duality between\ntopological insulators and topological superconductors in three and four\nspacetime dimensions. In the latter, the duality transformation can be made at\nthe level of the path integral in the standard way, while in three dimensions,\nit takes the form of \"self-duality in odd dimensions\". In this sense, it is\nclosely related to the particle-vortex duality of planar systems. In\nparticular, we use this to elaborate on Son's conjecture that a three\ndimensional Dirac fermion that can be thought of as the surface mode of a four\ndimensional topological insulator is dual to a composite fermion.\n", "  The effect of quantum collapse and revival is a fascinating interference\nphenomenon. In this paper the phenomenon is demonstrated analytically and\nnumerically for a simple system, a slightly anharmonic Hamiltonian. The initial\nwave-function is a displaced ground state of a harmonic oscillator. Possible\nexperimental realizations for cold atoms are discussed in detail.\n", "  Reformulation of a combinatorial problem into optimization of a\nstatistical-mechanics system, enables finding a better solution using\nheuristics derived from a physical process, such as by the SA (Simulated\nAnnealing). In this paper, we present a Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) searching\nmethod based on the SA on an Ising model. By equivalence, an H-matrix can be\nconverted into an SH (Seminormalized Hadamard) matrix; whose first columns are\nunity vector and the rest ones are vectors with equal number of -1 and +1\ncalled SH-vectors. We define SH spin-vectors to represent the SH vectors, which\nplay a similar role to the spins on an Ising model. The topology of the lattice\nis generalized into a graph, whose edges represent orthogonality relationship\namong the SH spin-vectors. Started from a randomly generated quasi H-matrix Q,\nwhich is a matrix similar to the SH-matrix without imposing orthogonality, we\nperform the SA. The transitions of Q are conducted by random exchange of {+,-}\nspin-pair within the SH-spin vectors which follow the Metropolis update rule.\nUpon transition toward zero-energy, the Q-matrix is evolved following a Markov\nchain toward an orthogonal matrix, at which point the H-matrix is said to be\nfound. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to find some low\norder H-matrices, including the ones that cannot trivially be constructed by\nthe Sylvester method.\n", "  Building on the analytical description of the post-merger (ringdown) waveform\nof coalescing, non-precessing, spinning, (BBHs) introduced in Phys. Rev. D 90,\n024054 (2014), we propose an analytic, closed form, time-domain, representation\nof the $\\ell=m=2$ gravitational radiation mode emitted after merger. This\nexpression is given as a function of the component masses and dimensionless\nspins $(m_{1,2},\\chi_{1,2})$ of the two inspiralling objects, as well as of the\nmass $M_{\\rm BH}$ and (complex) frequency $\\sigma_{1}$ of the fundamental\nquasi-normal mode of the remnant black hole. Our proposed template is obtained\nby fitting the post-merger waveform part of several publicly available\nnumerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS)\ncatalog and then suitably interpolating over (symmetric) mass ratio and spins.\nWe show that this analytic expression accurately reproduces ($\\sim$~0.01 rad)\nthe phasing of the post-merger data of other datasets not used in its\nconstruction. This is notably the case of the spin-aligned run SXS:BBH:0305,\nwhose intrinsic parameters are consistent with the 90\\% credible intervals\nreported by the parameter-estimation followup of GW150914 in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n116 (2016) no.24, 241102. Using SXS waveforms as \"experimental\" data, we\nfurther show that our template could be used on the actual GW150914 data to\nperform a new measure the complex frequency of the fundamental quasi-normal\nmode so to exploit the complete (high signal-to-noise-ratio) post-merger\nwaveform.\n", "  The development of wide-area cryogenic light detectors with good energy\nresolution is one of the priorities of next generation bolometric experiments\nsearching for rare interactions, as the simultaneous read-out of the light and\nheat signals enables background suppression through particle identification.\nAmong the proposed technological approaches for the phonon sensor, the\nnaturally-multiplexed Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) stand out for their\nexcellent intrinsic energy resolution and reproducibility. To satisfy the large\nsurface requirement (several cm$^2$) KIDs are deposited on an insulating\nsubstrate that converts the impinging photons into phonons. A fraction of\nphonons is absorbed by the KID, producing a signal proportional to the energy\nof the original photons. The potential of this technique was proved by the\nCALDER project, that reached a baseline resolution of 154$\\pm$7 eV RMS by\nsampling a 2$\\times$2 cm$^2$ Silicon substrate with 4 Aluminum KIDs. In this\npaper we present a prototype of Aluminum KID with improved geometry and quality\nfactor. The design improvement, as well as the combined analysis of amplitude\nand phase signals, allowed to reach a baseline resolution of 82$\\pm$4 eV by\nsampling the same substrate with a single Aluminum KID.\n", "  In the present work we have studied Natural Inflation in the framework of the\nRandall-Sundrum II brane model (RS-II) in the light of the latest Planck\nresults. Adopting the Randall-Sundrum fine-tuning, the model is characterized\nby 3 parameters in total, namely the 5-dimensional Planck mass $M_5$ and the\ntwo mass scales of the inflaton potential $f$ and $\\Lambda$. We show in the\n$n_s-r$ plane the theoretical predictions of the model together with the\nallowed contour plots, and we conclude that the model is viable. By using the\nPlanck results only it is possible to determine the two mass scales of the\ninflaton potential in terms of $M_5$, which remains undetermined. However,\nthere are several good theoretical reasons to consider a higher-dimensional\nPlanck mass of the order of $10 TeV$, which is compatible with primordial\nnucleosynthesis. If we insist on considering a $M_5$ of this order of magnitude\nall parameters are known and a sub-Planckian excursion of the inflaton scalar\nfield is achieved.\n", "  The phenomenological textbook equations for the charge and heat transport are\nextensively used in a number of fields ranging from semiconductor devices to\nthermoelectricity. We provide a rigorous derivation of transport equations by\nsolving the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation and show\nthat the currents can be rigorously represented by an expansion in terms of the\n'driving forces'. Besides the linear and non-linear response to the electric\nfield, the gradient of the chemical potential and temperature, there are also\nterms that give the response to the higher-order derivatives of the potentials.\nThese new, non-local responses, which have not been discussed before, might\nplay an important role for some materials and/or in certain conditions, like\nextreme miniaturization. Our solution provides the general solution of the\nBoltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation (or equivalently the\nparticular solution for the specific boundary conditions). It differs from the\nHilbert expansion which provides only one of infinitely many solutions which\nmay or may not satisfy the required boundary conditions.\n", "  An important question to be addressed regarding system control on a time\ninterval $[0, T]$ is whether some particular target state in the configuration\nspace is reachable from a given initial state. When the target of interest\nrefers only to a portion of the spatial domain, we speak about regional\nanalysis. Cellular Automata (CA) approach have been recently promoted for the\nstudy of control problems on spatially extended systems for which the classical\napproaches cannot be used. An interesting problem concerns the situation where\nthe subregion of interest is not interior to the domain but a portion of its\nboundary. In this paper we address the problem of regional controllability of\ncellular automata via boundary actions, i.e., we investigate the\ncharacteristics of a cellular automaton so that it can be controlled inside a\ngiven region only acting on the value of sites at its boundaries.\n", "  Domain wall motion driven by ultra-short laser pulses is a prerequisite for\nenvisaged low-power spintronics combining storage of information in magneto\nelectronic devices with high speed and long distance transmission of\ninformation encoded in circularly polarized light. Here we demonstrate the\nconversion of the circular polarization of incident femtosecond laser pulses\ninto inertial displacement of a domain wall in a ferromagnetic semiconductor.\nIn our study we combine electrical measurements and magneto-optical imaging of\nthe domain wall displacement with micromagnetic simulations. The optical spin\ntransfer torque acts over a picosecond recombination time of the spin polarized\nphoto-carriers which only leads to a deformation of the internal domain wall\nstructure. We show that subsequent depinning and micro-meter distance\ndisplacement without an applied magnetic field or any other external stimuli\ncan only occur due to the inertia of the domain wall.\n", "  Nanophotonics and metamaterials have revolutionised the way we think about\noptical space (epsilon, mu), enabling us to engineer the refractive index\nalmost at will, to confine light to the smallest of the volumes, and to\nmanipulate optical signals with extremely small footprints and energy\nrequirements. Significant efforts are now devoted to finding suitable materials\nand strategies for the dynamic control of the optical properties. Transparent\nconductive oxides exhibit large ultrafast nonlinearities under both interband\nand intraband excitations. Here, we show that combining these two effects in\naluminium-doped zinc oxide via a two colour laser field discloses new material\nfunctionalities. Owing to the independence of the two nonlinearities the\nultrafast temporal dynamics of the material permittivity can be designed by\nacting on the amplitude and delay of the two fields. We demonstrate the\npotential applications of this novel degree of freedom by dynamically\naddressing the modulation bandwidth and optical spectral tuning of a probe\noptical pulse.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic stabilities of uncharged and charged black holes\nsurrounded by quintessence (BHQ) by means of effective thermodynamic\nquantities. When the state parameter of quintessence $\\omega_q$ is\nappropriately chosen, the structures of BHQ are something like that of black\nholes in de Sitter space. Constructing the effective first law of\nthermodynamics in two different ways, we can derive the effective thermodynamic\nquantities of BHQ. Especially, these effective thermodynamic quantities also\nsatisfy Smarr-like formulae. It is found that the uncharged BHQ is always\nthermodynamically unstable due to negative heat capacity, while for the charged\nBHQ there are phase transitions of the second order. We also show that there is\na great deal of difference on the thermodynamic properties and critical\nbehaviors of BHQ between the two ways we employed.\n", "  Tensor network states are for good reasons believed to capture ground states\nof gapped local Hamiltonians arising in the condensed matter context, states\nwhich are in turn expected to satisfy an entanglement area law. However, the\ncomputational hardness of contracting projected entangled pair states in two\nand higher dimensional systems is often seen as a significant obstacle when\ndevising higher-dimensional variants of the density-matrix renormalisation\ngroup method. In this work, we show that for those projected entangled pair\nstates that are expected to provide good approximations of such ground states\nof local Hamiltonians, one can compute local expectation values in\nquasi-polynomial time. We therefore provide a complexity-theoretic\njustification of why state-of-the-art numerical tools work so well in practice.\nWe comment on how the transfer operators of such projected entangled pair\nstates have a gap and discuss notions of local topological quantum order. We\nfinally turn to the computation of local expectation values on quantum\ncomputers, providing a meaningful application for a small-scale quantum\ncomputer.\n", "  We show that equivariant Donaldson polynomials of compact toric surfaces can\nbe calculated as residues of suitable combinations of Virasoro conformal\nblocks, by building on AGT correspondence between N = 2 supersymmetric gauge\ntheories and two-dimensional conformal field theory.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to clarify the role of the nilpotent fermionic\ngenerator Q' introduced in Ref. [3] and appearing in the hidden supergroup\nunderlying the free differential algebra (FDA) of D=11 supergravity. We give a\nphysical explanation of its role by looking at the gauge properties of the\ntheory. We find that its presence is necessary, in order that the extra 1-forms\nof the hidden supergroup give rise to the correct gauge transformations of the\np-forms of the FDA.\n  This interpretation is actually valid for any supergravity containing\nantisymmetric tensor fields, and any supersymmetric FDA can always be traded\nfor a hidden Lie superalgebra containing extra fermionic nilpotent generators.\nAs an interesting example we construct the hidden superalgebra associated with\nthe FDA of N=2, D=7 supergravity. In this case we are able to parametrize the\nmutually non local 2- and 3-form B^(2) and B^(3) in terms of hidden 1-forms and\nfind that supersymmetry and gauge invariance require in general the presence of\ntwo nilpotent fermionic generators in the hidden algebra. We propose that our\napproach, where all the invariances of the FDA are expressed as Lie derivatives\nof the $p$-forms in the hidden supergroup manifold, could be an appropriate\nframework to discuss theories defined in enlarged versions of superspace\nrecently considered in the literature, such us double field theory and its\ngeneralizations.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to bring a mathematical justification to the optimal\nway of organizing one's effort when running. It is well known from\nphysiologists that all running exercises of duration less than 3mn are run with\na strong initial acceleration and a decelerating end; on the contrary, long\nraces are run with a final sprint. This can be explained using a mathematical\nmodel describing the evolution of the velocity, the anaerobic energy, and the\npropulsive force: a system of ordinary differential equations, based on\nNewton's second law and energy conservation, is coupled to the condition of\noptimizing the time to run a fixed distance. We show that the monotony of the\nvelocity curve vs time is the opposite of that of the oxygen uptake\n($\\dot{VO2}$) vs time. Since the oxygen uptake is monotone increasing for a\nshort run, we prove that the velocity is exponentially increasing to its\nmaximum and then decreasing. For longer races, the oxygen uptake has an\nincreasing start and a decreasing end and this accounts for the change of\nvelocity profiles. Numerical simulations are compared to timesplits from real\nraces in world championships for 100m, 400m and 800m and the curves match quite\nwell.\n", "  In geometric inequalities ADM mass plays more fundamental role than the\nconcept of quasi-local mass. This paper is to demonstrate that using the\nquasi-local mass some new insights can be acquired. In spherically symmetric\nspacetimes the Misner-Sharp mass and the concept of the Kodama vector field\nprovides an ideal setting to the investigations of geometric inequalities. We\napplying the proposed new techniques to investigate the spacetimes containing\nblack hole or cosmological horizons but we shall also apply them in context of\nnormal bodies. Most of the previous investigations applied only the quasi-local\ncharges and the area. Our main point is to include the quasi-local mass in the\ncorresponding geometrical inequalities. This way we recover some known\nrelations but new inequalities are also derived.\n", "  This article reviews static and dynamic interfacial effects in magnetism,\nfocusing on interfacially-driven magnetic effects and phenomena associated with\nspin-orbit coupling and intrinsic symmetry breaking at interfaces. It provides\na historical background and literature survey, but focuses on recent progress,\nidentifying the most exciting new scientific results and pointing to promising\nfuture research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of how\nbasic magnetic properties are affected by interfaces, then turns to a\ndiscussion of charge and spin transport through and near interfaces and how\nthese can be used to control the properties of the magnetic layer. Important\nconcepts include spin accumulation, spin currents, spin transfer torque, and\nspin pumping. An overview is provided to the current state of knowledge and\nexisting review literature on interfacial effects such as exchange bias,\nexchange spring magnets, spin Hall effect, oxide heterostructures, and\ntopological insulators. The article highlights recent discoveries of\ninterface-induced magnetism and non-collinear spin textures, non-linear\ndynamics including spin torque transfer and magnetization reversal induced by\ninterfaces, and interfacial effects in ultrafast magnetization processes.\n", "  Significant undulations appear in the light curve of a recently discovered\nsuper-luminous supernova (SLSN) SN 2015bn after the first peak, while the\nunderlying profile of the light curve can be well explained by a continuous\nenergy supply from a central engine, possibly the spin-down of a millisecond\nmagnetar. We propose that these undulations are caused by an intermittent\npulsed energy supply, indicating an energetic flare activity of the central\nengine of the SLSN. Many post-burst flares were discovered during X-ray\nafterglow observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We find that the SLSN flares\ndescribed here approximately obey the empirical correlation between the\nluminosity and time scale of GRB flares, extrapolated to the relevant longer\ntime scales of SLSN flares. This confirms the possible connection between these\ntwo different phenomena as previously suggested.\n", "  Currently, the meteor shower part of Meteor Data Center database includes:\n112 established showers, 563 in the working list, among them 36 have the pro\ntempore status. The list of shower complexes contains 25 groups, 3 have\nestablished status and 1 has the pro tempore status. In the past three years,\nnew meteor showers submitted to the MDC database were detected amongst the\nmeteors observed by CAMS stations (Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance),\nthose included in the EDMOND (European viDeo MeteOr Network Database), those\ncollected by the Japanese SonotaCo Network, recorded in the IMO (International\nMeteor Organization) database, observed by the Croatian Meteor Network and on\nthe Southern Hemisphere by the SAAMER radar. At the XXIXth General Assembly of\nthe IAU in Honolulu, Hawaii in 2015, the names of 18 showers were officially\naccepted and moved to the list of established ones. Also, one shower already\nofficially named (3/SIA the Southern iota Aquariids) was moved back to the\nworking list of meteor showers. At the XXIXth GA IAU the basic shower\nnomenclature rule was modified, the new formulation predicates \\The general\nrule is that a meteor shower (and a meteoroid stream) should be named after the\nconstellation that contains the nearest star to the radiant point, using the\npossessive Latin form\". Over the last three years the MDC database was\nsupplemented with the earlier published original data on meteor showers, which\npermitted verification of the correctness of the MDC data and extension of\nbibliographic information. Slowly but surely new database software options are\nimplemented, and software bugs are corrected.\n", "  Wavefront engineering is an important quantum technology. Here, we\ndemonstrate the design and production of a robust C-shaped and orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) carrying beam in which the doughnut shaped structure contains an\nadjustable gap. We find that the presence of the vortex line in the core of the\nbeam is crucial for the robustness of the C-shape against beam propagation. The\ntopological charge of the vortex core controls mainly the size of the C, while\nits opening angle is controlled by the presence of vortex-anti-vortex loops. We\ndemonstrate the generation and characterisation of C-shaped electron vortex\nbeams, although the result is equally applicable to other quantum waves.\nApplications of C-shaped vortex beams include lithography, dynamical atom\nsorting and atomtronics.\n", "  We investigate the radiation from a charge rotating around conductors with\ncylindrical symmetry. First the problem is considered with a charge rotating\naround a conducting cylinder immersed in a homogeneous medium. The surface\ncharge and current densities induced on the cylinder surface are evaluated. A\nformula is derived for the spectral-angular density of the radiation intensity.\nIn the second part, we study the radiation for a charge rotating around a\ndiffraction grating on a cylindrical surface with metallic strips parallel to\nthe cylinder axis. The effect of the grating on the radiation intensity is\napproximated by the surface currents induced on the strips by the field of the\nrotating charge. The expressions are derived for the electric and magnetic\nfields and for the angular density of the radiation intensity on a given\nharmonic. We show that the interference between the synchrotron and\nSmith-Purcell radiations may lead to interesting features. In particular, the\nbehavior of the radiation intensity on large harmonics can be essentially\ndifferent from that for a charge rotating in the vacuum or around a solid\ncylinder. Unlike to these limiting cases, for the geometry of diffraction\ngrating the radiation intensity on higher harmonics does not vanish for small\nangles with respect to the cylinder axis. For given characteristics of the\ncharge, by the choice of the parameters of the diffraction grating, one can\nhave highly directional radiation near the normal to the plane of the charge\nrotation. With decreasing energy, the relative contribution of the synchrotron\nradiation decreases and the Smith-Purcell part is dominant.\n", "  We measure the maximal distance at which two absorbed photons can jointly\ntrigger a detection event in NbN nanowire superconducting single photon\ndetector (SSPD) microbridges by comparing the one-photon and two-photon\nefficiency of bridges of different overall lengths, from 0 to 400 nm. We find a\nlength of $23 \\pm 2$ nm. This value is in good agreement with to size of the\nquasiparticle cloud at the time of the detection event.\n", "  We perform a tomographic baryon acoustic oscillations analysis using the\ntwo-point galaxy correlation function measured from the combined sample of BOSS\nDR12, which covers the redshift range of $0.2<z<0.75$. Splitting the sample\ninto multiple overlapping redshift slices to extract the redshift information\nof galaxy clustering, we obtain a measurement of $D_A(z)/r_d$ and $H(z)r_d$ at\nnine effective redshifts with the full covariance matrix calibrated using\nMultiDark-Patchy mock catalogues. Using the reconstructed galaxy catalogues, we\nobtain the precision of $1.3\\%-2.2\\%$ for $D_A(z)/r_d$ and $2.1\\%-6.0\\%$ for\n$H(z)r_d$. To quantify the gain from the tomographic information, we compare\nthe constraints on the cosmological parameters using our 9-bin BAO\nmeasurements, the consensus 3-bin BAO and RSD measurements at three effective\nredshifts in \\citet{Alam2016}, and the non-tomographic (1-bin) BAO measurement\nat a single effective redshift. Comparing the 9-bin with 1-bin constraint\nresult, it can improve the dark energy Figure of Merit by a factor of 1.24 for\nthe Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrisation for equation of state parameter\n$w_{\\rm DE}$. The errors of $w_0$ and $w_a$ from 9-bin constraints are slightly\nimproved when compared to the 3-bin constraint result.\n", "  This paper revisits the universal asymmetric $1 \\to 2$ quantum cloning\nproblem. We identify the symmetry properties of this optimisation problem,\ngiving us access to the optimal quantum cloning map. Furthermore, we use the\nbipolar theorem, a famous method from convex analysis, to completely\ncharacterise the set of achievable single quantum clone qualities using the\nfidelity as our figure of merit; from this it is easier to give the optimal\ncloning map and to quantify the quality tradeoff in universal asymmetric\nquantum cloning. Additionally, it allows us to analytically specify the set of\nachievable single quantum clone qualities using a range of different figures of\nmerit.\n", "  We construct a model for a particle in the framework of the theory of\nStueckelberg, Horwitz and Piron (SHP) as an ensemble of events subject to the\nlaws of covariant classical equilibrium statistical mechanics. The canonical\nand grand canonical emsembles are constructed without an a priori constraint on\nthe total mass of the system. We show that the total mass of the system,\ncorresponding to the mass of this particle, is determined by a chemical\npotential. This model has the property that under perturbation, such as\ncollisions in the SHP theory for which the final asymptotic mass of an\nelementary event is not constrained by the basic theory, the particle returns\nto its equilibrium mass value. A mechanism similar to the Maxwell construction\nfor more than one equlibrium mass state may result in several possible masses\nin the final state.\n", "  The symplectic analysis, initiated by Faddeev and Jackiw, is applied to the\nfirst order (Palatini) form of the Einstein-Hilbert action in 1 + 1 dimensions.\nThe constraints that arise are shown to result in the same gauge\ntransformations that follow from the first class constraints occurring when the\nDirac constraint formalism is applied to this action. Problems associated with\ngauge fixing are discussed.\n", "  We reconsider the fundamental commutation relations for non-commutative\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ described in polar coordinates with non-commutativity\nparameter $\\theta$. Previous analysis found that the natural transition from\nCartesian coordinates to polars led to a representation of $\\left[\\hat{r},\n\\hat{\\varphi}\\right]$ as an everywhere diverging series. We compute the Borel\nresummation of this series, showing that it can subsequently be extended\nthroughout parameter space and hence provide an interpretation of this\ncommutator. Our analysis provides a complete solution for arbitrary $r$ and\n$\\theta$ that reproduces the earlier calculations at lowest order. We compare\nour results to previous literature in the (pseudo-)commuting limit, finding a\nsurprising spatial dependence for the coordinate commutator when $\\theta \\gg\nr^{2}$. We raise some questions for future study in light of this progress.\n", "  In the present work, we consider a variety of two-component, one-dimensional\nstates in nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the presence of a parabolic trap,\ninspired by the atomic physics context of Bose-Einstein condensates. The use of\nLyapunov-Schmidt reduction methods allows us to identify persistence criteria\nfor the different families of solutions which we classify as (m,n), in\naccordance with the number of nodes in each component. Upon developing the\nexistence theory, we turn to a stability analysis of the different\nconfigurations, using the Krein signature and the Hamiltonian-Krein index as\ntopological tools identifying the number of potentially unstable\neigendirections for each branch. A systematic expansion of suitably reduced\neigenvalue problems when perturbing off of the linear limit permits us to\nobtain explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of each of the states\nconsidered. Finally, when the states are found to be unstable, typically by\nvirtue of Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations, their dynamics is studied in order to\nidentify the nature of the respective instability. The dynamics is generally\nfound to lead to a vibrational evolution over long time scales.\n", "  We study the static equilibria of a simplified Leslie--Ericksen model for a\nunidirectional uniaxial nematic flow in a prototype microfluidic channel, as a\nfunction of the pressure gradient $\\mathcal{G}$ and inverse anchoring strength,\n$\\mathcal{B}$. We numerically find multiple static equilibria for admissible\npairs $(\\mathcal{G}, \\mathcal{B})$ and classify them according to their winding\nnumbers and stability. The case $\\mathcal{G}=0$ is analytically tractable and\nwe numerically study how the solution landscape is transformed as $\\mathcal{G}$\nincreases. We study the one-dimensional dynamical model, the sensitivity of the\ndynamic solutions to initial conditions and the rate of change of $\\mathcal{G}$\nand $\\mathcal{B}$. We provide a physically interesting example of how the time\ndelay between the applications of $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ can determine\nthe selection of the final steady state.\n", "  Effects of wave-wave interactions on ocean swell are studied. Results of\nextensive simulations of swell evolution within the duration-limited setup for\nthe kinetic Hasselmann equation at long times up to $10^6$ seconds are\npresented. Basic solutions of the theory of weak turbulence, the so-called\nKolmogorov-Zakharov solutions, are shown to be relevant to the results of the\nsimulations. Features of self-similarity of wave spectra are detailed and their\nimpact on methods of ocean swell monitoring are discussed. Essential drop of\nwave energy (wave height) due to wave-wave interactions is found to be\npronounced at initial stages of swell evolution (of order of 1000 km for\ntypical parameters of the ocean swell). At longer times wave-wave interactions\nare responsible for a universal angular distribution of wave spectra in a wide\nrange of initial conditions.\n", "  Consistent theories of hydrodynamics necessarily include nonhydrodynamic\nmodes, which can be viewed as a regulator necessary to ensure causality. Under\nmany circumstances the choice of regulator is not relevant, but this is not\nalways the case. In particular, for sufficiently small systems (such as those\narising in pA or pp collisions) such dependence may be inevitable. We address\nthis issue in the context of the modern version of M\\\"uller-Israel-Stewart\ntheory of relativistic hydrodynamics. In this case, by demanding that the\nnonhydrodynamic modes be subdominant, we find that regulator dependence becomes\ninevitable only for multiplicities $dN/dY$ of the order of a few. This\nconclusion supports earlier studies based on hydrodynamic simulations of small\nsystems, at the same time providing a simple physical picture of how\nhydrodynamics can be reliable even in such seemingly extreme conditions.\n", "  Baryon and lepton numbers being accidental global symmetries of the Standard\nModel (SM), it is natural to promote them to local symmetries. However, to\npreserve anomaly freedom, only combinations of B-L are viable. In this spirit,\nwe investigate possible dark matter realizations in the context of the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ model: (i) Dirac fermion with unbroken B-L; (ii) Dirac fermion\nwith broken B-L; (iii) scalar dark matter; (iv) two component dark matter. We\ncompute the relic abundance, direct and indirect detection observables and\nconfront them with recent results from Planck, LUX-2016, and Fermi-LAT and\nprospects from XENON1T. In addition to the well known LEP bound\n$M_{Z^{\\prime}}/g_{BL} \\gtrsim 7$ TeV, we include often ignored LHC bounds\nusing 13 TeV dilepton (dimuon+dielectron) data at next-to-leading order plus\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We show that, for gauge couplings smaller\nthan $0.4$, the LHC gives rise to the strongest collider limit. In particular,\nwe find $M_{Z^{\\prime}}/g_{BL} > 8.7$ TeV for $g_{BL}=0.3$. We conclude that\nthe NLO+NLL corrections improve the dilepton bounds on the $Z^{\\prime}$ mass\nand that both dark matter candidates are only viable in the $Z^{\\prime}$\nresonance region, with the parameter space for scalar dark matter being fully\nprobed by XENON1T. Lastly, we show that one can successfully have a minimal two\ncomponent dark matter model.\n", "  In the global framework of finding an axiomatic derivation of nonequilibrium\nStatistical Mechanics from fundamental principles, such as the maximum path\nentropy -- also known as Maximum Caliber principle -- , this work proposes an\nalternative derivation of the well-known Jarzynski equality, a nonequilibrium\nidentity of great importance today due to its applications to irreversible\nprocesses: biological systems (protein folding), mechanical systems, among\nothers. This equality relates the free energy differences between two\nequilibrium thermodynamic states with the work performed when going between\nthose states, through an average over a path ensemble.\n  In this work the analysis of Jarzynski's equality will be performed using the\nformalism of inference over path space. This derivation highlights the wide\ngenerality of Jarzynski's original result, which could even be used in\nnon-thermodynamical settings such as social systems, financial and ecological\nsystems.\n", "  We investigate small geometric configurations that furnish observable-based\nproofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. Assuming that each context consists of\nthe same number of observables and each observable is shared by two contexts,\nit is proved that the most economical proofs are the famous Mermin-Peres square\nand the Mermin pentagram featuring, respectively, $9$ and $10$ observables,\nthere being no proofs using less than $9$ observables. We also propose a new\nproof with $14$ observables forming a `magic' heptagram. On the other hand,\nsome other prominent small-size finite geometries, like the Pasch configuration\nand the prism, are shown not to be contextual.\n", "  The semiclassical long-time limit of free evolution of quantum wave packets\non the torus is under consideration. Despite of simplicity of this system,\nthere are still open questions concerning the detailed description of the\nevolution on time scales beyond the Ehrenfest time. One of the approaches is\nbased on the limiting Wigner or Husimi distributions of time-evolved wave\npackets as the Planck constant tends to zero and time tends to infinity. We\nderive explicit expressions for semiclassical measures corresponding to all\ntime scales and the corresponding stages of evolution: classical-like motion,\nspreading of the wave packet, and its revivals. Also we discuss limitations of\nthe approach based on semiclassical measures and suggest its generalization.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the role of the current loop in the generation\nof second and third harmonic signals from magnetic metamaterials. We will show\nthat the fact that the current loop in the magnetic resonance acts as a source\nfor nonlinear effects and it consists of two orthogonal parts, leads to the\ngeneration of two harmonic signals in two orthogonal polarizations.\n", "  The closure constraint is a central piece of the mathematics of loop quantum\ngravity. It encodes the gauge invariance of the spin network states of quantum\ngeometry and provides them with a geometrical interpretation: each decorated\nvertex of a spin network is dual to a quantized polyhedron in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nFor instance, a 4-valent vertex is interpreted as a tetrahedron determined by\nthe four normal vectors of its faces. We develop a framework where the closure\nconstraint is re-interpreted as a Bianchi identity, with the normals defined as\nholonomies around the polyhedron faces of a connection (constructed from the\nspinning geometry interpretation of twisted geometries). This allows us to\ndefine closure constraints for hyperbolic tetrahedra (living in the\n3-hyperboloid of unit future-oriented spacelike vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$)\nin terms of normals living all in $SU(2)$ or in $SB(2,\\mathbb{C})$. The latter\nfits perfectly with the classical phase space developed for $q$-deformed loop\nquantum gravity supposed to account for a non-vanishing cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda>0$. This is the first step towards interpreting $q$-deformed twisted\ngeometries as actual discrete hyperbolic triangulations.\n", "  We present an extension of the ergodic, mixing and Bernoulli levels of the\nergodic hierarchy in dynamical systems, the information geometric ergodic\nhierarchy (IGEH), making use of statistical models on curved manifolds in the\ncontext of information geometry. We discuss the $2\\times 2$ Gaussian Orthogonal\nEnsembles (GOE) within a $2D$ correlated model. For $r$ vanishingly small, we\nfind that GOE belong to the information geometric (IG) mixing level having a\nmaximum negative value of scalar curvature. Moreover, we propose a measure of\ndistinguishability for the family of distributions of the $2D$ correlated model\nthat results to be an upper bound of the IG correlation.\n", "  The Fisher matrix is a widely used tool to forecast the performance of future\nexperiments and approximate the likelihood of large data sets. Most of the\nforecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering studies rely on the\nFisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments like DES, Euclid, or SKA.\nHere we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects:\nthe finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the\nuncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in\nthe limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible\nfor infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects\nand what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment will be. The main\nresult of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation\ninduce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30%\nfor most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be\nneglected for bins smaller than $\\Delta z = 0.1$ roughly.\n", "  Using the concept of apparent horizon for dynamical black holes, we revisit\nthe formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe for both\nlinear and non-linear regimes. First, we develop the perturbation theory for\nspherically symmetric spacetimes to study the formation of spherical PBHs in\nlinear regime and we fix two gauges. We also introduce a well defined gauge\ninvariant quantity for the expansion. Using this quantity, we argue that PBHs\ndo not form in the linear regime. Finally, we study the non-linear regime. We\nadopt the spherical collapse picture by taking a closed FRW model in the\nradiation dominated era to investigate PBH formation. Taking the initial\ncondition of the spherical collapse from the linear theory of perturbations, we\nallow for both density and velocity perturbations. Our model gives a constraint\non the velocity perturbation. This model also predicts that the apparent\nhorizon of PBHs forms when $\\delta > 3$. Applying the sound horizon constraint,\nwe have shown the threshold value of density perturbations at horizon re-entry\nmust be larger than $\\delta_{th} > 0.7$ to overcome the pressure gradients.\n", "  We study electric field and temperature gradient driven magnetoconductivity\nof a Weyl semimetal system. To analyze the responses, we utilize the kinetic\nequation with semiclassical equations of motion modified by the Berry curvature\nand orbital magnetization of the wave-packet. Apart from known positive\nquadratic magnetoconductivity, we show that due to chiral anomaly, the\nmagnetconductivity can become non-analytic function of the magnetic field,\nproportional to 3/2 power of the magnetic field at finite temperatures. We also\nshow that time-reversal symmetry breaking tilt of the Dirac cones results in\nlinear magnetoconductivity. This is due to one-dimensional chiral anomaly the\ntilt is responsible for.\n", "  In high-energy collisions the number of the created particles is far less\nthan the thermodynamic limit, especially in small colliding systems (e.g.\nproton-proton). Therefore final-state effects and fluctuations in the\none-particle energy distribution are appreciable. As a consequence the\ncharacterization of identified hadron spectra with the Boltzmann\\,--\\,Gibbs\nthermodynamical approach is insufficient. Instead particle spectra measured in\nhigh-energy collisions can be described very well with Tsallis\\,--\\,Pareto\ndistributions, derived from non-extensive thermodynamics. Using the Tsallis\nq-entropy formula, a generalization of the Boltzmann\\,--\\,Gibbs entropy, we\ninterpret the microscopical physics by analysing the Tsallis $q$ and $T$\nparameters. In this paper we give a quick overview on these parameters,\nanalyzing identified hadron spectra from recent years in a wide center of mass\nenergy range. We demonstrate that the fitted Tsallis-parameters show dependency\non this energy and on the particle species. Our findings are described well by\na QCD inspired evolution ansatz.\n", "  The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for\nseveral decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and\nreoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the\ndynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.\n", "  Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) full-sky temperature data show a\nhemispherical asymmetry in power nearly aligned with the Ecliptic. In real\nspace, this anomaly can be quantified by the temperature variance in the\nnorthern and southern Ecliptic hemispheres. In this context, the northern\nhemisphere displays an anomalously low variance while the southern hemisphere\nappears unremarkable (consistent with expectations from the best-fitting\ntheory, $\\Lambda$CDM). While this is a well established result in temperature,\nthe low signal-to-noise ratio in current polarization data prevents a similar\ncomparison. This will change with a proposed ground-based CMB experiment,\nCMB-S4. With that in mind, we generate realizations of polarization maps\nconstrained by the temperature data and predict the distribution of the\nhemispherical variance in polarization considering two different sky coverage\nscenarios possible in CMB-S4: full Ecliptic north coverage and just the portion\nof the North that can be observed from a ground based telescope at the high\nChilean Atacama plateau. We find that even in the set of realizations\nconstrained by the temperature data, the low northern hemisphere variance\nobserved in temperature is not expected in polarization. Therefore, an\nanomalously low variance detection in polarization would provide strong\nevidence against the hypothesis that the temperature anomaly is simply a\nstatistical fluke. We show, within $\\Lambda$CDM, how variance measurements in\nboth sky coverage scenarios are related. We find that the variance makes for a\ngood statistic in cases where the sky coverage is limited, however a full\nnorthern coverage is still preferable.\n", "  Lattice field theory is a non-perturbative tool for studying properties of\nstrongly interacting field theories, which is particularly amenable to\nnumerical calculations and has quantifiable systematic errors. In these\nlectures we apply these techniques to nuclear Effective Field Theory (EFT), a\nnon-relativistic theory for nuclei involving the nucleons as the basic degrees\nof freedom. The lattice formulation of [1,2] for so-called pionless EFT is\ndiscussed in detail, with portions of code included to aid the reader in code\ndevelopment. Systematic and statistical uncertainties of these methods are\ndiscussed at length, and extensions beyond pionless EFT are introduced in the\nfinal Section.\n", "  The governing equation for elastic waves in flexural plates is not form\ninvariant, and hence designing a cloak for such waves faces a major challenge.\nHere, we present the design of a perfect broadband cloak for flexural waves\nthrough the use of a nonlinear transformation, and by matching term-by-term the\noriginal and transformed equations. For a readily achievable flexural cloak in\na physical setting, we further present an approximate adoption of our perfect\ncloak under more restrictive physical constraints. Through direct simulation of\nthe governing equations, we show that this cloak, as well, maintains a\nconsistently high cloaking efficiency over a broad range of frequencies. The\nmethodology developed here may be used for steering waves and designing cloaks\nin other physical systems with non form-invariant governing equations.\n", "  We report the effect of lipid head-group dipole orientation on phase\nbehaviour of phospholipid assembly. The work explains molecular-scale mechanism\nof ion-lipid, anesthetic-lipid interactions where reorientation of dipoles play\nimportant role in membrane potential modification. Molecular Dynamics\nsimulations are performed to analyse structure-property relationship and\ndynamical behaviour of lipid biomembranes considering coarse-grained model\ninteractions.\n", "  Modular covariance of torus one-point functions constrains the three point\nfunction coefficients of a two dimensional CFT. This leads to an asymptotic\nformula for the average value of light-heavy-heavy three point coefficients,\ngeneralizing Cardy's formula for the high energy density of states. The\nderivation uses certain asymptotic properties of one-point conformal blocks on\nthe torus. Our asymptotic formula matches a dual AdS_3 computation of one point\nfunctions in a black hole background. This is evidence that the BTZ black hole\ngeometry emerges upon course-graining over a suitable family of heavy\nmicrostates.\n", "  We investigate the strongly interacting hard-core anyon gases in a one\ndimensional harmonic potential at finite temperature by extending thermal\nBose-Fermi mapping method to thermal anyon-ferimon mapping method. With thermal\nanyon-fermion mapping method we obtain the reduced one-body density matrix and\ntherefore the momentum distribution for different statistical parameters and\ntemperatures. At low temperature hard-core anyon gases exhibit the similar\nproperties as those of ground state, which interpolate between Bose-like and\nFermi-like continuously with the evolution of statistical properties. At high\ntemperature hard-core anyon gases of different statistical properties display\nthe same reduced one-body density matrix and momentum distribution as those of\nspin-polarized fermions. The Tan's contact of hard-core anyon gas at finite\ntemperature is also evaluated, which take the simple relation with that of\nTonks-Girardeau gas $C_b$ as $C=\\frac12(1-cos\\chi\\pi)C_b$.\n", "  We investigate information flow and Page curves for tripartite systems. We\nprepare a tripartite system (say, A, B, and C) of a given number of states and\ncalculate information and entropy contents by assuming random states.\nInitially, every particle was in A (this means a black hole), and as time goes\non, particles move to either B (means Hawking radiation) or C (means a broadly\ndefined remnant, including a non-local transport of information, the last\nburst, an interior large volume, or a bubble universe, etc.). If the final\nnumber of states of the remnant is smaller than that of Hawking radiation, then\ninformation will be stored by both of the radiation and the mutual information\nbetween the radiation and the remnant, while the remnant itself does not\ncontain information. On the other hand, if the final number of states of the\nremnant is greater than that of Hawking radiation, then the radiation contains\nnegligible information, while the remnant and the mutual information between\nthe radiation and the remnant contain information. Unless the number of states\nof the remnant is large enough compared to the entropy of the black hole,\nHawking radiation must contain information; and we meet the menace of black\nhole complementarity again. Therefore, this contrasts the tension between\nvarious assumptions and candidates of the resolution of the information loss\nproblem.\n", "  The Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) is a high energy, wide-field imaging\ninstrument on AstroSat. CZT's namesake Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors cover\nan energy range from 20 keV to > 200 keV, with 11% energy resolution at 60 keV.\nThe coded aperture mask attains an angular resolution of 17' over a 4.6 deg x\n4.6 deg (FWHM) field of view. CZTI functions as an open detector above 100 keV,\ncontinuously sensitive to GRBs and other transients in about 30% of the sky.\nThe pixellated detectors are sensitive to polarisation above ~100 keV, with\nexciting possibilities for polarisation studies of transients and bright\npersistent sources. In this paper, we provide details of the complete CZTI\ninstrument, detectors, coded aperture mask, mechanical and electronic\nconfiguration, as well as data and products.\n", "  The densities passed through for neutrinos going from Fermilab to Sanford lab\nare obtained using two recent density tables, crustal [1] and\nShen-Ritzwoller[2], as well as the values from an older table PEMC[3].\n", "  Historically, materials discovery has been driven by a laborious\ntrial-and-error process. The growth of materials databases and emerging\ninformatics approaches finally offer the opportunity to transform this practice\ninto data- and knowledge-driven rational design. By using data from the AFLOW\nrepository for high-throughput ab-initio calculations, we have generated\nQuantitative Materials Structure-Property Relationship (QMSPR) models to\npredict eight critical electronic and thermomechanical materials properties,\nsuch as the metal/insulator classification, band gap energy, bulk and shear\nmoduli, Debye temperature, and heat capacity. The prediction accuracy obtained\nwith these QMSPR models approaches training data for virtually any\nstoichiometric inorganic crystalline material. The success and universality of\nthese models is attributed to the construction of new materials\ndescriptors---referred to as the universal Property-Labeled Materials Fragments\n(PLMF). The representation requires only minimal structural input and affords\nstraightforward model interpretation in terms of simple heuristic design rules\nthat guide rational materials design. This study demonstrates the power of\nmaterials informatics to dramatically accelerate the search for new materials.\n", "  We show that a new type of two-body interaction, which depends on the\nmomentum of the center of mass (CoM) of these two particles, can be realized in\nultracold atom gases with a laser-modulaed magnetic Feshbach resonance (MFR).\nHere the MFR is modulated by two laser beams propagating along different\ndirections, which can induce Raman transition between two-body bound states.\nThe Doppler effect causes the two-atom scattering length to be strongly\ndependent on the CoM momentum of these two atoms. As a result, the effective\ntwo-atom interaction is CoM-momentum dependent, while the one-atom free\nHamiltonian is still the simple kinetic energy ${\\bf p}^2/(2m)$.\n", "  Using first-principles pseudopotential method and Boltzmann transport theory,\nwe give a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and phonon transport\nproperties of thermoelectric material BiCuSeO. By choosing proper hybrid\nfunctional for the exchange-correlation energy, we find that the system is\nsemiconducting with a direct band gap of ~0.8 eV, which is quite different from\nthose obtained previously using standard functionals. Detailed analysis of a\nthree-dimensional energy band structure indicates that there is a valley\ndegeneracy of eight around the valence band maximum, which leads to a sharp\ndensity of states and is responsible for a large p-type Seebeck coefficient.\nMoreover, we find that the density of states effective masses are much larger\nand results in very low hole mobility of BiCuSeO. On the other hand, we find\nlarger atomic displacement parameters for the Cu atoms, which indicates that\nthe stronger anharmonicity of BiCuSeO may originate from the rattling behavior\nof Cu instead of previously believed Bi atoms.\n", "  The development of a set of high-order accurate finite-volume formulations\nfor evaluation of the pressure gradient force in layered ocean models is\ndescribed. A pair of new schemes are presented, both based on an integration of\nthe contact pressure force about the perimeter of an associated momentum\ncontrol-volume. The two proposed methods differ in their choice of\ncontrol-volume geometries. High-order accurate numerical integration techniques\nare employed in both schemes to account for non-linearities in the underlying\nequation-of-state definitions and thermodynamic profiles, and details of an\nassociated vertical interpolation and quadrature scheme are discussed in\ndetail. Numerical experiments are used to confirm the consistency of the two\nformulations, and it is demonstrated that the new methods maintain hydrostatic\nand thermobaric equilibrium in the presence of strongly-sloping layer-wise\ngeometry, non-linear equation-of-state definitions and non-uniform vertical\nstratification profiles. Additionally, one scheme is shown to maintain high\nlevels of consistency in the presence of non-linear thermodynamic\nstratification. Use of the new pressure gradient force formulations for hybrid\nvertical coordinate and/or terrain-following general circulation models is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Observational evidence shows that low-redshift galaxies are surrounded by\nextended haloes of multiphase gas, the so-called 'circumgalactic medium' (CGM).\nTo study the survival of relatively cool gas (T < 10^5 K) in the CGM, we\nperformed a set of hydrodynamical simulations of cold (T = 10^4 K) neutral gas\nclouds travelling through a hot (T = 2x10^6 K) and low-density (n = 10^-4\ncm^-3) coronal medium, typical of Milky Way-like galaxies at large\ngalactocentric distances (~ 50-150 kpc). We explored the effects of different\ninitial values of relative velocity and radius of the clouds. Our simulations\nwere performed on a two-dimensional grid with constant mesh size (2 pc) and\nthey include radiative cooling, photoionization heating and thermal conduction.\nWe found that for large clouds (radii larger than 250 pc) the cool gas survives\nfor very long time (larger than 250 Myr): despite that they are partially\ndestroyed and fragmented into smaller cloudlets during their trajectory, the\ntotal mass of cool gas decreases at very low rates. We found that thermal\nconduction plays a significant role: its effect is to hinder formation of\nhydrodynamical instabilities at the cloud-corona interface, keeping the cloud\ncompact and therefore more difficult to destroy. The distribution of column\ndensities extracted from our simulations are compatible with those observed for\nlow-temperature ions (e.g. SiII and SiIII) and for high-temperature ions (OVI)\nonce we take into account that OVI covers much more extended regions than the\ncool gas and, therefore, it is more likely to be detected along a generic line\nof sight.\n", "  Charged Particle Monitor (CPM) on-board the AstroSat satellite is an\ninstrument designed to detect the flux of charged particles at the satellite\nlocation. A Cesium Iodide Thallium (CsI(Tl)) crystal is used with a Kapton\nwindow to detect protons with energies greater than 1 MeV. The ground\ncalibration of CPM was done using gamma-rays from radioactive sources and\nprotons from particle accelerators. Based on the ground calibration results,\nenergy deposition above 1 MeV are accepted and particle counts are recorded. It\nis found that CPM counts are steady and the signal for the onset and exit of\nSouth Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region are generated in a very reliable and stable\nmanner.\n", "  The stress-strain anisotropy -including both elastic properties and\ndislocation distributions- of crystalline systems can be studied using a\ndislocation model proposed by Ung\\'ar and Borb\\'ely. However this model\nrequires fundamental parameters (i.e., contrast factors), which take into\naccount both the elastic properties and symmetry for each system. In this\nstudy, such contrast factors were calculated from first principles for cubic\nslip-systems through the evaluation of the distortion tensor in a\ndislocation-dependent coordinate set. Moreover, a straightforward expression\nfor the computation of contrast factors is provided. Further analysis of the\nmicrostructural parameters was carried out using the modified Williamson-Hall\nmethod to characterize rock-salt materials.\n", "  We approach wave particle duality, the role of the observer and implications\non Retrocausality, by starting with the results of a well verified quantum\nexperiment. We analyze how some current theoretical approaches interpret these\nresults. We then provide an alternative theoretical framework that is\nconsistent with the observations and in many ways simpler than usual attempts\nto account for retrocausality, involving a non-local conscious Observer.\n", "  Tensor Minkowski Functionals (TMFs) are tensorial generalizations of the\nusual Minkowski Functionals which are scalar quantities. We introduce them here\nfor use in cosmological analysis, in particular to analyze CMB maps. They\nencapsulate information about the shapes and the orientation of structures. We\nfocus on one of the TMFs, namely $W_2^{1,1}$, which is the generalization of\nthe genus. The ratio of the eigenvalues of the average of $W_2^{1,1}$ over all\nstructures, $\\alpha$, encodes the net orientation; and the average of the\nratios of the eigenvalues of $W_2^{1,1}$ for each structure, $\\beta$, encodes\nthe net anisotropy. We have developed a code that computes $W_2^{1,1}$, and\nfrom it $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, for a set of structures on the plane. We compute\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as functions of threshold levels for simulated Gaussian\nand isotropic CMB fields. We obtain $\\alpha$ to be one for both temperature and\n$E$ mode, which means that we recover the input statistical isotropy of density\nfluctuations in the simulations. The level of net anisotropy of hotspots and\ncoldspots in the CMB fields is quantified by $\\beta\\sim 0.62$. Then we compute\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for data from PLANCK. We find that the temperature field\nagrees with the standard LCDM prediction of no net orientation within\n$3-\\sigma$. However, we find that $E$ mode data shows a net orientation that\ndeviates from the theoretical expectation at $14-\\sigma$. The possible origin\nof this deviation may be instrumental effects or other sources and needs to be\ninvestigated further. For the net anisotropy we obtain values of $\\beta$ for\nboth temperature and $E$ mode that are consistent with the expectations from\nthe standard LCDM simulations. Accurate measurements of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\ncan be used to test the standard model of cosmology and to search for\ndeviations from it.\n", "  We calculate the electron recombination rates with target ions W$^{q+}$, $q =\n18$ -- $25$, as functions of electron energy and electron temperature (i.e. the\nrates integrated over the Maxwellian velocity distribution). Comparison with\navailable experimental data for W$^{18+}$, W$^{19+}$, and W$^{20+}$ is used as\na test of our calculations. Our predictions for W$^{21+}$, W$^{22+}$,\nW$^{23+}$, W$^{24+}$, and W$^{25+}$ (where the experimental data are not\navailable) may be used for plasma modelling in thermonuclear reactors. The\nresults for the temperature dependent rates for each ion are fitted with the\nstandard analytical expressions to make them easy to use. All of these ions\nhave an open electron $f$-shell and have an extremely dense spectrum of chaotic\nmany-electron compound resonances which enhance the recombination rates by 2-3\norders of magnitude in comparison with the direct electron recombination.\nConventional dielectronic recombination theory is not directly applicable in\nthis case. Instead, we developed a statistical theory based on the properties\nof chaotic eigenstates. This theory describes a multi-electronic recombination\n(extension of the dielectronic recombination) via many-excited-electron\ncompound resonances.\n", "  The interpretation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe necessitates the\nCP violation beyond the Standard Model (SM). We present a general cancellation\nmechanism in the theoretical predictions of the electron electric dipole\nmoments (EDM), quark chromo-EDMs, and Weinberg operators. A relative large CP\nviolation in the Higgs sector is allowed by the current electron EDM constraint\nreleased by the ACME collaboration in 2013, and the recent $^{199}$Hg EDM\nexperiment. The cancellation mechanism can be induced by the mass splitting of\nheavy Higgs bosons around $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(0.1-1)$ GeV, and the extent of the\nmass degeneracy determines the magnitude of the CP-violating phase. We\nexplicate this point by investigating the CP-violating two-Higgs-doublet model\nand the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. The cancellation mechanism is\ngeneral when there are CP violation and mixing in the Higgs sector of new\nphysics models. The CP-violating phases in this scenario can be excluded or\ndetected by the projected $^{225}$Ra EDM experiments with precision reaching\n$\\sim10^{-28}\\,e\\cdot{\\rm cm}$, as well as the future colliders.\n", "  We introduce a new coupled mode theory to model nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations for contra- propagating Bloch modes that include disorder-induced\nmultiple scattering effects on nonlinear soliton propagation in photonic\ncrystal waveguides. We also derive sub unit-cell coupling coefficients and use\nthese to introduce a generalized length scale associated with each coupling\neffect. In particular, we define a multiple-scattering length scale that\nquantifies the spatial extent of a disorder- induced cavity mode. Our numerical\nsimulations of nonlinear pulse propagation are in excellent qualitative\nagreement with recent experiments and provide insight into how disorder\ninhibits soliton propagation and other nonlinear propagation effects in\nphotonic crystal waveguides.\n", "  Massive neutrinos leave a unique signature in the large scale clustering of\nmatter. We investigate the wavenumber dependence of the growth factor arising\nfrom neutrino masses and use a Fisher analysis to determine the aspects of a\ngalaxy survey needed to measure this scale dependence.\n", "  By arguing that the surface pressure field over the Arctic Ocean can be\ntreated as an isotropic, stationary, homogeneous, Gaussian random field,\nThorndike estimated a number of covariance functions from two years of data\n(1979 and 1980). Given the active interest in changes of general circulation\nquantities and indices in the polar regions during the recent few decades, the\nspatial correlations in sea ice velocity fields are of particular interest. It\nis thus natural to ask; \"how persistent are these correlations?\" To this end, a\nmulti-fractal stochastic treatment is developed to analyze observed Arctic sea\nice velocity fields from satellites and buoys for the period 1978 - 2015.\nHaving previously found that the Arctic Equivalent Ice Extent (EIE) has a white\nnoise structure on annual to bi-annual time scales, the connection between EIE\nand ice motion is assessed. The long-term stationarity of the spatial\ncorrelation structure of the velocity fields, and the robustness of their white\nnoise structure on multiple time scales is demonstrated, which (a) combine to\nexplain the white noise characteristics of the EIE on annual to biannual time\nscales, and (b) explain why the fluctuations in the ice velocity are\nproportional to fluctuations in the geostrophic winds on time scales of days to\nmonths. Moreover, it is shown that the statistical structure of these two\nquantities is commensurate from days up to years, which may be related to the\nincreasing prevalence of free drift in the ice pack.\n", "  The photon wave equation proposed in terms of the Riemann-Silberstein vector\nis derived from a first-order Dirac/Weyl-type action principle. It is symmetric\nw.r.t. duality transformations, but the associated Noether quantity vanishes.\nReplacing the fields by potentials and using instead a quadratic\nKlein-Gordon-type Lagrangian allows us to recover the double-Chern-Simons\nexpression of conserved helicity and is shown to be equivalent to recently\nproposed alternative frameworks. Applied to the potential-modified theory the\nDirac/Weyl-type approach yields again zero conserved charge, whereas the\nKlein-Gordon-type approach applied to the original setting yields Lipkin's\n\"zilch\".\n", "  We have performed the observation of the \"Galactic Center Mini-spiral(GCMS)\"\nin H42alpha recombination line as a part of the first large-scale mosaic\nobservation in the Sagittarius A complex using Atacama\nMillimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). We revealed the kinematics of the\nionized gas streamers of the GCMS. We found that the ionized gas streamers of\nthe Northern Arm(NA) and Eastern Arm(EA) in their outer regions somewhat\ndeviate from the Keplerian orbits which were derived previously from the\ntrajectories in the inner regions. In addition, we found that the streamer\ncorresponding to the Bar of the GCMS has a Keplerian orbit with an eccentricity\nof e~0.8, which is independent from the Keplerian orbits of the other streamers\nof the GCMS. We estimated the LTE electron temperature and electron density in\nthe ionized gas streamers. We confirmed the previously claimed tendency that\nthe electron temperatures increase toward Sgr A*. We found that the electron\ndensity in the NA and EA also increases with approaching Sgr A* without the\nlateral expansion of the gas streamers. This suggests that there is some\nexternal pressure around the GCMS. The ambient ionized gas may cause the\nconfinement and/or the perturbation for the orbits. There is a good positional\ncorrelation between the protostar candidates detected by JVLA at 34 GHz and the\nionized gas streamer, Northeastern Arm, newly found by our H42alpha\nrecombination line observation. This suggests that the candidates had formed in\nthe streamer and they were brought to near Sgr A* as the streamer falls.\n", "  We begin with a brief overview of lattice calculations using chiral effective\nfield theory and some recent applications. We then describe several methods for\ncomputing scattering on the lattice. After that we focus on the main goal,\nexplaining the theory and algorithms relevant to lattice simulations of nuclear\nfew- and many-body systems. We discuss the exact equivalence of four different\nlattice formalisms, the Grassmann path integral, transfer matrix operator,\nGrassmann path integral with auxiliary fields, and transfer matrix operator\nwith auxiliary fields. Along with our analysis we include several coding\nexamples and a number of exercises for the calculations of few- and many-body\nsystems at leading order in chiral effective field theory.\n", "  We study the self-propulsion of spherical droplets as simplified hydrodynamic\nmodels of swimming microorganisms or artificial microswimmers. In contrast to\napproaches, which start from active velocity fields produced by the system, we\nconsider active surface force or body force densities or active stresses as the\norigin of autonomous swimming. For negligible Reynolds number and given\nactivity we first calculate the external and the internal ow fields as well as\nthe center of mass velocity and an angular velocity of the droplet at fixed\ntime. To construct trajectories from single time snapshots, the evolution of\nactive forces or stresses must be determined in the laboratory frame. Here, we\nconsider the case of active matter, which is carried by a continuously\ndistributed, rigid but sparse (cyto)-sceleton that is immersed in the droplet's\ninterior. We calculate examples of trajectories of a droplet and its sceleton\nfrom force densities or stresses, which may be explicitely time dependent in a\nframe fixed within the sceleton\n", "  We report on an experimental, theoretical and numerical study of slanted\nsnaking of spatially localized parametrically excited waves on the surface of a\nwater-surfactant mixture in a Hele-Shaw cell. We demonstrate experimentally the\npresence of a hysteretic transition to spatially extended parametrically\nexcited surface waves when the acceleration amplitude is varied, as well as the\npresence of spatially localized waves exhibiting slanted snaking. The latter\nextend outside the hysteresis loop. We attribute this behavior to the presence\nof a conserved quantity, the liquid volume, and introduce a universal model\nbased on symmetry arguments, which couples the wave amplitude with such a\nconserved quantity. The model captures both the observed slanted snaking and\nthe presence of localized waves outside the hysteresis loop, as demonstrated by\nnumerical integration of the model equations.\n", "  The relative timing of action potentials in neurons recorded from local\ncortical networks often shows a non-trivial dependence, which is then\nquantified by cross-correlation functions. Theoretical models emphasize that\nsuch spike train correlations are an inevitable consequence of two neurons\nbeing part of the same network and sharing some synaptic input. For non-linear\nneuron models, however, explicit correlation functions are difficult to compute\nanalytically, and perturbative methods work only for weak shared input. In\norder to treat strong correlations, we suggest here an alternative\nnon-perturbative method. Specifically, we study the case of two leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons with strong shared input. Correlation functions\nderived from simulated spike trains fit our theoretical predictions very\naccurately. Using our method, we computed the non-linear correlation transfer\nas well as correlation functions that are asymmetric due to inhomogeneous\nintrinsic parameters or unequal input.\n", "  Only in the Milky Way is it possible to conduct an experiment which uses\nstellar streams to detect low-mass dark matter subhaloes. In smooth and static\nhost potentials, tidal tails of disrupting satellites appear highly symmetric.\nHowever, perturbations from dark subhaloes, as well as from GMCs and the Milky\nWay bar, can induce density fluctuations that destroy this symmetry. Motivated\nby the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the\nPal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and\nnon-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails\ninto clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales. We detect significant bumps and\ndips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the progenitor, each\nonly a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps, $\\sim2^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim9^{\\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a gargantuan lump of debris.\nThis largest density feature results in a pronounced inter-tail asymmetry which\ncannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream according to a suite of\nsimulations we have produced. We conjecture that the sharp peaks around Pal 5\nare epicyclic overdensities, while the two dips are consistent with impacts by\nsubhaloes. Assuming an age of 3.4 Gyr for Pal 5, these two gaps would\ncorrespond to the characteristic size of gaps created by subhaloes in the mass\nrange of $10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$ and $10^7-10^8 M_\\odot$ respectively. In addition\nto dark substructure, we find that the bar of the Milky Way can plausibly\nproduce the asymmetric density seen in Pal 5 and that GMCs could cause the\nsmaller gap.\n", "  We review the developments in the past decade on holographic entanglement\nentropy, a subject that has garnered much attention owing to its potential to\nteach us about the emergence of spacetime in holography. We provide an\nintroduction to the concept of entanglement entropy in quantum field theories,\nreview the holographic proposals for computing the same, providing some\njustification for where these proposals arise from in the first two parts. The\nfinal part addresses recent developments linking entanglement and geometry. We\nprovide an overview of the various arguments and technical developments that\nteach us how to use field theory entanglement to detect geometry. Our\ndiscussion is by design eclectic; we have chosen to focus on developments that\nappear to us most promising for further insights into the holographic map.\n  This is a draft of a few chapters of a book which will appear sometime in the\nnear future, to be published by Springer. The book in addition contains a\ndiscussion of application of holographic ideas to computation of entanglement\nentropy in strongly coupled field theories, and discussion of tensor networks\nand holography, which we have chosen to exclude from the current manuscript.\n", "  Neuronal systems have been modeled by complex networks in different\ndescription levels. Recently, it has been verified that networks can\nsimultaneously exhibit one coherent and other incoherent domain, known as\nchimera states. In this work, we study the existence of chimera states in a\nnetwork considering the connectivity matrix based on the cat cerebral cortex.\nThe cerebral cortex of the cat can be separated in 65 cortical areas organised\ninto the four cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and\nfrontolimbic. We consider a network where the local dynamics is given by the\nHindmarsh-Rose model. The Hindmarsh-Rose equations are a well known model of\nneuronal activity that has been considered to simulate membrane potential in\nneuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as\nwell as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the\nexistence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of\ndesynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera\nstates with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with\ndesynchronised spikes.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of a Brownian particle under the influence of a\ntime multiplexed harmonic potential of finite width. The memory storage\nmechanism and the erasure protocol realized by time multiplexed potentials are\nutilized to experimentally realize erasure with work close to the Landauer's\nbound. We quantify the work done on the system with respect to the duty-ratio\nof time multiplexing, which also provides a handle to approach reversible\nerasures. A Langevin dynamics based simulation model is developed for the\nproposed memory bit and the erasure protocol, which guides the experimental\nrealization. The study also provides insights into transport at the micro\nscale.\n", "  While pyrite-type PtBi2 with face-centered cubic structure has been predicted\nto be a three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal, experimental study on its\nphysical properties remains absent. Here we report the angular-dependent\nmagnetoresistance (MR) measurements of PtBi2 single-crystal under high magnetic\nfields. We observed extreme large unsaturated magnetoresistance (XMR) up to\n11.2 million percent at T = 1.8 K in a magnetic field of 33 T, which surpasses\nthe previously reported Dirac materials, such as WTe2, LaSb and NbP. The\ncrystals exhibit an ultrahigh mobility and significant Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH)\nquantum oscillations with nontrivial Berry's phase. Analysis of Hall\nresistivity indicates that the XMR can be ascribed to the nearly compensated\nelectron and hole. Our experimental results associated with the ab initio\ncalculations suggest that pyrite PtBi2 is a topological semimetal candidate\nwhich might provide a platform for exploring topological materials with XMR in\nnoble metal alloys.\n", "  A binary format with lists of particle state information, for interchanging\nparticles between various Monte Carlo simulation applications, is presented.\nPortable C code for file manipulation is made available to the scientific\ncommunity, along with converters and plugins for several popular simulation\npackages.\n", "  We study turbulent flows in planar channels with unstable thermal\nstratification, using direct numerical simulations in a wide range of Reynolds\nand Rayleigh numbers and reaching flow conditions which are representative of\nasymptotic developed turbulence. The combined effect of forced and free\nconvection produces a peculiar pattern of quasi--streamwise rollers occupying\nthe full channel thickness with aspect--ratio considerably higher than unity;\nit has been observed that they have an important redistributing effect on\ntemperature and momentum. The mean values and the variances of the flow\nvariables do not appear to follow Prandtl's scaling in the flow regime near\nfree convection, except for the temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations,\nwhich are more affected by turbulent plumes. Nevertheless, we find that the\nMonin--Obukhov theory still yields a useful representation of the main flow\nfeatures. In particular, the widely used Businger--Dyer relationships provide a\nconvenient way of accounting for the bulk effects of shear and buoyancy,\nalthough individual profiles may vary widely from the alleged trends.\nSignificant deviations are found in DNS with respect to the commonly used\nparametrization of the mean velocity in the light-wind regime, which may have\nimportant practical impact in models of atmospheric dynamics. Finally, for\nmodelling purposes, we devise a set of empirical predictive formulas for the\nheat flux and friction coefficients which can be used with about $10\\%$ maximum\nerror in a wide range of flow parameters.\n", "  We study nuclear effects on the deuteron in the deep inelastic regime using\nthe newest available data analyzing their $Q^2$ dependence. We conclude that\nprecise EMC ratios for large $Q^2$ (> 30, GeV$^2$) cannot be obtained without\nconsidering these nuclear effects. For this purpose we use a scheme which\nparametrizes these effects in a simple manner and compare our results with\nother recent proposals.\n", "  We consider quasi-two-dimensional gas of electrons in a typical Si-MOSFET,\nassuming repulsive contact interaction between electrons. Magnetisation and\nsusceptibility are evaluated within the mean-field approach. Finite thickness\nof the inversion layer results in an interaction-induced electron wave function\nchange, not found in both purely two-dimensional and three-dimensional (bulk)\ncases. Taking this self-consistent change into account leads to an increased\nsusceptibility and ultimately to a ferromagnetic transition deep in the\nhigh-density metallic regime. We further find that in the paramagnetic state,\nmagnetisation increases sublinearly with increasing in-plane magnetic field. In\nthe opposite limit of low carrier densities, the effects of long-range\ninteraction become important and can be included phenomenologically via\nbandwidth renormalisation. Our treatment then suggests that with decreasing\ndensity, the metal-insulator transition is preceded by a ferromagnetic\ninstability. Results are discussed in the context of the available experimental\ndata, and arguments for the validity of our mean-field scheme are presented.\n", "  The detection of gravitational waves from the merger of binary black holes by\nthe LIGO Collaboration has opened a new window to astrophysics. With the\nsensitivities of ground based detectors in the coming years we can only detect\nthe local black hole binary mergers. The integrated merger rate can instead be\nprobed by the gravitational-wave background, the incoherent superposition of\nthe released energy in gravitational waves during binary-black-hole\ncoalescence. Through that, the properties of the binary black holes can be\nstudied. In this work we show that by measuring the energy density\n$\\Omega_{GW}$ (in units of the cosmic critical density) of the\ngravitational-wave background, we can search for the rare $\\sim 100 M_{\\odot}$\nmassive black holes formed in the Universe. In addition, we can answer how\noften the least massive BHs of mass $> 3 M_{\\odot}$ form. Finally, if there are\nmultiple channels for the formation of binary black holes and if any of them\npredicts a narrow mass range for the black holes, then the\ngravitational-wave-background spectrum may have features that with the future\nEinstein Telescope can be detected.\n", "  Let $P$ be a parabolic subgroup of a connected simply connected complex\nsemisimple Lie group $G$. Given a compact K\\\"ahler manifold $X$, the\ndimensional reduction of $G$-equivariant holomorphic vector bundles over\n$X\\times G/P$ was carried out by the first and third authors. This raises the\nquestion of dimensional reduction of holomorphic principal bundles over\n$X\\times G/P$. The method used for equivariant vector bundles does not\ngeneralize to principal bundles. In this paper, we adapt to equivariant\nprincipal bundles the Tannakian approach of Nori, to describe the dimensional\nreduction of $G$-equivariant principal bundles over $X\\times G/P$, and to\nestablish a Hitchin--Kobayashi type correspondence. In order to be able to\napply the Tannakian theory, we need to assume that $X$ is a complex projective\nmanifold.\n", "  The phase space of a compact, irreducible, simply connected, Riemannian\nsymmetric space admits a natural family of K\\\"ahler polarizations parametrized\nby the upper half plane $S$. Using this family, geometric quantization,\nincluding the half-form correction, produces the field $H^{corr}\\rightarrow S$\nof quantum Hilbert spaces. We show that projective flatness of $H^{corr}$\nimplies, that the symmetric space must be isometric to a compact Lie group\nequipped with a biinvariant metric. In the latter case the flatness of\n$H^{corr}$ was previously established.\n", "  Probability of coincidental clustering among the orbits of comets, asteroids\nand meteoroids depends on many factors like: the size of the orbital sample\nsearched for clusters or the size of the identified group, it is different for\ngroups of 2,3,4, ... members. Probability of coincidental clustering is\nassessed by the numerical simulation, therefore, it depends also on the method\nused for the synthetic orbits generation.\n  We tested the impact of some of these factors. For a given size of the\norbital sample we have assessed probability of random pairing among several\norbital populations of different sizes. We have found how these probabilities\nvary with the size of the orbital samples.\n  Finally, keeping fixed size of the orbital sample we have shown that the\nprobability of random pairing can be significantly different for the orbital\nsamples obtained by different observation techniques. Also for the user\nconvenience we have obtained several formulae which, for given size of the\norbital sample, one can use to calculate the similarity threshold corresponding\nto the small value of the probability of coincidental similarity among two\norbits.\n", "  The flourishing field of two-dimensional (2D) nanophotonics has generated\nmuch excitement in the quantum technologies community after the identification\nof quantum emitters (QEs) in layered materials (LMs). LMs offer many advantages\nas platforms for quantum circuits, such as integration within hybrid\ntechnologies, valley degree of freedom and strong spin-orbit coupling. QEs in\nLMs, however, suffer from uncontrolled occurrences, added to the uncertainty\nover their origin, which has been linked to defects and strain gradients. Here,\nwe report a scalable method to create arrays of single-photon emitting QEs in\ntungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulphide (WS2) using a nanopatterned\nsilica substrate. We obtain devices with QE numbers in the range of hundreds,\nlimited only by the flake size, and a QE yield approaching unity. The overall\nquality of these deterministic QEs surpasses that of their randomly appearing\ncounterparts, with spectral wanderings of around 0.1 meV, an order of magnitude\nlower than previous reports. Our technique solves the scalability challenge for\nLM-based quantum photonic devices.\n", "  Conventional Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology analyses currently use a\nsimplistic linear regression of magnitude versus color and light curve shape,\nwhich does not model intrinsic SN Ia variations and host galaxy dust as\nphysically distinct effects, resulting in low color-magnitude slopes. We\nconstruct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of\nextinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a\nintrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust\nreddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude ($M_B$ vs.\n$B-V$) slope $\\beta_{int}$ differs from the host galaxy dust law $R_B$, this\nconvolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude\nvs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from\n$\\beta_{int}$ in the blue tail to $R_B$ in the red tail of the apparent color\ndistribution. The conventional linear fit approximates this effective curve\nnear the average apparent color, resulting in an apparent slope $\\beta_{app}$\nbetween $\\beta_{int}$ and $R_B$. We incorporate these effects into a\nhierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and\nanalyze a dataset of SALT2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z <\n0.10. The conventional linear fit obtains $\\beta_{app} \\approx 3$. Our model\nfinds a $\\beta_{int} = 2.3 \\pm 0.3$ and a distinct dust law of $R_B = 3.8 \\pm\n0.3$, consistent with the average for Milky Way dust, while correcting a\nsystematic distance bias of $\\sim 0.10$ mag in the tails of the apparent color\ndistribution. Finally, we extend our model to examine the SN Ia luminosity-host\nmass dependence in terms of intrinsic and dust components.\n", "  We investigate combined effects of nontrivial topology, induced by a cosmic\nstring, and boundaries on the fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation\nvalue (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor for a massive fermionic field. As\ngeometry of boundaries we consider two plates perpendicular to the string axis\non which the field is constrained by the MIT bag boundary condition. By using\nthe Abel-Plana type summation formula, the VEVs in the region between the\nplates are decomposed into the boundary-free and boundary-induced contributions\nfor general case of the planar angle deficit. The boundary-induced parts in\nboth the fermionic condensate and the energy-momentum tensor vanish on the\ncosmic string. Fermionic condensate is positive near the string and negative al\nlarge distances, whereas the vacuum energy density is negative everywhere. The\nradial stress is equal to the energy density. For a massless field, the\nboundary-induced contribution in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is\ndifferent from zero in the region between the plates only and it does not\ndepend on the coordinate along the string axis. In the region between the\nplates and at large distances from the string, the decay of the topological\npart is exponential for both massive and massless fields. This behavior is in\ncontrast to that for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the boundary-free\ngeometry with the power law decay for a massless field. The vacuum pressure on\nthe plates is inhomogeneous and vanishes at the location of the string. The\ncorresponding Casimir forces are attractive.\n", "  The three-wave resonant interaction equations are a non-dispersive system of\npartial differential equations with quadratic coupling describing the time\nevolution of the complex amplitudes of three resonant wave modes. Collisions of\nwave packets induce energy transfer between different modes via pumping and\ndecay. We analyze the collision of two or three packets in the semiclassical\nlimit by applying the inverse-scattering transform. Using WKB analysis, we\nconstruct an associated semiclassical soliton ensemble, a family of\nreflectionless solutions defined through their scattering data, intended to\naccurately approximate the initial data in the semiclassical limit. The map\nfrom the initial packets to the soliton ensemble is explicit and amenable to\nasymptotic and numerical analysis. Plots of the soliton ensembles indicate the\nspace-time plane is partitioned into regions containing either quiescent,\nslowly varying, or rapidly oscillatory waves. This behavior resembles the\nwell-known generation of dispersive shock waves in equations such as the\nKorteweg-de Vries and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, although the physical\nmechanism must be different in the absence of dispersion.\n", "  Using the diagram technique for Matsubara Green's functions it is shown that\nthe dynamics of the localized spin subsystem in the s-d(f) model can be\ndescribed in terms of an effective spin model with multi-site spin-spin\ninteractions. An exact representation of the action for the effective purely\nspin model is derived as an infinite series in powers of s-d(f) exchange\ninteraction $J$. The indirect interactions of the 2-nd, 3-rd and 4-th order are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Until recently, the interaction of electromagnetic waves with crystals built\nfrom parallel metallic wires (wire media) was analyzed in the approximation of\nisotropic scattering of the electromagnetic wave by a single wire. However, if\nthe wires are thick (kR~1), electromagnetic wave scattering by a wire is\nanisotropic, i.e., the scattering amplitude depends on the scattering angle. In\nthis work, we derive the equations that describe diffraction of electromagnetic\nwaves and spontaneous emission of charged particles in wire media, and take\ninto account the angular dependence of scattering amplitude. Numerical\nsolutions of these equations show that the radiation intensity increases as the\nwire radius is increased and achieves its maximal value in the range kR~1. The\ncase when the condition kR~1 is fulfilled in the THz frequency range is\nconsidered in detail. The calculations show that the instantaneous power of\nCherenkov and parametric (quasi-Cherenkov) radiations from electron bunches in\nthe crystal can be tens--hundreds megawatts, i.e., high enough to allow\nexperimental observation as well as possible practical applications.\n", "  Scrambling of quantum information can be conveniently quantified by so called\nout-of-time-order-correlators (OTOCs), whose measurements presents a formidable\nexperimental challenge. Here we report on a method for the measurement of OTOCs\nbased on the so-called two-point measurements scheme developed in the field of\nnon-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics. The scheme is of broader applicability\nthan methods employed in current experiments and also provides a clear-cut\ninterpretation of quantum information scrambling in terms of non-equilibrium\nfluctuations of thermodynamic quantities such as work. Furthermore, we provide\na numerical example on a spin chain which highlights the utility of our\nthermodynamic approach when understanding the differences between integrable\nand ergodic behavior. We also discuss connections to some recent experiments.\n", "  A programme of worldwide, multi-wavelength electromagnetic follow-up of\nsources detected by gravitational wave detectors is in place. Following the\ndiscovery of GW150914 and GW151226, wide field imaging of their sky\nlocalisations identified a number of candidate optical counterparts which were\nthen spectrally classified. The majority of candidates were found to be\nsupernovae at redshift ranges similar to the GW events and were thereby ruled\nout as a genuine counterpart. Other candidates ruled out include AGN and solar\nsystem objects. Given the GW sources were black hole binary mergers, the lack\nof an identified electromagnetic counterpart is not surprising. However the\nobservations show that is it is possible to organise and execute a campaign\nthat can eliminate the majority of potential counterparts. Finally we note the\nexistence of a \"classification gap\" with a significant fraction of candidates\ngoing unclassified.\n", "  The internal properties of stars in the red-giant phase undergo significant\nchanges on relatively short timescales. Long near-uninterrupted high-precision\nphotometric timeseries observations from dedicated space missions such as CoRoT\nand Kepler have provided seismic inferences of the global and internal\nproperties of a large number of evolved stars, including red giants. These\ninferences are confronted with predictions from theoretical models to improve\nour understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Our knowledge and\nunderstanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these\nseismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in\nthe data. Unraveling this will further improve our understanding of stellar\nevolution. This will also have significant impact on our knowledge of the Milky\nWay Galaxy as well as on exo-planet host stars. The latter is important for our\nunderstanding of the formation and structure of planetary systems.\n", "  We study the isotropic XY chain with a transverse magnetic field acting on a\nsingle site and analyse the long time behaviour of the time-dependent state of\nthe system when a periodic perturbation drives the impurity. We find that for\nhigh frequencies the state approaches a periodic orbit synchronised with the\nforcing and provide the explicit rate of convergence to the asymptotics.\n", "  Conventional methods for computing maximum-likelihood estimators (MLE) often\nconverge slowly in practical situations, leading to a search for simplifying\nmethods that rely on additional assumptions for their validity. In this work,\nwe provide a fast and reliable algorithm for maximum likelihood reconstruction\nthat avoids this slow convergence. Our method utilizes the state-of-the-art\nconvex optimization scheme---an accelerated projected-gradient method---that\nallows one to accommodate the quantum nature of the problem in a different way\nthan in the standard methods. We demonstrate the power of our approach by\ncomparing its performance with other algorithms for n-qubit state tomography.\nIn particular, an 8-qubit situation that purportedly took weeks of computation\ntime in 2005 can now be completed in under a minute for a single set of data,\nwith far higher accuracy than previously possible. This refutes the common\nclaim that MLE reconstruction is slow, and reduces the need for alternative\nmethods that often come with difficult-to-verify assumptions. In fact, recent\nmethods assuming Gaussian statistics or relying on compressed sensing ideas are\ndemonstrably inapplicable for the situation under consideration here. Our\nalgorithm can be applied to general optimization problems over the quantum\nstate space; the philosophy of projected gradients can further be utilized for\noptimization contexts with general constraints.\n", "  We present the calculation of the leading instanton contribution to the\nscaling dimensions of twist-two operators with arbitrary spin and to their\nstructure constants in the OPE of two half-BPS operators in $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM.\nFor spin-two operators we verify that, in agreement with $\\mathcal N=4$\nsuperconformal Ward identities, the obtained expressions coincide with those\nfor the Konishi operator. For operators with high spin we find that the leading\ninstanton correction vanishes. This arises as the result of a rather involved\ncalculation and requires a better understanding.\n", "  Superpositions of macroscopically distinct quantum states, introduced in\nSchroedinger's famous Gedankenexperiment, are an epitome of quantum\n\"strangeness\" and a natural tool for determining the validity limits of quantum\nphysics. The optical incarnation of Schroedinger's cat - the superposition of\ntwo opposite-amplitude coherent states - is also the backbone of quantum\ninformation processing in the continuous-variable domain. However, existing\npreparation methods limit the amplitudes of the component coherent states by\nabout 2, which curtails the state's usefulness for fundamental and practical\napplications. Here we produce higher-amplitude optical Schroedinger's cats from\ntwo such states of lower amplitudes. The protocol consists in bringing the\ninitial states into interference on a beamsplitter and a subsequent heralding\nquadrature measurement in one of the output channels. In the experiment, we\nconvert a pair of negative squeezed Schroedinger's cat states of amplitude 1.25\nto a single positive Schroedinger's cat of amplitude 2.15 with success\nprobability of ~0.2. This amplitude is comparable to the highest values\nobtained for this state in any physical system. Our technique can be realized\nin an iterative manner, in principle allowing creation of Schroedinger's cat\nstates of arbitrarily high amplitude.\n", "  We develop the theory of Whitham type hierarchies integrable by hydrodynamic\nreductions as a theory of certain differential-geometric objects. As an\napplication we construct Gibbons-Tsarev systems associated to moduli space of\nalgebraic curves of arbitrary genus and prove that the universal Whitham\nhierarchy is integrable by hydrodynamic reductions.\n", "  Fast radio bursts can be caused by some phenomena related to 'new physics'.\nOne of the most prominent candidates of the kind are axion miniclusters which\ncan undergo conversion into photons in magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this\nshort research note this scenario is investigated and important caveats are\nexamined. First, tidal disruption of miniclusters can considerably extend the\ntime span of conversion process, making it impossible to reach necessary\n$\\mathcal{O}$(ms) level. Second, existing observations at two widely separated\nfrequencies imply that axion-related scenarios can hardly explain entirety of\nFRBs.\n", "  We study the properties of Hamiltonians defined as the generators of transfer\nmatrices in quasi- one-dimensional waveguides. For single- or multi-mode\nwaveguides obeying flux conservation and time-reversal invariance, the\nHamiltonians defined in this way are non-Hermitian, but satisfy symmetry\nproperties that have previously been identified in the literature as \"pseudo\nHermiticity\" and \"anti-PT symmetry\". We show how simple one-channel and\ntwo-channel models exhibit transitions between real, imaginary, and complex\neigenvalue pairs.\n", "  The work presents a proof of convergence of the density of energy levels to a\nGaussian distribution for a wide class of quadratic forms of Fermi operators.\nThis general result applies also to quadratic operators with disorder, e.g.,\ncontaining random coefficients. The spacing distribution of the unfolded\nspectrum is investigated numerically. For generic systems the level spacings\nbehave as the spacings in a Poisson process. Level clustering persists in\npresence of disorder.\n", "  A formulation of the linear $\\sigma$ model with derivative interactions is\nstudied. The classical theory is on-shell equivalent to the $\\sigma$ model with\nthe standard quartic Higgs potential. The mass of the scalar mode only appears\nin the quadratic part and not in the interaction vertices, unlike in the\nordinary formulation of the theory. Renormalization of the model is discussed.\nA non power-counting renormalizable extension, obeying the defining functional\nidentities of the theory, is presented. This extension is physically equivalent\nto the tree-level inclusion of a dimension six effective operator $\\partial_\\mu\n(\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi) \\partial^\\mu (\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi)$. The resulting UV\ndivergences are arranged in a perturbation series around the power-counting\nrenormalizable theory. The application of the formalism to the Standard Model\nin the presence of the dimension-six operator $\\partial_\\mu (\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi)\n\\partial^\\mu (\\Phi^\\dagger \\Phi)$ is discussed.\n", "  We present the microbalance including the microforces, the first- and\nsecond-order microstresses for the Swift--Hohenberg equation concomitantly with\ntheir constitutive equations, which are consistent with the free-energy\nimbalance. We provide an explicit form for the microstress structure for a\nfree-energy functional endowed with second-order spatial derivatives.\nAdditionally, we generalize the Swift--Hohenberg theory via a proper\nconstitutive process. Finally, we present one highly-resolved three-dimensional\nnumerical simulation to demonstrate the particular form of the resulting\nmicrostresses and their interactions in the evolution of the Swift--Hohenberg\nequation.\n", "  We introduce spatial deformations to an array of light sources and study how\nthe estimation precision of the interspacing distance, d, changes with the\nsources of light used. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) is used as the\nfigure of merit in this work to quantify the amount of information we have on\nthe estimation parameter. We derive the generator of translations, G, in d due\nto an arbitrary homogeneous deformation applied to the array. We show how the\nvariance of the generator can be used to easily consider how different\ndeformations and light sources can effect the estimation precision. The single\nparameter estimation problem is applied to the array and we report on the\noptimal state that maximises the QFI for d. Contrary to what may have been\nexpected, the higher average mode occupancies of the classical states performs\nbetter in estimating d when compared with single photon emitters (SPEs). The\noptimal entangled state is constructed from the eigenvectors of the generator\nand found to outperform all these states. We also find the existence of\nmultiple optimal estimators for the measurement of d. Our results find\napplications in evaluating stresses and strains, fracture prevention in\nmaterials expressing great sensitivities to deformations, and selecting\nfrequency distinguished quantum sources from an array of reference sources.\n", "  Recently, Tao and Mo (TM) proposed an accurate all-purpose nonempirical\nmeta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA). The exchange part was\nderived from the density matrix approximation, while the correlation part is\nbased on a modification of TPSS correlation in the low-density or\nstrong-interaction limit. To further understand this density functional, we\ncombine the TM exchange part with the original TPSS correlation and make a\ncomprehensive assessment of this combination, which we call TMTPSS functional,\non solids and solid surfaces. Our test includes 22 lattice constants and bulk\nmoduli, 30 band gaps of semiconductors, 7 cohesive energies, and surface\nexchange-correlation energies for rs ranging from 2 to 3 bohr. Our calculations\nshow that TMTPSS functional is quite competitive to the TM meta-GGA functional,\nimproving upon the nonempirical functionals LSDA, PBE GGA, and TPSS meta-GGA\nfor most properties considered. In particular, it significantly improves the\nsurface exchange-correlation energy calculation, with a mean absolute error of\nonly 1 erg/cm2.\n", "  An outstanding challenge in quantum photonics is scalability, which requires\npositioning of single quantum emitters in a deterministic fashion. Site\npositioning progress has been made in established platforms including defects\nin diamond and self-assembled quantum dots, albeit often with compromised\ncoherence and optical quality. The emergence of single quantum emitters in\nlayered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors offers new opportunities\nto construct a scalable quantum architecture. Here, using nanoscale strain\nengineering, we deterministically achieve a two-dimensional lattice of quantum\nemitters in an atomically thin semiconductor. We create point-like strain\nperturbations in mono- and bi-layer WSe2 which locally modify the band-gap,\nleading to efficient funneling of excitons towards isolated strain-tuned\nquantum emitters that exhibit high-purity single photon emission. These arrays\nof non-classical light emitters open new vistas for two-dimensional\nsemiconductors in cavity quantum electrodynamics and integrated on-chip quantum\nphotonics.\n", "  Compact binary mergers, with neutron stars or neutron star and black-hole\ncomponents, are thought to produce various electromagnetic counterparts: short\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from ultra-relativistic jets followed by broadband\nafterglow; semi-isotropic kilonova from radioactive decay of r-process\nelements; and late time radio flares; etc. If the jets from such mergers follow\na similar power-law distribution of Lorentz factors as other astrophysical jets\nthen the population of merger jets will be dominated by low-{\\Gamma} values.\nThe prompt gamma-rays associated with short GRBs would be suppressed for a\nlow-{\\Gamma} jet and the jet energy will be released as X-ray/optical/radio\ntransients when a shock forms in the ambient medium. Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we study the properties of such transients as candidate\nelectromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources detectable by\nLIGO/Virgo. Approximately 78% of merger-jets result in failed GRB with optical\npeaks 14-22 magnitude and an all-sky rate of 2-3 per year.\n", "  We test the holographic relation between the vacuum expectation values of\ngauge invariant operators in ${\\cal N} = 6$ ${\\rm U}_k(N)\\times {\\rm\nU}_{-k}(N)$ mass-deformed ABJM theory and the LLM geometries with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifold in 11-dimensional supergravity. To do that, we apply\nthe Kaluza-Klein reduction to construct a 4-dimensional gravity theory and\nimplement the holographic renormalization procedure. We obtain an exact\nholographic relation for the vacuum expectation values of the chiral primary\noperator with conformal dimension $\\Delta = 1$, which is given by $\\langle\n{\\cal O}^{(\\Delta=1)}\\rangle= N^{\\frac32} \\, f_{(\\Delta=1)}$, for large $N$ and\n$k=1$. Here factor $f_{(\\Delta)}$ is independent of $N$. Our results involve\ninfinite number of exact dual relations for all possible supersymmetric Higgs\nvacua and so provide a nontrivial test of gauge/gravity duality away from the\nconformal fixed point. We also extend our results to the case of $k\\ne 1$ for\nLLM geometries represented by rectangular-shaped Young-diagrams.\n", "  Different variants of a Bell inequality, such as CHSH and CH, are known to be\nequivalent when evaluated on nonsignaling outcome probability distributions.\nHowever, in experimental setups, the outcome probability distributions are\nestimated using a finite number of samples. Therefore the nonsignaling\nconditions are only approximately satisfied and the robustness of the violation\ndepends on the chosen inequality variant. We explain that phenomenon using the\ndecomposition of the space of outcome probability distributions under the\naction of the symmetry group of the scenario, and propose a method to optimize\nthe statistical robustness of a Bell inequality. In the process, we describe\nthe finite group composed of relabeling of parties, measurement settings and\noutcomes, and identify correspondences between the irreducible representations\nof this group and properties of outcome probability distributions such as\nnormalization, signaling or having uniform marginals.\n", "  We review the Schwinger-Keldysh, or in-in, formalism for studying quantum\ndynamics of systems out-of-equilibrium. The main motivation is to rephrase well\nknown facts in the subject in a mathematically elegant setting, by exhibiting a\nset of BRST symmetries inherent in the construction. We show how these\nfundamental symmetries can be made manifest by working in a superspace\nformalism. We argue that this rephrasing is extremely efficacious in\nunderstanding low energy dynamics following the usual renormalization group\napproach, for the BRST symmetries are robust under integrating out degrees of\nfreedom. In addition we discuss potential generalizations of the formalism that\nallow us to compute out-of-time-order correlation functions that have been the\nfocus of recent attention in the context of chaos and scrambling. We also\noutline a set of problems ranging from stochastic dynamics, hydrodynamics,\ndynamics of entanglement in QFTs, and the physics of black holes and cosmology,\nwhere we believe this framework could play a crucial role in demystifying\nvarious confusions. Our companion paper arXiv:1610.01941 describes in greater\ndetail the mathematical framework embodying the topological symmetries we\nuncover here.\n", "  Causally ordered correlation functions of local operators in near-thermal\nquantum systems computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism obey a set of\nWard identities. These can be understood rather simply as the consequence of a\ntopological (BRST) algebra, called the universal Schwinger-Keldysh\nsuperalgebra, as explained in our companion paper arXiv:1610.01940. In the\npresent paper we provide a mathematical discussion of this topological algebra.\nIn particular, we argue that the structures can be understood in the language\nof extended equivariant cohomology. To keep the discussion self-contained, we\nprovide a basic review of the algebraic construction of equivariant cohomology\nand explain how it can be understood in familiar terms as a superspace gauge\nalgebra. We demonstrate how the Schwinger-Keldysh construction can be\nsuccinctly encoded in terms a thermal equivariant cohomology algebra which\nnaturally acts on the operator (super)-algebra of the quantum system. The main\nrationale behind this exploration is to extract symmetry statements which are\nrobust under renormalization group flow and can hence be used to understand\nlow-energy effective field theory of near-thermal physics. To illustrate the\ngeneral principles, we focus on Langevin dynamics of a Brownian particle,\nrephrasing some known results in terms of thermal equivariant cohomology. As\ndescribed elsewhere, the general framework enables construction of effective\nactions for dissipative hydrodynamics and could potentially illumine our\nunderstanding of black holes.\n", "  Superlattices are promising low-dimensional nanomaterials for thermoelectric\ntechnology that is capable of directly converting low-grade heat energy to\nuseful electrical power. In this work, the thermal conductivities of GaAs/Ge\nsuperlattice nanostructures were investigated systematically in relation to\ntheir morphologies and interfaces. Thermal conductivities were measured using\nultrafast time-domain thermoreflectance and were found to decrease with\nincreasing interface densities, consistent with our understanding of\nmicroscopic phonon transport in the particle regime. Lower thermal\nconductivities were observed in (GaAs)0.77(Ge2)0.23 alloys; transmission\nelectron microscopy study reveals phase separation in the alloys. These alloys\ncan be interpreted as fine nanostructures, with length scales comparable to the\nperiods of very thin superlattices. Our experimental findings help gain\nfundamental insight into nanoscale thermal transport in superlattices and are\nalso useful for future improvement of thermoelectric performance using\nsuperlattice nanostructures.\n", "  We present the temperature and polarization angular power spectra measured by\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol). We analyze night-time\ndata collected during 2013-14 using two detector arrays at 149 GHz, from 548\ndeg$^2$ of sky on the celestial equator. We use these spectra, and the spectra\nmeasured with the MBAC camera on ACT from 2008-10, in combination with Planck\nand WMAP data to estimate cosmological parameters from the temperature,\npolarization, and temperature-polarization cross-correlations. We find the new\nACTPol data to be consistent with the LCDM model. The ACTPol\ntemperature-polarization cross-spectrum now provides stronger constraints on\nmultiple parameters than the ACTPol temperature spectrum, including the baryon\ndensity, the acoustic peak angular scale, and the derived Hubble constant.\nAdding the new data to planck temperature data tightens the limits on damping\ntail parameters, for example reducing the joint uncertainty on the number of\nneutrino species and the primordial helium fraction by 20%.\n", "  We propose a new theory on a relation between diffusive and coherent nature\nin one dimensional wave mechanics based on a quantum walk. It is known that the\nquantum walk in homogeneous matrices provides the coherent property of wave\nmechanics. Using the recent result of a localization phenomenon in a\none-dimensional quantum walk (Konno, Quantum Inf. Proc. (2010) 9, 405-418), we\nnumerically show that the randomized localized matrices suppress the coherence\nand give diffusive nature.\n", "  We study transport properties of a phosphorene monolayer in the presence of\nsingle and multiple potential barriers of height $U_0$ and width $d$, using\nboth continuum and microscopic lattice models, and show that the nature of\nelectron transport along its armchair edge ($x$ direction) is qualitatively\ndifferent from its counterpart in both conventional two-dimensional electron\ngas with Schr\\\"odinger-like quasiparticles and graphene or surfaces of\ntopological insulators hosting massless Dirac quasiparticles. We show that the\ntransport, mediated by massive Dirac electrons, allows one to achieve\ncollimated quasiparticle motion along $x$ and thus makes monolayer phosphorene\nan ideal experimental platform for studying Klein paradox. We study the\ndependence of the tunneling conductance $G \\equiv G_{xx}$ as a function of $d$\nand $U_0$, and demonstrate that for a given applied voltage $V$ its behavior\nchanges from oscillatory to decaying function of $d$ for a range of $U_0$ with\nfinite non-zero upper and lower bounds, and provide analytical expression for\nthese bounds within which $G$ decays with $d$. We contrast such behavior of $G$\nwith that of massless Dirac electrons in graphene and also with that along the\nzigzag edge ($y$ direction) in phosphorene where the quasiparticles obey an\neffective Schr\\\"odinger equation at low energy. We also study transport through\nmultiple barriers along $x$ and demonstrate that these properties hold for\ntransport through multiple barrier as well. Finally, we suggest concrete\nexperiments which may verify our theoretical predictions.\n", "  Ptychographic imaging with soft X-rays, especially in the water window energy\nrange, suffers from limited detector dynamic range that directly influences the\nmaximum spatial resolution achievable. High-dynamic-range data can be obtained\nby multiple exposures. By this approach we have increased the dynamic range of\na ptychographic data set by a factor of 76 and obtained diffraction signal till\nthe corners of the detector. The real space half period resolution was improved\nfrom 50 nm for the single exposure data to 18 nm for the high-dynamic-range\ndata.\n", "  The theory of pseudo-differential operators is a powerful tool to deal with\ndifferential equations involving differential operators under the square root\nsign. These type of equations are pivotal elements to treat problems in\nanomalous diffusion and in relativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper we\nreport on new and unsuspected links between fractional diffusion, quantum\nrelativistic equations and particular families of polynomials, linked to the\nCarlitz family, and playing the role of relativistic heat polynomials. We\nintroduce generalizations of these polynomial families and point out their\nspecific use for the solutions of problems of practical importance.\n", "  Effective field theory provides a powerful framework to exploit a separation\nof scales in physical systems. In these lectures, we discuss some general\naspects of effective field theories and their application to few-body physics.\nIn particular, we consider an effective field theory for non-relativistic\nparticles with resonant short-range interactions where certain parts of the\ninteraction need to be treated nonperturbatively. As an application, we discuss\nthe so-called pionless effective field theory for low-energy nuclear physics.\nThe extension to include long-range interactions mediated by photon and\npion-exchange is also addressed.\n", "  By regarding the Einstein equations as equation(s) of state, we demonstrate\nthat a full cohomogeneity horizon first law can be derived in horizon\nthermodynamics. In this approach both the entropy and the free energy are\nderived concepts, while the standard (degenerate) horizon first law is\nrecovered by a Legendre projection from the more general one we derive. These\nresults readily generalize to higher curvature gravities and establish a way of\nhow to formulate consistent black hole thermodynamics without conserved\ncharges.\n", "  We performed numerical calculations to test the suggestion by Desiati &\nLazarian (2013) that the anisotropies of TeV cosmic rays may arise from their\ninteractions with the heliosphere. For this purpose, we used a magnetic field\nmodel of the heliosphere and performed direct numerical calculations of\nparticle trajectories. Unlike earlier papers testing the idea, we did not\nemploy time-reversible techniques that are based on Liouville's theorem. We\nshowed numerically that for scattering by the heliosphere the conditions of\nLiouville's theorem are not satisfied and the adiabatic approximation and\ntime-reversibility of the particle trajectories are not valid. Our results\nindicate sensitivity to the magnetic structure of the heliospheric magnetic\nfield, and we expect that this will be useful for probing this structure in\nfuture research.\n", "  Experiments are done by colliding a swinging bat with a stationary baseball\nor softball. Each collision was recorded with high-speed cameras, from which\nthe post-impact speed, launch angle, and spin of the ball could be determined.\nInitial bat speeds were in the range 63-88 mph, producing launch angles in the\nrange 0$^\\circ$-30$^\\circ$ and spins in the range 0-3500 rpm. The results are\nanalyzed in the context of a ball-bat collision model and the parameters of\nthat model are determined. For both baseballs and softballs, the data are\nconsistent with a mechanism whereby the ball grips the surface of the bat,\nstretching the ball in the transverse direction and resulting in a spin that\nwas up to 40$\\%$ greater than would be obtained by rolling contact of rigid\nbodies. Using a lumped parameter contact model, baseballs are shown to be less\ncompliant tangentially than softballs. Implications of our results for batted\nballs in game situations are presented.\n", "  The neutron lifetime is important in understanding the production of light\nnuclei in the first minutes after the big bang and it provides basic\ninformation on the charged weak current of the standard model of particle\nphysics. Two different methods have been used to measure the neutron lifetime:\ndisappearance measurements using bottled ultracold neutrons and decay rate\nmeasurements using neutron beams. The best measurements using these two\ntechniques give results that differ by nearly 4 standard deviations. In this\npaper we describe a new method for measuring surviving neutrons in neutron\nlifetime measurements using bottled ultracold neutrons that provides better\ncharacterization of systematic uncertainties and enables higher precision than\nprevious measurement techniques. We present results obtained using our method.\n", "  We propose to compute approximations to general invariant sets in dynamical\nsystems by minimizing the distance between an appropriately selected finite set\nof points and its image under the dynamics. We demonstrate, through\ncomputational experiments that this approach can successfully converge to\napproximations of (maximal) invariant sets of arbitrary topology, dimension and\nstability as, e.g., saddle type invariant sets with complicated dynamics. We\nfurther propose to extend this approach by adding a Lennard-Jones type\npotential term to the objective function which yields more evenly distributed\napproximating finite point sets and perform corresponding numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  Periodic structures can be engineered to exhibit unique properties observed\nat symmetry points, such as zero group velocity, Dirac cones and saddle points;\nidentifying these, and the nature of the associated modes, from a direct\nreading of the dispersion surfaces is not straightforward, especially in\nthree-dimensions or at high frequencies when several dispersion surfaces fold\nback in the Brillouin zone. A recently proposed asymptotic high frequency\nhomogenisation theory is applied to a challenging time-domain experiment with\nelastic waves in a pinned metallic plate. The prediction of a narrow\nhigh-frequency spectral region where the effective medium tensor dramatically\nswitches from positive definite to indefinite is confirmed experimentally; a\nsmall frequency shift of the pulse carrier results in two distinct types of\nhighly anisotropic modes. The underlying effective equation mirrors this\nbehaviour with a change in form from elliptic to hyperbolic exemplifying the\nhigh degree of wave control available and the importance of a simple and\neffective predictive model.\n", "  Weighted dependency graphs have been recently introduced by the second\nauthor, as a toolbox to prove central limit theorems. In this paper, we prove\nthat spins in the $d$-dimensional Ising model display such a weighted\ndependency structure. We use this to obtain various central limit theorems for\nthe number of occurrences of local and global patterns in a growing box.\n", "  The semileptonic weak decay process of the $\\Lambda_c$ baryon to the neutron\n$\\Lambda_c\\rightarrow ne^+\\nu_e$ is examined. The transition form factors are\ninvestigated with light-cone QCD sum rules. The differential decay width is\nobtained in the dynamical region by fitting the sum rules-allowed results with\nthe dipole formula. The total decay width and the branching ratio are estimated\nto be $\\Gamma(\\Lambda_c\\rightarrow\nne^+\\nu_e)=(8.57\\pm0.41)\\times10^{-15}\\,\\mbox{GeV}$ and\n$\\mbox{Br}(\\Lambda_c\\rightarrow ne^+\\nu_e)=0.26\\pm0.01\\%$, respectively.\n", "  We extend the notion of anticoherent spin states to anticoherent subspaces.\nAn anticoherent subspace of order t, is a subspace whose unit vectors are all\nanticoherent states of order t. We use Klein's description of algebras of\npolynomials which are invariant under finite subgroups of SU(2) to provide\nconstructions of anticoherent subspaces. Furthermore, we show a connection\nbetween the existence of these subspaces and the properties of the higher-rank\nnumerical range for a set of spin observables. We also note that these\nconstructions give us subspaces of spin states all of whose unit vectors have\nMajorana representations which are spherical designs of order at least t.\n", "  In this paper we study the relation between conserved quantities of\nnonholonomic systems and the hamiltonization problem employing the geometric\nmethods of [1,3]. We illustrate the theory with classical examples describing\nthe dynamics of solids of revolution rolling without sliding on a plane. In\nthese cases, using the existence of two conserved quantities we obtain, by\nmeans of 'gauge transformations' and symmetry reduction, genuine Poisson\nbrackets describing the reduced dynamics.\n", "  We use weak-lensing shear measurements to determine the mean mass of\noptically selected galaxy clusters in Dark Energy Survey Science Verification\ndata. In a blinded analysis, we split the sample of more than 8,000 redMaPPer\nclusters into 15 subsets, spanning ranges in the richness parameter $5 \\leq\n\\lambda \\leq 180$ and redshift $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 0.8$, and fit the averaged mass\ndensity contrast profiles with a model that accounts for seven distinct sources\nof systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors;\ncluster-member contamination; miscentering; deviations from the NFW halo\nprofile; halo triaxiality; and line-of-sight projections. We combine the\ninferred cluster masses to estimate the joint scaling relation between mass,\nrichness and redshift, $\\mathcal{M}(\\lambda,z) \\varpropto M_0 \\lambda^{F}\n(1+z)^{G}$. We find $M_0 \\equiv \\langle\nM_{200\\mathrm{m}}\\,|\\,\\lambda=30,z=0.5\\rangle=\\left[ 2.35 \\pm 0.22\\ \\rm{(stat)}\n\\pm 0.12\\ \\rm{(sys)} \\right] \\cdot 10^{14}\\ M_\\odot$, with $F =\n1.12\\,\\pm\\,0.20\\ \\rm{(stat)}\\, \\pm\\, 0.06\\ \\rm{(sys)}$ and $G = 0.18\\,\\pm\\,\n0.75\\ \\rm{(stat)}\\, \\pm\\, 0.24\\ \\rm{(sys)}$. The amplitude of the mass-richness\nrelation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of\nredMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. (2016) and with the Saro et al.\n(2015) calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our\nresults extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of\nredMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from $z\\leq 0.3$ to\n$z\\leq0.8$. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric\nredshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial\nimprovements for forthcoming studies.\n", "  We examine the low-lying quarter BPS spectrum of a 2d conformal field theory\nwith target Sym$^N(K3)$ at various points in the moduli space, and look at a\nmore refined count than the ordinary elliptic genus. We compute growth of the\nspectrum at both the symmetric orbifold point, as well as at the supergravity\npoint in the moduli space. Finally we do a decomposition of the spectra into\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ characters and discuss possible relations to interesting\nsymmetry groups. A similar analysis is done with $T^4$.\n", "  We consider the $2+1$ dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group\n$\\text{SU}(N)$ on a flat 2-torus under twisted boundary conditions. We study\nthe possibility of phase transitions (tachyonic instabilities) when $N$ and the\nvolume vary and certain chromomagnetic flux associated to the topology of the\nbundle can be adjusted. Under natural assumptions about how to match the\nperturbative regime and the expected confinement, we prove that the absence of\ntachyonic instabilities is related to some problems in number theory, namely\nthe Diophantine approximation of irreducible fractions by other fractions of\nsmaller denominator.\n", "  We demonstrate natural optical activity in disordered ensembles of non-chiral\nplasmonic resonators. We show that the statistical distributions of rotatory\npower and spatial dichroism are strongly dependent on the scattering mean free\npath in diffusive random media. This result is explained in terms of the\nintrinsic geometric chirality of disordered media, as they lack mirror\nsymmetry. We argue that chirality and natural optical activity of disordered\nsystems can be quantified by the standard deviation of both rotatory power and\nspatial dichroism. Our results are based on microscopic electromagnetic wave\ntransport theory coupled to vectorial Green's matrix method for pointlike\nscatterers, and are independently confirmed by full-wave simulations.\n", "  The CoRoT mission during its flight-phase 2007-2012 delivered the\nlight-curves for over 2000 eclipsing binaries. Data from the Kepler mission\nhave proven the existence of several transiting circumbinary planets. Albeit\nlight-curves from CoRoT have typically lower precision and shorter coverage,\nCoRoT's number of targets is similar to Kepler, and some of the known\ncircumbinary planets could potentially be detected in CoRoT data as well. The\naim of this work has been a revision of the entire CoRoT data-set for the\npresence of circumbinary planets, and the derivation of limits to the\nabundances of such planets. We developed a code which removes the light curve\nof the eclipsing binaries and searches for quasi-periodic transit-like features\nin a light curve after removal of binary eclipses and instrumental features.\nThe code needs little information on the sample systems and can be used for\nother space missions as well, like Kepler, K2, TESS and PLATO. The code is\nbroad in the requirements leading to detections, but was tuned to deliver an\namount of detections that is manageable in a subsequent, mainly visual,\nrevision about their nature. In the CoRoT sample we identified three planet\ncandidates whose transits would have arisen from a single pass across the\ncentral binary. No candidates remained however with transit events from\nmultiple planetary orbits. We calculated the upper limits for the number of\nJupiter, Saturn and Neptune sized planets in co-planar orbits for different\norbital period ranges. We found that there are much less giant planets in\nshort-periodic orbits around close binary systems than around single stars.\n", "  The lattice Dirac equation is formulated on a simplicial complex which\napproximates a smooth Riemann manifold by introducing a lattice vierbein on\neach site and a lattice spin connection on each link. Care is taken so the\nconstruction applies to any smooth D-dimensional Riemannian manifold that\npermits a spin connection. It is tested numerically in 2D for the projective\nsphere ${\\mathbb S}^2$ in the limit of an increasingly refined sequence of\ntriangles. The eigenspectrum and eigenvectors are shown to converge rapidly to\nthe exact result in the continuum limit. In addition comparison is made with\nthe continuum Ising conformal field theory on ${\\mathbb S}^2$. Convergence is\ntested for the two point, $\\langle \\epsilon(x_1) \\epsilon(x_2) \\rangle$, and\nthe four point, $\\langle \\sigma(x_1) \\epsilon(x_2) \\epsilon(x_3 )\\sigma(x_4)\n\\rangle $, correlators for the energy, $\\epsilon(x) = i \\bar \\psi(x)\\psi(x)$,\nand twist operators, $\\sigma(x)$, respectively.\n", "  Exact solutions describing the spherical collapse of null fluids can contain\nregions which violate the energy conditions. Physically the violations occur\nwhen the infalling matter continues to move inwards even when non-gravitational\nrepulsive forces become stronger than gravity. In 1991 Ori proposed a\nresolution for these violations: spacetime surgery should be used to replace\nthe energy condition violating region with an outgoing solution. The matter\nbounces. We revisit and implement this proposal for the more general Husain\nnull fluids including a careful study of potential discontinuities and\nassociated matter shells between the regions. Along the way we highlight an\nerror in the standard classification of energy condition violations for Type II\nstress-energy tensors.\n", "  The controlled creation of defect center---nanocavity systems is one of the\noutstanding challenges for efficiently interfacing spin quantum memories with\nphotons for photon-based entanglement operations in a quantum network. Here, we\ndemonstrate direct, maskless creation of atom-like single silicon-vacancy (SiV)\ncenters in diamond nanostructures via focused ion beam implantation with $\\sim\n32$ nm lateral precision and $< 50$ nm positioning accuracy relative to a\nnanocavity. Moreover, we determine the Si+ ion to SiV center conversion yield\nto $\\sim 2.5\\%$ and observe a 10-fold conversion yield increase by additional\nelectron irradiation. We extract inhomogeneously broadened ensemble emission\nlinewidths of $\\sim 51$ GHz, and close to lifetime-limited single-emitter\ntransition linewidths down to $126 \\pm13$ MHz corresponding to $\\sim 1.4$-times\nthe natural linewidth. This demonstration of deterministic creation of\noptically coherent solid-state single quantum systems is an important step\ntowards development of scalable quantum optical devices.\n", "  In this paper, the design and the performance of a prototype detector based\non MicroMegas technology with two detection planes in a common gas volume is\ndiscussed. The detector is suited for the forward region of LHC detectors,\naddressing the high-rate environment and limited available space. Each\ndetection plane has an active area of 9x9 cm^2 with a two-dimensional strip\nreadout and is separated by a common gas region with a height of 14 mm. A\nmicro-mesh, working as a cathode, is placed in the middle of the common gas\nvolume separating it into two individual cells. This setup allows for an angle\nreconstruction of incoming particles with a precision of 2 mrad. Since this\ndesign reduces the impact of multiple scattering effects by the reduced\nmaterial budget, possible applications for low energy beam experiments can be\nenvisioned. The performance of the prototype detector has been tested with a\n4.4 GeV electron beam, provided by the test beam facility at DESY.\n", "  I discuss some of what is known and unknown about the behavior of black hole\nbinary systems in the quiescent accretion state. Quiescence is important for\nseveral reasons: 1) the dominance of the companion star in the optical and IR\nwavelengths allows the binary parameters to be robustly determined - as an\nexample, we argue that the longer proposed distance to the X-ray source GRO\nJ1655-40 is correct; 2) quiescence represents the limiting case of an extremely\nlow accretion rate, in which both accretion and jets can be observed; 3)\nunderstanding the evolution and duration of the quiescent state is a key factor\nin determining the overall demographics of X-rary binaries, which has taken on\na new importance in the era of gravitational wave astronomy.\n", "  We present predictions of Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), from the UV\nto the FIR, of simulated galaxies at $z=0$. These were obtained by\npost-processing the results of an N-body+hydro simulation of a small\ncosmological volume, that uses the Multi-Phase Particle Integrator (MUPPI) for\nstar formation and stellar feedback, with the GRASIL-3D radiative transfer\ncode, that includes reprocessing of UV light by dust. Physical properties of\ngalaxies resemble observed ones, though with some tension at small and large\nstellar masses. Comparing predicted SEDs of simulated galaxies with different\nsamples of local galaxies, we find that these resemble observed ones, when\nnormalised at 3.6 $\\mu$m. A comparison with the Herschel Reference Survey shows\nthat, when binning galaxies in Star Formation Rate (SFR), average SEDs are\nreproduced to within a factor of $\\sim2$ even in normalization, while binning\nin stellar mass highlights the same tension that is present in the stellar mass\n-- SFR plane. We use our sample to investigate the correlation of IR luminosity\nin Spitzer and Herschel bands with several galaxy properties. SFR is the\nquantity that best correlates with IR light up to $160\\ \\mu$m, while at longer\nwavelengths better correlations are found with molecular mass and, at $500\\\n\\mu$m, with dust mass. However, using the position of the FIR peak as a proxy\nfor cold dust temperature, we assess that heating of cold dust is mostly\ndetermined by SFR, with stellar mass giving only a minor contribution. We\nfinally show how our sample of simulated galaxies can be used as a guide to\nunderstand the physical properties and selection biases of observed samples.\n", "  The summit of the Antarctic plateau, Dome A, is proving to be an excellent\nsite for optical, NIR, and THz astronomical observations. GATTINI was a\nwide-field camera installed on the PLATO instrument module as part of the\nChinese-led traverse to Dome A in January, 2009. We present here the\nmeasurements of sky brightness with the Gattini ultra-large field of view (90\ndeg x 90 deg) in the photometric B-, V-, and R-bands, cloud cover statistics\nmeasured during the 2009 winter season, and an estimate of the sky\ntransparency. A cumulative probability distribution indicates that the darkest\n10% of the nights at Dome A have sky brightness of S_B = 22.98, S_V = 21.86,\nand S_R = 21.68 mag arcsec^{-2}. These values were obtained around the year\n2009 with minimum aurora, and they are comparable to the faintest sky\nbrightness at Mauna Kea and the best sites of northern Chile. Since every\nfilter includes strong auroral lines that effectively contaminate the sky\nbrightness measurements, for instruments working around the auroral lines,\neither with custom filters or with high spectral resolution instruments, these\nvalues could be easily obtained on a more routine basis. In addition, we\npresent example light curves for bright targets to emphasize the unprecedented\nobservational window function available from this ground-based site. These\nlight curves will be published in a future paper.\n", "  Lipid bilayer membranes are not uniform and clusters of lipids in a more\nordered state exist within the generally disorder lipid milieu of the membrane.\nThese clusters of ordered lipids microdomains are now referred to as lipid\nrafts. Recent reports attribute the formation of these microdomains to the\ngeometrical and molecular mechanical mismatch of lipids of different species on\nthe boundary. Here we introduce the geodesic curvature to characterize the\ngeometry of the domain boundary, and develop a geodesic curvature energy model\nto describe the formation of these microdomains as a result of energy\nminimization. Our model accepts the intrinsic geodesic curvature of any binary\nlipid mixture as an input, and will produce microdomains of the given geodesic\ncurvature as demonstrated by three sets of numerical simulations. Our results\nare in contrast to the surface phase separation predicted by the classical\nsurface Cahn-Hilliard equation, which tends to generate large domains as a\nresult of the minimizing line tension. Our model provides a direct and\nquantified description of the structure inhomogeneity of lipid bilayer\nmembrane, and can be coupled to the investigations of biological processes on\nmembranes for which such inhomogeneity plays essential roles.\n", "  A quadruple quantum-dot (QQD) cell is proposed as a spin filter. The\ntransport properties of the QQD cell were studied in linear response regime on\nthe basis of the equations of motion for retarded Green's functions. The\ndeveloped approach allowed us to take into account the influence of both intra-\nand interdot Coulomb interactions on carriers' spin polarization. It was shown\nthat the presence of the insulating bands in the conductance due to the Coulomb\ncorrelations results in the emergence of spin-polarized windows (SPWs) in\nmagnetic field leading to the high spin polarization. We demonstrated the SPWs\ncan be effectively manipulated by gate fields and considering the hopping\nbetween central dots in both isotropic and anisotropic regimes.\n", "  Within the spin-fermion model for cuprate superconductors, the influence of\nthe intersite Coulomb interactions $V_2$ and $V_2'$ between holes located at\nthe next-nearest-neighbor oxygen ions of CuO$_2$ plane on the implementation of\nthe d_{x^2-y^2}-wave pairing is studied. It is shown that d-wave pairing can be\nsuppressed only for unphysically large values of $V_2$ and $V_2'$.\n", "  Optical trapping can be used to manipulate the three-dimensional (3-D) motion\nof spherical particles based on the simple prediction of optical forces and the\nresponding motion of samples. However, controlling the 3-D behaviour of\nnon-spherical particles with arbitrary orientations is extremely challenging,\ndue to experimental difficulties and the extensive computations. Here, we\nachieved the real-time optical control of arbitrarily shaped particles by\ncombining the wavefront shaping of a trapping beam and measurements of the 3-D\nrefractive index (RI) distribution of samples. Engineering the 3-D light field\ndistribution of a trapping beam based on the measured 3-D RI map of samples\ngenerates a light mould, which can be used to manipulate colloidal and\nbiological samples which have arbitrary orientations and/or shapes. The present\nmethod provides stable control of the orientation and assembly of arbitrarily\nshaped particles without knowing a priori information about the sample\ngeometry. The proposed method can be directly applied in biophotonics and soft\nmatter physics.\n", "  The aim of these notes is to provide a reasonably short and \"hands-on\"\nintroduction to the differential calculus on associative algebras over a field\nof characteristic zero. Following a suggestion of Ginzburg's we call the\nresulting theory associative geometry. We argue that this formalism sheds a new\nlight on some classic solution methods in the theory of finite-dimensional\nintegrable dynamical systems.\n", "  We present a strong lensing analysis on the massive cluster Abell 370 (A370;\nz = 0.375), using a combination of deep multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nimaging and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy. From only\ntwo hours of MUSE data, we are able to measure 120 redshifts in the Southern\nBCG area, including several multiply-imaged lens systems. In total, we increase\nthe number of multiply-imaged systems with a secure redshift from 4 to 15, nine\nof which are newly discovered. Of these, eight are located at z > 3, greatly\nextending the redshift range of spectroscopically-confirmed systems over\nprevious work. Using these systems as constraints, we update a parametric lens\nmodel of A370, probing the mass distribution from cluster to galaxy scales.\nOverall, we find that a model with only two cluster- scale dark matter halos\n(one for each BCG) does a poor job of fitting these new image constraints.\nInstead, two additional mass clumps -- a central \"bar\" of mass located between\nthe BCGs, and another clump located within a \"crown\" of galaxies in the\nNorthern part of the cluster field -- provide significant improvements to the\nfit. Additional physical evidence suggests these clumps are indeed real\nfeatures of the system, but with relatively few image constraints in the crown\nregion, this claim is difficult to evaluate from a modeling perspective.\nAdditional MUSE observations of A370 covering the entire strong-lensing region\nwill greatly help these efforts, further improving our understanding of this\nintriguing cluster.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics can be extended to include sterile\n(right-handed) neutrinos or axions to solve the dark matter problem. Depending\nupon the mixing angle between active and sterile neutrinos, the latter have the\npossibility to decay into monoenergetic active neutrinos and photons in the\nkeV-range while axions can couple to two photons. We have used data taken with\nX-ray telescopes like e.g. XMM-Newton for the search of line emissions. We used\npointings with high exposures and expected dark matter column densities with\nrespect to the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. The posterior predictive\np-value analysis has been applied to locate parameter space regions which\nfavour additional emission lines. In addition, upper limits of the parameter\nspace of the models have been generated such that the preexisting limits have\nbeen significantly improved.\n", "  ${\\cal N} = 8$ superconformal field theories, such as the ABJM theory at\nChern-Simons level $k=1$ or $2$, contain 35 scalar operators ${\\cal O}_{IJ}$\nwith $\\Delta=1$ in the ${\\bf 35}_v$ representation of SO(8). The 3-point\ncorrelation function of these operators is non-vanishing, and indeed can be\ncalculated non-perturbatively in the field theory. But its AdS$_4$ gravity\ndual, obtained from gauged ${\\cal N}=8$ supergravity, has no cubic $A^3$\ncouplings in its Lagrangian, where $A^{IJ}$ is the bulk dual of ${\\cal\nO}_{IJ}$. So conventional Witten diagrams cannot furnish the field theory\nresult. We show that the extension of bulk supersymmetry to the AdS$_4$\nboundary requires the introduction of a finite $A^3$ counterterm that does\nprovide a perfect match to the 3-point correlator. Boundary supersymmetry also\nrequires infinite counterterms which agree with the method of holographic\nrenormalization. The generating functional of correlation functions of the\n$\\Delta=1$ operators is the Legendre transform of the on-shell action, and the\nsupersymmetry properties of this functional play a significant role in our\ntreatment.\n", "  We study inflationary scenarios driven by a scalar field in the presence of a\nnon-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. We show that the Friedmann\nequation can be significantly modified when the energy density during inflation\nexceeds a critical value determined by the non-minimal coupling, which in turn\nmay considerably modify the spectrum of primordial perturbations and the\ninflationary dynamics. In particular, we show that these models are\ncharacterised by a consistency relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio and\nthe tensor spectral index that can differ significantly from the predictions of\ngeneral relativity. We also give examples of observational predictions for some\nof the most commonly considered potentials and use the results of the Planck\ncollaboration to set limits on the scale of the non-minimal coupling.\n", "  We present a summary of the more than 3,000 sungrazing and near-Sun comets\ndiscovered in coronagraph images returned by the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO), since its launch in December 1995. We address each of the\nfour main populations of objects observed by SOHO: Kreutz (sungrazing) group,\nMeyer group, Marsden and Kracht (96P-Family) group, and non-group comets.\nDiscussions for each group include basic properties, discovery statistics, and\nmorphological appearance. In addition to updating the community on the status\nof the discoveries by SOHO, we also show that the rate of discovery of Kreutz\nsungrazers has likely remained static since approximately 2003, and report on\nthe first likely fragmentation pair observed within the Meyer group.\n", "  We study the interaction of relativistic jets with their environment, using\n3-dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell simulations for two cases of jet\ncomposition: (i) electron-proton ($e^{-}-p^{+}$) and (ii) electron-positron\n($e^{\\pm}$) plasmas containing helical magnetic fields. We have performed\nsimulations of \"global\" jets containing helical magnetic fields in order to\nexamine how helical magnetic fields affect kinetic instabilities such as the\nWeibel instability, the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the Mushroom\ninstability. We have found that these kinetic instabilities are suppressed and\nnew types of instabilities can grow. For the $e^{-}-p^{+}$ jet, a\nrecollimation-like instability occurs and jet electrons are strongly perturbed,\nwhereas for the $e^{\\pm}$ jet, a recollimation-like instability occurs at early\ntimes followed by kinetic instability and the general structure is similar to a\nsimulation without a helical magnetic field. We plan to perform further\nsimulations using much larger systems to confirm these new findings.\n", "  Hellerman et al. (arXiv:1505.01537) have shown that in a generic CFT the\nspectrum of operators carrying a large U(1) charge can be analyzed\nsemiclassically in an expansion in inverse powers of the charge. The key is the\noperator state correspondence by which such operators are associated with a\nfinite density superfluid phase for the theory quantized on the cylinder. The\ndynamics is dominated by the corresponding Goldstone hydrodynamic mode and the\nderivative expansion coincides with the inverse charge expansion. We illustrate\nand further clarify this situation by first considering simple quantum\nmechanical analogues. We then systematize the approach by employing the coset\nconstruction for non-linearly realized space-time symmetries. Focussing on CFT3\nwe illustrate the case of higher rank and non-abelian groups and the\ncomputation of higher point functions. Three point function coefficients turn\nout to satisfy universal scaling laws and correlations as the charge and spin\nare varied.\n", "  Atmospheric chemical abundances of giant planets lead to important\nconstraints on planetary formation and migration. Studies have shown that giant\nplanets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete substantial\namounts of oxygen-rich planetesimals, leading to super-solar metallicities in\nthe envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity\ncan be substantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach\n1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e.\ncold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering.\nAllowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and\nsolar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g.\nphoto-evaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion.\n", "  We conduct a uniform analysis of the transit timing variations (TTVs) of 145\nplanets from 55 Kepler multiplanet systems to infer planet masses and\neccentricities. Eighty of these planets do not have previously reported mass\nand eccentricity measurements. We employ two complementary methods to fit TTVs:\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo simulations based on N-body integration and an\nanalytic fitting approach. Mass measurements of 49 planets, including 12\nwithout previously reported masses, meet our criterion for classification as\nrobust. Using mass and radius measurements, we infer the masses of planets'\ngaseous envelopes for both our TTV sample as well as transiting planets with\nradial velocity observations. Insight from analytic TTV formulae allows us to\npartially circumvent degeneracies inherent to inferring eccentricities from TTV\nobservations. We find that planet eccentricities are generally small, typically\na few percent, but in many instances are non-zero.\n", "  Temperature-dependent magnetic experiments like pump-probe measurements\ngenerated by a pulsed laser have become a crucial technique for switching the\nmagnetization in the picosecond time scale. Apart from having practical\nimplications on the magnetic storage technology, the research field of\nultrafast magnetization poses also fundamental physical questions. To correctly\ndescribe the time evolution of the atomic magnetic moments under the influence\nof a temperature-dependent laser pulse, it remains crucial to know if the\nmagnetic material under investigation has magnetic excitation spectrum that is\nmore or less dependent on the magnetic configuration, e.g. as reflected by the\ntemperature dependence of the exchange interactions. In this article, we\ndemonstrate from first-principles theory that the magnetic excitation spectra\nin Co with fcc, bcc and hcp structures are nearly identical in a wide range of\nnon-collinear magnetic configurations. This is a curious result of a balance\nbetween the size of the magnetic moments and the strength of the Heisenberg\nexchange interactions, that in themselves vary with configuration, but put\ntogether in an effective spin Hamiltonian results in a configuration\nindependent effective model. We have used such a Hamiltonian, together with\nab-initio calculated damping parameters, to investigate the magnon dispersion\nrelationship as well as the ultrafast magnetisation dynamics of Co and Co-rich\nCoMn alloys.\n", "  Semiconductor InAs/GaAs quantum dots grown by the Stranski-Krastanov method\nare among the leading candidates for the deterministic generation of\npolarization entangled photon pairs. Despite remarkable progress in the last\ntwenty years, many challenges still remain for this material, such as the\nextremely low yield (<1% quantum dots can emit entangled photons), the low\ndegree of entanglement, and the large wavelength distribution. Here we show\nthat, with an emerging family of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots grown by droplet\netching and nanohole infilling, it is possible to obtain a large ensemble\n(close to 100%) of polarization-entangled photon emitters on a wafer without\nany post-growth tuning. Under pulsed resonant two-photon excitation, all\nmeasured quantum dots emit single pairs of entangled photons with ultra-high\npurity, high degree of entanglement (fidelity up to F=0.91, with a record high\nconcurrence C=0.90), and ultra-narrow wavelength distribution at rubidium\ntransitions. Therefore, a solid-state quantum repeater - among many other key\nenabling quantum photonic elements - can be practically implemented with this\nnew material.\n", "  We present the fundamental techniques and working equations of many-body\nGreen's function theory for calculating ground state properties and the\nspectral strength. Green's function methods closely relate to other polynomial\nscaling approaches discussed in chapters 8 and 10. However, here we aim\ndirectly at a global view of the many-fermion structure. We derive the working\nequations for calculating many-body propagators, using both the Algebraic\nDiagrammatic Construction technique and the self-consistent formalism at finite\ntemperature. Their implementation is discussed, as well as the inclusion of\nthree-nucleon interactions. The self-consistency feature is essential to\nguarantee thermodynamic consistency. The pairing and neutron matter models\nintroduced in previous chapters are solved and compared with the other methods\nin this book.\n", "  We describe the evolution of optical and X-ray temporal characteristics\nduring the outburst decline of the black hole X-ray binary SWIFT J1753.5-0127.\nThe optical/X-ray cross-correlation function demonstrates a single positive\ncorrelation at the outburst peak, then it has multiple dips and peaks during\nthe decline stage, which are then replaced by the precognition dip plus peak\nstructure in the outburst tail. Power spectral densities and phase lags show a\ncomplex evolution, revealing the presence of intrinsically connected optical\nand X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations. For the first time, we quantitatively\nexplain the evolution of these timing properties during the entire outburst\nwithin one model, the essence of which is the expansion of the hot accretion\nflow towards the tail of the outburst. The pivoting of the spectrum produced by\nsynchrotron Comptonization in the hot flow is responsible for the appearance of\nthe anti-correlation with the X-rays and for the optical quasi-periodic\noscillations. Our model reproduces well the cross-correlation and phase lag\nspectrum during the decline stage, which could not be understood with any model\nproposed before.\n", "  We have investigated the longitudinal thermal conductivity of\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, the magnetic state of which is considered to be proximate\nto a Kitaev honeycomb model, along with the spin susceptibility and magnetic\nspecific heat. We found that the temperature dependence of the thermal\nconductivity exhibits an additional peak around 100 K, which is well above the\nphonon peak temperature ($\\sim$ 50 K). The higher-temperature peak position is\ncomparable to the temperature scale of the Kitaev couplings rather than the\nN\\'eel temperatures below 15 K. The additional heat conduction was observed for\nall five samples used in this study, and was found to be rather immune to a\nstructural phase transition of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, which suggests its\ndifferent origin from phonons. Combined with experimental results of the\nmagnetic specific heat, our transport measurement suggests strongly that the\nhigher-temperature peak in the thermal conductivity is attributed to itinerant\nspin excitations associated with the Kitaev couplings of $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. A\nkinetic approximation of the magnetic thermal conductivity yields a mean free\npath of $\\sim$ 20 nm at 100 K, which is well longer than the nearest Ru-Ru\ndistance ($\\sim$ 3 \\AA), suggesting the long-distance coherent propagation of\nmagnetic excitations driven by the Kitaev couplings.\n", "  Working within the recent formalism of Poisson-Riemannian geometry, we\ncompletely solve the case of generic spherically symmetric metric and\nspherically symmetric Poisson-bracket to find a unique answer for the quantum\ndifferential calculus, quantum metric and quantum Levi-Civita connection at\nsemiclassical order $O(\\lambda)$. Here $\\lambda$ is the deformation parameter,\nplausibly the Planck scale. We find that $r,t,dr,dt$ are all forced to be\ncentral, i.e. undeformed at order $\\lambda$, while for each value of $r,t$ we\nare forced to have a fuzzy sphere of radius $r$ with a unique differential\ncalculus which is necessarily nonassociative at order $\\lambda^2$. We give the\nspherically symmetric quantisation of the FLRW cosmology in detail and also\nrecover a previous analysis for the Schwarzschild black hole, now showing that\nthe quantum Ricci tensor for the latter vanishes at order $\\lambda$. The\nquantum Laplace-Beltrami operator for spherically symmetric models turns out to\nbe undeformed at order $\\lambda$ while more generally in Poisson-Riemannian\ngeometry we show that it deforms to \\[ \\square f+{\\lambda\\over\n2}\\omega^{\\alpha\\beta}({\\rm\nRic}^\\gamma{}_\\alpha-S^\\gamma{}_{;\\alpha})(\\widehat\\nabla_\\beta d f)_\\gamma +\nO(\\lambda^2)\\] in terms of the classical Levi-Civita connection\n$\\widehat\\nabla$, the contorsion tensor $S$, the Poisson-bivector $\\omega$ and\nthe Ricci curvature of the Poisson-connection that controls the quantum\ndifferential structure. The Majid-Ruegg spacetime $[x,t]=\\lambda x$ with its\nstandard calculus and unique quantum metric provides an example with nontrivial\ncorrection to the Laplacian at order $\\lambda$.\n", "  Modern X-ray spectroscopy has proven itself as a robust tool for probing the\nelectronic structure of atoms in complex environments. Despite working on\nenergy scales that are much larger than those corresponding to nuclear motions,\ntaking nuclear dynamics and the associated nuclear correlations into account\nmay be of importance for X-ray spectroscopy. Recently, we have developed an\nefficient protocol to account for nuclear dynamics in X-ray absorption and\nresonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra [Karsten \\textit{et al.}\narXiv:1608.03436], based on ground state molecular dynamics accompanied with\nstate-of-the-art calculations of electronic excitation energies and transition\ndipoles. Here, we present an alternative derivation of the formalism and\nelaborate on the developed simulation protocol on the examples of gas phase and\nbulk water. The specific spectroscopic features stemming from the nuclear\nmotions are analyzed and traced down to the dynamics of electronic energy gaps\nand transition dipole correlation functions. The observed tendencies are\nexplained on the basis of a simple harmonic model and the involved\napproximations are discussed. The method represents a step forward over the\nconventional approaches treating the system in full complexity and provides a\nreasonable starting point for further improvements.\n", "  We study laterally trapped dipolar exciton ensembles in coupled GaAs quantum\nwells at high magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. In\nphotoluminescence experiments, we identify three magnetic field regimes. At low\nfields, the exciton density is increased by a reduced charge carrier escape\nfrom the trap, and additionally, the excitons' emission energy is corrected by\na positive diamagnetic shift. At intermediate fields, magnetic field dependent\ncorrection terms apply which follow the characteristics of a neutral\nmagnetoexciton. Due to a combined effect of an increasing binding energy and\nlifetime, the exciton density is roughly doubled from zero to about seven\nTesla. At the latter high field value, the charge carriers occupy only the\nlowest Landau level. In this situation, the exciton trap can overflow\nindependently from the electrostatic depth of the trapping potential, and the\nenergy shift of the excitons caused by the so-called quantum confined Stark\neffect is effectively compensated. Instead, the exciton energetics seem to be\ndriven by the magnetic field dependent renormalization of the many-body\ninteraction terms. In this regime, the impact of parasitic in-plane fields at\nthe edge of trapping potential is eliminated.\n", "  By means of the unitary transformation, a new way for discussing the ordering\nprescription of Schrodinger equation with a position-dependent mass (PDM) for\nisospectral Hamiltonian operators is presented. We show that the ambiguity\nparameter choices in the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian can be explained\nthrough an exact SUSY symmetry as well as a consequence of an accidental\nsymmetry under the Z2 action. By making use of the unitary transformation, we\nconstruct coherent states for a family of PDM isospectral Hamiltonians from a\nsuitable choice of ladder operators. We show that these states preserve the\nusual structure of Klauder-Perelomov s states and thus saturate and minimize\nthe generalized position-momentum uncertainty relation (GUR) under some special\nrestrictions. We show that GURs properties can be used to determine the sign of\nthe superpotential.\n", "  We study the inverse problem of recovering the order and the diffusion\ncoefficient of an elliptic fractional partial differential equation from a\nfinite number of noisy observations of the solution. We work in a Bayesian\nframework and show conditions under which the posterior distribution is given\nby a change of measure from the prior. Moreover, we show well-posedness of the\ninverse problem, in the sense that small perturbations of the observed solution\nlead to small Hellinger perturbations of the associated posterior measures. We\nthus provide a mathematical foundation to the Bayesian learning of the order\n---and other inputs--- of fractional models.\n", "  Thorough characterization of the thermo-mechanical properties of materials\nrequires difficult and time-consuming experiments. This severely limits the\navailability of data and it is one of the main obstacles for the development of\neffective accelerated materials design strategies. The rapid screening of new\npotential systems requires highly integrated, sophisticated and robust\ncomputational approaches. We tackled the challenge by surveying more than 3,000\ncrystalline solids within the AFLOW framework with the newly developed\n\"Automatic Elasticity Library\" combined with the previously implemented GIBBS\nmethod. The first extracts the mechanical properties from automatic\nself-consistent stress-strain calculations, while the latter employs those\nmechanical properties to evaluate the thermodynamics within the Debye model.\nThe new thermo-elastic library is benchmarked against a set of 74\nexperimentally characterized systems to pinpoint a robust computational\nmethodology for the evaluation of bulk and shear moduli, Poisson ratios, Debye\ntemperatures, Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, and thermal conductivities of a wide\nvariety of materials. The effect of different choices of equations of state is\nexamined and the optimum combination of properties for the\nLeibfried-Schl\\\"omann prediction of thermal conductivity is identified, leading\nto improved agreement with experimental results than the GIBBS-only approach.\n", "  We propose a simple ansatz for estimating the value of the numerical\nresistivity and the numerical viscosity of any Eulerian MHD code. We test this\nansatz with the help of simulations of the propagation of (magneto)sonic waves,\nAlfven waves, and the tearing mode instability using the MHD code Aenus. By\ncomparing the simu- lation results with analytical solutions of the\nresistive-viscous MHD equations and an empirical ansatz for the growth rate of\ntearing modes we measure the numerical viscosity and resistivity of Aenus. The\ncomparison shows that the fast-magnetosonic speed and wavelength are the\ncharacteristic velocity and length, respectively, of the aforementioned\n(relatively simple) systems. We also determine the dependance of the numerical\nviscosity and resistivity on the time integration method, the spatial\nreconstruction scheme and (to a lesser extent) the Riemann solver employed in\nthe simulations. From the measured results we infer the numerical resolution\n(as a function of the spatial reconstruction method) required to properly\nresolve the growth and saturation level of the magnetic field amplified by the\nmagnetorotational instability in the post-collapsed core of massive stars. Our\nresults show that it is to the best advantage to resort to ultra-high order\nmethods (e.g., 9th-order Monotonicity Preserving method) to tackle this problem\nproperly, in particular in three dimensional simulations.\n", "  An approach for relating the nucleon resonances extracted from $\\pi N$\nreaction data to lattice QCD calculations has been developed by using the\nfinite-volume Hamiltonian method. Within models of $\\pi N$ reactions, bare\nstates are introduced to parametrize the intrinsic excitations of the nucleon.\nWe show that the resonance pole positions can be related to the probability\n$P_{N^*}(E)$ of finding the bare state, $N^*$, in the $\\pi N$ scattering states\nin infinite volume. We further demonstrate that the probability $P_{N^*}^V(E)$\nof finding the same bare states in the eigenfunctions of the underlying\nHamiltonian in finite volume approaches $P_{N^*}(E)$ as the volume increases.\nOur findings suggest that the comparison of $P_{N^*}(E)$ and $P_{N^*}^V(E)$ can\nbe used to examine whether the nucleon resonances extracted from the $\\pi N$\nreaction data within the dynamical models are consistent with lattice QCD\ncalculation. We also discuss the measurement of $P_{N^*}^V(E)$ directly from\nlattice QCD. The practical differences between our approach and the approach\nusing the L\\\"uscher formalism to relate LQCD calculations to the nucleon\nresonance poles embedded in the data are also discussed.\n", "  We show that in AB stacked bilayer graphene low energy excitations around the\nsemimetallic points are described by massless, four dimensional Dirac fermions.\nThere is an effective reconstruction of the 4 dimensional spacetime, including\nin particular the dimension perpendicular to the sheet, that arises dynamically\nfrom the physical graphene sheet and the interactions experienced by the\ncarriers. The effective spacetime is the Eisenhart-Duval lift of the dynamics\nexperienced by Galilei invariant L\\'evy-Leblond spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ particles\nnear the Dirac points. We find that changing the intrinsic curvature of the\nbilayer sheet induces a change in the energy level of the electronic bands,\nswitching from a conducting regime for negative curvature to an insulating one\nwhen curvature is positive. In particular, curving graphene bilayers allows\nopening or closing the energy gap between conduction and valence bands, a key\neffect for electronic devices. Thus using curvature as a tunable parameter\nopens the way for the beginning of curvatronics in bilayer graphene.\n", "  The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) implies the existence of a\nphysical minimum length scale $l_m$. In this scenario, black holes must have a\nradius larger than $l_m$. They are hotter and evaporate faster than in standard\nHawking thermodynamics. We study the effects of the GUP on black hole\nproduction and decay at the LHC in models with large extra dimensions. Lower\nbounds on the fundamental Planck scale and the minimum black hole mass at\nformation are determined from black hole production cross section limits by the\nCMS Collaboration. The existence of a minimum length generally decreases the\nlower bounds on the fundamental Planck scale obtained in the absence of a\nminimum length.\n", "  We present a computational approach to infinite nuclear matter employing\nHartree-Fock theory, many-body perturbation theory and coupled cluster theory.\nThese lectures are closely linked with those of chapters 9, 10 and 11 and serve\nas input for the correlation functions employed in Monte Carlo calculations in\nchapter 9, the in-medium similarity renormalization group theory of dense\nfermionic systems of chapter 10 and the Green's function approach in chapter\n11. We provide extensive code examples and benchmark calculations, allowing\nthereby an eventual reader to start writing her/his own codes. We start with an\nobject-oriented serial code and end with discussions on strategies for porting\nthe code to present and planned high-performance computing facilities.\n", "  The electric dipole strength distribution in Ca-48 between 5 and 25 MeV has\nbeen determined at RCNP, Osaka, from proton inelastic scattering experiments at\nforward angles. Combined with photoabsorption data at higher excitation energy,\nthis enables for the first time the extraction of the electric dipole\npolarizability alpha_D(Ca-48) = 2.07(22) fm^3. Remarkably, the dipole response\nof Ca-48 is found to be very similar to that of Ca-40, consistent with a small\nneutron skin in Ca-48. The experimental results are in good agreement with ab\ninitio calculations based on chiral effective field theory interactions and\nwith state-of-the-art density-functional calculations, implying a neutron skin\nin Ca-48 of 0.14 - 0.20 fm.\n", "  Quantifying stochastic processes is essential to understand many natural\nphenomena, particularly in biology, including cell-fate decision in\ndevelopmental processes as well as genesis and progression of cancers. While\nvarious attempts have been made to construct potential landscape in high\ndimensional systems and to estimate rare transitions, they are practically\nlimited to cases where either noise is small or detailed balance condition\nholds. A general and practical approach to investigate nonequilibrium systems\ntypically subject to finite or large multiplicative noise and breakdown of\ndetailed balance remains elusive. Here, we formulate a computational framework\nto address this important problem. The current approach is based on a least\naction principle to efficiently calculate potential landscapes of systems under\narbitrary noise strength and without detailed balance. With the deterministic\nstability structure preserving A-type stochastic integration, the potential\nbarrier between different (local) stable stables is directly computable. We\ndemonstrate our approach in a numerically accurate manner through solvable\nexamples. We further apply the method to investigate the role of noise on tumor\nheterogeneity in a 38 dimensional network model for prostate cancer, and\nprovide a new strategy on controlling cell populations by manipulating noise\nstrength.\n", "  We show how to solve the Dirac oscillator with a minimal length by using\nprevious results on the harmonic oscillator in a Snyder algebra.\n", "  It was shown via numerical simulations that geometric phase (GP) and fidelity\nsusceptibility (FS) in some quantum models exhibit universal scaling laws\nacross phase transition points. Here we propose a singular function expansion\nmethod to determine their exact form across the critical points as well as\ntheir corresponding constants. For the models such as anisotropic XY model\nwhere the energy gap is closed and reopened at the special points ($k_0 = 0,\n\\pi$), scaling laws can be found as a function of system length $N$ and\nparameter deviation $\\lambda - \\lambda_c$ (where $\\lambda_c$ is the critical\nparameter). Intimate relations for the coefficients in GP and FS have also been\ndetermined. However in the extended models where the gap is not closed and\nreopened at these special points, the scaling as a function of system length\n$N$ breaks down. We also show that the second order derivative of GP also\nexhibits some intriguing scaling laws across the critical points. These exact\nresults can greatly enrich our understanding of GP and FS in the\ncharacterization of quantum phase transitions.\n", "  We explore, both experimentally and theoretically, the propagation dynamics\nof spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons). Characterization of\nentanglement is done via the Schmidt number, which is a universal measurement\nof the degree of entanglement directly related to the non-separability of the\nstate into its subsystems. We develop expressions for the terms of the Schmidt\nnumber that depend on the amplitude and phase of the commonly used\ndouble-Gaussian approximation for the biphoton wave function, and demonstrate\nmigration of entanglement between amplitude and phase upon propagation. We then\nextend this analysis to incorporate both phase curvature in the pump beam and\nhigher spatial frequency content of more realistic non-Gaussian wave functions.\nSpecifically, we generalize the classical beam quality parameter M2 to the\nbiphotons, allowing the description of more information-rich beams and more\ncomplex dynamics. Agreement is found with experimental measurements using\ndirect imaging and Fourier optics.\n", "  We give an exact formulation for the transport coefficients of incommensurate\ntwo-dimensional atomic multilayer systems in the tight-binding approximation.\nThis formulation is based upon the C* algebra framework introduced by\nBellissard and collaborators to study aperiodic solids (disordered crystals,\nquasicrystals, and amorphous materials), notably in the presence of magnetic\nfields (quantum Hall effect). We also present numerical approximations and test\nour methods on a one-dimensional incommensurate bilayer system.\n", "  We analyze in detail the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of two\ndifferent stellar populations in Andromeda II (And II) dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\nWe obtained their detailed surface density maps, together with their radial\ndensity profiles. The two populations differ not only in age and metallicity,\nbut also in their spatial distribution and kinematics. Old stars ($\\gtrsim 11$\nGyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles.\nThese stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with\nline-of-sight velocities $v_{los}(r_h) = 16 \\pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity\ngradient of $2.06 \\pm 0.21$ km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$. Intermediate-age stars\n($\\lesssim 9$ Gyr) concentrate in the centre of the galaxy and form an\nelongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. This\nstructure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of $2.24 \\pm 0.22$ km\ns$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$, and around the optical minor axis. The centres of\nrotation and kinetic position angles (PA$_{\\rm kin}$) of both populations\ndiffer. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PA$_{\\rm kin} = 18^\\circ \\pm\n2^\\circ$ and for the old ones PA$_{\\rm kin} = 63^\\circ \\pm 3^\\circ$ in good\nagreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry.\nWe conclude that the two stellar populations may not be fully relaxed and thus\nbe the result of a merger occurred at redshift $z\\sim 1.75$.\n", "  The acoustic radiation force exerted on a small sphere located at the focus\nof an ultrasonic beam is measured in a soft gel. It is proved to evolve\nquadratically with the local amplitude of the acoustic field. Strong\noscillations of the local pressure are observed and attributed to an acoustic\nFabry-P{\\'e}rot effect between the ultrasonic emitter and the sphere. Taking\nthis effect into account with a simple model, a quantitative link between the\nradiation force and the acoustic pressure is proposed and compared to\ntheoretical predictions in the absence of dissipation. The discrepancy between\nexperiment and theory suggests that dissipative effects should be taken into\naccount for fully modeling the observations.\n", "  Extremely wide binary stars represent ideal systems to probe Newtonian\ndynamics in the low acceleration regimes (<10e-10 m/s/s) typical of the\nexternal regions of galaxies. Here we present a study of 60 alleged wide binary\nstars with projected separation ranging from 0.004 to 1 pc, probing\ngravitational accelerations well below the limit were dark matter or modified\ndynamics theories set in. Radial velocities with accuracy ~100 m/s were\nobtained for each star, in order to constrain their orbital velocity, that,\ntogether with proper motion data, can distinguish bound from unbound systems.\nIt was found that about half of the observed pairs do have velocity in the\nexpected range for bound systems, out to the largest separations probed here.\nIn particular, we identified five pairs with projected separation >0.15 pc that\nare useful for the proposed test. While it would be premature to draw any\nconclusion about the validity of Newtonian dynamics at these low accelerations,\nour main result is that very wide binary stars seem to exist in the harsh\nenvironment of the solar neighborhood. This could provide a tool to test\nNewtonian dynamics versus modified dynamics theories in the low acceleration\nconditions typical of galaxies. In the near future the GAIA satellite will\nprovide data to increase significantly the number of wide pairs that, with the\nappropriate follow up spectroscopic observations, will allow the implementation\nof this experiment with unprecedented accuracy.\n", "  We introduce the Gaussian Mixture full Photometric Red sequence Cluster\nCharacteriser (GMPhoRCC), an algorithm for determining the redshift and\nrichness of a galaxy cluster candidate. By using data from a multi-band sky\nsurvey with photometric redshifts, a red sequence colour magnitude relation\n(CMR) is isolated and modelled and used to characterise the optical properties\nof the candidate. GMPhoRCC provides significant advantages over existing\nmethods including, treatment of multi-modal distributions, variable width full\nCMR red sequence, richness extrapolation and quality control in order to\nalgorithmically identify catastrophic failures. We present redshift comparisons\nfor clusters from the GMBCG, NORAS, REFLEX and XCS catalogues, where the\nGMPhoRCC estimates are in excellent agreement with spectra, showing accurate,\nunbiased results with low scatter ($\\sigma_{\\delta z / (1+z)} \\sim 0.014$). We\nconclude with the evaluation of GMPhoRCC performance using empirical Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) like mock galaxy clusters. GMPhoRCC is shown to\nproduce highly pure characterisations with very low probabilities ($<1\\%$) of\nspurious, clean characterisations. In addition GMPhoRCC is shown to demonstrate\nhigh rates of completeness with respect to recovering redshift, richness and\ncorrectly identifying the BCG.\n", "  Gel-immobilized colloidal crystals were prepared to obtain hybrid\nplasmonic-photonic crystals, in which electric field enhancement to a greater\nextent than that due to localized surface plasmons (LSP) alone was expected due\nto coupling between LSP and the photonic band. Polystyrene colloidal crystals\nimmobilized by the N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide gel were immersed in an aqueous\ndispersion of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Then, the gel-immobilized colloidal\ncrystals were picked out and immersed in an ionic liquid mixture. The surfaces\nof the gel-immobilized colloidal crystals immersed in the AuNP dispersion were\nobserved via scanning electron microscopy after this solvent substitution. The\nlattice spacing of the colloidal crystal varied as the composition of the ionic\nliquid mixture was changed. The composition was determined so that the photonic\nband gap wavelength coincided with the LSP wavelength. Further, the reflection\nspectra were measured. Thus, we successfully prepared a hybrid\nplasmonic-photonic crystal.\n", "  The $sp(2M)$ invariant unfolded system is considered in the periodic\ntwistor-like spinor space. Complete set of non-trivial charges corresponding to\nthe global symmetry compatible with the periodicity conditions is constructed.\nResidual infinite-dimensional symmetry is realized in terms of the star-product\nalgebra. It is shown that charges associated with integrations over different\ncycles are related by particular higher-spin symmetry transformations.\n", "  It is shown that black hole spacetimes in classical Einstein gravity are\ncharacterized by, in addition to their ADM mass $M$, momentum $\\vec P$, angular\nmomentum $\\vec J$ and boost charge $\\vec K$, an infinite head of\nsupertranslation hair. The distinct black holes are distinguished by classical\nsuperrotation charges measured at infinity. Solutions with supertranslation\nhair are diffeomorphic to the Schwarzschild spacetime, but the diffeomorphisms\nare part of the BMS subgroup and act nontrivially on the physical phase space.\nIt is shown that a black hole can be supertranslated by throwing in an\nasymmetric shock wave. A leading-order Bondi-gauge expression is derived for\nthe linearized horizon supertranslation charge and shown to generate, via the\nDirac bracket, supertranslations on the linearized phase space of gravitational\nexcitations of the horizon. The considerations of this paper are largely\nclassical augmented by comments on their implications for the quantum theory.\n", "  We investigate the simultaneous triggering of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in\nmerging galaxies, using a large suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We compute dual-AGN observability time-scales using bolometric,\nX-ray, and Eddington-ratio thresholds, confirming that dual activity from\nsupermassive black holes (BHs) is generally higher at late pericentric\npassages, before a merger remnant has formed, especially at high luminosities.\nFor typical minor and major mergers, dual activity lasts ~20-70 and ~100-160\nMyr, respectively. We also explore the effects of X-ray obscuration from gas,\nfinding that the dual-AGN time decreases at most by a factor of ~2, and of\ncontamination from star formation. Using projected separations and velocity\ndifferences rather than three-dimensional quantities can decrease the dual-AGN\ntime-scales by up to ~4, and we apply filters which mimic current\nobservational-resolution limitations. In agreement with observations, we find\nthat, for a sample of major and minor mergers hosting at least one AGN, the\nfraction harbouring dual AGN is ~20-30 and ~1-10 per cent, respectively. We\nquantify the effects of merger mass ratio (0.1 to 1), geometry (coplanar,\nprograde, retrograde, and inclined), disc gas fraction, and BH properties,\nfinding that the mass ratio is the most important factor, with the difference\nbetween minor and major mergers varying between factors of a few to orders of\nmagnitude, depending on the luminosity and filter used. We also find that a\nshallow imaging survey will require very high angular resolution, whereas a\ndeep imaging survey will be less resolution-dependent.\n", "  Here are reviewed the insights from observations at optical and infrared\nwavelengths for low mass limits above which stars do not seem to end as\nluminous supernovae. These insights are: (1) the absence in archived images of\nnearby galaxies of stellar progenitors of core-collapse supernovae above 16-18\nsolar masses, (2) the identification of luminous-massive stars that quietly\ndisappear without optically bright supernovae, (3) the absence in the nebular\nspectra of supernovae of type II-P of the nucleosynthetic products expected\nfrom progenitors above 20 solar masses, (4) the absence in color magnitude\ndiagrams of stars in the environment of historic core-collapse supernovae of\nstars with >20 solar masses. From the results in these different areas of\nobservational astrophysics, and the recently confirmed dependence of black hole\nformation on metallicity and redshift of progenitors, it is concluded that a\nlarge fraction of massive stellar binaries in the universe end as binary black\nholes.\n", "  Binary black holes as the recently detected sources of gravitational waves\ncan be formed from massive stellar binaries in the field or by dynamical\ninteractions in clusters of high stellar density, if the black holes are the\nremnants of massive stars that collapsed without natal kicks that would disrupt\nthe binary system or eject the black holes from the cluster before binary black\nhole formation. Here are summarized and discussed the kinematics in three\ndimensions of space of five Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. For Cygnus X-1\nand GRS 1915+105 it is found that the black holes of ~15 and ~10 solar masses\nin these sources were formed in situ, without energetic kicks. These\nobservations suggest that binary black holes with components of ~10 solar\nmasses may have been prolifically produced in the universe.\n", "  Two modes of star formation are involved to explain the origin of young stars\nnear Sgr A*. One is a disk-based mode, which explains the disk of stars\norbiting Sgr A*. The other is the standard cloud-based mode observed in the\nGalactic disk. We discuss each of these modes of star formation and apply these\nideas to the inner few parsecs of Sgr A*. In particular, we focus on the latter\nmode in more detail. We also discuss how the tidal force exerted by the nuclear\ncluster makes the Roche density approaching zero and contributes to the\ncollapse of molecular clouds located tens of parsecs away from Sgr A*.\n", "  The Blandford-Znajek process, the steady electromagnetic energy extraction\nfrom a rotating black hole, is widely believed to work for driving relativistic\njets, although it is still under debate where the electric current is driven.\nWe address this issue analytically by investigating the time-dependent state in\nthe Boyer-Lindquist and Kerr-Schild coordinate systems. This analysis suggests\nthat a non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic region is required in the time-dependent\nstate, while not in the steady state.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks (PPDs) accrete onto their central T Tauri star via\nmagnetic stresses. When the effect of ambipolar diffusion (AD) is included, and\nin the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the disk remains laminar between\n1-5 au, and a magnetocentrifugal disk wind forms that provides an important\nmechanism for removing angular momentum. We present global MHD simulations of\nPPDs that include Ohmic resistivity and AD, where the time-dependent gas-phase\nelectron and ion fractions are computed under FUV and X-ray ionization with a\nsimplified recombination chemistry. To investigate whether the mass loading of\nthe wind is potentially affected by the limited vertical extent of our existing\nsimulations, we attempt to develop a model of a realistic disk atmosphere. To\nthis end, by accounting for stellar irradiation and diffuse reprocessing of\nradiation, we aim at improving our models towards more realistic thermodynamic\nproperties.\n", "  Understanding the dynamic processes of a real game system requires an\nappropriate dynamics model, and rigorously testing a dynamics model is\nnon-trivial. In our methodological research, we develop an approach to testing\nthe validity of game dynamics models that considers the dynamic patterns of\nangular momentum and speed as measurement variables. Using Rock-Paper-Scissors\n(RPS) games as an example, we illustrate the geometric patterns in the\nexperiment data. We then derive the related theoretical patterns from a series\nof typical dynamics models. By testing the goodness-of-fit between the\nexperimental and theoretical patterns, we show that the validity of these\nmodels can be evaluated quantitatively. Our approach establishes a link between\ndynamics models and experimental systems, which is, to the best of our\nknowledge, the most effective and rigorous strategy for ascertaining the\ntestability of evolutionary game dynamics models.\n", "  We present the science cases and technological discussions that came from the\nworkshop entitled \"Finding the UV-Visible Path Forward\" held at NASA GSFC June\n25-26, 2015. The material presented outlines the compelling science that can be\nenabled by a next generation space-based observatory dedicated for UV-visible\nscience, the technologies that are available to include in that observatory\ndesign, and the range of possible alternative launch approaches that could also\nenable some of the science. The recommendations to the Cosmic Origins Program\nAnalysis Group from the workshop attendees on possible future development\ndirections are outlined.\n", "  We report a measurement of the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) lensing from two seasons of Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter\n(ACTPol) CMB data. The CMB lensing power spectrum is extracted from both\ntemperature and polarization data using quadratic estimators. We obtain results\nthat are consistent with the expectation from the best-fit Planck LCDM model\nover a range of multipoles L=80-2100, with an amplitude of lensing A_lens =\n1.06 +/- 0.15 (stat.) +/- 0.06 (sys.) relative to Planck. Our measurement of\nthe CMB lensing power spectrum gives sigma_8 Omega_m^0.25 = 0.643 +/- 0.054;\nincluding baryon acoustic oscillation scale data, we constrain the amplitude of\ndensity fluctuations to be sigma_8 = 0.831 +/- 0.053. We also update\nconstraints on the neutrino mass sum. We verify our lensing measurement with a\nnumber of null tests and systematic checks, finding no evidence of significant\nsystematic errors. This measurement relies on a small fraction of the ACTPol\ndata already taken; more precise lensing results can therefore be expected from\nthe full ACTPol dataset.\n", "  When a star gets tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole, its magnetic\nfield is expected to pervade its debris. In this paper, we study this process\nvia smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the disruption and\nearly debris evolution including the stellar magnetic field. As the gas\nstretches into a stream, we show that the magnetic field evolution is strongly\ndependent on its orientation with respect to the stretching direction. In\nparticular, an alignment of the field lines with the direction of stretching\ninduces an increase of the magnetic energy. For disruptions happening well\nwithin the tidal radius, the star compression causes the magnetic field\nstrength to sharply increase by an order of magnitude at the time of pericentre\npassage. If the disruption is partial, we find evidence for a dynamo process\noccurring inside the surviving core due to the formation of vortices. This\ncauses an amplification of the magnetic field strength by a factor of $\\sim\n10$. However, this value represents a lower limit since it increases with\nnumerical resolution. For an initial field strength of 1 G, the magnetic field\nnever becomes dynamically important. Instead, the disruption of a star with a\nstrong 1 MG magnetic field produces a debris stream within which magnetic\npressure becomes similar to gas pressure a few tens of hours after disruption.\nIf the remnant of one or multiple partial disruptions is eventually fully\ndisrupted, its magnetic field could be large enough to magnetically power the\nrelativistic jet detected from Swift J1644+57. Magnetized streams could also be\nsignificantly thickened by magnetic pressure when it overcomes the confining\neffect of self-gravity.\n", "  The statistics of rotational motion of small, inertialess triaxial ellipsoids\nare computed along Lagrangian trajectories extracted from direct numerical\nsimulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The particle angular velocity\nand its components along the three principal axes of the particle are\nconsidered, expanding on the results presented by \\citet{ChevillardMeneveau13}.\nThe variance of the particle angular velocity, referred to as the particle\nenstrophy, is found to increase for particles with elongated shapes. This trend\nis explained by considering the contributions of vorticity and strain-rate to\nparticle rotation. It is found that the majority of particle enstrophy is due\nto fluid vorticity. Strain-rate-induced rotations, which are sensitive to\nshape, are mostly cancelled by strain-vorticity interactions. The remainder of\nthe strain-rate-induced rotations are responsible for weak variations in\nparticle enstrophy. For particles of all shapes, the majority of the enstrophy\nis in rotations about the longest axis, which is due to alignment between the\nlongest axis and fluid vorticity. The integral timescale for particle angular\nvelocities about each axis reveals that rotations are most persistent about the\nlongest axis, but that a full revolution is rare.\n", "  In this review presented at the Royal Society meeting, \"Cometary Science\nAfter Rosetta\", I present an overview of studies of small solar system objects\nthat exhibit properties of both asteroids and comets (with a focus on so-called\nactive asteroids). Sometimes referred to as \"transition objects\", these bodies\nare perhaps more appropriately described as \"continuum objects\", to reflect the\nnotion that rather than necessarily representing actual transitional\nevolutionary states between asteroids and comets, they simply belong to the\ngeneral population of small solar system bodies that happen to exhibit a\ncontinuous range of observational, physical, and dynamical properties.\nContinuum objects are intriguing because they possess many of the properties\nthat make classical comets interesting to study (e.g., relatively primitive\ncompositions, ejection of surface and subsurface material into space where it\ncan be more easily studied, and orbital properties that allow us to sample\nmaterial from distant parts of the solar system that would otherwise be\ninaccessible), while allowing us to study regions of the solar system that are\nnot sampled by classical comets.\n", "  In this paper we simulate the emission by charged particles in complex\nstructures with help of Geant4. We take into account Cherenkov radiation,\ntransition radiation, bremsstrahlung, pair production and other accompanying\nprocesses. As an application we investigate the full size electromagnetic\ncalorimeter for the muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab. A calorimeter module (24\nare expected in the experiment) consists of a Delrin front panel for\ninstallation of the laser calibration system, 54 PbF2 Cherenkov crystals\nwrapped by the black Millipore paper, and silicon photo-multiplier sensors. We\nreport here on a simulation of radiation from positrons passing through the\ncalorimeter system. We carry out the simulation using Geant4 toolkit, which\nprovides a complete set of tools for all areas of detector simulation:\ngeometry, tracking, detector response, run, event and track management, and\nvisualization. We consider Cherenkov photons expansion when a positron moves\ndown through the calorimeter at the arbitrary angle of incidence. Both spectral\nand angular distributions of Cherenkov optical photons in different parts of\nthe calorimeter system have been evaluated as well as the transition radiation\nand pre-shower distributions from the panel and from the Al vacuum chamber of\nthe storage ring. (The paper is in progress).\n", "  V1017 Sgr is a classical nova (in 1919) that displayed an earlier dwarf nova\neruption (in 1901), and two more dwarf nova events (in 1973 and 1991). Previous\nwork on this bright system in quiescence (V=13.5) has only been a few isolated\nmagnitudes, a few spectra, and an ambiguous claim for an orbital period of\n5.714 days as based on nine radial velocities. To test this period, we have\ncollected 2896 magnitudes (plus 53 in the literature) in the UBVRIJHKL bands\nfrom 1897 to 2016, making an essentially complete photometric history of this\nunique cataclysmic variable. We find that the light curve in all bands is\ndominated by the ellipsoidal modulations of a G giant companion star, with a\npost-eruption (after the 1919 nova event) orbital period of 5.786290 +-\n0.000032 days. This is the longest period for any classical nova, the accretion\nmust be powered by the nuclear evolution of the companion star, and the dwarf\nnova events occur only because the outer parts of the large disk are cool\nenough to be unstable. Furthermore, we measure the pre-eruption orbital period\n(from 1907 to 1916), and there is a small steady period change in quiescence.\nThe orbital period has decreased by 273 +- 61 parts-per-million across the 1919\neruption, with the significance of the period change being at the 5.7-sigma\nconfidence level. This is startling and mystifying for nova-theory, because the\nthree known period change effects cannot account for a period decrease in V1017\nSgr, much less one of such a large size.\n", "  Cosmic acceleration is widely believed to require either a source of negative\npressure (i.e., dark energy), or a modification of gravity, which necessarily\nimplies new degrees of freedom beyond those of Einstein gravity. In this paper\nwe present a third possibility, using only dark matter and ordinary matter. The\nmechanism relies on the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter\nthrough an effective metric. Dark matter couples to an Einstein-frame metric,\nand experiences a matter-dominated, decelerating cosmology up to the present\ntime. Ordinary matter couples to an effective metric that depends also on the\nDM density, in such a way that it experiences late-time acceleration. Linear\ndensity perturbations are stable and propagate with arbitrarily small sound\nspeed, at least in the case of `pressure' coupling. Assuming a simple\nparametrization of the effective metric, we show that our model can\nsuccessfully match a set of basic cosmological observables, including\nluminosity distance, BAO measurements, angular-diameter distance to last\nscattering {\\it etc.} For the growth history of density perturbations, we find\nan intriguing connection between the growth factor and the Hubble constant. To\nget a growth history similar to the $\\Lambda$CDM prediction, our model predicts\na higher $H_0$, closer to the value preferred by direct estimates. On the flip\nside, we tend to overpredict the growth of structures whenever $H_0$ is\ncomparable to the Planck preferred value. The model also tends to predict\nlarger redshift-space distortions at low redshift than $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Energy dissipation is an unavoidable phenomenon of physical systems that are\ndirectly coupled to an external environmental bath. The ability to engineer the\nprocesses responsible for dissipation and coupling is fundamental to manipulate\nthe state of such systems. This is particularly important in oscillatory states\nwhose dynamic response is used for many applications, e.g. micro and\nnano-mechanical resonators or sensing and timing, qubits for quantum\nengineering, and vibrational modes for optomechanical devices. In situations\nwhere stable oscillations are required, the energy dissipated by the\nvibrational modes is usually compensated by replenishment from external energy\nsources. Consequently, if the external energy supply is removed, the amplitude\nof oscillations start to decay immediately, since there is no means to\nrestitute the energy dissipated. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to\nmaintain stable oscillations, i.e. with constant amplitude and frequency,\nwithout supplying external energy to compensate losses. The fundamental\nintrinsic mechanism of mode coupling is used to redistribute and store\nmechanical energy among vibrational modes and coherently transfer it back to\nthe principal mode when the external excitation is off. To experimentally\ndemonstrate this phenomenon that defies physical intuition, we exploit the\nnonlinear dynamic response of microelectromechanical (MEMS) oscillators to\ncouple two different vibrational modes through an internal resonance. Since the\nunderlying mechanism describing the fundamentals of this new phenomenon is\ngeneric and representative of a large variety of systems, the presented method\nprovides a new dissipation engineering strategy that would enable a new\ngeneration of autonomous devices.\n", "  The performance of the ultraviolet telescope (UVIT) on-board ASTROSAT is\nreported. The performance in orbit is also compared with estimates made from\nthe calibrations done on the ground. The sensitivity is found to be within ~15%\nof the estimates, and the spatial resolution in the NUV is found to exceed\nsignificantly the design value of 1.8 arcsec and it is marginally better in the\nFUV. Images obtained from UVIT are presented to illustrate the details revealed\nby the high spatial resolution. The potential of multi-band observations in the\nultraviolet with high spatial resolution is illustrated by some results.\n", "  Using a novel Se-labelled dimer mixed with DTC5C7 aligned by magnetic field,\nthe twist-bend nematic phase (Ntb) in dimers was studied by hard X-ray resonant\nscattering and by small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS). Resonant\ndiffraction spots indicated a helix with a 9-12 nm pitch in the Ntb phase.\nUnprecedentedly high helix orien-tation enabled deconvolution of global and\nlocal order parameters. This, combined with simultaneous resonant and\nnon-resonant SAXS and WAXS data, allowed us to construct a modified model of\nthe Ntb phase matching twisted molecular conformations and the local\nheliconical director field.\n", "  A high-brilliance ($\\sim10^{24}$~photon.s$^{-1}$.mm$^{-2}$.mrd$^{-2}$/0.1\\%)\ngamma-ray source experiment is currently being planned at Fermilab\n($E_\\gamma\\simeq 1.1$~MeV)~[1]. The source implements a high-repetition-rate\ninverse Compton scattering by colliding electron bunches formed in a 300-MeV\nsuperconducting linac with a high-intensity laser pulse. This paper describes\nthe design rationale along with some of technical challenges associated to\nproducing high-repetition-rate collision. The expected performances of the\ngamma-ray source are also presented.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenids (TMDs) feature valley degree of\nfreedom, giant spin-orbit coupling and spin-valley locking. These exotic\nnatures stimulate efforts of exploring the potential applications in conceptual\nspintronics, valleytronics and quantum computing. Among all the exotic\ndirections, a long lifetime of spin and/or valley polarization is critical. The\npresent valley dynamics studies concentrate on the band edge excitons which\npredominates the optical response due to the enhanced Coulomb interaction in\ntwo dimensions. The valley lifetime of free carriers remains in ambiguity. In\nthis work, we use time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy to probe the valley\ndynamics of excitons and free carriers in monolayer tungsten diselinide. The\nvalley lifetime of free carriers is found around 2 ns at 70 K, about 3 orders\nof magnitude longer than the excitons of about 2 ps. The extended valley\nlifetime of free carriers evidences that exchange interaction dominates the\nvalley relaxation in optical excitation. The pump-probe spectroscopy also\nreveals the exciton binding energy of 0.60 eV in monolayer WSe2.\n", "  We report a novel method for evaluating the energy spectrum of electrons\nemitting hard x-rays and gamma-rays in undulators and Compton sources. The\nmethod takes into account the quantum nature of recoils undergone by the\nelectrons emitting high energy photons. The method is susceptible to evaluate a\nspectrum of electrons for the whole range of the emission rates per\nelectron-pass through of the driving force, from much less than one emitted\nphoton on average (Compton sources and short undulators) to many emitted\nphotons (long undulators, relatively low-energy electrons). As shown in the\nformer limiting case, the spectrum of electrons reflects the spectrum of\nemitted radiation whereas it is close to the Gaussian shape in the latter case.\nLimitation of coherency for the sources of high-energy electromagnetic\nradiation caused by recoils from emitted photons is also discussed.\n", "  For the first time, we apply the temperature dependent relativistic mean\nfield (TRMF) model to study the ternary fission of heavy nucleus using level\ndensity approach. The probability of yields of a particular fragment is\nobtained by evaluating the convolution integrals which employ the excitation\nenergy and the level density parameter for a given temperature calculated\nwithin the TRMF formalism. To illustrate, we have considered the ternary\nfissions in 252Cf, 242Pu and 236U with fixed third fragment A3 = 48Ca, 20O and\n16O respectively. The relative yields are studied for the temperatures T = 1, 2\nand 3 MeV. For the comparison, the relative yields are also calculated from the\nsingle particle energies of the finite range droplet model (FRDM). In general,\nthe larger phase space for the ternary fragmentation is observed indicating\nthat such fragmentations are most probable ones. For T = 2 and 3 MeV, the Sn +\nNi + Ca is the most probable combination for the nucleus 252Cf. However, for\nthe nuclei 242Pu and 236U, the maximum fragmentation yields at T = 2 MeV differ\nfrom those at T = 3 MeV. For T = 3 MeV, the closed shell (Z = 8) light mass\nfragments with its corresponding partners has larger yield values. But, at T =\n2 MeV Si/P/S are favorable fragments with the corresponding partners. It is\nnoticed that the symmetric binary fragmentation along with the fixed third\nfragment for 242Pu and 236U are also favored at T = 1 MeV. The temperature\ndependence of the nuclear shape and the single particle energies are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We show how to construct seven-dimensional half-maximally supersymmetric\nconsistent truncations of 11-/10-dimensional SUGRA using $\\mathrm{SL}(5)$\nexceptional field theory. Such truncations are defined on generalised\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure manifolds and give rise to seven-dimensional\nhalf-maximal gauged supergravities coupled to $n$ vector multiplets and thus\nwith scalar coset space $\\mathbb{R}^+ \\times\n\\mathrm{O}(3,n)/\\mathrm{O}(3)\\times\\mathrm{O}(n)$. The consistency conditions\nfor the truncation can be written in terms of the generalised Lie derivative\nand take a simple geometric form. We show that after imposing certain \"doublet\"\nand \"closure\" conditions, the embedding tensor of the gauged supergravity is\ngiven by the intrinsic torsion of generalised $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-connections and\nautomatically satisfies the linear constraint of seven-dimensional half-maximal\ngauged supergravities, as well as the quadratic constraint when the section\ncondition is satisfied.\n", "  Quantum friction, the electromagnetic fluctuation-induced frictional force\ndecelerating an atom which moves past a macroscopic dielectric body, has so far\neluded experimental evidence despite more than three decades of theoretical\nstudies. Inspired by the recent finding that dynamical corrections to such an\natom's internal dynamics are enhanced by one order of magnitude for vertical\nmotion -- compared to the paradigmatic setup of parallel motion -- we\ngeneralize quantum friction calculations to arbitrary angles between the atom's\ndirection of motion and the surface in front of which it moves. Motivated by\nthe disagreement between quantum friction calculations based on Markovian\nquantum master equations and time-dependent perturbation theory, we carry out\nour derivations of the quantum frictional force for arbitrary angles employing\nboth methods and compare them.\n", "  Thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are bright stellar explosions, the light\ncurves of which can be calibrated to allow for use as \"standard candles\" for\nmeasuring cosmological distances. Contemporary research investigates how the\nbrightness of an event may be influenced by properties of the progenitor system\nthat follow from properties of the host galaxy such as composition and age. The\ngoals are to better understand systematic effects and to assess the intrinsic\nscatter in the brightness, thereby reducing uncertainties in cosmological\nstudies. We present the results from ensembles of simulations in the\nsingle-degenerate paradigm addressing the influence of age and metallicity on\nthe brightness of an event and compare our results to observed variations of\nbrightness that correlate with properties of the host galaxy. We also present\nresults from \"hybrid\" progenitor models that incorporate recent advances in\nstellar evolution.\n", "  The differential cross section for elastic scattering of protons on electrons\nat rest is calculated taking into account the QED radiative corrections to the\nleptonic part of interaction. These model-independent radiative corrections\narise due to emission of the virtual and real soft and hard photons as well as\nto vacuum polarization. We analyze an experimental setup when both the final\nparticles are recorded in coincidence and their energies are determined within\nsome uncertainties. The kinematics, the cross section, and the radiative\ncorrections are calculated and numerical results are presented.\n", "  We propose a method of trapping atoms in arrays near to the surface of a\ncomposite nanophotonic device with optimal coupling to a single cavity mode.\nThe device, comprised of a nanofiber mounted on a grating, allows the formation\nof periodic optical trapping potentials near to the nanofiber surface along\nwith a high cooperativity nanofiber cavity. We model the device analytically\nand find good agreement with numerical simulations. We numerically demonstrate\nthat for an experimentally realistic device, an array of traps can be formed\nwhose centers coincide with the antinodes of a single cavity mode, guaranteeing\noptimal coupling to the cavity. Additionally, we simulate a trap suitable for a\nsingle atom within 100 nm of the fiber surface, potentially allowing larger\ncoupling to the nanofiber than found using typical guided mode trapping\ntechniques.\n", "  This paper summarises the potential of the LISA mission to constrain the\nexpansion history of the universe using massive black hole binary mergers as\ngravitational wave standard sirens. After briefly reviewing the concept of\nstandard siren, the analysis and methodologies of Ref. [1] are briefly outlined\nto show how LISA can be used as a cosmological probe, while a selection of\nresults taken from Refs. [1,2] is presented in order to estimate the power of\nLISA in constraining cosmological parameters.\n", "  We discuss the problem of polarized radiative transfer in general relativity.\nWe present a set of equations suitable for solving the problem numerically for\nthe case of an arbitrary space-time metric, and show numerical solutions to\nexample problems. The solutions are computed with a new ray-tracing code,\nArcmancer, developed by the authors.\n", "  Using the Eris zoom-in cosmological simulation of assembly of a Milky Way\nanalog, we study chemical enrichment of stars due to accretion of\nmetal-enriched gas from the interstellar medium during the Galaxy's\ndevelopment. We consider metal-poor and old stars in both Galactic halo and\nbulge and make use of stellar orbits, gas density and metallicity distributions\nin Eris. Assuming spherically symmetric Bondi-Hoyle accretion, we find that\nhalo and bulge stars accrete metals at the rate of about 10^-24 solar mass per\nyear and 10^-22 solar mass per year, respectively, at redshifts z < 3, but this\naccretion rate increases hundred-fold to about 10^-20 solar mass per year at\nhigher redshifts due to increased gas density. Bulge and halo stars accrete\nsimilar amounts of metals at high redshifts as kinematically distinct bulge and\nhalo are not yet developed at these redshifts and both sets of stars encounter\nsimilar metal distribution in the ISM on average. Accretion alone can enrich\nmain-sequence stars up to [Fe/H] -2 in extreme cases.Median enrichment level\ndue to accretion in these stars is about [Fe/H]~-6 to -5.Because accretion\nmostly takes place at high redshifts, it is alpha-enriched to [alpha/Fe]~0.5.\nWe find that accretive metal enrichment is significant enough to affect the\npredicted metallicity distribution function of halo stars at [Fe/H] < -5.This\nsuggests that attempts to infer the natal chemical environment of the most\nmetal-poor stars from their observed enrichment today can be hindered due to\nmetal accretion. Peculiar enrichment patterns such as those predicted to arise\nfrom pair-instability supernovae could help in disentangling natal and accreted\nmetal content of stars.\n", "  Solid-state emitters are excellent candidates for developing integrated\nsources of single photons. Yet, phonons degrade the photon indistinguishability\nboth through pure dephasing of the zero-phonon line and through phonon-assisted\nemission. Here, we study theoretically and experimentally the\nindistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot in a\nmicrocavity as a function of temperature. We show that a large coupling to a\nhigh quality factor cavity can simultaneously reduce the effect of both\nphonon-induced sources of decoherence. It first limits the effect of pure\ndephasing on the zero phonon line with indistinguishabilities above $97\\%$ up\nto $18$ K. Moreover, it efficiently redirects the phonon sidebands into the\nzero-phonon line and brings the indistinguishability of the full emission\nspectrum from $87\\%$ (resp. $24\\%$) without cavity effect to more than $99\\%$\n(resp. $76\\%$) at $0$ K (resp. $20$ K). We provide guidelines for optimal\ncavity designs that further minimize the phonon-induced decoherence.\n", "  We give a stochastic proof of the finite approximability of a class of\nSchr\u007f\\\"odinger operators over a local field, thereby completing a program of\nestablishing in a non-Archimedean setting corresponding results and methods\nfrom the Archimedean (real) setting. A key ingredient of our proof is to show\nthat Brownian motion over a local field can be obtained as a limit of random\nwalks over finite grids. Also, we prove a Feynman-Kac formula for the finite\nsystems, and show that the propagator at the finite level converges to the\npropagator at the infinite level.\n", "  We investigate the stability of highly charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nholes to charged scalar perturbations. We show that the near-horizon region\nexhibits a transient instability which becomes the Aretakis instability in the\nextremal limit. The rates we obtain match the enhanced rates for\nnonaxisymmetric perturbations of the near-extremal and extremal Kerr solutions.\nThe agreement is shown to arise from a shared near-horizon symmetry of the two\nscenarios.\n", "  We derive a monogamy inequality for entanglement and local contextuality, for\nany finite bipartite system. It essentially results from the relations between\nthe purity of a local state and the entanglement of the global state, and\nbetween the purity of a state and its ability to violate a given\nnoncontextuality inequality. We build an explicit entanglement monotone that\nsatisfies the found monogamy inequality. An important consequence of this\ninequality, is that there are global states too entangled to violate the local\nnoncontextuality inequality.\n", "  The standard map, paradigmatic conservative system in the $(x,p)$ phase\nspace, has been recently shown to exhibit interesting statistical behaviors\ndirectly related to the value of the standard map parameter $K$. A detailed\nnumerical description is achieved in the present paper. More precisely, for\nlarge values of $K$, the Lyapunov exponents are neatly positive over virtually\nthe entire phase space, and, consistently with Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics,\nwe verify $q_{\\text{ent}}=q_{\\text{sen}}=q_{\\text{stat}}=q_{\\text{rel}}=1$,\nwhere $q_{\\text{ent}}$ is the $q$-index for which the nonadditive entropy $S_q\n\\equiv k \\frac{1-\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ (with $S_1=S_{BG} \\equiv\n-k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i$) grows linearly with time before achieving its\n$W$-dependent saturation value; $q_{\\text{sen}}$ characterizes the time\nincrease of the sensitivity $\\xi$ to the initial conditions, i.e., $\\xi \\sim\ne_{q_{\\text{sen}}}^{\\lambda_{q_{\\text{sen}}}\n\\,t}\\;(\\lambda_{q_{\\text{sen}}}>0)$, where $e_q^z \\equiv[1+(1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$;\n$q_{\\text{stat}}$ is the index associated with the $q_{\\text{stat}}$-Gaussian\ndistribution of the time average of successive iterations of the\n$x$-coordinate; finally, $q_{\\text{rel}}$ characterizes the\n$q_{\\text{rel}}$-exponential relaxation with time of the entropy\n$S_{q_{\\text{ent}}}$ towards its saturation value. In remarkable contrast, for\nsmall values of $K$, the Lyapunov exponents are virtually zero over the entire\nphase space, and, consistently with $q$-statistics, we verify\n$q_{\\text{ent}}=q_{\\text{sen}}=0$, $q_{\\text{stat}} \\simeq 1.935$, and\n$q_{\\text{rel}} \\simeq1.4$. The situation corresponding to intermediate values\nof $K$, where both stable orbits and a chaotic sea are present, is discussed as\nwell. The present results transparently illustrate when BG or $q$-statistical\nbehavior are observed.\n", "  We study a rotor-router version of the internal diffusion-limited aggregation\nintroduced by J.Propp. The existing estimations of boundary fluctuations of the\naggregation cluster show that they grow not faster than $O(\\log r)$ with the\ncluster radius $r$. We consider the rotor-router internal DLA on the\nsemi-infinite cylinder and prove a constant width of boundary fluctuations not\ndepending on the radius of the cylinder.\n", "  Brueckner theory is used to investigate the in-medium properties of a\n$\\Lambda$-hyperon in nuclear and neutron matter, based on hyperon-nucleon\ninteractions derived within SU(3) chiral effective field theory (EFT). It is\nshown that the resulting $\\Lambda$ single-particle potential\n$U_\\Lambda(p_\\Lambda =0,\\rho)$ becomes strongly repulsive for densities $\\rho$\nof two-to-three times that of normal nuclear matter. Adding a density-dependent\neffective $\\Lambda N$-interaction constructed from chiral $\\Lambda NN$\nthree-body forces increases the repulsion further. Consequences of these\nfindings for neutron stars are discussed. It is argued that for hyperon-nuclear\ninteractions with properties such as those deduced from the SU(3) EFT\npotentials, the onset for hyperon formation in the core of neutron stars is\nexpected to be shifted to extremely high baryon density, thus potentially\nresolving the so-called hyperon puzzle.\n", "  Anderson localization is a consequence of coherent interference of multiple\nscattering events in the presence of disorder, which leads to an exponential\nsuppression of the transmission. The decay of the transmission is typically\nprobed at a given energy or frequency. Here we show that this decay affects the\ndynamics of a qubit coupled to the disordered system and we express the\nrelaxation rate of the qubit in terms of the localization properties.\nConversely, adding static disorder to a channel coupled to a qubit will reduce\nthe decoherence rate of the qubit. Hence, when designing electrodes that couple\nto qubits it is possible to improve their performance by adding impurities to\nthe channel.\n", "  Cosmological defects result from cosmological phase transitions in the early\nUniverse and the dynamics reflects their symmetry-breaking mechanisms. These\ncosmological defects may be probed through weak lensing effects because they\ninteract with ordinary matters only through the gravitational force. In this\npaper, we investigate global textures by using weak lensing curl and B modes.\nNon-topological textures are modeled by the non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and\ninduce not only the scalar perturbation but also vector and tensor\nperturbations in the primordial plasma due to the nonlinearity in the\nanisotropic stress of scalar fields. We show angular power spectra of curl and\nB modes from both vector and tensor modes based on the NLSM. Furthermore, we\ngive the analytic estimations for curl and B mode power spectra. The amplitude\nof weak lensing signals depends on a combined parameter $\\epsilon^{2}_{v} =\nN^{-1}\\left( v/m_{\\rm pl} \\right)^{4}$ where $N$ and $v$ are the number of the\nscalar fields and the vacuum expectation value, respectively. We discuss the\ndetectability of the curl and B modes with several observation specifications.\nIn the case of the CMB lensing observation without including the instrumental\nnoise, we can reach $\\epsilon_{v} \\approx 2.7\\times 10^{-6}$. This constraint\nis about 10 times stronger than the current one determined from the Planck. For\nthe cosmic shear observation, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio depends on\nthe mean redshift and the observing number of galaxies as $\\propto z^{0.7}_{\\rm\nm}$ and $\\propto N^{0.2}_{\\rm g}$, respectively. In the study of textures using\ncosmic shear observations, the mean redshift would be one of the key design\nparameters.\n", "  Loop quantum cosmology predicts that quantum gravity effects resolve the\nbig-bang singularity and replace it by a cosmic bounce. Furthermore, loop\nquantum cosmology can also modify the form of primordial cosmological\nperturbations, for example by reducing power at large scales in inflationary\nmodels or by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the matter bounce\nscenario; these two effects are potential observational tests for loop quantum\ncosmology. In this article, I review these predictions and others, and also\nbriefly discuss three open problems in loop quantum cosmology: its relation to\nloop quantum gravity, the trans-Planckian problem, and a possible transition\nfrom a Lorentzian to a Euclidean space-time around the bounce point.\n", "  We discuss monolayer and bilayer quantum Hall systems in which each layer is\na half-filled Landau level (LL) system. In the mean field approximation of the\nSon's formalism there is a common pairing structure that underlines the\npossibilities for paired ground states in both systems. We argue that the\nparticle-hole (PH) Pfaffian state in the (particle-hole symmetric) half-filled\nLL of a monolayer, and analogous state in the PH symmetric bilayer (in which\neach layer is half-filled LL) can be considered as {\\em critical states} i.e.\nstates that cannot describe a phase under PH symmetry. We point out that the\ninclusion of a PH symmetry breaking (like LL mixing) may stabilize the PH\nPfaffian in a monolayer. In the bilayer case, in numerical experiments on a\nsphere, by choosing the PH symmetric shift, we can stabilize the interlayer\ncorrelated (111) excitonic state or critical state, for any distance between\nthe layers, but in general, with no bias, the evolution of the bilayer includes\nother phases.\n", "  Orientation effect of increasing the enhancement factor of DD reaction in\nCVD-Diamond was investigated by simulation. It is obtained that the flux\npeaking effect up to 2.2 times increases the relative enhancement factor for a\nparallel beam and up to 1.2 times for the deuteron beam with angular divergence\nequals 3 critical channeling angles. Qualitative agreement with the experiment\nwas obtained.\n", "  New exact solutions of Einstein's field equations (EFEs) by assuming linear\nequation of state, $ p_r = \\alpha (\\rho - \\rho_R) $ where $ p_r $ is the radial\npressure and $ \\rho_R $ is the surface density, are obtained on the background\nof a paraboloidal spacetime. By assuming estimated mass and radius of strange\nstar candidate 4U 1820-30, various physical and energy conditions are used for\nestimating the range of parameter $ \\alpha $. The suitability of the model for\ndescribing pulsars like PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1, Her X-1 and SAX J1804.3658 has\nbeen explored and respective ranges of $ \\alpha $, for which all physical and\nenergy conditions are satisfied throughout the distribution, are obtained.\n", "  Scalar-tensor gravitational theories are important extensions of standard\ngeneral relativity, which can explain both the initial inflationary evolution,\nas well as the late accelerating expansion of the Universe. In the present\npaper we investigate the cosmological solution of a scalar-tensor gravitational\ntheory, in which the scalar field $\\phi $ couples to the geometry via an\narbitrary function $F(\\phi $). The kinetic energy of the scalar field as well\nas its self-interaction potential $V(\\phi )$ are also included in the\ngravitational action. By using a standard mathematical procedure, the Lie group\napproach, and Noether symmetry techniques, we obtain several exact solutions of\nthe gravitational field equations describing the time evolutions of a flat\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker Universe in the framework of the scalar-tensor\ngravity. The obtained solutions can describe both accelerating and decelerating\nphases during the cosmological expansion of the Universe.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the generation of heralded bi-chromatic single\nphotons from an atomic collective spin excitation (CSE). The photon arrival\ntimes display collective quantum beats, a novel interference effect resulting\nfrom the relative motion of atoms in the CSE. A combination of\nvelocity-selective excitation with strong laser dressing and the addition of a\nmagnetic field allows for exquisite control of this collective beat phenomenon.\nThe present experiment uses a diamond scheme with near-IR photons that can be\nextended to include telecommunications-wavelengths or modified to allow storage\nand retrieval in an inverted-Y scheme.\n", "  We study the impact of a modified expansion rate on the dark matter relic\nabundance in a class of scalar-tensor theories. The scalar-tensor theories we\nconsider are motivated from string theory constructions, which have conformal\nas well as disformally coupled matter to the scalar. We investigate the effects\nof such a conformal coupling to the dark matter relic abundance for a wide\nrange of initial conditions, masses and cross-sections. We find that exploiting\nall possible initial conditions, the annihilation cross-section required to\nsatisfy the dark matter content can differ from the thermal average\ncross-section in the standard case. We also study the expansion rate in the\ndisformal case and find that physically relevant solutions require a nontrivial\nrelation between the conformal and disformal functions. We study the effects of\nthe disformal coupling in an explicit example where the disformal function is\nquadratic.\n", "  The promise of any small improvement in the performance of light-harvesting\ndevices, is sufficient to drive enormous experimental efforts. However these\nefforts are almost exclusively focused on enhancing the power conversion\nefficiency with specific material properties and harvesting layers thickness,\nwithout exploiting the correlations present in sunlight -- in part because such\ncorrelations are assumed to have negligible effect. Here we show, by contrast,\nthat these spatio-temporal correlations are sufficiently relevant that the use\nof specific detector geometries would significantly improve the performance of\nharvesting devices. The resulting increase in the absorption efficiency, as the\nprimary step of energy conversion, may also act as a potential driving\nmechanism for artificial photosynthetic systems. Our analysis presents design\nguidelines for optimal detector geometries with realistic incident intensities\nbased on current technological capabilities\n", "  We evaluate the electromagnetic $\\Xi_c \\gamma \\rightarrow\\Xi_c^\\prime$\ntransition on 2+1 flavor lattices corresponding to a pion mass of $\\sim 156$\nMeV. We extract the magnetic Sachs and Pauli form factors which give the\n$\\Xi_c$-$\\Xi_c^\\prime$ transition magnetic moment and the decay rates of\n$\\Xi_c^\\prime$ baryons. We did not find a signal for the magnetic form factor\nof the neutral transition $\\Xi_c^0 \\gamma \\rightarrow\\Xi_c^{\\prime 0}$, which\nis suppressed by the U-spin flavor symmetry. As a byproduct, we extract the\nmagnetic form factors and the magnetic moments of $\\Xi_c$ and $\\Xi_c^\\prime$\nbaryons, which give an insight to the dynamics of $u/d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks\nhaving masses at different scales.\n", "  The investigation of the role of finite groups in flavor physics and\nparticularly, in the interpretation of the neutrino data has been the subject\nof intensive research. Motivated by this fact, in this work we derive the\nthree-dimensional unitary representations of the projective linear group\nPSL_2(7). Based on the observation that the generators of the group exhibit a\nlatin square pattern, we use available computational packages on discrete\nalgebra to determine the generic properties of the group elements. We present\nanalytical expressions and discuss several examples which reproduce the\nneutrino mixing angles in accordance with the experimental data.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to obtain\nsolutions of classical hamiltonian systems that are either compatible with a\ncosymplectic or a contact structure. As it is well known, the first structure\nplays a central role in the theory of time-dependent hamiltonians, whilst the\nsecond is here used to treat classical hamiltonians including dissipation\nterms.\n  The interest of a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi equation is the primordial\nobservation that if a hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be projected into a\nconfiguration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the integral curves of\nthe projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$ can be transformed into integral curves\nof $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In\nthis way, we use the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to derive solutions of\nphysical systems with a time-dependent hamiltonian formulation or including\ndissipative terms. Explicit, new expressions for a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi\nequation are obtained on a cosymplectic and a contact manifold. These equations\nare later used to solve physical examples containing explicit time dependence,\nas it is the case of a unidimensional trigonometric system, and two dimensional\nnonlinear oscillators as Winternitz--Smorodinsky oscillators. For explicit\ndissipative behavior, we solve the example of a unidimensional damped\noscillator.\n", "  Na\\\"ive dimensional analysis seems to suggest possible unitarity violations\nin the framework of the Higgs and new Higgs inflationary scenarios. These\nviolations seem to happen around the value in which the potential energy, per\ngiven Higgs boson's vacuum expectation value, crosses the perturbative cut-off\nscale calculated around the electroweak vacuum. Conversely to these\nexpectations, in this paper we show that, by using an exact analysis of the\nbackground dependent cut-off scale, and by including the contribution of the\nphase-space volume in the perturbative scattering amplitudes, no violation of\n(perturbative) unitarity might ever happen during the whole Universe evolution.\n", "  A central problem in quantum field theory is the computation of scattering\namplitudes. However, traditional methods are impractical to calculate high\norder phenomenologically relevant observables. Building on a few decades of\nastonishing progress in developing non-standard computational techniques, it\nhas been recently conjectured that amplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills\nare given by the volume of the (dual) amplituhedron. After providing an\nintroduction to the subject at tree-level, we discuss a special class of\ndifferential equations obeyed by the corresponding volume forms. In particular,\nwe show how they fix completely the amplituhedron volume for next-to-maximally\nhelicity violating scattering amplitudes.\n", "  An appealing mechanism for inducing multiferroicity in materials is the\ngeneration of electric polarization by a spatially varying magnetization that\nis coupled to the lattice through the spin-orbit interaction. Here we describe\nthe reciprocal effect, in which a time-dependent electric polarization induces\nmagnetization even in materials with no existing spin structure. We develop a\nformalism for this dynamical multiferroic effect in the case for which the\npolarization derives from optical phonons, and compute the strength of the\nphonon Zeeman effect, which is the solid-state equivalent of the\nwell-established vibrational Zeeman effect in molecules, using density\nfunctional theory. We further show that a recently observed behavior -- the\nresonant excitation of a magnon by optically driven phonons -- is described by\nthe formalism. Finally, we discuss examples of scenarios that are not driven by\nlattice dynamics and interpret the excitation of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type\nelectromagnons and the inverse Faraday effect from the viewpoint of dynamical\nmultiferroicity.\n", "  The hidden Markov model (HMM) has been a workhorse of single molecule data\nanalysis and is now commonly used as a standalone tool in time series analysis\nor in conjunction with other analyses methods such as tracking. Here we provide\na conceptual introduction to an important generalization of the HMM which is\npoised to have a deep impact across Biophysics: the infinite hidden Markov\nmodel (iHMM). As a modeling tool, iHMMs can analyze sequential data without a\npriori setting a specific number of states as required for the traditional\n(finite) HMM. While the current literature on the iHMM is primarily intended\nfor audiences in Statistics, the idea is powerful and the iHMM's breadth in\napplicability outside Machine Learning and Data Science warrants a careful\nexposition. Here we explain the key ideas underlying the iHMM with a special\nemphasis on implementation and provide a description of a code we are making\nfreely available. In a companion article, we provide an important extension of\nthe iHMM to accommodate complications such as drift.\n", "  Bayesian nonparametric methods have recently transformed emerging areas\nwithin data science. One such promising method, the infinite hidden Markov\nmodel (iHMM), generalizes the HMM which itself has become a workhorse in single\nmolecule data analysis. The iHMM goes beyond the HMM by self-consistently\nlearning all parameters learned by the HMM in addition to learning the number\nof states without recourse to any model selection steps. Despite its\ngenerality, simple features (such as drift), common to single molecule time\ntraces, result in an over-interpretation of drift and the introduction of\nartifact states. Here we present an adaptation of the iHMM that can treat data\nwith drift originating from one or many traces (e.g. FRET). Our fully Bayesian\nmethod couples the iHMM to a continuous control process (drift)\nself-consistently learned while learning all other quantities determined by the\niHMM (including state numbers). A key advantage of this method is that all\ntraces -regardless of drift or states visited across traces- may now be treated\non an equal footing thereby eliminating user-dependent trace selection (based\non drift levels), pre-processing to remove drift and post-processing model\nselection on state number.\n", "  We study the long-time evolution of a quantum memory coupled to a bosonic\nenvironment on which quantum error correction (QEC) is performed using the\nsurface code. The memory's evolution encompasses $N$ QEC cycles, each of them\nyielding a non-error syndrome. This assumption makes our analysis independent\nof the recovery process. We map the expression for the time evolution of the\nmemory onto the partition function of an equivalent statistical mechanical spin\nsystem. In the superohmic dissipation case the long-time evolution of the\nmemory has the same behavior as the time evolution for just one QEC cycle. For\nthis case we find analytical expressions for the critical parameters of the\norder-disorder phase transition of an equivalent spin system. These critical\nparameters determine the threshold value for the system-environment coupling\nbelow which it is possible to preserve the memory's state.\n", "  We developed a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of opinion\nformation in interacting agents, constrained by a set of social rules, $B$. To\nprovide the agents with an adaptive quality, we represented both the social\nagents and the social rule by perceptrons. For fully connected societies we\nfind that if the agents' interaction is weak, all agents adapt to the social\nrule $B$, with which they form a consensus; but if the interaction is\nsufficiently strong a consensus is built against the established $status$\n$quo$. This behavior is observed for all temperatures $T$ and for all values of\nthe agents' interaction parameter $H_{0}$, except in the limit $T\\to\\infty$ or\nwhen the interaction reaches the critical value $H_{0}=1,$ where no consensus\nis formed. The agents follow a path where, after a time $\\alpha_{c},$ they\ndisregard their peers' opinions on socially neutral issues and reach a full\nconsensus at time $\\alpha_{d}>\\alpha_{c}.$ The measure of time $\\alpha$ is\nproportional to the volume of information provided to the agents.\n", "  (abridged) In this work we have a closer look at the gas content or fraction\nand the associated star formation rate in main sequence and starburst galaxies\nat z=0 and z~1-2 by applying an analytical model of galactic clumpy gas disks\nto samples of local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs, submillimeter (smm), and high-z\nstarforming galaxies. The model gas and dust temperatures are determined by the\nheating and cooling equilibrium. Dense clouds are heated by turbulent\nmechanical and cosmic ray heating. The molecular abundances of individual gas\nclouds are determined by a detailed chemical network involving the cloud\nlifetime, density, and temperature. Molecular line emission is calculated with\nan escape probability formalism. The model calculates simultaneously the total\ngas mass, HI/H_2 mass, the gas velocity dispersion, IR luminosity, IR spectral\nenergy distribution, CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED), HCN(1-0), and\nHCO+(1-0) emission of a galaxy given its size, integrated star formation rate,\nstellar mass radial profile, rotation curve, and Toomre Q parameter. The model\nreproduces the observed CO luminosities and SLEDs of all sample galaxies within\nthe model uncertainties (~0.3 dex). Whereas the CO emission is robust against\nthe variation of model parameters, the HCN and HCO+ emission is sensitive to\nthe chemistry of the interstellar medium. The CO and HCN mass-to-light\nconversion factors including CO-dark H_2 are given and compared to the values\nfound in the literature. Both, the HCN and HCO+ emission trace the dense\nmolecular gas to a factor of ~2 for the local spiral galaxies, ULIRGs and\nsmm-galaxies. About 80% of the molecular line emission of compact starburst\ngalaxies originates in non-selfgravitating gas clouds. The integrated\nKennicutt-Schmidt law has a slope of ~1 for the local spirals, ULIRGs, and\nsmm-galaxies, whereas the slope is 1.7 for high-z starforming galaxies.\n", "  Primordial Gravitational Waves are the next target of modern cosmology. They\nrepresent a window on the early Universe and the only probe of the physics and\nmicrophysics of the inflationary period. When the production of GWs happens in\nscenarios richer than the standard single-field slow-roll, the GW signal\nbecomes potentially detectable also on scales smaller than the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground. LISA will be extremely complementary to CMB experiments to extract\ninformation about primordial inflationary models and in particular to probe\nphases of the inflationary period for which we have very poor knowledges.\n", "  We describe a procedure that creates an explicit complex-valued polynomial\nfunction of three-dimensional space, whose nodal lines are the three-twist knot\n$5_2$. The construction generalizes a similar approach for lemniscate knots: a\nbraid representation is engineered from finite Fourier series and then\nconsidered as the nodal set of a certain complex polynomial which depends on an\nadditional parameter. For sufficiently small values of this parameter, the\nnodal lines form the three-twist knot. Further mathematical properties of this\nmap are explored, including the relationship of the phase critical points with\nthe Morse-Novikov number, which is nonzero as this knot is not fibred. We also\nfind analogous functions for other knots with six crossings. The particular\nfunction we find, and the general procedure, should be useful for designing\nknotted fields of particular knot types in various physical systems.\n", "  We study quantum state transfer between two qubits coupled to a common\nquantum bus that is constituted by an ultrastrong coupled light-matter system.\nBy tuning both qubit frequencies on resonance with a forbidden transition in\nthe mediating system, we demonstrate a high-fidelity swap operation even though\nthe quantum bus is thermally populated. This proposal may have applications on\nhot quantum information processing within the context of ultrastrong coupling\nregime of light-matter interaction.\n", "  Distribution network operators (DNOs) are increasingly concerned about the\nimpact of low carbon technologies on the low voltage (LV) networks. More\nadvanced metering infrastructures provide numerous opportunities for more\naccurate load flow analysis of the LV networks. However, such data may not be\nreadily available for DNOs and in any case is likely to be expensive. Modelling\ntools are required which can provide realistic, yet accurate, load profiles as\ninput for a network modelling tool, without needing access to large amounts of\nmonitored customer data. In this paper we outline some simple methods for\naccurately modelling a large number of unmonitored residential customers at the\nLV level. We do this by a process we call buddying, which models unmonitored\ncustomers by assigning them load profiles from a limited sample of monitored\ncustomers who have smart meters. Hence the presented method requires access to\nonly a relatively small amount of domestic customers' data. The method is\nefficiently optimised using a genetic algorithm to minimise a weighted cost\nfunction between matching the substation data and the individual mean daily\ndemands. Hence we can show the effectiveness of substation monitoring in LV\nnetwork modelling. Using real LV network modelling, we show that our methods\nperform significantly better than a comparative Monte Carlo approach, and\nprovide a description of the peak demand behaviour.\n", "  Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) convert as much as half of\ntheir energy into radiation. To explore the poorly understood processes that\nare responsible for this conversion, we carry out fully 3D magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of relativistic magnetized jets. Unlike the standard approach\nof injecting the jets at large radii, our simulated jets self-consistently form\nat the source and propagate and accelerate outward for several orders of\nmagnitude in distance before they interact with the ambient medium. We find\nthat this interaction can trigger strong energy dissipation of two kinds inside\nthe jets, depending on the properties of the ambient medium. Those jets that\nform in a new outburst and drill a fresh hole through the ambient medium fall\nvictim to a 3D magnetic kink instability and dissipate their energy primarily\nthrough magnetic reconnection in the current sheets formed by the instability.\nOn the other hand, those jets that form during repeated cycles of AGN activity\nand escape through a pre-existing hole in the ambient medium maintain their\nstability and dissipate their energy primarily at MHD recollimation shocks. In\nboth cases the dissipation region can be associated with a change in the\ndensity profile of the ambient gas. The Bondi radius in AGN jets serves as such\na location.\n", "  We theoretically consider the spin-wave mode- and wavelength-dependent\nenhancement of the Gilbert damping in magnetic insulator--normal metal bilayers\ndue to spin pumping as well as the enhancement's relation to direct and\nalternating inverse spin Hall voltages in the normal metal. In the\nlong-wavelength limit, including long-range dipole interactions, the ratio of\nthe enhancement for transverse volume modes to that of the macrospin mode is\nequal to two. With an out-of-plane magnetization, this ratio decreases with\nboth an increasing surface anisotropic energy and mode number. If the surface\nanisotropy induces a surface state, the enhancement can be an order of\nmagnitude larger than for to the macrospin. With an in-plane magnetization, the\ninduced dissipation enhancement can be understood by mapping the anisotropy\nparameter to the out-of-plane case with anisotropy. For shorter wavelengths, we\ncompute the enhancement numerically and find good agreement with the analytical\nresults in the applicable limits. We also compute the induced direct- and\nalternating-current inverse spin Hall voltages and relate these to the magnetic\nenergy stored in the ferromagnet. Because the magnitude of the direct spin Hall\nvoltage is a measure of spin dissipation, it is directly proportional to the\nenhancement of Gilbert damping. The alternating spin Hall voltage exhibits a\nsimilar in-plane wave-number dependence, and we demonstrate that it is greatest\nfor surface-localized modes.\n", "  A volume-averaged global model is developed to investigate surface-wave\ndischarges inside either cylindrical or coaxial structures. The neutral and ion\nwall flux is self-consistently estimated based on a simplified analytical\ndescription both for electropositive and electronegative plasmas. The\nsimulation results are compared with experimental data from various discharge\nsetups of either argon or oxygen, measured or obtained from literature, for a\ncontinuous and a pulse-modulated power input. A good agreement is observed\nbetween the simulations and the measurements. The calculations show that the\nwall flux often substantially contributes to the net loss rates of the\nindividual species.\n", "  We present the radial distribution of the dark matter in two massive, X-ray\nluminous galaxy clusters, Abell~2142 and Abell~2319, and compare it with the\nquantity predicted as apparent manifestation of the baryonic mass in the\ncontext of the \"Emergent Gravity\" scenario, recently suggested from Verlinde\n(2016). Thanks to the observational strategy of the \\xmm\\ Cluster Outskirt\nProgramme (X-COP), using the X-ray emission mapped with \\xmm\\ and the SZ signal\nin the Planck survey, we recover the gas density, temperature and thermal\npressure profiles up to $\\sim R_{200}$, allowing to constrain at unprecedented\nlevel the total mass through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. We show\nthat, also including systematic uncertainties related to the X-ray based mass\nmodelling, the apparent \"dark\" matter shows a radial profile that has a shape\ndifferent from the traditional dark matter distribution, with larger\ndiscrepancies (by a factor 2--3) in the inner ($r<200$ kpc) cluster's regions\nand a remarkable agreement only across $R_{500}$.\n", "  This paper describes simulations of detector response to multi-TeV physics at\nthe Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) or Super proton-proton Collider (SppC)\nwhich aim to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. The\nunprecedented energy regime of these future experiments imposes new\nrequirements on detector technologies which can be studied using the detailed\nGEANT4 simulations presented in this paper. The initial performance of a\ndetector designed for physics studies at the FCC-hh or SppC experiments is\ndescribed with an emphasis on measurements of single particles up to 33 TeV in\ntransverse momentum. The reconstruction of hadronic jets has also been studied\nin the transverse momentum range from 50 GeV to 26 TeV. The granularity\nrequirements for calorimetry are investigated using the two-particle spatial\nresolution achieved for hadron showers.\n", "  Electromagnetic scattering from moving bodies, being inherently\ntime-dependent phenomenon, gives rise to a generation of new frequencies, which\ncould characterize the motion. While a standard linear path leads to a constant\nDoppler shift, accelerating scatterers could generate a micro-Doppler frequency\ncomb. Here, a spectra produced by rotating objects, was studied and observed in\na bi-static lock in detection scheme. Internal geometry of a scatterer was\nshown to determine the spectra, while the degree of structural asymmetry was\nsuggested to be identified via signatures in the micro-Doppler comb. In\nparticular, hybrid magneto-electric particles, showing an ultimate degree of\nasymmetry in forward and backward scattering directions were investigated. It\nwas shown that the comb in the backward direction has signatures at the\nfundamental rotation frequency and its odd harmonics, while in the forward\nscattered field has the prevailing peak at the doubled frequency and its\nmultiples. Additional features in the comb were shown to be affected by the\ndimensions of the particle and strength of magneto-electric coupling.\nExperimental verification was performed with a printed circuit board antenna,\nbased on a wire and a split ring, while the structure was illuminated with at\n2GHz carrier frequency. Detailed analysis of micro-Doppler combs enables remote\ndetection of asymmetric features of distant objects and could find use in a\nspan of applications, including stellar radiometry and radio identification.\n", "  We study the light curve of SN 1604 using the historical data collected at\nthe time of observation of the outburst. Comparing the supernova with recent\nSNe Ia of various rates of decline after maximum light, we find that this event\nlooks like a normal SNIa (stretch s close to 0.9: 0.9 \\pm 0.13), a fact which\nis also favoured by the late light curve. The supernova is heavily obscured by\n2.7 \\pm 0.1 magnitudes in V. We obtain an estimate of the distance to the\nexplosion with a value of d = 5 \\pm 0.7 kpc. This can help to settle ongoing\ndiscussions on the distance to the supernova. It also shows that this supernova\nis of the same kind as those of the SNIa sets that we use for cosmology\nnowadays.\n", "  A model for the solar dynamo, consistent in global flow and numerical method\nemployed with the differential rotation model, is developed. The magnetic\nturbulent diffusivity is expressed in terms of the entropy gradient, which is\ncontrolled by the model equations. The magnetic Prandtl number and latitudinal\nprofile of the alpha-effect are specified by fitting the computed period of the\nactivity cycle and the equatorial symmetry of magnetic fields to observations.\nThen, the instants of polar field reversals and time-latitude diagrams of the\nfields also come into agreement with observations. The poloidal field has a\nmaximum amplitude of about 10 Gs in the polar regions. The toroidal field of\nseveral thousand Gauss concentrates near the base of the convection zone and is\ntransported towards the equator by the meridional flow. The model predicts a\nvalue of about 10^37 erg for the total magnetic energy of large-scale fields in\nthe solar convection zone.\n", "  The model of the $\\chi_{c_i}-\\gamma^*-\\gamma^*$ and\n$\\chi_{c_i}-J/\\psi^*-\\gamma^*$ form factors developed in [1] for $\\chi_{c_1}$\nand $\\chi_{c_2}$ is extended to $\\chi_{c_0}$ case. The studies performed within\nthis model have shown that at BELLE II it will be possible to study in detail\n$\\chi_{c_i}-\\gamma^*-\\gamma$ form factors through measurements of the reaction\n$e^+e^-\\to e^+e^- \\chi_{c_i} (\\to J/\\psi (\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-)\\gamma)$.The results\nwere obtained using the newly updated Monte Carlo generator EKHARA.\n", "  The interplay of spin-orbit interactions and Coulomb correlations has become\na hot topic in condensed matter theory. Here, we review recent advances in\ndynamical mean-field theory-based electronic structure calculations for\niridates and rhodates. We stress the notion of the effective degeneracy of the\ncompounds, which introduces an additional axis into the conventional picture of\na phase diagram based on filling and on the ratio of interactions to bandwidth.\n", "  One might expect far away from physical black holes that quantum field\nquantisation performed in Minkowski space is a good approximation. Indeed, all\nexperimental tests in particle colliders reveal no deviations so far.\nNevertheless, the black holes should leave certain imprints of their presence\nin quantum processes. In this paper, we shall discuss several local imprints of\nsmall, primordial evaporating black holes in quantum electrodynamics in the\nweak gravity regime. Physically this can be interpreted as being macroscopic\nmanifestations of vacuum fluctuations.\n", "  We analyze the Higgs-boson masses and mixing matrices in the NMSSM based on\nan on-shell (OS) renormalization of the gauge-boson and Higgs-boson masses and\nthe parameters of the top/scalar top sector. We compare the implementation of\nthe OS calculations in the codes NMSSMCALC and NMSSM-FeynHiggs up to\n$\\mathcal{({\\alpha}_t{\\alpha}_s)}$. We identify the sources of discrepancies at\nthe one- and at the two-loop level. Finally we compare the OS and\n$\\overline{\\text{DR}}$ evaluation as implemented in NMSSMCALC. The results are\nimportant ingredients for an estimate of the theoretical precision of\nHiggs-boson mass calculations in the NMSSM.\n", "  We study dissipation in Pd nano-mechanical resonators at low temperatures in\nthe linear response regime. Metallic resonators have shown characteristic\nfeatures of dissipation due to tunneling two level systems (TLS). This system\noffers a unique tunability of the dissipation scenario by adsorbing hydrogen\n($H_2$) which induces a compressive stress. The intrinsic stress is expected to\nalter TLS behaviour. We find a sub-linear power law $\\sim T^{0.4}$ in\ndissipation. As seen in TLS dissipation scenarios we find a logarithmic\nincrease of frequency characteristic from the lowest temperatures till a\ncharacteristic temperature $T_{co}$ is reached. In samples without $H_2$ the\n$T_{co} \\sim 1K$ whereas with $H_2$ it is clearly reduced to $\\sim 700 mK$.\nBased on standard TLS phenomena we attribute this to enhanced phonon-TLS\ncoupling in samples with compressive strain. We also find with $H_2$ there is a\nsaturation in low temperature dissipation which may possibly be due to\nsuper-radiant interaction between TLS and phonons. We discuss the data in the\nscope of TLS phenomena and similar data for other systems.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a simple generalization of the locally r-symmetric\nJordanian twist, resulting in the one-parameter family of Jordanian twists. All\nthe proposed twists differ by the coboundary twists and produce the same\nJordanian deformation of the corresponding Lie algebra. They all provide the\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutation relations. Constructions from\nnoncommutative coordinates to the star product and coproduct, and from the star\nproduct to the coproduct and the twist are presented. The corresponding twist\nin the Hopf algebroid approach is given. Our results are presented symbolically\nby a diagram relating all of the possible constructions.\n", "  We present a pedagogical discussion of Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG)\nmethods, in particular the In-Medium SRG (IMSRG) approach for solving the\nnuclear many-body problem. These methods use continuous unitary transformations\nto evolve the nuclear Hamiltonian to a desired shape. The IMSRG, in particular,\nis used to decouple the ground state from all excitations and solve the\nmany-body Schr\\\"odinger equation. We discuss the IMSRG formalism as well as its\nnumerical implementation, and use the method to study the pairing model and\ninfinite neutron matter. We compare our results with those of Coupled cluster\ntheory, Configuration-Interaction Monte Carlo, and the Self-Consistent Green's\nFunction approach. The chapter concludes with an expanded overview of current\nresearch directions, and a look ahead at upcoming developments.\n", "  We develop a highly efficient numerical method to simulate small-amplitude\nflapping propulsion by a flexible wing in a nearly inviscid fluid. We allow the\nwing's elastic modulus and mass density to vary arbitrarily, with an eye\ntowards optimizing these distributions for propulsive performance. The method\nto determine the wing kinematics is based on Chebyshev collocation of the 1D\nbeam equation as coupled to the surrounding 2D fluid flow. Through\nsmall-amplitude analysis of the Euler equations (with trailing-edge vortex\nshedding), the complete hydrodynamics can be represented by a nonlocal operator\nthat acts on the 1D wing kinematics. A class of semi-analytical solutions\npermits fast evaluation of this operator with $O(N \\log N)$ operations, where\n$N$ is the number of collocation points on the wing. This is in contrast to the\nminimum $O(N^2)$ operations required by a direct 2D fluid solver. The coupled\nwing-fluid problem is thus recast as a PDE with nonlocal operator, which we\nsolve using a preconditioned iterative method. These techniques yield a solver\nof near-optimal complexity, $O(N \\log N)$, allowing one to rapidly search the\ninfinite-dimensional parameter space of all possible material distributions and\neven perform optimization over this space.\n", "  Main results of our recent investigations on five-dimensional scenarios of\nmassive (bi-)gravity will be summarized in this article. In particular, we will\nshow how to construct higher dimensional massive graviton terms from the\ncharacteristic equation of square matrix, which is a consequence of the\nCayley-Hamilton theorem. Then, we will show whether massive graviton terms of\nfive-dimensional massive (bi-)gravity behave as effective cosmological\nconstants for a number of physical metrics compatible with fiducial ones such\nas the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi type I, and\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini metrics. Finally, we will show the corresponding\ncosmological solutions for the five-dimensional massive (bi-)gravity.\n", "  We report new results of a 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer study of multiferroic 3R-AgFeO2\npowder samples performed in a wide temperature range, including two points, TN1\n~ 14 K and TN2 ~ 9 K, of magnetic phase transitions. At the intermediate\ntemperature range, TN2 < T < TN1, the 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectra can be described\nin terms of collinear spin-density-waves (SDW) with the inclusion of many\nhigh-order harmonics, indicating that the real magnetic structure of this\nferrite appears to be more complicated than a pure sinusoidally modulated SDW.\nThe spectra at low temperatures, T < TN2, consist of a Zeeman pattern with line\nbroadenings and sizeable spectral asymmetry. It has been shown that the\nobserved spectral shape is consistent with a transition to the elliptical\ncycloidal magnetic structure. An analysis of the experimental spectra was\ncarried out under the assumption that the electric hyperfine interactions are\nmodulated when the Fe3+ magnetic moment rotates with respect to the principal\naxis of the EFG tensor and emergence of the strong anisotropy of the magnetic\nhyperfine field Hhf at the 57Fe nuclei. The large and temperature-independent\nanharmonicity parameter, m ~ 0.78, of the cycloidal spin structure obtained\nfrom the experimental spectra results from easy-axis anisotropy in the plane of\nrotation of the iron spin. Analysis of different mechanisms of spin and\nhyperfine interactions in 3R-AgFeO2 and its structural analogue CuFeO2 points\nto a specific role played by the topology of the exchange coupling and the\noxygen polarization in the delafossite structures.\n", "  The dynamics of adoption of innovations is an important subject in many\nfields and areas, like technological development, industrial processes, social\nbehavior, fashion or marketing. The number of adopters of a new technology\ngenerally increases following a kind of logistic function. However, empirical\ndata provide evidences that this behavior may be more complex, as many factors\ninfluence the decision to adopt an innovation. On the one hand, although some\nindividuals are inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same,\nthere are others who act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate\nfrom the \"herd\". People who prefer to behave like the others are called\nmimetic, whereas individuals who resist adopting new products, the stronger the\ngreater the number of adopters, are named contrarians. On the other hand, new\nadopters may have second thoughts and change their decisions accordingly.\nAgents who regret and abandon their decision will be denominated repentant. In\nthis paper we investigate a simple model for the adoption of an innovation for\na society composed by mimetic and contrarian individuals whose decisions depend\nmainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance\nto adopt it, and the social interactions with other agents. In the process,\nagents can repent and turn back to the old technology. We present analytic\ncalculations and numerical simulations to determine the conditions for the\nestablishment of the new technology. The inclusion of repentant agents modify\nthe balance between the global incentive to adopt and the number of contrarians\nwho prevent full adoption, generating a rich landscape of temporal evolution\nthat includes cycles of adoption.\n", "  The broad success of theoretical and experimental quantum optimal control is\nintimately connected to the topology of the underlying control landscape. For\nseveral common quantum control goals, including the maximization of an\nobservable expectation value, the landscape has been shown to lack local optima\nif three assumptions are satisfied: (i) the quantum system is controllable,\n(ii) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the evolution operator\nis full-rank, and (iii) the control field is not constrained. In the case of\nthe observable objective, this favorable analysis shows that the associated\nlandscape also contains saddles, i.e., critical points that are not local\nsuboptimal extrema. In this paper, we investigate whether the presence of these\nsaddles affects the trajectories of gradient-based searches for an optimal\ncontrol. We show through simulations that both the detailed topology of the\ncontrol landscape and the parameters of the system Hamiltonian influence\nwhether the searches are attracted to a saddle. For some circumstances with a\nspecial initial state and target observable, optimizations may approach a\nsaddle very closely, reducing the efficiency of the gradient algorithm.\nEncounters with such attractive saddles are found to be quite rare. Neither the\npresence of a large number of saddles on the control landscape nor a large\nnumber of system states increase the likelihood that a search will closely\napproach a saddle. Even for applications that encounter a saddle, well-designed\ngradient searches with carefully chosen algorithmic parameters will readily\nlocate optimal controls.\n", "  We use two simple independent gedankan experiments to show that the\nholographic principle can be understood intuitively as having its origin in the\nquantum fluctuations of spacetime. Applied to cosmology, this consideration\nleads to a dynamical cosmological constant of the observed magnitude, a result\nthat can also be obtained for the present and recent cosmic eras by using\nunimodular gravity and causal set theory. Next we generalize the concept of\ngravitational thermodynamics to a spacetime with positive cosmological constant\n(like ours) to reveal the natural emergence, in galactic dynamics, of a\ncritical acceleration parameter related to the cosmological constant. We are\nthen led to construct a phenomenological model of dark matter which we call\n\"modified dark matter\" (MDM) in which the dark matter density profile depends\non both the cosmological constant and ordinary matter. We provide observational\ntests of MDM by fitting the rotation curves to a sample of 30 local spiral\ngalaxies with a single free parameter and by showing that the dynamical and\nobserved masses agree in a sample of 93 galactic clusters. We also give a brief\ndiscussion of the possibility that quanta of both dark energy and dark matter\nare non-local, obeying quantum Boltzmann statistics (also called infinite\nstatistics) as described by a curious average of the bosonic and fermionic\nalgebras. If such a scenario is correct, we can expect some novel particle\nphenomenology involving dark matter interactions. This may explain why so far\nno dark matter detection experiments have been able to claim convincingly to\nhave detected dark matter.\n", "  It has been shown in recent years that the stochastic block model (SBM) is\nsometimes undetectable in the sparse limit, i.e., that no algorithm can\nidentify a partition correlated with the partition used to generate an\ninstance, if the instance is sparse enough and infinitely large. In this\ncontribution, we treat the finite case explicitly, using arguments drawn from\ninformation theory and statistics. We give a necessary condition for\nfinite-size detectability in the general SBM. We then distinguish the concept\nof average detectability from the concept of instance-by-instance detectability\nand give explicit formulas for both definitions. Using these formulas, we prove\nthat there exist large equivalence classes of parameters, where widely\ndifferent network ensembles are equally detectable with respect to our\ndefinitions of detectability. In an extensive case study, we investigate the\nfinite-size detectability of a simplified variant of the SBM, which encompasses\na number of important models as special cases. These models include the\nsymmetric SBM, the planted coloring model, and more exotic SBMs not previously\nstudied. We conclude with three appendices, where we study the interplay of\nnoise and detectability, establish a connection between our\ninformation-theoretic approach and random matrix theory, and provide proofs of\nsome of the more technical results.\n", "  This work relates to the famous experiments, performed in 1975 and 1979 by\nWerner et al., measuring neutron interference and neutron Sagnac effects in the\nearth's gravitational field. Employing the method of Stodolsky in its weak\nfield approximation, explicit expressions are derived for the two phase shifts,\nwhich turn out to be in agreement with the experiments and with the previously\nobtained expressions derived from semi-classical arguments: these expressions\nare simply modified by relativistic correction factors.\n", "  We examine values of the Adinkra Holoraumy-induced Gadget representation\nspace metric over all possible four-color, four-open node, and four-closed node\nadinkras. Of the 1,358,954,496 gadget matrix elements, only 226,492,416 are\nnon-vanishing and take on one of three values: $-1/3$, $1/3$, or $1$ and thus a\nsubspace isomorphic to a description of a body-centered tetrahedral molecule\nemerges.\n", "  It is well recognized that the relative position of the center of mass (pCOM)\nwith respect to the base of support (BOS) is a determining factor in the\nmaintenance of balance. However, during gait the dynamic nature of the BOS is\nnot well defined and in most studies is completely ignored. Prior work tends to\nfocus on the variability in the position of the center of mass (COM) with\nrespect to the laboratory reference frame to attempt to quantify dynamic\nbalance. We propose a modified method whereby the position of the COM in an\nend-effector based coordinate system may be used as an improved estimate of\nthreat to balance during gait. The distance (DN) of the projection of the COM\n(pCOM) from the reference axis, normalized by half the foot length for\ninter-subject comparison, is an estimate of the gravitational moment arm. It\ncan be shown that in concordance with theory, balance impaired subjects with\nspastic cerebral palsy (CP) have a larger DN than their typically developing\npeers. Furthermore, when compared with variational methods, DN shows better\ndiscriminative ability in characterizing groups.\n", "  Clebsch potential gauge field theory for magnetohydrodynamics is developed\nbased in part on the theory of Calkin (1963). It is shown how the polarization\nvector ${\\bf P}$ in Calkin's approach, naturally arises from the Lagrange\nmultiplier constraint equation for Faraday's equation for the magnetic\ninduction ${\\bf B}$, or alternatively from the magnetic vector potential form\nof Faraday's equation. Gauss's equation, (divergence of ${\\bf B}$ is zero), is\nincorporated in the variational principle by means of a Lagrange multiplier\nconstraint. Noether's theorem, coupled with the gauge symmetries is used to\nderive the conservation laws for (a)\\ magnetic helicity (b)\\ cross helicity,\n(c) fluid helicity for non-magnetized fluids, and (d) a class of conservation\nlaws associated with curl and divergence equations, which applies to Faraday's\nequation and Gauss's equation. The magnetic helicity conservation law is due to\na gauge symmetry in MHD and not due to a fluid relabelling symmetry. The\nanalysis is carried out for the general case of a non-barotropic gas, in which\nthe gas pressure and internal energy density depend on both the entropy $S$ and\nthe gas density $\\rho$. The cross helicity and fluid helicity conservation laws\nin the non-barotropic case, are nonlocal conservation laws, that reduce to\nlocal conservation laws for the case of a barotropic gas. The connections\nbetween gauge symmetries, Clebsch potentials and Casimirs are developed. It is\nshown that the gauge symmetry functionals in the work of Henyey (1982) satisfy\nthe Casimir determining equations.\n", "  Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is a unique mechanism for producing fast\npulses - picosecond and below - of bright X- to gamma-rays. These nominally\nnarrow spectral bandwidth electromagnetic radiation pulses are efficiently\nproduced in the interaction between intense, well-focused electron and laser\nbeams. The spectral characteristics of such sources are affected by many\nexperimental parameters, such as the bandwidth of the laser, and the angles of\nboth the electrons and laser photons at collision. The laser field amplitude\ninduces harmonic generation and importantly, for the present work, nonlinear\nred shifting, both of which dilute the spectral brightness of the radiation. As\nthe applications enabled by this source often depend sensitively on its\nspectra, it is critical to resolve the details of the wavelength and angular\ndistribution obtained from ICS collisions. With this motivation, we present\nhere an experimental study that greatly improves on previous spectral\nmeasurement methods based on X-ray K-edge filters, by implementing a\nmulti-layer bent-crystal X-ray spectrometer. In tandem with a collimating slit,\nthis method reveals a projection of the double-differential angular-wavelength\nspectrum of the ICS radiation in a single shot. The measurements enabled by\nthis diagnostic illustrate the combined off-axis and nonlinear-field-induced\nred shifting in the ICS emission process. They reveal in detail the strength of\nthe normalized laser vector potential, and provide a non-destructive measure of\nthe temporal and spatial electron-laser beam overlap.\n", "  Graph theoretical analysis of the community structure of networks attempts to\nidentify the communities (or modules) to which each node affiliates. However,\nthis is in most cases an ill-posed problem, as the affiliation of a node to a\nsingle community is often ambiguous. Previous solutions have attempted to\nidentify all of the communities to which each node affiliates. Instead of\ntaking this approach, we introduce versatility, $V$, as a novel metric of nodal\naffiliation: $V \\sim 0$ means that a node is consistently assigned to a\nspecific community; $V \\gg 0$ means it is inconsistently assigned to different\ncommunities. Versatility works in conjunction with existing community detection\nalgorithms, and it satisfies many theoretically desirable properties in\nidealised networks designed to maximise ambiguity of modular decomposition. The\nlocal minima of global mean versatility identified the resolution parameters of\na hierarchical community detection algorithm that least ambiguously decomposed\nthe community structure of a social (karate club) network and the mouse brain\nconnectome. Our results suggest that nodal versatility is useful in quantifying\nthe inherent ambiguity of modular decomposition.\n", "  The problem of measurement in quantum mechanics is studied within the\nEntropic Dynamics framework. We discuss von Neumann and Weak measurements,\nwavefunction collapse, and Weak Values as examples of bayesian and entropic\ninference.\n", "  This review of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD),the early universe\nCosmoloical Phase Transition from the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) to our present\nuniverse (QCDPT), Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions (RHIC) which can produce\nthe QGP, the possible detection of the QGP produced by the production of mixed\nhybrid heavy quark mesons. We also review recent studies of the production of\nmixed heavy quark hybrids via RHIC and heavy quark meson supression in p-Pb and\nPb-Pb collisions.\n", "  Assuming the hypothesis of the entropic nature of gravity, we calculate\ngeneralized Newtonian forces, their associated potentials and field equations,\nwhen other, in general non-extensive, entropies are considered instead of the\nusual Boltzmann entropy. Some comments about the nature of the correction terms\npresented are given, and a calculation of corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking\ntemperature is performed using the arguments which lead to what can be called a\nMichell-Laplace black hole.\n", "  For Gauss-Bonnet gravity and in the context of holography we show how the\nthermal DC conductivity can be obtained by solving a generalised system of\nStokes equations for an auxiliary fluid on a curved black hole horizon. For\nmore general higher derivative theories of gravity coupled to gauge-fields, we\nalso analyse the linearised thermal and electric currents that are produced by\nDC thermal and electric sources. We show how suitably defined DC transport\ncurrent fluxes of the dual field theory are given by current fluxes defined at\nthe black horizon.\n", "  High energy cosmic ray electrons and positrons probe the local properties of\nour Galaxy. In fact, electromagnetic energy losses limit the typical\npropagation scale of GeV-TeV electrons and positrons to a few kpc. In the\ndiffusion model, nearby and dominant sources may produce an observable dipole\nanisotropy in the cosmic ray fluxes. We present a detailed study on the role of\nanisotropies from nearby sources in the interpretation of the observed GeV-TeV\ncosmic ray electron and positrons fluxes. We compute predictions for the\nanisotropies from known astrophysical sources as supernova remnants and pulsar\nwind nebulae of the ATNF catalog. Our results are compared with current\nanisotropy upper limits from the Fermi- LAT, AMS-02 and PAMELA experiments.\n", "  The original Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) equations which are the coupled two\ndimensional Navier-Stokes(NS) and heat conduction equations have been\ninvestigated by E.N. Lorenz half a century ago with Fourier series and opened\nthe way to the paradigm of chaos. In our former study-Chaos, Solitons and\nFractals78, 249 (2015)-we presented fully analytic solutions for the velocity,\npressure and temperature fields with the aim of the self-similar Ansatz and\ngave a possible explanation of the Rayleigh--B\\`enard convection cells. Now we\ngeneralize the Oberbeck-Boussinesq hydrodynamical system, going beyond the\nfirst order Boussinesq approximation and consider a non-linear temperature\ncoupling. We investigate more general, power law dependent fluid viscosity or\nheat conduction material equations as well. Our analytic results obtained via\nthe self-similar Ansatz may attract the interest of various fields like\nmeteorology, oceanography or climate studies.\n", "  The magnetron H- ion sources developed in the 1970s currently in operation at\nFermilab provide beam to the rest of the accelerator complex. A series of\nmodifications to these sources have been tested in a dedicated offline test\nstand with the aim of improving different operational issues. The solenoid type\ngas valve was tested as an alternative to the piezoelectric gas valve in order\nto avoid its temperature dependence. A new cesium oven was designed and tested\nin order to avoid glass pieces that were present with the previous oven,\nimprove thermal insulation and fine tune its temperature. A current-regulated\narc modulator was developed to run the ion source at a constant arc current,\nproviding very stable beam outputs during operations. In order to reduce beam\nnoise, the addition of small amounts of N2 gas was explored, as well as testing\ndifferent cathode shapes with increasing plasma volume. This paper summarizes\nthe studies and modifications done in the source over the last three years with\nthe aim of improving its stability, reliability and overall performance.\n", "  We introduce an exact replica method for the study of critical systems with\nquenched bond randomness in two dimensions. For the $q$-state Potts model we\nshow that a line of renormalization group fixed points interpolates from weak\nto strong randomness as $q-2$ grows from small to large values. This theory\nexhibits a $q$-independent sector, and allows at the same time for a\ncorrelation length exponent which keeps the Ising value and continuously\nvarying magnetization exponent and effective central charge. These findings\nappear to solve long standing numerical and theoretical puzzles, and to\nillustrate the peculiarities which may characterize the conformal field\ntheories of random fixed points.\n", "  Recently, integrability conditions (ICs) in mutistate Landau-Zener (MLZ)\ntheory were proposed [1]. They describe common properties of all known solved\nsystems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians. Here we show that ICs enable\nefficient computer assisted search for new solvable MLZ models that span\ncomplexity range from several interacting states to mesoscopic systems with\nmany-body dynamics and combinatorially large phase space. This diversity\nsuggests that nontrivial solvable MLZ models are numerous. In addition, we\nrefine the formulation of ICs and extend the class of solvable systems to\nmodels with points of multiple diabatic level crossing.\n", "  We investigate the crossing of an energy barrier by a self-propelled particle\ndescribed by a Rayleigh friction term. We reveal the existence of a sharp\ntransition in the external force field whereby the amplitude dramatically\nincreases. This corresponds to a saddle point transition in the velocity flow\nphase space, as would be expected for any type of repulsive force field. We use\nthis approach to rationalize the results obtained by Eddi \\emph{et al.}\n[\\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} \\textbf{102}, 240401 (2009)] who studied the\ninteraction between a drop propelled by its accompanying wave field and a\nsubmarine obstacle. This wave particle entity can overcome potential barrier,\nsuggesting the existence of a \"macroscopic tunneling effect\". We show that the\neffect of self-propulsion is sufficiently strong to generate crossing of the\nhigh energy barrier. By assuming a random distribution of initial angles, we\ndefine a probability distribution to cross the potential barrier that matches\nwith the data of Eddi \\emph{et al.}. This probability is similar to the one\nencountered in statistical physics for Hamiltonian systems \\textit{i.e.} a\nBoltzmann exponential law.\n", "  We present OpenRBC, a coarse-grained molecular dynamics code, which is\ncapable of performing an unprecedented in silico experiment --- simulating an\nentire mammal red blood cell lipid bilayer and cytoskeleton as modeled by 4\nmillion mesoscopic particles --- using a single shared memory commodity\nworkstation. To achieve this, we invented an adaptive spatial-searching\nalgorithm to accelerate the computation of short-range pairwise interactions in\nan extremely sparse 3D space. The algorithm is based on a Voronoi partitioning\nof the point cloud of coarse-grained particles, and is continuously updated\nover the course of the simulation. The algorithm enables the construction of\nthe key spatial searching data structure in our code, i.e. a lattice-free cell\nlist, with a time and space cost linearly proportional to the number of\nparticles in the system. The position and shape of the cells also adapt\nautomatically to the local density and curvature. The code implements OpenMP\nparallelization and scales to hundreds of hardware threads. It outperforms a\nlegacy simulator by almost an order of magnitude in time-to-solution and more\nthan 40 times in problem size, thus providing a new platform for probing the\nbiomechanics of red blood cells.\n", "  We examine three SNe Type Ia datasets: Union2.1, JLA and Panstarrs to check\ntheir consistency using cosmology blind statistical analyses as well as\ncosmological parameter fitting. We find that Panstarrs dataset is the most\nstable of the three to changes, although it does not, at the moment, go to high\nenough redshifts to tightly constrain the dark energy equation of state, $w$.\nUnion2.1, drawn from many different sources, appears somewhat susceptible to\nchanges within the dataset. JLA reconstructs well for a smaller number of\ncosmological parameters. At higher degrees of freedom, the dependence of its\nerrors on redshift can lead to varying results between subsets. Panstarrs is\ninconsistent with the other two at about $2\\sigma$, and JLA and Union2.1 are\nabout $1\\sigma$ away from each other. For the $\\Omega_{0m}-w$ cosmological\nreconstruction, the $1\\sigma$ range of values in $w$ for selected subsets of\neach dataset is two times larger for JLA and Union2.1 as compared to Panstarrs.\nThe range in $\\Omega_{0m}$ for the same subsets remains approximately similar\nfor all three datasets. Although there are differences in the fitting and\ncorrection techniques used in the different samples, the most important\ncriterion is SNe selection, a slightly different SNe selection can lead to\nnoticeably different results both in the purely statistical analysis and\ncosmological reconstruction. We note that a single, high quality low redshift\nsample could help decrease the uncertainties in the result. We also note that\nlack of homogeneity in the magnitude errors may bias the results and should\neither be modeled, or its effect neutralized by using other, complementary\ndatasets. A supernova sample with high quality data at both high and low\nredshifts, constructed from a few surveys to avoid heterogeneity in the sample,\nand with homogeneous errors, would result in a more robust cosmological\nreconstruction.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is at the heart of many exotic band-structures and\ncan give rise to many-body states with topological order. Here we present a\ngeneral scheme based on a combination of microwave driving and lattice shaking\nfor the realization of time-reversal invariant 2D SOC with ultracold atoms in\nsystems with inversion symmetry. We show that the strengths of Rashba and\nDresselhaus SOC can be independently tuned in a spin-dependent square lattice.\nMore generally, our method can be used to open gaps between different spin\nstates without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that this allows\nfor the realization of topological insulators in the presence of SOC, which is\nclosely related to the Kane-Mele model.\n", "  We present high resolution ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) and 350 GHz\ncontinuum emissions of the debris disc of 49 Ceti, known to be particularly\nrich in molecular gas in spite of its age. The main new results are: i) both CO\nand dust discs share a same position angle and a same inclination but the gas\ndisc is more homogeneous, more central and thinner than the dust disc; ii)\nevidence is obtained for a significant deficit of observed CO(3-2) emission at\nDoppler velocities differing from the star systemic velocity by less than 1\n\\kms; iii) gas velocities are accurately measured and found Keplerian over a\nbroad range of disc radii; iv) the observed CO(3-2) line width is dominated by\nKeplerian shear and upper limits are obtained to the intrinsic line width.\nSimple phenomenological models of both CO(3-2) and \\mbox{350 GHz} continuum\nemissions are presented, requiring the use of only very few parameters. The\nresults are discussed in the frame of currently favoured models.\n", "  We propose several new observables/correlators, based on correlations between\ntwo or more subevents separated in pseudorapidity $\\eta$, to study the\nlongitudinal flow fluctuations. We show that these observables are sensitive to\nthe event-by-event fluctuations, as a function of $\\eta$, of the initial\ncondition as well as the non-linear mode-mixing effects. Experimental\nmeasurement of these observables shall provide important new constraints on the\nboost-variant event-by-event initial conditions required by all 3+1-dimensional\nviscous hydrodynamics models.\n", "  We investigate a class of multi-dimensional two-component systems of\nMonge-Amp\\`ere type that can be viewed as generalisations of heavenly-type\nequations appearing in self-dual Ricci-flat geometry. Based on the\nJordan-Kronecker theory of skew-symmetric matrix pencils, a classification of\nnormal forms of such systems is obtained. All two-component systems of\nMonge-Amp\\`ere type turn out to be integrable, and can be represented as the\ncommutativity conditions of parameter-dependent vector fields. Geometrically,\nsystems of Monge-Amp\\`ere type are associated with linear sections of the\nGrassmannians. This leads to an invariant differential-geometric\ncharacterisation of the Monge-Amp\\`ere property.\n", "  In the coset model $(D_N^{(1)} \\oplus D_N^{(1)},D_N^{(1)})$ at levels\n$(k_1,k_2)$, the higher spin $4$ current that contains the quartic WZW currents\ncontracted with completely symmetric $SO(2N)$ invariant $d$ tensor of rank $4$\nis obtained. The three-point functions with two scalars are obtained for any\nfinite $N$ and $k_2$ with $k_1=1$. They are determined also in the large $N$ 't\nHooft limit. When one of the levels is the dual Coxeter number of $SO(2N)$,\n$k_1=2N-2$, the higher spin $\\frac{7}{2}$ current, which contains the septic\nadjoint fermions contracted with the above $d$ tensor and the triple product of\nstructure constants, is obtained from the operator product expansion (OPE)\nbetween the spin $\\frac{3}{2}$ current living in the ${\\cal N}=1$\nsuperconformal algebra and the above higher spin $4$ current. The OPEs between\nthe higher spin $\\frac{7}{2}, 4$ currents are described. For $k_1=k_2=2N-2$\nwhere both levels are equal to the dual Coxeter number of $SO(2N)$, the higher\nspin $3$ current of $U(1)$ charge $\\frac{4}{3}$, which contains the six product\nof spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ (two) adjoint fermions contracted with the product of $d$\ntensor and two structure constants, is obtained. The corresponding ${\\cal N}=2$\nhigher spin multiplet is determined by calculating the remaining higher spin\n$\\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}, 4$ currents with the help of two spin $\\frac{3}{2}$\ncurrents in the ${\\cal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. The other ${\\cal N}=2$\nhigher spin multiplet, whose $U(1)$ charge is opposite to the one of above\n${\\cal N}=2$ higher spin multiplet, is obtained. The OPE between these two\n${\\cal N}=2$ higher spin mutiplets is also discussed.\n", "  We report a first, complete lattice QCD calculation of the long-distance\ncontribution to the $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decay within the standard model.\nThis is a second-order weak process involving two four-Fermi operators that is\nhighly sensitive to new physics and being studied by the NA62 experiment at\nCERN. While much of this decay comes from perturbative, short-distance physics\nthere is a long-distance part, perhaps as large as the planned experimental\nerror, which involves nonperturbative phenomena. The calculation presented\nhere, with unphysical quark masses, demonstrates that this contribution can be\ncomputed using lattice methods by overcoming three technical difficulties: (i)\na short-distance divergence that results when the two weak operators approach\neach other, (ii) exponentially growing, unphysical terms that appear in\nEuclidean, second-order perturbation theory, and (iii) potentially large\nfinite-volume effects. A follow-on calculation with physical quark masses and\ncontrolled systematic errors will be possible with the next generation of\ncomputers.\n", "  We present a conceptually simple method for treating electron-phonon\nscattering and phonon limited mobilities. By combining Green's function based\ntransport calculations and molecular dynamics (MD), we obtain a temperature\ndependent transmission from which we evaluate the mobility. We validate our\napproach by comparing to mobilities and conductivies obtained by the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) for different bulk and one-dimensional systems. For\nbulk silicon and gold we successfully compare against experimental values. We\ndiscuss limitations and advantages of each of the computational approaches.\n", "  Integrated circuits based on CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductors)\nare at the heart of the technological revolution of the past 40 years, as these\nhave enabled compact and low cost micro-electronic circuits and imaging\nsystems. However, the diversification of this platform into applications other\nthan microcircuits and visible light cameras has been impeded by the difficulty\nto combine other semiconductors than silicon with CMOS. Here, we show for the\nfirst time the monolithic integration of a CMOS integrated circuit with\ngraphene, operating as a high mobility phototransistor. We demonstrate a\nhigh-resolution image sensor and operate it as a digital camera that is\nsensitive to UV, visible and infrared light. The demonstrated graphene-CMOS\nintegration is pivotal for incorporating 2d materials into the next generation\nmicroelectronics, sensor arrays, low-power integrated photonics and CMOS\nimaging systems covering visible, infrared and even terahertz frequencies.. The\ndemonstrated graphene-CMOS integration is pivotal for incorporating 2d\nmaterials into the next generation microelectronics, sensor arrays, low-power\nintegrated photonics and CMOS imaging systems covering visible, infrared and\neven terahertz frequencies.\n", "  The squeezed-limit bispectrum, which is generated by nonlinear gravitational\nevolution as well as inflationary physics, measures the correlation of three\nwavenumbers, in the configuration where one wavenumber is much smaller than the\nother two. Since the squeezed-limit bispectrum encodes the impact of a\nlarge-scale fluctuation on the small-scale power spectrum, it can be understood\nas how the small-scale power spectrum \"responds\" to the large-scale\nfluctuation. Viewed in this way, the squeezed-limit bispectrum can be\ncalculated using the response approach even in the cases which do not submit to\nperturbative treatment. To illustrate this point, we apply this approach to the\ncross-correlation between the large-scale quasar density field and small-scale\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. In particular, using separate\nuniverse simulations which implement changes in the large-scale density,\nvelocity gradient, and primordial power spectrum amplitude, we measure how the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum responds to the local,\nlong-wavelength quasar overdensity, and equivalently their squeezed-limit\nbispectrum. We perform a Fisher forecast for the ability of future experiments\nto constrain local non-Gaussianity using the bispectrum of quasars and the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest. Combining with quasar and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest power\nspectra to constrain the biases, we find that for DESI the expected $1-\\sigma$\nconstraint is ${\\rm err}[f_{\\rm NL}]\\sim60$. Ability for DESI to measure\n$f_{\\rm NL}$ through this channel is limited primarily by the aliasing and\ninstrumental noise of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. The\ncombination of response approach and separate universe simulations provides a\nnovel technique to explore the constraints from the squeezed-limit bispectrum\nbetween different observables.\n", "  Being inspired by a recent study [V. Dimitriadis et al. Phys. Rev. B\n\\textbf{92}, 064420 (2015)], we study the finite temperature magnetic\nproperties of the spherical nanoparticles with core-shell structure including\nquenched (i) surface and (ii) interface nonmagnetic impurities (static holes)\nas well as (iii) roughened interface effects. The particle core is composed of\nferromagnetic spins, and it is surrounded by a ferromagnetic shell. By means of\nMonte Carlo simulation based on an improved Metropolis algorithm, we implement\nthe nanoparticles using classical Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Particular attention\nhas also been devoted to elucidate the effects of the particle size on the\nthermal and magnetic phase transition features of these systems. For\nnanoparticles with imperfect surface layers, it is found that bigger particles\nexhibit lower compensation point which decreases gradually with increasing\namount of vacancies, and vanishes at a critical value. In view of nanoparticles\nwith diluted interface, our Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that there\nexists a region in the disorder spectrum where compensation temperature\nlinearly decreases with decreasing dilution parameter. For nanoparticles with\nroughened interface, it is observed that the degree of roughness does not play\nany significant role on the variation of both the compensation point and\ncritical temperature. However, the low temperature saturation magnetizations of\nthe core and shell interface regions sensitively depend on the roughness\nparameter.\n", "  In any general cycle of measurement, feedback and erasure, the measurement\nwill reduce the entropy of the system when information about the state is\nobtained, while erasure, according to Landauer's principle, is accompanied by a\ncorresponding increase in entropy due to the compression of logical and\nphysical phase space. The total process can in principle be fully reversible. A\nmeasurement error reduces the information obtained and the entropy decrease in\nthe system. The erasure still gives the same increase in entropy and the total\nprocess is irreversible. Another consequence of measurement error is that a bad\nfeedback is applied, which further increases the entropy production if the\nproper protocol adapted to the expected error rate is not applied. We consider\nthe effect of measurement error on a realistic single-electron box Szilard\nengine. We find the optimal protocol for the cycle as a function of the desired\npower $P$ and error $\\epsilon$, as well as the existence of a maximal power\n$P^{\\max}$.\n", "  The fine details of the large-scale structure in the local universe provide\nimportant empirical benchmarks for testing cosmological models of structure\nformation. Dwarf galaxies are key object for such studies. Enlarge the sample\nof known dwarf galaxies in the local universe. We performed a search for faint,\nunresolved low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies in the M101 group complex,\nincluding the region around the major spiral galaxies M101, M51, and M63 lying\nat a distance 7.0, 8.6, and 9.0 Mpc, respectively. The new dwarf galaxy sample\ncan be used in a first step to test for significant substructure in the\n2D-distribution and in a second step to study the spatial distribution of the\ngalaxy complex. Using filtering algorithms we surveyed 330 square degrees of\nimaging data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The images were\nvisually inspected. The spatial distribution of known galaxies and candidates\nwas analyzed transforming the system into a M101 eigenframe, using the\ngeometrical alignment of the group. We discovered 15 new dwarf galaxies and\ncarried out surface photometry in the g and r bands. The similarity of the\nphotometric properties of these dwarfs to those of Local Group dwarfs suggest\nmembership to the M101 group complex. The sky distribution of the candidates\nfollows the thin planar structure outlined by the known members of the three\nsubgroups. The ~3Mpc long filamentary structure has a rms thickness of 67 kpc.\nThe planar structure of the embedded M101 subgroup is even thinner, with rms=46\nkpc. The formation of this structure might be due to the expansion of the Local\nVoid to which it borders. Other implications are discussed as well. We show the\nviability of SDSS data to extend the sample of dwarfs in the local universe and\ntest cosmological models on small scales.\n", "  We present a 2.5-dimensional charge-conservative electromagnetic\nparticle-in-cell (EM-PIC) algorithm optimized for the analysis of vacuum\nelectronic devices (VED) with cylindrical symmetry (axisymmetry). We explore\nthe axisymmetry present in the device geometry, fields, and sources to reduce\nthe dimensionality of the problem from 3D to 2D. Further, we explore\n`transformation optics' principles to map the original problem in polar\ncoordinates to an equivalent problem on Cartesian coordinates with an effective\n(artificial) inhomogeneous medium introduced. The resulting problem in the\nmeridian plane is discretized using an unstructured 2D mesh considering\nTE-polarized fields and properly scaled charges. EM field and source variables\n(node-based charges and edge-based currents) are expressed as differential\nforms of various degrees, and discretized using Whitney forms. Using leapfrog\ntime integration, we obtain a mixed finite-element time-domain scheme for the\nfull-discrete Maxwell's equations. We achieve a local and explicit time-update\nfor the field equations by employing the sparse approximate inverse (SPAI)\nalgorithm. Interpolating field values to particles' positions for solving\nNewton-Lorentz equations of motion is also done via Whitney forms. Particles\nare advanced using the Boris algorithm with a relativistic correction. In the\nscatter step, we apply a radial scaling factor on top of a charge-conserving\nscatter scheme tailored for 2-dimensional unstructured grids. As validation\nexamples, we demonstrate simulations that investigate the physical performance\nof VEDs designed to harness particle bunching effects arising from the coherent\n(resonance) Cerenkov electron beam interactions within micromachined slow-wave\nstructures.\n", "  Distant galaxies encapsulate the various stages of galaxy evolution and\nformation from over 95% of the development of the universe. As early as\ntwenty-five years ago, little was known about them, however since the first\nsystematic survey was completed in the 1990s, increasing amounts of resources\nhave been devoted to their discovery and research. This book summarises for the\nfirst time the numerous techniques used for observing, analysing, and\nunderstanding the evolution and formation of these distant galaxies.\n  In this rapidly expanding research field, this text is an every-day companion\nhandbook for graduate students and active researchers. It provides guidelines\nin sample selection, imaging, integrated spectroscopy and 3D spectroscopy,\nwhich help to avoid the numerous pitfalls of observational and analysis\ntechniques in use in extragalactic astronomy. It also paves the way for\nestablishing relations between fundamental properties of distant galaxies. At\neach step, the reader is assisted with numerous practical examples and\nready-to-use methodology to help understand and analyse research.\n", "  The secular approximation of the hierarchical three body systems has been\nproven to be very useful in addressing many astrophysical systems, from\nplanets, stars to black holes. In such a system two objects are on a tight\norbit, and the tertiary is on a much wider orbit. Here we study the dynamics of\na system by taking the tertiary mass to zero and solve the hierarchical three\nbody system up to the octupole level of approximation. We find a rich dynamics\nthat the outer orbit undergoes due to gravitational perturbations from the\ninner binary. The nominal result of the precession of the nodes is mostly\nlimited for the lowest order of approximation, however, when the octupole-level\nof approximation is introduced the system becomes chaotic, as expected, and the\ntertiary oscillates below and above 90deg, similarly to the non-test particle\nflip behavior (e.g., Naoz 2016). We provide the Hamiltonian of the system and\ninvestigate the dynamics of the system from the quadrupole to the octupole\nlevel of approximations. We also analyze the chaotic and quasi-periodic orbital\nevolution by studying the surfaces of sections. Furthermore, including general\nrelativity, we show case the long term evolution of individual debris disk\nparticles under the influence of a far away interior eccentric planet. We show\nthat this dynamics can naturally result in retrograde objects and a puffy disk\nafter a long timescale evolution (few Gyr) for initially aligned configuration.\n", "  $Background:$ Previous measurements of $\\beta$-delayed neutron emitters\ncomprise around 230 nuclei, spanning from the $^{8}$He up to $^{150}$La. Apart\nfrom $^{210}$Tl, with a minuscule branching ratio of 0.007\\%, no other neutron\nemitter is measured yet beyond $A=150$. Therefore new data are needed,\nparticularly in the heavy mass region around N=126, in order to guide\ntheoretical models and to understand the formation of the third r-process peak\nat $A\\sim195$.\n  $Purpose:$ To measure both, $\\beta$-decay half-lives and neutron branching\nratios of several neutron-rich Au, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi isotopes beyond $N=126$.\n  $Method:$ Ions of interest are produced by fragmentation of a $^{238}$U beam,\nselected and identified via the GSI-FRS fragment separator. A stack of\nsegmented silicon detectors (SIMBA) is used to measure ion-implants and\n$\\beta$-decays. An array of 30 $^3$He tubes embedded in a polyethylene matrix\n(BELEN) is used to detect neutrons with high efficiency and selectivity. A\nself-triggered digital system is employed to acquire data and to enable\ntime-correlations. The latter are analyzed with an analytical model and results\nfor the half-lives and neutron-branching ratios are derived using the binned\nMaximum-Likelihood method.\n  $Results:$ Twenty new $\\beta$-decay half-lives are reported for\n$^{204-206}$Au, $^{208-211}$Hg,$^{211-216}$Tl,$^{215-218}$Pb and\n$^{218-220}$Bi, nine of them for the first time. Neutron emission probabilities\nare reported for $^{210,211}$Hg and $^{211-216}$Tl.\n  $Conclusions:$ The new $\\beta$-decay half-lives are in good agreement with\nprevious measurements in this region. The measured neutron emission\nprobabilities are comparable or smaller than values predicted by global models\nlike RHB+RQRPA.\n", "  The study of relativistic Coulomb systems in velocity space is prompted by\nthe fact that the study of Newtonian Kepler/Coulomb systems in velocity space,\nalthough less familiar than the analytic solutions in ordinary space, provides\na much simpler (also more elegant) method. The simplicity and elegance of the\nvelocity-space method derives from the linearity of the velocity equation,\nwhich is the unique feature of $1/r$ interactions for Newtonian and\nrelativistic systems alike. The various types of possible trajectories are\npresented, their properties deduced from the orbits in velocity space,\naccompanied with illustrations. In particular, it is found that the orbits\ntraversed in the relativistic velocity space (which is hyperbolic ($H^3$)\nrather than Euclidean) are epicyclic -- circles whose centres also rotate --\nthus the title.\n", "  The observation and imaging of hundreds or thousands of radio sources with\nthe technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a computationally\nintensive task. However, these surveys allow us to conduct statistical\ninvestigations of large source samples, and also to discover new phenomena or\ntypes of objects. The field of view of these high-resolution VLBI imaging\nobservations is typically a few arcseconds at cm wavelengths. For practical\nreasons, often a much smaller fraction of the field, the central region is\nimaged only. With an automated process we imaged the ~1.5-arcsec radius fields\naround more than 1000 radio sources, and found a variety of extended radio\nstructures. Some of them are yet unknown in the literature.\n", "  We demonstrate the measurement of mass of the absorbing micro-particle\ntrapped in air by optical forced oscillation. When the trapping light intensity\nis modulated sinusoidally, the particle in the trap undergoes forced\noscillation and the amplitude of the oscillation depends directly on the\nmodulated frequency. Based on a simple spring model, we fit the amplitudes\nversus the modulated frequencies and obtain the stiffness of the optical trap\nand the mass of the trapped particle. The fitting results show that, for a\ncertain particle, the stiffness varies linearly with the trapping light\nintensity while the mass is consistent. The density of the micro-particle is\nthen estimated and could be used to classify different kinds of absorbing\nparticles, like C and CuO.\n", "  We study the dynamics of seeded plasma blobs and depletions in an (effective)\ngravitational field. For incompressible flows the radial center of mass\nvelocity of blobs and depletions is proportional to the square root of their\ninitial cross-field size and amplitude. If the flows are compressible, this\nscaling holds only for ratios of amplitude to size larger than a critical\nvalue. Otherwise, the maximum blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on\nthe initial amplitude and is independent of size. In both cases the\nacceleration of blobs and depletions depends on their initial amplitude\nrelative to the background plasma density, is proportional to gravity and\nindependent of their cross-field size. Due to their reduced inertia plasma\ndepletions accelerate more quickly than the corresponding blobs. These scaling\nlaws are derived from the invariants of the governing drift-fluid equations and\nagree excellently with numerical simulations over five orders of magnitude. We\nsuggest an empirical model that unifies and correctly captures the radial\nacceleration and maximum velocities of both blobs and depletions.\n", "  We report the detection of the prebiotic molecule CH3NCO in a solar-type\nprotostar, IRAS16293-2422 B. A significant abundance of this species on the\nsurface of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has been proposed, and it has\nrecently been detected in hot cores around high-mass protostars. We observed\nIRAS16293-2422 B with ALMA in the 90 GHz to 265 GHz range, and detected 8\nunblended transitions of CH3NCO. From our Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\nanalysis we derived an excitation temperature of 110+-19 K and a column density\nof (4.0+-0.3)x10^15 cm^-2 , which results in an abundance of\n<=(1.4+-0.1)x10^-10 with respect to molecular hydrogen. This implies a\nCH3NCO/HNCO and CH3NCO/NH2CHO column density ratios of ~0.08. Our modelling of\nthe chemistry of CH3NCO suggests that both ice surface and gas phase formation\nreactions of this molecule are needed to explain the observations.\n", "  A new collection of photodissociation and photoionisation cross sections for\n102 atoms and molecules of astrochemical interest has been assembled, along\nwith a brief review of the basic processes involved. These have been used to\ncalculate dissociation and ionisation rates, with uncertainties, in a standard\nultraviolet interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and wavelength-dependent\nradiation fields. The new ISRF rates generally agree within 30% with our\nprevious compilations, with a few notable exceptions. The reduction of rates in\nshielded regions was calculated as a function of dust, molecular and atomic\nhydrogen, atomic C, and self-shielding column densities. The relative\nimportance of shielding types depends on the species in question and the dust\noptical properties. The new data are publicly available from the Leiden\nphotodissociation and ionisation database.\n  Sensitivity of rates to variation of temperature and isotope, and cross\nsection uncertainties, are tested. Tests were conducted with an\ninterstellar-cloud chemical model, and find general agreement (within a factor\nof two) with the previous iteration of the Leiden database for the ISRF, and\norder-of-magnitude variations assuming various kinds of stellar radiation. The\nnewly parameterised dust-shielding factors makes a factor-of-two difference to\nmany atomic and molecular abundances relative to parameters currently in the\nUDfA and KIDA astrochemical reaction databases. The newly-calculated cosmic-ray\ninduced photodissociation and ionisation rates differ from current standard\nvalues up to a factor of 5. Under high temperature and cosmic-ray-flux\nconditions the new rates alter the equilibrium abundances of abundant dark\ncloud abundances by up to a factor of two. The partial cross sections for H2O\nand NH3 photodissociation forming OH, O, NH2 and NH are also evaluated and lead\nto radiation-field-dependent branching ratios.\n", "  In hierarchical structure formation scenarios, merging galaxies are expected\nto be seen in different phases of their coalescence. Simulations suggest that\nsimultaneous activity of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centres of\nthe merging galaxies may be expected at kpc-scale separations. Currently, there\nare no direct observational methods which allow the selection of a large number\nof such dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. SDSS J142507.32+323137.4\nwas reported as a promising candidate source based on its optical spectrum.\nHere we report on our sensitive e-MERLIN observations performed at $1.6$ and at\n$5$ GHz, which show that the optical spectrum of the source can be more\nstraightforwardly explained with jet-cloud interactions instead of the dual AGN\nscenario.\n", "  We derive equations of motion for topological solitons in antiferromagnets\nunder the combined action of perturbations such as an external magnetic field\nand torque-generating electrical current. Aside from conservative forces, such\nperturbations generate an effective \"magnetic field\" exerting a gyrotropic\nforce on the soliton and an induced \"electric field\" if the perturbation is\ntime-dependent. We apply the general formalism to the cases of a domain wall\nand of a vortex. An antiferromagnetic vortex can be effectively moved by\ncombined applications of a magnetic field and an electric current.\n", "  Considering $2\\to 2$ gauge-theory scattering with general colour in the\nhigh-energy limit, we compute the Regge-cut contribution to three loops through\nnext-to-next-to-leading high-energy logarithms (NNLL) in the signature-odd\nsector. Our formalism is based on using the non-linear Balitsky-JIMWLK rapidity\nevolution equation to derive an effective Hamiltonian acting on states with a\nfixed number of Reggeized gluons. A new effect occurring first at NNLL is\nmixing between states with $k$ and $k+2$ Reggeized gluons due non-diagonal\nterms in this Hamiltonian. Our results are consistent with a recent\ndetermination of the infrared structure of scattering amplitudes at three\nloops, as well as a computation of $2\\to 2$ gluon scattering in ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper Yang-Mills theory. Combining the latter with our Regge-cut calculation we\nextract the three-loop Regge trajectory in this theory. Our results open the\nway to predict high-energy logarithms through NNLL at higher-loop orders.\n", "  Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in ferromagnetic metals (FM) can also be used\nto detect the spin current generated by longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in a\nferromagnetic insulator YIG. However, anomalous Nernst effect(ANE) in FM itself\nalways mixes in the thermal voltage. In this work, the exchange bias structure\n(NiFe/IrMn)is employed to separate these two effects. The exchange bias\nstructure provides a shift field to NiFe, which can separate the magnetization\nof NiFe from that of YIG in M-H loops. As a result, the ISHE related to\nmagnetization of YIG and the ANE related to the magnetization of NiFe can be\nseparated as well. By comparison with Pt, a relative spin Hall angle of NiFe\n(0.87) is obtained, which results from the partially filled 3d orbits and the\nferromagnetic order. This work puts forward a practical method to use the ISHE\nin ferromagnetic metals towards future spintronic applications.\n", "  A new approach to three-dimensional (3D) dosimetry based on\noptically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) is presented. By embedding OSL-active\nparticles into a transparent silicone matrix (PDMS), the well-established\ndosimetric properties of an OSL material are exploited in a 3D-OSL dosimeter.\nBy investigating prototype dosimeters in standard cuvettes in combination with\nsmall test samples for OSL readers, it is shown that a sufficient transparency\nof the 3D-OSL material can be combined with an OSL response giving an estimated\n>10.000 detected photons in 1 second per 1mm3 voxel of the dosimeter at a dose\nof 1 Gy. The dose distribution in the 3D-OSL dosimeters can be directly read\nout optically without the need for subsequent reconstruction by computational\ninversion algorithms. The dosimeters carry the advantages known from\npersonal-dosimetry use of OSL: the dose distribution following irradiation can\nbe stored with minimal fading for extended periods of time, and dosimeters are\nreusable as they can be reset, e.g. by an intense (bleaching) light field.\n", "  Using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations we investigate a dense system of\ncharged colloids exposed to shear flow in a confined (slit-pore) geometry. The\nequilibrium system at zero flow consists of three, well-pronounced layers with\nsquare-like crystalline in-plane structure. We demonstrate that, for\nsufficiently large shear rates, the middle layer separates into two sublayers\nwhere the particles organize into moving lanes with opposite velocities. The\nformation of this micro-laned state results in a destruction of the applied\nshear profile. It has a strong impact not only on the structure of the system,\nbut also on its rheology as measured by the stress tensor. At higher shear\nrates we observe a disordered state and finally a recrystallization reminiscent\nof the behavior of bilayer films. We expect the shear-induced laning to be a\ngeneric feature of thin films with three or more layers.\n", "  We discuss several new bi-Hamiltonian integrable systems on the plane with\nintegrals of motion of third, fourth and sixth order in momenta. The\ncorresponding variables of separation, separated relations, compatible Poisson\nbrackets and recursion operators are also presented in the framework of the\nJacobi method.\n", "  In this paper we explore the idea that black holes can persist in a universe\nthat collapses to a big crunch and then bounces into a new phase of expansion.\nWe use a scalar field to model the matter content of such a universe {near the\ntime} of the bounce, and look for solutions that represent a network of black\nholes within a dynamical cosmology. We find exact solutions to Einstein's\nconstraint equations that provide the geometry of space at the minimum of\nexpansion and that can be used as initial data for the evolution of\nhyperspherical cosmologies. These solutions illustrate that there exist models\nin which multiple distinct black holes can persist through a bounce, and allow\nfor concrete computations of quantities such as the black hole filling factor.\nWe then consider solutions in flat cosmologies, as well as in\nhigher-dimensional spaces (with up to nine spatial dimensions). We derive\nconditions for the black holes to remain distinct (i.e. avoid merging) and\nhence persist into the new expansion phase. Some potentially interesting\nconsequences of these models are also discussed.\n", "  The Horizon Quantum Mechanics is an approach that was previously introduced\nin order to analyse the gravitational radius of spherically symmetric systems\nand compute the probability that a given quantum state is a black hole. In this\nwork, we first extend the formalism to general space-times with asymptotic\n(ADM) mass and angular momentum. We then apply the extended Horizon Quantum\nMechanics to a harmonic model of rotating corpuscular black holes. We find that\nsimple configurations of this model naturally suppress the appearance of the\ninner horizon and seem to disfavour extremal (macroscopic) geometries.\n", "  We study a scattering on an ultra-low potential in zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon. Using mathematical framework based on the continuous Dirac model\nand augumented scattering matrix, we derive a condition for the existence of a\ntrapped mode. We consider the threshold energies where the continuous spectrum\nchanges its multiplicity and show that the trapped modes may appear for\nenergies slightly less than a threshold and its multiplicity does not exceeds\none. We prove that trapped modes do not appear outside the threshold, provided\nthe potential is sufficiently small.\n", "  The extended X-ray emission observed at arcsec scales along the propagation\ntrajectory of the precessing relativistic jets of the Galactic microquasar SS\n433 features a broad emission line, with the position of the centroid being\nsignificantly different for the approaching and receding jets ($ \\approx7.3 $\nand $ \\approx6.4 $ keV, respectively). These observed line positions are at\nodds with the predictions of the kinematic model for any of the plausible\nbright spectral lines in this band, raising the question of their\nidentification. Here we address this issue by taking into account time delays\nof the emission coming from the receding regions of the jets relative to that\nfrom the approaching ones, which cause a substantial phase shift and distortion\nof the predicted line positions for the extended ($ \\sim 10^{17}$ cm) emission\ncompared to the X-ray and optical lines observed from the central source\n(emitted at distances $ \\sim 10^{11}$ cm and $ \\sim 10^{15}$ cm, respectively).\nWe demonstrate that the observed line positions are fully consistent with the\nFe XXVI Ly$\\alpha$ ($E_0=6.96$ keV) line emerging from a region of size $\n\\sim6\\times10^{16}$ cm along the jet. This supports the idea that intensive\nreheating of the jets up to temperatures $ \\gtrsim10 $ keV takes place at these\ndistances, probably as a result of partial deceleration of the jets due to\ninteraction with the surrounding medium, which might cause collisions between\ndiscrete dense blobs inside the jets.\n", "  The Auger collaboration has observed the number of muons which is higher than\nits prediction by existing hadronic interaction models. We explain this excess\nof muons by using Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in photon sector. As an\noutcome of Lorentz invariance violation, the dispersion relation of photon gets\nmodified, which we use for the calculation of $\\pi^0$ decay width. In the Auger\ndata of primary energy $10^{9.8}<E(\\mbox{GeV})<10^{10.2}$, we find that the\nneutral pion decay width is suppressed in comparison to its standard model (SM)\ncounterpart. As a result, we get a large number of muons explaining the\nobserved muon excess. We consider Planck suppressed LIV at order\n$\\mathcal{O}(p^2/M^2_{\\tiny \\mbox{Pl}})$ for studying the photon sector, which\nis in agreement with the current bounds, and not as tightly constrained as LIV\nat order $\\mathcal{O}(p/M_{\\tiny \\mbox{Pl}})$.\n", "  We study a single quantized vortex in the fermionic component of a mixture of\nFermi superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensate. As the density ratio between the\nboson and the fermion components is tuned, we identify a transition in the\nvortex-core structure, across which fermions in the vortex core become\ncompletely depleted even in the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime.\nThis is accompanied by changes in key properties of the vortex state, as well\nas by the localization of the Bose-Einstein condensate in the vortex core. The\ntransition in the vortex-core structure can be experimentally probed in\nBose-Fermi superfluid mixtures by detecting the size and visibility of the\nvortices.\n", "  We have already proposed a quark and lepton mass matrix model based on\nU(3)$\\times$U(3)$'$ family symmetry as the so-called Yukawaon model, in which\nthe U(3) symmetry is broken by VEVs of flavons $(\\Phi_f)_i^{\\ \\alpha}$ which\nare $({\\bf 3}, {\\bf 3}^*)$ of U(3)$\\times$U(3)$'$. The model has successfully\nprovided the unified description of quark and lepton masses and mixings by\nusing the observed charged lepton masses as only family-number dependent input\nparameters. Our next concern is scales of VEVs of the flavons. In the present\npaper, we estimate the magnitudes of the VEV scales of flavons of the model\nwhich is newly reconstructed without changing the previous phenomenological\nsuccess of parameter fitting for masses and mixings of quarks and leptons. We\nestimate that VEVs of flavons with $({\\bf 8+1}, {\\bf 1})$, $({\\bf 3}, {\\bf\n3}^*)$, and $({\\bf 1}, {\\bf 8+1})$ are of 25the orders of $10$ TeV, $10^4$ TeV,\nand $10^7$ TeV, respectively.\n", "  Muon beams of low emittance provide the basis for the intense,\nwell-characterised neutrino beams necessary to elucidate the physics of flavour\nat a neutrino factory and to provide lepton-antilepton collisions at energies\nof up to several TeV at a muon collider. The international Muon Ionization\nCooling Experiment (MICE) aims to demonstrate ionization cooling, the technique\nby which it is proposed to reduce the phase-space volume occupied by the muon\nbeam at such facilities. In an ionization-cooling channel, the muon beam passes\nthrough a material in which it loses energy. The energy lost is then replaced\nusing RF cavities. The combined effect of energy loss and re-acceleration is to\nreduce the transverse emittance of the beam (transverse cooling). A major\nrevision of the scope of the project was carried out over the summer of 2014.\nThe revised experiment can deliver a demonstration of ionization cooling. The\ndesign of the cooling demonstration experiment will be described together with\nits predicted cooling performance.\n", "  Variations of the X-ray spectral slope have been found in many Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) at moderate luminosities and redshifts, typically showing\na \"softer when brighter\" behaviour. However, similar studies are not usually\nperformed for high-luminosity AGNs. We present an analysis of the spectral\nvariability based on a large sample of quasars in wide intervals of luminosity\nand redshift, measured at several different epochs, extracted from the fifth\nrelease of the XMM Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue. Our analysis confirms\na \"softer when brighter\" trend also for our sample, extending to high\nluminosity and redshift the general behaviour previously found. These results\ncan be understood in light of current spectral models, such as intrinsic\nvariations of the X-ray primary radiation, or superposition with a constant\nreflection component.\n", "  Flux ratio anomalies in quasar lenses can be attributed to dark matter\nsubstructure surrounding the lensing galaxy and, thus, used to constrain the\nsubstructure mass fraction. Previous applications of this approach infer a\nsubstructure abundance that potentially in tension with the predictions of a\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, the assumption that all flux ratio anomalies\nare due to substructure is a strong one, and alternative explanations have not\nbeen fully investigated. Here, we use new high-resolution near-IR Keck~II\nadaptive optics imaging for the lens system CLASS B0712+472 to perform\npixel-based lens modelling for this system and, in combination with new VLBA\nradio observations, show that the inclusion of the disc in the lens model can\nexplain the flux ratio anomalies without the need for dark matter\nsubstructures. The projected disc mass comprises 16% of the total lensing mass\nwithin the Einstein radius and the total disc mass is $1.79 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{sun}$. The case of B0712+472 adds to the evidence that not all flux ratio\nanomalies are due to dark subhaloes, and highlights the importance of taking\nthe effects of baryonic structures more fully into account in order to obtain\nan accurate measure of the substructure mass fraction.\n", "  Thermal convection in a horizontal layer with uniform internal heating and\nstress-free constant-temperature boundaries is analyzed numerically. The work\nis motivated by the questions arising in development of liquid metal batteries,\nin which convection is induced by the Joule heating of electrolyte. It is\ndemonstrated that three-dimensional convection cells exist at subcritical\nRayleigh numbers.\n", "  We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional interacting fermion system\ndescribed by the Luttinger model starting from a nonequilibrium state defined\nby a smooth temperature profile $T(x)$. As a specific example we consider the\ncase when $T(x)$ is equal to $T_L$ ($T_R$) far to the left (right). Using a\nseries expansion in $\\epsilon = 2(T_{R} - T_{L})/(T_{L}+T_{R})$, we compute the\nenergy density, the heat current density, and the fermion two-point correlation\nfunction for all times $t \\geq 0$. For local (delta-function) interactions, the\nfirst two are computed to all orders, giving simple exact expressions involving\nthe Schwarzian derivative of the integral of $T(x)$. For nonlocal interactions,\nbreaking scale invariance, we compute the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) to\nall orders and the evolution to first order in $\\epsilon$. The heat current in\nthe NESS is universal even when conformal invariance is broken by the\ninteractions, and its dependence on $T_{L,R}$ agrees with numerical results for\nthe $XXZ$ spin chain. Moreover, our analytical formulas predict peaks at short\ntimes in the transition region between different temperatures and show\ndispersion effects that, even if nonuniversal, are qualitatively similar to\nones observed in numerical simulations for related models, such as spin chains\nand interacting lattice fermions.\n", "  The extent of phase separation and water percolation in sulfonated membranes\nare the key to their performance in fuel cells. Toward this, the effect of\nhydration on the morphology and transport characteristics of sulfonated\npoly(ether ether ketone), sPEEK, membrane is investigated using atomistic\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation at various hydration levels ({\\lambda}:\nnumber of water molecules per sulfonate group) between 4 and 15. At the\nmolecular level, the evolution of local morphology is investigated in terms of\nstructural pair correlations and minimum pair distances, and the transport\nproperties are studied in terms of mean squared displacements (MSDs) and\ndiffusion coefficients. The water-sulfur interaction in sPEEK is found to be\nstronger than that in Nafion, as observed in experiments. As opposed to Nafion,\na weaker interaction of hydronium, with sulfonate, than water is observed. The\nbehavior of water in sPEEK membrane is found to remain far from bulk as\nindicated by its diffusion coefficient. Analysis of simulation data indicate\nthat at low {\\lambda}, the largest water cluster forms a narrow connected path\nof water molecules and hydronium ions. With increasing {\\lambda}, larger water\ndomains appear, spanning more than half of the simulation box at {\\lambda} =\n15. Small isolated clusters are present at all hydration levels, demonstrating\nthe extent of phase separation in sPEEK to be lesser than that in Nafion.\nVarious analyses, both at molecular and collective level, suggest the\noccurrence of a percolation transition between {\\lambda} = 8 and 10, which\nleads to a connected network of water channels in the membrane, thereby\nboosting the mobility of hydronium ions.\n", "  Community structure is an important structural property that extensively\nexists in various complex networks. In the past decade, much attention has been\npaid to the design of community-detection methods, but analyzing the behaviors\nof the methods is also of interest in the theoretical research and real\napplications. Here, we focus on an important measure for community structure,\nsignificance [Sci. Rep. 3 (2013) 2930]. Specifically, we study the effect of\nvarious network parameters on this measure in detail, analyze the critical\nbehaviors of it in partition transition, and analytically give the formula of\nthe critical points and the phase diagrams. The results shows that the critical\nnumber of communities in partition transition increases dramatically with the\ndifference between inter- and intra-community link densities, and thus\nsignificance optimization displays higher resolution in community detection\nthan many other methods, but it is also easily to lead to the excessive\nsplitting of communities. By Louvain algorithm for significance optimization,\nwe confirmed the theoretical results on artificial and real-world networks, and\ngive a series of comparisons with some classical methods.\n", "  We compute perturbative QCD corrections to $B \\to D$ form factors at leading\npower in $\\Lambda/m_b$, at large hadronic recoil, from the light-cone sum rules\n(LCSR) with $B$-meson distribution amplitudes in HQET. QCD factorization for\nthe vacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation function with an interpolating current for\nthe $D$-meson is demonstrated explicitly at one loop with the power counting\nscheme $m_c \\sim {\\cal O} \\left (\\sqrt{\\Lambda \\, m_b} \\right ) $. The jet\nfunctions encoding information of the hard-collinear dynamics in the\nabove-mentioned correlation function are complicated by the appearance of an\nadditional hard-collinear scale $m_c$, compared to the counterparts entering\nthe factorization formula of the vacuum-to-$B$-meson correction function for\nthe construction of $B \\to \\pi$ from factors. Inspecting the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic sum rules for the form factors of $B \\to D \\ell\n\\nu$ indicates that perturbative corrections to the hard-collinear functions\nare more profound than that for the hard functions, with the default theory\ninputs, in the physical kinematic region. We further compute the subleading\npower correction induced by the three-particle quark-gluon distribution\namplitudes of the $B$-meson at tree level employing the background gluon field\napproach. The LCSR predictions for the semileptonic $B \\to D \\ell \\nu$ form\nfactors are then extrapolated to the entire kinematic region with the\n$z$-series parametrization. Phenomenological implications of our determinations\nfor the form factors $f_{BD}^{+, 0}(q^2)$ are explored by investigating the\n(differential) branching fractions and the $R(D)$ ratio of $B \\to D \\ell \\nu$\nand by determining the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from the total decay rate\nof $B \\to D \\mu \\nu_{\\mu}$.\n", "  Spin impurities in diamond have emerged as a promising building block in a\nwide range of solid-state-based quantum technologies. The negatively charged\nsilicon-vacancy centre combines the advantages of its high-quality photonic\nproperties with a ground-state electronic spin, which can be read out\noptically. However, for this spin to be operational as a quantum bit, full\nquantum control is essential. Here, we report the measurement of optically\ndetected magnetic resonance and the demonstration of coherent control of a\nsingle silicon-vacancy centre spin with a microwave field. Using Ramsey\ninterferometry, we directly measure a spin coherence time, T2*, of 115 +/- 9 ns\nat 3.6 K. The temperature dependence of coherence times indicates that\ndephasing and decay of the spin arise from single phonon-mediated excitation\nbetween orbital branches of the ground state. Our results enable the\nsilicon-vacancy centre spin to become a controllable resource to establish\nspin-photon quantum interfaces.\n", "  We study fluctuations of particle absorption by a three-dimensional domain\nwith multiple absorbing patches. The domain is in contact with a gas of\ninteracting diffusing particles. This problem is motivated by living cell\nsensing via multiple receptors distributed over the cell surface. Employing the\nmacroscopic fluctuation theory, we calculate the covariance matrix of the\nparticle absorption by different patches, extending previous works which\naddressed fluctuations of a single current. We find a condition when the sign\nof correlations between different patches is fully determined by the transport\ncoefficients of the gas and is independent of the problem's geometry. We show\nthat the fluctuating particle flux field typically develops vorticity. We\nestablish a simple connection between the statistics of particle absorption by\nall the patches combined and the statistics of current in a non-equilibrium\nsteady state in one dimension. We also discuss connections between the\nabsorption statistics and (i) statistics of electric currents in multi-terminal\ndiffusive conductors and (ii) statistics of wave transmission through\ndisordered media with multiple absorbers.\n", "  A small fraction of Tidal Disruption Events (TDE) produce relativistic jets,\nevidenced by their non-thermal X-ray spectra and transient radio emission. Here\nwe present milliarcsecond-resolution imaging results on TDE J1644+5734 with the\nEuropean VLBI Network (EVN). These provide a strong astrometric constraint on\nthe average apparent jet velocity <0.27, that constrains the intrinsic jet\nvelocity for a given viewing angle.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of charge transfer on the intensity of driving\nlaser field when SiO2 crystal is irradiated by an 800 nm laser. It is\nsurprising that the direction of charge transfer undergoes a sudden reversal\nwhen the driving laser intensity exceeds critical values with different carrier\nenvelope phases. By applying quantum-trajectory analysis, we find that the\nBloch oscillation plays an important role in charge transfer in solid. Also, we\nstudy the interaction of strong laser with gallium nitride (GaN) that is widely\nused in optoelectronics. A pump-probe scheme is applied to control the quantum\ntrajectories of the electrons in the conduction band. The signal of charge\ntransfer is controlled successfully by means of theoretically proposed\napproach.\n", "  We consider simplified dark matter models where a dark matter candidate\ncouples to the standard model (SM) particles via an $s$-channel spin-2\nmediator, and study constraints on the model parameter space from the current\nLHC data. Our focus lies on the complementarity among different searches, in\nparticular monojet and multijet plus missing energy searches and resonance\nsearches. For universal couplings of the mediator to SM particles,\nmissing-energy searches can give stronger constraints than $WW$, $ZZ$, dijet,\ndihiggs, $t\\bar t$, $b\\bar b$ resonance searches in the low-mass region and/or\nwhen the coupling of the mediator to dark matter is much larger than its\ncouplings to SM particles. The strongest constraints however come from diphoton\nand dilepton resonance searches. Only if these modes are suppressed,\nmissing-energy searches can be competitive in constraining dark matter models\nwith a spin-2 mediator.\n", "  We experimentally study quasi-2d dilute granular flow around intruders whose\nshape, size and relative impact speed are systematically varied. Direct\nmeasurement of the flow field reveals that three in-principle independent\nmeasurements of the non-uniformity of the flow field are in fact all linearly\nrelated: 1) granular temperature, 2) flow field divergence and 3) shear-strain\nrate. The shock front is defined as the local maxima in each of these\nmeasurements. The shape of the shock front is well described by an inverted\ncatenary and is driven by the formation of a dynamic arch during steady flow.\nWe find universality in the functional form of the shock front within the range\nof experimental values probed. Changing the intruder size, concavity and impact\nspeed only results in a scaling and shifting of the shock front. We\nindependently measure the horizontal lift force on the intruder and find that\nit can be understood as a result of the interplay between the shock profile and\nthe intruder shape.\n", "  We demonstrate that the key to realizing arbitrary control over pairs of\npolarization states of light, i.e. transforming an arbitrarily polarized pair\nof input states to an arbitrarily polarized pair of output states, is the\nability to generate pairs of states with orthogonal polarizations from\nnon-orthogonal pairs of initial states. We then develop a new class of\nnon-Hermitian meta-materials, termed complex birefringent meta-materials, which\nare able to do exactly this. Such materials could facilitate the detection of\nsmall polarization changes in scattering experiments, as well as enable new\npolarization multiplexing schemes in communications networks.\n", "  We analytically solve the full next-to-leading logarithmic Balitsky-Kovchegov\nequation in the saturation regime, which includes corrections from quark and\ngluon loops, and large double transverse logarithms. The analytic result for\nthe $S$-matrix in the saturation regime shows that the linear rapidity decrease\nwith rapidity of the exponent in running coupling case is replaced by rapidity\nraised to power of 3/2 decreasing. The collinearly-improved Balitsky-Kovchegov\nequation are also analytically solved in the saturation regime. It shows that\nthe double collinear logarithms do not contribute to the $S$-matrix and the\nsolution is the same as the one obtained from the leading order\nBalitsky-Kovchegov equation. The numerical solutions to the leading order and\nfull next-to-leading logarithmic Balitsky-Kovchegov equations are performed in\norder to test the analytic results derived in the saturation regime.\n", "  Sky models have been used in the past to calibrate individual low radio\nfrequency telescopes. Here we generalize this approach from a single antenna to\na two element interferometer and formulate the problem in a manner to allow us\nto estimate the flux density of the Sun using the normalized cross-correlations\n(visibilities) measured on a low resolution interferometric baseline. For wide\nfield-of-view instruments, typically the case at low radio frequencies, this\napproach can provide robust absolute solar flux calibration for well\ncharacterized antennas and receiver systems. It can provide a reliable and\ncomputationally lean method for extracting parameters of physical interest\nusing a small fraction of the voluminous interferometric data, which can be\nprohibitingly compute intensive to calibrate and image using conventional\napproaches. We demonstrate this technique by applying it to data from the\nMurchison Widefield Array and assess its reliability.\n", "  Smectic liquid crystals are charcterized by layers that have a preferred\nuniform spacing and vanishing curvature in their ground state. Dislocations in\nthe smectics play an important role in phase nucleation, layer reorientation,\nand dynamics. Typically modeled as possessing one line singularity, the layer\nstructure of a dislocation leads to a diverging compression strain as one\napproaches the defect center, suggesting a large, elastically determined melted\ncore. However, it has been observed that for large charge dislocations, the\ndefect breaks up into two disclinations [C. E. Williams, Philos. Mag. 32, 313\n(1975)]. Here we investigate the topology of the composite core. Because the\nsmectic cannot twist, transformations between different disclination geometries\nare highly constrained. We demonstrate the geometric route between them and\nshow that despite enjoying precisely the topological rules of the\nthree-dimensional nematic, the additional structure of line disclinations in\nthree-dimensional smectics localizes transitions to higher-order point\nsingularities.\n", "  According to the currently favored picture, relativistic jets in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) are launched in the vicinity of the black hole by\nmagnetic fields extracting energy from the spinning black hole or the accretion\ndisk. In the past decades, various models from shocks to magnetic reconnection\nhave been proposed as the energy dissipation mechanism in the jets. This paper\npresents a short review on how linear polarization observations can be used to\nconstrain the magnetic field structure in the jets of AGN, and how the\nobservations can be used to constrain the various emission models.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei, hosting supermassive black holes and launching\nrelativistic jets, are the most numerous objects on the gamma-ray sky. At the\nother end of the mass scale, phenomena related to stellar mass black holes, in\nparticular gamma-ray bursts and microquasars, are also seen on the gamma-ray\nsky. While all of them are thought to launch relativistic jets, the diversity\neven within each of these classes is enormous. In this review, I will discuss\nrecent very high energy gamma-ray results that underline both the similarity of\nthe black hole systems, as well as their diversity.\n", "  An important source of innovation in nanophotonics is the idea to scale down\nknown radio wave technologies to the optical regime. One thoroughly\ninvestigated example of this approach are metallic nanoantennas which employ\nplasmonic resonances to couple localized emitters to selected far-field modes.\nWhile metals can be treated as perfect conductors in the microwave regime,\ntheir response becomes Drude-like at optical frequencies. Thus, plasmonic\nnanoantennas are inherently lossy. Moreover, their resonant nature requires\nprecise control of the antenna geometry. A promising way to circumvent these\nproblems is the use of broadband nanoantennas made from low-loss dielectric\nmaterials. Here, we report on highly directional emission from active\ndielectric leaky-wave nanoantennas made of Hafnium dioxide. Colloidal\nsemiconductor quantum dots deposited in the nanoantenna feed gap serve as a\nlocal light source. The emission patterns of active nanoantennas with different\nsizes are measured by Fourier imaging. We find for all antenna sizes a highly\ndirectional emission, underlining the broadband operation of our design.\n", "  In this paper we present a concept of quantum entanglement in time in a\ncontext of entangled consistent histories. These considerations are supported\nby presentation of necessary tools closely related to those acting on a space\nof spatial multipartite quantum states. We show that in similarity to monogamy\nof quantum entanglement in space, quantum entanglement in time is also endowed\nwith this property for a particular history. Basing on these observations, we\ndiscuss further bounding of temporal correlations and derive analytically the\nTsirelson bound implied by entangled histories for the Leggett-Garg\ninequalities.\n", "  Chaos is widely understood as being a consequence of sensitive dependence\nupon initial conditions. This is the result of an instability in phase space,\nwhich separates trajectories exponentially. Here, we demonstrate that this\ncriterion should be refined. Despite their overall intrinsic instability,\ntrajectories may be very strongly convergent in phase space over extremely long\nperiods, as revealed by our investigation of a simple chaotic system (a\nrealistic model for small bodies in a turbulent flow). We establish that this\nstrong convergence is a multi-facetted phenomenon, in which the clustering is\nintense, widespread and balanced by lacunarity of other regions. Power laws,\nindicative of scale-free features, characterise the distribution of particles\nin the system. We use large-deviation and extreme-value statistics to explain\nthe effect. Our results show that the interpretation of the 'butterfly effect'\nneeds to be carefully qualified. We argue that the combination of mixing and\nclustering processes makes our specific model relevant to understanding the\nevolution of simple organisms. Lastly, this notion of 'convergent chaos', which\nimplies the existence of conditions for which uncertainties are unexpectedly\nsmall, may also be relevant to the valuation of insurance and futures\ncontracts.\n", "  We implement a scale-free version of the pivot algorithm and use it to sample\npairs of three-dimensional self-avoiding walks, for the purpose of efficiently\ncalculating an observable that corresponds to the probability that pairs of\nself-avoiding walks remain self-avoiding when they are concatenated. We study\nthe properties of this Markov chain, and then use it to find the critical\nexponent $\\gamma$ for self-avoiding walks to unprecedented accuracy. Our final\nestimate for $\\gamma$ is $1.15695300(95)$.\n", "  Aluminum lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) sensitive to\nmillimeter-wave photons have been shown to exhibit high quality factors, making\nthem highly sensitive and multiplexable. The superconducting gap of aluminum\nlimits aluminum LEKIDs to photon frequencies above 100 GHz. Manganese-doped\naluminum (Al-Mn) has a tunable critical temperature and could therefore be an\nattractive material for LEKIDs sensitive to frequencies below 100 GHz if the\ninternal quality factor remains sufficiently high when manganese is added to\nthe film. To investigate, we measured some of the key properties of Al-Mn\nLEKIDs. A prototype eight-element LEKID array was fabricated using a 40 nm\nthick film of Al-Mn deposited on a 500 {\\mu}m thick high-resistivity,\nfloat-zone silicon substrate. The manganese content was 900 ppm, the measured\n$T_c = 694\\pm1$ mK, and the resonance frequencies were near 150 MHz. Using\nmeasurements of the forward scattering parameter $S_{21}$ at various bath\ntemperatures between 65 and 250 mK, we determined that the Al-Mn LEKIDs we\nfabricated have internal quality factors greater than $2 \\times 10^5$, which is\nhigh enough for millimeter-wave astrophysical observations. In the dark\nconditions under which these devices were measured, the fractional frequency\nnoise spectrum shows a shallow slope that depends on bath temperature and probe\ntone amplitude, which could be two-level system noise. The anticipated white\nphoton noise should dominate this level of low-frequency noise when the\ndetectors are illuminated with millimeter-waves in future measurements. The\nLEKIDs responded to light pulses from a 1550 nm light-emitting diode, and we\nused these light pulses to determine that the quasiparticle lifetime is 60\n{\\mu}s.\n", "  The cooling of solids by optical means only using anti-Stokes emission has a\nlong history of research and achievements. Such cooling methods have many\nadvantages ranging from no-moving parts or fluids through to operation in\nvacuum and may have applications to cryosurgery. However achieving large\noptical cryocooling powers has been difficult to achieve except in certain\nrare-earth crystals. Through study of the emission and absorption cross\nsections we find that diamond, containing either NV or SiV (Nitrogen or Silicon\nvacancy), defects shows potential for optical cryocooling and in particular, NV\ndoping shows promise for optical refrigeration. We study the optical cooling of\ndoped diamond microcrystals ranging 10-250 microns in diameter trapped either\nin vacuum or in water. For the vacuum case we find NV-doped microdiamond\noptical cooling below room temperature could exceed 10 Kelvin, for irradiation\npowers of P< 100 mW. We predict that such temperature changes should be easily\nobserved via large alterations in the diffusion constant for optically\ncryocooled microdiamonds trapped in water in an optical tweezer or via\nspectroscopic signatures such as the ZPL width or Raman line.\n", "  Here we generalize ideas of unified Dark Matter Dark Energy in the context of\nTwo Measure Theories and of Dynamical space time Theories. In Two Measure\nTheories one uses metric independent volume elements and this allows to\nconstruct unified Dark Matter Dark Energy, where the cosmological constant\nappears as an integration constant associated to the equation of motion of the\nmeasure fields. The Dynamical space time Theories generalize the Two Measure\nTheories by introducing a vector field whose equation of motion guarantees the\nconservation of a certain Energy Momentum tensor, which may be related, but in\ngeneral is not the same as the gravitational Energy Momentum tensor. We propose\ntwo formulations of this idea: I - by demanding that this vector field be the\ngradient of a scalar, II - by considering the dynamical space field appearing\nin another part of the action. Then the Dynamical space time Theory becomes a\ntheory of Diffusive Unified Dark Energy and Dark Matter. These generalizations\nproduce non conserved energy momentum tensors instead of conserved energy\nmomentum tensors which leads at the end to a formulation of interacting DE-DM\ndust models in the form of a diffusive type interacting Unified Dark Energy and\nDark Matter scenario. We solved analytically the theories for perturbative\nsolution and asymptotic solution, and we show that the $\\Lambda$CDM is a fixed\npoint of these theories at large times. Also a preliminary argument about the\ngood behavior of the theory at the quantum level is proposed for both theories.\n", "  Heat treatment is critically important to the performance of Nb3Sn\nsuperconducting strands. For very large Nb3Sn magnet coils, such as the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Central Solenoid (CS)\ncoils, heat treatment carries risk of temperature and time excursion, which may\nresult in performance degradation. Therefore, it is prudent to study the effect\nof possible excursion on Nb3Sn performance. In this study, Nb3Sn strands used\nfor ITER CS coils are heat treated at different temperatures for different\ntimes. Their critical current, residual resistance ratio and hysteresis losses\nare measured. It is found that in the range we studied, critical current and\nhysteresis losses do not change significantly. Residual resistance ratio,\nhowever, decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature and time. This is\nattributed to the diffusion of metallic elements from the plated Cr layer to\nthe copper stabilizer. Based on a model of metallic elements diffusion, a\nnumerical code is developed to predict residual resistance ratio as a function\nof heat treatment temperature and time.\n", "  We formulate topological crystalline materials on the basis of the twisted\nequivariant $K$-theory. Basic ideas of the twisted equivariant $K$-theory is\nexplained with application to topological phases protected by crystalline\nsymmetries in mind, and systematic methods of topological classification for\ncrystalline materials are presented. Our formulation is applicable to bulk\ngapful topological crystalline insulators/superconductors and their gapless\nboundary and defect states, as well as bulk gapless topological materials such\nas Weyl and Dirac semimetals, and nodal superconductors. As an application of\nour formulation, we present a complete classification of topological\ncrystalline surface states, in the absence of time-reversal invariance. The\nclassification works for gapless surface states of three-dimensional\ninsulators, as well as full gapped two-dimensional insulators. Such surface\nstates and two-dimensional insulators are classified in a unified way by 17\nwallpaper groups, together with the presence or the absence of (sublattice)\nchiral symmetry. We identify the topological numbers and their representations\nunder the wallpaper group operation. We also exemplify the usefulness of our\nformulation in the classification of bulk gapless phases. We present a new\nclass of Weyl semimetals and Weyl superconductors that are topologically\nprotected by inversion symmetry.\n", "  We discuss the design and implementation of a system for generating charged\nmultilayer graphene nanoplatelets and introducing a nanoplatelet into a\nquadrupole ion trap in high vacuum. Levitation decouples the platelet from its\nenvironment and enables sensitive mechanical and magnetic measurements. The\nplatelets are generated via liquid exfoliation of graphite pellets and charged\nvia electrospray ionization. A single platelet is trapped at a pressure of\nseveral hundred millitorr and transferred to a trap in a second chamber, which\nis pumped to UHV pressures for further study.\n", "  We investigate the effect of disorder on the propagation of surface plasmon\npolaritons in arrays of evanescently coupled dielectric loaded surface plasmon\npolariton waveguides. Diagonal disorder is implemented by randomly varying the\nheights of the waveguides. Real-space as well as Fourier-space images of the\nsurface plasmon polariton intensity distribution in the waveguide arrays are\nrecorded by leakage radiation microscopy. With these techniques we\nexperimentally demonstrate the transverse localization of surface plasmon\npolaritons with increasing disorder.\n", "  We demonstrate that the critical magnetic Reynolds number $Rm_c$ for a\nturbulent non-helical dynamo in the low magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$ limit\n(i.e. $Pm = Rm/Re \\ll 1$) can be significantly reduced if the flow is submitted\nto global rotation. Even for moderate rotation rates the required energy\ninjection rate can be reduced by a factor more than $10^3$. This strong\ndecrease of the onset is attributed to the reduction of the turbulent\nfluctuations that makes the flow to have a much larger cut-off length-scale\ncompared to a non-rotating flow of the same Reynolds number. The dynamo thus\nbehaves as if it is driven by laminar behaviour (i.e. high $Pm$ behaviour) even\nat high values of the Reynolds number (i.e. at low values of $Pm$). Our finding\nthus points into a new paradigm for the design of new liquid metal dynamo\nexperiments.\n", "  We show that there is generically non-uniqueness for the anisotropic\nCalder\\'on problem at fixed frequency when the Dirichlet and Neumann data are\nmeasured on disjoint sets of the boundary of a given domain. More precisely, we\nfirst show that given a smooth compact connected Riemannian manifold with\nboundary $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\\geq 3$, there exist in the conformal class of\n$g$ an infinite number of Riemannian metrics $\\tilde{g}$ such that their\ncorresponding DN maps at a fixed frequency coincide when the Dirichlet data\n$\\Gamma_D$ and Neumann data $\\Gamma_N$ are measured on disjoint sets and\nsatisfy $\\overline{\\Gamma_D \\cup \\Gamma_N} \\ne \\partial M$. The conformal\nfactors that lead to these non-uniqueness results for the anisotropic\nCalder\\'on problem satisfy a nonlinear elliptic PDE of Yamabe type on the\noriginal manifold $(M,g)$ and are associated to a natural but subtle gauge\ninvariance of the anisotropic Calder\\'on problem with data on disjoint sets. We\nthen construct a large class of counterexamples to uniqueness in dimension\n$n\\geq 3$ to the anisotropic Calder\\'on problem at fixed frequency with data on\ndisjoint sets and \\emph{modulo this gauge invariance}. This class consists in\ncylindrical Riemannian manifolds with boundary having two ends (meaning that\nthe boundary has two connected components), equipped with a suitably chosen\nwarped product metric.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies provide us with unique insights into\nthe drivers of AGN activity under extreme conditions. Given their low black\nhole (BH) masses and near-Eddington accretion rates, they represent a class of\ngalaxies with rapidly growing supermassive BHs in the local universe. Here, we\npresent the results from our multi-frequency radio monitoring of a sample of\n{\\gamma}-ray loud NLS1 galaxies ({\\gamma}NLS1s), including systems discovered\nonly recently, and featuring both the nearest and the most distant\n{\\gamma}NLS1s known to date. We also present high-resolution radio imaging of\n1H 0323+342, which is remarkable for its spiral or ring-like host. Finally, we\npresent new radio data of the candidate {\\gamma}-emitting NLS1 galaxy RX\nJ2314.9+2243, characterized by a very steep radio spectrum, unlike other\n{\\gamma}NLS1s.\n", "  Using dispersion theory the low-energy electromagnetic form factors for the\ntransition of a Sigma to a Lambda hyperon are related to the pion vector form\nfactor. The additionally required input, i.e. the two-pion--Sigma--Lambda\namplitudes are determined from relativistic next-to-leading-order (NLO) baryon\nchiral perturbation theory including the baryons from the octet and optionally\nfrom the decuplet. Pion rescattering is again taken into account by dispersion\ntheory. It turns out that the inclusion of decuplet baryons is not an option\nbut a necessity to obtain reasonable results. The electric transition form\nfactor remains very small in the whole low-energy region. The magnetic\ntransition form factor depends strongly on one not very well determined\nlow-energy constant of the NLO Lagrangian. One obtains reasonable predictive\npower if this low-energy constant is determined from a measurement of the\nmagnetic transition radius. Such a measurement can be performed at the future\nFacility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).\n", "  We investigate the influence of particle diffusion in the two-dimension\ncontact process (CP) with a competitive dynamics in bipartite sublattices,\nproposed in [Phys. Rev. E 84, 011125 (2011)]. The particle creation depends on\nits first and second neighbors and the extinction increases according to the\nlocal density. In contrast to the standard CP model, mean-field theory and\nnumerical simulations predict three stable phases: inactive (absorbing), active\nsymmetric and active asymmetric, signed by distinct sublattice particle\noccupations. Our results from MFT and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that low\ndiffusion rates do not destroy sublattice ordering, ensuring the maintenance of\nthe asymmetric phase. On the other hand, for diffusion larger than a threshold\nvalue Dc, the sublattice ordering is suppressed and only the usual active\n(symmetric)-inactive transition is presented. We also show the critical\nbehavior and universality classes are not affected by the diffusion.\n", "  Electron dynamics in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source is numerically\nsimulated by using Particle-In-Cell code combined with simulations of the ion\ndynamics. Mean electron energies are found to be around 70 keV close to values\nthat are derived from spectra of X-ray emission out of the source. Electron\nlife time is defined by losses of low-energy electrons created in ionizing\ncollisions; the losses are regulated by electron heating rate, which depends on\nmagnitude of the microwave electric field. Changes in ion confinement with\nvariations in the microwave electric field and gas flow are simulated.\nInfluence of electron dynamics on the afterglow and two-frequency heating\neffects is discussed.\n", "  We revisit the present status of the stiffness of the supranuclear equations\nof state, particularly the solutions that increase the stiffness in the\npresence of hyperons, the putative transition to a quark matter phase and the\nrobustness of massive compact star observations.\n", "  It is understood that strong magnetic fields affect the structure of neutron\nstars. Nevertheless, many calculations for magnetized neutron stars are still\nbeing performed using symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations. In this\nconference proceeding, we review why this is not the correct procedure and we\nalso discuss the effects of magnetic fields on the stellar population and\ntemperature profiles.\n", "  About one third of the 3033 $\\gamma$-ray sources in the Third Fermi-LAT\nGamma-ray Source Catalogue (3FGL) are unidentified and do not have even a\ntentative association with a known object, hence they are defined as\nunassociated. Among Galactic $\\gamma$-ray sources, pulsars represent the\nlargest class, with over 200 identifications to date. About one third of them\nare milli-second pulsars (MSPs) in binary systems. Therefore, it is plausible\nthat a sizeable fraction of the unassociated Galactic $\\gamma$-ray sources\nbelong to this class. We collected X-ray and optical observations of the fields\nof twelve unassociated Fermi sources that have been classified as likely MSPs\naccording to statistical classification techniques. To find observational\nsupport for the proposed classification, we looked for periodic modulations of\nthe X-ray and optical flux of these sources, which could be associated with the\norbital period of a MSP in a tight binary system. Four of the observed sources\nwere identified as binary MSPs, or proposed as high-confidence candidates,\nwhile this work was in progress. For these sources, we present the results of\nour follow-up investigations, whereas for the others we present possible\nevidence of new MSP identifications. In particular, we discuss the case of 3FGL\nJ0744.1-2523 that we proposed as a possible binary MSP based upon the\npreliminary detection of a 0.115 d periodicity in the flux of its candidate\noptical counterpart. We also found very marginal evidence of periodicity in the\ncandidate optical counterpart to 3FGL J0802.3-5610, at a period of 0.4159 d,\nwhich needs to be confirmed by further observations.\n", "  The photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) can be regarded as a direct optical\nanalogy of the SHE in electronic systems where a refractive index gradient\nplays the role of electric potential. However, it has been demonstrated that\nthe effective refractive index fails to adequately explain the lightmatter\ninteraction in atomically thin crystals. In this paper, we examine the\nspin-orbit interaction on the surface of the freestanding atomically thin\ncrystals. We find that it is not necessary to involve the effective refractive\nindex to describe the spin-orbit interaction and the photonic SHE in the\natomically thin crystals. The strong spin-orbit interaction and giant photonic\nSHE have been predicted, which can be explained as the large polarization\nrotation of plane-wave components in order to satisfy the transversality of\nphoton.\n", "  We perform calculations of white dwarfs endowed with strong magnetic fields.\nWhite dwarfs are the progenitors of supernova Type Ia explosions and they are\nwidely used as candles to show that the Universe is expanding and accelerating.\nHowever, observations of ultraluminous supernovae have suggested that the\nprogenitor of such an explosion should be a white dwarf with mass above the\nwell-known Chandrasekhar limit $\\sim \\,$1.4 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. In corroboration\nwith other works, but by using a fully general relativistic framework, we\nobtained also strongly magnetized white dwarfs with masses $\\rm{M \\sim 2.0\\,\\,\nM_{\\odot}}$.\n", "  Extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) events are vulnerable to perturbations by\nthe stellar background, which can abort them prematurely by deflecting EMRI\norbits to plunging ones that fall directly into the massive black hole (MBH),\nor to less eccentric ones that no longer interact strongly with the MBH. A\ncoincidental hierarchy between the collective resonant Newtonian torques due to\nthe stellar background, and the relative magnitudes of the leading-order\npost-Newtonian precessional and radiative terms of the general relativistic\n2-body problem, allows EMRIs to decouple from the background and produce\nsemi-periodic gravitational wave signals. I review the recent theoretical\ndevelopments that confirm this conjectured fortunate coincidence, and briefly\ndiscuss the implications for EMRI rates, and show how these dynamical effects\ncan be probed locally by stars near the Galactic MBH.\n", "  The adsorption of hydrogen at nonpolar GaN(1-100) surfaces and its impact on\nthe electronic and vibrational properties is investigated using surface\nelectron spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. For the surface mediated dissociation of H2 and the subsequent\nadsorption of H, an energy barrier of 0.55 eV has to be overcome. The\ncalculated kinetic surface phase diagram indicates that the reaction is\nkinetically hindered at low pressures and low temperatures. At higher\ntemperatures ab-initio thermodynamics show, that the H-free surface is\nenergetically favored. To validate these theoretical predictions experiments at\nroom temperature and under ultrahigh vacuum conditions were performed. They\nreveal that molecular hydrogen does not dissociatively adsorb at the GaN(1-100)\nsurface. Only activated atomic hydrogen atoms attach to the surface. At\ntemperatures above 820 K, the attached hydrogen gets desorbed. The adsorbed\nhydrogen atoms saturate the dangling bonds of the gallium and nitrogen surface\natoms and result in an inversion of the Ga-N surface dimer buckling. The\nsignatures of the Ga-H and N-H vibrational modes on the H-covered surface have\nexperimentally been identified and are in good agreement with the DFT\ncalculations of the surface phonon modes. Both theory and experiment show that\nH adsorption results in a removal of occupied and unoccupied intragap electron\nstates of the clean GaN(1-100) surface and a reduction of the surface upward\nband bending by 0.4 eV. The latter mechanism largely reduces surface electron\ndepletion.\n", "  We incorporate the non-linear clustering of dark matter halos, as modelled by\nJose et al. (2016) into the halo model to better understand the clustering of\nLyman break galaxies (LBGs) in the redshift range $z=3-5$. We find that, with\nthis change, the predicted LBG clustering increases significantly on\nquasi-linear scales ($0.1 \\leq r\\,/\\,h^{-1} \\,{\\rm Mpc} \\leq 10$) compared to\nthat in the linear halo bias model. This in turn results in an increase in the\nclustering of LBGs by an order of magnitude on angular scales $5\" \\leq \\theta\n\\leq 100\"$. Remarkably, the predictions of our new model on the whole remove\nthe systematic discrepancy between the linear halo bias predictions and the\nobservations. The correlation length and large scale galaxy bias of LBGs are\nfound to be significantly higher in the non-linear halo bias model than in the\nlinear halo bias model. The resulting two-point correlation function retains an\napproximate power-law form in contrast with that computed using the linear halo\nbias theory. We also find that the non-linear clustering of LBGs increases with\nincreasing luminosity and redshift. Our work emphasizes the importance of using\nnon-linear halo bias in order to model the clustering of high-z galaxies to\nprobe the physics of galaxy formation and extract cosmological parameters\nreliably.\n", "  Laser-based sources of ionizing radiation have attracted a considerable\nattention in the last years for their broad potential applications. However the\nstability and robustness of such sources is still an issue that needs to be\naddressed. Aiming to solve such problems, we propose a source that uses a\nliquid jet -rather than a solid- as a target for the production of X-rays.\nLiquid jets offer always a clean surface for every laser shot which represent a\nclear advantage over solids. In this work, we present an experimental\ncharacterization of the X-ray emission of such targets, and study the\nefficiency of the process when two temporally delayed pulses are used.\nAccording to the obtained results, the X-ray yield is comparable with commonly\nused targets.\n", "  Trapped atomic ions are a leading platform for quantum information networks,\nwith long-lived identical qubit memories that can be locally entangled through\ntheir Coulomb interaction and remotely entangled through photonic channels.\nHowever, performing both local and remote operations in a single node of a\nquantum network requires extreme isolation between spectator qubit memories and\nqubits associated with the photonic interface. We achieve this isolation and\ndemonstrate the ingredients of a scalable ion trap network node by co-trapping\n$^{171}$Yb$^+\\ $ and $^{138}$Ba$^+\\ $ qubits, entangling the mixed species\nqubit pair through their collective motion, and entangling the $^{138}$Ba$^+\\ $\nqubits with emitted visible photons.\n", "  We use Lattice-Boltzmann and analytical calculations to investigate transient\nhydrodynamic finite size effects induced by the use of periodic boundary\nconditions in simulations at the molecular, mesoscopic or continuum levels of\ndescription. We analyze the transient response to a local perturbation in the\nfluid and obtain via linear response theory the local velocity correlation\nfunction. This new approach is validated by comparing the finite size effects\non the steady-state velocity with the known results for the diffusion\ncoefficient. We next investigate the full time-dependence of the local velocity\nauto-correlation function. We find at long times a cross-over between the\nexpected $t^{-3/2}$ hydrodynamic tail and an oscillatory exponential decay, and\nstudy the scaling with the system size of the cross-over time, exponential rate\nand amplitude, and oscillation frequency. We interpret these results from the\nanalytic solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the slowest\nmodes, which are set by the system size. The present work not only provides a\ncomprehensive analysis of hydrodynamic finite size effects in bulk fluids, but\nalso establishes the Lattice-Boltzmann method as a suitable tool to investigate\nsuch effects in general.\n", "  Emergence of antibiotic resistance due to New Delhi Metallo $\\beta$-lactamase\n(NDM-1) bacterial enzymes is of great concern due to their ability to hydrolyze\nwide range of antibiotics. Efforts are ongoing to obtain the atomistic details\nof the hydrolysis mechanism in order to develop novel drugs and inhibitors\nagainst NDM-1. Especially, it remains elusive how drug molecules of different\nfamily of antibiotics are hydrolyzed by NDM-1 in an efficient manner. Here we\nreport the detailed molecular mechanism of NDM-1 catalyzed hydrolysis of\ncephalexin, a cephalosporin family drug, and meropenem, a carbapenem family\ndrug. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using hybrid\nquantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods at the density\nfunctional theory level, based on which reaction pathways and the associated\nfree energies are obtained. We find that the mechanism and the free energy\nbarrier for the ring-opening step are the same for both the drug molecules,\nwhile the subsequent protonation step differs. In particular, we observe that\nthe mechanism of the protonation step depends on the R2 group of the drug\nmolecule. Our simulations show that allylic carbon protonation occurs in the\ncase of cephalexin drug molecule where Lys211 is the proton donor and the\nproton transfer occurs via a water chain formed (only) at the ring-opened\nintermediate structure. Based on the free energy profiles, the overall kinetics\nof the drug hydrolysis is discussed. Finally, we show that the proposed\nmechanisms and free energy profiles could explain various experimental\nobservations.\n", "  We theoretically study the effect of the Berry curvature on the transport\nproperties of Weyl semimetals in the nonadiabatic process, which results in\nnonlinear optical responses. In the adiabatic process, the Berry curvature,\nwhich involves the time derivative of the Bloch states, contributes to the\ntransport properties such as the adiabatic Thouless pump. Although this effect\nis very weak in usual solids, it is enhanced in Weyl semimetals, where the\nBerry curvature contributes to observable nonlinear optical responses due to\nits nodal structure. In this paper, using semiclassical Boltzmann theory, we\nshow that the d.c. photocurrent induced by the Berry curvature robustly\npersists even in the limit of short scattering time. We also show that the\nphotocurrent is well explained as a consequence of the electromagnetic\ninduction in momentum space. The results indicate that the electromagnetic\ninduction gives rise to a non-dissipative photocurrent that is robust even when\ndecoherence occurs within a time scale shorter than the periodicity of the\nlight. We also discuss the second harmonic response of the a.c. current when\nthe electron distribution is displaced from the ground state by an external\nfield.\n", "  In this paper, we present a purely algebraic formulation of higher gauge\ntheory and gauged sigma models based on the abstract theory of graded\ncommutative algebras and their morphisms. The formulation incorporates\nnaturally BRST symmetry and is also suitable for AKSZ type constructions. It is\nalso shown that for a full--fledged BV formulation including ghost degrees of\nfreedom, higher gauge and gauged sigma model fields must be viewed as internal\nsmooth functions on the shifted tangent bundle of a space time manifold valued\nin a shifted L_infty-algebroid encoding symmetry. The relationship to other\nformulations where the L_infty-algebroid arises from a higher Lie groupoid by\nLie differentiation is highlighted.\n", "  We present the nature of 50 hard X-ray emitting objects unveiled through an\noptical spectroscopy campaign performed at seven telescopes in the northern and\nsouthern hemispheres. These objects were detected with Swift-BAT and listed as\nof unidentified nature in the 54-month Palermo BAT catalogue. In detail, 45\nsources in our sample are identified as active galactic nuclei of which, 27 are\nclassified as type 1 (with broad and narrow emission lines) and 18 are\nclassified as type 2 (with only narrow emission lines). Among the broad-line\nemission objects, one is a type 1 high-redshift quasi-stellar object, and among\nthe narrow-line emission objects, one is a starburst galaxy, one is a X-ray\nbright optically normal galaxy, and one is a low ionization nuclear emission\nline region. We report 30 new redshift measurements, 13 confirmations and 2\nmore accurate redshift values. The remaining five objects are galactic sources:\nthree are Cataclismic Variables, one is a X-ray Binary probably with a low mass\nsecondary star, and one is an active star.\n", "  We propose a feasible and scalable quantum-dot-based implementation of a\nsinglet-only spin qubit which is to leading order intrinsically insensitive to\nrandom effective magnetic fields set up by fluctuating nuclear spins in the\nhost semiconductor. Our proposal thus removes an important obstacle for further\nimprovement of spin qubits hosted in high-quality III-V semiconductors such as\nGaAs. We show how the resulting qubit could be initialized, manipulated, and\nread out by electrical means only, in a way very similar to a triple-dot\nexchange-only spin qubit. Due to the intrinsic elimination of the effective\nnuclear fields from the qubit Hamiltonian, we find an improvement of the\ndephasing time $T_2^*$ of several orders of magnitude as compared to similar\nexisting spin qubits.\n", "  The forecasting of meteor showers is currently very good at predicting the\ntiming of meteor outbursts, but still needs further work regarding the level of\na given shower. Moreover, uncertainties are rarely provided, leaving the end\nuser (scientist, space agency or the public) with no way to evaluate how much\nthe prediction is trustworthy. A confidence index for the forecasting of meteor\nshowers is presented. It allows one to better understand how a specific\nforecasting has been performed. In particular, it underlines the role of our\ncurrent knowledge of the parent body, its past orbit and past activity. The\nrole of close encounters with planets for the time period considered is\nquantified as well. This confidence index is a first step towards better\nconstrained forecasting of future meteor showers.\n", "  During the EBEX2013 long duration flight the payload was free to rotate in\nazimuth. The observed azimuth motion consisted of a superposition of full\nrotations with a period of 10-30 minutes and oscillatory motion with an\namplitude of tens of degrees, average period of 79 s, and period dispersion of\n12 s. We interpret the full rotations as induced by slow rotations of the\nballoon and the shorter period oscillatory motion as due to torsional\noscillations of the flight line. We derive the torsional stiffness of the\nflight line using the bifilar pendulum model and apply it to the flight line of\nthe EBEX2013 payload. We find a torsional spring constant of 36 kg m$^2$/s$^2$\ncorresponding to a period of 58 s. We conclude that the bifilar model, which\naccounts for the geometry of the flight line but neglects all material\nproperties, predicts a stiffness and period that are 45% larger and 25% shorter\nthan those observed. It is useful to have a simple, easy to use, coarse\napproximation for the torsional constant of the flight line.\n", "  Triggered star formation around HII regions could be an important process.\nThe Galactic HII region RCW 79 is a prototypical object for triggered high-mass\nstar formation. We take advantage of Herschel data from the surveys HOBYS,\n\"Evolution of Interstellar Dust\", and Hi-Gal to extract compact sources in this\nregion, complemented with archival 2MASS, Spitzer, and WISE data to determine\nthe physical parameters of the sources (e.g., envelope mass, dust temperature,\nand luminosity) by fitting the spectral energy distribution. We obtained a\nsample of 50 compact sources, 96% of which are situated in the\nionization-compressed layer of cold and dense gas that is characterized by the\ncolumn density PDF with a double-peaked lognormal distribution. The 50 sources\nhave sizes of 0.1-0.4 pc with a typical value of 0.2 pc, temperatures of 11-26\nK, envelope masses of 6-760 $M_\\odot$, densities of 0.1-44 $\\times$ $10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$, and luminosities of 19-12712 $L_\\odot$. The sources are classified\ninto 16 class 0, 19 intermediate, and 15 class I objects. Their distribution\nfollows the evolutionary tracks in the diagram of bolometric luminosity versus\nenvelope mass (Lbol-Menv) well. A mass threshold of 140 $M_\\odot$, determined\nfrom the Lbol-Menv diagram, yields 12 candidate massive dense cores that may\nform high-mass stars. The core formation efficiency (CFE) for the 8 massive\ncondensations shows an increasing trend of the CFE with density. This suggests\nthat the denser the condensation, the higher the fraction of its mass\ntransformation into dense cores, as previously observed in other high-mass\nstar-forming regions.\n", "  GALEX detected a significant fraction of early-type galaxies showing Far-UV\nbright structures. These features suggest the occurrence of recent star\nformation episodes. We aim at understanding their evolutionary path[s] and the\nmechanisms at the origin of their UV-bright structures. We investigate with a\nmulti-lambda approach 11 early-types selected because of their nearly passive\nstage of evolution in the nuclear region. The paper, second of a series,\nfocuses on the comparison between UV features detected by Swift-UVOT, tracing\nrecent star formation, and the galaxy optical structure mapping older stellar\npopulations. We performed their UV surface photometry and used BVRI photometry\nfrom other sources. Our integrated magnitudes have been analyzed and compared\nwith corresponding values in the literature. We characterize the overall galaxy\nstructure best fitting the UV and optical luminosity profiles using a single\nSersic law. NGC 1366, NGC 1426, NGC 3818, NGC 3962 and NGC 7192 show\nfeatureless luminosity profiles. Excluding NGC 1366 which has a clear edge-on\ndisk , n~1-2, and NGC 3818, the remaining three have Sersic's indices n~3-4 in\noptical and a lower index in the UV. Bright ring/arm-like structures are\nrevealed by UV images and luminosity profiles of NGC 1415, NGC 1533, NGC 1543,\nNGC 2685, NGC 2974 and IC 2006. The ring/arm-like structures are different from\ngalaxy to galaxy. Sersic indices of UV profiles for those galaxies are in the\nrange n=1.5-3 both in S0s and in Es. In our sample optical Sersic indices are\nusually larger than the UV ones. (M2-V) color profiles are bluer in\nring/arm-like structures with respect to the galaxy body. The lower values of\nSersic's indices in the UV bands with respect to optical ones, suggesting the\npresence of a disk, point out that the role of the dissipation cannot be\nneglected in recent evolutionary phases of these early-type galaxies.\n", "  Mean motion resonances [MMRs] play an important role in the formation and\nevolution of planetary systems and have significantly influenced the orbital\nproperties and distribution of planets and minor planets in the solar system as\nwell as exo-planetary systems. Most previous theoretical analyses have focused\non the low-to-moderate eccentricity regime, but with new discoveries of high\neccentricity resonant minor planets and even exoplanets, there is increasing\nmotivation to examine MMRs in the high eccentricity regime. Here we report on a\nstudy of the high eccentricity regime of MMRs in the circular planar restricted\nthree-body problem. Non-perturbative numerical analyses of the 2:1 and the 3:2\ninterior resonances are carried out for a wide range of secondary-to-primary\nmass ratio, and for a wide range of eccentricity of the test particle. The\nsurface-of-section technique is used to study the phase space structure near\nresonances. We identify transitions in phase space at certain critical\neccentricities related to the geometry of resonant orbits; new stable libration\nzones appear at high eccentricity at libration centers shifted from those at\nlow eccentricities. We present novel results on the mass and eccentricity\ndependence of the resonance libration centers and their widths in semi-major\naxis. Our results show that MMRs have sizable libration zones at high\neccentricities, comparable to those at lower eccentricities.\n", "  In this study, we probe the transition to cosmic homogeneity in the Large\nScale Structure (LSS) of the Universe using the CMASS galaxy sample of BOSS\nspectroscopic survey which covers the largest effective volume to date, $3\\\nh^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ at $0.43 \\leq z \\leq 0.7$. We study the scaled\ncounts-in-spheres, $\\mathcal{N}(<r)$, and the fractal correlation dimension,\n$\\mathcal{D}_2(r)$, to assess the homogeneity scale of the universe using a\n$Landy\\ \\&\\ Szalay$ inspired estimator.\n  Defining the scale of transition to homogeneity as the scale at which\n$\\mathcal{D}_2(r)$ reaches 3 within $1\\%$, i.e. $\\mathcal{D}_2(r)>2.97$ for\n$r>\\mathcal{R}_H$, we find $\\mathcal{R}_H = (63.3\\pm0.7) \\ h^{-1}\\\n\\mathrm{Mpc}$, in agreement at the percentage level with the predictions of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model $\\mathcal{R}_H=62.0\\ h^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}$. Thanks to the\nlarge cosmic depth of the survey, we investigate the redshift evolution of the\ntransition to homogeneity scale and find agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction. Finally, we find that $\\mathcal{D}_2$ is compatible with $3$ at\nscales larger than $300\\ h^{-1}\\ $Mpc in all redshift bins.\n  These results consolidate the Cosmological Principle and represent a precise\nconsistency test of the $\\Lambda CDM$ model.\n", "  We investigate the helically-propagating edge states associated with\npseudo-Landau levels in strained honeycomb lattices. We exploit chiral symmetry\nto derive a general criterion for the existence of these propagating edge\nstates in the presence of only nearest-neighbour hoppings and we verify our\ncriterion using numerical simulations of both uni-axially and trigonally\nstrained honeycomb lattices. We show that the propagation of the helical edge\nstate can be controlled by engineering the shape of the edges. Sensitivity to\nchiral-symmetry-breaking next-nearest-neighbour hoppings is assessed. Our\nresult opens up an avenue toward the precise control of edge modes through\nmanipulation of the edge shape.\n", "  The rotational and hyperfine spectrum of the $X^1\\Sigma^+ \\rightarrow\nB^3\\Pi_1$ transition in TlF molecules was measured using laser-induced\nfluorescence from both a thermal and a cryogenic molecular beam. Rotational and\nhyperfine constants for the $B$ state are obtained. The large magnetic\nhyperfine interaction of the Tl nuclear spin leads to significant mixing of the\nlowest $B$ state rotational levels. Updated, more precise measurements of the\n$B\\rightarrow X$ vibrational branching fractions are also presented. The\ncombined rovibrational branching fractions allow for the prediction of the\nnumber of photons that can be scattered in a given TlF optical cycling scheme.\n", "  An \\emph{ab initio} Langevin dynamics approach is developed based on\nstochastic density functional theory (sDFT) within a new \\emph{embedded\nsaturated } \\emph{fragment }formalism, applicable to covalently bonded systems.\nThe forces on the nuclei generated by sDFT contain a random component natural\nto Langevin dynamics and its standard deviation is used to estimate the\nfriction term on each atom by satisfying the fluctuation\\textendash dissipation\nrelation. The overall approach scales linearly with system size even if the\ndensity matrix is not local and is thus applicable to ordered as well as\ndisordered extended systems. We implement the approach for a series of silicon\nnanocrystals (NCs) of varying size with a diameter of up to $3$nm corresponding\nto $N_{e}=3000$ electrons and generate a set of configurations that are\ndistributed canonically at a fixed temperature, ranging from cryogenic to room\ntemperature. We also analyze the structure properties of the NCs and discuss\nthe reconstruction of the surface geometry.\n", "  A new approach of solving the ill-conditioned inverse problem for analytical\ncontinuation is proposed. The root of the problem lies in the fact that even\ntiny noise of imaginary-time input data has a serious impact on the inferred\nreal-frequency spectra. By means of a modern regularization technique, we\neliminate redundant degrees of freedom that essentially carry the noise,\nleaving only relevant information unaffected by the noise. The resultant\nspectrum is represented with minimal bases and thus a stable analytical\ncontinuation is achieved. This framework further provides a tool for analyzing\nto what extent the Monte Carlo data need to be accurate to resolve details of\nan expected spectral function.\n", "  Using the framework that interpolates between the leading power limit of the\nColor Glass Condensate and the High Energy (or $k_{T}$) factorization we\ncalculate the direct component of the forward dijet production in\nultra-peripheral $\\mathrm{Pb}$-$\\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at CM energy\n$5.1\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ per nucleon pair. The formalism is applicable when the\naverage transverse momentum of the dijet system $P_{T}$ is much bigger than the\nsaturation scale $Q_{s}$, $P_{T}\\gg Q_{s}$, while the imbalance of the dijet\nsystem can be arbitrary. The cross section is uniquely sensitive to the\nWeizs\\\"acker-Williams (WW) unintegrated gluon distribution, which is far less\nknown from experimental data than the most common dipole gluon distribution\nappearing in inclusive small-$x$ processes. We have calculated cross sections\nand nuclear modification ratios using WW gluon distribution obtained from the\ndipole gluon density through the Gaussian approximation. The dipole gluon\ndistribution used to get WW was fitted to the inclusive HERA data with the\nnonlinear extension of unified BFKL+DGLAP evolution equation. The saturation\neffects are visible but rather weak for realistic $p_{T}$ cut on the dijet\nsystem, reaching about $20\\%$ with the cut as low as $6\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. We find\nthat the LO collinear factorization with nuclear leading twist shadowing\npredicts quite similar effects.\n", "  Based on the Fermi observational data we reveal meaningful constraints for\nthe dependence of the macroscopic conductivity $(\\sigma)$ of dissipative pulsar\nmagnetosphere models on the corresponding spin-down rate, $\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$.\nOur models are refinements of the FIDO (Force-Free Inside, Dissipative Outside)\nmodels whose dissipative regions are restricted on the equatorial current-sheet\noutside the light-cylinder. Taking into account the observed cutoff-energies of\nall the Fermi-pulsars and assuming that a) the corresponding $\\gamma-$ray\npulsed emission is due to curvature radiation at the radiation-reaction-limit\nregime and b) this emission is produced at the equatorial current-sheet near\nthe light-cylinder, we show that the \\emph{Fermi}-data provide clear\nindications about the corresponding accelerating electric-field components. A\ndirect comparison between the \\emph{Fermi} cutoff-energies and the model ones\nreveals that $\\sigma$ increases with $\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$ for high\n$\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$-values while it saturates for low ones. This comparison\nindicates also that the corresponding gap-width increases toward low\n$\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$-values. Assuming the Goldreich-Julian flux for the emitting\nparticles we calculate the total $\\gamma-$ray luminosity $(L_{\\gamma})$. A\ncomparison between the dependence of the Fermi $L_{\\gamma}$-values and the\nmodel ones on $\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$ indicates an increase of the emitting\nparticle multiplicity with $\\dot{\\mathcal{E}}$. Our modeling guided by the\n\\emph{Fermi}-data alone, enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms\nbehind the high energy emission in pulsar magnetospheres.\n", "  The present paper introduces a new multi-reference perturbation approach\ndeveloped at second order, based on a Jeziorsky-Mokhorst expansion using\nindividual Slater determinants as perturbers. Thanks to this choice of\nperturbers, an effective Hamiltonian may be built, allowing for the dressing of\nthe Hamiltonian matrix within the reference space, assumed here to be a CAS-CI.\nSuch a formulation accounts then for the coupling between the static and\ndynamic correlation effects. With our new definition of zeroth-order energies,\nthese two approaches are strictly size-extensive provided that local orbitals\nare used, as numerically illustrated here and formally demonstrated in the\nappendix. Also, the present formalism allows for the factorization of all\ndouble excitation operators, just as in internally contracted approaches,\nstrongly reducing the computational cost of these two approaches with respect\nto other determinant-based perturbation theories. The accuracy of these methods\nhas been investigated on ground-state potential curves up to full dissociation\nlimits for a set of six molecules involving single, double and triple bond\nbreaking. The spectroscopic constants obtained with the present methods are\nfound to be in very good agreement with the full configuration interaction\n(FCI) results. As the present formalism does not use any parameter or\nnumerically unstable operation, the curves obtained with the two methods are\nsmooth all along the dissociation path.\n", "  Initial conditions for (Newtonian) cosmological N-body simulations are\nusually set by re-scaling the present-day power spectrum obtained from linear\n(relativistic) Boltzmann codes to the desired initial redshift of the\nsimulation. This back-scaling method can account for the effect of\ninhomogeneous residual thermal radiation at early times, which is absent in the\nNewtonian simulations. We analyse this procedure from a fully relativistic\nperspective, employing the recently-proposed Newtonian motion gauge framework.\nWe find that N-body simulations for LambdaCDM cosmology starting from\nback-scaled initial conditions can be self-consistently embedded in a\nrelativistic space-time with first-order metric potentials calculated using a\nlinear Boltzmann code. This space-time coincides with a simple \"N-body gauge\"\nfor z<50 for all observable modes. Care must be taken, however, when simulating\nnon-standard cosmologies. As an example, we analyse the back-scaling method in\na cosmology with decaying dark matter, and show that metric perturbations\nbecome large at early times in the back-scaling approach, indicating a\nbreakdown of the perturbative description. We suggest a suitable \"forwards\napproach\" for such cases.\n", "  The layered compound KCu$_3$As$_2$O$_7$(OD)$_3$, comprising distorted kagome\nplanes of $S=1/2$ Cu$^{2+}$ ions, is a recent addition to the family of type-II\nmultiferroics. Previous zero field neutron diffraction work has found two\nhelically ordered regimes in \\kns, each showing a distinct coupling between the\nmagnetic and ferroelectric order parameters. Here, we extend this work to\nmagnetic fields up to $20$~T using neutron powder diffraction, capacitance,\npolarization, and high-field magnetization measurements, hence determining the\n$H-T$ phase diagram. We find metamagnetic transitions in both low temperatures\nphases around $\\mu_0 H_c \\sim 3.7$~T, which neutron powder diffraction reveals\nto correspond to a rotation of the helix plane away from the easy plane, as\nwell as a small change in the propagation vector. Furthermore, we show that the\nsign of the ferroelectric polarization is reversible in a magnetic field,\nalthough no change is observed (or expected on the basis of the magnetic\nstructure) due to the transition at $3.7$~T. We finally justify the temperature\ndependence of the polarization in both zero-field ordered phases by a symmetry\nanalysis of the free energy expansion.\n", "  In quantum many-body theory, all physical observables are described in terms\nof correlation functions between particle creation/annihilation operators.\nMeasurement of such correlation functions can therefore be regarded as an\noperational solution to the quantum many-body problem. Here we demonstrate this\nparadigm by measuring multi-particle momentum correlations up to third order\nbetween ultracold helium atoms in an s-wave scattering halo of colliding\nBose-Einstein condensates, using a quantum many-body momentum microscope. Our\nmeasurements allow us to extract a key building block of all higher-order\ncorrelations in this system|the pairing field amplitude. In addition, we\ndemonstrate a record violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for\ncorrelated atom pairs and triples. Measuring multi-particle momentum\ncorrelations could provide new insights into effects such as unconventional\nsuperconductivity and many-body localisation.\n", "  Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) is considered as one of the most\ncompetitive candidates for the accelerators of the next generation. With the\ndevelopment of high power laser technologies, LWFA has shown its potential of\nreplacing the conventional radio-frequency (RF) accelerators due to its\nflexibility and adjustability. In this paper, we will study the potential high\nflux electron beam productions of LWFA driven by petawatt-level laser pulses.\nIn our three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, an optimal set of\nparameters gives $\\sim 40\\ \\rm nC$ of charge with $2\\ \\rm PW$ laser power, thus\n$\\sim 400\\ \\rm kA$ of instantaneous current if we assume the electron beam\nduration is 100 fs. This high flux and its secondary radiation are widely\napplicable in nuclear and QED physics, industrial imaging, medical and\nbiological studies.\n", "  Photoproduction of $ K\\Sigma^{*}(1385)$ on the nucleon is investigated within\nthe Regge framework and the reaction mechanism is analyzed based on the data\nexisting in the channels $\\gamma p\\to K^+\\Sigma^{*0}$ and $\\gamma n\\to\nK^+\\Sigma^{*-}$. The Reggeization of the $t$-channel meson exchanges\n$K(494)+K^*(892)+K_2^*(1430)$ is employed to construct the photoproduction\namplitude. The Rarita-Schwinger formalism is applied for the spin-3/2$^+$\nstrangeness-baryon $\\Sigma^*$ with a special gauge prescription utilized for\nthe convergence of these reaction processes. Within a set of coupling constants\ndetermined from the symmetry arguement for the $K$ and $K^*$ and from the\nduality and vector dominance for the $K_2^*$, the data of the both processes\nare reproduced to a good degree. The production mechanism of these processes\nare featured by the dominance of the contact term plus the $K$ exchange with\nthe role of the $K_2^*$ following rather than the $K^*$.\n", "  We present the effective field theory studies of primordial statistical\nanisotropies in models of anisotropic inflation. The general action in unitary\ngauge is presented to calculate the leading interactions between the gauge\nfield fluctuations, the curvature perturbations and the tensor perturbations.\nThe anisotropies in scalar power spectrum and bispectrum are calculated and the\ndependence of these anisotropies to EFT couplings are presented. In addition,\nwe calculate the statistical anisotropy in tensor power spectrum and the\nscalar-tensor cross correlation. Our EFT approach incorporates anisotropies\ngenerated in models with non-trivial speed for the gauge field fluctuations and\nsound speed for scalar perturbations such as in DBI inflation.\n", "  Dynamical antiferromagnets pump spins efficiently into adjacent conductors as\nferromagnets. The high antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies represent a\nchallenge for experimental detection, but magnetic fields can reduce these\nresonance frequencies. We compute the inverse spin Hall voltages resulting from\ndynamical spin excitations as a function of a magnetic field along the easy\naxis and the polarization of the driving AC magnetic field perpendicular to the\neasy axis. We consider the insulating antiferromagnets MnF$_2$, FeF$_2$, and\nNiO. Near the spin-flop transition, there is a significant enhancement of the\nDC spin pumping and inverse spin Hall voltage for the uniaxial antiferromagnets\nMnF$_2$ and FeF$_2$. In the biaxial NiO, the voltages are much weaker, and\nthere is no spin-flop enhancement of the DC component.\n", "  The second-order extended stability Factorized Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (FRKC2)\nclass of explicit schemes for the integration of large systems of PDEs with\ndiffusive terms is presented. FRKC2 schemes are straightforward to implement\nthrough ordered sequences of forward Euler steps with complex stepsizes, and\neasily parallelised for large scale problems on distributed architectures.\n  Preserving 7 digits for accuracy at 16 digit precision, the schemes are\ntheoretically capable of maintaining internal stability at acceleration factors\nin excess of 6000 with respect to standard explicit Runge-Kutta methods. The\nstability domains have approximately the same extents as those of RKC schemes,\nand are a third longer than those of RKL2 schemes. Extension of FRKC methods to\nfourth-order, by both complex splitting and Butcher composition techniques, is\ndiscussed.\n  A publicly available implementation of the FRKC2 class of schemes may be\nobtained from maths.dit.ie/frkc\n", "  We explore the implications of the observed low spins aligned with the\norbital axis in Advanced~LIGO~O1 run on binary black hole (BBH)~merger\nscenarios in which the merging BBHs have evolved from field binaries. The\ncoalescence time determines the initial orbital separation of BBHs. This, in\nturn, determines whether the stars are synchronized before collapse and hence\ndetermines their projected spins. Short coalescence times imply synchronization\nand large spins. Among known stellar objects, Wolf-Rayet~(WR) stars seem the\nonly progenitors consistent with the low aligned spins observed in LIGO's~O1\nprovided that the orbital axis maintains its direction during the collapse. We\ncalculate the spin distribution of BBH mergers in the local Universe and its\nredshift evolution for WR progenitors. Assuming that the BBH formation rate\npeaks around a redshift of $\\sim 2\\,$--$\\,3$, we show that BBH mergers in the\nlocal Universe are dominated by low spin events. The high spin population\nstarts to dominate at a redshift of $\\sim0.5\\,$--$\\,1.5$. WR stars are also\nprogenitors of long Gamma-Ray~Bursts~(LGRBs) that take place at a comparable\nrate to BBH mergers. We discuss the possible connection between the two\nphenomena. Additionally, we show that hypothetical Population~III star\nprogenitors are also possible. Although WR and Population~III progenitors are\nconsistent with the current data, both models predict a non-vanishing fraction\nof high aligned spin BBH mergers. If those are not detected within the coming\nLIGO/Virgo runs, it will be unlikely that the observed BBHs formed via field\nbinaries.\n", "  Asymptotic Safety, based on a non-Gaussian fixed point of the gravitational\nrenormalization group flow, provides an elegant mechanism for completing the\ngravitational force at sub-Planckian scales. At high energies the fixed point\ncontrols the scaling of couplings such that unphysical divergences are absent\nwhile the emergence of classical low-energy physics is linked to a crossover\nbetween two renormalization group fixed points. These features make Asymptotic\nSafety an attractive framework for cosmological model building. The resulting\nscenarios may naturally give rise to a quantum gravity driven inflationary\nphase in the very early universe and an almost scale-free fluctuation spectrum.\nMoreover, effective descriptions arising from an renormalization group\nimprovement permit a direct comparison to cosmological observations as, e.g.\nPlanck data.\n", "  We obtain a new anisotropic solution for spherically symmetric spacetimes by\nanalysing of the Karmarkar embedding condition. For this purpose we construct a\nsuitable form of one of the gravitational potentials to obtain a closed form\nsolution. This form of the remaining gravitational potential allows us to solve\nthe embedding equation and integrate the field equations. The resulting new\nanisotropic solution is well behaved which can be utilized to construct\nrealistic static fluid spheres. Also we estimated masses and radii of fluid\nspheres for LMC X-4 and EXO 1785-248 by using observational data sets values.\nThe obtained masses and radii show that our anisotropic solution can represent\nfluid spheres to a very good degree of accuracy.\n", "  The transport coefficients of quark matter at non-zero chemical potential and\ntemperature are computed within the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We\napply the Kubo formalism to obtain the thermal ($\\kappa$) and electrical\n($\\sigma$) conductivities as well as an update of the shear viscosity ($\\eta$)\nby evaluating the corresponding equilibrium two-point correlation functions to\nleading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. The Dirac structure of the\nself-energies and spectral functions is taken into account as these are\nevaluated from the meson-exchange Fock diagrams for on-mass-shell quarks. We\nfind that the thermal and electrical conductivities are decreasing functions of\ntemperature and density above the Mott temperature $T_{\\rm M}$ of dissolution\nof mesons into quarks, the main contributions being generated by the temporal\nand vector components of the spectral functions. The coefficients show a\nuniversal dependence on the ratio $T/T_{\\rm M}$ for different densities, i.e.,\nthe results differ by a chemical-potential dependent constant. We also show\nthat the Wiedemann-Franz law for the ratio $\\sigma/\\kappa$ does not hold. The\nratio $\\eta/s $, where $s$ is the entropy density, is of order of unity (or\nlarger) close to the Mott temperature and, as the temperature increases,\napproaches the AdS/CFT bound $1/4\\pi$. It is also conjectured that the ratio\n$\\kappa T/c_V $, with $c_V$ being the specific heat, is bounded from below by\n$1/18$.\n", "  The maximally gyrotropic configurations of the hypermagnetic field at the\nelectroweak epoch can induce a stochastic background of relic gravitational\nwaves with comoving frequencies ranging from the $\\mu$Hz to the kHz. Using two\ncomplementary approaches we construct a physical template family for the\nemission of the gravitational radiation produced by the hypermagnetic knots.\nThe current constraints and the presumed sensitivities of the advanced\nwide-band interferometers (both terrestrial and space-borne) are combined to\ninfer that the lack of observations at intermediate frequencies may invalidate\nthe premise of baryogenesis models based (directly or indirectly) on the\npresence of gyrotropic configurations of the hypermagnetic field at the\nelectroweak epoch. Over the intermediate frequency range the spectral energy\ndensity of the gravitational waves emitted by the hypermagnetic knots at the\nelectroweak scale can exceed the inflationary signal even by nine orders of\nmagnitude without affecting the standard bounds applicable on the stochastic\nbackgrounds of gravitational radiation. The signal of hypermagnetic knots can\nbe disambiguated, at least in principle, since the the produced gravitational\nwaves are polarized.\n", "  We numerically construct asymptotically $AdS_4$ solutions to\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. These have a dipolar electrostatic potential\nturned on at the conformal boundary $S^2\\times \\mathbb{R}_t$. We find two\nclasses of geometries: $AdS$ soliton solutions that encode the full\nbackreaction of the electric field on the $AdS$ geometry without a horizon, and\nneutral black holes that are \"polarised\" by the dipolar potential. For a\ncertain range of the electric field $\\mathcal{E}$, we find two distinct\nbranches of the $AdS$ soliton that exist for the same value of $\\mathcal{E}$.\nFor the black hole, we find either two or four branches depending on the value\nof the electric field and horizon temperature. These branches meet at critical\nvalues of the electric field and impose a maximum value of $\\mathcal{E}$ that\nshould be reflected in the dual field theory. For both the soliton and black\nhole geometries, we study boundary data such as the stress tensor. For the\nblack hole, we also consider horizon observables such as the entropy. At finite\ntemperature, we consider the Gibbs free energy for both phases and determine\nthe phase transition between them. We find that the $AdS$ soliton dominates at\nlow temperature for an electric field up to the maximum value. Using the\ngauge/gravity duality, we propose that these solutions are dual to deformed\nABJM theory and compute the corresponding weak coupling phase diagram.\n", "  Soon after the observation of the first black hole binary (BHB) by advanced\nLIGO (aLIGO), GW150914, it was realised that such a massive system would have\nbeen observable in the milli-Hz (mHz) band few years prior to coalescence.\nOperating in the frequency range 0.1-100 mHz, the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) can potentially detect up to thousands inspiralling BHBs, based\non the coalescence rates inferred from the aLIGO first observing run (O1). The\nvast majority of them (those emitting at $f<10$ mHz) will experience only a\nminor frequency drift during LISA lifetime, resulting in signals similar to\nthose emitted by galactic white dwarf binaries. At $f>10$ mHz however, several\nof them will sweep through the LISA band, eventually producing loud\ncoalescences in the audio-band probed by aLIGO. This contribution reviews the\nscientific potential of these new class of LISA sources which, in the past few\nmonths, has been investigated in several contexts, including multi-messenger\nand multi-band gravitational wave astronomy, BHB astrophysics, tests of\nalternative theories of gravity and cosmography.\n", "  In this report, we demonstrate high spectral responsivity (SR) in MBE grown\nepitaxial \\b{eta}-Ga2O3-based solar blind MSM photodetectors (PD). (-2 0\n1)-oriented \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 thin film was grown by plasma-assisted MBE on c-plane\nsapphire substrates. MSM devices fabricated with Ni/Au contacts in an\ninterdigitated geometry were found to exhibit peak SR > 1.5 A/W at 236-240 nm\nat a bias of 4 V with a UV to visible rejection ratio > 105. The devices\nexhibited very low dark current < 10 nA at 20 V and showed no persistent\nphotoconductivity (PPC) as evident from the sharp transients with a\nphoto-to-dark current ratio > 103. These results represent the state-of-art\nperformance for MBE-grown \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 MSM solar blind detector.\n", "  When internal states of atoms are manipulated using coherent optical or\nradio-frequency (RF) radiation, it is essential to know the polarization of the\nradiation with respect to the quantization axis of the atom. We first present a\nmeasurement of the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the electric-field\namplitude of a linearly-polarized pulsed RF electric field at $\\sim 25.6\\,$GHz\nand its angle with respect to a static electric field. The measurements exploit\ncoherent population transfer between the $35$s and $35$p Rydberg states of\nhelium atoms in a pulsed supersonic beam. Based on this experimental result, we\ndevelop a general framework in the form of a set of equations relating the five\nindependent polarization parameters of a coherently oscillating field in a\nfixed laboratory frame to Rabi rates of transitions between a ground and three\nexcited states of an atom with arbitrary quantization axis. We then explain how\nthese equations can be used to fully characterize the polarization in a minimum\nof five Rabi rate measurements by rotation of an external bias-field, or,\nknowing the polarization of the driving field, to determine the orientation of\nthe static field using two measurements. The presented technique is not limited\nto Rydberg atoms and RF fields but can also be applied to characterize optical\nfields. The technique has potential for sensing the spatiotemporal properties\nof electromagnetic fields, e.g., in metrology devices or in hybrid experiments\ninvolving atoms close to surfaces.\n", "  Organic semiconductors possess an intrinsic energetic disorder\ncharacteristic, which holds an exceptionally important role for understanding\norganic photovoltaic (OPV) operation and future optimization. We performed\nillumination intensity dependence of capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements in\nPIDTDTQx:PC70BM based organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaics in\nworking conditions. Energetic disorder profiles for the photo-active layer,\nPIDTDTQx:PC70BM, changed significantly when different interfaces were involved.\nThe effects of energetic disorder that could be reflected from C-V profiles are\nincorporated through an exponential or Gaussian model of density of states\n(DOS), or a combination of these two. Results underlie that an identical\norganic blend in BHJ solar cells exhibits different energetic disorder when it\ninteracts with various interfaces. It may, thus, has a certain impact on OPV\nperformances, such as open-circuit voltage (V_oc ). Our study provides device\nphysicists a different perspective view for tailoring the organic energetic\ndisorder parameter via interfaces in order to enhance photo-electron conversion\nefficiencies (PCE).\n", "  We find regular axionic Euclidean wormhole solutions in Type IIB string\ntheory compactified on $\\text{AdS}_5\\times \\text{S}^5/\\mathbb{Z}_k$. AdS/CFT\nenables a precise derivation of the axion content of the Euclidean theory,\nplacing the string theory embedding of the wormholes on firm footing. This\nfurther sharpens the paradox posed by these solutions.\n", "  In topological semimetals the Dirac points can form zero-dimensional and\none-dimensional manifolds, as predicted for Dirac/Weyl semimetals and\ntopological nodal line semimetals, respectively. Here, based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we predict a topological nodal line semimetal\nphase in the two-dimensional compounds $X_2Y$ ($X$=Ca, Sr, and Ba; $Y$=As, Sb,\nand Bi) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with a band inversion at\nthe M point. The mirror symmetry as well as the electrostatic interaction, that\ncan be engineered via strain, are responsible for the nontrivial phase. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the exotic edge states can be also obtained\nwithout and with SOC although a tiny gap appears at the nodal line for the bulk\nstates when SOC is included.\n", "  We developed a fast X-ray detector system for nuclear resonant scattering\n(NRS) experiments. Our system employs silicon avalanche photo-diode (Si-APD) as\na fast X-ray sensor. The system is able to acquire both timing and energy of a\nsingle X-ray photon simultaneously in a high rate condition, $10^6$ counts per\nsecond for one Si-APD. The performance of the system was investigated in\nSPring-8, a synchrotron radiation facility in Japan. Good time resolution of\n\\SI{120}{ps} (FWHM) was achieved with a slight tail distribution in the time\nspectrum by a level of $10^{-9}$ at 1 ns apart from the peak. Using this\nsystem, we successfully observed the NRS from the 26.27-keV level of\nmercury-201, which has a half-life of $630 \\pm 50$ ps. We also demonstrated the\nreduction of background events caused by radioactive decays in a radioactive\nsample by discriminating photon energy.\n", "  Chinese ancient sage Laozi said everything comes from \\emph{\\bf \\em\n\"nothing\"}. \\rm In the first letter (Chin. Phys. Lett. 30 (2013) 080202),\ninfinitely many discrete integrable systems have been obtained from \"nothing\"\nvia simple principles (Dao). In this second letter, a new idea, the consistent\ncorrelated bang, is introduced to obtain nonlinear dynamic systems including\nsome integrable ones such as the continuous nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\n(NLS), the (potential) Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, the (potential)\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and the sine-Gordon (sG) equation. These\nnonlinear systems are derived from nothing via suitable \"Dao\", the shifted\nparity, the charge conjugate, the delayed time reversal, the shifted exchange,\nthe shifted-parity-rotation and so on.\n", "  We experimentally examine the topological nature of a strongly coupled\nspin-photon system induced by damping. The presence of both spin and photonic\nlosses results in a non-Hermitian system with a variety of exotic phenomena\ndictated by the topological structure of the eigenvalue spectra and the\npresence of an exceptional point (EP), where the coupled spin-photon\neigenvectors coalesce. By controlling both the spin resonance frequency and the\nspin-photon coupling strength we observe a resonance crossing for\ncooperativities above one, suggesting that the boundary between weak and strong\ncoupling should be based on the EP location rather than the cooperativity.\nFurthermore we observe dynamic mode switching when encircling the EP and\nidentify the potential to engineer the topological structure of coupled\nspin-photon systems with additional modes. Our work therefore further\nhighlights the role of damping within the strong coupling regime, and\ndemonstrates the potential and great flexibility of spin-photon systems for\nstudies of non-Hermitian physics.\n", "  The decay properties of the linear-chain states in $^{14}$C are investigated\nby using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculation predicts two\nrotational bands with linear-chain configurations having the $\\pi$-bond and\n$\\sigma$-bond valence neutrons. For the $\\pi$-bond linear-chain, the calculated\nexcitation energies and the widths of $\\alpha$-decay to the ground state of\n$^{10}{\\rm Be}$ reasonably agree with the experimental candidates observed by\nthe $\\alpha+{}^{10}{\\rm Be}$ resonant scattering. On the other hand, the\n$\\sigma$-bond linear-chain is the candidate of the higher-lying resonant states\nreported by the break-up reaction. As the evidence of the $\\sigma$-bond\nlinear-chain, we discuss its decay pattern. It is found that the $\\sigma$-bond\nlinear-chain not only decays to the excited band of $^{10}{\\rm Be}$ but also\ndecays to the three-body channel of $^{6}{\\rm He}+\\alpha+\\alpha$, and the\nbranching ratio of these decays are comparable. Hence, we suggest that this\ncharacteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear-chain\nformation and a key observable to distinguish two different linear-chains.\n", "  Dark Matter which interacts strongly with itself, but only feebly with the\nStandard Model is a possibility that has been entertained to solve apparent\nsmall-scale structure problems that are pertinent to the non-interacting cold\nDark Matter paradigm. In this paper, we study the simple case in which the\nself-scattering rate today is regulated by kinematics and/or the abundance\nratio, through the mass-splitting of nearly degenerate pseudo-Dirac fermions\n$\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ or real scalars $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$. We calculate the\nrelic density of these states in a scenario where self-scattering proceeds\nthrough off-diagonal couplings with a vector particle $V$ (Dark Photon) and\nwhere the abundance is set through number-depleting 4-to-2 reactions in the\nhidden sector, or, alternatively, via freeze-in. We study the implications of\nthe considered models and their prospect of solving astrophysical small-scale\nstructure problems. We also show how the introduction of the (meta-)stable\nheavier state may be probed in future dark matter searches.\n", "  By analyzing the large-angle Bhabha scattering events $e^{+}e^{-}$ $\\to$\n($\\gamma$)$e^{+}e^{-}$ and diphoton events $e^{+}e^{-}$ $\\to$ $\\gamma\\gamma$\nfor the data sets collected at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies between 2.2324\nand 4.5900 GeV (131 energy points in total) with the upgraded Beijing\nSpectrometer (BESIII) at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPCII), the\nintegrated luminosities have been measured at the different c.m. energies,\nindividually. The results are the important inputs for R value and $J/\\psi$\nresonance parameter measurements.\n", "  We analyze the stability of a non-Hermitian coupler with respect to\nmodulational inhomogeneous perturbations in the presence of unbalanced gain and\nloss. At the parity-time (PT) symmetry point the coupler is unstable. Suitable\nsymmetry breakings lead to an asymmetric coupler, which hosts nonlinear\nsupermodes. A subset of those broken symmetry cases finally yields nonlinear\nsupermodes which are stable against modulational perturbations. The lack of\nsymmetry requirements will facilitate experimental implementations and relevant\nphotonics applications.\n", "  The relation between the bosonic higher spin ${\\cal W}_\\infty[\\lambda]$\nalgebra, the affine Yangian of $\\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$, and the SH$^c$ algebra is\nestablished in detail. For generic $\\lambda$ we find explicit expressions for\nthe low-lying ${\\cal W}_\\infty[\\lambda]$ modes in terms of the affine Yangian\ngenerators, and deduce from this the precise identification between $\\lambda$\nand the parameters of the affine Yangian. Furthermore, for the free field cases\ncorresponding to $\\lambda=0$ and $\\lambda=1$ we give closed-form expressions\nfor the affine Yangian generators in terms of the free fields. Interestingly,\nthe relation between the ${\\cal W}_\\infty$ modes and those of the affine\nYangian is a non-local one, in general. We also establish the explicit\ndictionary between the affine Yangian and the SH$^c$ generators. Given that\nYangian algebras are the hallmark of integrability, these identifications\nshould pave the way towards uncovering the relation between the integrable and\nthe higher spin symmetries.\n", "  The extra heat generation in spin transport is usually interpreted in terms\nof the spin relaxation. By reformulating the heat generation rate, we found\nalternative current-force pairs without cross effects, which enable us to\ninterpret the product of each pair as a distinct mechanism of heat generation.\nThe results show that the spin-dependent part of the heat generation includes\ntwo terms. One of them is proportional to the square of the spin accumulation\nand arises from the spin relaxation. However, the other is proportional to the\nsquare of the spin-accumulation gradient and should be attributed to another\nmechanism, the spin diffusion. We illustrated the characteristics of the two\nmechanisms in a typical spin valve with a finite nonmagnetic spacer layer.\n", "  The cable model is widely used in several fields of science to describe the\npropagation of signals. A relevant medical and biological example is the\nanomalous subdiffusion in spiny neuronal dendrites observed in several studies\nof the last decade. Anomalous subdiffusion can be modelled in several ways\nintroducing some fractional component into the classical cable model. The\nChauchy problem associated to these kind of models has been investigated by\nmany authors, but up to our knowledge an explicit solution for the signalling\nproblem has not yet been published. Here we propose how this solution can be\nderived applying the generalized convolution theorem (known as Efros theorem)\nfor Laplace transforms. The fractional cable model considered in this paper is\ndefined by replacing the first order time derivative with a fractional\nderivative of order $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ of Caputo type. The signalling problem is\nsolved for any input function applied to the accessible end of a semi-infinite\ncable, which satisfies the requirements of the Efros theorem. The solutions\ncorresponding to the simple cases of impulsive and step inputs are explicitly\ncalculated in integral form containing Wright functions. Thanks to the\nvariability of the parameter $\\alpha$, the corresponding solutions are expected\nto adapt to the qualitative behaviour of the membrane potential observed in\nexperiments better than in the standard case $\\alpha=1$.\n", "  We examine the 2008-2016 gamma-ray and optical light curves of a number of\nbright Fermi blazars. In a fraction of them, the periodograms show possible\nevidence of quasi-periodicities related in the two bands. This coincidence\nstrengthens their physical meaning. Comparing with results from the periodicity\nsearch of quasars, the presence of quasi-periodicities in blazars suggests that\nthe basic condition for its observability is related to the relativistic jet in\nthe observer direction, but the overall picture remains uncertain.\n", "  The new data on the elastic $pp$ and single pion production reaction $pp\\to\npn \\pi^{+}$ taken at the incident proton momentum 1683 MeV/c are presented. The\ndata on the $pp\\to pn \\pi^{+}$ reaction are compared with predictions from the\nOPE model. To extract contributions of the leading partial waves the single\npion production data are analyzed in the framework of the event-by-event\nmaximum likelihood method together with the data measured earlier. The analysis\nallows us to obtain the assessment with a better precision the contributions\nfrom different initial partial waves.\n", "  A wide variety of unified models predict asymptotic relations at $M_{GUT}$\nbetween the b quark and $\\tau$ lepton Yukawa couplings. Within the framework of\nsupersymmetric SU(4) $\\times$ SU(2)$_L \\times$ SU(2)$_R$, we explore regions of\nthe parameter space that are compatible with b-$\\tau$ quasi-Yukawa unification\nand the higgsinos being the lightest supersymmetric particles ($\\lesssim$ 1\nTeV). Among the colored sparticles, the stop weighs more than 1.5 TeV or so,\nwhereas the squarks of the first two families are signifcantly heavier,\napproaching 10 TeV in some cases. The gluino mass is estimated to lie in the\n2-4 TeV range which raises the important question: Will the LHC find the\ngluino?\n", "  Future hadron colliders will have a remarkable capacity to discover massive\nnew particles, but their capabilities for precision measurements of couplings\nthat can reveal underlying mechanisms have received less study. In this work we\nstudy the capability of future hadron colliders to shed light on a precise,\nfocused question: is the higgs mass of 125 GeV explained by the MSSM? If\nsupersymmetry is realized near the TeV scale, a future hadron collider could\nproduce huge numbers of gluinos and electroweakinos. We explore whether\nprecision measurements of their properties could allow inference of the scalar\nmasses and $\\tan \\beta$ with sufficient accuracy to test whether physics beyond\nthe MSSM is needed to explain the higgs mass. We also discuss dark matter\ndirect detection and precision higgs physics as complementary probes of $\\tan\n\\beta$. For concreteness, we focus on the mini-split regime of MSSM parameter\nspace at a 100 TeV $pp$ collider, with scalar masses ranging from 10s to about\n1000 TeV.\n", "  In a previous work, we analyzed collapsing axion stars using the low-energy\ninstanton potential, showing that the total energy is always bounded and that\ncollapsing axion stars do not form black holes. In this paper, we provide a\nproof that the conclusions are unchanged when using instead the more general\nchiral potential for QCD axions.\n", "  In this work, we study the effects of strong magnetic field configurations on\nthe population of neutron stars. The stellar matter is described within a\nrelativistic mean field formalism which considers many-body force contributions\nin the scalar couplings. We choose the parametrization of the model that\nreproduces nuclear matter properties at saturation and also describes massive\nhyperon stars. Hadronic matter is modeled at zero temperature, in\nbeta-equilibrium, charge neutral and populated by the baryonic octet, electrons\nand muons. Magnetic effects are taken into account in the structure of stars by\nthe solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the assumption of a\npoloidal magnetic field distribution. Our results show that magnetic neutron\nstars are populated essencialy by nucleons and leptons, due to the fact that\nstrong magnetic fields decrease the central density of stars and, hence,\nsupress the appearance of exotic particles.\n", "  We study the non-radial oscillation modes of strange quark stars with a\nhomogeneous core and a crust made of strangelets. Using a 2-component equation\nof state (core+crust) for strange quark stars that can produce stars as heavy\nas 2 solar masses, we identify the high-frequency l=2 spheroidal (f, p) in\nNewtonian gravity, using the Cowling approximation. The results are compared to\nthe case of homogeneous compact stars such as polytropic neutron stars, as well\nas bare strange stars. We find that the strangelet crust only increases very\nslightly the frequency of the spheroidal modes, and that Newtonian gravity\noverestimates the mode frequencies of the strange star, as is the case for\nneutron stars.\n", "  We study a mass transport model on a ring with parallel update, where a\ncontinuous mass is randomly redistributed along distinct links of the lattice,\nchoosing at random one of the two partitions at each time step. The\nredistribution process on a given link depends on the masses on both sites, at\nvariance with the Zero Range Process and its continuous mass generalizations.\nWe show that the steady-state distribution takes a simple non-factorized form\nthat can be written as a sum of two inhomogeneous product measures. A\nfactorized measure is recovered for a symmetric mass redistribution,\ncorresponding to an equilibrium process. A non-equilibrium free energy can be\nexplicitly defined from the partition function. We evaluate different\ncharacterizations of the `distance' to equilibrium, either dynamic or static:\nthe mass flux, the entropy production rate, the Gibbs free-energy difference\nbetween the equilibrium and non-equilibrium stationary states, and the\nderivative of the non-equilibrium free energy with respect to the applied\ndriving force. The connection between these different non-equilibrium\nparameters is discussed.\n", "  In the present article the classical problem of electromagnetic scattering by\na single homogeneous sphere is revisited. Main focus is the study of the\nscattering behavior as a function of the material contrast and the size\nparameters for all electric and magnetic resonances of a dielectric sphere.\nSpecifically, the Pad\\'e approximants are introduced and utilized as an\nalternative system expansion of the Mie coefficients. Low order Pad\\'e\napproximants can give compact and physically insightful expressions for the\nscattering system and the enabled dynamic mechanisms. Higher order approximants\nare used for predicting accurately the resonant pole spectrum. These results\nare summarized into general pole formulae, covering up to fifth order magnetic\nand forth order electric resonances of a small dielectric sphere. Additionally,\nthe connection between the radiative damping process and the resonant linewidth\nis investigated. The results obtained reveal the fundamental connection of the\nradiative damping mechanism with the maximum width occurring for each\nresonance. Finally, the suggested system ansatz is used for studying the\nresonant absorption maximum through a circuit-inspired perspective.\n", "  String scenarios generically predict that we live in a so called axiverse:\nthe Universe with about a hundred of light axion species which are decoupled\nfrom the Standard Model particles. However, the axions can couple to the\ninflaton which leads to their production after inflation. Then, these axions\nremain in the expanding Universe contributing to the dark radiation component,\nwhich is severely bounded from present cosmological data. We place a general\nconstraint on the axion production rate and apply it to several variants of\nreasonable inflaton-to-axion couplings. The limit merely constrains the number\nof ultralight axions and the relative strength of inflaton-to-axion coupling.\nIt is valid in both large and small field inflationary models irrespectively of\nthe axion energy scales and masses. Thus, the limit is complementary to those\nassociated with the Universe overclosure and axion isocurvature fluctuations.\nIn particular, a hundred of axions is forbidden if inflaton universally couples\nto all the fields at reheating. In the case of gravitational sector being\nresponsible for the reheating of the Universe (which is a natural option in all\ninflationary models with modified gravity), the axion production can be\nefficient. We find that in the Starobinsky $R^2$-inflation even a single axion\n(e.g. the standard QCD-axion) is in tension with the Planck data, making the\nmodel inconsistent with the axiverse. The general conclusion is that an\ninflation with inefficient reheating mechanism and low reheating temperature\nmay be in tension with the presence of light scalars.\n", "  We present the first extensive X-ray study of the North-America and Pelican\nstar-forming region (NGC7000/IC5070), with the aim of finding and\ncharacterizing its young stellar population. X-ray data from Chandra (four\npointings) and XMM-Newton (seven pointings) were reduced and source detection\nwas performed on each image. We complement the X-ray data with optical and\nnear-IR data from the IPHAS, UKIDSS, and 2MASS catalogs, and with other\npublished optical and Spitzer IR data. More than 700 X-ray sources are\ndetected, the majority of which have an optical/NIR counterpart. This allows to\nidentify young stars in different stages of formation. Less than 30% of X-ray\nsources are identified with a previously known young star. We argue that most\nX-ray sources with an optical/NIR counterpart, except perhaps for a few tens at\nnear-zero reddening, are likely candidate members of the star-forming region,\non the basis of both their optical/NIR magnitudes and colors, and of X-ray\nproperties like spectrum hardness or flux variations. They are characterized by\na wide range of extinction, and sometimes near-IR excesses, both of which\nprevent derivation of accurate stellar parameters. The optical color-magnitude\ndiagram suggests ages between 1-10~Myrs. The X-ray members have a very complex\nspatial distribution with some degree of subclustering, qualitatively similar\nto that of previously known members. The distribution of X-ray sources relative\nto IR-excess objects found with Spitzer is sometimes suggestive of sequential\nstar formation, especially near the Gulf of Mexico region, probably triggered\nby the O5 star illuminating the whole region. Around this latter star no\nenhancement in the young star density is found, in agreement with previous\nresults. We also determine the local optical/IR reddening law, and compute an\nupdated reddening map of the entire region.\n", "  The jets from active galactic nuclei exhibit stability which seems to be far\nsuperior compared to that of terrestrial and laboratory jets. They manage to\npropagate over distances up to a billion of initial jet radii. Yet this may not\nbe an indication of some exotic physics but mainly a reflection of the specific\nenvironment these jets propagate through. The key property of this environment\nis a rapid decline of density and pressure along the jet, which promotes its\nrapid expansion. Such an expansion can suppress global instabilities, which\nrequire communication across the jet, and hence ensure its survival over huge\ndistances. At kpc scales, some AGN jets do show signs of strong instabilities\nand even turn into plumes. This could be a result of the flattening of the\nexternal pressure distribution in their host galaxies or inside the radio\nlobes. In this regard, we discuss the possible connection between the stability\nissue and the Fanaroff-Riley classification of extragalactic radio sources. The\nobservations of AGN jets on sub-kpc scale do not seem to support their supposed\nlack of causal connectivity. When interpreted using simple kinematic models,\nthey reveal a rather perplexing picture with more questions than answers on the\njets dynamics.\n", "  The hypothesis that the QCD vacuum can be modeled as a dual superconductor is\na powerful tool to describe the distribution of the color field generated by a\nquark-antiquark static pair and, as such, can provide useful clues for the\nunderstanding of confinement. In this work we investigate, by lattice Monte\nCarlo simulations of the $SU(3)$ pure gauge theory and of (2+1)-flavor QCD with\nphysical mass settings, some properties of the chromoelectric flux tube at zero\ntemperature and their dependence on the physical distance between the static\nsources. We draw some conclusions about the validity domain of the dual\nsuperconductor picture.\n", "  Fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) separate into two categories based\non their bolometric and near-infrared (NIR) properties. The peak bolometric\nluminosity ($\\mathrm{L_{max}}$), the phase of the first maximum relative to the\noptical, the NIR peak luminosity and the occurrence of a second maximum in the\nNIR distinguish a group of very faint SN Ia. Fast-declining supernovae show a\nlarge range of peak bolometric luminosities ($\\mathrm{L_{max}}$ differing by up\nto a factor of $\\sim$ 8). All fast-declining SN Ia with $\\mathrm{L_{max}} < 0.3\n\\cdot$ 10$^{43}\\mathrm{erg s}^{-1}$ are spectroscopically classified as\n91bg-like and show only a single NIR peak. SNe with $\\mathrm{L_{max}} > 0.5\n\\cdot$ 10$^{43}\\mathrm{erg s}^{-1}$ appear to smoothly connect to normal SN Ia.\nThe total ejecta mass (M$_{ej}$) values for SNe with enough late time data are\n$\\lesssim$1 $M_{\\odot}$, indicating a sub-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor for\nthese SNe.\n", "  Surface scattering of neutral helium beams created by supersonic expansion is\nan established technique for measuring structural and dynamical properties of\nsurfaces on the atomic scale. Helium beams have also been used in Fraunhofer\nand Fresnel diffraction experiments. Due to the short wavelength of the atom\nbeams of typically 0.1nm or less, Fraunhofer diffraction experiments in\ntransmission have so far been limited to grating structures with a period\n(pitch) of up to 200nm. However, larger periods are of interest for several\napplications, for example for the characterization of photonic crystal membrane\nstructures, where the period is typically in the micron/high sub-micron range.\nHere we present helium atom diffraction measurements of a photonic crystal\nmembrane structure with a two dimensional square lattice of 100x100 circular\nholes. The nominal period and hole radius were 490nm and 100nm respectively. To\nour knowledge this is the largest period that has ever been measured with\nhelium diffraction. The helium diffraction measurements are interpreted using a\nmodel based on the helium beam characteristics. It is demonstrated how to\nsuccessfully extract values from the experimental data for the average period\nof the grating, the hole diameter and the width of the virtual source used to\nmodel the helium beam.\n", "  We start with the Hamiltonian formulation of the first order action of pure\ngravity with a full $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb C)$ internal gauge symmetry. We\nmake a partial gauge-fixing which reduces $\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb C)$ to its\nsub-algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$. This case corresponds to a splitting of the\nspace-time ${\\cal M}=\\Sigma \\times \\mathbb R$ where $\\Sigma$ inherits an\narbitrary Lorentzian metric of signature $(-,+,+)$. Then, we find a\nparametrization of the phase space in terms of an $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$\ncommutative connection and its associated conjugate electric field. Following\nthe techniques of Loop Quantum Gravity, we start the quantization of the theory\nand we consider the kinematical Hilbert space on a given fixed graph $\\Gamma$\nwhose edges are colored with unitary representations of $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$.\nWe compute the spectrum of area operators acting of the kinematical Hilbert\nspace: we show that space-like areas have discrete spectra, in agreement with\nusual $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Loop Quantum Gravity, whereas time-like areas have\ncontinuous spectra. We conclude on the possibility to make use of this\nformulation of gravity to construct a holographic description of black holes in\nthe framework of Loop Quantum Gravity.\n", "  The effects that energetic trapped ions have on linear resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities are studied in a reduced model that\ncaptures the essential physics driving or damping the modes through variations\nin the magnetic shear. The drift-kinetic orbital interaction of a slowing down\ndistribution of trapped energetic ions with a resistive MHD instability is\nintegrated to a scalar contribution to the perturbed pressure, and entered into\nan asymptotic matching formalism for the resistive MHD dispersion relation.\nToroidal magnetic field line curvature is included to model trapping in the\nparticle distribution, in an otherwise cylindrical model. The focus is on a\nconfiguration that is driven unstable to the m/n = 2/1 mode by increasing\npressure, where m is the poloidal mode number and n the toroidal. The particles\nand pressure can affect the mode both in the core region where there can be low\nand reversed shear and outside the resonant surface in significant positive\nshear. The results show that the energetic ions damp and stabilize the mode\nwhen orbiting in significant positive shear, increasing the marginal stability\nboundary. However, the inner core region contribution with low and reversed\nshear can drive the mode unstable. This effect of shear on the energetic ion\npressure contribution is found to be consistent with the literature. These\nresults explain the observation that the 2/1 mode was found to be damped and\nstabilized by energetic ions in {\\delta}f - MHD simulations of tokamak\nexperiments with positive shear throughout, while the 2/1 mode was found to be\ndriven unstable in simulations of experiments with weakly reversed shear in the\ncore. This is also found to be consistent with related experimental\nobservations of the stability of the 2/1 mode changing significantly with core\nshear.\n", "  The BiPo-3 detector, running in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory\n(Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc, LSC, Spain) since 2013, is a\nlow-radioactivity detector dedicated to measuring ultra low natural\nradionuclide contaminations of $^{208}$Tl ($^{232}$Th chain) and $^{214}$Bi\n($^{238}$U chain) in thin materials. The total sensitive surface area of the\ndetector is 3.6 m$^2$. The detector has been developed to measure radiopurity\nof the selenium double $\\beta$-decay source foils of the SuperNEMO experiment.\nIn this paper the design and performance of the detector, and results of the\nbackground measurements in $^{208}$Tl and $^{214}$Bi, are presented, and\nvalidation of the BiPo-3 measurement with a calibrated aluminium foil is\ndiscussed. Results of the $^{208}$Tl and $^{214}$Bi activity measurements of\nthe first enriched $^{82}$Se foils of the double $\\beta$-decay SuperNEMO\nexperiment are reported. The sensitivity of the BiPo-3 detector for the\nmeasurement of the SuperNEMO $^{82}$Se foils is $\\mathcal{A}$($^{208}$Tl) $<2$\n$\\mu$Bq/kg (90\\% C.L.) and $\\mathcal{A}$($^{214}$Bi) $<140$ $\\mu$Bq/kg (90\\%\nC.L.) after 6 months of measurement.\n", "  Here we present the evidence for periodicity of an optical emission detected\nin several AGN. Significant periodicity is found in light curves and radial\nvelocity curves. We discuss possible mechanisms that could produce such\nperiodic variability and their implications. The results are consistent with\npossible detection of the orbital motion in proximity of the AGN central\nsupermassive black holes.\n", "  We show the important role played by the $\\pi\\Delta(1232)$ channel in the\nbuild up of the $N(1700)(3/2^-)$ resonance due to the non-trivial enhancement\nproduced by a singularity of a triangular loop. The $N(1700)$ is one of the\ndynamically generated resonances produced by the coupled channel vector-baryon\ninteraction. The $\\pi\\Delta$ channel was neglected in previous works but we\nshow that it has to be incorporated into the coupled channel formalism due to\nan enhancement produced by a singularity in the triangular loop with $\\rho$,\nnucleon and $\\pi$ as internal loop lines and $\\pi$ and $\\Delta$ as external\nones. The enhancement is of non-resonant origin but it contributes to the\ndynamical generation of the $N(1700)$ resonance due to the non-linear dynamics\ninvolved in the coupled channel mechanisms. We obtain an important increase of\nthe total width of the $N(1700)$ resonance when the $\\pi\\Delta$ channel is\nincluded and provide predictions for the partial widths of the $N(1700)$ decays\ninto $VB$ and $\\pi\\Delta$.\n", "  The divacancies in SiC are a family of paramagnetic defects that show promise\nfor quantum communication technologies due to their long-lived electron spin\ncoherence and their optical addressability at near-telecom wavelengths.\nNonetheless, a mechanism for high-fidelity spin-to-photon conversion, which is\na crucial prerequisite for such technologies, has not yet been demonstrated.\nHere we demonstrate a high-fidelity spin-to-photon interface in isolated\ndivacancies in epitaxial films of 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC. Our data show that\ndivacancies in 4H-SiC have minimal undesirable spin-mixing, and that the\noptical linewidths in our current sample are already similar to those of recent\nremote entanglement demonstrations in other systems. Moreover, we find that\n3C-SiC divacancies have millisecond Hahn-echo spin coherence time, which is\namong the longest measured in a naturally isotopic solid. The presence of\ndefects with these properties in a commercial semiconductor that can be\nheteroepitaxially grown as a thin film on shows promise for future quantum\nnetworks based on SiC defects.\n", "  Galactic outflows are believed to play an important role in regulating star\nformation in galaxies, but estimates of the outflowing mass and momentum have\nhistorically been based on uncertain assumptions. Here, we measure the mass,\nmomentum, and energy outflow rates of seven nearby star-forming galaxies using\nultraviolet absorption lines and observationally motivated estimates for the\ndensity, metallicity, and radius of the outflow. Low-mass galaxies generate\noutflows faster than their escape velocities with mass outflow rates up to\ntwenty times larger than their star formation rates. These outflows from\nlow-mass galaxies also have momenta larger than provided from supernovae alone,\nindicating that multiple momentum sources drive these outflows. Only 1-20\\% of\nthe supernovae energy is converted into kinetic energy, and this fraction\ndecreases with increasing stellar mass such that low-mass galaxies drive more\nefficient outflows. We find scaling relations between the outflows and the\nstellar mass of their host galaxies (M$_\\ast$) at the 2-3$\\sigma$ significance\nlevel. The mass-loading factor, or the mass outflow rate divided by the star\nformation rate, scales as M$_\\ast^{-0.4}$ and with the circular velocity as\nv$_\\mathrm{circ}^{-1.6}$. The scaling of the mass-loading factor is similar to\nrecent simulations, but the observations are a factor of five smaller, possibly\nindicating that there is a substantial amount of unprobed gas in a different\nionization phase. The outflow momenta are consistent with a model where star\nformation drives the outflow while gravity counteracts this acceleration.\n", "  The coeval AGN and galaxy evolution and the observed local relations between\nSMBHs and galaxy properties suggest some connection or feedback between SMBH\ngrowth and galaxy build-up. We looked for correlations between properties of\nX-ray detected AGN and their FIR detected host galaxies, to find quantitative\nevidences for this connection, highly debated in the latest years. We exploit\nthe rich multi-wavelength data set available in the COSMOS field for a large\nsample (692 sources) of AGN and their hosts, in the redshift range $0.1<z<4$.\nWe use X-ray data to select AGN and determine their properties (intrinsic\nluminosity and nuclear obscuration), and broad-band SED fitting to derive host\ngalaxy properties (stellar mass $M_*$ and star formation rate SFR). We find\nthat the AGN 2-10 keV luminosity ($L_{\\rm X}$) and the host $8-1000~\\mu m$ star\nformation luminosity ($L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm SF}$) are significantly correlated.\nHowever, the average host $L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm SF}$ has a flat distribution in bins\nof AGN $L_{\\rm X}$, while the average AGN $L_{\\rm X}$ increases in bins of host\n$L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm SF}$, with logarithmic slope of $\\sim0.7$, in the redshifts\nrange $0.4<z<1.2$. We also discuss the comparison between the distribution of\nthese two quantities and the predictions from hydro-dynamical simulations.\nFinally we find that the average column density ($N_H$) shows a positive\ncorrelation with the host $M_*$, at all redshifts, but not with the SFR (or\n$L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm SF}$). This translates into a negative correlation with\nspecific SFR. Our results are in agreement with the idea that BH accretion and\nSF rates are correlated, but occur with different variability time scales. The\npresence of a positive correlation between $N_H$ and host $M_*$ suggests that\nthe X-ray $N_H$ is not entirely due to the circum-nuclear obscuring torus, but\nmay also include a contribution from the host galaxy.\n", "  We formulate a new family of high order on-surface radiation conditions to\napproximate the outgoing solution to the Helmholtz equation in exterior\ndomains. Motivated by the pseudo-differential expansion of the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator developed by Antoine et al. (J. Math. Anal. Appl.\n229:184-211, 1999), we design a systematic procedure to apply\npseudo-differential symbols of arbitrarily high order. Numerical results are\npresented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method for solving both\nthe Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary value problems. Possible improvements\nand extensions are also discussed.\n", "  The densities of mid-sized Kuiper belt objects are a key constraint into\nunderstanding the assembly of objects in the outer solar system. These objects\nare critical for understanding the currently unexplained transition from the\nsmallest Kuiper belt objects with densities lower than that of water to the\nlargest objects with significant rock content. Mapping this transition is made\ndifficult by the uncertainties in the diameters of these objects, which maps\ninto an even larger uncertainty in volume and thus density. The substantial\ncollecting area of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array allows significantly more\nprecise measurements of thermal emission from outer solar system objects and\ncould potentially greatly improve the density measurements. Here we use new\nthermal observations of four objects with satellites to explore the\nimprovements possible with millimeter data. We find that effects due to\neffective emissivity at millimeter wavelengths make it difficult to use the\nmillimeter data directly to find diameters and thus volumes for these bodies.\nIn addition, we find that when including the effects of model uncertainty, the\ntrue uncertainties on the sizes of outer solar system objects measured with\nradiometry are likely larger than those previously published. Substantial\nimprovement in object sizes will likely require precise occultation\nmeasurements.\n", "  Facing a heavy task, any single person can only make a limited contribution\nand team cooperation is needed. As one enjoys the benefit of the public goods,\nthe potential benefits of the project are not always maximized and may be\npartly wasted. By incorporating individual ability and project benefit into the\noriginal public goods game, we study the coupling effect of the four\nparameters, the upper limit of individual contribution, the upper limit of\nindividual benefit, the needed project cost and the upper limit of project\nbenefit on the evolution of cooperation. Coevolving with the individual-level\ngroup size preferences, an increase in the upper limit of individual benefit\npromotes cooperation while an increase in the upper limit of individual\ncontribution inhibits cooperation. The coupling of the upper limit of\nindividual contribution and the needed project cost determines the critical\npoint of the upper limit of project benefit, where the equilibrium frequency of\ncooperators reaches its highest level. Above the critical point, an increase in\nthe upper limit of project benefit inhibits cooperation. The evolution of\ncooperation is closely related to the preferred group-size distribution. A\nfunctional relation between the frequency of cooperators and the dominant group\nsize is found.\n", "  In quantum statistical mechanics, equilibrium states have been shown to be\nthe typical states for a system that is entangled with its environment,\nsuggesting a possible identification between thermodynamic and von Neumann\nentropies. In this paper, we investigate how the relaxation toward equilibrium\nis made possible through interactions that do not lead to significant exchange\nof energy, and argue for the validity of the second law of thermodynamics at\nthe microscopic scale.\n", "  At low energies or temperatures, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\non $\\mathbb R^{(t)}\\times S^1$ with large $N$ gauge group $SU(N)$ and strong\nt'Hooft coupling is conjectured to be dual to the low energy dynamics of a\ncollection of D0-branes on a circle. We construct thermal states in the\ngravitational side of the correspondence where we find a first-order phase\ntransition between states that are uniform on the $S^1$ and states that are\nlocalised on it. When compared with lattice computations that are now\navailable, these critical values provide the first instance where a first-order\nphase transition is tested on both sides of gauge/gravity duality.\n", "  A simple 'knee-like' approximation of the Lateral Distribution Function (LDF)\nof Cherenkov light emitted by EAS (extensive air showers) in the atmosphere is\nproposed for solving various tasks of data analysis in HiSCORE and other wide\nangle ground-based experiments designed to detect gamma rays and cosmic rays\nwith the energy above tens of TeV. Simulation-based parametric analysis of\nindividual LDF curves revealed that on the radial distance 20-500 m the\n5-parameter 'knee-like' approximation fits individual LDFs as well as the mean\nLDF with a very good accuracy. In this paper we demonstrate the efficiency and\nflexibility of the 'knee-like' LDF approximation for various primary particles\nand shower parameters and the advantages of its application to suppressing\nproton background and selecting primary gamma rays.\n", "  Results of the search for $\\sim (10^{16} - 10^{17.5})$ eV primary cosmic-ray\nphotons with the data of the Moscow State University (MSU) Extensive Air Shower\n(EAS) array are reported. The full-scale reanalysis of the data with modern\nsimulations of the installation does not confirm previous indications of the\nexcess of gamma-ray candidate events. Upper limits on the corresponding\ngamma-ray flux are presented. The limits are the most stringent published ones\nat energies $\\sim 10^{17}$ eV.\n", "  In this work, a numerical approach to investigate the room temperature\nluminescence emission from core/shell nanowire is presented where GaN quantum\ndiscs (QDiscs), periodically distributed in AlxGa1-xN nanowire, is considered\nas core and AlxGa1-xN as shell. Thin disk shaped (Ring shaped) n-doped region\nhas been placed at the GaN/ AlxGa1-xN (AlxGa1-xN /air) interface in AlxGa1-xN\nregion in axial (radial) directions. To obtain energy levels and related\nwavefunctions, self-consistent procedure has been employed to solve\nSchrodinger-Poisson equations with considering the spontaneous and\npiezoelectric polarization. Then luminescence spectrum is studied in details to\nrecognize the parameters influent in luminescence. The results show that the\namount of doping, size of QDiscs and theirs numbers have remarkable effects on\nthe band to band luminescence emission. Our numerical calculations gives some\ninsights into the luminescence emission of core/shell nanowire and exhibits a\nuseful tool to analyze findings in experiments.\n", "  The charged axial-vector $J^{P}=1^{+}$ tetraquarks $Z_{q}=[cq][\\bar {b} \\bar\nq ]$ and $Z_{s}=[cs][\\bar {b} \\bar s]$ with the open charm-bottom contents are\nstudied in the diquark-antidiquark model. The masses and meson-current\ncouplings of these states are calculated by employing QCD two-point sum rule\napproach, where the quark, gluon and mixed condensates up to eight dimensions\nare taken into account. These parameters of the tetraquark states $ Z_{q}$ and\n$Z_{s}$ are used to analyze the vertices $Z_q B_c \\rho $ and $Z_s B_c \\phi $ to\ndetermine the strong $g_{Z_qB_c \\rho }$ and $g_{Z_sB_c \\phi }$ couplings. For\nthese purposes, QCD light-cone sum rule method and its soft-meson approximation\nare utilized. The couplings $g_{Z_qB_c \\rho }$ and $ g_{Z_sB_c \\phi }$,\nextracted from this analysis, are applied for evaluating of the strong $Z_q \\to\nB_c \\rho$ and $Z_s \\to B_c \\phi$ decays' widths, which are essential results of\nthe present investigation. Our predictions for the masses of the $Z_{q}$ and\n$Z_{s}$ states are confronted with similar results available in the literature.\n", "  Massive Primordial Black Holes (MPBH) can be formed after inflation due to\nbroad peaks in the primordial curvature power spectrum that collapse\ngravitationally during the radiation era, to form clusters of black holes that\nmerge and increase in mass after recombination, generating today a broad\nmass-spectrum of black holes with masses ranging from 0.01 to $10^5~M_\\odot$.\nThese MPBH could act as seeds for galaxies and quick-start structure formation,\ninitiating reionization, forming galaxies at redshift $z>10$ and clusters at\n$z>1$. They may also be the seeds on which SMBH and IMBH form, by accreting gas\nonto them and forming the centers of galaxies and quasars at high redshift.\nThey form at rest with zero spin and have negligible cross-section with\nordinary matter. If there are enough of these MPBH, they could constitute the\nbulk of the Dark Matter today. Such PBH could be responsible for the observed\nfluctuations in the CIB and X-ray backgrounds. MPBH could be directly detected\nby the gravitational waves emitted when they merge to form more massive black\nholes, as recently reported by LIGO. Their continuous merging since\nrecombination could have generated a stochastic background of gravitational\nwaves that could eventually be detected by LISA and PTA. MPBH may actually be\nresponsible for the unidentified point sources seen by Fermi, Magic and\nChandra. Furthermore, the ejection of stars from shallow potential wells like\nthose of Dwarf Spheroidals (DSph), via the gravitational slingshot effect,\ncould be due to MPBH, thus alleviating the substructure and too-big-to-fail\nproblems of standard collisionless CDM. Their mass distribution peaks at a few\ntens of $M_\\odot$ today, and could be detected also with long-duration\nmicrolensing events, as well as by the anomalous motion of stars in GAIA. Their\npresence as CDM in the Universe could be seen in the time-dilation of lensed\nimages of quasars.\n", "  The secondary neutron fields at the deep tumor therapy terminal at HIRFL\n(Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou) were investigated. The distributions\nof neutron ambient dose equivalent were measured with a FHT762 Wendi-II neutron\nambient dose equivalent meter as the 12C ions with energies of 165, 207, 270,\nand 350 MeV/u bombarded on thick tissue-like targets. The thickness of targets\nused in experiments is larger than the range of the carbon ions. The neutron\nspectra and dose equivalent is simulated by using FLUKA code, and the results\nagree well with the experimental data. The experiment results showed that the\nneutron dose produced by fragmentation reactions in tissue can be neglected in\ncarbon-ion therapy, even considering their enhanced biological effectiveness.\nThese results are also valuable for radiation protection, especially in the\nshielding design of high energy heavy ion medical machines.\n", "  Experimental results and a model are presented to explain the observed\nunusual enhancement of the effective magnetic anisotropy Keff with decreasing\nparticle size D from 15 nm to 2.5 nm in {\\gamma}-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs). The\nsamples include oleic acid-coated NPs with D = 2.5, 3.4, 6.3 and 7.0 nm\ninvestigated here, with the results on other sizes taken from literature. Keff\nis determined from the analysis of the frequency dependence of the blocking\ntemperature TB after considering the effects of interparticle interactions on\nTB. The data of Keff vs. D is fit to the derived core-shell-based relation:\nKeff = Kb + (6KS/D) +Ksh{[1-(2d/D)]^(-3) -1}, with Kb = 1.9 x10^5 ergs/cm^3 as\nthe bulk-like contribution of the core, KS = 0.035 ergs/cm^2 as the\ncontribution of the surface layer, and Ksh = 1.057 x10^4 ergs/cm^3 as the\ncontributions of spins in the shell of thickness d = 1.1 nm. This equation\nrepresents an extension of the often-used Eq.: Keff = Kb + (6KS/D).\nSignificance of this new result is discussed.\n", "  Sub-Neptunes around FGKM dwarfs are evenly distributed in log orbital period\ndown to $\\sim$10 days, but dwindle in number at shorter periods. Both the break\nat $\\sim$10 days and the slope of the occurrence rate down to $\\sim$1 day can\nbe attributed to the truncation of protoplanetary disks by their host star\nmagnetospheres at co-rotation. We demonstrate this by deriving planet\noccurrence rate profiles from empirical distributions of pre-main-sequence\nstellar rotation periods. Observed profiles are better reproduced when planets\nare distributed randomly in disks---as might be expected if planets formed in\nsitu---rather than piled up near disk edges, as would be the case if they\nmigrated in by disk torques. Planets can be brought from disk edges to\nultra-short ($< 1$ day) periods by asynchronous equilibrium tides raised on\ntheir stars. Tidal migration can account for how ultra-short period planets\n(USPs) are more widely spaced than their longer period counterparts. Our\npicture provides a starting point for understanding why metal-rich stars tend\nto harbor more USPs, and why the sub-Neptune population drops at $\\sim$10 days\nregardless of whether the host star is of type FGK or early M. We predict\nplanet occurrence rates around A stars to also break at short periods, but at\n$\\sim$1 day instead of $\\sim$10 days because A stars rotate faster than lower\nmass stars (this prediction presumes that the planetesimal building blocks of\nplanets can drift inside the dust sublimation radius).\n", "  We have subjected the planar pendulum eigenproblem to a symmetry analysis\nwith the goal of explaining the relationship between its conditional\nquasi-exact solvability (C-QES) and the topology of its eigenenergy surfaces,\nestablished in our earlier work [Frontiers in Physical Chemistry and Chemical\nPhysics 2, 1-16, (2014)]. The present analysis revealed that this relationship\ncan be traced to the structure of the tridiagonal matrices representing the\nsymmetry-adapted pendular Hamiltonian, as well as enabled us to identify many\nmore -- forty in total to be exact -- analytic solutions. Furthermore, an\nanalogous analysis of the hyperbolic counterpart of the planar pendulum, the\nRazavy problem, which was shown to be also C-QES [American Journal of Physics\n48, 285 (1980)], confirmed that it is anti-isospectral with the pendular\neigenproblem. Of key importance for both eigenproblems proved to be the\ntopological index $\\kappa$, as it determines the loci of the intersections\n(genuine and avoided) of the eigenenergy surfaces spanned by the dimensionless\ninteraction parameters $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$. It also encapsulates the conditions\nunder which analytic solutions to the two eigenproblems obtain and provides the\nnumber of analytic solutions. At a given $\\kappa$, the anti-isospectrality\noccurs for single states only (i.e., not for doublets), like C-QES holds solely\nfor integer values of $\\kappa$, and only occurs for the lowest eigenvalues of\nthe pendular and Razavy Hamiltonians, with the order of the eigenvalues\nreversed for the latter. For all other states, the pendular and Razavy spectra\nbecome in fact qualitatively different, as higher pendular states appear as\ndoublets whereas all higher Razavy states are singlets.\n", "  We study the excitation spectrum of two-component delta-function interacting\nbosons confined to a single spatial dimension, the Yang-Gaudin Bose gas. We\nshow that there are pronounced finite-size effects in the dispersion relations\nof excitations, perhaps best illustrated by the spinon single particle\ndispersion which exhibits a gap at $2k_F$ and a finite-momentum roton minimum.\nSuch features occur at energies far above the finite volume excitation gap,\nvanish slowly as $1/L$ for fixed spinon number, and can persist to the\nthermodynamic limit at fixed spinon density. Features such as the $2k_F$ gap\nalso persist to multi-particle excitation continua. Our results show that\nexcitations in the finite system can behave in a qualitatively different manner\nto analogous excitations in the thermodynamic limit.\n  The Yang-Gaudin Bose gas is also host to multi-spinon bound states, known as\n$\\Lambda$-strings. We study these excitations both in the thermodynamic limit\nunder the string hypothesis and in finite size systems where string deviations\nare taken into account. In the zero-temperature limit we present a simple\nrelation between the length $n$ $\\Lambda$-string dressed energies\n$\\epsilon_n(\\lambda)$ and the dressed energy $\\epsilon(k)$. We solve the\nYang-Yang-Takahashi equations numerically and compare to the analytical\nsolution obtained under the strong couple expansion, revealing that the length\n$n$ $\\Lambda$-string dressed energy is Lorentzian over a wide range of real\nstring centers $\\lambda$ in the vicinity of $\\lambda = 0$. We then examine the\nfinite size effects present in the dispersion of the two-spinon bound states by\nnumerically solving the Bethe ansatz equations with string deviations.\n", "  We study Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) usually measured in\nhard exclusive processes and encoding information on the three dimensional\npartonic structure of hadrons and their spin decomposition, for non zero\nskewness within the AdS/QCD formalism. To this aim the canonical scheme to\ncalculate GPDs at zero skewness has been properly generalized. Furthermore, we\nshow that the latter quantities, in this non forward regime, are sensitive to\nnon trivial details of the hadronic light front wave function, such as a kind\nof parton correlations usually not accessible in studies of form factors and\nGPDs at zero skewness.\n", "  Monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) is a promising two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterial for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. The large-area\ngrowth of MoS$_2$ has been demonstrated using chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\nin a wide range of deposition temperatures from 600 {\\deg}C to 1000 {\\deg}C.\nHowever, a direct comparison of growth parameters and resulting material\nproperties has not been made so far. Here, we present a systematic experimental\nand theoretical investigation of optical properties of monolayer MoS$_2$ grown\nat different temperatures. Micro-Raman and photoluminescence (PL) studies\nreveal observable inhomogeneities in optical properties of the as-grown single\ncrystalline grains of MoS$_2$. Close examination of the Raman and PL features\nclearly indicate that growth-induced strain is the main source of distinct\noptical properties. We carry out density functional theory calculations to\ndescribe the interaction of growing MoS$_2$ layers with the growth substrate as\nthe origin of strain. Our work explains the variation of band gap energies of\nCVD-grown monolayer MoS$_2$, extracted using PL spectroscopy, as a function of\ndeposition temperature. The methodology has general applicability to model and\npredict the influence of growth conditions on strain in 2D materials.\n", "  We study gadolinium thin films as a model system for ferromagnets with\nnegative thermal expansion. Ultrashort laser pulses heat up the electronic\nsubsystem and we follow the transient strain via ultrafast X-ray diffraction.\nIn terms of a simple Grueneisen approach the strain is decomposed into two\ncontributions proportional to the thermal energy of spin and phonon subsystems.\nOur analysis reveals that upon femtosecond laser excitation phonons and spins\ncan be driven out of thermal equilibrium for several nanoseconds.\n", "  Kepler-444 provides a unique opportunity to probe the atmospheric composition\nand evolution of a compact system of exoplanets smaller than the Earth. Five\nplanets transit this bright K star at close orbital distances, but they are too\nsmall for their putative lower atmosphere to be probed at optical/infrared\nwavelengths. We used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph instrument\nonboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for the signature of the planet's\nupper atmospheres at six independent epochs in the Ly-$\\alpha$ line. We detect\nsignificant flux variations during the transits of both Kepler-444e and f\n(~20%), and also at a time when none of the known planets was transiting\n(~40%). Variability in the transition region and corona of the host star might\nbe the source of these variations. Yet, their amplitude over short time scales\n(~2-3 hours) is surprisingly strong for this old (11.2+-1.0Gyr) and apparently\nquiet main-sequence star. Alternatively, we show that the in-transits\nvariations could be explained by absorption from neutral hydrogen exospheres\ntrailing the two outer planets (Kepler-444e and f). They would have to contain\nsubstantial amounts of water to replenish such hydrogen exospheres, which would\nreveal them as the first confirmed ocean-planets. The out-of-transit\nvariations, however, would require the presence of a yet-undetected Kepler-444g\nat larger orbital distance, casting doubt on the planetary origin scenario.\nUsing HARPS-N observations in the sodium doublet, we derived the properties of\ntwo Interstellar Medium clouds along the line-of-sight toward Kepler-444. This\nallowed us to reconstruct the stellar Ly-$\\alpha$ line profile and to estimate\nthe XUV irradiation from the star, which would still allow for a moderate mass\nloss from the outer planets after 11.2Gyr. Follow-up of the system at XUV\nwavelengths will be required to assess this tantalizing possibility.\n", "  We have developed a data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the global\nsolar corona which uses characteristically-consistent boundary conditions (BCs)\nat the inner boundary. Our global solar corona model can be driven by different\nobservational data including Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) synoptic vector magnetograms together with the\nhorizontal velocity data in the photosphere obtained by the time-distance\nhelioseismology method, and the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetogram data obtained\nby HMI, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI),\nNational Solar Observatory/Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO/GONG) and\nWilcox Solar Observatory (WSO). We implemented our model in the Multi-Scale\nFluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS) - a suite of adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR) codes built upon the Chombo AMR framework developed at the\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We present an overview of our model,\ncharacteristic BCs, and two results we obtained using our model: A benchmark\ntest of relaxation of a dipole field using characteristic BCs, and relaxation\nof an initial PFSS field driven by HMI LOS magnetogram data, and horizontal\nvelocity data obtained by the time-distance helioseismology method using a set\nof non-characteristic BCs.\n", "  We discuss the latest results of numerical simulations following the orbital\ndecay of massive black hole pairs in galaxy mergers. We highlight important\ndifferences between gas-poor and gas-rich hosts, and between orbital evolution\ntaking place at high redshift as opposed to low redshift. Two effects have a\nhuge impact and are rather novel in the context of massive black hole binaries.\nThe first is the increase in characteristic density of galactic nuclei of\nmerger remnants as galaxies are more compact at high redshift due to the way\ndark halo collapse depends on redshift. This leads naturally to hardening\ntimescales due to 3-body encounters that should decrease by two orders of\nmagnitude up to $z=4$. It explains naturally the short binary coalescence\ntimescale, $\\sim 10$ Myr, found in novel cosmological simulations that follow\nbinary evolution from galactic to milliparsec scales. The second one is the\ninhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in massive gas-rich disks at high\nredshift. In the latter star forming clumps 1-2 orders of magnitude more\nmassive than local Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) can scatter massive black\nholes out of the disk plane via gravitational perturbations and direct\nencounters. This renders the character of orbital decay inherently stochastic,\noften increasing orbital decay timescales by as much as a Gyr. At low redshift\na similar regime is present at scales of $1-10$ pc inside Circumnuclear Gas\nDisks (CNDs). In CNDs only massive black holes with masses below $10^7\nM_{\\odot}$ can be significantly perturbed. They decay to sub-pc separations in\nup to $\\sim 10^8$ yr rather than the in just a few million years as in a smooth\nCND. Finally implications for building robust forecasts of LISA event rates are\ndiscussed\n", "  The $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ states observed recently by LHCb experiment\nwere proposed to be either $\\bar{D} \\Sigma_c^*$ or $\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ S-wave\nbound states of spin parity $J^P={\\frac32}^-$. We analyze the decay behaviors\nof such two types of hadronic molecules within the effective Lagrangian\nframework. With branching ratios of ten possible decay channels calculated, it\nis found that the two types of hadronic molecules have distinguishable decay\npatterns. While the $\\bar{D} \\Sigma_c^*$ molecule decays dominantly to\n$\\bar{D}^* \\Lambda_c$ channel with a branching ratio by 2 orders of magnitude\nlarger than to $\\bar{D}\\Lambda_c$, the $\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ molecule decays to\nthese two channels with a difference of less than a factor of 2. Our results\nshow that the total decay width of $P_c(4380)$ as the spin-parity-${\\frac32}^-$\n$\\bar{D} \\Sigma_c^*$ molecule is about a factor of 2 larger than the\ncorresponding value for the $\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ molecule. It suggests that the\nassignment of $\\bar{D} \\Sigma_c^*$ molecule for $P_c(4380)$ is more favorable\nthan the $\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ molecule. In addition, $P_c(4450)$ seems to be a\n$\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ molecule with $J^P={\\frac52}^+$ in our scheme. Based on\nthese partial decay widths of $P_c(4380)$, we estimate the cross sections for\nthe reactions $\\gamma p \\to J/\\psi p $ and $ \\pi p\\to J/\\psi p $ through the\ns-channel $P_c(4380)$ state. The forthcoming $\\gamma p$ experiment at JLAB and\n$\\pi p$ experiment at JPARC should be able to pin down the nature of these\n$P_c$ states.\n", "  We introduce simple generic models of surface dynamics in loop quantum\ngravity (LQG). A quantum surface is defined as a set of elementary patches of\narea glued together. We provide it with an extra structure of locality (nearest\nneighbors), thought of as induced by the whole spin network state defining the\n3d bulk geometry around the quantum surface. Here, we focus on classical\nsurface dynamics, using a spinorial description of surface degrees of freedom.\nWe introduce two classes of dynamics, to be thought as templates for future\ninvestigation of LQG dynamics with in mind the dynamics of quantum black holes.\nThe first defines global dynamics of the closure defect of the surface, with\ntwo basic toy-models, either a dissipative dynamics relaxing towards the\nclosure constraint or a Hamiltonian dynamics precessing the closure defect. The\nsecond class of dynamics describes the isolated regime, when both area and\nclosure defect are conserved throughout the evolution. The surface dynamics is\nimplemented through U(N) transformations and generalizes to a Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian with a local quadratic potential interaction. We briefly discuss\nthe implications of modeling the quantum black hole dynamics by a surface\nBose-Hubbard model.\n", "  The top-down type IIB holographic dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD as\nconstructed in arXiv:0902.1540 involving a fluxed resolved warped deformed\nconifold, its delocalized type IIA SYZ mirror as well as its M-theory uplift\nconstructed in arXiv:1306.4339 - both in the finite gauge coupling\n($g_s\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}1$)/`MQGP' limit of arXiv:1306.4339 - were shown\nexplicitly to possess a local $SU(3)/G_2$-structure in arXiv:1507.02692\nGlueball spectroscopy at finite gauge coupling has thus far been missing in the\nliterature. In this paper, we fill this gap by calculating the masses of the\n$0^{++}, 0^{-+},0^{--}, 1^{++}, 2^{++}$ (`glueball') states (which correspond\nto fluctuations in the dilaton or complexified two-forms or appropriate metric\ncomponents) in the aforementioned backgrounds of $G$-structure in the `MQGP'\nlimit of arXiv:1306.4339, using WKB quantization conditions on one hand and\nimposing Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at an IR cut-off/horizon radius\n$r_h$ on the solutions to the equations of motion on the other. We also discuss\n$r_h=0$-limits of all calculations; in this context we also calculate the\n$0^{++}, 0^{--},1^{++}, 2^{++}$ glueball masses up to NLO in $N$ and find a\n$\\frac{g_sM^2}{N}(g_sN_f)$-suppression similar to and further validating a\nsimilar semi-universality of NLO corrections to transport coefficients,\nobserved in arXiv:1606.04949.\n", "  We present a search of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the Northern\n$\\textit{Fermi}$ Bubble region using data collected with the High Altitude\nWater Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory. The size of the data set is 290\ndays. No significant excess is observed in the Northern $\\textit{Fermi}$ Bubble\nregion, hence upper limits above $1\\,\\text{TeV}$ are calculated. The upper\nlimits are between $3\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{GeV}\\, \\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\n\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{sr}^{-1}$ and $4\\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\text{GeV}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{sr}^{-1}$. The upper\nlimits disfavor a proton injection spectrum that extends beyond\n$100\\,\\text{TeV}$ without being suppressed. They also disfavor a hadronic\ninjection spectrum derived from neutrino measurements.\n", "  A generally covariant version of Erik Verlinde's emergent gravity model is\nproposed. The Lagrangian constructed here allows an improved interpretation of\nthe underlying mechanism. It suggests that de-Sitter space is filled with a\nvector-field that couples to baryonic matter and, by dragging on it, creates an\neffect similar to dark matter. We solve the covariant equation of motion in the\nbackground of a Schwarzschild space-time and obtain correction terms to the\nnon-covariant expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vector field can\nalso mimic dark energy.\n", "  For many profilometry techniques, phase unwrapping is one of the most\nchallenging process. In order to sidestep the phase unwrapping process,\nPerciante et. al [Appl Opt 2015; 54(10):3018-23] proposed a wrapping-free\nmethod based on the direct integration of the spatial derivatives of the\npatterns to retrieve the phase. But it is only applicable for the case of the\nphase continuity for the tested object, which means it may fail to handle\nfringe patterns containing complicated singularities, such as noise, shadow,\nshears and surface discontinuity. In view of this problems, a robust\nwrapping-free phase retrieval method is proposed in this paper, which is based\non combined Perciante's method and weighted least-squares method. Two partial\nderivatives of the desired phase is obtained from the fringe patterns,\nmeanwhile the carrier is eliminated using direct phase difference method. The\nphase singularities are determined using derivative variance correlation map\n(DVCM), and the weighting coefficient is obtained from the binary mask of the\nreverse DVCM. Simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the validity\nof the proposed method. Results are analyzed and compared with those of\nPerciante's method, demonstrating that the proposed method can be available for\nmeasuring objects with some kinds of singularities sources.\n", "  In two recent publications ( Int. J. Quant. Chem. 114, 1645 (2014) and Molec.\nPhys. 114, 227 (2016)) it was shown that the Born -Hwang (BH) treatment of a\nmolecular system perturbed by an external field yields a set of decoupled\nvectorial Wave Equations, just like in Electromagnetism. This finding led us to\ndeclare on the existence of a new type of Fields, which were termed Molecular\nFields. The fact that such fields exist implies that at the vicinity of conical\nintersections exist a mechanism that transforms a passing-by electric beam into\na field which differs from the original electric field. This situation is\nreminiscent of what is encountered in astronomy where Black Holes formed by\nmassive stars may affect the nature of a near-by beam of light. Thus if the\nNonAdiabatic-Coupling-Terms (NACT) with their singular points may affect the\nnature of such a beam (see the above two publications) then it would be\ninteresting to know to what extend NACTs (and consequently also the BH\nequation) will be affected by the special theory of relativity as introduced by\nDirac. Indeed while applying the Dirac approach we derived the relativistic\naffected NACTs as well as the corresponding BH equation.\n", "  The four-qubit states $\\lvert\\chi^{ij}\\rangle$, exhibiting genuinely\nmulti-partite entanglement have been shown to have many interesting properties\nand have been suggested for novel applications in quantum information\nprocessing. In this work we propose a simple quantum circuit and its\ncorresponding optical embodiment with which to prepare photon pairs in the\n$\\lvert\\chi^{ij}\\rangle$ states. Our approach uses hyper-entangled photon\npairs, produced by the type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)\nprocess in two contiguous nonlinear crystals, together with a set of simple\nlinear-optical transformations. Our photon pairs are maximally hyper-entangled\nin both their polarisation and orbital angular momentum (OAM). After one of\nthese daughter photons passes through our optical setup, we obtain photon pairs\nin the hyper-entangled state $\\lvert\\chi^{00}\\rangle$, and the\n$\\lvert\\chi^{ij}\\rangle$ states can be achieved by further simple\ntransformations.\n", "  We study the spectrophotometric properties of a highly magnified (\\mu~40-70)\npair of stellar systems identified at z=3.2222 behind the Hubble Frontier Field\ngalaxy cluster MACS~J0416. Five multiple images (out of six) have been\nspectroscopically confirmed by means of VLT/MUSE and VLT/X-Shooter\nobservations. Each image includes two faint (m_uv~30.6), young (<100 Myr),\nlow-mass (<10^7 Msun), low-metallicity (12+Log(O/H)~7.7, or 1/10 solar) and\ncompact (30 pc effective radius) stellar systems separated by ~300pc, after\ncorrecting for lensing amplification. We measured several rest-frame\nultraviolet and optical narrow (\\sigma_v <~ 25 km/s) high-ionization lines.\nThese features may be the signature of very hot (T>50000 K) stars within dense\nstellar clusters, whose dynamical mass is likely dominated by the stellar\ncomponent. Remarkably, the ultraviolet metal lines are not accompanied by Lya\nemission (e.g., CIV / Lya > 15), despite the fact that the Lya line flux is\nexpected to be 150 times brighter (inferred from the Hbeta flux). A\nspatially-offset, strongly-magnified (\\mu>50) Lya emission with a spatial\nextent <~7.6 kpc^2 is instead identified 2 kpc away from the system. The origin\nof such a faint emission can be the result of fluorescent Lya induced by a\ntransverse leakage of ionizing radiation emerging from the stellar systems\nand/or can be associated to an underlying and barely detected object (with m_uv\n> 34 de-lensed). This is the first confirmed metal-line emitter at such\nlow-luminosity and redshift without Lya emission, suggesting that, at least in\nsome cases, a non-uniform covering factor of the neutral gas might hamper the\nLya detection.\n", "  Ballistic phonon effects, arising on length scales comparable to the\nmean-free-path, result in non-diffusive heat flow and alter the thermal\nproperties of materials. Simple theoretical models that accurately capture\nnon-diffusive transport physics are valuable for experimental analysis,\ntechnology design, and providing physical insight. In this work, we utilize and\nextend the McKelvey-Shockley (McK-S) flux method, a simple and accurate\nframework, to investigate ballistic effects in transient phonon transport\nsubmitted to a spatially sinusoidal heating profile, simulating a transient\nthermal grating. We begin by extending a previous McK-S formulation to include\ninelastic scattering, then obtain an analytical solution in the single phonon\nenergy case (gray approximation), and after show how this approach can readily\nsupport a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution. The results\nagree with experimental data and compare very well to solutions of the phonon\nBoltzmann transport equation in the diffusive and weakly quasi-ballistic\ntransport regimes. We discuss the role of ballistic and non-equilibrium\nphysics, and show that inelastic scattering is key to retrieving the heat\nequation solution in the diffusive limit. Overall the McK-S flux method, which\ntakes the form of a diffusion-like equation, proves to be a simple and accurate\nframework that is applicable from the ballistic to diffusive transport regime.\n", "  We present a significantly different reflection process from an optically\nthin flat metallic or dielectric layer and propose a strikingly simple method\nto form approximately unipolar half-cycle optical pulses via reflection of a\nsingle-cycle optical pulse. Unipolar pulses in reflection arise due to\nspecifics of effectively one-dimensional pulse propagation. Namely, we show\nthat in considered system the field emitted by a flat medium layer is\nproportional to the velocity of oscillating medium charges instead of their\nacceleration as it is usually the case. When the single-cycle pulse interacts\nwith linear optical medium, the oscillation velocity of medium charges can be\nthen forced to keep constant sign throughout the pulse duration. Our results\nessentially differ from the direct mirror reflection and suggest a possibility\nof unusual transformations of the few-cycle light pulses in linear optical\nsystems.\n", "  The paper demonstrates that double unit-cell asymmetry in periodic leaky-wave\nantennas (P-LWAs), i.e. asymmetry with respect to both the longitudinal and\ntransversal axes of the structure -- or longitudinal asymmetry (LA) and\ntransversal asymmetry (TA) -- allows for the simultaneous broadside radiation\nof two orthogonal modes excited at the two ports of the antenna. This means\nthat the antenna may simultaneously support two orthogonal channels, which\nrepresents an interesting polarization diversity characteristics for wireless\ncommunications. The double asymmetric (DA) unit cell combines a circularly\npolarized LA unit cell and a coupled mode TA unit cell, where the former\nprovides equal radiation in the series and shunt modes while the latter\nseparates these two modes in terms of their excitation ports. It is also shown\nthat the degree of TA in the DA unit cell controls the cross-polarization\ndiscrimination level. The DA P-LWA concept is illustrated by two examples, a\nseries-fed line-connected patch (SF-LCP) P-LWA and a series-fed\ncapacitively-coupled patch (SF-CCP) P-LWA, via full-wave simulation and also\nexperiment for the SF-LCP P-LWA case.\n", "  The integration of different two-dimensional materials within a multilayer\nvan der Waals (vdW) heterostructure offers a promising technology for realizing\nhigh performance opto-electronic devices such as photodetectors and light\nsources1-3. Transition metal dichalcogenides, e.g. MoS2 and WSe2, have been\nemployed as the optically-active layer in recently developed heterojunctions.\nHowever, MoS2 and WSe2 become direct band gap semiconductors only in mono- or\nbilayer form4,5. In contrast, the metal monochalcogenides InSe and GaSe retain\na direct bandgap over a wide range of layer thicknesses from bulk crystals down\nto exfoliated flakes only a few atomic monolayers thick6,7. Here we report on\nvdW heterojunction diodes based on InSe and GaSe: the type II band alignment\nbetween the two materials and their distinctive spectral response, combined\nwith the low electrical resistance of transparent graphene electrodes, enable\neffective separation and extraction of photoexcited carriers from the\nheterostructure even when no external voltage is applied. Our devices are fast\n(< 10 {\\mu}s), self-driven photodetectors with multicolor photoresponse ranging\nfrom the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and have the potential to accelerate\nthe exploitation of two-dimensional vdW crystals by creating new routes to\nminiaturized optoelectronics beyond present technologies.\n", "  We present deep ALMA CO(5-4) observations of a main sequence, clumpy galaxy\nat z=1.5 in the HUDF. Thanks to the ~0.5\" resolution of the ALMA data, we can\nlink stellar population properties to the CO(5-4) emission on scales of a few\nkpc. We detect strong CO(5-4) emission from the nuclear region of the galaxy,\nconsistent with the observed $L_{\\rm IR}$-$L^{\\prime}_{\\rm CO(5-4)}$\ncorrelation and indicating on-going nuclear star formation. The CO(5-4) gas\ncomponent appears more concentrated than other star formation tracers or the\ndust distribution in this galaxy. We discuss possible implications of this\ndifference in terms of star formation efficiency and mass build-up at the\ngalaxy centre. Conversely, we do not detect any CO(5-4) emission from the\nUV-bright clumps. This might imply that clumps have a high star formation\nefficiency (although they do not display unusually high specific star formation\nrates) and are not entirely gas dominated, with gas fractions no larger than\nthat of their host galaxy (~50%). Stellar feedback and disk instability torques\nfunnelling gas towards the galaxy centre could contribute to the relatively low\ngas content. Alternatively, clumps could fall in a more standard star formation\nefficiency regime if their actual star-formation rates are lower than generally\nassumed. We find that clump star-formation rates derived with several\ndifferent, plausible methods can vary by up to an order of magnitude. The\nlowest estimates would be compatible with a CO(5-4) non-detection even for\nmain-sequence like values of star formation efficiency and gas content.\n", "  We compute electromagnetic fields created by a relativistic charged spin-half\nparticle in empty space at distances comparable to the particle Compton\nwavelength. The particle is described as a wave packet evolving according to\nthe Dirac equation. It produces the electromagnetic field that is essentially\ndifferent from the Coulomb field due to the quantum diffusion effect.\n", "  For an exact quantitative description of spectral properties in the theory of\nsynchrotron radiation, the concept of effective spectral width is introduced.\nIn the classical theory, numeric calculations of effective spectral width\n(using an effective width not exceeding 100 harmonics) for polarization\ncomponents of synchrotron radiation are carried out. The dependence of the\neffective spectral width and initial harmonic on the energy of a radiating\nparticle is established.\n", "  Ultra-cold atomic gases provide new chance to study the universal critical\nbehavior of phase transition. We study theoretically the matter wave\ninterference for ultra-cold Bose gases in the critical regime. We demonstrate\nthat the interference in the momentum distribution can be used to extract the\ncorrelation in the Bose gas. A simple relation between the interference\nvisibility and the correlation length is found and used to interpret the\npioneering experiment about the critical behavior of dilute Bose gases [Science\n{\\bf 315}, 1556 (2007)]. Our theory paves the way to experimentally study\nvarious types of ultra-cold atomic gases with the means of matter wave\ninterference.\n", "  Thanks to oscillation experiments it is now an established fact that\nneutrinos are massive particles. Yet, the assessment of neutrinos absolute mass\nscale is still an outstanding challenge in particle physics and cosmology as\noscillation experiments are sensitive only to the squared mass differences of\nthe three neutrino mass eigenstates. The mass hierarchy is not the only missing\npiece in the puzzle. Theories of neutrino mass generation call into play\nMajorana neutrinos and there are experimental observations pointing toward the\nexistence of sterile neutrinos in addition to the three weakly interacting\nones. Three experimental approaches are currently pursued: an indirect neutrino\nmass determination via cosmological observables, the search for neutrinoless\ndouble $\\beta$-decay, and a direct measurement based on the kinematics of\nsingle $\\beta$ or electron capture decays.\n  Bolometers and calorimeters are low temperature detectors used in many\napplications, such as astrophysics, fast spectroscopy and particle physics. In\nparticular, sensitive calorimeters play an important role in the neutrino mass\nmeasurement and in the search for the neutrinoless double $\\beta$-decay. There\nhas been great technical progress on low temperature detectors since they were\nproposed for neutrino physics experiments in 1984. This general detector\nparadigm can be implemented in devices as small as a micrometer for sub eV\nradiation or as large as 1 kg for MeV scale particles. Today this technique\noffers the high energy resolution and scalability required for leading edges\nand competitive experiments addressing the still open questions in neutrino\nphysics.\n", "  In exotic superconductors including high-$T_c$ copper-oxides, the\ninteractions mediating electron Cooper-pairing are widely considered to have a\nmagnetic rather than the conventional electron-phonon origin. Interest in such\nexotic pairing was initiated by the 1979 discovery of heavy-fermion\nsuperconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, which exhibits strong antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations. A hallmark of unconventional pairing by anisotropic repulsive\ninteractions is that the superconducting energy gap changes sign as a function\nof the electron momentum, often leading to nodes where the gap goes to zero.\nHere, we report low-temperature specific heat, thermal conductivity and\nmagnetic penetration depth measurements in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, demonstrating the\nabsence of gap nodes at any point on the Fermi surface. Moreover,\nelectron-irradiation experiments reveal that the superconductivity survives\neven when the electron mean free path becomes substantially shorter than the\nsuperconducting coherence length. This indicates that superconductivity is\nrobust against impurities, implying that there is no sign change in the gap\nfunction. These results show that, contrary to long-standing belief, heavy\nelectrons with extremely strong Coulomb repulsions can condense into a\nfully-gapped s-wave superconducting state, which has an on-site attractive\npairing interaction.\n", "  Bars in galaxies may develop through a global instability or due to an\ninteraction with another system. We study bar formation in disky dwarf galaxies\norbiting a Milky Way-like galaxy. We employ $N$-body simulations to study the\nimpact of initial orbital parameters: the size of the dwarf galaxy orbit and\nthe inclination of its disc with respect to the orbital plane. In all cases a\nbar develops in the center of the dwarf during the first pericenter on its\norbit around the host. Between subsequent pericenter passages the bars are\nstable, but at the pericenters they are usually weakened and shortened. The\ninitial properties and details of the further evolution of the bars depend\nheavily on the orbital configuration. We find that for the exactly prograde\norientation, the strongest bar is formed for the intermediate-size orbit. On\nthe tighter orbit, the disc is too disturbed and stripped to form a strong bar.\nOn the wider orbit, the tidal interaction is too weak. The dependence on the\ndisc inclination is such that weaker bars form in more inclined discs. The bars\nexperience either a very weak buckling or none at all. We do not observe any\nsecular evolution, possibly because the dwarfs are perturbed at each pericenter\npassage. The rotation speed of the bars can be classified as slow\n($R_\\mathrm{CR}/l_\\mathrm{bar}\\sim2-3$). We attribute this to the loss of a\nsignificant fraction of the disc's rotation during the encounter with the host\ngalaxy.\n", "  We study galaxy mass assembly and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at\nhigh-redshift (z$\\gt$4), by comparing data from multiwavelength surveys with\npredictions from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model. GAEA\nimplements a stellar feedback scheme partially based on cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations, that features strong stellar driven outflows and\nmass-dependent timescale for the re-accretion of ejected gas. In previous work,\nwe have shown that this scheme is able to correctly reproduce the evolution of\nthe galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) up to $z\\sim3$. We contrast model\npredictions with both rest-frame Ultra-Violet (UV) and optical luminosity\nfunctions (LF), which are mostly sensible to the SFR and stellar mass,\nrespectively. We show that GAEA is able to reproduce the shape and redshift\nevolution of both sets of LFs. We study the impact of dust on the predicted LFs\nand we find that the required level of dust attenuation is in qualitative\nagreement with recent estimates based on the UV continuum slope. The\nconsistency between data and model predictions holds for the redshift evolution\nof the physical quantities well beyond the redshift range considered for the\ncalibration of the original model. In particular, we show that GAEA is able to\nrecover the evolution of the GSMF up to z$\\sim$7 and the cosmic SFR density up\nto z$\\sim$10.\n", "  Disruptive collisions have been regarded as an important process for planet\nformation, while non-disruptive, small-scale collisions (hereafter called\nerosive collisions) have been underestimated or neglected by many studies.\nHowever, recent studies have suggested that erosive collisions are also\nimportant to the growth of planets, because they are much more frequent than\ndisruptive collisions. Although the thresholds of the specific impact energy\nfor disruptive collisions (Q_RD^*) have been investigated well, there is no\nreliable model for erosive collisions. In this study, we systematically carried\nout impact simulations of gravity-dominated planetesimals for a wide range of\nspecific impact energy (Q_R) from disruptive collisions (Q_R ~ Q_RD^*) to\nerosive ones (Q_R << Q_RD^*) using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method.\nWe found that the ejected mass normalized by the total mass (M_ej/M_tot)\ndepends on the numerical resolution, the target radius (R_tar) and the impact\nvelocity (v_imp), as well as on Q_R, but that it can be nicely scaled by Q_RD^*\nfor the parameter ranges investigated (R_tar = 30-300 km, v_imp = 2-5 km/s).\nThis means that M_ej/M_tot depends only on Q_R/Q_RD^* in these parameter\nranges. We confirmed that the collision outcomes for much less erosive\ncollisions (Q_R < 0.01 Q_RD^*) converge to the results of an impact onto a\nplanar target for various impact angles and that M_ej/M_tot = C * QR/QRD*\nholds. For disruptive collisions (Q_R ~ Q_RD^*), the curvature of the target\nhas a significant effect on Mej/Mtot. We also examined the angle-averaged value\nof M_ej/M_tot and found that the numerically obtained relation between\nangle-averaged M_ej/M_tot and Q_R/Q_RD^* is very similar to the cases for\n45-degree impacts. We proposed a new erosion model based on our numerical\nsimulations for future research on planet formation with collisional erosion.\n", "  This work investigates the macroscopic thermomechanical behavior of lunar\nboulders by modeling their response to diurnal thermal forcing. Our results\nreveal a bimodal, spatiotemporally-complex stress response. During sunrise,\nstresses occur in the boulders' interiors that are associated with large-scale\ntemperature gradients developed due to overnight cooling. During sunset,\nstresses occur at the boulders' exteriors due to the cooling and contraction of\nthe surface. Both kinds of stresses are on the order of 10 MPa in 1 m boulders\nand decrease for smaller diameters, suggesting that larger boulders break down\nmore quickly. Boulders <30 cm exhibit a weak response to thermal forcing,\nsuggesting a threshold below which crack propagation may not occur. Boulders of\nany size buried by regolith are shielded from thermal breakdown. As boulders\nincrease in size (>1 m), stresses increase to several 10s of MPa as the\nbehavior of their surfaces approaches that of an infinite halfspace. As the\nthermal wave loses contact with the boulder interior, stresses become limited\nto the near-surface. This suggests that the survival time of a boulder is not\nonly controlled by the amplitude of induced stress, but also by its diameter as\ncompared to the diurnal skin depth. While stresses on the order of 10 MPa are\nenough to drive crack propagation in terrestrial environments, crack\npropagation rates in vacuum are not well constrained. We explore the\nrelationship between boulder size, stress, and the direction of crack\npropagation, and discuss the implications for the relative breakdown rates and\nestimated lifetimes of boulders on airless body surfaces.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength observations of the unusual nova V1535 Sco\nthroughout its outburst in 2015. Early radio observations were consistent with\nsynchrotron emission, and early X-ray observations revealed the presence of\nhigh-energy (>1 keV) photons. These indicated that strong shocks were present\nduring the first ~2 weeks of the nova's evolution. The radio spectral energy\ndistribution was consistent with thermal emission from week 2 to week 6.\nStarting in week 7, the radio emission again showed evidence of synchrotron\nemission and there was an increase in X-ray emission, indicating a second shock\nevent. The optical spectra show evidence for at least two separate outflows,\nwith the faster outflow possibly having a bipolar morphology. The optical and\nnear infrared light curves and the X-ray measurements of the hydrogen column\ndensity indicated that the companion star is likely a K giant.\n", "  We considered the systematics of $\\alpha$-decay (AD) half-life (HL) of\nsuper-heavy nuclei versus the decay energy and the total $\\alpha$-kinetic\nenergy. We calculated the HL using the experimental Q_{$\\alpha$} values. The\ncomputed half-lives are compared with the experimental data and also with the\nexisting empirical estimates and are found in good agreement. Also, we obtained\n$\\alpha$-preformation factors from the ratio between theoretical and\nexperimental results for some super heavy nuclei SHN and evaluated the standard\ndeviation. The results indicate the acceptability of the approach.\n", "  We performed a statistical analysis of the astrometric errors for the major\nasteroid surveys. We analyzed the astrometric residuals as a function of\nobservation epoch, observed brightness and rate of motion, finding that\nastrometric errors are larger for faint observations and some stations improved\ntheir astrometric quality over time. Based on this statistical analysis we\ndevelop a new weighting scheme to be used when performing asteroid orbit\ndetermination. The proposed weights result in ephemeris predictions that can be\nconservative by a factor as large as 1.5. However, the new scheme is more\nrobust with respect to outliers and better handles faint detections.\n", "  Continuous gravitational waves signals, emitted by asymmetric spinning\nneutron stars, are among the main targets of current detectors like Advanced\nLIGO and Virgo. In the case of sources, like pulsars, which rotational\nparameters are measured through electromagnetic observations, typical searches\nassume that the gravitational wave frequency is at a given known fixed ratio\nwith respect to the star rotational frequency. For instance, for a neutron star\nrotating around one of its principal axis of inertia the gravitational signal\nfrequency would be exactly two times the rotational frequency of the star. It\nis possible, however, that this assumption is wrong. This is why search\nalgorithms able to take into account a possible small mismatch between the\ngravitational waves frequency and the frequency inferred from electromagnetic\nobservations have been developed. In this paper we present an improved pipeline\nto perform such narrow-band searches for continuous gravitational waves from\nneutron stars, about three orders of magnitude faster than previous\nimplementations. The algorithm that we have developed is based on the {\\it\n5-vectors} framework and is able to perform a fully coherent search over a\nfrequency band of width $\\mathcal{O}$(Hertz) and for hundreds of spin-down\nvalues running a few hours on a standard workstation. This new algorithm opens\nthe possibility of long coherence time searches for objects which rotational\nparameters are highly uncertain.\n", "  The disc instability model (DIM) has been very successful in explaining the\ndwarf nova outbursts observed in cataclysmic variables. When, as in\nintermediate polars (IP), the accreting white dwarf is magnetized, the disc is\ntruncated at the magnetospheric radius, but for mass-transfer rates\ncorresponding to the thermal-viscous instability such systems should still\nexhibit dwarf-nova outbursts. Yet, the majority of intermediate polars in which\nthe magnetic field is not large enough to completely disrupt the accretion\ndisc, seem to be stable, and the rare observed outbursts, in particular in\nsystems with long orbital periods, are much shorter than normal dwarf-nova\noutbursts. We investigate the predictions of the disc instability model for\nintermediate polars in order to determine which of the observed properties of\nthese systems can be explained by the DIM. We use our numerical code for the\ntime evolution of accretion discs, modified to include the effects of the\nmagnetic field, with constant or variable mass transfer from the secondary\nstar. We show that intermediate polars have mass transfer low enough and\nmagnetic fields large enough to keep the accretion disc stable on the cold\nequilibrium branch. We show that the infrequent and short outbursts observed in\nlong period systems, such as e.g., TV Col, cannot be attributed to the\nthermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, but instead have to be\ntriggered by an enhanced mass-transfer from the secondary, or, more likely, by\nsome instability coupling the white dwarf magnetic field with that generated by\nthe magnetorotational instability operating in the accretion disc. Longer\noutbursts (a few days) could result from the disc instability.\n", "  Magnetic droplets obtained by induced phase separation in a magnetic colloid\nshow a large variety of shapes when exposed to an external field. However, the\ndescription of shapes is often limited. Here we formulate an algorithm based on\nthree dimensional boundary-integral equations for strongly magnetic droplets in\na high-frequency rotating magnetic field, allowing us to find their figures of\nequilibrium in three dimensions. The algorithm is justified by a series of\ncomparisons with known analytical results. We compare the calculated\nequilibrium shapes with experimental observations and find a good agreement.\nThe main features of these observations are the oblate-prolate transition, the\nflattening of prolate shapes with the increase of magnetic field strength and\nthe formation of star-fish like equilibrium shapes. We show both numerically\nand in experiments that the magnetic droplet behaviour may be described with a\ntri-axial ellipsoid approximation. Directions for further research are\nmentioned, including the dipolar interaction contribution to the surface\ntension of the magnetic droplets, account for the large viscosity contrast\nbetween the magnetic droplet and the surrounding fluid.\n", "  In this paper we apply an extended Landau-Lifschitz equation, as introduced\nby Ba\\v{n}as et al. for the simulation of heat-assisted magnetic recording.\nThis equation has similarities with the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation. The\nBa\\v{n}as equation is supposed to be used in a continuum setting with sub-grain\ndiscretization by the finite-element method. Thus, local geometric features and\nnonuniform magnetic states during switching are taken into account. We\nimplement the Ba\\v{n}as model and test its capability for predicting the\nrecording performance in a realistic recording scenario. By performing\nrecording simulations on 100 media slabs with randomized granular structure and\nconsecutive read back calculation, the write position shift and transition\njitter for bit lengths of 10nm, 12nm, and 20nm are calculated.\n", "  It is known that the equilibrium properties of open classical systems that\nare strongly coupled to a heat bath are described by a set of thermodynamic\npotentials related to the system's Hamiltonian of mean force. By adapting this\nframework to a more general class of non-equilibrium states, we show that the\nequilibrium properties of the bath can be well-defined, even when the system is\narbitrarily far from equilibrium and correlated with the bath. These states,\nwhich retain a notion of temperature, take the form of conditional equilibrium\ndistributions. For out-of-equilibrium processes we show that the average\nentropy production quantifies the extent to which the system-bath state is\ndriven away from the conditional equilibrium distribution. In addition, we show\nthat the stochastic entropy production satisfies a generalised Crooks relation\nand can be used to quantify time-asymmetry of correlated non-equilibrium\nprocesses. These results naturally extend the familiar properties of entropy\nproduction in weakly-coupled systems to the strong coupling regime.\nExperimental measurements of the entropy production at strong coupling could be\npursued using optomechanics or trapped ion systems, which allow strong coupling\nto be engineered.\n", "  The class of Double Period Variables (DPVs) consists of close interacting\nbinaries, with a characteristic long period that is an order of magnitude\nlonger than the corresponding orbital period, many of them with a\ncharacteristic ratio of about 3.5x10^1. We consider here the possibility that\nthe accretion flow is modulated as a result of a magnetic dynamo cycle. Due to\nthe short binary separations, we expect the rotation of the donor star to be\nsynchronized with the rotation of the binary due to tidal locking. We here\npresent a model to estimate the dynamo number and the resulting relation\nbetween the activity cycle length and the orbital period, as well as an\nestimate for the modulation of the mass transfer rate. The latter is based on\nApplegate's scenario, implying cyclic changes in the radius of the donor star\nand thus in the mass transfer rate as a result of magnetic activity. Our model\nis applied to a sample of 17 systems with known physical parameters, 10 also\nwith known orbital periods. In spite of the uncertainties of our simplified\nframework, the results show a reasonable agreement, indicating that a dynamo\ninterpretation is potentially feasible. At the same time, we note that the\norbital period variations resulting from Applegate's model are sufficiently\nsmall to be consistent with the data. We conclude that both larger samples with\nknown physical parameters as well as potential direct probes of the magnetism\nof the donor star, including cold spots as well as polarization, will be\nvaluable to further constrain the nature of these systems.\n", "  We compute next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the top-bottom\ninterference contribution to H+j production at the LHC. To achieve this, we\ncombine the recent computation of the two-loop amplitudes for gg -> Hg and qg\n-> Hq, performed in the approximation of a small b-quark mass, and the\nnumerical calculation of the squared one-loop amplitudes for gg -> Hgg and qg\n-> Hqg performed within OpenLoops. We find that QCD corrections to the\ninterference are large and similar to the QCD corrections to the top-mediated\nHiggs production cross section. We also observe a significant reduction in the\nmass-renormalization scheme uncertainty, once the NLO QCD prediction for the\ninterference is employed.\n", "  In comparison to the radio and sub-millimetric domains, imaging with optical\ninterferometry is still in its infancy. Due to the limited number of telescopes\nin existing arrays, image generation is a demanding process that relies on\ntime-consuming reconfiguration of the interferometer array and super-synthesis.\nUsing single mode optical fibres for the coherent transport of light from the\ncollecting telescopes to the focal plane, a new generation of interferometers\noptimized for imaging can be designed. To support this claim, we report on the\nsuccessful completion of the `OHANA Iki project: an end-to-end, on-sky\ndemonstration of a two-telescope interferometer, built around near-infrared\nsingle mode fibres, carried out as part of the `OHANA project. Having\ndemonstrated that coherent transport by single-mode fibres is feasible, we\nexplore the concepts, performances, and limitations of a new imaging facility\nwith single mode fibres at its heart: Agile Guided Interferometer for\nLongbaseline Imaging Synthesis (AGILIS). AGILIS has the potential of becoming a\nnext generation facility or a precursor to a much larger project like the\nPlanet Formation Imager (PFI).\n", "  By employing the method of differential equations, we compute the various\ntypes of two-loop master integrals involved in CP-even heavy quarkonium\nexclusive production and decays. All the integrals presented in this paper can\nbe casted into canonical forms and expressed in terms of Goncharov\npolylogarithms and Harmonic polylogarithms. These master integrals are\nfrequently used in the calculation of NNLO corrections of the heavy quarkonium\nproduction processes, as $\\gamma^*\\gamma\\rightarrow Q\\bar{Q}$,\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\gamma+ Q\\bar{Q}$, and $H/Z^0\\rightarrow \\gamma+ Q\\bar{Q}$,\nand decay processes. They are also applicable in the calculation of NNLO\ncorrections to CP-even quarkonium inclusive production and decay processes.\n", "  We address the question of perturbative consistency in the scalar fishnet\nmodels presented by Caetano, Gurdogan and Kazakov\\cite{Gurdogan:2015csr,\nCaetano:2016ydc}. We argue that their 3-dimensional $\\phi^{6}$ fishnet model\nbecomes perturbatively stable under renormalization in the large $N$ limit, in\ncontrast to what happens in their 4-dimensional $\\phi^{4}$ fishnet model, in\nwhich double trace terms are known to be generated by the RG flow. We point out\nthat there is a direct way to modify this second theory that protects it from\nsuch corrections. Additionally, we observe that the 6-dimensional $\\phi^{3}$\nLagrangian that spans an hexagonal integrable scalar fishnet is consistent at\nthe perturbative level as well. The nontriviality and simplicity of this last\nmodel is illustrated by computing the anomalous dimensions of its\n$\\text{tr}\\phi_i \\phi_j$ operators to all perturbative orders.\n", "  We perform quantum calculations of fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields\nin $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The analysis is based on the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem. We find that in the quantum picture the field\nfluctuations are very small. They turn out to be much smaller than the\npredictions of the classical Monte-Carlo simulation with the Woods-Saxon\nnuclear density.\n", "  The coherent high-fidelity generation of nuclear spins in long-lived singlet\nstates which may find application as quantum memory or sensor represents a\nconsiderable experimental challenge. Here we propose a dissipative scheme that\nachieves the preparation of pairs of nuclear spins in long-lived singlet states\nby a protocol that combines the interaction between the nuclei and a\nperiodically reset electron spin of an NV center with local rf-control of the\nnuclear spins. The final state of this protocol is independent of the initial\npreparation of the nuclei, is robust to external field fluctuations and can be\noperated at room temperature. We show that a high fidelity singlet pair of a\n13C dimer in a nuclear bath in diamond can be generated under realistic\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  We investigate the stellar mass and baryonic mass Tully-Fisher relations\n(TFRs) of massive star-forming disk galaxies at redshift z~2.3 and z~0.9 as\npart of the KMOS^3D integral field spectroscopy survey. Our spatially resolved\ndata allow reliable modelling of individual galaxies, including the effect of\npressure support on the inferred gravitational potential. At fixed circular\nvelocity, we find higher baryonic masses and similar stellar masses at z~2.3 as\ncompared to z~0.9. Together with the decreasing gas-to-stellar mass ratios with\ndecreasing redshift, this implies that the contribution of dark matter to the\ndynamical mass at the galaxy scale increases towards lower redshift. A\ncomparison to local relations reveals a negative evolution of the stellar and\nbaryonic TFR zero-points from z=0 to z~0.9, no evolution of the stellar TFR\nzero-point from z~0.9 to z~2.3, and a positive evolution of the baryonic TFR\nzero-point from z~0.9 to z~2.3. We discuss a toy model of disk galaxy evolution\nto explain the observed, non-monotonic TFR evolution, taking into account the\nempirically motivated redshift dependencies of galactic gas fractions, and of\nthe relative amount of baryons to dark matter on galaxy and halo scales.\n", "  The effective Mott gap measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in the\nlightly doped Mott insulator $(\\rm{Sr}_{1 -x}\\rm{La}_x)_2\\rm{IrO}_4$ differs\ngreatly from values reported by photoemission and optical experiments. Here, we\nshow that this is a consequence of the poor electronic screening of the\ntip-induced electric field in this material. Such effects are well known from\nSTM experiments on semiconductors, and go under the name of tip-induced band\nbending (TIBB). We show that this phenomenon also exists in the lightly doped\nMott insulator $(\\rm{Sr}_{1 -x}\\rm{La}_x)_2\\rm{IrO}_4$ and that, at doping\nconcentrations of $x\\leq 4 \\%$, it causes the measured energy gap in the sample\ndensity of states to be bigger than the one measured with other techniques. We\ndevelop a model able to retrieve the intrinsic energy gap leading to a value\nwhich is in rough agreement with other experiments, bridging the apparent\ncontradiction. At doping $x \\approx 5 \\%$ we further observe circular features\nin the conductance layers that point to the emergence of a significant density\nof free carriers in this doping range, and to the presence of a small\nconcentration of donor atoms. We illustrate the importance of considering the\npresence of TIBB when doing STM experiments on correlated-electron systems and\ndiscuss the similarities and differences between STM measurements on\nsemiconductors and lightly doped Mott insulators.\n", "  We present new determinations of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) at\n$z=0-10$ that match the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, the\nSFR$-M_*$ relation,and the cosmic star formation rate. We utilize a compilation\nof 40 observational studies from the literature and correct them for potential\nbiases. Using our robust determinations of halo mass assembly and the SHMR, we\ninfer star formation histories, merger rates, and structural properties for\naverage galaxies, combining star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our main\nfindings: (1) The halo mass $M_{50}$ above which 50\\% of galaxies are quenched\ncoincides with sSFR/sMAR$\\sim1$, where sMAR is the specific halo mass accretion\nrate. (2) $M_{50}$ increases with redshift, presumably due to cold streams\nbeing more efficient at high redshift while virial shocks and AGN feedback\nbecome more relevant at lower redshifts. (3) The ratio sSFR/sMAR has a peak\nvalue, which occurs around $M_{\\rm vir}\\sim2\\times10^{11}M_{\\odot}$. (4) The\nstellar mass density within 1 kpc, $\\Sigma_1$, is a good indicator of the\ngalactic global sSFR. (5) Galaxies are statistically quenched after they reach\na maximum in $\\Sigma_1$, consistent with theoretical expectations of the gas\ncompaction model; this maximum depends on redshift. (6) In-situ star formation\nis responsible for most galactic stellar mass growth, especially for lower-mass\ngalaxies. (7) Galaxies grow inside out. The marked change in the slope of the\nsize--mass relation when galaxies became quenched, from $d\\log R_{\\rm\neff}/d\\log M_*\\sim0.35$ to $\\sim2.5$, could be the result of dry minor mergers.\n", "  Observations of accreting neutron stars (NS) with strong magnetic fields can\nbe used not only for studying the accretion flow interaction with NS\nmagnetospheres, but also for understanding the physical processes inside NSs\nand for estimating their fundamental parameters. Of particular interest are (i)\nthe interaction of a rotating neutron star (magnetosphere) with the in-falling\nmatter at different accretion rates, and (ii) the theory of deep crustal\nheating and the influence of a strong magnetic field on this process. Here, we\npresent results of the first systematic investigation of 16 X-ray pulsars with\nBe optical companions during their quiescent states, based on data from the\nChandra, XMM-Newton and Swift observatories. The whole sample of sources can be\nroughly divided into two distinct groups: i) relatively bright objects with a\nluminosity around ~10^34 erg/s and (hard) power-law spectra, and ii) fainter\nones showing thermal spectra. X-ray pulsations were detected from five objects\nin group i) with quite a large pulse fraction of 50-70 per cent. The obtained\nresults are discussed within the framework of the models describing the\ninteraction of the in-falling matter with the neutron star magnetic field and\nthose describing heating and cooling in accreting NSs.\n", "  We present the results of a 140 ks XMM-Newton observation of the B2 star\n$\\rho$ Ophiuchi A. The star has exhibited strong X-ray variability: a\ncusp-shaped increase of rate, similar to that which we partially observed in\n2013, and a bright flare. These events are separated in time by about 104 ks,\nwhich likely corresponds to the rotational period of the star (1.2 days). Time\nresolved spectroscopy of the X-ray spectra shows that the first event is caused\nby an increase of the plasma emission measure, while the second increase of\nrate is a major flare with temperatures in excess of 60 MK ($kT\\sim5$ keV).\nFrom the analysis of its rise, we infer a magnetic field of $\\ge300$ G and a\nsize of the flaring region of $\\sim1.4-1.9\\times10^{11}$ cm, which corresponds\nto $\\sim25\\%-30\\%$ of the stellar radius. We speculate that either an intrinsic\nmagnetism that produces a hot spot on its surface or an unknown low mass\ncompanion are the source of such X-rays and variability. A hot spot of magnetic\norigin should be a stable structure over a time span of $\\ge$2.5 years, and\nsuggests an overall large scale dipolar magnetic field that produces an\nextended feature on the stellar surface. In the second scenario, a low mass\nunknown companion is the emitter of X-rays and it should orbit extremely close\nto the surface of the primary in a locked spin-orbit configuration, almost on\nthe verge of collapsing onto the primary. As such, the X-ray activity of the\nsecondary star would be enhanced by its young age, and the tight orbit as in RS\nCvn systems and $\\rho$ Ophiuchi would constitute an extreme system that is\nworthy of further investigation.\n", "  We study the one-loop covariant effective action of Lifshitz theories using\nthe heat kernel technique. The characteristic feature of Lifshitz theories is\nan anisotropic scaling between space and time. This is enforced by the\nexistence of a preferred foliation of space-time, which breaks Lorentz\ninvariance. In contrast to the relativistic case, covariant Lifshitz theories\nare only invariant under diffeomorphisms preserving the foliation structure. We\ndevelop a systematic method to reduce the calculation of the effective action\nfor a generic Lifshitz operator to an algorithm acting on known results for\nrelativistic operators. In addition, we present techniques that drastically\nsimplify the calculation for operators with special properties. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of these methods by explicit applications.\n", "  We performed axisymmetric, grid-based, ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of oscillating cusp-filling tori orbiting a non-rotating neutron\nstar. A pseudo-Newtonian potential was used to construct the constant angular\nmomentum tori in equilibrium. The inner edge of the torus is terminated by a\n\"cusp\" in the effective potential. The initial motion of the model tori was\nperturbed with uniform sub-sonic vertical and diagonal velocity fields. As the\nconfiguration evolved in time, we measured the mass accretion rate on the\nneutron star surface and obtained the power spectrum. The prominent mode of\noscillation in the cusp torus is the radial epicyclic mode. It would appear\nthat vertical oscillations are suppressed by the presence of the cusp. From our\nanalysis it follows that the mass accretion rate carries a modulation imprint\nof the oscillating torus, and hence so does the boundary layer luminosity.\n", "  We report on the calculation of Gamow-Teller and double-beta decay properties\nfor nuclei around 132Sn within the framework of the realistic shell model. The\neffective shell-model Hamiltonian and Gamow-Teller transition operator are\nderived by way of many-body perturbation theory, without resorting to empirical\neffective quenching factor for the Gamow-Teller operator. The results are then\ncompared with the available experimental data, in order to establish the\nreliability of our approach. This is a mandatory step, before we apply the same\nmethodology, in forthcoming studies, to the calculation of the neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay nuclear matrix element for nuclei that are currently\nconsidered among the best candidates for the detection of this process.\n", "  It is shown that the Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane can be described as a point\nparticle in an infinite dimensional space with a particular metric. This can be\nconsidered as a special case of a general theory in which branes are points in\nthe brane space ${\\cal M}$, whose metric is dynamical, just like in general\nrelativity. Such a brane theory, amongst others, includes the flat brane space,\nwhose metric is the infinite dimensional analog of the Minkowski space metric\n$\\eta_{\\mu \\nu}$. A brane living in the latter space will be called \"flat\nbrane\"; it is like a bunch of non-interacting point particles. Quantization of\nthe latter system leads to a system of non-interacting quantum fields.\nInteractions can be included if we consider a non trivial metric in the space\nof fields. Then the effective classical brane is no longer a flat brane. For a\nparticular choice of the metric in the field space we obtain the\nDirac-Nambu-Goto brane. We also show how a Stueckelberg-like quantum field\narises within the brane space formalism. With the Stueckelberg fields, we avoid\ncertain well-known intricacies, especially those related to the position\noperator that is needed in our construction of effective classical branes from\nthe systems of quantum fields.\n", "  We present a robust, efficient, and user-friendly algorithm for detecting\nfaint emission-line sources in large integral-field spectroscopic datacubes\ntogether with the public release of the software package LSDCat (Line Source\nDetection and Cataloguing). LSDCat uses a 3-dimensional matched filter\napproach, combined with thresholding in signal-to-noise, to build a catalogue\nof individual line detections. In a second pass, the detected lines are grouped\ninto distinct objects, and positions, spatial extents, and fluxes of the\ndetected lines are determined. LSDCat requires only a small number of input\nparameters, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate values. The\nsoftware is coded in Python and capable to process very large datacubes in a\nshort time. We verify the implementation with a source insertion and recovery\nexperiment utilising a real datacube taken with the MUSE instrument at the ESO\nVery Large Telescope.\n", "  The peculiar velocity of a mass tracer is on average aligned with the dipole\nmodulation of the surrounding mass density field. We present a first\nmeasurement of the correlation between radial peculiar velocities of objects in\nthe cosmicflows-3 catalog and the dipole moment of the 2MRS galaxy distribution\nin concentric spherical shells centered on these objects. Limiting the analysis\nto cosmicflows-3 objects with distances of $100 \\rm Mpc h^{-1}$, the\ncorrelation function is detected at a confidence level $> 4\\sigma$. The\nmeasurement is found consistent with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model at $<\n1.7\\sigma$ level. We formally derive the constraints\n$0.32<\\Omega^{0.55}\\sigma_8<0.48$ ($68\\% $ confidence level) or equivalently\n$0.34<\\Omega^{0.55}/b<0.52$, where $b$ is the galaxy bias factor. Deeper and\nimproved peculiar velocity catalogs will substantially reduce the\nuncertainties, allowing tighter constraints from this type of correlations.\n", "  We investigate the impact of charge-breaking minima on the vacuum stability\nof the NMSSM. We find that, in contrast to Two-Higgs-Doublet Models like the\nMSSM, at both tree- and loop-level there exists global charge-breaking minima.\nConsequently, many regions of parameter space are rendered metastable, which\notherwise would have been considered stable if these charge-breaking minima\nwere neglected. However, the inclusion of these new scalar field directions has\nlittle impact on otherwise metastable vacuum configurations.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the localization of a five-dimensional vector\nfield on a pure geometrical thick brane. In previous work, it was shown that a\nfree massless vector field cannot be localized on such thick brane. Hence we\nintroduce the interaction between the vector field and the background scalar\nfield. Two types of couplings are constructed as examples. We get a typical\nvolcano potential for the first type of coupling and a finite square-well-like\npotential for the second one. Both of the two types of couplings ensure that\nthe vector zero mode can be localized on the pure geometrical thick brane under\nsome conditions.\n", "  Precise predictions for Higgs production via vector-boson fusion play an\nimportant role when testing the properties of the Higgs boson and probing\nnew-physics effects. While the inclusive cross section changes little when\nincluding NNLO and N3LO QCD corrections, a differential NNLO calculation with\ntypical VBF cuts shows large corrections of up to 10% in distributions.\n  In this article, we investigate the dependence of the differential NNLO QCD\ncalculation on the jet definition. Starting from the known results at a fixed\njet clustering choice, we use the electroweak H+3 jets production cross section\nat NLO precision to derive NNLO results for H+2 jets production for other jet\ndefinitions. We find that larger clustering radii significantly reduce the\nimpact of NNLO corrections. The sizable NNLO corrections for distributions are\nlargely caused by the broader energy flow inside jets at NNLO and are to be\nexpected generally for processes with jets at LO.\n", "  We present an overview of the performance of the Neutralized Drift\nCompression Experiment-II (NDCX-II) accelerator at Berkeley Lab, and report on\nrecent target experiments on beam driven melting and transmission ion energy\nloss measurements with nanosecond and millimeter-scale ion beam pulses and thin\ntin foils. Bunches with around 10^11 ions, 1-mm radius, and 2-30 ns FWHM\nduration have been created with corresponding fluences in the range of 0.1 to\n0.7 J/cm^2. To achieve these short pulse durations and mm-scale focal spot\nradii, the 1.1 MeV He+ ion beam is neutralized in a drift compression section,\nwhich removes the space charge defocusing effect during final compression and\nfocusing. The beam space charge and drift compression techniques resemble\nnecessary beam conditions and manipulations in heavy ion inertial fusion\naccelerators. Quantitative comparison of detailed particle-in-cell simulations\nwith the experiment play an important role in optimizing accelerator\nperformance.\n", "  We have been developing optical resonant cavities for laser-Compton\nscattering experiment at the Accelerator Test Facility in KEK. The main subject\nof the R&D is to increase laser pulse energy by coherently accumulating the\npulses in an optical resonant cavity. We report previous results, current\nstatus and future prospects, including a new idea of an optical resonant\ncavity.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of the stopped pion source of neutrinos at the\nSpallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to neutrino\nnon-standard interactions (NSI). In particular, we find that simple event\ncounting above threshold can improve constraints on NSI for electron- and muon-\nflavored NSI, with the strongest constraints arising for flavor-diagonal NSI\ncoupling to $\\mu$ neutrinos. However, if the detector resolution is sufficient\nto all for even a coarse spectral study of events, COHERENT will also be\nsensitive to the mass scale of NSI. We demonstrate that this can yield new\nlimits on $Z'$ completions of NSI if the gauge boson mass is $\\lesssim 1$ GeV.\n", "  We examine the applicability of diffusive lattice Boltzmann methods to\nsimulate the fluid transport through barrier coatings, finding excellent\nagreement between simulations and analytical predictions for standard parameter\nchoices. To examine more interesting non-Fickian behavior and multiple layers\nof different coatings, it becomes necessary to explore a wider range of\nparameters. However, such a range of parameters exposes deficiencies in such an\nimplementation. To investigate these discrepancies, we examine the form of\nhigher-order terms in the hydrodynamic limit of our lattice Boltzmann method.\nWe identify these corrections to fourth order and validate these predictions\nwith high accuracy. However, it is observed that the validated correction terms\ndo not fully explain the bulk of observed error. This error was instead caused\nby the standard finite boundary conditions for the contact of the coating with\nthe imposed environment. We identify a self-consistent form of these boundary\nconditions for which these errors are dramatically reduced. The instantaneous\nswitching used as a boundary condition for the barrier problem proves demanding\nenough that any higher-order corrections meaningfully contribute for a small\nrange of parameters. There is a large parameter space where the agreement\nbetween simulations and analytical predictions even in the second-order form\nare below 0.1%, making further improvements to the algorithm unnecessary for\nsuch an application.\n", "  We compute the grand partition function of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM at one-loop in\nthe $SU(2)$ sector with general chemical potentials, extending the results of\nP\\'olya's theorem. We make use of finite group theory, applicable to all orders\nof $1/N_c$ expansion. We show that only the planar terms contribute to the\ngrand partition function, which is therefore equal to the grand partition\nfunction of an ensemble of XXX$_\\frac12$ spin chains. We discuss how Hagedorn\ntemperature changes on the complex plane of chemical potentials.\n", "  In strong magnetic field the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in 3D chiral\nmaterials is shown to exhibit a new type of quantum oscillations arising from\nthe chiral magnetic effect (CME). These quantum CME oscillations are predicted\nto dominate over the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) ones in chiral materials with an\napproximately conserved chirality of quasiparticles at strong magnetic fields.\nThe phase of quantum CME oscillations differs from the phase of the\nconventional SdH oscillations by $\\pi/2$.\n", "  We realize a coherent transfer between a laser-accessible\nlow-angular-momentum Rydberg state and the circular Rydberg level with maximal\nangular momentum. This transfer is induced by a radiofrequency field with a\nhigh-purity $\\sigma^+$ polarization tuned at resonance on Stark transitions\ninside the hydrogenic Rydberg manifold. We observe over a few microseconds more\nthan twenty coherent Rabi oscillations between the initial Rydberg state and\nthe circular Rydberg level. We characterize in details these complex\noscillations involving many Rydberg levels and find them to be in perfect\nagreement with a simple theoretical model. This coherent transfer procedure\nopens the way to hybrid quantum gates bridging the gap between optical\ncommunication and quantum information manipulations based on microwave Cavity\nand Circuit Quantum Electrodynamics.\n", "  In III-V semiconductors it was shown theoretically that under optical cooling\nthe nuclear spin polaron bound to neutral donors would form below some critical\nnuclear spin temperature TC [I. A. Merkulov, Phys. Solid State 40, 930 (1998)].\nThe predicted critical behavior is a direct consequence of the use of the\nmean-field approximation. It is known however that in any finite size system a\ncritical behavior must be absent. Here we develop a model of the optically\ncooled nuclear polaron, which goes beyond the mean-field approximation. An\nexpression of the generalized free energy of the optically cooled nuclear\npolaron, valid for a finite, albeit large, number of spins, is derived. This\nmodel permits to describe the continuous transition from the fluctuation\ndominated regime to the saturation regime, as the nuclear spin temperature\ndecreases. It is shown that due to the finite number of nuclear spins involved\nin the polaron, the critical effects close to TC are smoothed by the spin\nfluctuations. Particularly, instead of a divergence, the nuclear spin\nfluctuations exhibit a sharp peak at TC, before being depressed well below TC.\nInterestingly, the formation of the nuclear polaron can, in certain conditions,\nboost the nuclear polarization beyond the value obtained solely by optical\npumping. Finally, we suggest that the nuclear polaron could be detected by spin\nnoise spectroscopy or via its superparamagnetic behavior.\n", "  We find that the equations describing T-branes with constant worldvolume\nfields are identical to the equations found by Banks, Seiberg and Shenker\ntwenty years ago to describe longitudinal five-branes in the BFSS matrix model.\nBesides giving new ways to construct T-brane solutions, this connection also\nhelps elucidate the physics of T-branes in the regime of parameters where their\nworldvolume fields are larger than the string scale. We construct explicit\nsolutions to the Banks-Seiberg-Shenker equations and show that the\ncorresponding T-branes admit an alternative description as Abelian branes at\nangles.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions at\nsmall-x in a consistent framework that takes into account the TMD evolution and\nsmall-x evolution simultaneously. The small-x evolution effects are included by\ncomputing the TMDs at appropriate scales in terms of the dipole scattering\namplitudes, which obey the relevant Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. Meanwhile, the\nTMD evolution is obtained by resumming the Collins-Soper type large logarithms\nemerged from the calculations in small-x formalism into Sudakov factors.\n", "  Advanced LIGO detectors at Hanford and Livingston made two confirmed and one\nmarginal detection of binary black holes during their first observing run. The\nfirst event, GW150914, was from the merger of two black holes much heavier that\nthose whose masses have been estimated so far, indicating a formation scenario\nthat might differ from \"ordinary\" stellar evolution. One possibility is that\nthese heavy black holes resulted from a previous merger. When the progenitors\nof a black hole binary merger result from previous mergers, they should (on\naverage) merge later, be more massive, and have spin magnitudes clustered\naround a dimensionless spin ~0.7. Here we ask the following question: can\ngravitational-wave observations determine whether merging black holes were born\nfrom the collapse of massive stars (\"first generation\"), rather than being the\nend product of earlier mergers (\"second generation\")? We construct simple,\nobservationally motivated populations of black hole binaries, and we use\nBayesian model selection to show that measurements of the masses, luminosity\ndistance (or redshift), and \"effective spin\" of black hole binaries can indeed\ndistinguish between these different formation scenarios.\n", "  In a two-component jet model, the emissions are the sum of the core and\nextended emissions: $S^{\\rm ob}=S_{\\rm core}^{\\rm ob}+S_{\\rm ext}^{\\rm ob}$,\nwith the core emissions, $S_{\\rm core}^{\\rm ob}= f S_{\\rm ext}^{\\rm\nob}\\delta^{q}$, being a function of the Doppler factor, $\\delta$, the extended\nemission, $S_{\\rm ext}^{\\rm ob}$, jet type dependent factor, $q$, and the ratio\nof the core to the extended emissions in the comoving frame, $f$. The $f$ is an\nunobservable but important parameter. Following our previous work, we collect\n65 blazars with available Doppler factor, $\\delta$, superluminal velocity,\n$\\beta_{app}$, and core-dominance parameter, $R$, calculate the ratio, $f$, and\npeform statistical analyses. We find that the ratio, $f$, in BL Lacs is on\naverage larger than that in FSRQs. We suggest that the difference of the ratio\n$f$ between FSRQs and BL Lacs is one of the possible reasons that cause the\ndifference of other observed properties between them. We also find some\nsignificant correlations between $\\log f$ and other parameters, including\nintrinsic (de-beamed) peak frequency, $\\log \\nu _{\\rm p}^{\\rm in}$, intrinsic\npolarization, $\\log P^{\\rm in}$, and core-dominance parameter, $\\log R$, for\nthe whole sample. In addition, we show that the ratio, $f$, can be estimated by\n$R$.\n", "  Promoting information spreading is a booming research topic in network\nscience community. However, the exiting studies about promoting information\nspreading seldom took into account the human memory, which plays an important\nrole in the spreading dynamics. In this paper we propose a non-Markovian\ninformation spreading model on complex networks, in which every informed node\ncontacts a neighbor by using the memory of neighbor's accumulated contact\nnumbers in the past. We systematically study the information spreading dynamics\non uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of $22$ real-world networks,\nand find an effective contact strategy of promoting information spreading,\ni.e., the informed nodes preferentially contact neighbors with small number of\naccumulated contacts. According to the effective contact strategy, the high\ndegree nodes are more likely to be chosen as the contacted neighbors in the\nearly stage of the spreading, while in the late stage of the dynamics, the\nnodes with small degrees are preferentially contacted. We also propose a\nmean-field theory to describe our model, which qualitatively agrees well with\nthe stochastic simulations on both artificial and real-world networks.\n", "  Light bending is one of the significant predictions of general relativity\n(GR) and it has been confirmed with great accuracy during the last one hundred\nyears. In this paper, we semiclassically calculate the deflection angle for the\nphotons that just grazing the Sun in the infinite derivative theories of\ngravity (IDG) which is a ghost and singularity free theory of gravity. From our\ncalculations, we find that the deflection angle $\\theta$ only depends on\n$\\Lambda/E$. $\\theta \\rightarrow \\theta_E$ when $\\Lambda/E \\rightarrow \\infty$\nand decrease to zero when $\\Lambda/E \\rightarrow 0$. The transition interval\noccurs at $10^{4}< E/\\Lambda < 10^{7}$. It should be pointed out that this\nmodel can be tested by the Chandra X-ray Observatory if $0.01 eV < \\Lambda <\n0.1 eV$.\n", "  Plasma lenses in the host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can strongly\nmodulate FRB amplitudes for a wide range of distances, including the $\\sim $\nGpc distance of the repeater FRB121102. To produce caustics, the lens'\ndispersion-measure depth (${\\rm DM}_{\\ell}$), scale size ($a$), and distance\nfrom the source ($d_{\\rm sl}$) must satisfy ${\\rm DM}_{\\ell} d_{\\rm sl} / a^2\n\\gtrsim 0.65~ {\\rm pc^2 \\ AU^{-2} \\ cm^{-3}}$. Caustics produce strong\nmagnifications ($\\lesssim 10^2$) on short time scales ($\\sim$ hours to days and\nperhaps shorter) along with narrow, epoch dependent spectral peaks (0.1 to\n1~GHz). However, strong suppression also occurs in long-duration ($\\sim$\nmonths) troughs. For geometries that produce multiple images, the resulting\nburst components will arrive differentially by $< 1~\\mu$s to tens of ms and\nthey will show different apparent dispersion measures, $\\delta{\\rm DM}_{\\rm\napparent} \\sim 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Arrival time perturbations may mask any\nunderlying periodicity with period $\\lesssim 1$ s. When arrival times differ by\nless than the burst width, interference effects in dynamic spectra are\nexpected. Strong lensing requires source sizes smaller than $({\\rm\nFresnel~scale)^2} / a$, which can be satisfied by compact objects such as\nneutron star magnetospheres but not by AGNs. Much of the phenomenology of the\nrepeating fast radio burst source FRB121102 is similar to lensing effects. The\noverall picture can be tested by obtaining wideband spectra of bursts (from\n$<1$ to 10 GHz and possibly higher), which can also be used to characterize the\nplasma environment near FRB sources. A rich variety of phenomena is expected\nfrom an ensemble of lenses near the FRB source. We discuss constraints on\ndensities, magnetic fields, and locations of plasma lenses related to\nrequirements for lensing to occur.\n", "  We present new transit and occultation times for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b.\nThe data are compatible with a constant period derivative: $\\dot{P}=-29 \\pm 3$\nms yr$^{-1}$ and $P/\\dot{P}= 3.2$ Myr. However, it is difficult to tell whether\nwe have observed orbital decay, or a portion of a 14-year apsidal precession\ncycle. If interpreted as decay, the star's tidal quality parameter $Q_\\star$ is\nabout $2\\times 10^5$. If interpreted as precession, the planet's Love number is\n$0.44\\pm 0.10$. Orbital decay appears to be the more parsimonious model: it is\nfavored by $\\Delta\\chi^2=5.5$ despite having two fewer free parameters than the\nprecession model. The decay model implies that WASP-12 was discovered within\nthe final $\\sim$0.2% of its existence, which is an unlikely coincidence but\nharmonizes with independent evidence that the planet is nearing disruption.\nPrecession does not invoke any temporal coincidence, but does require some\nmechanism to maintain an eccentricity of $\\approx$0.002 in the face of rapid\ntidal circularization. To distinguish unequivocally between decay and\nprecession will probably require a few more years of monitoring. Particularly\nhelpful will be occultation timing in 2019 and thereafter.\n", "  Superconducting quantum circuits are promising candidate for building\nscalable quantum computers. Here, we use a four-qubit superconducting quantum\nprocessor to solve a two-dimensional system of linear equations based on a\nquantum algorithm proposed by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{103}, 150502 (2009)], which promises an exponential speedup over\nclassical algorithms under certain circumstances. We benchmark the solver with\nquantum inputs and outputs, and characterize it by non-trace-preserving quantum\nprocess tomography, which yields a process fidelity of $0.837\\pm0.006$. Our\nresults highlight the potential of superconducting quantum circuits for\napplications in solving large-scale linear systems, a ubiquitous task in\nscience and engineering.\n", "  The Fock-Darwin system is analysed from the point of view of its symmetry\nproperties in the quantum and classical frameworks. The quantum Fock-Darwin\nsystem is known to have two sets of ladder operators, a fact which guarantees\nits solvability. We show that for rational values of the quotient of two\nrelevant frequencies, this system is superintegrable, the quantum symmetries\nbeing responsible for the degeneracy of the energy levels. These symmetries are\nof higher order and close a polynomial algebra. In the classical case, the\nladder operators are replaced by ladder functions and the symmetries by\nconstants of motion. We also prove that the rational classical system is\nsuperintegrable and its trajectories are closed. The constants of motion are\nalso generators of symmetry transformations in the phase space that have been\nintegrated for some special cases. These transformations connect different\ntrajectories with the same energy. The coherent states of the quantum\nsuperintegrable system are found and they reproduce the closed trajectories of\nthe classical one.\n", "  Fully constrained bubble chamber data on the pp -> pi+ pn and pp -> pi+ d\nreactions are used to investigate the ratio of the counting rates for the two\nprocesses at low pn excitation energies. Whereas the ratio is in tolerable\nagreement with that found in a high resolution spectrometer experiment, the\nangular distribution in the final pn rest frame shows that the deviation from\nthe predictions of final state interaction theory must originate primarily from\nhigher partial waves in the pn system. These considerations might also be\nsignificant for the determination of the S-wave Lambda:p scattering length from\ndata on the pp -> K+ Lambda p reaction.\n", "  We derive stringent constraints on the persistent source associated with FRB\n121102: Size $10^{17}$ cm $<R<10^{18}$ cm, age $<300$ yr, characteristic\nelectron energy $\\varepsilon_e\\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\\sim10^{49}$ erg. The\nhot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03\n(R/10^{17.5}{\\rm cm})^4 M_\\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be\nresolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\\varepsilon_e\\sim m_p c^2$\nsuggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly\nrelativistic, $M\\sim10^{-5} M_\\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended\nambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred\nplasma properties are inconsistent with typical \"magnetar wind nebulae\" model\npredictions.\n  We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of\nthe persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object,\n$R_s\\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$\nerg and Lorentz factor $\\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with\ndensity $n\\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing\nthe persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with\nenergy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong\nsynchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\\nu_{\ncoh.}\\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of\nthe deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied\nby ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB.\n  The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to\nthose of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a \"weak\nstellar explosion\", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and\nenergy ejection. However, the current upper limit on R does not allow one to\nrule out $M_c\\sim1M_\\odot$.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to alert Astronomers, particularly those using\nspectroscopic surveys, to the fact that exotic astronomical objects (e.g.\nquasars or active galactic nuclei) that send ultra-rapid quasi periodic pulses\nof optical light would generate spectroscopic features that look like emission\nlines. This gives a simple technique to find quasi periodic pulses separated by\ntimes smaller than a nanosecond. One should look for emission lines that cannot\nbe identified with known spectral lines in spectra. Such signals, generated by\nslower pulses, could also be found in the far infra-red, millimeter and radio\nregions, where they could be detected as objects unusually bright in a single\nnarrow-band filter or channel. The outstanding interest of the technique comes\nfrom its simplicity so that it can be used to find ultra-rapid quasi-periodic\noscillators in large astronomical surveys. A very small fraction of objects\npresently identified as Lyman alpha emitters that do not have other spectral\nfeatures to confirm the Lyman alpha redshift, may possibly be quasi-periodic\noscillators. However this is only a hypothesis that needs more observations for\nconfirmation.\n", "  We show clear experimental evidence of co-operative terahertz (THz) dynamics\nobserved below 3 THz (~100 cm-1), for a low-symmetry Zr-based metal-organic\nframework (MOF) structure, termed MIL-140A [ZrO(O2C-C6H4-CO2)]. Utilizing a\ncombination of high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering and synchrotron\nradiation far-infrared spectroscopy, we measured low-energy vibrations\noriginating from the hindered rotations of organic linkers, whose energy\nbarriers and detailed dynamics have been elucidated via ab initio density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations. For completeness, we obtained Raman\nspectra and characterized the alterations to the complex pore architecture\ncaused by the THz rotations. We discovered an array of soft modes with\ntrampoline-like motions, which could potentially be the source of anomalous\nmechanical phenomena, such as negative linear compressibility and negative\nthermal expansion. Our results also demonstrate coordinated shear dynamics\n(~2.5 THz), a mechanism which we have shown to destabilize MOF crystals, in the\nexact crystallographic direction of the minimum shear modulus (Gmin).\n", "  We present a frequency-renormalized multipolaron expansion method to explore\nthe ground state of quantum Rabi model (QRM). The main idea is to take polaron\nas starting point to expand the ground state of QRM. The polarons are deformed\nand displaced oscillator states with variationally determined\nfrequency-renormalization and displacement parameters. This method is an\nextension of the previously proposed polaron concept and the coherent state\nexpansion used in the literature, which shows high efficiency in describing the\nphysics of the QRM. The proposed method is expected to be useful for solving\nother more complicated light-matter interaction models.\n", "  We have studied the spin dynamics of a dense two-dimensional electron gas\nconfined in a GaAs/AlGaAs triple quantum well by using time-resolved Kerr\nrotation and resonant spin amplification. Strong anisotropy of the spin\nrelaxation time up to a factor of 10 was found between the electron spins\noriented in-plane and out-of-plane when the excitation energy is tuned to an\nexciton bound to neutral donor transition. We model this anisotropy using an\ninternal magnetic field and the inhomogeneity of the electron g-factor. The\ndata analysis allows us to determine the direction and magnitude of this\ninternal field in the range of a few mT for our studied structure, which\ndecreases with the sample temperature and optical power. The dependence of the\nanisotropic spin relaxation was directly measured as a function of several\nexperimental parameters: excitation wavelength, sample temperature, pump-probe\ntime delay, and pump power.\n", "  In the present article, we show how to formulate the partially contracted\nn-electron valence second order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) energies in the\natomic and active molecular orbital basis by employing the Laplace\ntransformation of orbital-energy denominators (OED). As atomic-orbital (AO)\nbasis functions are inherently localized and the number of active orbitals is\ncomparatively small, our formulation is particularly suited for a\nlinearly-scaling NEVPT2 implementation. Some of the NEVPT2 energy contributions\ncan be formulated completely in the AO basis as single-reference second-order\nM{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory and benefit from sparse active-pseudo\ndensity matrices - particularly if the active molecular orbitals are localized\nonly in parts of a molecule. Furthermore, we show that for multi-reference\nperturbation theories it is particularly challenging to find optimal parameters\nof the numerical Laplace transformation as the fit range may vary among the 8\ndifferent OEDs by many orders of magnitude. Selecting the number of quadrature\npoints for each OED separately according to an accuracy-based criterion allows\nus to control the errors in the NEVPT2 energies reliably.\n", "  Domains in BaTiO$_3$ induces a regular modulation of uniaxial magnetic\nanisotropy in CoFeB via an inverse magnetostriction effect. As a result, the\ndomain structures of the CoFeB wedge film and BaTiO$_3$ substrate correlate\nfully and straight ferroelectric domain boundaries in BaTiO$_3$ pin magnetic\ndomain walls in CoFeB. We use x-ray photoemission electron microscopy and\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy to characterize the spin structure of\nthe pinned domain walls. In a rotating magnetic field, abrupt and reversible\ntransitions between two domain wall types occur, namely, narrow walls where the\nmagnetization vectors align head-to-tail and much broader walls with\nalternating head-to-head and tail-to-tail magnetization configurations. We\ncharacterize variations of the domain wall spin structure as a function of\nmagnetic field strength and CoFeB film thickness and compare the experimental\nresults with micromagnetic simulations.\n", "  Supermassive primordial stars are suspected to be the progenitors of the most\nmassive quasars at z~6. Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since\nthe general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these\nstars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at\nbirth.\n", "  Noncollinear and noncoplanar magnetic textures including skyrmions and\nvortices act as emergent electromagnetic fields and give rise to novel\nelectronic and transport properties. We here report a unified understanding of\nnoncoplanar magnetic orderings emergent from the spin-charge coupling in\nitinerant magnets. The mechanism has its roots in effective multiple spin\ninteractions beyond the conventional Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\nmechanism, which are ubiquitously generated in itinerant electron systems with\nlocal magnetic moments. Carefully examining the higher-order perturbations in\nterms of the spin-charge coupling, we construct a minimal effective spin model\ncomposed of the bilinear and biquadratic interactions with particular wave\nnumbers dictated by the Fermi surface. We find that our effective model\ncaptures the underlying physics of the instability toward noncoplanar\nmultiple-$Q$ states discovered recently in itinerant magnets: a single-$Q$\nhelical state expected from the RKKY theory is replaced by a double-$Q$ vortex\ncrystal with chirality density waves even for an infinitely small spin-charge\ncoupling on generic lattices [R. Ozawa $\\mathit{et \\ al.}$, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n$\\mathbf{85}$, 103703 (2016)], and a triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystal with a high\ntopological number of two appears with increasing the spin-charge coupling on a\ntriangular lattice [R. Ozawa, S. Hayami, and Y. Motome, to appear in Phys. Rev.\nLett. (arXiv: 1703.03227)]. We find that, by introducing an external magnetic\nfield, our effective model exhibits a plethora of multiple-$Q$ states. Our\nfindings will serve as a guide for exploring further exotic magnetic orderings\nin itinerant magnets.\n", "  We consider the operator ${\\mathcal A}_h=-\\Delta+iV$ in the semi-classical\n$h\\rightarrow 0$, where $V$ is a smooth real potential with no critical points.\nWe obtain both the left margin of the spectrum, as well as resolvent estimates\non the left side of this margin. We extend here previous results obtained for\nthe Dirichlet realization of ${\\mathcal A}_h$ by removing significant\nlimitations that were formerly imposed on $V$. In addition, we apply our\ntechniques to the more general Robin boundary condition and to a transmission\nproblem which is of significant interest in physical applications.\n", "  We spectroscopically investigate the hyperfine, rotational and Zeeman\nstructure of the vibrational levels $\\text{v}'=0$, $7$, $13$ within the\nelectronically excited $c^3\\Sigma_g^+$ state of $^{87}\\text{Rb}_2$ for magnetic\nfields of up to $1000\\,\\text{G}$. As spectroscopic methods we use short-range\nphotoassociation of ultracold Rb atoms as well as photoexcitation of ultracold\nmolecules which have been previously prepared in several well-defined quantum\nstates of the $a^3\\Sigma_u^+$ potential. As a byproduct, we present optical\ntwo-photon transfer of weakly bound Feshbach molecules into $a^3\\Sigma_u^+$,\n$\\text{v}=0$ levels featuring different nuclear spin quantum numbers. A simple\nmodel reproduces well the molecular level structures of the $c^3\\Sigma_g^+$\nvibrational states and provides a consistent assignment of the measured\nresonance lines. Furthermore, the model can be used to predict the relative\ntransition strengths of the lines. From fits to the data we extract for each\nvibrational level the rotational constant, the effective spin-spin interaction\nconstant, as well as the Fermi contact parameter and (for the first time) the\nanisotropic hyperfine constant. In an alternative approach, we perform\ncoupled-channel calculations where we fit the relevant potential energy curves,\nspin-orbit interactions and hyperfine functions. The calculations reproduce the\nmeasured hyperfine level term frequencies with an average uncertainty of\n$\\pm9\\:$MHz, similar as for the simple model. From these fits we obtain a\nsection of the potential energy curve for the $c^3\\Sigma_g^+$ state which can\nbe used for predicting the level structure for the vibrational manifold\n$\\text{v}'=0$ to $13$ of this electronic state.\n", "  We further explore the connection between holographic $O(n)$ tensor models\nand random matrices. First, we consider the simplest non-trivial uncolored\ntensor model and show that the results for the density of states, level spacing\nand spectral form factor are qualitatively identical to the colored case\nstudied in arXiv:1612.06330. We also explain an overall 16-fold degeneracy by\nidentifying various symmetries, some of which were unavailable in SYK and the\ncolored models. Secondly, and perhaps more interestingly, we systematically\nidentify the Spectral Mirror Symmetry and the Time-Reversal Symmetry of both\nthe colored and uncolored models for all values of $n$, and use them to\nidentify the Andreev ensembles that control their random matrix behavior. We\nfind that the ensembles that arise exhibit a refined version of Bott\nperiodicity in $n$.\n", "  We present several advances in the effective field theory calculation of the\nHiggs mass in MSSM scenarios with heavy superparticles. In particular, we\ncompute the dominant two-loop threshold corrections to the quartic Higgs\ncoupling for generic values of the relevant SUSY-breaking parameters, including\nall contributions controlled by the strong gauge coupling and by the\nthird-family Yukawa couplings. We also study the effects of a representative\nsubset of dimension-six operators in the effective theory valid below the SUSY\nscale. Our results will allow for an improved determination of the Higgs mass\nand of the associated theoretical uncertainty.\n", "  Within the framework of four dimensional conformal supergravity we consider\n$\\mathcal{N}=1,2,3,4$ supersymmetric theories generally twisted along the\nabelian subgroups of the R-symmetry and possibly other global symmetry groups.\nUpon compactification on constant curvature Riemann surfaces with arbitrary\ngenus we provide an extensive classification of the resulting two dimensional\ntheories according to the amount of supersymmetry that is preserved. Exploiting\nthe c-extremization prescription introduced in arXiv:1211.4030 we develop a\ngeneral procedure to obtain the central charge for 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$\ntheories and the expression of the corresponding R-current in terms of the\noriginal 4d one and its mixing with the other abelian global currents.\n", "  We consider high-mass systems of two or more particles that are produced by\nQCD hard scattering in hadronic collisions. We examine the azimuthal\ncorrelations between the system and one of its particles. We point out that the\nperturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can\nlead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order\ndivergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross\nsection at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle\n$\\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark\npair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and\ndiboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass\nlepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.\nHowever, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the\ncomputation of QED radiative corrections. We specify general conditions that\nproduce the divergences by discussing their physical origin in fixed-order\ncomputations. We show lowest-order illustrative results for $\\cos(n\\varphi)$\nasymmetries (with $n=1,2,4,6$) in top-quark pair production and associated\nproduction of a vector boson and a jet at the LHC. The divergences are removed\nby a proper all-order resummation procedure of the perturbative contributions.\nResummation leads to azimuthal asymmetries that are finite and computable. We\npresent first quantitative results of such a resummed computation for the\n$\\cos(2\\varphi)$ asymmetry in top-quark pair production at the LHC.\n", "  NA62 is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS dedicated to measurements\nof rare kaon decays. Such measurements, like the branching fraction of the\n$K^{+} \\rightarrow \\pi^{+} \\nu \\bar\\nu$ decay, have the potential to bring\nsignificant insights into new physics processes when comparison is made with\nprecise theoretical predictions. For this purpose, innovative techniques have\nbeen developed, in particular, in the domain of low-mass tracking devices.\nDetector construction spanned several years from 2009 to 2014. The\ncollaboration started detector commissioning in 2014 and will collect data\nuntil the end of 2018. The beam line and detector components are described\ntogether with their early performance obtained from 2014 and 2015 data.\n", "  We have computed the self-energies and a set of three-particle vertex\nfunctions for massless QCD at the four-loop level in the MSbar renormalization\nscheme. The vertex functions are evaluated at points where one of the momenta\nvanishes. Analytical results are obtained for a generic gauge group and with\nthe full gauge dependence, which was made possible by extensive use of the\nForcer program for massless four-loop propagator integrals. The bare results in\ndimensional regularization are provided in terms of master integrals and\nrational coefficients; the latter are exact in any space-time dimension. Our\nresults can be used for further precision investigations of the perturbative\nbehaviour of the theory in schemes other than MSbar. As an example, we derive\nthe five-loop beta function in a relatively common alternative, the minimal\nmomentum subtraction (MiniMOM) scheme.\n", "  In this paper, we study the 3-body products (two single stars and a binary)\nof binary-binary (2+2) scattering interactions. This is done using a\ncombination of analytic methods and numerical simulations of 2+2 scattering\ninteractions, both in isolation and in a homogeneous background potential. We\nderive analytically a simple formula relating the angle between the velocity\nvectors of the two ejected single stars and the orbital separation of the\nremaining binary. We compare our analytic formulation to numerical scattering\nsimulations, and illustrate that the agreement is excellent, both in isolation\nand in a homogeneous background potential. Our results are ideally suited for\napplication to the GAIA database, which is expected to identify many hundred\nrunaway stars. The analytic relation presented here has the potential to\nidentify runaway stars formed dynamically with high confidence. Finally, by\napplying our method to the runaways AE Aur and $\\mu$ Col, we illustrate that it\ncan be used to constrain the history of the background potential, which was\ndenser than the presently observed density in the case of the Trapezium\ncluster.\n", "  Plasma properties inside a hydrogen-filled capillary discharge waveguide were\nmodeled with dissipative magnetohydrodynamic simulations to enable analysis of\ncapillaries of circular and square cross-sections implying that square\ncapillaries can be used to guide circularly-symmetric laser beams. When the\nquasistationary stage of the discharge is reached, the plasma and temperature\nin the vicinity of the capillary axis has almost the same profile for both the\ncircular and square capillaries. The effect of cross-section on the electron\nbeam focusing properties were studied using the simulation-derived magnetic\nfield map. Particle tracking simulations showed only slight effects on the\nelectron beam symmetry in the horizontal and diagonal directions for square\ncapillary.\n", "  We explicitly show how the field dependent 2-cocycle that arises in the\ncurrent algebra of 4 dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes can be used as\na central extension to turn the BMS4 Lie algebra, or more precisely, the BMS4\naction Lie algebroid, into a genuine Lie algebroid with field dependent\nstructure functions. Both a BRST formulation, where the extension appears as a\nghost number 2 cocyle, and a formulation in terms of vertex operator algebras\nare introduced. The mapping of the celestial sphere to the cylinder then\nimplies zero mode shifts of the asymptotic part of the shear and of the news\ntensor.\n", "  A light stop around the weak scale is a hopeful messenger of natural\nsupersymmetry (SUSY), but it has not shown up at the current stage of LHC. Such\na situation raises the question of the fate of natural SUSY. Actually, a\nrelatively light stop can easily be hidden in a compressed spectra such as mild\nmass degeneracy between stop and neutralino plus top quark. Searching for such\na stop at the LHC is a challenge. On the other hand, in terms of the argument\nof natural SUSY, other members in the stop sector, including a heavier stop\n$\\tilde{t}_2$ and lighter sbottom $\\tilde{b}_1$ (both assumed to be\nleft-handed-like), are also supposed to be relatively light and therefore\nsearching for them would provide an alternative method to probe natural SUSY\nwith a compressed spectrum. In this paper we consider quasi-natural SUSY which\ntolerates relatively heavy colored partners near the TeV scale, with a\nmoderately large mass gap between the heavier members and the lightest stop.\nThen $W/Z/h$ as companions of $\\tilde{t}_2$ and $\\tilde{b}_1$ decaying into\n$\\tilde{t}_1$ generically are well boosted, and they, along with other visible\nparticles from $\\tilde{t}_1$ decay, are a good probe to study compressed SUSY.\nWe find that the resulting search strategy with boosted bosons can have better\nsensitivity than those utilizing multi-leptons.\n", "  The BVI lightcurves of seven recent novae have been extensively mapped with\ndaily robotic observations from Atacama (Chile). They are V1534 Sco, V1535 Sco,\nV2949 Oph, V3661 Oph, MASTER OT J010603.18-744715.8, TCP J1734475-240942 and\nASASSN-16ma. Five belong to the Bulge, one to SMC and another is a Galactic\ndisk object. The two program novae detected in gamma-rays by Fermi-LAT (TCP\nJ1734475-240942 and ASASSN-16ma) are Bulge objects with unevolved companions.\nThey distinguish themselves in showing a double-component optical lightcurve.\nThe first component to develop is the fireball from freely-expanding,\nballistic-launched ejecta with the time of passage through maximum which is\nstrongly dependent on wavelength (~1 day delay between B and I bands). The\nsecond component, emerging simultaneously with the nova detection in\ngamma-rays, evolves at a slower pace, its optical brightness being proportional\nto the gamma-ray flux, and its passage through maximum not dependent on\nwavelength. The fact that gamma-rays are detected at peak flux level differing\nby 4x from novae at the distance of the Bulge seems to suggest that gamma-ray\nemission is not a widespread property of normal novae. We discuss the\nadvantages offered by high-quality photometric observations collected with only\none telescope (as opposed to data provided by a number of different\ninstruments), and observe the effects of: wavelength dependence of a fireball\nexpansion, recombination in the flashed wind of a giant companion, subtle\npresence of hiccups, super-soft X-ray emission on and off. Four program novae\n(V2949 Oph, V3661 Oph, TCP J18102829-2729590, and ASASSN-16ma) are found to\nhave normal dwarf companions, while V1534 Sco contains an M3III giant, V1535\nSco a K-type giant, and MASTER OT J010603.18-744715.8 a sub-giant.\n", "  We investigate the temporal photonic analogue of the dam-break phenomenon for\nshallow water by exploiting a fiber optics setup. We clearly observe the decay\nof the step-like input (photonic dam) into a pair of oppositely propagating\nrarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave. Our results show evidence for a\ncritical transition of the dispersive shock into a self-cavitating state. The\ndetailed observation of the cavitating state dynamics allows for a fully\nquantitative test of the Whitham modulation theory applied to the universal\ndefocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation.\n", "  The strong and radiative decay properties of the low-lying $\\Omega_c$ states\nare studied in a constituent quark model. We find that the newly observed\n$\\Omega_c$ states by the LHCb Collaboration can fit in well the decay patterns.\nThus, their spin-parity can be possibly assigned as the following: (i) The\n$\\Omega_c(3000)$ has $J^P=1/2^-$ and corresponds to the narrow $1P$ mixed state\n$|1^2P_{\\lambda}\\frac{1}{2}^-\\rangle_1$, its partner\n$|1^2P_{\\lambda}\\frac{1}{2}^-\\rangle_2$ should be a broad state with a width of\n$\\sim 100$ MeV. (ii) The $\\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\\Omega_c(3066)$ can be assigned\nto be two $J^P=3/2^-$ states, $|1^4P_{\\lambda}\\frac{3}{2}^-\\rangle$ and\n$|1^2P_{\\lambda}\\frac{3}{2}^-\\rangle$, respectively. (iii) The $\\Omega_c(3090)$\ncan be assigned as the $|1^4P_{\\lambda}\\frac{5}{2}^-\\rangle$ state with\n$J^P=5/2^-$. (iv) The $\\Omega_c(3119)$ might correspond to one of the two $2S$\nstates of the first radial excitations, i.e.\n$|2^2S_{\\lambda\\lambda}\\frac{1}{2}^+\\rangle$ or\n$|2^4S_{\\lambda\\lambda}\\frac{3}{2}^+\\rangle$.\n", "  Motivated by recent results by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on the\nangular distribution of the $B \\to K^* \\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, we perform a\nstate-of-the-art analysis of rare $B$ meson decays based on the $b \\to s \\mu\n\\mu$ transition. Using standard estimates of hadronic uncertainties, we confirm\nthe presence of a sizable discrepancy between data and SM predictions. We do\nnot find evidence for a $q^2$ or helicity dependence of the discrepancy. The\ndata can be consistently described by new physics in the form of a four-fermion\ncontact interaction $(\\bar s \\gamma_\\alpha P_L b)(\\bar \\mu \\gamma^\\alpha \\mu)$.\nAssuming that the new physics affects decays with muons but not with electrons,\nwe make predictions for a variety of theoretically clean observables sensitive\nto violation of lepton flavour universality.\n", "  The Sauter-Schwinger effect predicts the creation of electron-positron pairs\nout of the quantum vacuum by a strong and slowly varying electric field. This\neffect can be dynamically assisted by an additional weaker time-dependent\nfield, which may drastically enhance the pair-creation probability. In previous\nstudies, it has been found that the enhancement may crucially depend on the\ntemporal shape of this weaker pulse, e.g., a Gaussian profile $\\exp\\{-(\\omega\nt)^2\\}$ or a Sauter pulse $1/\\cosh^2(\\omega t)$ behave quite differently. In\norder to understand this difference, we make a perturbative expansion in terms\nof the weaker field while treating the strong electric field\nnon-perturbatively. For a large class of profiles including the Sauter pulse,\nalready the sum of the zeroth-order and the first-order amplitudes of this\nperturbative expansion yields good agreement. For other cases, such as a\nGaussian or sinusoidal profile, this is not true in general and higher orders\ncan yield the dominant contribution - where the dominant order depends on the\nchosen parameters. Our findings are confirmed by numerical simulations and help\nus to sort previous results into a bigger picture.\n", "  We study what happens to the Nucleon, Delta and Omega baryons in the hadronic\ngas and the quark-gluon plasma, with particular interest in parity doubling and\nits emergence as the plasma is heated. This is done using simulations of\nlattice QCD, employing the FASTSUM anisotropic Nf=2+1 ensembles, with four\ntemperatures below and four above the deconfinement transition temperature.\nBelow Tc we find that the positive-parity groundstate masses are largely\ntemperature independent, whereas the negative-parity ones are reduced\nconsiderably as the temperature increases. This may be of interest for\nheavy-ion phenomenology. Close to the transition, the masses are nearly\ndegenerate, in line with the expectation from chiral symmetry restoration.\nAbove Tc we find a clear signal of parity doubling in all three channels, with\nthe effect of the heavier s quark visible.\n", "  Previous studies of a three family Yukawa unified supersymmetric grand\nunified theory (SUSY GUT) with SO(10) or Pati-Salam (PS) gauge symmetry\nproposed by Raby and students show that this model is able to fit low energy\nand inflation observables. However, the fit to low energy observables is not\ngreat especially for $\\sin2\\beta$, and up and down quark masses. In this paper,\nwe show that by choosing PS as the gauge group and modifying the Yukawa sector,\nthe low energy fit improves significantly while other qualities of the model\nare maintained. In particular, the lightest SUSY particle is the neutralino\nwith mass of order 300 - 500 GeV, the lightest stop and sbottom have mass of\norder 3 - 5 TeV and the CP odd Higgs mass is of order 5 - 6 TeV, so we are in\nthe decoupling limit for the light Higgs. In addition, we reinterpret gluino\nsimplified model analyses by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and find that the\nmost stringent gluino mass bound for our model is\n$M_{\\tilde{g}}\\sim1.9\\,\\text{TeV}$. The current best fit point, consistent with\nthis bound, with gluino mass $M_{\\tilde{g}}=1.9\\,\\text{TeV}$ has\n$\\chi^2/\\text{dof}\\approx1.12$, compared to the best fit point of the previous\nmodel with $\\chi^2/\\text{dof}=1.90$. We find that predictions for the electric\ndipole moment of the electron, the branching ratio $BR(\\mu \\rightarrow e\n\\gamma)$ and the CP violating angle in the lepton sector, $\\sin\\delta$, are\naffected significantly as compared to previous results. In summary, we are\nunable to rule out this model or place an upper bound on gluino mass accessible\nby this run of the LHC because the $\\chi^2/\\text{dof}$ of this model is well\nbelow $2\\sigma$ even for a gluino mass as high as 2.7 TeV. On the bright side,\nthis means that this model is still viable and we might find low energy SUSY\nparticles in the near future.\n", "  In the new era of large-scale astronomical surveys, automated methods of\nanalysis and classification of bulk data are a fundamental tool for fast and\nefficient production of deliverables. This becomes ever more imminent as we\nenter the Gaia era. We investigate the potential detectability of eclipsing\nbinaries with Gaia using a data set of all Kepler eclipsing binaries sampled\nwith Gaia cadence and folded with the Kepler period. The performance of fitting\nmethods is evaluated with comparison to real Kepler data parameters and a\nclassification scheme is proposed for the potentially detectable sources based\non the geometry of the light curve fits. The polynomial chain (polyfit) and\ntwo-Gaussian models are used for light curve fitting of the data set.\nClassification is performed with a combination of the t-SNE (t-distrubuted\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding) and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of\nApplications with Noise) algorithms. We find that approximately 68% of Kepler\nEclipsing Binary sources are potentially detectable by Gaia when folded with\nthe Kepler period and propose a classification scheme of the detectable sources\nbased on the morphological type indicative of the light curve, with subclasses\nthat reflect the properties of the fitted model (presence and visibility of\neclipses, their width, depth, etc.).\n", "  The complex Langevin method and the generalized Lefschetz-thimble method are\ntwo closely related approaches to the sign problem, which are both based on\ncomplexification of the original dynamical variables. The former can be viewed\nas a generalization of the stochastic quantization using the Langevin equation,\nwhereas the latter is a deformation of the integration contour using the\nso-called holomorphic gradient flow. In order to clarify their relationship, we\npropose a formulation which combines the two methods by applying the former\nmethod to the real variables that parametrize the deformed integration contour\nin the latter method. Three versions, which differ in the treatment of the\nresidual sign problem in the latter method, are considered. By applying them to\na single-variable model, we find, in particular, that one of the versions\ninterpolates the complex Langevin method and the original Lefschetz-thimble\nmethod.\n", "  Using the approach based on conformal symmetry we calculate the three-loop\n(NNLO) contribution to the evolution equation for flavor-nonsinglet leading\ntwist operators in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme. The explicit expression\nfor the three-loop kernel is derived for the corresponding light-ray operator\nin coordinate space. The expansion in local operators is performed and explicit\nresults are given for the matrix of the anomalous dimensions for the operators\nup to seven covariant derivatives. The results are directly applicable to the\nrenormalization of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude and\nflavor-nonsinglet generalized parton distributions.\n", "  Remarkable progress can be observed in recent years in the controlled\nemission, guiding and detection of coherent, free electrons. Those methods were\napplied in matter wave interferometers leading to high phase sensitivities and\nnovel sensor technologies for dephasing influences such as mechanical\nvibrations or electromagnetic frequencies. However, the previous devices have\nbeen large laboratory setups. For future sensor applications or tests of the\ncoherence properties of an electron source, small, portable interferometers are\nrequired. Here, we demonstrate a compact biprism electron interferometer that\ncan be used for mobile applications. The design was optimized for small\ndimensions by beam path simulations. The interferometer has a length between\nthe tip and the superposition plane before magnification of only 47 mm and\nprovides electron interference pattern with a contrast up to 42.7 %. The\ndetection of two dephasing frequencies at 50 and 150 Hz was demonstrated\napplying second order correlation and Fourier analysis of the interference\ndata.\n", "  We present the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project based on 384 hours of\nobservations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 3 GHz (10 cm)\ntoward the two square degree Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. The final\nmosaic reaches a median rms of 2.3 uJy/beam over the two square degrees at an\nangular resolution of 0.75\". To fully account for the spectral shape and\nresolution variations across the broad (2 GHz) band, we image all data with a\nmultiscale, multifrequency synthesis algorithm. We present a catalog of 10,830\nradio sources down to 5 sigma, out of which 67 are combined from multiple\ncomponents. Comparing the positions of our 3 GHz sources with those from the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA)-COSMOS survey, we estimate that the astrometry\nis accurate to 0.01\" at the bright end (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N_3GHz > 20).\nSurvival analysis on our data combined with the VLA-COSMOS 1.4~GHz Joint\nProject catalog yields an expected median radio spectral index of alpha=-0.7.\nWe compute completeness corrections via Monte Carlo simulations to derive the\ncorrected 3 GHz source counts. Our counts are in agreement with previously\nderived 3 GHz counts based on single-pointing (0.087 square degrees) VLA data.\nIn summary, the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project simultaneously provides the\nlargest and deepest radio continuum survey at high (0.75\") angular resolution\nto date, bridging the gap between last-generation and next-generation surveys.\n", "  String theory models of axion monodromy inflation exhibit scalar potentials\nwhich are quadratic for small values of the inflaton field and evolve to a more\ncomplicated function for large field values. Oftentimes the large field\nbehaviour is gentler than quadratic, lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This\neffect, known as flattening, has been observed in the string theory context\nthrough the properties of the DBI+CS D-brane action. We revisit such flattening\neffects in type IIB flux compactifications with mobile D7-branes, with the\ninflaton identified with the D7-brane position. We observe that, with a generic\nchoice of background fluxes, flattening effects are larger than previously\nobserved, allowing to fit these models within current experimental bounds. In\nparticular, we compute the cosmological observables in scenarios compatible\nwith closed-string moduli stabilisation, finding tensor-to-scalar ratios as low\nas r ~ 0.04. These are models of single field inflation in which the inflaton\nis much lighter than the other scalars through a mild tuning of the\ncompactification data.\n", "  In this work we present an exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell field\nequations describing compact, charged objects within the framework of classical\ngeneral relativity. Our model is constructed by embedding a four-dimensional\nspherically symmetric static metric into a five dimensional flat metric. The\nsource term for the matter field is composed of a perfect fluid distribution\nwith charge. We show that our model obeys all the physical requirements and\nstability conditions necessary for a realistic stellar model. Our theoretical\nmodel approximates observations of neutron stars and pulsars to a very good\ndegree of accuracy.\n", "  Within gauge/gravity duality, we compute the scalar and tensor mass spectrum\nin the boundary theory defined by the five-dimensional sigma-model coupled to\ngravity obtained by constraining to eight scalars the truncation on T$^{1,1}$\nthat corresponds to the Papadopoulos-Tseytlin (PT) ansatz. We study\nfluctuations around the 1-parameter family of backgrounds that lift to the\nbaryonic branch of the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) system, and interpolates between\nthe KS background and the Maldacena-Nunez one (CVMN). We adopt a gauge\ninvariant formalism in the treatment of the fluctuations that we interpret as\nstates of the dual theory. The tensor spectrum interpolates between the\ndiscrete spectrum of the KS background and the continuum spectrum of the CVMN\nbackground, in particular showing the emergence of a finite energy range\ncontaining a dense set of states, as expected from dimensional deconstruction.\nThe scalar spectrum shows analogous features, and in addition it contains one\nstate that becomes parametrically light far from the origin along the baryonic\nbranch.\n", "  The signatures for the existence of dark matter are revealed only through its\ngravitational interaction. Theoretical arguments support that the Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particle (WIMP) can be a class of dark matter and it can\nannihilate and/or decay to Standard Model particles, among which neutrino is a\nfavorable candidate. We show that the proposed 50 kt Magnetized Iron\nCALorimeter (MagICAL) detector under the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO)\nproject can play an important role in the indirect searches of Galactic diffuse\ndark matter in the neutrino and antineutrino mode separately. We present the\nsensitivity of 500 kt$\\cdot$yr MagICAL detector to set limits on the\nvelocity-averaged self-annihilation cross-section ($\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$)\nand decay lifetime ($\\tau$) of dark matter having mass in the range of 2 GeV\n$\\leq m_\\chi \\leq $ 90 GeV and 4 GeV $\\leq m_\\chi \\leq $ 180 GeV respectively,\nassuming no excess over the conventional atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino\nfluxes at the INO site. Our limits for low mass dark matter constrain the\nparameter space which has not been explored before. We show that MagICAL will\nbe able to set competitive constraints, $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle\\leq\n1.87\\,\\times\\,10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for $\\chi\\chi\\rightarrow\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and\n$\\tau\\geq 4.8\\,\\times\\,10^{24}$ s for $\\chi\\rightarrow\\nu\\bar\\nu$ at 90$\\%$\nC.L. (1 d.o.f.) for $m_\\chi$ = 10 GeV assuming the NFW as dark matter density\nprofile.\n", "  Context: Understanding how accretion proceeds is a key question of star\nformation, with important implications for both the physical and chemical\nevolution of young stellar objects. In particular, very little is known about\nthe accretion variability in the earliest stages of star formation.\n  Aims: To characterise protostellar accretion histories towards individual\nsources by utilising sublimation and freeze-out chemistry of CO.\n  Methods: A sample of 24 embedded protostars are observed with the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) in context of the large program \"Mass Assembly of\nStellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA\" (MASSES). The size of the\nC$^{18}$O emitting region, where CO has sublimated into the gas-phase, is\nmeasured towards each source and compared to the expected size of the region\ngiven the current luminosity. The SMA observations also include 1.3 mm\ncontinuum data, which are used to investigate whether a link can be established\nbetween accretion bursts and massive circumstellar disks.\n  Results: Depending on the adopted sublimation temperature of the CO ice,\nbetween 20% and 50% of the sources in the sample show extended C$^{18}$O\nemission indicating that the gas was warm enough in the past that CO sublimated\nand is currently in the process of refreezing; something which we attribute to\na recent accretion burst. Given the fraction of sources with extended C$^{18}$O\nemission, we estimate an average interval between bursts of 20000-50000 yr,\nwhich is consistent with previous estimates. No clear link can be established\nbetween the presence of circumstellar disks and accretion bursts, however the\nthree closest known binaries in the sample (projected separations <20 AU) all\nshow evidence of a past accretion burst, indicating that close binary\ninteractions may also play a role in inducing accretion variability.\n", "  We investigate the ultraviolet (UV) behaviour of 6D N=1 supersymmetric\neffective (Abelian) gauge theories compactified on a two-torus ($T_2$) with\nmagnetic flux. To this purpose we compute offshell the one-loop correction to\nthe Wilson line state self-energy. The offshell calculation is actually\nnecessary to capture the usual effective field theory expansion in powers of\n$(\\partial/\\Lambda)$. Particular care is paid to the regularization of the\n(divergent) momentum integrals, which is relevant for identifying the\ncorresponding counterterm(s). We find a counterterm which is a new higher\ndimensional effective operator of dimension d=6, that is enhanced for a larger\ncompactification area (where the effective theory applies) and is consistent\nwith the symmetries of the theory. Its consequences are briefly discussed and\ncomparison is made with orbifold compactifications without flux.\n", "  The International Rosetta Mission was launched in 2004 and consists of the\norbiter spacecraft Rosetta and the lander Philae. The aim of the mission is to\nmap the comet 67P Churyumov Gerasimenko by remote sensing, to examine its\nenvironment insitu and its evolution in the inner solar system.Rosetta was the\nfirst spacecraft to rendezvous and orbit a comet, accompanying it as it passes\nthrough the inner solar system, and to deploy a lander, Philae and perform in\nsitu science on the comet surface. The primary goals of the mission were to:\ncharacterize the comets nucleus; examine the chemical, mineralogical and\nisotopic composition of volatiles and refractories; examine the physical\nproperties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories in a cometary\nnucleus; study the development of cometary activity and the processes in the\nsurface layer of the nucleus and in the coma; detail the origin of comets, the\nrelationship between cometary and interstellar material and the implications\nfor the origin of the solar system; characterize asteroids, 2867 Steins and 21\nLutetia. This paper presents a summary of mission operations and science,\nfocusing on the Rosetta orbiter component of the mission during its comet\nphase, from early 2014 up to September 2016.\n", "  The tensor to scalar ratio is affected by the evolution of the large-scale\ngauge fields potentially amplified during an inflationary stage of expansion.\nAfter deriving the exact evolution equations for the scalar and tensor modes of\nthe geometry in the presence of dynamical gauge fields, it is shown that the\ntensor to scalar ratio is bounded from below by the dominance of the adiabatic\ncontribution and it cannot be smaller than one thousands whenever the\nmagnetogenesis is driven by a single inflaton field.\n", "  We propose a robust realization of the two-photon quantum Rabi model in a\ntrapped-ion setting based on a continuous dynamical decoupling scheme. In this\nmanner the magnetic dephasing noise, which is identified as the main obstacle\nto achieve long time coherent dynamics in ion-trap simulators, can be safely\neliminated. More specifically, we investigate the ultrastrong coupling regime\nof the two-photon quantum Rabi model whose realization in trapped ions involves\nsecond-order sideband processes. Hence, the resulting dynamics becomes\nunavoidably slow and more exposed to magnetic noise requiring an appropriate\nscheme for its elimination. Furthermore, we discuss how dynamical decoupling\nmethods take a dual role in our protocol, namely they remove the main source of\ndecoherence from the dynamics while actively define the parameter regime of the\nsimulated model.\n", "  We present the first measurements of tritium beta-decay spectrum in the\nelectron energy range 16-18.6 keV. The goal is to find distortions which may\ncorrespond to the presence of a heavy sterile neutrinos. A possible\ncontribution of this kind would manifest itself as a kink in the spectrum with\na similar shape but with end point shifted by the value of a heavy neutrino\nmass. We set a new upper limits to the neutrino mixing matrix element U^2_{e4}\nwhich improve existing limits by a factor from 2 to 5 in the mass range 0.1-2\nkeV.\n", "  We study the partition function of the six-vertex model in the rational limit\non arbitrary Baxter lattices with reflecting boundary. Every such lattice is\ninterpreted as an invariant of the twisted Yangian. This identification allows\nus to relate the partition function of the vertex model to the Bethe wave\nfunction of an open spin chain. We obtain the partition function in terms of\ncreation operators on a reference state from the algebraic Bethe ansatz and as\na sum of permutations and reflections from the coordinate Bethe ansatz.\n", "  Near the Curie temperature the anisotropy field of magnetically uniaxial L10\nFePt is expected to follow the scaling law $(1-T/Tc)^\\beta$ where $T$ is the\ntemperature and $T_c$ the Curie temperature. In the literature $\\beta$ values\nbetween 0.36 and 0.65 have been reported. Based on recording measurements and\nmicromagnetic analysis, we show that only the values of $\\beta$ near the low\nend of the reported range are compatible with the data. We also conclude that\nthermally activated magnetization reversal at temperatures near $T_c$ cannot be\nignored, even at time scales smaller than 1 ns. We demonstrate that thermally\nactivated magnetization reversal at temperatures close to $T_c$ is well\ndescribed by conventional theory with a frequency factor $f_0$ of the order of\n$10^{12}$ Hz. It is reasoned that the unusually high value for $f_0$ is a\nconsequence of the temperature-induced reduction of the degree of alignment of\nthe micro-spins within the grains.\n", "  We show theoretically and numerically that dichromatic pumping of a nonlinear\nmicroresonator by two continuous wave coherent optical pumps creates an optical\nlattice trap that results in the localization of intra-cavity Kerr solitons\nwith soliton positions defined by the beat frequency of the pumps. This\nphenomenon corresponds to the stabilization of the Kerr frequency comb\nrepetition rate. The locking of the second pump, through adiabatic tuning of\nits frequency, to the comb generated by the first pump allows transitioning to\nsingle-soliton states, manipulating the position of Kerr solitons in the\ncavity, and tuning the frequency comb repetition rate within the locking range.\nIt also explains soliton crystal formation in resonators supporting a\ndispersive wave emitted as a result of higher-order group velocity dispersion\nor avoided mode crossing. We show that dichromatic pumping by externally\nstabilized pumps can be utilized for stabilization of microresonator-based\noptical frequency combs when the comb span does not cover an octave or a\nsignificant fraction thereof and standard self-referencing techniques cannot be\nemployed. Our findings have significant ramifications for high-precision\napplications of optical frequency combs in spectrally pure signal generation,\nmetrology, and timekeeping.\n", "  We report the success in introducing Mn into (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe\nsuperconducting crystals by applying two different hydrothermal routes, ion\nexchange (1-Step) and ion release/introduction (2-Step). The micro-region x-ray\ndiffraction and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses indicate that the\nMn has been doped into the lattice, and its content in the 1-Step fabricated\nsample is higher than that in the 2-Step one. Magnetic susceptibility and\nelectric transport properties reveal that Mn doping influences little on the\nsuperconducting transition, regardless of 1-Step or 2-Step routes. By contrast,\nthe characteristic temperature, T*, where the negative Hall coefficient reaches\nits minimum, is significantly reduced by Mn doping. This implies that the\nreduction of the hole carriers contribution is obviously modified, and hence\nthe hole band might have no direct relationship with the superconductivity in\n(Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe superconductors. Our present hydrothermal methods of ion\nexchange and ion release/introduction provide an efficient way for elements\nsubstitution/doping into (Li1-xFex)OHFe1-ySe superconductors, which will\npromote the in-depth investigations on the role of multiple electron and hole\nbands and their interplay with the high-temperature superconductivity in the\nFeSe-based superconductors.\n", "  The non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 with its vector\nrepresentation leads to equation of motions for the fields graviton, three\nform, six form, dual graviton and the level four fields which correctly\ndescribe the degree of freedom of eleven dimensional supergravity at the\nlinearised level. The equations with one derivative generically hold as\nequivalence relations and are often duality relations. From these equations, by\ntaking derivatives, one can derive equations that are equations of motion of\nthe familiar kind. The entire hierarchy of equations is E11 invariant and the\nconstruction does not require any steps beyond E11. We review these past\ndevelopments with an emphasis on the features that have been overlooked in\nhep-th:1703.01305, whose alternative approach we also comment on.\n", "  The Farr-Bertillon law states that the mortality rate of single and widowed\npersons is about three times the rate of married people of same age. This\nexcess mortality can be measured with good accuracy for all ages except for\nyoung widowers. The reason is that, at least nowadays, very few people become\nwidowed under the age of 30. Here we show that disability data from census\nrecords can also be used as a reliable substitute for mortality rates. In fact\nexcess-disability and excess-mortality go hand in hand. Moreover, as there are\nabout ten times more cases of disability than deaths, the disability variable\nis able to offer more accurate measurements in all cases where the number of\ndeaths is small. This allows a more accurate investigation of the young widower\neffect; it confirms that, as already suspected from death rate data, there is a\nhuge spike between the ages of 20 and 30. By using disability rates we can also\nstudy additional features not accessible using death rate data. For example we\ncan examine the health impact of a change in living place. The observed\ntemporary inflated disability rate confirms what could be expected by invoking\nthe \"Transient Shock\" conjecture formulated by the authors in a previous paper.\n", "  We will make the case that \\textit{pedal coordinates} (instead of polar or\nCartesian coordinates) are more natural settings in which to study force\nproblems of classical mechanics in the plane. We will show that the trajectory\nof a test particle under the influence of central and Lorentz-like forces can\nbe translated into pedal coordinates at once without the need of solving any\ndifferential equation. This will allow us to generalize Newton theorem of\nrevolving orbits to include nonlocal transforms of curves. Finally, we apply\ndeveloped methods to solve the \"dark Kepler problem\", i.e. central force\nproblem where in addition to the central body, gravitational influences of dark\nmatter and dark energy are assumed.\n", "  We present a systematic investigation of the possible molecular states\ncomposed of a pair of doubly charmed baryons ($\\Xi_{cc}\\Xi_{cc}$) or one doubly\ncharmed baryon and one doubly charmed antibaryon $(\\Xi_{cc}\\bar{\\Xi}_{cc})$\nwithin the framework of the one-boson-exchange-potential model. For the\nspin-triplet systems, we take into account the mixing between the ${}^3S_1$ and\n${}^3D_1$ channels. For the baryon-baryon system $\\Xi_{cc}\\Xi_{cc}$ with $(R,I)\n= (\\bar{3}, 1/2)$ and $(\\bar{3}, 0)$, where $R$ and $I$ represent the group\nrepresentation and the isospin of the system, respectively, there exist loosely\nbound molecular states. For the baryon-antibaryon system\n$\\Xi_{cc}\\bar{\\Xi}_{cc}$ with $(R,I) = (8, 1)$, $(8, 1/2)$ and $(8,0)$, there\nalso exist deuteron-like molecules. The $B_{cc}\\bar{B}_{cc}$ molecular states\nmay be produced at LHC. The proximity of their masses to the threshold of two\ndoubly charmed baryons provides a clean clue to identify them.\n", "  Most studies suggest the pollution of white dwarf (WD) atmospheres arises\nfrom accretion of minor planets, but the exact properties of polluting\nmaterial, and in particular the evidence for water in some cases are not yet\nunderstood. Here we study the water retention of small icy bodies in exo-solar\nplanetary systems, as their respective host stars evolve through and off the\nmain sequence and eventually become WDs. We explore for the first time a wide\nrange of star masses and metallicities. We find that the mass of the WD\nprogenitor star is of crucial importance for the retention of water, while its\nmetallicity is relatively unimportant. We predict that minor planets around\nlower-mass WD progenitors would retain more water in general, and would do so\nat closer distances from the WD, compared with high-mass progenitors. The\ndependence of water retention on progenitor mass and other parameters has\ndirect implications for the origin of observed WD pollution, and we discuss how\nour results and predictions might be tested in the future as more observations\nof WDs with long cooling-ages become available.\n", "  High-mass stars have generally been assumed to accrete most of their mass\nwhile already contracted onto the main sequence, but this hypothesis has not\nbeen observationally tested. We present ALMA observations of a 3 x 1.5 pc area\nin the W51 high-mass star-forming complex. We identify dust continuum sources\nand measure the gas and dust temperature through both rotational diagram\nmodeling of CH3OH and brightness-temperature-based limits. The observed region\ncontains three high-mass YSOs that appear to be at the earliest stages of their\nformation, with no signs of ionizing radiation from their central sources. The\ndata reveal high gas and dust temperatures (T > 100 K) extending out to about\n5000 AU from each of these sources. There are no clear signs of disks or\nrotating structures down to our 1000 AU resolution. The extended warm gas\nprovides evidence that, during the process of forming, these high-mass stars\nheat a large volume and correspondingly large mass of gas in their\nsurroundings, inhibiting fragmentation and therefore keeping a large reservoir\navailable to feed from. By contrast, the more mature massive stars that\nilluminate compact H ii regions have little effect on their surrounding dense\ngas, suggesting that these main sequence stars have completed most or all of\ntheir accretion. The high luminosity of the massive protostars (L > 10^4 solar\nluminosities), combined with a lack of centimeter continuum emission from these\nsources, implies that they are not on the main sequence while they accrete the\nmajority of their mass; instead, they may be bloated and cool.\n", "  First, we present a concise glossary of formulas for composition of standard,\ncumulant, factorial, and factorial cumulant moments in superposition (compound)\nmodels, where final particles are created via independent emission from a\ncollection of sources. Explicit mathematical formulas for the composed moments\nare given to all orders. We discuss the composition laws for various types of\nmoments via the generating-function methods and list the formulas for the\nunfolding of the unwanted fluctuations. Second, the technique is applied to the\ndifference of the scaled multiplicities of two particle types. This allows us\nfor a systematic derivation and a simple algebraic interpretation of the\nso-called strongly intensive fluctuation measures. With the help of the\nformalism we obtain several new strongly intensive measures involving\nhigher-rank moments. The reviewed as well as the new results may be useful in\ninvestigations of mechanisms of particle production and event-by-event\nfluctuations in high-energy nuclear and hadronic collisions, and in particular\nin the search for signatures of the QCD phase transition at a finite baryon\ndensity.\n", "  We present expressions for the magnetoconductivity and the magnetoresistance\nof a strongly interacting metal in 3+1 dimensions, derivable from relativistic\nhydrodynamics. Such an approach is suitable for ultraclean metals with emergent\nLorentz invariance. When this relativistic fluid contains chiral anomalies, it\nis known to exhibit longitudinal negative magnetoresistance. We show that\nsimilar effects can arise in non-anomalous relativistic fluids due to the\ndistinctive gradient expansion. In contrast with a Galilean-invariant fluid,\nthe resistivity tensor of a dirty relativistic fluid exhibits similar angular\ndependence to negative magnetoresistance, even when the constitutive relations\nand momentum relaxation rate are isotropic. We further account for the effect\nof magnetic field-dependent corrections to the gradient expansion and the\neffects of long-wavelength impurities on magnetoresistance. We note that the\nholographic D3/D7 system exhibits negative magnetoresistance.\n", "  Based on published data, we have produced a sample of planetary nebulae (PNe)\nthat is complete within 2 kpc of the Sun. We have estimated the total number of\nPNe in the Galaxy from this sample to be 17000+/-3000 and determined the\nvertical scale height of the thin disk based on an exponential density\ndistribution to be 197+/-10 pc. The next sample includes PNe from the\nStanghellini-Haywood catalog with minor additions. For this purpose, we have\nused about 200 PNe with Peimbert's types I, II, and III. In this case, we have\nobtained a considerably higher value of the vertical scale height that\nincreases noticeably with sample radius. We have experimentally found that it\nis necessary to reduce the distance scale of this catalog approximately by 20%.\nThen, for example, for PNe with heliocentric distances less than 4 kpc the\nvertical scale height is 256+/-12 kpc. A kinematic analysis has confirmed the\nnecessity of such a reduction of the distance scale.\n", "  We report the discovery of a microlensing planet --- MOA-2016-BLG-227Lb ---\nwith a large planet/host mass ratio of $q \\simeq 9 \\times 10^{-3}$. This event\nwas located near the $K2$ Campaign 9 field that was observed by a large number\nof telescopes. As a result, the event was in the microlensing survey area of a\nnumber of these telescopes, and this enabled good coverage of the planetary\nlight curve signal. High angular resolution adaptive optics images from the\nKeck telescope reveal excess flux at the position of the source above the flux\nof the source star, as indicated by the light curve model. This excess flux\ncould be due to the lens star, but it could also be due to a companion to the\nsource or lens star, or even an unrelated star. We consider all these\npossibilities in a Bayesian analysis in the context of a standard Galactic\nmodel. Our analysis indicates that it is unlikely that a large fraction of the\nexcess flux comes from the lens, unless solar type stars are much more likely\nto host planets of this mass ratio than lower mass stars. We recommend that a\nmethod similar to the one developed in this paper be used for other events with\nhigh angular resolution follow-up observations when the follow-up observations\nare insufficient to measure the lens-source relative proper motion.\n", "  We revisit the various approximations employed to study the long-term\nevolution of the magnetic field in neutron star cores and discuss their\nlimitations and possible improvements. A recent controversy on the correct form\nof the induction equation and the relevant evolution timescale in\nsuperconducting neutron star cores is addressed and clarified. We show that\nthis ambiguity in the estimation of timescales arises as a consequence of\nnominally large terms that appear in the induction equation, but which are, in\nfact, mostly irrotational. This subtlety leads to a discrepancy by many orders\nof magnitude when velocity fields are absent or ignored. Even when internal\nvelocity fields are accounted for, only the solenoidal part of the electric\nfield contributes to the induction equation, which can be substantially smaller\nthan the irrotational part. We also argue that stationary velocity fields must\nbe incorporated in the slow evolution of the magnetic field as the next level\nof approximation.\n", "  We analyze geometric terms and scaling properties of the Shannon mutual\ninformation in the continuum. This is done for a free massless scalar field\ntheory in $d$-dimensions, in a coherent state reduced with respect to a general\ndifferentiable manifold. As a by-product, we find an expression for the reduced\nprobability density of finding a certain field on a ball. We will also\nintroduce and compute the Fisher information that this probability carries\nabout the location of the observation region. This is an interesting\ninformation measure that refers to points in physical space, although in\nrelativistic QFT they are labels and not fluctuating quantum observables.\n", "  The center-of-mass motion of a single optically levitated nanoparticle\nresembles three uncoupled harmonic oscillators. We show how a suitable\nmodulation of the optical trapping potential can give rise to a coupling\nbetween two of these oscillators, such that their dynamics are governed by a\nclassical equation of motion that resembles the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a\ntwo-level system. Based on experimental data, we illustrate the dynamics of\nthis parametrically coupled system both in the frequency and in the time\ndomain. We discuss the limitations and differences of the mechanical analogue\nin comparison to a true quantum mechanical system.\n", "  We study the one-loop effective action for $6D,$ ${\\cal N}=(1,0)$\nsupersymmetric Yang--Mills (SYM) theory with hypermultiplets and $6D,$ ${\\cal\nN}=(1,1)$ SYM theory as a subclass of the former, using the off-shell\nformulation of these theories in $6D,$ ${\\cal N}=(1,0)$ harmonic superspace. We\ndevelop the corresponding supergraph technique and apply it to compute the\none-loop divergences in the background field method ensuring the manifest gauge\ninvariance. We calculate the two-point Green functions of the gauge superfield\nand the hypermultiplet, as well as the three-point gauge-hypermultipet Green\nfunction. Using these Green functions and exploiting gauge invariance of the\ntheory, we find the full set of the off-shell one-loop divergent contributions,\nincluding the logarithmic and power ones. Our results precisely match with\nthose obtained earlier in [1,2] within the proper time superfield method.\n", "  We investigate manifestations of topological order in monoaxial helimagnet\nCr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ by performing transport measurements on ultra-thin crystals.\nUpon sweeping the magnetic field perpendicularly to the helical axis, crystals\nthicker than one helix pitch (48 nm) but much thinner than the magnetic domain\nsize ($\\sim$1 $\\mu$m) are found to exhibit sharp and hysteretic resistance\njumps. We show that these phenomena originate from transitions between\ntopological sectors with different number of magnetic solitons. This is\nconfirmed by measurements on crystals thinner than 48 nm --in which the\ntopological sector cannot change-- that do not exhibit any jump or hysteresis.\nOur results show the ability to deterministically control the topological\nsector of finite-size Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ and to detect inter-sector transitions\nby transport measurements.\n", "  A straightforward means to include explicit hydrogen bonds within the\nUniversal Force Field is presented. Instead of treating hydrogen bonds as\nnon-bonded interaction subjected to electrostatic and Lennard-Jones potentials,\nwe introduce an explicit bond with negligible bond order, thus maintaining the\nstructural integrity of the H-bonded complexes and avoiding the necessity to\nassign arbitrary charges to the system. The explicit hydrogen bond changes the\ncoordination number of the acceptor site and the approach is thus most suitable\nfor systems with under-coordinated atoms, such as many metal-organic\nframeworks, however, it also shows excellent performance for other systems\ninvolving a hydrogen-bonded framework. In particular, it is an excellent means\nfor creating starting structures for molecular dynamics and for investigations\nemploying more sophisticated methods.\n  The approach is validated for the hydrogen bonded complexes in the S22\ndataset and then employed for a set of metal-organic frameworks from the\nComputation-Ready Experimental (CoRE) database and several hydrogen bonded\ncrystals including water ice and clathrates. We show that direct inclusion of\nhydrogen bonds reduces the maximum error in predicted cell parameters from 66%\nto only 14% and the mean unsigned error is similarly reduced from 14% to only\n4%. We posit that with the inclusion of hydrogen bonding, the solvent-mediated\nbreathing of frameworks such as MIL-53 is now accessible to rapid UFF\ncalculations, which will further the aim of rapid computational scanning of\nmetal-organic frameworks while providing better starting points for electronic\nstructure calculations.\n", "  The dimensional-deconstruction prescription of Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, Kaplan,\nKarch and Motl provides a mechanism for recovering the $A$-type (2,0) theories\non $T^2$, starting from a four-dimensional $\\mathcal N=2$ circular-quiver\ntheory. We put this conjecture to the test using two exact-counting arguments:\nIn the decompactification limit, we compare the Higgs-branch Hilbert series of\nthe 4D $\\mathcal N=2$ quiver to the \"half-BPS\" limit of the (2,0)\nsuperconformal index. We also compare the full partition function for the 4D\nquiver on $S^4$ to the (2,0) partition function on $S^4 \\times T^2$. In both\ncases we find exact agreement. The partition function calculation sets up a\ndictionary between exact results in 4D and 6D.\n", "  We demonstrate patterned growth of epitaxial yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin\nfilms using lithographically defined templates on gadolinium gallium garnet\n(GGG) substrates. The fabricated YIG nanostructures yield the desired\ncrystallographic orientation, excellent surface morphology, and narrow\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth (~ 4 Oe). Shape-induced magnetic\nanisotropy is clearly observed in a patterned array of nanobars engineered to\nexhibit the larger coercivity (40 Oe) compared with that of continuous films.\nBoth hysteresis loop and angle-dependent FMR spectra measurements indicate that\nthe easy axis aligns along the longitudinal direction of the nanobars, with an\neffective anisotropy field of 195 Oe. Our work overcomes difficulties in\npatterning YIG thin films and provides an effective means to control their\nmagnetic properties and magnetic bias conditions.\n", "  A tensor-type cosmological perturbation, defined as a transverse and\ntraceless spatial fluctuation, is often interpreted as the gravitational waves.\nWhile decoupled from the scalar-type perturbations in linear order, the tensor\nperturbations can be sourced from the scalar-type in the nonlinear order. The\ntensor perturbations generated by the quadratic combination of linear\nscalar-type cosmological perturbation are widely studied in the literature, but\nall previous studies are based on zero-shear gauge without proper\njustification. Here, we show that, being second order in perturbation, such an\ninduced tensor perturbation is generically gauge dependent. In particular, the\ngravitational wave power spectrum depends on the hypersurface (temporal gauge)\ncondition taken for the linear scalar perturbation. We further show that,\nduring the matter-dominated era, the induced tensor modes dominate over the\nlinearly evolved primordial gravitational waves amplitude for\n$k\\gtrsim10^{-2}~[h/{\\rm Mpc}]$ even for the gauge that gives lowest induced\ntensor modes with the optimistic choice of primordial gravitational waves\n($r=0.1$). The induced tensor modes, therefore, must be modeled correctly\nspecific to the observational strategy for the measurement of primordial\ngravitational waves from large-scale structure via, for example, parity-odd\nmode of weak gravitational lensing, or clustering fossils.\n", "  The survey of the mid-infrared sky by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) led to the discovery of extremely cold low-mass brown dwarfs, classified\nas Y dwarfs, which extend the T class to lower temperatures. Twenty-four Y\ndwarfs are known at the time of writing. Here we present improved parallaxes\nfor four of these, determined using Spitzer images. We give new photometry for\nfour late-type T and three Y dwarfs, and new spectra of three Y dwarfs,\nobtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present previously unpublished\nphotometry taken from HST, ESO, Spitzer and WISE archives of 11 late-type T and\n9 Y dwarfs. The near-infrared data are put on to the same photometric system,\nforming a homogeneous data set for the coolest brown dwarfs. We compare recent\nmodels to our photometric and spectroscopic data set. We confirm that\nnon-equilibrium atmospheric chemistry is important for these objects.\nNon-equilibrium cloud-free models reproduce well the near-infrared spectra and\nmid-infrared photometry for the warmer Y dwarfs with 425 <= T_eff K <= 450. A\nsmall amount of cloud cover may improve the model fits in the near-infrared for\nthe Y dwarfs with 325 <= T_eff K <= 375. Neither cloudy nor cloud-free models\nreproduce the near-infrared photometry for the T_eff = 250 K Y dwarf W0855. We\nuse the mid-infrared region, where most of the flux originates, to constrain\nour models of W0855. We find that W0855 likely has a mass of 1.5 - 8 Jupiter\nmasses and an age of 0.3 - 6 Gyr. The Y dwarfs with measured parallaxes are\nwithin 20 pc of the Sun and have tangential velocities typical of the thin\ndisk. The metallicities and ages we derive for the sample are generally\nsolar-like. We estimate that the known Y dwarfs are 3 to 20 Jupiter-mass\nobjects with ages of 0.6 to 8.5 Gyr.\n", "  We compare various ways of decomposing and decompactifying the string field\ntheory vertex and analyze the relations between them. We formulate axioms for\nthe octagon and show how it can be glued to reproduce the decompactified\npp-wave SFT vertex which in turn can be glued to recover the exact finite\nvolume pp-wave Neumann coefficients. The gluing is performed by resumming\nmultiple wrapping corrections. We observe important nontrivial contributions at\nthe multiple wrapping level which are crucial for obtaining the exact results.\n", "  Iodine (I$_2$) molecules embedded in He nanodroplets are aligned by a 160 ps\nlong laser pulse. The highest degree of alignment, occurring at the peak of the\npulse and quantified by $\\langle \\cos^2 \\theta_{2D} \\rangle$, is measured as a\nfunction of the laser intensity. The results are well described by $\\langle\n\\cos^2 \\theta_{2D} \\rangle$ calculated for a gas of isolated molecules each\nwith an effective rotational constant of 0.6 times the gas-phase value, and at\na temperature of 0.4 K. Theoretical analysis using the angulon quasiparticle to\ndescribe rotating molecules in superfluid helium rationalizes why the alignment\nmechanism is similar to that of isolated molecules with an effective rotational\nconstant. A major advantage of molecules in He droplets is that their 0.4 K\ntemperature leads to stronger alignment than what can generally be achieved for\ngas phase molecules -- here demonstrated by a direct comparison of the droplet\nresults to measurements on a $\\sim$ 1 K supersonic beam of isolated molecules.\nThis point is further illustrated for more complex system by measurements on\n1,4-diiodobenzene and 1,4-dibromobenzene. For all three molecular species\nstudied the highest values of $\\langle \\cos^2 \\theta_{2D} \\rangle$ achieved in\nHe droplets exceed 0.96.\n", "  High-quality crystalline FeSe is successfully synthesized in 5 minutes by an\nelectrochemical deposition technique via increasing the solution temperature.\nThe synthesis of FeSe have been controlled by the applied voltage, synthesis\ntime and pH value. The obtained samples were summarized as a phase diagram at\neach temperature and applied voltage. The best synthesis temperature to produce\nhigh-quality crystalline samples was found to be 70{\\deg}C.\n", "  We present a dynamical cosmological solution that simultaneously accounts for\nthe early inflationary stage of the Universe and solves the supersymmetric\nlittle hierarchy problem via the relaxion mechanism. First, we consider an\ninflationary potential arising from the $D$-term of a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry\nwith a Fayet--Iliopolous term, that is independent of the relaxion. A\ntechnically natural, small $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $g\\lesssim 10^{-8}$, allows\nfor a low Hubble scale of inflation, $H_I\\lesssim 10^5$ GeV, which is shown to\nbe consistent with Planck data. This feature is then used to realize a\nsupersymmetric two-field relaxion mechanism, where the second field is\nidentified as the inflaton provided that $H_I\\lesssim 10$ GeV. The inflaton\ncontrols the relaxion barrier height allowing the relaxion to evolve in the\nearly Universe and scan the supersymmetric soft masses. After electroweak\nsymmetry is broken, the relaxion settles at a local supersymmetry-breaking\nminimum with a range of $F$-term values that can naturally explain\nsupersymmetric soft mass scales up to $10^6$ GeV.\n", "  The Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) orbiting the supermassive black hole (Sgr\nA*) in the Galactic centre has been monitored in both near-infrared continuum\nand line emission. There has been a dispute about the character and the\ncompactness of the object: interpreting it as either a gas cloud or a\ndust-enshrouded star. A recent analysis of polarimetry data in $K_{\\rm s}$-band\n($2.2\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$) allows us to put further constraints on the geometry of\nthe DSO. The purpose of this paper is to constrain the nature and the geometry\nof the DSO. We compare 3D radiative transfer models of the DSO with the NIR\ncontinuum data including polarimetry. In the analysis, we use basic dust\ncontinuum radiative transfer theory implemented in the 3D Monte Carlo code\nHyperion. Moreover, we implement analytical results of the two-body problem\nmechanics and the theory of non-thermal processes. We present a composite model\nof the DSO -- a dust-enshrouded star that consists of a stellar source, dusty,\noptically thick envelope, bipolar cavities, and a bow shock. This scheme can\nmatch the NIR total as well as polarized properties of the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED). The SED may be also explained in theory by a young\npulsar wind nebula that typically exhibits a large linear polarization degree\ndue to magnetospheric synchrotron emission. The analysis of NIR polarimetry\ndata combined with the radiative transfer modelling shows that the DSO is a\npeculiar source of compact nature in the S cluster $(r \\lesssim 0.04\\,{\\rm\npc})$. It is most probably a young stellar object embedded in a non-spherical\ndusty envelope, whose components include optically thick dusty envelope,\nbipolar cavities, and a bow shock. Alternatively, the continuum emission could\nbe of a non-thermal origin due to the presence of a young neutron star and its\nwind nebula.\n", "  We use the Slovak and Czech video meteor observations, as well as video\nmeteoroid orbits collected in the CAMS, SonotaCo, EDMOND and DMS catalogues,\nfor an analysis of the distribution of meteoroid orbits within the stream of\nthe Geminids and of the dispersion of their radiants. We concentrate on the\ninfluence of the measurement errors on the precision of the orbits obtained\nfrom the video networks that are based on various meteor-detection software\npackages and various meteor orbital element softwares. The observed orbital\ndispersions in the Geminid stream described by the median absolute deviation\nrange from 0.029 to 0.042 1/AU for the video catalogues. The distribution of\nthe semi-major axes of video meteors in all the databases, except for the\nOndrejov (Czech) data, seem to be systematically biased in comparison with the\nphotographic and radio meteors. The determined velocities of the video data are\nunderestimated, probably as a consequence of the methods used for the\npositional and velocity measurements. The largest shift is observed in the\nEDMOND and SonotaCo catalogues. Except for the measurement errors which\ninfluence the analyses and their interpretations, we also point out the problem\nof the uncertainties of the numerical integration procedures that influence the\nsimulations' results. Several experimental integrations of the Geminids parent\nasteroid, which we performed from the present to the past and then back to the\nyear 2015, showed that a complete reproduction, including also the mean\nanomaly, is only possible for a time span of about 2700 years.\n", "  Polysaccharides (carbohydrates) are key regulators of a large number of cell\nbiological processes. However, precise biochemical or genetic manipulation of\nthese often complex structures is laborious and hampers experimental\nstructure-function studies. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide a\nvaluable alternative tool to generate and test hypotheses on saccharide\nfunction. Yet, currently used MD force fields often overestimate the\naggregation propensity of polysaccharides, affecting the usability of those\nsimulations. Here we tested MARTINI, a popular coarse-grained (CG) force field\nfor biological macromolecules, for its ability to accurately represent\nmolecular forces between saccharides. To this end, we calculated a\nthermodynamic solution property, the second virial coefficient of the osmotic\npressure ($B_{22}$). Comparison with light scattering experiments revealed a\nnon-physical aggregation of a prototypical polysaccharide in MARTINI, pointing\nat an imbalance of the non-bonded solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water\ninteractions. This finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were\nall found to aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well\nbelow their solubility limit. Finally, we explored the influence of the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) interaction between saccharide molecules and propose a\nsimple scaling of the LJ interaction strength that makes MARTINI more reliable\nfor the simulation of saccharides.\n", "  We report a high temperature (T = 0.3K) indicator of the excitation gap\n$\\Delta_{5/2}$ at the filling factor $ \\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall state\nin ultra-high quality AlGaAs/GaAs two-dimensional electron gases. As the lack\nof correlation between mobility $\\mu$ and $\\Delta_{5/2}$ has been well\nestablished in previous experiments, we define, analyze and discuss the utility\nof a different metric $\\rho_{5/2}$, the resistivity at $\\nu=5/2$, as a high\ntemperature predictor of $\\Delta_{5/2}$. This high-field resistivity reflects\nthe scattering rate of composite fermions. Good correlation between\n$\\rho_{5/2}$ and $\\Delta_{5/2}$ is observed in both a density tunable device\nand in a series of identically structured wafers with similar density but\nvastly different mobility. This correlation can be explained by the fact that\nboth $\\rho_{5/2}$ and $\\Delta_{5/2}$ are sensitive to long-range disorder from\nremote impurities, while $\\mu$ is sensitive primarily to disorder localized\nnear the quantum well.\n", "  A model of the optical media with a spatially structured Kerr nonlinearity is\nintroduced. The nonlinearity strength is modulated by a set of singular peaks\non top of a self-focusing or defocusing uniform background. The peaks may\ninclude a repulsive or attractive linear potential too. We find that a pair of\nmutually symmetric peaks readily gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking (SSB) of modes pinned to individual peaks, while antisymmetric pinned\nmodes are always unstable, transforming into robust spatially odd breathers.\nThree- and five-peak structures support symmetric modes, with in-phase or\ntwisted profiles, and do not give rise to asymmetric states. A stability area\nis found for the twisted states pinned to the triple peaks, while the\ncorresponding in-phase modes are unstable, unless the three modulation peaks\nare set very close to each other, covered by a single-peak pinned mode. All\npatterns pinned to five peaks are unstable too. Collisions of moving solitons\nwith the singular-modulation peak are studied too. Slowly moving solitons\nbounce back from the peak, while the collisions are quasi-elastic for fast\nsolitons. In the intermediate case, the soliton is destroyed by the collision.\nIn a special case, the condition of a resonance of the incident soliton with a\ntrapped mode supported by the peak leads to capture of the soliton.\n", "  We construct the effective action for toroidal compactifications of bosonic\nstring theory from generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions of double field\ntheory. The enhanced gauge symmetry arising at special points in moduli space\nis incorporated into this framework by promoting the $O(k,k)$ duality group of\n$k$-tori compactifications to $O(n,n)$, $n$ being the dimension of the enhanced\ngauge group, which allows to account for the full massless sector of the\ntheory. We show that the effective action reproduces the right masses of scalar\nand vector fields when moving sligthly away from the points of maximal symmetry\nenhancement. The neighborhood of the enhancement points in moduli space can be\nneatly explored by spontaneous symmetry breaking. We generically discuss\ntoroidal compactifications of arbitrary dimensions and maximally enhanced gauge\ngroups, and then inspect more closely the example of $T^2$ at the $SU(3)_L\n\\times SU(3)_R$ point, which is the simplest setup containing all the non\ntrivialities of the generic case. We show that the entire moduli space can be\ndescribed in a unified way by considering compactifications on higher\ndimensional tori.\n", "  The phase diagram (pressure versus temperature) of the pure fluid is\ntypically envisioned as being featureless apart from the presence of the\nliquid-vapor coexistence curve terminating at the critical point. However, a\nnumber of recent authors have proposed that this simple picture misses\nimportant features, such as the Widom line, the Fisher-Widom line, and the\nFrenkel line. In our paper we discuss another way of augmenting the pure fluid\nphase diagram, lines of zero thermodynamic curvature $R=0$ separating regimes\nof fluid solid-like behavior ($R>0$) from gas-like or liquid-like behavior\n($R<0$). We systematically evaluate $R$ for the $121$ pure fluids in the\nNIST/REFPROP (version 9.1) fluid database near the saturated vapor line from\nthe triple point to the critical point. Our specific goal was to identify\nregions of positive $R$ abutting the saturated vapor line (\"feature D\"). We\nfound: a) $97/121$ of the NIST/REFPROP fluids have feature D. b) The presence\nand character of feature D correlates with molecular complexity, taken to be\nthe number of atoms $Q$ per molecule. c) The solid-like properties of feature D\nmight be attributable to a mesoscopic model based on correlations among\ncoordinated spinning molecules, a model that might be testable with computer\nsimulations. d) There are a number of correlations between thermodynamic\nquantities, including the acentric factor $\\omega$, but we found little\nexplicit correlation between $\\omega$ and the shape of a molecule. e) Feature D\nseriously constrains the size of the asymptotic fluid critical point regime,\npossibly resolving a long-standing mystery about why these are so small. f)\nFeature D correlates roughly with regimes of anomalous sound propagation.\n", "  We present results from our Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI\nobservations of the Arp 305 system. The system consists of two interacting\nspiral galaxies NGC 4016 and NGC 4017, a large amount of resultant tidal debris\nand a prominent tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidate projected within the tidal\nbridge between the two principal galaxies. Our higher resolution GMRT HI\nmapping, compared to previous observations, allowed detailed study of smaller\nscale features. Our HI analysis supports the conclusion in Hancock et al.\n(2009) that the most recent encounter between the pair occurred $\\sim$ 4\n$\\times$ 10$^8$ yrs ago. The GMRT observations also show HI features near NGC\n4017 which may be remnants of an earlier encounter between the two galaxies.\nThe HI properties of the Bridge TDG candidate include: M(HI) $\\sim$ 6.6\n$\\times$ 10$^8$ msolar and V(HI) = 3500$\\pm$ 7 km/s, which is in good agreement\nwith the velocities of the parent galaxies. Additionally the TDG's HI linewidth\nof 30 km/s and a modest velocity gradient together with its SFR of 0.2\nmsolar/yr add to the evidence favouring the bridge candidate being a genuine\nTDG. The Bridge TDG's \\textit{Spitzer} 3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m counterparts\nwith a [3.6]--[4.5] colour $\\sim$ -0.2 mag suggests stellar debris may have\nseeded its formation. Future spectroscopic observations could confirm this\nformation scenario and provide the metallicity which is a key criteria for the\nvalidation for TDG candidates.\n", "  Aims. ESO 243-49 HLX-1, otherwise known as HLX-1, is an intermediate mass\nblack hole (IMBH) candidate located 8\" (3.7 Kpc) from the centre of the edge-on\nS0 galaxy ESO 243-49. How the black hole came to be associated with this\ngalaxy, and the nature of the environment in which it resides, are still\nunclear. Using multi-wavelength observations we investigate the nature of the\nmedium surrounding HLX-1, search for evidence of past mergers with ESO 243-49\nand constrain parameters of the galaxy. Methods. We reduce and analyse integral\nfield unit observations of ESO 243-49 that were taken with the MUSE instrument\non the VLT. Using complementary multi-wavelength data, including X-Shooter,\nHST, Swift, Chandra and ATCA data, we further examine the vicinity of HLX-1. We\nadditionally examine the nature of the host galaxy and estimate the mass of the\ncentral supermassive black hole (SMBH) in ESO 243-49. Results. No evidence for\na recent minor-merger that could result in the presence of the IMBH is\ndiscerned, but the data are compatible with a scenario in which minor mergers\nmay have occurred in the history of ESO 243-49. The MUSE data reveal a rapidly\nrotating disc in the centre of the galaxy, around the SMBH. The mass of the\nSMBH at the centre of ESO 243-49 is estimated to be 0.5-23 $\\times$ 10$^7$\nM$_\\odot$. Studying the spectra of HLX-1, that were taken in the low/hard\nstate, we determine H$_\\alpha$ flux variability to be at least a factor 6,\ncompared to observations taken during the high/soft state. This H$_\\alpha$ flux\nvariability over one year indicates that the line originates close to the IMBH,\nexcluding the possibility that the line emanates from a surrounding nebula or a\nstar cluster. The large variability associated with the X-ray states of HLX-1\nconfirms that the H$_\\alpha$ line is associated with the object and therefore\nvalidates the distance to HLX-1.\n", "  We study driven-dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates in a two-mode Josephson\nsystem, such as a double-well potential, with asymmetrical pumping. We\ninvestigate nonlinear effects on the condensate populations and mode\ntransitions. The generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations are modified in order\nto treat pumping of only a single mode. We characterize the steady-state\nsolutions in such a system as well as criteria for potential trapping of a\ncondensate mode. There are many possible steady-states, with different density\nand/or phase profiles. Transitions between different condensate modes can be\ninduced by varying the parameters of the junction or the initial conditions, or\nby applying external fields.\n", "  We analyze {\\it K2} light curves for 794 low-mass ($1 > M_* > 0.1$\n$M_{\\odot}$) members of the $\\approx$650-Myr-old open cluster Praesepe, and\nmeasure rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for 677 of these stars. We find that half\nof the rapidly rotating $>$0.3 $M_{\\odot}$ stars are confirmed or candidate\nbinary systems. The remaining $>0.3$ $M_{\\odot}$ fast rotators have not been\nsearched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We found\npreviously that nearly all rapidly rotating $>$0.3 $M_{\\odot}$ stars in the\nHyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to\nconfirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different $P_{rot}$\ndistributions. We also compare the observed $P_{rot}$ distribution in Praesepe\nto that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe\nthe clear bimodal $P_{rot}$ distribution predicted by Brown (2014) for $>$0.5\n$M_{\\odot}$ stars at the age of Praesepe, but 0.25$-$0.5 $M_{\\odot}$ stars do\nshow stronger bimodality. In addition, we find that $>$60\\% of early M dwarfs\nin Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al. (2015),\nwhich suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to\nsolar-type stars and fully convective stars. The incompleteness of surveys for\nbinaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models,\nsince the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single\nstars.\n", "  In this work, we use flow visualization and rheometry techniques to study the\ndynamics and evolution of secondary flows in a model wormlike micellar solution\nsheared between concentric cylinders, i.e., in a Taylor-Couette (TC) cell. The\nwormlike micellar solution studied in this work contains cetyltrimethylammonium\nbromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal). This system can be shear banding\nand highly elastic, non-shear banding and moderately elastic, or nearly\nNewtonian as the temperature is varied over a narrow range. The effect of\nelasticity on transitions and instabilities is probed by changing the\ntemperature over a wide range of elasticity (El<< 1, El ~1, and El>>1).\nElasticity is defined as the ratio of the Weissenberg number to the Reynolds\nnumber. For shear banding wormlike micelle solutions where El>> 1, a primary\ntransition from the base Couette flow to stationary vortices that are evenly\nspaced in the axial direction of the shear cell and are characterized by an\nasymptotic wave-length is observed. The dimensionless wave- length at the onset\nof this shear banding transition for CTAB/NaSal system turns out to be much\nlarger than those reported for other shear banding wormlike micelle systems.\nFor the same fluid at a temperature where it shear-thins but does not display\nshear banding, El~1, and for slow ramp speeds, the primary transition is to\ndistinct structures that are not stationary but rather travel in the axial\ndirection. At low elasticity (El<< 1), where the fluid behaves as a nearly\nNewtonian fluid, several transitions from purely azimuthal Couette flow to\nmodified Taylor vortex flows and finally chaotic regimes are documented. The\nbehavior in the shear-banding and non-shear-banding regimes are discussed and\ncompared with results in related systems.\n", "  We present an analysis of the spectral properties observed in X-rays from\nactive galactic nucleus BL Lacertae using RXTE, Suzaku, ASCA, BeppoSAX, and\nSwift observations. The total time covered by these observations is\napproximately 20 years. We show that this source undergoes X-ray spectral\ntransitions from the low hard state (LHS) through the intermediate state (IS)\nto the high soft state (HSS) during these observations. During the RXTE\nobservations (1997 -- 2001, {180 ks, for a total 145 datasets}), the source was\napproximately 75%, 20% and only 5 of the time in the IS, LHS, and HSS,\nrespectively. We also used Swift observations (470 datasets, for a total 800\nks), which occurred during 12 years (2005 -- 2016), the (0.3 -- 200 keV) data\nof BeppoSAX (1997 -- 2000, 160 ks), and the (0.3 -- 10 keV) data of ASCA (1995\n-- 1999, 160 ks). Two observations of Suzaku (2006, 2013; 50 ks) in\ncombinations with long-term RXTE and Swift data-sets allow us to describe all\nspectral states of BL Lac. The spectra of BL Lac are well fitted by the bulk\nmotion Comptonization (BMC) model for all spectral states. We have established\nthe photon index saturation level, Gamma_{sat}=2.2+/-0.1, in the Gamma vs. mass\naccretion rate (Mdot) correlation. This Gamma-Mdot correlation allows us to\nestimate the black-hole (BH) mass in BL Lac to be M_{BH}~3x10^7 M_sol for a\ndistance of 300 Mpc. For the BH mass estimate, we use the scaling method taking\nstellar-mass Galactic BHs 4U~1543--47 and GX~339--4 as reference sources. The\nGamma-Mdot correlation revealed in BL Lac is similar to those in a number of\nstellar-mass Galactic BHs and two recently studied intermediate-mass\nextragalactic BHs. It clearly shows the correlation along with the very\nextended $\\Gamma$ saturation at ~ 2.2. This is robust observational evidence\nfor the presence of a BH in BL Lac.\n", "  The requirement of high rate capability for operation at LHC, led 20 years\nago to the achievement of Resistive Plate Chambers operated in avalanche mode,\nthanks to the introduction of new gas mixtures and to the development of the\nFront-End electronics. The need for a further increase of the rate capability,\nin view of the upgrades of LHC, is imposing new detector geometries with\nthinner gas gaps and electrodes. Streamer operation of RPCs may still be\nsuitable for low rate experiments, and therefore in this paper a comparison\nbetween two different detector geometries, the old standard and the newly\nproposed one, is performed in streamer mode.\n", "  Light scattering is one of the most important elementary processes in\nnear-field optics. We build up the Born series for scattering by dielectric\nbodies with step boundaries. The Green function for a 2-dimensional homogeneous\ndielectric cylinder is obtained. As an example, the formulas are derived for\nscattered field of two parallel cylinders. The polar diagram is shown to agree\nwith numerical calculation by the known methods of discrete dipoles and\nboundary elements.\n", "  We study grand unified models in the five-dimensional space-time where the\nextra dimension is compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. The spontaneous breaking of\nunified gauge symmetries is achieved via vacuum expectation values of the\nextra-dimensional components of gauge fields. We derive one-loop effective\npotentials for the zero modes of the gauge fields in SU(7), SU(8), SO(10), and\n$E_6$ models. In each model, the rank of the residual gauge symmetry that\nrespects the boundary condition imposed at the orbifold fixed points is higher\nthan that of the standard model. We verify that the residual symmetry is broken\nto the standard model gauge symmetry at the global minima of the effective\npotential for certain sets of bulk fermion fields in each model.\n", "  The mass and pole residue of the ground and first radially excited $\n\\Omega_c^{0}$ states with spin-parities $J^{P}=1/2^{+},\\,3/2^{+}$, as well as\nP-wave $\\Omega_c^{0}$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-},\\,3/2^{-}$ are calculated by means of\nthe two-point QCD sum rules. The strong decays of $\\Omega_c^{0}$ baryons are\nalso studied and width of these decay channels are computed. The relevant\ncomputations are performed in the context of the full QCD sum rules on the\nlight-cone. Obtained results for the masses and widths are confronted with\nrecent experimental data of LHCb Collaboration, which allow us to interpret\n$\\Omega_c(3000)^{0}$, $\\Omega_c(3050)^{0}$, and $ \\Omega_c(3119)^{0} $ as the\nexcited $css$ baryons with the quantum numbers $ (1P,\\,1/2^{-})$,\n$(1P,\\,3/2^{-})$, and $(2S,\\,3/2^{+})$, respectively. The $ (2S,\\,1/2^{+})$\nstate can be assigned either to $\\Omega_c(3066)^{0}$ state or\n$\\Omega_c(3090)^{0}$ excited baryon.\n", "  Motivated by recent thermal conductivity measurements in the superconductor\nCeCoIn5, we theoretically examine a possible staggered spin-triplet\nsuperconducting order to be induced by the coupled spin-density-wave (SDW) and\nd-wave superconducting (SC) orders in the high field and low temperature (HFLT)\nSC phase peculiar to this material with strong paramagnetic pair-breaking\n(PPB). It is shown that one type of the $\\pi$-triplet order is consistent with\nthe thermal conductivity data and can naturally be incorporated in the picture\nthat the Q-phase is a consequence of the strong PPB effect inducing the SDW\norder and the FFLO spatial modulation parallel to the applied magnetic field.\n", "  Wind shear measured by Doppler tracking of the Huygens probe is evaluated,\nand found to be within the range anticipated by pre-flight assessments (namely\nless than two times the Brunt-Vaisala frequency). The strongest large-scale\nshear encountered was ~5 m/s/km, a level associated with 'Light' turbulence in\nterrestrial aviation. Near-surface winds (below 4km) have small-scale\nfluctuations of ~0.2 m/s , indicated both by probe tilt and Doppler tracking,\nand the characteristics of the fluctuation, of interest for future missions to\nTitan, can be reproduced with a simple autoregressive (AR(1)) model. The\nturbulent dissipation rate at an altitude of ~500m is found to be 16 cm2/sec3,\nwhich may be a useful benchmark for atmospheric circulation models.\n", "  A class of constant-amplitude (CA) solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with the third-order spatial dispersion (TOD) and complex potentials\nare considered. The system can be implemented in specially designed planar\nnonlinear optical waveguides carrying a distribution of local gain and loss\nelements, in a combination with a photonic-crystal structure. The complex\npotential is built as a solution of the inverse problem, which predicts the\npotential supporting a required phase-gradient structure of the CA state. It is\nshown that the diffraction of truncated CA states with a correct phase\nstructure can be strongly suppressed. The main subject of the analysis is the\nmodulational instability (MI) of the CA states. The results show that the TOD\nterm tends to attenuate the MI. In particular, simulations demonstrate a\nphenomenon of weak stability, which occurs when the linear-stability analysis\npredicts small values of the MI growth rate. The stability of the zero state,\nwhich is a nontrivial issue in the framework of the present model, is studied\ntoo\n", "  In this work, we studied the adsorption behavior of deposited Si atoms along\nwith their diffusion and other dynamic processes on a Pb monolayer-covered\nSi(111) surface from 125-230 K using a variable-temperature scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM). The Pb-covered Si(111) surface form a low-symmetry row-like\nstructure in this temperature range and the Si atoms bind favorably to two\nspecific on-top sites (T1A and T1B) on the trimer row after deposition at the\nsample temperature of 125 K. The Si atoms were immobile at low temperatures and\nstarted to switch between the two neighboring T1A and T1B sites within the same\ntrimer when the temperature was raised to 150 K. When the temperature was\nraised above 160 K, the adsorbed Si atoms could hop to other trimers along the\nsame trimer row. Below 170 K, short hops to adjacent trimers dominated, but\nlong hops dominated at temperatures above 170 K. The activation energy and\nprefactor for the Si atoms diffusion were derived through analysis of\ncontinuous-time imaging at temperatures from 160-174 K. In addition,\nirreversible aggregation of single Si atoms into Si clusters started to occur\nat the phase boundaries or defective sites at temperatures above 170 K. This\nstudy provides crucial information for understanding the very initial stage of\nnucleation and growth behavior of epitaxial Si layers on a Pb-covered Si(111)\nsurface. In addition, our study provides strong evidence for breaking in the\nmirror symmetry in the Pb-covered structure, which has implication for the\natomic model of this controversial structure.\n", "  We show that higher-derivative $q$-theory in the four-form-field-strength\nrealization does not suffer from the Ostrogradsky instability at the classical\nlevel.\n", "  We introduce a prescriptive approach to generalized unitarity, resulting in a\nstrictly-diagonal basis of loop integrands with coefficients given by\nspecifically-tailored residues in field theory. We illustrate the power of this\nstrategy in the case of planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,\nwhere we construct closed-form representations of all ($n$-point N$^k$MHV)\nscattering amplitudes through three loops. The prescriptive approach contrasts\nwith the ordinary description of unitarity-based methods by avoiding any need\nfor linear algebra to determine integrand coefficients. We describe this\napproach in general terms as it should have applications to many quantum field\ntheories, including those without planarity, supersymmetry, or massless spectra\ndefined in any number of dimensions.\n", "  We study the effect of a fluctuating active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the\nabundance of circumgalactic OVI in galaxies selected from the EAGLE\nsimulations. We follow the time-variable OVI abundance in post-processing\naround four galaxies - two at $z=0.1$ with stellar masses of $M_{\\ast} \\sim\n10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $M_{\\ast} \\sim 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and two at $z=3$\nwith similar stellar masses - out to impact parameters of twice their virial\nradii, implementing a fluctuating central source of ionizing radiation. Due to\ndelayed recombination, the AGN leave significant `AGN proximity zone fossils'\naround all four galaxies, where OVI and other metal ions are out of ionization\nequilibrium for several megayears after the AGN fade. The column density of OVI\nis typically enhanced by $\\approx 0.3-1.0$ dex at impact parameters within\n$0.3R_{\\rm vir}$, and by $\\approx 0.06-0.2$ dex at $2R_{\\rm vir}$, thereby also\nenhancing the covering fraction of OVI above a given column density threshold.\nThe fossil effect tends to increase with increasing AGN luminosity, and towards\nshorter AGN lifetimes and larger AGN duty cycle fractions. In the limit of\nshort AGN lifetimes, the effect converges to that of a continuous AGN with a\nluminosity of $(f_{\\rm duty}/100\\%)$ times the AGN luminosity. We also find\nsignificant fossil effects for other metal ions, where low-ionization state\nions are decreased (SiIV, CIV at $z=3$) and high-ionization state ions are\nincreased (CIV at $z=0.1$, NeVIII, MgX). Using observationally motivated AGN\nparameters, we predict AGN proximity zone fossils to be ubiquitous around\n$M_{\\ast} \\sim 10^{10-11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ galaxies, and to affect observations of\nmetals in the circumgalactic medium at both low and high redshifts.\n", "  We consider a spin-1/2 Ising-XYZ distorted diamond chain with the XYZ\ninteraction between the interstitial Heisenberg dimers, the nearest-neighbor\nIsing coupling between the nodal and interstitial spins, respectively, and the\nsecond-neighbor Ising coupling between the nodal spins. The ground-state phase\ndiagram of the spin-1/2 Ising-XYZ distorted diamond chain exhibits several\nintriguing phases due to the XY anisotropy and the second-neighbor interaction,\nwhereas the model can be exactly solved using the transfer-matrix technique.\nThe quantum entanglement within the Heisenberg spin dimers is studied through a\nbipartite measure concurrence, which is calculated from a relevant reduced\ndensity operator. The concurrence may either show a standard thermal dependence\nwith a monotonous decline with increasing temperature or a more peculiar\nthermal dependence accompanied with reentrant behavior of the concurrence. It\nis conjectured that the bipartite entanglement between the interstitial\nHeisenberg spin pairs in the natural mineral azurite is quite insensitive to\nthe applied magnetic field and it persists up to approximately 30 Kelvins.\n", "  We studied dipole excitations in $^{10}$Be based on an extended version of\nthe antisymmetrized molecular dynamics, which can describe 1p-1h excitations\nand large amplitude cluster modes. Toroidal and compressive dipole operators\nare found to be good proves to separate the low-energy and high-energy parts of\nthe isoscalar dipole excitations, respectively. Two low-energy $1^-$ states,\nthe toroidal dominant $1^-_1$ state at $E\\sim 8$ MeV and the $E1$ dominant\n$1^-_2$ state at $E\\sim 16$ MeV, were obtained. By analysis of transition\ncurrent densities, the $1^-_1$ states is understood as a toroidal dipole mode\nwith exotic toroidal neutron flow caused by rotation of a deformed\n$^6\\textrm{He}$ cluster, whereas the $1^-_2$ state is regarded as a\nneutron-skin oscillation mode, which are characterized by surface neutron flow\nwith inner isoscalar flow caused by the surface neutron oscillation against the\n$2\\alpha$ core.\n", "  Resolvable Supermassive Black Hole Binaries are promising sources for Pulsar\nTiming Array based gravitational wave searches. Search algorithms for such\ntargets must contend with the large number of so-called pulsar phase parameters\nin the joint log-likelihood function of the data. We compare the localization\naccuracy for two approaches: Maximization over the pulsar phase parameters\n(MaxPhase) against marginalization over them (AvPhase). Using simulated data\nfrom a pulsar timing array with 17 pulsars, we find that for weak and\nmoderately strong signals, AvPhase outperforms MaxPhase significantly, while\nthey perform comparably for strong signals.\n", "  Topological insulators and superconductors are characterized by their gapless\nboundary modes. In this paper, we develop a recursive approach to the boundary\nGreen function which encodes this nontrivial boundary physics. Our approach\ndescribes the various topologically trivial and nontrivial phases as fixed\npoints of a recursion and provides direct access to the phase diagram, the\nlocalization properties of the edge modes, as well as topological indices. We\nillustrate our approach in the context of various familiar models such as the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Kitaev chain, and a model for a Chern\ninsulator. We also show that the method provides an intuitive approach to\nunderstand recently introduced topological phases which exhibit gapless corner\nstates.\n", "  Solar flares show highly unusual spectra, in which the thermodynamic\nconditions of the solar atmosphere are encoded. Current models are unable to\nfully reproduce the spectroscopic flare observations, especially the\nsingle-peaked spectral profiles of the MgII h and k lines. We aim at\nunderstanding the formation of the chromospheric and optically thick MgII h and\nk lines in flares through radiative transfer calculations. We take a flare\natmosphere obtained from a simulation with the radiative hydrodynamic code\nRADYN as input for a radiative transfer modeling with the RH code. By\niteratively changing this model atmosphere and varying thermodynamic\nparameters, such as temperature, electron density, and velocities, we study\ntheir effects on the emergent intensity spectra. We can reproduce the typical\nsingle-peaked MgII h and k flare spectral shape and their approximate intensity\nratios to the subordinate MgII lines by either increasing densities,\ntemperatures or velocities at the line core formation height range.\nAdditionally, by combining unresolved up- and downflows up to ~250 km/s within\none resolution element, we also reproduce the widely broadened line wings.\nWhile we cannot unambiguously determine which mechanism dominates in flares,\nfuture modeling efforts should investigate unresolved components, additional\nheat dissipation, larger velocities, and higher densities, and combine the\nanalysis of multiple spectral lines.\n", "  Z Cam variables are a subclass of dwarf nova that lie near a global\nbifurcation between outbursting (\"limit cycle\") and non-outbursting\n(\"standstill\") states. It is believed that variations in the secondary star's\nmass-injection rate instigate transitions between the two regimes. In this\npaper we explore an alternative trigger for these transitions: stochastic\nfluctuations in the disk's turbulent viscosity. We employ simple one-zone and\nglobal viscous models which, though inappropriate for detailed matching to\nobserved light curves, clearly indicate that turbulent disk fluctuations induce\noutbursts when the system is sufficiently close to the global bifurcation\npoint. While the models easily produce the observed \"outburst dip\" pairs\nexhibited by Z Cam and Nova-like variables, they struggle to generate long\ntrains of outbursts. We conclude that mass transfer variability is the dominant\nphysical process determining the overall Z Cam standstill outburst pattern, but\nthat viscous stochasticity provides an additional ingredient explaining some of\nthe secondary features observed.\n", "  We study the Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in a plasma, where we\ninclude the cases of both transverse photons and plasmons. We consider\nfour-wave mixing processes of photon and plasmon modes in a relativistic\nisotropic plasma to determine the coupling constant to lowest order. We further\nshow that photon condensation is possible in an unbounded plasma because, in\ncontrast with other optical media, plasmas introduce an effective photon mass.\nThis guarantees the existence of a finite chemical potential and a critical\ntemperature, which is calculated for both transverse photons and plasmons. By\nconsidering four-wave mixing processes, we derive the interactions between the\nphotons in the condensate. We also study the elementary excitations (or\nBogoliubov modes) of the condensed photon and plasmon gases, and determine the\nrespective dispersion relations. Finally, we discuss the kinetics of photon\ncondensation via inverse Compton scattering between the photons and the\nelectrons in the plasma.\n", "  Violations of Lorentz invariance can lead to an energy-dependent vacuum\ndispersion of light, which results in arrival-time differences of photons\narising with different energies from a given transient source. In this work,\ndirection-dependent dispersion constraints are obtained on nonbirefringent\nLorentz-violating effects, using the observed spectral lags of the gamma-ray\nburst GRB 160625B. This burst has unusually large high-energy photon\nstatistics, so we can obtain constraints from the true spectral time lags of\nbunches of high-energy photons rather than from the rough time lag of a single\nhighest-energy photon. Also, GRB 160625B is the only burst to date having a\nwell-defined transition from positive lags to negative lags, which provides a\nunique opportunity to distinguish Lorentz-violating effects from any\nsource-intrinsic time lag in the emission of photons of different energy bands.\nOur results place comparatively robust two-sided constraints on a variety of\nisotropic and anisotropic coefficients for Lorentz violation, including first\nbounds on Lorentz-violating effects from operators of mass dimension ten in the\nphoton sector.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) topology optimization problems always involve huge\nnumbers of Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) in finite element analysis (FEA) and\ndesign variables in numerical optimization, respectively. This will inevitably\nlead to large computational efforts in the solution process. In the present\npaper, an efficient and explicit topology optimization approach which can\nreduce not only the number of design variables but also the number of degrees\nof freedom in FEA is proposed based on the Moving Morphable Voids (MMVs)\nsolution framework. This is achieved by introducing a set of geometry\nparameters (e.g., control points of B-spline surfaces) to describe the boundary\nof a structure explicitly and removing the unnecessary DOFs from the FE model\nat every step of numerical optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate that\nthe proposed approach does can overcome the bottleneck problems associated with\na 3D topology optimization problem in a straightforward way and enhance the\nsolution efficiency significantly.\n", "  Earth-like, potentially habitable exoplanets are prime targets in the search\nfor extraterrestrial life. Information about their atmosphere and surface can\nbe derived by analyzing light of the parent star reflected by the planet. We\ninvestigate the influence of the surface albedo $A_{\\rm s}$, the optical\nthickness $b_{\\rm cloud}$ and altitude of water clouds, and the mixing ratio\n$\\eta$ of biosignature O$_2$ on the strength of the O$_2$ A-band (around 760\nnm) in flux and polarization spectra of starlight reflected by Earth-like\nexoplanets. Our computations for horizontally homogeneous planets show that\nsmall mixing ratios ($\\eta$ < 0.4) will yield moderately deep bands in flux and\nmoderate to small band strengths in polarization, and that clouds will usually\ndecrease the band depth in flux and the band strength in polarization. However,\ncloud influence will be strongly dependent on their properties such as optical\nthickness, top altitude, particle phase, coverage fraction, horizontal\ndistribution. Depending on the surface albedo, and cloud properties, different\nO$_2$ mixing ratios $\\eta$ can give similar absorption band depths in flux and\nband strengths in polarization, in particular if the clouds have moderate to\nhigh optical thicknesses. Measuring both the flux and the polarization is\nessential to reduce the degeneracies, although it will not solve them, in\nparticular not for horizontally inhomogeneous planets. Observations at a wide\nrange of phase angles and with a high temporal resolution could help to derive\ncloud properties and, once those are known, the mixing ratio of O$_2$ or any\nother absorbing gas.\n", "  Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the quenching history of\na galaxy? Here we investigate the detailed morphological structures and star\nformation histories of a sample of SDSS group galaxies with both\nclassifications from Galaxy Zoo 2 and NUV detections in GALEX. We use the\noptical and NUV colours to infer the quenching time and rate describing a\nsimple exponentially declining SFH for each galaxy, along with a control sample\nof field galaxies. We find that the time since quenching and the rate of\nquenching do not correlate with the relative velocity of a satellite but are\ncorrelated with the group potential. This quenching occurs within an average\nquenching timescale of $\\sim2.5~\\rm{Gyr}$ from star forming to complete\nquiescence, during an average infall time (from $\\sim 10R_{200}$ to\n$0.01R_{200}$) of $\\sim 2.6~\\rm{Gyr}$. Our results suggest that the environment\ndoes play a direct role in galaxy quenching through quenching mechanisms which\nare correlated with the group potential, such as harassment, interactions or\nstarvation. Environmental quenching mechanisms which are correlated with\nsatellite velocity, such as ram pressure stripping, are not the main cause of\nquenching in the group environment. We find that no single mechanism dominates\nover another, except in the most extreme environments or masses. Instead an\ninterplay of mergers, mass & morphological quenching and environment driven\nquenching mechanisms dependent on the group potential drive galaxy evolution in\ngroups.\n", "  The fragmentation dynamics of 2,6- and 3,5-difluoroiodobenzene after iodine\n4$d$ inner-shell photoionization with soft X-rays are studied using coincident\nelectron and ion momentum imaging. By analyzing the momentum correlation\nbetween iodine and fluorine cations in three-fold ion coincidence events, we\ncan distinguish the two isomers experimentally. Classical Coulomb explosion\nsimulations are in overall agreement with the experimentally determined\nfragment ion kinetic energies and momentum correlations and point toward\ndifferent fragmentation mechanisms and time scales. While most three-body\nfragmentation channels show clear evidence for sequential fragmentation on a\ntime scale larger than the rotational period of the fragments, the breakup into\niodine and fluorine cations and a third charged co-fragment appears to occur\nwithin a few hundred femtoseconds -- a time scale larger than the rotational\nperiod of the fragments, the breakup in other channels appears to occur within\na few hundred femtoseconds.\n", "  More than forty years after the first detection of neutrinos from the Sun,\nthe spectroscopy of solar neutrinos has proven to be an on-going success story.\nThe long-standing puzzle about the observed solar neutrino deficit has been\nresolved by the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations. Today's experiments\nhave been able to solidify the standard MSW-LMA oscillation scenario by\nperforming precise measurements over the whole energy range of the solar\nneutrino spectrum. This article reviews the enabling experimental technologies:\nOn the one hand mutli-kiloton-scale water Cherenkov detectors performing\nmeasurements in the high-energy regime of the spectrum, on the other end\nultrapure liquid-scintillator detectors that allow for a low-threshold\nanalysis. The current experimental results on the fluxes, spectra and time\nvariation of the different components of the solar neutrino spectrum will be\npresented, setting them in the context of both neutrino oscillation physics and\nthe hydrogen fusion processes embedded in the Standard Solar Model. Finally,\nthe physics potential of state-of-the-art detectors and a next-generation of\nexperiments based on novel techniques will be assessed in the context of the\nmost interesting open questions in solar neutrino physics: a precise\nmeasurement of the vacuum-matter transition curve of electron-neutrino\noscillation probability that offers a definitive test of the basic MSW-LMA\nscenario or the appearance of new physics; and a first detection of neutrinos\nfrom the CNO cycle that will provide new information on solar metallicity and\nstellar physics.\n", "  Refocalization sequences in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) can in principle\nreverse the coherent evolution under the secular dipolar Hamiltonian of a\nclosed system. We use this experimental strategy to study the effect of\nirreversible decoherence on the signal amplitude attenuation in a single\ncrystal hydrated salt where the nuclear spin system consists in the set of\nhydration water proton spins having a strong coupling within each pair and a\nmuch weaker coupling with other pairs. We study the experimental response of\nattenuation times with temperature, crystal orientation with respect to the\nexternal magnetic field and rf pulse amplitudes. We find that the observed\nattenuation of the refocalized signals can be explained by two independent\nmechanisms: (a) evolution under the non-secular terms of the reversion\nHamiltonian, and (b) an intrinsic mechanism having the attributes of\nirreversible decoherence induced by the coupling with a quantum environment. To\ncharacterize (a) we compare the experimental data with the numerical\ncalculation of the refocalized NMR signal of an artificial, closed spin system.\nTo describe (b) we use a model for the irreversible adiabatic decoherence of\nspin-pairs coupled with a phonon bath which allows evaluating an upper bound\nfor the decoherence times. This model accounts for both the observed dependence\nof the decoherence times on the eigenvalues of the spin-environment\nHamiltonian, and the independence on the sample temperature. This result, then,\nsupports the adiabatic decoherence induced by the dipole-phonon coupling as the\nexplanation for the observed irreversible decay of reverted NMR signals in\nsolids.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the period distribution of giant planets. We fit\nthe bias-corrected distribution of gas-giant planets inside 300 days found by\nSanterne et al. (2016) using a planet formation model based on pebble\naccretion. We investigate two possible initial conditions: a linear\ndistribution of planetary seeds, and seeds injected exclusively on the water\nand CO icelines. Our simulations exclude the linear initial distribution of\nseeds with a high degree of confidence. Our bimodal model based on snowlines\ngive a more reasonable fit to the data, with the discrepancies reducing\nsignificantly if we assume the water snowline to be a factor 3-10 less\nefficient at producing planets. This model moreover performs better on both the\nwarm/hot Jupiters ratio and a Gaussian mixture model as comparison criteria.\nOur results hint that the gas-giant exoplanets population inside 300 days is\nmore compatible with planets forming preferentially at special locations.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of spin-orbit torque induced switching\nof perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co elements in a time resolved stroboscopic\nexperiment based on high resolution Kerr microscopy. Magnetization dynamics is\ninduced by injecting sub-nanosecond current pulses into the bilayer while\nsimultaneously applying static in-plane magnetic bias fields. Highly\nreproducible homogeneous switching on time scales of several tens of\nnanoseconds is observed. Our findings can be corroborated using micromagnetic\nmodelling only when including a field-like torque term as well as the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction mediated by finite temperature.\n", "  We present an analytical and numerical study of the orbital migration and\nresonance capture of fictitious two-planet systems with masses in the\nsuper-Earth range undergoing Type-I migration. We find that, depending on the\nflare index and proximity to the central star, the average value of the period\nratio, $P_2/P_1$, between both planets may show a significant deviation with\nrespect to the nominal value. For planets trapped in the 2:1 commensurability,\noffsets may reach values on the order of $0.1$ for orbital periods on the order\nof $1$ day, while systems in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance (MMR) show much\nsmaller offsets for all values of the semimajor axis. These properties are in\ngood agreement with the observed distribution of near-resonant exoplanets,\nindependent of their detection method. We show that 2:1-resonant systems far\nfrom the star, such as HD82943 and HR8799, are characterized by very small\nresonant offsets, while higher values are typical of systems discovered by\nKepler with orbital periods approximately a few days. Conversely, planetary\nsystems in the vicinity of the 3:2 MMR show little offset with no significant\ndependence on the orbital distance. In conclusion, our results indicate that\nthe distribution of Kepler planetary systems around the 2:1 and 3:2 MMR are\nconsistent with resonant configurations obtained as a consequence of a smooth\nmigration in a laminar flared disk, and no external forces are required to\ninduce the observed offset or its dependence with the commensurability or\norbital distance from the star.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of black-hole accretion rate (BHAR) on\nhost-galaxy star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_*$) in the\nCANDELS/GOODS-South field in the redshift range of $0.5\\leq z < 2.0$. Our\nsample consists of $\\approx 18000$ galaxies, allowing us to probe galaxies with\n$0.1 \\lesssim \\mathrm{SFR} \\lesssim 100\\ M_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and/or\n$10^8 \\lesssim M_* \\lesssim 10^{11}\\ M_{\\odot}$. We use sample-mean BHAR to\napproximate long-term average BHAR. Our sample-mean BHARs are derived from the\n$Chandra$ Deep Field-South 7 Ms observations, while the SFRs and $M_*$ have\nbeen estimated by the CANDELS team through SED fitting. The average BHAR is\ncorrelated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$\nrelations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of\nunity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than\nSFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property\nrelated to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a\nsecondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence. Among our sources,\nmassive galaxies ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) have significantly higher\nBHAR/SFR ratios than less-massive galaxies, indicating the former have higher\nblack-hole fueling efficiency and/or higher SMBH occupation fraction than the\nlatter. Our results can naturally explain the observed proportionality between\n$M_{\\rm BH}$ and $M_*$ for local giant ellipticals, and suggest their $M_{\\rm\nBH}/M_*$ is higher than that of local star-forming galaxies. Among local\nstar-forming galaxies, massive systems might have higher $M_{\\rm BH}/M_*$\ncompared to dwarfs.\n", "  We use state-of-the-art chemical models to track the cosmic evolution of the\nCNO isotopes in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies, yielding powerful\nconstraints on their stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-assess the\nrelative roles of massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and novae\nin the production of rare isotopes such as 13C, 15N, 17O and 18O, along with\n12C, 14N and 16O. The CNO isotope yields of super-AGB stars, novae and\nfast-rotating massive stars are included. Having reproduced the available\nisotope enrichment data in the solar neighbourhood, and across the Galaxy, and\nhaving assessed the sensitivity of our models to the remaining uncertainties,\ne.g. nova yields and star-formation history, we show that we can meaningfully\nconstrain the stellar IMF in galaxies using C, O and N isotope abundance\nratios. In starburst galaxies, where data for multiple isotopologue lines are\navailable, we find compelling new evidence for a top-heavy stellar IMF, with\nprofound implications for their star-formation rates and efficiencies, perhaps\nalso their stellar masses. Neither chemical fractionation nor selective\nphotodissociation can significantly perturb globally-averaged isotopologue\nabundance ratios away from the corresponding isotope ones, as both these\nprocesses will typically affect only small mass fractions of molecular clouds\nin galaxies. Thus the Atacama Large Millimetre Array now stands ready to probe\nthe stellar IMF, and even the ages of specific starburst events in star-forming\ngalaxies across cosmic time unaffected by the dust obscuration effects that\nplague optical/near-infrared studies.\n", "  Using a shallow water model with time-dependent forcing we show that the peak\nof an exoplanet thermal phase curve is, in general, offset from secondary\neclipse when the planet is rotating. That is, the planetary hot-spot is offset\nfrom the point of maximal heating (the substellar point) and may lead or lag\nthe forcing; the extent and sign of the offset is a function of both the\nrotation rate and orbital period of the planet. We also find that the system\nreaches a steady-state in the reference frame of the moving forcing. The model\nis an extension of the well studied Matsuno-Gill model into a full spherical\ngeometry and with a planetary-scale translating forcing representing the\ninsolation received on an exoplanet from a host star.\n  The speed of the gravity waves in the model is shown to be a key metric in\nevaluating the phase curve offset. If the velocity of the substellar point\n(relative to the planet's surface) exceeds that of the gravity waves then the\nhotspot will lag the substellar point, as might be expected by consideration of\nforced gravity wave dynamics. However, when the substellar point is moving\nslower than the internal wavespeed of the system the hottest point can lead the\npassage of the forcing. We provide an interpretation of this result by\nconsideration of the Rossby and Kelvin wave dynamics as well as, in the very\nslowly rotating case, a one-dimensional model that yields an analytic solution.\nFinally, we consider the inverse problem of constraining planetary rotation\nrate from an observed phase curve.\n", "  We critically examine the current status of theoretical calculations of the\nenergies, the fine structure, and the isotope shift of the lowest-lying states\nof helium, searching for unresolved discrepancies with experiments.\nCalculations are performed within the quantum electrodynamics expansion in\npowers of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ and the electron-to-nucleus mass\nratio $m/M$. For energies, theoretical results are complete through orders\n$\\alpha^6m$ and $\\alpha^6m^2/M$, with the resulting accuracy ranging from $0.5$\nto $2$~MHz for the $n=2$ states. The fine-structure splitting of the $2^3P$\nstate is predicted with a much better accuracy, 1.7~kHz, as a consequence of a\ncalculation of the next-order $\\alpha^7m$ effect. An excellent agreement of the\ntheoretical predictions with the recent measurements of the fine structure\nprovides one of the best tests of the bound-state QED in few-electron systems\nand determines the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ with an accuracy of 31~ppb.\nThe isotope shift between $^3$He and $^4$He is treated theoretically with a\nsub-kHz accuracy, which allows for a high-precision determination of the\ndifferences of the nuclear charge radii $\\delta r^2$. Several such\ndeterminations, however, yield results that are in a 4$\\sigma$ disagreement\nwith each other, what remains unexplained. Apart from this, we find no\nsignificant discrepancies between theory and experiment for the helium atom. In\nthe future, a calculation of the next-order $\\alpha^7m$ effect for energy\nlevels will enable determinations of the nuclear charge radii from atomic\ntransition frequencies with an accuracy better than 1\\%. Combined with the\ncomplementary determinations from muonic atoms, this will provide a sensitive\ntest of universality in electromagnetic interactions of leptons and contribute\nto the solution of the proton charge radius puzzle.\n", "  We seek the conditions for a {\\it steady} mean field galactic dynamo. The\nparameter set is reduced to those appearing in the $\\alpha^2$ and\n$\\alpha/\\omega$ dynamo, namely velocity amplitudes, and the ratio of sub-scale\nhelicity to diffusivity. The parameters can be allowed to vary on conical\nspirals. We analyze the mean field dynamo equations in terms of scale invariant\nlogarithmic spiral modes and special exact solutions. Compatible scale\ninvariant gravitational spiral arms are introduced and illustrated in an\nappendix, but the detailed dynamical interaction with the magnetic field is\nleft for another work. As a result of planar magnetic spirals `lifting' into\nthe halo, multiple sign changes in average rotation measures forming a regular\npattern on each side of the galactic minor axis, are predicted. Such changes\nhave recently been detected in the CHANG-ES survey.\n", "  Despite recent advancements in the study and understanding of the phase\ndiagram of strongly interacting matter, the region of high baryonic densities\nand low temperatures has remained difficult to reach in the lab. Things are\nexpected to change with the planned HIC experiments at FAIR in Germany and NICA\nin Russia, which will open a window to the high-density-low-temperature segment\nof the QCD phase map, providing a unique opportunity to test the validity of\nmodel calculations that have predicted the formation of spatially inhomogeneous\nphases with broken chiral symmetry at intermediate-to-high densities. Such a\ndensity region is also especially relevant for the physics of neutron stars, as\nthey have cores that can have several times the nuclear saturation density. On\nthe other hand, strong magnetic fields, whose presence is fairly common in HIC\nand in neutron stars, can affect the properties of these exotic phases and lead\nto signatures potentially observable in these two settings. In this paper, I\nexamine the anomalous transport properties produced by the spectral asymmetry\nof the lowest Landau level (LLL) in a QCD-inspired NJL model with a background\nmagnetic field that exhibits chiral symmetry breaking at high density via the\nformation of a Dual Chiral Density Wave (DCDW) condensate. It turns out that in\nthis model the electromagnetic interactions are described by the axion\nelectrodynamics equations and there is a dissipationless Hall current.\n", "  We utilize elemental-abundance information for Galactic red giant stars in\nfive open clusters (NGC 7789, NGC 6819, M67, NGC 188, and NGC 6791) from the\nApache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR13 dataset to\nage-date the chemical evolution of the high- and low-$\\alpha$ element sequences\nof the Milky Way. Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose\nstellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high-$\\alpha$,\nhigh-[Fe/H] region of the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's\nage ($\\sim 8$ Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane,\nas well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we\nsuggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part\nof the thick-disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover,\nbecause NGC 6791 lies at the \\textit{high metallicity end} ([Fe/H] $\\sim 0.4$)\nof the high-$\\alpha$ sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the\n\\textit{youngest age} of stars in the high-metallicity, high-$\\alpha$ sequence\nfor the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a\nsimilar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of\n$\\sim 7$ Gyr on the \\textit{oldest age} of the low-$\\alpha$ sequence of the\nMilky Way. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star\nclusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important\ntransition point in the chemical history of the Milky Way.\n", "  In view of a recently renewed interest to production of multiple Higgs bosons\nthe amplitude for such process at the threshold of $n$ particles is considered.\nAn explicit calculation is done for the loop corrections to the amplitude\narising from interaction with a heavy fermion (e.g. top quark) and also with a\nheavy scalar. It is shown that such corrections generally break the scaling\ndependence on the number $n$ and the Higgs self coupling, which dependence is\nknown from the past studies of models with one field. The correction due to the\ntop quark loop is also found to be numerically large and exceeding that from\nthe self coupling until very high $n$.\n", "  The discovery of multiple stellar populations in Milky Way globular clusters\n(GCs) has stimulated various follow-up studies on helium-enhanced stellar\npopulations. Here we present the evolutionary population synthesis models for\nthe spectro-photometric evolution of simple stellar populations (SSPs) with\nvarying initial helium abundance ($Y_{\\rm ini}$). We show that $Y_{\\rm ini}$\nbrings about {dramatic} changes in spectro-photometric properties of SSPs. Like\nthe normal-helium SSPs, the integrated spectro-photometric evolution of\nhelium-enhanced SSPs is also dependent on metallicity and age for a given\n$Y_{\\rm ini}$. {We discuss the implications and prospects for the\nhelium-enhanced populations in relation to the second-generation populations\nfound in the Milky Way GCs.} All of the models are available at\n\\url{http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/cosmic/data/YEPS.htm}.\n", "  Recent results by Martin et al. (2014) showed in 3D SPH simulations that\ntilted discs in binary systems can be unstable to the development of global,\ndamped Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations in which the discs exchange tilt for\neccentricity. We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge. We\npresent a framework for understanding the zones of instability based on the\ndetermination of branches of marginally unstable modes. In general, multiple\ngrowing eccentric KL modes can be present in a disc. Coplanar apsidal-nodal\nprecession resonances delineate instability branches. We determine the range of\ntilt angles for unstable modes as a function of disc aspect ratio. Unlike the\nKL instability for free particles that involves a critical (minimum) tilt\nangle, disc instability is possible for any nonzero tilt angle depending on the\ndisc aspect ratio.\n", "  We have fabricated bulk nanostructured ferrimagnetic materials with different\ngrain sizes by sintering ball-milled Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) nanoparticles and measured\nthe grain-size dependence of the thermal conductivity and spin Seebeck\nthermopower. The nanostructuring reduces both thermal conductivity and\nthermopower, but the reduction of the latter was found to be considerably\nstronger despite the moderate difference in magnetization, which suggests that\nthe length scales of transport of magnons and phonons contributing to the spin\nSeebeck effect are significantly larger than that of phonons carrying thermal\ncurrent. This is consistent with the measurements of high-magnetic-field\nresponse of the spin Seebeck thermopower and low-temperature thermal\nconductivity, where the quenching of magnons seen in single-crystalline YIG was\nnot observed in nanostructured YIG due to scattering of long-range low\nfrequency magnons.\n", "  We present a family of self-consistent axisymmetric rotating globular cluster\nmodels which are fitted to spectroscopic data for NGC 362, NGC 1851, NGC 2808,\nNGC 4372, NGC 5927 and NGC 6752 to provide constraints on their physical and\nkinematic properties, including their rotation signals. They are constructed by\nflattening Modified Plummer profiles, which have the same asymptotic behaviour\nas classical Plummer models, but can provide better fits to young clusters due\nto a slower turnover in the density profile. The models are in dynamical\nequilibrium as they depend solely on the action variables. We employ a fully\nBayesian scheme to investigate the uncertainty in our model parameters\n(including mass-to-light ratios and inclination angles) and evaluate the\nBayesian evidence ratio for rotating to non-rotating models. We find convincing\nlevels of rotation only in NGC 2808. In the other clusters, there is just a\nhint of rotation (in particular, NGC 4372 and NGC 5927), as the data quality\ndoes not allow us to draw strong conclusions. Where rotation is present, we\nfind that it is confined to the central regions, within radii of $R \\leq 2\nr_h$. As part of this work, we have developed a novel q-Gaussian basis\nexpansion of the line-of-sight velocity distributions, from which general\nmodels can be constructed via interpolation on the basis coefficients.\n", "  We present a model for lightning shock induced chemistry that can be applied\nto atmospheres of arbitrary H/C/N/O chemistry, hence for extrasolar planets and\nbrown dwarfs. The model couples hydrodynamics and the STAND2015 kinetic\ngas-phase chemistry. For an exoplanet analogue to the contemporary Earth, our\nmodel predicts NO and NO2 yields in agreement with observation. We predict\nheight-dependent mixing ratios during a storm soon after a lightning shock of\nNO ~ 1e-3 at 40 km and NO2 ~ 1e-4 below 40 km, with O3 reduced to trace\nquantities (<< 1e-10). For an Earth-like exoplanet with a CO2/N2 dominated\natmosphere and with an extremely intense lightning storm over its entire\nsurface, we predict significant changes in the amount of NO, NO2, O3, H2O, H2,\nand predict significant abundance of C2N. We find that, for the Early Earth, O2\nis formed in large quantities by lightning but is rapidly processed by the\nphotochemistry, consistent with previous work on lightning. The effect of\npersistent global lightning storms are predicted to be significant, primarily\ndue to NO2, with the largest spectral features present at ~3.4 {\\mu}m and ~6.2\n{\\mu}m. The features within the transmission spectrum are on the order of 1 ppm\nand therefore are not likely detectable with JWST. Depending on its spectral\nproperties, C2N could be a key tracer for lightning on Earth-like exoplanets\nwith a N2/CO2 bulk atmosphere, unless destroyed by yet unknown chemical\nreactions.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin configurations in materials with\nchiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), that are potentially useful for\nstoring or processing information. To date, DMI has been found in few bulk\nmaterials, but can also be induced in atomically thin magnetic films in contact\nwith surfaces with large spin-orbit interactions. Recent experiments have\nreported that isolated magnetic skyrmions can be stabilized even near room\ntemperature in few-atom thick magnetic layers sandwiched between materials that\nprovide asymmetric spin-orbit coupling. Here we present the minimum-energy path\nanalysis of three distinct mechanisms for the skyrmion collapse, based on ab\ninitio input and the performed atomic-spin simulations. We focus on the\nstability of a skyrmion in three atomic layers of Co, either epitaxial on the\nPt(111) surface, or within a hybrid multilayer where DMI nontrivially varies\nper monolayer due to competition between different symmetry-breaking from two\nsides of the Co film. In laterally finite systems, their constrained geometry\ncauses poor thermal stability of the skyrmion toward collapse at the boundary,\nwhich we show to be resolved by designing the high-DMI structure within an\nextended film with lower or no DMI.\n", "  The reaction e + p ---> photon + jet + X is studied in QCD at the\nnext-to-leading order. Previous studies on inclusive distributions showed a\ngood agreement with ZEUS data. To obtain a finer understanding of the dynamics\nof the reaction, several correlation functions are evaluated for ZEUS\nkinematics.\n", "  We report calculations of the one-loop self-energy correction to the\nbound-electron $g$ factor of the $1s$ and $2s$ states of light hydrogen-like\nions with the nuclear charge number $Z \\le 20$. The calculation is carried out\nto all orders in the binding nuclear strength. We find good agreement with\nprevious calculations and improve their accuracy by about two orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  The circumstellar disk density distributions for a sample of 63 Be southern\nstars from the BeSOS survey were found by modelling their H$\\alpha$ emission\nline profiles. These disk densities were used to compute disk masses and disk\nangular momenta for the sample. Average values for the disk mass are\n3.4$\\times$10$^{-9}$ and 9.5$\\times$10$^{-10}$ $M_{\\star}$ for early (B0-B3)\nand late (B4-B9) spectral types, respectively. We also find that the range of\ndisk angular momentum relative to the star are between 150-200 and 100-150\n$J_{\\star}/M_{\\star}$, again for early and late-type Be stars respectively. The\ndistributions of the disk mass and disk angular momentum are different between\nearly and late-type Be stars at a 1\\% level of significance. Finally, we\nconstruct the disk mass distribution for the BeSOS sample as a function of\nspectral type and compare it to the predictions of stellar evolutionary models\nwith rapid rotation. The observed disk masses are typically larger than the\ntheoretical predictions, although the observed spread in disk masses is\ntypically large.\n", "  Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied toward data\nanalyses at the Large Hadron Collider, especially with applications for\ndiscrimination of jets with different originating particles. Previous studies\nof the power of machine learning to jet physics has typically employed image\nrecognition, natural language processing, or other algorithms that have been\nextensively developed in computer science. While these studies have\ndemonstrated impressive discrimination power, often exceeding that of\nwidely-used observables, they have been formulated in a non-constructive manner\nand it is not clear what additional information the machines are learning. In\nthis paper, we study machine learning for jet physics constructively,\nexpressing all of the information in a jet onto sets of observables that\ncompletely and minimally span N-body phase space. For concreteness, we study\nthe application of machine learning for discrimination of boosted, hadronic\ndecays of Z bosons from jets initiated by QCD processes. Our results\ndemonstrate that the information in a jet that is useful for discrimination\npower of QCD jets from Z bosons is saturated by only considering observables\nthat are sensitive to 4-body (8 dimensional) phase space.\n", "  Fragmentation of filaments into dense cores is thought to be an important\nstep in forming stars. The bar-mode instability of spherically collapsing cores\nfound in previous linear analysis invokes a possibility of re-fragmentation of\nthe cores due to their ellipsoidal (prolate or oblate) deformation. To\ninvestigate this possibility, here we perform three-dimensional\nself-gravitational hydrodynamics simulations that follow all the way from\nfilament fragmentation to subsequent core collapse. We assume the gas is\npolytropic with index \\gamma, which determines the stability of the bar-mode.\nFor the case that the fragmentation of isolated hydrostatic filaments is\ntriggered by the most unstable fragmentation mode, we find the bar mode grows\nas collapse proceeds if \\gamma < 1.1, in agreement with the linear analysis.\nHowever, it takes more than ten orders-of-magnitude increase in the central\ndensity for the distortion to become non-linear. In addition to this fiducial\ncase, we also study non-fiducial ones such as the fragmentation is triggered by\na fragmentation mode with a longer wavelength and it occurs during radial\ncollapse of filaments and find the distortion rapidly grows. In most of\nastrophysical applications, the effective polytropic index of collapsing gas\nexceeds 1.1 before ten orders-of-magnitude increase in the central density.\nThus, supposing the fiducial case of filament fragmentation, re-fragmentation\nof dense cores would not be likely and their final mass would be determined\nwhen the filaments fragment.\n", "  We present the first results from the B-fields In STar-forming Region\nObservations (BISTRO) survey, using the Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer\nArray 2 (SCUBA-2) camera, with its associated polarimeter (POL-2), on the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii. We discuss the survey's aims and\nobjectives. We describe the rationale behind the survey, and the questions\nwhich the survey will aim to answer. The most important of these is the role of\nmagnetic fields in the star formation process on the scale of individual\nfilaments and cores in dense regions. We describe the data acquisition and\nreduction processes for POL-2, demonstrating both repeatability and consistency\nwith previous data. We present a first-look analysis of the first results from\nthe BISTRO survey in the OMC 1 region. We see that the magnetic field lies\napproximately perpendicular to the famous 'integral filament' in the densest\nregions of that filament. Furthermore, we see an 'hour-glass' magnetic field\nmorphology extending beyond the densest region of the integral filament into\nthe less-dense surrounding material, and discuss possible causes for this. We\nalso discuss the more complex morphology seen along the Orion Bar region. We\nexamine the morphology of the field along the lower-density north-eastern\nfilament. We find consistency with previous theoretical models that predict\nmagnetic fields lying parallel to low-density, non-self-gravitating filaments,\nand perpendicular to higher-density, self-gravitating filaments.\n", "  We present a proper motion investigation of a sample of Be star candidates\ntowards the Magellanic Clouds, which has resulted in the identification of\nseparate populations, in the Galactic foreground and in the Magellanic\nbackground. Be stars are broadly speaking B-type stars that have shown emission\nlines in their spectra. In this work, we studied a sample of 2446 and 1019 Be\nstar candidates towards the LMC and SMC respectively, taken from the literature\nand proposed as possible Be stars due to their variability behaviour in the\nOGLE-II I band. JHKs magnitudes from the IRSF catalog and proper motions from\nthe SPM4 catalog, were obtained for 1188 and 619 LMC and SMC Be stars\ncandidates, respectively. Color-color and vector-point diagrams were used to\nidentify different populations among the Be star candidates. In the LMC sample,\ntwo populations with distinctive infrared colours and kinematics were found,\nthe bluer sample is consistent with being in the LMC and the redder one with\nbelonging to the Milky Way disk. This settles the nature of the redder sample\nwhich had been described in previous publications as a possible unknown\nsubclass of stars among the Be candidates in the LMC. In the SMC sample, a\nsimilar but less evident result was obtained, since this apparent unknown\nsubclass was not seen in this galaxy. We confirm that in the selection of Be\nstars by their variability, although generally successful, there is a higher\nrisk of contamination by Milky Way objects towards redder B$-$V and V$-$I\ncolors.\n", "  Invoked by the recent observation of $Y(4390)$ at BESIII, which is about 40\nMeV below the $D^*(2010)\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ threshold, we investigate possible\nbound and resonance states from the $D^*(2010)\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ interaction with\nthe one-boson-exchange model in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation\napproach. A bound state with quantum number $0^-(1^{--})$ is produced at 4384\nMeV from the $D^ (2010)\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ interaction, which can be related to\nexperimentally observed $Y(4390)$. Another state with quantum number\n$1^+(1^{+})$ is also produced at $4461+i39$ MeV from this interaction.\nDifferent from the $0^-(1^{--})$ state, the $1^+(1^{+})$ state is a resonance\nstate above the $D^*(2010)\\bar{D}_1(2420)$ threshold. This resonance state can\nbe related to the first observed charged charmonium-like state $Z(4430)$, which\nhas a mass about 4475 MeV measured above the threshold as observed at Belle and\nLHCb. Our result suggests that $Y(4390)$ is an isoscalar partner of the\n$Z(4430)$ as a hadronic-molecular state from the $D^*(2010)\\bar{D}_1(2420)$\ninteraction.\n", "  The anisotropy of the Fe-based superconductors is much smaller than that of\nthe cuprates and the theoretical calculations. A credible understanding for\nthis experimental fact is still lacking up to now. Here we experimentally study\nthe magnetic-field-angle dependence of electronic resistivity in the\nsuperconducting phase of iron-based superconductor\nCaFe$_{0.882}$Co$_{0.118}$AsF, and find the strongest anisotropy effect of the\nupper critical field among the iron-based superconductors based on the\nframework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The evidences of energy band structure and\ncharge density distribution from electronic structure calculations demonstrate\nthat the observed strong anisotropic effect mainly comes from the strong ionic\nbonding in between the ions of Ca$^{2+}$ and F$^-$, which weakens the\ninterlayer coupling between the layers of FeAs and CaF. This finding provides a\nsignificant insight into the nature of experimentally observed strong\nanisotropic effect of electronic resistivity, and also paves an avenue to\ndesign exotic two dimensional artificial unconventional superconductors in\nfuture.\n", "  We present here an interesting two-step filament eruption during 14-15 March\n2015. The filament was located in NOAA AR 12297 and associated with a halo\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME). We use observations from the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) and Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI) instruments onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and from the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). We also\nuse H-alpha data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) telescope and\nthe Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory. The filament shows a first step eruption on\n14 March 2015 and it stops its rise at a projected altitude ~ 125 Mm on the\nsolar disk. It remains at this height for ~ 12 hrs. Finally it eruptes on 15\nMarch 2015 and produced a halo CME. We also find jet activity in the active\nregion during both days, which could help the filament de-stabilization and\neruption. The decay index is calculated to understand this two-step eruption.\nThe eruption could be due to the presence of successive\ninstability-stability-instability zones as the filament is rising.\n", "  We present the results of numerical simulation of elastic properties of\nphagraphene, a recently predicted but not synthesized yet quasi-two-dimensional\nallotrope of graphene. We show that the Poisson'ss ratio is positive for the\nplanar configuration of phagraphene and negative for the nonplanar one. Both\nthe Poisson's ratio and the Young's modulus are isotropic for the planar\nphagraphene and strongly anisotropic for the nonplanar phagraphene.\n", "  We explore the relationship between young, embedded binaries and their parent\ncores, using observations within the Perseus Molecular Cloud. We combine\nrecently published VLA observations of young stars with core properties\nobtained from SCUBA-2 observations at 850 um. Most embedded binary systems are\nfound toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have\ncomponents closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation. We test a number of simple, evolutionary models to\naccount for the observed populations of Class 0 and I sources, both single and\nbinary. In the model that best explains the observations, all stars form\ninitially as wide binaries. These binaries either break up into separate stars\nor else shrink into tighter orbits. Under the assumption that both stars remain\nembedded following binary breakup, we find a total star formation rate of 168\nMyr^-1. Alternatively, one star may be ejected from the dense core due to\nbinary breakup. This latter assumption results in a star formation rate of 247\nMyr^-1. Both production rates are in satisfactory agreement with current\nestimates from other studies of Perseus. Future observations should be able to\ndistinguish between these two possibilities. If our model continues to provide\na good fit to other star-forming regions, then the mass fraction of dense cores\nthat becomes stars is double what is currently believed.\n", "  We demonstrate the continuous translational invariance of the energy of a\ncapillary surface in contact with reconfigurable solid boundaries. We present a\ntheoretical approach to find the energy-invariant equilibria of spherical\ncapillary surfaces in contact with solid boundaries of arbitrary shape and\nexamine the implications of dynamic frictional forces upon a reconfiguration of\nthe boundaries. Experimentally, we realise our ideas by manipulating the\nposition of a droplet in a wedge geometry using lubricant-impregnated solid\nsurfaces, which eliminate the contact-angle hysteresis and provide a test bed\nfor quantifying dissipative losses out of equilibrium. Our experiments show\nthat dissipative energy losses for an otherwise energy-invariant\nreconfiguration are relatively small, provided that the actuation timescale is\nlonger than the typical relaxation timescale of the capillary surface. We\ndiscuss the wider applicability of our ideas as a pathway for liquid\nmanipulation at no potential energy cost in low-pinning, low-friction\nsituations.\n", "  We present the results from a broadband (1 to 3 GHz), spectro-polarimetry\nstudy of the integrated emission from 100 extragalactic radio sources with the\nATCA, selected to be highly linearly polarized at 1.4 GHz. We use a general\npurpose, polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the Faraday\nrotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three\ndistinct polarized emission regions or 'RM components' of a source. Overall,\n37%/52%/11% of sources are best fit by one/two/three RM components. However,\nthese fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in\npolarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our\nanalysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4\nGHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM\ncomponent, have a steep spectral index, and a high intrinsic degree of\npolarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode\nAGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday\ndepolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is\na statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization\nbetween the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically\nordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find\na preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic magnetic field structure\nof jet-mode AGN with respect to the jet direction, while no clear preference is\nfound for the radiative-mode sources.\n", "  Polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP) loaded with different fractions of dispersed\nnano-graphene platelets (NGP) were studied by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy\nin the frequency range from 1 mHz to 1 MHz. Complex permittivity and dynamic ac\nconductivity as a function of frequency, temperature and composition were\nexplored. The concentration-dependent insulator-to-conductor transition was\ntraced through dependence of the dc conductivity and the onset of the\ndispersive ac ac conductivity. The temperature evolution of the dielectric\nspectra, below and above the fractional threshold exhibits different dynamics\nand signs the critical percolation threshold. Percolation is dictated by\nquantum penetration of the effective potential barrier set by the polymer\nmatrix operating in parallel with conduction along physical contact of NGP, in\naccordance with predictions for systems consisting of a semi-conducting matrix\nand dispersed conducting inclusions.\n", "  Some of the most spectacular failures of density-functional and Hartree-Fock\ntheories are related to an incorrect description of the so-called static\nelectron correlation. Motivated by recent progress on the N-representability\nproblem of the one-body density matrix for pure states, we propose a way to\nquantify the static contribution to the electronic correlation. By studying\nseveral molecular systems we show that our proposal correlates well with our\nintuition of static and dynamic electron correlation. Our results bring out the\nparamount importance of the occupancy of the highest occupied natural\nspin-orbital in such quantification.\n", "  In arXiv:1510.02685 we proposed linear relations between the Weyl anomaly\n$c_1, c_2, c_3$ coefficients and the 4 coefficients in the chiral anomaly\npolynomial for (1,0) superconformal 6d theories. These relations were\ndetermined up to one free parameter $\\xi$ and its value was then conjectured\nusing some additional assumptions. A different value for $\\xi$ was recently\nsuggested in arXiv:1702.03518 using a different method. Here we confirm that\nthis latter value is indeed the correct one by providing an additional data\npoint: the Weyl anomaly coefficient $c_3$ for the higher derivative (1,0)\nsuperconformal 6d vector multiplet. This multiplet contains the 4-derivative\nconformal gauge vector, 3-derivative fermion and 2-derivative scalar. We find\nthe corresponding value of $c_3$ which is proportional to the coefficient $C_T$\nin the 2-point function of stress tensor using its relation to the first\nderivative of the Renyi entropy or the second derivative of the free energy on\nthe product of thermal circle and 5d hyperbolic space. We present some general\nresults of computation of the Renyi entropy and $C_T$ from the partition\nfunction on $S^1 \\times \\mathbb H^{d-1}$ for higher derivative conformal\nscalars, spinors and vectors in even dimensions. We also give an independent\nderivation of the conformal anomaly coefficients of the higher derivative\nvector multiplet from the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients on an Einstein background.\n", "  We study, within the fluctuation exchange approximation, the\nspin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in Hubbard-type models possessing\nelectron and hole bands, and compare them with a model on a square lattice with\na large Fermi surface. In the square lattice model, superconductivity is more\nenhanced for better nesting for a fixed band filling. By contrast, in the\nmodels with electron and hole bands, superconductivity is optimized when the\nFermi surface nesting is degraded to some extent, where finite energy spin\nfluctuation around the nesting vector develops. The difference lies in the\nrobustness of the nesting vector, namely, in models with electron and hole\nbands, the wave vector at which the spin susceptibility is maximized is fixed\neven when the nesting is degraded, whereas when the Fermi surface is large, the\nnesting vector varies with the deformation of the Fermi surface. We also\ndiscuss the possibility of realizing in actual materials the bilayer Hubbard\nmodel, which is a simple model with electron and hole bands, and is expected to\nhave a very high T_c.\n", "  The Einstein equations describing the black-brane dynamics both in Minkowski\nand AdS background were recently recast in the form of coupled diffusion\nequations in the large-$D$(imension) limit. Using such results in the\nliterature, we formulate a higher-order perturbation theory of black branes in\ntime domain and present the general form of solutions for arbitrary initial\nconditions. For illustrative purposes, the solutions up to the first or second\norder are explicitly written down for several kind of initial conditions, such\nas a Gaussian wave packet, shock wave, and rather general superposed sinusoidal\nwaves. These could be the first examples describing the non-trivial evolution\nof black-brane horizons in time domain. In particular, we learn some\ninteresting aspects of black-brane dynamics such as the Gregory-Laflamme (GL)\ninstability and non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). The formalism presented\nhere would be applicable to the analysis of various black branes and their\nholographically dual field theories.\n", "  We present an analysis of 168 oscillating red giants from NASA's $Kepler$\nmission that exhibit anomalous peaks in their Fourier amplitude spectra. These\npeaks result from ellipsoidal variations which are indicative of binary star\nsystems, at frequencies such that the orbit of any stellar companion would be\nwithin the convective envelope of the red giant. Alternatively, the observed\nphenomenon may be due to a close binary orbiting a red giant in a triple\nsystem, or chance alignments of foreground or background binary systems\ncontaminating the target pixel aperture. We identify 87 stars in the sample as\nchance alignments using a combination of pixel Fourier analysis and difference\nimaging. We find that in the remaining 81 cases the anomalous peaks are\nindistinguishable from the target star to within 4$''$, suggesting a physical\nassociation. We examine a Galaxia model of the $Kepler$ field of view to\nestimate background star counts and find that it is highly unlikely that all\ntargets can be explained by chance alignments. From this, we conclude that\nthese stars may comprise a population of physically associated systems.\n", "  Over the last years a lot of theoretical and experimental efforts have been\nmade to find states with broken time reversal symmetry (BTRS) in multi-band\nsuperconductors. In particular, it was theoretically proposed that in the\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ system either an $s+is$ or an $s+id$ BTRS state\nmay exist at high doping levels in a narrow region of the phase diagram. Here\nwe report the observation of an enhanced zero field muon spin relaxation rate\nbelow the superconducting transition temperature for a high quality crystalline\nsample with $x \\approx$ 0.73. This indicates that indeed the time reversal\nsymmetry is broken in superconducting Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at this\ndoping level.\n", "  Hopf insulators are intriguing three-dimensional topological insulators\ncharacterized by an integer topological invariant. They originate from the\nmathematical theory of Hopf fibration and epitomize the deep connection between\nknot theory and topological phases of matter, which distinguishes them from\nother classes of topological insulators. Here, we implement a model Hamiltonian\nfor Hopf insulators in a solid-state quantum simulator and report the first\nexperimental observation of their topological properties, including fascinating\ntopological links associated with the Hopf fibration and the integer-valued\ntopological invariant obtained from a direct tomographic measurement. Our\nobservation of topological links and Hopf fibration in a quantum simulator\nopens the door to probe rich topological properties of Hopf insulators in\nexperiments. The quantum simulation and probing methods are also applicable to\nthe study of other intricate three-dimensional topological model Hamiltonians.\n", "  We performed very deep searches for 2 ground-state water transitions in 13\nprotoplanetary disks with the HIFI instrument on-board the Herschel Space\nObservatory, with integration times up to 12 hours per line. Two other water\ntransitions that sample warmer gas were also searched for with shallower\nintegrations. The detection rate is low, and the upper limits provided by the\nobservations are generally much lower than predictions of thermo-chemical\nmodels with canonical inputs. One ground-state transition is newly detected in\nthe stacked spectrum of AA Tau, DM Tau, LkCa 15, and MWC 480. We run a grid of\nmodels to show that the abundance of gas-phase oxygen needs to be reduced by a\nfactor of at least ~100 to be consistent with the observational upper limits\n(and positive detections) if a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 were to be\nassumed. As a continuation of previous ideas, we propose that the underlying\nreason for the depletion of oxygen (hence the low detection rate) is the\nfreeze-out of volatiles such as water and CO onto dust grains followed by grain\ngrowth and settling/migration, which permanently removes these gas-phase\nmolecules from the emissive upper layers of the outer disk. Such depletion of\nvolatiles is likely ubiquitous among different disks, though not necessarily to\nthe same degree. The volatiles might be returned back to the gas phase in the\ninner disk (within about 15 AU), which is consistent with current constraints.\nComparison with studies on disk dispersal due to photoevaporation indicates\nthat the timescale for volatile depletion is shorter than that of\nphotoevaporation.\n", "  We consider the multi-particle Anderson model on the lattice with infinite\nrange but sub-exponentially decaying interaction and show the Anderson\nlocalization consisting of the spectral exponential and the strong dynamical\nlocalization. In particular, the dynamical localization is proved int he\nHilbert-Schmidt norm. The results concern very singular probability\ndistributions such as the Bernoulli's measures.\n", "  The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data catalogue is a continuation of the\nGreenwich Photoheliographic Results providing daily positions of sunspots and\nsunspot groups. We analyse the data for sunspot groups focusing on meridional\nmotions and transfer of angular momentum towards the solar equator. Velocities\nare calculated with a daily shift method including an automatic iterative\nprocess of removing the outliers. Apart from the standard differential rotation\nprofile, we find meridional motion directed towards the zone of solar activity.\nThe difference in measured meridional flow in comparison to Doppler\nmeasurements and some other tracer measurements is interpreted as a consequence\nof different flow patterns inside and outside of active regions. We also find a\nstatistically significant dependence of meridional motion on rotation velocity\nresiduals confirming the transfer of angular momentum towards the equator.\nAnalysis of horizontal Reynolds stress reveals that the transfer of angular\nmomentum is stronger with increasing latitude up to about 40$^{\\circ}$ where\nthere is a possible maximum in absolute value.\n", "  We have performed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the temperature\ndependence of the ordering of the side chains of the X-shape liquid crystal\nmolecules which are arranged in a hexagonal array. Each hexagon contains six\nside chains, one from each side of the hexagon. Each liquid crystal molecule\nhas two, dissimilar, side chains, one that contains silicon and one containing\nfluorine. Like chains attract each other more strongly than unlike chains and\nthis drives an order-disorder transition. The system is frustrated because it\nis not possible to find a configuration in which all the hexagons are occupied\nby either all silicon or all fluorine chains. There are two phase transitions.\nIf only pairwise interactions are included it is found that there is a novel\nfluctuating phase between the disordered phase and the fully ordered ground\nstate. This did not agree with the experiments where an intermediate phase was\nseen that had long range order on one of the three sublattices. Agreement was\nfound when the calculations were modified to include attractive three body\ninteractions between the silicon chains.\n", "  Under the expectation that nature is natural, we extend the Standard Model to\ninclude SUSY to stabilize the electroweak sector and PQ symmetry to stabilize\nthe QCD sector. Then natural SUSY arises from a Kim-Nilles solution to the SUSY\nmu problem which allows for a little hierarchy where mu ~ f_a^2/M_P ~ 100-300\nGeV while the SUSY particle mass scale m(SUSY)~ 1-10 TeV >> mu. Dark matter\nthen consists of two particles: a higgsino-like WIMP and a SUSY DFSZ axion. The\nrange of allowed axion mass values m(axion) depends on the mixed axion-higgsino\nrelic density. The range of m(axion) is actually restricted in this case by\nlimits on WIMPs from direct and indirect detection experiments. We plot the\nexpected axion detection rate at microwave cavity experiments. The\naxion-photon-photon coupling is severely diminished by charged higgsino\ncontributions to the anomalous coupling. In this case, the axion may retreat,\nat least temporarily, back into the regime of near invisibility. From our\nresults, we urge new ideas for techniques which probe both deeper and more\nbroadly into axion coupling versus axion mass parameter space.\n", "  All water-covered rocky planets in the inner habitable zones of solar-type\nstars will inevitably experience a catastrophic runaway climate due to\nincreasing stellar luminosity and limits to outgoing infrared radiation from\nwet greenhouse atmospheres. Reflectors or scatterers placed near Earth's inner\nLagrange point (L1) have been proposed as a 'geo-engineering\" solution to\nanthropogenic climate change and an advanced version of this could modulate\nincident irradiation over many Gyr or \"rescue\" a planet from the interior of\nthe habitable zone. The distance of the starshade from the planet that\nminimizes its mass is 1.6 times the Earth-L1 distance. Such a starshade would\nhave to be similar in size to the planet and the mutual occultations during\nplanetary transits could produce a characteristic maximum at mid-transit in the\nlight-curve. Because of a fortuitous ratio of densities, Earth-size planets\naround G dwarf stars present the best opportunity to detect such an artifact.\nThe signal would be persistent and is potentially detectable by a future space\nphotometry mission to characterize transiting planets. The signal could be\ndistinguished from natural phenomenon, i.e. starspots or cometary dust clouds,\nby its shape, persistence, and transmission spectrum.\n", "  We have obtained low-resolution optical (0.7-0.98 micron) and near-infrared\n(1.11-1.34 micron and 0.8-2.5 micron) spectra of twelve isolated planetary-mass\ncandidates (J = 18.2-19.9 mag) of the 3-Myr sigma Orionis star cluster with a\nview to determining the spectroscopic properties of very young, substellar\ndwarfs and assembling a complete cluster mass function. We have classified our\ntargets by visual comparison with high- and low-gravity standards and by\nmeasuring newly defined spectroscopic indices. We derived L0-L4.5 and M9-L2.5\nusing high- and low-gravity standards, respectively. Our targets reveal clear\nsignposts of youth, thus corroborating their cluster membership and planetary\nmasses (6-13 Mjup). These observations complete the sigma Orionis mass function\nby spectroscopically confirming the planetary-mass domain to a confidence level\nof $\\sim$75 percent. The comparison of our spectra with BT-Settl solar\nmetallicity model atmospheres yields a temperature scale of 2350-1800 K and a\nlow surface gravity of log g ~ 4.0 [cm/s2], as would be expected for young\nplanetary-mass objects. We discuss the properties of the cluster least-massive\npopulation as a function of spectral type. We have also obtained the first\noptical spectrum of S Ori 70, a T dwarf in the direction of sigma Orionis. Our\ndata provide reference optical and near-infrared spectra of very young L dwarfs\nand a mass function that may be used as templates for future studies of\nlow-mass substellar objects and exoplanets. The extrapolation of the sigma\nOrionis mass function to the solar neighborhood may indicate that isolated\nplanetary-mass objects with temperatures of 200-300 K and masses in the\ninterval 6-13-Mjup may be as numerous as very low-mass stars.\n", "  Among the available quantum gravity proposals, string theory, loop quantum\ngravity, non-commutative geometry, group field theory, causal sets, asymptotic\nsafety, causal dynamical triangulation, emergent gravity are among the best\nmotivated models. As an introductory summary to this special issue of Comptes\nRendus Physique, I explain how those different theories can be tested or\nconstrained by cosmological observations.\n", "  Type-I bursts (i.e. noise storms) are the earliest-known type of solar radio\nemission at the metre wavelength. They are believed to be excited by\nnon-thermal energetic electrons accelerated in the corona. The underlying\ndynamic process and exact emission mechanism still remain unresolved. Here,\nwith a combined analysis of extreme ultraviolet (EUV), radio and photospheric\nmagnetic field data of unprecedented quality recorded during a type-I storm on\n30 July 2011, we identify a good correlation between the radio bursts and the\nco-spatial EUV and magnetic activities. The EUV activities manifest themselves\nas three major brightening stripes above a region adjacent to a compact\nsunspot, while the magnetic field there presents multiple moving magnetic\nfeatures (MMFs) with persistent coalescence or cancelation and a\nmorphologically similar three-part distribution. We find that the type-I\nintensities are correlated with those of the EUV emissions at various\nwavelengths with a correlation coefficient of 0.7-0.8. In addition, in the\nregion between the brightening EUV stripes and the radio sources there appear\nconsistent dynamic motions with a series of bi-directional flows, suggesting\nongoing small-scale reconnection there. Mainly based on the induced connection\nbetween the magnetic motion at the photosphere and the EUV and radio activities\nin the corona, we suggest that the observed type-I noise storms and the EUV\nbrightening activities are the consequence of small-scale magnetic reconnection\ndriven by MMFs. This is in support of the original proposal made by Bentely et\nal. (Solar Phys. 193, 227, 2000).\n", "  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star or sub-stellar object passes\nclose enough to a galaxy's supermassive black hole to be disrupted by tidal\nforces. NGC 4845 (d=17 Mpc) was host to a TDE, IGR J12580+0134, detected in\nNovember 2010. Its proximity offers us a unique close-up of the TDE and its\naftermath. We discuss new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Karl G. Jansky\nVery Large Array (JVLA) observations, which show that the radio flux from the\nactive nucleus created by the TDE has decayed in a manner consistent with\npredictions from a jet-circumnuclear medium interaction model. This model\nexplains the source's broadband spectral evolution, which shows a spectral peak\nthat has moved from the submm (at the end of 2010) to GHz radio frequencies (in\n2011-2013) to <1 GHz in 2015. The milliarcsecond-scale core is circularly\npolarized at 1.5 GHz but not at 5 GHz, consistent with the model. The VLBA\nimages show a complex structure at 1.5 GHz that includes an east west extension\n~40 milliarcsec (3 pc) long as well as a resolved component 52 milliarcsec (4.1\npc) northwest of the flat-spectrum core, which is all that can be seen at 5\nGHz. If ejected in 2010, the NW component must have had v=0.96 c over five\nyears. However, this is unlikely, as our model suggests strong deceleration to\nspeeds < 0.5c within months and a much smaller, sub-parsec size. In this\ninterpretation, the northwest component could have either a non-nuclear origin\nor be from an earlier event.\n", "  We analyse flows around a rotating black hole and obtain self-consistent\naccretion-ejection solutions in full general relativistic prescription. Entire\nenergy-angular momentum parameter space is investigated in the advective regime\nto obtain shocked and shock-free accretion solutions. Jet equations of motion\nare solved along the von-Zeipel surfaces computed from the post-shock disc,\nsimultaneously with the equations of accretion disc along the equatorial plane.\nFor a given spin parameter, the mass outflow rate increases as the shock moves\ncloser to the black hole, but eventually decreases, maximizing at some\nintermediate value of shock location. Interestingly, we obtain all types of\npossible jet solutions, for example, steady shock solution with multiple\ncritical points, bound solution with two critical points and smooth solution\nwith single critical point. Multiple critical points may exist in jet solution\nfor spin parameter $a_s\\ge 0.5$. The jet terminal speed generally increases if\nthe accretion shock forms closer to the horizon and is higher for corotating\nblack hole than the counter-rotating and the non-rotating one. Quantitatively\nspeaking, shocks in jet may form for spin parameter $a_s>0.6$ and jet shocks\nrange between $6r_g$ and $130r_g$ above the equatorial plane, while the jet\nterminal speed $v_{{\\rm j}\\infty} > 0.35{\\cm}$ if Bernoulli parameter ${\\cal\nE}\\geq1.01$ for $a_s>0.99$.\n", "  Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are the most luminous supernovae in the\nuniverse. They are found in extreme star-forming galaxies and are probably\nconnected with the death of massive stars. One hallmark of very massive\nprogenitors would be a tendency to explode in very dense, UV-bright, and blue\nregions. In this paper we investigate the resolved host galaxy properties of\ntwo nearby hydrogen-poor SLSNe, PTF~11hrq and PTF~12dam. For both galaxies\n\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} multi-filter images were obtained.\nAdditionally, we performe integral field spectroscopy of the host galaxy of\nPTF~11hrq using the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer\n(VLT/MUSE), and investigate the line strength, metallicity and kinematics.\nNeither PTF~11hrq nor PTF~12dam occurred in the bluest part of their host\ngalaxies, although both galaxies have overall blue UV-to-optical colors. The\nMUSE data reveal a bright starbursting region in the host of PTF~11hrq,\nalthough far from the SN location. The SN exploded close to a region with\ndisturbed kinematics, bluer color, stronger [OIII], and lower metallicity. The\nhost galaxy is likely interacting with a companion. PTF~12dam occurred in one\nof the brightest pixels, in a starbursting galaxy with a complex morphology and\na tidal tail, where interaction is also very likely. We speculate that SLSN\nexplosions may originate from stars generated during star-formation episodes\ntriggered by interaction. High resolution imaging and integral field\nspectroscopy are fundamental for a better understanding of SLSNe explosion\nsites and how star formation varies across their host galaxies.\n", "  We present the results of our analysis of new optical, ultraviolet (UV) and\nX-ray observations of a highly variable source $-$ AX J1549.8$-$5416. Both the\ndetection of several fast rise, exponential decay outbursts in the optical\nlight curve and the lack of He II emission lines in the optical spectra suggest\nAX J1549.8$-$5416 is a cataclysmic variable of the dwarf nova (DN) type. The\nmultiwavelength analysis of three mini-outbursts and one normal outburst\nrepresent one of the most complete multiwavelength studies of a DN and help to\nrefine the relationship between the X-ray, UV and optical emission in this\nsystem. We find that the UV emission is delayed with respect to the optical by\n$1.0-5.4$ days during the rising phase of the outburst. The X-ray emission is\nsuppressed during the peak of the optical outburst and recovers during the end\nof the outburst. From our analysis of archival Swift, Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations of AX J1549.8$-$5416, we estimate this DN has a high duty cycle\n($\\sim50\\%$), suggesting a quiescent X-ray luminosity larger than $10^{32}$\nerg/s. We also find the X-ray and UV flux are roughly anti-correlated.\nFurthermore, we find that, at low X-ray fluxes, the X-ray spectrum is well\ndescribed by a single temperature thermal plasma model, while at high X-ray\nfluxes, an isobaric cooling flow model also works. We find that the maximum\ntemperature of the plasma in quiescence is significantly higher than that in\noutburst.\n", "  Pulsar Wind Nebulae, Blazars, Gamma Ray Bursts and Magnetars all contain\nregions where the electromagnetic energy density greatly exceeds the plasma\nenergy density. These sources exhibit dramatic flaring activity where the\nelectromagnetic energy distributed over large volumes, appears to be converted\nefficiently into high energy particles and gamma-rays. We call this general\nprocess magnetoluminescence. Global requirements on the underlying, extreme\nparticle acceleration processes are described and the likely importance of\nrelativistic beaming in enhancing the observed radiation from a flare is\nemphasized. Recent research on fluid descriptions of unstable electromagnetic\nconfigurations are summarized and progress on the associated kinetic\nsimulations that are needed to account for the acceleration and radiation is\ndiscussed. Future observational, simulation and experimental opportunities are\nbriefly summarized.\n", "  We present a new method for numerical hydrodynamics which uses a\nmultidimensional generalisation of the Roe solver and operates on an\nunstructured triangular mesh. The main advantage over traditional methods based\non Riemann solvers, which commonly use one-dimensional flux estimates as\nbuilding blocks for a multidimensional integration, is its inherently\nmultidimensional nature, and as a consequence its ability to recognise\nmultidimensional stationary states that are not hydrostatic. A second novelty\nis the focus on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). By tailoring the algorithms\nspecifically to GPUs we are able to get speedups of 100-250 compared to a\ndesktop machine. We compare the multidimensional upwind scheme to a\ntraditional, dimensionally split implementation of the Roe solver on several\ntest problems, and we find that the new method significantly outperforms the\nRoe solver in almost all cases. This comes with increased computational costs\nper time step, which makes the new method approximately a factor of 2 slower\nthan a dimensionally split scheme acting on a structured grid.\n", "  We show the combined spectral analysis of \\emph{Chandra} high energy\ntransmission grating (HETG) and \\emph{XMM-Newton} reflection grating\nspectrometer (RGS) observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 111. The\nsource is known to show excess neutral absorption with respect to the one\nestimated from 21 cm radio surveys of atomic H I in the Galaxy. However,\nprevious works were not able to constrain the origin of such absorber as local\nto our Milky Way or intrinsic to the source ($z = 0.0485$). The high\nsignal-to-noise grating spectra allow us to constrain the excess absorption as\ndue to intervening gas in the Milky Way, and we estimate a time averaged total\ncolumn density of $N_H = (7.4\\pm0.1)\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a factor of two\nhigher than the tabulated H I value. We recommend to use the total average\nGalactic column density here estimated when studying 3C 111. The origin of the\nextra Galactic absorption of $N_H = 4.4\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ is likely due\nto molecular gas associated with the Taurus molecular cloud complex toward 3C\n111, which is our nearest star-forming region. We also detect a weak\n(EW$=$$16\\pm10$ eV) and narrow (FWMH$<$5,500 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with\noptical H$\\alpha$) Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line at E$=$6.4 keV likely from the\ntorus in the central regions of 3C 111, and we place an upper limit on the\ncolumn density of a possible intrinsic warm absorber of\n$N_H$$<$$2.5\\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. These complexities make 3C 111 a very\npromising object for studying both the intrinsic properties of this active\nradio galaxy and the Galactic interstellar medium if used as a background\nsource.\n", "  The ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) at\nCERN LHC is presently equipped with Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs). A\ngating grid prevents ions produced during the gas amplification from moving\ninto the drift volume. The maximum drift time of the electrons together with\nthe closure time of the gating grid allows a maximum readout rate of about 3\nkHz. After the Long Shutdown 2 (from 2021 onwards), the LHC will provide\nlead-lead collisions at an expected interaction rate of 50 kHz. To take data at\nthis rate the TPC will be upgraded with new readout chambers, allowing for\ncontinuous read-out and preserving the energy and momentum resolution of the\ncurrent MWPCs.\n  Chambers with a stack of four Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) fulfil all the\nperformance requirements, if the voltages applied to the GEMs are tuned\nproperly. In order to ensure that these chambers are stable while being\noperated at the LHC, studies of the discharge behaviour were performed. We\nreport on studies done with small prototypes equipped with one or two GEMs.\nDischarges were voluntarily induced by a combination of high-voltages across\nthe GEM(s) and highly ionising particles. During these studies, the phenomenon\nof \"secondary discharges\" has been observed. These occur only after an initial\ndischarge when the electric field above or below the GEM is high enough. The\ntime between the initial and the secondary discharge ranges from several 10 us\nto less than 1 us, decreasing with increasing field. Using decoupling resistors\nin the high-voltage supply path of the bottom side of the GEM shifts the\noccurrence of these discharges to higher electric fields.\n", "  We have analyzed all available archival XMM-Newton observations of X Comae, a\nbright X-ray quasar behind the Coma cluster, to study the properties of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium in the vicinity of the nearest massive galaxy\ncluster. The RGS observations confirm the possible presence of a Ne IX K-alpha\nabsorption line at the redshift of Coma, although with a limited statistical\nsignificance. This analysis is therefore in line with the earlier analysis by\nTakei et al. (2007) based on a sub-set of these data. Its large column density\nand optical depth, however, point to implausible conditions for the absorbing\nmedium, thereby casting serious doubts to its reality. Chandra has never\nobserved X Comae and therefore cannot provide additional information on this\nsource. We combine upper limits to the presence of other X-ray absorption lines\n(notably from O VII and O VIII) at the redshift of Coma with positive\nmeasurements of the soft excess emission from Coma measured by ROSAT (Bonamente\net al. 2003). The combination of emission from warm-hot gas at kT~1/4 keV and\nupper limits from absorption lines provide useful constraints on the density\nand the sightline length of the putative WHIM towards Coma. We conclude that\nthe putative warm-hot medium towards Coma is consistent with expected\nproperties, with a baryon overdensity >=10 and a sightline extent of order of\ntens of Mpc.\n", "  The spin relaxation in chromium spinel oxides $A$Cr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ ($A=$ Mg,\nZn, Cd) is investigated in the paramagnetic regime by electron spin resonance\n(ESR). The temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth indicates an\nunconventional spin-relaxation behavior, similar to spin-spin relaxation in the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) chromium-oxide triangular lattice antiferromagnets. The\ndata can be described in terms of a generalized Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT) type scenario for 2D systems with additional internal symmetries. Based\non the characteristic exponents obtained from the evaluation of the ESR\nlinewidth, short-range order with a hidden internal symmetry is suggested.\n", "  We study the effect of scalar leptoquark and $Z^\\prime$ boson on the rare\ndecays of $D$ mesons involving flavour changing transitions $c \\to u l^+ l^-\n(l^\\mp_i l^\\pm_j)$. We constrain the new physics parameter space using the\nbranching ratio of the rare decay mode $D^0 \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and the $D^0-\\bar\nD^0$ oscillation data. We compute the branching ratios, forward-backward\nasymmetry parameters and flat terms in $D^{+(0)} \\to \\pi^{+(0)} \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\nprocesses using the constrained parameters. The branching ratios of the lepton\nflavour violating $D$ meson decays, such as $D^0 \\to \\mu e, ~\\tau e$ and\n$D^{+(0)} \\to \\pi^{+(0)} \\mu^- e^+$ are also investigated.\n", "  We examine the conditions under which material from the martian moons Phobos\nand Deimos could reach our planet in the form of meteorites. We find that the\nnecessary ejection speeds from these moons (900 and 600 m/s for Phobos and\nDeimos respectively) are much smaller than from Mars' surface (5000 m/s). These\nspeeds are below typical impact speeds for asteroids and comets (10-40 km/s) at\nMars' orbit, and we conclude that the delivery of meteorites from Phobos and\nDeimos to the Earth can occur.\n", "  The internal dynamics of globular clusters (GCs) is strongly affected by\ntwo-body interactions that bring the systems to a state of partial energy\nequipartition. Using a set of Monte Carlo clusters simulations, we investigate\nthe role of the onset of energy equipartition in shaping the mass-to-light\nratio (M/L) in GCs. Our simulations show that the M/L profiles cannot be\nconsidered constant and their specific shape strongly depends on the dynamical\nage of the clusters. Dynamically younger clusters display a central peak up to\nM/L $\\simeq25$ $M_\\odot/L_\\odot$ caused by the retention of dark remnants; this\npeak flattens out for dynamically older clusters. Moreover, we find that also\nthe global values of M/L correlate with the dynamical state of a cluster\nquantified as either the number of relaxation times a system has experienced\n$n_{rel}$ or the equipartition parameter $m_{eq}$: clusters closer to full\nequipartition (higher $n_{rel}$ or lower $m_{eq}$) display a lower M/L. We show\nthat the decrease of M/L is primarily driven by the dynamical ejection of dark\nremnants, rather than by the escape of low-mass stars. The predictions of our\nmodels are in good agreement with observations of GCs in the Milky Way and M31,\nindicating that differences in relaxation state alone can explain variations of\nM/L up to a factor of $\\simeq3$. Our characterization of the M/L as a function\nof relaxation state is of primary relevance for the application and\ninterpretation of dynamical models.\n", "  The increasing number of spectra gathered by spectroscopic sky surveys and\ntransiting exoplanet follow-up has pushed the community to develop automated\ntools for atmospheric stellar parameters determination. Here we present a novel\napproach that allows the measurement of temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$),\nmetallicity ($[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm H}]$) and gravity ($\\log g$) within a few seconds\nand in a completely automated fashion. Rather than performing comparisons with\nspectral libraries, our technique is based on the determination of several\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) obtained by including spectral features with\ndifferent sensitivity to the photospheric parameters. We use literature stellar\nparameters of high signal-to-noise ($\\textrm{SNR}$), high-resolution HARPS\nspectra of FGK Main Sequence stars to calibrate $T_{\\rm eff}$, $[{\\rm Fe}/{\\rm\nH}]$ and $\\log g$ as a function of CCFs parameters. Our technique is validated\nusing low $\\textrm{SNR}$ spectra obtained with the same instrument. For FGK\nstars we achieve a precision of $\\sigma_{T_{\\rm eff}} = 50$ K, $\\sigma_{\\log g}\n= 0.09~ \\textrm{dex}$ and $\\sigma_{\\textrm{Fe}/\\textrm{H}]} =0.035~\n\\textrm{dex}$ at $\\textrm{SNR}=50 $, while the precision for observation with\n$\\textrm{SNR} \\gtrsim 100$ and the overall accuracy are constrained by the\nliterature values used to calibrate the CCFs. Our approach can be easily\nextended to other instruments with similar spectral range and resolution, or to\nother spectral range and stars other than FGK dwarfs if a large sample of\nreference stars is available for the calibration. Additionally, we provide the\nmathematical formulation to convert synthetic equivalent widths to CCF\nparameters as an alternative to direct calibration. We have made our tool\npublicly available.\n", "  From measuring the annual parallax of water masers over one and a half years\nwith VERA, we present the trigonometric parallax and corresponding distance of\nanother newly identified water maser source in the region of IRAS 20231+3440 as\n$\\pi=0.611\\pm0.022$ mas and $D=1.64\\pm0.06$ kpc respectively. We measured the\nabsolute proper motions of all the newly detected maser spots (30 spots) and\npresented two pictures describing the possible spatial distribution of the\nwater maser as the morphology marks out an arc of masers whose average proper\nmotion velocity in the jet direction was 14.26 km s$^{-1}$. As revealed by the\nALLWISE composite image, and by applying the colour-colour method of YSO\nidentification and classification on photometric archived data, we identified\nthe driving source of the north maser group to be a class I, young stellar\nobject. To further probe the nature of the progenitor, we used the momentum\nrate maximum value (1.2$\\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ km s$^{-1}$) of\nthe outflow to satisfy that the progenitor under investigation is a low mass\nyoung stellar object concurrently forming alongside an intermediate-mass YSO\n$\\sim 60,000$ au ($\\sim 37$ arcsecs) away from it.\n", "  How the solar corona is heated to high temperatures remains an unsolved\nmystery in solar physics. In the present study we analyse observations of 50\nwhole active-region loops taken with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode satellite. Eleven loops were classified\nas cool (<1 MK) and 39 as warm (1-2 MK) loops. We study their plasma parameters\nsuch as densities, temperatures, filling factors, non-thermal velocities and\nDoppler velocities. We combine spectroscopic analysis with linear force-free\nmagnetic-field extrapolation to derive the three-dimensional structure and\npositioning of the loops, their lengths and heights as well as the magnetic\nfield strength along the loops. We use density-sensitive line pairs from Fe\nXII, Fe XIII, Si X and Mg VII ions to obtain electron densities by taking\nspecial care of intensity background-subtraction. The emission-measure loci\nmethod is used to obtain the loop temperatures. We find that the loops are\nnearly isothermal along the line-of-sight. Their filling factors are between 8%\nand 89%. We also compare the observed parameters with the theoretical RTV\nscaling law. We find that most of the loops are in an overpressure state\nrelative to the RTV predictions. In a followup study, we will report a heating\nmodel of a parallel-cascade-based mechanism and will compare the model\nparameters with the loop plasma and structural parameters derived here.\n", "  The characteristics of the inner Galaxy remain obscured by significant dust\nextinction, and hence infrared surveys are useful to find young Cepheids whose\ndistances and ages can be accurately determined. A near-infrared photometric\nand spectroscopic survey was carried out and three classical Cepheids were\nunveiled in the inner disk, around 20 and 30 degrees in Galactic longitude. The\ntargets feature small Galactocentric distances, 3-5 kpc, and their velocities\nare important as they may be under the environmental influence of the Galactic\nbar. While one of the Cepheids has radial velocity consistent with the Galactic\nrotation, the other two are moving significantly slower. We also compare their\nkinematics with that of high-mass star-forming regions with parallactic\ndistances measured.\n", "  We report identification of the optical counterpart to the companion of the\nmillisecond pulsar J2317+1439. At the timing position of the pulsar, we find an\nobject with $g=22.96\\pm0.05$, $r=22.86\\pm0.04$ and $i=22.82\\pm0.05$. The\nmagnitudes and colors of the object are consistent with it being a white dwarf.\nBy comparing with white dwarf cooling models, we estimate that it has a mass of\n$0.39^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, an effective temperature of\n$8077^{+550}_{-470}$ K and a cooling age of $10.9\\pm0.3$ Gyr. Combining our\nresults with published constraints on the orbital parameters obtained through\npulsar timing, we estimate the pulsar mass to be $3.4^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. Although the constraint on the pulsar mass is still weak, there is\na significant possibility that the pulsar could be more massive than two solar\nmass.\n", "  Scalar Tensor Vector Gravity (STVG) is an alternative theory of gravitation\nthat has successfully explained the rotation curves of nearby galaxies, the\ndynamics of galactic clusters, and cosmological data without dark matter, but\nhas hardly been tested in the strong gravity regime. In this work, we aim at\nbuilding radiative models of thin accretion disks for both Schwarzschild and\nKerr black holes in STVG theory. In particular, we study stable circular\nequatorial orbits around stellar and supermassive black holes in Schwarzschild\nand Kerr STVG spacetimes. We also calculate the temperature and luminosity\ndistributions of accretion disks around these objects. We find that accretion\ndisks in STVG around stellar and supermassive black holes are colder and less\nluminous than in GR. The spectral energy distributions obtained do not\ncontradict current astronomical observations.\n", "  Massive scalar fields are considered in the gravitational field produced by a\nSchwarzschild black hole with a global monopole in $f(R)$ gravity. The exact\nsolution of the radial part of the Klein-Gordon equation in this background is\nobtained and is given in terms of the general Heun functions. We apply the\nproperties of the general Heun functions to study the Hawking radiation and the\nresonant frequencies of scalar particles.\n", "  The Orion OB1a sub-association is a rich low mass star (LMS) region. Previous\nspectroscopic studies have confirmed 160 LMSs in the 25 Orionis stellar group\n(25 Ori), which is the most prominent overdensity of Orion OB1a. Nonetheless,\nthe current census of the 25 Ori members is estimated to be less than 50%\ncomplete, leaving a large number of members to be still confirmed. We retrieved\n172 low-resolution stellar spectra in Orion OB1a observed as ancillary science\nin the SDSS-III/BOSS survey, for which we classified their spectral types and\ndetermined physical parameters. To determine memberships, we analyzed the\nH$_\\alpha$ emission, LiI$\\lambda$6708 absorption, and NaI$\\lambda\\lambda$8183,\n8195 absorption as youth indicators in stars classified as M-type. We report 50\nnew LMSs spread across the 25 Orionis, ASCC 18, and ASCC 20 stellar groups with\nspectral types from M0 to M6, corresponding to a mass range of 0.10$\\le\nm/\\textrm{M}_\\odot \\le$0.58. This represents an increase of 50% in the number\nof known LMSs in the area and a net increase of 20% in the number of 25 Ori\nmembers in this mass range. Using parallax values from the Gaia DR1 catalog, we\nestimated the distances to these three stellar groups and found that they are\nall co-distant, at 338$\\pm$66 pc. We analyzed the spectral energy distributions\nof these LMSs and classified their disks by evolutionary classes. Using H-R\ndiagrams, we found a suggestion that 25 Ori could be slightly older that the\nother two observed groups in Orion OB1a.\n", "  Configurations of a single semiflexible polymer is studied when it is pushed\ninto a nanochannel in the case where the polymer persistence length $l_p$ is\nmuch longer than the channel diameter $D$, i.e. $l_p/D \\gg 1$. Using numerical\nsimulations, we show that the polymer undergoes a sequence of recurring\nstructural transitions upon longitudinal compression, i.e. random deflection\nalong the channel, helix going around the channel wall, double-fold random\ndeflection, double-fold helix, etc. We find that the helix transition can be\nunderstood as buckling of deflection segments, and the initial helix formation\ntakes place at very small compression with no appreciable weak compression\nregime of the random deflection polymer.\n", "  We propose an intuitive method, called time-dependent population imaging\n(TDPI), to map the dynamical processes of high harmonic generation (HHG) in\nsolids by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE). It is\nshown that the real-time dynamical characteristics of HHG in solids, such as\nthe instantaneous photon energies of emitted harmonics, can be read directly\nfrom the energy-resolved population oscillations of electrons in the TDPIs.\nMeanwhile, the short and long trajectories of solid HHG are illustrated clearly\nfrom TDPI. By using the TDPI, we also investigate the effects of\ncarrier-envelope phase (CEP) in few-cycle pulses and intuitively demonstrate\nthe HHG dynamics driven by two-color fields. Our results show that the TDPI\nprovides a powerful tool to study the ultrafast dynamics in strong fields for\nvarious laser-solid configurations and gain an insight into HHG processes in\nsolids.\n", "  We performed resistance measurements on Fe$_{1+\\delta-x}$Cu$_{x}$Te with\n$x_{EDX}\\leq 0.06$ in the presence of in-plane applied magnetic fields,\nrevealing a resistance anisotropy that can be induced at a temperature far\nbelow the structural and magnetic zero-field transition temperatures. The\nobserved resistance anisotropy strongly depends on the field orientation with\nrespect to the crystallographic axes, as well as on the field-cooling history.\nOur results imply a correlation between the observed features and the\nlow-temperature magnetic order. Hysteresis in the angle-dependence indicates a\nstrong pinning of the magnetic order within a temperature range that varies\nwith the Cu content. The resistance anisotropy vanishes at different\ntemperatures depending on whether an external magnetic field or a remnant field\nis present: the closing temperature is higher in the presence of an external\nfield. For $x_{EDX} = 0.06$ the resistance anisotropy closes above the\nstructural transition, at the same temperature at which the zero-field\nshort-range magnetic order disappears and the sample becomes paramagnetic. Thus\nwe suggest that under an external magnetic field the resistance anisotropy\nmirrors the magnetic order parameter. We discuss similarities to nematic order\nobserved in other iron pnictide materials.\n", "  The Casimir free energy of dielectric films, both free-standing in vacuum and\ndeposited on metallic or dielectric plates, is investigated. It is shown that\nthe values of the free energy depend considerably on whether the calculation\napproach used neglects or takes into account the dc conductivity of film\nmaterial. We demonstrate that there are the material-dependent and universal\nclassical limits in the former and latter cases, respectively. The analytic\nbehavior of the Casimir free energy and entropy for a free-standing dielectric\nfilm at low temperature in found. According to our results, the Casimir entropy\ngoes to zero when the temperature vanishes if the calculation approach with\nneglected dc conductivity of a film is employed. If the dc conductivity is\ntaken into account, the Casimir entropy takes the positive value at zero\ntemperature, depending on the parameters of a film, i.e., the Nernst heat\ntheorem is violated. By considering the Casimir free energy of silica and\nsapphire films deposited on a Au plate in the framework of two calculation\napproaches, we argue that physically correct values are obtained by\ndisregarding the role of dc conductivity. A comparison with the well known\nresults for the configuration of two parallel plates is made. Finally, we\ncompute the Casimir free energy of silica, sapphire and Ge films deposited on\nhigh-resistivity Si plates of different thicknesses and demonstrate that it can\nbe positive, negative and equal to zero. Possible applications of the obtained\nresults to thin films used in microelectronics are discussed.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a new fast radio burst, FRB 150215, with the\nParkes radio telescope on 2015 February 15. The burst was detected in real time\nwith a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6$\\pm$0.8 pc cm^{-3}, a pulse duration\nof 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5} ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming the burst\nwas at beam center of 0.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic\nlongitude and latitude of 24.66^{\\circ}, 5.28^{\\circ}, 25 degrees away from the\nGalactic Center. The burst was found to be 43$\\pm$5% linearly polarized with a\nrotation measure (RM) in the range -9 < RM < 12 rad m^{-2} (95% confidence\nlevel), consistent with zero. The burst was followed-up with 11 telescopes to\nsearch for radio, optical, X-ray, gamma-ray and neutrino emission. Neither\ntransient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and\nno repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 hours of observing. The sightline\nto the burst is close to the Galactic plane and the observed physical\nproperties of FRB 150215 demonstrate the existence of sight lines of\nanomalously low RM for a given electron column density. The Galactic RM\nforeground may approach a null value due to magnetic field reversals along the\nline of sight, a decreased total electron column density from the Milky Way, or\nsome combination of these effects. A lower Galactic DM contribution might\nexplain why this burst was detectable whereas previous searches at low latitude\nhave had lower detection rates than those out of the plane.\n", "  Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy we investigate the\nadsorption properties and ring-closing reaction of a diarylethene derivative\n(C5F-4Py) on a Ag(111) surface. We identify an electron-induced reaction\nmechanism, with a quantum yield varying from $10^{-14}-10^{-9}$ per electron\nupon variation of the bias voltage from $1-2$ V. We ascribe the drastic\nincrease in switching efficiency to a resonant enhancement upon tunneling\nthrough molecular orbitals. Additionally, we resolve the ring-closing reaction\neven in the absence of a current passing through the molecule. In this case the\nelectric-field can modify the reaction barrier, leading to a finite switching\nprobability at 4.8 K. A detailed analysis of the switching events shows that a\nsimple plate-capacitor model for the tip-surface junction is insufficient to\nexplain the distance dependence of the switching voltage. Instead, describing\nthe tip as a sphere is in agreement with the findings. We resolve small\ndifferences in the adsorption configuration of the closed isomer, when\ncomparing the electron- and field-induced switching product.\n", "  Background: Composed systems have became of great interest in the framework\nof the ground state quantum phase transitions (QPTs) and many of their\nproperties have been studied in detail. However, in these systems the study of\nthe so called excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have not\nreceived so much attention.\n  Purpose: A quantum analysis of the ESQPTs in the two-fluid Lipkin model is\npresented in this work. The study is performed through the Hamiltonian\ndiagonalization for selected values of the control parameters in order to cover\nthe most interesting regions of the system phase diagram. [Method:] A\nHamiltonian that resembles the consistent-Q Hamiltonian of the interacting\nboson model (IBM) is diagonalized for selected values of the parameters and\nproperties such as the density of states, the Peres lattices, the\nnearest-neighbor spacing distribution, and the participation ratio are\nanalyzed.\n  Results: An overview of the spectrum of the two-fluid Lipkin model for\nselected positions in the phase diagram has been obtained. The location of the\nexcited-state quantum phase transition can be easily singled out with the Peres\nlattice, with the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution, with Poincar\\'e\nsections or with the participation ratio.\n  Conclusions: This study completes the analysis of QPTs for the two-fluid\nLipkin model, extending the previous study to excited states. The ESQPT\nsignatures in composed systems behave in the same way as in single ones,\nalthough the evidences of their presence can be sometimes blurred. The Peres\nlattice turns out to be a convenient tool to look into the position of the\nESQPT and to define the concept of phase in the excited states realm.\n", "  We present the results of hydrodynamic simulations examining migration and\ngrowth of planets embedded in self-gravitating circumbinary discs. The binary\nstar parameters are chosen to mimic those of the Kepler-16, -34 and -35\nsystems; the aim of this study is to examine the role of disc mass in\ndetermining the stopping locations of migrating planets at the edge of the\ncavity created by the central binary. Disc self-gravity can cause significant\nshrinkage of the cavity for disc masses in excess of 5--10 $\\times$ the minimum\nmass solar nebula model. Planets forming early in the disc lifetime can migrate\nthrough the disc and stall at locations closer to the central star than is\nnormally the case for lower mass discs, resulting in closer agreement between\nsimulated and observed orbital architecture. The presence of a planet orbiting\nin the cavity of a massive disc can prevent the cavity size from expanding to\nthe size of a lower mass disc. As the disc mass reduces over long time scales,\nthis indicates that circumbinary planet systems retain memory of their initial\nconditions. Our simulations produce planetary orbits in good agreement with\nKepler-16b without the need for self-gravity; Kepler-34 analogue systems\nproduce wide and highly eccentric cavities, and self-gravity improves the\nagreement between simulations and data. Kepler-35b is more difficult to explain\nin detail due to it's relatively low mass, which results in the simulated\nstopping location being at a larger radius than that observed.\n", "  We investigate dynamical equilibration of expectation values in closed\nquantum systems for realistic non-equilibrium initial states. Thereby we find\nthat the corresponding long time expectation values depend on the initial\nexpectation values if eigenstate thermalization is violated. An analytical\nexpression for the deviation from the expected ensemble value is derived for\nsmall displacements from equilibrium. Additional numerics for magnetization and\nenergy equilibration in an asymmetric anisotropic spin-1/2-ladder demonstrate\nthat the analytical predictions persist beyond the limits of the theory. The\nresults suggest eigenstate thermalization as physically necessary condition for\ninitial state independent equilibration.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the impact of AGN accretion and feedback on\nthe star formation history of barred disc galaxies. Our goal is to determine\nwhether the effect of feedback is positive (enhanced star formation) or\nnegative (quenched star formation), and to what extent. We performed a series\nof 12 hydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies, 10 barred and 2 unbarred,\nwith various initial gas fractions and AGN feedback prescriptions. In barred\ngalaxies, gas is driven toward the centre of the galaxy and causes a starburst,\nfollowed by a slow decay, while in unbarred galaxies the SFR increases slowly\nand steadily. AGN feedback suppresses star formation near the central black\nhole. Gas is pushed away from the black hole, and collides head-on with\ninflowing gas, forming a dense ring at a finite radius where star formation is\nenhanced. We conclude that both negative and positive feedback are present, and\nthese effects mostly cancel out. There is no net quenching or enhancement in\nstar formation, but rather a displacement of the star formation sites to larger\nradii. In unbarred galaxies, where the density of the central gas is lower,\nquenching of star formation near the black hole is more efficient, and\nenhancement of star formation at larger radii is less efficient. As a result,\nnegative feedback dominates. Lowering the gas fraction reduces the star\nformation rate at all radii, whether or not there is a bar or an AGN.\n", "  We present ALMA CO (2-1) detections in 11 gas-rich cluster galaxies at z~1.6,\nconstituting the largest sample of molecular gas measurements in z>1.5 clusters\nto date. The observations span three galaxy clusters, derived from the Spitzer\nAdaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey. We augment the >5sigma\ndetections of the CO (2-1) fluxes with multi-band photometry, yielding stellar\nmasses and infrared-derived star formation rates, to place some of the first\nconstraints on molecular gas properties in z~1.6 cluster environments. We\nmeasure sizable gas reservoirs of 0.5-2x10^11 solar masses in these objects,\nwith high gas fractions and long depletion timescales, averaging 62% and 1.4\nGyr, respectively. We compare our cluster galaxies to the scaling relations of\nthe coeval field, in the context of how gas fractions and depletion timescales\nvary with respect to the star-forming main sequence. We find that our cluster\ngalaxies lie systematically off the field scaling relations at z=1.6 toward\nenhanced gas fractions, at a level of ~4sigma, but have consistent depletion\ntimescales. Exploiting CO detections in lower-redshift clusters from the\nliterature, we investigate the evolution of the gas fraction in cluster\ngalaxies, finding it to mimic the strong rise with redshift in the field. We\nemphasize the utility of detecting abundant gas-rich galaxies in high-redshift\nclusters, deeming them as crucial laboratories for future statistical studies.\n", "  Convective mixing in Helium-core-burning (HeCB) stars is one of the\noutstanding issues in stellar modelling. The precise asteroseismic measurements\nof gravity-modes period spacing ($\\Delta\\Pi_1$) has opened the door to detailed\nstudies of the near-core structure of such stars, which had not been possible\nbefore. Here we provide stringent tests of various core-mixing scenarios\nagainst the largely unbiased population of red-clump stars belonging to the old\nopen clusters monitored by Kepler, and by coupling the updated precise\ninference on $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ in thousands field stars with spectroscopic\nconstraints. We find that models with moderate overshooting successfully\nreproduce the range observed of $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ in clusters. In particular we\nshow that there is no evidence for the need to extend the size of the\nadiabatically stratified core, at least at the beginning of the HeCB phase.\nThis conclusion is based primarily on ensemble studies of $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ as a\nfunction of mass and metallicity. While $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ shows no appreciable\ndependence on the mass, we have found a clear dependence of $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ on\nmetallicity, which is also supported by predictions from models.\n", "  We test the bandpass smoothness performance of two prototype Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) SKA1-Low log-periodic dipole antennas, the SKALA2 and SKALA3 (`SKA\nLog-periodic Antenna'), and the current dipole from the Murchison Widefield\nArray (MWA) precursor telescope. Throughout this paper, we refer to the output\ncomplex-valued voltage response of an antenna when connected to a low noise\namplifier (LNA), as the dipole bandpass. In Paper I (de Lera Acedo et al.\n2017), the bandpass spectral response of the log-periodic antenna being\ndeveloped for the SKA1-Low was estimated using numerical electromagnetic\nsimulations and analyzed using low-order polynomial fittings and it was\ncompared with the HERA antenna against the delay spectrum metric. In this work,\nrealistic simulations of the SKA1-Low instrument, including frequency-dependent\nprimary beams and array configuration, are used with a weighted least-squares\npolynomial estimator to assess the ability of prototype antennas to perform the\nSKA Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) statistical experiments. This work complements\nthe ideal estimator tolerances computed for the proposed EoR science\nexperiments in Trott & Wayth (2016), with the realised performance of an\noptimal and standard estimation (calibration) procedure. With a sufficient sky\ncalibration model at higher frequencies, all antennas have bandpasses that are\nsufficiently smooth to meet the tolerances described in Trott & Wayth (2016) to\nperform the EoR statistical experiments, and these are primarily limited by an\nadequate sky calibration model, and the thermal noise level in the calibration\ndata. At frequencies of the Cosmic Dawn (CD), which is of principal interest to\nSKA as one of the first next-generation telescopes capable of accessing higher\nredshifts, the MWA dipole and SKALA3 antenna have adequate performance, while\nthe SKALA2 design will impede the ability to explore this era.\n", "  There is a resurgence of interest in black holes sparked by the LIGO-VIRGO\ndetection of stellar black hole mergers and recent astronomical investigations\nof jets and accretion disks which probe the spacetime geometry of black holes\nwith masses ranging from a few times the mass of the sun to tens of billions of\nsolar masses. Many of these black holes appear to be spinning rapidly. Some new\napproaches are described to studying how accreting black holes function as\ncosmic machines paying special attention to observations of AGN jets,\nespecially with VLBI and $\\gamma$-ray telescopes. It is assumed that these jets\nare powered by the electromagnetic extraction of the spin energy of their\nassociated black holes, which are described by the Kerr metric, and that they\nbecome simpler and more electromagnetically dominated as the event horizon is\napproached. The major uncertainty in these models is in describing acceleration\nand transport of relativistic electrons and positrons and simple\nphenomenological prescriptions are proposed. The application of these ideas to\nM87 and 3C279 is outlined and the prospects for learning more, especially from\nthe Event Horizon Telescope and the Cerenkov Telescope Array, are discussed.\nThe main benefit of a better understanding of black hole astrophysics to the\nLISA mission should be a firmer understanding of the source demographics.\n", "  A common explanation for the CMB power asymmetry is to introduce a dipolar\nmodulation at the stage of inflation, where the primordial power spectrum is\nspatially varying. If the universe in the stage of inflation is Finslerian, and\nif the Finsler spacetime is non-reversible under parity flip, $x\\rightarrow-x$,\nthen a three dimensional spectrum which is the function of wave vector and\ndirection is valid. In this paper, a three dimensional primordial power\nspectrum with preferred direction is derived in the framework of Finsler\nspacetime. It is found that the amplitude of dipolar modulation is related to\nthe Finslerian parameter, which in turn is a function of wave vector. The\nangular correlation coefficients are presented, and the numerical results for\nthe anisotropic correlation coefficients over the multipole range $2<l<600$ are\ngiven.\n", "  EX Dra is a long-period eclipsing dwarf nova with $\\sim2-3$ mag amplitude\noutbursts. This star has been monitored photometrically from November, 2009 to\nMarch, 2016 and 29 new mid-eclipse times were obtained. By using new data\ntogether with the published data, the best fit to the $O-C$ curve indicate that\nthe orbital period of EX Dra have an upward parabolic change while undergoing\ndouble-cyclic variations with the periods of 21.4 and 3.99 years, respectively.\nThe upward parabolic change reveals a long-term increase at a rate of\n$\\dot{P}={+7.46}\\times10^{-11}{s} {s^{-1}}$. The evolutionary theory of\ncataclysmic variables (CVs) predicts that, as a CV evolves, the orbital period\nshould be decreasing rather than increasing. Secular increase can be explained\nas the mass transfer between the secondary and primary or may be just an\nobserved part of a longer cyclic change. Most plausible explanation for the\ndouble-cyclic variations is a pair of light travel-time effect via the presence\nof two companions. Their masses are determined to be\n$M_{A}sini'_{A}=29.3(\\pm0.6) M_{Jup}$ and $M_{B}sini'_{B}=50.8(\\pm0.2)\nM_{Jup}$. When the two companions are coplanar to the orbital plane of the\ncentral eclipsing pair, their masses would match to brown dwarfs.\n", "  Star formation in galaxies relies on the availability of cold, dense gas,\nwhich, in turn, relies on factors internal and external to the galaxies. In\norder to provide a simple model for how star formation is regulated by various\nphysical processes in galaxies, we analyse data at redshift $z=0$ from a\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulation that includes prescriptions for star\nformation and stellar evolution, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and their\nassociated feedback processes. This model can determine the star formation rate\n(SFR) as a function of galaxy stellar mass, gas mass, black hole mass, and\nenvironment. We find that gas mass is the most important quantity controlling\nstar formation in low-mass galaxies, and star-forming galaxies in dense\nenvironments have higher SFR than their counterparts in the field. In high-mass\ngalaxies, we find that black holes more massive than $\\sim10^{7.5}$ M$_\\odot$\ncan be triggered to quench star formation in their host; this mass scale is\nemergent in our simulations. Furthermore, this black hole mass corresponds to a\ngalaxy bulge mass $\\sim2\\times10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, consistent with the mass at\nwhich galaxies start to become dominated by early types ($\\sim3\\times10^{10}$\nM$_\\odot$, as previously shown in observations by Kauffmann et al.). Finally,\nwe demonstrate that our model can reproduce well the SFR measured from\nobservations of galaxies in the GAMA and ALFALFA surveys.\n", "  SAX J0635.2+0533 is a binary pulsar with a very short pulsation period ($P$ =\n33.8 ms) and a high long-term spin down ($\\dot P$ $>$ 3.8$\\times10^{-13}$ s\ns$^{-1}$), which suggests a rotation-powered (instead of an accretion-powered)\nnature for this source. While it was discovered at a flux level around\n10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, between 2003 and 2004 this source was\ndetected with XMM-Newton at an average flux of about 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$; moreover, the flux varied of over one order of magnitude on time\nscales of a few days, sometimes decreasing below $3\\times10^{-14}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Since both the rotation-powered and the accretion-powered\nscenarios have difficulties to explain these properties, the nature of SAX\nJ0635.2+0533 is still unclear. Here we report on our recent long-term\nmonitoring campaign on SAX J0635.2+0533 carried out with Swift and on a\nsystematic reanalysis of all the RXTE observations performed between 1999 and\n2001. We found that during this time interval the source remained almost always\nactive at a flux level above 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.\n", "  We present the results from INTEGRAL and Swift/XRT observations of the\nhitherto poorly studied unidentified X-ray transient AX J1949.8+2534, and on\narchival multiwavelength observations of field objects. Bright hard X-ray\noutbursts have been discovered above 20 keV for the first time, the measured\nduty cycle and dynamic range are of the order of 4% and >630, respectively. The\nsource was also detected during a low soft X-ray state (2x10E-12 erg cmE-2\nsE-1) thanks to a Swift/XRT followup, which allowed for the first time to\nperform a soft X-ray spectral analysis as well as significantly improve the\nsource positional uncertainty from arcminute to arcsecond size. From archival\nnear-infrared data, we pinpointed two bright objects as most likely\ncounterparts whose photometric properties are compatible with an early type\nspectral nature. This strongly supports a High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB)\nscenario for AX J1949.8+2534, specifically a Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient\n(more likely) or alternatively a Be HMXB.\n", "  With the aim of understanding the effect of the environment on the star\nformation history and morphological transformation of galaxies, we present a\ndetailed analysis of the colour, morphology and internal structure of cluster\nand field galaxies at $0.4 \\le z \\le 0.8$. We use {\\em HST} data for over 500\ngalaxies from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) to quantify how the\ngalaxies' light distribution deviate from symmetric smooth profiles. We\nvisually inspect the galaxies' images to identify the likely causes for such\ndeviations. We find that the residual flux fraction ($RFF$), which measures the\nfractional contribution to the galaxy light of the residuals left after\nsubtracting a symmetric and smooth model, is very sensitive to the degree of\nstructural disturbance but not the causes of such disturbance. On the other\nhand, the asymmetry of these residuals ($A_{\\rm res}$) is more sensitive to the\ncauses of the disturbance, with merging galaxies having the highest values of\n$A_{\\rm res}$. Using these quantitative parameters we find that, at a fixed\nmorphology, cluster and field galaxies show statistically similar degrees of\ndisturbance. However, there is a higher fraction of symmetric and passive\nspirals in the cluster than in the field. These galaxies have smoother light\ndistributions than their star-forming counterparts. We also find that while\nalmost all field and cluster S0s appear undisturbed, there is a relatively\nsmall population of star-forming S0s in clusters but not in the field. These\nfindings are consistent with relatively gentle environmental processes acting\non galaxies infalling onto clusters.\n", "  We present the application of deep machine learning technique to classify\nradio images of extended sources on a morphological basis using convolutional\nneural networks. In this study, we have taken the case of Fanaroff-Riley (FR)\nclass of radio galaxies as well as radio galaxies with bent-tailed morphology.\nWe have used archival data from the Very Large Array (VLA) - Faint Images of\nthe Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey and existing visually\nclassified samples available in literature to train a neural network for\nmorphological classification of these categories of radio sources. Our training\nsample size for each of these categories is approximately 200 sources, which\nhas been augmented by rotated versions of the same. Our study shows that\nconvolutional neural networks can classify images of the FRI and FRII and\nbent-tailed radio galaxies with high accuracy (maximum precision at 95%) using\nwell-defined samples and fusion classifier, which combines the results of\nbinary classifications, while allowing for a mechanism to find sources with\nunusual morphologies. The individual precision is highest for bent-tailed radio\ngalaxies at 95% and is 91% and 75% for the FRI and FRII classes, respectively,\nwhereas the recall is highest for FRI and FRIIs at 91% each, while bent-tailed\nclass has a recall of 79%. These results show that our results are comparable\nto that of manual classification while being much faster. Finally, we discuss\nthe computational and data-related challenges associated with morphological\nclassification of radio galaxies with convolutional neural networks.\n", "  We present a model to predict the luminosity function for radio galaxies and\ntheir linear size distribution at any redshift. The model takes a black hole\nmass function and Eddington ratio distribution as input and tracks the\nevolution of radio sources, taking into account synchrotron, adiabatic and\ninverse Compton energy losses. We first test the model at z = 2 where plenty of\nradio data is available and show that the radio luminosity function (RLF) is\nconsistent with observations. We are able to reproduce the break in luminosity\nfunction that separates locally the FRI and FRII radio sources. Our prediction\nfor linear size distribution at z = 2 matches the observed distribution too. We\nthen use our model to predict a RLF and linear size distribution at z = 6, as\nthis is the epoch when radio galaxies can be used as probes of reionisation. We\ndemonstrate that higher inverse Compton losses lead to shorter source lifetimes\nand smaller sizes at high redshifts. The predicted sizes are consistent with\nthe generally observed trend with redshift. We evolve the z = 2 RLF based on\nobserved quasar space densities at high redshifts, and show that our RLF\nprediction at z = 6 is consistent. Finally, we predict the detection of 0.63,\n0.092 and 0.0025 z>=6 sources per sq. degree at flux density limits of 0.1, 0.5\nand 3.5 mJy. We assess the trade-off between coverage area and depth and show\nthat LOFAR surveys with flux density limits of 0.1 and 0.5 mJy would are the\nmost efficient at detecting a large number of z>=6 radio sources.\n", "  We studied the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC4656 and its dwarf low surface\nbrightness companion with the enhanced UV brightness, NGC4656UV, belonging to\nthe interacting system NGC4631/56. Regular photometric structure and relatively\nbig size of NGC4656UV allows to consider this dwarf galaxy as a separate group\nmember rather than a tidal dwarf. Spectral long-slit observations were used to\nobtain the kinematical parameters and gas-phase metallicity of NGC4656UV and\nNGC4656. Our rough estimate of the total dynamical mass of NGC4656UV allowed us\nto conclude that this galaxy is the dark-matter dominated LSB dwarf or ultra\ndiffuse galaxy. Young stellar population of NGC4656UV, as well as strong local\nnon-circular gas motions in NGC4656 and the low oxygen gas abundance in the\nregion of this galaxy adjacent to its dwarf companion, give evidence in favour\nof the accretion of metal-poor gas onto the discs of both galaxies.\n", "  While in classical turbulence helicity depletes nonlinearity and can alter\nthe evolution of turbulent flows, in quantum turbulence its role is not fully\nunderstood. We present numerical simulations of the free decay of a helical\nquantum turbulent flow using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation at high spatial\nresolution. The evolution has remarkable similarities with classical flows,\nwhich go as far as displaying a dual transfer of incompressible kinetic energy\nand helicity to small scales. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that both\nquantities are dissipated at small scales through non-linear excitation of\nKelvin waves and the subsequent emission of phonons. At the onset of the decay,\nthe resulting turbulent flow displays polarized large scale structures and\nunpolarized patches of quiescense reminiscent of those observed in simulations\nof classical turbulence at very large Reynolds numbers.\n", "  We use data from the IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project to study the surface\nphotometry of 22 nearby, face-on to moderately inclined spiral galaxies. The\nreprocessed and combined Stripe 82 $g'$, $r'$ and $i'$ images allow us to probe\nthe galaxy down to 29-30 $r'$-magnitudes/arcsec$^2$ and thus reach into the\nvery faint outskirts of the galaxies. Truncations are found in three galaxies.\nAn additional 15 galaxies are found to have an apparent extended stellar halo.\nSimulations show that the scattering of light from the inner galaxy by the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) can produce faint structures resembling haloes, but\nthis effect is insufficient to fully explain the observed haloes. The presence\nof these haloes and of truncations is mutually exclusive, and we argue that the\npresence of a stellar halo and/or light scattered by the PSF can hide\ntruncations. Furthermore, we find that the onset of the stellar halo and the\ntruncations scales tightly with galaxy size. Interestingly, the fraction of\nlight does not correlate with dynamic mass. Nineteen galaxies are found to have\nbreaks in their profiles, the radius of which also correlates with galaxy size.\n", "  Atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for ten stars with\nmetallicities in the region of -2.2< [Fe/H] <-0.6 were precisely determined\nusing high resolution, high signal to noise, spectra. For each star the\nabundances, for 14 to 27 elements, were derived using both LTE and NLTE\napproaches. In particular, differences by assuming LTE or NLTE are about 0.10\ndex; depending on [Fe/H], Teff, gravity and element lines used in the analysis.\nWe find that the O abundance has the largest error, ranging from 0.10 and 0.2\ndex. The best measured elements are Cr, Fe, and Mn; with errors etween 0.03 and\n0.11 dex. The stars in our sample were included in previous different\nobservational work. We provide a consistent data analysis. The data dispersion\nintroduced in the literature by different techniques and assumptions used by\nthe different authors is within the observational errors, excepting for\nHD103095. We compare these results with stellar observations from different\ndata sets and a number of theoretical galactic chemical evolution (GCE)\nsimulations. We find a large scatter in the GCE results, used to study the\norigin of the elements. Within this scatter as found in previous GCE\nsimulations, we cannot reproduce the evolution of the elemental ratios [Sc/Fe],\n[Ti/Fe], and [V/Fe] at different metallicities. The stellar yields from core\ncollapse supernovae (CCSN) are likely primarily responsible for this\ndiscrepancy. Possible solutions and open problems are discussed.\n", "  The non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) could arise from catastrophic\nstellar explosions or magnetar giant flares, so relativistic blast waves might\nbe produced in these events. Motivated by this, we here search for GeV\ncounterparts to all non-repeating FRBs with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT),\nincluding FRB 131104 that is claimed to be possibly associated with a gamma-ray\ntransient candidate detected by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). FRB 131104\nenters the field of view (FoV) of LAT ~5000s after the burst time, so we are\nonly able to search for the GeV afterglow emission during this period, but no\nsignificant GeV emission is detected. We also perform a search for GeV\nemissions from other FRBs, but no significant GeV emissions are detected\neither. Upper limit fluences in the range of (4.7-29.2)x10^(-7) erg/cm2 are\nobtained, and then the upper limits of the isotropic blast wave kinetic energy\nof about (1-200)x10^(53) erg are inferred under certain assumptions. Although\nthe current limits on the isotropic blast wave energy are not sufficiently\nstringent to rule out the connection between FRBs and GRB-like transients,\nfuture more sensitive observations with Fermi or Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTelescopes might be able to constrain the connection.\n", "  The realization of quantum networks and quantum repeaters remains an\noutstanding challenge in quantum communication. These rely on entanglement of\nremote matter systems, which in turn requires creation of quantum correlations\nbetween a single photon and a matter system. A practical way to establish such\ncorrelations is via spontaneous Raman scattering in atomic ensembles, known as\nthe DLCZ scheme. However, time multiplexing is inherently difficult using this\nmethod, which leads to low communication rates even in theory. Moreover, it is\ndesirable to find solid-state ensembles where such matter-photon correlations\ncould be generated. Here we demonstrate quantum correlations between a single\nphoton and a spin excitation in up to 12 temporal modes, in a $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$\ndoped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal, using a novel DLCZ approach that is inherently\nmultimode. After a storage time of 1 ms, the spin excitation is converted into\na second photon. The quantum correlation of the generated photon pair is\nverified by violating a Cauchy - Schwarz inequality. Our results show that\nsolid-state rare-earth crystals could be used to generate remote multi-mode\nentanglement, an important resource for future quantum networks.\n", "  We investigate extremely luminous dusty galaxies in the environments around\nWISE-selected hot dust obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) and WISE/radio-selected\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) at average redshifts of z = 2.7 and z = 1.7,\nrespectively. Previous observations have detected overdensities of companion\nsubmillimetre-selected sources around 10 Hot DOGs and 30 WISE/radio AGNs, with\noverdensities of ~ 2 - 3 and ~ 5 - 6 , respectively. We find that the space\ndensities in both samples to be overdense compared to normal star-forming\ngalaxies and submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) in the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy\nSurvey (S2CLS). Both samples of companion sources have consistent mid-IR\ncolours and mid-IR to submm ratios as SMGs. The brighter population around\nWISE/radio AGNs could be responsible for the higher overdensity reported. We\nalso find the star formation rate density (SFRDs) are higher than the field,\nbut consistent with clusters of dusty galaxies. WISE-selected AGNs appear to be\ngood signposts for protoclusters at high redshift on arcmin scales. The results\nreported here provide an upper limit to the strength of angular clustering\nusing the two-point correlation function. Monte Carlo simulations show no\nangular correlation, which could indicate protoclusters on scales larger than\nthe SCUBA-2 1.5arcmin scale maps.\n", "  The CALICE collaboration is developing highly granular calorimeters for\nexperiments at a future lepton collider primarily to establish technologies for\nparticle flow event reconstruction. These technologies also find applications\nelsewhere, such as detector upgrades for the LHC. Meanwhile, the large data\nsets collected in an extensive series of beam tests have enabled detailed\nstudies of the properties of hadronic showers in calorimeter systems, resulting\nin improved simulation models and development of sophisticated reconstruction\ntechniques. In this proceeding, highlights are included from studies of the\nstructure of hadronic showers and results on reconstruction techniques for\nimaging calorimetry. In addition, current R&D activities within CALICE are\nsummarized, focusing on technological prototypes that address challenges from\nfull detector system integration and production techniques amenable to mass\nproduction for electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters based on silicon,\nscintillator, and gas techniques.\n", "  The ESA Rosetta spacecraft has been tracking its target, the Jupiter-family\ncomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in close vicinity for over two years. It hosts\nthe OSIRIS instruments: the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging\nSystem composed of two cameras, see e.g. Keller et al. (2007). In some imaging\nsequences dedicated to observe dust particles in the comet's coma, the two\ncameras took images at the same time. The aim of this work is to use these\nsimultaneous double camera observations to calculate the dust particles'\ndistance to the spacecraft. As the two cameras are mounted on the spacecraft\nwith an offset of 70 cm, the distance of particles observed by both cameras can\nbe determined by a shift of the particles' apparent trails on the images. This\npaper presents first results of the ongoing work, introducing the distance\ndetermination method for the OSIRIS instrument and the analysis of an example\nparticle. We note that this method works for particles in the range of about\n500 m - 6000 m from the spacecraft.\n", "  We present the solar S-index record of cycle 24, obtained by the TIGRE\nrobotic telescope facility and its high-resolution spectrograph HEROS\n(R$\\approx$20,000), which measures the solar chromospheric Ca II H&K line\nemission by using moonlight. Our calibration process uses the same set of\nstandard stars as introduced by the Mt. Wilson team, thus giving us a direct\ncomparison with their huge body of observations taken between 1966 and 1992, as\nwell as with other cool stars. Carrington cycle 24 activity started from the\nunusually deep and long minimum 2008/09, with an S-index average of only 0.154,\nby 0.015 deeper than the one of 1986 (<S>=0.169). In this respect,the\nchromospheric radiative losses differ remarkably from the variation of the\ncoronal radio flux F10.7cm and the sunspot numbers. In addition, the cycle 24\nS-amplitude remained small, 0.022 (cycles 21 and 22 averaged: 0.024), and so\nresulted a very low 2014 maximum of <S>=0.176 (cycles 21 and 22 averaged:\n0.193). We argue that this find is significant, since the Ca II H&K line\nemission is a good proxy for the solar far-UV flux, which plays an important\nrole in the heating of the Earth's stratosphere, and we further argue that the\nsolar far-UV flux changes change s with solar activity much more strongly than\nthe total solar output.\n", "  In a previous paper, we derived the quantum states of a Dirac particle in a\ncircular, intense magnetic field in the limit of low momentum perpendicular to\nthe field with the purpose of giving a quantum description of the trajectory of\nan electron, or a positron, in a typical pulsar or magnetar magnetosphere. Here\nwe continue this work by computing the radiation resulting from transitions\nbetween these states. This leads to derive from first principles a quantum\ntheory of the so-called curvature and synchro-curvature radiations relevant for\nrotating neutron-star magnetospheres. We find that, within the approximation of\nan infinitely confined wave-function around the magnetic field and in the\ncontinuous energy-level limit, classical curvature radiation can be recovered\nin a fully consistent way. Further we introduce discrete transitions to account\nfor the change of momentum perpendicular to the field and derive expressions\nfor what we call quantum synchro-curvature radiation. Additionally, we express\ndeconfinement and quantum recoil corrections.\n", "  We present spectro-photometry spanning 1-5 $\\mu$m of 51 Eridani b, a 2-10\nM$_\\text{Jup}$ planet discovered by the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey.\nIn this study, we present new $K1$ (1.90-2.19 $\\mu$m) and $K2$ (2.10-2.40\n$\\mu$m) spectra taken with the Gemini Planet Imager as well as an updated $L_P$\n(3.76 $\\mu$m) and new $M_S$ (4.67 $\\mu$m) photometry from the NIRC2 Narrow\ncamera. The new data were combined with $J$ (1.13-1.35 $\\mu$m) and $H$\n(1.50-1.80 $\\mu$m) spectra from the discovery epoch with the goal of better\ncharacterizing the planet properties. 51 Eri b photometry is redder than field\nbrown dwarfs as well as known young T-dwarfs with similar spectral type\n(between T4-T8) and we propose that 51 Eri b might be in the process of\nundergoing the transition from L-type to T-type. We used two complementary\natmosphere model grids including either deep iron/silicate clouds or\nsulfide/salt clouds in the photosphere, spanning a range of cloud properties,\nincluding fully cloudy, cloud free and patchy/intermediate opacity clouds.\nModel fits suggest that 51 Eri b has an effective temperature ranging between\n605-737 K, a solar metallicity, a surface gravity of $\\log$(g) = 3.5-4.0 dex,\nand the atmosphere requires a patchy cloud atmosphere to model the SED. From\nthe model atmospheres, we infer a luminosity for the planet of -5.83 to -5.93\n($\\log L/L_{\\odot}$), leaving 51 Eri b in the unique position as being one of\nthe only directly imaged planet consistent with having formed via cold-start\nscenario. Comparisons of the planet SED against warm-start models indicates\nthat the planet luminosity is best reproduced by a planet formed via core\naccretion with a core mass between 15 and 127 M$_{\\oplus}$.\n", "  Magnetic field dragged from the galactic disk along with inflowing gas can\nprovide vertical support to the geometrically and optically thick pc-scale\ntorus in AGN. Using the Soloviev solution initially developed for Tokamaks we\nderive an analytical model for a rotating torus supported and confined by\nmagnetic field. We further perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamics\nsimulations of X-ray irradiated pc-scale magnetized tori. We follow the time\nevolution and compare models which adopt initial conditions derived from our\nanalytic model with simulations in which the initial magnetic flux is entirely\ncontained within the gas torus. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the\ninitial conditions based on the analytic solution produce a longer-lived torus\nand one which produces obscuration which is generally consistent with observed\nconstraints.\n", "  The inference of internal properties of the Sun from surface measurements of\nwave travel times is the goal of time-distance helioseismology. A critical step\ntoward the accurate interpretation of travel-time shifts is the computation of\nsensitivity functions linking seismic measurements to internal structure. Here\nwe calculate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels in spherical geometry for\ntwo-point travel-time measurements. We numerically build Green's function by\nsolving for it at each frequency and spherical-harmonic degree and summing over\nall these pieces. These computations are performed in parallel\n(\"embarrassingly\"), thereby achieving significant speedup in wall-clock time.\nKernels are calculated by invoking the first-order Born approximation\nconnecting deviations in the wavefield to perturbations in the operator.\nValidated flow kernels are shown to produce travel times within 0.47% of the\ntrue value for uniform flows up to 750 m/s. We find that travel-time can be\nobtained with errors of 1 millisecond or less for flows having magnitudes\nsimilar to meridional circulation. Alongside flows, we also compute and\nvalidate sensitivity kernel for sound-speed perturbations. These accurate\nsensitivity kernels might improve the current inferences of sub-surface flows\nsignificantly.\n", "  We derive the low redshift galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), inclusive of\ndust corrections, for the equatorial Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) dataset\ncovering 180 deg$^2$. We construct the mass function using a density-corrected\nmaximum volume method, using masses corrected for the impact of optically thick\nand thin dust. We explore the galactic bivariate brightness plane\n($M_\\star-\\mu$), demonstrating that surface brightness effects do not\nsystematically bias our mass function measurement above 10$^{7.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThe galaxy distribution in the $M-\\mu$-plane appears well bounded, indicating\nthat no substantial population of massive but diffuse or highly compact\ngalaxies are systematically missed due to the GAMA selection criteria. The GSMF\nis {fit with} a double Schechter function, with $\\mathcal\nM^\\star=10^{10.78\\pm0.01\\pm0.20}M_\\odot$,\n$\\phi^\\star_1=(2.93\\pm0.40)\\times10^{-3}h_{70}^3$Mpc$^{-3}$,\n$\\alpha_1=-0.62\\pm0.03\\pm0.15$,\n$\\phi^\\star_2=(0.63\\pm0.10)\\times10^{-3}h_{70}^3$Mpc$^{-3}$, and\n$\\alpha_2=-1.50\\pm0.01\\pm0.15$. We find the equivalent faint end slope as\npreviously estimated using the GAMA-I sample, although we find a higher value\nof $\\mathcal M^\\star$. Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the\nmass function to masses as low as $10^{7.5}$ $M_\\odot$, and assess limits to\n$10^{6.5}$ $M_\\odot$. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS we are able\nto comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as\n$10^{6}$ $M_\\odot$. Beyond the well known upturn seen in the GSMF at $10^{9.5}$\nthe distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from $10^9$ to\n$10^{6.5}$. We calculate the stellar mass density parameter given our\nbest-estimate GSMF, finding $\\Omega_\\star= 1.66^{+0.24}_{-0.23}\\pm0.97\nh^{-1}_{70} \\times 10^{-3}$, inclusive of random and systematic uncertainties.\n", "  XMM-Newton is the direct precursor of the future ESA ATHENA mission. A study\nof its particle-induced background provides therefore significant insight for\nthe ATHENA mission design. We make use of about 12 years of data, products from\nthe third XMM-Newton catalog as well as FP7 EXTraS project to avoid celestial\nsources contamination and to disentangle the different components of the\nXMM-Newton particle-induced background. Within the ESA R&D AREMBES\ncollaboration, we built new analysis pipelines to study the different\ncomponents of this background: this covers time behavior as well as spectral\nand spatial characteristics.\n", "  We present the results from an extensive spectroscopic survey of the central\nregion of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 at $z=0.03$. By combining 775\nnew redshifts from the MMT/Hectospec observations with the data in the\nliterature, we construct a large sample of 1624 galaxies with measured\nredshifts at $R<30^\\prime$, which results in high spectroscopic completeness at\n$r_{\\rm petro,0}<20.5$ (77%). We use these data to study the kinematics and\nclustering of galaxies focusing on the comparison with those of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) from Suzaku X-ray observations. We identify 406\nmember galaxies of A2199 at $R<30^\\prime$ using the caustic technique. The\nvelocity dispersion profile of cluster members appears smoothly connected to\nthe stellar velocity dispersion profile of the cD galaxy. The luminosity\nfunction is well fitted with a Schechter function at $M_r<-15$. The radial\nvelocities of cluster galaxies generally agree well with those of the ICM, but\nthere are some regions where the velocity difference between the two is about a\nfew hundred kilometer per second. The cluster galaxies show a hint of global\nrotation at $R<5^\\prime$ with $v_{\\rm rot}=300{-}600\\,\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$, but\nthe ICM in the same region do not show such rotation. We apply a\nfriends-of-friends algorithm to the cluster galaxy sample at $R<60^\\prime$ and\nidentify 32 group candidates, and examine the spatial correlation between the\ngalaxy groups and X-ray emission. This extensive survey in the central region\nof A2199 provides an important basis for future studies of interplay among the\ngalaxies, the ICM and the dark matter in the cluster.\n", "  We have performed a set of simulations of expanding, spherically symmetric\nnebulae inflated by winds from accreting black holes in ultraluminous X-ray\nsources (ULXs). We implemented a realistic cooling function to account for\nfree-free and bound-free cooling. For all model parameters we considered, the\nforward shock in the interstellar medium becomes radiative at a radius $\\sim $\n100 pc. The emission is primarily in the optical and UV, and the radiative\nluminosity is about 50% of the total kinetic luminosity of the wind. In\ncontrast, the reverse shock in the wind is adiabatic so long as the terminal\noutflow velocity of the wind $v_{\\rm w} \\sim 0.003c$. The shocked wind in these\nmodels radiates in X-rays, but with a luminosity of only $\\sim 10^{35}\n\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$. For wind velocities $v_{\\rm w} \\sim 0.001c$, the shocked\nwind becomes radiative, but it is no longer hot enough to produce X-rays.\nInstead it emits in optical and UV, and the radiative luminosity is comparable\nto 100% of the wind kinetic luminosity. We suggest that measuring the optical\nluminosities and putting limits on the X-ray and radio emission from\nshock-ionized ULX bubbles may help in estimating the mass outflow rate of the\ncentral accretion disk and the velocity of the outflow.\n", "  Two Jovian-sized planets are orbiting the star HD155358 near exact mean\nmotion resonance (MMR) commensurability. In this work we re-analyze the radial\nvelocity (RV) data previously collected by Robertson et al. (2012). Using a\nBayesian framework we construct two models - one that includes and one that\nexcludes gravitational planet-planet interactions (PPI). We find that the\norbital parameters from our PPI and noPPI models differ by up to $2\\sigma$,\nwith our noPPI model being statistically consistent with previous results. In\naddition, our new PPI model strongly favours the planets being in MMR while our\nnoPPI model strongly disfavours MMR. We conduct a stability analysis by drawing\nsamples from our PPI model's posterior distribution and simulating them for\n$10^9$ years, finding that our best-fit values land firmly in a stable region\nof parameter space.\n  We explore a series of formation models that migrate the planets into their\nobserved MMR. We then use these models to directly fit to the observed RV data,\nwhere each model is uniquely parameterized by only three constants describing\nits migration history. Using a Bayesian framework we find that a number of\nmigration models fit the RV data surprisingly well, with some migration\nparameters being ruled out.\n  Our analysis shows that planet-planet interactions are important to take into\naccount when modelling observations of multi-planetary systems. The additional\ninformation that one can gain from interacting models can help constrain planet\nmigration parameters.\n", "  The age of a young asteroid family can be determined by tracking the orbits\nof family members backward in time and showing that they converge at some time\nin the past. Here we consider the Veritas family. We find that the membership\nof the Veritas family increased enormously since the last detailed analysis of\nthe family. Using backward integration, we confirm the convergence of nodal\nlongitudes $\\Omega$, and, for the first time, also obtain a simultaneous\nconvergence of pericenter longitudes $\\varpi$. The Veritas family is found to\nbe $8.23^{+0.37}_{-0.31}$~Myr old. To obtain a tight convergence of $\\Omega$\nand $\\varpi$, as expected from low ejection speeds of fragments, the Yarkovsky\neffect needs to be included in the modeling of the past orbital histories of\nVeritas family members. Using this method, we compute the Yarkovsky semi-major\naxis drift rates, ${\\rm d}a/{\\rm d}t$, for 274 member asteroids. The\ndistribution of ${\\rm d}a/{\\rm d}t$ values is consistent with a population of\nC-type objects with low densities and low thermal conductivities. The accuracy\nof individual ${\\rm d}a/{\\rm d}t$ measurements is limited by the effect of\nclose encounters of member asteroids to (1) Ceres and other massive asteroids,\nwhich cannot be evaluated with confidence.\n", "  We discuss the hypothesis that the constituents of dark matter in the\ngalactic halo are Primordial Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (PIMBHs). The status\nof axions and WIMPs is discussed, as are the methods for detecting PIMBHs with\nemphasis on microlensing. The role of the angular momentum J of the PIMBHs in\ntheir escaping previous detection is considered.\n", "  Recently, the BESIII Collaboration reported two new decay processes\n$h_c(1P)\\to \\gamma \\eta$ and $\\gamma \\eta^\\prime$. Inspired by this\nmeasurement, we propose to study the radiative decays of $h_c$ via intermediate\ncharmed meson loops in an effective Lagrangian approach. With the acceptable\ncutoff parameter range, the calculated branching ratios of $h_c(1P)\\to \\gamma\n\\eta$ and $\\gamma \\eta^\\prime$ are orders of $10^{-4}\\sim 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-3}\n\\sim 10^{-2}$, respectively. The ratio $R_{h_c}= \\mathcal{B}( h_c\\to \\gamma\n\\eta )/\\mathcal{B}( h_c\\to \\gamma \\eta^\\prime )$ can reproduce the experimental\nmeasurements with the commonly acceptable $\\alpha$ range. This ratio provide us\nsome information on the $\\eta-\\eta^\\prime$ mixing, which may be helpful for us\nto test SU(3)-flavor symmetries in QCD.\n", "  The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the\nprogenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), but some of the predictions in the\nmost widely studied version of the SD model, i.e. the optically thick wind\n(OTW) model, have not been confirmed by observations. Here, we propose a new\nversion of the SD model in which a common envelope (CE) is assumed to form when\nthe mass-transfer rate between a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) and its\ncompanion exceeds a critical accretion rate. The WD may gradually increase its\nmass at the base of the CE. Due to the large nuclear luminosity for stable\nhydrogen burning, the CE may expand to giant dimensions and will lose mass from\nthe surface of the CE by a CE wind (CEW). Because of the low CE density, the\nbinary system will avoid a fast spiral-in phase and finally re-emerge from the\nCE phase. Our model may share the virtues of the OTW model but avoid some of\nits shortcomings. We performed binary stellar evolution calculations for more\nthan 1100 close WD + MS binaries. Compared with the OTW model, the parameter\nspace for SNe Ia from our CEW model extends to more massive companions and less\nmassive WDs. Correspondingly, the Galactic birth rate from the CEW model is\nhigher than that from the OTW model by $\\sim$30\\%. Finally, we discuss the\nuncertainties of the CEW model and the differences between our CEW model and\nthe OTW model.\n", "  We study the environments of low- and high- excitation radio galaxies (LERGs\nand HERGs respectively) in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.4$, using a sample\nof 399 radio galaxies and environmental measurements from the Galaxy And Mass\nAssembly (GAMA) survey. In our analysis we use the fifth nearest neighbour\ndensity ($\\Sigma_{5}$) and the GAMA galaxy groups catalogue (G3Cv6) and\nconstruct control samples of galaxies matched in {\\update stellar mass and\ncolour} to the radio-detected sample.\n  We find that LERGs and HERGs exist in different environments and that this\ndifference is dependent on radio luminosity. High-luminosity LERGs ($L_{\\rm\nNVSS} \\gtrsim 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) lie in much denser environments than a\nmatched radio-quiet control sample (about three times as dense, as measured by\n$\\Sigma_{5}$), and are more likely to be members of galaxy groups\n($82^{+5}_{-7}$ percent of LERGs are in GAMA groups, compared to $58^{+3}_{-3}$\npercent of the control sample). In contrast, the environments of the HERGs and\nlower luminosity LERGs are indistinguishable from that of a matched control\nsample. Our results imply that high-luminosity LERGs lie in more massive haloes\nthan non-radio galaxies of similar stellar mass and colour, in agreement with\nearlier studies (Wake et al. 2008; Donoso et al. 2010). When we control for the\npreference of LERGs to be found in groups, both high- and low- luminosity LERGs\nare found in higher-mass haloes ($\\sim 0.2$ dex; at least 97 percent\nsignificant) than the non-radio control sample.\n", "  We have performed the first three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations of extragalactic jets of pure leptonic and baryonic plasma\ncompositions propagating into a hydrostatic intracluster medium environment.\nThe numerical simulations use a general equation of state for a multi-component\nrelativistic gas which closely reproduces the Synge equation of state for a\nrelativistic perfect gas. We find that morphological and dynamical differences\nbetween leptonic and baryonic jets are much less evident than those between hot\nand cold jets. In all these models, the jets first propagate with essentially\nconstant velocities within the core radius of the intracluster medium and then\naccelerate progressively so as to increase the jet advance velocity by a factor\nof between 1.2 and 1.6 at the end of simulations, depending upon the models.\nThe temporal evolution of the average cavity pressure is not consistent with\nthat expected by the extended theoretical model even if the average cavity\npressure decreases as a function of time with a power-law. Our simulations\nproduce synthetic radio images that are dominated by bright hot spots and\nappear similar to observations of the extended radio galaxies with collimated\nradio jets. These bright radio lobes would be visible as dark regions in X-ray\nimages and are morphologically similar to observed X-ray cavities in the\nintracluster medium. This supports the expectation that the bow shock\nsurrounding the head of the jet is important mechanism for producing X-ray\ncavities in the intracluster medium. Although there are quantitative\ndifferences among the models the total radio and X-ray intensity curves show\nqualitatively similar trends in all of them.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of porous icy dust aggregates in a turbulent gas\ndisk and investigate the stability of the disk. We evaluate the random velocity\nof porous dust aggregates by considering their self-gravity, collisions,\naerodynamic drag, turbulent stirring and scattering due to gas. We extend our\nprevious work by introducing the anisotropic velocity dispersion and the\nrelaxation time of the random velocity. We find the minimum mass solar nebular\nmodel to be gravitationally unstable if the turbulent viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$ is less than about $4 \\times 10^{-3}$. The upper limit of $\\alpha$ for\nthe onset of gravitational instability is derived as a function of the disk\nparameters. We discuss the implications of the gravitational instability for\nplanetesimal formation.\n", "  We report on a combined soft x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism\n(XMCD) study at the Co-$L_{3,2}$ on the hybrid 3$d$/5$d$ solid state oxide\nSr$_2$Co$_{0.5}$Ir$_{0.5}$O$_4$ with the K$_2$NiF$_4$ structure. Our data\nindicate unambiguously a pure high spin state $(S=2)$ for the Co$^{3+}$\n(3$d^6$) ions with a significant unquenched orbital moment $L_z/2S_z=0.25$\ndespite the sizeable elongation of the CoO$_6$ octahedra. Using quantitative\nmodel calculations based on parameters consistent with our spectra, we have\ninvestigated the stability of this high spin state with respect to the\ncompeting low spin and intermediate spin states.\n", "  In the present work, we propose an Action Principle for Action-dependent\nLagrangians by generalizing the Herglotz variational problem for several\nindependent variables. This Action Principle enables us to formulate Lagrangian\ndensities for non-conservative fields. In special, from a Lagrangian depending\nlinearly on the Action, we obtain a generalized Einstein's field equations for\na non-conservative gravity and analyze some consequences of their solutions to\ncosmology and gravitational waves. We show that the non-conservative part of\nthe field equations depends on a constant cosmological four-vector. Depending\non this four-vector, the theory displays damped/amplified gravitational waves\nand an accelerating Universe without dark energy.\n", "  We performed long-slit spectral observations of two SB-type galaxies: NGC\n5347, UGC 1344. They were previously suspected as the galaxies with unusually\nlow mass-to-light ratios (on the ground of mass estimates from the Hi\nlinewidths), which are in conflict with their observed colours. The\nobservations were conducted at the Russian 6-m telescope. The aim of the study\nwas to clarify the kinematics and structure, as well as the properties of\nstellar populations of the galaxies. The results of observations disproved the\npeculiarly low mass-to-light ratios of both galaxies. The most probable reasons\nof underestimation of their masses are discussed. We tried to reproduce the\nmain observed features of kinematical profiles of the galaxies in the N-body\nsimulations of barred galaxies. We found that both galaxies possess central\ncomponents of different structure. Indeed, the age and velocity dispersion of\nstellar population in NGC 5347 are low in its innermost part in comparison to\nthat of the bulge or a bar, which agrees with the presence of nuclear\nkinematically decoupled disc. It probably was formed due to the bar which\nsupplied the inner region with gas. The kinematical profiles of the second\ngalaxy UGC 1344 give evidences in favour of the central peanut-shaped bulge. In\nspite of the different luminosities of the two galaxies, they possess nearly\nequal (close to solar) central stellar abundance and the flattening of the\nstellar metallicity gradient in the bar regions. However, in the less luminous\nNGC 5347 the mean stellar age is younger than that in UGC 1344.\n", "  We introduce a simple family of barred galaxy models with flat rotation\ncurves. They are built by convolving the axisymmetric logarithmic model with a\nneedle density. The density contours in the bar region are highly triaxial and\nelongated, but become spheroidal in the outer parts. The mass distribution\ndiffers markedly from the elliptical shape assumed in other analytical models,\nlike Ferrers or Freeman bars. The surface density profile along the bar major\naxis is flattish, as befits models for bars in early-type galaxies (SB0, SBa).\nThe two-dimensional orbital structure of the models is analysed with surfaces\nof section and characteristic diagrams and it reveals qualitatively new\nfeatures. For some pattern speeds, additional Lagrange points can exist along\nthe major axis, and give rise to off-centered, trapped orbits. When the bar is\nweak, the orbital structure is very simple, comprising just prograde, aligned\n$x_1$ orbits and retrograde anti-aligned $x_4$ orbits. As the bar strength\nincreases, the $x_1$ family becomes unstable and vanishes, with propeller\norbits dominating the characteristic diagram.\n", "  The use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise stellar spectra is essential\nin order to determine the most accurate and precise stellar atmospheric\nparameters via spectroscopy. This is particularly important for determining the\nfundamental parameters of exoplanets, which directly depend on the stellar\nproperties. However, different techniques can be implemented when analysing\nthese spectra which will influence the results. These include performing an\nabundance analysis relative to the solar values in order to negate\nuncertainties in atomic data, and fixing the surface gravity (log g) to an\nexternal value such as those from asteroseismology. The choice of lines used\nwill also influence the results. In this paper, we investigate differential\nanalysis and fixing log g for a set of FGK stars that already have accurate\nfundamental parameters known from external methods. We find that a differential\nline list gives slightly more accurate parameters compared to a laboratory line\nlist, however the laboratory line list still gives robust parameters. We also\nfind that fixing the log g does not improve the spectroscopic parameters. We\ninvestigate the effects of line selection on the stellar parameters and find\nthat the choice of lines used can have a significant effect on the parameters.\nIn particular, removal of certain low excitation potential lines can change the\nTeff by up to 50 K. For future HoSTS papers we will use the differential line\nlist with a solar microturbulence value of 1 km/s, and we will not fix the log\ng to an external value.\n", "  We analyse N-body and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of\nyoung star-forming regions to search for differences in the spatial\ndistributions of massive stars compared to lower-mass stars. The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars.\n", "  Neutron single crystal diffraction and rotational anisotropy optical second\nharmonic generation data are presented resolving the nature of the structural\ndistortion realized in electron-doped (Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ with\n$x=0.035$ and $x=0.071$. Once electrons are introduced into the bilayer\nspin-orbit assisted Mott insulator Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, previous studies have\nidentified the appearance of a low temperature structural distortion and have\nsuggested the presence of a competing electronic instability in the phase\ndiagram of this material. Our measurements resolve a lowering of the structural\nsymmetry from monoclinic $C2/c$ to monoclinic $P2_1/c$ and the creation of two\nunique Ir sites within the chemical unit cell as the lattice distorts below a\ncritical temperature $T_S$. Details regarding the modifications to oxygen\noctahedral rotations and tilting through the transition are discussed as well\nas the evolution of the low temperature distorted lattice as a function of\ncarrier substitution.\n", "  We present the results of chemical modeling of complex organic molecules\n(COMs) under conditions typical for prestellar cores. We utilize an advanced\ngas-grain astrochemical model with updated gas-phase chemistry, with a\nmultilayer approach to ice-surface chemistry and an up-to-date treatment of\nreactive desorption based on recent experiments of Minissale et al. (2016).\nWith the chemical model, radial profiles of molecules including COMs are\ncalculated for the case of the prototypical prestellar core L1544 at the\ntimescales when the modeled depletion factor of CO becomes equal to that\nobserved. We find that COMs can be formed efficiently in L1544 up to the\nfractional abundances of 10(-10) wrt. total hydrogen nuclei. Abundances of many\nCOMs such as CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, and others peak at similar radial distances of\n~2000-4000 AU. Gas-phase abundances of COMs depend on the efficiency of\nreactive desorption, which in turn depends on the composition of the outer\nmonolayers of icy mantles. In prestellar cores, the outer monolayers of mantles\nlikely include large fractions of CO and its hydrogenation products, which may\nincrease the efficiency of reactive desorption according to Minissale et al.\n(2016), and makes the formation of COMs efficient under conditions typical for\nprestellar cores, although this assumption is yet to be confirmed\nexperimentally. The hydroxyl radical (OH) appears to play an important role in\ngas-phase chemistry of COMs, which makes it deserving further detailed studies.\n", "  The Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope has\ncommenced science observations of the Sun starting in late 2016. Since the Sun\nis much larger than the field of view of individual ALMA dishes, the ALMA\ninterferometer is unable to measure the background level of solar emission when\nobserving the solar disk. The absolute temperature scale is a critical\nmeasurement for much of ALMA solar science, including the understanding of\nenergy transfer through the solar atmosphere, the properties of prominences,\nand the study of shock heating in the chromosphere. In order to provide an\nabsolute temperature scale, ALMA solar observing will take advantage of the\nremarkable fast-scanning capabilities of the ALMA 12m dishes to make\nsingle-dish maps of the full Sun. This article reports on the results of an\nextensive commissioning effort to optimize the mapping procedure, and it\ndescribes the nature of the resulting data. Amplitude calibration is discussed\nin detail: a path that utilizes the two loads in the ALMA calibration system as\nwell as sky measurements is described and applied to commissioning data.\nInspection of a large number of single-dish datasets shows significant\nvariation in the resulting temperatures, and based on the temperature\ndistributions we derive quiet-Sun values at disk center of 7300 K at lambda=3\nmm and 5900 K at lambda=1.3 mm. These values have statistical uncertainties of\norder 100 K, but systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale that may be\nsignificantly larger. Example images are presented from two periods with very\ndifferent levels of solar activity. At a resolution of order 25 arcsec, the 1.3\nmm wavelength images show temperatures on the disk that vary over about a 2000\nK range.\n", "  In outburst, neutron star X-ray binaries produce less powerful jets than\nblack holes at a given X-ray luminosity. This has made them more difficult to\nstudy as they fade towards quiescence. To explore whether neutron stars power\njets at low accretion rates ($L_{\\rm X} \\lesssim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), we\ninvestigate the radio and X-ray properties of three accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsars (IGR J17511-3057, SAX J1808.4-3658 and IGR J00291+5934) during their\noutbursts in 2015, and of the non-pulsing neutron star Cen X-4 in quiescence\n(2015) and in outburst (1979). We did not detect the radio counterpart of IGR\nJ17511-3057 in outburst or of Cen X-4 in quiescence, but did detect IGR\nJ00291+5934 and SAX J1808.4-3658, showing that at least some neutron stars\nlaunch jets at low accretion rates. While the radio and X-ray emission in IGR\nJ00291+5934 seem to be tightly correlated, the relationship in SAX J1808.4-3658\nis more complicated. We find that SAX J1808.4-3658 produces jets during the\nreflaring tail, and we explore a toy model to ascertain whether the radio\nemission could be attributed to the onset of a strong propeller. The lack of a\nuniversal radio/X-ray correlation, with different behaviours in different\nneutron star systems (with various radio/X-ray correlations; some being radio\nfaint and others not), points at distinct disk-jet interactions in individual\nsources, while always being fainter in the radio band than black holes at the\nsame X-ray luminosity.\n", "  We studied optical variability (OV) of a large sample of narrow-line Seyfert\n1 (NLSy1) and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies with z<0.8 to investigate\nany differences in their OV properties. Using archival optical V-band light\ncurves from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey that span 5-9 years and\nmodeling them using damped random walk, we estimated the amplitude of\nvariability. We found NLSy1 galaxies as a class show lower amplitude of\nvariability than their broad-line counterparts. In the sample of both NLSy1 and\nBLSy1 galaxies, radio-loud sources are found to have higher variability\namplitude than radio-quiet sources. Considering only sources that are detected\nin the X-ray band, NLSy1 galaxies are less optically variable than BLSy1\ngalaxies. The amplitude of variability in the sample of both NLSy1 and BLSy1\ngalaxies is found to be anti-correlated with Fe II strength but correlated with\nthe width of the H-beta line. The well-known anti-correlation of\nvariability-luminosity and the variability-Eddington ratio is present in our\ndata. Among the radio-loud sample, variability amplitude is found to be\ncorrelated with radio-loudness and radio-power suggesting jets also play an\nimportant role in the OV in radio-loud objects, in addition to the Eddington\nratio, which is the main driving factor of OV in radio-quiet sources.\n", "  An upgrade of the ATLAS experiment for the High Luminosity phase of LHC is\nplanned for 2024 and foresees the replacement of the present Inner Detector\n(ID) with a new Inner Tracker (ITk) completely made of silicon devices.\nDepleted active pixel sensors built with the High Voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS)\ntechnology are investigated as an option to cover large areas in the outermost\nlayers of the pixel detector and are especially interesting for the development\nof monolithic devices which will reduce the production costs and the material\nbudget with respect to the present hybrid assemblies. For this purpose the\nH35DEMO, a large area HV-CMOS demonstrator chip, was designed by KIT, IFAE and\nUniversity of Liverpool, and produced in AMS 350 nm CMOS technology. It\nconsists of four pixel matrices and additional test structures. Two of the\nmatrices include amplifiers and discriminator stages and are thus designed to\nbe operated as monolithic detectors. In these devices the signal is mainly\nproduced by charge drift in a small depleted volume obtained by applying a bias\nvoltage of the order of 100 V. Moreover, to enhance the radiation hardness of\nthe chip, this technology allows to enclose the electronics in the same deep\nN-WELLs which are also used as collecting electrodes. In this contribution the\ncharacterisation of H35DEMO chips and results of the very first beam test\nmeasurements of the monolithic CMOS matrices with high energetic pions at CERN\nSPS will be presented.\n", "  An exoplanet-exomoon system presents a superposition of phase curves to\nobservers - the dominant component varies according to the planetary period,\nand the lesser varies according to both the planetary and the lunar period. If\nthe spectra of the two bodies differs significantly, then it is likely there\nare wavelength regimes where the contrast between the moon and planet is\nsignificantly larger. In principle, this effect could be used to isolate\nperiodic oscillations in the combined phase curve. Being able to detect the\nexomoon component would allow a characterisation of the exomoon radius, and\npotentially some crude atmospheric data.\n  We run a parameter survey of combined exoplanet-exomoon phase curves, which\nshow that for most sets of planet-moon parameters, the lunar component of the\nphase curve is undetectable to current state-of-the-art transit observations.\nEven with future transit survey missions, measuring the exomoon signal will\nmost likely require photometric precision of 10 parts per million or better.\n  The only exception to this is if the moon is strongly tidally heated or in\nsome way self-luminous. In this case, measurements of the phase curve at\nwavelengths greater than a few microns can be dominated by the lunar\ncontribution. Instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and its\nsuccessors are needed to make this method feasible.\n", "  Multi-wavelength CCD photometry over 21 years has been used to produce deep\ncolor-magnitude diagrams together with light curves for the variables in the\nGalactic globular cluster NGC 5824. Twenty-one new cluster RR Lyrae stars are\nidentified, bringing the total to 47, of which 42 have reliable periods\ndetermined for the first time. The color-magnitude diagram is matched using\nBaSTI isochrones with age of $13$~Gyr. and reddening is found to be $E(B-V) =\n0.15 \\pm0.02$; using the period-Wesenheit relation in two colors the distance\nmodulus is $(m-M)_0=17.45 \\pm 0.07$ corresponding to a distance of 30.9 Kpc.\nThe observations show no signs of populations that are significantly younger\nthan the $13$~Gyr stars. The width of the red giant branch does not allow for a\nspread in [Fe/H] greater than $\\sigma = 0.05$ dex, and there is no photometric\nevidence for widened or parallel sequences. The $V, c_{UBI}$ pseudo-color\nmagnitude diagram shows a bifurcation of the red giant branch that by analogy\nwith other clusters is interpreted as being due to differing spectral\nsignatures of the first (75\\%) and second (25\\%) generations of stars whose age\ndifference is close enough that main sequence turnoffs in the color-magnitude\ndiagram are unresolved. The cluster main sequence is visible against the\nbackground out to a radial distance of $\\sim17$ arcmin. We conclude that NGC\n5824 appears to be a classical Oosterhoff Type II globular cluster, without\novert signs of being a remnant of a now-disrupted dwarf galaxy.\n", "  Recent work has found evidence for a difference in the bias and dark matter\nhalo masses of WISE-selected obscured and unobscured quasars, implying a\ndistinction between these populations beyond random line-of-sight effects.\nHowever, the significance of this difference in the most up-to-date\nmeasurements is relatively weak, at $\\sim$2$\\sigma$ for individual measurements\nbut bolstered by agreement from different techniques, including angular\nclustering and cross-correlations with cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nlensing maps. Here, we expand the footprint of previous work, aiming to improve\nthe precision of both methods. In this larger area we correct for position\ndependent selection effects, in particular fluctuations of the WISE-selected\nquasar density as a function of Galactic latitude. We also measure the\ncross-correlation of the obscured and unobscured samples and confirm that they\nare well-matched in redshift, both centred at $z=1$. Combined with very similar\ndetection fractions and magnitude distributions in the long-wavelength WISE\nbands, this redshift match strongly supports the fact that IR selection\nidentifies obscured and unobscured quasars of similar bolometric luminosity.\nFinally, we perform cross-correlations with confirmed spectroscopic quasars,\nagain confirming the results from other methods --- obscured quasars reside in\nhaloes a factor of 3 times more massive than unobscured quasars. This\ndifference is significant at the $\\sim$5$\\sigma$ level when the measurements\nare combined, strong support for the idea that obscuration in at least some\nquasars is tied to the larger environment, and may have an evolutionary\ncomponent.\n", "  Recently, the fabrication of CdSe nanoplatelets became an important research\ntopic. Nanoplatelets are often described as having a similar electronic\nstructure as 2D dimensional quantum wells and are promoted as colloidal quantum\nwells with monolayer precision width. In this paper, we show, that\nnanoplatelets are not ideal quantum wells, but cover depending on the size: the\nstrong confinement regime, an intermediate regime and a Coulomb dominated\nregime. Thus, nanoplatelets are an ideal platform to study the physics in these\nregimes. Therefore, the exciton states of the nanoplatelets are numerically\ncalculated by solving the full four dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation. We\ncompare the results with approximate solutions from semiconductor quantum well\nand quantum dot theory. The paper can also act as review of these concepts for\nthe colloidal nanoparticle community.\n", "  This optical catalogue combines the all-sky USNO-B1.0/A1.0 and most-sky APM\ncatalogues, plus overlays of SDSS optical data, into a single all-sky map\npresented in a sparse binary format which is easily downloaded at 9Gb zipped.\nTotal count is 1,163,237,190 sources and each has J2000 astrometry, red & blue\nmagnitudes with PSFs and variability indicator, and flags for proper motion,\nepoch, and source survey & catalogue for each of the photometry and astrometry.\nThe catalogue is available on the PASA datastore at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4225/50/5807fbc12595f .\n", "  The noncontextuality condition states that a value of any observable is\nindependent of which other compatible observable is measured jointly with it.\nKlyachko, Can, Binicio{\\u{g}}lu, and Shumovsky have introduced an inequality\nwhich holds if there is a noncontextual hidden variable theory. It is called\nKCBS inequality, which is state-dependent. Its violation shows a contradiction\nbetween predictions of quantum theory and noncontextual hidden variable\ntheories. In the present paper, it is shown that there is a state which does\nnot violate KCBS inequality in the case of quantum mechanics of finite degrees\nof freedom, and that any normal state violates it in the case of algebraic\nquantum field theory. It is a difference between quantum mechanics of finite\ndegrees of freedom and algebraic quantum field theory from a point of view of\nKCBS inequality.\n", "  Only one carbon-rich (C-rich, hereinafter) Mira variable has so far been\nsuggested as a member of the Galactic bulge and this is in a symbiotic system.\nHere we describe a method for selecting C-rich candidates from an infrared\ncolour-colour diagram, (J-Ks) vs ([9]-[18]). Follow-up low-resolution\nspectroscopy resulted in the detection of 8 C-rich Mira variables from a sample\nof36 candidates towards the Galactic bulge. Our near-infrared photometry\nindicates that two of these, including the known symbiotic, are closer than the\nmain body of the bulge while a third is a known foreground object. Of the 5\nbulge members, one shows He I and [O II] emission and is possibly another\nsymbiotic star. Our method is useful for identifying rare C-rich stars in the\nGalactic bulge and elsewhere. The age of these C-rich stars and the\nevolutionary process which produced them remain uncertain. They could be old\nand the products of either binary mass transfer or mergers, i.e. the\ndescendants of blue stragglers, but we cannot rule out the possibility that\nthey belong to a small in-situ population of metal-poor intermediate age (less\nthan 5 Gyr) stars in the bulge or that they have been accreted from a dwarf\ngalaxy.\n", "  Understanding the properties of dust emission in the microwave domain is an\nimportant premise for the next generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nexperiments, devoted to the measurement of the primordial $B$-modes of\npolarization. In this paper, we compare three solutions to thermal dust\nemission by the Planck Collaboration \\cite{PlanckDust03,planck_16,planck_com}\nto point out significant differences between their respective parameters (the\nspectral index $\\beta$, the optical depth $\\tau$ and the dust temperature\n$T_d$). These differences originate from e.g. the priors on the parameters or\nthe contribution of the Cosmic infrared background (CIB).\n", "  Thermohaline mixing is a favoured mechanism for the so-called \"extra mixing\"\non the red giant branch of low-mass stars. The mixing is triggered by the\nmolecular weight inversion created above the hydrogen shell during first\ndredge-up when helium-3 burns via 3He(3He,2p)4He. The standard 1D diffusive\nmixing scheme cannot simultaneously match carbon and lithium abundances to NGC\n6397 red giants. We investigate two modifications to the standard scheme: (1)\nan advective two stream mixing algorithm, and (2) modifications to the standard\n1D thermohaline mixing formalism. We cannot simultaneously match carbon and\nlithium abundances using our two stream mixing approach. However we develop a\nmodified diffusive scheme with an explicit temperature dependence that can\nsimultaneously fit carbon and lithium abundances to NGC 6397 stars. Our\nmodified diffusive scheme induces mixing that is faster than the standard\ntheory predicts in the hotter part of the thermohaline region and mixing that\nis slower in the cooler part. Our results infer that the extra mixing mechanism\nneeds further investigation and more observations are required, particularly\nfor stars in different clusters spanning a range in metallicity.\n", "  Small-diameter muon drift tube (sMDT) detectors have been developed for\nupgrades of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. With a tube diameter of 15 mm, they\nprovide an about an order of magnitude higher rate capability than the present\nATLAS muon tracking detectors, the MDT chambers with 30 mm tube diameter. The\ndrift-tube design and the construction methods have been optimised for mass\nproduction and allow for complex shapes required for maximising the acceptance.\nA record sense wire positioning accuracy of 0.005 mm has been achieved with the\nnew design. 14 new sMDT chambers are already operational in ATLAS, further 16\nare under construction for installation in the 2019-2020 LHC shutdown. For the\nupgrade of the barrel muon spectrometer for High-Luminosity LHC, 96 sMDT\nchambers will be contructed between 2020 and 2024.\n", "  The X-ray regime, where the most massive visible component of galaxy\nclusters, the intra cluster medium (ICM), is visible, offers directly measured\nquantities, like the luminosity, and derived quantities, like the total mass,\nto characterize these objects. The aim of this project is to analyze a complete\nsample of galaxy clusters in detail and constrain cosmological parameters, like\nthe matter density, OmegaM, or the amplitude of initial density fluctuations,\nsigma8. The purely X-ray flux-limited sample (HIFLUGCS) consists of the 64\nX-ray brightest galaxy clusters, which are excellent targets to study the\nsystematic effects, that can bias results. We analyzed in total 196 Chandra\nobservations of the 64 HIFLUGCS clusters, with a total exposure time of 7.7 Ms.\nHere we present our data analysis procedure (including an automated\nsubstructure detection and an energy band optimization for surface brightness\nprofile analysis) which gives individually determined, robust total mass\nestimates. These masses are tested against dynamical and Planck\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) derived masses of the same clusters, where good overall\nagreement is found with the dynamical masses. The Planck SZ masses seem to show\na mass dependent bias to our hydrostatic masses; possible biases in this\nmass-mass comparison are discussed including the Planck selection function.\nFurthermore, we show the results for the 0.1-2.4-keV-luminosity vs. mass\nscaling-relation. The overall slope of the sample (1.34) is in agreement with\nexpectations and values from literature. Splitting the sample into galaxy\ngroups and clusters reveals, even after a selection bias correction, that\ngalaxy groups exhibit a significantly steeper slope (1.88) compared to clusters\n(1.06).\n", "  Line lists for the ground electronic ground state for six major isotopologues\nof nitric oxide are presented. The line lists are constructed using empirical\nenergy levels (and line positions) and high-level {\\it ab inito} intensities.\nThe energy levels were obtained using a combination of two approaches, from an\neffective Hamiltonian and from solving the rovibronic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nvariationally. The effective hamiltonian model was obtained through a fit to\nthe experimental line positions of NO available in the literature for all six\nisotopologues using the programs SPFIT and SPCAT. The variational model was\nbuilt through a least squares fit of the \\textit{ab inito} potential and\nspin-orbit curves to the experimentally derived energies and experimental line\npositions of the main isotopologue only using the Duo program. The \\textit{ab\ninito} potential energy, spin-orbit and dipole moment curves (PEC, SOC and DMC)\nare computed using high-level {\\it ab inito} methods and the MARVEL method is\nused to obtain energies of NO from experimental transition frequencies. Each\nline list covers a wavenumber range from 0 - 40,000 \\cm with approximately\n22,000 rovibronic states and 2.3-2.6 million transitions extending to $J_{max}\n= 184.5$ and $v_{max} = 51$. Partition functions are also calculated up to a\ntemperature of 5000 K. The calculated absorption line intensities at 296 K\nusing these line lists show excellent agreement with those included in the\nHITRAN and HITEMP databases. The computed NO line lists are the most\ncomprehensive to date, covering a wider wavenumber and temperature range\ncompared to both the HITRAN and HITEMP databases. These line lists are also\nmore accurate than those used in HITEMP. The full line lists are available from\nthe CDS and ExoMol databases; data will also be available from CDMS.\n", "  We report on zero-field muon spin rotation, electron spin resonance and\npolarized Raman scattering measurements of the coupled quantum spin ladder\nBa2CuTeO6. Zero-field muon spin rotation and electron spin resonance probes\ndisclose a successive crossover from a paramagnetic through a spin-liquid-like\ninto a magnetically ordered state with decreasing temperature. More\nsignificantly, the two-magnon Raman response obeys a T-linear scaling relation\nin its peak energy, linewidth and intensity. This critical scaling behavior\npresents an experimental signature of proximity to a quantum critical point\nfrom an ordered side in Ba2CuTeO6.\n", "  In this paper we study the full sample of known Spitzer [$3.6~\\mu$m] and\n$J$-band variable brown dwarfs. We calculate the rotational velocities, $v\\sin\ni$, of 16 variable brown dwarfs using archival Keck NIRSPEC data and compute\nthe inclination angles of 19 variable brown dwarfs.\n  The results obtained show that all objects in the sample with mid-IR\nvariability detections are inclined at an angle $>20^{\\circ}$, while all\nobjects in the sample displaying $J$-band variability have an inclination angle\n$>35^{\\circ}$. $J$-band variability appears to be more affected by inclination\nthan \\textit{Spitzer} [$3.6~\\mu$m] variability, and is strongly attenuated at\nlower inclinations. Since $J$-band observations probe deeper into the\natmosphere than mid-IR observations, this effect may be due to the increased\natmospheric path length of $J$-band flux at lower inclinations.\n  We find a statistically significant correlation between the colour anomaly\nand inclination of our sample, where field objects viewed equator-on appear\nredder than objects viewed at lower inclinations. Considering the full sample\nof known variable L, T and Y spectral type objects in the literature, we find\nthat the variability properties of the two bands display notably different\ntrends, due to both intrinsic differences between bands and the sensitivity of\nground-based versus space-based searches. However, in both bands we find that\nvariability amplitude may reach a maximum at $\\sim7-9~$hr periods. Finally, we\nfind a strong correlation between colour anomaly and variability amplitude for\nboth the $J$-band and mid-IR variability detections, where redder objects\ndisplay higher variability amplitudes.\n", "  A brief overview of the development of neutrino detectors for long-baseline\noscillation experiments at accelerators and reactors is presented. Basic\nprinciples and main features of detectors of running accelerator experiments\nT2K and NOvA sensitive to a first level of CP violation and neutrino mass\nhierarchy, and reactor experiments Daya Bay, RENO and Double Chooz which\nmeasured the mixing angle \\theta_13 are discussed. A variety of different\nexperimental techniques is proposed and developed for the next generation\noscillation experiments: a 20 kt scintillator detector for the reactor\nexperiment JUNO, a 0.52 kt water-Cherenkov detector Hyper-Kamiokande, and a\nmassive liquid argon time-projection chamber neutrino detector envisaged for\nthe DUNE experiment. Present status of these detectors, recent progress in R&D\nand future prospects are summarized in this paper.\n", "  As a dedicated synthetic aperture radio interferometer, the MingantU SpEctral\nRadioheliograph (MUSER), initially known as the Chinese Spectral\nRadioHeliograph (CSRH), has entered the stage of routine observation. More than\n23 million data records per day need to be effectively managed to provide high\nperformance data query and retrieval for scientific data reduction. In light of\nthese massive amounts of data generated by the MUSER, in this paper, a novel\ndata management technique called the negative database (ND) is proposed and\nused to implement a data management system for the MUSER. Based on the\nkey-value database, the ND technique makes complete utilization of the\ncomplement set of observational data to derive the requisite information.\nExperimental results showed that the proposed ND can significantly reduce\nstorage volume in comparison with a relational database management system\n(RDBMS). Even when considering the time needed to derive records that were\nabsent, its overall performance, including querying and deriving the data of\nthe ND, is comparable with that of an RDBMS. The ND technique effectively\nsolves the problem of massive data storage for the MUSER, and is a valuable\nreference for the massive data management required in next-generation\ntelescopes.\n", "  We present the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) library, a python package\ndedicated to astronomical high-contrast imaging. Our package relies on the\nextensive python stack of scientific libraries and aims to provide a flexible\nframework for high-contrast data and image processing. In this paper, we\ndescribe the capabilities of VIP related to processing image sequences acquired\nusing the angular differential imaging (ADI) observing technique. VIP\nimplements functionalities for building high-contrast data processing\npipelines, encompass- ing pre- and post-processing algorithms, potential\nsources position and flux estimation, and sensitivity curves generation. Among\nthe reference point-spread function subtraction techniques for ADI\npost-processing, VIP includes several flavors of principal component analysis\n(PCA) based algorithms, such as annular PCA and incremental PCA algorithm\ncapable of processing big datacubes (of several gigabytes) on a computer with\nlimited memory. Also, we present a novel ADI algorithm based on non-negative\nmatrix factorization (NMF), which comes from the same family of low-rank matrix\napproximations as PCA and provides fairly similar results. We showcase the ADI\ncapabilities of the VIP library using a deep sequence on HR8799 taken with the\nLBTI/LMIRCam and its recently commissioned L-band vortex coronagraph. Using VIP\nwe investigated the presence of additional companions around HR8799 and did not\nfind any significant additional point source beyond the four known planets. VIP\nis available at http://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP and is accompanied with\nJupyter notebook tutorials illustrating the main functionalities of the\nlibrary.\n", "  Solar chromospheric observations of sunspot umbrae offer an exceptional view\nof magneto-hydrodynamic wave phenomena. In recent years, a wealth of wave\nsignatures related to propagating magneto-acoustic modes have been presented,\nwhich demonstrate complex spatial and temporal structuring of the wave\ncomponents. Theoretical modelling has demonstrated how these ubiquitous waves\nare consistent with an m=0 slow magneto-acoustic mode, which are excited by\ntrapped sub-photospheric acoustic (p-mode) waves. However, the spectrum of\numbral waves is broad, suggesting that the observed signatures represent the\nsuperposition of numerous frequencies and/or modes. We apply Fourier filtering,\nin both spatial and temporal domains, to extract chromospheric umbral wave\ncharacteristics consistent with an m=1 slow magneto-acoustic mode. This\nidentification has not been described before. Angular frequencies of 0.037 +/-\n0.007 rad/s (2.1 +/- 0.4 deg/s), corresponding to a period approximately 170 s\nfor the m=1 mode are uncovered for spatial wavenumbers in the range of\n0.45<k<0.90 arcsec^-1 (5000-9000 km). Theoretical dispersion relations are\nsolved, with corresponding eigenfunctions computed, which allows the density\nperturbations to be investigated and compared with our observations. Such\nmagnetohydrodynamic modelling confirms our interpretation that the identified\nwave signatures are the first direct observations of an m=1 slow\nmagneto-acoustic mode in the chromospheric umbra of a sunspot.\n", "  We present a tutorial on the determination of the physical conditions and\nchemical abundances in gaseous nebulae. We also include a brief review of\nrecent results on the study of gaseous nebulae, their relevance for the study\nof stellar evolution, galactic chemical evolution, and the evolution of the\nuniverse. One of the most important problems in abundance determinations is the\nexistence of a discrepancy between the abundances determined with collisionally\nexcited lines and those determined by recombination lines, this is called the\nADF (abundance discrepancy factor) problem; we review results related to this\nproblem. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for the large t$^2$ values\nobserved in gaseous nebulae.\n", "  We report on the observation of magnon thermal conductivity $\\kappa_m\\sim$ 70\nW/mK near 5 K in the helimagnetic insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, exceeding that\nmeasured in any other ferromagnet by almost two orders of magnitude. Ballistic,\nboundary-limited transport for both magnons and phonons is established below 1\nK, and Poiseuille flow of magnons is proposed to explain a magnon mean-free\npath substantially exceeding the specimen width for the least defective\nspecimens in the range 2 K $<T<$ 10 K. These observations establish\nCu$_2$OSeO$_3$ as a model system for studying long-wavelength magnon dynamics.\n", "  We study slowly pulling block-spring models in random media. Second-order\nphase transitions exist in a model pulled by a constant force in the case of\nvelocity-strengthening friction. If external forces are slowly increased,\nnearly critical states are self-organized. Slips of various sizes occur, and\nthe probability distributions of slip size roughly obey power laws. The\nexponent is close to that in the quenched Edwards--Wilkinson model.\nFurthermore, the slip-size distributions are investigated in cases of Coulomb\nfriction, velocity-weakening friction.\n", "  Large Area X-ray Propositional Counter (LAXPC) instrument on AstroSat is\naimed at providing high time resolution X-ray observations in 3 to 80 keV\nenergy band with moderate energy resolution. To achieve large collecting area,\na cluster of three co-aligned identical LAXPC detectors, is used to realize an\neffective area in access of about 6000 cm2 at 15 keV. The large detection\nvolume of the LAXPC detectors, filled with xenon gas at about 2 atmosphere\npressure, results in detection efficiency greater than 50%, above 30 keV. In\nthis article, we present salient features of the LAXPC detectors, their testing\nand characterization in the laboratory prior to launch and calibration in the\norbit. Some preliminary results on timing and spectral characteristics of a few\nX-ray binaries and other type of sources, are briefly discussed to demonstrate\nthat the LAXPC instrument is performing as planned in the orbit.\n", "  This paper presents a series of stratified shearing-box simulations of\ncollisionless accretion disks in the recently developed framework of kinetic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which can handle finite non-gyrotropy of a pressure\ntensor. Although a fully kinetic simulation predicted a more efficient\nangular-momentum transport in collisionless disks than in the standard MHD\nregime, the enhanced transport has not been observed in past kinetic MHD\napproaches to gyrotropic pressure anisotropy. For the purpose of investigating\nthis missing link between the fully kinetic and MHD treatments, this paper pays\nattention to the role of non-gyrotropic pressure, and makes a first attempt to\nincorporate certain collisionless effects into disk-scale, stratified disk\nsimulations. When the timescale of gyrotropization was longer than, or\ncomparable to, the disk rotation frequency of the orbit, we found that the\nfinite non-gyrotropy selectively remaining in the vicinity of current sheets\ncontributes to suppressing magnetic reconnection in the shearing-box system.\nThis leads to increases both in the saturated amplitude of the MHD turbulence\ndriven by magnetorotational instabilities and in the resultant efficiency of\nangular-momentum transport. Our results seem favorable for fast advection of\nmagnetic fields toward the rotation axis of a central object, which is required\nto launch an ultra-relativistic jet from a black-hole accretion system in, for\nexample, a magnetically arrested disk state.\n", "  A recent stacking analysis of Planck HFI data of galaxy clusters (Hurier\n2016) allowed to derive the cluster temperatures by using the relativistic\ncorrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the temperatures\nof high-temperature clusters, as derived from this analysis, resulted to be\nbasically higher than the temperatures derived from X-ray measurements, at a\nmoderate statistical significance of $1.5\\sigma$. This discrepancy has been\nattributed by Hurier (2016) to calibration issues. In this paper we discuss an\nalternative explanation for this discrepancy in terms of a non-thermal SZE\nastrophysical component. We find that this explanation can work if non-thermal\nelectrons in galaxy clusters have a low value of their minimum momentum\n($p_1\\sim0.5-1$), and if their pressure is of the order of $20-30\\%$ of the\nthermal gas pressure. Both these conditions are hard to obtain if the\nnon-thermal electrons are mixed with the hot gas in the intra cluster medium,\nbut can be possibly obtained if the non-thermal electrons are mainly confined\nin bubbles with high content of non-thermal plasma and low content of thermal\nplasma, or in giant radio lobes/relics located in the outskirts of clusters. In\norder to derive more precise results on the properties of non-thermal electrons\nin clusters, and in view of more solid detections of a discrepancy between\nX-rays and SZE derived clusters temperatures that cannot be explained in other\nways, it would be necessary to reproduce the full analysis done by Hurier\n(2016) by adding systematically the non-thermal component of the SZE.\n", "  We investigate the astrophysics of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies and\nac- tive galactic nuclei (AGNs), and elucidate their statistical properties in\nthe radio band including luminosity functions, redshift distributions, and\nnumber counts at sub-mJy flux levels, that will be crucially probed by\nnext-generation radio continuum surveys. Specifically, we exploit the\nmodel-independent approach by Mancuso et al. (2016a,b) to compute the star\nformation rate functions, the AGN duty cycles and the conditional probability\nof a star-forming galaxy to host an AGN with given bolometric luminosity.\nCoupling these ingredients with the radio emission properties associated to\nstar formation and nuclear activity, we compute relevant statistics at\ndifferent radio frequencies, and disentangle the relative con- tribution of\nstar-forming galaxies and AGNs in different radio luminosity, radio flux, and\nredshift ranges. Finally, we highlight that radio-emitting star-forming\ngalaxies and AGNs are expected to host supermassive black holes accreting with\ndifferent Eddington ratio distributions, and to occupy different loci in the\ngalaxy main sequence diagrams. These specific predictions are consistent with\ncurrent datasets, but need to be tested with larger statistics via future radio\ndata with multi-band coverage on wide areas, as it will become routinely\nachievable with the advent of the SKA and its precursors.\n", "  We explore the potential of INTEGRAL to improve our understanding of the low\nfluence regime for explosive transients, such as GRBs. We probe the nature of\nthe so-called \"WEAK\" INTEGRAL triggers, when the gamma-ray instruments record\nintensity spikes that are below the usual STRONG significance thresholds. In a\ntargeted Swift follow-up campaign, we observed 15 WEAK triggers. We find six of\nthese can be classified as GRBs. This includes GRB150305A, a GRB discovered\nfrom our campaign alone. We also identified a source coincident with one\ntrigger, IGRW151019, as a candidate AGN. We show that real events such as GRBs\nexist within the IBAS WEAK trigger population. A comparison of the fluence\ndistributions of the full INTEGRAL IBAS and Swift BAT GRB samples showed that\nthe two are similar. We also find correlations between the prompt gamma-ray and\nX-ray properties of the two samples, supporting previous investigations. We\nfind that both satellites reach similar, low fluence levels regularly, although\nSwift is more sensitive to short, low fluence GRBs.\n", "  Careful analyses of photometric and star count data available for the nine\nputative young clusters identified by Camargo et al. (2015, 2016) at high\nGalactic latitudes reveal that none of the groups contain early-type stars, and\nmost are not significant density enhancements above field level. 2MASS colours\nfor stars in the groups match those of unreddened late-type dwarfs and giants,\nas expected for contamination by (mostly) thin disk objects. A simulation of\none such field using only typical high latitude foreground stars yields a\ncolour-magnitude diagram that is very similar to those constructed by Camargo\net al. (2015, 2016) as evidence for their young groups as well as the means of\nderiving their reddenings and distances. Although some of the fields are\ncoincident with clusters of galaxies, one must conclude that there is no\nevidence that the putative clusters are extremely young stellar groups.\n", "  Before using 3D MHD simulations of the solar photosphere in the determination\nof elemental abundances, one has to ensure that the correct amount of magnetic\nflux is present in the simulations. The presence of magnetic flux modifies the\nthermal structure of the solar photosphere, which affects abundance\ndeterminations and the solar spectral irradiance. We compare the polarization\nsignals in disk-center observations of the solar photosphere in quiet-Sun\nregions with those in Stokes spectra computed on the basis of 3D MHD\nsimulations having average magnetic flux densities of about 20, 56, 112 and 224\nG. This approach allows us to find the simulation run that best matches the\nobservations. The observations were taken with the Hinode SP, TIP, POLIS and\nthe GFPI, respectively. We determine characteristic quantities of full Stokes\nprofiles in a few photospheric spectral lines in the visible (630 nm) and\nnear-infrared (1083 and 1565 nm). We find that the appearance of abnormal\ngranulation in intensity maps of degraded simulations can be traced back to an\ninitially regular granulation pattern with numerous bright points in the\nintergranular lanes before the spatial degradation. The linear polarization\nsignals in the simulations are almost exclusively related to canopies of strong\nmagnetic flux concentrations and not to transient events of magnetic flux\nemergence. We find that the average vertical magnetic flux density in the\nsimulation should be less than 50 G to reproduce the observed polarization\nsignals in the quiet Sun internetwork. A value of about 35 G gives the best\nmatch across the SP, TIP, POLIS and GFPI observations.\n", "  We present $\\sim1-4\"$ resolution Very Large Array (VLA) observations of four\nCH$_3$OH $J_2-J_1$-$E$ 25~GHz transitions ($J$=3, 5, 8, 10) along with 1.3~cm\ncontinuum toward 20 regions of active massive star formation containing\nExtended Green Objects (EGOs), 14 of which we have previously studied with the\nVLA in the Class~I 44~GHz and Class~II 6.7~GHz maser lines (Cyganowski et al.\n2009). Sixteen regions are detected in at least one 25~GHz line ($J$=5), with\n13 of 16 exhibiting maser emission. In total, we report 34 new sites of\nCH$_3$OH maser emission and ten new sites of thermal CH$_3$OH emission,\nsignificantly increasing the number of 25~GHz Class I CH$_3$OH masers observed\nat high angular resolution. We identify probable or likely maser counterparts\nat 44~GHz for all 15 of the 25~GHz masers for which we have complementary data,\nproviding further evidence that these masers trace similar physical conditions\ndespite uncorrelated flux densities. The sites of thermal and maser emission of\nCH$_3$OH are both predominantly associated with the 4.5 $\\mu$m emission from\nthe EGO, and the presence of thermal CH$_3$OH emission is accompanied by 1.3~cm\ncontinuum emission in 9 out of 10 cases. Of the 19 regions that exhibit 1.3~cm\ncontinuum emission, it is associated with the EGO in 16 cases (out of a total\nof 20 sites), 13 of which are new detections at 1.3~cm. Twelve of the 1.3~cm\ncontinuum sources are associated with 6.7~GHz maser emission and likely trace\ndeeply-embedded massive protostars.\n", "  Major mergers are considered to be a significant source of turbulence in\nclusters. We performed a numerical simulation of a major merger event using\nnested-grid initial conditions, adaptive mesh refinement, radiative cooling of\nprimordial gas, and a homogeneous ultraviolet background. By calculating the\nmicroscopic viscosity on the basis of various theoretical assumptions and\nestimating the Kolmogorov length from the turbulent dissipation rate computed\nwith a subgrid-scale model, we are able to demonstrate that most of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium can sustain a fully turbulent state only if the\nmagnetic suppression of the viscosity is considerable. Accepting this as\npremise, it turns out that ratios of turbulent and thermal quantities change\nonly little in the course of the merger. This confirms the tight correlations\nbetween the mean thermal and non-thermal energy content for large samples of\nclusters in earlier studies, which can be interpreted as second self-similarity\non top of the self-similarity for different halo masses. Another long-standing\nquestion is how and to which extent turbulence contributes to the support of\nthe gas against gravity. From a global perspective, the ratio of turbulent and\nthermal pressures is significant for the clusters in our simulation. On the\nother hand, a local measure is provided by the compression rate, i.e. the\ngrowth rate of the divergence of the flow. Particularly for the intracluster\nmedium, we find that the dominant contribution against gravity comes from\nthermal pressure, while compressible turbulence effectively counteracts the\nsupport. For this reason it appears to be too simplistic to consider turbulence\nmerely as an effective enhancement of thermal energy.\n", "  The scaling up of electron spin qubit based nanocircuits has remained\nchallenging up to date and involves the development of efficient charge control\nstrategies. Here we report on the experimental realization of a linear triple\nquantum dot in a regime isolated from the reservoir. We show how this regime\ncan be reached with a fixed number of electrons. Charge stability diagrams of\nthe one, two and three electron configurations where only electron exchange\nbetween the dots is allowed are observed. They are modelled with established\ntheory based on a capacitive model of the dot systems. The advantages of the\nisolated regime with respect to experimental realizations of quantum simulators\nand qubits are discussed. We envision that the results presented here will make\nmore manipulation schemes for existing qubit implementations possible and will\nultimately allow to increase the number of tunnel coupled quantum dots which\ncan be simultaneously controlled.\n", "  In order to extend the direct observation of high-energy cosmic rays up to\nthe PeV region, highly performing calorimeters with large geometrical\nacceptance and high energy resolution are required. Within the constraint of\nthe total mass of the apparatus, crucial for a space mission, the calorimeters\nmust be optimized with respect to their geometrical acceptance, granularity and\nabsorption depth. CaloCube is a homogeneous calorimeter with cubic geometry, to\nmaximise the acceptance being sensitive to particles from every direction in\nspace; granularity is obtained by relying on small cubic scintillating crystals\nas active elements. Different scintillating materials have been studied. The\ncrystal sizes and spacing among them have been optimized with respect to the\nenergy resolution. A prototype, based on CsI(Tl) cubic crystals, has been\nconstructed and tested with particle beams. Some results of tests with\ndifferent beams at CERN are presented.\n", "  We present Karl G Jansky Very Large Array molecular line observations of the\nnearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, from SWAN: \"Survey of Water and Ammonia in\nNearby galaxies\". SWAN is a molecular line survey at centimeter wavelengths\ndesigned to reveal the physical conditions of star forming gas over a range of\nstar forming galaxies. NGC 253 has been observed in four 1GHz bands from 21 to\n36 GHz at 6\" ($\\sim100$pc) spatial and 3.5 km s$^{-1}$ spectral resolution. In\ntotal we detect 19 transitions from seven molecular and atomic species. We have\ntargeted the metastable inversion transitions of ammonia (NH$_{3}$) from (1,1)\nto (5,5) and the (9,9) line, the 22.2 GHz water (H$_2$O) ($6_{16}-5_{23}$)\nmaser, and the 36.1 GHz methanol (CH$_3$OH) ($4_{-1}-3_{0}$) maser. Utilizing\nNH$_{3}$ as a thermometer, we present evidence for uniform heating over the\ncentral kpc of NGC 253. The molecular gas is best described by a two kinetic\ntemperature model with a warm 130K and a cooler 57K component. A comparison of\nthese observations with previous ALMA results suggests that the molecular gas\nis not heated in photon dominated regions or shocks. It is possible that the\ngas is heated by turbulence or cosmic rays. In the galaxy center we find\nevidence for NH$_{3}$(3,3) masers. Furthermore we present velocities and\nluminosities of three water maser features related to the nuclear starburst. We\npartially resolve CH$_3$OH masers seen at the edges of the bright molecular\nemission, which coincides with expanding molecular superbubbles. This suggests\nthat the masers are pumped by weak shocks in the bubble surfaces.\n", "  We have explored the evolution of a cold debris disk under the gravitational\ninfluence of dwarf planet sized objects (DPs), both in the presence and absence\nof an interior giant planet. Through detailed long-term numerical simulations,\nwe demonstrate that, when the giant planet is not present, DPs can stir the\neccentricities and inclinations of disk particles, in linear proportion to the\ntotal mass of the DPs; on the other hand, when the giant planet is included in\nthe simulations, the stirring is approximately proportional to the mass\nsquared. This creates two regimes: below a disk mass threshold (defined by the\ntotal mass of DPs), the giant planet acts as a stabilizing agent of the orbits\nof cometary nucleii, diminishing the effect of the scatterers; above the\nthreshold, the giant contributes to the dispersion of the particles.\n", "  The heavy-ion induced reactions on intermediate mass targets are complex in\nnature, even at the low energies. To understand those nuclear reaction\nphenomena in detail, more experimental studies are required in a wide range of\nenergy. Heavy-ion reactions were investigated by measuring production cross\nsections of the residues produced in the $^{11}$B-induced reactions on $^{89}$Y\nand $^{93}$Nb at low energies, near and above the barrier, and to check the\neffectiveness of the different nuclear models to explain them. Further, aim is\nalso to optimize the production parameters of neutron deficient medically\nrelevant $^{97}$Ru and $^{101m}$Rh radioisotopes produced in those reactions,\nrespectively. The $^{11}$B-beam was allowed to impinge on $^{89}$Y and\n$^{93}$Nb foils supported by an aluminum catcher foil, arranged in a stack, in\n27.5-58.7 and 30.6-62.3 MeV energy range, respectively. The\n$\\gamma$-spectrometry was carried out after EOB to measure the activity of the\nradionuclides produced in each foil and cross sections were calculated.\nMeasured cross-sectional data were analyzed in terms of compound and\nprecompound model calculations. The measured cross sections of the residues\nshowed good agreement with the model calculations based on the Hauser-Feshbach\nformulation and exciton model. A substantial preequilibrium contribution was\nnoticed in the 3$n$ reaction channel in both the reactions. Theoretical\nestimations confirmed that major production yields are mostly contributed by\nthe compound reaction process. Preequilibrium emissions contributed at the high\nenergy tail of the 3$n$ channel for both the reactions. Moreover, an indirect\nsignature of a direct reaction influence was also observed in the $^{90m}$Y\nproduction.\n", "  The structure of K2Ni2(MoO4)3 consists of S=1 tetramers formed by Ni^{2+}\nions. The magnetic susceptibility chi(T) and specific heat Cp(T) data on a\nsingle crystal show a broad maximum due to the low-dimensionality of the system\nwith short-range spin correlations. A sharp peak is seen in chi(T) and Cp(T) at\nabout 1.13 K, well below the broad maximum. This is an indication of magnetic\nlong-range order i.e., the absence of spin-gap in the ground state.\nInterestingly, the application of a small magnetic field (H>0.1 T) induces\nmagnetic behavior akin to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of triplon\nexcitations observed in some spin-gap materials. Our results demonstrate that\nthe temperature-field (T-H) phase boundary follows a power-law\n(T-T_{N})propotional to H^(1/alpha) with the exponent 1/alpha close to 2/3, as\npredicted for BEC scenario. The observation of BEC of triplon excitations in\nsmall H infers that K2Ni2(MoO4)3 is located in the proximity of a quantum\ncritical point, which separates the magnetically ordered and spin-gap regions\nof the phase diagram.\n", "  We apply the first-order reversal curve (FORC) method, borrowed from studies\nof ferromagnetic materials, to the magneto-structural phase transition of FeTe.\nFORC measurements reveal two features in the hysteretic phase transition, even\nin samples where traditional temperature measurements display only a single\ntransition. For Fe1.13Te, the influence of magnetic field suggests that the\nmain feature is primarily structural while a smaller, slightly\nhigher-temperature transition is magnetic in origin. By contrast Fe1.03Te has a\nsingle transition which shows a uniform response to magnetic field, indicating\na stronger coupling of the magnetic and structural phase transitions. We also\nintroduce uniaxial stress, which spreads the distribution width without\nchanging the underlying energy barrier of the transformation. The work shows\nhow FORC can help disentangle the roles of the magnetic and structural phase\ntransitions in FeTe.\n", "  It is known that an embedded massive planet will open a gap in a\nprotoplanetary disc via angular momentum exchange with the disc material. The\nresulting surface density profile of the disc is investigated for one\ndimensional and two dimensional disc models and, in agreement with previous\nwork, it is found that one dimensional gaps are significantly deeper than their\ntwo dimensional counterparts for the same initial conditions. We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal\nstability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.\nFurther investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive\nto the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one\ndimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even\nfurther to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,\nespecially for lower mass planets. This behaviour is found to be consistent\nacross discs with varying parameters.\n", "  We present detailed broadband timing and spectral analysis of the persistent,\nlow luminosity and slowly spinning pulsar X Persei using a deep Suzaku\nobservation of the source. The spectrum is unusually hard with a cyclotron\nresonance scattering feature (CRSF), the presence of which has been debated. By\ncomparing the spectral models relevant for accretion powered pulsars, we have\nobtained the best constraint on the broadband spectral model of X Persei\nobtained so far. The CRSF is not confirmed in the average spectrum. We have\nalso identified, the presence of different intensity levels in the source with\ndistinct changes in the pulse profile and energy spectrum indicating changes in\nthe accretion geometry. We further find evidence of a CRSF in the highest\nintensity levels at $\\sim$ 40 keV, indicating a magnetic field strength of\n3.4$\\times10^{12}$ G.\n", "  We revisit the parameter space of singlet fermionic cold dark matter model in\norder to determine the role of the mixing angle between the standard model\nHiggs and new singlet one. Furthermore, we restudy the direct detection\nconstraints with the updated and new experimental data. As an important\nconclusion, this model is completely excluded by recent XENON100, PandaX II and\nLUX data.\n", "  We present radio observations at 1.5 GHz of 32 local objects selected to\nreproduce the physical properties of $z\\sim5$ star-forming galaxies. We also\nreport non-detections of five such sources in the sub-millimetre. We find a\nradio-derived star formation rate which is typically half that derived from\nH$\\alpha$ emission for the same objects. These observations support previous\nindications that we are observing galaxies with a young dominant stellar\npopulation, which has not yet established a strong supernova-driven synchrotron\ncontinuum. We stress caution when applying star formation rate calibrations to\nstellar populations younger than 100 Myr. We calibrate the conversions for\nyounger galaxies, which are dominated by a thermal radio emission component. We\nimprove the size constraints for these sources, compared to previous unresolved\nground-based optical observations. Their physical size limits indicate very\nhigh star formation rate surface densities, several orders of magnitude higher\nthan the local galaxy population. In typical nearby galaxies, this would imply\nthe presence of galaxy-wide winds. Given the young stellar populations, it is\nunclear whether a mechanism exists in our sources that can deposit sufficient\nkinetic energy into the interstellar medium to drive such outflows.\n", "  The quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between a pair of gravitationally\npolarizable objects induced by vacuum fluctuations of the quantum linearized\ngravitational field is first obtained with a relatively simple method, which is\nthen used to investigate the contribution of thermal fluctuations of a bath of\ngravitons to the interaction at temperature $T$. Our result shows that, in the\nhigh temperature limit, the contribution of thermal fluctuations dominates over\nthat of vacuum fluctuations and the interaction potential behaves like $T/\nr^{10} $, where $r$ is the separation between the objects, and in the low\ntemperature limit, the contribution of thermal fluctuations is proportional to\n$T^{10}/r$, which only provides a small correction to the interaction induced\nby zero-point fluctuations.\n", "  Density Functional Theory calculations using the quasi-harmonic approximation\nhave been used to calculate the solid Hugoniot of two polytypes of boron\ncarbide up to 100 GPa. Under the assumption that segregation into the elemental\nphases occurs around the pressure that the B11Cp(CBC) polytype becomes\nthermodynamically unstable with respect to boron and carbon, two\ndiscontinuities in the Hugoniot, one at 50 GPa and one at 90-100 GPa, are\npredicted. The former is a result of phase segregation, and the latter a phase\ntransition within boron. First principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations\nwere employed to calculate the liquid Hugoniot of B4C up to 1.5 TPa, and the\nresults are compared to recent experiments carried out at the Omega Laser\nFacility up to 700 GPa [Phys. Rev. B 94, 184107 (2016)]. A generally good\nagreement between theory and experiment was observed. Analysis of the FPMD\nsimulations provides evidence for an amorphous, but covalently bound, fluid\nbelow 438 GPa, and an atomistic fluid at higher pressures and temperatures.\n", "  Understanding and controlling the properties and dynamics of topological\ndefects is a lasting challenge in the study of two-dimensional materials, and\nis crucial to achieve high-quality films required for technological\napplications. Here grain boundary structures, energies, and dynamics of binary\ntwo-dimensional materials are investigated through the development of a phase\nfield crystal model that is parameterized to match the ordering, symmetry,\nenergy and length scales of hexagonal boron nitride. Our studies reveal some\nnew dislocation core structures for various symmetrically and asymmetrically\ntilted grain boundaries, in addition to those obtained in previous experiments\nand first-principles calculations. We also identify a defect-mediated growth\ndynamics for inversion domains governed by the collective atomic migration and\ndefect core transformation at grain boundaries and junctions, a process that is\nrelated to inversion symmetry breaking in binary lattice.\n", "  We compute the leading mass corrections to the high-energy behavior of the\nmassive quark vector form factor to three loops in QCD in the\ndouble-logarithmic approximation.\n", "  We report the discovery and constrain the physical conditions of the\ninterstellar medium of the highest-redshift millimeter-selected dusty\nstar-forming galaxy (DSFG) to date, SPT-S J031132-5823.4 (hereafter\nSPT0311-58), at $z=6.900 +/- 0.002$. SPT0311-58 was discovered via its 1.4mm\nthermal dust continuum emission in the South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ survey.\nThe spectroscopic redshift was determined through an ALMA 3mm frequency scan\nthat detected CO(6-5), CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), and subsequently confirmed by\ndetections of CO(3-2) with ATCA and [CII] with APEX. We constrain the\nproperties of the ISM in SPT0311-58 with a radiative transfer analysis of the\ndust continuum photometry and the CO and [CI] line emission. This allows us to\ndetermine the gas content without ad hoc assumptions about gas mass scaling\nfactors. SPT0311-58 is extremely massive, with an intrinsic gas mass of $M_{\\rm\ngas} = 3.3 \\pm 1.9 \\times10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$. Its large mass and intense star\nformation is very rare for a source well into the Epoch of Reionization.\n", "  The hierarchy of unstable modes when two counter-streaming pair plasmas\ninteract over a flow-aligned magnetic field has been recently investigated [PoP\n\\textbf{23}, 062122 (2016)]. The analysis is here extended to the case of an\narbitrarily tilted magnetic field. The two plasma shells are initially cold and\nidentical. For any angle $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi/2]$ between the field and the\ninitial flow, the hierarchy of unstable modes is numerically determined in\nterms of the initial Lorentz factor of the shells $\\gamma_0$, and the field\nstrength as measured by a parameter denoted $\\sigma$. For $\\theta=0$, four\ndifferent kinds of mode are likely to lead the linear phase. The hierarchy\nsimplifies for larger $\\theta$'s, partly because the Weibel instability can no\nlonger be cancelled in this regime. For $\\theta>0.78$ (44$^\\circ$) and in the\nrelativistic regime, the Weibel instability always govern the interaction. In\nthe non-relativistic regime, the hierarchy becomes $\\theta$-independent because\nthe interaction turns to be field-independent. As a result, the two-stream\ninstability becomes the dominant one, regardless of the field obliquity.\n", "  Measurement of M, the total multiplicity, for central collision between\ncomparable mass heavy ions can provide a signature for first order phase\ntransition. The derivative of M with respect to E*/A where E* is the excitation\nenergy in the centre of mass and A the total mass of the dissociating system is\nexpected to go through maximum as a function of E*. Theoretical modelling shows\nthat this is the energy where the specific heat Cv maximizes which typically\nhappens at first order phase transition. The measurement of total M is probably\nfeasible in more than one laboratory.\n", "  Asteroseismology provides fundamental properties (mass, radius and effective\ntemperature) of solar-like oscillating stars using so-called scaling relations.\nThese properties allow the computation of the asteroseismic distance of stars.\nWe compare the asteroseismic distances with the recently released Gaia\ndistances for 74 stars studied in Y{\\i}ld{\\i}z et al. There is a very good\nagreement between these two distances; for 64 of these stars, the difference is\nless than 10 per cent. However, a systematic difference is seen if we use the\neffective temperature obtained by spectroscopic methods; the Gaia distances are\nabout 5 per cent greater than the asteroseismic distances.\n", "  We report temperature (T) dependence of dc magnetization, electrical\nresistivity (rho(T)), and heat-capacity of rare-earth (R) compounds, Gd3RuSn6\nand Tb3RuSn6, which are found to crystallize in the Yb3CoSn6-type orthorhombic\nstructure (space group: Cmcm). The results establish that there is an onset of\nantiferromagnetic order near (T_N) 19 and 25 K respectively. In addition, we\nfind that there is another magnetic transition for both the cases around 14 and\n17 K respectively. In the case of the Gd compound, the spin-scattering\ncontribution to rho is found to increase below 75 K as the material is cooled\ntowards T_N, thereby resulting in a minimum in the plot of rho(T) unexpected\nfor Gd based systems. Isothermal magnetization at 1.8 K reveals an upward\ncurvature around 50 kOe. Isothermal magnetoresistance plots show interesting\nanomalies in the magnetically ordered state. There are sign reversals in the\nplot of isothermal entropy change versus T in the magnetically ordered state,\nindicating subtle changes in the spin reorientation with T. The results reveal\nthat these compounds exhibit interesting magnetic properties.\n", "  Circumplanetary disks regulate the late accretion to the giant planet and\nserve as the birthplace for satellites. Understanding their characteristics via\nsimulations also helps to prepare for their observations. Here we study disks\naround 1, 3, 5, 10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ planets with three dimensional, global\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations with sub-planet peak resolution, and various\nplanetary temperatures. We found that as the 1 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ planet\nradiates away its formation heat, the circumplanetary envelope transitions to a\ndisk between $T_p = 6000$ K and 4000 K. In the case of 3-10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$\nplanets a disk always forms. The temperature profile of the circumplanetary\ndisks is very steep, the inner 1/6th is over the silicate condensation\ntemperature and the entire disk is above water freezing point, making satellite\nformation impossible in this early stage ($<$1 Myr). Satellites might form much\nlater and first in the outer parts of the disk migrating inwards later on. Our\ndisk masses are $1, 7, 20, 40 \\times 10^{-3}\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ for the 1, 3, 5,\n10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$ gas giants respectively, and we provide an empirical\nformula to estimate the subdisk masses based on the planet- and circumstellar\ndisk mass. Our finding is that the cooler the planet, the lower the temperature\nof the subdisk, the higher the vertical influx velocities, and the planetary\ngap is both deeper and wider. We also show that the gaps in 2D and 3D are\ndifferent. The subdisk eccentricity increases with planetary mass and violently\ninteracts with the circumstellar disk, making satellite-formation less likely,\nif $\\mathrm{M_p} \\gtrsim 5 \\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$.\n", "  Recent observations of galaxies in a cluster at z=0.35 show that their\nintegrated gas-phase metallicities increase with decreasing cluster-centric\ndistance. To test if ram pressure stripping (RPS) is the underlying cause, we\nuse a semi-analytic model to quantify the \"observational bias\" that RPS\nintroduces into the aperture-based metallicity measurements. We take integral\nfield spectroscopy of local galaxies, remove gas from their outer galactic\ndisks via RPS, and then conduct mock slit observations of cluster galaxies at\nz=0.35. Our RPS model predicts a typical cluster-scale metallicity gradient of\n-0.03 dex/Mpc. By removing gas from the outer galactic disks, RPS introduces a\nmean metallicity enhancement of +0.02 dex at a fixed stellar mass. This gas\nremoval and subsequent quenching of star formation preferentially removes low\nmass cluster galaxies from the observed star-forming population. As only the\nmore massive star-forming galaxies survive to reach the cluster core, RPS\nproduces a cluster-scale stellar mass gradient of -0.05 log(M_*/M_sun)/Mpc.\nThis mass segregation drives the predicted cluster-scale metallicity gradient\nof -0.03 dex/Mpc. However, the effects of RPS alone can not explain the higher\nmetallicities measured in cluster galaxies at z=0.35. We hypothesize that\nadditional mechanisms including steep internal metallicity gradients and\nself-enrichment due to gas strangulation are needed to reproduce our\nobservations at z=0.35.\n", "  Past estimates for the age of the Upper Sco Association are typically 11-13\nMyr for intermediate-mass stars and 4-5 Myr for low-mass stars. In this study,\nwe simulate populations of young stars to investigate whether this apparent\ndependence of estimated age on spectral type may be explained by the star\nformation history of the association. Solar and intermediate mass stars begin\ntheir pre-main sequence evolution on the Hayashi track, with fully convective\ninteriors and cool photospheres. Intermediate mass stars quickly heat up and\ntransition onto the radiative Henyey track. As a consequence, for clusters in\nwhich star formation occurs on a similar timescale as the transition from a\nconvective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages\nare calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass. Simple simulations\nof a cluster with constant star formation over several Myr may explain about\nhalf of the difference in inferred ages versus photospheric temperature;\nspeculative constructions that consist of a constant star formation followed by\na large supernova-driven burst could fully explain the differences, including\nthose between F and G stars where evolutionary tracks may be more accurate. The\nage spreads of low-mass stars predicted from these prescriptions for star\nformation are consistent with the observed luminosity spread of Upper Sco. The\nconclusion that a lengthy star formation history will yield a temperature\ndependence in ages is expected from the basic physics of pre-main sequence\nevolution and is qualitatively robust to the large uncertainties in pre-main\nsequence evolutionary models.\n", "  We consider two chains, each made of $N$ independent oscillators, immersed in\na common thermal bath and study the dynamics of their mutual quantum\ncorrelations in the thermodynamic, large-$N$ limit. We show that dissipation\nand noise due to the presence of the external environment are able to generate\ncollective quantum correlations between the two chains at the mesoscopic level.\nThe created collective quantum entanglement between the two many-body systems\nturns out to be rather robust, surviving for asymptotically long times even for\nnon vanishing bath temperatures.\n", "  In [JETP Lett. 105(3), 152 (2017)], a clear and comprehensive analysis of the\nparadoxical results of experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402 (2013)] was\ncarried out on the basis of the classical wave theory of light, which\npresupposes the continuity of possible of light paths. It was shown that the\nparadoxical results of the experiment are due not to the discontinuity of the\ntrajectories of light, as claimed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402 (2013)], but\nto the used way of detecting the path of photons. The experiment modification\nproposed in [JETP Lett. 105(3), 152 (2017)] allows us to eliminate the seeming\ndiscontinuity of the light trajectories. In Comment [arXiv:1705.02137 (2017)]\nto the article such modification is declared unreasonable. This Response to the\nComment shows that this statement is not based on clear and logical arguments.\nInstead, it is only asserted that the proposed modification \"violates the\nfaithfulness indication of the trace\" of photons. Therefore, the Comment's\ncriticism can not be considered as well-founded. Consequently, the conclusion\nof [JETP Lett. 105(3), 152 (2017)] that a new concept of disconnected\ntrajectories proposed by the authors of work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402\n(2013)] is unnecessary, remains valid.\n", "  We present a $0.7-2.5\\mu m$ spectral library of 284 stars observed with the\nmedium-resolution infrared spectrograph, SpeX, at the 3.0 meter NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility (IRTF) on Maunakea, Hawaii. This library extends the\nmetallicity range of the IRTF Cool Star library beyond solar metallicity to\n$-1.7 <$ [Fe/H] $< 0.6$. All of the observed stars are also in the MILES\noptical stellar library, providing continuous spectral coverage for each star\nfrom $0.35-2.5\\mu m$. The spectra are absolute flux calibrated using Two Micron\nAll Sky Survey photometry and the continuum shape of the spectra is preserved\nduring the data reduction process. Synthesized $JHK_S$ colors agree with\nobserved colors at the $1-2\\%$ level, on average. We also present a spectral\ninterpolator that uses the library to create a data-driven model of spectra as\na function of $teff$, $logg$, and [Fe/H]. We use the library and interpolator\nto compare empirical trends with theoretical predictions of spectral feature\nbehavior as a function of stellar parameters. These comparisons extend to the\npreviously difficult to access low-metallicity and cool dwarf regimes, as well\nas the previously poorly sampled super-solar metallicity regime. The library\nand interpolator are publicly available.\n", "  In this paper, we succeed to bilinearize the $\\cal{PT}$-invariant nonlocal\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NNLS) equation through a nonstandard procedure and\npresent more general bright soliton solutions. We achieve this by bilinearizing\nboth the NNLS equation and its associated parity transformed complex conjugate\nequation in a novel way. The obtained one and two soliton solutions are\ninvariant under combined space and time reversal transformations and are more\ngeneral than the known ones. Further, by considering the two-soliton solution\nwe bring out certain novel interaction properties of the $\\cal{PT}$-invariant\nmulti-soliton solutions.\n", "  Recently we have demonstrated the presence of spin-orbit toque in FeMn/Pt\nmultilayers which, in combination with the anisotropy field, is able to rotate\nits magnetization consecutively from 0o to 360o without any external field.\nHere, we report on an investigation of static and dynamic magnetic properties\nof FeMn/Pt multilayers using combined techniques of magnetometry, ferromagnetic\nresonance, inverse spin Hall effect and spin Hall magnetoresistance\nmeasurements. The FeMn/Pt multilayer was found to exhibit ferromagnetic\nproperties, and its temperature dependence of saturation magnetization can be\nfitted well using a phenomenological model by including a finite distribution\nin Curie temperature due to subtle thickness variations across the multilayer\nsamples. The non-uniformity in static magnetic properties is also manifested in\nthe ferromagnetic resonance spectra, which typically exhibit a broad resonance\npeak. A damping parameter of around 0.106 is derived from the frequency\ndependence of ferromagnetic resonance linewidth, which is comparable to the\nreported values for other types of Pt-based multilayers. Clear inverse spin\nHall signals and spin Hall magnetoresistance have been observed in all samples\nbelow the Curie temperature, which corroborate the strong spin-orbit torque\neffect observed previously.\n", "  Observational studies reveal that complex organic molecules (COMs) can be\nfound in various objects associated with different star formation stages. The\nidentification of COMs in prestellar cores, i.e., cold environments in which\nthermally induced chemistry can be excluded and radiolysis is limited by cosmic\nrays and cosmic ray induced UV-photons, is particularly important as this stage\nsets up the initial chemical composition from which ultimately stars and\nplanets evolve. Recent laboratory results demonstrate that molecules as complex\nas glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol are efficiently formed on icy dust grains\nvia non-energetic atom addition reactions between accreting H atoms and CO\nmolecules, a process that dominates surface chemistry during the 'CO-freeze out\nstage' in dense cores. In the present study we demonstrate that a similar\nmechanism results in the formation of the biologically relevant molecule\nglycerol - HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH - a three-carbon bearing sugar alcohol necessary\nfor the formation of membranes of modern living cells and organelles. Our\nexperimental results are fully consistent with a suggested reaction scheme in\nwhich glycerol is formed along a chain of radical-radical and radical-molecule\ninteractions between various reactive intermediates produced upon hydrogenation\nof CO ice or its hydrogenation products. The tentative identification of the\nchemically related simple sugar glyceraldehyde - HOCH2CH(OH)CHO - is discussed\nas well. These new laboratory findings indicate that the proposed reaction\nmechanism holds much potential to form even more complex sugar alcohols and\nsimple sugars.\n", "  In Yoshii et al. (2014), we described a new method for measuring\nextragalactic distances based on dust reverberation in active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), and we validated our new method with Cepheid variable stars. In this\npaper, we validate our new method with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) which\noccurred in two of the AGN host galaxies during our AGN monitoring program: SN\n2004bd in NGC 3786 and SN 2008ec in NGC 7469. Their multicolor light curves\nwere observed and analyzed using two widely accepted methods for measuring SN\ndistances, and the distance moduli derived are $\\mu=33.47\\pm 0.15$ for SN\n2004bd and $33.83\\pm 0.07$ for SN 2008ec. These results are used to obtain\nindependently the distance measurement calibration factor, $g$. The $g$ value\nobtained from the SN Ia discussed in this paper is $g_{\\rm SN} = 10.61\\pm 0.50$\nwhich matches, within the range of 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty, $g_{\\rm DUST} =\n10.60$, previously calculated ab initio in Yoshii et al. (2014). Having\nvalidated our new method for measuring extragalactic distances, we use our new\nmethod to calibrate reverberation distances derived from variations of H$\\beta$\nemission in the AGN broad line region (BLR), extending the Hubble diagram to\n$z\\approx 0.3$ where distinguishing between cosmologies is becoming possible.\n", "  In the field of fundamental plasma waves, direct observation of\nelectron-acoustic wave (EAW) propagation in laboratory plasmas remains a\nchallenging problem, mainly because of heavy damping. In the MaPLE device, the\nwave is observed and seen to propagate with phase velocity $\\sim1.8$ times the\nelectron thermal velocity. A small amount of cold, drifting electrons, with\nmoderate bulk to cold temperature ratio ($\\approx 2 - 3$), is present in the\ndevice. It plays a crucial role in reducing the damping. Our calculation\nreveals that the drift relaxes the stringent condition on the temperature ratio\nfor wave destabilization. Growth rate becomes positive above a certain drift\nvelocity even if the temperature ratio is moderate. The observed phase velocity\nagrees well with the theoretical estimate. Experimental realization of the mode\nmay open up a new avenue in EAW research.\n", "  The ill-posed analytic continuation problem for Green's functions or\nself-energies can be done using the Pad\\'e rational polynomial approximation.\nHowever, to extract accurate results from this approximation, high precision\ninput data of the Matsubara Green's function are needed. The calculation of the\nMatsubara Green's function generally involves a Matsubara frequency summation\nwhich cannot be evaluated analytically. Numerical summation is requisite but it\nconverges slowly with the increase of the Matsubara frequency. Here we show\nthat this slow convergence problem can be significantly improved by utilizing\nthe Pad\\'e decomposition approach to replace the Matsubara frequency summation\nby a Pad\\'e frequency summation, and high precision input data can be obtained\nto successfully perform the Pad\\'e analytic continuation.\n", "  An asymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is investigated in Py/Pt bilayers. The\nasymmetric MR linearly increases with current density up to a threshold, and\nincreases more rapidly above the threshold. To reveal the origin of threshold\nbehavior, we investigate the magnetic field dependence of the asymmetric MR. It\nis found that the magnetic field strongly suppresses the asymmetric MR only\nabove the threshold current density. Micromagnetic simulation reveals that the\nreduction of magnetization due to the spin-torque oscillation can be the origin\nof the threshold behavior of asymmetric MR.\n", "  Filamentary regions of high vorticity irregularly form and disappear in the\nturbulent flows of classical fluids. We report an experimental comparative\nstudy of these so-called \" coherent structures \" in a classical versus quantum\nfluid, using liquid helium with a superfluid fraction varied from 0% up to 83%.\nThe low pressure core of the vorticity filaments is detected by pressure probes\nlocated on the sidewall of a 78-cm-diameter Von K\\'arm\\'an cell driven up to\nrecord turbulent intensity (R $\\lambda$ $\\sim$ $\\sqrt$ Re 10000). The\nstatistics of occurrence, magnitude and relative distribution of the filaments\nin a classical fluid are found indistinguishable from their superfluid\ncounterpart, namely the bundles of quantized vortex lines. This suggest that\nthe internal structure of vortex filaments, as well as their dissipative\nproperties have a negligible impact on their macroscopic dynamics, such as\nlifetime and intermittent properties.\n", "  We investigate gas contents of star-forming galaxies associated with\nprotocluster 4C23.56 at z = 2.49 by using the redshifted CO(3-2) and 1.1 mm\ndust continuum with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The\nobservations unveil seven CO detections out of 22 targeted H$\\alpha$ emitters\n(HAEs) and four out of 19 in 1.1 mm dust continuum. They have high stellar mass\n($M_{\\star}>4\\times 10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$) and exhibit a specific star-formation\nrate typical of main-sequence star forming galaxies at $z\\sim2.5$. Different\ngas mass estimators from CO(3-2) and 1.1 mm yield consistent values for\nsimultaneous detections. The gas mass ($M_{\\rm gas}$) and gas fraction ($f_{\\rm\ngas}$) are comparable to those of field galaxies, with $M_{\\rm gas}=[0.3,\n1.8]\\times10^{11} \\times (\\alpha_{\\rm CO}/(4.36\\times A(Z)$)) M$_{\\odot}$,\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ is the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and $A(Z)$ the\nadditional correction factor for the metallicity dependence of $\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}$, and $\\langle f_{\\rm gas}\\rangle = 0.53 \\pm 0.07$ from CO(3-2). Our\nmeasurements place a constraint on the cosmic gas density of high-$z$\nprotoclusters, indicating the protocluster is characterized by a gas density\nhigher than that of the general fields by an order of magnitude. We found $\\rho\n(H_2)\\sim 5 \\times 10^9 \\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ with the CO(3-2)\ndetections. The five ALMA CO detections occur in the region of highest galaxy\nsurface density, where the density positively correlates with global\nstar-forming efficiency (SFE) and stellar mass. Such correlations imply a\npotentially critical role of environment on early galaxy evolution at high-z\nprotoclusters, although future observations are necessary for confirmation.\n", "  We present results derived from four stellar occultations by the plutino\nobject (208996) 2003~AZ$_{84}$, detected at January 8, 2011 (single-chord\nevent), February 3, 2012 (multi-chord), December 2, 2013 (single-chord) and\nNovember 15, 2014 (multi-chord). Our observations rule out an oblate spheroid\nsolution for 2003~AZ$_{84}$'s shape. Instead, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium,\nwe find that a Jacobi triaxial solution with semi axes $(470 \\pm 20) \\times\n(383 \\pm 10) \\times (245 \\pm 8)$~km % axis ratios $b/a= 0.82 \\pm 0.05$ and\n$c/a= 0.52 \\pm 0.02$, can better account for all our occultation observations.\nCombining these dimensions with the rotation period of the body (6.75~h) and\nthe amplitude of its rotation light curve, we derive a density $\\rho=0.87 \\pm\n0.01$~g~cm$^{-3}$ a geometric albedo $p_V= 0.097 \\pm 0.009$. A grazing chord\nobserved during the 2014 occultation reveals a topographic feature along\n2003~AZ$_{84}$'s limb, that can be interpreted as an abrupt chasm of width\n$\\sim 23$~km and depth $> 8$~km or a smooth depression of width $\\sim 80$~km\nand depth $\\sim 13$~km (or an intermediate feature between those two extremes).\n", "  We present the first near infra-red spectrum of the faint white dwarf\ncompanion HD 114174 B, obtained with Project 1640. Our spectrum, covering the\nY, J and H bands, combined with previous TRENDS photometry measurements, allows\nus to place further constraints on this companion. We suggest two possible\nscenarios; either this object is an old, low mass, cool H atmosphere white\ndwarf with Teff ~ 3800 K or a high mass white dwarf with Teff > 6000 K,\npotentially with an associated cool (Teff ~ 700 K) brown dwarf or debris disk\nresulting in an infra-red excess in the L band. We also provide an additional\nastrometry point for 2014 June 12 and use the modelled companion mass combined\nwith the RV and direct imaging data to place constraints on the orbital\nparameters for this companion.\n", "  We consider spin- and density-related properties of single-particle states in\na one-dimensional system with random spin-orbit coupling. We show that the\npresence of an additional Zeeman field $\\Delta$ induces both nonlinear spin\npolarization and delocalization of states localized at $\\Delta=0$,\ncorresponding to a random macroscopic analogue of the Paschen-Back effect.\nWhile the conventional Paschen-Back effect corresponds to a saturated\n$\\Delta-$dependence of the spin polarization, here the gradual suppression of\nthe spin-orbit coupling effects by the Zeeman field is responsible both for the\nspin saturation and delocalization of the particles.\n", "  Our knowledge of stellar evolution and of the structure and chemical\nevolution of the Galactic disk largely builds on the study of open star\nclusters. Because of their crucial role in these relevant topics, large\nhomogeneous catalogues of open cluster parameters are highly desirable.\nAlthough efforts have been made to develop automatic tools to analyse large\nnumbers of clusters, the results obtained so far vary from study to study, and\nsometimes are very contradictory when compared to dedicated studies of\nindividual clusters. In this work we highlight the common causes of these\ndiscrepancies for some open clusters, and show that at present dedicated\nstudies yield a much better assessment of the nature of star clusters, even in\nthe absence of ideal data-sets. We make use of deep, wide-field, multi-colour\nphotometry to discuss the nature of six strategically selected open star\nclusters: Trumpler~22, Lynga~6, Hogg~19, Hogg~21, Pismis~10 and Pismis~14. We\nhave precisely derived their basic parameters by means of a combination of star\ncounts and photometric diagrams. Trumpler~22 and Lynga~6 are included in our\nstudy because they are widely known, and thus provided a check of our data and\nmethodology. The remaining four clusters are very poorly known, and their\navailable parameters have been obtained using automatic tools only. Our results\nare in some cases in severe disagreement with those from automatic surveys.\n", "  A glitch of a pulsar is known as a sudden increase in the spin frequency and\nspin-down rate (frequency time derivative), and it can be caused by a sudden\nrel\\ ease of the stress built up in the solid crust of the star or pinned\nvortices in the superfluid interior. PSR J2021+4026 is the first pulsar that\nshows a significant change in the gamma-ray flux and pulse profile at the\nglitch that occurred around 2011 October 16. We report the results of timing\nand spectral analysis of PSR~J2021+4026 using $\\sim$ 8~yr Fermi-LAT data. We\nfind that the pulsar stayed at a high spin-down rate ($\\sim 4\\%$ higher than\nthe pre-glitch value) and a low gamma-ray state ($\\sim 18\\%$ lower) for about\n3~yr after the glitch. Around 2014 December, the spin-down rate and gamma-ray\nflux gradually returned to pre-glitch values within a time scale of a few\nmonths. The phase-resolved spectra and pulse profiles after the relaxation are\nalso consistent with those before the glitch. The observed long-term evolution\nof the spin-down rate and the gamma-ray flux indicates that the glitch\ntriggered a mode change in the global magnetosphere. We speculate that the\nglitch changed the local magnetic field structure around the polar cap and/or\nthe inclination angle of the dipole axis, leading to a change in the electric\ncurrent circulating in the magnetosphere.\n", "  Theories with large mass anomalous dimensions ($\\gamma_m$) have been\nextensively studied because of their deep consequences for models where the\nscalar bosons are composite. Large $\\gamma_m$ values may appear when a\nnon-Abelian gauge theory has a large number of fermions or is affected by\nfour-fermion interactions. In this note we provide a simple explanation how\n$\\gamma_m$ can be directly read out from the IR and UV boundary conditions\nderived from the gap equation, and verify that moderate $\\gamma_m$ values\nappear when the theory possess a large number of fermions, but large $\\gamma_m$\nvalues are obtained only when four-fermion interactions are added to the\ntheory. We also verify how the critical line separating the different chiral\nphases emerge from these conditions.\n", "  The star formation rate per unit area correlates well with the gas surface\ndensity for different types of galaxies. However, this Kennicutt-Schmidt law\nhas not yet been examined for a large, homogeneously selected sample of SMGs,\nwhich could provide useful SF implementation information for models of massive\ngalaxy formation and evolution. We aim at determining the K-S law parameters\nfor the first time for a well-selected, statistical sample of SMGs. We used\nALMA to conduct a 0.2\" resolution, 870 $\\mu$m imaging survey of 40 SMGs in\nCOSMOS, which were initially selected at 1.1 mm. We analysed a sample of 32/40\ntarget SMGs, for which our new ALMA 870 $\\mu$m data provide information about\nthe spatial extent of dust emission, and all of which have dust-obscured SFR\nand dust-based gas mass estimates available from our previous study. We divided\nour sample into equally large subsamples of main-sequence objects and\nstarbursts, and found their K-S relations to be of the form $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\n\\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm gas}^{0.81\\pm0.01}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} \\propto\n\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}^{0.84\\pm0.39}$, respectively. The slightly sub-linear K-S\nslopes we derived suggest that the SF efficiency is nearly constant across the\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ range probed. Under the assumption of a Galactic CO-to-H$_2$\nconversion factor for the whole sample, the MS SMGs obey a constant global SFE\nof about 21% per 100 Myr, while that of starburst SMGs is about 27%. The\ncorresponding gas depletion times are $\\sim480$ Myr and 370 Myr. On average,\nour SMGs have $\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}\\gtrsim10^{3.9}$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, which\nsuggests that they are Eddington-limited. This is consistent with the\ntheoretical expectation of a linear K-S relation for such systems. However,\nsize measurements of the CO-emitting regions of SMGs, and the $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$\nvalues of SMGs are needed to further constrain their $\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ values.\n", "  Magnetic field extrapolation is an important tool to study the\nthree-dimensional (3D) solar coronal magnetic field which is difficult to\ndirectly measure. Various analytic models and numerical codes exist but their\nresults often drastically differ. Thus a critical comparison of the modeled\nmagnetic field lines with the observed coronal loops is strongly required to\nestablish the credibility of the model. Here we compare two different\nnon-potential extrapolation codes, a non-linear force-free field code\n(CESE-MHD-NLFFF) and a non-force-free field (NFFF) code in modeling a solar\nactive region (AR) that has a sigmoidal configuration just before a major flare\nerupted from the region. A 2D coronal-loop tracing and fitting method is\nemployed to study the 3D misalignment angles between the extrapolated magnetic\nfield lines and the EUV loops as imaged by SDO/AIA. It is found that the\nCESE-MHD-NLFFF code with preprocessed magnetogram performs the best, outputting\na field which matches the coronal loops in the AR core imaged in AIA 94 {\\AA}\nwith a misalignment angle of ~10 degree. This suggests that the CESE-MHD-NLFFF\ncode, even without using the information of coronal loops in constraining the\nmagnetic field, performs as good as some coronal-loop forward-fitting models.\nFor the loops as imaged by AIA 171 {\\AA} in the outskirts of the AR, all the\ncodes including the potential-field give comparable results of mean\nmisalignment angle (~30 degree). Thus further improvement of the codes is\nneeded for a better reconstruction of the long loops enveloping the core\nregion.\n", "  Observations of multi-wavelength and therefore height-dependent information\nfollowing events throughout the solar atmosphere and unambiguously assigning a\nrelation between these rapidly evolving layers are rare and difficult to\nobtain. Yet, they are crucial for our understanding of the physical processes\nthat couple the different regimes in the solar atmosphere. We characterize the\nexploding granule event with simultaneous observations of Hinode\nspectroplarimetric data in the solar photosphere and Hinode broadband CaIIH\nimages combined with Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) slit spectra.\nWe follow the evolution of an exploding granule and its connectivity throughout\nthe atmosphere and analyze the dynamics of a magnetic element that has been\naffected by the abnormal granule. In addition to magnetic flux maps we use a\nlocal correlation tracking method to infer the horizontal velocity flows in the\nphotosphere and apply a wavelet analysis on several IRIS chromospheric emission\nfeatures such as MgIIk2v and MgIIk3 to detect oscillatory phenomena indicating\nwave propagation. During the vigorous expansion of the abnormal granule we\ndetect radially outward horizontal flows, causing, together with the horizontal\nflows from the surrounding granules, the magnetic elements in the bordering\nintergranular lanes to be squeezed and elongated. In reaction to the squeezing,\nwe detect a chromospheric intensity and velocity oscillation pulse which we\nidentify as an upward traveling hot shock front propagating clearly through the\nIRIS spectral line diagnostics of MgIIh&k. Conclusion: Exploding granules can\ntrigger upward-propagating shock fronts that dissipate in the chromosphere.\n", "  Thermonuclear flashes of hydrogen and helium accreted onto neutron stars\nproduce the frequently observed Type I X-ray bursts. It is the current paradigm\nthat almost all material burns in a burst, after which it takes hours to\naccumulate fresh fuel for the next burst. In rare cases, however, bursts are\nobserved with recurrence times as short as minutes. We present the first\none-dimensional multi-zone simulations that reproduce this phenomenon. Bursts\nthat ignite in a relatively hot neutron star envelope leave a substantial\nfraction of the fuel unburned at shallow depths. In the wake of the burst,\nconvective mixing events driven by opacity bring this fuel down to the ignition\ndepth on the observed timescale of minutes. There, unburned hydrogen mixes with\nthe metal-rich ashes, igniting to produce a subsequent burst. We find burst\npairs and triplets, similar to the observed instances. Our simulations\nreproduce the observed fraction of bursts with short waiting times of ~30%, and\ndemonstrate that short recurrence time bursts are typically less bright and of\nshorter duration.\n", "  Quasar redshifts require the best possible precision and accuracy for a\nnumber of applications, such as setting the velocity scale for outflows as well\nas measuring small-scale quasar-quasar clustering. The most reliable redshift\nstandard in luminous quasars is arguably the narrow [OIII]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007 emission line doublet in the rest-frame optical. We\nuse previously published [OIII] redshifts obtained using near-infrared spectra\nin a sample of 45 high-redshift (z > 2.2) quasars to evaluate redshift\nmeasurement techniques based on rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. At redshifts\nabove z = 2.2 the MgII $\\lambda$2798 emission line is not available in\nobserved-frame optical spectra, and the most prominent unblended and unabsorbed\nspectral feature available is usually CIV $\\lambda$1549. Peak and centroid\nmeasurements of the CIV profile are often blueshifted relative to the\nrest-frame of the quasar, which can significantly bias redshift determinations.\nWe show that redshift determinations for these high-redshift quasars are\nsignificantly correlated with the emission-line properties of CIV (i.e., the\nequivalent width, or EW, and the full width at half maximum, or FWHM) as well\nas the luminosity, which we take from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release\n7. We demonstrate that empirical corrections based on multiple regression\nanalyses yield significant improvements in both the precision and accuracy of\nthe redshifts of the most distant quasars and are required to establish\nconsistency with redshifts determined in more local quasars.\n", "  The origin of the extended X-ray emission in the large-scale jets of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) poses challenges to conventional models of acceleration\nand emission. Although the electron synchrotron radiation is considered the\nmost feasible radiation mechanism, the formation of the continuous large-scale\nX-ray structure remains an open issue. As astrophysical jets are expected to\nexhibit some turbulence and shearing motion, we here investigate the potential\nof shearing flows to facilitate an extended acceleration of particles and\nevaluate its impact on the resultant particle distribution. Our treatment\nincorporates systematic shear and stochastic second-order Fermi effects. We\nshow that for typical parameters applicable to large-scale AGN jets, stochastic\nsecond-order Fermi acceleration, which always accompanies shear particle\nacceleration, can play an important role in facilitating the whole process of\nparticle energization. We study the time-dependent evolution of the resultant\nparticle distribution in the presence of second-order Fermi acceleration, shear\nacceleration, and synchrotron losses using a simple Fokker--Planck approach and\nprovide illustrations for the possible emergence of a complex (multicomponent)\nparticle energy distribution with different spectral branches. We present\nexamples for typical parameters applicable to large-scale AGN jets, indicating\nthe relevance of the underlying processes for understanding the extended X-ray\nemission and the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.\n", "  This paper presents the use of a novel modelling technique based around\nintermittent transport due to filament motion, to interpret experimental\nprofile and fluctuation data in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of JET during the\nonset and evolution of a density profile shoulder. A baseline case is\nestablished, prior to shoulder formation, and the stochastic model is shown to\nbe capable of simultaneously matching the time averaged profile measurement as\nwell as the PDF shape and autocorrelation function from the ion-saturation\ncurrent time series at the outer wall. Aspects of the stochastic model are then\nvaried with the aim of producing a profile shoulder with statistical\nmeasurements consistent with experiment. This is achieved through a strong\nlocalised reduction in the density sink acting on the filaments within the\nmodel. The required reduction of the density sink occurs over a highly\nlocalised region with the timescale of the density sink increased by a factor\nof 25. This alone is found to be insufficient to model the expansion and\nflattening of the shoulder region as the density increases, which requires\nadditional changes within the stochastic model. An example is found which\nincludes both a reduction in the density sink and filament acceleration and\nprovides a consistent match to the experimental data as the shoulder expands,\nthough the uniqueness of this solution can not be guaranteed. Within the\ncontext of the stochastic model, this implies that the localised reduction in\nthe density sink can trigger shoulder formation, but additional physics is\nrequired to explain the subsequent evolution of the profile.\n", "  We report the intriguing large-scale dynamic phenomena associated with the\nM6.5 flare~(SOL2015-06-22T18:23) in NOAA active region 12371, observed by\nRHESSI, Fermi, and the Atmospheric Image Assembly (AIA) and Magnetic Imager\n(HMI) on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The most interesting feature of\nthis event is a third ribbon (R3) arising in the decay phase, propagating along\na dimming channel (seen in EUV passbands) towards a neighboring sunspot. The\npropagation of R3 occurs in the presence of hard X-ray footpoint emission, and\nis broadly visible at temperatures from 0.6~MK to over 10~MK through the\nDifferential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis. The coronal loops then undergo an\napparent slipping motion following the same path of R3, after a $\\sim$ 80~min\ndelay. To understand the underlying physics, we investigate the magnetic\nconfiguration and the thermal structure of the flaring region. Our results are\nin favor of a slipping-type reconnection followed by the thermodynamic\nevolution of coronal loops. In comparison with those previously reported\nslipping reconnection events, this one proceeds across a particularly long\ndistance ($\\sim$60 Mm) over a long period of time ($\\sim$50 min), and shows two\nclearly distinguished phases: the propagation of the footpoint brightening\ndriven by nonthermal particle injection and the apparent slippage of loops\ngoverned by plasma heating and subsequent cooling.\n", "  Combining dynamical models of dust from Jupiter Family Comets and Halley-type\nComets, we demonstrate that the seasonal variation of the dust/meteoroid\nenvironment at Mercury is responsible for producing the dawn-dusk asymmetry in\nMercury's exosphere observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft. Our latest models,\ncalibrated recently from ground-based and space-borne measurements, provide\nunprecedented statistics that enable us to study the longitudinal and\nlatitudinal distribution of meteoroids impacting Mercury's surface. We predict\nthat the micrometeoroid impact vaporization source is expected to undergo\nsignificant motion on Mercury's surface towards the nightside during Mercury's\napproach to aphelion and towards the dayside when the planet is approaching the\nSun.\n", "  In this paper we gauge the potentiality of Gaia in the distance scale\ncalibration of planetary nebulae (PNe) by assessing the impact of DR1\nparallaxes of central stars of Galactic PNe (CSPNe) against known physical\nrelations. For selected PNe targets with state-of-the-art data on angular sizes\nand fluxes, we derive the distance-dependent parameters of the classical\ndistance scales, i.e., physical radii and ionized masses, from DR1 parallaxes;\nwe propagate the uncertainties in the estimated quantities and evaluate their\nstatistical properties in the presence of large relative parallax errors; we\npopulate the statistical distance scale diagrams with this sample and discuss\nits significance in light of existing data and current calibrations.\n  We glean from DR1 parallaxes 8 CSPNe with S/N$>$1. We show that this set of\npotential calibrators doubles the number of extant trigonometric parallaxes\n(from HST and ground-based), and increases by two orders of magnitude the\ndomain of physical parameters probed previously. We then use the combined\nsample of suitable trigonometric parallaxes to fit the\nphysical-radius-to-surface-brightness relation. This distance scale\ncalibration, although preliminary, appears solid on statistical grounds, and\nsuggestive of new PNe physics.\n  With the tenfold improvement in PNe number statistics and astrometric\naccuracy expected from future Gaia releases the new distance scale, already\nvery intriguing, will be definitively constrained.\n", "  A unified description of early-time inflation with the current cosmic\nacceleration is achieved by means of a new theory that uses a quadratic model\nof gravity, with the inclusion of an exponential $F(R)$-gravity contribution\nfor dark energy. High-curvature corrections of the theory come from\nhigher-derivative quantum gravity and yield an effective action that goes\nbeyond the one-loop approximation. It is shown that, in this theory, viable\ninflation emerges in a natural way, leading to a spectral index and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio that are in perfect agreement with the most reliable\nPlanck results. At low energy, late-time accelerated expansion takes place. As\nexponential gravity, for dark energy, must be stabilized during the matter and\nradiation eras, we introduce a curing term in order to avoid nonphysical\nsingularities in the effective equation of state parameter. The results of our\nanalysis are confirmed by accurate numerical simulations, which show that our\nmodel does fit the most recent cosmological data for dark energy very\nprecisely.\n", "  The faster light-curve evolution of low-luminosity Type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) suggests that they could result from the explosion of white dwarf (WD)\nprogenitors below the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$). Here we present 1D\nnon-LTE time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of pure central\ndetonations of carbon-oxygen WDs with a mass ($M_\\rm{tot}$) between 0.88\nM$_{\\odot}$ and 1.15 M$_{\\odot}$, and a $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ yield between 0.08\nM$_{\\odot}$ and 0.84 M$_{\\odot}$. Their lower ejecta density compared to\n$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models results in a more rapid increase of the luminosity at early\ntimes and an enhanced $\\gamma$-ray escape fraction past maximum light.\nConsequently, their bolometric light curves display shorter rise times and\nlarger post-maximum decline rates. Moreover, the higher\n$M(^{56}\\rm{Ni})/M_\\rm{tot}$ ratio at a given $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ mass enhances the\ntemperature and ionization level in the spectrum-formation region for the less\nluminous models, giving rise to bluer colours at maximum light and a faster\npost-maximum evolution of the $B-V$ colour. For sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models fainter\nthan $M_B\\approx -18.5$ mag at peak, the greater bolometric decline and faster\ncolour evolution lead to a larger $B$-band post-maximum decline rate, $\\Delta\nM_{15}(B)$. In particular, all of our previously-published $M_{\\rm Ch}$ models\n(standard and pulsational delayed detonations) are confined to $\\Delta\nM_{15}(B) < 1.4$ mag, while the sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models with\n$M_\\rm{tot}\\lesssim 1$ M$_{\\odot}$ extend beyond this limit to $\\Delta\nM_{15}(B)\\approx 1.65$ mag for a peak $M_B\\approx -17$ mag, in better agreement\nwith the observed width-luminosity relation (WLR). Regardless of the precise\nignition mechanism, these simulations suggest that fast-declining SNe Ia at the\nfaint end of the WLR could result from the explosion of WDs whose mass is\nsignificantly below the Chandrasekhar limit.\n", "  The surface rotations of some red giants are so fast that they must have been\nspun up by tidal interaction with a close companion, either another star, a\nbrown dwarf, or a planet. We focus here on the case of red giants that are spun\nup by tidal interaction with a planet. When the distance between the planet and\nthe star decreases, the spin period of the star decreases, the orbital period\nof the planet decreases, and the reflex motion of the star increases. We study\nthe change rate of these three quantities when the circular orbit of a planet\nof 15 M$_{J}$ that initially orbits a 2 M$_\\odot$ star at 1 au shrinks under\nthe action of tidal forces during the red giant phase. We use stellar evolution\nmodels coupled with computations of the orbital evolution of the planet, which\nallows us to follow the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the\norbit in a consistent way. We obtain that the reflex motion of the red giant\nstar increases by more than 1 m s$^{-1}$ per year in the last $\\sim$40 years\nbefore the planet engulfment. During this phase, the reflex motion of the star\nis between 660 and 710 m s$^{-1}$. The spin period of the star increases by\nmore than about 10 minutes per year in the last 3000 y before engulfment.\nDuring this period, the spin period of the star is shorter than 0.7 year.\nDuring this same period, the variation in orbital period, which is shorter than\n0.18 year, is on the same order of magnitude. Changes in reflex-motion and spin\nvelocities are very small and thus most likely out of reach of being observed.\nThe most promising way of detecting this effect is through observations of\ntransiting planets, that is, through{\\it } changes of the beginning or end of\nthe transit. A space mission like PLATO might be of great interest for\ndetecting planets that are on the verge of being engulfed by red giants.\n", "  Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have recently been investigated\nfor their potential to kill cancer cells with promising results, owing to their\nability to be targeted and heated by magnetic fields. In this study, novel\nhydrogel, chitosan Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized to induce\nmagnetic hyperthermia, and targeted delivering of chemotherapeutics in the\ncancer microenvironment. The characteristic properties of synthesized bare and\nCS-MNPs were analyzed by various analytical methods: X-ray diffraction, Fourier\ntransformed infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and\nThermo-gravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis. Magnetic\nnanoparticles were successfully synthesized using the co-precipitation method.\nThis synthesis technique resulted in nanoparticles with an average particle\nsize of 16 nm. The pure obtained nanoparticles were then successfully\nencapsulated with 4-nm-thick chitosan coating. The formation of chitosan on the\nsurface of nanoparticles was confirmed by physicochemical analyses. Heating\nexperiments at safe magnetic field (f = 100 kHz, H =10-20 kA m-1) revealed that\nthe maximum achieved temperature of water stable chitosan-coated nanoparticles\n(50 mg ml-1) is fully in agreement with cancer therapy and biomedical\napplications.\n", "  We present the results of a deep Chandra observation of the X-ray bright,\nmoderate cooling flow group NGC 5044 along with the observed correlations\nbetween the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas in this system. The Chandra\nobservation shows that the central AGN has undergone two outbursts in the past\n100 Myrs, based on the presence of two pairs of nearly bipolar X-ray cavities.\nThe molecular gas and dust within the central 2kpc is aligned with the\norientation of the inner pair of bipolar X-ray cavities, suggesting that the\nmost recent AGN outburst had a dynamical impact on the molecular gas. NGC 5044\nalso hosts many X-ray filaments within the central 8kpc, but there are no\nobvious connections between the X-ray and H$\\alpha$ filaments and the more\nextended X-ray cavities that were inflated during the prior AGN outburst. Using\nthe linewidth of the blended Fe-L line complex as a diagnostic for multiphase\ngas, we find that the majority of the multiphase, thermally unstable gas in NGC\n5044 is confined within the X-ray filaments. While the cooling time and entropy\nof the gas within the X-ray filaments are very similar, not all filaments show\nevidence of gas cooling or an association with Ha emission. We suggest that the\nvarious observed properties of the X-ray filaments are suggestive of an\nevolutionary sequence where thermally unstable gas begins to cool, becomes\nmultiphased, develops Ha emitting plasma, and finally produces cold gas.\n", "  We report the discovery of a synchrotron nebula, G283.1-0.59, associated with\nPSR J1015-5719. Radio observations using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis\nTelescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 36, 16, 6, and 3 cm\nreveal a complex morphology. The pulsar is embedded in the \"head\" of the nebula\nwith fan-shaped diffuse emission. This is connected to a circular bubble of 20\"\nradius and a collimated tail extending over 1'. Polarization measurements show\na highly ordered magnetic field in the nebula. It wraps around the edge of the\nhead and shows an azimuthal configuration near the pulsar, then switches\ndirection quasi-periodically near the bubble and in the tail. Together with the\nflat radio spectrum observed, we suggest that this system is most plausibly a\npulsar wind nebula (PWN), with the head as a bow shock that has a low Mach\nnumber and the bubble as a shell expanding in a dense environment. The bubble\ncould act as a magnetic bottle trapping the relativistic particles. A\ncomparison with other bow-shock PWNe with higher Mach numbers shows similar\nstructure and B-field geometry, implying that pulsar velocity may not be the\nmost critical factor in determining the properties of these systems.\n  We also derive analytic expressions for the projected standoff distance and\nshape of an inclined bow shock. It is found that the projected distance is\nalways larger than the true distance in three dimensions. On the other hand,\nthe projected shape is not sensitive to the inclination after rescaling with\nthe projected standoff distance.\n", "  We present the results from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) imaging in the [NII] 205 micron fine-structure line (hereafter [NII])\nand the underlying continuum of BRI 1202-0725, an interacting galaxy system at\n$z =$ 4.7, consisting of an optical QSO, a sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) and two\nLyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs), all within $\\sim$25 kpc of the QSO. We detect\nthe QSO and SMG in both [NII] and continuum. At the $\\sim$$1\"$ (or 6.6 kpc)\nresolution, both QSO and SMG are resolved in [NII], with the de-convolved major\naxes of $\\sim$9 and $\\sim$14 kpc, respectively. In contrast, their continuum\nemissions are much more compact and unresolved even at an enhanced resolution\nof $\\sim$$0.7\"$. The ratio of the [NII] flux to the existing CO (7$-$6) flux is\nused to constrain the dust temperature ($T_{\\rm dust}$) for a more accurate\ndetermination of the FIR luminosity $L_{\\rm FIR}$. Our best estimated $T_{\\rm\ndust}$ equals $43 (\\pm 2)$ K for both galaxies (assuming an emissivity index\n$\\beta = 1.8$). The resulting $L_{\\rm CO(7-6)}/L_{\\rm FIR}$ ratios are\nstatistically consistent with that of local luminous infrared galaxies,\nconfirming that $L_{\\rm CO(7-6)}$ traces the star formation (SF) rate (SFR) in\nthese galaxies. We estimate that the on-going SF of the QSO (SMG) has a SFR of\n5.1 $(6.9) \\times 10^3 M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($\\pm$ 30%) assuming Chabrier\ninitial mass function, takes place within a diameter (at half maximum) of 1.3\n(1.5) kpc, and shall consume the existing 5 $(5) \\times 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ of\nmolecular gas in 10 $(7) \\times 10^7$ years.\n", "  In this report we present experimental investigations of THz radiation\ngenerated from a corrugated and a non-corrugated capillary with reflectors,\nusing a femtosecond electron beam of LUCX accelerator at KEK, Japan. We discuss\nmeasurements of radiation angular distributions and their comparison with\nParticle In Cell simulations, and also investigate an off-central propagation\nof the beam in the capillaries based on experimental measurements and\nsimulations.\n", "  We studied the background field for 60 two-ribbon flares of M-and-above\nclasses during 2011--2015. These flares are categorized into two groups, i.e.,\n\\emph{eruptive} and \\emph{confined} flares, based on whether a flare is\nassociated with a coronal mass ejection or not. The background field of source\nactive regions is approximated by a potential field extrapolated from the $B_z$\ncomponent of vector magnetograms provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager. We calculated the decay index $n$ of the background field above the\nflaring polarity inversion line, and defined a critical height\n$h_\\mathrm{crit}$ corresponding to the theoretical threshold\n($n_\\mathrm{crit}=1.5$) of the torus instability. We found that\n$h_\\mathrm{crit}$ is approximately half of the distance between the centroids\nof opposite polarities in active regions, and that the distribution of\n$h_\\mathrm{crit}$ is bimodal: it is significantly higher for confined flares\nthan for eruptive ones. The decay index increases monotonously with increasing\nheight for 86\\% (84\\%) of the eruptive (confined) flares but displays a\nsaddle-like profile for the rest 14\\% (16\\%), which are found exclusively in\nactive regions of multipolar field configuration. Moreover, $n$ at the saddle\nbottom is significantly smaller in confined flares than that in eruptive ones.\nThese results highlight the critical role of background field in regulating the\neruptive behavior of two-ribbon flares.\n", "  A graphene sheet partially covered with a bulk superconductor serves as a\nnormal conductor--superconductor (NS) junction, in which electron transport is\nmainly governed by Andreev reflection (AR). As excess carriers induced over the\ncovered region penetrate into the uncovered region over a screening length, the\ncharge neutrality point (CNP) in the uncovered region shifts only near the NS\ninterface. We theoretically study the electron transport in a bilayer graphene\njunction taking account of such spatial variation of the CNP in the\nelectron-doped case. When the Fermi level is close to the CNP away from the NS\ninterface, the AR takes place in a specular manner owing to the diffraction of\na reflected hole occurring at a $pn$ junction, which is naturally formed in the\nuncovered region. It is shown that the differential conductance shows an\nunusual asymmetric behavior as a function of bias voltage under the influence\nof the $pn$ junction. It is also shown that, if the Fermi level is located\nbelow the CNP, the $pn$ junction gives rise to quasi-bound states near the NS\ninterface, leading to the appearance of resonant peaks in the differential\nconductance.\n", "  The region 1273-1290 cm$^{-1}$ of the $\\nu$4 fundamental of the simplest\nCriegee intermediate, CH$_2$OO, has been measured using a quantum cascade laser\ntransient absorption spectrometer, which offers greater sensitivity and\nspectral resolution (< 0.004 cm$^{-1}$) than previous works based on thermal\nlight sources. Gas phase CH$_2$OO was generated from the reaction of CH$_2$I +\nO2 at 298 K and 4 Torr. Analysis of the absorption spectrum has provided\nprecise values for the vibrational frequency and the rotational constants, with\nfitting errors of a few MHz. The determined ratios of the rotational constants,\nA'/A\" = 0.9986, B'/B\" = 0.9974 and C'/C\" = 1.0010, and the relative intensities\nof the a- and b-type transitions, 90:10, are in good agreement with literature\nvalues from a theoretical calculation using the MULTIMODE approach, based on a\nhigh-level ab initio potential energy surface. The low-K (= Ka) lines can be\nfitted extremely well, but rotational perturbations by other vibrational modes\ndisrupt the structure for K = 4 and K $\\geq$ 6. Not only the spectral\nresolution but also the detection sensitivity of CH$_2$OO IR transitions has\nbeen greatly improved in this work, allowing for unambiguous monitoring of\nCH$_2$OO in kinetic studies at low concentrations.\n", "  The oscillatory flow around a spherical object lying on a rough bottom is\ninvestigated by means of direct numerical simulations of continuity and\nNavier-Stokes equations. The rough bottom is simulated by a layer/multiple\nlayers of spherical particles, the size of which is much smaller that the size\nof the object. The period and amplitude of the velocity oscillations of the\nfree stream are chosen to mimic the flow at the bottom of sea waves and the\nsize of the small spherical particles falls in the range of coarse sand/very\nfine gravel. Even though the computational costs allow only the simulation of\nmoderate values of the Reynolds number characterizing the bottom boundary\nlayer, the results show that the coherent vortex structures, shed by the\nspherical object, can break-up and generate turbulence, if the Reynolds number\nof the object is sufficiently large. The knowledge of the velocity field allows\nthe dynamics of the large scale coherent vortices shed by the object to be\ndetermined and turbulence characteristics to be evaluated. Moreover, the forces\nand torques acting on both the large spherical object and the small particles,\nsimulating sediment grains, can be determined and analysed, thus laying the\ngroundwork for the investigation of sediment dynamics and scour developments.\n", "  The XENON1T experiment is the most recent stage of the XENON Dark Matter\nSearch, aiming for the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles\n(WIMPs). To reach its projected sensitivity, the background has to be reduced\nby two orders of magnitude compared to its predecessor XENON100. This requires\na water Cherenkov muon veto surrounding the XENON1T TPC, both to shield\nexternal backgrounds and to tag muon-induced energetic neutrons through\ndetection of a passing muon or the secondary shower induced by a muon\ninteracting in the surrounding rock. The muon veto is instrumented with $84$\n$8\"$ PMTs with high quantum efficiency (QE) in the Cherenkov regime and the\nwalls of the watertank are clad with the highly reflective DF2000MA foil by 3M.\nHere, we present a study of the reflective properties of this foil, as well as\nthe measurement of its wavelength shifting (WLS) properties. Further, we\npresent the impact of reflectance and WLS on the detection efficiency of the\nmuon veto, using a Monte Carlo simulation carried out with Geant4. The\nmeasurements yield a specular reflectance of $\\approx100\\%$ for wavelengths\nlarger than $400\\,$nm, while $\\approx90\\%$ of the incoming light below\n$370\\,$nm is absorbed by the foil. Approximately $3-7.5\\%$ of the light hitting\nthe foil within the wavelength range $250\\,$nm $\\leq \\lambda \\leq 390\\,$nm is\nused for the WLS process. The intensity of the emission spectrum of the WLS\nlight is slightly dependent on the absorbed wavelength and shows the shape of a\nrotational-vibrational fluorescence spectrum, peaking at around $\\lambda\n\\approx 420\\,$nm. Adjusting the reflectance values to the measured ones in the\nMonte Carlo simulation originally used for the muon veto design, the veto\ndetection efficiency remains unchanged. Including the wavelength shifting in\nthe Monte Carlo simulation leads to an increase of the efficiency of\napproximately $0.5\\%$.\n", "  We report ALMA observations of polarized dust emission from the protostellar\nsource Ser-emb 8 at a linear resolution of 140 au. Assuming models of\ndust-grain alignment hold, the observed polarization pattern gives a projected\nview of the magnetic field structure in this source. Contrary to expectations\nbased on models of strongly magnetized star formation, the magnetic field in\nSer-emb 8 does not exhibit an hourglass morphology. Combining the new ALMA data\nwith previous observational studies, we can connect magnetic field structure\nfrom protostellar core (~80,000 au) to disk (~100 au) scales. We compare our\nobservations with four magnetohydrodynamic gravo-turbulence simulations made\nwith the AREPO code that have initial conditions ranging from super-Alfv\\'enic\n(weakly magnetized) to sub-Alfv\\'enic (strongly magnetized). These simulations\nachieve the spatial dynamic range necessary to resolve the collapse of\nprotostars from the parsec scale of star-forming clouds down to the ~100 au\nscale probed by ALMA. Only in the very strongly magnetized simulation do we see\nboth the preservation of the field direction from cloud to disk scales and an\nhourglass-shaped field at < 1000 au scales. We conduct an analysis of the\nrelative orientation of the magnetic field and the density structure in both\nthe Ser-emb 8 ALMA observations and the synthetic observations of the four\nAREPO simulations. We conclude that the Ser-emb 8 data are most similar to the\nweakly magnetized simulations, which exhibit random alignment, in contrast to\nthe strongly magnetized simulation, where the magnetic field plays a role in\nshaping the density structure in the source. In the weak-field case, it is\nturbulence -- not the magnetic field -- that shapes the material that forms the\nprotostar, highlighting the dominant role that turbulence can play across many\norders of magnitude in spatial scale.\n", "  We report new observations of the active asteroid P/2010 A2 taken when it\nmade its closest approach to the Earth (1.06 au in 2017 January) after its\nfirst discovery in 2010. Despite a crucial role of the rotational period in\nclarifying its ejection mechanism, the rotational property of P/2010 A2 has not\nyet been studied due to the extreme faintness of this tiny object ($\\sim$120 m\nin diameter). Taking advantage of the best observing geometry since the\ndiscovery, we succeed in obtaining the rotational light curve of the largest\nfragment with Gemini/GMOS-N. We find that (1) the largest fragment has a\ndouble-peaked period of $11.36\\pm0.02$ hr spinning much slower than its\ncritical spin period; (2) the largest fragment is a highly elongated object\n($a/b\\geqslant 1.94$) with an effective radius of $61.9^{+16.8}_{-9.2}$ m; (3)\nthe size distribution of the ejecta follows a broken power law (the power\nindices of the cumulative size distributions of the dust and fragments are\n$2.5\\pm0.1$ and $5.2\\pm0.1$, respectively); (4) the mass ratio of the largest\nfragment to the total ejecta is around 0.8; and (5) the dust cloud morphology\nis in agreement with the anisotropic ejection model in Kim et al. (2017). These\nnew characteristics of the ejecta obtained in this work are favorable to the\nimpact shattering hypothesis.\n", "  The LHCb Collaboration has recently measured the difference of\ntime-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in $D^{0}\\rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}$ and\n$D^{0}\\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ decays, more precisely. The reported value is\n$ \\Delta A_{CP}=-0.10 \\pm 0.08 (\\text{stat}) \\pm 0.03 (\\text{syst})\\% $ which\nindicates no evidence for $CP$ violation. We consider the possible unparticle\nphysics contribution in this quantity and by using the LCHb data try to\nconstrain the parameter space of unparticle stuff.\n", "  Birhythmicity occurs in many natural and artificial systems. In this paper we\npropose a self-feedback scheme to control birhythmicity. To establish the\nefficacy and generality of the proposed control scheme, we apply it on three\nbirhythmic oscillators from diverse fields of natural science, namely, an\nenergy harvesting system, the p53-Mdm2 network for protein genesis (the OAK\nmodel) and a glycolysis model (modified Decroly-Goldbeter model). Using the\nharmonic decomposition technique and energy balance method we derive the\nanalytical conditions for the control of birhythmicity. A detailed numerical\nbifurcation analysis in the parameter space establishes that the control scheme\nis capable of eliminating birhythmicity and it can also induce transitions\nbetween different forms of bistability. As the proposed control scheme is quite\ngeneral, it can be applied for control of several real systems, particularly in\nbiochemical and engineering systems.\n", "  We investigate how leaders emerge as a consequence of the competitive\ndynamics between coupled papers in a model citation network. Every paper is\nallocated an initial fitness depending on its intrinsic quality. Its fitness\nthen evolves dynamically as a consequence of the competition between itself and\nall the other papers in the field. It picks up citations as a result of this\nadaptive dynamics, becoming a leader if it has the highest citation count at a\ngiven time. Extensive analytical and numerical investigations of this model\nsuggest the existence of a universal phase diagram, divided into regions of\nweak and strong coupling. In the former, we find an `extended' and rather\nstructureless distribution of citation counts among many fit papers; leaders\nare not necessarily those with the maximal fitness at any given time. By\ncontrast, the strong-coupling region is characterised by a strongly\nhierarchical distribution of citation counts, that are `localised' among only a\nfew extremely fit papers, and exhibit strong history-to-history fluctuations,\nas a result of the complex dynamics among papers in the tail of the fitness\ndistribution.\n", "  Phase mixing of standing continuum Alfv\\'en waves and/or continuum slow waves\nin atmospheric magnetic structures such as coronal arcades can create the\napparent effect of a wave propagating across the magnetic field. We observe a\nprominence with SDO/AIA on 2015 March 15 and find the presence of oscillatory\nmotion. We aim to demonstrate that interpreting this motion as a magneto\nhydrodynamic (MHD) wave is faulty. We also connect the decrease of the apparent\nvelocity over time with the phase mixing process, which depends on the\ncurvature of the magnetic field lines. By measuring the displacement of the\nprominence at different heights to calculate the apparent velocity, we show\nthat the propagation slows down over time, in accordance with the theoretical\nwork of Kaneko et al. We also show that this propagation speed drops below what\nis to be expected for even slow MHD waves for those circumstances. We use a\nmodified Kippenhahn-Schl\\\"uter prominence model to calculate the curvature of\nthe magnetic field and fit our observations accordingly. Measuring three of the\napparent waves, we get apparent velocities of 14, 8, and 4 km/s. Fitting a\nsimple model for the magnetic field configuration, we obtain that the filament\nis located 103 Mm below the magnetic centre. We also obtain that the scale of\nthe magnetic field strength in the vertical direction plays no role in the\nconcept of apparent superslow waves and that the moment of excitation of the\nwaves happened roughly one oscillation period before the end of the eruption\nthat excited the oscillation. Some of the observed phase velocities are lower\nthan expected for slow modes for the circumstances, showing that they rather\nfit with the concept of apparent superslow propagation. A fit with our magnetic\nfield model allows for inferring the magnetic geometry of the prominence.\n", "  Gas metallicity is a key quantity used to determine the physical conditions\nof gaseous clouds in a wide range of astronomical environments, including\ninterstellar and intergalactic space. In particular, considerable effort in\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) studies focuses on metallicity measurements,\nbecause gas metallicity serves as a critical discriminator for whether the\nobserved heavy ions in the CGM originate in chemically-enriched outflows or in\nmore chemically-pristine gas accreted from the intergalactic medium. However,\nbecause the gas is ionized, a necessary first step in determining CGM\nmetallicity is to constrain the ionization state of the gas which, in addition\nto gas density, depends on the ultraviolet background radiation field (UVB).\nWhile it is generally acknowledged that both the intensity and spectral slope\nof the UVB are uncertain, the impact of an uncertain spectral slope has not\nbeen properly addressed in the literature. This Letter shows that adopting a\ndifferent spectral slope can result in an order of magnitude difference in the\ninferred CGM metallicity. Specifically, a harder UVB spectrum leads to a higher\nestimated gas metallicity for a given set of observed ionic column densities .\nTherefore, such systematic uncertainties must be folded into the error budget\nfor metallicity estimates of ionized gas. An initial study shows that empirical\ndiagnostics are available for discriminating between hard and soft ionizing\nspectra. Applying these diagnostics helps reduce the systematic uncertainties\nin CGM metallicity estimates.\n", "  Most massive stars end their lives in core-collapse supernova explosions and\nenrich the interstellar medium with explosively nucleosynthesized elements.\nFollowing core collapse, the explosion is subject to instabilities as the shock\npropagates outwards through the progenitor star. Observations of the\ncomposition and structure of the innermost regions of a core-collapse supernova\nprovide a direct probe of the instabilities and nucleosynthetic products. SN\n1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is one of very few supernovae for\nwhich the inner ejecta can be spatially resolved but are not yet strongly\naffected by interaction with the surroundings. Our observations of SN 1987A\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are of the highest\nresolution to date and reveal the detailed morphology of cold molecular gas in\nthe innermost regions of the remnant. The 3D distributions of carbon and\nsilicon monoxide (CO and SiO) emission differ, but both have a central deficit,\nor torus-like distribution, possibly a result of radioactive heating during the\nfirst weeks (\"nickel heating\"). The size scales of the clumpy distribution are\ncompared quantitatively to models, demonstrating how progenitor and explosion\nphysics can be constrained.\n", "  Infrared observations of the dusty, massive Homunculus Nebula around the\nluminous blue variable $\\eta$ Carinae are crucial to characterize the mass-loss\nhistory and help constrain the mechanisms leading to the Great Eruption. We\npresent the 2.4 - 670 $\\mu$m spectral energy distribution, constructed from\nlegacy ISO observations and new spectroscopy obtained with the {\\em{Herschel\nSpace Observatory}}. Using radiative transfer modeling, we find that the two\nbest-fit dust models yield compositions which are consistent with CNO-processed\nmaterial, with iron, pyroxene and other metal-rich silicates, corundum, and\nmagnesium-iron sulfide in common. Spherical corundum grains are supported by\nthe good match to a narrow 20.2 $\\mu$m feature. Our preferred model contains\nnitrides AlN and Si$_3$N$_4$ in low abundances. Dust masses range from 0.25 to\n0.44 $M_\\odot$ but $M_{\\rm{tot}} \\ge$ 45 $M_\\odot$ in both cases due to an\nexpected high Fe gas-to-dust ratio. The bulk of dust is within a 5$\"$ $\\times$\n7$\"$ central region. An additional compact feature is detected at 390 $\\mu$m.\nWe obtain $L_{\\rm{IR}}$ = 2.96 $\\times$ 10$^6$ $L_\\odot$, a 25\\% decline from\nan average of mid-IR photometric levels observed in 1971-1977. This indicates a\nreduction in circumstellar extinction in conjunction with an increase in visual\nbrightness, allowing 25-40\\% of optical and UV radiation to escape from the\ncentral source. We also present an analysis of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J =\n5-4$ through $9-8$ lines, showing that the abundances are consistent with\nexpectations for CNO-processed material. The [$^{12}$C~{\\sc{ii}}] line is\ndetected in absorption, which we suspect originates in foreground material at\nvery low excitation temperatures.\n", "  A simple transit model is described along with tests of this model against\npublished results for 4 exoplanet systems (Kepler-1, 2, 8, and 77). Data from\nthe Kepler mission are used. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is\napplied to obtain realistic error estimates. Optimization of limb darkening\ncoefficients is subject to data quality. It is more likely for MCMC to derive\nan empirical limb darkening coefficient for light curves with S/N (signal to\nnoise) above 15. Finally, the model is applied to Kepler data for 4 Kepler\ncandidate systems (KOI 760.01, 767.01, 802.01, and 824.01) with previously\nunpublished results. Error estimates for these systems are obtained via the\nMCMC method.\n", "  In this work a new density functional theory framework is developed to\npredict the salt-concentration dependent swelling state of charged microgels\nand the local concentration of monovalent ions inside and outside the microgel.\nFor this purpose, elastic, solvent-induced and electrostatic contributions to\nthe microgel free energy are considered together with the free energy of the\nions. In addition to the electrostatic interaction, the model explicitly\nconsiders both the microgel-ion excluded-volume (steric) repulsion and the\nionic correlations, in such a way that the formalism is consistent with the\nHypernetted-Chain Closure approximation (HNC). We explore the role that the\nsolvent quality, chain elasticity, salt concentration and microgel bare charge\nplay on the swelling state, the effective charge and on the ionic density\nprofiles. Our results show that the microgel-ion steric exclusion foments the\nincrease of the particle size up to 10 %. The role that the steric effect plays\non the counterion distribution becomes more important when the microgel\napproaches the shrunken configuration, developing an accumulation peak at the\nmicrogel interface and a reduction in the inner core of the microgel that\ninduce a significant increase of the microgel effective charge. We further find\nthat deep inside the particle charge electroneutrality is achieved and a Donnan\npotential corrected by the steric exclusion is established.\n", "  The richness of the universe teaches us modesty and guides us to search for\nboth primitive and intelligent forms of life elsewhere without prejudice.\n", "  We provide an update for the astrometric solution for the Type II supernova\nprogenitor Betelgeuse using the revised Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data\n(HIAD) of van Leeuwen, combined with existing VLA and new e-MERLIN and ALMA\npositions. The 2007 Hipparcos refined abscissa measurements required the\naddition of so-called Cosmic Noise of 2.4 mas to find an acceptable 5-parameter\nstochastic solution. We find that a measure of radio Cosmic Noise should also\nbe included for the radio positions because surface inhomogeneities exist at a\nlevel significant enough to introduce additional intensity centroid\nuncertainty. Combining the 2007 HIAD with the proper motions based solely on\nthe radio positions leads to a parallax of $\\pi = 5.27\\pm 0.78$ mas\n($190^{+33}_{-25}$ pc), smaller than the Hipparcos 2007 value of $6.56\\pm 0.83$\nmas ($152^{+22}_{-17}$ pc; van Leeuwen 2007). Furthermore, combining the VLA\nand new e-MERLIN and ALMA radio positions with the 2007 HIAD, and including\nradio Cosmic Noise of 2.4 mas, leads to a nominal parallax solution of $4.51\n\\pm 0.80$ mas ($222^{+48}_{-34}$ pc), which while only $0.7\\sigma$ different\nfrom the 2008 solution of Harper et al. it is $2.6\\sigma$ different from the\nsolution of van Leeuwen. An accurate and precise parallax for Betelgeuse is\nalways going to be difficult to obtain because it is small compared to the\nstellar angular diameter ($\\theta=44$ mas). We outline an observing strategy,\nutilizing future mm and sub-mm high-spatial resolution interferometry that must\nbe used if substantial improvements in precision and accuracy of the parallax\nand distance are to be achieved.\n", "  The mechanisms responsible for heating the extended atmospheres of early-M\nspectral-type supergiants are poorly understood. So too is the subsequent role\nthese mechanisms play in driving the large mass-loss rates of these stars. Here\nwe present ALMA long (i.e., $\\sim$16 km) baseline 338 GHz (0.89 mm) continuum\nobservations of the free-free emission in the extended atmosphere of the M2\nspectral-type supergiant Betelgeuse. The spatial resolution of 14 mas\nexquisitely resolves the atmosphere, revealing it to have a mean temperature of\n2760 K at $\\sim$1.3 R$_{\\star}$, which is below both the photospheric effective\ntemperature ($T_{\\textrm{eff}} = 3690$ K) and the temperatures at $\\sim$$2\n$R$_{\\star}$. This is unambiguous proof for the existence of an inversion of\nthe mean temperature in the atmosphere of a red supergiant. The emission is\nclearly not spherically symmetric with two notable deviations from a uniform\ndisk detected in both the images and visibilities. The most prominent asymmetry\nis located in the north-east quadrant of the disk and is spatially resolved\nshowing it to be highly elongated with an axis-ratio of 2.4 and occupying\n$\\sim$$5\\%$ of the disk projected area. Its temperature is approximately 1000 K\nabove the measured mean temperature at 1.3 R$_{\\star}$. The other main\nasymmetry is located on the disk limb almost due east of the disk center and\noccupies $\\sim$$3\\%$ of the disk projected area. Both emission asymmetries are\nclear evidence for localized heating taking place in the atmosphere of\nBetelgeuse. We suggest that the detected localized heating is related to\nmagnetic activity generated by large-scale photospheric convection.\n", "  We present a new reaction model, which permits the description of reactions\nwhere both colliding nuclei present a low threshold to breakup. The method\ncorresponds to a four-body extension of the Continuum Discretized Coupled\nChannel (CDCC) model. We first discuss the theoretical formalism, and then\napply the method to 11Be+d scattering at Ecm = 45.5 MeV. The 11Be nucleus and\nthe deuteron are described by 10Be+n and p + n structures, respectively. The\nmodel involves very large bases, but we show that an accurate description of\nelastic-scattering data may be achieved only when continuum states of 11Be and\nof the deuteron are introduced simultaneously. We also discuss breakup\ncalculations, and show that the cross section is larger for 11Be than for the\ndeuteron. The present theory provides reliable wave functions that may be used\nin the analysis of (d,p) or (d,n) experiments involving radioactive beams.\n", "  The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet\ndepends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of\nextra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that\ntransit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to\ntransit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature\nof ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is\nitself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat\ndifferential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,\ntraits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the\ntemperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the\nmolecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of\nultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be\nsignificantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report\nobservations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital\nperiod ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star\nis at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the\nKELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar\ntype K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the\nprimary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely\natomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme\nultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,\nleading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet\nlargely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host\nstar.\n", "  At redshift z = 2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half\nof the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted\ntheir fuel for star formation(1-4). It is believed that they were formed in\nintense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive\nlocal elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor\ncompanions(5,6), but validating this picture requires higher-resolution\nobservations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from\ngravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of\ngalaxies(7). Here we report an analysis of the stellar populations and\nkinematics of a lensed z = 2.1478 compact galaxy, which surprisingly turns out\nto be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have\nformed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst(8). The\ngalaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate\nthe hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter\nhalo(9). This result confirms previous indirect indications(10-13) that the\nfirst galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not\njust in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into\npresent-day elliptical galaxies.\n", "  The results reported by Gambini, Pullin and Rastgoo in (2010 Class. Quantum\nGrav. 27 025002) are special cases of a general treatment of canonical\nvariables for dilaton gravity models published in (2009 Class. Quantum Grav. 26\n035018).\n", "  We study $f(R)$ gravity models in the language of scalar-tensor theories. The\ncorrespondence between $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor theories is revisited\nsince $f(R)$ gravity is a subclass of Brans-Dicke models, with a vanishing\ncoupling constant ($\\omega=0$). In this treatment, four $f(R)$ toy models are\nused to analyze the early-universe cosmology, when the scalar field $\\phi$\ndominates over standard matter. We have obtained solutions to the Klein-Gordon\nequation for those models. It is found that for the first model\n$\\left(f(R)=\\beta R^{n}\\right)$, as time increases the scalar field decreases\nand decays asymptotically. For the second model $\\left(f(R)=\\alpha R+\\beta\nR^{n}\\right)$ it was found that the function $\\phi(t)$ crosses the $t$-axis at\ndifferent values for different values of $\\beta$. For the third model\n$\\left(f(R)=R-\\frac{\\nu^{4}}{R}\\right)$, when the value of $\\nu$ is small the\npotential $V(\\phi)$ behaves like the standard inflationary potential. For the\nfourth model\n$\\left(f(R)=R-(1-m)\\nu^{2}\\Big(\\frac{R}{\\nu^{2}}\\Big)^{m}-2\\Lambda\\right)$, we\nshow that there is a transition between $1.5<m<1.55$. The behavior of the\npotentials with $m<1.5$ is totally different from those with $m>1.55$. The\nslow-roll approximation is applied to each of the four $f(R)$ models and we\nobtain the respective expressions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.\n", "  In this paper, we study the clustering of inertial particles using a periodic\nkinematic simulation. The systematic Lagrangian tracking of particles makes it\npossible to identify the particles' clustering patterns for different values of\nparticle inertia and drift velocity. The different cases are characterised by\ndifferent pairs of Stokes number $St$ and Froude number $Fr$. For the present\nstudy $0\\leq St \\leq 1$ and {$0.4 \\leq Fr \\leq 1.4$}. The main focus is to\nidentify and then quantify the clustering attractor - when it exists - that is\nthe set of points in the physical space where the particles settle when time\ngoes to infinity. Depending on gravity effect and inertia values, the\nLagrangian attractor can have different dimensions varying from the initial\nthree-dimensional space to two-dimensional layers and one-dimensional\nattractors that can be shifted from a horizontal to a vertical position.\n", "  Particle identification at the Belle II experiment will be provided by two\nring imaging Cherenkov devices, the time of propagation counters in the central\nregion and the proximity focusing RICH with aerogel radiator in the forward\nend-cap region. The key features of these two detectors, the performance\nstudies, and the construction progress is presented.\n", "  Exoplanetary atmospheric observations require an exquisite precision in the\nmeasurement of the relative flux among wavelengths. In this paper, we aim to\nprovide a new adaptive method to treat light curves before fitting transit\nparameters in order to minimize systematic effects that affect, for instance,\nground-based observations of exo-atmospheres. We propose a neural-network-based\nmethod that uses a reference built from the data itself with parameters that\nare chosen in an unsupervised fashion. To improve the performance of proposed\nmethod, K-means clustering and Silhouette criteria are used for identifying\nsimilar wavelengths in each cluster. We also constrain under which\ncircumstances our method improves the measurement of planetary-to-stellar\nradius ratio without producing significant systematic offset. We tested our\nmethod in high quality data from WASP-19b and low quality data from GJ-1214. We\nsucceed in providing smaller error bars for the former when using JKTEBOP, but\nGJ-1214 light curve was beyond the capabilities of this method to improve as it\nwas expected from our validation tests.\n", "  The development of stretchable and flexible electronics based on soft\npolymeric substrates requires novel approaches in the design, fabrication,\nintegration, and packaging of passive and active electronic components. Here we\ndemonstrate the fabrication, based on the use of supersonic cluster beam\nimplantation and deposition, of a system consisting of a stretchable keyboard\nmade by PDMS connected with a touch sensor and a matrix of LEDs printed on\npaper, through paper-based interconnections. The stretchable keyboard has\nconductive vias to electrically connect the top and bottom layers. Gold\nconductive films printed on paper are used to connect the keyboard with the\nelectronic components that drive the LED matrix.\n", "  The resonances associated with a fractional damped oscillator which is driven\nby an oscillatory external force are studied. It is shown that such resonances\ncan be manipulated by tuning up either the coefficient of the fractional\ndamping or the order of the corresponding fractional derivatives.\n", "  In a world of ever-increasing systems interdependence, effective\ncybersecurity policy design seems to be one of the most critically understudied\nelements of our national security strategy. Enterprise cyber technologies are\noften implemented without much regard to the interactions that occur between\nhumans and the new technology. Furthermore, the interactions that occur between\nindividuals can often have an impact on the newly employed technology as well.\nWithout a rigorous, evidence-based approach to ground an employment strategy\nand elucidate the emergent organizational needs that will come with the\nfielding of new cyber capabilities, one is left to speculate on the impact that\nnovel technologies will have on the aggregate functioning of the enterprise. In\nthis paper, we will explore a scenario in which a hypothetical government\nagency applies a complexity science perspective, supported by agent-based\nmodeling, to more fully understand the impacts of strategic policy decisions.\nWe present a model to explore the socio-technical dynamics of these systems,\ndiscuss lessons using this platform, and suggest further research and\ndevelopment.\n", "  A mean-field treatment is presented of a square lattice two-orbital-model for\n${\\rm BiS_2}$ taking into account intra- and inter-orbital superconductivity. A\nrich phase diagram involving both types of superconductivity is presented as a\nfunction of the ratio between the couplings of electrons in the same and\ndifferent orbitals (${\\rm \\eta= V_{XX}/V_{XY}}$) and electron doping $x$. With\nthe help of a quantity we call orbital-mixing ratio, denoted as $R(\\phi)$, the\nphase diagram is analyzed using a simple and intuitive picture based on how\n$R(\\phi)$ varies as electron doping increases. The predictive power of\n$R(\\phi)$ suggests that it could be a useful tool in qualitatively (or even\nsemi-quantitatively) analyzing multiband superconductivity in BCS-like\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We compute the magnetic dipole moment (MDM) for massive flavor neutrinos\nusing the neutrino self-energy in a magnetized media. The framework to\nincorporate neutrino masses is one minimal extension of the Standard Model in\nwhich neutrinos are Dirac particles and their masses coming from tiny Yukawa\ncouplings from a second Higgs doublet with a small vacuum expectation value.\nThe computations are carried out by using proper time formalism in the weak\nfield approximation $eB<<m_{e}^{2}$ and assuming normal hierarchy for neutrino\nmasses and sweeping the charged Higgs mass. For $\\nu_{\\tau}$, analyses in the\nneutrino specific scenario indicate magnetic dipole moments greater than the\nvalues obtained to the MDM in the SM (with and without magnetic fields) and\nother flavor conserving models. This fact leading a higher proximity with\nexperimental bounds and so on it is possible to get stronger exclusion limits\nover new physics parameter space.\n", "  The $SU(4)-SU(2)$ crossover, driven by an external magnetic field $h$, is\nanalyzed in a capacitively-coupled double-quantum-dot device connected to\nindependent leads. As one continuously charges the dots from empty to\nquarter-filled, by varying the gate potential $V_g$, the crossover starts when\nthe magnitude of the spin polarization of the double quantum dot, as measured\nby $\\langle n_{\\uparrow}\\rangle -\\langle n_{\\downarrow}\\rangle$, becomes\nfinite. Although the external magnetic field breaks the $SU(4)$ symmetry of the\nHamiltonian, the ground state preserves it in a region of $V_g$, where $\\langle\nn_{\\uparrow}\\rangle -\\langle n_{\\downarrow}\\rangle =0$. Once the spin\npolarization becomes finite, it initially increases slowly until a sudden\nchange occurs, in which $\\langle n_{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ (polarization direction\nopposite to the magnetic field) reaches a maximum and then decreases to\nnegligible values abruptly, at which point an orbital $SU(2)$ ground state is\nfully established. This crossover from one Kondo state, with emergent $SU(4)$\nsymmetry, where spin and orbital degrees of freedom all play a role, to\nanother, with $SU(2)$ symmetry, where only orbital degrees of freedom\nparticipate, is triggered by a competition between $g\\mu_Bh$, the energy gain\nby the Zeeman-split polarized state and the Kondo temperature $T_K^{SU(4)}$,\nthe gain provided by the $SU(4)$ unpolarized Kondo-singlet state.\n", "  We use numerical methods to study the behaviour of the Serre equations in the\npresence of steep gradients because there are no known analytical solutions for\nthese problems. In keeping with the literature we study a class of initial\ncondition problems that are a smooth approximation to the initial conditions of\nthe dam-break problem. This class of initial condition problems allow us to\nobserve the behaviour of the Serre equations with varying steepness of the\ninitial conditions. The numerical solutions of the Serre equations are\njustified by demonstrating that as the resolution increases they converge to a\nsolution with little error in conservation of mass, momentum and energy\nindependent of the numerical method. We observe four different structures of\nthe converged numerical solutions depending on the steepness of the initial\nconditions. Two of these structures were observed in the literature, with the\nother two not being commonly found in the literature. The numerical solutions\nare then used to assess how well the analytical solution of the shallow water\nwave equations captures the mean behaviour of the solution of the Serre\nequations for the dam-break problem. Lastly the numerical solutions are used to\nevaluate the usefulness of asymptotic results in the literature to approximate\nthe depth and location of the front of an undular bore.\n", "  Spin current plays a central role in spintronics. In particular, finding more\nefficient ways to generate spin current has been an important issue and studied\nactively. For example, representative methods of spin current generation\ninclude spin polarized current injections from ferromagnetic metals, spin Hall\neffect, and spin battery. Here we theoretically propose a new mechanism of spin\ncurrent generation based on nonlinear phenomena. By using Boltzmann transport\ntheory, we show that a simple application of the electric field $\\bf{E}$\ninduces spin current proportional to $\\bf{E^2}$ in noncentrosymmetric\nspin-orbit coupled systems. We demonstrate that the nonlinear spin current of\nthe proposed mechanism is supported in the surface state of three-dimensional\ntopological insulators and two-dimensional semiconductors with the Rashba\nand/or Dresselhaus interaction. In the latter case, the angular dependence of\nthe nonlinear spin current can be manipulated by the direction of the electric\nfield and by the ratio of the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. We find that\nthe magnitude of the spin current largely exceeds those in the previous methods\nfor a reasonable magnitude of the electric field. Furthermore, we show that\napplication of AC electric fields (e.g. terahertz light) leads to the\nrectifying effect of the spin current where DC spin current is generated. These\nfindings will pave a new route to manipulate the spin current in\nnoncentrosymmetric crystals.\n", "  Magnesium and its alloys are ideal for biodegradable implants due to their\nbiocompatibility and their low-stress shielding. However, they can corrode too\nrapidly in the biological environment. The objective of this research was to\ndevelop heat treatments to slow the corrosion of high purified magnesium and\nAZ31 alloy in simulated body fluid at 37{\\deg}C. Heat treatments were performed\nat different temperatures and times. Hydrogen evolution, weight loss, PDP, and\nEIS methods were used to measure the corrosion rates. Results show that heat\ntreating can increase the corrosion resistance of HP-Mg by 2x and AZ31 by 10x.\n", "  What happens when you slow down part of an ultrafast network that is\noperating quicker than the blink of an eye, e.g. electronic exchange network,\nnavigational systems in driverless vehicles, or even neuronal processes in the\nbrain? This question just adopted immediate commercial, legal and political\nimportance following U.S. financial regulators' decision to allow a new network\nnode to intentionally introduce delays of microseconds. Though similar requests\nare set to follow, there is still no scientific understanding available to\npolicymakers of the likely system-wide impact of such delays. Giving academic\nresearchers access to (so far prohibitively expensive) microsecond exchange\ndata would help rectify this situation. As a by-product, the lessons learned\nwould deepen understanding of instabilities across myriad other networks, e.g.\nimpact of millisecond delays on brain function and safety of driverless vehicle\nnavigation systems beyond human response times.\n", "  The electronic structure and energetic stability of A$_2$BX$_6$ halide\ncompounds with the cubic and tetragonal variants of the perovskite-derived\nK$_2$PtCl$_6$ prototype structure are investigated computationally within the\nframeworks of density-functional-theory (DFT) and hybrid (HSE06) functionals.\nThe HSE06 calculations are undertaken for seven known A$_2$BX$_6$ compounds\nwith A = K, Rb and Cs, and B = Sn, Pd, Pt, Te, and X = I. Trends in band gaps\nand energetic stability are identified, which are explored further employing\nDFT calculations over a larger range of chemistries, characterized by A = K,\nRb, Cs, B = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Se and Te and X = Cl, Br, I. For the\nsystems investigated in this work, the band gap increases from iodide to\nbromide to chloride. Further, variations in the A site cation influences the\nband gap as well as the preferred degree of tetragonal distortion. Smaller A\nsite cations such as K and Rb favor tetragonal structural distortions,\nresulting in a slightly larger band gap. For variations in the B site in the\n(Ni, Pd, Pt) group and the (Se, Te) group, the band gap increases with\nincreasing cation size. However, no observed chemical trend with respect to\ncation size for band gap was found for the (Si, Sn, Ge, Pb) group. The findings\nin this work provide guidelines for the design of halide A$_2$BX$_6$ compounds\nfor potential photovoltaic applications.\n", "  We report on the thermally activated flux flow dependency on the doping\ndependent mixed state in NaFe1-xCoxAs (x=0.01, 0.03, and 0.07) crystals using\nthe magnetoresistivity in the case of B//c-axis and B//ab-plane. It was found\nclearly that irrespective of the doping ratio, magnetoresistivity showed a\ndistinct tail just above the Tc, offset associated with the thermally activated\nflux flow (TAFF) in our crystals. Furthermore, in TAFF region the temperature\ndependence of the activation energy follows the relation U(T, B)=U_0 (B)\n(1-T/T_c )^q with q=1.5 in all studied crystals. The magnetic field dependence\nof the activation energy follows a power law of U_0 (B)~B^(-{\\alpha}) where the\nexponent {\\alpha} is changed from a low value to a high value at a crossover\nfield of B=~2T, indicating the transition from collective to plastic pinning in\nthe crystals. Finally, it is suggested that the 3D vortex phase is the dominant\nphase in the low-temperature region as compared to the TAFF region in our\nseries samples.\n", "  Dielectric study over a broadband was carried out from 10 to 70 K on ceramic\nGd1-xYxMnO3 (x= 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4). For all the compositions, a prominent sharp\npeak about ~18K was observed in the temperature dependence of both\n{\\epsilon}'(T) and {\\epsilon}\"(T) at all frequencies, indicating a long-range\nferroelectric (FE) transition. Using Cole-Cole fit to the permittivity data,\nthe relaxation time {\\tau} and the dielectric strength {\\Delta}{\\epsilon} were\nestimated. Temperature variation of {\\tau}(T) in the Arrhenius representation\nis found to be nonlinear (non-Debyean relaxation), with increasing\nbarrier-activation energy over successive temperature-windows. Interestingly,\nfor all the compositions, we witness a jump in {\\tau}(T) about the\nferroelectric transition temperature, concurred by a broad-maximum in\n{\\Delta}{\\epsilon}(T), signifying the critical slowdown of relaxations near\nlong-range FE-correlations.\n", "  Although significant insights have been obtained into chemical and physical\nproperties that govern to the performance of catalysts in traditional thermal\nprocesses, the work on electro-, photo-, or plasma-catalytic approaches has\nbeen comparatively limited. The effect of (local) surface charges in these\nprocesses, while most likely a crucial factor of their activity, has not been\nwell-characterized and is difficult to study in a consistent, isolated manner.\nEven theoretical calculations, which have traditionally allowed for the\nuntangling of the atomic-level mechanisms underpinning the catalytic process,\ncannot be readily applied to this class of problems because of their inability\nto properly treat systems carrying a net charge. Here, we report on a new,\ngeneric, and practical approach to deal with charged semiperiodic systems in\ndensity functional calculations, which can be readily applied to problems\nacross surface science. Using this method, we investigate the effect of a\nnegative catalyst surface charge on CO$_2$ activation by supported\nM/Al$_2$O$_3$ (M = Ti, Ni, Cu) single atom catalysts. The presence of an excess\nelectron dramatically improves the reductive power of the catalyst, strongly\npromoting the splitting of CO$_2$ to CO and oxygen. The relative activity of\nthe investigated transition metals is also changed upon charging, suggesting\nthat controlled surface charging is a powerful additional parameter to tune\ncatalyst activity and selectivity.\n", "  Motivated by the recent development of quantitative structure-activity\nrelationship (QSAR) methods in the area of nanotoxicology, we proposed an\napproach to develop additional descriptors based on results of first principles\ncalculations. For evaluation of the biochemical activity of metallic\nnanoparticles, we consider two processes: ion extraction from the surface of a\nspecimen to aqueous media and water dissociation on the surface. We performed\ncalculations for a set of metals (Al, Fe, Cu, Ag, Au, Pt). Taking into account\nthe diversity of atomic structures of real metallic nanoparticles, we performed\ncalculations for different models such as (001) and (111) surfaces, nanorods,\nand two different cubic nanoparticles of 0.6 and 0.3 nm size. Significant\nenergy dependence of the processes from the selected model of nanoparticle\nsuggests that for the correct description we should combine the calculations\nfor the several representative models. In addition to the descriptors of\nchemical activity of the metallic nanoparticles for the two studied processes,\nwe propose descriptors for taking into account the dependence of chemical\nactivity from the size and shape of nanoparticles. Routes to minimization of\ncomputational costs for these calculations are also discussed.\n", "  Ionic electro-active polymers (E.A.P.) is an active material consisting in a\npolyelectrolyte (for example Nafion). Such material is usually used as thin\nfilm sandwiched between two platinum electrodes. The polymer undergoes large\nbending motions when an electric field is applied across the thickness.\nConversely, a voltage can be detected between both electrodes when the polymer\nis suddenly bent. The solvent-saturated polymer is fully dissociated, releasing\ncations of small size. We used a continuous medium approach. The material is\nmodelled by the coexistence of two phases; it can be considered as a porous\nmedium where the deformable solid phase is the polymer backbone with fixed\nanions; the electrolyte phase is made of a solvent (usually water) with free\ncations. The microscale conservation laws of mass, linear momentum and energy\nand the Maxwell's equations are first written for each phase. The physical\nquantities linked to the interfaces are deduced. The use of an average\ntechnique applied to the two-phase medium finally leads to an Eulerian\nformulation of the conservation laws of the complete material. Macroscale\nequations relative to each phase provides exchanges through the interfaces. An\nanalysis of the balance equations of kinetic, potential and internal energy\nhighlights the 2 Mireille Tixier, Jo{\\\"e}l Pouget phenomena responsible of the\nconversion of one kind of energy into another, especially the dissipative ones\n: viscous frictions and Joule effect.\n", "  Ionic electro-active polymers (E.A.P.) can be used as sensors or actuators.\nFor this purpose, a thin film of polyelectrolyte is saturated with a solvent\nand sandwiched between two platinum electrodes. The solvent causes a complete\ndissociation of the polymer and the release of small cations. The application\nof an electric field across the thickness results in the bending of the strip\nand vice versa. The material is modelled by a two-phase continuous medium. The\nsolid phase, constituted by the polymer backbone inlaid with anions, is\ndepicted as a deformable porous media. The liquid phase is composed of the free\ncations and the solvent (usually water). We used a coarse grain model. The\nconservation laws of this system have been established in a previous work. The\nentropy balance law and the thermodynamic relations are first written for each\nphase, then for the complete material using a statistical average technique and\nthe material derivative concept. One deduces the entropy production.\nIdentifying generalized forces and fluxes provides the constitutive equations\nof the whole system : the stress-strain relations which satisfy a Kelvin-Voigt\nmodel, generalized Fourier's and Darcy's laws and the Nernst-Planck equation.\n", "  We present a theory of the Seebeck effect in nanoscale ferromagnets with\ndimensions smaller than the spin diffusion length. The spin accumulation\ngenerated by a temperature gradient strongly affects the thermopower. We also\nidentify a correction arising from the transverse temperature gradient induced\nby the anomalous Ettingshausen effect. The effect of an induced spin-heat accu-\nmulation gradient is considered as well. The importance of these effects for\nnanoscale ferromagnets is illustrated by ab initio calculations for dilute\nferromagnetic alloys.\n", "  We show the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a $\\Phi_4^4$ non linear\nrenormalized system of equations of motion in Euclidean space. This system\nrepresents a non trivial model which describes the dynamics of the $\\Phi_4^4$\nGreen's functions in the Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) framework.\n  The main argument is the local contractivity of the so called \\emph{\"new\nmapping\"} in the neighborhood of a particular \"tree type\" sequence of Green's\nfunctions. This neighborhood (and the $\\Phi_4^4$ non trivial solution) belongs\nto a particular subset of the appropriate Banach space characterized by signs,\nsplitting (analogous to that of the $\\Phi_0^4$ solution), axiomatic analyticity\nproperties and \"good\" asymptotic behavior with respect to the four-dimensional\neuclidean external momenta.\n", "  The frequency responses of the K-Rb-$^{21}$Ne co-magnetometer to magnetic\nfield and exotic spin dependent forces are experimentally studied and simulated\nin this paper. Both the relationship between the output amplitude, the phase\nshift and frequencies are studied. The responses of magnetic field are\nexperimentally investigated. Due to a lack of input methods, others are\nnumerically simulated.\n", "  We report on recent studies of photon-induced (PI) contributions to di-lepton\nproduction and their implications for Beyond Standard Model (BSM)\n$Z^\\prime$-bosons searches at the LHC.\n", "  Internet communication systems involving cryptography and data hiding often\nrequire billions of random numbers. In addition to the speed of the algorithm,\nthe quality of the pseudo-random number generator and the ease of its\nimplementation are common practical aspects. In this work we will discuss how\nto improve the quality of random numbers independently from their generation\nalgorithm. We propose an additional implementation technique in order to take\nadvantage of some chaotic properties. The statistical quality of our solution\nstems from some well-defined discrete chaotic iterations that satisfy the\nreputed Devaney's definition of chaos, namely the chaotic iterations technique.\nPursuing recent researches published in the previous International Conference\non Evolving Internet (Internet 09, 10, and 11), three methods to build\npseudorandom generators by using chaotic iterations are recalled. Using\nstandard criteria named NIST and DieHARD (some famous batteries of tests), we\nwill show that the proposed technique can improve the statistical properties of\na large variety of defective pseudorandom generators, and that the issues\nraised by statistical tests decrease when the power of chaotic iterations\nincrease.\n", "  Thermally stable quantum states with multipartite entanglements led by\nfrustration are found in the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg hexagon. The\nmodel has been solved exactly to obtain all analytic expressions of eigenvalues\nand eigenfunctions. Detection and characterizations for various types of\nentanglements have been carried out in terms of concurrence and entanglement\nwitnesses based on several thermodynamic observables. Variations of\nentanglement properties with respect to temperature and frustration are\ndiscussed. Even though the frustration opposes the bipartite entanglement, it\nfavors the multipartite entanglement. Entangled states exhibit robustness\nagainst the thermal effects in the presence of frustration and they are found\nto survive at any temperature.\n", "  For classical many-body systems, our recent study reveals that expectation\nvalue of internal energy, structure, and free energy can be well characterized\nby a single specially-selected microscopic structure. This finding relies on\nthe fact that configurational density of states (CDOS) for typical classical\nsystem before applying interatomic interaction can be well characterized by\nmultidimensional gaussian distribution. Although gaussian distribution is an\nwell-known and widely-used function in diverse fields, it is quantitatively\nunclear why the CDOS takes gaussian when system size gets large, even for\nprojected CDOS onto a single chosen coordination. Here we demonstrate that for\nequiatomic binary system, one-dimensional CDOS along coordination of pair\ncorrelation can be reasonably described by gaussian distribution under an\nappropriate condition, whose deviation from real CDOS mainly reflects the\nexistence of triplet closed link consisting of the pair figure considered. The\npresent result thus significantly makes advance in analytic determination of\nthe special microscopic states to characterized macroscopic physical property\nin equilibrium state.\n", "  The cohesion-tension theory expounds the crude sap ascent thanks to the\nnegative pressure generated by evaporation of water from leaves. Nevertheless,\ntrees pose multiple challenges and seem to live in unphysical conditions: the\nnegative pressure increases cavitation; it is possible to obtain a water\nequilibrium between connected parts where one is at a positive pressure and the\nother one is at negative pressure; no theory is able to satisfactorily account\nfor the refilling of vessels after embolism events. A theoretical form of our\npaper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology is proposed together with new\nresults: a continuum mechanics model of the disjoining pressure concept refers\nto the Derjaguin School of physical chemistry. A comparison between liquid\nbehaviour both in tight-filled microtubes and in liquid thin-films is offered\nwhen the pressure is negative in liquid bulks and is positive in liquid\nthin-films and vapour bulks. In embolized xylem microtubes, when the air-vapour\npocket pressure is greater than the air-vapour bulk pressure, a refilling flow\noccurs between the air-vapour domains to empty the air-vapour pockets although\nthe liquid-bulk pressure remains negative. The model has a limit of validity\ntaking the maximal size of trees into account. These results drop inkling that\nthe disjoining pressure is an efficient tool to study biological liquids in\ncontact with substrates at a nanoscale range.\n", "  $\\xi^1$ CMa is a monoperiodically pulsating, magnetic $\\beta$ Cep star with\nmagnetospheric X-ray emission which, uniquely amongst magnetic stars, is\nclearly modulated with the star's pulsation period. The rotational period\n$P_{\\rm rot}$ has yet to be identified, with multiple competing claims in the\nliterature. We present an analysis of a large ESPaDOnS dataset with a 9-year\nbaseline. The longitudinal magnetic field $\\langle B_{\\rm Z}\\rangle$ shows a\nsignificant annual variation, suggesting that $P_{\\rm rot}$ is at least on the\norder of decades. The possibility that the star's H$\\alpha$ emission originates\naround a classical Be companion star is explored and rejected based upon VLTI\nAMBER and PIONIER interferometry, indicating that the emission must instead\noriginate in the star's magnetosphere and should therefore also be modulated\nwith $P_{\\rm rot}$. Period analysis of H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths measured\nfrom ESPaDOnS and CORALIE spectra indicates $P_{\\rm rot} > 30$ yr. All evidence\nthus supports that $\\xi^1$ CMa is a very slowly rotating magnetic star hosting\na dynamical magnetosphere. H$\\alpha$ also shows evidence for modulation with\nthe pulsation period, a phenomenon which we show cannot be explained by\nvariability of the underlying photospheric line profile, i.e. it may reflect\nchanges in the quantity and distribution of magnetically confined plasma in the\ncircumstellar environment. In comparison to other magnetic stars with similar\nstellar properties, $\\xi^1$ CMa is by far the most slowly rotating magnetic\nB-type star, is the only slowly rotating B-type star with a magnetosphere\ndetectable in H$\\alpha$ (and thus, the coolest star with an optically\ndetectable dynamical magnetosphere), and is the only known early-type magnetic\nstar with H$\\alpha$ emission modulated by both pulsation and rotation.\n", "  We measured the activation energy gap of the N = 2 bubble states using\ntilted-field technique in two GaAs/AlGaAs samples with Corbino geometry, and\nobserved monotonically decreasing energy gaps with the increasing total\nmagnetic field. The observed tilt angle dependence is discussed based on\nmagneto-orbital coupling and finite-size effect. We also found a bubble state\nat an uncommon filling factor of 4.67, with an unanticipated energy gap of up\nto 5.35 K and opposite in-plane field dependence.\n", "  The paper investigates shock-induced vortical flows within inhomogeneous\nmedia of nonuniform thermodynamic properties. Numerical simulations are\nperformed using an Eularian type mathematical model for compressible\nmulti-component flow problems. The model, which accounts for pressure\nnon-equilibrium and applies different equations of state for individual flow\ncomponents, shows excellent capabilities for the resolution of interfaces\nseparating compressible fluids as well as for capturing the baroclinic source\nof vorticity generation. The developed finite volume Godunov type computational\napproach is equipped with an approximate Riemann solver for calculating fluxes\nand handles numerically diffused zones at flow component interfaces. The\ncomputations are performed for various initial conditions and are compared with\navailable experimental data. The initial conditions promoting a shock-bubble\ninteraction process include: weak to high planar shock waves with a Mach number\nranging from $1.2$ to $3$ and isolated cylindrical bubble inhomogeneities of\nhelium, argon, nitrogen, krypton and sulphur hexafluoride. The numerical\nresults reveal the characteristic features of the evolving flow topology. The\nimpulsively generated flow perturbations are dominated by the reflection and\nrefraction of the shock, the compression and acceleration as well as the\nvorticity generation within the medium. The study is further extended to\ninvestigate the influence of the ratio of the heat capacities on the interface\ndeformation.\n", "  The conformal gravity remarkably boosts our prehension of gravity theories.\nWe find a series of dynamical solutions in the $W^2$-conformal gravity,\nincluding generalized Schwarzschild-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (GSFRW), charged\ngeneralized Schwarzschild-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (CGSFRW), especially\nrotating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (RFRW), charged rotating\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (CRFRW), and a dynamical cylindrically symmetric\nsolutions. The RFRW, CRFRW and the dynamical cylindrically symmetric solutions\nare never found in the Einstein gravity and modified gravities. The GSFRW and\nCGSFRW solutions take different forms from the corresponding solutions in the\nEinstein gravity.\n", "  Spacetime singularity has always been of interest since the proof of the\nPenrose-Hawking singularity theorem. Naked singularity naturally emerges from\nreasonable initial conditions in the collapsing process. A recent interesting\napproach in black hole information problem implies that we need a firewall to\nbreak the surplus entanglements among the Hawking photons. Classically, the\nfirewall becomes a naked singularity. We find some vacuum analytical solutions\nin $R^n$-gravity of the firewall-type and use these solutions as concrete\nmodels to study the naked singularities. By using standard quantum theory, we\ninvestigate the Hawking radiation emitted from the black holes with naked\nsingularities. Here we show that the singularity itself does not destroy\ninformation. A unitary quantum theory works well around a firewall-type\nsingularity. We discuss the validity of our result in general relativity.\nFurther our result demonstrates that the temperature of the Hawking radiation\nstill can be expressed in the form of the surface gravity divided by $2\\pi$.\nThis indicates that a naked singularity may not compromise the Hakwing\nevaporation process.\n", "  Photosynthetic materials form the basis of quantum biology. An important\nattribute of quantum biology is correlation and coherence of spin states. Such\ncorrelated spin states are targets of static magnetic field. In this paper, we\nreport magnetic properties and spectroscopically realizable static magnetic\nfield effect in photosynthetic materials. Two classes of nano-scale assembly of\nchlorophyll (NC) are used for such a study. Magnetic measurements are made\nusing a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Both ferromagnetic\nand superparamagnetic states are observed in NC along with a blocking\ntemperature around 250 K. Low temperature quantum (liquid nitrogen)\nspectroscopy is employed to see how optical transitions are affected in\npresence of static magnetic field. Plausible practical application aspects of\nmagnetic properties of this optically active material are discussed in the\ntext.\n", "  We have searched for the stars that either encountered in the past or will\nencounter in the future with the Solar system closer than 2 pc. For this\npurpose, we took more than 216 000 stars with the measured proper motions and\ntrigonometric parallaxes from the Gaia DR1 catalogue and their radial\nvelocities from the RAVE5 catalogue. We have found several stars for which\nencounters closer than 1 pc are possible. The star GJ 710, for which the\nminimum distance is d_m=0.063+/-0.044 pc at time t_m=1385+/-52 thousand years,\nis the record-holder among them. Two more stars, TYC 8088-631-1 and TYC\n6528-980-1, whose encounter parameters, however, are estimated with large\nerrors, are of interest.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the chiral phase transition in the massless\ntwo-flavor QCD using the renormalization group improved gauge action and the\nWilson quark action on $32^3\\times 16$, $24^3\\times 12$, and $16^3\\times 8$\nlattices. We calculate the spacial and temporal propagators of the iso-triplet\nmesons in the pseudo-scalar ($PS$), scalar ($S$), vector ($V$) and axial-vector\n($AV$) channels on the lattice of three sizes. We first verify that the RG\nscaling is excellently satisfied for all cases. This is consistent with the\nclaim that the chiral phase transition is second order. Then we compare the\nspacial and temporal effective masses between the axial partners, i.e. $PS$ vs\n$S$ and $V$ vs $AV$, on each of the three size lattices. We find the effective\nmasses of all of six cases for the axial partners agree remarkably. This is\nconsistent with the claim that at least $Z_4$ subgroup of the $U_A(1)$ symmetry\nin addition to the $SU_A(2)$ symmetry is recovered at the chiral phase\ntransition point.\n", "  Next investigations in our program of transition from the He atom to the\ncomplex atoms description have been presented. The method of interacting\nconfigurations in the complex number representation is under consideration. The\nspectroscopic characteristics of the Mg and Ca atoms in the problem of the\nelectron-impact ionization of these atoms are investigated. The energies and\nthe widths of the lowest autoionizing states of Mg and Ca atoms are calculated.\nFew results in the photoionization problem on the autoionizing states above the\nn=2 threshold of helium-like Be ion are presented.\n", "  An important feature of the planetary oceanic dynamics is that the aspect\nratio (the ratio of the depth to horizontal width) is very small. As a result,\nthe hydrostatic approximation (balance), derived by performing the formal small\naspect ratio limit to the Navier-Stokes equations, is considered as a\nfundamental component in the primitive equations of the large-scale ocean. In\nthis paper, we justify rigorously the small aspect ratio limit of the\nNavier-Stokes equations to the primitive equations. Specifically, we prove that\nthe Navier-Stokes equations, after being scaled appropriately by the small\naspect ratio parameter of the physical domain, converge strongly to the\nprimitive equations, globally and uniformly in time, and the convergence rate\nis of the same order as the aspect ratio parameter. This result validates the\nhydrostatic approximation for the large-scale oceanic dynamics. Notably, only\nthe weak convergence of this small aspect ratio limit was rigorously justified\nbefore.\n", "  In this letter we investigate some consequences of considering our 4D\nobservable universe as locally and isometrically embeded into a 5D spacetime,\nwhere gravity is described by a Brans-Dicke theory in vacuum. Once we impose\nthe embeding conditions we obtain that gravity on the 4D spacetime is governed\nby the Einstein field equations modified by an extra term that can play the\nrole of a dynamical cosmological constant. Two examples were studied. In the\nfirst we derive a cosmological model of a universe filled only with a\ncosmological constant. In the second we obtain a cosmological solution\ndescribing a universe filled with matter, radiation and a dynamical\ncosmological constant, in agree with observational data. Due to the 5D\ngeometrical origin for the dynamical cosmological constant we interpret that\nthe acceleration in the expansion is explained without the introduction of a\ndark energy component. Moreover, all 4D matter sources are geometrically\ninduced in the same manner as it is usually done in the Wesson's induced matter\ntheory.\n", "  We present the results of a recent study of meson-exchange two-body currents\nin lepton-nucleus inclusive scattering at various kinematics and for different\nnuclei within the Relativistic Fermi Gas model. We show that the associated\nnuclear response functions at their peaks scale as $A k_F^2$, for Fermi\nmomentum $k_F$ going from 200 to 300 MeV/c and momentum transfer $q$ from\n$2k_F$ to 2 GeV/c. This behavior is different from what is found for the\nquasielastic response, which scales as $A/k_F$. This result can be valuable in\nthe analyses of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, which need to\nimplement these nuclear effects in Monte Carlo simulations for different\nkinematics and nuclear targets.\n", "  This thesis focuses on the XY model, the simplest vector spin model, used for\ndescribing numerous physical systems. It is studied for different sources of\nquenched disorder: random couplings, random fields, or both them. The belief\npropagation algorithm and the cavity method are exploited to solve the model on\nthe sparse topology provided by Bethe lattices. It is found that the\ndiscretized version of the XY model, the so-called $Q$-state clock model,\nprovides a reliable and efficient proxy for the continuous model with an error\ngoing to zero exponentially in $Q$, so implying a remarkable speedup in\nnumerical simulations. Interesting results regard the low-temperature solution\nof the spin glass XY model, which is by far more unstable toward the replica\nsymmetry broken phase with respect to what happens in discrete models.\nMoreover, even the random field XY model with ferromagnetic couplings exhibits\na replica symmetry broken phase, at variance with both the fully connected\nversion of the same model and the diluted random field Ising model, as a\nfurther evidence of a more pronounced glassiness of the diluted XY model. Then,\nthe instabilities of the spin glass XY model in an external field are\ncharacterized, recognizing different critical lines according to the different\nsymmetries of the external field. Finally, the inherent structures in the\nenergy landscape of the spin glass XY model in a random field are described,\nexploiting the capability of the zero-temperature belief propagation algorithm\nto actually reach the ground state of the system. Remarkably, the density of\nsoft modes in the Hessian matrix shows a non-mean-field behaviour, typical of\nglasses in finite dimension, while the critical point of replica symmetry\ninstability predicted by the belief propagation algorithm seems to correspond\nto a delocalization of such soft modes.\n", "  The miniaturization of semiconductor devices to the scales where small\nnumbers of dopants can control device properties requires the development of\nnew techniques capable of characterizing their dynamics. Investigating single\ndopants requires sub-nanometer spatial resolution which motivates the use of\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM), however, conventional STM is limited to\nmillisecond temporal resolution. Several methods have been developed to\novercome this shortcoming. Among them is all-electronic time-resolved STM,\nwhich is used in this work to study dopant dynamics in silicon with nanosecond\nresolution. The methods presented here are widely accessible and allow for\nlocal measurement of a wide variety of dynamics at the atomic scale. A novel\ntime-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy technique is presented and used\nto efficiently search for dynamics.\n", "  We describe a new algorithm, the reflection method, to generate off-lattice\nrandom walks of specified, though arbitrarily large, thickness in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ and prove that our method is ergodic on the space of thick\nwalks. The data resulting from our implementation of this method is consistent\nwith the scaling of the squared radius of gyration of random walks, with no\nthickness constraint. Based on this, we use the data to describe the complex\nrelationship between the presence and nature of knotting and size, thickness\nand shape of the random walk. We extend the current understanding of excluded\nvolume by expanding the range of analysis of how the squared radius of gyration\nscales with length and thickness. We also examine the profound effect of\nthickness on knotting in open chains. We will quantify how thickness effects\nthe size of thick open chains, calculating the growth exponent for squared\nradius of gyration as a function of thickness. We will also show that for\nradius $r \\leq 0.4$, increasing thickness by 0.1 decreases the probability of\nknot formation by 50% or more.\n", "  Although the emergence of a fully-functional quantum computer may still be\nfar away from today, in the near future, it is possible to have medium-size,\nspecial-purpose, quantum devices that can perform computational tasks not\nefficiently simulable with any classical computer. This status is known as\nquantum supremacy (or quantum advantage), where one of the promising approaches\nis through the sampling of chaotic quantum circuits. Sampling of ideal chaotic\nquantum circuits has been argued to require an exponential time for classical\ndevices. A major question is whether quantum supremacy can be maintained under\nnoise without error correction, as the implementation of fault-tolerance would\ncost lots of extra qubits and quantum gates. Here we show that, for a family of\nchaotic quantum circuits subject to Pauli errors, there exists an\nnon-exponential classical algorithm capable of simulating the noisy chaotic\nquantum circuits with bounded errors. This result represents a serious\nchallenge to a previous result in the literature suggesting the failure of\nclassical devices in simulating noisy chaotic circuits with about 48 qubits and\ndepth 25. Moreover, even though our model does not cover all types of\nexperimental errors, from a practical point view, our result describes a\nwell-defined setting where quantum supremacy can be tested against the\nchallenges of classical rivals, in the context of chaotic quantum circuits.\n", "  For over a decade, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have\nbeen recording measurements from the Martian surface as a part of the Mars\nExploration Rovers mission. One quantity of interest has been the opacity of\nMars's atmosphere for its importance in day-to-day estimations of the amount of\npower available to the rover from its solar arrays. This paper proposes the use\nof neural networks as a method for forecasting Martian atmospheric opacity that\nis more effective than the current empirical model. The more accurate\nprediction provided by these networks would allow operators at JPL to make more\naccurate predictions of the amount of energy available to the rover when they\nplan activities for coming sols.\n", "  The ETAS model is widely employed to model the spatio-temporal distribution\nof earthquakes, generally using spatially invariant parameters. We propose an\nefficient method for the estimation of spatially varying parameters, using the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and spatial Voronoi tessellation\nensembles. We use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to rank inverted\nmodels given their likelihood and complexity and select the best models to\nfinally compute an ensemble model at any location. Using a synthetic catalog,\nwe also check that the proposed method correctly inverts the known parameters.\nWe apply the proposed method to earthquakes included in the ANSS catalog that\noccurred within the time period 1981-2015 in a spatial polygon around\nCalifornia. The results indicate a significant spatial variation of the ETAS\nparameters. We find that the efficiency of earthquakes to trigger future ones\n(quantified by the branching ratio) positively correlates with surface heat\nflow. In contrast, the rate of earthquakes triggered by far-field tectonic\nloading or background seismicity rate shows no such correlation, suggesting the\nrelevance of triggering possibly through fluid-induced activation. Furthermore,\nthe branching ratio and background seismicity rate are found to be uncorrelated\nwith hypocentral depths, indicating that the seismic coupling remains invariant\nof hypocentral depths in the study region. Additionally, triggering seems to be\nmostly dominated by small earthquakes. Consequently, the static stress change\nstudies should not only focus on the Coulomb stress changes caused by specific\nmoderate to large earthquakes but also account for the secondary static stress\nchanges caused by smaller earthquakes.\n", "  To obtain the spin period of the white dwarf in the intermediate polar V2069\nCyg with high precision, we fulfilled extensive photometry. Observations were\nperformed within 32 nights, which have a total duration of 119 hours and cover\n15 months. We found the spin period of the white dwarf, which is equal to\n743.40650+/-0.00048 s. Using our precise spin period, we derived the\noscillation ephemeris with a long validity of 36 years. This ephemeris and the\nprecise spin period can be used for future investigations of spin period\nchanges of the white dwarf in V2069 Cyg. In addition, for the first time we\ndetected the sideband oscillation with a period of 764.5125+/-0.0049 s. The\nspin and sideband oscillations revealed unstable amplitudes both in a\ntime-scale of days and in a time-scale of years. On average, the semi-amplitude\nof the spin oscillation varied from 17 mmag in 2014 to 25 mmag in 2015. The\nsemi-amplitude of the sideband oscillation varied from 12 mmag in 2014 to an\nundetectable level of less than 7 mmag in 2015. In a time-scale of years, the\noptical spin pulse profile revealed essential changes from an asymmetric\ndouble-peaked shape in 2014 to a quasi-sinusoidal shape in 2015. Such drastic\nchanges of the optical spin pulse profile seem untypical of most intermediate\npolars and, therefore, are of great interest. The pulse profile of the sideband\noscillation was quasi-sinusoidal. Moreover, we note that V2069 Cyg possesses\nstrong flickering with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.4-0.6 mag.\n", "  We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on analytic spacetimes with an analytic\nCauchy surface. In this setting, we prove the existence of pure analytic\nHadamard states. The proof is based on considering an elliptic operator\nobtained by Wick rotating the Klein-Gordon operator in a neighborhood of a\nCauchy hypersurface. The Cauchy data of Hadamard two-point functions are\nconstructed as Calder\\'{o}n projectors (suitably generalized if the\nhypersurface is non-compact) for the elliptic operator.\n", "  Dedicated application-specific CT systems are popular solutions to\nhigh-resolution clinical needs. Some applications, such as mammography and\nextremities imaging, require spatial resolution beyond current capabilities.\nThorough understanding of system properties may help tailor system design,\nacquisition protocols, and reconstruction algorithms to improve image quality.\nUsing a high-fidelity measurement model, we analyze the effects of\nshift-variant focal spot blur due to depth-dependence and anode angulation on\nimage quality throughout the three-dimensional field of view of a simulated\nextremities scanner. A model of the shift-variant blur associated with this\ndevice is then incorporated into a Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR)\nalgorithm, which is then compared to FDK and MBIR with simpler blur models at\nselect locations throughout the field of view. We show that shift-variant focal\nspot blur leads to location-dependent imaging performance. Furthermore,\nchanging the orientation of the X-ray tube alters this spatial dependence. The\nanalysis suggests methods to improve imaging performance based on specific\nimage quality needs. The results also demonstrate that image quality can be\nimproved by combining accurate blur modeling with MBIR. Specifically, across\nthe entire field of view, MBIR with shift-variant blur modeling yielded the\nbest image quality, followed by MBIR with a shift-invariant blur model, MBIR\nwith an identity blur model, and FDK, respectively. These results suggest a\nnumber of opportunities for the optimization of imaging system performance in\nthe hardware setup, the imaging protocol, and the reconstruction approach.\nWhile the high-fidelity models used here are applied using the specifications\nof a dedicated extremities imaging system, the methods are general and may be\napplied to optimize imaging performance in any CT system.\n"]}
