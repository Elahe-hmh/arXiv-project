pointlike planet. We work in the\nquadrupole approximation. We consider the solution in which the center of mass\nof the body moves on a circular orbit, and the body rotates in a synchronous\nway about its axis, so that it always shows the same face to the planet as the\nMoon does with the Earth. We prove that if any internal deformation of the body\ndissipates some energy, then such an orbit is locally asymptotically stable.\nThe proof is based on the construction of a suitable system of coordinates and\non the use of LaSalle's principle. A large part of the paper is devoted to the\nanalysis of the kinematics of an elastic body interacting with a gravitational\nfield. We think this could have some interest in itself.\n", "  The remnants of Type Ia supernovae can provide important clues about their\nprogenitor-histories. We discuss two well-observed supernova remnants (SNRs)\nthat are believed to result from a Type Ia SN and use various tools to shed\nlight on the possible progenitor history. We find that Kepler's SNR is\nconsistent with a symbiotic binary progenitor consisted of a white dwarf and an\nAGB star. Our hydrosimulations can reproduce the observed kinematic and\nmorphological properties. For Tycho's remnant we use the characteristics of the\nX-ray spectrum and the kinematics to show that the ejecta has likely interacted\nwith dense circumstellar gas.\n", "  We report on the systematic investigation of the role of surface nanoscale\nroughness and morphology on the charging behaviour of nanostructured titania\n(TiO2) surfaces in aqueous solutions. IsoElectric Points (IEPs) of surfaces\nhave been characterized by direct measurement of the electrostatic double layer\ninteractions between titania surfaces and the micrometer-sized spherical silica\nprobe of an atomic force microscope in NaCl aqueous electrolyte. The use of a\ncolloidal probe provides well-defined interaction geometry and allows\neffectively probing the overall effect of nanoscale morphology. By using\nsupersonic cluster beam deposition to fabricate nanostructured titania films,\nwe achieved a quantitative control over the surface morphological parameters.\nWe performed a systematical exploration of the electrical double layer\nproperties in different interaction regimes characterized by different ratios\nof characteristic nanometric lengths of the system: the surface rms roughness\nRq, the correlation length {\\xi} and the Debye length {\\lambda}D. We observed a\nremarkable reduction by several pH units of IEP on rough nanostructured\nsurfaces, with respect to flat crystalline rutile TiO2. In order to explain the\nobserved behavior of IEP, we consider the roughness-induced self-overlap of the\nelectrical double layers as a potential source of deviation from the trend\nexpected for flat surfaces.\n", "  We analyze the results of a 2 years (2011--2012) time series of night sky\nphotometry performed at the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam\n(AIP). This observatory is located on top of a hill (\"Babelsberg\"), 22\\,km to\nthe southwest of the center of Berlin. The measurements have been performed\nwith a Unihedron Sky Quality Meter. We find night sky brightness values ranging\nfrom 16.5 to 20.3 mag$_{\\rm SQM}$ arcsec$^{-2}$; the latter (best) value\ncorresponds to 4.7 times the natural zenithal night sky brightness. We discuss\nthe influence of clouds, of the Moon and other factors on the night sky\nbrightness. With respect to the influence of the Moon, it turns out that\nPotsdam-Babelsberg, despite its proximity to Berlin, still shows a circalunar\nperiodicity of the night sky brightness, although it is much weaker than\nnaturally. The light-pollution-enhancing effect of clouds dominates the night\nsky brightness by far. Overcast nights with light pollution (up to 16.5\nmag$_{\\rm SQM}$ arcsec$^{-2}$) are brighter than clear full moon nights\n($\\approx$ 18.5 mag$_{\\rm SQM}$ arcsec$^{-2}$) in roughly the same proportion\nas the latter compared to clear nights with light pollution (20.3 mag$_{\\rm\nSQM}$ arcsec$^{-2}$).\n", "  A density functional theory study of the BiS$_{2}$ superconductors containing\nrare-earths: \\textit{Ln}O$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$ (\\textit{Ln} = La, Ce, Pr,\nand Nd) is presented. We find that CeO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ has competing\nferromagnetic and weak antiferromagnetic tendencies, the first one\ncorresponding to experimental results. We show that\nPrO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ has a strong tendency for magnetic order, which\ncan be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on subtle differences in\n4$f$ orbital occupations. We demonstrate that NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ has\na stable magnetic ground state with weak tendency to order. Finally, we show\nthat the change of rare earth does not affect the Fermi surface, and predict\nthat CeOBiS$_{2}$ should display a pressure induced phase transition to a\nmetallic, if not superconducting, phase under pressure.\n", "  We present heuristic arguments that hint to a possible connection of Lorentz\nviolation with observed phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Various\nreferences from condensed matter literature are cited where operators in the\nStandard Model Extension appear to be enhanced. Furthermore, we consider the\nLevy-Leblond equation, which is the analogue of Dirac equation in\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that we can obtain the Levy-Leblond\nequation by adding enhanced Lorentz violating operators to the Dirac equation.\nBased on these observations, we propose that Lorentz violation exhibits itself\nin non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  This paper proposes an Extended-Kalman-Filter-like observer for parameter\nestimation during synchronization of chaotic systems. The exponential stability\nof the observer is guaranteed by a persistent excitation condition. This\napproach is shown to be suitable for various classical chaotic systems and\nseveral simulations are presented accordingly.\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has a great potential as a tool to characterize\nmechanical and morphological properties of living cells; these properties have\nbeen shown to correlate with cells' fate and patho-physiological state in view\nof the development of novel early-diagnostic strategies. Although several\nreports have described experimental and technical approaches for the\ncharacterization of cell elasticity by means of AFM, a robust and commonly\naccepted methodology is still lacking. Here we show that micrometric spherical\nprobes (also known as colloidal probes) are well suited for performing a\ncombined topographic and mechanical analysis of living cells, with spatial\nresolution suitable for a complete and accurate mapping of cell morphological\nand elastic properties, and superior reliability and accuracy in the mechanical\nmeasurements with respect to conventional and widely used sharp AFM tips. We\naddress a number of issues concerning the nanomechanical analysis, including\nthe applicability of contact mechanical models and the impact of a constrained\ncontact geometry on the measured elastic modulus (the finite-thickness effect).\nWe have tested our protocol by imaging living PC12 and MDA-MB-231 cells, in\norder to demonstrate the importance of the correction of the finite-thickness\neffect and the change in cell elasticity induced by the action of a\ncytoskeleton-targeting drug.\n", "  The most promising method for measuring primordial non-Gaussianity in the\npost-Planck era is to detect large-scale, scale-dependent galaxy bias.\nConsidering the information in the galaxy power spectrum, we here derive the\nproperties of a galaxy clustering survey that would optimize constraints on\nprimordial non-Gaussianity using this technique. Specifically, we ask the\nquestion what survey design is needed to reach a precision $\\sigma(f_{\\rm\nNL}^{\\rm loc}) \\approx 1$. To answer this question, we calculate the\nsensitivity to $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ as a function of galaxy number density,\nredshift accuracy and sky coverage. We include the multitracer technique, which\nhelps minimize cosmic variance noise, by considering the possibility of\ndividing the galaxy sample into stellar mass bins. We show that the ideal\nsurvey for $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ looks very different than most galaxy\nredshift surveys scheduled for the near future. Since those are more or less\noptimized for measuring the BAO scale, they typically require spectroscopic\nredshifts. On the contrary, to optimize the $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ measurement,\na deep, wide, multi-band imaging survey is preferred. An uncertainty\n$\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}) = 1$ can be reached with a full-sky survey that\nis complete to an $i$-band AB magnitude $i \\approx 23$ and has a number density\n$\\sim 8$ arcmin$^{-2}$. Requirements on the multi-band photometry are set by a\nmodest photo-$z$ accuracy $\\sigma(z)/(1+z) < 0.1$ and the ability to measure\nstellar mass with a precision $\\sim 0.2$ dex or better (or another proxy for\nhalo mass with equivalent scatter). While here we focus on the information in\nthe power spectrum, even stronger constraints can potentially be obtained with\nthe galaxy bispectrum.\n", "  The MIMAC experiment is a $\\mu$-TPC matrix project for directional dark\nmatter search. Directional detection is a strategy based on the measurement of\nthe WIMP flux anisotropy due to the solar system motion with respect to the\ndark matter halo. The main purpose of MIMAC project is the measurement of the\nenergy and the direction of nuclear recoils in 3D produced by elastic\nscattering of WIMPs. Since June 2012 a bi-chamber prototype is operating at the\nModane underground laboratory. In this paper, we report the first ionization\nenergy and 3D track observations of nuclear recoils produced by the radon\nprogeny. This measurement shows the capability of the MIMAC detector and opens\nthe possibility to explore the low energy recoil directionality signature.\n", "  Monogamy is a nonclassical property that limits the distribution of quantum\ncorrelation among subparts of a multiparty system. We show that monogamy scores\nfor different quantum correlation measures are bounded above by functions of\ngenuine multipartite entanglement for a large majority of pure multiqubit\nstates. The bound is universal for all three-qubit pure states. We derive\nnecessary conditions to characterize the states that violate the bound, which\ncan also be observed by numerical simulation for a small set of states,\ngenerated Haar uniformly. The results indicate that genuine multipartite\nentanglement restricts the distribution of bipartite quantum correlations in a\nmultiparty system.\n", "  We present a perturbative QCD factorization formula for substructures of an\nenergetic Higgs jet, taking the energy profile resulting from the $H\\to b\\bar\nb$ decay as an example. The formula is written as a convolution of a hard Higgs\ndecay kernel with two $b$-quark jet functions and a soft function that links\nthe colors of the two $b$ quarks. We derive an analytical expression to\napproximate the energy profile within a boosted Higgs jet, which significantly\ndiffers from those of ordinary QCD jets. This formalism also extends to boosted\n$W$ and $Z$ bosons in their hadronic decay modes, allowing an easy and\nefficient discrimination of fat jets produced from different processes.\n", "  Great emphasis is placed on the development of integrated approaches for the\nsynthesis and the characterization of ad hoc nanostructured platforms, to be\nused as templates with controlled morphology and chemical properties for the\ninvestigation of specific phenomena of great relevance for technological\napplications in interdisciplinary fields such as biotechnology, medicine and\nadvanced materials. Here we discuss the crucial role and the advantages of thin\nfilm deposition strategies based on cluster-assembling from supersonic cluster\nbeams. We select cluster-assembled nanostructured titania (ns-TiO2) as a case\nstudy to demonstrate that accurate control over morphological parameters can be\nroutinely achieved, and consequently over several relevant interfacial\nproperties and phenomena, like surface charging in a liquid electrolyte, and\nproteins and nanoparticles adsorption.\n", "  We provide a complete quantization for the Gowdy model with local rotational\nsymmetry in vacuum. We start with a redefinition of the classical constraint\nalgebra such that the Hamiltonian constraint has a vanishing Poisson bracket\nwith itself. We apply a canonical quantization within loop quantum gravity and\nan improved dynamics scheme. We construct the exact solutions to the\nconstraints and the physical Hilbert space, together with the physical\nobservables. The quantization provides a physical picture without\nsingularities. Besides, a genuine discretization of the spatial geometry\nemerges by means of a new quantum observable without classical analogue.\n", "  This work is the first step towards understanding thermionic transport\nproperties of graphene/phosphorene/graphene van der Waals heterostructures in\ncontact with gold electrodes by using density functional theory based first\nprinciples calculations combined with real space Green's function formalism. We\nshow that for monolayer phosphorene in the heterostructure, quantum tunneling\ndominates the transport. By adding more phosphorene layers, one can switch from\ntunneling dominated transport to thermionic dominated transport, resulting in\ntransporting more heat per charge carrier, thus, enhancing the cooling\ncoefficient of performance. The thermionic coefficient of performance for the\nproposed device is 18.5 at 600 K corresponding to an equivalent ZT of 0.13,\nwhich is significant for nanoscale devices.\n", "  The two-loop renormalization group flow is studied via the induced bracket\nflow on 3D unimodular Lie groups. A number of steady solitons are found. Some\nof these steady solitons come from maximally symmetric metrics that are steady,\nshrinking, or expanding solitons under Ricci flow, while others are not\nobviously related to Ricci flow solitons.\n", "  In this paper, we present in detail consistent QED (and scalar QED)\ncalculations of particle creation effects in external electromagnetic field\nthat correspond to three most important exactly solvable cases of t-electric\npotential steps: Sauter-like electric field, T-constant electric field, and\nexponentially growing and decaying electric fields. In all these cases, we\nsucceeded to obtain new results, such as calculations in modified\nconfigurations of the above mentioned steps and detailed considerations of new\nlimiting cases in already studied before steps. As was recently discovered by\nus, the information derived from considerations of exactly solvable cases\nallows one to make some general conclusions about quantum effects in fields for\nwhich no closed form solutions of the Dirac (or Klein-Gordon) equation are\nknown. In the present article we briefly represent such conclusions about an\nuniversal behavior of vacuum mean values in slowly varying strong electric\nfields.\n", "  We theoretically report that, with \\textit{in-plane} magnetization, the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) can be realized in two-dimensional atomic\ncrystal layers with preserved inversion symmetry but broken out-of-plane mirror\nreflection symmetry. We take the honeycomb lattice as an example, where we find\nthat the low-buckled structure, which makes the system satisfy the symmetric\ncriteria, is crucial to induce QAHE. The topologically nontrivial bulk gap\ncarrying a Chern number of $\\mathcal{C}=\\pm1$ opens in the vicinity of the\nsaddle points $M$, where the band dispersion exhibits strong anisotropy. We\nfurther show that the QAHE with electrically tunable Chern number can be\nachieved in Bernal-stacked multilayer systems, and the applied interlayer\npotential differences can dramatically decrease the critical magnetization to\nmake the QAHE experimentally feasible.\n", "  Sparse inversion of gravity data based on $L_1$-norm regularization is\ndiscussed. An iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is used to solve\nthe problem. At each iteration the solution of a linear system of equations and\nthe determination of a suitable regularization parameter are considered. The\nLSQR iteration is used to project the system of equations onto a smaller\nsubspace that inherits the ill-conditioning of the full space problem. We show\nthat the gravity kernel is only mildly to moderately ill-conditioned. Thus,\nwhile the dominant spectrum of the projected problem accurately approximates\nthe dominant spectrum of the full space problem, the entire spectrum of the\nprojected problem inherits the ill-conditioning of the full problem.\nConsequently, determining the regularization parameter based on the entire\nspectrum of the projected problem necessarily over compensates for the\nnon-dominant portion of the spectrum and leads to inaccurate approximations for\nthe full-space solution. In contrast, finding the regularization parameter\nusing a truncated singular space of the projected operator is efficient and\neffective. Simulations for synthetic examples with noise demonstrate the\napproach using the method of unbiased predictive risk estimation for the\ntruncated projected spectrum. The method is used on gravity data from the\nMobrun ore body, northeast of Noranda, Quebec, Canada. The $3$-D reconstructed\nmodel is in agreement with known drill-hole information.\n", "  We study the evolution of the two scalar fields entangled via a mutual\ninteraction in an expanding spacetime. We compute the logarithmic negativity to\nleading order in perturbation theory and show that for lowest order in the\ncoupling constants, the mutual interaction will give rise to the survival of\nthe quantum correlations in the limit of the smooth expansion. The results\nsuggest that interacting fields can codify more information about the\nunderlying expansion spacetime and lead to interesting observable effects.\n", "  Two topics are presented. The first one is a novel approach for a Poincare'\ncovariant description of nuclear dynamics based on light-front Hamiltonian\ndynamics. The key quantity is the light-front spectral function, where both\nnormalization and momentum sum rule can be satisfied at the same time.\nPreliminary results are discussed for an initial analysis of the role of\nrelativity in the EMC effect in 3He. A second issue, very challenging, is\nconsidered in a non-relativistic framework, namely a distorted spin-dependent\nspectral function for 3He in order to take care of the final state interaction\nbetween the observed pion and the remnant in semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nelectron scattering off polarized 3He. The generalization of the analysis\nwithin the light-front dynamics is outlined.\n", "  We explore the formation of superbubbles through energy deposition by\nmultiple supernovae (SNe) in a uniform medium. We use total energy conserving,\n3-D hydrodynamic simulations to study how SNe correlated in space and time\ncreate superbubbles. While isolated SNe fizzle out completely by $\\sim 1$ Myr\ndue to radiative losses, for a realistic cluster size it is likely that\nsubsequent SNe go off within the hot/dilute bubble and sustain the shock till\nthe cluster lifetime. For realistic cluster sizes, we find that the bubble\nremains overpressured only if, for a given $n_{g0}$, $N_{\\rm OB}$ is\nsufficiently large. While most of the input energy is still lost radiatively,\nsuperbubbles can retain up to $\\sim 5-10\\%$ of the input energy in form of\nkinetic+thermal energy till 10 Myr for ISM density $n_{g0} \\approx 1$\ncm$^{-3}$. We find that the mechanical efficiency decreases for higher\ndensities ($\\eta_{\\rm mech} \\propto n_{g0}^{-2/3}$). We compare the radii and\nvelocities of simulated supershells with observations and the classical\nadiabatic model. Our simulations show that the superbubbles retain only\n$\\lesssim 10\\%$ of the injected energy, thereby explaining the observed smaller\nsize and slower expansion of supershells. We also confirm that a sufficiently\nlarge ($\\gtrsim 10^4$) number of SNe is required to go off in order to create a\nsteady wind with a stable termination shock within the superbubble. We show\nthat the mechanical efficiency increases with increasing resolution, and that\nexplicit diffusion is required to obtain converged results.\n", "  We study a simple model of a random walker in d dimensions moving in the\npresence of a local heterogeneous attracting factor expressed in terms of an\nassigned space-dependent \"attractiveness function\", a situation frequently\nencountered in the study of various diffusion problems. The corresponding\ndrift-diffusion equation and the explicit expressions for the velocity field\nand the diffusion coefficient are obtained and discussed. We consider some\nexamples of applications of the results obtained to chemotactic diffusion\nprocesses and social dynamics.\n", "  It is known that Wolf constructed a lot of examples of Super Calabi-Yau\ntwistor spaces. We would like to introduce super Poisson structures on them via\nsuper twistor double fibrations. Moreover we define the structure of\ndeformation quantization for such super Poisson manifolds.\n", "  We applied the currently most comprehensive version of the\nstatistical-parallax technique to derive kinematical parameters of the maser\nsample with 136 sources. Our kinematic model comprises the overall rotation of\nthe Galactic disk and the spiral density-wave effects. We take into account the\nvariation of radial velocity dispersion with Galactocentric distance. The best\ndescription of the velocity field is provided by the model with constant radial\nand vertical velocity dispersions, $(\\sigma U0, \\sigma W0) \\approx (9.4 \\pm\n0.9~, 5.9 \\pm 0.8)~ km/s$. We compute flat Galactic rotation curve over the\nGalactocentric distance interval from 3 to 15 kpc and find the local circular\nrotation velocity to be $ V_0 \\approx (235-238)$~ km/s $\\pm 7$~ km/s. We also\ndetermine the parameters of the four-armed spiral pattern (pitch angle $i\n\\approx (-10.4 \\pm 0.3)^\\circ$ and the phase of the Sun $\\chi_0 \\approx (125\n\\pm 10) ^\\circ$). The radial and tangential spiral perturbations are about $f_R\n\\approx (-6.9 \\pm 1.4)$~km/s, $f_\\Theta \\approx (+2.8 \\pm 1.0$) ~km/s. The\nkinematic data yield a solar Galactocentric distance of $R_0 \\approx (8.24 \\pm\n0.12)~kpc$. Based on rotation curve parameters and the asymmetric drift we\nInfer the exponential disk scale $H_D \\approx (2.7 \\pm 0.2)$ ~kpc under\nassumption of marginal stability of the intermediate-age disk, and finally we\nestimate the minimum local surface disk density, $\\Sigma (R_0) > (26 \\pm 3) ~\nM_\\odot pc^{-2}$.\n", "  The classification of topological phases of matter in the presence of\ninteractions is an area of intense interest. One possible means of\nclassification is via studying the partition function under modular transforms,\nas the presence of an anomalous phase arising in the edge theory of a\nD-dimensional system under modular transformation, or modular anomaly, signals\nthe presence of a (D+1)-D non-trivial bulk. In this work, we discuss the\nmodular transformations of conformal field theories along a (2+1)-D and a\n(3+1)-D edge. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show that chiral\ncomplex free fermions in (2+1)-D and (3+1)-D are modular invariant. However, we\nshow in (3+1)-D that when the edge theory is coupled to a background U(1) gauge\nfield this results in the presence of a modular anomaly that is the\nmanifestation of a quantum Hall effect in a (4+1)-D bulk. Using the modular\nanomaly, we find that the edge theory of (4+1)-D insulator with spacetime\ninversion symmetry(P*T) and fermion number parity symmetry for each spin\nbecomes modular invariant when 8 copies of the edges exist.\n", "  In the last few years charge density waves (CDWs) have been ubiquitously\nobserved in high-temperature superconducting cuprates and are now the most\ninvestigated among the competing orders in the still hot debate on these\nsystems. A wealth of new experimental data raise several fundamental issues\nthat challenge the various theoretical proposals. Here, we account for the\ncomplex experimental temperature vs. doping phase diagram and we provide a\ncoherent scenario explaining why different CDW onset curves are observed by\ndifferent experimental probes and seem to extrapolate at zero temperature into\nseemingly different quantum critical points (QCPs) in the intermediate and\noverdoped region. We also account for the pseudogap and its onset temperature\nT*(p) on the basis of dynamically fluctuating CDWs. The nearly singular\nanisotropic scattering mediated by these fluctuations also account for the\nrapid changes of the Hall number seen in experiments and provides the first\nnecessary step for a possible Fermi surface reconstruction fully establishing\nat lower doping. Finally we show that phase fluctuations of the CDWs, which are\nenhanced in the presence of strong correlations near the Mott insulating phase,\nnaturally account for the disappearance of the CDWs at low doping with yet\nanother QCP.\n", "  We have characterized the photodetection capabilities of single GaN nanowires\nincorporating 20 periods of AlN/GaN:Ge axial heterostructures enveloped in an\nAlN shell. Transmission electron microscopy confirms the absence of an\nadditional GaN shell around the heterostructures. In the absence of a surface\nconduction channel, the incorporation of the heterostructure leads to a\ndecrease of the dark current and an increase of the photosensitivity. A\nsignificant dispersion in the magnitude of dark currents for different single\nnanowires is attributed to the coalescence of nanowires with displaced\nnanodisks, reducing the effective length of the heterostructure. A larger\nnumber of active nanodisks and AlN barriers in the current path results in\nlower dark current and higher photosensitivity, and improves the sensitivity of\nthe nanowire to variations in the illumination intensity (improved linearity).\nAdditionally, we observe a persistence of the photocurrent, which is attributed\nto a change of the resistance of the overall structure, particularly the GaN\nstem and cap sections. In consequence, the time response is rather independent\nof the dark current.\n", "  This is a brief overview of the current status of symmetry reduced models in\nLoop Quantum Gravity (LQG), focussing on the very early universe. Over the last\n3 years or so the subject has matured sufficiently to make direct contact with\nobservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In particular, thanks to\nan unforeseen interplay between the ultraviolet features of quantum geometry\nand the infrared properties of quantum fields representing cosmological\nperturbations, \\emph{Planck scale effects} of LQG can leave imprints on CMB\n\\emph{at the largest angular scales}. In addition to a summary of these\nresults, the article also contains a critical discussion of the symmetry\nreduction procedure used in discussions of quantum cosmology (and quantum black\nholes).\n", "  We present N/O abundance ratios, ionization parameters {$q_{\\rm ion}$}, and\noxygen abundance O/H for a total of 41 galaxies (11 individual galaxies and a\n30-galaxy stack) including {Ly$\\alpha$} emitters and Lyman break galaxies at\n$z\\sim 2$, and investigate galaxy evolution from $z\\sim 0$ to $2$ in\nconjunction with 208,529 local SDSS galaxies and 9 green pea galaxies (GPs). In\ncontrast with most of the recent studies, we obtain the N/O ratio, {$q_{\\rm\nion}$}, and O/H measurements by direct $T_{\\rm e}$ methods with\n{[O\\,\\textsc{iii}]} $\\lambda$4363 and {O\\,\\textsc{iii}]} $\\lambda$1665 lines.\nBased on these reliable measurements, we find that there exist $z\\sim 2$\ngalaxies with an excess of N/O falling beyond the local average of N/O--O/H\nrelation, while the majority of the $z\\sim 2$ galaxies have the N/O ratios\nnearly comparable with $z\\sim 0$ galaxies in the N/O--stellar mass relation.\nOur galaxies place the upper limit of N/O ratio $\\log ({\\rm N/O})\\le -1.26$ on\naverage, suggesting that the N/O ratio evolves, if at all, by $<0.17$ dex.\nExploiting our reliable measurements free from the N/O--{$q_{\\rm ion}$}--O/H\ndegeneracies, we identify, for the first time, that $z\\sim 2$ galaxies with\noffsets in the BPT diagram indicate either 1) only an N/O excess, 2) only a\n{$q_{\\rm ion}$} excess, or 3) both N/O and {$q_{\\rm ion}$} excesses. We argue\nthat the BPT offsets at $z\\sim 2$ are not made by one of 1)--3) galaxy\npopulations alone, but the composite of 1)--3) populations. We confirm that\nthese 1)--3) populations also exist at $z\\sim 0$, such as GPs and SDSS low-mass\nand high-SFR galaxies (LMHSs).\n", "  In this paper we seek a relationship between the assumption of conformal\nsymmetry and the exotic matter needed to hold a wormhole open. By starting with\na Morris-Thorne wormhole having a constant energy density, it is shown that the\nconformal factor provides the extra degree of freedom sufficient to account for\nthe exotic matter. The same holds for Morris-Thorne wormholes in a\nnoncommutative-geometry setting. Applied to thin shells, there would exist a\nradius that results in a wormhole with positive surface density and negative\nsurface pressure and which violates the null energy condition on the thin\nshell.\n", "  We use large-scale computer simulations to explore the non-equilibrium aging\ndynamics in a microscopic model for colloidal gels. We find that gelation\nresulting from a kinetically-arrested phase separation is accompanied by\n`anomalous' particle dynamics revealed by superdiffusive particle motion and\ncompressed exponential relaxation of time correlation functions.\nSpatio-temporal analysis of the dynamics reveals intermittent heterogeneities\nproducing spatial correlations over extremely large length scales. Our study is\nthe first microscopically-resolved model reproducing all features of the\nspontaneous aging dynamics observed experimentally in soft materials.\n", "  We compile observations of early-type binaries identified via spectroscopy,\neclipses, long-baseline interferometry, adaptive optics, common proper motion,\netc. Each observational technique is sensitive to companions across a narrow\nparameter space of orbital periods P and mass ratios q = M_comp/M_1. After\ncombining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their\nrespective selection effects, we find the properties of companions to O-type\nand B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short\norbital periods P < 20 days (separations a < 0.4 AU), the binaries have small\neccentricities e < 0.4, favor modest mass ratios <q> = 0.5, and exhibit a small\nexcess of twins q > 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate\nperiods log P (days) = 3.5 (a = 10 AU), where the binaries have mass ratios\nweighted toward small values q = 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian \"thermal\"\neccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P\n(days) = 5.5-7.5 (a = 200-5,000 AU) are outer tertiary components in\nhierarchical triples, and have a mass ratio distribution across q = 0.1-1.0\nthat is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass\nfunction. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the\ncontext of binary star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary\nstatistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that (30+/-10)% of\nsingle-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions\ninstead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar\ncompanions with q > 0.1 and log P (days) < 8.0 per primary increases from\n0.50+/-0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1+/-0.3 for O-type MS primaries.\nWe fit joint probability density functions f(M_1,q,P,e) to the corrected\ndistributions, which can be incorporated into binary population synthesis\nstudies.\n", "  We present the analysis and results of a spectroscopic follow-up program of a\nmass-selected sample of six galaxies at 3 < z < 4 using data from Keck-NIRSPEC\nand VLT-Xshooter. We confirm the z > 3 redshifts for half of the sample through\nthe detection of strong nebular emission lines, and improve the zphot accuracy\nfor the remainder of the sample through the combination of photometry and\nspectra. The modeling of the emission-line-corrected spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) adopting improved redshifts confirms the very large\nstellar masses of the sample (M_* ~ 1.5-4 x 10^11 Msun) in the first 2 Gyrs of\ncosmic history, with a diverse range in stellar ages, star formation rates and\ndust content. From the analysis of emission line luminosities and widths, and\nfar-infrared (FIR) fluxes we confirm that >80% of the sample are hosts to\nluminous hidden active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with bolometric luminosities of\n~10^(44-46) erg/s. We find that the MIPS 24um photometry is largely\ncontaminated by AGN continuum, rendering the SFRs derived using only 24um\nphotometry to be severely overestimated. By including the emission from the AGN\nin the modeling of the UV-to-FIR SEDs, we confirm that the presence of the AGN\ndoes not bias considerably the stellar masses (< 0.3 dex at 1\\sigma). We show\nevidence for a rapid increase of the AGN fraction from ~30% to ~60-100% over\nthe 1 Gyr between z~2 and z~3. Although we cannot exclude some enhancement of\nthe AGN fraction for our sample due to selection effects, the small measured\n[OIII] contamination to the observed K-band fluxes suggests that our sample is\nnot significantly biased toward massive galaxies hosting AGNs.\n", "  We study a model fractional quantum Hall (FQH) wavefunction called the\nGaffnian state, which is believed to represent a gapless, strongly correlated\nstate that is very different from conventional metals. To understand this\nexotic gapless state better, we provide a representation based on work of\nHalperin in which the pairing structure of the Gaffnian state becomes more\nexplicit. We employ the single-mode approximation introduced by Girvin,\nMacDonald, and Platzman (GMP), here extended to three-body interactions, in\norder to treat a neutral collective exitation mode in order to clarify the\nphysical origin of the gaplessness of the Gaffnian state. We discuss approaches\nto extract systematically the relevant physics in the long-distance,\nlarge-electron-number limit of FQH states using numerical calculations with\nrelatively few electrons. In an appendix, we provide second quantized\nexpressions for many-body Haldane pseudopotentials in various geometries\nincluding the plane, sphere, cylinder, and the torus based on the proper\ndefinition of the relative angular momentum.\n", "  This paper introduces EGG, the Empirical Galaxy Generator, a tool designed\nwithin the ASTRODEEP collaboration to generate mock galaxy catalogs for deep\nfields with realistic fluxes and simple morphologies. The simulation procedure\nis based exclusively on empirical prescriptions -- rather than first principles\n-- to provide the most accurate match with observations at 0<z<7. In\nparticular, we consider that galaxies can be either quiescent or star-forming,\nand use their stellar mass (M*) and redshift (z) as the fundamental properties\nfrom which all the other observables can be statistically derived. Drawing z\nand M* from the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, we associate a star\nformation rate (SFR) to each galaxy from the tight SFR-M* main sequence, while\ndust attenuation, optical colors and morphologies (including bulge-to-total\nratios, sizes and aspect ratios) are obtained from empirical relations that we\nestablish from the high quality Hubble and Herschel observations available in\nthe CANDELS fields. Random scatter is introduced in each step to reproduce the\nobserved distributions of each parameter. Based on these observables, a\npanchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for each galaxy and\nsynthetic photometry is produced by integrating the redshifted SED in common\nbroad-band filters. Finally, the mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random\npositions with a fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement\nbasic clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the observed\nnumber counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet up to the sub-millimeter,\nand can be directly fed to image simulators such as Skymaker. The images can\nthen be used to test source extraction softwares and image-based techniques\nsuch as stacking. EGG is open-source, and is made available to the community\ntogether with a set of pre-generated catalogs and images.\n", "  We investigate the role of the nuclear spin quantum dynamics in\nhyperfine-induced spin relaxation of hopping carriers in organic\nsemiconductors. The fast hopping regime with a small carrier spin precession\nduring a waiting time between hops is typical for organic semiconductors\npossessing long spin coherence times. We consider this regime and focus on a\ncarrier random walk diffusion in one dimension, where the effect of the nuclear\nspin dynamics is expected to be the strongest. Exact numerical simulations of\nspin systems with up to 25 nuclear spins are performed using the Suzuki-Trotter\ndecomposition of evolution operator. Larger nuclear spin systems are modeled\nutilizing the spin-coherent state $P$-representation approach developed\nearlier. We find that the nuclear spin dynamics strongly influences the carrier\nspin relaxation at long times. If the random walk is restricted to a small\narea, it leads to the quenching of carrier spin polarization at a non-zero\nvalue at long times. If the random walk is unrestricted, the carrier spin\npolarization acquires a long-time tail, decaying as $ 1/\\sqrt{t}$. Based on the\nnumerical results, we devise a simple formula describing the effect\nquantitatively.\n", "  Standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure\nassume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This\nassumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make\ninference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead\nABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring\nthe distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC\nis feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of\nthe halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos\nwith galaxies.\n  Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo\nimportance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance\nmetric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and\ngalaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock\nobservation generated from selected \"true\" HOD parameters. The parameter\nconstraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the \"true\" HOD parameters,\ndemonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS.\nFurthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a\npseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD\nparameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should\nbe applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.\n", "  TARGET~5 is a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) of the\nTARGET family, designed for the readout of signals from photosensors in the\ncameras of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) for ground-based\ngamma-ray astronomy. TARGET~5 combines sampling and digitization on 16 signal\nchannels with the formation of trigger signals based on the analog sum of\ngroups of four channels. We describe the ASIC architecture and performance.\nTARGET~5 improves over the performance of the first-generation TARGET ASIC,\nachieving: tunable sampling frequency from $<0.4$~GSa/s to $>1$~GSa/s; a\ndynamic range on the data path of 1.2 V with effective dynamic range of 11~bits\nand DC noise of ${\\sim}0.6$~mV; 3-dB bandwidth of 500 MHz; crosstalk between\nadjacent channels $<1.3\\%$; charge resolution improving from 40\\% to $<4\\%$\nbetween 3 photoelectrons (p.e.) and $>100$~p.e. (assuming 4 mV per p.e.); and\nminimum stable trigger threshold of 20 mV (5 p.e.) with trigger noise of 5 mV\n(1.2 p.e.), which is mostly limited by interference between trigger and\nsampling operations. TARGET~5 is the first ASIC of the TARGET family used in an\nIACT prototype, providing one development path for readout electronics in the\nforthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\n", "  We present a configuration-space model of the large-scale galaxy 3-point\ncorrelation function (3PCF) based on leading-order perturbation theory and\nincluding redshift space distortions (RSD). This model should be useful in\nextracting distance-scale information from the 3PCF via the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) method. We include the first redshift-space treatment of\nbiasing by the baryon-dark matter relative velocity. Overall, on large scales\nthe effect of RSD is primarily a renormalization of the 3PCF that is roughly\nindependent of both physical scale and triangle opening angle; for our adopted\n$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and bias values, the rescaling is a factor of $\\sim 1.8$. We\nalso present an efficient scheme for computing 3PCF predictions from our model,\nimportant for allowing fast exploration of the space of cosmological parameters\nin future analyses.\n", "  Magnetization curves of the ferrimagnetic mixed spin-(1/2,S) Heisenberg\nchains are calculated with the help of density-matrix renormalization group\nmethod for several quantum spin numbers S=1, 3/2, 2 and 5/2. It is shown that\nthe ferrimagnetic mixed spin-(1/2,S) Heisenberg chains exhibit irrespective of\nthe spin value S exactly one intermediate magnetization plateau, which can be\nidentified with the gapped Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic ground state. The\nmagnetization plateau due to the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetism breaks down at a\nquantum phase transition towards the Luttinger spin liquid, which is\ncharacterized by a continuous change of the magnetization with the magnetic\nfield until another quantum critical point is reached at the saturation field.\n", "  We present the large-scale 3-point correlation function (3PCF) of the SDSS\nDR12 CMASS sample of $777,202$ Luminous Red Galaxies, the largest-ever sample\nused for a 3PCF or bispectrum measurement. We make the first high-significance\n($4.5\\sigma$) detection of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the 3PCF.\nUsing these acoustic features in the 3PCF as a standard ruler, we measure the\ndistance to $z=0.57$ to $1.7\\%$ precision (statistical plus systematic). We\nfind $D_{\\rm V}= 2024\\pm29\\;{\\rm Mpc\\;(stat)}\\pm20\\;{\\rm Mpc\\;(sys)}$ for our\nfiducial cosmology (consistent with Planck 2015) and bias model. This\nmeasurement extends the use of the BAO technique from the 2-point correlation\nfunction (2PCF) and power spectrum to the 3PCF and opens an avenue for deriving\nadditional cosmological distance information from future large-scale structure\nredshift surveys such as DESI. Our measured distance scale from the 3PCF is\nfairly independent from that derived from the pre-reconstruction 2PCF and is\nequivalent to increasing the length of BOSS by roughly 10\\%; reconstruction\nappears to lower the independence of the distance measurements. Fitting a model\nincluding tidal tensor bias yields a moderate significance ($2.6\\sigma)$\ndetection of this bias with a value in agreement with the prediction from local\nLagrangian biasing.\n", "  We argue that the presence of conformal anomalies in gravitational theories\ncan lead to observable modifications to Einstein's equations via the induced\nanomalous effective actions, whose non-localities can overwhelm the smallness\nof the Planck scale. The fact that no such effects have been seen in recent\ncosmological or gravitational wave observations therefore imposes strong\nrestrictions on the field content of possible extensions of Einstein's theory:\nall viable theories should have vanishing conformal anomalies. We then show\nthat a complete cancellation of conformal anomalies in D=4 for both the $C^2$\ninvariant and the Euler (Gauss-Bonnet) invariant can only be achieved for\nN-extended supergravities with $N \\geq 5$, as well as for M theory compactified\nto four dimensions.\n", "  We consider a non-local shape optimization problem, which is motivated by a\nsimple model for swarming and other self-assembly/aggregation models, and prove\nthe existence of different phases. A technical key ingredient, which we\nestablish, is that a strictly subharmonic function cannot be constant on a set\nof positive measure.\n", "  We use wavelet and curvelet transforms to extract signals of cosmic strings\nfrom cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropy maps, and to\nstudy the limits on the cosmic string tension which various ongoing CMB\ntemperature anisotropy experiments will be able to achieve. We construct sky\nmaps with size and angular resolution corresponding to various experiments.\nThese maps contain the signals of a scaling solution of long string segments\nwith a given string tension $G \\mu$, the contribution of the dominant Gaussian\nprimordial cosmological fluctuations, and pixel by pixel white noise with an\namplitude corresponding to the instrumental noise of the various experiments.\nIn the case that we include white noise, we find that the curvelets are more\npowerful than wavelets. For maps with Planck specification, we obtain bounds on\nthe string tension comparable to what was obtained by the Planck collaboration.\nExperiments with better angular resolution such as the South Pole Telescope\nthird generation (SPT-3G) survey will be able to yield stronger limits. For\nmaps with a specification of SPT-3G we find that string signals will be visible\ndown to a string tension of $G \\mu = 1.4 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n", "  We study the behaviour of linear perturbations in multifield coupled\nquintessence models. Using gauge invariant linear cosmological perturbation\ntheory we provide the full set of governing equations for this class of models,\nand solve the system numerically. We apply the numerical code to generate\ngrowth functions for various examples, and compare these both to the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model and to current and future observational bounds. Finally, we\nexamine the applicability of the \"small scale approximation\", often used to\ncalculate growth functions in quintessence models, in light of upcoming\nexperiments such as SKA and Euclid. We find the deviation of the full equation\nresults for large k modes from the approximation exceeds the experimental\nuncertainty for these future surveys. The numerical code, PYESSENCE, written in\nPython will be publicly available.\n", "  Despite being forbidden in equilibrium, spontaneous breaking of time\ntranslation symmetry can occur in periodically driven, Floquet systems with\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry. The period of the resulting discrete time\ncrystal is quantized to an integer multiple of the drive period, arising from a\ncombination of collective synchronization and many body localization. Here, we\nconsider a simple model for a one dimensional discrete time crystal which\nexplicitly reveals the rigidity of the emergent oscillations as the drive is\nvaried. We numerically map out its phase diagram and compute the properties of\nthe dynamical phase transition where the time crystal melts into a trivial\nFloquet insulator. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can be realized with\ncurrent experimental technologies and propose a blueprint based upon a one\ndimensional chain of trapped ions. Using experimental parameters (featuring\nlong-range interactions), we identify the phase boundaries of the\nion-time-crystal and propose a measurable signature of the symmetry breaking\nphase transition.\n", "  We present a numerical code to simulate maps of Galactic emission in\nintensity and polarization at microwave frequencies, aiding in the design of\nCosmic Microwave Background experiments. This Python code builds on existing\nefforts to simulate the sky by providing an easy-to-use interface and is based\non publicly available data from the WMAP and Planck satellite missions. We\nsimulate synchrotron, thermal dust, free-free, and anomalous microwave emission\nover the whole sky, in addition to the Cosmic Microwave Background, and include\na set of alternative prescriptions for the frequency dependence of each\ncomponent that are consistent with current data. We also present a prescription\nfor adding small-scale realizations of these components at resolutions greater\nthan current all-sky measurements. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bthorne93/PySM_public.\n", "  Virtually all interactions that are relevant for atomic and condensed matter\nphysics are mediated by quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field\nvacuum. Consequently, controlling the vacuum fluctuations can be used to\nengineer the strength and the range of interactions. Recent experiments have\nused this premise to demonstrate novel quantum phases or entangling gates by\nembedding electric dipoles in photonic cavities or waveguides, which modify the\nelectromagnetic fluctuations. Here, we show theoretically that the enhanced\nfluctuations in the anti-squeezed quadrature of a squeezed vacuum state allows\nfor engineering interactions between electric dipoles without the need for a\nphotonic structure. Thus, the strength and range of the interactions can be\nengineered in a time-dependent way by changing the spatial profile of the\nsqueezed vacuum in a travelling-wave geometry, which also allows the\nimplementation of chiral dissipative interactions. Using experimentally\nrealized squeezing parameters and including realistic losses, we predict single\natom cooperativities $C$ of up to 10 for the squeezed vacuum enhanced\ninteractions.\n", "  Weak perturbations can drive an interacting many-particle system far from its\ninitial equilibrium state if one is able to pump into degrees of freedom\napproximately protected by conservation laws. This concept has for example been\nused to realize Bose-Einstein condensates of photons, magnons, and excitons.\nIntegrable quantum systems, like the one-dimensional Heisenberg model, are\ncharacterized by an infinite set of conservation laws. Here we develop a theory\nof weakly driven integrable systems and show that pumping can induce large spin\nor heat currents even in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations,\nsince it activates local and quasi-local approximate conserved quantities. The\nresulting steady state is qualitatively captured by a truncated generalized\nGibbs ensemble with Lagrange parameters that depend on the structure but not on\nthe overall amplitude of perturbations nor the initial state. We suggest to use\nspin-chain materials driven by terahertz radiation to realize\nintegrability-based spin and heat pumps.\n", "  Accreting pulsars power relativistic jets, and display a complex spin\nphenomenology. These behaviours may be closely related to the large-scale\nconfiguration of the star's magnetic field, shaped by its interaction with the\nsurrounding accretion disc. Here we present the first relativistic simulations\nof the interaction of a pulsar magnetosphere with an accretion flow. Our\naxisymmetric simulations treat the magnetospheric, or coronal, regions using a\nresistive extension of force-free electrodynamics. The magnetic field is also\nevolved inside the disc, which is a defined volume with a specified velocity\nfield and conductivity profile, found using an alpha-disc model. We study a\nrange of disc alpha-parameters, thicknesses, magnetic Prandtl numbers, and\ninner truncation radii. We find that a large fraction of the magnetic flux in\nthe pulsar's closed zone is opened by the intrusion of the disc, leading to an\nenhancement of the power extracted by the pulsar wind and the spin-down torque\napplied to the pulsar. In our simulations, most of the spin-down contribution\nto the stellar torque acts on open field lines. The efficiency of field-line\nopening is high in the simulations' long-term quasi-steady states, which\nimplies that a millisecond pulsar's electromagnetic wind could be strong enough\nto power the observed neutron-star radio jets, and may significantly affect the\npulsar's spin evolution.\n", "  We consider the deformed harmonic oscillator as a discrete version of the\nLiouville theory and study this model in the presence of local integrable\ndefects. From this, the time evolution of the defect degrees of freedom are\ndetermined, found in the form of the local equations of motion. We also revisit\nthe continuous Liouville theory, deriving its local integrals of motion and\ncomparing these with previous results from the sine-Gordon point of\nview.Finally, the generic Backlund type relations are presented, corresponding\nto the implementation of time-like and space-like impurities in the continuum\nmodel. Finally, we consider the interface of the Liouville theory with the free\nmassless theory. With the appropriate choice of the defect (Darboux) matrix we\nare able to derive the hetero-Backlund transformation for the Liouville theory.\n", "  Entropic lattice Boltzmann methods have been developed to alleviate intrinsic\nstability issues of lattice Boltzmann models for under-resolved simulations.\nIts reliability in combination with moving objects was established for various\nlaminar benchmark flows in two dimensions in our previous work Dorschner et al.\n[11] as well as for three dimensional one-way coupled simulations of\nengine-type geometries in Dorschner et al. [12] for flat moving walls. The\npresent contribution aims to fully exploit the advantages of entropic lattice\nBoltzmann models in terms of stability and accuracy and extends the methodology\nto three-dimensional cases including two-way coupling between fluid and\nstructure, turbulence and deformable meshes. To cover this wide range of\napplications, the classical benchmark of a sedimenting sphere is chosen first\nto validate the general two-way coupling algorithm. Increasing the complexity,\nwe subsequently consider the simulation of a plunging SD7003 airfoil at a\nReynolds number of Re = 40000 and finally, to access the model's performance\nfor deforming meshes, we conduct a two-way coupled simulation of a\nself-propelled anguilliform swimmer. These simulations confirm the viability of\nthe new fluid-structure interaction lattice Boltzmann algorithm to simulate\nflows of engineering relevance.\n", "  Placing bright sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) within the broader context of\ngalaxy formation and evolution requires accurate measurements of their\nclustering, which can constrain the masses of their host dark matter halos.\nRecent work has shown that the clustering measurements of these galaxies may be\naffected by a `blending bias,' which results in the angular correlation\nfunction of the sources extracted from single-dish imaging surveys being\nboosted relative to that of the underlying galaxies. This is due to confusion\nintroduced by the coarse angular resolution of the single-dish telescope and\ncould lead to the inferred halo masses being significantly overestimated. We\ninvestigate the extent to which this bias affects the measurement of the\ncorrelation function of SMGs when it is derived via a cross-correlation with a\nmore abundant galaxy population. We find that the blending bias is essentially\nthe same as in the auto-correlation case and conclude that the best way to\nreduce its effects is to calculate the angular correlation function using SMGs\nin narrow redshift bins. Blending bias causes the inferred host halo masses of\nthe SMGs to be overestimated by a factor of $\\sim6$ when a redshift interval of\n$\\delta z=3$ is used. However, this reduces to a factor of $\\sim2$ for $\\delta\nz=0.5$. The broadening of photometric redshift probability distributions with\nincreasing redshift can therefore impart a mild halo `downsizing' effect onto\nthe inferred host halo masses, though this trend is not as strong as seen in\nrecent observational studies.\n", "  We have built regions in a Sky map where it should be expected the arrival of\n120 EeV ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) directionally correlated with the\nlatest astrophysical neutrino tracks observed at IceCube, which are taken as\npoint sources. In order to calculate these arrival directions we have\nconsidered contributions to the cosmic rays deflections originated by the\ngalactic and the extragalactic magnetic field, and a UHECR composition\ncompatible with the current expectations. We have used the Jansson-Farrar JF12\nmodel for the Galactic magnetic field and an extragalactic magnetic field\nstrength of 1nG and coherence length of 1Mpc. We observe that the regions\noutside of the Galactic plane are more strongly correlated with the neutrino\ntracks than those adjacent to or in it, with the former regions being good\ncandidates to search for excesses, or anisotropies, in the UHECR flux.\nAdditionally, we have focused, as an example, on the region of 150 EeV UHECR\narrival directions correlated with the IceCube event 37 located at\n$(l,b)=(-137.1^\\circ,65.8^\\circ)$ in the Northern Hemisphere, far away from the\nGalactic plane, obtaining an angular size $\\sim 5^\\circ$, being $\\sim 3^\\circ$\nfor 200 EeV, and $\\sim 8^\\circ$ for 120 EeV. The results presented in this\npaper represent a useful UHECR excess search Sky map guide.\n", "  The response of mechanical systems composed of springs and dashpots to a step\ninput is of eminent interest in the applications. If the system is formed by\nlinear elements, then its response is governed by a system of linear ordinary\ndifferential equations, and the mathematical method of choice for the analysis\nof the response of such systems is the classical theory of distributions.\nHowever, if the system contains nonlinear elements, then the classical theory\nof distributions is of no use, since it is strictly limited to the linear\nsetting. Consequently, a question arises whether it is even possible or\nreasonable to study the response of nonlinear systems to step inputs. The\nanswer is positive. A mathematical theory that can handle the challenge is the\nso-called Colombeau algebra. Building on the abstract result by (Pr\\r{u}\\v{s}a\n& Rajagopal 2016, Int. J. Non-Linear Mech) we show how to use the theory in the\nanalysis of response of a simple nonlinear mass--spring--dashpot system.\n", "  Deriving meaningful information from observational data is often restricted\nby many limiting factors, the most important of which is the presence of noise.\nIn this work, we present the use of the bicoherence function to extract\ninformation about the underlying nonlinearity from noisy time series. We show\nthat a system evolving in the presence of noise which has its dynamical state\nconcealed from quantifiers like the power spectrum and correlation dimension\nD2, can be revealed using the bicoherence function. We define an index called\nmain peak bicoherence function as the bicoherence associated with the maximal\npower spectral peak. We show that this index is extremely useful while dealing\nwith quasi-periodic data as it can distinguish strange non chaos from quasi\nperiodicity even with added noise. We demonstrate this in a real world\nscenario, by taking the bicoherence of variable stars showing period doubling\nand strange non-chaotic behavior. Our results indicate that bicoherence\nanalysis can also bypass the method of surrogate analysis using Fourier phase\nrandomization, used to differentiate linear stochastic processes from non\nlinear ones, in conventional methods involving measures like D2.\n", "  We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with stellar feedback from the\nFIRE project to study the physical nature of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) at z<1.\nAt these low redshifts, LLSs are closely associated with dense gas structures\nsurrounding galaxies, such as galactic winds, dwarf satellites, and cool\ninflows from the intergalactic medium. Our analysis is based on 14 zoom-in\nsimulations covering the halo mass range M_h~10^9-10^13 Msun at z=0, which we\nconvolve with the dark matter halo mass function to produce cosmological\nstatistics. We find that the majority of cosmologically-selected LLSs are\nassociated with halos in the mass range 10^10 < M_h < 10^12 Msun. The incidence\nand HI column density distribution of simulated absorbers with columns 10^16.2\n< N_HI < 2x10^20 cm^-2 are consistent with observations. High-velocity outflows\n(with radial velocity exceeding the halo circular velocity by a factor >~2)\ntend to have higher metallicities ([X/H] ~ -0.5) while very low metallicity\n([X/H] < -2) LLSs are typically associated with gas infalling from the\nintergalactic medium. However, most LLSs occupy an intermediate region in\nmetallicity-radial velocity space, for which there is no clear trend between\nmetallicity and radial kinematics. Metal-enriched inflows arise in the FIRE\nsimulations as a result of galactic winds that fall back onto galaxies at low\nredshift. The overall simulated LLS metallicity distribution has a mean\n(standard deviation) [X/H] = -0.9 (0.4) and does not show significant evidence\nfor bimodality, in contrast to recent observational studies but consistent with\nLLSs arising from halos with a broad range of masses and metallicities.\n", "  In these lecture notes I give an elementary introduction to elliptic\nhypergeometric functions. I focus on motivating the main ideas and\nconstructions, rather than giving a comprehensive survey. The lectures include\na brief explanation of the historical origin of elliptic hypergeometric\nfunctions in the context of solvable lattice models. In particular, I give a\nnew proof of the fact that fused Boltzmann weights for the elliptic\nsolid-on-solid model can be expressed as elliptic hypergeometric sums.\n", "  Trans-ionospheric pulse pairs are the most powerful natural radio signals on\nthe Earth and associated with lightning. They have been discovered for two\ndecades by satellites, but their origin still remains elusive. Here we\nattribute these radio signals to relativistic electrons produced by\ncloud-to-ground lightning. When these electrons strike the ground, radio bursts\nare emitted towards space in a narrow cone. This model naturally explains the\ninterval, duration, polarization, coherence and bimodal feature of the pulse\npairs. Based on electron parameters inferred from x-ray observation of\nlightning, the calculated signal intensity agrees with the measurement of\nsatellites. Our results are useful to develop global warning system of storms\nand hurricane based on GPS satellites.\n", "  We investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the subhalo population by\nanalyzing the results of two recent hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE and\nIllustris), which have very similar configuration, but a different model of\nbaryonic physics. We concentrate on haloes with a mass between $10^{12.5}$ and\n$10^{14}M_{\\odot}h^{-1}$ and redshift between 0.2 and 0.5, comparing with\nobservational results and subhalo detections in early-type galaxy lenses. We\ncompare the number and the spatial distribution of subhaloes in the fully hydro\nruns and in their dark matter only counterparts, focusing on the differences\nbetween the two simulations. We find that the presence of baryons reduces the\nnumber of subhaloes, especially at the low mass end ($\\leq\n10^{10}M_{\\odot}h^{-1}$), by different amounts depending on the model. The\nvariations in the subhalo mass function are strongly dependent on those in the\nhalo mass function, which is shifted by the effect of stellar and AGN feedback.\nFinally, we search for analogues of the observed lenses (SLACS) in the\nsimulations, selecting them in velocity dispersion and dynamical properties. We\nuse the selected galaxies to quantify detection expectations based on the\nsubhalo populations in the different simulations, calculating the detection\nprobability and the predicted values for the projected dark matter fraction in\nsubhaloes $f_{DM}$ and the slope of the mass function $\\alpha$. We compare\nthese values with those derived from subhalo detections in observations and\nconclude that the dark-matter-only and hydro EAGLE runs are both compatible\nwith observational results, while results from the hydro Illustris run do not\nlie within the errors.\n", "  Wide-field $u'g'r'i'z'$ Dark Energy Camera observations centred on the giant\nelliptical galaxy NGC5128 covering $\\sim21deg^2$ are used to compile a new\ncatalogue of $\\sim3200$ globular clusters (GCs). We report 2404 new candidates,\nincluding the vast majority within $\\sim140$kpc of NGC5128. We find evidence\nfor a transition at a galactocentric radius of $R_{\\rm gc}\\approx55$kpc from\nGCs intrinsic to NGC5128 to those likely to have been accreted from dwarf\ngalaxies or that may transition to the intra-group medium of the Centaurus A\ngalaxy group. We fit power-law surface number density profiles of the form\n$\\Sigma_{N, R_{\\rm gc}}\\propto R_{\\rm gc}^\\Gamma$ and find that inside the\ntransition radius, the red GCs are more centrally concentrated than the blue,\nwith $\\Gamma_{\\rm inner,red}\\approx-1.78$ and $\\Gamma_{\\rm\ninner,blue}\\approx-1.40$. Outside this region both profiles flatten, more\ndramatically for the red GCs ($\\Gamma_{\\rm outer,red}\\approx-0.33$) compared to\nthe blue ($\\Gamma_{\\rm outer,blue}\\approx-0.61$), although the former is more\nlikely to suffer contamination by background sources. The median\n$(g'\\!-\\!z')_0\\!=\\!1.27$mag colour of the inner red population is consistent\nwith arising from the amalgamation of two giant galaxies each less luminous\nthan present-day NGC5128. Both in- and out-ward of the transition radius, we\nfind the fraction of blue GCs to dominate over the red GCs, indicating a lively\nhistory of minor-mergers. Assuming the blue GCs to originate primarily in dwarf\ngalaxies, we model the population required to explain them, while remaining\nconsistent with NGC5128's present-day spheroid luminosity. We find that several\ndozen dwarfs of luminosities $L_{dw,V}\\simeq10^{6-9.3}L_{V,\\odot}$, following a\nSchechter luminosity function with a faint-end slope of\n$-1.50\\leq\\alpha\\leq-1.25$ is favoured, many of which may have already been\ndisrupted in NGC5128's tidal field.\n", "  The living cell uses a variety of molecular receptors to read and process\nchemical signals that vary in space and time. We model the dynamics of such\nmolecular level measurements as Markov processes in steady state, with a\ncoupling between the receptor and the signal. We prove exactly that, when the\nthe signal dynamics is not perturbed by the receptors, the free energy consumed\nby the measurement process is lower bounded by a quantity proportional to the\nmutual information. Our result is completely independent of the receptor\narchitecture and dependent on signal properties alone, and therefore holds as a\ngeneral principle for molecular information processing.\n", "  We present a mechanism that allows to describe any nonlinear theory of\nElectrodynamics as a consequence of the coupling of the electromagnetic field\nto gravity in the presence of a vacuum represented by the cosmological\nconstant. We emphasize gravity\\rq s exclusive role of catalysis.\n", "  The advantages of angular differential imaging (ADI) has been previously\nuntested in imaging the host galaxies of damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems. In\nthis pilot study, we present the first application of ADI to directly imaging\nthe host galaxy of the DLA seen towards the quasar J1431+3952. K-band imaging\nof the field surrounding J1431+3952 was obtained on the Gemini North telescope\nwith the adaptive optics system and a laser guide star. We computed a\nsensitivity curve that demonstrates the sensitivity of our observations as a\nfunction of K-band magnitude, impact parameter and DLA angular size. For an\nimpact parameter of 0.5\" (3.4 kpc at the redshift of the absorber) our mass\nsensitivity is log (M_star/M_sun) ~ 9.2 and drops to ~ 9.0 at separations\nbeyond ~ 6 kpc for the smallest size model galaxy. Three candidate galaxies are\nidentified within 5\". Stellar masses were computed from the K-band photometry\nyielding values of log (M_star/M_sun) ~ 9.9, 9.7 and 11.1 respectively. The\nlikely identification of the absorbing galaxy is discussed, and we conclude\nthat the galaxy with the largest impact parameter and highest stellar mass is\nunlikely to be the host, based on its inconsistency with the N(HI) impact\nparameter relation and inconsistent photometric redshift. Whilst we cannot\ndistinguish between the remaining two candidates as the DLA host, we note that\ndespite the low spin temperature and relatively high metallicity of the DLA,\nthe host does not appear to be a particularly luminous (high mass) galaxy.\n", "  We study in this paper the capture of a massless particle into an isolated,\nfirst order Corotation Eccentric Resonance (CER), in the framework of the\nPlanar, Eccentric and Restricted Three-Body problem near a m+1:m mean motion\ncommensurability (m integer). While capture into Lindblad Eccentric Resonances\n(where the perturber's orbit is circular) has been investigated years ago,\ncapture into CER (where the perturber's orbit is elliptic) has not yet been\ninvestigated in detail. Here, we derive the generic equations of motion near a\nCER in the general case where both the perturber and the test particle migrate.\nWe derive the probability of capture in that context, and we examine more\nclosely two particular cases: (i) if only the perturber is migrating, capture\nis possible only if the migration is outward from the primary. Notably, the\nprobability of capture is independent of the way the perturber migrates\noutward; (ii) if only the test particle is migrating, then capture is possible\nonly if the algebraic value of its migration rate is a decreasing function of\norbital radius. In this case, the probability of capture is proportional to the\nradial gradient of migration. These results differ from the capture into\nLindblad Eccentric Resonance (LER), where it is necessary that the orbits of\nthe perturber and the test particle converge for capture to be possible.\nPossible applications for planetary satellites are discussed.\n", "  We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging confirming the optical\ndisappearance of the failed supernova (SN) candidate identified by Gerke et al.\n(2015). This $\\sim 25~M_{\\odot}$ red supergiant experienced a weak $\\sim\n10^{6}~L_{\\odot}$ optical outburst in 2009 and is now at least 5 magnitudes\nfainter than the progenitor in the optical. The mid-IR flux has slowly\ndecreased to the lowest levels since the first measurements in 2004. There is\nfaint ($2000-3000~L_{\\odot}$) near-IR emission likely associated with the\nsource. We find the late-time evolution of the source to be inconsistent with\nobscuration from an ejected, dusty shell. Models of the spectral energy\ndistribution indicate that the remaining bolometric luminosity is $>6$ times\nfainter than that of the progenitor and is decreasing as $\\sim t^{-4/3}$. We\nconclude that the transient is unlikely to be a SN impostor or stellar merger.\nThe event is consistent with the ejection of the envelope of a red supergiant\nin a failed SN and the late-time emission could be powered by fallback\naccretion onto a newly-formed black hole. Future IR and X-ray observations are\nneeded to confirm this interpretation of the fate for the star.\n", "  We calculate $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow for tip-tip and body-body\nconfigurations of full overlap uranium-uranium (U+U) collisions using a\nhydrodynamic model with smooth initial density distribution and compare the\nresults with those obtained from Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Production of\nthermal photons is seen to be significantly larger for tip-tip collisions\ncompared to body-body collisions of uranium nuclei in the region $p_T >$ 1 GeV.\nThe thermal photon spectrum from body-body collisions is found to be close to\nthe spectrum from most central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The elliptic flow\nparameter calculated for body-body collisions is found to be large and\ncomparable to the $v_2(p_T)$ for mid-central collisions of Au nuclei. On the\nother hand, as expected, the $v_2(p_T)$ is close to zero for tip-tip\ncollisions. The qualitative nature of the photon spectra and elliptic flow for\nthe two different orientations of uranium nuclei is found to be independent of\nthe initial parameters of the model calculation. We show that the photon\nresults from fully overlapping U+U collisions are complementary to the results\nfrom Au+Au collisions at RHIC.\n", "  Recently, some singly bottom baryons have been established experimentally,\nbut none of doubly or triply bottom baryons has been observed. Under the Regge\nphenomenology, the mass of a ground state unobserved doubly or triply bottom\nbaryon is expressed as a function of masses of the well established light\nbaryons and singly bottom baryons. Then, the values of Regge slopes and Regge\nintercepts for baryons containing one, two, or three bottom quarks are\ncalculated. After that, masses of the orbitally excited singly, doubly, and\ntriply bottom baryons are estimated. Our predictions may be useful for the\ndiscovery of these baryons and the $J^P$ assignment of them.\n", "  One possible solution of the cosmological constant problem involves a\nso-called $q$-field, which self-adjusts so as to give a vanishing gravitating\nvacuum energy density (cosmological constant) in equilibrium. We show that this\n$q$-field can manifest itself in other ways. Specifically, we establish a\npropagating mode ($q$-wave) in the nontrivial vacuum and find a particular\nsoliton-type solution in flat spacetime, which we call a $q$-ball by analogy\nwith the well-known $Q$-ball solution. Both $q$-waves and $q$-balls are\nexpected to play a role for the equilibration of the $q$-field in the very\nearly universe.\n", "  Quantum walks and random walks bear similarities and divergences. One of the\nmost remarkable disparities affects the probability of finding the particle at\na given location: typically, almost a flat function in the first case and a\nbell-shaped one in the second case. Here I show how one can impose any desired\nstochastic behavior (compatible with the continuity equation for the\nprobability function) on both systems by the appropriate choice of time- and\nsite-dependent coins. This implies, in particular, that one can devise quantum\nwalks that show diffusive spreading without loosing coherence, as well as\nrandom walks that exhibit the characteristic fast propagation of a quantum\nparticle driven by a Hadamard coin.\n", "  We argue that the non-detection of primordial tensor modes has taught us a\ngreat deal about the primordial universe. In single-field slow-roll inflation,\nthe current upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r < 0.07$ $(95 \\%\n~CL)$, implies that the Hubble slow-roll parameters obey $\\varepsilon \\ll\n\\eta$, and therefore establishes the existence of a new hierarchy. We dub this\nregime the conformal limit of (slow-roll) inflation, and show that it includes\nStarobinsky-like inflation as well as all viable single-field models with a\nsub-Planckian field excursion. In this limit, all primordial correlators are\nconstrained by the full conformal group to leading non-trivial order in\nslow-roll. This fixes the power spectrum and the full bispectrum, and leads to\nthe \"conformal\" shape of non-Gaussianity. The size of non-Gaussianity is\nrelated to the running of the spectral index by a consistency condition, and\ntherefore it is expected to be small. In passing, we clarify the role of\nboundary terms in the $\\zeta$ action, the order to which constraint equations\nneed to be solved, and re-derive our results using the Wheeler-deWitt\nformalism.\n", "  A scale-invariant chiral effective Lagrangian is constructed for octet pions\nand a dilaton figuring as Nambu-Goldstone bosons with vector mesons\nincorporated as hidden gauge fields. The Lagrangian is built to the\nnext-to-leading order in chiral-scale counting without baryon fields and then\nto leading order including baryons. The resulting theory is hidden\nscale-symmetric and local symmetric. We also discuss some possible applications\nof the present Lagrangian.\n", "  We study the standard spectral line radiative transfer equation for media\nconsisting of resonant atoms and non-resonant components (the dust grains and\nthe atoms without considered spectral transition). Our goal is to study the\nintensity and polarization of the resonance radiation emerging from\nsemi-infinite atmosphere. Using the known technique of resolvent matrices, we\nobtain the exact solution of vectorial radiative transfer equation for various\nsources of non-polarized radiation in semi-infinite atmosphere. Homogeneous,\nlinear increasing and exponentially decreasing sources are considered. Recall,\nthat homogeneous sources correspond to the isothermal atmosphere and the\nexponential ones correspond to the incident radiation with different angles of\ninclination.\n", "  We study the dust content of galaxies from $z=0$ to $z=9$ in semi-analytic\nmodels of galaxy formation that include new recipes to track the production and\ndestruction of dust. We include condensation of dust in stellar ejecta, the\ngrowth of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), the destruction of dust by\nsupernovae and in the hot halo, and dusty winds and inflows. The rate of dust\ngrowth in the ISM depends on the metallicity and density of molecular clouds.\nOur fiducial model reproduces the relation between dust mass and stellar mass\nfrom $z=0$ to $z=7$, the number density of galaxies with dust masses less than\n$10^{8.3}\\,\\rm{M}_\\odot$, and the cosmic density of dust at $z=0$. The model\naccounts for the double power-law trend between dust-to-gas (DTG) ratio and\ngas-phase metallicity of local galaxies and the relation between DTG ratio and\nstellar mass. The dominant mode of dust formation is dust growth in the ISM,\nexcept for galaxies with $M_*<10^7\\,\\rm{M}_\\odot$, where condensation of dust\nin supernova ejecta dominates. The dust-to-metal ratio of galaxies depends on\nthe gas-phase metallicity, unlike what is typically assumed in cosmological\nsimulations. Model variants including higher condensation efficiencies, a fixed\ntimescale for dust growth in the ISM, or no growth at all reproduce some of the\nobserved constraints, but fail to simultaneously reproduce the shape of dust\nscaling relations and the dust mass of high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  Recent breakthrough in search for the analogs of fundamental particles in\ncondensed matter systems lead to experimental realizations of 3D Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals. Weyl state can be hosted either by non-centrosymmetric or magnetic\nmaterials and can be of the first or the second type. Several\nnon-centrosymmetric materials have been proposed to be type-II Weyl semimetals,\nbut in all of them the Fermi arcs between projections of multiple Weyl points\neither have not been observed directly or they were hardly distinguishable from\nthe trivial surface states which significantly hinders the practical\napplication of these materials. Here we present experimental evidence for\ntype-II non-centrosymmetric Weyl state in TaIrTe$_4$ where it has been\npredicted theoretically. We find direct correspondence between ARPES spectra\nand calculated electronic structure both in the bulk and the surface and\nclearly observe the exotic surface states which support the quasi-1D Fermi arcs\nconnecting only four Weyl points. Remarkably, these electronic states are\nspin-polarized in the direction along the arcs, thus highlighting TaIrTe$_4$ as\na novel material with promising application potential.\n", "  The paper derives a relation for the viscosity of undercooled liquids on the\nbasis of the pragmatical model concept of Eshelby relaxations with a finite\nlifetime. From accurate shear relaxation data in the literature, one finds that\nslightly less than half of the internal stresses relax directly via single\nEshelby relaxations; the larger part dissolves at the terminal lifetime, which\nis a combined effect of many Eshelby relaxations.\n", "  We investigate an asymptotically spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime\nfrom two different perspectives. First, using von Neumann entropy, we evaluate\nthe entanglement generation due to the encoded information in spacetime. Then,\nwe work out the entropy of particle creation based on the quantum\nthermodynamics of the scalar field on the underlying spacetime. We show that\nthe general behavior of both entropies are the same. Therefore, the\nentanglement can be applied to the customary quantum thermodynamics of the\nuniverse. Also, using these entropies, we can recover some information about\nthe parameters of spacetime.\n", "  We present the results of classical molecular dynamics simulations to assess\nthe relative contributions to interfacial thermal conductance from inelastic\nphonon processes at the interface and in the adjacent bulk materials. The\nsimulated system is the prototypical interface between argon and \"heavy argon\"\ncrystals, which enables comparison with many past computational studies. We run\nsimulations interchanging the Lennard-Jones potential with its harmonic\napproximation to test the effect of anharmonicity on conductance. The results\nconfirm that the presence of anharmonicity is correlated with increasing\nthermal conductance with temperature, which supports conclusions from prior\nexperimental and theoretical work. However, in the model Ar/heavy-Ar system,\nanharmonic effects at the interface itself contribute a surprisingly small part\nof the total thermal conductance. The larger fraction of the thermal\nconductance at high temperatures arises from anharmonic effects away from the\ninterface. These observations are supported by comparisons of the spectral\nenergy density, which suggest that bulk anharmonic processes increase\ninterfacial conductance by thermalizing energy from modes with low transmission\nto modes with high transmission.\n", "  We present the general structure of two-photon S matrix for a waveguide\ncoupled to a local quantum system that supports multiple ground states. The\npresence of the multiple ground states results in a non-commutative aspect of\nthe system with respect to the exchange of the orders of photons. Consequently,\nthe two-photon S matrix significantly differs from the standard form as\ndescribed by the cluster decomposition principle in the quantum field theory.\n", "  We study nonlinear transport effects on the maximum efficiency and power for\nboth inelastic and elastic thermoelectric generators. The former refers to\nphonon-assisted hopping in double quantum-dots, while the latter is represented\nby elastic tunneling through a single quantum-dot. We find that nonlinear\nthermoelectric transport can lead to enhanced efficiency and power for both\ntypes of devices. A comprehensive survey of various quantum-dot energy,\ntemperature, and parasitic heat conduction reveals that the nonlinear transport\ninduced improvements of the maximum efficiency and power are overall much more\nsignificant for inelastic devices than the elastic devices, even for\ntemperature biases as small as $T_h=1.2T_c$ ($T_h$ and $T_c$ are the\ntemperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively). The underlying\nmechanism is revealed as due to the fact that, unlike the Fermi distribution,\nthe Bose distribution is not bounded when the temperature bias increases. A\nlarge flux density of absorbed phonons leads to great enhancement of the\nelectrical current, the output power, and the energy efficiency, dominating\nover the concurrent increase of the parasitic heat current. Our study reveals\nthat nonlinear transport effects can be a useful tool for improving\nthermoelectric performance.\n", "  Context. Recent NuSTAR observations revealed a somewhat unexpected increase\nin the X-ray flux of the nucleus of NGC 1068. We expect the infrared emission\nof the dusty torus to react on the intrinsic changes of the accretion disk.\n  Aims. We aim to investigate the origin of the X-ray variation by\ninvestigating the response of the mid-infrared environment.\n  Methods. We obtained single-aperture and interferometric mid-infrared\nmeasurements and directly compared the measurements observed before and\nimmediately after the X-ray variations. The average correlated and\nsingle-aperture fluxes as well as the differential phases were directly\ncompared to detect a possible change in the structure of the nuclear emission\non scales of $\\sim$ 2 pc.\n  Results. The flux densities and differential phases of the observations\nbefore and during the X-ray variation show no significant change over a period\nof ten years. Possible minor variations in the infrared emission are $\\lesssim$\n8 %.\n  Conclusions. Our results suggest that the mid-infrared environment of NGC\n1068 has remained unchanged for a decade. The recent transient change in the\nX-rays did not cause a significant variation in the infrared emission. This\nindependent study supports previous conclusions that stated that the X-ray\nvariation detected by NuSTAR observations is due to X-ray emission piercing\nthrough a patchy section of the dusty region.\n", "  Measurements of di-hadron azimuthal correlations at different centralities\nfor Au+Au collisions at 200 AGeV were reported by the PHENIX Collaboration. The\ndata were presented for different ranges of transverse momentum. In particular,\nit was observed that the away-side correlation evolves from double- to a\nsingle-peak structure when the centrality decreases. In this work, we show that\nthese features naturally appear as due to an interplay between the\ncentrality-dependent smooth background elliptic flow and the one produced by\nevent-by-event fluctuating peripheral tubes. To compare with the PHENIX data,\nwe also carry out numerical simulations by using a hydrodynamical code\nNeXSPheRIO, and calculate the correlations by both cumulant and the ZYAM method\nemployed by PHENIX Collaboration. It is shown that our results are in\nreasonable agreement with the data. A brief discussion on the physical content\nof the present model and its difference from other viewpoint is also presented.\n", "  We study single- and multi-quantum transitions of the nuclear spins of\nionized arsenic donors in silicon and find quadrupolar effects on the coherence\ntimes, which we link to fluctuating electrical field gradients present after\nthe application of light and bias voltage pulses. To determine the coherence\ntimes of superpositions of all orders in the 4-dimensional Hilbert space, we\nuse a phase-cycling technique and find that, when electrical effects were\nallowed to decay, these times scale as expected for a field-like decoherence\nmechanism such as the interaction with surrounding $^{29}$Si nuclear spins.\n", "  We write down a theory for non-Abelian superfluids with a partially broken\n(semisimple) Lie group. We adapt the offshell formalism of hydrodynamics to\nsuperfluids and use it to comment on the superfluid transport compatible with\nthe second law of thermodynamics. We find that the second law can be also used\nto derive the Josephson equation, which governs dynamics of the Goldstone\nmodes. In the course of our analysis, we derive an alternate and mutually\ndistinct parametrization of the recently proposed classification of\nhydrodynamic transport and generalize it to superfluids.\n", "  We explore the constraints boundary causality places on the allowable\nGauss-Bonnet gravitational couplings in asymptotically AdS spaces, specifically\nconsidering spherical black hole solutions. We additionally consider the\nhyperbolicity properties of these solutions, positing that\nhyperbolicity-violating solutions are sick solutions whose causality properties\nprovide no information about the theory they reside in. For both signs of the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling, spherical black holes violate boundary causality at\nsmaller absolute values of the coupling than planar black holes do. For\nnegative coupling, as we tune the Gauss-Bonnet coupling away from zero, both\nspherical and planar black holes violate hyperbolicity before they violate\nboundary causality. For positive coupling, the only hyperbolicity-respecting\nspherical black holes which violate boundary causality do not do so appreciably\nfar from the planar bound. Consequently, eliminating hyperbolicity-violating\nsolutions means the bound on Gauss-Bonnet couplings from the boundary causality\nof spherical black holes is no tighter than that from planar black holes.\n", "  Herein we study the inverse problem on inferring depth profile of\nnear-surface residual stress in a weakly anisotropic medium by boundary\nmeasurement of Rayleigh-wave dispersion if all other relevant material\nparameters of the elastic medium are known. Our solution of this inverse\nproblem is based on a recently developed algorithm by which each term of a\nhigh-frequency asymptotic formula for dispersion relations can be computed for\nRayleigh waves that propagate in various directions along the free surface of a\nvertically-inhomogeneous, prestressed, and weakly anisotropic half-space. As a\nprime example of possible applications we focus on a thick-plate sample of AA\n7075-T651 aluminum alloy, which has one face treated by low plasticity\nburnishing (LPB) that induced a depth-dependent prestress at and immediately\nbeneath the treated surface. We model the sample as a prestressed,\nweakly-textured orthorhombic aggregate of cubic crystallites and assume that by\nnondestructive and/or destructive measurements we have ascertained everything\nabout the sample, including the LPB-induced prestress, before it is put into\nservice. Under the supposition that the prestress be partially relaxed but\nother material parameters remain unchanged after the sample undergoes a period\nof service, we examine the possibility of inferring the depth profile of the\npartially relaxed stress by boundary measurement of Rayleigh-wave dispersion.\n", "  The turn-around radii of the galaxy groups show the imprint of a long battle\nbetween their self-gravitational forces and the accelerating space. The\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology based on the general relativity (GR) predicts\nthe existence of an upper bound on the expectation value of the turn-around\nradius which is rarely violated by individual galaxy groups. We speculate that\na deviation of the gravitational law from GR on the cosmological scale could\ncause an appreciable shift of the mean turn-around radius to higher values and\nmake the occurrence of the bound violation more probable. Analyzing the data\nfrom high-resolution N-body simulations for two specific models with modified\ngravity (MG) and the standard GR+$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we determine the\nturn-around radii of the massive Rockstar groups from the peculiar motions of\nthe galactic halos located in the bound zone where the fifth force generated by\nMG is expected to be at most partially shielded. We detect a $4\\sigma$ signal\nof difference in the odds of the bound violations between a fiducial MG and the\nGR models, proving that the odds of the bound violations increase with the\nstrength of the fifth force produced by the presence of MG. The advantage of\nusing the odds of the bound violations as a complementary diagnostics to probe\nthe nature of gravity is discussed.\n", "  Early-type galaxies provide unique tests for the predictions of the cold dark\nmatter cosmology and the baryonic physics assumptions entering models for\ngalaxy formation. In this work, we use the Illustris simulation to study\ncorrelations of three main properties of early-type galaxies, namely, the\nstellar orbital anisotropies, the central dark matter fractions and the central\nradial density slopes, as well as their redshift evolution since $z=1.0$. We\nfind that lower-mass galaxies or galaxies at higher redshift tend to be bluer\nin rest-frame colour, have higher central gas fractions, and feature more\ntangentially anisotropic orbits and steeper central density slopes than their\nhigher-mass or lower-redshift counterparts, respectively. The projected central\ndark matter fraction within the effective radius shows a very mild mass\ndependence but positively correlates with galaxy effective radii due to the\naperture effect. The central density slopes obtained by combining strong\nlensing measurements with single aperture kinematics are found to differ from\nthe true density slopes. We identify systematic biases in this measurement to\nbe due to two common modelling assumptions, isotropic stellar orbital\ndistributions and power-law density profiles. We also compare the properties of\nearly-type galaxies in Illustris to those from existing galaxy and strong\nlensing surveys, we find in general broad agreement but also some tension,\nwhich poses a potential challenge to the stellar formation and feedback models\nadopted by the simulation.\n", "  SmB$_6$ exhibits a small (15-20 meV) bandgap at low temperatures due to\nhybridized $d$ and $f$ electrons, a tiny (3 meV) transport activation energy\n$(E_{A})$ above 4 K, and surface states accessible to transport below 2 K. We\nstudy its magnetoresistance in 60-T pulsed fields between 1.5 K and 4 K. The\nresponse of the nearly $T$-independent surface states (which show no\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations) is distinct from that of the activated bulk.\n$E_{A}$ shrinks by 50% under fields up to 60 T. Data up to 93 T suggest that\nthis trend continues beyond 100 T, in contrast with previous explanations. It\nrules out emerging theories to explain observed exotic magnetic quantum\noscillations.\n", "  The octonions are one of the four normed division algebras, together with the\nreal, complex and quaternion number systems. The latter three hold a primary\nplace in random matrix theory, where in applications to quantum physics they\nare determined as the entries of ensembles of Hermitian random by symmetry\nconsiderations. Only for $N=2$ is there an existing analytic theory of\nHermitian random matrices with octonion entries. We use a Jordan algebra\nviewpoint to provide an analytic theory for $N=3$. We then proceed to consider\nthe matrix structure $X^\\dagger X$, when $X$ has random octonion entries.\nAnalytic results are obtained from $N=2$, but are observed to break down in the\n$3 \\times 3$ case.\n", "  We present an effective description of a spin two massive state and a pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone boson Higgs in a two site model. Using this framework we model\nthe spin two state as a massive graviton and we study its phenomenology at the\nLHC. We find that a reduced set of parameters can describe the most important\nfeatures of this scenario. We address the question of which channel is the most\nsensitive to detect this graviton. Instead of designing search strategies to\nestimate the significance in each channel, we compare the ratio of our\ntheoretical predictions to the limits set by available experimental searches\nfor all the decay channels and as a function of the free parameters in the\nmodel. We discuss the phenomenological details contained in the outcome of this\nsimple procedure. The results indicate that, for the studied masses between 0.5\nand 3 TeV, the channels to look for such a graviton resonance are mainly $ZZ$,\n$WW$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$. This is the case even though top and bottom quarks\ndominate the branching ratios, since their experimental sensitivity is not as\ngood as the one of the electro-weak gauge bosons. We find that as the graviton\nmass increases, the $ZZ$ and $WW$ channels become more important because of its\nrelatively better enhancement over background, mainly due to fat jet\ntechniques. We determine the region of the parameter space that has already\nbeen excluded and the reach for the LHC next stages. We also estimate the size\nof the loop-induced contributions to the production and decay of the graviton,\nand show in which region of the parameter space their effects are relevant for\nour analysis.\n", "  In this paper, some statistical distributions of wide pairs included in\nDouble Star Catalogue are investigated. Frequency distributions and testing\nhypothesis are derived for some basic parameters of visual binaries. The\nresults reached indicate that, it was found that the magnitude difference is\ndistributed exponentially, which means that the majority of the component of\nthe selected systems is of the same spectral type. The distribution of the mass\nratios is concentrated about 0.7 which agree with Salpeter mass function. The\ndistribution of the linear separation appears to be exponentially, which\ncontradict with previous studies for close binaries.\n", "  In this paper we simulate the cyclic circularly-polarised pulses of the\nultra-cool dwarf TVLM513-46546, observed with the VLA at 4.88 and 8.44 GHz on\nMay 2006, by using a 3D model of the auroral radio emission from the stellar\nmagnetosphere. During this epoch, the radio light curves are characterised by\ntwo pulses left-hand polarised at 4.88 GHz, and one doubly-peaked (of opposite\npolarisations) pulse at 8.44 GHz. To take into account the possible deviation\nfrom the dipolar symmetry of the stellar magnetic field topology, the model\ndescribed in this paper is also able to simulate the auroral radio emission\nfrom a magnetosphere shaped like an offset-dipole. To reproduce the timing and\npattern of the observed pulses, we explored the space of parameters controlling\nthe auroral beaming pattern and the geometry of the magnetosphere. Through the\nanalysis of the TVLM513-46546 auroral radio emission, we derive some\nindications on the magnetospheric field topology that is able to simultaneously\nreproduce the timing and patterns of the auroral pulses measured at 4.88 and\n8.44 GHz. Each set of model solutions simulates two auroral pulses (singly or\ndoubly peaked) per period. To explain the presence of only one 8.44 GHz pulse\nper period, we analyse the case of auroral radio emission limited only to a\nmagnetospheric sector activated by an external body, like the case of the\ninteraction of Jupiter with its moons.\n", "  Chemical potential is an effective way to drive phase transition or express\nwettability. In this letter, we present a chemical-potential-based lattice\nBoltzmann model to simulate multiphase flows. The nonideal force is directly\nevaluated by a chemical potential. The model theoretically satisfies\nthermodynamics and Galilean invariance. The computational efficiency is\nimproved owing to avoiding the calculation of pressure tensor. We have derived\nseveral chemical potentials of the popular equations of state from the\nfree-energy density function. An effective chemical-potential boundary\ncondition is implemented to investigate the wettability of a solid surface.\nRemarkably, the numerical results show that the contact angle can be linearly\ntuned by the surface chemical potential.\n", "  We study whether dry merger-driven size growth of massive elliptical galaxies\ndepends on their initial structural concentration, and analyse the validity of\nthe homology hypothesis for virial mass determination in massive ellipticals\ngrown by dry mergers. High-resolution simulations of a few realistic merger\ntrees, starting with compact progenitors of different structural concentrations\n(S\\'ersic indices n), show that galaxy growth has little dependence on the\ninitial S\\'ersic index (larger n leads to slightly larger size growth), and\ndepends more on other particulars of the merger history. We show that the\ndeposition of accreted matter in the outer parts leads to a systematic and\npredictable breaking of the homology between remnants and progenitors, which we\ncharacterize through the evolution, during the course of the merger history, of\nvirial coefficients K = GM/Re \\sigma^2 associated to the most commonly-used\ndynamical and stellar mass parameters. The virial coefficient for the luminous\nmass, K , is about 50 per cent larger at the z = 2 start of the merger\nevolution than in z = 0 remnants. Ignoring virial evolution leads to biased\nvirial mass estimates. We provide K corresponding to a variety of dynamical and\nstellar mass parameters, and provide recipes for the dynamical determination of\ngalaxy masses. For massive, non-compact ellipticals, the popular expression M =\n5 Re \\sigma^2 / G underestimates the dynamical mass within the luminous body by\nfactors of up to 4; it instead provides an approximation to the total stellar\nmass with smaller uncertainty than current stellar population models.\n", "  We consider the possibility of mining black holes in the 1+1-dimensional\ndilaton gravity model of Russo, Susskind and Thorlacius. The model correctly\nincorporates Hawking radiation and back-reaction in a semiclassical expansion\nin 1/N, where N is the number of matter species. It is shown that the lifetime\nof a perturbed black hole is independent of the addition of any extra apparatus\nwhen realized by an arbitrary positive energy matter source. We conclude that\nmining does not occur in the RST model and comment on the implications of this\nfor the black hole information paradox.\n", "  In this paper, we constrain dark energy models using a compendium of\nobservations at low redshifts. We consider the dark energy as a barotropic\nfluid, with the equation of state a constant as well the case where dark energy\nequation of state is a function of time. The observations considered here are\nSupernova Type Ia data, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data and Hubble parameter\nmeasurements. We compare constraints obtained from these data and also do a\ncombined analysis. The combined observational constraints put strong limits on\nvariation of dark energy energy density with redshift. For varying dark energy\nmodels, the range of parameters preferred by the supernova type Ia data is in\ntension with the other low redshift distance measurements.\n", "  The homogeneity of matter distribution at large scales, known as the\ncosmological principle, is a central assumption in the standard cosmological\nmodel. The case is testable though, thus no longer needs to be a principle.\nHere we perform a test for spatial homogeneity using the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) sample by counting galaxies within a\nspecified volume with the radius scale varying up to 300 Mpc/h. We directly\nconfront the large-scale structure data with the definition of spatial\nhomogeneity by comparing the averages and dispersions of galaxy number counts\nwith allowed ranges of the random distribution with homogeneity. The LRG sample\nshows significantly larger dispersions of number counts than the random\ncatalogues up to 300 Mpc/h scale, and even the average is located far outside\nthe range allowed in the random distribution; the deviations are statistically\nimpossible to be realized in the random distribution. This implies that the\ncosmological principle does not hold even at such large scales. The same\nanalysis of mock galaxies derived from the N-body simulation, however, suggests\nthat the LRG sample is consistent with the current paradigm of cosmology, thus\nthe simulation is also not homogeneous in that scale. We conclude that the\ncosmological principle is not in the observed sky and nor is demanded to be\nthere by the standard cosmological world model. This reveals the nature of the\ncosmological principle adopted in the modern cosmology paradigm, and opens new\nfield of research in theoretical cosmology.\n", "  We study the quenching of star formation as a function of redshift,\nenvironment and stellar mass in the galaxy formation simulations of Henriques\net al. (2015), which implement an updated version of the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel (L-GALAXIES) on the two Millennium Simulations after scaling to a Planck\ncosmology. In this model massive galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback\ndepending on both black hole and hot gas mass, and hence indirectly on stellar\nmass. In addition, satellite galaxies of any mass can be quenched by\nram-pressure or tidal stripping of gas and through the suppression of gaseous\ninfall. This combination of processes produces quenching efficiencies which\ndepend on stellar mass, host halo mass, environment density, distance to group\ncentre and group central galaxy properties in ways which agree qualitatively\nwith observation. Some discrepancies remain in dense regions and close to group\ncentres, where quenching still seems too efficient. In addition, although the\nmean stellar age of massive galaxies agrees with observation, the assumed AGN\nfeedback model allows too much ongoing star formation at late times. The fact\nthat both AGN feedback and environmental effects are stronger in higher density\nenvironments leads to a correlation between the quenching of central and\nsatellite galaxies which roughly reproduces observed conformity trends inside\nhaloes.\n", "  We demonstrate an original method -- based on controlled oxidation -- to\ncreate high-quality tunnel junctions between superconducting Al reservoirs and\nInAs semiconductor nanowires. We show clean tunnel characteristics with a\ncurrent suppression by over $4$ orders of magnitude for a junction bias well\nbelow the Al gap $\\Delta_0 \\approx 200\\,\\mu {\\rm eV}$. The experimental data\nare in close agreement with the BCS theoretical expectations of a\nsuperconducting tunnel junction. The studied devices combine small-scale tunnel\ncontacts working as thermometers as well as larger electrodes that provide a\nproof-of-principle active {\\em cooling} of the electron distribution in the\nnanowire. A peak refrigeration of about $\\delta T = 10\\,{\\rm mK}$ is achieved\nat a bath temperature $T_{bath}\\approx250-350\\,{\\rm mK}$ in our prototype\ndevices. This method opens important perspectives for the investigation of\nthermoelectric effects in semiconductor nanostructures and for nanoscale\nrefrigeration.\n", "  Accelerating cosmological models are constructed in a modified gravity theory\ndubbed as $f(R,T)$ gravity at the backdrop of an anisotropic Bianchi type-III\nuniverse. $f(R,T)$ is a function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace $T$ of\nthe energy-momentum tensor and it replaces the Ricci scalar in the\nEinstein-Hilbert action of General Relativity. The models are constructed for\ntwo different ways of modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Exact\nsolutions of the field equations are obtained by a novel method of integration.\nWe have explored the behaviour of the cosmic transit from an decelerated phase\nof expansion to an accelerated phase to get the dynamical features of the\nuniverse. Within the formalism of the present work, it is found that, the\nmodification of the Einstein-Hilbert action does not affect the scale factor.\nHowever the dynamics of the effective dark energy equation of state is\nsignificantly affected.\n", "  We determine the flavour dependence of the renormalisation-group-invariant\nrunning interaction through judicious use of both unquenched Dyson-Schwinger\nequation and lattice results for QCD's gauge-sector two-point functions. An\nimportant step is the introduction of a physical scale setting procedure that\nenables a realistic expression of the effect of different numbers of active\nquark flavours on the interaction. Using this running interaction in concert\nwith a well constrained class of dressed--gluon-quark vertices, we estimate the\ncritical number of active lighter-quarks above which dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking becomes impossible: $n_f^{\\rm cr}\\approx 9$; and hence in whose\nneighbourhood QCD is plausibly a conformal theory.\n", "  General methods of solving equations deal with solving N equations in N\nvariables and the solutions are usually a set of discrete values. However, for\nproblems with a softly broken symmetry these methods often first find a point\nwhich would be a solution if the symmetry were exact, and is thus an\napproximate solution. After this, the solver needs to move in the direction of\nthe symmetry to find the actual solution, but that can be very difficult if\nthis direction is not a straight line in the space of variables. The solution\ncan often be found much more quickly by adding the generators of the softly\nbroken symmetry as auxiliary variables. This makes the number of variables more\nthan the equations and hence there will be a family of solutions, any one of\nwhich would be acceptable. In this paper we present a procedure for finding\nsolutions in this case, and apply it to several simple examples and an\nimportant problem in the physics of false vacuum decay. We also provide a\nMathematica package that implements Powell's hybrid method with the\ngeneralization to allow more variables than equations.\n", "  Topological insulators and topological semimetals are both new classes of\nquantum materials, which are characterized by surface states induced by the\ntopology of the bulk band structure. Topological Dirac or Weyl semimetals show\nlinear dispersion round nodes, termed the Dirac or Weyl points, as the\nthree-dimensional analogue of graphene. We review the basic concepts and\ncompare these topological states of matter from the materials perspective with\na special focus on Weyl semimetals. The TaAs family is the ideal materials\nclass to introduce the signatures of Weyl points in a pedagogical way, from\nFermi arcs to the chiral magneto-transport properties, followed by the hunting\nfor the type-II Weyl semimetals in WTe2, MoTe2 and related compounds. Many\nmaterials are members of big families and topological properties can be tuned.\nAs one example, we introduce the multifuntional topological materials, Heusler\ncompounds, in which both topological insulators and magnetic Weyl semimetals\ncan be found. Instead of a comprehensive review, this article is expected to\nserve as a helpful introduction and summary by taking a snapshot of the quickly\nexpanding field.\n", "  We investigate the squeezed back-to-back correlations (BBC) of $\\phi\\phi$,\ncaused by the mass modification of the particles in the source medium, in the\nheavy-ion collisions of Au+Au and d+Au at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider\n(RHIC) energies. The BBC functions are calculated using the modified masses\nextracted from experimental data and the source space-time distributions\nprovided by the viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. Our investigations indicate\nthat the BBC of $\\phi\\phi$ may perhaps be observed in the collisions of d+Au\nand the peripheral collisions of Au+Au at the RHIC. We suggest to measure the\nBBC experimentally for understanding the mass modifications of the $\\phi$ meson\nin the collisions.\n", "  We discuss analytic continuation as a tool to extract the cumulants of the\nquark number fluctuations in the strongly interacting medium from lattice QCD\nsimulations at imaginary chemical potentials. The method is applied to $N_f =\n2+1$ QCD, discretized with stout improved staggered fermions, physical quark\nmasses and the tree level Symanzik gauge action, exploring temperatures ranging\nfrom 135 up to 350 MeV and adopting mostly lattices with $N_t = 8$ sites in the\ntemporal direction. The method is based on a global fit of various cumulants as\na function of the imaginary chemical potentials. We show that it is\nparticularly convenient to consider cumulants up to order two, and that below\n$T_c$ the method can be advantageous, with respect to a direct Montecarlo\nsampling at $\\mu = 0$, for the determination of generalized susceptibilities of\norder four or higher, and especially for mixed susceptibilities, for which the\ngain is well above one order of magnitude. We provide cumulants up to order\neight, which are then used to discuss the radius of convergence of the Taylor\nexpansion and the possible location of the second order critical point at real\n$\\mu$: no evidence for such a point is found in the explored range of $T$ and\nfor chemical potentials within present determinations of the pseudo-critical\nline.\n", "  A new wave energy device features a submerged ballasted air bag connected at\nthe top to a rigid float. Under wave action, the bag expands and contracts,\ncreating a reciprocating air flow through a turbine between the bag and another\nvolume housed within the float. Laboratory measurements are generally in good\nagreement with numerical predictions. Both show that the trajectory of possible\ncombinations of pressure and elevation at which the device is in static\nequilibrium takes the shape of an S. This means that statically the device can\nhave three different draughts, and correspondingly three different bag shapes,\nfor the same pressure. The behaviour in waves depends on where the mean\npressure-elevation condition is on the static trajectory. The captured power is\nhighest for a mean condition on the middle section.\n", "  The 2+1 dimensional quantum Lifshitz model can be generalised to a class of\nhigher dimensional free field theories that exhibit Lifshitz scaling. When the\ndynamical critical exponent equals the number of spatial dimensions, equal time\ncorrelation functions of scaling operators in the generalised quantum Lifshitz\nmodel are given by a d-dimensional higher-derivative conformal field theory.\nAutocorrelation functions in the generalised quantum Lifshitz model in any\nnumber of dimensions can on the other hand be expressed in terms of\nautocorrelation functions of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. This\nalso holds for autocorrelation functions in a strongly coupled Lifshitz field\ntheory with a holographic dual of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton type. The map to a\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theory extends to autocorrelation functions in\nthermal states and out- of-equilbrium states preserving symmetry under spatial\ntranslations and rotations in both types of Lifshitz models. Furthermore, the\nspectrum of quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbations in Lifshitz black\nhole backgrounds can be obtained analytically at low spatial momenta and\nexhibits a linear dispersion relation at z = d. At high momentum, the mode\nspectrum can be obtained in a WKB approximation and displays very different\nbehaviour compared to holographic duals of conformal field theories. This has\nimplications for thermalisation in strongly coupled Lifshitz field theories\nwith z > 1.\n", "  We report H$_2$O maser line observations of the bright-rimmed globule IC 1396\nN using a ground-space interferometer with the 10-m RadioAstron radio telescope\nas the space-based element. The source was not detected on projected baselines\n>2.3 Earth diameters, which indicates a lower limit on the maser size of L\n>0.03 AU and an upper limit on the brightness temperature of 6.25 x 10$^{12}$\nK. Positions and flux densities of maser spots were determined by fringe rate\nmapping. Multiple low-velocity features from -4.5 km/s to +0.7 km/s are seen,\nand two high-velocity features of V$_{LSR}$=-9.4 km/s and +4.4 km/s are found\nat projected distances of 157 AU and 70 AU, respectively, from the strongest\nlow-velocity feature at V$_{LSR}$=$\\sim$0.3 km/s. Maser components from the\ncentral part of the spectrum fall into four velocity groups but into three\nspatial groups. Three spatial groups of low-velocity features detected in the\n2014 observations are arranged in a linear structure about 200 AU in length.\nTwo of these groups were not detected in 1996 and possibly are jets which\nformed between 1996 and 2014. The putative jet seems to have changed direction\nin 18 years, which we explain by the precession of the jet under the influence\nof the gravity of material surrounding the globule. The jet collimation can be\nprovided by a circumstellar protoplanetary disk. There is a straight line\norientation in the V$_{LSR}$-Right Ascension diagram between the jet and the\nmaser group at V$_{LSR}$=$\\sim$0.3 km/s. However, the central group with the\nsame position but at the velocity V$_{LSR}$$\\sim$-3.4 km/s falls on a straight\nline between two high-velocity components detected in 2014. Comparison of the\nlow-velocity positions from 2014 and 1996, based on the same diagram, shows\nthat the majority of the masers maintain their positions near the central\nvelocity V$_{LSR}$=$\\sim$0.3 km/s during the 18 year period.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to probe phenomenological implications of large\nfluctuations of quantum geometry in the Planck era, using cosmology of the\nearly universe. For the background (Friedmann, Lema\\^{i}tre, Robertson, Walker)\n\\emph{quantum} geometry, we allow `widely spread' states in which the\n\\emph{relative} dispersions are as large as $168\\%$ in the Planck regime. By\nintroducing suitable methods to overcome the ensuing conceptual and\ncomputational issues, we calculate the power spectrum $P_{\\mathcal{R}}(k)$ and\nthe spectral index $n_s(k)$ of primordial curvature perturbations. These\nresults generalize the previous work in loop quantum cosmology which focused on\nthose states which were known to remain sharply peaked throughout the Planck\nregime. Surprisingly, even though the fluctuations we now consider are large,\ntheir presence does not add new features to the final $P_{\\mathcal{R}}(k)$ and\n$n_s(k)$: Within observational error bars, their effect is degenerate with a\ndifferent freedom in the theory, namely the number of \\emph{pre-inflationary}\ne-folds $N_{{\\rm B}\\,\\star}$ between the bounce and the onset of inflation.\nTherefore, with regard to observational consequences, one can simulate the\nfreedom in the choice of states with large fluctuations in the Planck era using\nthe simpler, sharply peaked states, simply by allowing for different values of\n$N_{{\\rm B}\\,\\star}$.\n", "  When gravitational aggregates are spun to fission they can undergo complex\ndynamical evolution, including escape and reconfiguration. Previous work has\nshown that a simple analysis of the full 2-body problem provides physically\nrelevant insights for whether a fissioned system can lead to escape of the\ncomponents and the creation of asteroid pairs. In this paper we extend the\nanalysis to the full 3-body problem, utilizing recent advances in the\nunderstanding of fission mechanics of these systems. Specifically, we find that\nthe full 3-body problem can eject a body with as much as 0.31 of the total\nsystem mass, significantly larger than the 0.17 mass limit previously\ncalculated for the full 2-body problem. This paper derives rigorous limits on a\nfissioned 3-body system with regards to whether fissioned system components can\nphysically escape from each other and what other stable relative equilibria\nthey could settle in. We explore this question with a narrow focus on the\nSpherical Full Three Body Problem studied in detail earlier.\n", "  Reconstruction techniques are commonly used in cosmology to reduce\ncomplicated nonlinear behaviours to a more tractable linearized system. We\nstudy a new reconstruction technique that uses the Moving-Mesh algorithm to\nestimate the displacement field from nonlinear matter distribution. We show the\nperformance of this new technique by quantifying its ability to reconstruct\nlinear modes. We study the cumulative Fisher information $I(<k_n)$ about the\ninitial matter power spectrum in the matter power spectra in 130 $N$-body\nsimulations before and after reconstruction, and find that the nonlinear\nplateau of $I(<k_n)$ is increased by a factor of $\\sim 50$ after\nreconstruction, from $I \\simeq 2.5 \\times 10^{-5} /({\\rm Mpc}/h)^3$ to $I\n\\simeq 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}/({\\rm Mpc}/h)^3$ at large $k$. This result includes\nthe decorrelation between initial and final fields, which has been neglected in\nsome previous studies. We expect this technique to be beneficial to problems\nsuch as baryonic acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions and cosmic\nneutrinos that rely on accurately disentangling nonlinear evolution from\nunderlying linear effects.\n", "  The finite temperature phase diagram is obtained for an infinite honeycomb\nlattice with spin-$1/2$ Ising interaction $J$ by using thermal-state fidelity\nand von Neumann entropy based on the infinite projected entangled pair state\nalgorithm with ancillas. % The tensor network representation of the fidelity,\nwhich is defined as an overlap measurement between two thermal states, is\npresented for thermal states on the honeycomb lattice. % We show that the\nfidelity per lattice site and the von Neumann entropy can capture the phase\ntransition temperatures for applied magnetic field, consistent with the\ntransition temperatures obtained via the transverse magnetizations, which\nindicates that a continuous phase transition occurs in the system. In the\ntemperature-magnetic field plane, the phase boundary is found to have the\nfunctional form $(k_BT_c)^2 + h_c^2/2 = a J^2$ with a single numerical fitting\ncoefficient $a = 2.298$, where $T_c$ and $h_c$ are the critical temperature and\nfield with the Boltzmann constant $k_B$. For the quantum state at zero\ntemperature, this phase boundary function gives the critical field estimate\n$h_c = \\sqrt{2a} J \\simeq 2.1438 J$, consistent with the known value $h_c =\n2.13250(4)\\, J$ calculated from a Cluster Monte Carlo approach. The critical\ntemperature in the absence of magnetic field is estimated as $k_BT_c =\n\\sqrt{a}J \\simeq 1.5159\\, J$, consistent with the exact result $k_BT_c =\n1.51865...\\, J$.\n", "  Light bosonic fields are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model. Even\nwhen minimally coupled to gravity, these fields might evade the assumptions of\nthe black-hole no-hair theorems and give rise to spinning black holes which can\nbe drastically different from the Kerr metric. Furthermore, they allow for\nself-gravitating compact solitons, known as (scalar or Proca) boson stars. The\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray flux emitted by\naccreting compact objects carry information about the strong-field region, thus\nproviding a powerful tool to constrain deviations from Kerr's geometry and to\nsearch for exotic compact objects. By using the relativistic precession model\nas a proxy to interpret the QPOs in terms of geodesic frequencies, we\ninvestigate how the QPO frequencies could be used to test the no-hair theorem\nand the existence of light bosonic fields near accreting compact objects. We\nshow that a detection of two QPO triplets with current sensitivity can already\nconstrain these models, and that the future eXTP mission or a LOFT-like mission\ncan set very stringent constraints on black holes with bosonic hair and on\n(scalar or Proca) boson stars. The peculiar geodesic structure of compact\nscalar/Proca boson stars implies that these objects can easily be ruled out as\nalternative models for X-ray source GRO J1655-40.\n", "  Weyl-Heisenberg ensembles are a class of determinantal point processes\nassociated with the Schr\\\"odinger representation of the Heisenberg group.\nHyperuniformity characterizes a state of matter for which (scaled) density\nfluctuations diminish towards zero at the largest length scales. We will prove\nthat Weyl-Heisenberg ensembles are hyperuniform. Weyl-Heisenberg ensembles\ninclude as a special case a multi-layer extension of the Ginibre ensemble\nmodeling the distribution of electrons in higher Landau levels, which has\nrecently been object of study in the realm of the Ginibre-type ensembles\nassociated with polyanalytic functions. In addition, the family of\nWeyl-Heisenberg ensembles includes new structurally anisotropic processes,\nwhere point-statistics depend on the different spatial directions, and thus\nprovide a first means to study directional hyperuniformity.\n", "  The shear modulus of jammed frictional granular materials with the harmonic\nrepulsive interaction under an oscillatory shear is numerically investigated.\nIt is confirmed that the storage modulus, the real part of the shear modulus,\nfor frictional grains with sufficiently small strain amplitude $\\gamma_0$\ndiscontinuously emerges at the jamming transition point. The storage modulus\nfor small $\\gamma_0$ differs from that of frictionless grains even in the zero\nfriction limit, while they are almost identical with each other for\nsufficiently large $\\gamma_0$, where the transition becomes continuous. The\nstress-strain curve exhibits a hysteresis loop even for a small strain, which\nconnects a linear region for sufficiently small strain to another linear region\nfor relatively larger strain. We propose a new scaling law to interpolate\nbetween the states of small and large $\\gamma_0$.\n", "  In this article we wonder what the next 100 years will bring for women in\nastronomy in the UK. After this year of looking back and celebrating 100 years\nof women in the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), we now ask: what might the\nfuture hold? Extrapolating current trends, when might we expect equality in the\ngenders of RAS members, speakers at meetings, award winners and more?\nUltimately, when might we stop needing to talk about women in astronomy at all\n- when it will be as irrelevant to the conversation about astronomy as being a\nmale astronomer is?\n", "  The newly observed ($\\sqrt3$$\\times$$\\sqrt3$) surface reconstruction in\nheteroepitaxial Si(111) thin films on metal substrates is widely considered as\na promising platform to realize 2D Dirac and topological states, yet its\nformation mechanism and structural stability are poorly understood, leading to\nthe controversial terminology of \"multilayer silicene\". Based on valence bond\nand conjugation theory, we propose a {\\pi}-conjugation plus charge-transfer\nmodel to elucidate such a unique \"bamboo hat\" surface geometry. The formation\nof planar ring-shaped {\\pi}-conjugation and charge transfer from the rings to\nupper buckled Si atoms greatly lower the surface dangling bond energy. We\njustify this unconventional Si structural model by analyzing from\nfirst-principles surface energies and surface stress tensors as a function of\nstrain. Within the same formalism, additional metastable surface\nreconstructions with the similar \"bamboo hat\" features are predicted which\nopens possibilities to other exotic electronic states in silicon.\n", "  In the present work motivated by generalized forms of the Hertzian dynamics\nassociated with granular crystals, we consider the possibility of such models\nto give rise to both shock and rarefaction waves. Depending on the value $p$ of\nthe nonlinearity exponent, we find that both of these possibilities are\nrealizable. We use a quasi-continuum approximation of a generalized inviscid\nBurgers model in order to predict the solution profile up to times near the\nshock formation, as well as to estimate when it will occur. Beyond that time\nthreshold, oscillations associated with the discrete nature of the underlying\nmodel emerge that cannot be captured by the quasi-continuum approximation. Our\nanalytical characterization of the above features is complemented by systematic\nnumerical computations.\n", "  We present two-point correlation function statistics of the mass and the\nhalos in the chameleon $f(R)$ modified gravity scenario using a series of large\nvolume N-body simulations. Three distinct variations of $f(R)$ are considered\n(F4, F5 and F6) and compared to a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM model in the redshift\nrange $z \\in [0,1]$. We find that the matter clustering is indistinguishable\nfor all models except for F4, which shows a significantly steeper slope. The\nratio of the redshift- to real-space correlation function at scales $> 20\nh^{-1} \\mathrm{Mpc}$ agrees with the linear General Relativity (GR) Kaiser\nformula for the viable $f(R)$ models considered. We consider three halo\npopulations characterized by spatial abundances comparable to that of luminous\nred galaxies (LRGs) and galaxy clusters. The redshift-space halo correlation\nfunctions of F4 and F5 deviate significantly from $\\Lambda$CDM at intermediate\nand high redshift, as the $f(R)$ halo bias is smaller or equal to that of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM case. Finally we introduce a new model independent clustering\nstatistic to distinguish $f(R)$ from GR: the relative halo clustering ratio --\n$\\mathcal{R}$. The sampling required to adequately reduce the scatter in\n$\\mathcal{R}$ will be available with the advent of the next generation galaxy\nredshift surveys. This will foster a prospective avenue to obtain largely\nmodel-independent cosmological constraints on this class of modified gravity\nmodels.\n", "  We analyze dispersion measure (DM) variations of 37 millisecond pulsars in\nthe 9-year NANOGrav data release and constrain the sources of these variations.\nVariations are significant for nearly all pulsars, with characteristic\ntimescales comparable to or even shorter than the average spacing between\nobservations. Five pulsars have periodic annual variations, 14 pulsars have\nmonotonically increasing or decreasing trends, and 13 pulsars show both\neffects. Several pulsars show correlations between DM excesses and lines of\nsight that pass close to the Sun. Mapping of the DM variations as a function of\nthe pulsar trajectory can identify localized ISM features and, in one case, an\nupper limit to the size of the dispersing region of 13.2 AU. Finally, five\npulsars show very nearly quadratic structure functions, which could be\nindicative of an underlying Kolmogorov medium. Four pulsars show roughly\nKolmogorov structure functions and another four show structure functions less\nsteep than Kolmogorov. One pulsar has too large an uncertainty to allow\ncomparisons. We discuss explanations for apparent departures from a\nKolmogorov-like spectrum, and show that the presence of other trends in the\ndata is the most likely cause.\n", "  We report single crystal growth and physical properties characterization of\nYbFe$_2$Al$_{10}$ compounds. The measurements of resistivity, magnetic\nsusceptibility, and specific heat show different behaviors from previous\nstudies on polycrystal samples. A mixed valent characteristic with moderate\nmass enhancement is indicated. In particular, the optical spectroscopy\nmeasurement reveals formation of multiple hybridization energy gaps which\nbecome progressively pronounced at low temperature. The multiple hybridization\nenergy gaps are likely caused by the hybridizations between the flat band from\nYb 4$f$ electrons and different bands of conduction electrons.\n", "  High-resolution optical spectroscopy was conducted for the metal-poor\npost-AGB star CC Lyr to determine its chemical abundances and spectral line\nprofiles. Our standard abundance analysis confirms its extremely low\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]<-3.5) and a clear correlation between abundance ratios and\nthe condensation temperature for 11 elements, indicating that dust depletion is\nthe cause of the abundance anomaly of this object. The very low abundances of\nSr and Ba, which are detected for the first time for this object, suggest that\nheavy neutron-capture elements are not significantly enhanced in this object by\nthe s-process during its evolution through AGB phase. Radial velocity of this\nobject and profiles of some atomic absorption lines show variations depending\non pulsation phases, which could be formed by dynamics of the atmosphere rather\nthan by binarity or contributions of circumstellar absorption. On the other\nhand, the H-alpha emission with double peaks shows no evident velocity shift,\nsuggesting that the emission is originating from the circumstellar matter,\npresumably the rotating disk around the object.\n", "  We explicitly construct fractals of dimension 4-epsilon on which dimensional\nregularization approximates scalar-field-only quantum-field-theory amplitudes.\nThe construction does not require fractals to be Lorentz-invariant in any\nsense, and we argue that there probably is no Lorentz-invariant fractal of\ndimension greater than 2. We derive dimensional regularization's power-law\nscreening first for fractals obtained by removing voids from 3-dimensional\nEuclidean space. The derivation applies techniques from elementary dielectric\ntheory. Surprisingly, fractal geometry by itself does not guarantee the\nappropriate power-law behavior; boundary conditions at fractal voids also play\nan important role. We then extend the derivation to 4-dimensional Minkowski\nspace. We comment on generalization to nonscalar fields, and speculate about\nimplications for quantum gravity.\n", "  The recurrent soft X-ray transient Aquila X-1 was observed with Suzaku for a\ngross duration of 79.9 ks, on 2011 October 21 when the object was in a rising\nphase of an outburst. During the observation, the source exhibited a clear\nspectral transition from the hard state to the soft state, on a time scale of\n~30 ks. Across the transition, the 0.8-10 keV XIS count rate increased by a\nfactor ~3, that of HXD-PIN in 15-60 keV decreased by a similar factor, and the\nunabsorbed 0.1-100 keV luminosity increased from 3.5 times 10^37 erg/s to 5.1\ntimes 10^37 erg/s. The broadband spectral shape changed continuously, from a\npower-law like one with a high-energy cutoff to a more convex one. Throughout\nthe transition, the 0.8-60 keV spectra were successfully described with a model\nconsisting of a multi-color blackbody and a Comptonized blackbody, which are\nconsidered to arise from a standard accretion disk and a closer vicinity of the\nneutron star, respectively. All the model parameters were confirmed to change\ncontinuously, from those typical in the hard state to those typical of the soft\nstate. More specifically, the inner disk radius decreased from 31 km to 18 km,\nthe effects of Comptonization on the blackbody photons weakened, and the\nelectron temperature of Comptonization decreased from 10 keV to 3 keV. The\nderived parameters imply that the Comptonizing corona shrinks towards the final\nsoft state, and/or the radial infall velocity of the corona decreases. These\nresults reinforce the view that the soft and hard states of Aql X-1 (and of\nsimilar objects) are described by the same \"disk plus Comptonized blackbody\"\nmodel, but with considerably different parameters.\n", "  Strong laser-induced magnetization of oxygen gas at room temperature and\natmospheric pressure is achieved experimentally on the sub-nanosecond time\nscale. The method is based on controlling the electronic spin of paramagnetic\nmolecules by means of manipulating their rotation with an optical centrifuge.\nSpin-rotational coupling results in high degree of spin polarization on the\norder of one Bohr magneton per centrifuged molecule. Owing to the non-resonant\ninteraction with the laser pulses, the demonstrated technique is applicable to\na broad class of paramagnetic rotors. Executed in a high-density gas, it may\noffer an efficient way of generating macroscopic magnetic fields remotely (as\nshown in this work), producing large amount of polarized electrons and\nconverting electronic to nuclear spin polarization.\n", "  We employ time-resolved resonant x-ray diffraction to study the melting of\ncharge order and the associated insulator-metal transition in the doped\nmanganite Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$ after resonant excitation of a\nhigh-frequency infrared-active lattice mode. We find that the charge order\nreduces promptly and highly nonlinearly as function of excitation fluence.\nDensity functional theory calculations suggest that direct anharmonic coupling\nbetween the excited lattice mode and the electronic structure drive these\ndynamics, highlighting a new avenue of nonlinear phonon control.\n", "  We introduce a new product representation for general random binary fractal\napertures defined by removing voids from Euclidean space, and use it to derive\na simple closed-form expression for ensemble-averaged correlations. Power-law\nscaling at short distance follows almost immediately. Similar techniques\nprovide easy constructions of objects with fractional Brownian short-distance\nbehavior for phase screens and other applications.\n", "  Background Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network\nstructure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can\ndraw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is\nlikely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes.\nHowever, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly\ncentral gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its\nneighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or\ncontrollability) of a node - its predictability. We introduce predictability,\nestimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers\non psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.\n  Methods We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18\npublished papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance\nabuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art\nnet- work models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.\n  Results Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most\nsymptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets.\nPredictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood\nand anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.\n  Conclusions Predictability is an important additional characterization of\nsymptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of\neach node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network\nis, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of\npredictability along with future directions are discussed.\n", "  Most of relatively warm, unevolved metal-poor stars ($T_{\\rm eff}\\gtrsim\n5800\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $[{\\rm Fe/H}]\\lesssim -1.5$) exhibit almost constant\nlithium abundances, irrespective of metallicity or effective temperature, and\nthus form the so-called Spite plateau. This was originally interpreted as\narising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent\nobservations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars;\n$[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-4.0$) have significantly lower lithium abundances than that\nof the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced\nmetal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection\nbetween the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A\nstraightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP\nstars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we\nhave determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars\nwith metallicities $[{\\rm Fe/H}]\\sim -3.0$, where there are numerous\ncarbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered.\nOur 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium\nabundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests\nthat carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related.\nInstead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental\ncause to depleted lithium in UMP stars.\n", "  The giant impact (GI) is one of the most important hypotheses both in\nplanetary science and geoscience, since it is related to the origin of the Moon\nand also the initial condition of the Earth. A number of numerical simulations\nhave been done using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. However,\nGI hypothesis is currently in a crisis. The \"canonical\" GI scenario failed to\nexplain the identical isotope ratio between the Earth and the Moon. On the\nother hand, little has been known about the reliability of the result of GI\nsimulations. In this paper, we discuss the effect of the resolution on the\nresults of the GI simulations by varying the number of particles from $3\n\\times10^3$ to $10^8$. We found that the results does not converge, but shows\noscillatory behaviour. We discuss the origin of this oscillatory behaviour.\n", "  The current understanding of MHD turbulence envisions turbulent eddies which\nare anisotropic in all three directions. In the plane perpendicular to the\nlocal mean magnetic field, this implies that such eddies become\ncurrent-sheet-like structures at small scales. We analyze the role of magnetic\nreconnection in these structures and conclude that reconnection becomes\nimportant at a scale $\\lambda\\sim L S_L^{-4/7}$, where $S_L$ is the outer-scale\n($L$) Lundquist number and $\\lambda$ is the smallest of the field-perpendicular\neddy dimensions. This scale is larger than the scale set by the resistive\ndiffusion of eddies, therefore implying a fundamentally different route to\nenergy dissipation than that predicted by the Kolmogorov-like phenomenology. In\nparticular, our analysis predicts the existence of the sub-inertial,\nreconnection interval of MHD turbulence, with the Fourier energy spectrum\n$E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-5/2}$, where $k_\\perp$ is the wave number\nperpendicular to the local mean magnetic field. The same calculation is also\nperformed for high (perpendicular) magnetic Prandtl number plasmas ($Pm$),\nwhere the reconnection scale is found to be $\\lambda/L\\sim\nS_L^{-4/7}Pm^{-2/7}$.\n", "  We present the derivation and the solutions to the coupled electromagnetic\nand gravitational perturbations with sources in a charged black hole\nbackground. We work in the so called ghost gauge and consider as source of the\nperturbations the infall of radial currents. In this way, we study a system in\nwhich it is provoked a response involving both, gravitational and\nelectromagnetic waves, which allows us to analyze the dependence between them.\nWe solve numerically the wave equations that describe both signals,\ncharacterize the waveforms and study the relation between the input parameters\nof the infalling matter with those of the gravitational and electromagnetic\nresponses.\n", "  We report the most general expression for the chiral charges of a\nnon-universal $U(1)'$ with identical charges for the first two families but\ndifferent charges for the third one. The model is minimal in the sense that\nonly standard model fermions plus right-handed neutrinos are required. By\nimposing anomaly cancellation and constraints coming from Yukawa couplings we\nobtain two different solutions. In one of these solutions, the anomalies cancel\nbetween fermions in different families. These solutions depend on four\nindependent parameters which result very useful for model building. We build\ndifferent benchmark models in order to show the flexibility of the\nparameterization. We also report LHC and low energy constraints for these\nbenchmark models.\n", "  Block copolymer (BCP) melt assembly has been the subject of decades of study,\nwith focus largely on self-organized spatial patterns of periodically-ordered\nsegment density. In this study, we demonstrate that underlying these otherwise\nwell-known composition profiles (i.e. ordered lamella, cylinders, spheres and\nnetworks) are generic and heterogeneous patterns of segment orientation that\ncouple strongly to morphology, even in the absence of specific factors that\npromote intra- or inter-chain segment alignment. We employ a combination of\nself-consistent field theory and coarse-grained simulation methods to measure\npolar and nematic order parameters of segments in a freely-jointed chain model\nof diblock melts. We show that BCP morphologies are generically characterized\nby a {\\it multizone} texture, with segments predominantly aligned normal and\nparallel to inter-domain interfaces in the respective brush and interfacial\nregions of the microdomain. Further, morphologies with anisotropically-curved\ninterfaces (i.e. cylinders and networks) exhibit biaxial order that is aligned\nto the principal curvature axes of the interface. Understanding these generic\nfeatures of intra-domain texture provide new opportunities for manipulating\nmulti-scale structure and functional properties of BCP assembly.\n", "  Natural Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (nNMSSM) is featured by\npredicting one CP-even Higgs boson satisfying $m_{h_1} \\lesssim 120 \\,{\\rm\nGeV}$ and Higgsinos lighter than about 300 GeV, and consequently the cross\nsection for DM-nucleon scattering in this scenario is usually quite large. We\nstudy the diphoton signal of the light Higgs boson in nNMSSM by considering the\ntight constraints from the latest LUX and PandaX-II experiments, and we\nconclude that the optimal value of the signal rate at 8 TeV LHC is greatly\nreduced in comparison with earlier predictions. For example, previous studies\nindicated that the rate may exceed $120 \\,{\\rm fb}$ for $m_{h_1} \\simeq 80\n\\,{\\rm GeV}$, while it is at most $25 \\,{\\rm fb}$ if the lightest neutralino in\nthe scenario is fully responsible for the measured DM relic density. We also\ninvestigate the case of $m_{h_1} \\simeq 98 \\,{\\rm GeV}$ which is hinted by the\nexcesses of the LEP analysis on $Z \\bar{b} b$ signal and the CMS analysis on\nthe diphoton signal. We conclude that nNMSSM can explain simultaneously the\nexcesses at $1\\sigma$ level without violating any known constraints.\n", "  Entanglement is one of the most studied properties of quantum mechanics for\nits application in quantum information protocols. Nevertheless, detecting the\npresence of entanglement in large multipartite sates continues to be a great\nchallenge both from the theoretical and the experimental point of view. Most of\nthe known methods either have computational costs that scale inefficiently with\nthe number of particles or require more information on the state than what is\nattainable in everyday experiments. We introduce a new technique for\nentanglement detection that provides several important advantages in these\nrespects. First, it scales efficiently with the number of particles, thus\nallowing for application to systems composed by up to few tens of particles.\nSecond, it needs only the knowledge of a subset of all possible measurements on\nthe state, therefore being apt for experimental implementation. Moreover, since\nit is based on the detection of nonlocality, our method is device independent.\nWe report several examples of its implementation for well-known multipartite\nstates, showing that the introduced technique has a promising range of\napplications.\n", "  In this paper we show that in the semicassical regime of periodic potential\nlarge enough, the Stark-Wannier ladders become a dense energy spectrum because\nof a cascade of bifurcations while increasing the ratio between the effective\nnonlinearity strength and the tilt of the external field; this fact is\nassociated to a transition from regular to quantum chaotic dynamics. The\nsequence of bifurcation points is explicitly given.\n", "  We previously demonstrated near-field speckle scanning based x-ray imaging to\nbe an easy-to-implement phase sensing method capable of providing both high\nsensitivity and high resolution. Yet, this performance combination could only\nbe achieved at the cost of a significant number of sample exposures and of\nextensive data acquisition time, thus tempering its implementation for\ntomography applications. Herein, we show ways of drastically lowering the\nnumber of exposures for the speckle scanning method to become attractive for\ncomputed tomography (CT) imaging. As the method presented can cope with a high\ndivergence beam, it is also expected to attract the attention of the laboratory\nsources community.\n", "  The fluctuations or disordered motion of the electromagnetic fields are\ndescribed by statistical properties rather than instantaneous values. This\nstatistical description of the optical fields is underlying in the\nStokes-Mueller formalism that applies to measurable intensities. However, the\nfundamental concept of optical coherence, that is assessed by the ability of\nwaves to interfere, is not treatable by this formalism because it omits the\nglobal phase. In this work we show that, using an analogy between deterministic\nmatrix states associated to optical media and quantum mechanical wavefunctions,\nit is possible to construct a general formalism that accounts for the\nadditional terms resulting from the coherency effects that average out for\nincoherent treatments. This method generalizes further the concept of coherent\nsuperposition to describe how deterministic states of optical media can\nsuperpose to generate another deterministic media state. Our formalism of\ncoherency is used to study the combined polarimetric response of interfering\nplasmonic nanoantennas.\n", "  We report a 51V nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of the frustrated\nspin-1/2 chain compound LiCuVO4, performed in pulsed magnetic fields and\nfocused on high-field phases up to 55 T. For the crystal orientations H // c\nand H // b we find a narrow field region just below the magnetic saturation\nwhere the local magnetization remains uniform and homogeneous, while its value\nis field dependent. This behavior is the first microscopic signature of the\nspin-nematic state, breaking spin-rotation symmetry without generating any\ntransverse dipolar order, and is consistent with theoretical predictions for\nthe LiCuVO4 compound.\n", "  In the top-down holographic model of QCD based on D4/D8-branes in type IIA\nstring theory and some of the bottom up models, the low energy effective theory\nof mesons is described by a 5 dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in a\ncertain curved background with two boundaries. The 5 dimensional Chern-Simons\nterm plays a crucial role to reproduce the correct chiral anomaly in 4\ndimensional massless QCD. However, there are some subtle ambiguities in the\ndefinition of the Chern-Simons term for the cases with topologically\nnon-trivial gauge bundles, which include the configurations with baryons. In\nparticular, for the cases with three flavors, it was pointed out by Hata and\nMurata that the naive Chern-Simons term does not lead to an important\nconstraint on the baryon spectrum, which is needed to pick out the correct\nbaryon spectrum observed in nature. In this paper, we propose a formulation of\nwell-defined Chern-Simons term which can be used for the cases with baryons,\nand show that it recovers the correct baryon constraint as well as the chiral\nanomaly in QCD.\n", "  A bipartite quantum system in a mixed state can exhibit nonclassical\ncorrelations, which can go beyond quantum entanglement. While quantum discord\nis the standard measure of quantifying such general quantum correlations, the\nnonclassicality can be determined by simpler means via the measurement of\nwitness operators. We experimentally construct a positive map to witness\nnonclassicality of two qubits in an NMR system. The map can be decomposed so\nthat a single run of an experiment on an ensemble of spins suffices to detect\nthe nonclassicality in the state, if present. We let the state evolve in time\nand use the map to detect nonclassicality as a function of time. To evaluate\nthe efficacy of the witness operator as a means to detect nonclassicality, we\nmeasure quantum discord by performing full quantum state tomography at each\ntime point and obtained a fairly good match between the two methods.\n", "  We search for $\\gamma$-ray and optical periodic modulations in a distant flat\nspectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 0426-380 (the redshift $z=1.1$). Using two\ntechniques (i.e., the maximum likelihood optimization and the exposure-weighted\naperture photometry), we obtain $\\gamma$-ray light curves from \\emph{Fermi}-LAT\nPass 8 data covering from 2008 August to 2016 December. We then analyze the\nlight curves with the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and the Weighted Wavelet\nZ-transform (WWZ). A $\\gamma$-ray quasi-periodicity with a period of 3.35 $\\pm$\n0.68 years is found at the significance-level of $\\simeq3.6\\ \\sigma$. The\noptical-UV flux covering from 2005 August to 2013 April provided by ASI SCIENCE\nDATA CENTER is also analyzed, but no significant quasi-periodicity is found. It\nshould be pointed out that the result of the optical-UV data could be tentative\nbecause of the incomplete of the data. Further long-term multiwavelength\nmonitoring of this FSRQ is needed to confirm its quasi-periodicity.\n", "  We introduce a model of multi-agent dynamics for self-organised motion;\nindividuals travel at a constant speed while trying to adopt the averaged body\nattitude of their neighbours. The body attitudes are represented through\nunitary quaternions. We prove the correspondance with the model presented in a\nprevious work by the three first authors where the body attitudes are\nrepresented by rotation matrices. Differently from this previous work, the\nindividual based model (IBM) introduced here is based on nematic (rather than\npolar) alignment. From the IBM, the kinetic and macroscopic equations are\nderived. The benefit of this approach is twofold: firstly, it allows for a\nbetter understanding of the macroscopic equations obtained and, secondly, these\nequations are prone to numerical studies, which is key for applications.\n", "  We investigate the scenario where the Standard Model is extended with\nclassical scale invariance, which is broken by chiral symmetry breaking and\nconfinement in a new strongly-coupled gauge theory that resembles QCD. The\nStandard Model Higgs field emerges as a result of the mixing of a scalar meson\nin the new strong dynamics and a massless elementary scalar field. The mass and\nscalar decay constant of that scalar meson, which are generated dynamically in\nthe new gauge theory, give rise to the Higgs field mass term, automatically\npossessing the correct negative sign by the bosonic seesaw mechanism. Using\nanalogy with QCD, we evaluate the dynamical scale of the new gauge theory and\nfurther make quantitative predictions for light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons\nassociated with axial symmetry breaking along chiral symmetry breaking in the\nnew gauge theory. A prominent consequence of the scenario is that there should\nbe a Standard Model gauge singlet pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with mass below\n220GeV, which couples to two electroweak gauge bosons through the\nWess-Zumino-Witten term, whose strength is thus determined by the dynamical\nscale of the new gauge theory. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, charged\nunder the electroweak gauge groups, also appear. Concerning the theoretical\naspects, it is shown that the scalar quartic coupling can vanish at the Planck\nscale with the top quark pole mass as large as 172.5GeV, realizing the flatland\nscenario without being in tension with the current experimental data.\n", "  We study the gravitational lensing scenario where the lens is a spherically\nsymmetric charged black hole (BH) surrounded by quintessence matter. The null\ngeodesic equations in the curved background of the black hole are derived. The\nresulting trajectory equation is solved analytically via perturbation and\nseries methods for special choice of parameters and the distance of the closest\napproach to black hole is calculated. We also derive the lens equation giving\nthe bending angle of light in the curved background. In the strong field\napproximation, the solution of the lens equation is also obtained for all\nvalues of the quintessence parameter $w_q$. For all $w_q$, we show that there\nare no stable closed null orbits and that corrections to the deflection angle\nfor the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole when the observer and the source are at\nlarge, but finite, distances from the lens do not depend on the charge up to\nthe inverse of the distances squared. A part of the present work, analyzed\nhowever with a different approach, is the extension of {\\it Phys. Rev. D\n\\textbf{92}, 084042 (2015)} where the uncharged case has been treated\n", "  We present an ab-initio study of Ru substitution in two different compounds,\nBaFe2As2 and LaFeAsO, pure and F-doped. Despite the many similarities among\nthem, Ru substitution has very different effects on these compounds. By means\nof an unfolding technique, which allows us to trace back the electronic states\ninto the primitive cell of the pure compounds, we are able to disentangle the\neffects brought by the local structural deformations and by the impurity\npotential to the states at the Fermi level. Our results are compared with\navailable experiments and show: i) satisfying agreement of the calculated\nelectronic properties with experiments, confirming the presence of a magnetic\norder on a short range scale; ii) Fermi surfaces strongly dependent on the\ninternal structural parameters, more than on the impurity potential. These\nresults enter a widely discussed field in the literature and provide a better\nunderstanding of the role of Ru in iron pnictides: although isovalent to Fe,\nthe Ru-Fe substitution leads to changes in the band structure at the Fermi\nlevel mainly related to local structural modifications.\n", "  We examine the parameter space of two-Higgs-doublet model of type-II after\nimposing the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints from the\nprecision electroweak data, $B$-meson decays, the LHC run-I and run-II data. We\nfind that the searches for Higgs via the\n$\\tau\\bar{\\tau},~WW,~ZZ,\\gamma\\gamma,~hh,~hZ,~HZ,~AZ$ channels can give strong\nconstraints on the CP-odd Higgs $A$ and heavy CP-even Higgs $H$, and the\nparameter space excluded by each channel is respectively carved out in detail.\nThe surviving samples are discussed in two different of regions: (i) In the\nSM-like coupling region of the 125 GeV Higgs, $m_A$ is allowed to be as low as\n350 GeV, and $\\tan\\beta$ is imposed a strong upper limit. $m_H$ is allowed to\nbe as low as 200 GeV for the proper $\\tan\\beta$, $\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha)$ and\n$m_A$, but is required to be larger than 300 GeV for $m_A=700$ GeV. (ii) In the\nwrong sign Yukawa coupling of the 125 GeV, $\\tan\\beta$ and $\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha)$\ncan be imposed upper limits by $b\\bar{b}\\to A/H\\to \\tau\\bar{\\tau}$ channel and\nlower limits by the $A\\to hZ$ channel. $m_A$ and $m_H$ are respectively allowed\nto be as low as 60 GeV and 200 GeV, but 320 GeV $< m_A<$ 500 GeV is excluded\nfor $m_H=$ 700 GeV.\n", "  The growth-rate and the internal dynamics of galaxy-sized dark-matter haloes\ndepend on their location within the cosmic web. Haloes that sit at the nodes\ngrow in mass till the present time and are dominated by radial orbits.\nConversely, haloes embedded in prominent filaments do not change much in size\nand are dominated by tangential orbits. Using zoom hydrodynamical simulations\nincluding star formation and feedback, we study how gas accretes onto these\ndifferent classes of objects that, for simplicity, we dub 'accreting' and\n'stalled' haloes. We find that all haloes get a fresh supply of newly accreted\ngas in their inner regions, although this slowly decreases with time, in\nparticular for the stalled haloes. The inflow of new gas is always higher than\n(but comparable with) that of recycled material. Overall, the cold-gas fraction\nincreases (decreases) with time for the accreting (stalled) haloes. In all\ncases, a stellar disc and a bulge form at the centre of the simulated haloes.\nThe total stellar mass is in excellent agreement with expectations based on the\nabundance-matching technique. Many properties of the central galaxies do not\nseem to correlate with the large-scale environment in which the haloes reside.\nHowever, there are two notable exceptions that characterise stalled haloes with\nrespect to their accreting counterparts: i) the galaxy disc contains much older\nstellar populations; ii) its vertical scale-height is larger by a factor of two\nor more. This thickening is likely due to the heating of the long-lived discs\nby mergers and close flybys.\n", "  Pulsars are magnetized rotating compact objects. They spin down due to\nmagnetic dipole radiation and wind emission. If photon has a nonzero mass, the\nspin down rate would be smaller than the zero mass case. We show that an upper\nlimit of the photon mass, i.e. $m_\\gamma\\lesssim h/Pc^2$, may be placed if a\npulsar with period $P$ is observed to spin down. Recently, a white dwarf (WD)\n--- M dwarf binary, AR Scorpii was discovered to emit pulsed broadband emission\nwith pulses. The spin-down luminosity of the WD can comfortably power the\nnon-thermal radiation from the system. Applying our results to the WD pulsar\nwith $P=117~\\rm{s}$, we obtain a stringent upper limit of the photon mass\nbetween $m_\\gamma<6.3\\times10^{-50}~\\rm{g}$ assuming a vacuum dipole spindown,\nand $m_\\gamma<9.6\\times10^{-50}~\\rm{g}$ assuming a spindown due to a fully\ndeveloped pulsar wind.\n", "  One-dimensional (1D) electron systems in the presence of Coulomb interaction\nare described by Luttinger liquid theory. The strength of Coulomb interaction\nin the Luttinger liquid, as parameterized by the Luttinger parameter K, is in\ngeneral difficult to measure. This is because K is usually hidden in powerlaw\ndependencies of observables as a function of temperature or applied bias. We\npropose a dynamical way to measure K on the basis of an electronic\ntime-of-flight experiment. We argue that the helical Luttinger liquid at the\nedge of a 2D topological insulator constitutes a preeminently suited\nrealization of a 1D system to test our proposal. This is based on the\nrobustness of helical liquids against elastic backscattering in the presence of\ntime reversal symmetry.\n", "  Various particle physics models suggest that, besides the (nearly) cold dark\nmatter that accounts for current observations, additional but sub-dominant dark\nrelics might exist. These could be warm, hot, or even contribute as dark\nradiation. We present here a comprehensive study of two-component dark matter\nscenarios, where the first component is assumed to be cold, and the second is a\nnon-cold thermal relic. Considering the cases where the non-cold dark matter\nspecies could be either a fermion or a boson, we derive consistent upper limits\non the non-cold dark relic energy density for a very large range of velocity\ndispersions, covering the entire range from dark radiation to cold dark matter.\nTo this end, we employ the latest Planck Cosmic Microwave Background data, the\nrecent BOSS DR11 and other Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and also\nconstraints on the number of Milky Way satellites, the latter of which provides\na measure of the suppression of the matter power spectrum at the smallest\nscales due to the free-streaming of the non-cold dark matter component. We\npresent the results on the fraction $f_{\\rm ncdm}$ of non-cold dark matter with\nrespect to the total dark matter for different ranges of the non-cold dark\nmatter masses. We find that the 2$\\sigma$ limits for non-cold dark matter\nparticles with masses in the range 1--10 keV are $f_{\\rm ncdm}\\leq0.29$ (0.23)\nfor fermions (bosons), and for masses in the 10--100 keV range they are $f_{\\rm\nncdm}\\leq0.43$ (0.45), respectively.\n", "  Modeling the nonlinearity of the halo bispectrum remains a major challenge in\nmodern cosmology, in particular for ongoing and upcoming large-scale structure\nobservations that are performed to study the inflationary physics. The \"power\nspectrum response\" offers a solution for bispectrum in the so-called squeezed\nlimit, in which one wavenumber is much smaller than the other two. As a first\nstep, we demonstrate that the halo squeezed-limit bispectrum computed from the\nsecond-order standard perturbation theory agrees precisely with the responses\nof linear halo power spectrum to large-scale density and potential\nfluctuations. Since the halo power spectrum responses to arbitrarily small\nscales can straightforwardly be obtained by separate universe simulations, the\nresponse approach provides a novel and powerful technique for modeling the\nnonlinear halo squeezed-limit bispectrum.\n", "  Both fast and slow configurations of rotating neutron stars (NSs) are studied\nwith the recently-constructed unified NS EoSs. The calculations for pure quark\nstars (QSs) and hybrid stars (HSs) are also done, using several updated quark\nmatter EoSs and Gibbs construction for obtaining hadron-quark mixed phase. All\nthree types of EoSs fulfill the recent 2-solar-mass constrain. By confronting\nthe glitch observations with the theoretical calculations for the crustal\nmoment of inertia (MoI), we find that the glitch crisis is still present in\nVela-like pulsars. An upcoming accurate MoI measurement (eg., a possible 10\\%\naccuracy for pulsar PSR J0737-3039A) could distinguish QSs from NSs, since the\nMoIs of QSs are generally $> \\sim 1.5 $ times larger than NSs and HSs, no\nmatter the compactness and the mass of the stars. Using tabulated EoSs, we\ncompute stationary and equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating, relativistic\nstars in general relativity from the well-tested $rns$ code, assuming the\nmatter comprising the star to be a perfect fluid. All three observed properties\nof the short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) internal plateaus sample are simulated\nusing the rotating configurations of NSs/QSs as basic input. We finally argue\nthat for some characteristic SGRBs, the post-merger products of NS-NS mergers\nare probably supramassive QSs rather than NSs, and NS-NS mergers are a\nplausible location for quark deconfinement and the formation of QSs.\n", "  Fulde-Ferrell (FF) Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) phases were proposed for\nsuperconductors or superfluids in strong magnetic field. With the experimental\nprogresses in ultracold atomic systems, topological FFLO phases has also been\nput forward, since it is a natural consequence of realizable spin-orbital\ncoupling (SOC).In this work, we theoretically investigate a triangular lattice\nmodel with SOC and in-plane field. By constructing the phase diagram, we show\nthat it can produce topological FF states with Chern numbers, $C=\\pm1$ and\n$C=-2$. We get the phase boundaries by the change of the sign of Pfaffian. The\nchiral edge states for different topological FF phases are also elucidated.\n", "  We explore for the first time the effect of self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM) on the dark matter (DM) and baryonic distribution in massive galaxies\nformed in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, including explicit baryonic\nphysics treatment. A novel implementation of Super-Massive Black Hole (SMBH)\nformation and evolution is used, as in Tremmel et al.(2015, 2016), allowing to\nexplicitly follow SMBH dynamics at the center of galaxies. A high SIDM constant\ncross-section is chosen, $\\sigma$=10 $\\rm cm^2/gr$, to amplify differences from\nCDM models. Milky Way-like galaxies form a shallower DM density profile in SIDM\nthan they do in CDM, with differences already at 20 kpc scales. This\ndemonstrates that even for the most massive spirals the effect of SIDM\ndominates over the adiabatic contraction due to baryons. Strikingly, the\ndynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case. SMBHs in massive\nspirals have sunk to the centre of their host galaxy in both the SIDM and CDM\nrun, while in less massive galaxies about 80$\\%$ of the SMBH population is\noff-centered in the SIDM case, as opposed to the CDM case in which $\\sim$90$\\%$\nof SMBHs have reached their host's centre. SMBHs are found as far as $\\sim$9\nkpc away from the centre of their host SIDM galaxy. This difference is due to\nthe increased dynamical friction timescale caused by the lower DM density in\nSIDM galaxies compared to CDM, resulting in 'core stalling'. This pilot work\nhighlights the importance of simulating in a full hydrodynamical context\ndifferent DM models combined to SMBH physics to study their influence on galaxy\nformation.\n", "  Assume a lower-dimensional solitonic structure embedded in a higher\ndimensional space, e.g., a 1D dark soliton embedded in 2D space, a ring dark\nsoliton in 2D space, a spherical shell soliton in 3D space etc. By extending\nthe Landau dynamics approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 93}, 240403 (2004)], we\nshow that it is possible to capture the transverse dynamical modes (the \"Kelvin\nmodes\") of the undulation of this \"soliton filament\" within the higher\ndimensional space. These are the transverse stability/instability modes and are\nthe ones potentially responsible for the breakup of the soliton into structures\nsuch as vortices, vortex rings etc. We present the theory and case examples in\n2D and 3D, corroborating the results by numerical stability and dynamical\ncomputations.\n", "  In the present paper we investigate the influence of the retarded access by a\ntime-varying delay on the dynamics of delay systems. We show that there are two\nuniversality classes of delays, which lead to fundamental differences in\ndynamical quantities such as the Lyapunov spectrum. Therefore we introduce an\noperator theoretic framework, where the solution operator of the delay system\nis decomposed into the Koopman operator describing the delay access and an\noperator similar to the solution operator known from systems with constant\ndelay. The Koopman operator corresponds to an iterated map, called access map,\nwhich is defined by the iteration of the delayed argument of the delay\nequation. The dynamics of this one-dimensional iterated map determines the\nuniversality classes of the infinite-dimensional state dynamics governed by the\ndelay differential equation. In this way, we connect the theory of time-delay\nsystems with the theory of circle maps and the framework of the Koopman\noperator. In the present paper we extend our previous work [Otto, M\\\"uller, and\nRadons, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 044104 (2017)], by elaborating the mathematical\ndetails and presenting further results also on the Lyapunov vectors.\n", "  We explore the $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ parafermionic clock-model generalisations of\nthe p-wave Majorana wire model. In particular we examine whether zero-mode\noperators analogous to Majorana zero-modes can be found in these models when\none introduces chiral parameters to break time reversal symmetry. The existence\nof such zero-modes implies $N$-fold degeneracies throughout the energy\nspectrum. We address the question directly through these degeneracies by\ncharacterising the entire energy spectrum using perturbation theory and exact\ndiagonalisation. We find that when $N$ is prime, and the length $L$ of the wire\nis finite, the spectrum exhibits degeneracies up to a splitting that decays\nexponentially with system size, for generic values of the chiral parameters.\nHowever, at particular parameter values (resonance points), band crossings\nappear in the unperturbed spectrum that typically result in a splitting of the\ndegeneracy at finite order. We find strong evidence that these preclude the\nexistence of strong zero-modes for generic values of the chiral parameters. In\nparticular we show that in the thermodynamic limit, the resonance points become\ndense in the chiral parameter space. When $N$ is not prime, the situation is\nqualitatively different, and degeneracies in the energy spectrum are split at\nfinite order in perturbation theory for generic parameter values, even when the\nlength of the wire $L$ is finite. Exceptions to these general findings can\noccur at special \"anti-resonant\" points. Here the evidence points to the\nexistence of strong zero modes and, in the case of the achiral point of the the\n$N=4$ model, we are able to construct these modes exactly.\n", "  We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of two opposite jets\nlaunched obliquely to the orbital plane around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstar and within its dense wind, and demonstrate the formation of a `messy'\nplanetary nebula (PN), namely, a PN lacking any type of symmetry (highly\nirregular). In building the initial conditions we assume that a tight binary\nsystem orbits the AGB star, and that the orbital plane of the tight binary\nsystem is inclined to the orbital plane of the binary system and the AGB star\n(the triple system plane). We further assume that the accreted mass on to the\ntight binary system forms an accretion disk around one of the stars, and that\nthe plane of the disk is tilted to the orbital plane of the triple system. The\nhighly asymmetrical and filamentary structure that we obtain support the notion\nthat messy PNe might be shaped by triple stellar systems.\n", "  We explore the multiplicity of exoplanet host stars with high-resolution\nimages obtained with VLT/SPHERE. Two different samples of systems were\nobserved: one containing low-eccentricity outer planets, and the other\ncontaining high-eccentricity outer planets. We find that 10 out of 34 stars in\nthe high-eccentricity systems are members of a binary, while the proportion is\n3 out of 27 for circular systems. Eccentric-exoplanet hosts are, therefore,\nsignificantly more likely to have a stellar companion than circular-exoplanet\nhosts. The median magnitude contrast over the 68 data sets is 11.26 and 9.25,\nin H and K, respectively, at 0.30 arcsec. The derived detection limits reveal\nthat binaries with separations of less than 50au are rarer for exoplanet hosts\nthan for field stars. Our results also imply that the majority of\nhigh-eccentricity planets are not embedded in multiple stellar systems (24 out\nof 34), since our detection limits exclude the presence of a stellar companion.\nWe detect the low-mass stellar companions of HD 7449 and HD 211847, both\nmembers of our high-eccentricity sample. HD 7449B was already detected by\nRodigas et al (2016) and our independent observation is in agreement with this\nearlier work. HD 211847's substellar companion, previously detected by the\nradial velocity method, is actually a low-mass star seen face-on. The role of\nstellar multiplicity in shaping planetary systems is confirmed by this work,\nalthough it does not appear as the only source of dynamical excitation.\n", "  We performed electronic structure calculations based on the first-principles\nmany-body theory approach in order to study quasiparticle band gaps, and\noptical absorption spectra of hydrogen-passivated zigzag SiC nanoribbons.\nSelf-energy corrections are included using the GW approximation, and excitonic\neffects are included using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We have systematically\nstudied nanoribbons that have widths between 0.6 $\\text{nm}$ and 2.2\n$\\text{nm}$. Quasiparticle corrections widened the Kohn-Sham band gaps because\nof enhanced interaction effects, caused by reduced dimensionality. Zigzag SiC\nnanoribbons with widths larger than 1 nm, exhibit half-metallicity at the\nmean-field level. The self-energy corrections increased band gaps\nsubstantially, thereby transforming the half-metallic zigzag SiC nanoribbons,\nto narrow gap spin-polarized semiconductors. Optical absorption spectra of\nthese nanoribbons get dramatically modified upon inclusion of electron-hole\ninteractions, and the narrowest ribbon exhibits strongly bound excitons, with\nbinding energy of 2.1 eV. Thus, the narrowest zigzag SiC nanoribbon has the\npotential to be used in optoelectronic devices operating in the IR region of\nthe spectrum, while the broader ones, exhibiting spin polarization, can be\nutilized in spintronic applications.\n", "  The Hylleraas-B-splines basis set is introduced in this paper, which can be\nused to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of helium-like system's\nHamiltonian. Comparing with traditional B-splines basis, the rate of\nconvergence of our results has been significantly improved. Through combine\nthis method and pseudo-states sum over scheme, we obtained the high precision\nvalues of static dipole porlarizabilities of the $1{}^1S-5{}^1S$,\n$2{}^3S-6{}^3S$ states of helium in length and velocity gauges respectively,\nand the results get good agreements. The final extrapolate results of\nporlarizabilities in different quantum states arrived eight significant digits\nat least, which fully illustrates the advantage and convenience of this method\nin the problems involving continuous states.\n", "  (Abridged) The recent measurement of the mass of two $2\\, M_\\odot$ pulsars\nhas raised the question whether such large masses allow for the existence of\nexotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons, inside neutron stars. In the\npresent work we will investigate how the existing hypernuclei properties may\nconstrain the neutron star equation of state and confront the neutron star\nmaximum masses obtained with equations of state calibrated to hypernuclei\nproperties with the astrophysical $2\\,M_\\odot$ constraint.\n  The study is performed using a relativistic mean field approach to describe\nboth the hypernuclei and the neutron star equations of state. A set of five\nmodels consistent with $2\\,M_\\odot$ for a purely nucleonic composition are\nemployed. The $\\Lambda$-meson couplings are determined for all the models\nconsidered. Hyperonic stars with the complete baryonic octet are studied,\nrestricting the coupling of the $\\Sigma$ and $\\Xi$ hyperons to the $\\omega-$,\n$\\rho-$ and $\\sigma-$mesons due to the lack of experimental data, and maximum\nstar masses calculated for unified equations of state. We conclude that the\ncurrently available hypernuclei experimental data and the lack of constraints\non the asymmetric equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities do not\nallow to further constrain the neutron star matter equation of state using the\nrecent $2\\, M_\\odot$ observations. It is also shown that the $\\Lambda$\npotential in symmetric nuclear matter takes a value $\\sim 30-32$ MeV at\nsaturation for the $g_{\\omega \\Lambda}$ coupling given by the SU(6) symmetry,\nclose to values generally used in the literature. However, the $\\Lambda$\npotential in $\\Lambda$ matter varies between -16 and -8 MeV taking for vector\nmesons couplings the SU(6) values, at variance with generally employed values\nbetween $-1$ and $-5$ MeV.\n", "  Superconducting 2H-NbSe2 single crystals show intrinsic low pinning values.\nTherefore, they are ideal materials with which to explore fundamental\nproperties of vortices. (V, I) characteristics are the experimental data we\nhave used to investigate the dissipation mechanisms in a rectangular shape\n2H-NbSe2 single crystal. Particularly, we have studied dissipation behavior\nwith magnetic fields applied in the plane of the crystal and parallel to the\ninjected currents, i.e. in the force-free state where the vortex helical\ninstability governs the vortex dynamics. In this regime, the data follow the\nelliptic critical state model and the voltage dissipation shows an exponential\ndependence.Moreover, this exponential dependence can be observed for in-plane\napplied magnetic fields up to 40 degrees off the current direction, which\nimplies that the vortex helical instability plays a role in dissipation even\nout of the force-free configuration.\n", "  In this work, we present a theoretical study of polaron states in a double\nquantum dot system. We present realistic calculations which combine 8 band \\kp\nmodel, configuration interaction approach and collective modes method. We\ninvestigate the dependence of polaron energy branches on axial electric field.\nWe show that coupling between carriers and longitudinal optical phonons via\nFr\\\"{o}hlich interaction leads to qualitative and quantitative reconstruction\nof the optical spectra. In particular, we study the structure of resonances\nbetween the states localized in different dots. We show that $p$-shell states\nare strongly coupled to the phonon replicas of $s$-shell states, in contrast to\nthe weak direct $s$-$p$ coupling. We discuss also the dependence of the\nphonon-assisted tunnel coupling strength on the separation between the dots.\n", "  We present a multi-aperture analyser set-up for performing X-ray phase\ncontrast imaging in planar and three-dimensional modalities. A multi-slice\nrepresentation of the sample is used to establish a quantitative relation\nbetween projection images and the corresponding three-dimensional\ndistributions, leading to successful tomographic reconstruction. Sample\nabsorption, phase and scattering are retrieved from the measurement of five\nintensity projections. The method is experimentally tested on custom built\nphantoms with synchrotron radiation: sample absorption and phase can be\nreliably retrieved also in combination with strong scatterers, simultaneously\noffering high sensitivity and dynamic range.\n", "  Recently, a new measurement of the auto- and cross-correlation angular power\nspectrum (APS) of the isotropic gamma-ray background was performed, based on 81\nmonths of data of the Fermi Large-Area Telescope (LAT). Here, we fit, for the\nfirst time, the new APS data with a model describing the emission of unresolved\nblazars. These sources are expected to dominate the anisotropy signal. The\nmodel we employ in our analysis reproduces well the blazars resolved by Fermi\nLAT. When considering the APS obtained by masking the sources in the 3FGL\ncatalogue, we find that unresolved blazars under-produce the measured APS below\n$\\sim$1 GeV. Contrary to past results, this suggests the presence of a new\ncontribution to the low-energy APS, with a significance of, at least,\n5$\\sigma$. The excess can be ascribed to a new class of faint gamma-ray\nemitters. If we consider the APS obtained by masking the sources in the 2FGL\ncatalogue, there is no under-production of the APS below 1 GeV, but the new\nsource class is still preferred over the blazars-only scenario (with a\nsignificance larger than 10$\\sigma$). The properties of the new source class\nand the level of anisotropies induced in the isotropic gamma-ray background are\nthe same, independent of the APS data used. In particular, the new gamma-ray\nemitters must have a soft energy spectrum, with a spectral index ranging,\napproximately, from 2.7 to 3.2. This complicates their interpretation in terms\nof known sources, since, normally, star-forming and radio galaxies are observed\nwith a harder spectrum. The new source class identified here is also expected\nto contribute significantly to the intensity of the isotropic gamma-ray\nbackground.\n", "  Diffraction gratings disperse light in a rainbow of colors with the opposite\norder than refractive prisms, a phenomenon known as negative dispersion. While\nrefractive dispersion can be controlled via material refractive index,\ndiffractive dispersion is fundamentally an interference effect dictated by\ngeometry. Here we show that this fundamental property can be altered using\ndielectric metasurfaces, and we experimentally demonstrate diffractive gratings\nand focusing mirrors with positive, zero, and hyper negative dispersion. These\noptical elements are implemented using a reflective metasurface composed of\ndielectric nano-posts that provide simultaneous control over phase and its\nwavelength derivative. In addition, as a first practical application, we\ndemonstrate a focusing mirror that exhibits a five fold reduction in chromatic\ndispersion, and thus an almost three times increase in operation bandwidth\ncompared to a regular diffractive element. This concept challenges the\ngenerally accepted dispersive properties of diffractive optical devices and\nextends their applications and functionalities.\n", "  It is widely known that bouncing models with a dust hydrodynamical fluid\nsatisfying ${c_s^2=p_d/\\rho_d\\approx 0}$, where $c_s, p_d, \\rho_d$ are the\nsound velocity, pressure and energy density of the dust fluid, respectively,\nhave almost scale invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations and negligible\nprimordial gravitational waves. We investigate whether adding another fluid\nwith $1/3 < \\lambda = p/\\rho < 1$, which should dominate near the bounce, can\nincrease the amplitude of gravitational waves in the high frequency regime,\nturning them detectable in near future observations for such range of\nfrequencies. Indeed, we show that the energy density of primordial\ngravitational waves is proportional to $k^{2(9\\lambda-1)/(1+3\\lambda)}$ for\nwavelengths which become bigger than the Hubble radius when this extra fluid\ndominates the background. Hence, as $\\lambda \\to 1$ (an almost stiff matter\nfluid), the energy density of primordial gravitational waves will increase\nfaster in frequency, turning them potentially detectable at high frequencies.\nHowever, there is an extra factor $I_q(\\lambda)$ in the amplitude which\ndecreases exponentially with $\\lambda$. The net effect of these two\ncontributions turns the energy density of primordial gravitational waves not\nsufficiently big at high frequencies in order to be detected by present day or\nnear future observations for models which satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds\nand is symmetric with respect to the bounce. Hence, symmetric bouncing models\nwhere the background is dominated by a dust hydrodynamical fluid with small\nsound velocity, do not present any significant amount of primordial\ngravitational waves at any frequency range compatible with observations, even\nif there are other fields present in the model dominating the bounce phase. Any\ndetection of such waves will then rule out this kind of models.\n", "  Metal-Insulator-Metal tunnel junctions (MIMTJ) are common throughout the\nmicroelectronics industry. The industry standard AlOx tunnel barrier, formed\nthrough oxygen diffusion into an Al wetting layer, is plagued by internal\ndefects and pinholes which prevent the realization of atomically-thin barriers\ndemanded for enhanced quantum coherence. In this work, we employed in situ\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) along with molecular dynamics simulations\nto understand and control the growth of atomically thin Al2O3 tunnel barriers\nusing atomic layer deposition (ALD). We found that a carefully tuned initial\nH2O pulse hydroxylated the Al surface and enabled the creation of an\natomically-thin Al2O3 tunnel barrier with a high quality M-I interface and a\nsignificantly enhanced barrier height compared to thermal AlOx. These\nproperties, corroborated by fabricated Josephson Junctions, show that ALD Al2O3\nis a dense, leak-free tunnel barrier with a low defect density which can be a\nkey component for the next-generation of MIMTJs.\n", "  Aims. To produce an homogeneous catalog of astrophysical parameters of 239\nresolved star clusters located in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds,\nobserved in the Washington photometric system.\n  Methods. The cluster sample was processed with the recently introduced\nAutomated Stellar Cluster Analysis ($\\texttt{ASteCA}$) package, which ensures\nboth an automatized and a fully reproducible treatment, together with a\nstatistically based analysis of their fundamental parameters and associated\nuncertainties. The fundamental parameters determined with this tool for each\ncluster, via a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis, are: metallicity, age,\nreddening, distance modulus, and total mass.\n  Results. We generated an homogeneous catalog of structural and fundamental\nparameters for the studied cluster sample, and performed a detailed internal\nerror analysis along with a thorough comparison with values taken from\ntwenty-six published articles. We studied the distribution of cluster\nfundamental parameters in both Clouds, and obtained their age-metallicity\nrelationships.\n  Conclusions. The $\\texttt{ASteCA}$ package can be applied to an unsupervised\ndetermination of fundamental cluster parameters; a task of increasing relevance\nas more data becomes available through upcoming surveys.\n", "  We build a statistical description of fermions, taking into account the spin\ndegree of freedom in addition to the momentum of particles, and we detail its\nuse in the context of the kinetic theory of gases of fermions particles. We\nshow that the one-particle distribution function needed to write a Liouville\nequation is a spinor valued operator. The degrees of freedom of this function\nare covariantly described by an intensity function and by a polarisation vector\nwhich are parallel transported by free streaming. Collisions are described on\nthe microscopic level and lead to a Boltzmann equation for this operator. We\napply our formalism to the case of weak interactions, which at low energies can\nbe considered as a contact interaction between fermions, allowing us to discuss\nthe structure of the collision term for a few typical weak-interaction mediated\nreactions. In particular we find for massive particles that a dipolar\ndistribution of velocities in the interacting species is necessary to generate\nlinear polarisation, as opposed to the case of photons for which linear\npolarisation is generated from the quadrupolar distribution of velocities.\n", "  The paper presents an analysis of Polish Fireball Network (PFN) observations\nof enhanced activity of the Southern Taurid meteor shower in 2005 and 2015. In\n2005, between October 20 and November 10, seven stations of PFN determined 107\naccurate orbits with 37 of them belonging to the Southern Taurid shower. In the\nsame period of 2015, 25 stations of PFN recorded 719 accurate orbits with 215\norbits of the Southern Taurids. Both maxima were rich in fireballs which\naccounted to 17% of all observed Taurids. The whole sample of Taurid fireballs\nis quite uniform in the sense of starting and terminal heights of the\ntrajectory. On the other hand a clear decreasing trend in geocentric velocity\nwith increasing solar longitude was observed.\n  Orbital parameters of observed Southern Taurids were compared to orbital\nelements of Near Earth Objects (NEO) from the NEODYS-2 database. Using the\nDrummond criterion $D'$ with threshold as low as 0.06, we found over 100\nfireballs strikingly similar to the orbit of asteroid 2015 TX24. Several dozens\nof Southern Taurids have orbits similar to three other asteroids, namely: 2005\nTF50, 2005 UR and 2010 TU149. All mentioned NEOs have orbital periods very\nclose to the 7:2 resonance with Jupiter's orbit. It confirms a theory of a\n\"resonant meteoroid swarm\" within the Taurid complex that predicts that in\nspecific years, the Earth is hit by a greater number of meteoroids capable of\nproducing fireballs.\n", "  We report on numerical constructions of fully non-linear geons in\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes in four dimensions. Our approach\nis based on 3+1 formalism and spectral methods in a gauge combining maximal\nslicing and spatial harmonic coordinates. We are able to construct several\nfamilies of geons seeded by different families of spherical harmonics. We can\nreach unprecedentedly high amplitudes, with mass of order $\\sim 1/2$ of the AdS\nlength, and with deviations of the order of 50\\% compared to third order\nperturbative approaches. The consistency of our results with numerical\nresolution is carefully checked and we give extensive precision monitoring\ntechniques. All global quantities like mass and angular momentum are computed\nusing two independent frameworks that agree each other at the $0.1\\%$ level. We\nalso provide strong evidence for the existence of excited (i.e. with one radial\nnode) geon solutions of Einstein equations in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by\nconstructing them numerically.\n", "  The competition between antiferromagnetic (AF) order and singlet formation is\na central phenomenon of the Kondo and Periodic Anderson Hamiltonians, and of\nthe heavy fermion materials they describe. In this paper, we explore the\neffects of an additional conduction band on magnetism in these models, and,\nspecifically, on changes in the AF-singlet quantum critical point (QCP) and the\none particle and spin spectral functions. To understand the magnetic phase\ntransition qualitatively, we first carry out a self-consistent mean field\ntheory (MFT). The basic conclusion is that, at half-filling, the coupling to\nthe additional band stabilizes the AF phase to larger $f$ $d$ hybridization $V$\nin the PAM. We also explore the possibility of competing ferromagnetic phases\nwhen this conduction band is doped away from half-filling. We next employ\nQuantum Monte Carlo (QMC) which, in combination with finite size scaling,\nallows us to evaluate the position of the QCP using an exact treatment of the\ninteractions. This approach confirms the stabilization of AF order, which\noccurs through an enhancement of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction. QMC results for the spectral function $A(\\textbf{q},\\omega)$ and\ndynamic spin structure factor $\\chi(\\textbf{q},\\omega)$ yield additional\ninsight into the AF-singlet competition and the low temperature phases.\n", "  We demonstrate new mechanisms for gate tunable current partition at\ntopological zero-line intersections in a graphene-based current splitter. Based\non numerical calculations of the non-equilibrium Green's functions and\nLandauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formula, we show that the presence of a perpendicular\nmagnetic field on the order of a few Teslas allows for carrier sign dependent\ncurrent routing.\n  In the zero-field limit the control on current routing and partition can be\nachieved within a range of $10\\%$-$90\\%$ of the total incoming current by\ntuning the carrier density at tilted intersections, or by modifying the\nrelative magnitude of the bulk band gaps via gate voltage. We discuss the\nimplications of our findings in the design of topological zero-line networks\nwhere finite orbital magnetic moments are expected when the current partition\nis asymmetric.\n", "  Using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we propose a\nmicroscopic theory for near-field heat transfer between charged metal plates\nfocusing on the Coulomb interactions. Tight-binding models for the electrons\nare coupled to the electromagnetic field continuum through a scalar potential.\nOur approach differs from the established ones based on Rytov fluctuational\nelectrodynamics, which deals with the transverse radiative field and vector\npotential. For a two quantum-dot model a new length scale emerges below which\nthe heat current exhibits great enhancement. This length scale is related to\nthe physics of parallel plate capacitors. At long distances $d$, the energy\nflux decreases as $1/d^2$.\n", "  Core-collapse supernova explosions expose the structure and environment of\nmassive stars at the moment of their death. We use the global fitting technique\nof Pejcha & Prieto (2015a,b) to estimate a set of physical parameters of 19\nnormal Type II SNe, such as their distance moduli, reddenings, $^{56}$Ni masses\n$M_{\\rm Ni}$, and explosion energies $E_{\\rm exp}$ from multicolor light curves\nand photospheric velocity curves. We confirm and characterize known\ncorrelations between $M_{\\rm Ni}$ and bolometric luminosity at 50 days after\nthe explosion, and between $M_{\\rm Ni}$ and $E_{\\rm exp}$. We pay special\nattention to the observed distribution of $M_{\\rm Ni}$ coming from a joint\nsample of 38 Type~II SNe, which can be described as a skewed-Gaussian-like\ndistribution between $0.005~M_{\\odot}$ and $0.280~M_{\\odot}$, with a median of\n$0.031~M_{\\odot}$, mean of $0.046~M_{\\odot}$, standard deviation of\n$0.048~M_{\\odot}$ and skewness of $3.050$. We use two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest and two-sample Anderson-Darling test to compare the observed distribution\nof $M_{\\rm Ni}$ to results from theoretical hydrodynamical codes of\ncore-collapse explosions with the neutrino mechanism presented in the\nliterature. Our results show that the theoretical distributions obtained from\nthe codes tested in this work, KEPLER and Prometheus Hot Bubble, are compatible\nwith the observations irrespective of different pre-supernova calibrations and\ndifferent maximum mass of the progenitors.\n", "  A generalization of Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) model of\nmodified gravity has recently been proposed as an alternative to dark matter.\nThis model -- which we will refer to as g-TeVeS -- utilizes a Galileon-induced\nVainshtein mechanism to suppress modifications to General Relativity in strong\ngravity regimes and so avoids the need to introduce the baroque kinetic terms\nthat typically exist in relativistic models of Modified Newtonian Dynamics\n(MOND).\n  We explore the behavior of this model in spacetimes with exact\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) symmetry. The ability of the theory to recover\nMOND phenomenology places restrictions on the theory's parameter space and it\nis found that within an estimate of this area of parameter space the theory\ncannot successfully approximate the Friedmannian cosmological behavior of cold\ndark matter. It is found that much closer agreement may be recovered in other\nregions of the theory's parameter space and the reasons for this are discussed.\n", "  We propose the use of a waveguidelike transmission line based on\ndirect-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUID) and\ndemonstrate that the node flux in this transmission line behaves in the same\nway as quantum fields in an expanding (or contracting) universe. We show how to\ndetect the analog cosmological particle generation and analyze its feasibility\nwith current circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) technology. Our setup in\nprinciple paves a new way for the exploration of analogue quantum gravitational\neffects.\n", "  High-field magnetization of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnet\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$ was measured in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 56 T\nin order to study its magnetic phase diagram. When the field was applied along\nthe easy axis (the $a$-axis), two distinct transitions were observed at\n$H_{c1}=6.5$~T and $H_{c2}=18.0$~T. The former is a spin-flop transition\ntypical for a collinear antiferromagnet and the latter is believed to be a\nspin-flip transition of canted moments. The canted moments, which are induced\nby the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, anti-align for $H_{c1}<H<H_{c2}$ due\nto the anisotropic exchange interaction that favors the antiferromagnetic\narrangement along the $a$-axis. Above $H_{c2}$, the Zeeman energy of the\napplied field overcomes the antiferromagnetic anisotropic interaction and the\ncanted moments are aligned along the field direction. Density functional theory\nwas employed to compute the exchange interactions, which were used as inputs\nfor quantum Monte Carlo calculations and then further refined by fitting to the\nmagnetic susceptibility data. Contrary to our previous report in Phys. Rev. B\n{\\bf 92}, 024423, the dominant exchange interaction is between the third\nnearest-neighbor spins, which form zigzag spin-chains that are coupled with one\nanother through an intertwining network of the nonnegligible nearest and second\nnearest-neighbor interactions. In addition, elastic neutron scattering under\nthe applied magnetic fields of up to 10 T reveals the incommensurate helical\nspin structure in the spin-flop state.\n", "  Real-time access to the internal ultrafast dynamics of complex dissipative\noptical systems opens new explorations of pulse-pulse interactions and dynamic\npatterns. We present the first direct experimental evidence of the internal\nmotion of a dissipative optical soliton molecule generated in a passively\nmodelocked erbium-doped fiber laser. We map the internal motions of a soliton\npair molecule by using a dispersive Fourier-transform imaging technique,\nrevealing different categories of internal pulsations, including vibration-like\nand phase drifting dynamics. Our experiments agree well with numerical\npredictions and bring insights to the analogy between self-organized states of\nlights and states of the matter.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the convection phenomenon in the intracluster\nmedium (the weakly-collisional magnetized inhomogeneous plasma permeating\ngalaxy clusters) where the concentration gradient of the Helium ions is not\nignorable. To this end, we build upon the general machinery employed to study\nthe salt finger instability found in the oceans. The salt finger instability is\na form of double diffusive convection where the diffusions of two physical\nquantities---heat and salt concentrations---occur with different diffusion\nrates. The analogous instability in the intracluster medium may result owing to\nthe magnetic field mediated anisotropic diffusions of the heat and the Helium\nions (in the sea of the Hydrogen ions and the free electrons). These two\ndiffusions have inherently different diffusion rates. Hence the convection\ncaused by the onset of this instability is an example of double diffusive\nconvection in the astrophysical settings. A consequence of this instability is\nthe formation of the vertical filamentary structures having more concentration\nof the Helium ions with respect to the immediate neighbourhoods of the\nfilaments. We term these structures as Helium fingers in analogy with the salt\nfingers found in the case of the salt finger instability. Here we show that the\nwidth of a Helium finger scales as one-fourth power of the radius of the inner\nregion of the intracluster medium in the supercritical regime. We also\ndetermine the explicit mathematical expression of the criterion for the onset\nof the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability modified by the presence of\ninhomogeneously distributed Helium ions.\n", "  Growth, electronic and magnetic properties of $\\gamma'$-Fe$_{4}$N atomic\nlayers on Cu(001) are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and\nx-ray absorption spectroscopy/magnetic circular dichroism. A continuous film of\nordered trilayer $\\gamma'$-Fe$_{4}$N is obtained by Fe deposition under N$_{2}$\natmosphere onto monolayer Fe$_{2}$N/Cu(001), while the repetition of a\nbombardment with 0.5 keV N$^{+}$ ions during growth cycles results in imperfect\nbilayer $\\gamma'$-Fe$_{4}$N. The increase in the sample thickness causes the\nchange of the surface electronic structure, as well as the enhancement in the\nspin magnetic moment of Fe atoms reaching $\\sim$ 1.4 $\\mu_{\\mathrm B}$/atom in\nthe trilayer sample. The observed thickness-dependent properties of the system\nare well interpreted by layer-resolved density of states calculated using first\nprinciples, which demonstrates the strongly layer-dependent electronic states\nwithin each surface, subsurface, and interfacial plane of the\n$\\gamma'$-Fe$_{4}$N atomic layers on Cu(001).\n", "  We present the first azimuthally differential measurements of the pion source\nsize relative to the second harmonic event plane in Pb-Pb collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV.\nThe measurements have been performed in the centrality range 0-50% and for pion\npair transverse momenta $0.2 < k_{\\rm T} < 0.7$ GeV/$c$. We find that the\n$R_{\\rm side}$ and $R_{\\rm out}$ radii, which characterize the pion source size\nin the directions perpendicular and parallel to the pion transverse momentum,\noscillate out of phase, similar to what was observed at the Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider (RHIC). The final-state source eccentricity, estimated via $R_{\\rm\nside}$ oscillations, is found to be significantly smaller than the\ninitial-state source eccentricity, but remains positive; indicating that even\nafter a stronger expansion in the in-plane direction, the pion source at the\nfreeze-out is still elongated in the out-of-plane direction. The 3+1D\nhydrodynamic calculations are in qualitative agreement with observed centrality\nand transverse momentum $R_{\\rm side}$ oscillations, but systematically\nunderestimate the oscillation magnitude.\n", "  One of the most fundamental questions one can ask about a pair of random\nvariables X and Y is the value of their mutual information. Unfortunately, this\ntask is often stymied by the extremely large dimension of the variables. We\nmight hope to replace each variable by a lower-dimensional representation that\npreserves the relationship with the other variable. The theoretically ideal\nimplementation is the use of minimal sufficient statistics, where it is\nwell-known that either X or Y can be replaced by their minimal sufficient\nstatistic about the other while preserving the mutual information. While\nintuitively reasonable, it is not obvious or straightforward that both\nvariables can be replaced simultaneously. We demonstrate that this is in fact\npossible: the information X's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about Y is\nexactly the information that Y's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about\nX. As an important corollary, we consider the case where one variable is a\nstochastic process' past and the other its future and the present is viewed as\na memoryful channel. In this case, the mutual information is the channel\ntransmission rate between the channel's effective states. That is, the\npast-future mutual information (the excess entropy) is the amount of\ninformation about the future that can be predicted using the past. Translating\nour result about minimal sufficient statistics, this is equivalent to the\nmutual information between the forward- and reverse-time causal states of\ncomputational mechanics. We close by discussing multivariate extensions to this\nuse of minimal sufficient statistics.\n", "  Three-mode parametric instability is a threat to attaining design power\nlevels in Advanced gravitational wave detectors. The first observation of\nthree-mode parametric instability in a long optical cavity revealed that\ninstabilities could be suppressed by time variation of the mirror radius of\ncurvature. In this paper, we present three dimensional finite element analysis\nof this thermo-acousto-optics system to determine whether thermal modulation\ncould provide sufficient instability's suppression without degrading time\naveraged optical performance. It is shown that deformations due to the time\naveraged heating profile on the mirror surface can be compensated by rear\nsurface heating of the test mass. Results show that a $CO_2$ laser heating beam\nwith a modulation amplitude of $1$ Watt at 0.01 Hz is sufficient to stabilize\nacoustic mode with parametric gain up to 3. The parametric gain suppression\nfactor is linearly proportional to the peak modulation power.\n", "  The photovoltaic reciprocity theory relates the electroluminescence spectrum\nof a solar cell under applied bias to the external photovoltaic quantum\nefficiency of the device as measured at short circuit conditions. Its\nderivation is based on detailed balance relations between local absorption and\nemission rates in optically isotropic media with non-degenerate\nquasi-equilibrium carrier distributions. In many cases, the dependence of\ndensity and spatial variation of electronic and optical device states on the\npoint of operation is modest and the reciprocity relation holds. In\nnanostructure-based photovoltaic devices exploiting confined modes, however,\nthe underlying assumptions are no longer justifiable. In the case of ultrathin\nabsorber solar cells, the modification of the electronic structure with applied\nbias is significant due to the large variation of the built-in field.\nStraightforward use of the external quantum efficiency as measured at short\ncircuit conditions in the photovoltaic reciprocity theory thus fails to\nreproduce the electroluminescence spectrum at large forward bias voltage. This\nfailure is demonstrated here by numerical simulation of both spectral\nquantities at normal incidence and emission for an ultrathin GaAs p-i-n solar\ncell using an advanced quantum kinetic formalism based on non-equilibrium\nGreen's functions of coupled photons and charge carriers. While coinciding with\nthe semiclassical relations under the conditions of their validity, the theory\nprovides a consistent microscopic relationship between absorption, emission and\ncharge carrier transport in photovoltaic devices at arbitrary operating\nconditions and for any shape of optical and electronic density of states.\n", "  The initial geometry effect on collective flows, which are inherited from\ninitial projectile structure, is studied in relativistic heavy-ion collisions\nof $^{12}$C + Au by using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). Elliptic flow\n($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) which are significantly resulted from the\nchain and triangle structure of $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ with three-$\\alpha$ clusters,\nrespectively, in central $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$+$^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$ collisions are\ncompared with the flow from the Woods-Saxon distribution of nucleons in\n$^{12}\\mathrm{C}$. $v_3/v_2$ is proposed as a probe to distinguish the pattern\nof $\\alpha$-clustered $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$. This study demonstrates that the\ninitial geometry of the collision zone inherited from nuclear structure can be\nexplored by collective flow at the final stage in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We propose a two-dimensional plasmonic platform - periodically patterned\nmonolayer graphene - which hosts topological one-way edge states operable up to\ninfrared frequencies. We classify the band topology of this plasmonic system\nunder time-reversal-symmetry breaking induced by a static magnetic field. At\nfinite doping, the system supports topologically nontrivial bandgaps with\nmid-gap frequencies up to tens of terahertz. By the bulk-edge correspondence,\nthese bandgaps host topologically protected one-way edge plasmons, which are\nimmune to backscattering from structural defects and subject only to intrinsic\nmaterial and radiation loss. Our findings reveal a promising approach to\nengineer topologically robust chiral plasmonic devices and demonstrate a\nrealistic example of high-frequency topological edge state.\n", "  Inspired by a class of algorithms proposed by Farhi et al. (arXiv:1411.4028),\nnamely the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we present a\ncircuit-based quantum algorithm to search for a needle in a haystack, obtaining\nthe same quadratic speedup achieved by Grover's original algorithm. In our\nalgorithm, the problem Hamiltonian (oracle) and a transverse field are applied\nalternately to the system in a periodic manner. We introduce a technique, based\non spin-coherent states, to analyze the composite unitary in a single period.\nThis composite unitary drives a closed transition between two states that have\nhigh degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state,\nrespectively. The transition rate in our algorithm is of order $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt\nN)$, and the overlaps are of order $\\Theta(1)$, yielding a nearly optimal query\ncomplexity of $T\\simeq \\sqrt N (\\pi/2\\sqrt 2\\,)$. Our algorithm is a QAOA\ncircuit that demonstrates a quantum advantage with a large number of iterations\nthat is not derived from Trotterization of an adiabatic quantum optimization\n(AQO) algorithm. It also suggests that the analysis required to understand QAOA\ncircuits involves a very different process from estimating the energy gap of a\nHamiltonian in AQO.\n", "  Coy dark matter is an effective scheme in which a fermionic dark matter\ncandidate interacts with the Standard Model fermions via a pseudoscalar\nmediator. This simple setup avoids the strong constraints posed by direct\ndetection experiments in a natural way and explains, on top of the observed\ndark matter relic abundance, the spatially extended gamma-ray excess recently\ndetected at the Galactic Center. In this Letter we study the phenomenology of\ncoy dark matter accounting for a novel signature of the model: the diphoton\nannihilation signal induced by the Standard Model fermions at the loop level.\nBy challenging the model with the observations of spheroidal dwarf satellite\ngalaxies and the results of gamma-ray line searches obtained by the Fermi LAT\nexperiment, we assess its compatibility with the measured dark matter relic\nabundance and the Galactic Center excesses. We show that despite the gamma-ray\nline constraint rules out a significant fraction of the considered parameter\nspace, the region connected to the observed Galactic Center excess remains\ncurrently viable. Nevertheless, we find that next-generation experiments such\nas DAMPE, HERD and GAMMA-400 have the potential to probe exhaustively this\nelusive scenario.\n", "  We propose an extension of the standard model (SM) with $U(1)_{\\mu-\\tau}$\ngauge symmetry, extra vectorlike quark doublets $Q'_a$ and singlet scalar\n$\\chi$, both of which are charged under $U(1)_{\\mu-\\tau}$ and carry {odd} dark\n$Z_2$ parity. Then assuming that $\\chi$ is the dark matter (DM) of the universe\nand imposing various constraints from dark matter search, flavor physics and\ncollider search for $Q'_a$, one can show that radiative corrections to\n$b\\rightarrow s Z^{'*} \\rightarrow s l^+ l^- $ involving $Q'_a$ and $\\chi$ can\ninduce $\\Delta C_9 \\sim -1$ which can resolve the LHCb anomalies related with\n$B\\to K^{(*)} \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. Therefore both DM and $B$ physics anomalies could\nbe accommodated in the model.\n", "  A resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of overdamped\nspin-excitations in slightly underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with\n$x=0.12$ and $0.145$ is presented. Three high-symmetry directions have been\ninvestigated: (1) the antinodal $(0,0)\\rightarrow (1/2,0)$, (2) the nodal\n$(0,0)\\rightarrow (1/4,1/4)$ and (3) the zone boundary direction\n$(1/2,0)\\rightarrow (1/4,1/4)$ connecting these two. The overdamped excitations\nexhibit strong dispersions along (1) and (3), whereas a much more modest\ndispersion is found along (2). This is in strong contrast to the undoped\ncompound La$_{2}$CuO$_4$ (LCO) for which the strongest dispersions are found\nalong (1) and (2). The $t-t^{\\prime}-t^{\\prime\\prime}-U$ Hubbard model used to\nexplain the excitation spectrum of LCO predicts $-$ for constant $U/t$ $-$ that\nthe dispersion along (3) scales with $(t^{\\prime}/t)^2$. However, the diagonal\nhopping $t^{\\prime}$ extracted on LSCO using single-band models is low\n($t^{\\prime}/t\\sim-0.16$) and decreasing with doping. We therefore invoked a\ntwo-orbital ($d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$) model which implies that $t^{\\prime}$\nis enhanced. This effect acts to enhance the zone-boundary dispersion within\nthe Hubbard model. We thus conclude that hybridization of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and\n$d_{z^2}$ states has a significant impact on the zone-boundary dispersion in\nLSCO.\n", "  In this work we study the impact of chromatic focusing of few-cycle laser\npulses on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) through analysis of the emitted\nextreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation. Chromatic focusing is usually avoided in\nthe few-cycle regime, as the pulse spatio-temporal structure may be highly\ndistorted by the spatiotemporal aberrations. Here, however, we demonstrate it\nas an additional control parameter to modify the generated XUV radiation. We\npresent experiments where few-cycle pulses are focused by a singlet lens in a\nKr gas jet. The chromatic distribution of focal lengths allows us to tune HHG\nspectra by changing the relative singlet-target distance. Interestingly, we\nalso show that the degree of chromatic aberration needed to this control does\nnot degrade substantially the harmonic conversion efficiency, still allowing\nfor the generation of supercontinua with the chirped-pulse scheme, demonstrated\npreviously for achromatic focussing. We back up our experiments with\ntheoretical simulations reproducing the experimental HHG results depending on\ndiverse parameters (input pulse spectral phase, pulse duration, focus position)\nand proving that, under the considered parameters, the attosecond pulse train\nremains very similar to the achromatic case, even showing cases of isolated\nattosecond pulse generation for near single-cycle driving pulses.\n", "  Using non-linear evolution equations of QCD, we compute the von Neumann\nentropy of the system of partons resolved by deep inelastic scattering at a\ngiven Bjorken $x$ and momentum transfer $q^2 = - Q^2$. We interpret the result\nas the entropy of entanglement between the spatial region probed by deep\ninelastic scattering and the rest of the proton. At small $x$ the relation\nbetween the entanglement entropy $S(x)$ and the parton distribution $xG(x)$\nbecomes very simple: $S(x) = \\ln[ xG(x) ]$. In this small $x$, large rapidity\n$Y$ regime, all partonic micro-states have equal probabilities -- the proton is\ncomposed by an exponentially large number $\\exp(\\Delta Y)$ of micro-states that\noccur with equal and exponentially small probabilities $\\exp(-\\Delta Y)$, where\n$\\Delta$ is defined by $xG(x) \\sim 1/x^\\Delta$. For this equipartitioned state,\nthe entanglement entropy is maximal -- so at small $x$, deep inelastic\nscattering probes a {\\it maximally entangled state}. We propose the\nentanglement entropy as an observable that can be studied in deep inelastic\nscattering. This will require event-by-event measurements of hadronic final\nstates, and would allow to study the transformation of entanglement entropy\ninto the Boltzmann one. We estimate that the proton is represented by the\nmaximally entangled state at $x \\leq 10^{-3}$; this kinematic region will be\namenable to studies at the Electron Ion Collider.\n", "  We introduce a new proposal for the onset of cosmic acceleration based on\nmass-varying neutrinos. When massive neutrinos become nonrelativistic, the\n$Z_2$ symmetry breaks, and the quintessence potential becomes positive from its\ninitially zero value. This positive potential behaves like a cosmological\nconstant at the present era and drives the Universe's acceleration during the\nslow roll evolution of the quintessence. In contrast to $\\Lambda$CDM model, the\ndark energy in our model is dynamical, and the acceleration is not persistent.\nContrary to some of the previous models of dark energy with mass-varying\nneutrinos, we do not use the adiabaticity condition which leads to instability.\n", "  Observations indicate that stars generally lose their protoplanetary discs on\na timescale of about 5 Myr. Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet\nformation in dense environments.\n", "  We study the dynamics of screening in photo-doped Mott insulators with\nlong-ranged interactions using a nonequilibrium implementation of the $GW$ plus\nextended dynamical mean field theory ($GW$+EDMFT) formalism. Our study\ndemonstrates that the complex interplay of the injected carriers with bosonic\ndegrees of freedom (charge fluctuations) can result in long-lived transient\nstates with properties that are distinctly different from those of thermal\nequilibrium states. Systems with strong nonlocal interactions are found to\nexhibit a self-sustained population inversion of the doublons and holes. This\npopulation inversion leads to low-energy antiscreening which can be detected in\ntime-resolved electron-energy loss spectra.\n", "  This paper is the first in a series of papers describing the impact of\nantenna instrumental artefacts on the 21-cm cosmology experiments to be carried\nout by the low frequency instrument (SKA1-LOW) of the Square Kilometre Array\ntelescope (SKA), i.e., the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization\n(EoR). The smoothness of the passband response of the current log-periodic\nantenna being developed for the SKA1-LOW is analyzed using numerical\nelectromagnetic simulations. The amplitude variations over the frequency range\nare characterized using low-order polynomials defined locally, in order to\nstudy the impact of the passband smoothness in the instrument calibration and\nCD/EoR Science. A solution is offered to correct a fast ripple found at 60~MHz\nduring a test campaign at the SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy\nObservatory, Western Australia in September 2015 with a minor impact on the\ntelescope's performance and design. A comparison with the Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array antenna is also shown demonstrating the potential use of the\nSKA1-LOW antenna for the Delay Spectrum technique to detect the EoR.\n", "  The observed deep inelastic nucleon spin asymmetries $A_{1}^{p,n}$ and the\nspin dependent quark distributions break SU(6) spin - flavour symmetry. In\nquark models two mechanisms for breaking SU(6) symmetry are well known: the\nhyperfine interaction and the pion cloud of the nucleon. I re-evaluate these\nmechanisms and show how the breaking of SU(6) in each case affects spin\ndependent valence quark distributions of the proton. In particular I\ninvestigate the properties of these mechanisms in the kinematic region $0.3 < x\n< 0.7$ and attempt to test these against known data. Both mechanisms are able\nto explain the quantitative features of the spin asymmetries.\n", "  We report a study of the quantum Hall states (QHSs) sequence of holes in\nmono- and bilayer WSe$_2$. The QHSs sequence transitions between predominantly\neven and predominantly odd filling factors as the hole density is tuned in the\nrange $1.6 - 12\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. The QHSs sequence is insensitive to\nthe transverse electric field, and tilted magnetic field measurements reveal an\ninsensitivity of the QHSs sequence to the in-plane magnetic field, evincing\nthat the hole spin is locked perpendicular to the WSe$_2$ plane. These\nobservations imply that the QHSs sequence is controlled by the\nZeeman-to-cyclotron energy ratio, which remains constant as a function of\nperpendicular magnetic field at a fixed carrier density, but changes as a\nfunction of density due to strong electron-electron interaction.\n", "  Halide perovskite (HaP) semiconductors are revolutionizing photovoltaic (PV)\nsolar energy conversion by showing remarkable performance of solar cells made\nwith esp. tetragonal methylammonium lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3). In particular,\nthe low voltage loss of these cells implies a remarkably low recombination rate\nof photogenerated carriers. It was suggested that low recombination can be due\nto spatial separation of electrons and holes, a possibility if MAPbI3 is a\nsemiconducting ferroelectric, which, however, requires clear experimental\nevidence. As a first step we show that, in operando, MAPbI3 (unlike MAPbBr3) is\npyroelectric, which implies it can be ferroelectric. The next step, proving it\nis (not) ferroelectric, is challenging, because of the material s relatively\nhigh electrical conductance (a consequence of an optical band gap suitable for\nPV conversion!) and low stability under high applied bias voltage. This\nexcludes normal measurements of a ferroelectric hysteresis loop to prove\nferroelctricity s hallmark for switchable polarization. By adopting an approach\nsuitable for electrically leaky materials as MAPbI3, we show here ferroelectric\nhysteresis from well-characterized single crystals at low temperature (still\nwithin the tetragonal phase, which is the room temperature stable phase). Using\nchemical etching, we also image polar domains, the structural fingerprint for\nferroelectricity, periodically stacked along the polar axis of the crystal,\nwhich, as predicted by theory, scale with the overall crystal size. We also\nsucceeded in detecting clear second-harmonic generation, direct evidence for\nthe material s non-centrosymmetry. We note that the material s ferroelectric\nnature, can, but not obviously need to be important in a PV cell, operating\naround room temperature.\n", "  Spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the environments of explosive transients\ncarries detailed information about the physical properties of the stellar\npopulation that gave rise to the explosion, and thus the progenitor itself.\nHere, we present new observations of ESO184-G82, the galaxy hosting the\narchetype of the $\\gamma$-ray burst/supernova connection, GRB 980425/SN 1998bw,\nobtained with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE mounted at the Very Large\nTelescope. These observations have yielded detailed maps of emission-line\nstrength for various nebular lines, as well as physical parameters such as dust\nextinction, stellar age, and oxygen abundance on spatial scales of 160 pc. The\nimmediate environment of GRB 980425 is young (5-8 Myr) and consistent with a\nmildly-extinguished ($A_V\\sim0.1\\ \\mathrm{mag}$) progenitor of zero-age\nmain-sequence mass between 25 $M_{\\odot}$ and 40 $M_{\\odot}$ and oxygen\nabundance 12+log(O/H)~8.2 ($Z\\sim0.3\\ {Z}_\\odot$), which is slightly lower than\nthe one of an integrated measurement of the galaxy (12+log(O/H)~8.3) and a\nprominent nearby HII region (12+log(O/H)~8.4). This region is significantly\nyounger than the explosion site, and we argue that a scenario in which the GRB\nprogenitor formed in this environment and was subsequently ejected appears very\nunlikely. We show that empirical strong-line methods based on [OIII] and/or\n[NII] are inadequate to produce accurate maps of oxygen abundance at the level\nof detail of our MUSE observation as these methods strongly depend on the\nionization state of the gas. The metallicity gradient in ESO184-G82 is -0.06\ndex kpc$^{-1}$, indicating that the typical offsets of at most few kpc for\ncosmological GRBs on average have a small impact on oxygen abundance\nmeasurements at higher redshift.\n", "  We analyzed the Suzaku data of M86 and its adjacent regions to study the\nextended emission around it. The M86 core, the plume, and the tail extending\ntoward the northwest were clearly detected, as well as the extended halo around\nthem. From the position angle $\\sim45\\deg$ to $\\sim275\\deg$, the surface\nbrightness distribution of the core and the extended halo was represented\nrelatively well with a single $\\beta$-model of $\\beta\\sim0.5$ up to 15'-20'.\nThe X-ray spectra of the core was represented with a two-temperature model of\n$kT\\sim 0.9$ keV and $\\sim0.6$ keV. The temperatures of the core and the halo\nhave a positive gradient in the center, and reach the maximum of $kT\\sim1.0$\nkeV at $r\\sim7'$, indicating that the halo gas is located in a larger scale\npotential structure than that of the galaxy. The temperatures of the plume and\nthe tail were $0.86\\pm0.01$ keV and $1.00\\pm0.01$ keV. We succeeded in\ndetermining the abundances of $\\alpha$-element separately, for the core, the\nplume, the tail, and the halo for the first time. Abundance ratios with respect\nto Fe were consistent with the solar ratios everywhere, except for Ne. The\nabundance of Fe was $\\sim0.7$ in the core and in the plume, while that in the\ntail was $\\sim1.0$, but the difference was not significant considering the\nuncertainties of the ICM. The abundance of the halo was almost the same up to\n$r\\sim10'$, and then it becomes significantly smaller (0.2-0.3) at\n$r\\gtrsim10'$, indicating the gas with low metal abundance still remains in the\nouter halo. From the surface brightness distribution, we estimated the gas mass\n($\\sim3\\times10^{10}M_\\odot$) and the dynamical mass\n($\\sim3\\times10^{12}M_\\odot$) in $r<100$~kpc. The gas mass to the dynamical\nmass ratio was $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$, suggesting a significant fraction of the\nhalo gas has been stripped.\n", "  Misaligned AGN (MAGNs), i.e., radio-loud AGNs with the jet not pointing\ndirectly towards us, represent a new class of GeV emitters revealed by the\nFermi space telescope. Although they comprise only a small fraction of the\nhigh-energy sources, MAGNs are extremely interesting objects offering a\ndifferent perspective to study high-energy processes with respect to blazars.\nThe aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of the new-generation Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA) on the MAGN class and propose possible observational\nstrategies to optimize their detection.\n", "  Penumbral Microjets (PMJs) are short-lived jets found in the penumbra of\nsunspots, first observed in wide-band Ca H-line observations as localized\nbrightenings, and are thought to be caused by magnetic reconnection. Earlier\nwork on PMJs has been focused on smaller samples of by-eye selected events and\ncase studies. It is our goal to present an automated study of a large sample of\nPMJs to place the basic statistics of PMJs on a sure footing and to study the\nPMJ Ca II 8542 Angstrom spectral profile in detail. High spatial resolution and\nspectrally well-sampled observations in the Ca II 8542 Angstrom line obtained\nfrom the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) are reduced by a Principle Component\nAnalysis and subsequently used in the automated detection of PMJs using the\nsimple learning algorithm k-Nearest Neighbour. PMJ detections were verified\nwith co-temporal Ca H-line observations. A total of 453 tracked PMJ events were\nfound, or 4253 PMJs detections tallied over all timeframes and a detection rate\nof 21 events per timestep. From these, an average length, width and lifetime of\n640 km, 210 km and 90 s were obtained. The average PMJ Ca II 8542 Angstrom line\nprofile is characterized by enhanced inner wings, often in the form of one or\ntwo distinct peaks, and a brighter line core as compared to the quiet Sun\naverage. Average blue and red peak positions were determined at -10.4 km/s and\n+10.2 km/s offsets from the Ca II 8542 Angstrom line core. We found several\nclusters of PMJ hotspots within the sunspot penumbra, where PMJ events occur in\nthe same general area repeatedly over time. Our results indicate smaller\naverage PMJs sizes and longer lifetimes compared to previously published\nvalues, but with statistics still in the same orders of magnitude. The\ninvestigation and analysis of the PMJ line profiles strengthen the proposed\nheating of PMJs to transition region temperatures.\n", "  The trace anomaly in six-dimensional space is given by the local terms which\nhave six derivatives of the metric. We find the effective action which is\nresponsible for the anomaly. The result is presented in non-local covariant\nform and also in the local covariant form which employs two auxiliary scalar\nfields.\n", "  We present a library of empirical stellar spectra created using spectra from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).\nThe templates cover spectral types O5 through L3, are binned by metallicity\nfrom -2.0 dex through +1.0 dex and are separated into main sequence (dwarf)\nstars and giant stars. With recently developed M dwarf metallicity indicators,\nwe are able to extend the metallicity bins down through the spectral subtype\nM8, making this the first empirical library with this degree of temperature\n\\emph{and} metallicity coverage. The wavelength coverage for the templates is\nfrom 3650 Angstroms through 10200 Angstroms at a resolution better than R~2000.\nUsing the templates, we identify trends in color space with metallicity and\nsurface gravity, which will be useful for analyzing large data sets from\nupcoming missions like LSST. Along with the templates, we are releasing a code\nfor automatically (and/or visually) identifying the spectral type and\nmetallicity of a star.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) on\nmagnetic domain nucleation in a ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy. We propose an extended droplet model to determine the\nnucleation field as a function of the in-plane field. The model can explain the\nexperimentally observed nucleation in a CoNi microstrip with the interfacial\nDMI. The results are also reproduced by micromagnetic simulation based on the\nstring model. The electrical measurement method proposed in this study can be\nwidely used to quantitatively determine the DMI energy density.\n", "  We analyze the correlation between starspots and superflares on solar-type\nstars using observations from the Kepler mission. The analysis shows that the\nobserved fraction of stars with superflares decreases as the rotation period\nincreases and as the amplitude of photometric variability associated with\nrotation decreases. We found that the fraction of stars with superflares among\nthe stars showing large-amplitude rotational variations, which are thought to\nbe the signature of the large starspots, also decreases as the rotation period\nincreases. The small fraction of superflare stars among the stars with large\nstarspots in the longer-period regime suggests that some of the stars with\nlarge starspots show a much lower flare activity than the superflare stars with\nthe same spot area. Assuming simple relations between spot area and lifetime\nand between spot temperature and photospheric temperature, we compared the size\ndistribution of large starspot groups on slowly-rotating solar-type stars with\nthat of sunspot groups. The size distribution of starspots shows the power-law\ndistribution and the size distribution of larger sunspots lies on this\npower-law line. We also found that frequency-energy distributions for flares\noriginating from spots with different sizes are the same for solar-type stars\nwith superflares and the Sun. These results suggest that the magnetic activity\nwe observe on solar-type stars with superflares and that on the Sun is caused\nby the same physical processes.\n", "  The weak magnetism correction and its uncertainty to nuclear beta-decay play\na major role in determining the significance of the reactor neutrino anomaly.\nHere we examine the common approximation used for one-body weak magnetism in\nthe calculation of fission antineutrino spectra, wherein matrix elements of the\norbital angular momentum operator contribution to the magnetic dipole current\nare assumed to be proportional to those of the spin operator. Although we find\nthis approximation invalid for a large set of nuclear structure situations, we\nconclude that it is valid for the relevant allowed beta-decays between fission\nfragments. In particular, the uncertainty in the fission antineutrino due to\nthe uncertainty in the one-body weak magnetism correction is found to be less\nthan 1%. Thus, the dominant uncertainty from weak magnetism for reactor\nneutrino fluxes lies in the uncertainty in the two-body meson-exchange magnetic\ndipole current.\n", "  We determine the radio size distribution of a large sample of 152 SMGs in\nCOSMOS that were detected with ALMA at 1.3 mm. For this purpose, we used the\nobservations taken by the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project. One hundred and\nfifteen of the 152 target SMGs were found to have a 3 GHz counterpart. The\nmedian value of the major axis FWHM at 3 GHz is derived to be $4.6\\pm0.4$ kpc.\nThe radio sizes show no evolutionary trend with redshift, or difference between\ndifferent galaxy morphologies. We also derived the spectral indices between 1.4\nand 3 GHz, and 3 GHz brightness temperatures for the sources, and the median\nvalues were found to be $\\alpha=-0.67$ and $T_{\\rm B}=12.6\\pm2$ K. Three of the\ntarget SMGs, which are also detected with the VLBA, show clearly higher\nbrightness temperatures than the typical values. Although the observed radio\nemission appears to be predominantly powered by star formation and supernova\nactivity, our results provide a strong indication of the presence of an AGN in\nthe VLBA and X-ray-detected SMG AzTEC/C61. The median radio-emitting size we\nhave derived is 1.5-3 times larger than the typical FIR dust-emitting sizes of\nSMGs, but similar to that of the SMGs' molecular gas component traced through\nmid-$J$ line emission of CO. The physical conditions of SMGs probably render\nthe diffusion of cosmic-ray electrons inefficient, and hence an unlikely\nprocess to lead to the observed extended radio sizes. Instead, our results\npoint towards a scenario where SMGs are driven by galaxy interactions and\nmergers. Besides triggering vigorous starbursts, galaxy collisions can also\npull out the magnetised fluids from the interacting disks, and give rise to a\ntaffy-like synchrotron-emitting bridge. This provides an explanation for the\nspatially extended radio emission of SMGs, and can also cause a deviation from\nthe well-known IR-radio correlation.\n", "  We present a model to account for the observed debris disks around young\nwhite dwarfs and the presence of metal-lines in their spectra. Stellar\nevolution models predict that the mass-loss on the AGB will be pulsed;\nfurthermore, observations indicate that the bulk of the mass-loss occurs on the\nAGB. In this case, if the progenitors of the white dwarfs had remnants of\nplanetary formation like the Sun's Oort cloud or the Kuiper Belt and a planet\nlying within that cloud or nearby, we find that up to 2% of the planetesimals\nwill fall either into planet-crossing orbits or into chaotic regions after the\nmass-loss, depending on the location and mass of the planet (from Mars to\nNeptune). This yields a sufficient mass of comets that can be scattered toward\nthe star, form a debris disk and pollute the atmosphere.\n", "  We assume that stars may undergo surface differential rotation to study its\nimpact on the interpretation of $V\\!\\sin i$ and on the observed distribution\n$\\Phi(u)$ of ratios of true rotational velocities $u=V/V_\\rm c$ ($V_\\rm c$ is\nthe equatorial critical velocity). We discuss some phenomena affecting the\nformation of spectral lines and their broadening, which can obliterate the\ninformation carried by $V\\!\\sin i$ concerning the actual stellar rotation. We\nstudied the line broadening produced by several differential rotational laws,\nbut adopted Maunder's expression\n$\\Omega(\\theta)=\\Omega_o(1+\\alpha\\cos^2\\theta)$ as an attempt to account for\nall of these laws with the lowest possible number of free parameters. We\nstudied the effect of the differential rotation parameter $\\alpha$ on the\nmeasured $V\\!\\sin i$ parameter and on the distribution $\\Phi(u)$ of ratios\n$u=V/V_\\rm c$. We conclude that the inferred $V\\!\\sin i$ is smaller than\nimplied by the actual equatorial linear rotation velocity $V_\\rm eq$ if the\nstars rotate with $\\alpha<0$, but is larger if the stars have $\\alpha>0$. For a\ngiven $|\\alpha|$ the deviations of $V\\!\\sin i$ are larger when $\\alpha<0$. If\nthe studied Be stars have on average $\\alpha<0$, the number of rotators with\n$V_\\rm eq\\simeq0.9V_\\rm c$ is larger than expected from the observed\ndistribution $\\Phi(u)$; if these stars have on average $\\alpha>0$, this number\nis lower than expected. We discuss seven phenomena that contribute either to\nnarrow or broaden spectral lines, which blur the information on the rotation\ncarried by $V\\!\\sin i$ and, in particular, to decide whether the Be phenomenon\nmostly rely on the critical rotation. We show that two-dimensional radiation\ntransfer calculations are needed in rapid rotators to diagnose the stellar\nrotation more reliably.\n", "  The donor in the microquasar GRS 1915+105 is a low-mass giant. Such a star\nconsists of a degenerate helium core and a hydrogen-rich envelope. Both\ncomponents are separated by a hydrogen burning shell. The structure of such an\nobject is relatively simple and easy to model. Making use of the observational\nconstraints on the luminosity and the radius of the donor, we constrain the\nmass of this star with evolutionary models. We find a very good agreement\nbetween the constraints from those models and from the observed rotational\nbroadening and the NIR magnitude. Combining the constraints, we find solutions\nwith stripped giants of the mass of $\\geq\\!0.28{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and of the\nspectral class K5 III, independent of the distance to the system, and a\ndistance-dependent upper limit, $\\lesssim\\!1{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We also calculate\nthe average mass transfer rate and the duty cycle of the system as a function\nof the donor mass. This rate is much below the critical rate (at which the\nsystem would become persistent), and the duty cycle is less than 20 per cent.\n", "  We have developed a fully coupled-channel complex scaling method (ccCSM) for\nthe study of the most essential kaonic nucleus, $``K^-pp,\"$ which is a resonant\nstate of a $\\bar{K}NN$-$\\pi\\Sigma N$-$\\pi\\Lambda N$ coupled-channel system\nbased on a theoretical viewpoint. By employing the ccCSM and imposing the\ncorrect boundary condition of resonance, the coupled-channel problem is\ncompletely solved using a phenomenological energy-independent potential. As a\nresult of the ccCSM calculation of $``K^-pp,\"$ in which all three channels are\ntreated explicitly, we have obtained three-body resonance as a Gamow state. The\nresonance pole indicates that the binding energy of $``K^-pp\"$ and the half\nvalue of its mesonic decay width are 51 MeV and 16 MeV, respectively. In the\nanalysis of the resonant wave function obtained using the ccCSM, we clarify the\nspatial configuration and channel compositions of $``K^-pp.\"$ Compared with\npast studies of single-channel calculations based on effective $\\bar{K}N$\npotentials, the current study provides a guideline for the determination of the\n$\\bar{K}N$ energy to be used in effective potentials.\n", "  Anyon condensation forms a mechanism which allows to relate different\ntopological phases. We study anyon condensation in the framework of Projected\nEntangled Pair States (PEPS) where topological order is characterized through\nlocal symmetries of the entanglement. We show that anyon condensation is in\none-to-one correspondence to the behavior of the virtual entanglement state at\nthe boundary (i.e., the entanglement spectrum) under those symmetries, which\nencompasses both symmetry breaking and symmetry protected (SPT) order, and we\nuse this to characterize all anyon condensations for abelian double models\nthrough the structure of their entanglement spectrum. We illustrate our\nfindings with the Z4 double model, which can give rise to both Toric Code and\nDoubled Semion order through condensation, distinguished by the SPT structure\nof their entanglement. Using the ability of our framework to directly measure\norder parameters for condensation and deconfinement, we numerically study the\nphase diagram of the model, including direct phase transitions between the\nDoubled Semion and the Toric Code phase which are not described by anyon\ncondensation.\n", "  The formation of compact stellar-mass binaries is a difficult, but\ninteresting problem in astrophysics. There are two main formation channels: In\nthe field via binary star evolution, or in dense stellar systems via dynamical\ninteractions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)\nhas detected black hole binaries (BHBs) via their gravitational radiation.\nThese detections provide us with information about the physical parameters of\nthe system. It has been claimed that when the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) is operating, the joint observation of these binaries with LIGO\nwill allow us to derive the channels that lead to their formation. However, we\nshow that for BHBs in dense stellar systems dynamical interactions could lead\nto high eccentricities such that a fraction of the relativistic mergers are not\naudible to LISA. A non-detection by LISA puts a lower limit of about $0.005$ on\nthe eccentricity of a BHB entering the LIGO band. On the other hand, a\ndeci-Hertz observatory, like DECIGO or Tian Qin, would significantly enhance\nthe chances of a joint detection, and shed light on the formation channels of\nthese binaries.\n", "  Using resonant soft X-ray techniques we follow the magnetic behavior of a\nstrained epitaxial film of CoCr2O4, a type-II multiferroic. The film is\n[110]-oriented, such that both the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic moments can\ncoexist in plane. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) is used in\nscattering and in transmission modes to probe the magnetization of Co and Cr\nseparately. The transmission measurements utilized X-ray excited optical\nluminescence from the substrate. Resonant soft X-ray diffraction (RSXD) was\nused to study the magnetic order of the low temperature phase. The XMCD signals\nof Co and Cr appear at the same ordering temperature Tc~90K, and are always\nopposite in sign. The coercive field of the Co and of Cr moments is the same,\nand is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than in bulk. Through sum\nrules analysis an enlarged Co2+ orbital moment (m_L) is found, which can\nexplain this hardening. The RSXD signal of the (q q 0) reflection appears below\nTs, the same ordering temperature as the conical magnetic structure in bulk,\nindicating that this phase remains multiferroic under strain. To describe the\nazimuthal dependence of this reflection, a slight modification is required to\nthe spin model proposed by the conventional Lyons-Kaplan-Dwight-Menyuk theory\nfor magnetic spinels. Lastly, a slight increase in reflected intensity is\nobserved below Ts=27K when measuring at the Cr edge (but not at the Co edge).\n", "  Recent ARPES measurements of single-layer 1H-TaS2 grown on Au(111) suggest\nstrong electron doping from the substrate. In addition, STM/STS measurements on\nthis system show suppression of the charge-density-wave (CDW) instability that\noccurs in bulk 2H-TaS2. We present results from ab initio DFT calculations of\nfree-standing single-layer 1H-TaS2 to explore the effects of doping on the CDW.\nIn the harmonic approximation, we find that a lattice instability along the\nGamma-M line occurs in the undoped monolayer, consistent with the bulk 3x3 CDW\nordering vector. Doping removes the CDW instability, in agreement with the\nexperimental findings. The doping and momentum dependence of both the\nelectron-phonon coupling and of the bare phonon energy (unscreened by metallic\nelectrons) determine the stability of lattice vibrations. Electron doping also\ncauses an expansion of the lattice, so strain is a secondary but also relevant\neffect.\n", "  We present the result of an unbiased CO survey in Galactic range of\n34.75$^{\\circ}\\leq$l$\\leq$ 45.25$^{\\circ}$ and -5.25$^{\\circ}\\leq$b$\\leq$\n5.25$^{\\circ}$, and velocity range beyond the Outer arm. A total of 168\nmolecular clouds (MCs) are identified within the Extreme Outer Galaxy~(EOG)\nregion, and 31 of these MCs are associated with 13CO emission. However, none of\nthem show significant C18O emission under current detection limit. The typical\nsize and mass of these MCs are 5~pc and 3$\\times$10$^{3}M_{\\sun}$, implying the\nlack of large and massive MCs in the EOG region. Similar to MCs in the outer\nGalaxy, the velocity dispersions of EOG clouds are also correlated with their\nsizes, however, are well displaced below the scaling relationship defined by\nthe inner Galaxy MCs. These MCs with a median Galactocentric radius of 12.6\nkpc, show very different distributions from those of the MCs in the Outer arm\npublished in our previous paper, while roughly follow the Outer\nScutum-Centaurus arm defined by Dame & Thaddeus 2011. This result may provide a\nrobust evidence for the existence of the Outer Scutum-Centaurus arm. The lower\nlimit of the total mass of this segment is about 2.7$\\times$10$^5$ $M_{\\sun}$,\nwhich is about one magnitude lower than that of the Outer arm. The mean\nthickness of gaseous disk is about 1.45$^{\\circ}$ or 450~pc, and the scale\nheight is about 1.27$^{\\circ}$ or 400~pc above the $b=0^{\\circ}$ plane. The\nwarp traced by CO emission is very obvious in the EOG region and its amplitude\nis consistent with the predictions by other warp models using different\ntracers, such as dust, HI and stellar components of our Galaxy.\n", "  We observed the 2016 outburst of OT J002656.6+284933\n(CSS101212:002657+284933) and found that it has the longest recorded\n[0.13225(1) d in average] superhumps among SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The object\nis the third known SU UMa-type dwarf nova above the period gap. The outburst,\nhowever, was unlike ordinary long-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae in that it\nshowed two post-outburst rebrightenings. It showed superhump evolution similar\nto short-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. We could constrain the mass ratio to\nless than 0.15 (most likely between 0.10 and 0.15) by using superhump periods\nin the early and post-superoutburst stages. These results suggest the\npossibility that OT J002656.6+284933 has an anomalously undermassive secondary\nand it should have passed a different evolutionary track from the standard one.\n", "  The spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with regularly alternating monomeric\nand square-plaquette sites is investigated using various analytical and\nnumerical methods: variational technique, localized-magnon approach, exact\ndiagonalization (ED) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.\nThe model belongs to the class of flat-band systems and it has a rich\nground-state phase diagram including phases with spontaneously broken\ntranslational symmetry. Moreover, it exhibits an anomalous low-temperature\nthermodynamics close to continuous or discontinuous field-driven quantum phase\ntransitions between three quantum ferrimagnetic phases, tetramer-hexamer phase,\nmonomer-tetramer phase, localized-magnon phase and two different spin-liquid\nphases. If the intra-plaquette coupling is at least twice as strong as the\nmonomer-plaquette coupling, the variational method furnishes a rigorous proof\nof the monomer-tetramer ground state in a low-field region and the\nlocalized-magnon approach provides an exact evidence of a single magnon trapped\nat each square plaquette in a high-field region. In the rest of parameter space\nwe have numerically studied the ground-state phase diagram and magnetization\nprocess using DMRG and ED methods. It is shown that the zero-temperature\nmagnetization curve may involve up to four intermediate plateaus at zero,\none-fifth, two-fifth and three-fifth of the saturation magnetization, while the\nspecific heat exhibits a striking low-temperature peak in a vicinity of\ndiscontinuous quantum phase transitions.\n", "  We conducted a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument observational\ncharacterisation of the candidate free-floating planet\nCFBDSIR~J214947.2-040308.9, a late T-dwarf with possible low-gravity features,\nin order to constrain its physical properties. We analyzed 9 hours of X-Shooter\nspectroscopy with signal detectable from 0.8--2.3$\\mu$m, as well as additional\nphotometry in the mid-infrared using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combined with\na VLT/HAWK-I astrometric parallax, this enabled a full characterisation of the\nabsolute flux from the visible to 5$\\mu$m, encompassing more than 90\\% of the\nexpected energy emitted by such a cool late T-type object. Our analysis of the\nspectrum also provided the radial velocity and therefore the determination of\nits full 3-D kinematics. While our new spectrum confirms the low gravity and/or\nhigh metallicity of CFBDSIR2149, the parallax and kinematics safely rule out\nmembership to any known young moving group, including AB~Doradus. We use the\nequivalent width of the KI doublet at 1.25$\\mu$m as a promising tool to\ndiscriminate the effects of low-gravity from the effects of high-metallicity on\nthe emission spectra of cool atmospheres. In the case of CFBDSIR2149, the\nobserved KI doublet clearly favours the low-gravity solution. CFBDSIR2149 is\ntherefore a peculiar late-T dwarf that is probably a young, planetary-mass\nobject (2--13Mjup, $<$500Myr) possibly similar to the exoplanet 51Erib, or\nperhaps a 2--40Mjup brown dwarf with super-solar metallicity.\n", "  Understanding of massive cluster formation is one of the important issues of\nastronomy. By analyzing the HI data, we have identified that the two HI\nvelocity components (L- and D-components) are colliding toward the HI Ridge, in\nthe southeastern end of the LMC, which hosts the young massive cluster R136 and\n$\\sim$400 O/WR stars (Doran et al. 2013) including the progenitor of SN1987A.\nThe collision is possibly evidenced by bridge features connecting the two HI\ncomponents and complementary distributions between them. We frame a hypothesis\nthat the collision triggered the formation of R136 and the surrounding\nhigh-mass stars as well as the HI & Molecular Ridge. Fujimoto & Noguchi (1990)\nadvocated that the last tidal interaction between the LMC and the SMC about 0.2\nGyr ago induced collision of the L- and D-components. This model is consistent\nwith numerical simulations (Bekki & Chiba 2007b). We suggest that a dense HI\npartly CO cloud of 10$^{6}$ $M_{\\odot}$, a precursor of R136, was formed at the\nshock-compressed interface between the colliding L- and D-components. We\nsuggest that part of the low-metalicity gas from the SMC was mixed in the tidal\ninteraction based on the $Planck/IRAS$ data of dust optical depth (Planck\nCollaboration et al. 2014).\n", "  Deep-inelastic scattering, in the laboratory and on the lattice, is most\ninstructive for understanding how the nucleon is built from quarks and gluons.\nThe long-term goal is to compute the associated structure functions from first\nprinciples. So far this has been limited to model calculations. In this Letter\nwe propose a new method to compute the structure functions directly from the\nvirtual, all-encompassing Compton amplitude, utilizing the operator product\nexpansion. This overcomes issues of renormalization and operator mixing, which\nso far have hindered lattice calculations of power corrections and higher\nmoments.\n", "  Simplicial complexes describe collaboration networks, protein interaction\nnetworks and brain networks and in general network structures in which the\ninteractions can include more than two nodes. In real applications, often\nsimplicial complexes are weighted. Here we propose a non-equilibrium model for\nweighted growing simplicial complexes. The proposed dynamics is able to\ngenerate weighted simplicial complexes with a rich interplay between weights\nand topology emerging not just at the level of nodes and links, but also at the\nlevel of faces of higher dimension.\n", "  High-mass stars are expected to form from dense prestellar cores. Their\nprecise formation conditions are widely discussed, including their virial\ncondition, which results in slow collapse for super-virial cores with strong\nsupport by turbulence or magnetic fields, or fast collapse for sub-virial\nsources. To disentangle their formation processes, measurements of the\ndeuterium fractions are frequently employed to approximately estimate the ages\nof these cores and to obtain constraints on their dynamical evolution. We here\npresent 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including for the first time an\naccurate non-equilibrium chemical network with 21 gas-phase species plus dust\ngrains and 213 reactions. With this network we model the deuteration process in\nfully depleted prestellar cores in great detail and determine its response to\nvariations in the initial conditions. We explore the dependence on the initial\ngas column density, the turbulent Mach number, the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio\nand the distribution of the magnetic field, as well as the initial\northo-to-para ratio of H2. We find excellent agreement with recent observations\nof deuterium fractions in quiescent sources. Our results show that deuteration\nis rather efficient, even when assuming a conservative ortho-to-para ratio of 3\nand highly sub-virial initial conditions, leading to large deuterium fractions\nalready within roughly a free-fall time. We discuss the implications of our\nresults and give an outlook to relevant future investigations.\n", "  In all-oxide ferroelectric (FE) - superconductor (S) bilayers, due to the low\ncarrier concentration of oxides compared to transition metals, the FE\ninterfacial polarization charges induce an accumulation (or depletion) of\ncharge carriers in the S. This leads either to an enhancement or a depression\nof its critical temperature depending on FE polarization direction.Here we\nexploit this effect at a local scale to define planar weak-links in\nhigh-temperature superconducting wires. This is realized in\nBiFeO3(FE)/YBa2Cu3O7(S)bilayers in which the remnant FE domain structure is\nwritten at will by locally applying voltage pulses with a conductive-tip atomic\nforce microscope. In this fashion, the FE domain pattern defines a spatial\nmodulation of superconductivity. This allows us to write a device whose\nelectrical transport shows different temperature regimes and magnetic field\nmatching effects that are characteristic of Josephson coupled weak-links. This\nillustrates the potential of the ferroelectric approach for the realization of\nhigh-temperature superconducting devices.\n", "  We report the discovery by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF)\nof a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF16axa at $z=0.108$, and present\nits broadband photometric and spectroscopic evolution from 3 months of\nfollow-up observations with ground-based telescopes and Swift. The light curve\nis well fitted with a $t^{-5/3}$ decay, and we constrain the rise-time to peak\nto be $<$49 rest-frame days after disruption, which is roughly consistent with\nthe fallback timescale expected for the $\\sim 5\\times$10$^{6}$ $M_\\odot$ black\nhole inferred from the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. The UV\nand optical spectral energy distribution (SED) is well described by a constant\nblackbody temperature of T$\\sim$ 3$\\times$10$^4$ K over the monitoring period,\nwith an observed peak luminosity of 1.1$\\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The\noptical spectra are characterized by a strong blue continuum and broad HeII and\nH$\\alpha$ lines characteristic of TDEs. We compare the photometric and\nspectroscopic signatures of iPTF16axa with 11 TDE candidates in the literature\nwith well-sampled optical light curves. Based on a single-temperature fit to\nthe optical and near-UV photometry, most of these TDE candidates have peak\nluminosities confined between log(L [erg s$^{-1}$]) = 43.4-44.4, with constant\ntemperatures of a few $\\times 10^{4}$ K during their power-law declines,\nimplying blackbody radii on the order of ten times the tidal disruption radius,\nthat decrease monotonically with time. For TDE candidates with hydrogen and\nhelium emission, the high helium-to-hydrogen ratios suggest that the emission\narises from high-density gas, where nebular arguments break down. We find no\ncorrelation between the peak luminosity and the black hole mass, contrary to\nthe expectations for TDEs to have $\\dot{M} \\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{-1/2}$.\n", "  Topological semimetals are characterized by protected crossings between\nconduction and valence bands. These materials have recently attracted\nsignificant interest because of the deep connections to high-energy physics,\nthe novel topological surface states, and the unusual transport phenomena.\nWhile Dirac and Weyl semimetals have been extensively studied, the nodal-line\nsemimetal remains largely unexplored due to the lack of an ideal material\nplatform. In this paper, we report the magneto-transport properties of two\nnodal-line semimetal candidates CaAgAs and CaCdGe. First, our single\ncrystalline CaAgAs supports the first \"hydrogen atom\" nodal-line semimetal,\nwhere only the topological nodal-line is present at the Fermi level. Second,\nour CaCdGe sample provides an ideal platform to perform comparative studies\nbecause it features the same topological nodal line but has a more complicated\nFermiology with irrelevant Fermi pockets. As a result, the magnetoresistance of\nour CaCdGe sample is more than 100 times larger than that of CaAgAs. Through\nour systematic magneto-transport and first-principles band structure\ncalculations, we show that our CaTX compounds can be used to study, isolate,\nand control the novel topological nodal-line physics in real materials.\n", "  Fully-coherent all-sky search for gravitational wave (GW) signals from the\ncoalescence of compact object binaries is a computationally expensive task.\nApproximations, such as semi-coherent coincidence searches, are currently used\nto circumvent the computational barrier with a concomitant loss in sensitivity.\nWe explore the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in addressing\nthis problem. Our results, using a simulated network of detectors with initial\nLIGO design sensitivities and a realistic signal strength, show that PSO can\nsuccessfully deliver a fully-coherent all-sky search with < 1/10 the number of\nlikelihood evaluations needed for a grid-based search.\n", "  We utilize a light-front relativistic quark model to predict the 3q core\ncontribution to the electroexcitation of nucleon resonances of the [70,1-]\nmultiplet on the proton and neutron at Q2 < 5GeV2. The investigation is\nstimulated in large degree by expected progress in the studies of the\nelectroexcitation of nucleon resonances in the third resonance region in the\nCLAS experiment. For the resonances N(1520)3/2-, N(1535)1/2-, and N(1675)5/2-,\nexperimental data on electroexcitation amplitudes on the proton are available\nin a wide range of Q2. This allowed us to quantify the expected meson-baryon\ncontributions to these amplitudes as a function of Q2.\n", "  Single crystals of the Sr$_2$RuO$_4$-Ru eutectic system are known to exhibit\nenhanced superconductivity at 3~K, in addition to the bulk superconductivity of\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$ at 1.5~K. The 1.5-K phase is believed to be a spin-triplet,\nchiral $p$-wave state with the multi-component order parameter, giving rise to\nchiral domain structure. In contrast, the 3-K phase is attributable to enhanced\nsuperconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the strained interface region between Ru\ninclusion of a few to tens of micrometers in size and the surrounding\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$. We investigate the dynamic behavior of a topological junction,\nwhere a superconductor is surrounded by another superconductor. Specifically,\nwe fabricated Nb/Ru/Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ topological superconducting junctions, in\nwhich the difference in phase winding between the $s$-wave superconductivity in\nRu micro-islands induced from Nb and the superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$\nmainly governs the junction behavior. Comparative results of the asymmetry,\nhysteresis and noise in junctions with different sizes, shapes, and\nconfigurations of Ru inclusions are explained by the chiral domain-wall motion\nin these topological junctions. Furthermore, a striking difference between the\n1.5-K and 3-K phases is clearly revealed: the large noise in the 1.5-K phase\nsharply disappears in the 3-K phase. These results confirm the multi-component\norder-parameter superconductivity of the bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, consistent with\nthe chiral $p$-wave state, and the proposed non-chiral single-component\nsuperconductivity of the 3-K phase.\n", "  In the recently published 3FGL catalogue, the Fermi/LAT collaboration reports\nthe detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission from 3034 sources obtained after four\nyears of observations. The nature of 1010 of those sources is unknown, whereas\n2023 have well-identified counterparts in other wavelengths. Most of the\nassociated sources are labelled as blazars (1717/2023), but the BL Lacs or FSRQ\nnature of 573 of these blazars is still undetermined.\n  The aim of this study was two-fold. First, to significantly increase the\nnumber of blazar candidates from a search among the large number of Fermi/LAT\n3FGL unassociated sources (case A). Second, to determine the BL Lac or FSRQ\nnature of the blazar candidates, including those determined as such in this\nwork and the blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) that are already present\nin the 3FGL catalogue (case B).\n  For this purpose, multivariate classifiers were trained using samples of\nlabelled sources with no caution flag from the 3FGL catalogue and carefully\nchosen discriminant parameters. The decisions of the classifiers were combined\nin order to obtain a high level of source identification along with well\ncontrolled numbers of expected false associations. Specifically for case A,\ndedicated classifications were generated for high and low galactic latitude\nsources, in addition, the application of classifiers to samples of sources with\ncaution flag was considered separately, and specific performance metrics were\nestimated.\n  We obtained a sample of 595 blazar candidates among the unassociated sources\nof the 3FGL catalogue. We also obtained a sample of 509 BL Lacs and 295 FSRQs\nfrom the blazar candidates cited above and the BCUs of the 3FGL catalogue. The\nnumber of expected false associations is given for different samples of\ncandidates. It is, in particular, notably low ($\\sim$9/425) for the sample of\nhigh-latitude blazar candidates from case A.\n", "  In incorporating the effect of atmospheric turbulence in the broadening of\nspectral lines, the so-called radial-tangential macroturbulence (RTM) model has\nbeen widely used in the field of solar-type stars, which was devised from an\nintuitive appearance of granular velocity field of the Sun. Since this model\nassumes that turbulent motions are restricted to only radial and tangential\ndirections, it has a special broadening function with notably narrow width due\nto the projection effect, the validity of which has not yet been confirmed in\npractice. With an aim to check whether this RTM model adequately represents the\nactual solar photospheric velocity field, we carried out an extensive study on\nthe non-thermal velocity dispersion along the line-of-sight (V_los) by\nanalyzing spectral lines at various points of the solar disk based on\nlocally-averaged as well as high spatial-resolution spectra, and found the\nfollowing results. First, the center-to-limb run of V_los derived from\nground-based low-resolution spectra is simply monotonic with a slightly\nincreasing tendency, which contradicts the specific trend (an appreciable peak\nat theta~45 deg) predicted from RTM. Second, the V_los values derived from a\nlarge number of spectra based on high-resolution space observation revealed to\nfollow a nearly normal distribution, without any sign of peculiar distribution\nexpected for the RTM case. These two observational facts indicate that the\nactual solar velocity field is not such simply dichotomous as assumed in RTM,\nbut directionally more chaotic. We thus conclude that RTM is not an adequate\nmodel at least for solar-type stars, which would significantly overestimate the\nturbulent velocity dispersion by a factor of ~2. The classical Gaussian\nmacroturbulence model should be more reasonable in this respect.\n", "  EXor objects are young variables that show episodic variations of brightness\ncommonly associated to enhanced accretion outbursts. With the aim of\ninvestigating the long-term photometric behaviour of a few EXor sources, we\npresent here data from the archival plates of the Asiago Observatory, showing\nthe Orion field where the three EXors V1118, V1143, and NY are located. A total\nof 484 plates were investigated, providing a total of more than 1000 magnitudes\nfor the three stars, which cover a period of about 35 yrs between 1959 to 1993.\nWe then compared our data with literature data. Apart from a newly discovered\nflare-up of V1118, we identify the same outbursts already known, but we provide\ntwo added values: (i) a long-term sampling of the quiescence phase; and (ii)\nrepeated multi-colour observations (BVRI bands). The former allows us to give a\nreliable characterisation of the quiescence, which represents a unique\nreference for studies that will analyze future outbursts and the physical\nchanges induced by these events. The latter is useful for confirming whether\nthe intermittent increases of brightness are accretion-driven (as in the case\nof V1118), or extinction-driven (as in the case of V1143). Accordingly, doubts\narise about the V1143 classification as a pure EXor object. Finally, although\nour plates do not separate NY Ori and the star very close to it, they indicate\nthat this EXor did not undergo any major outbursts during our 40 yrs of\nmonitoring.\n", "  Aims - Investigate the effects of resistivity and viscosity on the onset and\ngrowth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in an oscillating coronal\nloop. Methods - We modelled a standing kink wave in a density-enhanced loop\nwith the three dimensional (3-D), resistive magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d.\nWe conducted a parameter study on the viscosity and resistivity coefficients to\nexamine the effects of dissipation on the KHI. Results - Enhancing the\nviscosity and resistivity acts to suppress the KHI. Larger values delay the\nformation of the instability and, in some cases, prevent the onset completely.\nThis leads to the earlier onset of heating for smaller values of the transport\ncoefficients. We note that viscosity has a greater effect on the development of\nthe KHI than resistivity. Furthermore, when using anomalous resistivity, the\nOhmic heating rate associated with the KHI may be greater than that associated\nwith the phase mixing that occurs in an instability-suppressed regime (using\nuniform resistivity). Conclusions - From our study, it is clear that the\nheating rate crucially depends on the formation of small length scales\n(influenced by the numerical resolution) as well as the values of resistivity\nand viscosity. As larger values of the transport coefficients suppress the KHI,\nthe onset of heating is delayed but the heating rate is larger. As increased\nnumerical resolution allows smaller length scales to develop, the heating rate\nwill be higher even for the same transport coefficients.\n", "  We present theoretical and numerical investigations of vortices driven by\nstrong dc and ac currents in long Josephson junctions described by a nonlinear\nintegro-differential equation which takes into account nonlocal electrodynamics\nof films, vortex bremsstrahlung and Cherenkov radiation amplified by the\nattraction of vortices to the edges of the junction. The work focuses on the\ndynamics of vortices in Josephson junctions in thin films where the effects of\nJosephson nonlocality dominate but London screening is negligible. We obtained\nan exact solution for a vortex driven by an arbitrary time-dependent current in\nan overdamped junction where the vortex turns into a phase slip if the length\nof the junction is shorter than a critical length which depends on current. Our\nanalytical and numerical results show that the dynamic behavior of vortices\ndepends crucially on the ohmic damping parameter. In overdamped junctions\nvortices expand as they move faster and turn into phase slips as current\nincreases. In underdamped junctions vortices entering from the edges produce\nCherenkov radiation generating cascades of expanding vortex-antivortex pairs,\nwhich ultimately drive the entire junction into a resistive phase slip state.\nSimulations revealed a variety of complex dynamic states of vortices under dc\nand ac currents which can manifest themselves in hysteretic current-voltage\ncharacteristics with jumps and regions with negative differential resistance\nresulting from transitions from oscillating to ballistic propagation of\nvortices, their interaction with pinning centers and standing nonlinear waves\nin the junction.\n", "  Type IIP supernova progenitors are often surrounded by dense circumstellar\nmedia that may result from mass-loss enhancement of the progenitors shortly\nbefore their explosions. Previous light-curve studies suggest that the\nmass-loss rates are enhanced up to ~ 0.1 Msun/yr, assuming a constant wind\nvelocity. However, density of circumstellar media at the immediate stellar\nvicinity can be much higher than previously inferred for a given mass-loss rate\nif wind acceleration is taken into account. We show that the wind acceleration\nhas a huge impact when we estimate mass-loss rates from early light curves of\nType IIP supernovae by taking SN 2013fs as an example. We perform numerical\ncalculations of the interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar\nmedia with a constant mass-loss rate but with a beta-law wind velocity profile.\nWe find that the mass-loss rate of the progenitor of SN 2013fs shortly before\nthe explosion, which was inferred to be ~ 0.1 Msun/yr with a constant wind\nvelocity of 10 km/s by a previous light-curve modeling, can be as low as ~ 1e-3\nMsun/yr with the same terminal wind velocity of 10 km/s but with a wind\nvelocity profile with beta ~ 5. In both cases, the mass of the circumstellar\nmedium is similar (~ 0.5 Msun). Therefore, the beginning of the progenitor's\nmass-loss enhancement in our interpretation is ~ 100 years before the\nexplosion, not several years. Our result indicates that the immediate dense\nenvironment of Type II supernova progenitors may be significantly influenced by\nwind acceleration.\n", "  The gauge kinetic mixing in general is allowed in models with multiple\nAbelian gauge groups. In this paper, we investigate the gauge kinetic mixing in\nthe framework of $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM. It enlarges the viable\nparameter space, and has an important effect on the particle mass spectrum as\nwell as the $Z_2$ coupling with matters. The SM-like Higgs boson mass can be\nenhanced with a nonzero kinetic mixing parameter and the muon $g-2$ tension is\nslightly less severe than in the case of no mixing. We present the results from\nboth benchmark analysis and global parameter scan. Various theoretical and\nphenomenological constraints have been considered. The recent LHC searches for\nthe $Z_2$ boson are important for the case of large positive kinetic mixing\nwhere the $Z_2$ coupling is enhanced, and severely constrain scenarios with\n$M_{Z_2} < 2.8$ TeV. The viable dark matter candidate predicted by the model is\neither the neutralino or the right-handed sneutrino. Cosmological constraints\nfrom dark matter searches play a significant role in excluding the parameter\nspace. Portions of the parameter space with relatively low sparticle mass\nspectrum can be successfully explored in the LHC run-2 as well as future linear\ncolliders and dark matter searches.\n", "  We present a novel extension of the Standard Model which fulfills the\nmultiple-point principle without contradicting the Higgs particle mass\nmeasurement. In the model, the scalar potential has two minima where the scalar\nfield has vacuum expectation values of 246 GeV and the Planck mass $\\simeq\n2.44\\times 10^{18}$ GeV, the latter of which is realized by considering a\nclassically scale invariant setup and requiring that the scalar quartic\ncoupling and its beta function vanish at the Planck scale. The Standard Model\nHiggs field is a mixture of an elementary scalar and composite scalars in a new\nstrongly-coupled gauge theory, and the strong dynamics gives rise to the\nnegative mass for the SM Higgs field, and at the same time, causes separation\nof the SM Higgs quartic coupling and the quartic coupling for the elementary\nscalar, which leads to the vanshing of the latter quartic coupling and its beta\nfunction at the Planck scale. The model predicts new scalar particles with\nabout 300 GeV mass possessing electroweak charges and Yukawa-type couplings\nwith Standard Model fermions, and a new light gauge boson that couples to\nStandard Model fermions.\n", "  A two-step contagion model with a single seed serves as a cornerstone for\nunderstanding the critical behaviors and underlying mechanism of discontinuous\npercolation transitions induced by cascade dynamics. When the contagion spreads\nfrom a single seed, a cluster of infected and recovered nodes grows without any\ncluster merging process. However, when the contagion starts from multiple seeds\nof $O(N)$ where $N$ is the system size, a node weakened by a seed can be\ninfected more easily when it is in contact with another node infected by a\ndifferent pathogen seed. This contagion process can be viewed as a cluster\nmerging process in a percolation model. Here, we show analytically and\nnumerically that when the density of infectious seeds is relatively small but\n$O(1)$, the epidemic transition is hybrid, exhibiting both continuous and\ndiscontinuous behavior, whereas when it is sufficiently large and reaches a\ncritical point, the transition becomes continuous. We determine the full set of\ncritical exponents describing the hybrid and the continuous transitions. Their\ncritical behaviors differ from those in the single-seed case.\n", "  Accretion disks in binary systems can experience hydrodynamic impact at inner\nas well as outer edges. The first case is typical for protoplanetary disks\naround young T Tau stars. The second one is typical for circumstellar disks in\nclose binaries. As a result of such an impact, perturbations with different\nscales and amplitudes are excited in the disk. We investigated the nonlinear\nevolution of perturbations of a finite, but small amplitude, at the background\nof sub-Keplerian flow. Nonlinear effects at the front of perturbations lead to\nthe formation of a shock wave, namely the discontinuity of the density and\nradial velocity. At this, the tangential flow in the neighborhood of the shock\nbecomes equivalent to the flow in in the boundary layer. Instability of the\ntangential flow further leads to turbulization of the disk. Characteristics of\nthe turbulence depend on perturbation parameters, but alpha-parameter of\nShakura-Sunyaev does not exceed ~0.1.\n", "  Using a fully-fledged formulation of gauge field theory deformed by the\nspacetime noncommutativity, we study its impact on relic neutrino direct\ndetection, as proposed recently by the PTOLEMY experiment. The noncommutative\nbackground tends to influence the propagating neutrinos by providing them with\na tree-level vector-like coupling to photons, enabling thus otherwise\nright-handed (RH) neutrinos to be thermally produced in the early universe.\nSuch a new component in the universe's background radiation has been switched\ntoday to the almost fully active sea of non-relativistic neutrinos, exerting\nconsequently some impact on the capture on tritium at PTOLEMY. The\npeculiarities of our nonperturbative approach tend to reflect in the cosmology\nas well, upon the appearances of the coupling temperature, above which\n  RH neutrinos stay permanently decoupled from thermal environment. This\nentails the maximal scale of noncommutativity as well, being of order of\n$10^{-4} M_{Pl}$, above which there is no impact whatsoever on the capture\nrates at PTOLEMY. The latter represents an exceptional upper bound on the scale\nof noncommutativity coming from phenomenology.\n", "  We provide new representations for the finite parts at the poles and the\nderivative at zero of the Barnes zeta function in any dimension in the general\ncase. These representations are in the forms of series and limits. We also give\nan integral representation for the finite parts at the poles. Similar results\nare derived for an associated function, which we term homogeneous Barnes zeta\nfunction. Our expressions immediately yield analogous representations for the\nlogarithm of the Barnes Gamma function, including the particular case also\nknown as multiple Gamma function.\n", "  Single inclusive particle production cross sections in high energy hadron\ncollisions at forward rapidity are an important benchmark process for the CGC\npicture of small x QCD. Recent calculations of this process have not led to a\nstable perturbative expansion for this quantity at high transverse momenta. We\nconsider the quark channel production cross section using the new rapidity\nfactorization procedure proposed by Iancu et al. We show that for fixed\ncoupling one does indeed obtain a physically meaningful cross section which is\npositive and reduces in a controlled way to previous leading order\ncalculations. We also consider a running coupling that depends on the\ntransverse momentum of the produced particle. This gives a stable result which,\nhowever, is not fully consistent with previous leading order calculations that\nuse a coordinate space running coupling.\n", "  We analyze the Hilbert space and ground state structure of bilayer quantum\nHall (BLQH) systems at fractional filling factors $\\nu=2/\\lambda$ ($\\lambda$\nodd) and we also study the large $SU(4)$ isospin-$\\lambda$ limit. The model\nHamiltonian is an adaptation of the $\\nu=2$ case [Z.F. Ezawa {\\it et al.},\nPhys. Rev. {B71} (2005) 125318] to the many-body situation (arbitrary $\\lambda$\nflux quanta per electron). The semiclassical regime and quantum phase diagram\n(in terms of layer distance, Zeeeman, tunneling, etc, control parameters) is\nobtained by using previously introduced Grassmannian\n$\\mathbb{G}^4_{2}=U(4)/[U(2)\\times U(2)]$ coherent states as variational\nstates. The existence of three quantum phases (spin, canted and ppin) is common\nto any $\\lambda$, but the phase transition points depend on $\\lambda$, and the\ninstance $\\lambda=1$ is recovered as a particular case. We also analyze the\nquantum case through a numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and compare\nwith the mean-field results, which give a good approximation in the spin and\nppin phases but not in the canted phase, where we detect exactly $\\lambda$\nenergy level crossings between the ground and first excited state for given\nvalues of the tunneling gap. An energy band structure at low and high\ninterlayer tunneling (spin and ppin phases, respectively) also appears\ndepending on angular momentum and layer population imbalance quantum numbers.\n", "  We study coherent transport of levitons through a single-level quantum dot\nsystem driven by Lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses. We demonstrate the repeated\nemergence of the Kondo resonance in the dynamical regimes where the Fermi sea\nis driven by optimal pulses free of particle-hole excitations. The formation of\nthe Kondo resonance significantly enhances the dc transport of levitons.\n", "  Seyfert 1.8/1.9 are sources showing weak broad H-alpha components in their\noptical spectra. We aim at testing whether Seyfert 1.8/1.9 have similar\nproperties at UV and X-ray wavelengths to Seyfert 2. We use the 15 Seyfert\n1.8/1.9 in the Veron Cetty and Veron catalogue with public data available from\nthe Chandra and/or XMM-Newton archives at different dates, with timescales\nbetween observations ranging from days to years. Our results are homogeneously\ncompared with a previous work using the same methodology applied to a sample of\nSeyfert 2 (Hernandez-Garcia et al. 2015). X-ray variability is found in all 15\nnuclei over the aforementioned ranges of timescales. The main variability\npattern is related to intrinsic changes in the sources, which are observed in\nten nuclei. Changes in the column density are also frequent, as they are\nobserved in six nuclei, and variations at soft energies, possibly related to\nscattered nuclear emission, are detected in six sources. X-ray intraday\nvariations are detected in six out of the eight studied sources. Variations at\nUV frequencies are detected in seven out of nine sources. A comparison between\nthe samples of Seyfert 1.8/1.9 and 2 shows that, even if the main variability\npattern is due to intrinsic changes of the sources in the two families, these\nnuclei exhibit different variability properties in the UV and X-ray domains. In\nparticular, variations in the broad X-ray band on short time-scales\n(days/weeks), and variations in the soft X-rays and UV on long time-scales\n(months/years) are detected in Seyfert 1.8/1.9 but not in Seyfert 2. Overall,\nwe suggest that optically classified Seyfert 1.8/1.9 should be kept separated\nfrom Seyfert 2 galaxies in UV/X-ray studies of the obscured AGN population\nbecause their intrinsic properties might be different.\n", "  A tight non-linear relation exists between the X-ray and UV emission in\nquasars (i.e. $L_{\\rm X}\\propto L_{\\rm UV}^{\\gamma}$), with a dispersion of\n$\\sim$0.2~dex over $\\sim$3~orders of magnitude in luminosity. Here we propose a\nmodified version of this relation which involves the broad emission lines'\nfull-width at half maximum, $L_{\\rm X}\\propto L_{\\rm\nUV}^{\\hat\\gamma}\\upsilon_{\\rm fwhm}^{\\hat\\beta}$. We interpret this new\nrelation through a simple, {\\it ad-hoc} model of accretion disc corona, derived\nfrom previous works where it is assumed that reconnection and magnetic loops\nabove the accretion disc can account for the production of the primary X-ray\nradiation. We find that the monochromatic optical-UV (2500 \\AA) and X-ray (2\nkeV) luminosities depend on the black hole mass and accretion rate as $L_{\\rm\nUV}\\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{4/3} (\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd})^{2/3}$ and $L_{\\rm\nX}\\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{19/21} (\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd})^{5/21}$, respectively.\nAssuming a broad line region size function of the disc luminosity $R_{\\rm\nblr}\\propto L_{\\rm disc}^{0.5}$ we finally have that $L_{\\rm X}\\propto L_{\\rm\nUV}^{4/7} \\upsilon_{\\rm fwhm}^{4/7}$. Such relation is remarkably consistent\nwith the slopes and the normalization obtained from a fit of a sample of 545\noptically selected quasars from SDSS DR7 cross matched with the latest\nXMM-Newton catalogue 3XMM-DR6. The homogeneous sample used here has a\ndispersion of 0.21 dex, which is much lower than previous works in the\nliterature and suggests a tight physical relation between the accretion disc\nand the X-ray emitting corona. The proposed new relation does not evolve with\ntime, and thus it can be employed as a cosmological indicator to robustly\nestimate cosmological parameters.\n", "  We propose the universal approach to describe spreading widths of monopole,\ndipole and quadrupole giant resonances in heavy and superheavy spherical\nnuclei. Our approach is based on the ideas of the random matrix distribution of\nthe coupling between one-phonon and two-phonon states generated in the random\nphase approximation. We use the Skyrme interaction SLy4 as our model\nHamiltonian to create a single-particle spectrum and to analyze excited states\nof the doubly magic nuclei $^{132}$Sn, $^{208}$Pb and $^{310}$126. Our results\ndemonstrate that the universal approach enables to describe gross structure of\nthe spreading widths of the considered giant resonances.\n", "  In order to investigate the physical relationship between strong Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (logN_HI>20.0 cm^-2) such as damped Ly-alpha absorption systems\n(DLAs) and young star-forming galaxies at high redshift, we have conducted\nnarrow-band observations of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) in a concentrated region\nof strong Ly-alpha absorbers at z= 2.3, the J1230+34 field. Using a catalog of\nLy-alpha absorbers with logN_HI>20.0 cm^-2 based on the baryon oscillation\nspectroscopic survey (BOSS), we found 6 fields where 3 or more absorbers are\nconcentrated within a (50 Mpc)^3 cubic box in the comoving scale. Among them,\nwe focus on the J1230+34 field, where 2 DLAs and 2 sub-DLAs present. Our\nnarrow-band imaging observations with Subaru/Suprime-Cam using a custom-made\nfilter, NB400 (lambda_c=4003 A and FWHM=92 A) yield a sample of 149 LAEs in\nthis field. In the large scale (~50 Mpc), we have found no differences between\nthe obtained Ly-alpha luminosity function and those in the blank fields at\nsimilar redshifts. We also compare the frequency distribution of the Ly-alpha\nrest-frame equivalent width (EW_0) in the target field and other fields\nincluding both overdensity region and blank field, but find no differences. On\nthe other hand, in the small scale (~10 Mpc), we have found a possible\noverdensity of LAEs around a DLA with the highest HI column density (N_HI=21.08\ncm^-2) in the target field while there are no density excess around the other\nabsorbers with a lower N_HI.\n", "  We investigate interactions of stellar binaries in galactic nuclear clusters\nwith a massive black hole (MBH). We consider binaries on highly eccentric\norbits around the MBH that change due to random gravitational interactions with\nother stars in the nuclear stellar cluster. The pericenters of the orbits\nperform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly\nbrings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty\nloss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected\nseparation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.\nThis happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions\nwith the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the\nbinary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis. This frequently reduces\nthe pericenter separation to values below typical stellar diameters, which\ninduces a significant fraction of such binaries to merge ($\\gtrsim 75\\%$ in our\nset of numerical experiments). Stellar tides do not appreciably change the\ntotal rate of mergers but circularise binaries, leading to a significant\nfraction of low-eccentricity, low-impact-velocity mergers. Some of the stellar\nmerger products will then be tidally disrupted by the MBH within $\\sim 10^6$\nyears. If the merger strongly enhances the magnetic field of the merger\nproduct, this process could explain observations of prompt relativistic jet\nformation in some tidal disruption events.\n", "  In this Letter, we analytically solve the evolution equations for the\nsmall-$x$ asymptotic behavior of the (flavor singlet) quark helicity\ndistribution in the large-$N_c$ limit. These evolution equations form a set of\ncoupled integro-differential equations, which previously could only be solved\nnumerically. This approximate numerical solution, however, revealed simplifying\nproperties of the small-$x$ asymptotics, which we exploit here to obtain an\nanalytic solution. We find that the small-$x$ power-law tail of the quark\nhelicity distribution scales as $\\Delta q^S (x, Q^2) \\sim \\left(\\tfrac{1}{x}\n\\right)^{\\alpha_h}$ with $\\alpha_h = \\tfrac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\alpha_s\nN_c}{2\\pi}}$, in excellent agreement with the numerical estimate $\\alpha_h\n\\approx 2.31\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\alpha_s N_c}{2\\pi}}$ obtained previously. We then\nverify this solution by cross-checking the predicted scaling behavior of the\nauxiliary \"neighbor dipole amplitude\" against the numerics, again finding\nexcellent agreement.\n", "  While supermassive black holes are known to co-evolve with their host galaxy,\nthe precise nature and origin of this co-evolution is not clear. We here\nexplore the possible connection between star formation and black hole growth in\nthe circumnuclear disk (CND) to probe this connection in the vicinity close to\nthe black hole. We adopt here the circumnuclear disk model developed by\nKawakatu & Wada (2008) and Wutschik et al. (2013), and explore both the\ndependence on the star formation recipe as well as the role of the\ngravitational field, which can be dominated by the central black hole, the CND\nitself or the host galaxy. A specific emphasis is put on the turbulence\nregulated star formation model by Krumholz et al. (2005) to explore the impact\nof a realistic star formation recipe. It is shown that this model helps to\nintroduce realistic fluctuations in the black hole and star formation rate,\nwithout overestimating them. Consistent with previous works, we show that the\nfinal black hole masses are rather insensitive to the masses of the initial\nseeds, even for seed masses of up to 10^6 M_sol. In addition, we apply our\nmodel to the formation of high-redshift quasars, as well as to the nearby\nsystem NGC 6951, where a tentative comparison is made in spite of the presence\nof a bar in the galaxy. We show that our model can reproduce the high black\nhole masses of the high-redshift quasars within a sufficiently short time,\nprovided a high mass supply rate from the host galaxy. In addition, it\nreproduces several of the properties observed in NGC 6951. With respect to the\nlatter system, our analysis suggests that supernova feedback may be important\nto create the observed fluctuations in the star formation history as a result\nof negative feedback effects.\n", "  RX J1856.5$-$3754 is the brightest and nearest ($\\sim 120$ pc) source among\nthermally emitting isolated neutron stars. Its spectra observed with {\\sl\nXMM-Newton} and {\\sl Chandra} satellites are well-fitted with the\ntwo-temperature ($kT^\\infty \\sim$ 32 and 63 eV) blackbody model. Fitting ten\nsets of the data from {\\sl Suzaku} XIS0, XIS1, XIS3 and {\\sl XMM-Newton}\nEPIC-pn with the two-temperature blackbody model, we discover an excess\nemission, 16--26\\% in 0.8--1.2\\,keV. We examine possible causes of this\nkeV-X-ray excess; uncertainty in the background, pile up of the low energy\nphotons and confusion of other sources. None of them succeeds in explaining the\nkeV-X-ray excess observed with different instruments. We thus consider this\nkeV-X-ray excess is most likely originated in RX J1856.5$-$3754. However, it is\ndifficult to constrain the spectral shape of the keV-X-ray excess. The third\nblackbody component with $kT^\\infty = 137^{+18}_{-14}$ eV, additional power-law\ncomponent with a photon index $\\Gamma = 3.4^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$, or Comptonization\nof blackbody seed photons into power-law with a photon index $\\Gamma_c =\n4.3^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$ can reproduce the keV-X-ray excess. We also search for the\nperiodicity of 0.8--1.2\\,keV data, since 7.055 s pulsation is discovered from\n0.15--1.2\\,keV band in the XMM Newton EPIC-pn data ($\\sim$1.5\\%). We only\nobtain the upper limit of pulsed fraction $<$ 3\\% in the keV-X-ray excess. We\nshortly discuss the possible origin of the keV-X-ray excess, such as\nsynchrotron radiation and Comptonization of blackbody photons.\n", "  Context: Light curves (LCs) of some symbiotic stars show a different slope of\nthe ascending and descending branch of their minimum profile. The origin of\nthis asymmetry is not understood well.\n  Aims: We explain this effect in the ultraviolet LCs of the symbiotic binary\nSY Mus.\n  Methods: We model the continuum fluxes in the spectra obtained by the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer at 10 wavelengths, from 1280 to 3080 \\AA. We\nconsider that the white dwarf radiation is attenuated by $H^0$ atoms, $H^-$\nions and free electrons in the red giant wind. Variation in the nebular\ncomponent is approximated by a sine wave along the orbit as suggested by\nspectral energy distribution models. The model includes asymmetric wind\nvelocity distribution and the corresponding ionization structure of the binary.\n  Results: We determined distribution of the $H^0$ and $H^+$, as well as upper\nlimits of $H^-$ and $H^0$ column densities in the neutral and ionized region at\nthe selected wavelengths as functions of the orbital phase. Corresponding\nmodels of the LCs match well the observed continuum fluxes. In this way, we\nsuggested the main UV continuum absorbing (scattering) processes in the\ncircumbinary environment of S-type symbiotic stars.\n  Conclusions: The asymmetric profile of the ultraviolet LCs of SY Mus is\ncaused by the asymmetric distribution of the circumstellar matter at the\nnear-orbital-plane area.\n", "  We discuss the effects of the electromagnetic interaction in high-energy\nproton collisions with nuclei of large Z at strong coupling $\\lambda=g^2N_c$.\nUsing the holographic dual limit of large $N_c>\\lambda\\gg 1$, we describe the\nReggeon exchange as a twisted surface and show that it gets essentially\nmodified by the electromagnetic interaction.\n", "  We examine the two-photon exchange corrections to elastic electron-proton\nscattering within a dispersive approach, including contributions from both\nNucleon and Delta intermediate states. The dispersive analysis avoids off-shell\nuncertainties inherent in traditional approaches based on direct evaluation of\nloop diagrams, and guarantees the correct unitary behavior in the high energy\nlimit. Using empirical information on the electromagnetic nucleon elastic and\nN-Delta transition form factors, we compute the two-photon exchange corrections\nboth algebraically and numerically. Results are compared with recent\nmeasurements of e+p to e-p cross section ratios from the CLAS, VEPP-3 and\nOLYMPUS experiments, as well as with polarization transfer observables.\n", "  We propose and evaluate a method to construct a quantum correlated twin atom\nlaser using a pumped and damped Bose-Hubbard inline trimer which can operate in\na stationary regime. With pumping via a source condensate filling the middle\nwell and damping using either an electron beam or optical means at the two end\nwells, we show that bipartite quantum correlations build up between the ends of\nthe chain, and that these can be measured either in situ or in the outcoupled\nbeams. While nothing similar to our system has yet been achieved\nexperimentally, recent advances mean that it should be practically realisable\nin the near future.\n", "  The hadronic phase in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions has a large\ninfluence on final state observables like multiplicity, flow and $p_t$ spectra,\nas studied in the UrQMD approach. In this model one assumes that a\nnon-equilibrium decoupling phase follows a fluid dynamical description of the\nhigh density phase. Hadrons are produced assuming local thermal equilibrium and\ndynamically decouple during the hadronic rescattering until the particles are\nregistered in the detectors. This rescattering of hadrons modifies every\nhadronic bulk observable. The apparent multiplicity of resonances is suppressed\nas compared to a chemical equilibrium freeze-out model, because the decay\nproducts rescatter. Therefore the resonances, which decay in the early hadronic\nphase, cannot be identified anymore by the invariant mass method. Stable and\nunstable particles change their momentum distribution by more than 30$\\%$\nthrough rescattering and their multiplicity is modified by resonance production\nand annihilation on a similar magnitude. These findings show that it is all but\ntrivial to conclude from the final state observables on the properties of the\nsystem at an earlier time where it may have been in local equilibrium.\n", "  We develope a two-species exclusion process with a distinct pair of entry and\nexit sites for each species of rigid rods. The relatively slower forward\nstepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the\ntwo entry sites, controls the extent of interference of the co-directional flow\nof the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites of entry of the\ntwo species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are\nmotivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study\nhere is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two\nspecies of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of\nthis interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field\ntheory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods\nand their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the\nsystem. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become\npractically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental\nphysical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the\ndownstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated\nby the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of\nthe results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the\nformulation of the theoretical model.\n", "  Femtosecond time-resolved X-ray diffraction is used to study a photo-induced\nphase transition between two charge density wave (CDW) states in 1T-TaS$_2$,\nnamely the nearly commensurate (NC) and the incommensurate (I) CDW states.\nStructural modulations associated with the NC-CDW order are found to disappear\nwithin 400 fs. The photo-induced I-CDW phase then develops through a\nnucleation/growth process which ends 100 ps after laser excitation. We\ndemonstrate that the newly formed I-CDW phase is fragmented into several\nnanometric domains that are growing through a coarsening process. The\ncoarsening dynamics is found to follow the universal Lifshitz-Allen-Cahn growth\nlaw, which describes the ordering kinetics in systems exhibiting a\nnon-conservative order parameter.\n", "  We report the discovery and the analysis of the planetary microlensing event,\nOGLE-2013-BLG-1761. There are some degenerate solutions in this event because\nthe planetary anomaly is only sparsely sampled. But the detailed light curve\nanalysis ruled out all stellar binary models and shows that the lens to be a\nplanetary system. There is the so-called close/wide degeneracy in the solutions\nwith the planet/host mass ratio of $q \\sim (7.5 \\pm 1.5) \\times 10^{-3}$ and $q\n\\sim (9.3 \\pm 2.9) \\times 10^{-3}$ with the projected separation in Einstein\nradius units of $s = 0.95$ (close) and $s = 1.19$ (wide), respectively. The\nmicrolens parallax effect is not detected but the finite source effect is\ndetected. Our Bayesian analysis indicates that the lens system is located at\n$D_{\\rm L}=6.9_{-1.2}^{+1.0} \\ {\\rm kpc}$ away from us and the host star is an\nM/K-dwarf with the mass of $M_{\\rm L}=0.33_{-0.18}^{+0.32} \\ M_{\\odot}$ orbited\nby a super-Jupiter mass planet with the mass of $m_{\\rm P}=2.8_{-1.5}^{+2.5} \\\nM_{\\rm Jup}$ at the projected separation of $a_{\\perp}=1.8_{-0.5}^{+0.5} \\ {\\rm\nAU}$. The preference of the large lens distance in the Bayesian analysis is due\nto the relatively large observed source star radius. The distance and other\nphysical parameters can be constrained by the future high resolution imaging by\nground large telescopes or HST. If the estimated lens distance is correct, this\nplanet provides another sample for testing the claimed deficit of planets in\nthe Galactic bulge.\n", "  Recently LHCb reported the discovery of five extremely narrow excited\n$\\Omega_c$ baryons decaying into $\\Xi_c^+ K^-$. We interpret these baryons as\nbound states of a $c$-quark and a $P$-wave $ss$-diquark. For such a system\nthere are exactly five possible combinations of spin and orbital angular\nmomentum. The narrowness of the states could be a signal that it is hard to\npull apart the two $s$-quarks in a diquark. We predict two of spin 1/2, two of\nspin 3/2, and one of spin 5/2, all with negative parity. Of the five states two\ncan decay in $S$-wave and three can decay in $D$-wave. Some of the $D$-wave\nstates might be narrower than the $S$-wave states. We discuss relations among\nthe five masses expected in the quark model and the likely spin assignments and\ncompare with the data. A similar pattern is expected for negative-parity\nexcited $\\Omega_b$ states. An alternative interpretation is noted in which the\nheaviest two states are $2S$ excitations with $J^P = 1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$, while\nthe lightest three are those with $J^P = 3/2^-,3/2^-,5/2^-$ expected to decay\nvia $D$-waves. In this case we expect $J^P = 1/2^-$ $\\Omega_c$ states around\n2904 and 2978 MeV.\n", "  We study time evolution of critical fluctuations of conserved charges near\nthe QCD critical point in the context of relativistic heavy ion collisions. A\nstochastic diffusion equation is employed in order to describe the diffusion\nproperty of the critical fluctuation arising from the coupling of the order\nparameter field to conserved charges. We show that the diffusion property gives\nrise to a possibility of probing the early time fluctuations through the\nrapidity window dependence of the second-order cumulant and correlation\nfunction of conserved charges. It is pointed out that their non-monotonic\nbehaviors as functions of the rapidity interval are robust experimental signals\nfor the existence of the critical enhancement around the QCD critical point.\n", "  We demonstrate a topological classification of vortices in three dimensional\ntime-reversal invariant topological superconductors based on superconducting\nDirac semimetals with an s-wave superconducting order parameter by means of a\npair of numbers $(N_\\Phi,N)$, accounting how many units $N_\\Phi$ of magnetic\nfluxes $hc/4e$ and how many $N$ chiral Majorana modes the vortex carries. From\nthese quantities, we introduce a topological invariant which further classifies\nthe properties of such vortices under linking processes. While such processes\nare known to be related to instanton processes in a field theoretic\ndescription, we demonstrate here that they are, in fact, also equivalent to the\nfractional Josephson effect on junctions based at the edges of quantum spin\nHall systems. This allows one to consider microscopically the effects of\ninteractions in the linking problem. We therefore demonstrate that associated\nto links between vortices, one has the exchange of quasi-particles, either\nMajorana zero-modes or $e/2$ quasi-particles, which allows for a topological\nclassification of vortices in these systems, seen to be $\\mathbb{Z}_8$\nclassified. While $N_\\Phi$ and $N$ are shown to be both even or odd in the\nweakly-interacting limit, in the strongly interacting scenario one loosens this\nconstraint. In this case, one may have further fractionalization possibilities\nfor the vortices, whose excitations are described by $SO(3)_3$-like conformal\nfield theories with quasi-particle exchanges of more exotic types.\n", "  The Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are features of measurement-driven quantum\nevolution where frequent measurement inhibits or accelerates the decay of a\nquantum state. Either type of evolution can emerge depending on the\nsystem-environment interaction and measurement method. In this experiment, we\nuse a superconducting qubit to map out both types of Zeno effect in the\npresence of structured noise baths and variable measurement rates. We observe\nboth the suppression and acceleration of qubit decay as repeated measurements\nare used to modulate the qubit spectrum causing the qubit to sample different\nportions of the bath. We compare the Zeno effects arising from dispersive\nenergy measurements and purely-dephasing `quasi'-measurements, showing energy\nmeasurements are not necessary to accelerate or suppress the decay process.\n", "  We report discovery of the lowest mass ratio exoplanet to be found by the\nmicrolensing method in the light curve of the event OGLE~2016--BLG--1195. This\nplanet revealed itself as a small deviation from a microlensing single lens\nprofile from an examination of the survey data soon after the planetary signal.\nThe duration of the planetary signal is $\\sim 2.5\\,$hours. The measured ratio\nof the planet mass to its host star is $q = 4.2\\pm 0.7 \\times10^{-5}$. We\nfurther estimate that the lens system is likely to comprise a cold $\\sim$3\nEarth mass planet in a $\\sim\\,$2 AU wide orbit around a 0.2 Solar mass star at\nan overall distance of 7.1 kpc.\n", "  We demonstrate that the geometric volume of a soliton coincides with the\nthermodynamical volume also for field theories with higher-dimensional vacuum\nmanifolds (e.g., for gauged scalar field theories supporting vortices or\nmonopoles). We apply this observation to understand Bradlow type bounds for\ngeneral abelian gauge theories supporting vortices. In the case of SDiff BPS\nmodels (being examples of perfect fluid models) we show that the geometric\n\"volume\" (area) of the vortex, which is base-space independent, is exactly\nequal to the Bradlow volume (a minimal volume for which a BPS soliton solution\nexists). This can be finite for compactons or infinite for infinitely extended\nsolitons (in flat Minkowski space-time).\n", "  An optimized interatomic potential has been constructed for silicon using a\nmodified Tersoff model. The potential reproduces a wide range of properties of\nSi and improves over existing potentials with respect to point defect\nstructures and energies, surface energies and reconstructions, thermal\nexpansion, melting temperature and other properties. The proposed potential is\ncompared with three other potentials from the literature. The potentials\ndemonstrate reasonable agreement with first-principles binding energies of\nsmall Si clusters as well as single-layer and bilayer silicenes. The four\npotentials are used to evaluate the thermal stability of free-standing\nsilicenes in the form of nano-ribbons, nano-flakes and nano-tubes. While\nsingle-layer silicene is mechanically stable at zero Kelvin, it is predicted to\nbecome unstable and collapse at room temperature. By contrast, the bilayer\nsilicene demonstrates a larger bending rigidity and remains stable at and even\nabove room temperature. The results suggest that bilayer silicene might exist\nin a free-standing form at ambient conditions.\n", "  We search type 1 AGNs among emission-line galaxies, that are typically\nclassified as type 2 AGNs based on emission line flux ratios if a broad\ncomponent in the H$\\alpha$ line profile is not properly investigated. Using\n~24,000 type 2 AGNs at z $<$0.1 initially selected from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 7 by Bae, et al. 2014, we identify a sample of 611 type 1\nAGNs based on the spectral fitting results and visual inspection. These hidden\ntype 1 AGNs have relatively low luminosity with a mean broad \\Ha\\ luminosity,\nlog L$_{\\rm H\\alpha }$ $=$ 40.73$\\pm$0.32 \\ergs\\, and low Eddington ratio with\na mean log L$_{bol}$/L$_{\\rm Edd}$ $=$ -2.04$\\pm$0.34, while they do follow the\nblack hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation defined by the inactive\ngalaxies and the reverberation-mapped type 1 AGNs. We investigate ionized gas\noutflows based on the [OIII] $\\lambda$5007 kinematics, which show relatively\nhigh velocity dispersion and velocity shift, indicating that the line-of-sight\nvelocity and velocity dispersion of the ionized gas in type 1 AGNs is on\naverage larger than that of type 2 AGNs.\n", "  We aim at characterizing the large-scale distribution of H2O in G327.3-0.6, a\nmassive star-forming region made of individual objects in different\nevolutionary phases. We investigate variations of H2O abundance as function of\nevolution. We present Herschel continuum maps at 89 and 179 $\\mu$m of the whole\nregion and an APEX map at 350 {\\mu}m of the IRDC. New spectral HIFI maps toward\nthe IRDC region covering low-energy H2O lines at 987 and 1113 GHz are also\npresented and combined with HIFI pointed observations of the G327 hot core. We\ninfer the physical properties of the gas through optical depth analysis and\nradiative transfer modeling. The continuum emission at 89 and 179 {\\mu}m\nfollows the thermal continuum emission at longer wavelengths, with a peak at\nthe position of the hot core, a secondary peak in the Hii region, and an\narch-like layer of hot gas west of the Hii region. The same morphology is\nobserved in the 1113 GHz line, in absorption toward all dust condensations.\nOptical depths of ~80 and 15 are estimated and correspond to column densities\nof 10^15 and 2 10^14 cm-2, for the hot core and IRDC position. These values\nindicate an H2O to H2 ratio of 3 10^-8 toward the hot core; the abundance of\nH2O does not change along the IRDC with values of some 10^-8. Infall (over ~\n20\") is detected toward the hot core position with a rate of 1-1.3 10^-2 M_sun\n/yr, high enough to overcome the radiation pressure due to the stellar\nluminosity. The source structure of the hot core region is complex, with a cold\nouter gas envelope in expansion, situated between the outflow and the observer,\nextending over 0.32 pc. The outflow is seen face-on and centered away from the\nhot core. The distribution of H2O along the IRDC is roughly constant with an\nabundance peak in the more evolved object. These water abundances are in\nagreement with previous studies in other massive objects and chemical models.\n", "  The Atacama Large Millimeter/submilimeter Array (ALMA) recently revealed a\nset of nearly concentric gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young\nstar HL Tau. If these are carved by forming gas giants, this provides the first\nset of orbital initial conditions for planets as they emerge from their birth\ndisks. Using N-body integrations, we have followed the evolution of the system\nfor 5 Gyr to explore the possible outcomes. We find that HL Tau initial\nconditions scaled down to the size of typically observed exoplanet orbits\nnaturally produce several populations in the observed exoplanet sample. First,\nfor a plausible range of planetary masses, we can match the observed\neccentricity distribution of dynamically excited radial velocity giant planets\nwith eccentricities $>$ 0.2. Second, we roughly obtain the observed rate of hot\nJupiters around FGK stars. Finally, we obtain a large efficiency of planetary\nejections of $\\approx 2$ per HL Tau-like system, but the small fraction of\nstars observed to host giant planets makes it hard to match the rate of\nfree-floating planets inferred from microlensing observations. In view of\nupcoming GAIA results, we also provide predictions for the expected mutual\ninclination distribution, which is significantly broader than the absolute\ninclination distributions typically considered by previous studies.\n", "  We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12, which is the largest\navailable white dwarf catalog to date, to study the evolution of the\nkinematical properties of the population of white dwarfs in the Galactic disc.\nWe derive masses, ages, photometric distances and radial velocities for all\nwhite dwarfs with hydrogen-rich atmospheres. For those stars for which proper\nmotions from the USNO-B1 catalog are available the true three-dimensional\ncomponents of the stellar space velocity are obtained. This subset of the\noriginal sample comprises 20,247 objects, making it the largest sample of white\ndwarfs with measured three-dimensional velocities. Furthermore, the volume\nprobed by our sample is large, allowing us to obtain relevant kinematical\ninformation. In particular, our sample extends from a Galactocentric radial\ndistance $R_{\\rm G}=7.8$~kpc to 9.3~kpc, and vertical distances from the\nGalactic plane ranging from $Z=-0.5$~kpc to 0.5~kpc. We examine the mean\ncomponents of the stellar three-dimensional velocities, as well as their\ndispersions with respect to the Galactocentric and vertical distances. We\nconfirm the existence of a mean Galactocentric radial velocity gradient,\n$\\partial\\langle V_{\\rm R}\\rangle/\\partial R_{\\rm\nG}=-3\\pm5$~km~s$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$. We also confirm North-South differences in\n$\\langle V_{\\rm z}\\rangle$. Specifically, we find that white dwarfs with $Z>0$\n(in the North Galactic hemisphere) have $\\langle V_{\\rm z}\\rangle<0$, while the\nreverse is true for white dwarfs with $Z<0$. The age-velocity dispersion\nrelation derived from the present sample indicates that the Galactic population\nof white dwarfs may have experienced an additional source of heating, which\nadds to the secular evolution of the Galactic disc.\n", "  In the context of gauge/gravity dualities, we calculate the scalar and tensor\nmass spectrum of the boundary theory defined by a special 8-scalar sigma-model\nin five dimensions, the background solutions of which include the 1-parameter\nfamily dual to the baryonic branch of the Klebanov-Strassler field theory. This\nprovides an example of a strongly-coupled, multi-scale system that yields a\nparametrically light mass for one of the composite scalar particles: the\ndilaton. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings towards\nidentifying a satisfactory solution to both the big and little hierarchy\nproblems of the electro-weak theory.\n", "  Many protostellar gapped and binary discs show misalignments between their\ninner and outer discs; in some cases, $\\sim70$ degree misalignments have been\nobserved. Here we show that these misalignments can be generated through a\n\"secular precession resonance\" between the nodal precession of the inner disc\nand the precession of the gap-opening (stellar or massive planetary) companion.\nAn evolving protostellar system may naturally cross this resonance during its\nlifetime due to disc dissipation and/or companion migration. If resonance\ncrossing occurs on the right timescale, of order a few Myrs, characteristic for\nyoung protostellar systems, the inner and outer discs can become highly\nmisaligned ($\\gtrsim 60$ degrees). When the primary star has a mass of order a\nsolar mass, generating a significant misalignment typically requires the\ncompanion to have a mass of $\\sim 0.01-0.1$ M$_\\odot$ and an orbital separation\nof tens of AU. The recently observed companion in the cavity of the gapped,\nhighly misaligned system HD 142527 satisfies these requirements, indicating\nthat a previous resonance crossing event misaligned the inner and outer discs.\nOur scenario for HD 142527's misaligned discs predicts that the companion's\norbital plane is aligned with the outer disc's; this prediction should be\ntestable with future observations as the companion's orbit is mapped out.\nMisalignments observed in several other gapped disc systems could be generated\nby the same secular resonance mechanism.\n", "  It has been known for a long time that hyperons produced in hadronic\ncollisions are polarized perpendicular to the production plane of the reaction.\nThis effect cannot be described by using twist-2 collinear parton correlators\nonly. Here we compute the contribution of twist-3 fragmentation functions to\nthe production of transversely polarized hyperons in unpolarized proton-proton\ncollisions in the framework of collinear factorization. By taking into account\nthe relations among the relevant twist-3 fragmentation functions which follow\nfrom the QCD equation of motion and the Lorentz invariance property of the\ncorrelators, we present the leading-order cross section for this term.\n", "  We analyze, through resonant photoluminescence, the spin dynamics of an\nindividual magnetic atom (Mn) coupled to a hole in a semiconductor quantum dot.\nThe hybrid Mn-hole spin and the positively charged exciton in a CdTe/ZnTe\nquantum dot forms an ensemble of $\\Lambda$ systems which can be addressed\noptically. Auto-correlation of the resonant photoluminescence and resonant\noptical pumping experiments are used to study the spin relaxation channels in\nthis multilevel spin system. We identified for the hybrid Mn-hole spin an\nefficient relaxation channel driven by the interplay of the Mn-hole exchange\ninteraction and the coupling to acoustic phonons. We also show that the optical\n$\\Lambda$ systems are connected through inefficient spin-flips than can be\nenhanced under weak transverse magnetic field. The dynamics of the resonant\nphotoluminescence in a p-doped magnetic quantum dot is well described by a\ncomplete rate equation model. Our results suggest that long lived hybrid\nMn-hole spin could be obtained in quantum dot systems with large\nheavy-hole/light-hole splitting.\n", "  The precession angular velocity of a gyroscope moving along a general\ngeodesic in the Kerr spacetime is analyzed using the geometric properties of\nthe spacetime. Natural frames along the gyroscope world line are explicitly\nconstructed by boosting frames adapted to fundamental observers. A novel\ngeometrical description is given to Marck's construction of a parallel\npropagated orthonormal frame along a general geodesic, identifying and\nclarifying the special role played by the Carter family of observers in this\ngeneral context, thus extending previous discussion for the equatorial plane\ncase.\n", "  A new type of gauged BPS baby Skyrme model is presented, where the derivative\nterm is just the Schroers current (i.e., gauge invariant and conserved version\nof the topological current) squared. This class of models has a topological\nbound saturated for solutions of the pertinent Bogomolnyi equations\nsupplemented by a so-called superpotential equation. In contrast to the gauged\nBPS baby Skyrme models considered previously, the superpotential equation is\nlinear and, hence, completely solvable. Furthermore, the magnetic flux is\nquantized in units of $2\\pi$, which allows, in principle, to define this theory\non a compact manifold without boundary, unlike all gauged baby Skyrme models\nconsidered so far.\n", "  We present a lattice quantum chromodynamics determination of the scalar and\nvector form factors for the $B_s \\rightarrow D_s \\ell \\nu$ decay over the full\nphysical range of momentum transfer. In conjunction with future experimental\ndata, our results will provide a new method to extract $|V_{cb}|$, which may\nelucidate the current tension between exclusive and inclusive determinations of\nthis parameter. Combining the form factor results at non-zero recoil with\nrecent HPQCD results for the $B \\rightarrow D \\ell \\nu$ form factors, we\ndetermine the ratios $f^{B_s \\rightarrow D_s}_0(M_\\pi^2) / f^{B \\rightarrow\nD}_0(M_K^2) = 1.000(62)$ and $f^{B_s \\rightarrow D_s}_0(M_\\pi^2) / f^{B\n\\rightarrow D}_0(M_\\pi^2) = 1.006(62)$. These results give the fragmentation\nfraction ratios $f_s/f_d =\n0.310(30)_{\\mathrm{stat.}}(21)_{\\mathrm{syst.}}(6)_{\\mathrm{theor.}}(38)_{\\mathrm{latt.}}\n$ and $f_s/f_d =\n0.307(16)_{\\mathrm{stat.}}(21)_{\\mathrm{syst.}}(23)_{\\mathrm{theor.}}(44)_{\\mathrm{latt.}}$,\nrespectively. The fragmentation fraction ratio is an important ingredient in\nexperimental determinations of $B_s$ meson branching fractions at hadron\ncolliders, in particular for the rare decay ${\\cal B}(B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+\n\\mu^-)$. In addition to the form factor results, we make the first prediction\nof the branching fraction ratio $R(D_s) = {\\cal B}(B_s\\to D_s\\tau\\nu)/{\\cal\nB}(B_s\\to D_s\\ell\\nu) = 0.301(6)$, where $\\ell$ is an electron or muon. Current\nexperimental measurements of the corresponding ratio for the semileptonic\ndecays of $B$ mesons disagree with Standard Model expectations at the level of\nnearly four standard deviations. Future experimental measurements of $R(D_s)$\nmay help understand this discrepancy.\n", "  We present an updated version of the mass--metallicity relation (MZR) using\nintegral field spectroscopy data obtained from 734 galaxies observed by the\nCALIFA survey. These unparalleled spatially resolved spectroscopic data allow\nus to determine the metallicity at the same physical scale ($\\mathrm{R_{e}}$)\nfor different calibrators. We obtain MZ relations with similar shapes for all\ncalibrators, once the scale factors among them are taken into account. We do\nnot find any significant secondary relation of the MZR with either the star\nformation rate (SFR) or the specific SFR for any of the calibrators used in\nthis study, based on the analysis of the residuals of the best fitted relation.\nHowever we do see a hint for a (s)SFR-dependent deviation of the MZ-relation at\nlow masses (M$<$10$^{9.5}$M$_\\odot$), where our sample is not complete. We are\nthus unable to confirm the results by Mannucci et al. (2010), although we\ncannot exclude that this result is due to the differences in the analysed\ndatasets. In contrast, our results are inconsistent with the results by\nLara-Lopez et al. (2010), and we can exclude the presence of a SFR-Mass-Oxygen\nabundance Fundamental Plane. These results agree with previous findings\nsuggesting that either (1) the secondary relation with the SFR could be induced\nby an aperture effect in single fiber/aperture spectroscopic surveys, (2) it\ncould be related to a local effect confined to the central regions of galaxies,\nor (3) it is just restricted to the low-mass regime, or a combination of the\nthree effects.\n", "  To constrain models of high-mass star formation, the Herschel/HOBYS KP aims\nat discovering massive dense cores (MDCs) able to host the high-mass analogs of\nlow-mass prestellar cores, which have been searched for over the past decade.\nWe here focus on NGC6334, one of the best-studied HOBYS molecular cloud\ncomplexes.\n  We used Herschel PACS and SPIRE 70-500mu images of the NGC6334 complex\ncomplemented with (sub)millimeter and mid-infrared data. We built a complete\nprocedure to extract ~0.1 pc dense cores with the getsources software, which\nsimultaneously measures their far-infrared to millimeter fluxes. We carefully\nestimated the temperatures and masses of these dense cores from their SEDs.\n  A cross-correlation with high-mass star formation signposts suggests a mass\nthreshold of 75Msun for MDCs in NGC6334. MDCs have temperatures of 9.5-40K,\nmasses of 75-1000Msun, and densities of 10^5-10^8cm-3. Their mid-IR emission is\nused to separate 6 IR-bright and 10 IR-quiet protostellar MDCs while their 70mu\nemission strength, with respect to fitted SEDs, helps identify 16 starless MDC\ncandidates. The ability of the latter to host high-mass prestellar cores is\ninvestigated here and remains questionable. An increase in mass and density\nfrom the starless to the IR-quiet and IR-bright phases suggests that the\nprotostars and MDCs simultaneously grow in mass. The statistical lifetimes of\nthe high-mass prestellar and protostellar core phases, estimated to be\n1-7x10^4yr and at most 3x10^5yr respectively, suggest a dynamical scenario of\nhigh-mass star formation.\n  The present study provides good mass estimates for a statistically\nsignificant sample, covering the earliest phases of high-mass star formation.\nHigh-mass prestellar cores may not exist in NGC6334, favoring a scenario\npresented here, which simultaneously forms clouds and high-mass protostars.\n", "  In this work we apply the stacking technique to estimate the average\nfractional polarisation from 30 to 353 GHz of a primary sample of 1560 compact\nsources - essentially all radio sources - detected in the 30 GHz Planck all-sky\nmap and listed in the second version of the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources\n(PCCS2). We divide our primary sample in two subsamples according to whether\nthe sources lay (679 sources) or not (881 sources) inside the sky region\ndefined by the Planck Galactic mask (fsky ~ 60 per cent) and the area around\nthe Magellanic Clouds. We find that the average fractional polarisation of\ncompact sources is approximately constant (with frequency) in both samples\n(with a weighted mean over all the channels of 3.08 per cent outside and 3.54\nper cent inside the Planck mask). In the sky region outside the adopted mask,\nwe also estimate the {\\mu} and {\\sigma} parameters for the log-normal\ndistribution of the fractional polarisation, finding a weighted mean value over\nall the Planck frequency range of 1.0 for {\\sigma} and 0.7 for {\\mu} (that\nwould imply a weighted mean value for the median fractional polarisation of 1.9\nper cent).\n", "  We analyze short cadence K2 light curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Fourier\nanalysis of the data suggests $P_\\mathrm{rot}=3.295\\pm0.003$ days. The light\ncurve shows several flares, of which we analyzed 42 events, these have\nintegrated flare energies of $1.26\\times10^{30}-1.24\\times10^{33}$ ergs.\nApproximately 12% of the flares were complex, multi-peaked eruptions. The\nflaring and the possible rotational modulation shows no obvious correlation.\nThe flaring activity of TRAPPIST-1 probably continuously alters the atmospheres\nof the orbiting exoplanets, making these less favorable for hosting life.\n", "  We report the discovery of the molecular cloud whose kinematic distance is\nthe largest in the Galaxy at the present moment, named G213.042$+$0.003, at $l\n=$ 213.042$^\\circ$ and $b =$ 0.003$^\\circ$ in the $^{12}$CO($J =$ 1-0) line\nusing the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and a multi-beam receiver BEARS. This\nmolecular cloud is located at the heliocentric distance of 21$_{-7}^{+12}$ kpc\nand Galactocentric distance of 29$_{-7}^{+12}$ kpc, which are estimated as the\nkinematic distances with the Galactic parameters obtained by Reid et al. (2014,\nApJ, 783, 130). Its major and minor diameters and line width were measured to\nbe 4.0$_{-1.3}^{+2.3}$ pc, 3.0$_{-1.0}^{+1.7}$ pc, and 1.5 km s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. The cloud mass was estimated to be 2.5$_{-1.4}^{+3.7}$ $\\times$\n10$^2$ $M_\\odot$ using the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of 5.6 $\\times$\n10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ obtained in far outer Galaxy.\n", "  Sub-subgiants are a new class of stars that are optically redder than normal\nmain-sequence stars and fainter than normal subgiant stars. Sub-subgiants, and\nthe possibly related red stragglers (which fall to the red of the giant\nbranch), occupy a region of the color-magnitude diagram that is predicted to be\ndevoid of stars by standard stellar evolution theory. In previous papers we\npresented the observed demographics of these sources and defined possible\ntheoretical formation channels through isolated binary evolution, the rapid\nstripping of a subgiant's envelope, and stellar collisions. Sub-subgiants offer\nkey tests for single- and binary-star evolution and stellar collision models.\nIn this paper, we synthesize these findings to discuss the formation\nfrequencies through each of these channels. The empirical data, our analytic\nformation rate calculations, and analyses of sub-subgiants in a large grid of\nMonte Carlo globular cluster models suggest that the binary evolution channels\nmay be the most prevalent, though all channels appear to be viable routes to\nsub-subgiant creation (especially in higher-mass globular clusters). Multiple\nformation channels may operate simultaneously to produce the observed\nsub-subgiant population. Finally, many of these formation pathways can produce\nstars in both the sub-subgiant and red straggler (and blue straggler) regions\nof the color-magnitude diagram, in some cases as different stages along the\nsame evolutionary sequence.\n", "  All four giant planets in the Solar System feature zonal flows on the order\nof 100 m/s in the cloud deck, and large-scale intrinsic magnetic fields on the\norder of 1 Gauss near the surface. The vertical structure of the zonal flows\nremains obscure. The end-member scenarios are shallow flows confined in the\nradiative atmosphere and deep flows throughout the entire planet. The\nelectrical conductivity increases rapidly yet smoothly as a function of depth\ninside Jupiter and Saturn. Deep zonal flows will inevitably interact with the\nmagnetic field, at depth with even modest electrical conductivity. Here we\ninvestigate the interaction between zonal flows and magnetic fields in the\nsemi-conducting region of giant planets. Employing mean-field electrodynamics,\nwe show that the interaction will generate detectable poloidal magnetic field\nperturbations spatially correlated with the deep zonal flows. Assuming the peak\namplitude of the dynamo alpha-effect to be 0.1 mm/s, deep zonal flows on the\norder of 0.1 - 1 m/s in the semi-conducting region of Jupiter and Saturn would\ngenerate poloidal magnetic perturbations on the order of 0.01% - 1% of the\nbackground dipole field. These poloidal perturbations should be detectable with\nthe in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Juno mission and the Cassini\nGrand Finale. This implies that magnetic field measurements can be employed to\nconstrain the properties of deep zonal flows in the semi-conducting region of\ngiant planets.\n", "  A previously unremarked star in the constellation Cygnus has,in the past\nyear,become known as the most mysterious star in our Galaxy.Boyajian's star\nexhibits puzzling episodes of sporadic deep dimming discovered in photometry\nwith the Kepler Mission. Proposed explanations have focused on its obscuration\nby colliding exoplanets, exocomets, and even intervention of alien\nintelligence. These hypotheses have considered only phenomena external to the\nstar because the radiative flux missing in the dimmings was believed to exceed\nthe star's storage capacity.We point out that modeling variations in solar\nluminosity indicates that convective stars can store the required fluxes. It\nalso suggests explanations for a reported time profile asymmetry of the\nshort,deep dimmings and for a slower,decadal scale dimming reported from\narchival and Kepler photometry. Our findings favor a broader range of\nexplanations of Boyajian's star, that may produce new insights into stellar\nmagnetoconvection.\n", "  Massive stars play a significant role in the chemical and dynamical evolution\nof galaxies. However, much of their variability, particularly during their\nevolved supergiant stage, is poorly understood. To understand the variability\nof evolved massive stars in more detail, we present a study of the O9.2Ib\nsupergiant $\\zeta$ Ori Aa, the only currently confirmed supergiant to host a\nmagnetic field. We have obtained two-color space-based BRIght Target Explorer\nphotometry (BRITE) for $\\zeta$ Ori Aa during two observing campaigns, as well\nas simultaneous ground-based, high-resolution optical CHIRON spectroscopy. We\nperform a detailed frequency analysis to detect and characterize the star's\nperiodic variability. We detect two significant, independent frequencies, their\nhigher harmonics, and combination frequencies: the stellar rotation period\n$P_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 6.82\\pm0.18$ d, most likely related to the presence of the\nstable magnetic poles, and a variation with a period of $10.0\\pm0.3$ d\nattributed to circumstellar environment, also detected in the H$\\alpha$ and\nseveral He I lines, yet absent in the purely photospheric lines. We confirm the\nvariability with $P_{\\mathrm{rot}}$/4, likely caused by surface\ninhomogeneities, being the possible photospheric drivers of the discrete\nabsorption components. No stellar pulsations were detected in the data. The\nlevel of circumstellar activity clearly differs between the two BRITE observing\ncampaigns. We demonstrate that $\\zeta$ Ori Aa is a highly variable star with\nboth periodic and non-periodic variations, as well as episodic events. The\nrotation period we determined agrees well with the spectropolarimetric value\nfrom the literature. The changing activity level observed with BRITE could\nexplain why the rotational modulation of the magnetic measurements was not\nclearly detected at all epochs.\n", "  We employ the very large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation BLUETIDES to\ninvestigate the predicted properties of the galaxy population during the epoch\nof reionisation ($z>8$). BLUETIDES has a resolution and volume ($(400/h\\approx\n577)^{3}\\,{\\rm cMpc^3}$) providing a population of galaxies which is well\nmatched to depth and area of current observational surveys targeting the\nhigh-redshift Universe. At $z=8$ BLUETIDES includes almost 160,000 galaxies\nwith stellar masses $>10^{8}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. The population of galaxies\npredicted by BLUETIDES closely matches observational constraints on both the\ngalaxy stellar mass function and far-UV ($150\\,{\\rm nm}$) luminosity function.\nGalaxies in BLUETIDES are characterised by rapidly increasing star formation\nhistories. Specific star formation rates decrease with redshift though remain\nlargely insensitive to stellar mass. As a result of the enhanced surface\ndensity of metals more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust\nattenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV\nluminosity function at high luminosities. The contribution of active SMBHs to\nthe UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses $10^{9-10}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$ is around $3\\%$ on average. Approximately $25\\%$ of galaxies with\n$M_{*}\\approx 10^{10}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ are predicted to have active SMBH which\ncontribute $>10\\%$ of the total UV luminosity.\n", "  The Daya Bay experiment has observed correlations between reactor core fuel\nevolution and changes in the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum.\nFour antineutrino detectors in two experimental halls were used to identify 2.2\nmillion inverse beta decays (IBDs) over 1230 days spanning multiple fuel cycles\nfor each of six 2.9 GW$_{\\textrm{th}}$ reactor cores at the Daya Bay and Ling\nAo nuclear power plants. Using detector data spanning effective $^{239}$Pu\nfission fractions, $F_{239}$, from 0.25 to 0.35, Daya Bay measures an average\nIBD yield, $\\bar{\\sigma}_f$, of $(5.90 \\pm 0.13) \\times 10^{-43}$\ncm$^2$/fission and a fuel-dependent variation in the IBD yield,\n$d\\sigma_f/dF_{239}$, of $(-1.86 \\pm 0.18) \\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$/fission.\nThis observation rejects the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino flux as a\nfunction of the $^{239}$Pu fission fraction at 10 standard deviations. The\nvariation in IBD yield was found to be energy-dependent, rejecting the\nhypothesis of a constant antineutrino energy spectrum at 5.1 standard\ndeviations. While measurements of the evolution in the IBD spectrum show\ngeneral agreement with predictions from recent reactor models, the measured\nevolution in total IBD yield disagrees with recent predictions at 3.1$\\sigma$.\nThis discrepancy indicates that an overall deficit in measured flux with\nrespect to predictions does not result from equal fractional deficits from the\nprimary fission isotopes $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{238}$U, and $^{241}$Pu.\nBased on measured IBD yield variations, yields of $(6.17 \\pm 0.17)$ and $(4.27\n\\pm 0.26) \\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$/fission have been determined for the two\ndominant fission parent isotopes $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu. A 7.8% discrepancy\nbetween the observed and predicted $^{235}$U yield suggests that this isotope\nmay be the primary contributor to the reactor antineutrino anomaly.\n", "  We study the two-body scattering problem in the zero-range approximation with\na sinusoidally driven scattering length and calculate the relation between the\nmean value and amplitude of the drive for which the effective scattering\namplitude is resonantly enhanced. In this manner we arrive at a family of\ncurves along which the effective scattering length diverges but the nature of\nthe corresponding Floquet-induced resonance changes from narrow to wide.\nRemarkably, on these curves the driving does not induce heating. In order to\nstudy the effect of these resonances on the three-body problem we consider one\nlight and two heavy particles with driven heavy-light interaction in the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation and find that the Floquet driving can be used to\ntune the three-body and inelasticity parameters.\n", "  We study the interaction between stellar irradiation and tidal heating in\ngaseous planets with short orbital periods. The intentionally simplified\natmospheric model we employ makes the problem analytically tractable and\npermits the derivation of useful scaling relations. We show that many tidal\nmodels provide thermal feedback, producing interior radiative zones and leading\nto enhanced g-mode dissipation with a wide spectrum of resonances. These\nresonances are dynamically tuned by the thermal feedback, and so represent a\nnovel form of thermomechanical feedback, coupling vibrational modes to the very\nslow thermal evolution of the planet. We then show that stellar irradiation\nallows the heat produced by these modes to be trapped at depth with high\nefficiency, leading to entropy increase in the central convective region, as\nwell as expansion of the planet's radius sufficient to match observed swelling.\nWe find that thermally driven winds play an essential role in this process by\nmaking the thermal structure of the atmosphere spherically symmetric within a\nfew scale heights of the photosphere. We characterise the relationship between\nthe swelling factor, the orbital period and the host star and determine the\ntimescale for swelling. We show that these g-modes suffice to produce bloating\non the order of the radius of the planet over $\\mathrm{Gyr}$ timescales when\ncombined with significant insolation and we provide analytic relations for the\nrelative magnitudes of tidal heating and insolation.\n", "  We explore the possibility that the observed population of Galactic\nhypervelocity stars (HVSs) originate as runaway stars from the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC). Pairing a binary evolution code with an N-body simulation of the\ninteraction of the LMC with the Milky Way, we predict the spatial distribution\nand kinematics of an LMC runaway population. We find that runaway stars from\nthe LMC can contribute Galactic HVSs at a rate of $3 \\times\n10^{-6}\\;\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is composed of stars at different points of\nstellar evolution, ranging from the main-sequence to those at the tip of the\nasymptotic giant branch. We find that the known B-type HVSs have kinematics\nwhich are consistent with an LMC origin. There is an additional population of\nhypervelocity white dwarfs whose progenitors were massive runaway stars.\nRunaways which are even more massive will themselves go supernova, producing a\nremnant whose velocity will be modulated by a supernova kick. This latter\nscenario has some exotic consequences, such as pulsars and supernovae far from\nstar-forming regions, and a small rate of microlensing from compact sources\naround the halo of the LMC.\n", "  We analyze the density dependence of the contribution of meson-exchange\ncurrents to the lepton-nucleus inclusive cross section in the two-particle\ntwo-hole channel. The model is based on the Relativistic Fermi Gas, where each\nnucleus is characterized by its Fermi momentum $k_F$. We find that the 2p-2h\nnuclear response functions at their peaks scale as $A k_F^2$ for Fermi momentum\ngoing from 200 to 300 MeV/c and momentum transfer $q$ from $2k_F$ to 2 GeV/c.\nThis behavior is different from what is found for the quasielastic response,\nwhich scales as $A/k_F$. Additionally, the deep scaling region is also\ndiscussed and there the usual scaling behavior is found to be preferable.\n", "  Equal volume mixtures of small and large polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)\nspheres are shaken in an atmosphere of controlled humidity which allows to also\ncontrol their tribo-charging. We find that the contact numbers are\ncharge-dependent: as the charge density of the beads increases, the number of\nsame-type contacts decreases and the number of opposite-type contacts\nincreases. This change is not caused by a global segregation of the sample.\nHence, tribo-charging can be a way to tune the local composition of a granular\nmaterial.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae are found in regions associated with recent massive\nstar formation. The stellar population observed around the location of a SN can\nbe used as a probe of the origins of the progenitor star. We apply a Bayesian\nmixture model to fit isochrones to the massive star population around twelve\nType IIP SNe, for which constraints on the progenitors are also available from\nfortuitous pre-explosion images. Using the high-resolution Hubble Space\nTelescope Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3, we study the\nmassive star population found within 100pc of each our target SNe. For most of\nthe SNe in our sample, we find that there are multiple age components in the\nsurrounding stellar populations. In the cases of SNe~2003gd and 2005cs, we find\nthat the progenitor does not come from the youngest stellar population\ncomponent and, in fact, these relatively low mass progenitors ($\\sim\n8M_{\\odot}$) are found in close proximity to stars as massive as $15$ and\n$50-60M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Overall, the field extinction (Galactic and\nhost) derived for these populations is $\\sim 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mags}$ higher than\nthe extinction that was generally applied in previously reported progenitor\nanalyses. We also find evidence, in particular for SN~2004dj, for significant\nlevels of differential extinction. Our analysis for SN~2008bk suggests a\nsignificantly lower extinction for the population than the progenitor, but the\nlifetime of the population and mass determined from pre-explosion images agree.\nOverall, assuming that the appropriate age component can be suitably identified\nfrom the multiple stellar population components present, we find that our\nBayesian approach to studying resolved stellar populations can match progenitor\nmasses determined from direct imaging to within $\\pm 3M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We present the first data release of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)\nPlane Survey (JPS), the JPS Public Release 1 (JPSPR1). JPS is an 850-um\ncontinuum survey of six fields in the northern inner Galactic Plane in a\nlongitude range of l=7-63, made with the Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer\nArray 2 (SCUBA-2). This first data release consists of emission maps of the six\nJPS regions with an average pixel-to-pixel noise of 7.19 mJy beam^-1, when\nsmoothed over the beam, and a compact-source catalogue containing 7,813\nsources. The 95 per cent completeness limits of the catalogue are estimated at\n0.04 Jy beam^-1 and 0.3 Jy for the peak and integrated flux densities,\nrespectively. The emission contained in the compact-source catalogue is 42 +- 5\nper cent of the total and, apart from the large-scale (greater than 8')\nemission, there is excellent correspondence with features in the 500-um\nHerschel maps. We find that, with two-dimensional matching, 98 +- 2 per cent of\nsources within the fields centred at l=20, 30, 40 and 50 are associated with\nmolecular clouds, with 91 +- 3 per cent of the l=30 and 40 sources associated\nwith dense molecular clumps. Matching the JPS catalogue to Herschel 70-um\nsources, we find that 38 +- 1 per cent of sources show evidence of ongoing star\nformation. The images and catalogue will be a valuable resource for studies of\nstar formation in the Galaxy and the role of environment and spiral arms in the\nstar formation process.\n", "  In this paper we study quantum radiation from an evaporating spherically\nsymmetric non-singular black hole. We used a modified Hayward metric for a\ndescription of a non-singular black hole. We assume that the mass parameter of\nthis metric depends on the advanced time, and choose this dependence so that it\nproperly reproduces both black hole formation and its subsequent evaporation.\nWe consider a quantum massless scalar field propagating in this geometry and\nuse 2D approximation for the calculation of the quantum average of the\nstress-energy tensor. For the calculation of this quantity it is sufficient to\nfind a map between the Killing times $u_+$ and $u_-$ at the future and past\nnull infinities, established by the propagation of the radial null rays. In\nthis formalism the quantum energy flux at the future null infinity can be\nexpressed in terms of the function $u_+(u_-)$ and its derivatives. We developed\na special formalism, which allows one to reduce the problem of the calculation\nof the quantum energy flux and other observables to a solution of a simple set\nof ordinary differential equations. We used this approach to study quantum\neffects in two cases: i) with the trivial, $\\alpha=1$ and ii) the non-trivial,\n$\\alpha\\ne1$, redshift function. In both cases there exists an outburst of the\nquantum energy radiation from the inner domain of the black hole, close to the\ninner part of its apparent horizon. For $\\alpha=1$ this outburst is\nexponentially large. It is a direct consequence of the so-called mass inflation\neffect. We showed, that this severe problem can be solved by a proper choice of\nthe redshift function. However, even in this case the emitted energy can be\nmuch larger than the initial mass of the evaporating black hole. This means\nthat for a construction of a self-consistent model of a non-singular\nevaporating black hole the back-reaction effects are highly important.\n", "  Non-Abelian flux tubes (strings) are well studied in N=2 supersymmetric QCD\nin (3+1) dimensions. In addition to translational zero modes they have also\norientational moduli associated with rotations of their fluxes inside a\nnon-Abelian group. The dynamics of the orientational moduli is described by the\ntwo dimensional CP(N-1) model living on the world sheet of the non-Abelian\nstring. In this paper we consider a deformation of N=2 supersymmetric QCD with\nthe U(N) gauge group and N_f=N quark flavors with a mass term $\\mu$ of the\nadjoint matter. In the limit of large $\\mu$ the theory flows to an N=1\nsupersymmetric QCD. We study the solution for the non-Abelian string in this\nlimit and derive an effective theory on the string world sheet. The bosonic\nsector of this theory is still given by the CP(N-1) model but its scale is\nexponentially small as compared to the scale of the four dimensional bulk\ntheory in contrast to the N=2 case where these scales are equal. We study also\nthe fermionic sector of the world sheet theory. Upon the deformation the\nnon-Abelian string is no longer BPS and we show that the fermionic\nsuperorientational zero modes are all lifted. This leaves us with the pure\nbosonic CP(N-1) model on the string world sheet in the limit of N=1 QCD. We\nalso discuss what happens to confined monopoles at large $\\mu$.\n", "  Observations of the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths offer a\nunique probe into the structure, dynamics, and heating of the chromosphere; the\nstructure of sunspots; the formation and eruption of prominences and filaments;\nand energetic phenomena such as jets and flares. High-resolution observations\nof the Sun at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are challenging due to\nthe intense, extended, low- contrast, and dynamic nature of emission from the\nquiet Sun, and the extremely intense and variable nature of emissions\nassociated with energetic phenomena. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) was designed with solar observations in mind. The requirements for\nsolar observations are significantly different from observations of sidereal\nsources and special measures are necessary to successfully carry out this type\nof observations. We describe the commissioning efforts that enable the use of\ntwo frequency bands, the 3 mm band (Band 3) and the 1.25 mm band (Band 6), for\ncontinuum interferometric-imaging observations of the Sun with ALMA. Examples\nof high-resolution synthesized images obtained using the newly commissioned\nmodes during the solar commissioning campaign held in December 2015 are\npresented. Although only 30 of the eventual 66 ALMA antennas were used for the\ncampaign, the solar images synthesized from the ALMA commissioning data reveal\nnew features of the solar atmosphere that demonstrate the potential power of\nALMA solar observations. The ongoing expansion of ALMA and solar-commissioning\nefforts will continue to enable new and unique solar observing capabilities.\n", "  Recently revealed differences in planets around M dwarf vs. solar-type stars\ncould arise from differences in their primordial disks, and surveys of T Tauri\nstars find a correlation between stellar mass and disk mass. \"Minimum\" disks\nhave been reconstructed for the Solar System and solar-type stars and here this\nexercise is performed for M dwarfs using Kepler-detected planets. Distribution\nof planet mass between current orbits produces a disk with total mass of\n~0.009Msun and a power-law profile with index 2.2. Disk reconstruction from the\noutput of a forward model of planet formation indicates that the effect of\ndetection bias on disk profile is slight and that the observed scatter in\nplanet masses and semi-major axes is consistent with a universal disk profile.\nThis nominal M dwarf disk is more centrally concentrated than those inferred\naround the solar-type stars observed by Kepler, and the mass surface density\nbeyond 0.02 AU is sufficient for in situ accretion of planets as single\nembryos. The mass of refractory solids within 0.5 AU is 5.6Mearth compared to\n4Mearth for solar-type stars, in contrast with the trend with total disk mass.\nThe total solids beyond 0.5 AU is sufficient for the core of at least one giant\nplanet.\n", "  The inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way harbours gas densities,\npressures, velocity dispersions, an interstellar radiation field and a cosmic\nray ionisation rate orders of magnitude higher than the disc; akin to the\nenvironment found in star-forming galaxies at high-redshift. Previous studies\nhave shown that this region is forming stars at a rate per unit mass of dense\ngas which is at least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc, potentially\nviolating theoretical predictions. We show that all observational star\nformation rate diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar objects and\nintegrated light measurements - are in agreement within a factor two, hence the\nlow star formation rate is not the result of the systematic uncertainties that\naffect any one method. As these methods trace the star formation over different\ntimescales, from $0.1 - 5$ Myr, we conclude that the star formation rate has\nbeen constant to within a factor of a few within this time period. We\ninvestigate the progression of star formation within gravitationally bound\nclouds on $\\sim$ parsec scales and find $1 - 4$ per cent of the cloud masses\nare converted into stars per free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the\nconsidered \"volumetric\" star formation models. However, discriminating between\nthese models is obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input\nobservables and, most importantly and urgently, by their dependence on\nill-constrained free parameters. The lack of empirical constraints on these\nparameters therefore represents a key challenge in the further verification or\nfalsification of current star formation theories.\n", "  We reinvestigate the recently discovered bifurcation phase transition in\nCausal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) and provide further evidence that it is a\nhigher order transition. We also investigate the impact of introducing matter\nin the form of massless scalar fields to CDT. We discuss the impact of scalar\nfields on the measured spatial volumes and fluctuation profiles in addition to\nanalysing how the scalar fields influence the position of the bifurcation\ntransition.\n", "  Galaxy groups and clusters are the main tools used to test cosmological\nmodels and to study the environmental effect of galaxy formation. This work\nprovides a catalogue of galaxy groups and clusters, as well as potentially\nmerging systems based on the SDSS main galaxy survey. We identified galaxy\ngroups and clusters using the modified friends-of-friends (FoF) group finder\ndesigned specifically for flux-limited galaxy surveys. The FoF group membership\nis refined by multimodality analysis to find subgroups and by using the group\nvirial radius and escape velocity to expose unbound galaxies. We look for\nmerging systems by comparing distances between group centres with group radii.\n  The analysis results in a catalogue of 88662 galaxy groups with at least two\nmembers. Among them are 6873 systems with at least six members which we\nconsider to be more reliable groups. We find 498 group mergers with up to six\ngroups. We performed a brief comparison with some known clusters in the nearby\nUniverse, including the Coma cluster and Abell 1750. The Coma cluster in our\ncatalogue is a merging system with six distinguishable subcomponents. In the\ncase of Abell 1750 we find a clear sign of filamentary infall toward this\ncluster. Our analysis of mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of galaxy groups reveals\nthat M/L slightly increases with group richness.\n", "  [abridged] In the typical giant-impact scenario for the Moon formation most\nof the Moon's material originates from the impactor. Any Earth-impactor\ncomposition difference should, therefore, correspond to a comparable Earth-Moon\ncomposition difference. Analysis of Moon rocks shows a close Earth-Moon\ncomposition similarity, posing a challenge for the giant-impact scenario, given\nthat impactors were thought to significantly differ in composition from the\nplanets they impact. Here we use a large set of 140 simulations to show that\nthe composition of impactors could be very similar to that of the planets they\nimpact; in $4.9\\%$-$18.2\\%$ ($1.9\\%$-$6.7\\%$) of the cases the resulting\ncomposition of the Moon is consistent with the observations of\n$\\Delta^{17}O<15$ ($\\Delta^{17}O<6$ ppm). These findings suggest that the\nEarth-Moon composition similarity could be resolved as to arise from the\nprimordial Earth-impactor composition similarity. Note that although we find\nthe likelihood for the suggested competing model of very high mass-ratio\nimpacts (producing significant Earth-impactor composition mixing) is comparable\n($<6.7\\%$), this scenario also requires additional fine-tuned requirements of a\nvery fast spinning Earth. Using the same simulations we also explore the\ncomposition of giant-impact formed Mars-moons as well as Vesta-like asteroids.\nWe find that the Mars-moon composition difference should be large, but smaller\nthan expected if the moons are captured asteroids. Finally, we find that the\nleft-over planetesimals ('asteroids') in our simulations are frequently\nscattered far away from their initial positions, thus potentially explaining\nthe mismatch between the current position and composition of the Vesta\nasteroid.\n", "  The assessment of the relationship between radio continuum luminosity and\nstar formation rate (SFR) is of crucial importance to make reliable predictions\nfor the forthcoming ultra-deep radio surveys and to allow a full exploitation\nof their results to measure the cosmic star formation history. We have\naddressed this issue by matching recent accurate determinations of the SFR\nfunction up to high redshifts with literature estimates of the 1.4 GHz\nluminosity functions of star forming galaxies (SFGs). This was done considering\ntwo options, proposed in the literature, for the relationship between the\nsynchrotron emission ($L_{\\rm synch}$), that dominates at 1.4 GHz, and the SFR:\na linear relation with a decline of the $L_{\\rm synch}$/SFR ratio at low\nluminosities or a mildly non-linear relation at all luminosities. In both cases\nwe get good agreement with the observed radio luminosity functions but, in the\nnon-linear case, the deviation from linearity must be small. The luminosity\nfunction data are consistent with a moderate increase of the $L_{\\rm\nsynch}$/SFR ratio with increasing redshift, indicated by other data sets,\nalthough a constant ratio cannot be ruled out. A stronger indication of such\nincrease is provided by recent deep 1.4 GHz counts, down to $\\mu$Jy levels.\nThis is in contradiction with models predicting a decrease of that ratio due to\ninverse Compton cooling of relativistic electrons at high redshifts.\nSynchrotron losses appear to dominate up to $z\\simeq 5$. We have also updated\nthe Massardi et al. (2010) evolutionary model for radio loud AGNs.\n", "  We propose a new methodology aimed at finding star-forming galaxies in the\nphase which immediately follows the star-formation (SF) quenching, based on the\nuse of high- to low-ionization emission line ratios. These ratios rapidly\ndisappear after the SF halt, due to the softening of the UV ionizing radiation.\nWe focus on [O III] $\\lambda$5007/H$\\alpha$ and [Ne III] $\\lambda$3869/[O II]\n$\\lambda$3727, studying them with simulations obtained with the CLOUDY\nphotoionization code. If a sharp quenching is assumed, we find that the two\nratios are very sensitive tracers as they drop by a factor $\\sim$ 10 within\n$\\sim$ 10 Myr from the interruption of the SF; instead, if a smoother and\nslower SF decline is assumed (i.e. an exponentially declining star-formation\nhistory with $e$-folding time $\\tau=$ 200 Myr), they decrease by a factor\n$\\sim$ 2 within $\\sim$ 80 Myr. We mitigate the ionization -- metallicity\ndegeneracy affecting our methodology using pairs of emission line ratios\nseparately related to metallicity and ionization, adopting the [N II]\n$\\lambda$6584/[O II] $\\lambda$3727 ratio as metallicity diagnostic. Using a\nSloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, we identify 10 examples among the most\nextreme quenching candidates within the [O III] $\\lambda$5007/H$\\alpha$ vs. [N\nII] $\\lambda$6584/[O II] $\\lambda$3727 plane, characterized by low [O III]\n$\\lambda$5007/H$\\alpha$, faint [Ne III] $\\lambda$3869, and by blue\ndust-corrected spectra and $(u-r)$ colours, as expected if the SF quenching has\noccurred in the very recent past. Our results also suggest that the observed\nfractions of quenching candidates can be used to constrain the quenching\nmechanism at work and its time-scales.\n", "  We present clustering analyses of identically-selected star-forming galaxies\nin 3 narrow redshift slices (at z=0.8, z=1.47 and z=2.23), from HiZELS, a deep,\nnear-infrared narrow-band survey. The HiZELS samples span the peak in the\ncosmic star-formation rate density, identifying typical star-forming galaxies\nat each epoch. Narrow-band samples have well-defined redshift distributions and\nare therefore ideal for clustering analyses. We quantify the clustering of the\nthree samples, and of H-alpha luminosity-selected subsamples, initially using\nsimple power law fits to the two-point correlation function. We extend this\nwork to link the evolution of star-forming galaxies and their host dark matter\nhalos over cosmic time using sophisticated dark matter halo models. We find\nthat the clustering strength, r0, and the bias of galaxy populations relative\nto the clustering of dark matter increase linearly with H-alpha luminosity\n(and, by implication, star-formation rate) at all three redshifts, as do the\nhost dark matter halo masses of the HiZELS galaxies. The typical galaxies in\nour samples are star-forming centrals, residing in halos of mass M_halo ~ a few\ntimes 10^12M_solar. We find a remarkably tight redshift-independent relation\nbetween the H-alpha luminosity scaled by the characteristic luminosity,\nL(H-alpha)/L(H-alpha)*(z), and the minimum host dark matter halo mass of\ncentral galaxies. This reveals that the dark matter halo environment is a\nstrong driver of galaxy star-formation rate and therefore of the evolution of\nthe star-formation rate density in the Universe.\n", "  We present ALMA and ATCA observations of the luminous blue variable \\rmc. The\nradio maps show for the first time the core of the nebula and evidence that the\nnebula is strongly asymmetric with a Z-pattern shape. Hints of this morphology\nare also visible in the archival \\emph{HST} $\\rm H\\alpha$ image, which overall\nresembles the radio emission. The emission mechanism in the outer nebula is\noptically thin free-free in the radio. At high frequencies, a component of\npoint-source emission appears at the position of the star, up to the ALMA\nfrequencies. The rising flux density distribution ($S_{\\nu}\\sim\n\\nu^{0.78\\pm0.05}$) of this object suggests thermal emission from the ionized\nstellar wind and indicates a departure from spherical symmetry with\n$n_{e}(r)\\propto r^{-2}$. We examine different scenarios to explain this excess\nof thermal emission from the wind and show that this can arise from a bipolar\noutflow, supporting the suggestion by other authors that the stellar wind of\n\\rmc is aspherical. We fit the data with two collimated ionized wind models and\nwe find that the mass-loss rate can be a factor of two or more smaller than in\nthe spherical case. We also fit the photometry obtained by IR space telescopes\nand deduce that the mid- to far-IR emission must arise from extended, cool\n($\\sim80\\,\\rm K$) dust within the outer ionized nebula. Finally we discuss two\npossible scenarios for the nebular morphology: the canonical single star\nexpanding shell geometry, and a precessing jet model assuming presence of a\ncompanion star.\n", "  By choosing an appropriate vielbein basis, we obtain a class of\nspherically-symmetric solutions in $f(T)$ gravities. The solutions are\nasymptotic to Minkowski spacetimes with leading falloffs the same as those of\nthe Schwarzschild black hole. In general, these solutions have branch-cut\nsingularities in the middle. For appropriately chosen $f(T)$ functions,\nextremal black holes can also emerge. Furthermore, we obtain wormhole\nconfigurations whose spatial section is analogous to an Ellis wormhole, but\n$-g_{tt}$ runs from 0 to 1 as the proper radial coordinate runs from $-\\infty$\nto $+\\infty$. Thus a signal sent from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ through the\nwormhole will be infinitely red-shifted. We call such a spacetime configuration\na dark wormhole. By introducing a bare cosmological constant $\\Lambda_0$, we\nconstruct smooth solitons that are asymptotic to local AdS with an effective\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm eff}$. In the middle of bulk, the soliton metric behaves like the\nAdS of bare $\\Lambda_0$ in global coordinates. We also embed AdS planar and\nLifshitz black holes in $f(T)$ gravities. Finally we couple the Maxwell field\nto the $f(T)$ theories and construct electrically-charged solutions.\n", "  Low- and intermediate mass galaxies are widely discussed as cause of\nreionization at redshift $z\\sim10-6$. However, observational proof of galaxies\nthat are leaking ionizing radiation (Lyman continuum; LyC) is a currently\nongoing challenge and the list of LyC emitting candidates is still short.\nTololo 1247-232 is among those very few galaxies with recently reported\nleakage. We performed intermediate resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy\nwith the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope\nand confirm ionizing radiation emerging from Tololo 1247-232. Adopting an\nimproved data reduction procedure, we find that LyC escapes from the central\nstellar clusters, with an escape fraction of 1.5$\\pm$0.5% only, i.e. the lowest\nvalue reported for the galaxy so far. We further make use of FUV absorption\nlines of Si II and Si IV as a probe of the neutral and ionized interstellar\nmedium. We find that most of the ISM gas is ionized, likely facilitating LyC\nescape from density bounded regions. Neutral gas covering as a function of\nline-of-sight velocity is derived using the apparent optical depth method. The\nISM is found to be sufficiently clumpy, supporting the direct escape of LyC\nphotons. We further report on broadband UV and optical continuum imaging as\nwell as narrowband imaging of Ly$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$. Using stellar\npopulation synthesis, a Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction of 8% was derived. We also\nperformed VLA 21cm imaging. The hydrogen hyperfine transition was not detected,\nbut a deep upper limit atomic gas mass of $\\lesssim10^9 M_{\\odot}$ could be\nderived. The upper limit gas fraction defined as $\\frac{M_{H I}}{M_*}$ is only\n20%. Evidence is found that the H I gas halo is relatively small compared to\nother Lyman Alpha emitters.\n", "  We present the near-infrared high resolution imaging of an extremely dense\ngroup of galaxies at the core of the protocluster at $z=3.09$ in the SSA22\nfield by using the adaptive optics AO188 and the Infrared Camera and\nSpectrograph (IRCS) on Subaru Telescope. Wide morphological variety of them\nsuggests their on-going dramatic evolutions. One of the two quiescent galaxies\n(QGs), the most massive one in the group, is a compact elliptical with an\neffective radius $r_{e} = 1.37\\pm0.75$ kpc. It supports the two-phase formation\nscenario of giant ellipticals today that a massive compact elliptical is formed\nat once and evolves in the size and stellar mass by series of mergers. Since\nthis object is a plausible progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of\none of the most massive clusters today, it requires strong size ($\\ga10$) and\nstellar mass ($\\sim$ four times by $z=0$) growths. Another QG hosts an AGN(s)\nand is fitted with a model composed from an nuclear component and S\\'ersic\nmodel. It shows spatially extended [O{\\footnotesize III}]$\\lambda$5007 emission\nline compared to the continuum emission, a plausible evidence of outflows.\nMassive star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the group are two to three times larger\nthan the field SFGs at similar redshift. Although we obtained the $K$-band\nimage deeper than the previous one, we found no candidate new members. This\nimplies a physical deficiency of low mass galaxies with stellar mass\n$M_{\\star}\\la4\\times10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$ and/or poor detection completeness of\nthem owing to their diffuse morphologies.\n", "  We consider a five dimensional AdS warped spacetime in presence of a massive\nscalar field in the bulk. The scalar field potential fulfills the requirement\nof modulus stabilization even when the effect of backreaction of the\nstabilizing field is taken into account. In such a scenario, we explore the\nrole of backreaction on the localization of bulk fermions which in turn\ndetermines the effective radion-fermion coupling on the brane. Our result\nreveals that both the chiral modes of the zeroth Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermions get\nlocalized near TeV brane as the backreaction of the scalar field increases. We\nalso show that the profile of massive KK fermions shifts towards the Planck\nbrane with increasing backreaction parameter.\n", "  We explore the possibility of formation of steady internal shocks in jets\naround black holes. We consider a fluid described by a relativistic equation of\nstate, flowing about the axis of symmetry ($\\theta=0$) in a Schwarzschild\nmetric. We use two models for the jet geometry, (i) a conical geometry and (ii)\na geometry with non-conical cross-section. Jet with conical geometry is smooth\nflow. While the jet with non-conical cross section undergoes multiple sonic\npoint and even standing shock. The jet shock becomes stronger, as the shock\nlocation is situated further from the central black hole. Jets with very high\nenergy and very low energy do not harbour shocks, but jets with intermediate\nenergies do harbour shocks. One advantage of these shocks, as opposed to shocks\nmediated by external medium is that, these shocks have no effect on the jet\nterminal speed, but may act as possible sites for particle acceleration.\nTypically, a jet with energy $1.8~c^2$, will achieve a terminal speed of\n$v_\\infty=0.813c$ for jet with any geometry. But for a jet of non-conical\ncross-section for which the length scale of the inner torus of the accretion\ndisc is $40\\rg$, then in addition, a steady shock will form at $\\rsh \\sim\n7.5\\rg$ and compression ratio of $R\\sim 2.7$. Moreover, electron-proton jet\nseems to harbour the strongest shock. We discuss possible consequences of such\na scenario.\n", "  We present a study of the low-frequency radio properties of star forming (SF)\ngalaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) up to redshift $z=2.5$. The new\nspectral window probed by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) allows us to\nreconstruct the radio continuum emission from 150 MHz to 1.4 GHz to an\nunprecedented depth for a radio-selected sample of $1542$ galaxies in $\\sim 7~\n\\rm{deg}^2$ of the LOFAR Bo\\\"otes field. Using the extensive multi-wavelength\ndataset available in Bo\\\"otes and detailed modelling of the FIR to UV spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), we are able to separate the star-formation (N=758)\nand the AGN (N=784) dominated populations. We study the shape of the radio SEDs\nand their evolution across cosmic time and find significant differences in the\nspectral curvature between the SF galaxy and AGN populations. While the radio\nspectra of SF galaxies exhibit a weak but statistically significant flattening,\nAGN SEDs show a clear trend to become steeper towards lower frequencies. No\nevolution of the spectral curvature as a function of redshift is found for SF\ngalaxies or AGN. We investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio\ncorrelation (IRC) for SF galaxies and find that the ratio of total infrared to\n1.4 GHz radio luminosities decreases with increasing redshift: $ q_{\\rm 1.4GHz}\n= (2.45 \\pm 0.04) \\times (1+z)^{-0.15 \\pm 0.03} $. Similarly, $q_{\\rm 150MHz}$\nshows a redshift evolution following $ q_{\\rm 150GHz} = (1.72 \\pm 0.04) \\times\n(1+z)^{-0.22 \\pm 0.05}$. Calibration of the 150 MHz radio luminosity as a star\nformation rate tracer suggests that a single power-law extrapolation from\n$q_{\\rm 1.4GHz}$ is not an accurate approximation at all redshifts.\n", "  We present optical spectropolarimetry and spectroscopy of the broad-lined\nType Ic (Ic-bl) SN 2014ad. Our spectropolarimetric observations cover 7 epochs,\nfrom -2 days to 66 days after V-band maximum, and the spectroscopic data were\nacquired from -2 days to +107 days. The photospheric velocity estimates showed\nejecta speeds similar to those of SN 1998bw and other SNe associated with GRBs.\nThe spectropolarimetric data revealed aspherical outer ejecta and a nearly\nspherical interior. The polarisation associated with O I {\\lambda}7774 and the\nCa II infrared triplet suggests a clumpy and highly asymmetrical distribution\nof these two species within the ejecta. Furthermore it was shown that the two\nline forming regions must have been spatially distinct and oxygen was found to\nhave higher velocities than calcium. Another oxygen line-forming region was\nalso identified much closer to the core of the explosion and distributed in a\nspherical shell. It is difficult to reconcile the geometry of the deeper ejecta\nwith a jet driven explosion, but the high ejecta velocities of SN 2014ad are\ntypical of those observed in SNe Ic-bl with GRBs, and the behaviour of the\noxygen and calcium line-forming regions is consistent with fully jet-driven\nmodels. The metallicity of the host galaxy of SN 2014ad was also calculated and\ncompared to that of the hosts of other SNe Ic-bl with and without GRBs, but due\nto the overlap in the two populations no conclusion could be drawn.\n", "  For many years, lunar laser ranging (LLR) observations using a green\nwavelength have suffered an inhomogeneity problem both temporally and\nspatially. This paper reports on the implementation of a new infrared detection\nat the Grasse LLR station and describes how infrared telemetry improves this\nsituation. Our first results show that infrared detection permits us to densify\nthe observations and allows measurements during the new and the full Moon\nperiods. The link budget improvement leads to homogeneous telemetric\nmeasurements on each lunar retro-reflector. Finally, a surprising result is\nobtained on the Lunokhod 2 array which attains the same efficiency as Lunokhod\n1 with an infrared laser link, although those two targets exhibit a\ndifferential efficiency of six with a green laser link.\n", "  We present a lattice computation of the isospin-breaking corrections to\npseudoscalar meson masses using the gauge configurations produced by the\nEuropean Twisted Mass collaboration with $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ dynamical quarks at\nthree values of the lattice spacing ($a \\simeq 0.062, 0.082$ and $0.089$ fm)\nwith pion masses in the range $M_\\pi \\simeq 210 - 450$ MeV. The strange and\ncharm quark masses are tuned at their physical values. We adopt the RM123\nmethod based on the combined expansion of the path integral in powers of the\n$d$- and $u$-quark mass difference ($\\widehat{m}_d - \\widehat{m}_u$) and of the\nelectromagnetic coupling $\\alpha_{em}$. Within the quenched QED approximation,\nwhich neglects the effects of the sea-quark charges, and after the\nextrapolations to the physical pion mass and to the continuum and infinite\nvolume limits, we provide results for the pion, kaon and (for the first time)\ncharmed-meson mass splittings, for the prescription-dependent parameters\n$\\epsilon_{\\pi^0}$, $\\epsilon_\\gamma(\\overline{MS}, 2~\\mbox{GeV})$,\n$\\epsilon_{K^0}(\\overline{MS}, 2~\\mbox{GeV})$, related to the violations of the\nDashen's theorem, and for the light quark mass difference $(\\widehat{m}_d -\n\\widehat{m}_u)(\\overline{MS}, 2~\\mbox{GeV})$.\n", "  We aim to understand under which conditions a low mass planet can open a gap\nin viscous dusty protoplanetary discs. For this purpose, we extend the theory\nof dust radial drift to include the contribution from the tides of an embedded\nplanet and from the gas viscous forces. From this formalism, we derive i) a\ngrain size-dependent criterion for dust gap opening in discs, ii) an estimate\nof the location of the outer edge of the dust gap and iii) an estimate of the\nminimum Stokes number above which low-mass planets are able to carve gaps which\nappear only in the dust disc. These analytical estimates are particularly\nhelpful to appraise the minimum mass of an hypothetical planet carving gaps in\ndiscs observed at long wavelengths and high resolution. We validate the theory\nagainst 3D SPH simulations of planet-disc interaction in a broad range of dusty\nprotoplanetary discs. We find a remarkable agreement between the theoretical\nmodel and the numerical experiments.\n", "  We study the global consequences in the halos of spiral galaxies of the\nsteady, axially symmetric, mean field dynamo. We use the classical theory but\nadd the possibility of using the velocity field components as parameters in\naddition to the helicity and diffusivity. The analysis is based on the simplest\nversion of the theory and uses scale-invariant solutions. The velocity field\n(subject to restrictions) is a scale invariant field in a `pattern' frame, in\nplace of a full dynamical theory. The `pattern frame' of reference may either\nbe the systemic frame or some rigidly rotating spiral pattern frame. One type\nof solution for the magnetic field yields off-axis, spirally wound, magnetic\nfield lines. These predict sign changes in the Faraday screen rotation measure\nin every quadrant of the halo of an edge-on galaxy. Such rotation measure\noscillations have been observed in the CHANG-ES survey.\n", "  We have constructed the most-comprehensive catalog of photometry and proper\nmotions ever assembled for a globular cluster (GC). The core of $\\omega$Cen has\nbeen imaged over 650 times through WFC3's UVIS and IR channels for the purpose\nof detector calibration. There exist from 4 to over 60 exposures through each\nof 26 filters, stretching continuously from F225W in the UV to F160W in the\ninfrared. Furthermore, the 11-year baseline between these data and a 2002 ACS\nsurvey has allowed us to more than double the proper-motion accuracy and triple\nthe number of well-measured stars compared to our previous groundbreaking\neffort. This totally unprecedented complete spectral coverage for over 470,000\nstars within the cluster's core, from the tip of the red-giant branch down to\nthe white dwarfs, provides the best astro-photometric observational data base\nyet to understand the multiple-population phenomenon in any GC. In this first\npaper of the series we describe in detail the data-reduction processes and\ndeliver the astro-photometric catalog to the astronomical community.\n", "  We present the analysis of 29.77 days of K2 space photometry of the\nwell-detached massive 4.6 d O+B binary HD 165246 (V=7.8) obtained during\nCampaign 9b. This analysis reveals intrinsic variability in the residual\nlightcurve after subtraction of the binary model, in the frequency range [0,10]\n$d^{-1}$. This makes HD 165246 only the second O+B eclipsing binary with\nasteroseismic potential. While some of the frequencies are connected with the\nrotation of the primary, others are interpreted as due to oscillations with\nperiodicities of order days. The frequency resolution of the current dataset\ndoes not allow to distinguish between frequencies due to standing coherent\noscillation modes or travelling waves. Further time-resolved high-precision\nspectroscopy covering several binary orbits will reveal whether HD 165246 is a\nRosetta stone for synergistic binary and seismic modelling of an O-type star.\n", "  The distribution of N/O abundance ratios calculated by the detailed modelling\nof different galaxy spectra at z<4 is investigated. Supernova (SN) and long\ngamma-ray-burst (LGRB) host galaxies cover different redshift domains. N/O in\nSN hosts increases due to secondary N production towards low z (0.01)\naccompanying the growing trend of active galaxies (AGN, LINER). N/O in LGRB\nhosts decreases rapidly between z>1 and z ~0.1 following the N/H trend and\nreach the characteristic N/O ratios calculated for the HII regions in local and\nnearby galaxies. The few short period GRB (SGRB) hosts included in the galaxy\nsample show N/H <0.04 solar and O/H solar. They seem to continue the low bound\nN/H trend of SN hosts at z<0.3. The distribution of N/O as function of\nmetallicity for SN and LGRB hosts is compared with star chemical evolution\nmodels. The results show that several LGRB hosts can be explained by star\nmulti-bursting models when 12+log(O/H) <8.5, while some objects follow the\ntrend of continuous star formation models. N/O in SN hosts at log(O/H)+12 <8.5\nare not well explained by stellar chemical evolution models calculated for\nstarburst galaxies. At 12+log(O/H) >8.5 many different objects are nested close\nto O/H solar with N/O ranging between the maximum corresponding to starburst\ngalaxies and AGN and the minimum corresponding to HII regions and SGRB.\n", "  Context. About 120 Be/X-ray binaries (BeXBs) are known in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC); about half of them are pulsating with periods from a\nfew to hundreds of seconds. SXP 1323 is one of the longest-period pulsars known\nin this galaxy. Aims. SXP 1323 is in the field of view of a large set of\ncalibration observations that we analyse systematically, focusing on the time\nanalysis, in search of periodic signals. Methods. We analyse all available\nX-ray observations of SXP 1323 from Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, in the\ntime range from 1999 to the end of 2016. We perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram\nsearch in the band 2.5-10 keV on all observations to detect the neutron star\nspin period and constrain its long-term evolution. We also perform an orbital\nperiod search on the long-term light curve, merging all datasets. Results. We\nreport the discovery of a 26.188+-0.045 d period analysing data from Suzaku,\nXMM-Newton, and Chandra, which confirms the optical period derived from the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) data. If this corresponds to\nthe orbital period, this would be very short with respect to what is expected\nfrom the spin/orbital period relationship. We furthermore report on the spin\nperiod evolution in the last years. The source is spinning-up with an average\nrate of Pdot/P of 0.018 yr-1, decreasing from 1340 to 1100 s, in the period\nfrom 2006 to the end of 2016, which is also extreme with respect to the other\nBe/X-ray pulsars. From 2010 to the end of 2014, the pulse period is not clearly\ndetectable, although the source was still bright. Conclusions. SXP 1323 is a\npeculiar BeXB due to its long pulse period, rapid spin-up for several years,\nand short orbital period. A continuous monitoring of the source in the next\nyears is necessary to establish the long-term behaviour of the spin period.\n", "  We report HST/ACS observations of two nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxies: DDO 161\nand UGCA 319. Their distances determined via the Tip of the Red Giant Branch\nare 6.03 (-0.21/+0.29) Mpc and 5.75+-0.18 Mpc, respectively. The galaxies form\nan isolated pair dynamically well separated from the nearest neighbors: KK 176\n(7.28+-0.29 Mpc) and NGC 5068 (5.16+-0.21 Mpc). All four galaxies have a bulk\nspatial peculiar velocity towards the Virgo cluster of ~158+-17 km/s in the\nLocal Group rest frame and ~330 km/s with respect to the cluster center.\n", "  Between the 13 and 16 of February 2011 a series of coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) erupted from multiple polarity inversion lines within active region\n11158. For seven of these CMEs we use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS)\nflux rope model to determine the CME trajectory using both Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and coronagraph\nimages. We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model\nfor nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the\ndeflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the\nForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME\ndeflections range in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. All CMEs\ndeflect to the north but we find variations in the direction of the\nlongitudinal deflection. The rotations range between 5\\mydeg and 50\\mydeg with\nboth clockwise and counterclockwise rotations occurring. Three of the CMEs\nbegin with initial positions within 2 degrees of one another. These three CMEs\nall deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and\nrotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however,\nrespectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection\nand rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial\npropagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass. Ultimately, only one of\nthese seven CMEs yielded discernible in situ signatures near Earth, despite the\nactive region facing near Earth throughout the eruptions. We suggest that the\ndifferences in the deflection and rotation of the CMEs can explain whether each\nCME impacted or missed the Earth.\n", "  Timing properties of black hole X-ray binaries in outburst can be modeled\nwith mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating towards the black hole. Such\nmodels predict time lags between energy bands due to propagation delays. First\napplication of a propagating fluctuations model to black hole power spectra\nshowed good agreement with the data. Indeed, hard lags observed from these\nsystems appear to be in agreement with this generic prediction. Our PROPFLUC\ncode allows to simultaneously predict power spectra, time lags, and coherence\nof the variability as a function of energy. This was successfully applied to\nSwift data on the black hole MAXIJ1659-152, fitting jointly the power spectra\nin two energy bands and the cross-spectrum between these two bands. In the\ncurrent work, we attempt to to model two high signal to noise Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer (RXTE) observations of the black hole XTE J1550-564. We find\nthat neither observation can be adequately explained by the model even when\nconsidering, additionally to previous PROPFLUC versions, different propagation\nspeeds of the fluctuations. After extensive exploration of model extensions, we\ntentatively conclude that the quantitative and qualitative discrepancy between\nmodel predictions and data is generic to the propagating fluctuations paradigm.\nThis result encourages further investigation of the fundamental hypotheses of\nthe propagating fluctuations model. We discuss some of these hypotheses with an\neye to future works.\n", "  We discuss the relation between fermion entanglement and bipartite\nentanglement. We first show that an exact correspondence between them arises\nwhen the states are constrained to have a definite local number parity.\nMoreover, for arbitrary states in a four dimensional single-particle Hilbert\nspace, the fermion entanglement is shown to measure the entanglement between\ntwo distinguishable qubits defined by a suitable partition of this space. Such\nentanglement can be used as a resource for tasks like quantum teleportation. On\nthe other hand, this fermionic entanglement provides a lower bound to the\nentanglement of an arbitrary bipartition although in this case the local states\ninvolved will generally have different number parities. Finally the fermionic\nimplementation of the teleportation and superdense coding protocols based on\nqubits with odd and even number parity is discussed, together with the role of\nthe previous types of entanglement.\n", "  We present a near infrared study of the spectral components of the continuum\nin the inner 500$\\times$500 pc$^2$ of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk573 using\nadaptive optics near-infrared integral field spectroscopy with the instrument\nNIFS of the Gemini North Telescope at a spatial resolution of $\\sim$50 pc. We\nperformed spectral synthesis using the {\\sc starlight} code and constructed\nmaps for the contributions of different age components of the stellar\npopulation: young ($age\\leq100$ Myr), young-intermediate ($100<age\\leq700$\nMyr), intermediate-old ($700$ Myr $<age\\leq2$ Gyr) and old ($age>2$ Gyr) to the\nnear-IR K-band continuum, as well as their contribution to the total stellar\nmass. We found that the old stellar population is dominant within the inner 250\npc, while the intermediate age components dominate the continuum at larger\ndistances. A young stellar component contributes up to $\\sim$20% within the\ninner $\\sim$70 pc, while hot dust emission and featureless continuum components\nare also necessary to fit the nuclear spectrum, contributing up to 20% of the\nK-band flux there. The radial distribution of the different age components in\nthe inner kiloparsec of Mrk573 is similar to those obtained by our group for\nthe Seyfert galaxies Mrk1066, Mrk1157 and NGC1068 in previous works using a\nsimilar methodology. Young stellar populations ($\\leq$100 Myr) are seen in the\ninner 200-300 pc for all galaxies contributing with $\\ge$20% of the K-band\nflux, while the near-IR continuum is dominated by the contribution of\nintermediate-age stars ($t=$100 Myr-2 Gyr) at larger distances. Older stellar\npopulations dominate in the inner 250 pc.\n", "  A semiclassical model supporting the destructive interference interpretation\nof zero-width resonances (ZWR) is extended to wavelengths inducing c_minus-type\ncurve crossing situations in Na2 strong field dissociation. This opens the\npossibility to get critical couples of wavelengths lambda and field intensities\nI to reach ZWRs associated with the ground vibrationless level v = 0, that,\ncontrary to other vibrational states (v > 0), is not attainable for the\ncommonly referred c+-type crossings. The morphology of such ZWRs in the laser\n(I; lambda) parameter plane and their usefulness in filtration strategies\naiming at molecular cooling down to the ground v = 0 state are examined within\nthe frame of an adiabatic transport scheme.\n", "  Tight binaries of helium white dwarfs (He WDs) orbiting millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) will eventually \"merge\" due to gravitational damping of the orbit. The\noutcome has been predicted to be the production of long-lived ultra-compact\nX-ray binaries (UCXBs), in which the WD transfers material to the accreting\nneutron star (NS). Here we present complete numerical computations, for the\nfirst time, of such stable mass transfer from a He WD to a NS. We have\ncalculated a number of complete binary stellar evolution tracks, starting from\npre-LMXB systems, and evolved these to detached MSP+WD systems and further on\nto UCXBs. The minimum orbital period is found to be as short as 5.6 minutes. We\nfollowed the subsequent widening of the systems until the donor stars become\nplanets with a mass of ~0.005 Msun after roughly a Hubble time. Our models are\nable to explain the properties of observed UCXBs with high helium abundances\nand we can identify these sources on the ascending or descending branch in a\ndiagram displaying mass-transfer rate vs. orbital period.\n", "  We used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit to map the\ngas distribution, excitation and kinematics within the inner kiloparsec of four\nnearby low-luminosity active galaxies: NGC3982, NGC4501, NGC2787 and NGC4450.\nThe observations cover the spectral range 5600-7000{\\AA} at a velocity\nresolution of 120km/s and spatial resolution ranging from 50 to 70pc at the\ngalaxies. Extended emission in H{\\alpha}, [NII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}6548,6583,\n[SII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}6716,6730 over most of the field-of-view is observed for\nall galaxies, while only NGC3982 shows [OI]{\\lambda}6300 extended emission. The\nH{\\alpha} equivalent widths combined with the [NII]/H{\\alpha} line ratios\nreveal that NGC3982 and NGC4450 harbor Seyfert nuclei surrounded by regions\nwith LINER excitation, while NGC2787 and NGC4501 harbor LINER nuclei. NGC3982\nshows a partial ring of recent star-formation at 500pc from the nucleus, while\nin NGC4501 a region at 500pc west of the nucleus shows LINER excitation but has\nbeen interpreted as an aging HII region with the gas excitation dominated by\nshocks from supernovae. The line-of-sight velocity field of the gas shows a\nrotation pattern for all galaxies, with deviations from pure disk rotation\nobserved in NGC3982, NGC4501 and NGC4450. For NGC4501 and NGC4450, many of\nthese deviations are spatially coincident with dust structures seen in optical\ncontinuum images, leading to the interpretation that the deviations are due to\nshocks in the gas traced by the dust. A speculation is that these shocks lead\nto loss of angular momentum, allowing the gas to be transferred inwards to feed\nthe AGN. In the case of NGC2787, instead of deviations in the rotation field,\nwe see a misalignment of 40{^\\circ} between the orientation of the line of\nnodes of the gas rotation and the photometric major axis of the galaxy.\nEvidence of compact nuclear outflows are seen in NGC4501 and NGC4450.\n", "  The wide-area XMM-XXL X-ray survey is used to explore the fraction of\nobscured AGN at high accretion luminosities, $L_X (\\rm 2-10 \\, keV) > 10^{44}\n\\, erg \\,s ^{-1}$, and out to redshift $z\\approx1.5$. The sample covers an area\nof about $\\rm14\\,deg^2$ and provides constraints on the space density of\npowerful AGN over a wide range of neutral hydrogen column densities extending\nbeyond the Compton-thick limit, $\\rm N_H\\approx10^{24}\\,cm^{-2}$. The fraction\nof obscured Compton-thin ($\\rm N_H=10^{22}-10^{24}\\,cm^{-2}$) AGN is estimated\nto be $\\approx0.35$ for luminosities $L_X(\\rm 2-10\\,keV)>10^{44}\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$\nindependent of redshift. For less luminous sources the fraction of obscured\nCompton-thin AGN increases from $0.45\\pm0.10$ at $z=0.25$ to $0.75\\pm0.05$ at\n$z=1.25$. Studies that select AGN in the infrared via template fits to the\nobserved Spectral Energy Distribution of extragalactic sources estimate space\ndensities at high accretion luminosities consistent with the XMM-XXL\nconstraints. There is no evidence for a large population of AGN (e.g. heavily\nobscured) identified in the infrared and missed at X-ray wavelengths. We\nfurther explore the mid-infrared colours of XMM-XXL AGN as a function of\naccretion luminosity, column density and redshift. The fraction of XMM-XXL\nsources that lie within the mid-infrared colour wedges defined in the\nliterature to select AGN is primarily a function of redshift. This fraction\nincreases from about 20-30% at z=0.25 to about 50-70% at $z=1.5$.\n", "  Linear density response functions are calculated for symmetric nuclear matter\nof normal density by time-evolving two-time Green's functions in real time. The\nfeasability and convenience of this approach to this particular problem has\nbeen shown in previous publications. Calculations are here improved by using\nmore 'realistic' interactions derived from phase-shifts by inverse scattering.\nOf particular interest is the effect of the strong correlations in the nuclear\nmedium on the response. This as well as the related energy weighted sum rule,\ndependence on mean field and effective mass are some of the main objects of\nthis investigation.\n  Comparisons are made with the collision-less limit, the HF+RPA method. The\nimportance of vertex corrections is demonstrated.\n", "  We study the electronic properties of GaAs nanowires composed of both the\nzincblende and wurtzite modifications using a ten-band k.p model. In the\nwurtzite phase, two energetically close conduction bands are of importance for\nthe confinement and the energy levels of the electron ground state. These bands\nform two intersecting potential landscapes for electrons in zincblende/wurtzite\nnanostructures. The energy difference between the two bands depends sensitively\non strain, such that even small strains can reverse the energy ordering of the\ntwo bands. This reversal may already be induced by the non-negligible lattice\nmismatch between the two crystal phases in polytype GaAs nanostructures, a fact\nthat was ignored in previous studies of these structures. We present a\nsystematic study of the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic strain on the\nelectron ground state for both purely zincblende and wurtzite nanowires as well\nas for polytype superlattices. The coexistence of the two conduction bands and\ntheir opposite strain dependence results in complex electronic and optical\nproperties of GaAs polytype nanostructures. In particular, both the energy and\nthe polarization of the lowest intersubband transition depends on the relative\nfraction of the two crystal phases in the nanowire.\n", "  We present simultaneous radio through sub-mm observations of the black hole\nX-ray binary (BHXB) V404 Cygni during the most active phase of its June 2015\noutburst. Our $4$ hour long set of overlapping observations with the Very Large\nArray, the Sub-millimeter Array, and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope\n(SCUBA-2), covers 8 different frequency bands (including the first detection of\na BHXB jet at $666 \\,{\\rm GHz}/450\\mu m$), providing an unprecedented\nmulti-frequency view of the extraordinary flaring activity seen during this\nperiod of the outburst. In particular, we detect multiple rapidly evolving\nflares, which reach Jy-level fluxes across all of our frequency bands. With\nthis rich data set we performed detailed MCMC modeling of the repeated flaring\nevents. Our custom model adapts the van der Laan synchrotron bubble model to\ninclude twin bi-polar ejections, propagating away from the black hole at bulk\nrelativistic velocities, along a jet axis that is inclined to the line of\nsight. The emission predicted by our model accounts for projection effects,\nrelativistic beaming, and the geometric time delay between the approaching and\nreceding ejecta in each ejection event. We find that a total of 8 bi-polar,\ndiscrete jet ejection events can reproduce the emission that we observe in all\nof our frequency bands remarkably well. With our best fit model, we provide\ndetailed probes of jet speed, structure, energetics, and geometry. Our analysis\ndemonstrates the paramount importance of the mm/sub-mm bands, which offer a\nunique, more detailed view of the jet than can be provided by radio frequencies\nalone.\n", "  Our previous paper outlined the general aspects of the theory of radio light\ncurve and polarization formation for pulsars. We predicted the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the tilt of the linear polarization position angle of\nthe and the circular polarization. However, some of the radio pulsars indicate\na clear deviation from that correlation. In this paper we apply the theory of\nthe radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of\nindividual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory\nthe circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need\nto introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the\ngeneration of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain\npulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from\nwhat we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation\ntheory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns\nfor different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different\nobserver viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and\npolarization profiles for pulsars with interpulses. Further, we explain the\ncharacteristic width of the position angle curves by introducing the concept of\na wide emitting region. Another important feature of radio polarization\nprofiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some\ncases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency. Here we\ndemonstrate that propagation effects do not necessarily imply a significant\nfrequency-dependent change of the position angle curve.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum distributions of single inclusive hadron\nproduction in ${e^ + }{e^ - }$ annihilation processes. Although the only\navailable experimental data are scarce and quite old, we find that the\nfundamental features of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution,\nhistorically addressed in Drell-Yan processes and, more recently, in\nSemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes, are visible in ${e^ + }{e^\n- }$ annihilations as well. Interesting effects related to its non-perturbative\nregime can be observed. We test two different parameterizations for the\n$p_\\perp$ dependence of the cross section: the usual Gaussian distribution and\na power-law model. We find the latter to be more appropriate in describing this\nparticular set of experimental data, over a relatively large range of $p_\\perp$\nvalues. We use this model to map some of the features of the data within the\nframework of TMD evolution, and discuss the caveats of this and other possible\ninterpretations, related to the one-dimensional nature of the available\nexperimental data.\n", "  We use multi-wavelength SDSS images and Galaxy Zoo morphologies to identify a\nsample of $\\sim$$270$ late-type galaxies with an off-centre bar. We measure\noffsets in the range 0.2-2.5 kpc between the photometric centres of the stellar\ndisc and stellar bar. The measured offsets correlate with global asymmetries of\nthe galaxies, with those with largest offsets showing higher lopsidedness.\nThese findings are in good agreement with predictions from simulations of\ndwarf-dwarf tidal interactions producing off-centre bars. We find that the\nmajority of galaxies with off-centre bars are of Magellanic type, with a median\nmass of $10^{9.6} M_{\\odot}$, and 91% of them having $M_{\\star}<3\\times10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$, the characteristic mass at which galaxies start having higher\ncentral concentrations attributed to the presence of bulges. We conduct a\nsearch for companions to test the hypothesis of tidal interactions, but find\nthat a similar fraction of galaxies with offset bars have companions within 100\nkpc as galaxies with centred bars. Although this may be due to the\nincompleteness of the SDSS spectroscopic survey at the faint end, alternative\nscenarios that give rise to offset bars such as interactions with dark\ncompanions or the effect of lopsided halo potentials should be considered.\nFuture observations are needed to confirm possible low mass companion\ncandidates and to determine the shape of the dark matter halo, in order to find\nthe explanation for the off-centre bars in these galaxies.\n", "  Several studies of nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the\nsoft X-ray emission presents a size and morphology that resembles that of the\nnarrow-line region (NLR) traced by [O III]. Since the NLR is mainly constituted\nby gas photoionised by the AGN, it seems logical to assume that this is also\nthe primary source of the soft X-ray emission. However, these results are based\non individual sources or small samples, particularly focused on type-2 Seyfert\ngalaxies. Very little has been said concerning other types of AGN. The purpose\nof this work is to compare the circumnuclear morphologies of soft X-ray and [O\nIII] images to test whether they match in different optical classes of AGN. Our\nsample is composed of 27 AGN: nine type-1 Seyferts, 10 type-2 Seyferts, and\neight low ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). We find a good\nmatch in 100% of the type-2 Seyferts in our sample. This correspondence is less\nfrequent in type-1 Seyferts (22%) and it is not seen in LINERs. The good\nresemblance in type-2 Seyferts constitutes an evidence for a common physical\norigin. We argue that the lack of correspondence in type-1 Seyferts might be\ndue to the line of sight perpendicular to the accretion disk. Based on the\nmorphologies of the eight LINERs in our sample, we discard a common origin for\nthe soft X-ray and [O III] emissions in these objects. Regarding the X-ray\nproperties, both high column density and hard X-ray luminosity are associated\nwith matched morphologies.\n", "  Post-starbursts (PSBs) are candidate for rapidly transitioning from\nstar-bursting to quiescent galaxies. We study the molecular gas evolution of\nPSBs at z ~ 0.03 - 0.2. We undertook new CO (2-1) observations of 22 Seyfert\nPSBs candidates using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope. This sample complements\nprevious samples of PSBs by including green valley PSBs with Seyfert-like\nemission, allowing us to analyze for the first time the molecular gas\nproperties of 116 PSBs with a variety of AGN properties. The distribution of\nmolecular gas to stellar mass fractions in PSBs is significantly different than\nnormal star-forming galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. The combined samples of\nPSBs with Seyfert-like emission line ratios have a gas fraction distribution\nwhich is even more significantly different and is broader (~ 0.03-0.3). Most of\nthem have lower gas fractions than normal star-forming galaxies. We find a\nhighly significant correlation between the WISE 12 micron to 4.6 micron flux\nratios and molecular gas fractions in both PSBs and normal galaxies. We detect\nmolecular gas in 27% of our Seyfert PSBs. Taking into account the upper limits,\nthe mean and the dispersion of the distribution of the gas fraction in our\nSeyfert PSB sample are much smaller (mean = 0.025, std dev. = 0.018) than\nprevious samples of Seyfert PSBs or PSBs in general (mean ~ 0.1 - 0.2, std dev.\n~ 0.1 - 0.2).\n", "  We use the most homogeneous $Geneva$ seven-colour photometric system to\nderive new metallicity calibrations for early A- to K-type stars that cover\nboth, dwarf stars and giants. The calibrations are based on several\nspectroscopic data sets that were merged to a common scale, and we applied them\nto open cluster data to obtain an additional proof of the metallicity scale and\naccuracy. In total, metallicities of 54 open clusters are presented. The\naccuracy of the calibrations for single stars is in general below 0.1 dex, but\nfor the open cluster sample with mean values based on several stars we find a\nmuch better precision, a scatter as low as about 0.03 dex. Furthermore, we\ncombine the new results with another comprehensive photometric data set to\npresent a catalogue of mean metallicities for more than 3000 F and G-type dwarf\nstars with $\\sigma \\sim 0.06$ dex. The list was extended by more than 1200\nhotter stars up to about 8500 K (or spectral type A3) by taking advantage of\ntheir almost reddening free characteristic in the new $Geneva$ metallicity\ncalibrations. These two large samples are well suited as primary or secondary\ncalibrators of other data, and we already identified about 20 spectroscopic\ndata sets that show offsets up to about 0.4 dex.\n", "  (Sub-)Millimeter observations of the polarized emission of aligned aspherical\ndust grains enable us to study the magnetic fields within protoplanetary disk.\nHowever, the interpretation of these observations is complex. One must consider\nthe various effects that alter the measured polarized signal, such as the shape\nof dust grains, the efficiency of grain alignment, the magnetic field\nproperties, and the projection of the signal along the line of sight. We aim at\nanalyzing observations of the polarized dust emission by disentangling the\neffects on the polarization signal in the context of 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations. For this purpose, we developed a code capable of simulating dust\ngrain alignment of aspherical grains and intrinsical polarization of thermal\ndust emission. We find that the influence of thermal polarization and dust\ngrain alignment on the polarized emission displayed as spatially resolved\npolarization map or as spectral energy distribution trace disk properties which\nare not traced in total (unpolarized) emission such as the magnetic field\ntopology. The radiative transfer simulations presented in this work enable the\n3D analysis of intrinsically polarized dust emission - observed with, e.g.,\nALMA - which is essential to constrain magnetic field properties.\n", "  Bursts and flares are among the distinctive observational manifestations of\nmagnetars, isolated neutron stars endowed with an ultra-strong magnetic field\n($B \\approx 10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G). It is believed that these events arise in a\nhot electron-positron plasma which remains trapped within the closed magnetic\nfield lines. We developed a simple radiative transfer model to simulate\nmagnetar flare emission in the case of a steady trapped fireball. After\ndividing the fireball surface in a number of plane-parallel slabs, the local\nspectral and polarization properties are obtained integrating the radiative\ntransfer equations for the two normal modes. We assume that magnetic Thomson\nscattering is the dominant source of opacity, and neglect contributions from\nsecond-order radiative processes, although double-Compton scattering is\naccounted for in establishing local thermal equilibrium in the fireball\natmospheric layers. The observed spectral and polarization properties as\nmeasured by a distant observer are obtained summing the contributions from the\npatches which are visible for a given viewing geometry by means of a\nray-tracing code. The spectra we obtained in the 1-100 keV energy range are\nthermal and can be described in terms of the superposition of two blackbodies.\nThe blackbody temperature and the emitting area ratio are in broad agreement\nwith the available observations. The predicted linear polarization degree is in\ngeneral greater than 80% over the entire energy range and should be easily\ndetectable by new-generation X-ray polarimeters, like IXPE, XIPE and eXTP.\n", "  The integrated properties of nuclear rings are correlated with their host\ngalaxy's secular evolution and its dynamics, as well as with the formation and\nevolution of the ring's star cluster population(s). Here we present a new\nmethod to accurately measure the spectral energy distribution and current\nstar-formation rate (SFR) of the nuclear ring in the barred spiral galaxy NGC\n1512 based on high-resolution {\\sl Hubble} and {\\sl Spitzer Space Telescope}\nimages. Image degradation does not have a significant negative effect on the\nrobustness of the results. To obtain the ring's SFR for the period spanning\n$\\sim$3--10 Myr, we apply our method to the continuum-subtracted H$\\alpha$ and\n8 $\\mu$m images. The resulting SFR surface density, $\\Sigma_{\\rm\n  SFR}$=$0.09\\, {M}_{\\odot} \\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ ${\\rm kpc}^{-2}$, which is much\nhigher than the disk-averaged SFR densities in normal galaxies. We also\nestimate the ring's total stellar mass, log (${M}/{M}_{\\odot}$) = 7.1 $\\pm$\n0.11 for an average age of $\\sim$40 Myr.\n", "  We consider a sample of 412 galaxies with radial velocities $V_{\\rm LG} <\n2500$ km s$^{-1}$ situated in the sky region of ${\\rm\nRA}=13^h\\hspace{-0.4em}.\\,0$ ... $19^h\\hspace{-0.4em}.\\,0$, ${\\rm\nDec}=+10^{\\circ}$ ... $+40^{\\circ}$ between the Local Void and the\nSupergalactic plane. One hundred and eighty-one of them have individual\ndistance estimates. Peculiar velocities of the galaxies as a function of\nSupergalactic latitude SGB show signs of Virgocentric infall at $SGB <\n10^{\\circ}$ and motion from the Local Void at $SGB > 60^{\\circ}$. A half of the\nHercules-Bootes galaxies belong to 17 groups and 29 pairs, with the richest\ngroup around NGC5353. A typical group is characterized by the velocity\ndispersion of $67$ km s$^{-1}$, the harmonic radius of $182$ kpc, the stellar\nmass of $4.3 \\times10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ and the virial-to-stellar mass ratio of\n$32$. The binary galaxies have the mean radial velocity difference of $37$ km\ns$^{-1}$, the projected separation of $96$ kpc, the mean integral stellar mass\nof $2.6\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$ and the mean virial-to-stellar mass ratio of\nabout $8$. The total dark-matter-to-stellar mass ratio in the considered sky\nregion amounts to $37$ being almost the same as that in the Local Volume.\n", "  We study quintessential inflation using a generalized exponential potential\n$V(\\phi)\\propto exp(-\\lambda \\phi^n/Mpl^n), n>1$, the model admits slow-roll\ninflation at early times and leads to close-to-scaling behaviour in the post\ninflationary era with an exit to dark energy at late times. We present detailed\ninvestigations of the inflationary stage in the light of the Planck 2015\nresults, study post-inflationary dynamics and analytically confirm the\nexistence of an approximately scaling solution. Additionally, assuming that\nstandard massive neutrinos are non-minimally coupled, makes the field $\\phi$\ndominant once again at late times giving rise to present accelerated expansion\nof the Universe. We derive observational constraints on the field and\ntime-dependent neutrino masses. In particular, for $n=6 (8)$, the parameter\n$\\lambda$ is constrained to be,$\\log \\lambda > -7.29 (-11.7)$; the model\nproduces the spectral index of the power spectrum of primordial scalar (matter\ndensity) perturbations as $ n_s = 0.959 \\pm 0.001 (0.961 \\pm 0.001)$ and tiny\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, $r<1.72 \\times 10^{-2} (2.32 \\times 10^{-2})$\nrespectively. Consequently, the upper bound on possible values of the sum of\nneutrino masses $\\Sigma m_{\\nu} \\lesssim 2.5$ eV significantly enhances\ncompared to that in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  We report the large effort which is producing comprehensive high-level young\nstar cluster (YSC) catalogues for a significant fraction of galaxies observed\nwith the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) Hubble treasury program. We\npresent the methodology developed to extract cluster positions, verify their\ngenuine nature, produce multiband photometry (from NUV to NIR), and derive\ntheir physical properties via spectral energy distribution fitting analyses. We\nuse the nearby spiral galaxy NGC628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact\nthat LEGUS will have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of\nYSCs and compact stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of\nthe cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at\nthe bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous clusters.\nThe cluster mass function of NGC628 is consistent with a power-law distribution\nof slopes $\\sim -2$ and a truncation of a few times $10^5$ M$_\\odot$. After\ntheir formation YSCs and compact associations follow different evolutionary\npaths. YSCs survive for a longer timeframe, confirming their being potentially\nbound systems. Associations disappear on time scales comparable to\nhierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are\nexpanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the inner\nregion of NGC628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is little or no\ndisruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass ($\\leq$ $10^4$\nM$_\\odot$) clusters suggesting that a mass-dependent component is necessary to\nfully describe the YSC disruption process in NGC628.\n", "  Pulsations from the high mass X-ray binary AXJ1910.7+0917 were discovered\nduring Chandra observations performed in 2011 (Israel et al. 2016). We report\nhere more details on this discovery and discuss the source nature. The period\nof the X-ray signal is P=36200+/-110s, with a pulsed fraction, PF, of 63+/-4%.\nGiven the association with a massive B-type companion star, we ascribe this\nlong periodicity to the rotation of the neutron star, making AXJ1910.7+0917 the\nslowest known X-ray pulsar. We report also on the spectroscopy of XMM-Newton\nobservations that serendipitously covered the source field, resulting in an\nhighly absorbed (column density almost reaching 1e23cm-2), power law X-ray\nspectrum. The X-ray flux is variable on a timescale of years, spanning a\ndynamic range >60. The very long neutron star spin period can be explained\nwithin a quasi-spherical settling accretion model, that applies to low\nluminosity, wind-fed, X-ray pulsars.\n", "  A decade of surveys has hinted at a possible higher occurrence rate of debris\ndiscs in systems hosting low mass planets. This could be due to common\nfavourable forming conditions for rocky planets close in and planetesimals at\nlarge radii. In this paper we present the first resolved millimetre study of\nthe debris disc in the 4.6 Gyr old multiplanet system 61 Vir, combining ALMA\nand JCMT data at 0.86 mm. We fit the data using a parametric disc model,\nfinding that the disc of planetesimals extends from 30 AU to at least 150 AU,\nwith a surface density distribution of millimetre sized grains with a power law\nslope of 0.1$^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$. We also present a numerical collisional model\nthat can predict the evolution of the surface density of millimetre grains for\na given primordial disc, finding that it does not necessarily have the same\nradial profile as the total mass surface density (as previous studies suggested\nfor the optical depth), with the former being flatter. Finally, we find that if\nthe planetesimal disc was stirred at 150 AU by an additional unseen planet,\nthat planet should be more massive than 10 M$_{\\oplus}$ and lie between 10-20\nAU. Lower planet masses and semi-major axes down to 4 AU are possible for\neccentricities $\\gg$ 0.1.\n", "  We take advantage of the exquisite quality of the Hubble Space Telescope\nastro-photometric catalog of the core of wCen presented in the first paper of\nthis series to derive a high-resolution, high-precision, high-accuracy\ndifferential-reddening map of the field. The map has a spatial resolution of\n2x2 square arcsecs over a total field of view of about 4.3'x4.3'. The\ndifferential reddening itself is estimated via an iterative procedure using\nfive distinct color-magnitude diagrams, which provided consistent results to\nwithin the 0.1% level. Assuming an average reddening value E(B-V)=0.12, the\ndifferential-reddening within the cluster's core can vary by up to +/- 10%,\nwith a typical a standard deviation of about 4%. Our differential-reddening map\nis made available to the astronomical community in the form of a\nmulti-extension FITS file. This differential-reddening map is essential for a\ndetailed understanding of the multiple stellar populations of wCen, as\npresented in the next paper in this series. Moreover, it provides unique\ninsight into the level of small spatial-scale extinction variations in the\nGalactic foreground.\n", "  We quantify the emergence and decay rates of preceder (p) and follower (f)\nsunspots within ten active regions from 2010-2014 using Space-weather\nHelioseismic Magnetic Imager Active Region Patch data. The sunspots are small-\nto mid-sized regions and contain a signed flux within a single polarity sunspot\nof $(1.1-6.5)\\times 10^{21}$ Mx. The net unsigned flux within the regions,\nincluding plage, ranges from $(5.1-20)\\times 10^{21}$ Mx. Rates are calculated\nwith and without intensity contours to differentiate between sunspot formation\nand flux emergence. Signed flux emergence rates, calculated with intensity\ncontours, for the p (f) spots average $6.8$ (4.9) $\\times 10^{19}$ Mx h$^{-1}$,\nwhile decay rates are $-1.9 (-3.4)\\times 10^{19}$ Mx h$^{-1}$. The mean, signed\nflux emergence rate of the regions, including plage, is $7.1 \\times 10^{19}$ Mx\nh$^{-1}$ for a mean peak flux of $5.9 \\times 10^{21}$ Mx. Using a synthesis of\nthese results and others reported previously, there is a clear trend for larger\nflux regions to emerge faster than smaller ones. Observed emergence rates\n($d{\\phi}/dt$, Mx h$^{-1}$) scale with total signed peak flux,\n$\\tilde{\\phi}_{max}$, as a power law with an exponent of 0.36, i.e.,\n$d{\\phi}/dt = A \\tilde{\\phi}_{max}^{0.36}$. The observed rates may assist in\nconstraining the boundary and initial conditions in simulations which already\ndemonstrate increased rates for flux tubes with higher buoyancy and twist, or\nin the presence of a strong upflow. Overall, the observed emergence rates are\nsmaller than those in simulations, which may indicate a slower rise of the flux\nin the interior than captured in simulations.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the spectral line profiles for transition region\nions observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). In this\ncontext, we have analyzed an active-region observation performed by IRIS in its\n1400 A spectral window. The transition-region lines are found to exhibit\nsignificant wings in their spectral profiles, which can be well-fitted with\nnon-Maxwellian kappa-distribution. The fit with a kappa-distribution can\nperform better than a double Gaussian fit, especially for the strongest line,\nSi IV 1402.8 A. Typical values of $\\kappa$ found are about 2, occurring in a\nmajority of spatial pixels where the transition region lines are symmetric,\ni.e., the fit can be performed. Furthermore, all five spectral lines studied\n(from Si IV, O IV and S IV) appear to have the same FWHM irrespective of\nwhether the line is an allowed or an intercombination transition. A similar\nvalue of kappa is obtained for the electron distribution by fitting of the line\nintensities relative to Si IV 1402.8 A, if photospheric abundances are assumed.\nThe kappa-distributions however do not remove the presence of non-thermal\nbroadening. Instead, they actually increase the non-thermal width. This is\nbecause for kappa-distributions the transition-region ions are formed at lower\ntemperatures. The large observed non-thermal width lowers the opacity of the Si\nIV line sufficiently enough for this line to become optically thin.\n", "  GRAVITY is a new instrument to coherently combine the light of the European\nSouthern Observatory Very Large Telescope Interferometer to form a telescope\nwith an equivalent 130 m diameter angular resolution and a collecting area of\n200 m$^2$. The instrument comprises fiber fed integrated optics beam\ncombination, high resolution spectroscopy, built-in beam analysis and control,\nnear-infrared wavefront sensing, phase-tracking, dual beam operation and laser\nmetrology [...]. This article gives an overview of GRAVITY and reports on the\nperformance and the first astronomical observations during commissioning in\n2015/16. We demonstrate phase tracking on stars as faint as m$_K$ ~ 10 mag,\nphase-referenced interferometry of objects fainter than m$_K$ ~ 15 mag with a\nlimiting magnitude of m$_K$ ~ 17 mag, minute long coherent integrations, a\nvisibility accuracy of better than 0.25 %, and spectro-differential phase and\nclosure phase accuracy better than 0.5{\\deg}, corresponding to a differential\nastrometric precision of better than 10 microarcseconds ({\\mu}as). The\ndual-beam astrometry, measuring the phase difference of two objects with laser\nmetrology, is still under commissioning. First observations show residuals as\nlow as 50 {\\mu}as when following objects over several months. We illustrate the\ninstrument performance with the observations of archetypical objects for the\ndifferent instrument modes. Examples include the Galactic Center supermassive\nblack hole and its fast orbiting star S2 for phase referenced dual beam\nobservations and infrared wavefront sensing, the High Mass X-Ray Binary BP Cru\nand the Active Galactic Nucleus of PDS 456 for few {\\mu}as spectro-differential\nastrometry, the T Tauri star S CrA for a spectro-differential visibility\nanalysis, {\\xi} Tel and 24 Cap for high accuracy visibility observations, and\n{\\eta} Car for interferometric imaging with GRAVITY.\n", "  We present the first optical observation at sub-milliarcsecond (mas) scale of\nthe microquasar SS 433 obtained with the GRAVITY instrument on the VLT\ninterferometer. The 3.5 hour exposure reveals a rich K-band spectrum dominated\nby hydrogen Br$\\gamma\\ $ and \\ion{He}{i} lines, as well as (red-shifted)\nemission lines coming from the jets. The K-band continuum emitting region is\ndominated by a marginally resolved point source ($<$ 1 mas) embedded inside a\ndiffuse background accounting for 10\\% of the total flux. The jet line\npositions agree well with the ones expected from the jet kinematic model, an\ninterpretation also supported by the consistent sign (i.e. negative/positive\nfor the receding/approaching jet component) of the phase shifts observed in the\nlines. The significant visibility drop across the jet lines, together with the\nsmall and nearly identical phases for all baselines, point toward a jet that is\noffset by less than 0.5 mas from the continuum source and resolved in the\ndirection of propagation, with a typical size of 2 mas. The jet position angle\nof $\\sim$80$^{\\circ}$ is consistent with the expected one at the observation\ndate. Jet emission so close to the central binary system would suggest that\nline locking, if relevant to explain the amplitude and stability of the 0.26c\njet velocity, operates on elements heavier than hydrogen. The Br$\\gamma\\ $\nprofile is broad and double peaked. It is better resolved than the continuum\nand the change of the phase signal sign across the line on all baselines\nsuggests an East-West oriented geometry alike the jet direction and supporting\na (polar) disk wind origin.\n", "  The Outer Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) spiral arm is the most distant molecular\nspiral arm in the Milky Way, but until recently little was known about this\nstructure. Discovered by Dame and Thaddeus (2011), the OSC lies $\\sim$15 kpc\nfrom the Galactic Center. Due to the Galactic warp, it rises to nearly\n4$^{\\circ}$ above the Galactic Plane in the first Galactic quadrant, leaving it\nunsampled by most Galactic plane surveys. Here we observe HII region candidates\nspatially coincident with the OSC using the Very Large Array to image radio\ncontinuum emission from 65 targets and the Green Bank Telescope to search for\nammonia and water maser emission from 75 targets. This sample, drawn from the\nWISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, represents every HII region candidate\nnear the longitude-latitude (l,v) locus of the OSC. Coupled with their\ncharacteristic mid-infrared morphologies, detection of radio continuum emission\nstrongly suggests that a target is a bona fide HII region. Detections of\nassociated ammonia or water maser emission allow us to derive a kinematic\ndistance and determine if the velocity of the region is consistent with that of\nthe OSC. Nearly 60% of the observed sources were detected in radio continuum,\nand over 20% have ammonia or water maser detections. The velocities of these\nsources mainly place them beyond the Solar orbit. These very distant high-mass\nstars have stellar spectral types as early as O4. We associate high-mass star\nformation at 2 new locations with the OSC, increasing the total number of\ndetected HII regions in the OSC to 12.\n", "  The Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn (LZK) theory is commonly considered as the correct\nlarge-distance limit for the van der Waals (vdW) interaction of adsorbates\n(atoms, molecules, or nanoparticles) with solid substrates. In the standard\napproximate form, implicitly based on \"local\" dielectric functions, the LZK\napproach predicts universal power laws for vdW interactions depending only on\nthe dimensionality of the interacting objects. However, recent experimental\nfindings are challenging the universality of this theoretical approach at\nfinite distances of relevance for nanoscale assembly. Here, we present a\ncombined analytical and numerical many-body study demonstrating that physical\nadsorption can be significantly enhanced at the nanoscale. Regardless of the\nband gap or the nature of the adsorbate specie, we find deviations from\nconventional LZK power laws that extend to separation distances of up to 10--20\nnanometers. Comparison with recent experimental observation of ultra\nlong-ranged vdW interactions in the delamination of graphene from a silicon\nsubstrate reveals qualitative agreement with the present theory. The\nsensitivity of vdW interactions to the substrate response and to the adsorbate\ncharacteristic excitation frequency also suggests that adsorption strength can\nbe effectively tuned in experiments, paving the way to an improved control of\nphysical adsorption at the nanoscale.\n", "  We investigate broad absorption line (BAL) disappearance and emergence using\na 470 BAL-quasar sample over < 0.10-5.25 rest-frame years with at least three\nspectroscopic epochs for each quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\nidentify 14 disappearing BALs over < 1.73-4.62 rest-frame years and 18 emerging\nBALs over < 1.46-3.66 rest-frame years associated with the CIV 1548,1550 and/or\nSiIV 1393,1402 doublets, and report on their variability behavior. BAL quasars\nin our dataset exhibit disappearing/emerging CIV BALs at a rate of 2.3 and 3.0\nper cent, respectively, and the frequency for BAL to non-BAL quasar transitions\nis 1.7 per cent. We detect four re-emerging BALs over < 3.88 rest-frame years\non average and three re-disappearing BALs over < 4.15 rest-frame years on\naverage, the first reported cases of these types. We infer BAL lifetimes along\nthe line of sight to be nominally < 100-1000 yr using disappearing CIV BALs in\nour sample. Interpretations of (re-)emerging and (re-)disappearing BALs reveal\nevidence that collectively supports both transverse-motion and\nionization-change scenarios to explain BAL variations. We constrain a nominal\nCIV/SiIV BAL outflow location of < 100 pc from the central source and a radial\nsize of > 1x10^-7 pc (0.02 au) using the ionization-change scenario, and\nconstrain a nominal outflow location of < 0.5 pc and a transverse size of ~0.01\npc using the transverse-motion scenario. Our findings are consistent with\nprevious work, and provide evidence in support of BALs tracing compact flow\ngeometries with small filling factors.\n", "  High quality reconstructions of the three dimensional velocity and density\nfields of the local Universe are essential to study the local Large Scale\nStructure. In this paper, the Wiener Filter reconstruction technique is applied\nto galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogs to understand how the Hubble\nconstant (H0) value and the grouping scheme affect the reconstructions. While\nH0 is used to derive radial peculiar velocities from galaxy distance\nmeasurements and total velocities, the grouping scheme serves the purpose of\nremoving non linear motions. Two different grouping schemes (based on the\nliterature and a systematic algorithm) as well as five H0 values ranging from\n72 to 76 km/s/Mpc are selected. The Wiener Filter is applied to the resulting\ncatalogs. Whatever grouping scheme is used, the larger H0 is, the larger the\ninfall onto the local Volume is. However, this conclusion has to be strongly\nmitigated: a bias minimization scheme applied to the catalogs after grouping\nsuppresses this effect. At fixed H0, reconstructions obtained with catalogs\ngrouped with the different schemes exhibit structures at the proper location in\nboth cases but the latter are more contrasted in the less aggressive scheme\ncase: having more constraints permits an infall from both sides onto the\nstructures to reinforce their overdensity. Such findings highlight the\nimportance of a balance between grouping to suppress non linear motions and\npreserving constraints to produce an infall onto structures expected to be\nlarge overdensities. Such an observation is promising to perform constrained\nsimulations of the local Universe including its massive clusters.\n", "  We examine the nature, possible orbits and physical properties of the\nprogenitor of the North-western stellar stream (NWS) in the halo of the\nAndromeda galaxy (M31). The progenitor is assumed to be an accreting dwarf\ngalaxy with globular clusters (GCs). It is, in general, difficult to determine\nthe progenitor's orbit precisely because of many necessary parameters.\nRecently, Veljanoski et al. 2014 reported five GCs whose positions and radial\nvelocities suggest an association with the stream. We use this data to\nconstrain the orbital motions of the progenitor using test-particle\nsimulations. Our simulations split the orbit solutions into two branches\naccording to whether the stream ends up in the foreground or in the background\nof M31. Upcoming observations that will determine the distance to the NWS will\nbe able to reject one of the two branches. In either case, the solutions\nrequire that the pericentric radius of any possible orbit be over 2 kpc. We\nestimate the efficiency of the tidal disruption and confirm the consistency\nwith the assumption for the progenitor being a dwarf galaxy. The progenitor\nrequires the mass $\\ga 2\\times10^6 M_{\\sun}$ and half-light radius $\\ga 30$ pc.\nIn addition, $N$-body simulations successfully reproduce the basic observed\nfeatures of the NWS and the GCs' line-of-sight velocities.\n", "  We study the problem of a four-dimensional brane lying in the\nfive-dimensional degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Nariai) black hole, in\nfive-dimensional $F(R)$-gravity. We show that there cannot exist the brane in\nthe Nariai bulk space except the case that the brane tension vanishes. We\ndemonstrate that the five-dimensional Nariai bulk is unstable in a large region\nof the parameter space. In particular, the Nariai bulk can have classical\n(anti-)evaporation instabilities. The bulk instability back-reacts on the\nfour-dimensional brane, in case that the brane tension vanishes, and the\nunstable modes propagate in their world-volume.\n", "  We present tilting rates for galaxies comparable to the Milky Way (MW) in a\n$\\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, and compare\nthese with the predicted tilting rate detection limit of the {\\it Gaia}\nsatellite $0.28\\degrees$Gyr$^{-1}$. We first identify galaxies with mass\ncomparable to the MW ($9 \\times 10^{11} \\le M_{200} \\le 1.2 \\times 10^{12}\n\\Msun $) and consider the tilting rates between $z=0.3$ and $0$. This sample\nyields a tilting rate of $7.6\\degrees \\pm 4.5\\degrees$Gyr$^{-1}$. We constrain\nour sample further to exclude any galaxies that have high stellar accretion\nduring the same time. We still find significant tilting, with an average rate\nof $6.3\\degrees$Gyr$^{-1}$. Both subsamples tilt with rates significantly above\n{\\it Gaia}'s predicted detection limit. We show that our sample of galaxies\ncovers a wide range of environments, including some similar to the MW's. We\nfind galaxies in denser regions tilt with higher rates then galaxies in less\ndense regions. We also find correlations between the angular misalignment of\nthe hot gas corona, and the tilting rate. {\\it Gaia} is likely to be able to\ndirectly measure tilting in the MW. Such a detection will provide an important\nconstraint on the environment of the MW, including the rate of gas cooling onto\nthe disc, the shape and orientation of its dark matter halo, and the mass of\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud. Conversely, failure to detect tilting may suggest\nthe MW is in a very quiet configuration.\n", "  We introduce a new methodology for the direct extraction of galaxy physical\nparameters from multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy. We use\nsemi-analytic models that describe galaxy evolution in the context of large\nscale cosmological simulation to provide a catalog of galaxies, star formation\nhistories, and physical parameters. We then apply stellar population synthesis\nmodels and a simple extinction model to calculate the observable broad-band\nfluxes and spectral indices for these galaxies. We use a linear regression\nanalysis to relate physical parameters to observed colors and spectral indices.\nThe result is a set of coefficients that can be used to translate observed\ncolors and indices into stellar mass, star formation rate, and many other\nparameters, including the instantaneous time derivative of the star formation\nrate which we denote the {\\it Star Formation Acceleration (SFA)}, We apply the\nmethod to a test sample of galaxies with GALEX photometry and SDSS\nspectroscopy, deriving relationships between stellar mass, specific star\nformation rate, and star formation acceleration. We find evidence for a\nmass-dependent SFA in the green valley, with low mass galaxies showing greater\nquenching and higher mass galaxies greater bursting. We also find evidence for\nan increase in average quenching in galaxies hosting AGN. A simple scenario in\nwhich lower mass galaxies accrete and become satellite galaxies, having their\nstar forming gas tidally and/or ram-pressure stripped, while higher mass\ngalaxies receive this gas and react with new star formation can qualitatively\nexplain our results.\n", "  The solar analogs of M67 let us glimpse the probable behavior of the Sun on\ntime scales surpassing the duration of human civilization. M67 can serve as a\nsolar proxy because its stars share a similar age and composition with the Sun.\nPrevious surveys of M67 observed that 15% of its Sun-like stars exhibited\nchromospheric activity levels below solar minimum, which suggest that these\nstars might be in activity-minimum states analogous to the Maunder Minimum. The\nactivity diagnostic used, the HK index (relative intensities of the Ca II H&K\nlines integrated over 1 Ang. bandpasses), was measured from low-resolution\nspectra ($R\\approx 5000$), as is traditional and suitable for nearby, bright\nstars. However, for stars beyond the Local Bubble, the interstellar medium\n(ISM) imprints absorption lines in spectra at Ca II H&K, which negatively bias\nactivity measurements when these lines fall within the HK index bandpass. I\nmodel the ISM clouds in the M67 foreground with high-resolution spectra of blue\nstragglers and solar analogs. I demonstrate that ISM absorption varies across\nthe cluster and must be accounted for on a star-by-star basis. I then apply the\nISM model to a solar spectrum and broaden it to the lower spectral resolution\nemployed by prior surveys. Comparing HK indices measured from ISM-free and\nISM-contaminated spectra, I find that all stars observed below solar minimum\ncan be explained by this ISM bias. I conclude that there is no compelling\nevidence for Maunder minimum candidates in M67 at this time.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the high-redshift Universe are thought to\nreside in overdense environments. However, recent works provide controversial\nresults partly due to the use of different techniques and possible suppression\nof nearby galaxy formation by AGN feedback. We conducted deep and wide-field\nimaging observations with the Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope and searched\nfor Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) around two QSOs (quasi-stellar objects) at\n$z\\sim4.9$ and a radio galaxy at $z\\sim4.5$ by using narrow-band filters to\naddress these issues more robustly. In the QSO fields, we obtained additional\nbroad-band images to select Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at $z\\sim5$ for\ncomparison. We constructed a photometric sample of 301 LAEs and 170 LBGs in\ntotal. A wide field of view (34arcmin$\\times$27arcmin, corresponding to\n80$\\times$60 comoving Mpc$^2$) of the Suprime-Cam enabled us to probe galaxies\nin the immediate vicinities of the AGNs and in the blank fields simultaneously\nand compare various properties of them in a consistent manner. The two QSOs are\nlocated near local density peaks ($<2\\sigma$) and one of the QSOs has a close\ncompanion LAE with projected separation of 80 physical kpc. The radio galaxy is\nfound to be near a void of LAEs. The number densities of LAEs/LGBs in a larger\nspatial scale around the AGNs are not significantly different from those in\nblank fields. No sign of feedback is found down to\n$L_{Ly\\alpha}\\sim10^{41.8}\\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}}$. Our results suggest that\nhigh-redshift AGNs are not associated with extreme galaxy overdensity and that\nthis cannot be attributed to the effect of AGN feedback.\n", "  In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the\nlarge-amplitude longitudinal oscillations of a filament on 2015 May 3. Located\nnext to active region 12335, the sigmoidal filament was observed by the\nground-based H$\\alpha$ telescopes from GONG and by AIA aboard SDO. The filament\noscillations were most probably triggered by the magnetic reconnection in the\nfilament channel. The directions of oscillations have angles of\n4$^\\circ$-36$^\\circ$ with respect to the filament axis. The whole filament did\nnot oscillate in phase as a rigid body. Meanwhile, the periods (3100$-$4400 s)\nof oscillations have a spatial dependence. The values of $R$ are estimated to\nbe 69.4$-$133.9 Mm, and the minimum transverse magnetic field of the dips is\nestimated to be 15 G. The amplitudes of S5-S8 grew with time, while the\namplitudes of S9-S14 damped with time. The amplitudes of oscillations range\nfrom a few to ten Mm, and the maximal velocity can reach 30 km s$^{-1}$.\nInterestingly, the filament experienced mass drainage southwards at a speed of\n$\\sim$27 km s$^{-1}$. The oscillations continued after the mass drainage and\nlasted for more than 11 hr. After the mass drainage, the phases of oscillations\ndid not change a lot. The periods of S5-S8 decreased, while the periods of\nS9-S14 increased. The amplitudes of S5$-$S8 damped with time, while the\namplitudes of S9-S14 grew. Most of the damping (growing) ratios are between -9\nand 14. We propose a schematic cartoon to explain the complex behaviors of\noscillations by introducing thread-thread interaction.\n", "  We report on 2.4 yr of radio timing measurements of the magnetar PSR\nJ1622$-$4950 using the Parkes telescope, between 2011 November and 2014 March.\nDuring this period the torque on the neutron star (inferred from the rotational\nfrequency derivative) varied greatly, though much less erratically than in the\n2 yr following its discovery in 2009. During the last year of our measurements\nthe frequency derivative decreased in magnitude monotonically by 20\\%, to a\nvalue of $-1.3\\times10^{-13}$ s$^{-2}$, a factor of 8 smaller than when\ndiscovered. The flux density continued to vary greatly during our monitoring\nthrough 2014 March, reaching a relatively steady low level after late 2012. The\npulse profile varied secularly on a similar timescale as the flux density and\ntorque. A relatively rapid transition in all three properties is evident in\nearly 2013. After PSR J1622$-$4950 was detected in all of our 87 observations\nup to 2014 March, we did not detect the magnetar in our resumed monitoring\nstarting in 2015 January and have not detected it in any of the 30 observations\ndone through 2016 September.\n", "  The 20kt Liquid Scintillator (LS) JUNO detector is being constructed by the\nInternational Collaboration in China, with the primary goal of addressing the\nquestion of neutrino mass ordering (hierarchy). The main challenge for JUNO is\nto achieve a record energy resolution, ~3% at 1MeV of energy released in the\nLS, which is required to perform the neutrino mass hierarchy determination.\nAbout 20 000 large 20-inch PMTs with high Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) and\ngood photocathode uniformity will ensure an approximately 80% surface coverage\nof the JUNO detector. The JUNO collaboration is preparing equipment for the\nmass tests of all PMTs using 4 dedicated containers. This approach allows us to\ntest 144 PMTs in parallel. The primary measurement in the container will be the\nPMT response to illumination of its photocathode by a low-intensity uniform\nlight. Each of the 20 000 PMTs will undergo the container test. Additionally, a\ndedicated scanning system was constructed for sampled tests of PMTs that allows\nus to study the variation of the PDE over the entire PMT photocathode surface.\nThe core of the scanning station is a rotating frame with 7 LED sources of\ncalibrated short light flashes that are placed along the photocathode surface\ncovering zenith angles from the top of a PMT to its equator. The collection\nefficiency of a large PMT is known to be very sensitive to the Earth Magnetic\nField (EMF), therefore, understanding the necessary level of EMF suppression is\ncrucial for the JUNO Experiment. A dark room with Helmholtz coils compensating\nthe EMF components is available for these tests at a JUNO facility. The\nHamamatsu R12860 20-inch PMT is a candidate for the JUNO experiment. In this\narticle the container design and mass-testing method, the scanning setup and\nscanning method are briefly described and preliminary results for performance\ntest of this PMT are reported.\n", "  The signatures of energy release and energy transport for a kink-unstable\ncoronal flux rope are investigated via forward modelling. Synthetic intensity\nand Doppler maps are generated from a 3D numerical simulation. The CHIANTI\ndatabase is used to compute intensities for three Hinode/EIS emission lines\nthat cover the thermal range of the loop. The intensities and Doppler\nvelocities at simulation resolution are spatially degraded to the Hinode/EIS\npixel size (1\\arcsec), convolved using a Gaussian point-spread function\n(3\\arcsec), and exposed for a characteristic time of 50 seconds. The synthetic\nimages generated for rasters (moving slit) and sit-and-stare (stationary slit)\nare analysed to find the signatures of the twisted flux and the associated\ninstability. We find that there are several qualities of a kink-unstable\ncoronal flux rope that can be detected observationally using Hinode/EIS, namely\nthe growth of the loop radius, the increase in intensity towards the radial\nedge of the loop, and the Doppler velocity following an internal twisted\nmagnetic field line. However, EIS cannot resolve the small, transient features\npresent in the simulation, such as sites of small-scale reconnection (e.g.\nnanoflares)\n", "  We propose here a setup to generate and evaluate the entanglement between two\nmechanical resonators in a cavity optomechanical setting. As in previous\nproposals, our scheme includes two driving pumps allowing for the generation of\ntwo-mode mechanical squeezing. In addition, we include here four additional\nprobing tones, which allow for the separate evaluation of the collective\nmechanical quadratures required to estimate the Duan quantity, thus allowing us\nto infer whether the mechanical resonators are entangled.\n", "  Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been observed towards several low-mass\nyoung stellar objects (LYSOs). Small and heterogeneous samples have so far\nprecluded conclusions on typical COM abundances, as well as the origin(s) of\nabundance variations between sources. We present observations towards 16 deeply\nembedded (Class 0/I) low-mass protostars using the IRAM 30m telescope. We\ndetect CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$CN, HNCO, and\nHC$_3$N towards 67%, 37%, 13%, 13%, 44%, 81%, and 75% of sources respectively.\nMedian column densities derived using survival analysis range between\n6.0x10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ (CH$_3$CN) and 2.4x10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ (CH$_3$OCH$_3$)\nand median abundances range between 0.48% (CH$_3$CN) and 16% (HNCO) with\nrespect to CH$_3$OH. Column densities for each molecule vary by about one order\nof magnitude across the sample. Abundances with respect to CH$_3$OH are more\nnarrowly distributed, especially for oxygen-bearing species. We compare\nobserved median abundances with a chemical model for low-mass protostars and\nfind fair agreement, although some modeling work remains to bring abundances\nhigher with respect to CH$_3$OH. Median abundances with respect to CH$_3$OH in\nLYSOs are also found to be generally comparable to observed abundances in hot\ncores, hot corinos, and massive young stellar objects. Compared with comets,\nour sample is comparable for all molecules except HC$_3$N and CH$_2$CO, which\nlikely become depleted at later evolutionary stages.\n", "  We present the first three-dimensional measurements of the velocity of\nvarious ejecta knots in Tycho's supernova remnant, known to result from a Type\nIa explosion. Chandra X-ray observations over a 12-year baseline from 2003 to\n2015 allow us to measure the proper motion of nearly 60 \"tufts\" of Si-rich\nejecta, giving us the velocity in the plane of the sky. For the line of sight\nvelocity, we use two different methods: a non-equilibrium ionization model fit\nto the strong Si and S lines in the 1.2-2.8 keV regime, and a fit consisting of\na series of Gaussian lines. These methods give consistent results, allowing us\nto determine the red or blue shift of each of the knots. Assuming a distance of\n3.5 kpc, we find total velocities that range from 2400 to 6600 km s$^{-1}$,\nwith a mean of 4430 km s$^{-1}$. We find several regions where the ejecta knots\nhave overtaken the forward shock. These regions have proper motions in excess\nof 6000 km s$^{-1}$. Some Type Ia supernova explosion models predict a velocity\nasymmetry in the ejecta. We find no such velocity asymmetries in Tycho, and\ndiscuss our findings in light of various explosion models, favoring those\ndelayed detonation models with relatively vigorous and symmetrical\ndeflagrations. Finally, we compare measurements with models of the remnant's\nevolution that include both smooth and clumpy ejecta profiles, finding that\nboth ejecta profiles can be accommodated by the observations.\n", "  We present a new matched filter algorithm for direct detection of point\nsources in the immediate vicinity of bright stars. The stellar Point Spread\nFunction (PSF) is first subtracted using a Karhunen-Lo\\'eve Image Processing\n(KLIP) algorithm with Angular and Spectral Differential Imaging (ADI and SDI).\nThe KLIP-induced distortion of the astrophysical signal is included in the\nmatched filter template by computing a forward model of the PSF at every\nposition in the image. To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct\nextensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra\ntemplate and KLIP reduction aggressiveness to maximize the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR) of the recovered planets. We show that only two spectral templates\nare necessary to recover any young Jovian exoplanets with minimal SNR loss. We\nalso developed a complete pipeline for the automated detection of point source\ncandidates, the calculation of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), false\npositives based contrast curves, and completeness contours. We process in a\nuniform manner more than 330 datasets from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet\nSurvey (GPIES) and assess GPI typical sensitivity as a function of the star and\nthe hypothetical companion spectral type. This work allows for the first time a\ncomparison of different detection algorithms at a survey scale accounting for\nboth planet completeness and false positive rate. We show that the new forward\nmodel matched filter allows the detection of $50\\%$ fainter objects than a\nconventional cross-correlation technique with a Gaussian PSF template for the\nsame false positive rate.\n", "  We present ALMA mosaic observations at 1.3 mm (223 GHz) of the Fomalhaut\nsystem with a sensitivity of 14 $\\mu$Jy/beam. These observations provide the\nfirst millimeter map of the continuum dust emission from the complete outer\ndebris disk with uniform sensitivity, enabling the first conclusive detection\nof apocenter glow. We adopt a MCMC modeling approach that accounts for the\neccentric orbital parameters of a collection of particles within the disk. The\nouter belt is radially confined with an inner edge of $136.3\\pm0.9$ AU and\nwidth of $13.5\\pm1.8$ AU. We determine a best-fit eccentricity of\n$0.12\\pm0.01$. Assuming a size distribution power law index of $q=3.46\\pm\n0.09$, we constrain the dust absorptivity power law index $\\beta$ to be\n$0.9<\\beta<1.5$. The geometry of the disk is robustly constrained with\ninclination $65.\\!\\!^\\circ6\\pm0.\\!\\!^\\circ3$, position angle\n$337.\\!\\!^\\circ9\\pm0.\\!\\!^\\circ3$, and argument of periastron\n$22.\\!\\!^\\circ5\\pm4.\\!\\!^\\circ3$. Our observations do not confirm any of the\nazimuthal features found in previous imaging studies of the disk with HST,\nSCUBA, and ALMA. However, we cannot rule out structures $\\leq10$ AU in size or\nwhich only affect smaller grains. The central star is clearly detected with a\nflux density of $0.75\\pm0.02$ mJy, significantly lower than predicted by\ncurrent photospheric models. We discuss the implications of these observations\nfor the directly imaged Fomalhaut b and the inner dust belt detected at\ninfrared wavelengths.\n", "  Recent ALMA observations present mounting evidence for the presence of\nexocometary gas released within Kuiper belt analogues around nearby main\nsequence stars. This represents a unique opportunity to study their ice\nreservoir at the younger ages when volatile delivery to planets is most likely\nto occur. We here present the detection of CO J=2-1 emission co-located with\ndust emission from the cometary belt in the 440 Myr-old Fomalhaut system.\nThrough spectro-spatial filtering, we achieve a 5.4$\\sigma$ detection and\ndetermine that the ring's sky-projected rotation axis matches that of the star.\nThe CO mass derived ($0.65-42 \\times10^{-7}$ M$_{\\oplus}$) is the lowest of any\ncircumstellar disk detected to date, and must be of exocometary origin. Using a\nsteady state model, we estimate the CO+CO$_2$ mass fraction of exocomets around\nFomalhaut to be between 4.6-76%, consistent with Solar System comets and the\ntwo other belts known to host exocometary gas. This is the first indication of\na similarity in cometary compositions across planetary systems that may be\nlinked to their formation scenario and is consistent with direct ISM\ninheritance. In addition, we find tentative evidence that $(49\\pm 27)$% of the\ndetected flux originates from a region near the eccentric belt's pericentre. If\nconfirmed, the latter may be explained through a recent impact event or CO\npericentre glow due to exocometary release within a steady state collisional\ncascade. In the latter scenario, we show how the azimuthal dependence of the CO\nrelease rate leads to asymmetries in gas observations of eccentric exocometary\nbelts.\n", "  The Dark Matter Time Projection Chamber (DMTPC) is a direction-sensitive\ndetector designed to measure the direction of recoiling $^{19}$F and $^{12}$C\nnuclei in low-pressure CF$_4$ gas using optical and charge readout systems. In\nthis paper, we employ measurements from two DMTPC detectors, with operating\npressures of 30-60 torr, to develop and validate a model of the directional\nresponse and performance of such detectors as a function of recoil energy.\nUsing our model as a benchmark, we formulate the necessary specifications for a\nscalable directional detector with sensitivity comparable to that of\ncurrent-generation counting (non-directional) experiments, which measure only\nrecoil energy. Assuming the performance of existing DMTPC detectors, as well as\ncurrent limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleus cross section, we find that a\n10-20 kg scale direction-sensitive detector is capable of correlating the\nmeasured direction of nuclear recoils with the predicted direction of incident\ndark matter particles and providing decisive (3$\\sigma$) confirmation that a\ncandidate signal from a non-directional experiment was indeed induced by\nelastic scattering of dark matter particles off of target nuclei.\n", "  In this paper we collect 19 hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernovae\n(SLSNe) and fit their light curves, temperature evolution, and velocity\nevolution based on the magnetar-powered model. To obtain the best-fitting\nparameters, we incorporate the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We get rather\ngood fits for 7 events ($\\chi^2$/d.o.f = $0.24-0.96$) and good fits for other 7\nevents ($\\chi^2$/d.o.f = $1.37-3.13$). We find that the initial periods\n($P_{0}$) and magnetic strength ($B_{p}$) of the magnetars supposed to power\nthese SLSNe are in the range of $\\sim 1.2-8.3$ ms and $\\sim (0.2-8.8)\\times\n10^{14}\\,$G, respectively; the inferred masses of the ejecta of these SLSNe are\nbetween 1 and 27.6 $M_{\\odot }$, and the values of the gamma-ray opacity\n$\\kappa_{\\gamma }$ are between 0.01 and 0.82 cm$^2$ ~g$^{-1}$. We also\ncalculate the fraction of the initial rotational energy of the magnetars\nharbored in the centers of the remnants of these SLSNe that is converted to the\nkinetic energy of the ejecta and find that the fraction is $\\sim 19-97$ for\ndifferent values of $P_{0}$ and $B_{p}$, indicating that the acceleration\neffect cannot be neglected. Moreover, we find that the initial kinetic energies\nof most of these SLSNe are so small ($\\lesssim 2\\times 10^{51}$ erg) that they\ncan be easily explained by the neutrino-driven mechanism. These results can\nhelp clarify some important issues related to the energy-source mechanisms and\nexplosion mechanisms and reveal the nature of SLSNe.\n", "  We present an analysis of the positions and ages of young star clusters in\neight local galaxies to investigate the connection between the age difference\nand separation of cluster pairs. We find that star clusters do not form\nuniformly but instead are distributed such that the age difference increases\nwith the cluster pair separation to the 0.25-0.6 power, and that the maximum\nsize over which star formation is physically correlated ranges from ~200 pc to\n~1 kpc. The observed trends between age difference and separation suggest that\ncluster formation is hierarchical both in space and time: clusters that are\nclose to each other are more similar in age than clusters born further apart.\nThe temporal correlations between stellar aggregates have slopes that are\nconsistent with turbulence acting as the primary driver of star formation. The\nvelocity associated with the maximum size is proportional to the galaxy's\nshear, suggesting that the galactic environment influences the maximum size of\nthe star-forming structures.\n", "  Recent work suggests that strong emission line, star-forming galaxies may be\nsignificant Lyman Continuum leakers. We combine archival HST broadband\nultraviolet and optical imaging (F275W and F606W, respectively) with emission\nline catalogs derived from WFC3 IR G141 grism spectroscopy to search for\nescaping Lyman Continuum (LyC) emission from homogeneously selected\n$z\\simeq$2.5 SFGs. We detect no escaping Lyman Continuum from SFGs selected on\n[OII] nebular emission (N=208) and, within a narrow redshift range, on\n[OIII]/[OII]. We measure 1$\\sigma$ upper limits to the LyC escape fraction\nrelative to the non-ionizing UV continuum from [OII] emitters, $f_{esc}<$5.6%,\nand strong [OIII]/[OII]$>$5 ELGs, $f_{esc}<$14.0%. Our observations are not\ndeep enough to detect $f_{esc}\\lesssim$10% typical of the low redshift Lyman\ncontinuum emitters. However, we find that this population represents a small\nfraction of the star-forming galaxy population at $z\\simeq$2. Thus, unless the\nnumber of extreme emission line galaxies grows substantially to z$>$6, such\ngalaxies may be insufficient for reionization. Deeper survey data in the\nrest-frame ionizing UV will be necessary to determine whether strong line\nratios could be useful for pre-selecting LyC leakers at high redshift.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) polarization observations at\n97.5 GHz of the southern hot spot of the radio galaxy 3C 445. The hot spot\nstructure is dominated by two bright components enshrouded by diffuse emission.\nBoth components show fractional polarization between 30 and 40 per cent,\nsuggesting the presence of shocks. The polarized emission of the western\ncomponent has a displacement of about 0.5 kpc outward with respect to the total\nintensity emission, and may trace the surface of a front shock. Strong\npolarization is observed in a thin strip marking the ridge of the hot spot\nstructure visible from radio to optical. No significant polarization is\ndetected in the diffuse emission between the main components, suggesting a\nhighly disordered magnetic field likely produced by turbulence and\ninstabilities in the downstream region that may be at the origin of the\nextended optical emission observed in this hot spot. The polarization\nproperties support a scenario in which a combination of both multiple and\nintermittent shock fronts due to jet dithering, and spatially distributed\nstochastic second-order Fermi acceleration processes are present in the hot\nspot complex.\n", "  We consider $d\\geqslant 4$ Einstein--(extended-)Yang-Mills theory, where the\ngauge sector is augmented by higher order terms. Linearizing the (extended)\nYang-Mills equations on the background of the electric Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\n(RN) black hole, we show the existence of normalizable zero modes, dubbed\nnon-Abelian magnetic stationary clouds. The non-linear realization of these\nclouds bifurcates the RN family into a branch of static, spherically symmetric,\nelectrically charged and asymptotically flat black holes with non-Abelian hair.\nGenerically, the hairy black holes are thermodynamically preferred over the RN\nsolution, which, in this model, becomes unstable against the formation of\nnon-Abelian hair, for sufficiently large values of the electric charge.\n", "  We report C, N, and Si isotopic data for 59 highly 13C-enriched presolar\nsubmicron- to micron-sized SiC grains from the Murchison meteorite, including\neight putative nova grains (PNGs) and 29 15N-rich (14N/15N<=solar) AB grains,\nand their Mg-Al, S, and Ca-Ti isotope data when available. These 37 grains are\nenriched in 13C, 15N and 26Al with the PNGs showing more extreme enhancements.\nThe 15N-rich AB grains show systematically higher 26Al and 30Si excesses than\nthe 14N-rich AB grains. Thus, we propose to divide the AB grains into groups 1\n(14N/15N<solar) and 2 (14N/15N>=solar). For the first time, we have obtained\nboth S and Ti isotopic data for five AB1 grains and one PNG, and found 32S\nand/or 50Ti enhancements. Interestingly, one AB1 grain had the largest 32S and\n50Ti excesses, strongly suggesting a neutron-capture nucleosynthetic origin of\nthe 32S excess and thus the initial presence of radiogenic 32Si (t1/2=153 yr).\nMore importantly, we found that the 15N and 26Al excesses of AB1 grains form a\ntrend that extends to the region in the N-Al isotope plot occupied by C2\ngrains, strongly indicating a common stellar origin for both AB1 and C2 grains.\nComparison of supernova models with the AB1 and C2 grain data indicates that\nthese grains came from SNe that experienced H ingestion into the He/C zones of\ntheir progenitors.\n", "  We present the effects of ordered large scale magnetic field on the structure\nof supercritical accretion flow in the presence of outflow. In the cylindrical\ncoordinates ($r, \\varphi,z$), We write the 1.5 dimensional, the steady state\n($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}=0$) and axisymmetric ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\n\\varphi}=0$) inflow-outflow equations by using the self similar solutions. Also\na model for radiation pressure supported accretion flow threaded by both\ntoroidal and vertical components of magnetic field has been formulated.\n  For studying the outflows, we adopt a radius dependent mass accretion rate as\n$\\dot{M}=\\dot{M}_{out}{(\\frac{r}{r_{out}})^{s+\\frac{1}{2}}}$ with\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$. Also by following the previous works, we have considered the\ninterchange of mass, radial and angular momentum and the energy between inflow\nand outflow. we have found numerically that two components of magnetic field\nhave the opposite effects on the thickness of the disc and similar effects on\nthe radial and angular velocities of the flow. We have found that the existence\nof the toroidal component of magnetic field will lead to increasing of radial\nand azimuthal velocities as well as the relative thickness of the disc, which\nis increased . Moreover, the thickness of the disc will decrease when the\nvertical component of magnetic field becomes important in magnetized flow. The\nsolutions indicated that the mass inflow rate, the specific energy of outflow\naffect strongly on the advection parameter.We have shown that by increasing the\ntwo components of magnetic field, the temperature of the accretion flow will\ndecrease significantly. On the other hand we have shown the bolometric\nluminosity of the slim discs for high values of $\\dot{m} (\\dot{m}>>1)$ is not\nsensitive to mass accretion rate and is kept constant ($L \\approx 10 L_{E}$).\n", "  We present a general approach to speed up the adiabatic process without\nadding the traditional counterdiabatic driving (CD) Hamiltonian. The strategy\nis to design an easy-to-get intermediate Hamiltonian to connect the original\nHamiltonian and final transitionless Hamiltonian. With final transitionless\nHamiltonian, the same target can be achieved as in the adiabatic process\ngoverned by the original Hamiltonian, but in a shorter time. We apply the\npresent approach to a three-level system, and the result shows that the final\ntransitionless Hamiltonian usually has the same structure as the original\nHamiltonian but with different time-dependent coefficients, allowing speedup to\nbe achieved in a much easier way compared to previous methods.\n", "  Propagation character of spin wave was investigated for chiral magnets FeGe\nand Co-Zn-Mn alloys, which can host magnetic skyrmions near room temperature.\nOn the basis of the frequency shift between counter-propagating spin waves, the\nmagnitude and sign of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction were directly\nevaluated. The obtained magnetic parameters quantitatively account for the size\nand helicity of skyrmions as well as their materials variation, proving that\nthe DM interaction plays a decisive role in the skyrmion formation in this\nclass of room-temperature chiral magnets. The propagating spin-wave\nspectroscopy can thus be an efficient tool to study DM interaction in bulk\nsingle-phase compounds. Our results also demonstrate a function of spin-wave\ndiode based on chiral crystal structures at room temperature.\n", "  We introduce Deligne cohomology that classifies U(1) fibre bundles over\n3-manifolds endowed with connections. We show how the structure of Deligne\ncohomology classes provides a way to perform exact (non-perturbative)\ncomputations in U(1) Chern-Simons theory (resp. BF theory) at the level of\nfunctional integrals. The partition functions (and observables) of these\ntheories are strongly related to topological invariants well-known by the\nmathematicians.\n", "  Internal chemical abundance spreads are one of fundamental properties of\nglobular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy. In order to understand the origin of\nsuch abundance spreads, we numerically investigate GC formation from massive\nmolecular clouds (MCs) with fractal structures using our new hydrodynamical\nsimulations with star formation and feedback effects of supernovae (SNe) and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within\nthe central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta\nis rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by\nSNe of the stars themselves. This result implies that the so-called mass budget\nproblem is much more severe than ever thought in the self-enrichment scenario\nof GC formation. and thus that IMF for the second generation of stars should be\n`top-light'.\n", "  The outstanding optoelectronics and photovoltaic properties of metal halide\nperovskites, including high carrier motilities, low carrier recombination\nrates, and the tunable spectral absorption range are attributed to the unique\nelectronic properties of these materials. While DFT provides reliable\nstructures and stabilities of perovskites, it performs poorly in electronic\nstructure prediction. The relativistic GW approximation has been demonstrated\nto be able to capture electronic structure accurately, but at an extremely high\ncomputational cost. Here we report efficient and accurate band gap calculations\nof halide metal perovskites by using the approximate quasiparticle DFT-1/2\nmethod. Using AMX3 (A = CH3NH3, CH2NHCH2, Cs; M = Pb, Sn, X=I, Br, Cl) as\ndemonstration, the influence of the crystal structure (cubic, tetragonal or\northorhombic), variation of ions (different A, M and X) and relativistic\neffects on the electronic structure are systematically studied and compared\nwith experimental results. Our results show that the DFT-1/2 method yields\naccurate band gaps with the precision of the GW method with no more\ncomputational cost than standard DFT. This opens the possibility of accurate\nelectronic structure prediction of sophisticated halide perovskite structures\nand new materials design for lead-free materials.\n", "  An analysis of the Type Ic supernova (SN) 2004aw is performed by means of\nmodels of the photospheric and nebular spectra and of the bolometric light\ncurve. SN2004aw is shown not to be ``broad-lined'', contrary to previous\nclaims, but rather a ``fast-lined'' SN Ic. The spectral resemblance to the\nnarrow-lined Type Ic SN1994I, combined with the strong nebular [O I] emission\nand the broad light curve, point to a moderately energetic explosion of a\nmassive C+O star. The ejected 56Ni mass is ~0.2 Msun. The ejecta mass as\nconstrained by the models is ~3-5 Msun, while the kinetic energy is estimated\nas KE ~3-6 e51 ergs. The ratio KE/Mej, the specific energy which influences the\nshape of the spectrum, is therefore ~1. The corresponding zero-age\nmain-sequence mass of the progenitor star may have been ~23-28 Msun. Tests show\nthat a flatter outer density structure may have caused a broad-lined spectrum\nat epochs before those observed without affecting the later epochs when data\nare available, implying that our estimate of KE is a lower limit. SN2004aw may\nhave been powered by either a collapsar or a magnetar, both of which have been\nproposed for gamma-ray burst-supernovae. Evidence for this is seen in the\ninnermost layers, which appear to be highly aspherical as suggested by the\nnebular line profiles. However, any engine was not extremely powerful, as the\nouter ejecta are more consistent with a spherical explosion and no gamma-ray\nburst was detected in coincidence with SN2004aw.\n", "  We explore the hypothesis that the Eureka family of sub-km asteroids in the\nL5 region of Mars could have formed in a collision. We estimate the size\ndistribution index from available information on family members; model the\norbital dispersion of collisional fragments; and carry out a formal calculation\nof the collisional lifetime as a function of size. We find that, as initially\nconjectured by Rivkin et al (2003), the collisional lifetime of objects the\nsize of (5261) Eureka is at least a few Gyr, significantly longer than for\nsimilar-sized Main Belt asteroids. In contrast, the observed degree of orbital\ncompactness is inconsistent with all but the least energetic family-forming\ncollisions. Therefore, the family asteroids may be ejecta from a cratering\nevent sometime in the past ~1 Gyr if the orbits are gradually dispersed by\ngravitational diffusion and the Yarkovsky effect (Cuk et al, 2015). The\ncomparable sizes of the largest family members require either negligible target\nstrength or a particular impact geometry under this scenario (Durda et al,\n2007; Benavidez et al, 2012). Alternatively, the family may have formed by a\nseries of YORP-induced fission events (Pravec.et.al, 2010). The shallow size\ndistribution of the family is similar to that of small MBAs (Gladman et al,\n2009) interpreted as due to the dominance of this mechanism for\nEureka-family-sized asteroids (Jacobson et al, 2014). However, our population\nindex estimate is likely a lower limit due to the small available number of\nfamily asteroids and observational incompleteness. Future searches for fainter\nfamily members, further observational characterisation of the known Trojans'\nphysical properties as well as orbital and rotational evolution modelling will\nhelp distinguish between different formation models.\n", "  We report the discovery of kpc-scale diffuse emission in both the hard\ncontinuum (3-6 keV) and in the Fe K alpha line in the Compton Thick (CT)\nSeyfert galaxy ESO428-G014. This extended hard component contains at least ~24%\nof the observed 3-8 keV emission, and follows the direction of the extended\noptical line emission (ionization cone) and radio jet. The extended hard\ncomponent has ~0.5% of the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity within the bi-cones. A\nuniform scattering medium of density 1 cm-3 would produce this luminosity in a\n1kpc path length in the bi-cones. Alternatively, higher column density\nmolecular clouds in the disk of ESO428-G014 may be responsible for these\ncomponents. The continuum may also be enhanced by the acceleration of charged\nparticles in the radio jet. The steeper spectrum (Gamma ~1.7 +-0.4) of the hard\ncontinuum outside of the central 1.5\" radius nuclear region suggests a\ncontribution of scattered/fluorescent intrinsic Seyfert emission. Ultrafast\nnuclear outflows cannot explain the extended F K alpha emission. This discovery\nsuggests that we may need to revise the picture at the base of our\ninterpretation of CT AGN spectra.\n", "  NGC 5986 is a poorly studied but relatively massive Galactic globular cluster\nthat shares several physical and morphological characteristics with\n\"iron-complex\" clusters known to exhibit significant metallicity and heavy\nelement dispersions. In order to determine if NGC 5986 joins the iron-complex\ncluster class, we investigated the chemical composition of 25 red giant branch\nand asymptotic giant branch cluster stars using high resolution spectra\nobtained with the Magellan-M2FS instrument. Cluster membership was verified\nusing a combination of radial velocity and [Fe/H] measurements, and we found\nthe cluster to have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of +99.76 km s^-1\n(sigma = 7.44 km s^-1). We derived a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.54 dex\n(sigma = 0.08 dex), but the cluster's small dispersion in [Fe/H] and low\n[La/Eu] abundance preclude it from being an iron-complex cluster. NGC 5986 has\n<[Eu/Fe]> = +0.76 dex (sigma = 0.08 dex), which is among the highest ratios\ndetected in a Galactic cluster. NGC 5986 exhibits classical globular cluster\ncharacteristics, such as uniformly enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, a small\ndispersion in Fe-peak abundances, and (anti-)correlated light element\nvariations. Similar to NGC 2808, we find evidence that NGC 5986 may host at\nleast 4-5 populations with distinct light element compositions, and the\npresence of a clear Mg-Al anti-correlation along with an Al-Si correlation\nsuggests that the cluster gas experienced processing at temperatures >65-70 MK.\nHowever, the current data do not support burning temperatures exceeding ~100\nMK. We find some evidence that the first and second generation stars in NGC\n5986 may be fully spatially mixed, which could indicate that the cluster has\nlost a significant fraction of its original mass. [abridged]\n", "  Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have recently emerged as\npossible candidates for valleytronic applications, as the spin and valley\npseudospin are directly coupled and stabilized by a large spin splitting. In\nthese semiconducting materials, optically excited electron-hole pairs form\ntightly Coulomb-bound excitons with large binding energies. The selection rules\nfor excitonic transitions allow for direct optical generation of a\nvalley-polarized exciton population using resonant excitation. Here, we\ninvestigate the exciton valley dynamics in monolayers of three different TMDCs\nby means of time-resolved Kerr rotation at low temperatures. We observe\npronounced differences in the valley dynamics of tungsten- and molybdenum-based\nTMDCs, which are directly related to the opposite order of the conduction-band\nspin splitting in these materials.\n", "  We consider the sloshing problem for an incompressible, inviscid,\nirrotational fluid in an open container, including effects due to surface\ntension on the free surface. We restrict ourselves to a constant contact angle\nand seek time-harmonic solutions of the linearized problem, which describes the\ntime-evolution of the fluid due to a small initial disturbance of the surface\nat rest. As opposed to the zero surface tension case, where the problem reduces\nto a partial differential equation for the velocity potential, we obtain a\ncoupled system for the velocity potential and the free surface displacement. We\nderive a new variational formulation of the coupled problem and establish the\nexistence of solutions using the direct method from the calculus of variations.\nWe prove a domain monotonicity result for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue.\nIn the limit of zero surface tension, we recover the variational formulation of\nthe mixed Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue problem and give the first-order\nperturbation formula for a simple eigenvalue.\n", "  CLIC is a proposed linear e+e- collider designed to provide particle\ncollisions at center-of-mass energies of up to 3 TeV. Precise measurements of\nthe properties of the top quark and the Higgs boson, as well as searches for\nBeyond the Standard Model physics require a highly performant CLIC detector. In\nparticular the vertex detector must provide a single point resolution of only a\nfew micrometers while not exceeding the envisaged material budget of around\n0.2% X0 per layer. Beam-beam interactions and beamstrahlung processes impose an\nadditional requirement on the timestamping capabilities of the vertex detector\nof about 10 ns. These goals can only be met by using novel techniques in the\nsensor and ASIC design as well as in the detector construction.\n  The R\\&D program for the CLIC vertex detector explores various technologies\nin order to meet these demands. The feasibility of planar sensors with a\nthickness of 50-150 um, including different active edge designs, are evaluated\nusing Timepix3 ASICs. First prototypes of the CLICpix readout ASIC, implemented\nin 65 nm CMOS technology and with a pixel size of 25x25 um^2, have been\nproduced and tested in particle beams. An updated version of the ASIC with a\nlarger pixel matrix and improved precision of the time-over-threshold and\ntime-of-arrival measurements has been submitted. Different hybridization\nconcepts have been developed for the interconnection between the sensor and\nreadout ASIC, ranging from small-pitch bump bonding of planar sensors to\ncapacitive coupling of active HV-CMOS sensors. Detector simulations based on\nGeant4 and TCAD are compared with experimental results to assess and optimize\nthe performance of the various designs.\n  This contribution gives an overview of the R&D program undertaken for the\nCLIC vertex detector and presents performance measurements of the prototype\ndetectors currently under investigation.\n", "  Previously unrecognized weak emission lines originating from high excitation\nstates of Si II (12.84 eV) and Al II (13.08 eV) are detected in the red region\nspectra of slowly rotating early B-type stars. We surveyed high resolution\nspectra of 35 B-type stars covering spectral sub-types between B1 and B7 near\nthe main sequence and found the emission line of SiII at 6239.6 A in all 13\nstars having spectral sub-types B2 and B2.5. There are 17 stars belonging to\nsub-type B3 and seven stars among them are found to show the emission line of\nSi II. The emission line of Al II at 6243.4 A is detected in a narrower\ntemperature range (Teff between 19000K and 23000 K) in nine stars. Both of\nthese emission lines are not detected in cooler (Teff < 16000 K) stars in our\nsample. The emission line of Si II at 6239.6 A shows a single-peaked and\nsymmetric profile and the line center has no shift in wavelength with respect\nto those of low excitation absorption lines of Si II. Measured half width of\nthe emission line is the same as those of rotationally broadened low excitation\nabsorption lines of Si II. These observations imply that the emitting gas is\nnot circumstellar origin, but is located at the outermost layer of the\natmosphere, covering the whole stellar surface and co-rotates with the star.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering exhibits an inherent asymmetric\nfeature that differs from both entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which leads\nto one-way EPR steering. Although this one-way EPR steering phenomenon has been\nexperimentally observed, the schemes to manipulate the direction of EPR\nsteering have not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate three schemes to manipulate the direction of EPR\nsteering, either by varying the noise on one party of a two-mode squeezed state\n(TMSS) or transmitting the TMSS in a noisy channel. The dependence of the\ndirection of EPR steering on the noise and transmission efficiency in the\nquantum channel is analyzed. The experimental results show that the direction\nof EPR steering of the TMSS can be changed in the presented schemes. Our work\nis helpful in understanding the fundamental asymmetry of quantum nonlocality\nand has potential applications in future asymmetric quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a quantum mechanical phenomenon\nthat allows one party to steer the state of a distant party by exploiting their\nshared entanglement. It has potential applications in secure quantum\ncommunication. In this paper, we present two swapping schemes of Gaussian EPR\nsteering, single-channel and dual-channel schemes, by the technique of\nentanglement swapping. Two space-separated independent EPR steering states\nwithout a direct interaction present EPR steering after deterministic swapping.\nBy comparing the EPR steering of the single-channel and dual-channel schemes,\nwe show that the transmission distance of the single-channel scheme is much\nlonger than that of the symmetric dual-channel scheme. Different from\nentanglement swapping, one-way EPR steering is presented after swapping over\nlossy channels. The most interesting thing is that the change of the EPR\nsteering direction is observed in the dual-channel scheme. We also show that\nexcess noise in a quantum channel will shorten the transmission distance of the\nswapping, even leading to the sudden death of EPR steering. The presented\nschemes provide a technical reference for remote quantum communications with\nEPR steering.\n", "  We performed the angle dependent magnetoresistance (MR), Hall effect\nmeasurements, the temperature dependent magneto-thermoelectric power (TEP) S(T)\nmeasurements, and the first-principles calculations to study the electronic\nproperties of orthorhombic phase MoTe2 (Td-MoTe2), which was proposed to be\nelectronically two-dimensional (2D). There are some interesting findings about\nTd-MoTe2: (1) A scaling approach\n{\\epsilon}{\\theta}=(sin2{\\theta}+{\\gamma}-2cos2{\\theta})1/2 is applied, where\n{\\theta} is the magnetic field angle with respect to the c axis of the crystal\nand {\\gamma} is the mass anisotropy. Unexpectedly, the electronically 3D\ncharacter with {\\gamma} as low as 1.9 is observed in Td-MoTe2; (2) The possible\nLifshitz transition and the following electronic structure change can be\nverified around T~150 K and T~60 K, which is supported by the evidence of the\nslop changing of the temperature dependence of TEP, the carrier density\nextracted from Hall resistivity and the onset temperature of {\\gamma} obtained\nfrom the MR measurements. The extremely large MR effect in Td-MoTe2 could\noriginate from the combination of the electron-hole compensation and a\nparticular orbital texture on the electron pocket, which is supported by the\ncalculations of electronic structure. Our results may provide a general scaling\nrelation for the anisotropic MR and help to recognize the origins of the MR\neffect in other systems, such as the Weyl semimetals and the Dirac ones.\n", "  Bifractional transformations which lead to quantities that interpolate\nbetween other known quantities, are considered. They do not form a group, and\ngroupoids are used to described their mathematical structure. Bifractional\ncoherent states and bifractional Wigner functions are also defined. The\nproperties of the bifractional coherent states are studied. The bifractional\nWigner functions are used in generalizations of the Moyal star formalism. A\ngeneralized Berezin formalism in this context, is also studied.\n", "  Astronomers are often confronted with funky populations and distributions of\nobjects: brighter objects are more likely to be detected; targets are selected\nbased on colour cuts; imperfect classification yields impure samples. Failing\nto account for these effects leads to biased analyses. In this paper we present\na simple overview of a Bayesian consideration of sample selection, giving\nsolutions to both analytically tractable and intractable models. This is\naccomplished via a combination of analytic approximations and Monte Carlo\nintegration, in which dataset simulation is efficiently used to correct for\nissues in the observed dataset. This methodology is also applicable for data\ntruncation, such as requiring densities to be strictly positive. Toy models are\nincluded for demonstration, along with discussions of numerical considerations\nand how to optimise for implementation. We provide sample code to demonstrate\nthe techniques. The methods in this paper should be widely applicable in fields\nbeyond astronomy, wherever sample selection effects occur.\n", "  As a result of the search for the identity of the chromophores responsible\nfor producing the diffuse interstellar bands, a comprehensive exposition of\nexperimental data is presented, which implicates the following molecules- 1.\nThe extremely stable organic molecules, magnesium tetrabenzoporphyrin (MgTBP)\nand H2TBP. 2. A paraffin matrix (referred to as grains) containing TBPs. 3. A\nlow concentration of pyridine (also within the grains), whose transmission\nwindow at 2175 Angstroms, accounts for the ubiquitous UV bump. The blue\nemission spectra associated with the central star, HD44179, of the Red\nRectangle displays the fluorescence excitation spectra of bare MgTBP. This\nunique spectrum matches the low temperature lab data of MgTBP in the vapor\nphase. An effective grain temperature of 2.728 K (plus or minus 0.008) was\ndeduced, based on MgTBPs lowest measured vibrational state of 341 GHz.\n", "  Numerical simulations are performed using the WENO method of the SVS 13\nmicro-jet and bow shock bubble which reproduce the main features and dynamics\nof Keck Telescope/OSIRIS velocity-resolved integral field spectrograph data: an\nexpanding cooler bow shock bubble, with the bubble center moving at\napproximately 50 km/s with a radial expansion velocity of 11 km/s, surrounding\nthe fast hotter jet, which is propagating at 156 km/s. Contact and bow shock\nwaves are visible in the simulations from both the initial short jet pulse\nwhich creates the nearly spherical bow shock bubble and from the fast\nmicro-jet, while a terminal Mach disk shock is visible near the tip of the\ncontinuous micro-jet, which reduces the jet gas velocity down to the flow\nvelocity of the contact discontinuity at the leading edge of the jet. At 21.1\nyr after the launch of the initial bubble pulse, the jet has caught up with and\npenetrated almost all the way across the bow shock bubble of the slower initial\npulse. At times later than about 22 yr, the jet has penetrated through the\nbubble and thereafter begins to subsume its spherical form. Emission maps from\nthe simulations of the jet---traced by the emission of the shock excited 1.644\nmicron [Fe II] line---and bow shock bubble---traced in the lower excitation\n2.122 micron H_2 1--0 S(1) line---projected onto the plane of the sky are\npresented, and are in good agreement with the Keck observations.\n", "  We present measurements of proper motion of the sub-parsec scale jet at 22\nGHz in the nearby FR I galaxy 3C 66B. Observations were made using the VLBA at\nsix epochs over four years. A phase-referencing technique was used to improve\nthe image quality of the weak and diffuse jet components. We find that the\ninner knots are almost stationary, though one of them was expected to be\ndetected with the apparent speed of 0.2 mas/yr according to 8 GHz monitoring at\nthe same observation epochs. Clear flux variations are not observed in the core\nat 22 GHz, in contrast, clear flux enhancement is observed in the core at 8\nGHz. We discussed that this can be explained, if the jet has helical structure,\nthat the viewing angle of the jet between 8 and 22 GHz differs by a few degree\nin case the jet direction is almost along our line of sight. Although these\nresults may imply the existence of a two-zone jet, which has been suggested in\ncertain radio galaxies, it cannot explain the fact that the jet at the higher\nfrequency jet is slower than that at the lower frequency.\n", "  This concept article discusses the possibilities for identifying\nsedimentary-origin meteorites. The paper concerns (i) the macroscopic candidate\nfor sedimentary meteorite in the epicenter of the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe;\n(ii) potential parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites; (iii) isotopic\nheterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial\nloss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in new type meteorites that\nspent time in extreme weather conditions; (v) cosmogenic isotopes and\nshielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that the list of candidate\nparent bodies for sedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the\nEarth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could\nexist between orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. A parent body for\nextraterrestrial sedimentary rocks on the Earth should be identified based on\nthe entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and\nnoble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and\nmay exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parent bodies. Observed fall\nof cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity impact complying with the criteria of\nimpact structures, and the presence of fusion crust on the fragments should be\nconsidered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.\n", "  Inferring interactions between processes promises deeper insight into\nmechanisms underlying network phenomena. Renormalised partial directed\ncoherence (rPDC) is a frequency-domain representation of the concept of Granger\ncausality while directed partial correlation (DPC) is an alternative approach\nfor quantifying Granger causality in the time domain. Both methodologies have\nbeen successfully applied to neurophysiological signals for detecting directed\nrelationships. This paper introduces their application to climatological time\nseries. We first discuss the application to ENSO -- Monsoon interaction, and\nthen apply the methodologies to the more challenging air-sea interaction in the\nSouth Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). While in the first case the results\nobtained are fully consistent with present knowledge in climate modeling, in\nthe second case the results are, as expected, less clear, and to fully\nelucidate the SACZ air-sea interaction, further investigations on the\nspecificity and sensitivity of these methodologies are needed.\n", "  Deuteron correlation energy (DCE) of the valence proton-neutron subsystem is\nevaluated by utilizing a simple three-body model. We focus on the $^6$Li and\n$^{18}$F nuclei assuming the doubly-closed core and the valence proton and\nneutron. Two interaction models, schematic density-dependent contact (SDDC) and\nMinnesota potentials, are utilized to describe the proton-neutron interaction.\nEvaluating DCE, we conclude that the proton-neutron binding in $^6$Li can be\nstronger than its counterpart of a deuteron in vacuum. On the other hand, in\n$^{18}$F, the energetic correlation is remarkably weak, and does not favor the\nbound, deuteron-like configuration. This significant difference between two\nsystems can be understood from a competition between the proton-neutron kinetic\nand pairing energies, which are sensitive to the spatial extension of the wave\nfunction. This result indicates a remarkable dependence of the deuteron\ncorrelation to its environment and the valence orbits.\n", "  The on-demand tailoring of light's spatial shape is of great relevance in a\nwide variety of research areas. Computer-controlled devices, such as Spatial\nLight Modulators (SLMs) or Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs), offer a very\naccurate, flexible and fast holographic means to this end. Remarkably, digital\nholography affords the simultaneous generation of multiple beams\n(multiplexing), a tool with numerous applications in many fields. Here, we\nprovide a self-contained tutorial on light beam multiplexing. Through the use\nof several examples, the readers will be guided step by step in the process of\nlight beam shaping and multiplexing. Additionally, on the multiplexing\ncapabilities of SLMs to provide a quantitative analysis on the maximum number\nof beams that can be multiplexed on a single SLM, showing approximately 200\nmodes on a single hologram.\n", "  An electrically-controllable, solid-state, reversible device for sourcing and\nsinking alkali vapor is presented. When placed inside an alkali vapor cell,\nboth an increase and decrease of the rubidium vapor density by a factor of two\nare demonstrated through laser absorption spectroscopy on 10 to 15 s time\nscales. The device requires low voltage (5 V), low power (<3.4 mW peak power),\nand low energy (<10.7 mJ per 10 s pulse). The absence of oxygen emission during\noperation is shown through residual gas analysis, indicating Rb is not lost\nthrough chemical reaction but rather by ion transport through the designed\nchannel. This device is of interest for atomic physics experiments and, in\nparticular, for portable cold-atom systems where dynamic control of alkali\nvapor density can enable advances in science and technology.\n", "  Electronic, optical and transport properties of the graphene/ZnO\nheterostructure have been explored using first-principles density functional\ntheory. The results show that Zn12O12 can open a band gap of 14.5 meV in\ngraphene, increase its optical absorption by 1.67 times covering the visible\nspectrum which extends to the infra-red (IR) range, and exhibits a slight\nnon-linear I-V characteristic depending on the applied bias. These findings\nenvisage that a graphene/Zn12O12 heterostructure can be appropriate for energy\nharvesting, photodetection, and photochemical devices.\n", "  We propose a precise ellipsometric method for the investigation of coherent\nlight with a small ellipticity. The main feature of this method is the use of\ncompensators with phase delays providing the maximum accuracy of measurements\nfor the selected range of ellipticities and taking into account the\ninterference of multiple reflections of coherent light. The relative error of\nthe ellipticity measurement in the range of mesurement does not exceed 0.02.\n", "  Social networks are made out of strong and weak ties having very different\nstructural and dynamical properties. But, what features of human interaction\nbuild a strong tie? Here we approach this question from an practical way by\nfinding what are the properties of social interactions that make ties more\npersistent and thus stronger to maintain social interactions in the future.\nUsing a large longitudinal mobile phone database we build a predictive model of\ntie persistence based on intensity, intimacy, structural and temporal patterns\nof social interaction. While our results confirm that structural (embeddedness)\nand intensity (number of calls) are correlated with tie persistence, we find\nthat temporal features of communication events are better and more efficient\npredictors for tie persistence. Specifically, although communication within\nties is always bursty we find that ties that are more bursty than the average\nare more likely to decay, signaling that tie strength is not only reflected in\nthe intensity or topology of the network, but also on how individuals\ndistribute time or attention across their relationships. We also found that\nstable relationships have and require a constant rhythm and if communication is\nhalted for more than 8 times the previous communication frequency, most likely\nthe tie will decay. Our results not only are important to understand the\nstrength of social relationships but also to unveil the entanglement between\nthe different temporal scales in networks, from microscopic tie burstiness and\nrhythm to macroscopic network evolution.\n", "  We continue investigating spectral properties of a Hermitised random matrix\nproduct, which, contrary to previous product ensembles, allows for eigenvalues\non the full real line. When a GUE matrix with an external source is involved,\nwe prove that the eigenvalues of the product form a determinantal point process\nand derive a double integral representation for correlation kernel. As the\nsource changes, we observe a critical value and establish the existence of a\nphase transition for scaled eigenvalues at the origin. Particularly in the\ncritical case, we obtain a new family of Pearcey-type kernels.\n", "  In this paper we propose a new early warning test statistic, the ratio of\ndeviations (RoD), which is defined to be the root mean squared of successive\ndifferences divided by the standard deviation. We show that RoD and\nautocorrelation are asymptotically related, and this relationship motivates the\nuse of RoD to predict Hopf bifurcations in multivariate systems before they\noccur. We validate the use of RoD on synthetic data in the novel situation\nwhere the data is sparse and non-uniformly sampled. Additionally, we adapt the\nmethod to be used on high-frequency time series by sampling, and demonstrate\nthe proficiency of RoD as a classifier.\n", "  Experimental evidences have shown that graphene oxide (GO) can be impermeable\nto liquids, vapors and gases, while it allows a fast permeation of water\nmolecules. The understanding of filtration mechanisms came mostly from studies\ndedicated to water desalination, while very few works have been dedicated to\ndistilling alcohols. In this work, we have investigated the molecular level\nmechanism underlying the alcohol/water separation inside GO membranes. A series\nof molecular dynamics and Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were carried\nout to probe the ethanol/water and methanol/water separation through GO\nmembranes composed of multiple layered graphene-based sheets with different\ninterlayer distance values and number of oxygen-containing functional groups.\nOur results show that the size exclusion and membrane affinities are not\nsufficient to explain the selectivity. Besides that, the favorable water\nmolecular arrangement inside GO 2D-channels forming a robust H-bond network and\nthe fast water diffusion are crucial for an effective separation mechanism. In\nother words, the separation phenomenon is not only governed by affinities with\nthe membrane (enthalpic mechanisms) but mainly by the geometry and size factors\n(entropic mechanisms). We verified that the 2D geometry channel with optimal\ninterlayer distance are key factors for designing more efficient alcohol-water\nseparation membranes. Our findings are consistent with the available\nexperimental data and contribute to clarify important aspects of the separation\nbehavior of confined alcohol/water in GO membranes.\n", "  A periodic leaky-wave antenna (LWA) with tuning capability and enhanced\nscanning sensitivity is introduced in this paper. This antenna leverages the\nconcept of active Gain-Loss C-section pairs to tune the group delay of each\nantenna unit cell without affecting its magnitude response. This in turn\nchanges the scanning angle versus frequency rate in the periodic LWA. The\nproposed concept is well-suited for the application to real-time spectrum\nanalysis, where it allows the frequency resolution to be tuned or significantly\nenhanced even with a low-permittivity substrate.\n", "  A direct coupling coherent observer is constructed for a linear quantum plant\nwhich has oscillatory solutions. It is shown that a finite time moving average\nof the quantum observer output can provide an estimate of the quantum plant\noutput without disturbing this plant signal. By choosing a sufficiently small\naveraging time and a sufficiently large observer gain, the observer tracking\nerror can be made arbitrarily small.\n", "  We study the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation for general initial\nconditions in weighted Sobolev spaces that can support bright solitons (but\nexcluding spectral singularities). We prove global well-posedness and give a\nfull description of the long- time behavior of the solutions in the form of a\nfinite sum of localized solitons and a dispersive component. At leading order\nand in space-time cones, the solution has the form of a multi-soliton whose\nparameters are slightly modified from their initial values by soliton-soliton\nand soliton-radiation interactions. Our analysis provides an explicit\nexpression for the correction dispersive term. We use the nonlinear steepest\ndescent method of Deift and Zhou revisited by the $\\bar{\\partial}$-analysis of\nDieng-McLaughlin and complemented by the recent work of\nBorghese-Jenkins-McLaughlin on soliton resolution for the focusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  The large-scale study of human mobility has been significantly enhanced over\nthe last decade by the massive use of mobile phones in urban populations.\nStudying the activity of mobile phones allows us, not only to infer social\nnetworks between individuals, but also to observe the movements of these\nindividuals in space and time. In this work, we investigate how these two\nrelated sources of information can be integrated within the context of\ndetecting and analyzing large social events. We show that large social events\ncan be characterized not only by an anomalous increase in activity of the\nantennas in the neighborhood of the event, but also by an increase in social\nrelationships of the attendants present in the event. Moreover, having detected\na large social event via increased antenna activity, we can use the network\nconnections to infer whether an unobserved user was present at the event. More\nprecisely, we address the following three challenges: (i) automatically\ndetecting large social events via increased antenna activity; (ii)\ncharacterizing the social cohesion of the detected event; and (iii) analyzing\nthe feasibility of inferring whether unobserved users were in the event.\n", "  It is shown that quantum one-loop potentials of the bulk fields in the\nRandall and Sundrum (RS) model may be immediately expressed in integrals with\nuse of Barvinsky-Nesterov or equivalently Gelfand-Yaglom methods of calculation\nof quantum determinants. Simple expression is obtained for the UV-finite\ndifference of one-loop quantum energies for two arbitrary values of parameter\nof the double-trace asymptotic boundary condition in one-brane and two-brane\nRS-models. Compact formula for Schwinger-DeWitt expansion gives values of\ninduced Planck mass and induced gauge coupling constant in transverse space.\nS-DW expansion is plagued by IR-divergences in one-brane RS-model and makes\nsense in two-brane model.\n", "  Understanding and controlling the interfacial magnetic properties of\nferromagnetic thin films are crucial for spintronic device applications.\nHowever, using conventional magnetometry, it is difficult to detect them\nseparately from the bulk properties. Here, by utilizing tunneling anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance in a single-barrier heterostructure composed of\nLa0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (LSMO)/ LaAlO3 (LAO)/ Nb-doped SrTiO3 (001), we reveal the\npresence of a peculiar strong two-fold magnetic anisotropy (MA) along the\n[110]c direction at the LSMO/LAO interface, which is not observed in bulk LSMO.\nThis MA shows unknown behavior that the easy magnetization axis rotates by\n90{\\deg} at an energy of 0.2 eV below the Fermi level in LSMO. We attribute\nthis phenomenon to the transition between the eg and t2g bands at the LSMO\ninterface. Our finding and approach to understanding the energy dependence of\nthe MA demonstrate a new possibility of efficient control of the interfacial\nmagnetic properties by controlling the band structures of oxide\nheterostructures.\n", "  In the multiverse, the universes can be created in entangled pairs with\nspacetimes that are both expanding in terms of the time variables experienced\nby internal observers in their particle physics experiments. The time variables\nof the two universes are related by an antipodal-like symmetry that might\nexplain why there is no antimatter in our universe: at the origin, antimatter\nis created, by definition and for any observer, in the observer's partner\nuniverse. The Euclidean region of the spacetime that separates the two\nuniverses acts as a quantum barrier that prevents matter-antimatter from\ncollapse.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae are thought to be the outcome of the thermonuclear\nexplosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf in a close binary system. Their\noptical light curve is powered by thermalized gamma-rays produced by the\nradioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, the most abundant isotope present in the\ndebris. Gamma-rays escaping the ejecta can be used as a diagnostic tool for\nstudying the structure of the exploding star and the characteristics of the\nexplosion. The fluxes of the $^{56}$Ni lines and the continuum obtained by\nINTEGRAL from SN2014J in M82, the first ever gamma-detected SNIa, around the\ntime of the maximum of the optical light curve strongly suggest the presence of\na plume of $^{56}$Ni in the outermost layers moving at high velocities. If this\ninterpretation was correct, it could have important consequences on our current\nunderstanding of the physics of the explosion and on the nature of the systems\nthat explode.\n", "  We analyze a general class of self-adjoint difference operators\n$H_\\varepsilon = T_\\varepsilon + V_\\varepsilon$ on\n$\\ell^2(\\varepsilon\\mathbb{Z}^d)$, where $V_\\varepsilon$ is a one-well\npotential and $\\varepsilon$ is a small parameter. We construct a Finslerian\ndistance $d$ induced by $H_\\varepsilon$ and show that short integral curves are\ngeodesics. Then we show that Dirichlet eigenfunctions decay exponentially with\na rate controlled by the Finsler distance to the well. This is analog to\nsemiclassical Agmon estimates for Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n", "  The central problem in forming a star is the angular momentum in the\ncircumstellar disk which prevents material from falling into the central\nstellar core. An attractive solution to the \"angular momentum problem\" appears\nto be the ubiquitous (low-velocity and poorly-collimated) molecular outflows\nand (high-velocity and highly-collimated) protostellar jets accompanying the\nearliest phase of star formation that remove angular momentum at a range of\ndisk radii. Previous observations suggested that outflowing material carries\naway the excess angular momentum via magneto-centrifugally driven winds from\nthe surfaces of circumstellar disks down to ~ 10 AU scales, allowing the\nmaterial in the outer disk to transport to the inner disk. Here we show that\nhighly collimated protostellar jets remove the residual angular momenta at the\n~ 0.05 AU scale, enabling the material in the innermost region of the disk to\naccrete toward the central protostar. This is supported by the rotation of the\njet measured down to ~ 10 AU from the protostar in the HH 212 protostellar\nsystem. The measurement implies a jet launching radius of ~\n0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.05} AU on the disk, based on the magneto-centrifugal theory of\njet production, which connects the properties of the jet measured at large\ndistances to those at its base through energy and angular momentum\nconservation.\n", "  Analyzing a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with cubic, quartic, and quintic\nnonlinearities through analytical and numerical methods, we examine the\nstability of two-dimensional (2D) trapless Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\nwith two-, three-body interactions and quantum fluctuations. Applying a\nvariational approach, we derive the equation of motion and effective potential\nto discuss in detail the stability of the BECs in 2D free space. We show that\nwith the aid of quantum fluctuations it is possible to stabilize 2D trapless\nBEC without any oscillatory nonlinearities. Also, there is an enhancement of\nthe stability of the system, due to the inclusion of the three-body interaction\nand quantum fluctuations in addition to the two-body interaction. We further\nstudy the stability of 2D trapless BECs with rapid periodic temporal modulation\nof scattering length by using a Feshbach resonance. We discuss all possible\nways of stabilization of trapless BECs in 2D by three-body interaction and\nquantum fluctuations. Finally, we verify our analytical results with numerical\nsimulation using split-step Crank-Nicholson method. These match well with the\nanalytical predictions.\n", "  Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide band gap semiconducting material which is\npromising for photocatalysis. Here we present first-principles calculations to\nstudy the pressure dependence of structural and electronic properties of two\nTiO2 phases: the cotunnite-type and the Fe2P-type structure. The band gaps are\ncalculated using density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA), as well as the many-body perturbation theory with the GW\napproximation. The band gaps of both phases are found to be unexpectedly robust\nacross a broad range pressures. The corresponding pressure coefficients are\nsignificantly smaller than that of diamond and silicon carbide (SiC), whose\npressure coefficient is the smallest value ever measured by experiment. The\nrobustness originates from the synchronous change of valence band maximum (VBM)\nand conduction band minimum (CBM) with nearly identical rates of changes. A\nstep-like jump of band gaps around the phase transition pressure point is\nexpected and understood in light of the difference in crystal structures.\n", "  We present a study of plasma conditions in the atmospheres of the Hot\nJupiters HD 209458b and HD 189733b and for an HD 209458b-like planet at orbit\nlocations between 0.2-1 AU around a Sun-like star. We discuss how these\nconditions influence the radio emission we expect from their magnetospheres. We\nfind that the environmental conditions are such that the cyclotron maser\ninstability (CMI), the process responsible for the generation of radio waves at\nmagnetic planets in the solar system, most likely will not operate at Hot\nJupiters. Hydrodynamically expanding atmospheres possess extended ionospheres\nwhose plasma densities within the magnetosphere are so large that the plasma\nfrequency is much higher than the cyclotron frequency, which contradicts the\ncondition for the production of radio emission and prevents the escape of radio\nwaves from close-in exoplanets at distances <0.05 AU from a Sun-like host star.\nThe upper atmosphere structure of gas giants around stars similar to the Sun\nchanges between 0.2 and 0.5 AU from the hydrodynamic to a hydrostatic regime\nand this results in conditions similar to solar system planets with a region of\ndepleted plasma between the exobase and the magnetopause where the plasma\nfrequency can be lower than the cyclotron frequency. In such an environment, a\nbeam of highly energetic electrons accelerated along the field lines towards\nthe planet can produce radio emission. However, even if the CMI could operate\nthe extended ionospheres of Hot Jupiters are too dense to let the radio\nemission escape from the planets.\n", "  By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation analytically and numerically, we\nreexamine the implosion phenomena that occur beyond the critical value of the\nnumber of atoms of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with\ncigar-shape trapping geometry. We theoretically calculate the critical number\nof atoms in the condensate by using Ritz's variational optimization technique\nand investigate the stability and collapse dynamics of the attractive BEC by\nnumerically solving the time dependent Gross-Pitavskii equation.\n", "  For a general class of difference operators $H_\\varepsilon = T_\\varepsilon +\nV_\\varepsilon$ on $\\ell^2(\\varepsilon\\mathbb{Z}^d)$, where $V_\\varepsilon$ is a\nmulti-well potential and $\\varepsilon$ is a small parameter, we analyze the\nasymptotic behavior as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ of the (low-lying) eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions. We show that the first $n$ eigenvalues of $H_\\varepsilon$\nconverge to the first $n$ eigenvalues of the direct sum of harmonic oscillators\non $\\mathbb{R}^d$ located at the several wells. Our proof is microlocal.\n", "  Magnetic properties of the ferrimagnetic mixed spin-(1/2,S) Heisenberg chains\nare examined using quantum Monte Carlo simulations for two different quantum\nspin numbers S = 1 and 3/2. The calculated magnetization curves at finite\ntemperatures are confronted with zero-temperature magnetization data obtained\nwithin density-matrix renormalization group method, which imply an existence of\ntwo quantum critical points determining a breakdown of the gapped Lieb-Mattis\nferrimagnetic phase and Tomonaga-Luttinger spin-liquid phase, respectively.\nWhile a square-root behavior of the magnetization accompanying each quantum\ncritical point is gradually smoothed upon rising temperature, the\nsusceptibility and isothermal entropy change data provide a stronger evidence\nof the quantum critical points at finite temperatures through marked local\nmaxima and minima, respectively.\n", "  We report a simple technique for stabilization of a laser frequency at the\nwings of an atomic resonance. The reference signal used for stabilization\nissues from interference effects obtained in a low-quality cavity filled with a\nresonant atomic vapour. For a frequency detuned at 2.6 GHz from the $^{133}$Cs\nD$_2$ 6S$_{1/2}$ F=4 to 6P$_{3/2}$ F'= 5 transition, the fractional frequency\nAllan deviation is $10^{-8}$ for averaging times of 300 s, corresponding to a\nfrequency deviation of 4 MHz. Adequate choice of the atomic density and of the\ncell thickness allows locking the laser at detunings larger than 10 GHz. Such a\nsimple technique does not require magnetic fields or signal modulation.\n", "  The ordinary and the extraordinary Hall effects were studied in gradually\noxidized amorphous CoFeB ferromagnets over six orders of resistivity from the\nmetallic to the strongly insulating regime. Polarity of the extraordinary Hall\neffect reverses, and the amplitude of both the ordinary and the extraordinary\nHall effects increases quadratically with resistivity when resistance exceeds\nthe quantum resistance threshold. The absolute value of the extraordinary Hall\neffect scales linearly with the ordinary one in the entire range over eight\norders of magnitude between the metallic and the insulating states. The\nbehavior differs qualitatively and quantitatively from theoretically predicted\nand experimentally known in other materials.\n", "  Highly collimated betatron radiation from a laser wakefield accelerator is a\npromising tool for spectroscopic measurements. Therefore there is a requirement\nto create spectrometers suited to the unique properties of such a source. We\ndemonstrate a spectrometer which achieves an energy resolution of < 5 eV at 9\nkeV and is angularly resolving the x-ray emission allowing the reference and\nspectrum to be recorded at the same time. The single photon analysis is used to\nsignificantly reduce the background noise. Theoretical performance of various\nconfigurations of the spectrometer is calculated by a ray-tracing algorithm.\nThe properties and performance of the spectrometer including the angular and\nspectral resolution are demonstrated experimentally on absorption above the\nK-edge of a Cu foil backlit by laser-produced betatron radiation x-ray beam.\n", "  Brain is an organ that controls activities of all the parts of the body.\nRecognition of automated brain tumor in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a\ndifficult task due to complexity of size and location variability. This\nautomatic method detects all the type of cancer present in the body. Previous\nmethods for tumor are time consuming and less accurate. In the present work,\nstatistical analysis morphological and thresholding techniques are used to\nprocess the images obtained by MRI. Feed-forward back-prop neural network is\nused to classify the performance of tumors part of the image. This method\nresults high accuracy and less iterations detection which further reduces the\nconsumption time.\n", "  In this paper, dark energy models of the universe filled with wet dark fluid\nare constructed in the framework of LRS Bianchi type-II space-time in General\nTheory of Relativity. A new equation of state modeled on the equation of state\n$p$=$\\gamma(\\rho - \\rho_*)$, which can describe a liquid including water, is\nused. The exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are obtained in\nquadrature form and the models corresponding to the cases $\\gamma = 0$ and\n$\\gamma = 1$ are discussed in detail.\n", "  Statistical systems are conceived from the standpoint of statistical\nmechanics, as made of a (generally large) number of identical units and\nexhibiting a (generally large) number of different configurations\n(microstates), among which only equivalence classes (macrostates) are\naccessible to observations. Further attention is devoted to evolving\nstatistical systems, and a simple case including only a possible event, E, and\nrelated opposite event, $\\neg$E, is examined in detail. In particular, the\nexpected evolution is determined and compared to the random evolution inferred\nfrom a sequence of random numbers, for different sample populations. The\nspecial case of radioactive decay is considered and results are expressed in\nterms of the fractional time, $t/\\Delta t$, where the time step, $\\Delta t$, is\nrelated to the decay probability, $p=p(\\Delta t)$. An application is made to\ndata collections from selected academic courses, focusing on the extent to\nwhich expected evolutions and model random evolutions fit to empirical random\nevolutions inferred from data collections. Results could be biased by the\nassumed number of students who abandoned their course, defined as suitable\nimpostors (SI). Extreme cases related to a lower and an upper limit of the SI\nnumber are considered for a time step, $\\Delta t=(1/12)$y, where fitting\nexpected evolutions relate to $0.003\\le p\\le0.200$. In conclusion, evolving\nstatistical systems made of academic courses are similar to poorly populated\nsamples of radioactive nuclides exhibiting equal probabilities, $p$, and time\nsteps, $\\Delta t$, where inferred mean lifetimes, $\\tau$, and half-life times,\n$t_{1/2}$, range within $0.37<\\tau/{\\rm y}<27.73$ and $0.25<t_{1/2}/{\\rm\ny}<19.22$, respectively, and upper limits are related to incomplete data\ncollections.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the combined influence of the nontrivial\ntopology introduced by a disclination and non inertial effects due to rotation,\nin the energy levels and the wave functions of a noninteracting electron gas\nconfined to a two-dimensional pseudoharmonic quantum dot, under the influence\nof an external uniform magnetic field. The exact solutions for energy\neigenvalues and wave functions are computed as functions of the applied\nmagnetic field strength, the disclination topological charge, magnetic quantum\nnumber and the rotation speed of the sample. We investigate the modifications\non the light interband absorption coefficient and absorption threshold\nfrequency. We observe novel features in the system, including a range of\nmagnetic field without corresponding absorption phenomena, which is due to a\ntripartite term of the Hamiltonian, involving magnetic field, the topological\ncharge of the defect and the rotation frequency.\n", "  Using the latest experimental data, performed by ATLAS Collaboration and\nwithin the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we presented\nthe calculations for cross sections times branching fractions, $\\sigma\\times\nBr$, as a functions of the CP-even, H, Higgs boson mass, CP-odd, A, Higgs boson\nmass and charged, H$^{\\pm}$, Higgs boson mass. Using the restricted parameter\nset, received from the hMSSM+HDECAY and \"low-tb-high\" scenarios, with the help\nof the computer programs SOFTSUSY, Prospino and SusHi, we received the large\nvalues of $\\sigma\\times Br$ for A and H bosons at tan$\\beta$=2 for the planned\n14 TeV at the LHC and found the large $\\sigma\\times Br$ at tan$\\beta$=30 for\ncharged Higgs boson. The obtained results are of experimental interest as they\nare connected with the experimental searches for new physics beyond the\nStandard Model at the LHC.\n", "  This article represents quantitative numerical analysis to find the\nsensitivity for the mass ordering and octant of atmospheric mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ within 3$\\sigma$ range of oscillation parameters, in the context\nof three long base line (LBL) accelerator experiments viz. UNO, DUNE and\nNO$\\nu$A.\n  We notice that on the basis of quantitative sensitivity pertaining to the\nevent rate, it is possible to investigate the mass ordering within all\nexperiments. Conclusively, like NO$\\nu$A and DUNE experiments, UNO experiment\nstands as better alternative for investigating mass ordering, especially when\nwe need to cross check the results at higher beam energies and base line\nlengths.\n  We observe that discrete solutions viz. {\\it wrong octant-right\n$\\delta_{CP}$, wrong octant-wrong $\\delta_{CP}$} and {\\it right octant-wrong\n$\\delta_{CP}$} and continuous solutions arising due to submergence of discrete\nsolutions with true solution are possible up to 3$\\sigma$ level. It is UNO\nexperiment that alone have the potential to remove these discrete solutions,\nwhile both NO$\\nu$A and DUNE experiments have very poor tendency to remove\nthese discrete solutions especially near the maximal mixing. We find that these\ndiscrete solutions can be resolved up to 3$\\sigma$ level by the combined\nNO$\\nu$A+DUNE+UNO data set, at all multiple degenerate solutions in the true\nparameter space considered under the study. Though replacing half the neutrino\nrun with antineutrino run introduces qualitative advantage because of their\ndifferent dependences on $\\delta_{CP}$, but due to lower cross section and\nreduction in the statistics, addition of antineutrino data make the precision\nworse. Thus considering experimental data only in the neutrino mode, enhances\n$\\delta_{CP}$ and $\\theta_{23}$ precision significantly.\n", "  Recent results obtained by analyzing diffuse gamma-ray emission detected by\nFermi-LAT show a substantial variation of the CR spectrum as a function of the\ndistance from the Galactic Center. For energies up to tens of GeV, the CR\nproton density in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the\ngalactocentric distance while the density in the central region of the Galaxy\nwas found to exceed the value measured in the outer Galaxy. At the same time,\nFermi-LAT data suggest a gradual spectral softening while moving outward from\nthe center of the Galaxy to its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge\nfor standard calculations of CR propagation based on assuming a uniform\ndiffusion coefficient within the Galactic volume. Here we present a model of\nnon-linear CR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and\nadvection off self-generated turbulence. We will show that for a realistic\ndistribution of CR sources following the spatial distribution of supernova\nremnants and the space dependence of the magnetic field on galactocentric\ndistance, both the spatial profile of CR density and the spectral softening can\neasily be accounted for.\n", "  We report a record low thermal conductivity in polycrystalline MoS2 obtained\nby varying grain sizes and orientations in ultrathin films. By optimizing the\nsulphurisation parameters of nanometre-thick Mo layer, we could grow MoS2 films\nwith tuneable morphologies. The thermal conductivity is extracted from a Raman\nlaser power-dependent study on suspended samples. The lowest value of thermal\nconductivity of 0.27 Wm-1K-1, which reaches a similar value as teflon, is\nobtained in a polycrystalline sample formed by a combination of horizontally\nand vertically oriented grains, with respect to the bulk (001) monocrystal.\nAnalysis by means of molecular dynamics and finite element method simulations\nconfirm that such grain arrangement leads to lower grain boundary conductance.\nWe discuss the possible use of these thermal insulating films in the context of\nelectronics and thermoelectricity.\n", "  I give a pedagogical introduction into flavour-changing neutral current\ninteractions of kaons and their role to reveal or constrain physics beyond the\nStandard Model (SM). Then I discuss the measure $\\epsilon_K^\\prime$ of direct\nCP violation in $K\\to \\pi\\pi$ decays, which deviates from the SM prediction by\n$2.8\\sigma$. A supersymmetric scenario with flavour mixing among left-handed\nsquarks can accomodate the measured value of $\\epsilon_K^\\prime$ even for very\nheavy sparticles, outside the reach of the LHC. The considered scenario employs\nmass splittings among the right-handed up and down squarks (to enhance\n$\\epsilon_K^\\prime$) and a gluino which is heavier than the left-handed\nstrange-down mixed squarks by at least a factor of 1.5 (to suppress excessive\ncontribution to $\\epsilon_K$, the measure of indirect CP violation). The\nbranching ratios of the rare decays $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar\\nu$ and $K_L \\to\n\\pi^0 \\nu \\bar\\nu$, to be measured by the NA62 and KOTO-step2 experiments,\nrespectively, are only moderately affected. These measurements have the\ncapability to either falsify the model or to constrain the CP phase associated\nwith strange-down squark mixing accurately.\n", "  Early in researchers' careers, it is difficult to assess how good their work\nis or how important or influential the scholars will eventually be. Hence,\nfunding agencies, academic departments, and others often use the Journal Impact\nFactor (JIF) of where the authors have published to assess their work and\nprovide resources and rewards for future work. The use of JIFs in this way has\nbeen heavily criticized, however. Using a large data set with many thousands of\npublication profiles of individual researchers, this study tests the ability of\nthe JIF (in its normalized variant) to identify, at the beginning of their\ncareers, those candidates who will be successful in the long run. Instead of\nbare JIFs and citation counts, the metrics used here are standardized according\nto Web of Science subject categories and publication years. The results of the\nstudy indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) is able to discriminate\nbetween researchers who published papers later on with a citation impact above\nor below average in a field and publication year - not only in the short term,\nbut also in the long term. However, the low to medium effect sizes of the\nresults also indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) should not be\nused as the sole criterion for identifying later success: other criteria, such\nas the novelty and significance of the specific research, academic\ndistinctions, and the reputation of previous institutions, should also be\nconsidered.\n", "  Real epidemic spreading networks often composed of several kinds of networks\ninterconnected with each other, and the interrelated networks have the\ndifferent topologies and epidemic dynamics. Moreover, most human diseases are\nderived from animals, and the zoonotic infections always spread on\ninterconnected networks. In this paper, we consider the epidemic spreading on\none-way circular-coupled network consist of three interconnected subnetworks.\nHere, two one-way three-layer circular interactive networks are established by\nintroducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method, then we get the basic\nreproduction numbers and prove the global stability of the disease-free\nequilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the models. Through mathematical\nanalysis and numerical simulations, it is found that the basic reproduction\nnumbers $R_0$ of the two models are dependent on the infection rates, infection\nperiods, average degrees and degree ratios. In the first model, the network\nstructures of the inner contact patterns have a bigger impact on $R_0$ than\nthat of the cross contact patterns. Under the same contact pattern, the\ninternal infection rates have greater influence on $R_0$ than the\ncross-infection rates. In the second model, the disease prevails in a\nheterogeneous network has a greater impact on $R_0$ than the disease from a\nhomogeneous network, and the infections among the three subnetworks all play a\nimportant role in the propagation process. Numerical examples verify and expand\nthese theoretical results very well.\n", "  Neutral atom systems are an appealing platform for the development and\ntesting of quantum control and measurement techniques. This dissertation\npresents experimental investigations of control and measurement tools using as\na testbed the 16-dimensional hyperfine manifold associated with the electronic\nground state of $^{133}$Cs atoms. On the control side, we present an\nexperimental realization of a protocol to implement robust unitary\ntransformations in the presence of static and dynamic perturbations. We also\npresent an experimental realization of inhomogeneous quantum control.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate our ability to perform two different unitary\ntransformations on atoms that see different light shifts from an optical\naddressing field. On the measurement side, we present experimental realizations\nof quantum state and process tomography. The state tomography project\nencompasses a comprehensive evaluation of several measurement strategies and\nstate estimation algorithms. Our experimental results show that in the presence\nof experimental imperfections, there is a clear tradeoff between accuracy,\nefficiency and robustness in the reconstruction. The process tomography project\ninvolves an experimental demonstration of efficient reconstruction by using a\nset of intelligent probe states. Experimental results show that we are able to\nreconstruct unitary maps in Hilbert spaces with dimension ranging from $d = 4$\nto $d = 16$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a\nunitary process in $d = 16$ is successfully reconstructed in the laboratory.\n", "  The nonlocalized clustering approach is generalized to 8-11Be isotopes with\nisospin dependent spin-orbit potential. A new form of the\nTohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\\\"opke (THSR) wave function is introduced to provide a\ncorrect description for the {\\sigma}-binding neutron in 11Be. Systematic\ncalculations for 8-11Be isotopes are performed and results fit well with\nexperimental values. The low energy spectrum of 11Be is also obtained,\nespecially the correct spin-parity 1/2+ is reproduced for the intruder ground\nstate. The exotic neutron halo structure of 11Be is studied by calculations of\nroot-mean-square radii and density distribution. We obtain a large spatial\ndistribution for the last valence neutron of 11Be, which fits the\nphenomenological extracted value from experimental data. The spectroscopic\nfactor is also calculated and discussed for the 1/2+ ground state of 11Be.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to generalize to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded case the\nstudy of Hom-Lie bialgebras which were discussed first by D. Yau, then by C.\nBai and Y. Sheng. We provide different ways for constructing Hom-Lie\nsuperbialgebras. Also we define Matched pairs, Manin supertriples and discuss\ntheir relationships. Moreover, we study coboundary and triangular Hom-Lie\nbialgebras, as well as infinitesimal deformations of the cobracket.\n", "  The existence of the phonon-roton minimum has been widely observed for both\nthe solid and liquid phases but so far there is no sufficient theoretical\nexplanation of its origin. In this paper we use a range of techniques to study\nthe dynamics and short-range order for a range of simple materials in their\ncrystalline, amorphous and liquid phases. We perform inelastic neutron\nscattering (INS) experiments of polycrystalline and liquid barium to study the\nhigh-frequency dynamics and understand the mechanisms underlying the atomic\nmotion. Moreover we perform INS simulations for crystals and supercooled\nliquids, compare the collective excitation spectra and identify similarities.\nWe perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the same materials and\npresent results of population and bond angle distribution showing a short-range\norder dependence of the different phases, expanding the current knowledge in\nliterature. Finally, we support our findings with a theoretical explanation of\nthe origin of the phonon-roton minima which is observed in both solids and\nliquids. We study this as a classical phenomenon and we base our explanation on\nshort range interatomic interactions.\n", "  Parallax is the most important astronomical method for determining the\ndistances from the Earth to nearby stars. We present two hands-on activities\nthat explore the concepts and practice of parallax measurement. The first\nactivity is a simple geometrical set-up using simple theodolites, and is\naccessible for students grade 7 and above. The second activity uses digital\nphotography to recreate astronomical parallax measurements in a classroom\nsetting, and is suitable for students grade 10 and above.\n", "  In this article, a semianalytical approach for demonstrating elastic waves\npropagation in nanostructures has been presented based on the modified\ncouple-stress theory including acceleration gradients. Using the experimental\nresults and atomic simulations, the static and dynamic length scales were\ncalculated for several materials, zinc oxide (ZnO), silicon (Si), silicon\ncarbide (SiC), indium antimonide (InSb), and diamond. To evaluate the predicted\nstatic and dynamic length scales as well as the presented model, the natural\nfrequencies of a beam in addition to the phase velocity and group velocity of\nSi were studied and compared with the available static length scales, estimated\nusing strain-gradient theory without considering acceleration gradients. These\nthree criteria, natural frequency, phase velocity, and group velocity, show\nthat the presented model is dynamically stable even for larger wavevector\nvalues. Furthermore, it is explained why the previous works, which all are\nbased on the strain-gradient theory without acceleration gradients, predicted\nvery small values for the static length scale in the longitudinal direction\nrather than the static length scale in the transverse directions.\n", "  We propose a quantum circuit to discriminate between two arbitrary quantum\nevolution operators. It permits to test the equality of two quantum operators\nand to estimate a fidelity measure of them. The relation of the proposal to the\nSWAP test for discriminating two quantum states is analyzed. We also discuss\npotential applications for the discrimination of quantum channels and possible\nlaboratory implementations with light along the same lines of recent\nexperimental realizations of quantum superpositions of causal orders exploiting\nthe different degrees of freedom of photons.\n", "  We present the result of a systematic study of the tribological properties of\nindustrial Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)-based coatings carried out with an\natomic force microscope. A new characterization protocol allowed the reliable\nand quantitative assessment of the friction coefficient and adhesion forces at\nthe sub-micrometer scale even for highly corrugated industrial samples. We have\nstudied and compared PTFE coatings charged with different additives in dry and\nhumid environment. The influence of additives and humidity on the friction\ncoefficient and on adhesion forces has been investigated using standard silicon\nnitride tips as sliders in the low-load regime.\n", "  We have characterized the frictional properties of nanostructured (ns) carbon\nfilms grown by Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition (SCBD) via an Atomic\nForce-Friction Force Microscope (AFM-FFM). The experimental data are discussed\non the basis of a modified Amonton's law for friction, stating a linear\ndependence of friction on load plus an adhesive offset accounting for a finite\nfriction force in the limit of null total applied load. Molecular Dynamics\nsimulations of the interaction of the AFM tip with the nanostructured carbon\nconfirm the validity of the friction model used for this system. Experimental\nresults show that the friction coefficient is not influenced by the\nnanostructure of the films nor by the relative humidity. On the other hand the\nadhesion coefficient depends on these parameters.\n"]}
