The random environment consists of\ni.i.d. potential values assigned to each site of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$; sites on the\npositive axis have the potential enhanced by a deterministic value $u$. We show\nthat for small inverse temperature $\\beta$ the quenched and annealed free\nenergies differ significantly at most in a small neighborhood (of size of order\n$\\beta$) of the annealed critical point $u_c^a=0$. For the case $u=0$, we show\nthat the difference between quenched and annealed free energies is of order\n$\\beta^4$ as $\\beta\\to 0$, assuming only finiteness of exponential moments of\nthe potential values, improving existing results which required stronger\nassumptions.\n", "  Combination of neutron and X-ray reflectometry was used to study the vertical\nstructure of 100 nm-thin copper films with implanted oxygen ions of energy E =\n[10-30] keV and doses D=[0.2-5.4]x$10^{16}$ $cm^{-2}$. The study shows that\noxygen ion implantation with an energy of E = 30 keV leads to the formation of\na 3 nm thick layer on the surface. Density and copper/oxygen stoichiometry of\nthe observed surface layer are close to $Cu_2O$ oxide. We attribute the $Cu_2O$\noxide formation to highly mobilized copper atoms generated by stimulated ion\nimplantation.\n", "  We show that a vector matter-wave soliton in Bose-Einstein condensate loaded\ninto an optical lattice can escape from a trap formed by a parabolic potential,\nresembling a Hawking emission. The particle-antiparticle pair is emulated by a\nlow-amplitude bright-bright soliton in two-component Bose-Einstein condensate\nwith effective masses of opposite signs. It is shown that the parabolic\npotential leads to a spatial separation of BEC components. One component with\nchemical potential in a semi-infinite gap exerts periodical oscillations, while\nthe other BEC component, with negative effective mass, escapes from the trap.\nThe mechanism of atoms transfer from one BEC component to another by spatially\nperiodic linear coupling term is discussed.\n", "  A topological insulator (TI) nanowire (NW), where the core is insulating and\nthe 2D spin-helical Dirac fermion topological surface states (TSS) are\ncircumferentially quantized into a series of 1D sub-bands, promises novel\ntopological physics and applications. An axial magnetic flux ({\\Phi}) through\nthe core drives periodic topological transitions in the surface sub-bands,\nchanging from being all doubly-degenerate with a gapped Dirac point (DP) at\ninteger (including zero) flux quanta ({\\Phi}$_0$ = h/e, with h being the Planck\nconstant and e the electron charge), to contain a topologically-protected,\nnon-degenerate 1D spin helical mode with restored DP at half-integer flux\nquanta. The resulting magnetoconductance is predicted to exhibit Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations (ABO) with maxima occurring alternatively at half-integer or\ninteger flux quanta (referred to as {\\pi}-ABO or 0-ABO), depending periodically\non the Fermi wavevector (k$_F$, with period 2{\\pi}/C, C being the NW\ncircumference). Here, we report a clear observation of such k$_F$-periodic\nalternations between 0-ABO and {\\pi}-ABO in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ TI nanoribbon (NR, a\nrectangular cross sectional NW) field effect devices, which exhibit\nquasi-ballistic transport over ~2 {\\mu}m (as manifested in length-independent\nconductance, exponential decaying ABO amplitude with increasing temperature\n(T), and an 1/T dependence of the extracted phase coherence length). The\nconductances as functions of the gate voltage at half and zero flux quanta also\nexhibit clear, but anti-correlated oscillations periodic in k$_F$ (with period\n2{\\pi}/C, equivalently when C encloses an integer multiples of Fermi wavelength\n2{\\pi}/k$_F$), consistent with the circumferentially quantized surface\nsub-bands. We also extract the minimal Fermi energy and momentum for TSS to\nemerge out of the bulk valence band, in agreement with the known Bi$_2$Te$_3$\nbandstructure.\n", "  The goal of importance sampling is to estimate the expected value of a given\nfunction with respect to a probability measure $\\nu$ using a random sample of\nsize $n$ drawn from a different probability measure $\\mu$. If the two measures\n$\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are nearly singular with respect to each other, which is often\nthe case in practice, the sample size required for accurate estimation is\nlarge. In this article it is shown that in a fairly general setting, a sample\nof size approximately $\\exp(D(\\nu||\\mu))$ is necessary and sufficient for\naccurate estimation by importance sampling, where $D(\\nu||\\mu)$ is the\nKullback-Leibler divergence of $\\mu$ from $\\nu$. In particular, the required\nsample size exhibits a kind of cut-off in the logarithmic scale. The theory is\napplied to obtain a general formula for the sample size required in importance\nsampling for one-parameter exponential families (Gibbs measures).\n", "  We study instant conformal symmetry breaking as a holographic effect of\nultrarelativistic particles moving in the AdS3 spacetime. We give the\nqualitative picture of this effect probing it by two-point correlation\nfunctions and the entanglement entropy of the corresponding boundary theory. We\nshow that within geodesic approximation the ultra-relativistic massless defect\ndue to gravitational lensing of the geodesics, produces a zone structure for\ncorrelators with broken conformal invariance. Meanwhile, the holographic\nentanglement entropy also exhibits a transition to the non-conformal behaviour.\nTwo colliding massless defects produce more diverse zone structure for\ncorrelators and the entanglement entropy.\n", "  Some ancient, dim, metal-poor stars may have formed in the ashes of the first\nsupernovae (SNe). If their chemical abundances can be reconciled with the\nelemental yields of specific Population III (Pop III) explosions, they could\nreveal the properties of primordial stars. But multidimensional simulations of\nsuch explosions are required to predict their yields because dynamical\ninstabilities can dredge material up from deep in the ejecta that would\notherwise be predicted to fall back on to the central remnant and be lost in\none-dimensional (1D) models. We have performed two-dimensional (2D) numerical\nsimulations of two low-energy Pop III SNe, a 12.4 Msun explosion and a 60 Msun\nexplosion, and find that they produce elemental yields that are a good fit to\nthose measured in the most iron-poor star discovered to date, SMSS\nJ031300.36-670839.3 (J031300). Fallback on to the compact remnant in these weak\nexplosions accounts for the lack of measurable iron in J031300 and its low\niron-group abundances in general. Our 2D explosions produce higher abundances\nof heavy elements (atomic number Z > 20) than their 1D counterparts due to\ndredge-up by fluid instabilities. Since almost no Ni is ejected by these weak\nSNe, their low luminosities will prevent their detection in the near-infrared\nwith the James Webb Space Telescope and future 30-m telescopes on the ground.\nThe only evidence that they ever occurred will be in the fossil abundance\nrecord.\n", "  We study the luminescence of unintentionally doped and Si-doped\nIn$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N nanowires with a low In content (x<0.2) grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on Si substrates. The emission band observed at 300 K from the\nunintentionally doped samples is centered at much lower energies (800 meV) than\nexpected from the In content measured by x-ray diffractometry and energy\ndispersive x-ray spectroscopy. This discrepancy arises from the pinning of the\nFermi level at the sidewalls of the nanowires, which gives rise to strong\nradial built-in electric fields. The combination of the built-in electric\nfields with the compositional fluctuations inherent to (In,Ga)N alloys induces\na competition between spatially direct and indirect recombination channels. At\nelevated temperatures, electrons at the core of the nanowire recombine with\nholes close to the surface, and the emission from unintentionally doped\nnanowires exhibits a Stark shift of several hundreds of meV. The competition\nbetween spatially direct and indirect transitions is analyzed as a function of\ntemperature for samples with various Si concentrations. We propose that the\nradial Stark effect is responsible for the broadband absorption of (In,Ga)N\nnanowires across the entire visible range, which makes these nanostructures a\npromising platform for solar energy applications.\n", "  Random constraint satisfaction problems undergo several phase transitions as\nthe ratio between the number of constraints and the number of variables is\nvaried. When this ratio exceeds the satisfiability threshold no more solutions\nexist; the satisfiable phase, for less constrained problems, is itself divided\nin an unclustered regime and a clustered one. In the latter solutions are\ngrouped in clusters of nearby solutions separated in configuration space from\nsolutions of other clusters. In addition the rigidity transition signals the\nappearance of so-called frozen variables in typical solutions: beyond this\nthreshold most solutions belong to clusters with an extensive number of\nvariables taking the same values in all solutions of the cluster. In this paper\nwe refine the description of this phenomenon by estimating the location of the\nfreezing transition, corresponding to the disappearance of all unfrozen\nsolutions (not only typical ones). We also unveil phase transitions for the\nexistence and uniqueness of locked solutions, in which all variables are\nfrozen. From a technical point of view we characterize atypical solutions with\na number of frozen variables different from the typical value via a large\ndeviation study of the dynamics of a stripping process (whitening) that unveils\nthe frozen variables of a solution, building upon recent works on atypical\ntrajectories of the bootstrap percolation dynamics. Our results also bear some\nrelevance from an algorithmic perspective, previous numerical studies having\nshown that heuristic algorithms of various kinds usually output unfrozen\nsolutions.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of two layers of incompressible electrically\nconducting fluid interacting with the magnetic field, which are confined within\na 3D horizontally infinite slab and separated by a free internal interface. We\nassume that the upper fluid is heavier than the lower fluid so that the fluids\nare susceptible to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Yet, we show that the\nviscous and non-resistive problem around the equilibrium is nonlinearly stable\nprovided that the strength of the vertical component of the steady magnetic\nfield, $|\\bar B_3|$, is greater than the critical value, $\\mathcal{M}_c$, which\nwe identify explicitly. We also prove that the problem is nonlinearly unstable\nif $|\\bar B_3|<\\mathcal{M}_c$. Our results indicate that the non-horizontal\nmagnetic field has strong stabilizing effect on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\nbut the horizontal one does not have in 3D.\n", "  We consider a smooth one-parameter family $t \\to f_t$ of diffeomorphisms with\ncompact transitive Axiom A attractors. Our first result (corrected) is that for\nany function $G$ in the Sobolev space $H^r_p$, with $p>1$ and $0<r<1/p$, the\nmap $R(t)$ sending $t$ to the average of $G$ with respect to the SRB measure of\n$f_t$ is $\\alpha$-H\\\"older continuous for all $\\alpha <r- |log \\mathcal\nJ|/(p|log \\nu_s|$) where $\\mathcal J\\le 1$ is the strongest volume contraction\nand $\\nu_s<1$ is the weakest contraction. This applies to\n$\\theta(x)=h(x)\\Theta(g(x)-a)$ (for all $\\alpha <1- |log \\mathcal J|/|log\n\\nu_s|$) for $h$ and $g$ smooth and $\\Theta$ the Heaviside function, if $a$ is\nnot a critical value of $g$. Our second result says that for any such function\nso that, in addition, the intersection of the set of points $x$ so that\n$g(x)=a$ with the support of $h$ is foliated by \"admissible stable leaves\" of\n$f_t$, the map $R(t)$ is differentiable. (We provide distributional linear\nresponse and fluctuation-dissipation formulas for the derivative.) Obtaining\nlinear response or fractional response for such observables is motivated by\nextreme-value theory. --- Second version, following the referee's comments: We\nexplain better the cone choices around (2.4). Appendix A contains information\non the Banach spaces. We added the paragraph containing (2.6) in the proof of\nTheorem 2.1. In the proof of Theorem 3.3, we do not need to introduce\nmollifiers. However, the new argument around (2.6) is not available here, so we\nmust replace the pair $(u-1, |s-1|)$ by $(u-2, |s-2|)$. This is why we now\nassume that $h$ is $C^3$ and that $g$ and the foliations are $C^4$. --- Third\nversion: We have added a corrigendum modifying the first result (Theorem 2.1).\n", "  In this short note, we consider a system of two rotors, one of which\ninteracts with a Langevin heat bath. We show that the system relaxes to its\ninvariant measure (steady state) no faster than a stretched exponential\n$\\exp(-c t^{1/2})$. This indicates that the exponent $1/2$ obtained earlier by\nthe present authors and J.-P. Eckmann for short chains of rotors is optimal.\n", "  The geodesics prescription in holographic approach in Lorentzian signature is\nvalid only for geodesics which connect spacelike-separated points at the\nboundary, since there are no timelike geodesics which reach the boundary. There\nis also no straightforward analytic Euclidean continuation for a general\nbackground, such as e. g. moving particle in AdS. We propose an improved\ngeodesic image method for two-point Lorentzian correlators which is valid for\narbitrary time intervals in case of the bulk spacetime deformed by point\nparticles. We illustrate that our prescription is consistent with the case when\nthe analytic continuation exists and with the quasigeodesics prescription used\nin previous work. We also discuss some other applications of the improved image\nmethod, such as holographic entanglement entropy and multiple particles in\nAdS3.\n", "  The muon spectrometer of the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) is equipped with a redundant system made of\nResistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) and Drift Tube (DT) chambers in the barrel, RPC\nand Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) in the endcap region. In this paper, the\nfirst results of the performance of the RPC system during 2015 with the LHC\nrunning at 13 TeV is presented. The stability of the RPC performance, in terms\nof efficiency, cluster size and noise, is reported.\n", "  Nonequilibrium physics of random events, or fluctuations, is a unique\nfingerprint of a given system. Here we demonstrate that in noninteracting\nsystems, whose dynamics is driven by Majorana states, the effective charge\n$e^*$, characterizing the electric current fluctuations, is fractional. This is\nin contrast to noninteracting Dirac systems with the trivial electronic charge,\n$e^*=e$. Quite the opposite, in the Majorana state we predict two different\nfractional effective charges at low and high energies, $e^*_l=e/2$ and\n$e^*_h=3e/2$, accessible at low and high bias voltages, respectively. We show\nthat while the low energy effective charge $e^*_l$ is sensitive to thermal\nfluctuations of the current, the high energy effective charge $e^*_h$ is robust\nagainst thermal noise. A unique fluctuation signature of Majorana fermions is,\ntherefore, encoded in the high voltage tails of the electric current noise\neasily accessible in experiments on strongly nonequilibrium systems even at\nhigh temperatures.\n", "  Using density functional theory, we investigate systematically mixed\nMA(Pb:Sn)X3 perovskites, where MA is CH3NH3+, and X is Cl, Br, or I. Ab initio\ncalculations of the orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic perovskite phases show\nthat the substitution of lead by tin has a much weaker influence on both\nstructure and cohesive energies than the substitution of the halogen. The\nthermodynamic stability of the MA(Pb:Sn)X3 mixtures at finite, non-zero\ntemperatures is studied within the Regular Solution Model. We predict that it\nwill be possible to create MA(Pb:Sn)I3 mixtures at any temperature. Our results\nimply that mixing is unlikely for the low-temperature phase of bromide and\nchloride compounds, where instead local clusters are more likely to form. We\nfurther predict that in the high-temperature cubic phase, Pb and Sn compounds\nwill mix for both MA(Pb:Sn)Br3 and MA(Pb:Sn)Cl3 due to the entropy contribution\nto the Helmholtz free energy.\n", "  The anomalies recently found by the LHCb collaboration in $B$-meson decays\nseem to point towards the existence of new physics coupled non-universally to\nmuons and electrons. We show that a beyond-the-Standard-Model dynamics with\nthese features naturally arises in models with a warped extra-dimension that\naim to solve the electroweak Hierarchy Problem. The attractiveness of our\nset-up is the fact that the dynamics responsible for generating the flavor\nanomalies is automatically present, being provided by the massive Kaluza--Klein\nexcitations of the electroweak gauge bosons. The flavor anomalies can be easily\nreproduced by assuming that the bottom and muon fields have a sizable amount of\ncompositeness, while the electron is almost elementary. Interestingly enough,\nthis framework correlates the flavor anomalies to a pattern of corrections in\nthe electroweak observables and in flavor-changing processes. In particular the\ndeviations in the bottom and muon couplings to the $Z$-boson and in $\\Delta F =\n2$ flavor-changing observables are predicted to be close to the present\nexperimental bounds, and thus potentially testable in near-future experiments.\n", "  We discuss optical chirality in different types of gyrotropic media. Our\nanalysis is based on the formalism of nongeometric symmetries of Maxwell's\nequations in vacuum generalized to material media with given constituent\nrelations. This approach enables us to derive directly conservation laws\nrelated to the nongeometric symmetries. For isotropic chiral media, we\ndemonstrate that likewise free electromagnetic field, both duality and helicity\ngenerators belong to the basis set of nongeometric symmetries that guarantees\nthe conservation of optical chirality. In gyrotropic crystals, which exhibit\nnatural optical activity, the situation is quite different from the case of\nisotropic media. For light propagating along certain crystallographic\ndirection, there arise two distinct cases, i.~e., (1) the duality is broken but\nthe helicity is preserved, or (2) only the duality symmetry survives. We show\nthat the existence of one of these symmetries (duality or helicity) is enough\nto define optical chirality. In addition, we present examples of low-symmetry\nmedia, where optical chirality can not be defined.\n", "  We announce the detection of recurring sets of recurring starspot occultation\nevents in the short-cadence K2 lightcurve of Qatar-2, a K dwarf star transited\nevery 1.34 d by a hot Jupiter. In total we detect 34 individual starspot\noccultation events, caused by five different starspots, occulted in up to five\nconsecutive transits or after a full stellar rotation. The longest recurring\nset of recurring starspot occultations spans over three stellar rotations,\nsetting a lower limit for the longest starspot lifetime of 58 d. Starspot\nanalysis provided a robust stellar rotational period measurement of\n$18.0\\pm0.2$ d and indicates that the system is aligned, having a sky-projected\nobliquity of $0\\pm8^{\\circ}$. A pronounced rotational modulation in the\nlightcurve has a period of $18.2\\pm1.6$ d, in agreement with the rotational\nperiod derived from the starspot occultations. We tentatively detect an\nellipsoidal modulation in the phase-curve, with a semi-amplitude of 18 ppm, but\ncannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of red noise or\nimperfect removal of the rotational modulation. We detect no transit-timing and\ntransit-duration variations with upper limits of 15 s and 1 min, respectively.\nWe also reject any additional transiting planets with transit depths above 280\nppm in the orbital period region 0.5-30 d.\n", "  A two-level atom cannot emit more than one photon at a time. As early as the\n1980s, this quantum feature was identified as a gateway to \"single-photon\nsources\", where a regular excitation sequence would create a stream of light\nparticles with photon number fluctuations below the shot noise. Such an\nintensity squeezed beam of light would be desirable for a range of applications\nsuch as quantum imaging, sensing, enhanced precision measurements and\ninformation processing. However, experimental realizations of these sources\nhave been hindered by large losses caused by low photon collection efficiencies\nand photophysical shortcomings. By using a planar metallo-dielectric antenna\napplied to an organic molecule, we demonstrate the most regular stream of\nsingle photons reported to date. Measured intensity fluctuations reveal 2.2 dB\nsqueezing limited by our detection efficiency, equivalent to 6.2 dB intensity\nsqueezing right after the antenna.\n", "  Observable operator models (OOMs) and related models are one of the most\nimportant and powerful tools for modeling and analyzing stochastic systems.\nThey exactly describe dynamics of finite-rank systems and can be efficiently\nand consistently estimated through spectral learning under the assumption of\nidentically distributed data. In this paper, we investigate the properties of\nspectral learning without this assumption due to the requirements of analyzing\nlarge-time scale systems, and show that the equilibrium dynamics of a system\ncan be extracted from nonequilibrium observation data by imposing an\nequilibrium constraint. In addition, we propose a binless extension of spectral\nlearning for continuous data. In comparison with the other continuous-valued\nspectral algorithms, the binless algorithm can achieve consistent estimation of\nequilibrium dynamics with only linear complexity.\n", "  We consider a head-on collision of two massive particles that move in the\nequatorial plane of an extremal Kerr black hole, which results in the\nproduction of two massless particles. Focusing on a typical case, where both of\nthe colliding particles have zero angular momenta, we show that a massless\nparticle produced in such a collision can escape to infinity with arbitrarily\nlarge energy in the near-horizon limit of the collision point. Furthermore, if\nwe assume that the emission of the produced massless particles is isotropic in\nthe center-of-mass frame but confined to the equatorial plane, the escape\nprobability of the produced massless particle approaches $5/12$ and almost all\nescaping massless particles have arbitrarily large energy at infinity and an\nimpact parameter approaching $2GM/c^2$, where $M$ is the mass of the black\nhole.\n", "  Thermal states are the bedrock of statistical physics. Nevertheless, when and\nhow they actually arise in closed quantum systems is not fully understood. We\nconsider this question for systems with local Hamiltonians on finite quantum\nlattices. In a first step, we show that states with exponentially decaying\ncorrelations equilibrate after a quantum quench. Then we show that the\nequilibrium state is locally equivalent to a thermal state, provided that the\nfree energy of the equilibrium state is sufficiently small and the thermal\nstate has exponentially decaying correlations. As an application, we look at a\nrelated important question: When are thermal states stable against noise? In\nother words, if we locally disturb a closed quantum system in a thermal state,\nwill it return to thermal equilibrium? We rigorously show that this occurs when\nthe correlations in the thermal state are exponentially decaying. All our\nresults come with finite-size bounds, which are crucial for the growing field\nof quantum thermodynamics and other physical applications.\n", "  We report a 65MHz-bandwidth triangular-shaped optical parametric oscillator\n(OPO) for squeezed vacuum generation at 860nm. The triangle structure of our\nOPO enables the round-trip length to reach 45mm as a ring cavity, which\nprovides a counter circulating optical path available for introducing a probe\nbeam or generating another squeezed vacuum. Hence our OPO is suitable for the\napplications in high-speed quantum information processing where two or more\nsqueezed vacua form a complicated interferometer, like continuous-variable\nquantum teleportation. With a homemade, broadband and low-loss homodyne\ndetector, a direct measurement shows 8.4dB of squeezing at 3MHz and also 2.4dB\nof squeezing at 100MHz.\n", "  A new rigorous approach for precise and efficient calculation of light\npropagation along non-uniform waveguides is presented. Resonant states of a\nuniform waveguide, which satisfy outgoing-wave boundary conditions, form a\nnatural basis for expansion of the local electromagnetic field. Using such an\nexpansion at fixed frequency, we convert the wave equation for light\npropagation in a non-uniform waveguide into an ordinary second-order matrix\ndifferential equation for the expansion coefficients depending on the\ncoordinate along the waveguide. We illustrate the method on several examples of\nnon-uniform planar waveguides and evaluate its efficiency compared to the\naperiodic Fourier modal method and the finite element method, showing\nimprovements of one to four orders of magnitude. A similar improvement can be\nexpected also for applications in other fields of physics showing wave\nphenomena, such as acoustics and quantum mechanics.\n", "  We study the thermalization of an ensemble of $N$ elementary,\narbitrarily-complex, quantum systems, mutually noninteracting but coupled as\nelectric or magnetic dipoles to a blackbody radiation. The elementary systems\ncan be all the same or belong to different species, distinguishable or\nindistinguishable, located at fixed positions or having translational degrees\nof freedom. Even if the energy spectra of the constituent systems are\nnondegenerate, as we suppose, the ensemble unavoidably presents degeneracies of\nthe energy levels and/or of the energy gaps. We show that, due to these\ndegeneracies, a thermalization analysis performed by the popular quantum\noptical master equation reveals a number of serious pathologies, possibly\nincluding a lack of ergodicity. On the other hand, a consistent thermalization\nscenario is obtained by introducing a Lindblad-based approach, in which the\nLindblad operators, instead of being derived from a microscopic calculation,\nare established as the elements of an operatorial basis with squared amplitudes\nfixed by imposing a detailed balance condition and requiring their\ncorrespondence with the dipole transition rates evaluated under the first-order\nperturbation theory. Due to the above-mentioned degeneracies, this procedure\nsuffers a basis arbitrariness which, however, can be removed by exploiting the\nfact that the thermalization of an ensemble of noninteracting systems cannot\ndepend on the ensemble size. As a result, we provide a clear-cut partitioning\nof the thermalization time into dissipation and decoherence times, for which we\nderive formulas giving the dependence on the energy levels of the elementary\nsystems, the size $N$ of the ensemble, and the temperature of the blackbody\nradiation.\n", "  We present a pilot study of Galactic globular cluster (GC) proper motion (PM)\ndeterminations using Gaia data. We search for GC stars in the Tycho-Gaia\nAstrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue from Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1), and\nidentify five members of NGC104 (47 Tucanae), one member of NGC5272 (M3), five\nmembers of NGC6121 (M4), seven members of NGC6397, and two members of NGC6656\n(M22). By taking a weighted average of member stars, fully accounting for the\ncorrelations between parameters, we estimate the parallax (and, hence,\ndistance) and PM of the GCs. This provides a homogeneous PM study of multiple\nGCs based on an astrometric catalog with small and well-controlled systematic\nerrors, and yields random PM errors similar to existing measurements. Detailed\ncomparison to the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements generally\nshows excellent agreement, validating the astrometric quality of both TGAS and\nHST. By contrast, comparison to ground-based measurements shows that some of\nthose must have systematic errors exceeding the random errors. Our parallax\nestimates have uncertainties an order of magnitude larger than previous\nstudies, but nevertheless imply distances consistent with previous estimates.\nBy combining our PM measurements with literature positions, distances, and\nradial velocities, we measure Galactocentric space motions for the clusters and\nfind that these also agree well with previous analyses. Our analysis provides a\nframework for determining more accurate distances and PMs of Galactic GCs using\nfuture Gaia data releases. This will provide crucial constraints on the near\nend of the cosmic distance ladder and provide accurate GC orbital histories.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of entanglement in ensembles consisting of an\narbitrary number of particles. Multipartite entanglement criteria in terms of\nobservables are formulated for a fixed number of particles as well as for\nsystems with a fluctuating particle number. To access the quality of the\nverified entanglement, the operational measure of the entanglement visibility\nis introduced. As an example, we perform an analytical characterization of\nquantum systems composed of interacting harmonic oscillators and witness the\nentanglement via energy measurements. Our analysis shows that the detectable\nentanglement decays for macroscopic particle numbers without the need for\ndecoherence processes and for all considered coupling regimes. We further study\nthermal states of the given correlated system together with the temperature\ndependence of entanglement.\n", "  We report a multi-resolution search for anisotropies in the arrival\ndirections of cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory with local\nzenith angles up to $80^\\circ$ and energies in excess of 4 EeV ($4 \\times\n10^{18}$ eV). This search is conducted by measuring the angular power spectrum\nand performing a needlet wavelet analysis in two independent energy ranges.\nBoth analyses are complementary since the angular power spectrum achieves a\nbetter performance in identifying large-scale patterns while the needlet\nwavelet analysis, considering the parameters used in this work, presents a\nhigher efficiency in detecting smaller-scale anisotropies, potentially\nproviding directional information on any observed anisotropies. No deviation\nfrom isotropy is observed on any angular scale in the energy range between 4\nand 8 EeV. Above 8 EeV, an indication for a dipole moment is captured; while no\nother deviation from isotropy is observed for moments beyond the dipole one.\nThe corresponding $p$-values obtained after accounting for searches blindly\nperformed at several angular scales, are $1.3 \\times 10^{-5}$ in the case of\nthe angular power spectrum, and $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ in the case of the needlet\nanalysis. While these results are consistent with previous reports making use\nof the same data set, they provide extensions of the previous works through the\nthorough scans of the angular scales.\n", "  We present the results of the search for gravitational waves (GWs) associated\nwith $\\gamma$-ray bursts detected during the first observing run of the\nAdvanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We find no\nevidence of a GW signal for any of the 41 $\\gamma$-ray bursts for which LIGO\ndata are available with sufficient duration. For all $\\gamma$-ray bursts, we\nplace lower bounds on the distance to the source using the optimistic\nassumption that GWs with an energy of $10^{-2}M_\\odot c^2$ were emitted within\nthe $16$-$500\\,$Hz band, and we find a median 90% confidence limit of 71$\\,$Mpc\nat 150$\\,$Hz. For the subset of 19 short/hard $\\gamma$-ray bursts, we place\nlower bounds on distance with a median 90% confidence limit of 90$\\,$Mpc for\nbinary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and 150 and 139$\\,$Mpc for neutron\nstar-black hole coalescences with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum\nand in a generic configuration, respectively. These are the highest distance\nlimits ever achieved by GW searches. We also discuss in detail the results of\nthe search for GWs associated with GRB 150906B, an event that was localized by\nthe InterPlanetary Network near the local galaxy NGC 3313, which is at a\nluminosity distance of 54$\\,$Mpc ($z=0.0124$). Assuming the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission is beamed with a jet half-opening angle $\\leq 30^{\\circ}$, we exclude\na BNS and a neutron star-black hole in NGC 3313 as the progenitor of this event\nwith confidence $>99$%. Further, we exclude such progenitors up to a distance\nof 102$\\,$Mpc and 170$\\,$Mpc, respectively.\n", "  The asymptotic behavior of the effective mass $m_{\\rm eff}(\\Lambda)$ of the\nso-called Nelson model in quantum field theory is considered, where $\\Lambda$\nis an ultraviolet cutoff parameter of the model. Let $m$ be the bare mass of\nthe model. It is shown that for sufficiently small coupling constant $|\\alpha|$\nof the model, $m_{{\\rm eff}}(\\Lambda)/m$ can be expanded as $m_{{\\rm\neff}}(\\Lambda)/m= 1+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n(\\Lambda) \\alpha^{2n}$. A physical\nfolklore is that $a_n(\\Lambda)\\sim [\\log \\Lambda]^{(n-1)}$ as $\\Lambda\\to\n\\infty$. It is rigorously shown that\n$$0<\\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty}a_1(\\Lambda)<C,\\quad C_1\\leq\n\\lim_{\\Lambda\\to\\infty}a_2(\\Lambda)/\\log\\Lambda\\leq C_2$$ with some constants\n$C$, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n", "  We consider a selection of recent experimental results on electroweak\n$W^{\\pm},\\,Z$ gauge boson production in $pp$ collisions at BNL RHIC and CERN\nLHC energies in comparison to prediction of perturbative QCD calculations based\non different sets of NLO parton distribution functions including the\nstatistical PDF model known from fits to the DIS data. We show that the current\nstatistical PDF parameterisation (fitted to the DIS data only) underestimates\nthe LHC data on $W^{\\pm},\\,Z$ gauge boson production cross sections at the NLO\nby about 20\\%. This suggests that there is a need to refit the parameters of\nthe statistical PDF including the latest LHC data.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to reconstruct and analyze the stability of some\ncosmological models against linear perturbations in $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity\n($\\mathcal{G}$ and $T$ represent the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, respectively). We formulate the field equations for\nboth general as well as particular cases in the context of isotropic and\nhomogeneous universe model. We reproduce the cosmic evolution corresponding to\nde Sitter universe, power-law solutions and phantom/non-phantom eras in this\ntheory using reconstruction technique. Finally, we study stability analysis of\nde Sitter as well as power-law solutions through linear perturbations.\n", "  We model a social-encounter network where linked nodes match for reproduction\nin a manner depending probabilistically on each node`s attractiveness. The\ndeveloped model reveals that increasing either the network`s mean degree or the\n``choosiness`` exercised during pair-formation increases the strength of\npositive assortative mating. That is, we note that attractiveness is correlated\namong mated nodes. Their total number also increases with mean degree and\nselectivity during pair-formation. By iterating over model mapping of parents\nonto offspring across generations, we study the evolution of attractiveness.\nSelection mediated by exclusion from reproduction increases mean\nattractiveness, but is rapidly balanced by skew in the offspring distribution\nof highly attractive mated pairs.\n", "  The values of electrical conductivity of plasma of stars with a magnetic\nfield or moving in the magnetic field of the other component in a binary system\ncould be of significant interest, since they are useful for the study of\nthermal evolution of such objects, cooling, nuclear burning of accreted matter,\nand the investigation of their magnetic fields. So, on the basis of numerically\ncalculated values for the dense plasma conductivity in an external HF electric\nfield, we determine the HF characteristics of astrophysical plasmas under\nextreme conditions. The examined range of frequencies covers the IR, visible\nand near UV regions and consider electronic number density and temperature are\nin the ranges of $10^{21} \\textrm{cm}^{-3} \\le Ne$ and 20 000 $\\le T$,\nrespectively. The method developed here represents a powerful tool for research\ninto white dwarfs with different atmospheric compositions (DA, DC etc.), and\nfor investigation of some other stars (M-type red dwarfs, Sun etc.).\n", "  We study locking phenomena of two strongly coupled, high-quality factor\nnanomechanical resonator modes subject to a common parametric drive at a single\ndrive frequency. By controlled dielectric gradient forces we tune the resonance\nfrequencies of the flexural in-plane and out-of-plane oscillation of the high\nstress silicon nitride string through their mutual avoided crossing. For the\ncase of the strong common parametric drive signal-idler generation via\nparametric oscillation is observed, analogously to the framework of nonlinear\noptical effects in an optical parametric oscillator. Frequency tuning of the\nsignal and idler resonances is demonstrated. When the resonance frequencies of\nsignal and idler get closer to each other, partial injection locking, injection\npulling and complete injection locking to half of the drive frequency occurs\ndepending on the pump strength. Furthermore, satellite resonances,\nsymmetrically off-set from signal and idler by their beat-note, are observed\nwhich can be attributed to degenerate four-wave-mixing in the highly nonlinear\nmechanical oscillations.\n", "  A magnetic coil operated at cryogenic temperatures is used to produce\nspatial, relative field gradients below 6 ppm/cm, stable for several hours. The\napparatus is a prototype of the magnetic components for a neutron electric\ndipole moment (nEDM) search, which will take place at the Spallation Neutron\nSource (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using ultra-cold neutrons (UCN).\nThat search requires a uniform magnetic field to mitigate systematic effects\nand obtain long polarization lifetimes for neutron spin precession\nmeasurements. This paper details upgrades to a previously described apparatus,\nparticularly the introduction of super-conducting magnetic shielding and the\nassociated cryogenic apparatus. The magnetic gradients observed are\nsufficiently low for the nEDM search at SNS.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study the quantum tunneling process for charged\nvector particles through the horizons of black holes by using Proca equation.\nFor this purpose, we have consider a pair of charged accelerating and rotating\nblack holes with NUT parameter and a black hole in $5D$ gauged supergravity,\nrespectively. Further, we have studied the tunneling probability and\ncorresponding Hawking temperature for both black holes by using WKB\napproximation.\n", "  We investigate minimal control power (MCP) for controlled dense coding\ndefined by the channel capacity. We obtain MCPs for extended three-qubit\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and generalized three-qubit $W$\nstates. Among those GHZ states, the standard GHZ state is found to maximize the\nMCP and so does the standard $W$ state among the $W$-type states. We find the\nlower and upper bounds of the MCP and show for pure states that the lower\nbound, zero, is achieved if and only if the three-qubit state is biseparable or\nfully separable. The upper bound is achieved only for the standard GHZ state.\nSince the MCP is nonzero only when a three-qubit entanglement exists, this\nquantity may be a good candidate to measure the degree of genuine tripartite\nentanglement.\n", "  Atmospheric channels are a promising candidate to establish secure quantum\ncommunication on a global scale. However, due to their turbulent nature, it is\ncrucial to understand the impact of the atmosphere on the quantum properties of\nlight and examine it experimentally. In this paper, we introduce a method to\nprobe atmospheric free-space links with quantum light on a laboratory scale. In\ncontrast to previous works, our method models arbitrary intensity losses caused\nby turbulence to emulate general atmospheric conditions. This allows us to\ncharacterize turbulent quantum channels in a well-controlled manner. To\nimplement this technique, we perform a series of measurements with different\nconstant attenuations and simulate the fluctuating losses by combining the\nobtained data. We directly test the proposed method with an on-chip source of\nnonclassical light and a time-bin-multiplexed detection system. With the\nobtained data, we characterize the nonclassicality of the generated states for\ndifferent atmospheric noise models and analyze a post-selection protocol. This\ngeneral technique in atmospheric quantum optics allows for studying turbulent\nquantum channels and predicting their properties for future applications.\n", "  By considering a deformation of the Schwarzschild metric in the presence of a\nminimal measurable length which still respects the equivalence principle, we\nstudy corrections to the standard general relativistic predictions for some\nastrophysical phenomena such as stability of circular orbits of black hole\naccretion disks, redshift of black hole accretion disks, gravitational tidal\nforces and the geodetic drift rate. We use the \\emph{Gravity Probe B} data to\nsee robustness of our results. Our analysis shows also that the relevant\ndeformation parameter $\\varepsilon$ which has a geometric origin, plays the\nsame role as the charge to mass ratio, $\\frac{e}{m}$ in the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m metric.\n", "  The primary science goal of the NASA-sponsored ANITA project is measurement\nof ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, observed via radio-frequency\nsignals resulting from a neutrino- or cosmic ray- interaction with terrestrial\nmatter (atmospheric or ice molecules, e.g.). Accurate inference of the energies\nof these cosmic rays requires understanding the transmission/reflection of\nradio wave signals across the ice-air boundary. Satellite-based measurements of\nAntarctic surface reflectivity, using a co-located transmitter and receiver,\nhave been performed more-or-less continuously for the last few decades.\nSatellite-based reflectivity surveys, at frequencies ranging from 2--45 GHz and\nat near-normal incidence, yield generally consistent reflectivity maps across\nAntarctica. Using the Sun as an RF source, and the ANITA-3 balloon borne\nradio-frequency antenna array as the RF receiver, we have also measured the\nsurface reflectivity over the interval 200-1000 MHz, at elevation angles of\n12-30 degrees, finding agreement with the Fresnel equations within systematic\nerrors. To probe low incidence angles, inaccessible to the Antarctic Solar\ntechnique and not probed by previous satellite surveys, a novel experimental\napproach (\"HiCal-1\") was devised. Unlike previous measurements, HiCal-ANITA\nconstitute a bi-static transmitter-receiver pair separated by hundreds of\nkilometers. Data taken with HiCal, between 200--600 MHz shows a significant\ndeparture from the Fresnel equations, constant with frequency over that band,\nwith the deficit increasing with obliquity of incidence, which we attribute to\nthe combined effects of possible surface roughness, surface grain effects,\nradar clutter and/or shadowing of the reflection zone due to Earth curvature\neffects.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional quantum system with an arbitrary number of\nhard-core particles on the lattice, which are subject to a deterministic\nattractive interaction as well as a random potential. Our choice of interaction\nis suggested by the spectral analysis of the XXZ quantum spin chain. The main\nresult concerns a version of high-disorder Fock-space localization expressed\nhere in the configuration space of hard-core particles. The proof relies on an\nenergetically motivated Combes-Thomas estimate and an effective one-particle\nanalysis. As an application, we show the exponential decay of the two-point\nfunction in the infinite system uniformly in the particle number.\n", "  A practical and efficient scheme for the higher order integration of the\nLandau-Lifschitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is presented. The method is based on\nextrapolation of the two-step explicit midpoint rule and incorporates adaptive\ntime step and order selection. We make use of a piecewise time-linear stray\nfield approximation to reduce the necessary work per time step. The\napproximation to the interpolated operator is embedded into the extrapolation\nprocess to keep in step with the hierarchic order structure of the scheme. We\nverify the approach by means of numerical experiments on a standardized NIST\nproblem and compare with a higher order embedded Runge-Kutta formula. The\nefficiency of the presented approach increases when the stray field computation\ntakes a larger portion of the costs for the effective field evaluation.\n", "  We investigate the role of greed on the lifetime of a random-walking forager\non an initially resource-rich lattice. Whenever the forager lands on a\nfood-containing site, all the food there is eaten and the forager can hop\n$\\mathcal{S}$ more steps without food before starving. Upon reaching an empty\nsite, the forager comes one time unit closer to starvation. The forager is also\ngreedy---given a choice to move to an empty or to a food-containing site in its\nlocal neighborhood, the forager moves preferentially towards food.\nSurprisingly, the forager lifetime varies non-monotonically with greed, with\ndifferent senses of the non-monotonicity in one and two dimensions. Also\nunexpectedly, the forager lifetime in one dimension has a huge peak for very\nnegative greed.\n", "  Stick-slip, manifest as intermittent tangential motion between two solids, is\na well-known friction instability that occurs in a number of natural and\nengineering systems. In the context of adhesive polymer interfaces, this\nphenomenon has often been solely associated with Schallamach waves, which are\ntermed slow waves due to their low propagation speeds. We study the dynamics of\na model polymer interface using coupled force measurements and high speed\n\\emph{in situ} imaging, to explore the occurrence of stick-slip linked to other\nslow wave phenomena. Two new waves---slip pulse and separation pulse---both\ndistinct from Schallamach waves, are described. The slip pulse is a sharp\nstress front that propagates in the same direction as the Schallamach wave,\nwhile the separation pulse involves local interface detachment and travels in\nthe opposite direction. Transitions between these stick-slip modes are easily\neffected by changing the sliding velocity or normal load. The properties of\nthese three waves, and their relation to stick-slip is elucidated. We also\ndemonstrate the important role of adhesion in effecting wave propagation.\n", "  We present a combination of measurements of the top quark mass by the D0\nexperiment in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels. We use all the data\ncollected in Run I (1992--1996) at $\\sqrt s=1.8$ TeV and Run II (2001--2011) at\n$\\sqrt s=1.96$ TeV of the Tevatron $p \\bar{p}$ collider, corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities of 0.1 fb$^{-1}$ and 9.7 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The\ncombined result is: $m_t = 174.95 \\pm0.40\\,{\\rm(stat)} \\pm\n0.64\\,{\\rm(syst)}\\,{\\rm{GeV}}=174.95 \\pm 0.75 \\, {\\rm{GeV}}$.\n", "  Rechargeable redox flow batteries with serpentine flow field designs have\nbeen demonstrated to deliver higher current density and power density in medium\nand large-scale stationary energy storage applications. Nevertheless, the\nfundamental mechanisms involved with improved current density in flow batteries\nwith flow field designs have not been understood. Here we report a maximum\ncurrent density concept associated with stoichiometric availability of\nelectrolyte reactant flow penetration through the porous electrode that can be\nachieved in a flow battery system with a \"zero-gap\"serpentine flow field\narchitecture. This concept can explain a higher current density achieved within\nallowing reactions of all species soluble in the electrolyte. Further\nvalidations with experimental data are confirmed by an example of a vanadium\nflow battery with a serpentine flow structure over carbon paper electrode.\n", "  Charge density wave (CDW) correlations feature prominently in the phase\ndiagram of the cuprates, motivating competing theories of whether fluctuating\nCDW correlations aid superconductivity or whether static CDW order coexists\nwith superconductivity in inhomogeneous or spatially modulated states. Here we\nreport Cu $L$-edge resonant x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS)\nmeasurements of CDW correlations in superconducting La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$\n$x=0.11$. Static CDW order is shown to exist in the superconducting state at\nlow temperatures and to persist up to at least 85\\% of the CDW transition\ntemperature. We discuss the implications of our observations for how\n\\emph{nominally} competing order parameters can coexist in the cuprates.\n", "  When reactive fluids flow through a dissolving porous medium, conductive\nchannels form, leading to fluid breakthrough. This phenomenon is important in\ngeologic carbon storage, where the dissolution of CO2 in water increases the\nacidity and produce microstructures significantly different from those in an\nintact reservoir. We demonstrate the controlling mechanism for the dissolution\npatterns in natural porous materials. This was done using numerical simulations\nbased on high resolution digital models of North Sea chalk. We tested three\nmodel scenarios, and found that aqueous CO2 dissolve porous media\nhomogeneously, leading to large breakthrough porosity. In contrast, CO2-free\nsolution develops elongated convective channels in porous media, known as\nwormholes, and resulting in small breakthrough porosity. We further show that a\nhomogeneous dissolution pattern appears because the sample size is smaller than\nthe theoretical size of a developing wormhole. The result indicates that the\npresence of dissolved CO2 expands the reactive subvolume of a porous medium,\nand thus enhances the geochemical alteration of reservoir structures and might\nundermine the sealing integrity of caprocks when minerals dissolve.\n", "  We apply the Izergin-Korepin analysis to the study of the projected\nwavefunctions of the generalized free-fermion model. We introduce a\ngeneralization of the $L$-operator of the six-vertex model by\nBump-Brubaker-Friedberg and Bump-McNamara-Nakasuji. We make the Izergin-Korepin\nanalysis to characterize the projected wavefunctions and show that they can be\nexpressed as a product of factors and certain symmetric functions which\ngeneralizes the factorial Schur functions. This result can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the Tokuyama formula for the factorial Schur functions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a transverse-field XY chain driven across quantum\ncritical points by noisy control fields. We characterize the defect density as\na function of the quench time and the noise strength, and demonstrate that the\ndefect productions for three quench protocols with different scaling exponents\nexhibit the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, whereby slower driving results in more\ndefects. The protocols are quenching through the boundary line between\nparamagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, quenching across the isolated\nmulticritical point and along the gapless line, respectively. We also show that\nthe optimal quench time to minimize defects scales as a universal power law of\nthe noise strength in all the three cases. Furthermore, by using quantum\nsimulation of the quench dynamics in the spin system with well-designed\nLandau-Zener crossings in pseudo-momentum space, we propose an experimentally\nfeasible scheme to test the predicted anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of this noisy\ntransverse-field XY chain with two-level systems under controllable\nfluctuations.\n", "  Semi-inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering off polarized 3He is\nstudied in a non-relativistic framework, using a distorted spin-dependent\nspectral function for 3He to take care of the final state interaction between\nthe observed pion and the remnant. A simple procedure is shown to be valuable\nfor the extraction of Sivers and Collins asymmetries for the neutron fromthe\ncorresponding asymmetries for 3He. To extend this study in a relativistic\nframework, a novel approach for a Poincar\\'e covariant description of nuclear\ndynamics is presented, based on the light-front Hamiltonian dynamics. The key\nquantity is the light-front spectral function, where both normalization and\nmomentum sum rule can be satisfied at the same time. Preliminary results are\ndiscussed for an initial analysis of the role of relativity in the EMC effect\nin 3He, and the generalization of the procedure for the extraction of neutron\nasymmetries within the light-front dynamics is outlined.\n", "  This is a brief tutorial review of the dynamics of the voter model and the\ninvasion process on complex networks.\n", "  Some types of solar flares are observed in X-shaped quadrupolar field\nconfiguration. To understand the magnetic energy storage in such a region, we\nstudied non-potential field formation in an X-shaped quadrupolar field region\nformed in the active region NOAA 11967, which produced three X-shaped M-class\nflares on February 2, 2014. Nonlinear force-free field modeling was applied to\na time series of vector magnetic field maps from the Solar Optical Telescope on\nboard Hinode and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. Our analysis of the temporal three-dimensional magnetic field\nevolution shows that the sufficient free energy had already been stored more\nthan 10 hours before the occurrence of the first M-class flare and that the\nstorage was observed in a localized region. In this localized region,\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) started to develop gradually from 9 hours before\nthe first M-class flare. One of the flare ribbons that appeared in the first\nM-class flare was co-spatial with the location of the QSLs, suggesting that the\nformation of the QSLs is important in the process of energy release. These QSLs\ndo not appear in the potential field calculation, indicating that they were\ncreated by the non-potential field. The formation of the QSLs was associated\nwith the transverse photospheric motion of the pre-emerged flux and the\nemergence of a new flux. This observation indicates that the occurrence of the\nflares requires the formation of QSLs in the non-potential field in which free\nmagnetic energy is stored in advance.\n", "  We build a background cluster candidate catalog from the Next Generation\nVirgo Cluster Survey, using our detection algorithm RedGOLD. The NGVS covers\n104$deg^2$ of the Virgo cluster in the $u^*,g,r,i,z$-bandpasses to a depth of $\ng \\sim 25.7$~mag (5$\\sigma$). Part of the survey was not covered or has shallow\nobservations in the $r$--band. We build two cluster catalogs: one using all\nbandpasses, for the fields with deep $r$--band observations ($\\sim 20 \\\ndeg^2$), and the other using four bandpasses ($u^*,g,i,z$) for the entire NGVS\narea. Based on our previous CFHT-LS W1 studies, we estimate that both of our\ncatalogs are $\\sim100\\%$($\\sim70\\%$) complete and $\\sim80\\%$ pure, at $z\\le\n0.6$($z\\lesssim1$), for galaxy clusters with masses of $M\\gtrsim10^{14}\\\nM_{\\odot}$. We show that when using four bandpasses, though the photometric\nredshift accuracy is lower, RedGOLD detects massive galaxy clusters up to\n$z\\sim 1$ with completeness and purity similar to the five-band case. This is\nachieved when taking into account the bias in the richness estimation, which is\n$\\sim40\\%$ lower at $0.5\\le z<0.6$ and $\\sim20\\%$ higher at $0.6<z< 0.8$, with\nrespect to the five-band case. RedGOLD recovers all the X-ray clusters in the\narea with mass $M_{500} > 1.4 \\times 10^{14} \\rm M_{\\odot}$ and $0.08<z<0.5$.\nBecause of our different cluster richness limits and the NGVS depth, our\ncatalogs reach to lower masses than the published redMaPPer cluster catalog\nover the area, and we recover $\\sim 90-100\\%$ of its detections.\n", "  We investigate crack propagation in a simple two-dimensional visco-elastic\nmodel and find a scaling regime in the relation between the propagation\nvelocity and energy release rate or fracture energy, together with lower and\nupper bounds of the scaling regime. On the basis of our result, the existence\nof the lower and upper bounds is expected to be universal or model-independent:\nthe present simple simulation model provides generic insight into the physics\nof crack propagation, and the model will be a first step towards the\ndevelopment of a more refined coarse-grained model. Relatively abrupt changes\nof velocity are predicted near the lower and upper bounds for the scaling\nregime and the positions of the bounds could be good markers for the\ndevelopment of tough polymers, for which we provide simple views that could be\nuseful as guiding principles for toughening polymer-based materials.\n", "  Extending the Standard Model with a new complex singlet scalar, right-handed\nneutrinos and a vector-like quark allows to simultaneously tackle several\nproblems in particle physics and cosmology within a constrained framework that\ncan be falsified by future probes of the cosmic microwave background, as well\nas by upcoming axion experiments. This Standard Model - Axion - Seesaw - H\nportal inflation theory (SMASH) provides predictive inflation and $H$ boson\nstabilization, and can explain baryogenesis, light neutrino masses, dark matter\nand the strong CP problem. The model contains a unique new mass scale which\ncoincides with the axion decay constant, and also sets the scale for\nperturbative lepton-number violation processes. Testable predictions include a\nminimum value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\\gtrsim 0.004$, a running of\nthe spectral index $\\alpha\\gtrsim-8\\times10^{-4}$, a change $\\delta N_{\\rm\neff}\\sim 0.03$ in the number of effective relativistic neutrinos, and an axion\nmass in the range $50\\mu eV\\leq m_A \\leq 200 \\mu eV$.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to investigate the stable/unstable regimes of the\nnon-static anisotropic filamentary stellar models in the framework of\n$f(R,T,R_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\nu})$ gravity. We construct the field equations and\nconservation laws in the perspective of this gravity. The perturbation scheme\nis applied to analyze the behavior of a particular\n$f(R,T,R_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\nu})$ cosmological model on the evolution of\ncylindrical system. The role of adiabatic index is also checked in the\nformulations of instability regions. We have explored the instability\nconstraints at Newtonian and post-Newtonian limits. Our results reinforce the\nsignificance of adiabatic index and dark source terms in the stability analysis\nof celestial objects in modified gravity.\n", "  Expressions for the electron power loss F(T) and mobility {\\mu}_p due to\nacoustic phonon scattering are given in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen (BG) regime for\nthree- and two- dimensional electron gas in semiconductors and Dirac-fermions.\nWe obtain a simple relation F(T) {\\mu}_p = {\\eta}ev_s^2, where {\\eta} (~1) is a\nconstant, e is the electron charge and v_s is acoustic phonon velocity. It is\nfound to be independent of temperature and electron concentration. This\nrelation is applied to GaAs heterojucntions and graphene, to obtain {\\mu}_p\nfrom the measured F(T). We propose that, using this relation, the measurements\nof F(T), in BG regime, which depends exclusively upon acoustic phonons\ncoupling, could serve as a tool to determine the low temperature {\\mu}_p, which\nis otherwise difficult to measure due to the contributions from disorders\n", "  We comparatively study the excitonic insulator state in the extended\nFalicov-Kimball model (EFKM, a spinless two-band model) on the two-dimensional\nsquare lattice using the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and the\ncluster dynamical impurity approximation (CDIA). In the latter, the\nparticle-bath sites are included in the reference cluster to take into account\nthe particle-number fluctuations in the correlation sites. We thus calculate\nthe particle-number distribution, order parameter, ground-state phase diagram,\nanomalous Green's function, and pair coherence length, thereby demonstrating\nthe usefulness of the CDIA in the discussion of the excitonic condensation in\nthe EFKM.\n", "  Cross section of the neutron capture reaction $n+p\\rightarrow d+\\gamma$ at\nthreshold was calculated with different realistic $^{3}S_{1}$ deuteron and\n$^{1}S_{0}$ $np$ scattering wave functions stemming from Nijmegen-II, JISP16,\nParis, Idaho and Moscow (with forbidden states) potentials. It is found that\nthis reaction with thermal neutrons may be described without a contribution of\nmeson exchange currents.\n", "  We present gap solitons (GSs) that can be created in free nearly\ntwo-dimensional (2D) space in dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensates with the\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC), subject to tight confinement, with size $a_{\\perp\n}$, in the third direction. For quasi-2D patterns, with lateral sizes $l\\gg\na_{\\perp }$, the kinetic-energy terms in the respective spinor Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations may be neglected in comparison with SOC. This gives rise to a bandgap\nin the system's spectrum, in the presence of the Zeeman splitting between the\nspinor components. While the present system with contact interactions does not\nproduce 2D solitons, stable gap solitons(GSs), with vorticities $0$ and $1$ in\nthe two components, are found, in quasi-analytical and numerical forms, under\nthe action of dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). Namely, isotropic and\nanisotropic 2D GSs are obtained when the dipoles are polarized, respectively,\nperpendicular or parallel to the 2D plane. The GS families extend, as\n\\textit{embedded solitons} (ESs), into spectral bands, a part of the ES branch\nbeing stable for isotropic solitons. The GSs remain stable if the competing\ncontact interaction, with the sign opposite to that of the DDI, is included,\nwhile the addition of the contact term with the same sign destabilizes the GSs,\nat first replacing them by breathers, and eventually leading to destruction of\nthe solitons. Mobility and collision of the GSs are studied too, revealing\nnegative and positive effective masses of the isotropic and anisotropic\nsolitons, respectively.\n", "  We demonstrate a close connection between observed field-induced\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order and quantum critical fluctuation (QCF) in the\nZn7%-doped heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5. Magnetization, specific heat,\nand electrical resistivity at low temperatures all show the presence of new\nfield-induced AFM order under the magnetic field B of 5-10 T, whose order\nparameter is clearly distinguished from the low-field AFM phase observed for B\n< 5 T and the superconducting phase for B < 3 T. The 4f electronic specific\nheat divided by the temperature, C_e/T, exhibits -lnT dependence at B~10 T (=\nB_0), and furthermore, the C_e/T data for B >= B_0 are well scaled by the\nlogarithmic function of B and T: ln[(B-B_0)/T^{2.7}]. These features are quite\nsimilar to the scaling behavior found in pure CeCoIn5, strongly suggesting that\nthe field-induced QCF in pure CeCoIn5 originates from the hidden AFM order\nparameter equivalent to high-field AFM order in Zn7%-doped CeCoIn5.\n", "  This work deals with the effects of an apex predator on the cyclic\ncompetition among three distinct species that follow the rules of the\nrock-paper-scissors game. The investigation develops standard stochastic\nsimulations but is motivated by a novel procedure which is explained in the\nwork. We add the apex predator as the fourth species in the system that\ncontains three species that evolve following the standard rules of migration,\nreproduction and predation, and study how the system evolves in this new\nenvironment, in comparison with the case in the absence of the apex predator.\nThe results show that the apex predator engenders the tendency to spread\nuniformly in the lattice, contributing to destroy the spiral patterns, keeping\nbiodiversity but diminishing the average size of the clusters of the species\nthat compete cyclically.\n", "  We utilize a generalized Irving-Kirkwood procedure to derive the hydrodynamic\nequations of an active matter suspension with internal structure and driven by\ninternal torque. The internal structure and torque of the active Brownian\nparticles give rise to a balance law for internal angular momentum density,\nmaking the hydrodynamic description a polar theory of continuum mechanics. We\nderive exact microscopic expressions for the stress tensor, couple stress\ntensor, internal energy density, and heat flux vector. Unlike passive matter,\nthe symmetry of the stress tensor is broken explicitly due to active internal\ntorque and the antisymmetric component drives the internal angular momentum\ndensity. These results provide a molecular basis to understand the transport\ncharacteristics and collectively provide a strategy to develop the theory of\nlinear irreversible thermodynamics of active matter.\n", "  The study of covariances (or positive definite functions) on the sphere (the\nEarth, in our motivation) goes back to Bochner and Schoenberg (1940--42) and to\nthe first author (1969, 1973), among others. Extending to the geotemporal case\n(sphere cross line, for position and time) was for a long time an obstacle to\ngeostatistical modelling. The characterisation question here was raised by the\nauthors and Mijatovi\\'c in 2016, and answered by Berg and Porcu in 2017.\nExtensions to multiple products (of spheres and lines) follows similarly\n(Guella, Menegatto and Peron, 2016). We survey results of this type, and\nrelated applications e.g. in numerical weather prediction.\n", "  We study the quantum cosmology of a quadratic $f(R)$ theory with a FRW\nmetric, via one of its equivalent Horndeski type actions, where the dynamics of\nthe scalar field is induced. The classical equations of motion and the\nWeeler-deWitt equation, in their exact versions, are solved numerically. From\nthe choice of a free parameter in the action follow two cases, inflation + exit\nand inflation alone. The numerical solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\ndepends strongly on the boundary conditions, which can be chosen so that the\nresulting wave function of the universe seems to be normalizable and consistent\nwith hermitian operators.\n", "  The NSF Workshop in Quantum Information and Computation for Chemistry\nassembled experts from directly quantum-oriented fields such as algorithms,\nchemistry, machine learning, optics, simulation, and metrology, as well as\nexperts in related fields such as condensed matter physics, biochemistry,\nphysical chemistry, inorganic and organic chemistry, and spectroscopy. The goal\nof the workshop was to summarize recent progress in research at the interface\nof quantum information science and chemistry as well as to discuss the\npromising research challenges and opportunities in the field. Furthermore, the\nworkshop hoped to identify target areas where cross fertilization among these\nfields would result in the largest payoff for developments in theory,\nalgorithms, and experimental techniques. The ideas can be broadly categorized\nin two distinct areas of research that obviously have interactions and are not\nseparated cleanly. The first area is quantum information for chemistry, or how\nquantum information tools, both experimental and theoretical can aid in our\nunderstanding of a wide range of problems pertaining to chemistry. The second\narea is chemistry for quantum information, which aims to discuss the several\naspects where research in the chemical sciences can aid progress in quantum\ninformation science and technology. The results of the workshop are summarized\nin this report.\n", "  We discuss the derivation of a low-energy effective field theory of phase\n(Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) modes of the pairing field from a microscopic\ntheory of attractive fermions. The coupled equations for Goldstone and Higgs\nfields are critically analyzed in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover both in three spatial dimensions and\nin two spatial dimensions. The crucial role of pair fluctuations is\ninvestigated, and the beyond-mean-field Gaussian theory of the BCS-BEC\ncrossover is compared with available experimental data of the two-dimensional\nultracold Fermi superfluid.\n", "  The Berry curvature involving time and momentum derivatives, which we term\nemergent electric field, induces a nondisspative current known as the adiabatic\ncharge pumping or Thouless pumping in periodically driven systems. We study\ndissipative currents originated from the interplay between emergent electric\nfields and electric/magnetic fields in two and three dimensions on the basis of\nthe Boltzmann transport theory. As an example of two-dimensional models, we\nstudy the Rashba Hamiltonian with time-dependent and anisotropic spin-orbit\ncoupling. We show that the interplay between emergent electric fields and\nelectric fields leads to a current transverse to electric fields, which is\nsymmetric and contributes to the entropy production. As an example of\nthree-dimensional models, we study the Weyl Hamiltonian under AC electric\nfields. We show that the interplay between emergent electric fields and\nmagnetic fields leads to a Hall-type current at zero DC electric fields, which\nis now transverse to DC magnetic fields: $j_{x}=\\sigma_{xy}B_y$\n($\\sigma_{xy}=-\\sigma_{yx}$). The Hall photocurrent is relevant in the\ninversion symmetry breaking Weyl semimetals such as TaAs or SrSi$_2$.\n", "  We show that a type of two-body interaction, which depends on the momentum of\nthe center of mass (COM) of these two particles, can be realized in ultracold\natom gases with a laser-modulated magnetic Feshbach resonance (MFR). Here the\nMFR is modulated by two laser beams propagating along different directions,\nwhich can induce Raman transition between two-body bound states. The Doppler\neffect causes the two-atom scattering length to be strongly dependent on the\nCOM momentum of these two atoms. As a result, the effective two-atom\ninteraction is COM-momentum dependent, while the one-atom free Hamiltonian is\nstill the simple kinetic energy p^2/(2m).\n", "  SnSe is a topical thermoelectric material with a low thermal conductivity\nwhich is linked to its unique crystal structure. We use low-temperature heat\ncapacity measurements to demonstrate the presence of two characteristic\nvibrational energy scales in SnSe with Debye temperatures thetaD1 = 345(9) K\nand thetaD2 = 154(2) K. These hard and soft substructures are quantitatively\nlinked to the strong and weak Sn-Se bonds in the crystal structure. The heat\ncapacity model predicts the temperature evolution of the unit cell volume,\nconfirming that this two-substructure model captures the basic thermal\nproperties. Comparison with phonon calculations reveals that the soft\nsubstructure is associated with the low energy phonon modes that are\nresponsible for the thermal transport. This suggests that searching for\nmaterials containing highly divergent bond distances should be a fruitful route\nfor discovering low thermal conductivity materials.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the decuplet (T) to octet (B) baryon\n($T\\rightarrow B\\gamma$) transition magnetic moments to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order and electric quadruple moments to the\nnext-to-leading order in the framework of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation\ntheory. Our calculation includes the contributions from both the intermediate\ndecuplet and octet baryon states in the loops. Our results show reasonably good\nconvergence of the chiral expansion and agreement with the experimental data.\nThe analytical expressions may be useful to the chiral extrapolation of the\nlattice simulations of the decuplet electromagnetic properties.\n", "  Propagation of energetic particles across the mean field direction in\nturbulent magnetic fields is often described as spatial diffusion. Recently, it\nhas been suggested that initially the particles propagate systematically along\nmeandering field lines, and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive\ncross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of\n1--100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant\nbackground magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the\nnon-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence\nparameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the\nparticles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently meandering\nfield lines. This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already\nat the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field\ndirection, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The\ncross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens\nof hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during\nsolar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their\ninitial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean\nfield reaches time-asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to\nunderstand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling\nmust include non-diffusive particle propagation along meandering field lines.\n", "  The era of the Square Kilometre Array is almost upon us, and pathfinder\ntelescopes are already in operation. This brief review summarizes our current\nknowledge of extragalactic radio sources, accumulated through six decades of\ncontinuum surveys at the low-frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum and\nthe extensive complementary observations at other wavelengths necessary to gain\nthis understanding. The relationships between radio survey data and surveys at\nother wavelengths are discussed. Some of the outstanding questions are\nidentified and prospects over the next few years are outlined.\n", "  The influence of the B-site ion substitutions in\n(1-x)(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3-xBaTiO3 system of solid solutions on the relative\nstability of the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases has been studied.\nThe ions of zirconium, tin, along with (In0.5Nb0.5), (Fe0.5Nb0.5), (Al0.5V0.5)\nion complexes have been used as substituting elements. An increase in the\nconcentration of the substituting ion results in a near linear variation in the\nsize of the crystal lattice cell. Along with the cell size variation a change\nin the relative stability of the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases\ntakes place according to the changes of the tolerance factor of the solid\nsolution. An increase in the tolerance factor leads to the increase in the\ntemperature of the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase transition, and vice\nversa. All obtained results demonstrate the predominant influence of the ion\nsize factor on the relative stability of the ferroelectric and\nantiferroelectric states in the (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-based solid solutions and\nindicate the way for raising the temperature of the\nferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase transition.\n", "  Nematic shells are colloidal particles coated with nematic liquid crystal\nmolecules which may freely glide and rotate on the colloid's surface while\nkeeping their long axis on the local tangent plane. We describe the nematic\norder on a shell by a unit director field on an orientable surface. Equilibrium\nfields can then be found by minimising the elastic energy, which in general is\na function of the surface gradient of the director field. We learn how to\nextract systematically out of this energy a fossil component, related only to\nthe surface and its curvatures, which expresses a curvature potential for the\nmolecular torque. At hyperbolic points on the colloid's surface, and only\nthere, the alignment preferred by the curvature potential may fail to be a\ndirection of principal curvature. There the fossil energy becomes bistable.\n", "  We consider 28 particle-based simulations aimed at comparing the\ngravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric, uniform gas core in which\ntwo extreme types of turbulent spectra of velocity have been initially induced,\nso that $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{v}=0 $ (14 simulations) and $\\nabla \\times \\vec{v}=0\n$ (14 simulations). For all the simulations, the ratios of the kinetic energy\nand thermal energy to the gravitational energy were fixed at $\\beta$=0.21 and\n$\\alpha$=0.24, respectively. Most of the simulations finish by forming a single\nprotostar, except for two simulations that form a binary system of protostars.\nIn order to quantify the differences (or similarities) between the two types of\nsimulations, we calculate some integral properties of the resulting protostars,\nsuch as the mass M$_f$ and the ratios $\\alpha_f$ and $\\beta_f$\n", "  The reliability and safety of lithium-ion batteries can be affected by\noverheating issues. Phase change materials like paraffin due to their large\nheat capacities are among the best solutions for the thermal management of\nbatteries. In this investigation, multiscale modelling techniques were\ndeveloped to explore the efficiency in the thermal management of rechargeable\nbatteries through employing the paraffin composite structures. A combined\natomistic-continuum multiscale modelling was conducted to evaluate the thermal\nconductivity of paraffin reinforced with graphene or hexagonal boron-nitride\nnanosheet additives. In addition, heat generation during a battery service was\nsimulated using the Newman's electrochemical model. Finally, three-dimensional\nheat transfer models were constructed to investigate the effectiveness of\nvarious paraffin composite structures in the thermal management of a battery\nsystem. Interestingly, it was found that the thermal conductivity of paraffin\nnanocomposites can be enhanced by several times but that does not yield\nsignificant improvement in the batteries thermal management over the pure\nparaffin. The acquired findings can be useful not only for the modelling of\nnanocomposites but more importantly for the improvement of phase change\nmaterials design to enhance the thermal management of rechargeable batteries\nand other electronic devices.\n", "  We have investigated the effect of unconventional pairing mechanism in MgB2\nusing a two-band model within the framework of Bogoliubov-Valatin formalism.\nThe approach incorporates the intra- band s-wave interaction in the s- and\np-bands, as well as interband s-wave interaction between them. The analysis\nassumes the pairing interaction matrix comprises of attractive electron-phonon,\ncharge fluctuation and repulsive electron-electron (Coulomb) interactions to\naccount for superconductivity in MgB2. The model is used to estimate the\ntransition temperature and isotope effect exponent as well as to elucidate the\nimportance of interband contributions in the superconductivity of the system.\n", "  We present the solutions of the energy spectrum of charge carriers confined\nin quantum ring in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene subjected to a perpendicular\nmagnetic field. The calculations were performed in the context of the continuum\nmodel by solving the Dirac equation for a zero width ring geometry, i.e.\nfreezing out the carrier radial motion. We show that the obtained energy\nspectrum exhibits different symmetries with respect to the magnetic field and\nother parameters. The application of a potential shift the energy spectrum\nvertically while the application of a magnetic field breaks all symmetries. We\ncompare our results with those of of the ideal quantum ring in monolayer and\nbilayer graphene.\n", "  This note presents Godunov variables and 4-potentials for the relativistic\nEuler equations of barotropic fluids. The associated additional conservation/\nproduction law has different interpretations for different fluids. In\nparticular it refers to ENTROPY in the case of thermobarotropic fluids, and to\nMATTER in the case of isentropic fluids. The paper also presents an explicit\nformula for the generating function of the Euler equations in the case of ideal\ngases. It pursues ideas on symmetric hyperbolicity going back to Godunov (cf.\nalso Lax and Friedrichs as well as Boillat) that were elaborated as Ruggeri and\nStrumia's theory of convex covariant density systems.\n", "  The quantum dot arrays (QDAs) embedded into inhomogeneous nanowires connected\nto metallic electrodes show an electron heat rectification effect, which is\nattributed to the thermal voltage arising from a temperature bias and the QDA\nwith a broken spatial inversion symmetry. The staircase energy levels of QDAs\ncan be controlled to the resonant and off resonant transports for electrons in\nthe forward and backward temperature biases, respectively. The effect of\nelectron Coulomb interactions on the rectification efficiency of heat diode is\nclarified by the case of double QDs. We find that it is important to reduce\nphonon heat currents for implementing a high efficient electron heat diode at\nhigh temperature.\n", "  For one decade, the spectral-type and age of the $\\rho$ Oph object IRS-48\nwere subject to debates and mysteries. Modelling its disk with mid-infrared to\nmillimeter observations led to various explanations to account for the complex\nintricacy of dust-holes and gas-depleted regions. We present multi-epoch\nhigh-angular-resolution interferometric near-infrared data of\nspatially-resolved emissions in its first 15AU, known to have very strong\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions within this dust-depleted\nregion. We make use of new Sparse-Aperture-Masking data to instruct a revised\nradiative-transfer model where SED fluxes and interferometry are jointly\nfitted. Neutral and ionized PAH, Very Small Grains (VSG) and classical\nsilicates are incorporated into the model; new stellar parameters and\nextinction laws are explored. A bright (42L$_{\\odot}$) central-star with\nA$_v$=12.5mag and R$_v$=6.5 requires less near-infrared excess: the inner-most\ndisk at $\\approx$1AU is incompatible with the data. The revised stellar\nparameters place this system on a 4 Myr evolutionary track, 4 times younger\nthan previous estimations, in better agreement with the surrounding $\\rho$ Oph\nregion and disk-lifetimes observations. The disk-structure converges to a\nclassical-grains outer-disk from 55AU combined with a fully resolved\nVSG\\&PAH-ring, at 11-26 AU. We find two over-luminosities in the PAH-ring at\ncolor-temperatures consistent with the radiative transfer simulations; one\nfollows a Keplerian circular orbit at 14AU. We show a depletion of a factor\n$\\approx$5 of classical dust grains compared to VSG\\&PAH: the IRS-48 disk is\nnearly void of dust-grains in the first 55 AU. A 3.5M$_{Jup}$ planet on a 40AU\norbit qualitatively explains the new disk-structure.\n", "  A human-robotic \"Moon Village\" would offer significant scientific\nopportunities by providing an infrastructure on the lunar surface. An analogy\nwould be the way in which human outposts in Antarctica facilitate research\nactivities across multiple scientific disciplines on that continent. Scientific\nfields expected to benefit from a Moon Village will include: planetary science,\nastronomy, astrobiology, life sciences, and fundamental physics. In addition, a\nMoon Village will help develop the use of lunar resources, which will yield\nadditional longer-term scientific benefits.\n", "  We study three-dimensional optical Anderson localization in medium with a\npercolating disorder, where the percolating clusters are filled by the light\nnanoemitters in the excited state. The peculiarity of situation is that in such\nmaterials the field clusters join a fractal radiating system where the light is\nboth emitted and scattered by the inhomogeneity of clusters. Our numerical FDTD\nsimulations found that in this nonlinear compound the number of localized field\nbunches drastically increases after the lasing starts. At longer times the\nbunches leave nonlinear percolating structure and are radiated from the medium.\nMonitoring the output of system allows to observe experimentally such dynamic\nlocalized bunches in three-dimensional setup.\n", "  Ultrahigh-resolution optical strain sensors provide powerful tools in various\nscientific and engineering fields, ranging from long-baseline interferometers\nto civil and aerospace industries. Here we demonstrate an ultrahigh-resolution\nfibre strain sensing method by directly detecting the time-of-flight (TOF)\nchange of the optical pulse train generated from a free-running passively\nmode-locked laser (MLL) frequency comb. We achieved a local strain resolution\nof 18 p{\\epsilon}/Hz1/2 and 1.9 p{\\epsilon}/Hz1/2 at 1 Hz and 3 kHz,\nrespectively, with largedynamic range of >154 dB at 3 kHz. For remote-point\nsensing at 1-km distance, 80 p{\\epsilon}/Hz1/2 (at 1 Hz) and 2.2\np{\\epsilon}/Hz1/2 (at 3 kHz) resolution is demonstrated. While attaining both\nultrahigh resolution and large dynamic range, the demonstrated method can be\nreadily extended for multiple-point sensing as well by taking advantage of the\nbroad optical comb spectra. These advantages may allow various applications of\nthis sensor in geophysical science, structural health monitoring, and\nunderwater science.\n", "  Conventional imaging at low light level requires hundreds of detected photons\nper pixel to suppress the Poisson noise for accurate reflectivity inference. In\nthis letter, we propose a high-efficiency photon-limited imaging technique,\ncalled first-photon ghost imaging, which recovers image from the first-photon\ndetection by exploiting the physics of low-flux measurements and the framework\nof ghost imaging. The experimental results demonstrated that it could retrieve\nan image by only 0.1 photon detection per pixel, which is three orders lower\nthan the conventional imaging technique. The SNR model of the system has been\nestablished for noise analysing. Our technique is supposed to have applications\nin many fields, ranging from biological microscopy to remote sensing.\n", "  Development of physical cryptographic primitives for generating strong\nsecurity keys is central to combating security threats such as counterfeiting\nand unauthorized access to electronic devices. We introduce a new class of\nphysical cryptographic primitives from layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)\nwhich leverages the unique properties of this material system. Using chemical\nvapor deposition, we synthesize a MoS2 monolayer film covered with speckles of\nmultilayer islands, where the growth process is engineered for an optimal\nspeckle density. The physical cryptographic primitive is an array of 2048\npixels fabricated from this film. Using the Clark-Evans test, we confirm that\nthe distribution of islands on the film exhibits complete spatial randomness,\nmaking this cryptographic primitive ideal for security applications. A unique\noptical response is generated by applying an optical stimulus to the structure.\nThe basis for this unique response is the dependence of the photoemission on\nthe number of MoS2 layers which by design is random throughout the film. The\noptical response is used to generate cryptographic keys. Standard security\ntests confirm the uniqueness, reliability, and uniformity of these keys. This\nstudy reveals a new opportunity for generating strong and versatile\nnano-engineered security primitives from layered transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the characteristics and properties of a\ntraversable wormhole constrained by the current astrophysical observations in\nthe framework of modified theories of gravity (MOG). As a concrete case, we\nstudy traversable wormhole space--time configurations in the\nDvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) braneworld scenario, which are supported by the\neffects of the gravity leakage of extra dimensions. We find that the wormhole\nspace--time structure will open in terms of the $2\\sigma$ confidence level when\nwe utilize the joint constraints supernovae (SNe) Ia + observational Hubble\nparameter data (OHD) + Planck + gravitational wave (GW) and $z<0.2874$.\nFurthermore, we obtain several model-independent conclusions, such as (i) the\nexotic matter threading the wormholes can be divided into four classes during\nthe evolutionary processes of the universe based on various energy conditions;\n(ii) we can offer a strict restriction to the local wormhole space--time\nstructure by using the current astrophysical observations; and (iii) we can\nclearly identify a physical gravitational resource for the wormholes supported\nby astrophysical observations, namely the dark energy components of the\nuniverse or equivalent space--time curvature effects from MOG. Moreover, we\nfind that the strong energy condition is always violated at low redshifts.\n", "  We provide physics-inspired derivations of a number of algorithms for\ncomputing the permanent of a matrix. In particular we formulate the computation\nof the permanent as a Grassmann integral that may be viewed as an interacting\nmany-fermion problem. Applying a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling then\ngives approximation schemes that are equivalent to the familiar determinant\nMonte Carlo algorithm. This leads to elementary derivations of the well-known\nestimators of Godsil-Gutman and Karmarkar et al. Another straightfoward\nmanipulation of the Grassmann integral, making use of gauge invariance, gives\nthe efficient exact formula of Glynn. In addition to these known results we\nalso give some additional estimators and formulas that are natural in our\nformulation.\n", "  Nascent neutron stars with millisecond periods and magnetic fields in excess\nof $10^{16}$ Gauss can drive highly energetic and asymmetric explosions known\nas magnetar-powered supernovae. These exotic explosions are one theoretical\ninterpretation for supernovae Ic-BL which are sometimes associated with long\ngamma-ray bursts. Twisted magnetic field lines extract the rotational energy of\nthe neutron star and release it as a disk wind or a jet with energies greater\nthan 10$^{52}$ erg over $\\sim 20$ sec. What fractions of the energy of the\ncentral engine go into the wind and the jet remain unclear. We have performed\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of magnetar-powered supernovae (SNe)\ndriven by disk winds and jets with the CASTRO code to investigate the effect of\nthe central engine on nucleosynthetic yields, mixing, and light curves. We find\nthat these explosions synthesize less than 0.05 Msun of Ni and that this mass\nis not very sensitive to central engine type. The morphology of the explosion\ncan provide a powerful diagnostic of the properties of the central engine. In\nthe absence of a circumstellar medium these events are not very luminous, with\npeak bolometric magnitudes $M_b \\sim -16.5 $ due to low Ni production.\n", "  Magnetar-powered supernova explosions are competitive models for explaining\nvery luminous optical transits. However, these explosion models were mainly\ncalculated in 1D. Radiation emitted from the magnetar snowplows into the\nprevious supernovae ejecta and causes a nonphysical dense shell (spike) found\nin previous 1D studies. This suggests that strong fluid instabilities may have\ndeveloped within the magnetar-powered supernovae. Such fluid instabilities\nemerge at the region where luminous transits later occur, so they can affect\nthe consequent observational signatures. We examine the magnetar-powered\nsupernovae with 2D hydrodynamics simulations and find that the 1D dense shell\ntransforms into the development of Rayleigh-Taylor and thin shell instabilities\nin 2D. The resulting mixing is able to fragment the entire shell and break the\nspherical symmetry of supernovae ejecta.\n", "  The concept of BPHZ renormalization is translated into configuration space. A\nnew version of the convergence theorem by means of Zimmermann's forest formula\nis proved and a sufficient condition for the existence of the constant coupling\nlimit is derived in the new setting.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamics of non-interacting and interacting\nholographic dark energy models in the framework of Brans-Dicke theory. As\nsystem's infra-red cut-off we consider the future event horizon. The motivation\nof this work is to use the logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field,\n$\\phi \\propto ln(\\alpha+\\beta a)$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants and\n`a' is the scalar factor as proposed Kumar and Singh in a recent work to study\nthe new agegraphic dark energy models. We find the time-dependent equation of\nstate parameter and deceleration parameter which describe the phase transition\nof the universe. We observe that the model explains the early time inflation\nand late time acceleration including matter-dominated phase. It is also\nobserved that the equation of state parameter may cross phantom divide line in\nlate time evolution. The cosmic coincidence problem is also discussed for both\nthe models. We observe that this logarithmic form of Brans-Dicke scalar field\nis more appropriate to achieve a less acute coincidence problem in\nnon-interacting model whereas a soft coincidence can be achieved if coupling\nparameter in interacting model has small value.\n", "  One of the interesting fundamental phenomenon which was observed in the last\ndecades is the discovery of anyons, relativistic spinning particles in $2+1$\ndimensions. In contrast to three-dimensional space, indistinguishable quantum\nparticles in two-dimensional space can, in general, have anomalous statistics\n[1-4]. These quasiparticles carry not only a charge $q$ also the magnetic flux\n$\\Phi_0$.\n", "  Knowing a biomolecule's structure is inherently linked to and a prerequisite\nfor any detailed understanding of its function. Significant effort has gone\ninto developing technologies for structural characterization. These\ntechnologies do not directly provide 3D structures; instead they typically\nyield noisy and erroneous distance information between specific entities such\nas atoms or residues, which have to be translated into consistent 3D models.\n  Here we present an approach for this translation process based on\nmaxent-stress optimization. Our new approach extends the original graph drawing\nmethod for the new application's specifics by introducing additional\nconstraints and confidence values as well as algorithmic components. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach infers structural models (i. e.,\nsensible 3D coordinates for the molecule's atoms) that correspond well to the\ndistance information, can handle noisy and error-prone data, and is\nconsiderably faster than established tools. Our results promise to allow domain\nscientists nearly-interactive structural modeling based on distance\nconstraints.\n", "  We suggest a new formula, which allows the Schwarzschild's solution and the\nEinstein radius to be applied to the dynamic universe, when our universe is\nhypothetically regarded as a single dynamic black hole. In this study, a\ncosmological constant problem is solved in the simplest manner, while we find\nexcellent agreements with observation. We adopt a model, wherein k = 0, lambda\nis not equal to 0, and omega = 1 to interlock lambda with critical density of\nthe black hole of our universe rho cBH, thereby presenting complimentary\nrelation between lambda and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S BH.\n", "  It is possible that self-induced oscillations appear in reactors, and that\ntheir range does not reach the steady state, although such state exists. To\nprove this, a cascade of tank reactors coupled with mass recycle loop was\ntested numerically. The above-mentioned phenomenon is characterized by the\nlocation of the steady point out of the limit cycle in the phase portrait. This\nincident may be beneficial to the process, as low steady state does not have to\nexclude an independent increase of the conversion degree, despite being the\nonly state and not generating oscillations.\n", "  How did the Sun affect the air pollution on the Earth? There are few papers\nabout this question. This work investigates the relationship between the air\npollution and solar activity by using the geophysical and environmental data\nduring the period of 2000-2016. It is quite certain that the solar activity may\nimpact on the air pollution, but the relationship is very weak and indirect.\nThe Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, Kendalls rank correlation,\nand conditional probability were adopted to analyze the air pollution index\n(API), air quality index (AQI), sunspot number (SSN), radio flux at wavelength\nof 10.7 cm (F10.7), and total solar irradiance (TSI). The analysis implies that\nthe correlation coefficient between API and SSN is weak ($-0.17<r<0.32$) with\ncomplex variation. The main results are: (1) For cities with higher air\npollution, the probability of high API will be increased along with SSN, then\nreach to a maximum, and then decreased; (2) For cities with lower air\npollution, the API has lower correlation with SSN; (3) The relationship between\nAPI and F10.7, or API and TSI are also similar as API and SSN. The solar\nactivities take direct effect on TSI and the energetic particle flux, and\nindirect and long-term effect on lower atmosphere and weather near the Earth.\nAll of these factors contribute to the air pollution on the Earth.\n", "  The Greek aperitif Ouzo is not only famous for its specific anise-flavored\ntaste, but also for its ability to turn from a transparent miscible liquid to a\nmilky-white colored emulsion when water is added. Recently, it has been shown\nthat this so-called Ouzo effect, i.e. the spontaneous emulsification of oil\nmicrodroplets, can also be triggered by the preferential evaporation of ethanol\nin an evaporating sessile Ouzo drop, leading to an amazingly rich drying\nprocess with multiple phase transitions [H. Tan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.\nUSA 113(31) (2016) 8642]. Due to the enhanced evaporation near the contact\nline, the nucleation of oil droplets starts at the rim which results in an oil\nring encircling the drop. Furthermore, the oil droplets are advected through\nthe Ouzo drop by a fast solutal Marangoni flow. In this article, we investigate\nthe evaporation of mixture droplets in more detail, by successively increasing\nthe mixture complexity from pure water over a binary water-ethanol mixture to\nthe ternary Ouzo mixture (water, ethanol and anise oil). In particular,\naxisymmetric and full three-dimensional finite element method simulations have\nbeen performed on these droplets to discuss thermal effects and the complicated\nflow in the droplet driven by an interplay of preferential evaporation,\nevaporative cooling and solutal and thermal Marangoni flow. By using image\nanalysis techniques and micro-PIV measurements, we are able to compare the\nnumerically predicted volume evolutions and velocity fields with experimental\ndata. The Ouzo droplet is furthermore investigated by confocal microscopy. It\nis shown that the oil ring predominantly emerges due to coalescence.\n", "  We reflect on the information paradigm in quantum and gravitational physics\nand on how it may assist us in approaching quantum gravity. We begin by\narguing, using a reconstruction of its formalism, that quantum theory can be\nregarded as a universal framework governing an observer's acquisition of\ninformation from physical systems taken as information carriers. We continue by\nobserving that the structure of spacetime is encoded in the communication\nrelations among observers and more generally the information flow in spacetime.\nCombining these insights with an information-theoretic Machian view, we argue\nthat the quantum architecture of spacetime can operationally be viewed as a\nlocally finite network of degrees of freedom exchanging information. An\nadvantage -- and simultaneous limitation -- of an informational perspective is\nits quasi-universality, i.e. quasi-independence of the precise physical\nincarnation of the underlying degrees of freedom. This suggests to exploit\nthese informational insights to develop a largely microphysics independent\ntop-down approach to quantum gravity to complement extant bottom-up approaches\nby closing the scale gap between the unknown Planck scale physics and the\nfamiliar physics of quantum (field) theory and general relativity\nsystematically from two sides. While some ideas have been pronounced before in\nsimilar guise and others are speculative, the way they are strung together and\njustified is new and supports approaches attempting to derive emergent\nspacetime structures from correlations of quantum degrees of freedom.\n", "  The dynamical law obeyed by the one-dimensional physical systems in the scale\nrelativity approach is reduced to a Riccati nonlinear differential equation.\nApplied to the harmonic oscillator potential, we show that such an approach\npermits the calculation of the solutions of the scale relativity problem in\nterms of the well known solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the harmonic\noscillator.\n", "  Stabilized FeSe thin films in ambient pressure with tunable superconductivity\nwould be a promising candidate for superconducting electronic devices yet its\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) is below 10 K in bulk materials. By\ncarefully controlling the depositions on twelve kinds of substrates using\npulsed laser deposition technique, high quality single crystalline FeSe samples\nwere fabricated with full width of half maximum 0.515? in the rocking curve and\nclear four-fold symmetry in phi-scan from x-ray diractions. The films have a\nmaximum Tc 15 K on the CaF2 substrate and do not show obvious decay in the air\nfor more than half a year. Slightly tuning the stoichiometry of the FeSe\ntargets, the Tc becomes adjustable from 15 to < 2 K with quite narrow\ntransition widths less than 2 K, and shows a positive relation with the\nout-of-plane (c-axis) lattice parameter of the films. However, there is no\nclear relation between the Tc and the surface atomic distance of the\nsubstrates. By reducing the thickness of the films, the Tc decreases and fades\naway in samples of less than 10 nm, suggesting that the strain effect is not\nresponsible for the enhancement of Tc in our experiments.\n", "  The techniques of growing films with different parameters in single process\nmake it possible to build up a sample library promptly. In this work, with a\nprecisely controlled moving mask, we synthetized superconducting\nLa2-xCexCuO4+/-{\\delta} combinatorial films on one SrTiO3 substrate with the\ndoping levels from x = 0.1 to 0.19. The monotonicity in doping along the\ndesigned direction is verified by micro-region x-ray diffraction and electric\ntransport measurements. More importantly, by means of numerical simulation, the\nreal change of doping levels is in accordance with a linear gradient variation\nof doping levels in the La2-xCexCuO4+/-{\\delta} combinatorial films. Our\nresults indicate that it is promising to accurately investigate materials with\ncritical composition by combinatorial film technique.\n", "  A simple model of magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/doped semiconductor\nhybrid structure with Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) driven by an applied\npulse of the electric field is proposed. The electric current excited by the\napplied field is spin-polarized due to the SOI and therefore it induces the\nmagnetization rotation in the ferromagnetic layer via s-d exchange coupling.\nMagnetization dynamics dependence on the electric pulse shape and magnitude is\nanalyzed for realistic values of parameters. We show that it is similar to the\ndynamics of a damped nonlinear oscillator with the time-dependent frequency\nproportional to the square root of the applied electric field. The\nmagnetization switching properties of an elliptic magnetic element are examined\nas a function of the applied field magnitude and direction.\n", "  Several observations of astrophysical jets show evidence of a structure in\nthe direction perpendicular to the jet axis, leading to the development of\n\"spine & sheath\" models of jets. Most studies focus on a two-component jet\nconsisting of a highly relativistic inner jet and a slower - but still\nrelativistic - outer jet surrounded by an unmagnetized environment. These jets\nare believed to be susceptible to a relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor-type\ninstability, depending on the effective inertia ratio of the two components. We\nextend previous studies by taking into account the presence of a non-zero\ntoroidal magnetic field. Different values of magnetization are examined, to\ndetect possible differences in the evolution and stability of the jet. We find\nthat the toroidal field, above a certain level of magnetization $\\sigma$,\nroughly equal to 0.01, can stabilize the jet against the previously mentioned\ninstabilities and that there is a clear trend in the behaviour of the average\nLorentz factor and the effective radius of the jet when we continuously\nincrease the magnetization. The simulations are performed using the\nrelativistic MHD module from the open source, parallel, grid adaptive,\nMPI-AMRVAC code.\n", "  Percolation based graph matching algorithms rely on the availability of seed\nvertex pairs as side information to efficiently match users across networks.\nAlthough such algorithms work well in practice, there are other types of side\ninformation available which are potentially useful to an attacker. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of matching two correlated graphs when an\nattacker has access to side information, either in the form of community labels\nor an imperfect initial matching. In the former case, we propose a naive graph\nmatching algorithm by introducing the community degree vectors which harness\nthe information from community labels in an efficient manner. Furthermore, we\nanalyze a variant of the basic percolation algorithm proposed in literature for\ngraphs with community structure. In the latter case, we propose a novel\npercolation algorithm with two thresholds which uses an imperfect matching as\ninput to match correlated graphs.\n  We evaluate the proposed algorithms on synthetic as well as real world\ndatasets using various experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the\nimportance of communities as side information especially when the number of\nseeds is small and the networks are weakly correlated.\n", "  We investigate the spin-1/2 twisted three-leg antiferromagnetic quantum spin\ntube in the presence of the easy-plane anisotropy, using the numerical\ndiagonalization of finite-size clusters. And we observe cases of the existence\nand the absence of magnetization plateau at 1/3 height of saturation\nmagnetization when the anisotropy is tuned. The\nphenomenological-renormalization analysis indicates a quantum phase transition\nbetween the 1/3 magnetization plateau phase and the plateauless one. The phase\ndiagram is also presented.\n", "  Engineering shape and interactions of nanoscopic building blocks allows for\nthe assembly of rationally designed macroscopic three-dimensional (3D)\nmaterials with spatial accuracy inaccessible to top-down fabrication methods.\nOwing to its sequence-specific interaction, DNA is often used as selective\nbinder to connect metallic nanoparticles into highly ordered lattices.\nMoreover, 3D crystals assembled entirely from DNA have been proposed and\nimplemented with the declared goal to arrange guest molecules in predefined\nlattices. This requires design schemes that provide high rigidity and\nsufficiently large open guest space. We here present a DNA origami-based\ntensegrity triangle structure that assembles into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline\nlattice. We site-specifically place 10 nm and 20 nm gold particles within the\nlattice, demonstrating that our crystals are spacious enough to host e.g.\nribosome-sized macromolecules. We validate the accurate assembly of the DNA\norigami lattice itself as well as the precise incorporation of gold particles\nby electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Our\nresults show that it is possible to create DNA building blocks that assemble\ninto lattices with customized geometry. Site-specific hosting of nano objects\nin the transparent DNA lattice sets the stage for metamaterial and structural\nbiology applications.\n", "  A comparative analysis on the popular schemes for evaluating evolution\nequation in lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is presented in this paper. It\nincludes two classical characteristic-line schemes, Boesh-Karlin and He-Luo\nscheme, and a author-proposed scheme, Taylor-expansion scheme, originating from\nthe extension of He-Luo scheme. We detailly discuss the mathematical mechanism\nand the equilibrium distribution evolution behind them. By analyzing the\nconflict between prediction and derivation, we address the preconditions for\nthese schemes. At the end, we conclude their pros and cons and suggest scheme's\napplicable scene based on their derivation procedure and further development\ncapacity.\n", "  Dilute nitride bismide GaNBiAs is a potential semiconductor alloy for near-\nand mid-infrared applications, particularly in 1.55 $\\mu$m optical\ncommunication systems. Incorporating dilute amounts of Bismuth (Bi) into GaAs\nreduces the effective bandgap rapidly, while significantly increasing the\nspin-orbit-splitting energy. Additional incorporation of dilute amounts of\nNitrogen (N) helps to attain lattice matching with GaAs, while providing a\nroute for flexible bandgap tuning. Here we present a study of the electronic\nbandstructure and optical gain of the lattice matched\nGaN$_x$Bi$_y$As$_{1-x-y}$/GaAs quaternary alloy quantum well (QW) based on the\n16-band k$\\cdot$p model. We have taken into consideration the interactions\nbetween the N and Bi impurity states with the host material based on the band\nanticrossing (BAC) and valence band anticrossing (VBAC) model. The optical gain\ncalculation is based on the density matrix theory. We have considered different\nlattice matched GaNBiAs QW cases and studied their energy dispersion curves,\noptical gain spectrum, maximum optical gain and differential gain; and compared\ntheir performances based on these factors. The thickness and composition of\nthese QWs were varied in order to keep the emission peak fixed at 1.55 $\\mu$m.\nThe well thickness has an effect on the spectral width of the gain curves. On\nthe other hand, a variation in the injection carrier density has different\neffects on the maximum gain and differential gain of QWs of varying\nthicknesses. Among the cases studied, we found that the 6.3 nm thick\nGaN$_3$Bi$_{5.17}$As$_{91.83}$ lattice matched QW was most suited for 1.55\n$\\mu$m (0.8 eV) GaAs-based photonic applications.\n", "  We study $R^2$ corrections to the holographic Schwinger effect in an AdS\nblack hole background and a confining D3-brane background, respectively. The\npotential analysis for these backgrounds is presented. The critical values for\nthe electric field are obtained. It is shown that for both backgrounds\nincreasing the Gauss-Bonnet parameter the Schwinger effect is enhanced.\nMoreover, the results provide an estimate of how the Schwinger effect changes\nwith the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\\eta/s$, at strong\ncoupling.\n", "  A quantitative evaluation of the influence of sampling on the numerical\nfractal analysis of experimental profiles is of critical importance. Although\nthis aspect has been widely recognized, a systematic analysis of the sampling\ninfluence is still lacking. Here we present the results of a systematic\nanalysis of synthetic self-affine profiles in order to clarify the consequences\nof the application of a poor sampling (up to 1000 points) typical of Scanning\nProbe Microscopy for the characterization of real interfaces and surfaces. We\ninterprete our results in term of a deviation and a dispersion of the measured\nexponent with respect to the ``true'' one. Both the deviation and the\ndispersion have always been disregarded in the experimental literature, and\nthis can be very misleading if results obtained from poorly sampled images are\npresented. We provide reasonable arguments to assess the universality of these\neffects and we propose an empirical method to take them into account. We show\nthat it is possible to correct the deviation of the measured Hurst exponent\nfrom the 'true' one and give a reasonable estimate of the dispersion error. The\nlast estimate is particularly important in the experimental results since it is\nan intrinsic error that depends only on the number of sampling points and can\neasily overwhelm the statistical error. Finally, we test our empirical method\ncalculating the Hurst exponent for the well-known 1+1 dimensional directed\npercolation profiles, with a 512-point sampling.\n", "  Nanostructured carbon films produced by supersonic cluster beam deposition\nhave been studied by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra show the\nformation of a sp2 solid with a very large fraction of sp-coordinated carbyne\nspecies showing a long-term stability under ultra high vacuum. Distinct Raman\ncontribution from polyyne and cumulene species have been observed. The\nlong-term stability and the behavior of carbyne-rich films under different gas\nexposure have been characterized showing different evolution for different sp\nconfigurations. Our experiments confirm theoretical predictions and demonstrate\nthe possibility of easily producing a stable carbyne-rich pure carbon solid.\nThe stability of the sp2-sp network has important implications for astrophysics\nand for the production of novel carbon-based systems.\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a suitable tool to perform tribological\ncharacterization of materials down to the nanometer scale. An important aspect\nin nanofriction measurements of corrugated samples is the local tilt of the\nsurface, which affects the lateral force maps acquired with the AFM. This is\none of the most important problems of state-of-the-art nanotribology, making\ndifficult a reliable and quantitative characterization of real corrugated\nsurfaces. A correction of topographic spurious contributions to lateral force\nmaps is thus needed for corrugated samples. In this paper we present a general\napproach to the topographic correction of AFM lateral force maps and we apply\nit in the case of multi-asperity adhesive contact. We describe a complete\nprotocol for the quantitative characterization of the frictional properties of\ncorrugated systems in the presence of surface adhesion using the AFM.\n"]}
