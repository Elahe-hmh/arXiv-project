By making two key assumptions, we are\nable to show not only that instantaneous collapse of a wave function at a\ndistance is possible but also that it is an invariant quantity under Lorentz\ntransformation and compatible with relativity. In addition, we will be able to\ndetect in which situation a many-body entangled system exhibits the maximum\ncollapse speed among its entangled particles. Finally we suggest that every\nforce in nature acts via entanglement.\n", "  Axisymmetric, rigidly rotating polytropes are considered in the framework of\nboth the original Chandrasekhar (C33) approximation and a different version\n(extended C33 approximation). Special effort is devoted to two specific points,\nnamely (i) a contradiction between the binomial series evaluation and the\nvanishing density on the boundary, which affects the self-consistency of the\nabove mentioned approximations, and (ii) the continuity of selected parameters\nas a function of the polytropic index. Concerning (i), it is shown the\nEmdem-Chandrasekhar (EC) associated functions are defined at any internal point\neven if related EC associated equations hold only for a particular subvolume,\nin the framework of both the C33 and the extended C33 approximation. Concerning\n(ii), the continuity may safely be established, on the boundary of the domain,\nfor part of the parameters, while additional data are needed for the remaining\npart. Simple fitting curves, valid to a good extent for a wide range of\npolytropic index, involve exponential functions and, in a single case, two\nstraight lines joined by a parabolic segment. The expression of physical\nparameters in terms of the polytropic index can be used in building up\nsequences of configurations with changing density profile for assigned mass and\nangular momentum.\n", "  In the original (1961) Gilbert model of random geometric graphs, nodes are\nplaced according to a Poisson point process, and links formed between those\nwithin a fixed range. Motivated by wireless ad-hoc networks \"soft\" or\n\"probabilistic\" connection models have recently been introduced, involving a\n\"connection function\" H(r) that gives the probability that two nodes at\ndistance r are linked (directly connect). In many applications (not only\nwireless networks), it is desirable that the graph is connected, that is every\nnode is linked to every other node in a multihop fashion. Here, the connection\nprobability of a dense network in a convex domain in two or three dimensions is\nexpressed in terms of contributions from boundary components, for a very\ngeneral class of connection functions. It turns out that only a few quantities\nsuch as moments of the connection function appear. Good agreement is found with\nspecial cases from previous studies and with numerical simulations.\n", "  By a conformal string in Euclidean space is meant a closed critical curve\nwith non-constant conformal curvatures of the conformal arclength functional.\nWe prove that (1) the set of conformal classes of conformal strings is in 1-1\ncorrespondence with the rational points of the complex domain $\\{q\\in\n\\mathbb{C} \\,:\\, 1/2 < \\mathrm{Re}\\, q < 1/\\sqrt{2},\\,\\, \\mathrm{Im}\\, q >\n0,\\,\\, |q| < 1/\\sqrt{2}\\}$ and (2) any conformal class has a model conformal\nstring, called symmetrical configuration, which is determined by three\nphenomenological invariants: the order of its symmetry group and its linking\nnumbers with the two conformal circles representing the rotational axes of the\nsymmetry group. This amounts to the quantization of closed trajectories of the\ncontact dynamical system associated to the conformal arclength functional via\nGriffiths' formalism of the calculus of variations.\n", "  The strong-coupling of an excitonic transition with an electromagnetic mode\nresults in composite quasi-particles called exciton-polaritons, which have been\nshown to combine the best properties of their bare components in semiconductor\nmicrocavities. However, the physics and applications of polariton flows in\norganic materials and at room temperature are still unexplored because of the\npoor photon confinement in such structures. Here we demonstrate that polaritons\nformed by the hybridization of organic excitons with a Bloch Surface Wave are\nable to propagate for hundreds of microns showing remarkable third-order\nnonlinear interactions upon high injection density. These findings pave the way\nfor the studies of organic nonlinear light-matter fluxes and for a\ntechnological promising route of dissipation-less on-chip polariton devices\nworking at room temperature.\n", "  Nodes are randomly distributed within an annulus (and then a shell) to form a\npoint pattern of communication terminals which are linked stochastically\naccording to the Rayleigh fading of radio-frequency data signals. We then\npresent analytic formulas for the connection probability of these spatially\nembedded graphs, describing the connectivity behaviour as a dense-network limit\nis approached. This extends recent work modelling ad hoc networks in non-convex\ndomains.\n", "  By means of a mean-field model extended to include magnetovolumic effects we\nstudy the effect of external fields on the thermal response characterized\neither by the isothermal entropy change and/or the adiabatic temperature\nchange. The model includes two different situations induced by the\nmagnetovolumic coupling. (i) A first order para- ferromagnetic phase transition\nthat entails a volume change. (ii) An inversion of the effective exchange\ninteraction that promotes the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic phase at low\ntemperatures. In both cases, we study the magneto- and baro-caloric effects as\nwell as the corresponding cross caloric responses. By comparing the present\ntheoretical results with available experimental data for several materials we\nconclude that the present thermodynamical model reproduces the general trends\nassociated with the considered caloric and cross caloric responses.\n", "  This paper aims to determine the fault tolerant quantum filter and fault\ndetection equation for a class of open quantum systems coupled to a laser field\nthat is subject to stochastic faults. In order to analyze this class of open\nquantum systems, we propose a quantum-classical Bayesian inference method based\non the definition of a so-called quantum-classical conditional expectation. It\nis shown that the proposed Bayesian inference approach provides a convenient\ntool to simultaneously derive the fault tolerant quantum filter and the fault\ndetection equation for this class of open quantum systems. An example of\ntwo-level open quantum systems subject to Poisson-type faults is presented to\nillustrate the proposed method. These results have the potential to lead to a\nnew fault tolerant control theory for quantum systems.\n", "  A linear [Fe/H]-[O/H] relation is found for different stellar populations in\nthe Galaxy (halo, thick disk, thin disk) from a data sample obtained in a\nrecent investigation (Ram{\\'\\i}rez et al. 2013). These correlations support\nprevious results inferred from poorer samples: stars display a \"main sequence\"\nexpressed as [Fe/H] = $a$[O/H$]+b\\mp\\Delta b$ where a unit slope, $a=1$,\nimplies a constant [O/Fe] abundance ratio. Oxygen and iron empirical abundance\ndistributions are then determined for different subsamples, which are well\nexplained by the theoretical predictions of multistage closed-(box+reservoir)\n(MCBR) chemical evolution models by taking into account the found correlations.\nThe interpretation of these distributions in the framework of MCBR models gives\nus clues about inflow/outflow rates in these different Galactic regions and\ntheir corresponding evolution. Outflow rate for the thick and the thin disks\nare lower than the halo outflow rate. Moreover if the thin disk built up from\nthe thick disk, both systems result of comparable masses. Besides that, the\niron-to-oxygen yield ratio and the primary to not primary contribution ratio\nfor the iron production are obtained from the data, resulting consistent with\nSNII progenitor nucleosynthesis and with the iron production from SNIa\nsupernova events.\n", "  We consider field theories that exhibit a supersymmetric Lifshitz scaling\nwith two real supercharges. The theories can be formulated in the language of\nstochastic quantization. We construct the free field supersymmetry algebra with\nrotation singlet fermions for an even dynamical exponent $z=2k$ in an arbitrary\ndimension. We analyze the classical and quantum $z=2$ supersymmetric\ninteractions in $2+1$ and $3+1$ spacetime dimensions and reveal a supersymmetry\npreserving quantum diagrammatic cancellation. Stochastic quantization indicates\nthat Lifshitz scale invariance is broken in the $(3+1)$-dimensional quantum\ntheory.\n", "  We build a model of information cascades on feed-based networks, taking into\naccount the finite attention span of users, message generation rates and\nmessage forwarding rates. Using this model, we study through simulations, the\neffect of the extent of user attention on the probability that the cascade\nbecomes viral. In analogy with a branching process, we estimate the branching\nfactor associated with the cascade process for different attention spans and\ndifferent forwarding probabilities, and demonstrate that beyond a certain\nattention span, critical forwarding probabilities exist that constitute a\nthreshold after which cascades can become viral. The critical forwarding\nprobabilities have an inverse relationship with the attention span. Next, we\ndevelop a semi-analytical approach for our model, that allows us determine the\nbranching factor for given values of message generation rates, message\nforwarding rates and attention spans. The branching factors obtained using this\nanalytical approach show good agreement with those obtained through\nsimulations. Finally, we analyze an event specific dataset obtained from\nTwitter, and show that estimated branching factors correlate well with the\ncascade size distributions associated with distinct hashtags.\n", "  We propose using radio line spectroscopy to detect molecular absorption lines\n(such as OH at 1.6-1.7 GHz) before and after the total eclipse of black widow\n(BW) and other short orbital period binary pulsars with low mass companions.\nThe companion in such a binary may be ablated away by energetic particles and\nhigh energy radiation produced by the pulsar wind. The observations will probe\nthe eclipsing wind being ablated by the pulsar and constrain the nature of the\ncompanion and its surroundings. Maser emission from the interstellar medium\nstimulated by a pulsar beam might also be detected from the intrabinary medium.\nThe short temporal resolution allowed by the millisecond pulsars can probe this\nmedium with the high angular resolution of the pulsar beam.\n", "  Pure power-law density profiles, $\\rho(r)\\propto r^{b-3}$, are classified in\nconnection with the following reference cases: (i) isodensity, $b=3$, $\\rho=$\nconst; (ii) isogravity, $b=2$, $g=$ const; (iii) isothermal, $b=1$,\n$v=[GM(r)/r]^{1/2}=$ const; (iv) isomass, $b=0$, $M=$ const. A restricted\nnumber of different families of density profiles including, in addition, cored\npower-law, generalized power-law, polytropes, are studied in detail with regard\nto both one-component and two-component systems. Considerable effort is devoted\nto the existence of an extremum point (maximum absolute value) in the\ngravitational acceleration within the matter distribution. Predicted velocity\ncurves are compared to the data inferred from observations. Tidal effects on an\ninner subsystem are investigated and an application is made to globular\nclusters within the Galaxy. To this aim, the tidal radius is defined by\nbalancing the opposite gravitational forces from the Galaxy and the selected\ncluster on a special point of the cluster boundary, lying between related\ncentres of mass. The position of 17 globular clusters with respect to the\nstability region, where the tidal radius exceeds the observed radius, is shown\nfor assigned dark-to-visible mass ratios and density profiles, among those\nconsidered, which are currently used for the description of galaxies and/or\ndark matter haloes.\n", "  We use the method of characteristics to study superluminal graviton (thereof\ncalled swift graviton) propagation in theories of higher curvature gravity of\nthe form $($Riemann$)^2$, $($Riemann$)^3$, $\\nabla^2 ($Riemann$)^2$ and\n$($Riemann$)^4$. We consider a pp-wave background. When probed by gravitons\nwith an appropriate polarisation, several of the gravitational theories under\nconsideration exhibit characteristic hypersurfaces outside the flat spacetime\nlight-cone.\n", "  We extend the cohomological analysis in arXiv:1410.5831 of anisotropic\nLifshitz scale anomalies. We consider non-relativistic theories with a\ndynamical critical exponent $z=2$ with or without non-relativistic boosts and a\nparticle number symmetry. We distinguish between cases depending on whether the\ntime direction does or does not induce a foliation structure. We analyse both\n$1+1$ and $2+1$ spacetime dimensions. In $1+1$ dimensions we find no scale\nanomalies with Galilean boost symmetries. The anomalies in $2+1$ dimensions\nwith Galilean boosts and a foliation structure are all B-type and are identical\nto the Lifshitz case in the purely spatial sector. With Galilean boosts and\nwithout a foliation structure we find also an A-type scale anomaly. There is an\ninfinite ladder of B-type anomalies in the absence of a foliation structure\nwith or without Galilean boosts. We discuss the relation between the existence\nof a foliation structure and the causality of the field theory.\n", "  We introduce a natural notion of incompressibility for fluids governed by the\nrelativistic Euler equations on a fixed background spacetime, and show that the\nresulting equations reduce to the incompressible Euler equations in the\nclassical limit as $c\\rightarrow \\infty$. As our main result, we prove that the\nfluid pressure of solutions of these incompressible \"relativistic\" Euler\nequations satisfies an elliptic equation on each of the hypersurfaces\northogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which indicates infinite speed of\npropagation.\n", "  Assortativity was first introduced by Newman and has been extensively studied\nand applied to many real world networked systems since then. Assortativity is a\ngraph metrics and describes the tendency of high degree nodes to be directly\nconnected to high degree nodes and low degree nodes to low degree nodes. It can\nbe interpreted as a first order measure of the connection between nodes, i.e.\nthe first autocorrelation of the degree-degree vector. Even though\nassortativity has been used so extensively, to the author's knowledge, no\nattempt has been made to extend it theoretically. This is the scope of our\npaper. We will introduce higher order assortativity by extending the Newman\nindex based on a suitable choice of the matrix driving the connections. Higher\norder assortativity will be defined for paths, shortest paths, random walks of\na given time length, connecting any couple of nodes. The Newman assortativity\nis achieved for each of these measures when the matrix is the adjacency matrix,\nor, in other words, the correlation is of order 1. Our higher order\nassortativity indexes can be used for describing a variety of real networks,\nhelp discriminating networks having the same Newman index and may reveal new\ntopological network features.\n", "  Undirected graphical models are applied in genomics, protein structure\nprediction, and neuroscience to identify sparse interactions that underlie\ndiscrete data. Although Bayesian methods for inference would be favorable in\nthese contexts, they are rarely used because they require doubly intractable\nMonte Carlo sampling. Here, we develop a framework for scalable Bayesian\ninference of discrete undirected models based on two new methods. The first is\nPersistent VI, an algorithm for variational inference of discrete undirected\nmodels that avoids doubly intractable MCMC and approximations of the partition\nfunction. The second is Fadeout, a reparameterization approach for variational\ninference under sparsity-inducing priors that captures a posteriori\ncorrelations between parameters and hyperparameters with noncentered\nparameterizations. We find that, together, these methods for variational\ninference substantially improve learning of sparse undirected graphical models\nin simulated and real problems from physics and biology.\n", "  We study the conformal geometry of timelike curves in the (1+2)-Einstein\nuniverse, the conformal compactification of Minkowski 3-space defined as the\nquotient of the null cone of $\\mathbb{R}^{2,3}$ by the action by positive\nscalar multiplications. The purpose is to describe local and global conformal\ninvariants of timelike curves and to address the question of existence and\nproperties of closed trajectories for the conformal strain functional. Some\nrelations between the conformal geometry of timelike curves and the geometry of\nknots and links in the 3-sphere are discussed.\n", "  Repeated observations inhibit the coherent evolution of quantum states\nthrough the quantum Zeno effect. In multi-qubit systems this effect provides\nnew opportunities to control complex quantum states. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate that repeatedly projecting joint observables of multiple spins\ncreates coherent quantum Zeno subspaces and simultaneously suppresses dephasing\ncaused by the environment. We encode up to two logical qubits in these\nsubspaces and show that the enhancement of the dephasing time with increasing\nnumber of projections follows a scaling law that is independent of the number\nof spins involved. These results provide new insights into the interplay\nbetween frequent multi-spin measurements and non-Markovian noise and pave the\nway for tailoring the dynamics of multi-qubit systems through repeated\nprojections.\n", "  We have examined the local 3d electronic structures of Co-Au multinuclear\ncomplexes with the medicinal molecules D-penicillaminate (D-pen)\n[Co{Au(PPh3)(D-pen)}2]ClO4 and [Co3{Au3(tdme)(D-pen)3}2] by Co L_2,3-edge soft\nX-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy, where PPh3 denotes triphenylphosphine and\ntdme stands for 1,1,1-tris[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]ethane. The Co L_2,3-edge\nXAS spectra indicate the localized ionic 3d electronic states in both\nmaterials. The experimental spectra are well explained by spectral simulation\nfor a localized Co ion under ligand fields with the full multiplet theory,\nwhich verifies that the ions are in the low-spin Co3+ state in the former\ncompound and in the high-spin Co2+ state in the latter.\n", "  Quantum state tomography, an important task in quantum information\nprocessing, aims at reconstructing a state from prepared measurement data.\nBayesian methods are recognized to be one of the good and reliable choice in\nestimating quantum states~\\cite{blume2010optimal}. Several numerical works\nshowed that Bayesian estimations are comparable to, and even better than other\nmethods in the problem of $1$-qubit state recovery. However, the problem of\nchoosing prior distribution in the general case of $n$ qubits is not\nstraightforward. More importantly, the statistical performance of Bayesian type\nestimators have not been studied from a theoretical perspective yet. In this\npaper, we propose a novel prior for quantum states (density matrices), and we\ndefine pseudo-Bayesian estimators of the density matrix. Then, using\nPAC-Bayesian theorems, we derive rates of convergence for the posterior mean.\nThe numerical performance of these estimators are tested on simulated and real\ndatasets.\n", "  We derive the quasiclassical non-equilibrium Eilenberger and Usadel equations\nto first order in quantities small compared to the Fermi energy, valid for\nDirac edge and surface electrons with spin-momentum locking, as relevant for\ntopological insulators. We discuss in detail several of the key technical\npoints and assumptions of the derivation, and provide a Riccati-parametrization\nof the equations. Solving first the equilibrium equations for S/N and S/F\nbilayers and Josephson junctions, we study the superconducting proximity effect\nin Dirac materials. Similarly to related works, we find that the effect of an\nexchange field depends strongly on the direction of the field. Only components\nnormal to the transport direction lead to attenuation of the Cooper pair\nwavefunction inside the F. Fields parallel to the transport direction lead to\nphase-shifts in the dependence on the superconducting phase difference for both\nthe charge current and density of states in an S/F/S-junction. Moreover, we\ncompute the differential conductance in S/N and S/F bilayers with an applied\nvoltage bias, and determine the dependence on the length of the N and F regions\nand the exchange field.\n", "  We discuss the host galaxy metallicity distribution of all long gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) whose redshifts are known to be $< 0.4$, including newly obtained\nspectroscopic datasets of the host galaxies of GRB 060614, 090417B, and\n130427A. We compare the metallicity distribution of the low-redshift sample to\nthe model predictions, and constrain the relation between metallicity and GRB\noccurrence. We take account of spatial variation of metallicities among star\nforming regions within a galaxy. We found that the models, in which only\nlow-metallicity stars produce GRBs with a sharp cutoff of GRB production\nefficiency around 12+log(O/H) $\\sim$ 8.3, can well reproduce the observed\ndistribution, while the models with no metallicity dependence are not\nconsistent with the observations. We also discuss possible sampling biases we\nmay suffer by collecting long GRBs whose redshifts are known, presenting the\nphotometric observations of the host galaxy of GRB 111225A at $z = 0.297$ whose\nredshift has been undetermined until $\\sim$ 2.3 years after the burst.\n", "  The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy relies on establishing trust in distributed\nnetworked systems, where the reliability of a user is assessed through digital\npeer-review processes that aggregate ratings into reputation scores. Here we\npresent evidence of a network effect which biases digital reputation, revealing\nthat P2P networks display exceedingly high levels of reciprocity. In fact,\nthese are much higher than those compatible with a null assumption that\npreserves the empirically observed level of agreement between all pairs of\nnodes, and rather close to the highest levels structurally compatible with the\nnetworks' reputation landscape. This indicates that the crowdsourcing process\nunderpinning digital reputation can be significantly distorted by the attempt\nof users to mutually boost reputation, or to retaliate, through the exchange of\nratings. We uncover that the least active users are predominantly responsible\nfor such reciprocity-induced bias, and that this fact can be exploited to\nobtain more reliable reputation estimates. Our findings are robust across\ndifferent P2P platforms, including both cases where ratings are used to vote on\nthe content produced by users and to vote on user profiles.\n", "  Optically active point defects in crystals have gained widespread attention\nas photonic systems that can find use in quantum information technologies.\nHowever challenges remain in the placing of individual defects at desired\nlocations, an essential element of device fabrication. Here we report the\ncontrolled generation of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond using\nlaser writing. The use of aberration correction in the writing optics allows\nprecise positioning of vacancies within the diamond crystal, and subsequent\nannealing produces single NV centres with up to 45% success probability, within\nabout 200 nm of the desired position. Selected NV centres fabricated by this\nmethod display stable, coherent optical transitions at cryogenic temperatures,\na pre-requisite for the creation of distributed quantum networks of solid-state\nqubits. The results illustrate the potential of laser writing as a new tool for\ndefect engineering in quantum technologies.\n", "  Short-pulse fibre lasers are a complex dynamical system possessing a broad\nspace of operating states that can be accessed through control of cavity\nparameters. Determination of target regimes is a multi-parameter global\noptimisation problem. Here, we report the implementation of a genetic algorithm\nto intelligently locate optimum parameters for stable single-pulse mode-locking\nin a Figure-8 fibre laser, and fully automate the system turn-on procedure.\nStable ultrashort pulses are repeatably achieved by employing a compound\nfitness function that monitors both temporal and spectral output properties of\nthe laser. Our method of encoding photonics expertise into an algorithm and\napplying machine-learning principles paves the way to self-optimising `smart'\noptical technologies.\n", "  Defect induced magnetism is reported in undoped aluminium nitride thin films\ndeposited using reactive ion beam sputtering of aluminium in nitrogen plasma.\nThe films have been deposited on silicon substrate at different temperatures.\nExistence of the defects in the films have been verified using room temperature\nphoto-luminescence measurements. Owing to nano crystalline nature of the films,\nsuper-magnetic ground states have been observed. A cross-over from super\nparamagnetic to super spin glass state has been observed as the grain density\nincreases. Detailed magnetisation measurements along with AC susceptibility\nmeasurements have been used to determine the ground states in these AlN thin\nfilms.\n", "  We study mechanical cooling in systems of coupled passive (lossy) and active\n(with gain) optical resonators. We find that for a driving laser which is\nred-detuned with respect to the cavity frequency, the supermode structure of\nthe system is radically changed, featuring the emergence of genuine high-order\nexceptional points. This in turn leads to giant enhancement of both the\nmechanical damping and the spring stiffness, facilitating low-power mechanical\ncooling in the vicinity of gain-loss balance. This opens up new avenues of\nsteering micromechanical devices with exceptional points beyond the\nlowest-order two.\n", "  We measure carbon and nitrogen abundances to $\\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for 450,000\ngiant stars from their low-resolution (R$\\sim$1800) LAMOST DR2 survey spectra.\nWe use these [C/M] and [N/M] measurements, together with empirical relations\nbased on the APOKASC sample, to infer stellar masses and implied ages for\n230,000 of these objects to 0.08 dex and 0.2 dex respectively. We use The\nCannon, a data-driven approach to spectral modeling, to construct a predictive\nmodel for LAMOST spectra. Our reference set comprises 8125 stars observed in\ncommon between the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys, taking seven APOGEE DR12 labels\n(parameters) as ground truth: Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\\alpha$/M], [C/M], [N/M],\nand Ak. We add seven colors to the Cannon model, based on the g, r, i, J, H, K,\nW1, and W2 magnitudes from APASS, 2MASS & WISE, which improves our constraints\non Teff and logg by up to 20% and on Ak by up to 70%. Cross-validation of the\nmodel demonstrates that, for high-SNR objects, our inferred labels agree with\nthe APOGEE values to within 50 K in temperature, 0.04 magnitudes in Ak, and <\n0.1 dex in logg, [M/H], [C/M], [N/M], and [$\\alpha$/M]. We apply the model to\n450,000 giants in LAMOST DR2 that have not been observed by APOGEE. This\ndemonstrates that precise individual abundances can be measured from\nlow-resolution spectra, and represents the largest catalog of [C/M], [N/M],\nmasses and ages to date. As as result, we greatly increase the number and sky\ncoverage of stars with mass and age estimates.\n", "  We investigate observable cosmological aspects of sterile neutrino dark\nmatter produced via the freeze-in mechanism. The study is performed in a\nframework that admits many cosmologically interesting variations: high\ntemperature production via annihilation processes from higher dimensional\noperators or low temperature production from decays of a scalar, with the\ndecaying scalar in or out of equilibrium with the thermal bath, in\nsupersymmetric or non-supersymmetric setups, thus allowing us to both extract\ngeneric properties and highlight features unique to particular variations. We\nfind that while such sterile neutrinos are generally compatible with all\ncosmological constraints, interesting scenarios can arise where dark matter is\ncold, warm, or hot, has nontrivial momentum distributions, or provides\ncontributions to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom Neff\nduring Big Bang nucleosynthesis large enough to be probed by future\nmeasurements.\n", "  The clustering of dark matter haloes with fixed mass depends on their\nformation history, an effect known as assembly bias. We use zoom N -body\nsimulations to investigate the origin of this phenomenon. For each halo at\nredshift z=0, we determine the time in which the physical volume containing its\nfinal mass becomes stable. We consider five examples for which this happens at\nz~1.5 and two that do not stabilize by z=0. The zoom simulations show that\nearly-collapsing haloes do not grow in mass at z=0 while late-forming ones show\na net inflow. The reason is that 'accreting' haloes are located at the nodes of\na network of thin filaments feeding them. Conversely, each 'stalled' halo lies\nwithin a prominent filament that is thicker than the halo size. Infalling\nmaterial from the surroundings becomes part of the filament while matter within\nit recedes from the halo. We conclude that assembly bias originates from\nquenching halo growth due to tidal forces following the formation of non-linear\nstructures in the cosmic web, as previously conjectured in the literature. Also\nthe internal dynamics of the haloes change: the velocity anisotropy profile is\nbiased towards radial (tangential) orbits in accreting (stalled) haloes. Our\nfindings reveal the cause of the yet unexplained dependence of halo clustering\non the anisotropy. Finally, we extend the excursion-set theory to account for\nthese effects. A simple criterion based on the ellipticity of the linear tidal\nfield combined with the spherical collapse model provides excellent predictions\nfor both classes of haloes.\n", "  Topological insulators are fascinating states of matter exhibiting protected\nedge states and robust quantized features in their bulk. Here, we propose and\nvalidate experimentally a method to detect topological properties in the bulk\nof one-dimensional chiral systems. We first introduce the mean chiral\ndisplacement, and we show that it rapidly approaches a multiple of the Zak\nphase in the long time limit. Then we measure the Zak phase in a photonic\nquantum walk, by direct observation of the mean chiral displacement in its\nbulk. Next, we measure the Zak phase in an alternative, inequivalent timeframe,\nand combine the two windings to characterize the full phase diagram of this\nFloquet system. Finally, we prove the robustness of the measure by introducing\ndynamical disorder in the system. This detection method is extremely general,\nas it can be applied to all one-dimensional platforms simulating static or\nFloquet chiral systems.\n", "  At ambient pressure, BiTeI is the first material found to exhibit a giant\nRashba splitting of the bulk electronic bands. At low pressures, BiTeI\nundergoes a transition from trivial insulator to topological insulator. At\nstill higher pressures, two structural transitions are known to occur. We have\ncarried out a series of electrical resistivity and AC magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements on BiTeI at pressure up to ~40 GPa in an effort to characterize\nthe properties of the high-pressure phases. A previous calculation found that\nthe high-pressure orthorhombic P4/nmm structure BiTeI is a metal. We find that\nthis structure is superconducting with Tc values as high as 6 K. AC magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements support the bulk nature of the superconductivity.\nUsing electronic structure and phonon calculations, we compute Tc and find that\nour data is consistent with phonon-mediated superconductivity.\n", "  It was recently conjectured that the quantum complexity of a holographic\nboundary state can be computed by evaluating the gravitational action on a bulk\nregion known as the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. We apply this complexity=action\nduality to evaluate the `complexity of formation' (arXiv:1509.07876,\narXiv:1512.04993), i.e., the additional complexity arising in preparing the\nentangled thermofield double state with two copies of the boundary CFT compared\nto preparing the individual vacuum states of the two copies. We find that for\nboundary dimensions $d>2$, the difference in the complexities grows linearly\nwith the thermal entropy at high temperatures. For the special case $d=2$, the\ncomplexity of formation is a fixed constant, independent of the temperature. We\ncompare these results to those found using the complexity=volume duality.\n", "  Area laws were first discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking, who found that the\nentropy of a black hole grows proportional to its surface area, and not its\nvolume. Entropy area laws have since become a fundamental part of modern\nphysics, from the holographic principle in quantum gravity to ground state\nwavefunctions of quantum matter, where entanglement entropy is generically\nfound to obey area law scaling. As no experiments are currently capable of\ndirectly probing the entanglement area law in naturally occurring many-body\nsystems, evidence of its existence is based on studies of simplified theories.\nUsing new exact microscopic numerical simulations of superfluid $^4$He, we\ndemonstrate for the first time an area law scaling of entanglement entropy in a\nreal quantum liquid in three dimensions. We validate the fundamental principles\nunderlying its physical origin, and present an \"entanglement equation of state\"\nshowing how it depends on the density of the superfluid.\n", "  Untagged gamma-ray and tagged-neutron yields from 241AmBe and 238PuBe\nmixed-field sources have been measured. Gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements\nfrom 1 - 5 MeV were performed in an open environment using a CeBr3 detector and\nthe same experimental conditions for both sources. The shapes of the\ndistributions are very similar and agree well with previous data.\nTagged-neutron measurements from 2 - 6 MeV were performed in a shielded\nenvironment using a NE-213 liquid-scintillator detector for the neutrons and a\nYAP(Ce) detector to tag the 4.44 MeV gamma-rays associated with the\nde-excitation of the first excited state of 12C. Again, the same experimental\nconditions were used for both sources. The shapes of these distributions are\nalso very similar and agree well with previous data, each other, and the ISO\nrecommendation. Our 238PuBe source provides approximately 2.6 times more 4.44\nMeV gamma-rays and 2.4 times more neutrons over the tagged-neutron energy\nrange, the latter in reasonable agreement with the original full-spectrum\nsource-calibration measurements performed at the time of their acquisition.\n", "  Radiation therapy with protons as of today utilizes information from x-ray CT\nin order to estimate the proton stopping power of the traversed tissue in a\npatient. The conversion from x-ray attenuation to proton stopping power in\ntissue introduces range uncertainties of the order of 2-3% of the range,\nuncertainties that are contributing to an increase of the necessary planning\nmargins added to the target volume in a patient. Imaging methods and\nmodalities, such as Dual Energy CT and proton CT, have come into consideration\nin the pursuit of obtaining an as good as possible estimate of the proton\nstopping power. In this study, a Digital Tracking Calorimeter is benchmarked\nfor proof-of-concept for proton CT purposes. The Digital Tracking Calorimeteris\napplied for reconstruction of the tracks and energies of individual high energy\nprotons. The presented prototype forms the basis for a proton CT system using a\nsingle technology for tracking and calorimetry. This advantage simplifies the\nsetup and reduces the cost of a proton CT system assembly, and it is a unique\nfeature of the Digital Tracking Calorimeter. Data from the AGORFIRM beamline at\nKVI-CART in Groningen in the Netherlands and Monte Carlo simulation results are\nused to in order to develop a tracking algorithm for the estimation of the\nresidual ranges of a high number of concurrent proton tracks. The range of the\nindividual protons can at present be estimated with a resolution of 4%. The\nreadout system for this prototype is able to handle an effective proton\nfrequency of 1 MHz by using 500 concurrent proton tracks in each readout frame,\nwhich is at the high end range of present similar prototypes. A future further\noptimized prototype will enable a high-speed and more accurate determination of\nthe ranges of individual protons in a therapeutic beam.\n", "  An ambipolar $n$-$p$ double quantum dot defined by potential variation along\na semiconducting carbon-nanotube is considered. We focus on the (1e,1h) charge\nconfiguration with a single excess electron in the conduction band state\nconfined in the $n$-type dot and a single missing electron in the valence band\nstate of the $p$-dot for which lifting of the Pauli blockade of the current was\nobserved in the electric-dipole spin resonance [E. A. Laird et al. Nat.\nNanotech. 8 , 565 (2013)]. The dynamics of the system driven by periodic\nelectric field is studied with the Floquet theory and the time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction method with the single-electron spin-valley-orbitals\ndetermined for atomistic tight-binding Hamiltonian. We find that the\ntransitions lifting the Pauli blockade are strongly influenced by coupling to a\nvacuum state with an empty $n$ dot and a fully filled $p$ dot. The coupling\nshifts the transition energies and strongly modifies the effective $g$ factors\nfor axial magnetic field. The coupling is modulated by the bias between the\ndots but it appears effective for surprisingly large energy splitting between\nthe (1e,1h) ground state and the vacuum (0e,0h) state. Multiphoton transitions\nand high harmonic generation effects are also discussed.\n", "  In this paper we present a regular black hole with a positive cosmological\nconstant. The regular black hole considered is the well known Bardeen black\nhole and it is a solution to the Einstein equations coupled to non-linear\nelectrodynamics with a magnetic monopole. The paper discuss the properties of\nthe Bardeen-de Sitter black hole. We have computed the grey body factors and\npartial absorption cross sections for massless scalar field impinges on this\nblack hole with the third order WKB approximation. A detailed discussion on how\nthe behavior of the grey body factors depend on the parameters of the theory\nsuch as the mass, charge and the cosmological constant is given. Possible\nextensions of the work is discussed at the end of the paper.\n", "  We give a topological simulation for tensor networks that we call the\ntwo-string model. In this approach we give a new way to design protocols, and\nwe discover a new multipartite quantum communication protocol. We introduce the\nnotion of topologically-compressed transformations. Our new protocol can\nimplement multiple, non-local compressed transformations among multi-parties\nusing one multipartite resource state.\n", "  As established by Sol\\`er, Quantum Theories may be formulated in real,\ncomplex or quaternionic Hilbert spaces only. St\\\"uckelberg provided physical\nreasons for ruling out real Hilbert spaces relying on Heisenberg principle.\nFocusing on this issue from another viewpoint, we argue that there is a\nfundamental reason why elementary quantum systems are not described in real\nHilbert spaces: their symmetry group. We consider an elementary relativistic\nsystem within Wigner's approach defined as a locally-faithful irreducible\ncontinuous unitary representation of the Poincar\\'e group in a real Hilbert\nspace. We prove that, if the squared-mass operator is non-negative, the system\nadmits a natural, Poincar\\'e invariant and unique up to sign, complex structure\nwhich commutes with the whole algebra of observables generated by the\nrepresentation. All that leads to a physically equivalent formulation in a\ncomplex Hilbert space. Differently from what happens in the real picture, here\nall selfadjoint operators are observables in accordance with Sol\\`er's thesis,\nand the standard quantum version of Noether theorem holds. We next focus on the\nphysical hypotheses adopted to define a quantum elementary relativistic system\nrelaxing them and making our model physically more general. We use a physically\nmore accurate notion of irreducibility regarding the algebra of observables\nonly, we describe the symmetries in terms of automorphisms of the restricted\nlattice of elementary propositions and we adopt a notion of continuity referred\nto the states. Also in this case, the final result proves that there exist a\nunique (up to sign) Poincar\\'e invariant complex structure making the theory\ncomplex and completely fitting into Sol\\`er's picture. This complex structure\nreveals a nice interplay of Poincar\\'e symmetry and the classification of the\ncommutant of irreducible real von Neumann algebras.\n", "  In this letter, we extend the tree-level Kawai--Lewellen--Tye (KLT) and\nBern--Carrasco--Johansson (BCJ) amplitude relations to loop integrands of gauge\ntheory and gravity. By rearranging the propagators of gauge and gravity loop\nintegrands, we propose the first manifestly gauge- and diffeomorphism invariant\nformulation of their double-copy relations. The one-loop KLT formula expresses\ngravity integrands in terms of more basic gauge invariant building blocks for\ngauge-theory amplitudes, dubbed partial integrands. The latter obey a one-loop\nanalogue of the BCJ relations, and both KLT and BCJ relations are universal to\nbosons and fermions in any number of spacetime dimensions and independent on\nthe amount of supersymmetry. Also, one-loop integrands of Einstein--Yang--Mills\n(EYM) theory are related to partial integrands of pure gauge theories.\n", "  Recently, Di\\'osi et al. (Int. J. Quant. Inf. 4, 99 (2006)) introduced a\nsimple, yet very interesting model for reservoirs, in order to study the\nrelationship between thermodynamic entropy production of a system and the\ncorresponding von Neumann entropy (or informatic entropy, as it was called by\nthe authors). They came up with a conjecture about the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe state introduced in the model. The conjecture was proven later by Csisz\\'ar\net al. (J. Math. Phys. 48, 092102 (2007)). In this paper we give a different\ninterpretation of the original question and extend the result to a collection\nof more general states.\n", "  Metal-air batteries are among the most promising next-generation energy\nstorage devices. Relying on abundant materials and offering high energy\ndensities, potential applications lie in the fields of electro-mobility,\nportable electronics, and stationary grid applications. Now, research on\nsecondary zinc-air batteries is revived, which are commercialized as primary\nhearing aid batteries. One of the main obstacles for making zinc-air batteries\nrechargeable is their poor lifetime due to the degradation of alkaline\nelectrolyte in contact with atmospheric carbon dioxide. In this article, we\npresent a continuum theory of a commercial Varta PowerOne button cell. Our\nmodel contains dissolution of zinc and nucleation and growth of zinc oxide in\nthe anode, thermodynamically consistent electrolyte transport in porous media,\nand multi-phase coexistance in the gas diffusion electrode. We perform\nelectrochemical measurements and validate our model. Excellent agreement\nbetween theory and experiment is found and novel insights into the role of zinc\noxide nucleation and growth and carbon dioxide dissolution for discharge and\nlifetime is presented. We demonstrate the implications of our work for the\ndevelopment of rechargeable zinc-air batteries.\n", "  The Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts (DFR) framework for noncommutative (NC)\nspace-times is considered as an alternative approach to describe the physics of\nquantum gravity. In this formalism, the NC parameter, {\\it i.e.}\n$\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$, is promoted to a coordinate of a new extended space-time.\nConsequently, we can construct a Field Theory in a space-time with spatial\nextra-dimensions. This new coordinate has a canonical momentum associated,\nwhere the effects of a new physics point of view can emerge in the fields\npropagation along the extra-dimension. In this paper we have introduced the\ngauge invariance in the DFR NC space-time by the composite symmetry\n$U^{\\star}(N)\\times U^{\\star}(N)$. We have constructed the non-Abelian gauge\nsymmetry based on DFR formalism, and we analyzed the consequences of this\nsymmetry in the presence of such extra-dimensions. The gauge symmetry in this\nDFR scenario can reveal new gauge fields attached to $\\theta$-extra-dimension.\nAs an application, we have accomplished the unification of Strong Interaction\nwith the electromagnetism and a Higgs model to give masses to the NC bosons. We\nhave estimated their masses by using some experimental constraints of QCD.\n", "  In this work, we study many-body excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs) trapped in periodic one-dimensional optical lattices. In particular, we\ninvestigate the impact of quantum depletion onto the structure of the\nlow-energy spectrum and contrast the findings to the mean-field predictions of\nthe Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. Accurate results for the many-body\nexcited states are obtained by applying a linear-response theory atop the\nMCTDHB (multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons)\nequations of motion, termed LR-MCTDHB. We demonstrate for condensates in a\ntriple well that even weak ground-state depletion of around $1\\%$ leads to\nvisible many-body effects in the low-energy spectrum which deviate\nsubstantially from the corresponding BdG spectrum. We further show that these\neffects also appear in larger systems with more lattice sites and particles,\nindicating the general necessity of a full many-body treatment.\n", "  Gallium selenide (GaSe) is a 2D material with a thickness-dependent gap,\nstrong non-linear optical coefficients and uncommon interband optical selection\nrules, making it interesting for optoelectronic and spintronic applications. In\nthis work, we monitor the oxidation dynamics of GaSe with thicknesses ranging\nfrom 10 to 200 nm using Raman spectroscopy. In ambient temperature and humidity\nconditions, the intensity of all Raman modes and the luminescence decrease\nrapidly with moderate exposure to above-gap illumination. Concurrently, several\noxidation products appear in the Raman spectra: Ga$_2$Se$_3$, Ga$_2$O$_3$ and\namorphous and crystalline selenium. We find that no safe measurement power\nexists for optical measurements on ultrathin GaSe in ambient conditions. We\ndemonstrate that the simultaneous presence of oxygen, humidity, and above-gap\nillumination is required to activate this photo-oxidation process, which is\nattributed to the transfer of photo-generated charge carriers towards aqueous\noxygen at the sample surface, generating highly reactive superoxide anions that\nrapidly degrade the sample and quench the optical response of the material.\n", "  Electronic properties of III-V semiconductor alloys are examined using first\nprinciples with the focus on the spatial localization of electronic states. We\ncompare localization at the band edges due to various isovalent impurities in a\nhost GaAs including its impact on the photoluminescence line widths and carrier\nmobilities. The extremity of localization at the band edges is correlated with\nthe ability of individual elements to change the band gap and the relative band\nalignment. Additionally, the formation energies of substitutional defects are\ncalculated and linked to challenges associated with the growth and formability\nof alloys. A spectrally-resolved inverse participation ratio is used to map\nlocalization in prospective GaAs-based materials alloyed with B, N, In, Sb, and\nBi for 1.55 $\\mu$m wavelength telecommunication lasers. This analysis is\ncomplemented by a band unfolding of the electronic structure and discussion of\nimplications of localization on the optical gain and Auger losses.\nCorrespondence with experimental data on broadening of the photoluminescence\nspectrum and charge carrier mobilities show that the localization\ncharacteristics can serve as a guideline for engineering of semiconductor\nalloys.\n", "  We theoretically study the single particle Green function of a three\ndimensional disordered Weyl semimetal using a combination of techniques. These\ninclude analytic $T$-matrix and renormalization group methods with\ncomplementary regimes of validity, and an exact numerical approach based on the\nkernel polynomial technique. We show that at any nonzero disorder, Weyl\nexcitations are not ballistic: they instead have a nonzero linewidth that for\nweak short-range disorder arises from non-perturbative resonant impurity\nscattering. Perturbative approaches find a quantum critical point between a\nsemimetal and a metal at a finite disorder strength, but this transition is\navoided due to nonperturbative effects. At moderate disorder strength and\nintermediate energies the avoided quantum critical point renormalizes the\nscaling of single particle properties. In this regime we compute numerically\nthe anomalous dimension of the fermion field and find $\\eta= 0.13 \\pm 0.04$,\nwhich agrees well with a renormalization group analysis ($\\eta= 0.125$). Our\npredictions can be directly tested by ARPES and STM measurements in samples\ndominated by neutral impurities.\n", "  In this paper we entertain a simple idea that the action of ghost free\nmassive gravity (in metric formulation) depends not on the full structure of\nthe square root of a matrix but rather on its invariants given by elementary\nsymmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues. In particular, we show how one can\nconstruct the quadratic action around Minkowski spacetime without ever taking\nthe square root of the perturbed matrix. The method is however absolutely\ngeneric. And it also contains full information on possible non-standard square\nroots coming from intrinsic non-uniqueness of the procedure. In passing, we\nmention some hard problems of those apocryphal square roots in the standard\napproach which might be better tackled with our method. Futher details of the\nlatter are deferred to a separate paper.\n", "  We investigate constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in the neutrino\nsector from a joint analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic\nmicrowave background. The effect of Lorentz invariance violation during the\nepoch of big bang nucleosynthesis changes the predicted helium-4 abundance,\nwhich influences the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background at the\nrecombination epoch. In combination with the latest measurement of the\nprimordial helium-4 abundance, the Planck 2015 data of the cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies give a strong constraint on the deformation parameter\nsince adding the primordial helium measurement breaks the degeneracy between\nthe deformation parameter and the physical dark matter density.\n", "  If millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are responsible for the excess gamma-ray\nemission observed from the region surrounding the Galactic Center, the same\nregion should also contain a large population of low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs). In this study, we compile and utilize a sizable catalog of LMXBs\nobserved in the the Milky Way's globular cluster system and in the Inner\nGalaxy, as well as the gamma-ray emission observed from globular clusters, to\nestimate the flux of gamma rays predicted from MSPs in the Inner Galaxy. From\nthis comparison, we conclude that only up to $\\sim$4-23% of the observed\ngamma-ray excess is likely to originate from MSPs. This result is consistent\nwith, and more robust than, previous estimates which utilized smaller samples\nof both globular clusters and LMXBs. If MSPs had been responsible for the\nentirety of the observed excess, INTEGRAL should have detected $\\sim$$10^3$\nLMXBs from within a $10^{\\circ}$ radius around the Galactic Center, whereas\nonly 42 LMXBs (and 46 additional LMXB candidates) have been observed.\n", "  We present a low-frequency view of the Perseus cluster with new observations\nfrom the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at 230-470 MHz. The data reveal\na multitude of new structures associated with the mini-halo. The mini-halo\nseems to be influenced both by the AGN activity as well as by the sloshing\nmotion of the cool core cluster's gas. In addition, it has a filamentary\nstructure similar to that seen in radio relics found in merging clusters. We\npresent a detailed description of the data reduction and imaging process of the\ndataset. The depth and resolution of the observations allow us to conduct for\nthe first time a detailed comparison of the mini-halo structure with the X-ray\nstructure as seen in the Chandra X-ray images. The resulting image shows very\nclearly that the mini-halo emission is mostly contained behind the cold fronts,\nsimilar to that predicted by simulations of gas sloshing in galaxy clusters.\nHowever, due to the proximity of the Perseus cluster, as well as the quality of\nthe data at low radio frequencies and at X-ray wavelengths, we also find\nevidence of fine structure. This structure includes several radial radio\nfilaments extending in different directions, a concave radio structure\nassociated with the southern X-ray bay and sharp edges that correlate with\nX-ray edges. Mini-halos are therefore not simply diffuse, uniform radio\nsources, but are rather filled with a rich variety of complex structures. These\nresults illustrate the high-quality images that can be obtained with the new\nJVLA at low radio-frequencies, as well as the necessity to obtain deeper,\nhigher-fidelity radio images of mini-halos and halos in clusters to further\nunderstand their origin.\n", "  The study of the inclusive production of a pair of charged light hadrons (a\n\"dihadron\" system) featuring high transverse momenta and well separated in\nrapidity represents a clear channel for the test of the BFKL dynamics at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). This process has much in common with the well\nknown Mueller-Navelet jet production; however, hadrons can be detected at much\nsmaller values of the transverse momentum than jets, thus allowing to explore\nan additional kinematic range, supplementary to the one studied with\nMueller-Navelet jets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to constrain not only\nthe parton densities (PDFs) for the initial proton, but also the parton\nfragmentation functions (FFs) describing the detected hadron in the final\nstate. Here, we present the first full NLA BFKL analysis for cross sections and\nazimuthal angle correlations for dihadrons produced in the LHC kinematic\nranges. We make use of the Brodsky-Lapage-Mackenzie (BLM) optimization method\nto set the values of the renormalization scale and study the effect of choosing\ndifferent values for the factorization scale. We also gauge the uncertainty\ncoming from the use of different PDF and FF parametrizations.\n", "  We calculate the energy of threshold fluctuation $\\delta F_{thr}$ which\ntriggers the transition of superconducting current-carrying bridge to resistive\nstate. We show that the dependence $\\delta F_{thr}(I)\\propto\nI_{dep}\\hbar(1-I/I_{dep})^{5/4}/e$, found by Langer and Ambegaokar for a long\nbridge with length $L \\gg \\xi$, holds far below the critical temperature both\nin dirty and clean limits (here $I_{dep}$ is the depairing current of the\nbridge and $\\xi$ is a coherence length). We also find that even 'weak' local\ndefect (leading to the small suppression of the critical current of the bridge\n$I_c \\lesssim I_{dep}$) provides $\\delta F_{thr}\\propto\nI_c\\hbar(1-I/I_c)^{3/2}/e$, typical for a short bridge with $L \\ll \\xi$ or a\nJosephson junction.\n", "  (This is a general physics level overview article about hidden sectors, and\nhow they motivate searches for long-lived particles. Intended for publication\nin Physics Today.)\n  Searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider have so far come up\nempty, but we just might not be looking in the right place. Spectacular bursts\nof particles appearing seemingly out of nowhere could shed light on some of\nnature's most profound mysteries.\n", "  We study the conditions for spontaneously generating an excitonic mass gap\ndue to Coulomb interactions between anisotropic Dirac fermions in uniaxially\nstrained graphene. The mass gap equation is realized as a self-consistent\nsolution for the self-energy within the Hartree-Fock mean-field and static\nrandom phase approximations. It depends not only on momentum, due to the\nlong-range nature of the interaction, but also on the velocity anisotropy\ncaused by the presence of uniaxial strain. We solve the nonlinear integral\nequation self-consistently by performing large scale numerical calculations on\nvariable grid sizes. We evaluate the mass gap at the charge neutrality (Dirac)\npoint as a function of the dimensionless coupling constant and anisotropy\nparameter. We also obtain the phase diagram of the critical coupling, at which\nthe gap becomes finite, against velocity anisotropy. Our numerical study\nindicates that with an increase in uniaxial strain in graphene the strength of\ncritical coupling decreases, which suggests anisotropy supports formation of\nexcitonic mass gap in graphene.\n", "  The shape transitions and shape coexistence in the Ge and Se isotopes are\nstudied within the interacting boson model (IBM) with the microscopic input\nfrom the self-consistent mean-field calculation based on the Gogny-D1M energy\ndensity functional. The mean-field energy surface as a function of the\nquadrupole shape variables $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, obtained from the constrained\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method, is mapped onto the expectation value of the IBM\nHamiltonian with configuration mixing in the boson condensate state. The\nresultant Hamiltonian is used to compute excitation energies and\nelectromagnetic properties of the selected nuclei $^{66-94}$Ge and\n$^{68-96}$Se. Our calculation suggests that many nuclei exhibit $\\gamma$\nsoftness. Coexistence between prolate and oblate, as well as between spherical\nand $\\gamma$-soft, shapes is also observed. The method provides a reasonable\ndescription of the observed systematics of the excitation energy of the\nlow-lying energy levels and transition strengths for nuclei below the neutron\nshell closure $N=50$, and provides predictions on the spectroscopy of\nneutron-rich Ge and Se isotopes with $52\\leq N\\leq 62$, where data are scarce\nor not available.\n", "  The transmission of low-energy (<1.8eV) photoelectrons through the shell of\ncore-shell aerosol particles is studied for liquid squalane, squalene, and DEHS\nshells. The photoelectrons are exclusively formed in the core of the particles\nby two-photon ionization. The total photoelectron yield recorded as a function\nof shell thickness (1-80nm) shows a bi-exponential attenuation. For all\nsubstances, the damping parameter for shell thicknesses below 15nm lies between\n8 and 9nm, and is tentatively assigned to the electron attenuation length at\nelectron kinetic energies of ~0.5-1eV. The significantly larger damping\nparameters for thick shells (> 20nm) are presumably a consequence of distorted\ncore-shell structures. A first comparison of aerosol and traditional thin film\noverlayer methods is provided.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) grown by chemical vapor\ndeposition (CVD) are plagued by a significantly lower optical quality compared\nto exfoliated TMDC. In this work we show that the optical quality of CVD-grown\nMoSe$_2$ is completely recovered if the material is sandwiched in\nMoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ trilayer van der Waals heterostructures. We show by\nmeans of density-functional theory that this remarkable and unexpected result\nis due to defect healing: S atoms of the more reactive MoS$_2$ layers are\ndonated to heal Se vacancy defects in the middle MoSe$_2$ layer. In addition,\nthe trilayer structure exhibits a considerable charge-transfer mediated valley\npolarization of MoSe$_2$ without the need for resonant excitation. Our\nfabrication approach, relying solely on simple flake transfer technique, paves\nthe way for the scalable production of large-area TMDC materials with excellent\noptical quality.\n", "  In the present work we revisit a model consisting of a scalar field with a\nquartic self-interaction potential non-minimally (conformally) coupled to\ngravity [1]. When the scalar field vacuum is in a broken symmetry state, an\neffective gravitational constant emerges which, in certain regimes, can lead to\ngravitational repulsive effects when only ordinary radiation is coupled to\ngravity. In this case, a bouncing universe is shown to be the only cosmological\nsolution admissible by the field equations when the scalar field is in such a\nbroken symmetry state.\n", "  The potential impact of future quantum networks hinges on high-quality\nquantum entanglement shared between network nodes. Unavoidable real-world\nimperfections necessitate means to improve remote entanglement by local quantum\noperations. Here we realize entanglement distillation on a quantum network\nprimitive of distant electron-nuclear two-qubit nodes. We demonstrate the\nheralded generation of two copies of a remote entangled state through\nsingle-photon-mediated entangling of the electrons and robust storage in the\nnuclear spins. After applying local two-qubit gates, single-shot measurements\nherald the distillation of an entangled state with increased fidelity that is\navailable for further use. In addition, this distillation protocol\nsignificantly speeds up entanglement generation compared to previous\ntwo-photon-mediated schemes. The key combination of generating, storing and\nprocessing entangled states demonstrated here opens the door to exploring and\nutilizing multi-particle entanglement on an extended quantum network.\n", "  Results are reported from an improved measurement of $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow\n\\nu_e$ transitions by the NOvA experiment. Using an exposure equivalent to\n$6.05\\times10^{20}$ protons-on-target 33 $\\nu_e$ candidates were observed with\na background of $8.2\\pm0.8$ (syst.). Combined with the latest NOvA $\\nu_\\mu$\ndisappearance data and external constraints from reactor experiments on\n$\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$, the hypothesis of inverted mass hierarchy with\n$\\theta_{23}$ in the lower octant is disfavored at greater than $93\\%$ C.L. for\nall values of $\\delta_{CP}$.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering experiments on Sr2RuO4 determine the spectral\nweight of the nesting induced magnetic fluctuations across the superconducting\ntransition. There is no observable change at the superconducting transition\ndown to an energy of ~0.35 meV, which is well below the 2 delta values reported\nin several tunneling experiments. At this and higher energies magnetic\nfluctuations clearly persist in the superconducting state. Only at energies\nbelow ~0.3 meV evidence for partial suppression of spectral weight in the\nsuperconducting state can be observed. This strongly suggests that the\none-dimensional bands with the associated nesting fluctuations do not form the\nactive, highly gapped bands in the superconducting pairing in Sr2RuO4.\n", "  The magnon dispersion of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ has been studied by polarized and\nunpolarized neutron scattering experiments on crystals containing 0, 1 and 10 %\nof Ti. The entire dispersion of transverse magnons can be well described by a\nconventional spin-wave model with interaction and anisotropy parameters that\nagree with density functional theory calculations. Spin-orbit coupling strongly\ninfluences the magnetic excitations, which is most visible in large energies of\nthe magnetic zone-center modes arising from magnetic anisotropy. We find\nevidence for a low-lying additional mode that exhibits strongest scattering\nintensity near the antiferromagnetic zone center. This extra signal can be\nexplained by a sizable magnetic moment of 0.11 Bohr magnetons on the apical\noxygens parallel to the Ru moment, which is found in the density functional\ntheory calculations. The energy and the signal strength of the additional\nbranch are well described by taking into account this oxygen moment with weak\nferromagnetic coupling between Ru and O moments.\n", "  We report measurements of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the giant Rashba\nsemiconductor BiTeCl under applied pressures up to ~2.5 GPa. We observe two\ndistinct oscillation frequencies, corresponding to the Rashba-split inner and\nouter Fermi surfaces. BiTeCl has a conduction band bottom that is split into\ntwo sub-bands due to the strong Rashba coupling, resulting in two\nspin-polarized conduction bands as well as a Dirac point. Our results suggest\nthat the chemical potential lies above this Dirac point, giving rise to two\nFermi surfaces. We use a simple two-band model to understand the pressure\ndependence of our sample parameters. Comparing our results on BiTeCl to\nprevious results on BiTeI, we observe similar trends in both the chemical\npotential and the Rashba splitting with pressure.\n", "  We present optical $\\textit{BVRI}$ photometry, H$\\alpha$ IFU velocity fields,\nand H$\\alpha$ long-slit rotation curves for a sample of four nearby spiral\ngalaxies having a range of morphologies and inclinations. We show that the\n$\\texttt{DiskFit}$ code can be used to model the photometric and kinematic data\nof these four galaxies and explore how well the photometric data can be\ndecomposed into structures like bars and bulges and to look for non-circular\nmotions in the kinematic data. In general, we find good agreement between our\nphotometric and kinematic models for most parameters. We find the best\nconsistency between our photometric and kinematic models for NGC 6674, a\nrelatively face-on spiral with clear and distinct bulge and bar components. We\nalso find excellent consistency for NGC 2841, and find a bar $\\sim$10$^{\\circ}$\nsouth of the disc major axis in the inner 20''. Due to geometric effects caused\nby its high inclination, we find the kinematic model for NGC 2654 to be less\naccurate than its photometry. We find the bar in NGC 2654 to be roughly\nparallel to the major axis of the galaxy. We are unable to photometrically\nmodel our most highly inclined galaxy, NGC 5746, with $\\texttt{DiskFit}$ and\ninstead use the galaxy isophotes to determine that the system contains a bar\n$\\sim$5$^{\\circ}$ to $\\sim$10$^{\\circ}$ east of the disc major axis. The high\ninclination and extinction in this galaxy also prevent our kinematic model from\naccurately determining parameters about the bar, though the data are better\nmodeled when a bar is included.\n", "  We investigate the maximum speed at which a driven superfluid can flow\nthrough a narrow constriction with a size on the order of the healing length.\nConsidering dissipation via the thermal nucleation of quantized vortices, we\ncalculate the critical velocity for superfluid $^4$He and ultracold atomtronic\ncircuits, identify fundamental length and velocity scales, and are thus able to\npresent results obtained in widely different temperature and density ranges in\na universal framework. For ultra-narrow channels we predict a drastic reduction\nin the critical velocity as the energy barrier for flow reducing thermally\nactivated phase slip fluctuations is suppressed.\n", "  In a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model(SM) where baryon and\nlepton numbers are local gauge symmetries (BLMSSM), we investigate the charged\nlepton flavor violating (CLFV) processes $Z\\rightarrow l_i^{\\pm}l_j^{\\mp}$\nafter introducing the new gauginos and the right-handed neutrinos. In this\nmodel, the branching ratios of $Z\\rightarrow l_i^{\\pm}l_j^{\\mp}$ are around\n($10^{-8}\\sim10^{-10}$), which approach the present experimental upper bounds.\nWe hope that the branching ratios for these CLFV processes can be detected in\nthe near future.\n", "  The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) has a central role in the\nunderstanding of gravity and space-time. In its weak form, or Weak Equivalence\nPrinciple (WEP), it directly implies equivalence between inertial and\ngravitational mass. Verifying this principle in a regime where the relevant\nproperties of the test body must be described by quantum theory has profound\nimplications. Here we report on a novel WEP test for atoms. A Bragg atom\ninterferometer in a gravity gradiometer configuration compares the free fall of\nrubidium atoms prepared in two hyperfine states and in their coherent\nsuperposition. The use of the superposition state allows testing genuine\nquantum aspects of EEP with no classical analogue, which have remained\ncompletely unexplored so far. In addition, we measure the Eotvos ratio of atoms\nin two hyperfine levels with relative uncertainty in the low $10^{-9}$,\nimproving previous results by almost two orders of magnitude.\n", "  This paper discusses the phenomenon of backreaction within the Szekeres\nmodel. Cosmological backreaction describes how the mean global evolution of the\nUniverse deviates from the Friedmannian evolution. The analysis is based on\nmodels of a single cosmological environment and the global ensemble of the\nSzekeres models (of the Swiss-Cheese-type and Styrofoam-type). The obtained\nresults show that non-linear growth of cosmic structures is associated with the\ngrowth of the spatial curvature $\\Omega_{\\cal R}$ (in the FLRW limit\n$\\Omega_{\\cal R} \\to \\Omega_k$). If averaged over global scales the result\ndepends on the assumed global model of the Universe. Within the Swiss-Cheese\nmodel, which does have a fixed background, the volume average follows the\nevolution of the background, and the global spatial curvature averages out to\nzero (the background model is the $\\Lambda$CDM model, which is spatially flat).\nIn the Styrofoam-type model, which does not have a fixed background, the mean\nevolution deviates from the spatially flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, and the mean\nspatial curvature evolves to from $\\Omega_{\\cal R} =0 $ at the CMB to\n$\\Omega_{\\cal R} \\sim 0.1$ at $z =0$. If the Styrofoam-type model correctly\ncaptures evolutionary features of the real Universe then one should expect that\nin our Universe, the spatial curvature should build up (local growth of cosmic\nstructures) and its mean global average should deviate from zero\n(backreaction). As a result, this paper predicts that the low-redshift Universe\nshould not be spatially flat (i.e. $\\Omega_k \\ne 0$, even if in the early\nUniverse $\\Omega_k = 0$) and therefore when analysing low-$z$ cosmological data\none should keep $\\Omega_k$ as a free parameter and independent from the CMB\nconstraints.\n", "  Non-reciprocity and asymmetric transmission in optical and plasmonic systems\nis a key element for engineering the one-way propagation structures for light\nmanipulation. Here we investigate topological nanostructures covered with\ngraphene-based meta-surfaces, which consist of a periodic pattern of\nsub-wavelength stripes of graphene winding around the (meta-) tube or\n(meta-)torus. We establish the relation between the topological and plasmonic\nproperties in these structures, as justified by simple theoretical expressions.\nOur results demonstrate how to use strong asymmetric and chiral plasmonic\nresponses to tailor the electrodynamic properties in topological\nmeta-structures. Cavity resonances formed by elliptical and hyperbolic plasmons\nin meta-structures are sensitive to the one-way propagation regime in a finite\nlength (Fabry-Perot-like) meta-tube and display the giant mode splitting in a\n(Mach-Zehnder-like) meta-torus.\n", "  Theory and experiment both demonstrate that an entangled quantum state of two\nsubsystems is neither a superposition of states of its subsystems nor a\nsuperposition of composite states but rather a coherent superposition of\nnonlocal correlations between incoherently mixed local states of the two\nsubsystems. Thus, even if one subsystem happens to be macroscopic as in the\nentangled \"Schrodinger's cat\" state resulting from an ideal measurement, this\nstate is not the paradoxical macroscopic superposition it is generally presumed\nto be. It is, instead, a \"macroscopic correlation,\" a coherent quantum\ncorrelation in which one of the two correlated sub-systems happens to be\nmacroscopic. This clarifies the physical meaning of entanglement: When a\nsuperposed quantum system A is unitarily entangled with a second quantum system\nB, the coherence of the original superposition of different states of A is\ntransferred to different correlations between states of A and B, so the\nentangled state becomes a superposition of correlations rather than a\nsuperposition of states. This transfer preserves unitary evolution while\npermitting B to be macroscopic without entailing a macroscopic superposition.\nThis resolves the \"problem of outcomes\" but is not a complete resolution of the\nmeasurement problem because the entangled state is still reversible.\n", "  The fast detection of terahertz radiation is of great importance for various\napplications such as fast imaging, high speed communications, and spectroscopy.\nMost commercial products capable of sensitively responding the terahertz\nradiation are thermal detectors, i.e., pyroelectric sensors and bolometers.\nThis class of terahertz detectors is normally characterized by low modulation\nfrequency (dozens or hundreds of Hz). Here we demonstrate the first fast\nsemiconductor-based terahertz quantum well photodetectors by carefully\ndesigning the device structure and microwave transmission line for high\nfrequency signal extraction. Modulation response bandwidth of gigahertz level\nis obtained. As an example, the 6.2-GHz modulated terahertz light emitted from\na Fabry-P\\'{e}rot terahertz quantum cascade laser is successfully detected\nusing the fast terahertz quantum well photodetector. In addition to the fast\nterahertz detection, the technique presented in this work can also facilitate\nthe frequency stability or phase noise characterizations for terahertz quantum\ncascade lasers.\n", "  In earlier work, my colleagues and I developed a formalism for using\ninformation theory to understand scales of organization and structure in\nmulti-component systems. One prominent theme of that work was that the\nstructure of a system cannot always be decomposed into pairwise relationships.\nIn this brief communication, I refine that formalism to address recent examples\nwhich bring out that theme in a novel and subtle way. After summarizing key\npoints of earlier papers, I introduce the crucial new concept of an ancilla\ncomponent, and I apply this refinement of our formalism to illustrative\nexamples. The goals of this brief communication are, first, to show how a\nsimple scheme for constructing ancillae can be useful in bringing out\nsubtleties of structure, and second, to compare this scheme with another recent\nproposal in the same genre.\n", "  This is the documentation of the tomographic X-ray data of a carved cheese\nslice. Data are available at www.fips.fi/dataset.php, and can be freely used\nfor scientific purposes with appropriate references to them, and to this\ndocument in http://arxiv.org/. The data set consists of (1) the X-ray sinogram\nof a single 2D slice of the cheese slice with three different resolutions and\n(2) the corresponding measurement matrices modeling the linear operation of the\nX-ray transform. Each of these sinograms was obtained from a measured\n360-projection fan-beam sinogram by down-sampling and taking logarithms. The\noriginal (measured) sinogram is also provided in its original form and\nresolution.\n", "  We present a one-parameter family of stationary, asymptotically flat\nsolutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with only a mild singularity, which\nare endowed with mass, angular momentum, a dipole magnetic moment and a\nquadrupole electric moment. We briefly analyze the structure of this solution,\nwhich we interpret as a system of two extreme co-rotating black holes with\nequal masses and electric charges, and opposite magnetic and gravimagnetic\ncharges, held apart by an electrically charged, magnetized string which also\nacts as a Dirac-Misner string.\n", "  We build a single vertical straight magnetic fluxtube spanning the solar\nphotosphere and the transition region which does not expand with height. We\nassume that the fluxtube containing twisted magnetic fields is in\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium within a realistic stratified atmosphere subject\nto solar gravity. Incorporating specific forms of current density and gas\npressure in the Grad--Shafranov equation, we solve the magnetic flux function,\nand find it to be separable with a Coulomb wave function in radial direction\nwhile the vertical part of the solution decreases exponentially. We employ\nimproved fluxtube boundary conditions and take a realistic ambient external\npressure for the photosphere to transition region, to derive a family of\nsolutions for reasonable values of the fluxtube radius and magnetic field\nstrength at the base of the axis that are the free parameters in our model. We\nfind that our model estimates are consistent with the magnetic field strength\nand the radii of Magnetic bright points (MBPs) as estimated from observations.\nWe also derive thermodynamic quantities inside the fluxtube.\n", "  We develope a self-consistent description of the Broad Line Region based on\nthe concept of the failed wind powered by the radiation pressure acting on\ndusty accretion disk atmosphere in Keplerian motion. The material raised high\nabove the disk is illuminated, dust evaportes, and the matter falls back\ntowards the disk. This material is the source of emission lines. The model\npredicts the inner and outer radius of the region, the cloud dynamics under the\ndust radiation pressure and, subsequently, just the gravitational field of the\ncentral black hole, which results in assymetry between the rise and fall.\nKnowledge of the dynamics allows to predict the shapes of the emission lines as\nfunctions of the basic parameters of an active nucleus: black hole mass,\naccretion rate, black hole spin (or accretion efficiency) and the viewing angle\nwith respect to the symmetry axis. Here we show preliminary results based on\nanalytical approximations to the cloud motion.\n", "  We study the Brownian dynamics of a solid particle on a vibrating solid\nsurface. Phenomenologically, the interaction between the two solid surfaces is\nmodeled by solid friction, and the Gaussian white noise models the vibration of\nthe solid surface. The solid friction is proportional to the sign of relative\nvelocity. We derive the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for the time-dependent\nprobability distribution to find the particle at a given location. We calculate\nanalytically the steady state velocity distribution function, mean-squared\nvelocity and diffusion coefficient in $d$ dimensions. We present a generic\nmethod of calculating the autocorrelations in $d$ dimensions. This results in\none dimension in an exact evaluation of the steady state velocity\nautocorrelation. In higher dimensions, our exact general expression enables the\nanalytic evaluation of the autocorrelation to any required approximation. We\npresent approximate analytic expressions in two and three dimensions. Next, we\nnumerically calculate the mean-square velocity and steady state velocity\nautocorrelation function up to $d=3$. Our numerical results are in good\nagreement with the analytically obtained results.\n", "  Many-body fermionic quantum calculations performed on analog quantum\ncomputers are restricted by the presence of k-local terms, which represent\ninteractions among more than two qubits. These originate from the\nfermion-to-qubit mapping applied to the electronic Hamiltonians. Current\nsolutions to this problem rely on perturbation theory in an enlarged Hilbert\nspace. The main challenge associated with this technique is that it relies on\ncoupling constants with very different magnitudes. This prevents its\nimplementation in currently available architectures. In order to resolve this\nissue, we present an optimization scheme that unfolds the k-local terms into a\nlinear combination of 2-local terms, while ensuring the conservation of all\nrelevant physical properties of the original Hamiltonian, with several orders\nof magnitude smaller variation of the coupling constants.\n", "  Using a cosmological $N$-body simulation, we investigate the origin and\ndistribution of stars in the intracluster light (ICL) of a Fornax-like cluster.\nIn a dark matter only simulation we identify a halo which, at $z=0$, has $M_200\n\\simeq 4.1 \\times 10^{13}M_{sun}$ and $r_{200} = 700kpc$, and replace infalling\nsubhalos with models that include spheroid and disc components. As they fall\ninto the cluster, the stars in some of these galaxies are stripped from their\nhosts, and form the ICL. We consider the separate contributions to the ICL from\nstars which originate in the haloes and the discs of the galaxies. We find that\ndisc ICL stars are more centrally concentrated than halo ICL stars. The\nmajority of the disc ICL stars are associated with one initially disc-dominated\ngalaxy that falls to the centre of the cluster and is heavily disrupted,\nproducing part of the cD galaxy. At radial distances greater than 200kpc, well\nbeyond the stellar envelope of the cD galaxy, stars formerly from the stellar\nhaloes of galaxies dominate the ICL. Therefore at large distances, the ICL\npopulation is dominated by older stars.\n", "  Most stars form in star clusters and stellar associated. To understand the\nroles of star cluster environments in shaping the dynamical evolution of\nplanetary systems, we carry out direct $N$-body simulations of four planetary\nsystems models in three different star cluster environments with respectively\nN=2k, 8k and 32k stars. In each cluster, an ensemble of initially identical\nplanetary systems are assigned to solar-type stars with $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}$ and\nevolved for 50~Myr. We found that following the depletion of protoplanetary\ndisks, external perturbations and planet-planet interactions are two driving\nmechanisms responsible for the destabilization of planetary systems. The planet\nsurvival rate varies from $\\sim 95\\%$ in the N=2k cluster to $\\sim 60\\%$ in the\nN=32k cluster, which suggests that most planetary systems can indeed survive in\nlow-mass clusters, except in the central regions. We also find that planet\nejections through stellar encounters are cumulative processes, as only $\\sim\n3\\%$ of encounters are strong enough to excite the eccentricity by $\\Delta e\n\\geq 0.5$. Short-period planets can be perturbed through orbit crossings with\nlong-period planets. When taking into account planet-planet interactions, the\nplanet ejection rate nearly doubles, and therefore multiplicity contributes to\nthe vulnerability of planetary systems. In each ensemble, $\\sim 0.2\\%$ of\nplanetary orbits become retrograde due to random directions of stellar\nencounters. Our results predict that young low-mass star clusters are promising\nsites for next-generation planet surveys, yet low planet detection rates are\nexpected in dense globular clusters such as 47 Tuc. Nevertheless, planets in\ndenser stellar environments are likely to have shorter orbital periods, which\nenhances their detectability.\n", "  Shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) techniques have the potential to drive a\nsystem beyond the adiabatic limits. Here, we present a robust and efficient\nmethod for wireless power transfer (WPT) between two coils based on the\nso-called transitionless quantum driving (TQD) algorithm. We show that it is\npossible to transfer power between the coils significantly fast compared to its\nadiabatic counterpart. The scheme is fairly robust against the variations in\nthe coupling strength and the coupling distance between the coils. Also, the\nscheme is found to be reasonably immune to intrinsic losses in the coils.\n", "  We propose a simple bose-fermi model in two dimensions, with a coupling that\nconverts pairs of opposite spin fermions into localized bosons and vice versa.\nWe show that tracing out one of the degrees, either the bosons or fermions,\ngenerates temperature-dependent long range effective interactions between\nbosons as well as effective attractive interactions between fermions. Using\nMonte Carlo techniques we obtain the thermodynamic properties and phase\nstiffness as a function of temperature, dominated by vortex-antivortex\nunbinding of the bosons. Remarkably in the fermion sector we observe a\ntemperature-induced BCS-BEC crossover signaled by a distinct change of their\nspectral properties: the minimum gap locus moves from the Fermi wave vector to\nthe $\\Gamma$ point. Such a model is relevant for describing aspects of high\n$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and pnictides, superconducting islands on\ngraphene, and bose-fermi mixtures in cold atomic systems.\n", "  Gravitational lensing provides a means to measure mass that does not rely on\ndetecting and analysing light from the lens itself. Compact objects are ideal\ngravitational lenses, because they have relatively large masses and are dim. In\nthis paper we describe the prospects for predicting lensing events generated by\nthe local population of compact objects, consisting of 250 neutron stars, 5\nblack holes, and approximately 35,000 white dwarfs. By focusing on a population\nof nearby compact objects with measured proper motions and known distances from\nus, we can measure their masses by studying the characteristics of any lensing\nevent they generate. Here we concentrate on shifts in the position of a\nbackground source due to lensing by a foreground compact object. With HST,\nJWST, and Gaia, measurable centroid shifts caused by lensing are relatively\nfrequent occurrences. We find that 30-50 detectable events per decade are\nexpected for white dwarfs. Because relatively few neutron stars and black holes\nhave measured distances and proper motions, it is more difficult to compute\nrealistic rates for them. However, we show that at least one isolated neutron\nstar has likely produced detectable events during the past several decades.\nThis work is particularly relevant to the upcoming data releases by the Gaia\nmission and also to data that will be collected by JWST. Monitoring predicted\nmicrolensing events will not only help to determine the masses of compact\nobjects, but will also potentially discover dim companions to these stellar\nremnants, including orbiting exoplanets.\n", "  We measure the effects of interstellar scattering on average pulse profiles\nfrom 13 radio pulsars with simple pulse shapes. We use data from the LOFAR High\nBand Antennas, at frequencies between 110 and 190~MHz. We apply a forward\nfitting technique, and simultaneously determine the intrinsic pulse shape,\nassuming single Gaussian component profiles. We find that the constant $\\tau$,\nassociated with scattering by a single thin screen, has a power-law dependence\non frequency $\\tau \\propto \\nu^{-\\alpha}$, with indices ranging from $\\alpha =\n1.50$ to $4.0$, despite simplest theoretical models predicting $\\alpha = 4.0$\nor $4.4$. Modelling the screen as an isotropic or extremely anisotropic\nscatterer, we find anisotropic scattering fits lead to larger power-law\nindices, often in better agreement with theoretically expected values. We\ncompare the scattering models based on the inferred, frequency dependent\nparameters of the intrinsic pulse, and the resulting correction to the\ndispersion measure (DM). We highlight the cases in which fits of extreme\nanisotropic scattering are appealing, while stressing that the data do not\nstrictly favour either model for any of the 13 pulsars. The pulsars show\nanomalous scattering properties that are consistent with finite scattering\nscreens and/or anisotropy, but these data alone do not provide the means for an\nunambiguous characterization of the screens. We revisit the empirical $\\tau$\nversus DM relation and consider how our results support a frequency dependence\nof $\\alpha$. Very long baseline interferometry, and observations of the\nscattering and scintillation properties of these sources at higher frequencies,\nwill provide further evidence.\n", "  We present a user of model interaction based on the physics of kinetic\nexchange, and extend it to individuals placed in a grid with local interaction.\nWe show with numerical analysis and partial analytical results that the\ncritical symmetry breaking transitions and percolation effects typical of the\nfull interaction model do not take place if the range of interaction is\nlimited, allowing for the co-existence of majorty and minority opinions in the\nsame community.\n  We then introduce a peer recommender system in the model, showing that, even\nwith very local iteraction and a small probability of appeal to the\nrecommender, its presence is sufficient to make both symmetry breaking and\npercolation reappear. This seems to indicate that one effect of a\nrecommendation system is to uniform the opinions of a community, reducing\nminority opinions or making them disappear. Although the recommender system\ndoes uniform the community opinion, it doesn't constrain it, in the sense that\nall opinions have the same probability of becoming the dominating one. We do a\npartial study, however, that suggests that a \"mischievous\" recommender might be\nable to bias a community so that one opinion will emerge over the opposite with\noverwhelming probability.\n", "  Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been widely used in the combustion\nliterature to study the low-to-intermediate temperature ignition of many fuels.\nIn a typical RCM, the pressure during and after the compression stroke is\nmeasured. However, measurement of the temperature history in the RCM reaction\nchamber is challenging. Thus, the temperature is generally calculated by the\nisentropic relations between pressure and temperature, assuming that the\nadiabatic core hypothesis holds. To estimate the uncertainty in the calculated\ntemperature, an uncertainty propagation analysis must be carried out. Our\nprevious analyses assumed that the uncertainties of the parameters in the\nequation to calculate the temperature were normally distributed and\nindependent, but these assumptions do not hold for typical RCM operating\nprocedures. In this work, a Monte Carlo method is developed to estimate the\nuncertainty in the calculated temperature, while taking into account the\ncorrelation between parameters and the possibility of non-normal probability\ndistributions. In addition, the Monte Carlo method is compared to an analysis\nthat assumes normally distributed, independent parameters. Both analysis\nmethods show that the magnitude of the initial pressure and the uncertainty of\nthe initial temperature have strong influences on the magnitude of the\nuncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty estimation methods studied here provide a\nreference value for the uncertainty of the reference temperature in an RCM and\ncan be generalized to other similar facilities.\n", "  Aerial suspended optical-fiber links are being considered as economical\nalternatives to buried links for long-distance transfer of coherent time and\nfrequency signals. We present stability measurements of an actively stabilized\n20 MHz photonic signal over aerial fiber links up to 186.2 km in length.\nAbsolute frequency stabilities of 2.7x10^-3 Hz at 1 s of integration, and\n2.5x10^-5 Hz at 8x10^3 s of integration are achieved over this longest link.\nThis stability is compared to that achieved over buried links for both radio\nand microwave frequencies. The results show that aerial fiber links are a\nsuitable alternative to buried links for a wide range of frequency transfer\napplications.\n", "  This design report describes the construction plans for the world's first\nmulti-pass SRF ERL. It is a 4-pass recirculating linac that recovers the beam's\nenergy by 4 additional, decelerating passes. All beams are returned for\ndeceleration in a single beam pipe with a large-momentum-aperture permanent\nmagnet FFAG optics. Cornell University has been pioneering a new class of\naccelerators, Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs), with a new characteristic set of\nbeam parameters. Technology has been prototyped that is essential for any high\nbrightness electron ERL. This includes a DC electron source and an SRF injector\nLinac with world-record current and normalized brightness in a bunch train, a\nhigh-current linac cryomodule, and a high-power beam stop, and several\ndiagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. All these are now\nbeing used to construct a novel one-cryomodule ERL in Cornell's Wilson Lab.\nBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has designed a multi-turn ERL for eRHIC,\nwhere beam is transported more than 20 times around the 4km long RHIC tunnel.\nThe number of transport lines is minimized by using two arcs with\nstrongly-focusing permanent magnets that can control many beams of different\nenergies. A collaboration between BNL and Cornell has been formed to\ninvestigate this multi-turn eRHIC ERL design by building a 4-turn,\none-cryomodule ERL at Cornell. It also has a return loop built with strongly\nfocusing permanent magnets and is meant to accelerate 40mA beam to 150MeV. This\nhigh-brightness beam will have applications beyond accelerator research, in\nindustry, in nuclear physics, and in X-ray science.\n", "  A new deep HI survey of the galaxy Messier 33 is presented, based on\nobservations obtained at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. We\nobserve a perturbed outer gas distribution and kinematics in M33, and confirm\nthe disk warping as a significant kinematical twist of the major axis of the\nvelocity field, though no strong tilt is measured, in agreement with previous\nwork. Evidence for a new low brightness HI component with anomalous velocity is\nreported. It harbours a large velocity scatter, as its kinematics both exceeds\nand lags the rotation of the disk, and leaks in the forbidden velocity zone of\napparent counter-rotation. The observations also reveal wide and multiple peak\nHI profiles which can be partly explained by crowded orbits in the framework of\nthe warp model. Asymmetric motions are identified in the velocity field, as\npossible signatures of a lopsided potential and the warp. The mass distribution\nmodeling of the hybrid Halpha-HI rotation curve favours a cuspy dark matter\nhalo with a concentration in disagreement with the LambdaCDM dark halo\nmass-concentration relationship. The total mass enclosed in 23 kpc is 8 10^10\nMsol, of which 11% are stars and gas. At the virial radius of the cuspy halo,\nthe resulting total mass is 5 10^11 Msol, but with a baryonic mass fraction of\n2% only. This strongly suggests a more realistic radius encompassing the total\nmass of M33 well smaller than the virial radius of the halo, maybe comparable\nto the size of the HI disk.\n", "  Two very different methods are used to estimate the magnitude of the\neffective cosmological constant / dark energy (for the present cosmic epoch).\nTheir results agree with each other and are in agreement with observations. One\nmethod makes use of unimodular gravity and causal set theory, while the other\none employs arguments involving spacetime foam and holography. I also motivate\nand discuss the possibility that quanta of (both) dark energy (and dark matter\nin the Modified Dark Matter model) are extended/non-local, obeying infinite\nstatistics, also known as quantum Boltzmann statistics. Such quanta out-number\nordinary particles obeying Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics by a factor\nof $\\sim 10^{30}$.\n", "  Conformal invariance powerfully constrains the critical behavior of\ntwo-dimensional classical systems with short-range interactions and the\ncritical theories in two-dimensions are parametrized by a dimensional number,\ntermed central charge or conformal anomaly $c$. However, experimental\ndetermination of the central charge of a conformal field theory has not been\ndone before. Here we propose to extract the central charge of the conformal\nfield theory corresponding to a critical point of a two-dimensional lattice\nmodels from the quantum decoherence measurement of a probe spin which is\ncoupled to the two-dimensional lattice models. Conformal invariance predicts\nthat the leading finite-size correction to the free energy for a\ntwo-dimensional system at a conformal invariant critical point is linearly\nrelated to the conformal anomaly for various boundary conditions. A recent\ndiscovery of thermodynamic holography allows us to obtain the free energy of\nmany-body system from central spin decoherence measurement. Thus the central\ncharge of the conformal field theory could be extracted from central spin\ndecoherence measurement. We have applied the method to the two-dimensional\nIsing model and extracted the central charge of two-dimensional Ising model\nwith good precision. This work provides a useful approach to extracting the\ncentral charge of conformal field theory in various two-dimensional lattice\nsystems.\n", "  Using the momentum space representation, we study the (2 +1)-dimensional\nDuffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator for spin 0 particle under a magnetic field in\nthe presence of a minimal length in the noncommutative space. The explicit form\nof energy eigenvalues are found, the wave functions and the corresponding\nprobability density are reported in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.\nAdditionally, we also discuss the special cases and depict the corresponding\nnumerical results.\n", "  The ability to generate complex optical photon states involving entanglement\nbetween multiple optical modes is not only critical to advancing our\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics but will play a key role in generating many\napplications in quantum technologies. These include quantum communications,\ncomputation, imaging, microscopy and many other novel technologies that are\nconstantly being proposed. However, approaches to generating parallel multiple,\ncustomisable bi- and multi-entangled quantum bits (qubits) on a chip are still\nin the early stages of development. Here, we review recent developments in the\nrealisation of integrated sources of photonic quantum states, focusing on\napproaches based on nonlinear optics that are compatible with contemporary\noptical fibre telecommunications and quantum memory infrastructures as well as\nwith chip-scale semiconductor technology. These new and exciting platforms hold\nthe promise of compact, low-cost, scalable and practical implementations of\nsources for the generation and manipulation of complex quantum optical states\non a chip, which will play a major role in bringing quantum technologies out of\nthe laboratory and into the real world.\n", "  Human movement is used as an indicator of human activity in modern society.\nThe velocity of moving humans is calculated based on position information\nobtained from mobile phones. The level of human activity, as recorded by\nvelocity, varies throughout the day. Therefore, velocity can be used to\nidentify the intervals of highest and lowest activity. More specifically, we\nobtained mobile-phone GPS data from the people around Shibuya station in Tokyo,\nwhich has the highest population density in Japan. From these data, we observe\nthat velocity tends to consistently increase with the changes in social\nactivities. For example, during the earthquake in Kumamoto Prefecture in April\n2016, the activity on that day was much lower than usual. In this research, we\nfocus on natural disasters such as earthquakes owing to their significant\neffects on human activities in developed countries like Japan. In the event of\na natural disaster in another developed country, considering the change in\nhuman behavior at the time of the disaster (e.g., the 2016 Kumamoto Great\nEarthquake) from the viewpoint of velocity allows us to improve our planning\nfor mitigation measures. Thus, we analyze the changes in human activity through\nvelocity calculations in Shibuya, Tokyo, and compare times of disasters with\nnormal times.\n", "  We investigate energetic particle transport in Corotating Interaction Regions\n(CIRs) through a case study. The CIR event we study occurred on $2008$ February\n$08$ and was observed by both the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the\ntwin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-B spacecraft. An in-situ\nreverse shock was observed by STEREO-B ($1.0$ AU) but not ACE ($0.98$ AU).\nUsing STEREO-B observations and assuming the CIR structure does not vary\nsignificantly in the corotating frame, we estimate the shock location at later\ntimes for both the STEREO-B and ACE observations. Further assuming the\naccelerated particle spectral shape at the shock does not vary with shock\nlocation, we calculate the particle differential intensities as observed by ACE\nand STEREO-B at two different times by solving the focused transport equation\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation. We assume that particles move along Parker's\nfield and experience no cross-field diffusion. We find that the modulation of\nsub-MeV/nucleon particles is significant. To obtain reasonable comparisons\nbetween the simulations and the observations by both ACE and STEREO-B, one has\nto assume that the CIR shock can accelerate more particles at a larger\nheliocentric distance than at a smaller heliocentric distance.\n", "  Graphene is a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications. In this\nreport, a double gated bilayer graphene FET has been made using a combination\nof electrostatic and electrolytic gating in order to form an abrupt p-n\njunction. The presence of two Dirac peaks in the gating curve of the fabricated\ndevice confirms the formation of a p-n junction. At low temperatures, when the\nelectrolyte is frozen intentionally, the photovoltage exhibits a six-fold\npattern indicative of the hot electron induced photothermoelectric effect that\nhas also been seen in graphene p-n junctions made using metallic gates. We have\nobserved that the photovoltage increases with decreasing temperature indicating\na dominant role of supercollision scattering. Our technique can also be\nextended to other 2D materials and to finer features that will lead to p-n\njunctions which span a large area, like a superlattice, that can generate a\nlarger photoresponse. Our work creating abrupt p-n junctions is distinct from\nprevious works that use a source-drain bias voltage with a single ionic gate\ncreating a spatially graded p-n junction.\n", "  We study the correlation dynamics of a system composed of arbitrary numbers\nof qutrits interacting with a common environment. Initially, the system is\nassumed to be in a low dimensional subspace of the Hamiltonian called\n\"decoherence-free subspace\". Environment induced quantum entanglement and\ndiscord is calculated between pair of qutrits of the system as measures of\nnon-classical correlations. Finally the steady state distribution of\nentanglement and discord is determined with respect to the total number of\nqutrits of the system.\n", "  Calculation of the potential field inside a three-dimensional box with the\nnormal magnetic field component given on all boundaries is needed for\nestimation of important quantities related to the magnetic field such as free\nenergy and relative helicity. In this work we present an analysis of three\nmethods for calculating potential field inside a three-dimensional box. The\naccuracy and performance of the methods are tested on artificial models with a\npriori known solutions.\n", "  Binary random compacts with different proportions of small (volume V) and\nlarge (volume 2V) bare maghemite nanoparticles (NPs) are used to investigate\nthe effect of controllably broadening the particle size distribution on the\nmagnetic properties of magnetic NP assemblies with strong dipolar interaction.\nA series of eight random mixtures of highly uniform 9.0 and 11.5 nm diameter\nmaghemite particles prepared by thermal decomposition are studied. In spite of\nseverely broadened size distributions in the mixed samples, well defined\nsuperspin glass transition temperatures are observed across the series, their\nvalues increasing linearly with the weight fraction of large particles.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the generation of Gaussian invariant states in\ncascades of open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum\nstochastic differential equations. We carry out infinitesimal perturbation\nanalysis of the covariance matrix for the invariant Gaussian state of such a\nsystem and the related purity functional subject to inaccuracies in the energy\nand coupling matrices of the subsystems. This leads to the problem of balancing\nthe state-space realizations of the component oscillators through symplectic\nsimilarity transformations in order to minimize the mean square sensitivity of\nthe purity functional to small random perturbations of the parameters. This\nresults in a quadratic optimization problem with an effective solution in the\ncase of cascaded one-mode oscillators, which is demonstrated by a numerical\nexample. We also discuss a connection of the sensitivity index with classical\nstatistical distances and outline infinitesimal perturbation analysis for\ntranslation invariant cascades of identical oscillators. The findings of the\npaper are applicable to robust state generation in quantum stochastic networks.\n", "  It was found that at cryogenic temperatures the spontaneous emission of\nsingle electrons from cathode of PMT is increased by lowering the temperature\nof PMT. This effect has not found yet a satisfactory explanation. It was\nsuggested by us that the source of cryogenic dark current is a conversion of\nhidden photons on a metallic surface. To check this hypothesis a series of\nmeasurements have been performed using a multicathode counter developed by us\nas a detector of single electrons. Upon the results of measurements during 78\ndays in configurations R1 and R2 of a multicathode counter with a copper\ncathode the dependence of the counting rate of single electrons on temperature\nhas been obtained. The results obtained are in agreement with the hypotheses\nthat hidden photons are the source of a cryogenic dark current. These very\npreliminary results have to be checked by further measurements.\n", "  Scheduling parallel sessions of an academic meeting is a complicated task. If\neach presentation is assigned to an appropriate session, an antiferromagnetic\nPotts model can be used for semi-automatic timetabling. The timetabling method\nproposed here is based on graph coloring and includes additional constraints to\nbe considered in a practical situation. We examine the feasibility of\nsemi-automatic timetabling in some practical examples.\n", "  We demonstrate resonances due to coherent population pumping in a bright\nstate (CBS), using magnetic sublevels of the closed $ F_g = 2 \\rightarrow F_e =\n3 $ transition in $^{87}$Rb. The experiments are performed at room temperature\nvapor in two kinds of cells---one that is pure and the second that contains a\nbuffer gas of Ne at 20 torr. We also present the effect of pump power variation\non the CBS linewidth, and explain the behavior by using a power-dependent\nscattering rate. The experimentally observed CBS resonances are supported by a\ndensity-matrix analysis of the system.\n", "  We demonstrate a technique for obtaining the density of atomic vapor, by\ndoing a fit of the resonant absorption spectrum to a density-matrix model. In\norder to demonstrate the usefulness of the technique, we apply it to absorption\nin the ${\\rm D_2}$ line of a Cs vapor cell at room temperature. The lineshape\nof the spectrum is asymmetric due to the role of open transitions. This\nasymmetry is explained in the model using transit-time relaxation as the atoms\ntraverse the laser beam. We also obtain the latent heat of evaporation by\nstudying the number density as a function of temperature close to room\ntemperature.\n", "  We present here a brief overview of current-induced spin polarization in bulk\nsemiconductors and semiconductor structures of various dimension. The role of\nband structure and spin relaxation processes is discussed. The related\nphenomena, such as spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect and other are\ndiscussed. Our recent results in this field are presented as well.\n", "  We are concerned with the inverse scattering problem of extracting the\ngeometric structures of an unknown/inaccessible inhomogeneous medium by using\nthe corresponding acoustic far-field measurement. Using the intrinsic geometric\nproperties of the so-called interior transmission eigenfunctions, we develop a\nnovel inverse scattering scheme. The proposed method can efficiently capture\nthe cusp singularities of the support of the inhomogeneous medium. If further a\npriori information is available on the support of the medium, say, it is a\nconvex polyhedron, then one can actually recover its shape. Both theoretical\nanalysis and numerical experiments are provided. Our reconstruction method is\nnew to the literature and opens up a new direction in the study of inverse\nscattering problems.\n", "  Literature and experimental data about practical determination of phase\ncomposition and structure of BiHTSC ceramics from results of measurements of\ntemperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility are presented. It is shown\nthat Bi2223 to Bi2212 phases ratio, calculated by XRD-analysis results, does\nnot correlate precisely with magnetic susceptibility - temperature dependence.\nPhase, which is present in smaller amount, especially Bi2212 phase with lower\ncritical temperature, appears less pronouncedly at the magnetic susceptibility\n- temperature dependence. Besides, limiting parts of Meissner effect\nmanifestation are peculiarities of contacts of superconducting grains.\nDifferent kinds of such contacts lead to lowering the critical temperature\ntogether with conservation of narrow transition interval, to division of\ntransition into stages, and to increasing of transition interval. Among\nnegative consequences of this influence there are hindrances in realization of\ngrain oriented Bi ceramics synthesis scheme which imply powdering of samples\nconsisting of chaotically evolved grains of Bi2223 phase, ordered placement of\nobtained plate grains of this phase - for example, through vibration\ncompacting, and sintering.\n", "  We will study the splitting in the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom\nsubjected to a uniform electric field (Stark effect) with the Heisenberg\nalgebra deformed leading to the minimum length. We will use the perturbation\ntheory for cases not degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n=2$), along with\nknown results of corrections in these levels caused by the minimum length\napplied purely to the hydrogen atom, so that we may find and estimate the\ncorrections of minimum length applied to the Stark effect.\n", "  The modified theories of gravity, especially the $f(R)$ gravity, have\nattracted much attention in the last decade. This paper is devoted to exploring\nplane symmetric solutions in the context of metric $f(R)$ gravity. We extend\nthe work on static plane symmetric vacuum solutions in $f(R)$ gravity already\navailable in literature [1, 2]. The modified field equations are solved using\nthe assumption of both constant and non-constant scalar curvature. Some well\nknown solutions have been recovered with power law and logarithmic forms of\n$f(R)$ models.\n", "  Understanding the intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is\nimportant to their use as cosmological standard candles. Understanding the\neffects of reddening and redshift on the observed colors are complicated and\ndependent on the intrinsic spectrum, the filter curves, and the wavelength\ndependence of reddening. We present ultraviolet and optical data of a growing\nsample of SNe Ia observed with the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope on the Swift\nspacecraft and use this sample to re-examine the near-UV (NUV) colors of SNe\nIa. We find that a small amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.2 mag) could account for\nthe difference between groups designated as NUV-blue and NUV-red, and a\nmoderate amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.5 mag) could account for the whole\nNUV-optical differences. The reddening scenario, however, is inconsistent with\nthe mid-UV colors and color evolution. The effect of redshift alone only\naccounts for part of the variation. Using a spectral template of SN2011fe we\ncan forward model the effects of redshift and reddening and directly compare\nwith the observed colors. We find that some SNe are consistent with reddened\nversions of SN2011fe, but most SNe Ia are much redder in the uvw1-v color than\nSN2011fe reddened to the same b-v color. The absolute magnitudes show that two\nof five NUV-blue SNe Ia are blue because their near-UV luminosity is high, and\nthe other three are optically fainter. We also show that SN2011fe is not a\n\"normal\" SN Ia in the UV, but has colors placing it at the blue extreme of our\nsample.\n", "  I introduce a new notion, that extends the mutually unbiased bases (MUB)\nconditons to more than two bases. These, I call the nUB conditions, and the\ncorresponding bases $n$-fold unbiased. They naturally appear while optimizing\ngeneric $n$-to-one quantum random access code (QRAC) strategies. While their\nexistence in general dimensions is an open question, they nevertheless give\nclose-to-tight upper bounds on QRAC success probabilities, and raise\nfundamental questions about the geometry of quantum states.\n", "  A one-parameter family of binary inflation rules in one dimension is\nconsidered. Apart from the first member, which is the well-known Fibonacci\nrule, no inflation factor is a unit. We identify all cases with pure point\nspectrum, and discuss the diffraction spectra of the other members of the\nfamily. Apart from the trivial Bragg peaks at the origin, they have purely\nsingular continuous diffraction.\n", "  The four point functions of chiral primary BPS operators in ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuperconformal Yang Mills are expressed in a form manifestly satisfying the\nsuperconformal Ward identities. They are subsequently expanded in terms of\nconformal partial waves. Correlation functions of two pairs of identical chiral\nprimaries, one pair having the lowest possible scale dimension, are considered.\nCrossing symmetries determine their free field value up to numeric constants.\nThe contributions from different supermultiplets to the partial wave expansion\nis analysed, and determined in the case of the free fields and compared with\nestablished results at strong and weak coupling. In the large $N$, strong\ncoupling limit, non-trivial cancellations are found between the free field\nvalues and results from supergravity. In the perturbative case values are\nobtained for the anomalous dimensions of lowest twist operators and the\ncorrection to the coupling by analysing the conformal wave expansions of\ncertain hypergeometric and logarithmic functions. Next, we attempt to count\nshortened ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM operators, beginning by constructing from\nfundamental fields the most general operators belonging to certain $SU(4)_R$\nrepresentations at low twists. The number of independent solutions to the\nconditions imposed on such operators is found via a combinatoric approach.\nGenerating functions for the number of operators with spin $\\ell=0,1,2,\\dotsc$\nare derived. Explicit values are obtained for specific $R$-symmetry\nrepresentations at low twist in various sectors of the theory. The asymptotic\nbehaviour at large twist is also considered. Finally the conformal field theory\noperator product expansion is analysed. Solutions in terms of series expansions\nare found, initially for scalar operators in two dimensions, and then more\ngenerally.\n", "  We discuss a recent result about the refractive index of the vacuum and\ncompare it with existing limits. We consider a possible connection with the\ndark sector.\n", "  Here we discuss the presence of CPT-even Lorentz violation (LV) in the\npresence of a deformed Heisenberg algebra that leads to a minimum length (ML).\nWe consider the case of a Maxwell lagrangian modified by the presence of a\n$K_{F}$ CPT-even LV theory and ML. We then derive a set of modified Maxwell\nequations in the cases of LV and ML and only ML. We verified that in the case\nof electromagnetic waves in the vacuum the presence of ML does not change the\nconsequences of LV. On the other hand, in a material media ML changes the whole\nset of equations that can lead to important effects with respect to the usual\nequations. We also considered the more general case including LV and the\nmodified equations in terms of matter fields. We then derived the refractive\nindex as a function of the matter fields depending on LV and ML, and in\nparticular we showed the behaviour of the refractive index with respect to the\nnon-commutative parameter.\n", "  We here focus on only one graphene ring and examine to which stress tensor\ncomponents the E2g and the A1g vibration mode of graphene correspond. These\nmodes are typically related with the G-peak and the D-peak, respectively, and\nare strongly related to the stress distribution along the specimen. We adopt\nthe theoretical framework of Admal and Tadmor ([1]) for the macroscopic\ndefinition of the Cauchy stress tensor and we introduce into this framework the\nE2g and the A1g as appropriate perturbations. We use these perturbations to the\nstress tensor expression and evaluate which stress tensor components are\nrelated to each vibrational mode. This approach, though qualitative in nature,\nincorporates all the main physics and reveals that E2g and A1g vibration modes\nshould be related to shear as well as axial stress components when graphene is\nat rest (i.e. no external applied loading). To bring our framework closer to\nmore concrete results, we evaluate the instantaneous Hardy stress tensor for a\npair potential which correspond to the E2g and A1g modes at rest. Our analysis\nexpands to take into account an applied external tensile field. Taking the\narmchair direction to be along the x-axis, when tension applies along the\narmchair direction, it is the axial $\\sigma$11 stress component which dominates\nover $\\sigma$12, $\\sigma$22, which are of smaller order. When tension is along\nthe zig-zag direction, it is the axial $\\sigma$22 stress component that\ndominates over $\\sigma$12, $\\sigma$11. When tension is at an arbitrary\ndirection between the armchair and the zig-zag direction, all stress components\nare of the same order and should all be taken into account even at small\nstrains.\n", "  We construct an advanced model for interacting multiple stellar systems in\nwhich we compute all trajectories with a numerical N-body integrator, namely\nthe Bulirsch--Stoer from the SWIFT package. We can then derive various\nobservables: astrometric positions, radial velocities, minima timings (TTVs),\neclipse durations, interferometric visibilities, closure phases, synthetic\nspectra, spectral-energy distribution, and even complete light curves. We use a\nmodified version of the Wilson--Devinney code for the latter, in which the\ninstantaneous true phase and inclination of the eclipsing binary are governed\nby the N-body integration. If one has all kinds of observations at disposal, a\njoint $\\chi^2$ metric and an optimisation algorithm (a~simplex or simulated\nannealing) allows to search for a global minimum and construct very robust\nmodels of stellar systems. At the same time, our N-body model is free from\nartefacts which may arise if mutual gravitational interactions among all\ncomponents are not self-consistently accounted for. Finally, we present a\nnumber of examples showing dynamical effects that can be studied with our code\nand we discuss how systematic errors may affect the results (and how to prevent\nthis from happening).\n", "  The discovery of the Planck's relation is generally regarded as the starting\npoint of quantum physics. The Planck's constant h is now regarded as one of the\nmost important universal constants. The physical nature of h, however, has not\nbeen well understood. It was originally suggested as a fitting constant to\nexplain the black-body radiation. Although Planck had proposed a theoretical\njustification of h, he was never satisfied with that. To solve this outstanding\nproblem, we used the Maxwell theory to directly calculate the energy and\nmomentum of a radiation wave packet. We found the energy of the wave packet is\nindeed proportional to its oscillation frequency. This allows us to derive the\nvalue of the Planck's constant. Furthermore, we showed that the emission and\ntransmission of a photon follows the principle of all-or-none. The \"strength\"\nof the wave packet can be characterized by zeta, which represents the\nintegrated strength of the vector potential along a transverse axis. We\nreasoned that zeta should have a fixed cut-off value for all photons. Our\nresults suggest that a wave packet can behave like a particle. This offers a\nsimple explanation to the recent satellite observations that the cosmic\nmicrowave background follows closely the black-body radiation as predicted by\nthe Planck's law.\n", "  We extend our previous analysis of $t\\bar t H, t\\bar t Z, t\\bar b W$\nproduction in $e^+e^-$ collisions within the CSM (Composite Standard Model)\nconcept of Higgs boson and top quark compositeness to the case of gluon-gluon\nand photon-photon collisions. We show that remarkable differences may indeed\nappear between the effects generated by CSM conserving and by CSM violating\nsets of form factors.\n", "  Gravity can be considered as an effective quantum field theory with reliable,\nbut limited predictions. Though the influence of gravity on gauge and other\ninteractions of elementary particles is still an open question. We calculate\nthe lowest order quantum gravity contributions to the QED beta function in an\neffective field theory picture with a momentum cutoff. We use a recently\nproposed 4 dimensional improved momentum cutoff that preserves gauge and\nLorentz symmetries. We find that there is a non-vanishing quadratic\ncontribution to the photon 2-point function but after renormalization that does\nnot lead to the running of the original coupling. We comment on corrections to\nthe other gauge interactions and Yukawa couplings of heavy fermions. We argue\nthat gravity cannot turn gauge interactions asymptotically free.\n", "  Perovskite solar cells with record power conversion efficiency are fabricated\nby alloying both hybrid and fully inorganic compounds. While the basic\nelectronic properties of the hybrid perovskites are now well understood, key\nelectronic parameters for solar cell performance, such as the exciton binding\nenergy of fully inorganic perovskites, are still unknown. By performing magneto\ntransmission measurements, we determine with high accuracy the exciton binding\nenergy and reduced mass of fully inorganic CsPbX$_3$ perovskites (X=I, Br, and\nan alloy of these). The well behaved (continuous) evolution of the band gap\nwith temperature in the range $4-270$\\,K suggests that fully inorganic\nperovskites do not undergo structural phase transitions like their hybrid\ncounterparts. The experimentally determined dielectric constants indicate that\nat low temperature, when the motion of the organic cation is frozen, the\ndielectric screening mechanism is essentially the same both for hybrid and\ninorganic perovskites, and is dominated by the relative motion of atoms within\nthe lead-halide cage.\n", "  We developed the theory of dipolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells\nirradiated by an off-resonant electromagnetic wave (dressing field). Solving\nthe Floquet problem for the dressed dipolaritons, we demonstrated that the\nfield drastically modifies all dipolaritonic properties. In particular, the\ndressing field strongly effects on terahertz emission from the considered\nsystem. The described effect paves the way for optical control of prospective\ndipolariton-based terahertz devices.\n", "  We discuss the effect of compression on Urca shells in the ocean and crust of\naccreting neutron stars, especially in superbursting sources. We find that Urca\nshells may be deviated from chemical equilibrium in neutron stars which accrete\nat several tenths of the local Eddington accretion rate. The deviation depends\non the energy threshold of the parent and daughter nuclei, the transition\nstrength, the temperature, and the local accretion rate. In a typical crust\nmodel of accreting neutron stars, the chemical departures range from a few\ntenths of kBT to tens of kBT for various Urca pairs. If the Urca shell can\nexist in crusts of accreting neutron stars, compression may enhance the net\nneutrino cooling rate by a factor of about 1 ? 2 relative to the neutrino\nemissivity in chemical equilibrium. For some cases, such as Urca pairs with\nsmall energy thresholds and/or weak transition strength, the large chemical\ndeparture may result in net heating rather than cooling, although the released\nheat can be small. Strong Urca pairs in the deep crust are hard to be deviated\neven in neutron stars accreting at the local Eddington accretion rate.\n", "  In this paper, the agent-based modeling is employed to model the effect of\nintellectual property policy at the speed of technological advancement. Every\nagent has inborn preferences towards investing their capital into independent\ntechnological development, innovation appropriation, and production. The\nrelative cost of appropriation compared to independent development is chosen as\na measure of strictness of intellectual property protection. We vary this\nparameter and look at the performance of agents with different preferences and\noverall technological progress. In general, it is found that in the specific\nsetting considered with stronger intellectual property protection leads to\nfaster progress.\n", "  We constrain the contribution of tensor-mode perturbations with free $n_t$ in\nthe models with dynamical dark energy with the barotropic equation of state\nusing Planck-2015 data on CMB anisotropy, polarization and lensing, BICEP2/Keck\nArray data on B-mode polarization, power spectrum of galaxies from WiggleZ and\nSN Ia data from the JLA compilation. We also investigate the uncertainties of\nreconstructed potential of the scalar field dark energy.\n", "  Multi-echo Chemical Shift Encoded methods for Fat-Water quantification are\ngrowing in clinical use due to their ability to estimate and correct some\nconfounding effects. State of the art CSE water-fat separation approaches rely\non a multi-peak fat spectrum with peak frequencies and relative amplitudes kept\nconstant over the entire MRI dataset. However, the latter approximation\nintroduces a systematic error in fat percentage quantification in patients\nwhere the differences in lipid chemical composition are significant, such as\nfor neuromuscular disorders, because of the spatial dependence of the peak\namplitudes. The present work aims to overcome this limitation by taking\nadvantage of an unsupervised clusterization-based approach offering a reliable\ncriterion to carry out a data-driven segmentation of the input MRI dataset into\nmultiple regions. The idea is to apply the clusterization for partitioning the\nmulti-echo MRI dataset into a finite number of clusters whose internal voxels\nexhibit similar distance metrics. For each cluster, the estimation of the fat\nspectral properties are evaluated with a self-calibration technique and finally\nthe fat-water percentages are computed via a non-linear fitting. The method is\ntested in ad-hoc and public datasets. The overall performance and results in\nterms of fitting accuracy, robustness and reproducibility are compared with\nother state-of-the-art CSE algorithms. This approach provides a more accurate\nand reproducible identification of chemical species, hence fat-water\nseparation, when compared with other calibrated and non-calibrated approaches.\n", "  In this paper we report that notions of topological protection can be applied\nto stationary configurations that are driven far from equilibrium by active,\ndissipative processes. We show this for physically two disparate cases :\nstochastic networks governed by microscopic single particle dynamics as well as\ncollections of driven, interacting particles described by coarse-grained\nhydrodynamic theory. In both cases, the presence of dissipative couplings to\nthe environment that break time reversal symmetry are crucial to ensuring\ntopologically protection. These examples constitute proof of principle that\nnotions of topological protection, established in the context of electronic and\nmechanical systems, do indeed extend generically to processes that operate out\nof equilibrium. Such topologically robust boundary modes have implications for\nboth biological and synthetic systems.\n", "  The solar corona is full of dynamic phenomena, e.g., solar flares, micro\nflares in active regions, jets in coronal holes and in the polar regions, X-ray\nbright points in quiet regions, etc. They are accompanied by interesting\nphysical processes, namely, magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration,\nshocks, waves, flows, evaporation, heating, cooling, and so on. The\nunderstandings of these phenomena and processes have been progressing\nstep-by-step with the evolution of the observation technology in EUV and X-rays\nfrom the space. But, there are fundamental questions remain unanswered, or\nhaven't even addressed so far. Our scientific objective is to understand\nunderlying physics of dynamic phenomena in the solar corona, covering some of\nthe long-standing questions in solar physics such as particle acceleration in\nflares and coronal heating. In order to achieve these science objectives, we\nidentify the imaging spectroscopy (the observations with spatial, temporal and\nenergy resolutions) in the soft X-ray range (from ~0.5 keV to ~10 keV) is a\npowerful approach for the detection and analysis of energetic events.\n", "  A mathematical model for emerging contaminants sorption in multispecies\nbiofilms, based on a continuum approach and mass conservation principles is\npresented. Diffusion of contaminants within the biofilm is described using a\ndiffusion-reaction equation. Binding sites formation and occupation are modeled\nby two systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations are mutually\nconnected through the two growth rate terms. The model is completed with a\nsystem of hyperbolic equations governing the microbial species growth within\nthe biofilm; a system of parabolic equations for substrates diffusion and\nreaction and a nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing the free\nboundary evolution. Two real special cases are modelled. The first one\ndescribes the dynamics of a free sorbent component diffusing and reacting in a\nmultispecies biofilm. In the second illustrative case, the fate of two\ndifferent contaminants has been modelled.\n", "  There are efficient many-body methods, such as the (symmetry-restored)\ngenerator coordinate method in nuclear physics, that formulate the A-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation within a set of nonorthogonal many-body states. Solving\nthe corresponding secular equation requires the evaluation of the norm matrix\nand thus the capacity to compute its entries consistently and without any phase\nambiguity. This is not always a trivial task, e.g. it remained a long-standing\nproblem for methods based on general Bogoliubov product states. While a\nsolution to this problem was found recently in Ref. [L. M. Robledo, Phys. Rev.\nC79, 021302 (2009)], the present work introduces an alternative method that can\nbe generically applied to other classes of states of interest in many-body\nphysics. The method is presently exemplified in the case of Bogoliubov states\nand numerically illustrated on the basis of a toy model.\n", "  In this study, the interaction between the gas molecules, including H2O, N2,\nCO, NO, NO2 and N2O, with the WSe2 monolayer containing a Se vacancy (denoted\nas VSe) is theoretically studied. It is found that H2O and N2 molecules are\nhighly prone to be physisorbed on the VSe surface. The presence of the Se\nvacancy should significantly enhance the sensing ability of the WSe2 monolayer\ntoward the H2O and N2 molecules. In contrast, CO and NO molecules highly prefer\nto be molecularly chemisorbed on the VSe surface with the non-oxygen atom\noccupying the Se site. Further, the exposed O atoms of the molecularly\nchemisorbed CO or NO can be reacted with the additional CO or NO molecule, to\nproduce the C-doped or N-doped WSe2 monolayer. Our electronic structure\ncalculations show that the WSe2 monolayers are p-doped by the CO and NO\nmolecules, as well as the C and N atoms. The calculated energies suggest that\nthe filling of the CO or NO molecule and the removal of the exposed O atom by\nthe additional CO or NO molecule are both energetically and dynamically\nfavorable. However, only the NO molecule and N atom doped WSe2 monolayers\nexhibit significantly improved electronic structures compared with the\ndefective WSe2 monolayer. The NO2 and N2O molecules will dissociate directly to\nform a O-doped WSe2 with a physisorbed NO or N2. After desorbing the\nphysisorbed NO or N2, the O-doped WSe2 monolayer can be obtained, for which the\ndefect levels due to the Se vacancy can be completely removed. The calculated\nenergies suggest that although the dissociation processes for NO2 and N2O\nmolecules are highly endothermic, the N2O dissociation may need to operate at\nan elevated temperature compared with the room temperature, due to its large\nenergy barrier of ~ 1 eV.\n", "  By detecting light from extrasolar planets,we can measure their compositions\nand bulk physical properties. The technologies used to make these measurements\nare still in their infancy, and a lack of self-consistency suggests that\nprevious observations have underestimated their systemic errors.We demonstrate\na statistical method, newly applied to exoplanet characterization, which uses a\nBayesian formalism to account for underestimated errorbars. We use this method\nto compare photometry of a substellar companion, GJ 758b, with custom\natmospheric models. Our method produces a probability distribution of\natmospheric model parameters including temperature, gravity, cloud model\n(fsed), and chemical abundance for GJ 758b. This distribution is less sensitive\nto highly variant data, and appropriately reflects a greater uncertainty on\nparameter fits.\n", "  Surface sensitive electric current measurements are important experimental\ntools poorly corroborated by theoretical models. We show that the\ndrift-diffusion equations offer a framework for a consistent description of\nsuch experiments. The current flow is calculated as a perturbation of an\nequilibrium solution depicting the space charge layer. We investigate the\naccumulation and inversion layers in great detail. Relying on numerical\nfindings, we identify the proper length parameter, the relationship of which\nwith the length of the space charge layer is not simple. If the length\nparameter is large enough, long-ranged modes dominate the Green's function of\nthe current equation, leading to two-dimensional currents. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the surface behavior of the currents is ruled by only a few\nparameters. This explains the fact that simplistic conductivity models have\nproven effective but makes reconstructions of conductance profiles from surface\ncurrents rather questionable.\n", "  The optimization of the size and location of Photovoltaic (PV) Distributed\nGeneration (DG) is a method for reducing distribution networks loss, cutting\ncosts for utilities, and integrating renewable energy into the power grid.\nHowever, this optimization problem is a difficult mixed continuous discrete\nproblem that is difficult to solve efficiently. Herein, we propose a novel\nSequential PVDG Placement algorithm which utilizes a Downstream Power Index\n(DPI) for PV allocation. We compare Sequential PVDG Placement results with\nthose of Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA), a memetic heuristic algorithm.\nOur algorithm demonstrates similar accuracy and drastically less computation\ntime compared to SFLA. Given its high accuracy and low computation time,\nsequential PVDG allocation algorithm may be useful for rapid online power\ndispatch, long-term planning, and microgrid operations under high penetration\nof renewable sources.\n", "  We study the problem of a cholesteric liquid crystal confined to an\nelliptical channel. The system is geometrically frustrated because the\ncholesteric prefers to adopt a uniform rate of twist deformation, but the\nelliptical domain precludes this. The frustration is resolved by deformation of\nthe layers or introduction of defects, leading to a particularly rich family of\nequilibrium configurations. To identify the solution set, we adapt and apply a\nnew family of algorithms, known as deflation methods, that iteratively modify\nthe free energy extremisation problem by removing previously known solutions. A\nsecond algorithm, deflated continuation, is used to track solution branches as\na function of the aspect ratio of the ellipse and preferred pitch of the\ncholesteric.\n", "  Stiffness of the human foot is central to its mechanical function, such as\nelastic energy storage and propulsion. Its doubly-arched structure, manifested\nas longitudinal and transverse arches, is thought to underlie the stiff nature.\nHowever, previous studies have focused solely on the longitudinal arch, and\nlittle is known about whether and how the transverse arch impacts the foot's\nstiffness. The common observation that a flexible currency bill significantly\nstiffens upon curling it transversally underlies our hypothesis that the\ntransverse arch dominates the foot's stiffness. Through human subject\nexperiments, we show that transversally reinforcing the ball of the foot by\nmeans of sports tape can increase the midfoot bending (dorsiflexion) stiffness\nby 53% on average. Such a result is possible if and only if midfoot bending is\nmechanically coupled with splaying of the distal metatarsal heads, thus\nengaging the distal transverse ligament. Using a simplified foot model, we\nelucidate a mechanism for such coupling to arise because of the transverse\narch; namely transverse curvature couples sagittal plane bending with\nstretching along the transverse direction. We therefore conclude that the\npreviously ignored distal metatarsal transverse ligaments, by way of the\ntransverse arch, likely underlie the midfoot's elastic response by an amount\ncomparable to or surpassing the plantar fascia, the windlass mechanism and\nother longitudinal tissues. Our findings impact current practice in clinical,\nsports and evolutionary biomechanics that focus solely on the longitudinal arch\nand on two-dimensional sagittal plane mechanics.\n", "  We have analyzed a nonsingular model with a variable cosmological term\nfollowing the Carvalho {\\it et al}. ansatz. The model was shown to approximate\nto the model of Freese {\\it et al}. in one direction and to the \\\"{O}zer-Taha\nin the other. We have then included the effect of viscosity in this cosmology,\nas this effect has not been considered before. The analysis showed that this\nviscous effect could be important with a present contribution to the cosmic\npressure, at most, of order of that of radiation. The model puts a stronger\nupper bound on the baryonic matter than that required by the standard model. A\nvariable gravitational and cosmological constant were then introduced in a\nscenario which conserves the energy and momentum in the presence of bulk\nviscosity. The result of the analysis reveals that various models could be\nviscous. A noteworthy result is that some nonsingular closed models evolve\nasymptotically into a singular viscous one. The considered models solve for\nmany of the standard model problems. Though the introduction of bulk viscosity\nresults in the creation of particles, this scenario conserves energy and\nmomentum. As in the standard model the entropy remains constant. We have not\nexplained the generation of bulk viscosity but some workers attributes this to\nneutrinos. Though the role of viscosity today is minute it could, nevertheless,\nhave had an important contribution at early times. We have shown that these\nmodels encompass many of the old and recently proposed models, in particular,\nBrans-Dicke, Dirac, Freese {\\it et al}., Berman, Abdel Rahman and Kalligas {\\it\net al}. models. Hence we claim that the introduction of bulk viscosity enriches\nthe adopted cosmology.\n"]}
