Our main results are\nthat, in appropriately rescaled coordinates, the Evans function associated with\nthe linearized operator about the wave (i) converges in the large-amplitude\nlimit to the Evans function for a limiting shock profile of the same equations,\nfor which internal energy vanishes at one endstate; and (ii) has no unstable\n(positive real part) zeros outside a uniform ball $|\\lambda|\\le \\Lambda$. Thus,\nthe rescaled eigenvalue ODE for the set of all shock waves, augmented with the\n(nonphysical) limiting case, form a compact family of boundary-value problems\nthat can be conveniently investigated numerically. An extensive numerical\nEvans-function study yields one-dimensional spectral stability, independent of\namplitude, for gas constant $\\gamma$ in $[1.2, 3]$ and ratio $\\nu/\\mu$ of heat\nconduction to viscosity coefficient within $[0.2,5]$ ($\\gamma\\approx 1.4$,\n$\\nu/\\mu\\approx 1.47$ for air). Other values may be treated similarly but were\nnot considered. The method of analysis extends also to the multi-dimensional\ncase, a direction that we shall pursue in a future work.\n", "  We study the empirical relation between an astronomical object's angular\nmomentum $J$ and mass $M$, $J=\\beta M^\\alpha$, the $J-M$ relation, using N-body\nsimulations. In particular, we investigate the time evolution of the $J-M$\nrelation to study how the initial power spectrum and cosmological model affect\nthis relation, and to test two popular models of its origin - mechanical\nequilibrium and tidal torque theory. We find that in the $\\Lambda$CDM model,\n$\\alpha$ starts with a value of $\\sim 1.5$ at high redshift $z$, increases\nmonotonically, and finally reaches $5/3$ near $z=0$, whereas $\\beta$ evolves\nlinearly with time in the beginning, reaches a maximum and decreases, and\nstabilizes finally. A three-regime scheme is proposed to understand this newly\nobserved picture. We show that the tidal torque theory accounts for this time\nevolution behaviour in the linear regime, whereas $\\alpha=5/3$ comes from the\nvirial equilibrium of haloes. The $J-M$ relation in the linear regime contains\nthe information of the power spectrum and cosmological model. The $J-M$\nrelations for haloes in different environments and with different merging\nhistories are also investigated to study the effects of a halo's non-linear\nevolution. An updated and more complete understanding of the $J-M$ relation is\nthus obtained.\n", "  The aim of this work is to provide further insight into the qualitative\nbehavior of mechanical systems that are well described by Lennard-Jones type\ninteractions on an atomistic scale. By means of $\\Gamma$-convergence\ntechniques, we study the continuum limit of one-dimensional chains of atoms\nwith finite range interactions of Lennard-Jones type, including the classical\nLennard-Jones potentials. So far, explicit formulae for the continuum limit\nwere only available for the case of nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour\ninteractions. In this work, we provide an explicit expression for the continuum\nlimit in the case of finite range interactions. The obtained homogenization\nformula is given by the convexification of a Cauchy-Born energy density.\n  Furthermore, we study suitably rescaled energies in which bulk and surface\ncontributions scale in the same way. The related discrete-to-continuum limit\nyields a rigorous derivation of a one-dimensional version of Griffith' fracture\nenergy and thus generalizes earlier derivations for nearest and next-to-nearest\nneighbors to the case of finite range interactions.\n  A crucial ingredient to our proofs is a novel decomposition of the energy\nthat allows for refined estimates.\n", "  A conventional general electromagnetic force definition has been widely used\nto analyze radiation forces in dielectric media in published research works.\nHowever in this paper, we would like to indicate that this conventional force\ndefinition is flawed.\n", "  We study the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions in colloidal\nsuspensions, especially between colloids immersed in a binary liquid close to\nits critical demixing point. To simulate these systems, we present a highly\nefficient cluster Monte Carlo algorithm based on geometric symmetries of the\nHamiltonian. Utilizing the principle of universality, the medium is represented\nby an Ising system while the colloids are areas of spins with fixed\norientation. Our results for the Casimir interaction potential between two\nparticles at the critical point in two dimensions perfectly agree with the\nexact predictions. However, we find that in finite systems the behavior\nstrongly depends on whether the $Z_{2}$ symmetry of the system is broken by the\nparticles. Eventually we present Monte Carlo results for the three-body Casimir\ninteraction potential and take a close look onto the case of one particle in\nthe vicinity of two adjacent particles, which can be calculated from the\ntwo-particle interaction by a conformal mapping. These results emphasize the\nfailure of the common decomposition approach for many-particle critical Casimir\ninteractions.\n", "  On the efforts of enhancing the spin orbit interaction (SOI) of graphene for\nseeking the dissipationless quantum spin Hall devices, unique Kane-Mele type\nSOI and high mobility samples are desired. However, common external decoration\noften introduces extrinsic Rashba-type SOI and simultaneous impurity\nscattering. Here we show, by the EDTA-Dy molecule dressing, the Kane-Mele type\nSOI is mimicked with even improved carrier mobility. It is evidenced by the\nsuppressed weak localization at equal carrier densities and simultaneous\nElliot-Yafet spin relaxation. The extracted spin scattering time is\nmonotonically dependent on the carrier elastic scattering time, where the\nElliot-Yafet plot gives the interaction strength of 3.3 meV. Improved quantum\nHall plateaus can be even seen after the external operation. This is attributed\nto the spin-flexural phonon coupling induced by the enhanced graphene ripples,\nas revealed by the in-plane magnetotransport measurement.\n", "  We show that the free energy in the mixed $p$-spin models of spin glasses\ndoes not superconcentrate in the presence of external field, which means that\nits variance is of the order suggested by the Poincar\\'e inequality. This\ncomplements the result of Chatterjee who showed that the free energy\nsuperconcentrates when there is no external field. For models without odd\n$p$-spin interactions for $p\\geq 3$, we prove the central limit theorem for the\nfree energy at any temperature and give an explicit formula for the limiting\nvariance. Although we only deal with the case of Ising spins, all our results\ncan be extended to the spherical models as well.\n", "  The high energy physics unfolding problem is an important statistical inverse\nproblem in data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The goal\nof unfolding is to make nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum from\nmeasurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors.\nPrevious unfolding methods use ad hoc discretization and regularization,\nresulting in confidence intervals that can have significantly lower coverage\nthan their nominal level. Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or\nstopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape\nconstraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. We quantify the\nuncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true\nspectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints\nand that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of\nfit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all\nfunctionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence\nintervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in\nthe important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling\nparticle spectra. We demonstrate the method using simulations that mimic\nunfolding the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. The\nshape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative inferences,\nwhile the conventional methods suffer from severe undercoverage.\n", "  The triton point charge radius is calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO) in pionless effective field theory ($\\mathrm{EFT}(\\not{\\!\\pi})$),\nyielding a prediction of $1.14\\pm0.19$ fm (leading order), $1.59\\pm0.08$ fm\n(next-to leading order), and $1.62\\pm0.03$ fm (NNLO) in agreement with the\ncurrent experimental extraction of $1.5978\\pm0.040$ fm [Angeli and Marinova,\nAt. Data Nucl. Data Tables 99, 69 (2013)]. The error at NNLO is due to cutoff\nvariation ($\\sim$ 1%) within a reasonable range of calculated cutoffs and from\na $\\mathrm{EFT}(\\not{\\!\\pi})$ error estimate ($\\sim$ 1.5%). In addition new\ntechniques are introduced to add perturbative corrections to bound and\nscattering state calculations for short range effective field theories, but\nwith a focus on their use in $\\mathrm{EFT}(\\not{\\!\\pi})$\n", "  Thermal transport coefficients are independent of the specific microscopic\nexpression for the energy density and current from which they can be derived\nthrough the Green-Kubo formula. We discuss this independence in terms of a kind\nof gauge invariance resulting from energy conservation and extensivity, and\ndemonstrate it numerically for a Lennard-Jones fluid, where different forms of\nthe microscopic energy density lead to different time correlation functions for\nthe heat flux, all of them, however, resulting in the same value for the\nthermal conductivity.\n", "  The functorial mathematical definition of conformal field theory was first\nformulated approximately 30 years ago. The underlying geometric category is\nbased on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with parametrized boundary\ncomponents and the sewing operation. We survey the recent and careful study of\nthese objects, which has led to significant connections with quasiconformal\nTeichmuller theory and geometric function theory.\n  In particular we propose that the natural analytic setting for conformal\nfield theory is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with so-called\nWeil-Petersson class parametrizations. A collection of rigorous analytic\nresults is advanced here as evidence. This class of parametrizations has the\nrequired regularity for CFT on one hand, and on the other hand are natural and\nof interest in their own right in geometric function theory.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) host novel states of quantum matter,\ndistinguished from trivial insulators by the presence of nontrivial conducting\nboundary states connecting the valence and conduction bulk bands. Up to date,\nall the TIs discovered experimentally rely on the presence of either time\nreversal or symmorphic mirror symmetry to protect massless Dirac-like boundary\nstates. Very recently, it has been theoretically proposed that several\nmaterials are a new type of TIs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry, where\nglide-mirror can protect novel exotic surface fermions with hourglass-shaped\ndispersion. However, an experimental confirmation of such new nonsymmorphic TI\n(NSTI) is still missing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\nreveal that such hourglass topology exists on the (010) surface of crystalline\nKHgSb while the (001) surface has no boundary state, which is fully consistent\nwith first-principles calculations. We thus experimentally demonstrate that\nKHgSb is a NSTI hosting hourglass fermions. By expanding the classification of\ntopological insulators, this discovery opens a new direction in the research of\nnonsymmorphic topological properties of materials.\n", "  In this article we calculate the dimension of the Hilbert space of Kahler\nquantization of the moduli space of vortices on a Riemann surface. This\ndimension is given by the holomorphic Euler characteristic of the quantum line\nbundle.\n", "  In this paper we introduce the spectral approach to delocalization in\ninfinite disordered systems and provide a physical interpretation in context of\nthe classical model of Edwards and Thouless. We argue that spectral analysis is\nan important contribution to localization problems since it avoids issues\nrelated to the use of boundary conditions. Applying the method to 2D and 3D\nnumerical simulations with various amount of disorder W shows that\ndelocalization occurs for W<=0.6 in 2D and for W<=5 for 3D.\n", "  A Lorentz invariant statistical model is presented for rotational\nfluctuations in the local inertial frame that arise from new quantum degrees of\nfreedom of space-time. The model assumes invariant classical causal structure,\nand a Planck information density in invariant proper time determined by the\nworld line of an observer. It describes macroscopic spacelike correlations that\nappear as observable timelike correlations in phase differences of light\npropagating on paths that begin and end on the same world line. The model\nallows an exact prediction for the autocorrelation of any interferometer time\nsignal from the shape of the light paths. Specific examples computed for\nconfigurations that approximate realistic experiments show that the model can\nbe rigorously tested, allowing a direct experimental probe of Planck scale\ndegrees of freedom.\n", "  Entropic uncertainty relations for the position and momentum within the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle are examined. Studies of this principle are\nmotivated by the existence of a minimal observable length. Then the position\nand momentum operators satisfy the modified commutation relation, for which\nmore than one algebraic representation is known. One of them is described by\nauxiliary momentum so that the momentum and coordinate wave functions are\nconnected by the Fourier transform. However, the probability density functions\nof the physically true and auxiliary momenta are different. As the\ncorresponding entropies differ, known entropic uncertainty relations are\nchanged. Using differential Shannon entropies, we give a state-dependent\nformulation with correction term. State-independent uncertainty relations are\nobtained in terms of the R\\'{e}nyi entropies and the Tsallis entropies with\nbinning. Such relations allow one to take into account a finiteness of\nmeasurement resolution.\n", "  $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, namely, a combined parity and time-reversal symmetry\ncan make non-unitary quantum walks exhibit entirely real eigenenergy. However,\nit is known that the concept of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be generalized and\nan arbitrary anti-unitary symmetry has a possibility to substitute\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. The aim of the present work is to seek such\nnon-unitary quantum walks with generalized $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by focusing\non effects of spatially random disorder which breaks $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.\nWe numerically find non-unitary quantum walks whose quasi-energy is entirely\nreal despite $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality is an inherently non-classical feature of quantum\nmechanics and manifests itself through violation of Bell inequalities for\nnonlocal games. We show that in a fairly general setting, a simple extension of\na nonlocal game can certify instead the absence of quantum nonlocality. Through\ncontraposition, our result implies that a super-classical performance for such\na game ensures that a player's output is unpredictable to the other player.\nPreviously such output unpredictability was known with respect to a third\nparty.\n", "  Recent progress in experimental techniques has made it possible to extract\ndetailed information on dynamics of carriers in a correlated electron material\nfrom its optical conductivity, $\\sigma(\\Omega, T)$. This review consists of\nthree parts, addressing the following three aspects of optical response: 1) the\nrole of momentum relaxation, 2) $\\Omega/T$ scaling of the optical conductivity\nof a Fermi-liquid metal, and 3) optical conductivity of non-Fermi-liquid\nmetals. In the first part (Sec. II), we analyze the interplay between the\ncontributions to the conductivity from normal and umklapp scattering. In the\nsecond part (Secs. III and IV), we re-visit the Gurzhi formula for the optical\nscattering rate, $1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)\\propto\\Omega^2+4\\pi^2 T^2$, and show that a\nfactor of $4\\pi^2$ is the manifestation of the \"first-Matsubara-frequency\nrule\", which states that $1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)$ must vanish upon analytic\ncontinuation to the first boson Matsubara frequency. However, recent\nexperiments show that the coefficient $b$ in the Gurzhi-like form,\n$1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)\\propto\\Omega^2+b\\pi^2 T^2$, differs significantly from $b=4$\nin most of the cases. We suggest that the discrepancy may be due to the\npresence of elastic scattering, which decreases the value of $b$ below $4$,\nwith $b=1$ corresponding to purely elastic scattering. In the third part (Sec.\nV), we consider the optical conductivity of metals near quantum phase\ntransitions to nematic and spin-density-wave (SDW) states. In the last case, we\nfocus on \"composite\" scattering processes, which give rise to a\nnon-Fermi--liquid behavior of the optical conductivity:\n$\\sigma'(\\Omega,T)\\propto \\Omega^{-1/3}$ at low frequencies and\n$\\sigma'(\\Omega,T)\\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ at higher frequencies. We also discuss\n$\\Omega/T$ scaling and show that $\\sigma'(\\Omega,T)$ in the same model scales\nin a non-Fermi-liquid way, as $T^{4/3}\\Omega^{-5/3}$.\n", "  The classical Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov approach for nucleation and\ngrowth models of diffusive phase transitions is revisited and applied to model\nthe growth of ferrite in multiphase steels. For the prediction of mechanical\nproperties of such steels, a deeper knowledge of the grain structure is\nessential. To this end, a Fokker-Planck evolution law for the volume\ndistribution of ferrite grains is developed and shown to exhibit a log-normally\ndistributed solution. Numerical parameter studies are given and confirm\nexpected properties qualitatively. As a preparation for future work on\nparameter identification, a strategy is presented for the comparison of volume\ndistributions with area distributions experimentally gained from polished\nmicrograph sections.\n", "  We report a study of the structural and magnetic behavior of the topmost\nmagnetic layer in a ferromagnet-nonmagnet (Co-Au) multilayer system. Glancing\nangle X-ray diffraction measurements performed on a series of multilayers\nshowed a gradually increasing degree of amorphization of the topmost magnetic\nlayer with increasing number of bilayers. Concurrently, the magnetic hardness\nand magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the top Co layer were found to decrease,\nas observed by magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements. This magnetic\nsoftening has been discussed in the light of Herzer's random anisotropy model.\nMicromagnetic simulations of the multilayer system also corroborated these\nobservations.\n", "  The ultralight axion with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is known as a candidate\nof dark matter. A peculiar feature of the ultralight axion is oscillating\npressure in time, which produces oscillation of gravitational potentials. Since\nthe solar system moves through the dark matter halo at the velocity of about $v\n\\sim 300 \\, \\text{km} / \\text{s} = 10^{-3}$, there exists axion wind, which\nlooks like scalar gravitational waves for us. Hence, there is a chance to\ndetect ultralight axion dark matter with a wide mass range by using laser\ninterferometer detectors. We calculate the detector signal induced by the\noscillating pressure of the ultralight axion field, which would be detected by\nfuture laser interferometer experiments. We also argue that the detector signal\ncan be enhanced due to the resonance in modified gravity theory explaining the\ndark energy.\n", "  In this paper we examine some proposals to disprove the hypothesis that the\ninteraction between mind and matter causes the collapse of the wave function,\nshowing that such proposals are fundamentally flawed. We then describe a\ngeneral experimental setup retaining the key features of the ones examined, and\nshow that even a more general case is inadequate to disprove the mind-matter\ncollapse hypothesis. Finally, we use our setup provided to argue that, under\nsome reasonable assumptions about consciousness, such hypothesis is\nunfalsifiable.\n", "  We consider the problem of deciding if a set of quantum one-qudit gates\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{U_1,\\ldots,U_n\\}$ is universal. We provide the compact form\ncriteria leading to a simple algorithm that allows deciding universality of any\ngiven set of gates in a finite number of steps. Moreover, for a non-universal\n$\\mathcal{S}$ our criteria indicate what type of gates can be added to\n$\\mathcal{S}$ to turn it into a universal set.\n", "  Optical nanofibers (ONF) of subwavelength dimensions confine light in modes\nwith a strong evanescent field that can trap, probe, and manipulate nearby\nquantum systems. To measure the evanescent field and propagating modes, and to\noptimize ONF performance, a surface probe is desirable during fabrication. We\ndemonstrate a nondestructive measurement of light propagation in ONFs by\nsampling the local evanescent field with a microfiber. This approach reveals\nthe behavior of all propagating modes, and because the modal beat lengths in\ncylindrical waveguides depend strongly on radius, simultaneously provides\nexquisite sensitivity to the ONF radius. We show that our measured spatial\nfrequencies provide a map of the average ONF radius (over a 600 micrometer\nwindow) along the 10 mm ONF waist with 40 picometer resolution and high\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The measurements agree with scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) to within SEM instrument resolution. This fast method is immune to\npolarization, intrinsic birefringence, mechanical vibrations, scattered light,\nand provides a set of constraints to protect from systematic errors in the\nmeasurements\n", "  It is known that if two players achieve a superclassical score at a nonlocal\ngame $G$, then their outputs are certifiably random - that is, regardless of\nthe strategy used by the players, a third party will not be able to perfectly\npredict their outputs (even if he were given their inputs). We prove that for\nany complete-support game $G$, there is an explicit nonzero function $F_G$ such\nthat if Alice and Bob achieve a superclassical score of $s$ at $G$, then Bob\nhas a probability of at most $1 - F_G ( s )$ of correctly guessing Alice's\noutput after the game is played. Our result implies that certifying global\nrandomness through such games must necessarily introduce local randomness.\n", "  We introduce the transverse momentum dependent fragmenting jet function\n(TMDFJF), which appears in factorization theorems for cross sections for jets\nwith an identified hadron. These are functions of $z$, the hadron's\nlongitudinal momentum fraction, and transverse momentum,\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\perp}$, relative to the jet axis. In the framework\nof Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) we derive the TMDFJF from both a\nfactorized SCET cross section and the TMD fragmentation function defined in the\nliterature. The TMDFJFs are factorized into distinct collinear and\nsoft-collinear modes by matching onto SCET$_+$. As TMD calculations contain\nrapidity divergences, both the renormalization group (RG) and rapidity\nrenormalization group (RRG) must be used to provide resummed calculations with\nnext-to-leading-logarithm prime (NLL') accuracy. We apply our formalism to the\nproduction of $J/\\psi$ within jets initiated by gluons. In this case the TMDFJF\ncan be calculated in terms of NRQCD (Non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics)\nfragmentation functions. We find that when the $J/\\psi$ carries a significant\nfraction of the jet energy, the $p_T$ and $z$ distributions differ for\ndifferent NRQCD production mechanisms. Another observable with discriminating\npower is the average angle that the $J/\\psi$ makes with the jet axis.\n", "  In this letter we apply the Gauss--Bonnet theorem (GB) to calculate the\ndeflection angle by a quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in the weak\nlimit approximation. In particular we calculate the light deflection by two\ntypes of quantum corrected black holes: the renormalization group improved\nSchwarzschild solution and the quantum corrected Schwarzschild solution in\nBohmian quantum mechanics. We start from the corresponding optical metrics to\nuse then the GB theorem and calculate the Gaussian curvature in both cases. We\ncalculate the leading terms of the deflection angle and show that quantum\ncorrections modifies the deflection angle in both solutions. Finally by\nperforming geodesics calculations we show that GB method gives exact results in\nleading order terms.\n", "  We investigate the influence of massive photons on the evolution of the\nexpanding universe. Two particular models for generalized electrodynamics are\nconsidered, namely de Broglie-Proca and Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. We\nobtain the equation of state (EOS) $P=P(\\varepsilon)$ for each case using\ndispersion relations derived from both theories. The EOS are inputted into the\nFriedmann equations of a homogeneous and isotropic space-time to determine the\ncosmic scale factor $a(t)$. It is shown that the photon non-null mass does not\nsignificantly alter the result $a\\propto t^{1/2}$ valid for a massless photon\ngas; this is true either in de Broglie-Proca's case (where the photon mass $m$\nis extremely small) or in Bopp-Podolsky theory (for which $m$ is extremely\nlarge).\n", "  The classical nucleation theory (CNT) concept of a nucleus as a fragment of\nthe bulk new phase fails for nanosized nuclei. An extension of CNT taking into\naccount the properties of the transition region between coexisting bulk phases\nis proposed. For this purpose, the finite-thickness layer method which is an\nalternative to Gibbs one is used; the transition region is considered as a\nseparate (surface) phase. An equation for the nucleation work is derived which\nis basic for the multivariable theory of nucleation. Equations of equilibrium\nfollowing from it are employed for considering the dependences of surface\ntension on radius and temperature for droplets; Kelvin formula for the\nequilibrium vapor pressure is extended to small radii. It is shown that the\nratio of the isothermal nucleation rate to that of CNT can achieve several\norders of magnitude due to the curvature effect (the dependence of surface\ntension on curvature). The analysis of different dependences of the Tolman\nlength on radius, d(R), suggests that (i) the curvature effect is determined by\nthe value of d(0) which is positive and relates to the limiting (spinodal)\nvapor supersaturation and (ii) the function d(R) decreases with increasing\nradius; at the same time, this effect is weakly sensitive to the form of the\nfunction d(R) and its asymptotic value. The second differential of the work is\nobtained as a quadratic form with contributions from both the bulk and surface\nphases. It is used for calculating the fluctuations of surface layer parameters\nsuch as the surface tension and the specific surface area as well as the\nfluctuations of nucleus parameters.\n", "  In organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, the open circuit voltage\n($V_\\mathrm{oc}$) suffers from an ultra-high loss at low temperatures. In this\nwork we investigate the origin of the loss through calculating the\n$V_\\mathrm{oc}-T$ plots with the device model method systematically and\ncomparing it with experimentally observed ones. When the energetic disorder is\nincorporated into the model by considering the disorder-suppressed and\ntemperature-dependent charge carrier mobilities, it is found that for\nnonselective contacts the $V_\\mathrm{oc}$ reduces drastically under the low\ntemperature regime, while for selective contacts the $V_\\mathrm{oc}$ keeps\nincreasing with the decreasing temperature. The main reason is revealed that as\nthe temperature decreases, the reduced mobilities give rise to low charge\nextraction efficiency and small bimolecular recombination rate for the\nphotogenerated charge carriers, so that in the former case they can be\nextracted from the wrong electrode to form a leakage current which counteracts\nthe photocurrent and increases quickly with voltage, leading to the anomalous\nreduction of $V_\\mathrm{oc}$. In addition, it is revealed that the charge\ngeneration rate is slow-varying with temperature and does not induce\nsignificant $V_\\mathrm{oc}$ loss. This work also provides a comprehensive\npicture for the $V_\\mathrm{oc}$ behavior under varying device working\nconditions.\n", "  The power spectrum of interface fluctuations in the $(1+1)$-dimensional\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class is studied both experimentally and\nnumerically. The $1/f^\\alpha$-type spectrum is found and characterized through\na set of \"critical exponents\" for the power spectrum. The recently formulated\n\"aging Wiener-Khinchin theorem\" accounts for the observed exponents.\nInterestingly, the $1/f^\\alpha$ spectrum in the KPZ class turns out to contain\ninformation on a universal distribution function characterizing the asymptotic\nstate of the KPZ interfaces, namely the Baik-Rains universal variance. It is\nindeed observed in the presented data, both experimental and numerical, and for\nboth circular and flat interfaces, in the long time limit.\n", "  High-precision measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration are presented of\ninclusive $W^+\\to\\ell^+\\nu$, $W^-\\to\\ell^-\\bar{\\nu}$ and\n$Z/\\gamma^*\\to\\ell\\ell$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$) Drell-Yan production cross sections at\nthe LHC. The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$\nTeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$. Differential $W^+$ and\n$W^-$ cross sections are measured in a lepton pseudorapidity range\n$|\\eta_{\\ell}| = 2.5$. Differential $Z/\\gamma^*$ cross sections are measured as\na function of the absolute dilepton rapidity, for $|y_{\\ell\\ell}| < 3.6$, for\nthree intervals of dilepton mass, $m_{\\ell\\ell}$, extending from 46 to 150 GeV.\nThe integrated and differential electron- and muon-channel cross sections are\ncombined and compared to theoretical predictions using recent sets of parton\ndistribution functions. The data, together with the final inclusive $e^{\\pm}p$\nscattering cross-section data from H1 and ZEUS, are interpreted in a\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order QCD analysis, and a new set of parton\ndistribution functions, ATLAS-epWZ16, is obtained. The ratio of\nstrange-to-light sea-quark densities in the proton is determined more\naccurately than in previous determinations based on collider data only, and is\nestablished to be close to unity in the sensitivity range of the data. A new\nmeasurement of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is also provided.\n", "  The SOL2001-12-26 moderate solar eruptive event (GOES importance M7.1,\nmicrowaves up to 4000 sfu at 9.4 GHz, CME speed 1446 km/s) produced strong\nfluxes of solar energetic particles and ground-level enhancement of cosmic-ray\nintensity (GLE63). To find a possible reason for the atypically high proton\noutcome of this event, we study multi-wavelength images and dynamic radio\nspectra and quantitatively reconcile the findings with each other. An\nadditional eruption probably occurred in the same active region about half an\nhour before the main eruption. The latter produced two blast-wave-like shocks\nduring the impulsive phase. The two shock waves eventually merged around the\nradial direction into a single shock traced up to $25R_\\odot$ as a halo ahead\nof the expanding CME body, in agreement with an interplanetary Type II event\nrecorded by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) experiment on the\nWind spacecraft. The shape and kinematics of the halo indicate an intermediate\nregime of the shock between the blast wave and bow shock at these distances.\nThe results show that i) the shock wave appeared during the flare rise and\ncould accelerate particles earlier than usually assumed; ii) the particle event\ncould be amplified by the preceding eruption, which stretched closed structures\nabove the developing CME, facilitated its lift-off and escape of\nflare-accelerated particles, enabled a higher CME speed and stronger shock\nahead; iii) escape of flare-accelerated particles could be additionally\nfacilitated by reconnection of the flux rope, where they were trapped, with a\nlarge coronal hole; iv) the first eruption supplied a rich seed population\naccelerated by a trailing shock wave.\n", "  It is known that an ensemble of magnons, quanta of spin waves, can be\nprepared as a Bose gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles with conservation\nof the particle number. Furthermore, the thermalization of the overpopulated\nmagnon gas can lead to the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate at the\nbottom of a spin-wave spectrum. However, magnon-phonon scattering processes can\nsignificantly modify this scenario and new quasiparticles are formed -\nmagneto-elastic bosons. Our observations of a parametrically populated magnon\ngas in a single-crystal film of Yttrium Iron Garnet by means of\nwavevector-resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy including\nmagneto-elastic coupling resulted in the discovery of a novel condensation\nphenomenon: A spontaneous accumulation of hybrid magneto-elastic bosonic\nquasiparticles at the intersection of the lowest magnon mode and a transversal\nacoustic wave.\n", "  Motivated by a recent finding of an exact solution of the relativistic\nBoltzmann equation in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, we implement this\nmetric into the newly developed transport approach Simulating Many Accelerated\nStrongly-interacting Hadrons (SMASH). We study the numerical solution of the\ntransport equation and compare it to this exact solution for massless\nparticles. We also compare a different initial condition, for which the\ntransport equation can be independently solved numerically. Very nice agreement\nis observed in both cases. Having passed these checks for the SMASH code, we\nstudy a gas of massive particles within the same spacetime, where the particle\ndecoupling is forced by the Hubble expansion. In this simple scenario we\npresent an analysis of the freeze-out times, as function of the masses and\ncross sections of the particles. The results might be of interest for their\npotential application to relativistic heavy-ion collisions, for the\ncharacterization of the freeze-out process in terms of hadron properties.\n", "  The representation theory of a conformal net is a unitary modular tensor\ncategory. It is captured by the bimodule category of the Jones-Wassermann\nsubfactor. In this paper, we construct multi-interval Jones-Wassermann\nsubfactors for unitary modular tensor categories. We prove that these\nsubfactors are self-dual. It generalizes and categorifies the self-duality of\nfinite abelian groups and we call it modular self-duality.\n", "  We study $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ form factors using QCD light-cone sum rules with\n$B$-meson distribution amplitudes. These form factors describe the semileptonic\ndecay $B\\to \\pi\\pi \\ell\\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}$, and constitute an essential input in\n$B\\to \\pi\\pi \\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $B\\to \\pi\\pi\\pi$ decays. We employ the\ncorrelation functions where a dipion isospin-one state is interpolated by the\nvector light-quark current. We obtain sum rules where convolutions of the\n$P$-wave $\\bar{B}^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^0$ form factors with the time-like pion vector\nform factor are related to universal $B$-meson distribution amplitudes. These\nsum rules are valid in the kinematic regime where the dipion state has a large\nenergy and a low invariant mass, and reproduce analytically the known\nlight-cone sum rules for $B\\to \\rho$ form factors in the limit of\n$\\rho$-dominance with zero width, thus providing a systematics for\nso-far-unaccounted corrections to $B\\to\\rho$ transitions. Using data for the\npion vector form factor, we estimate finite width-effects and the contribution\nof excited $\\rho$-resonances to the $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ form factors. We find that\nthese contributions amount up to $\\sim 20\\%$ in the small dipion mass region\nwhere they can be effectively regarded as a nonresonant ($P$-wave) background\nto the $B\\to\\rho$ transition.\n", "  Chip-scale integrated light sources are a crucial component in a broad range\nof photonics applications. III-V semiconductor nanowire emitters have gained\nattention as a fascinating approach due to their superior material properties,\nextremely compact size, and the capability to grow directly on\nlattice-mismatched silicon substrates. Although there have been remarkable\nadvances in nanowire-based emitters, their practical applications are still in\nthe early stages due to the difficulties in integrating nanowire emitters with\nphotonic integrated circuits (PICs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time\noptically pumped III-V nanowire array lasers monolithically integrated on\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Selective-area growth of purely\nsingle-crystalline InGaAs/InGaP core/shell nanowires on an SOI substrate\nenables the nanowire array to form a photonic crystal nanobeam cavity with\nsuperior optical and structural properties, resulting in the laser to operate\nat room temperature. We also show that the nanowire array lasers are\neffectively coupled with SOI waveguides by employing nanoepitaxy on a\npre-patterned SOI platform. These results represent a new platform for\nultra-compact and energy-efficient optical links, and unambiguously point the\nway toward practical and functional nanowire lasers.\n", "  A brane construction of an integrable lattice model is proposed. The model is\ncomposed of Belavin's R-matrix, Felder's dynamical R-matrix, the\nBazhanov-Sergeev-Derkachov-Spiridonov R-operator and some intertwining\noperators. This construction implies that a family of surface defects act on\nsupersymmetric indices of four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric\nfield theories as transfer matrices related to elliptic quantum groups.\n", "  We introduce an in silico model for the initial spread of an aberrant\nphenotype with Warburg-like overflow metabolism within a healthy homeostatic\ntissue in contact with a nutrient reservoir (the blood), aimed at\ncharacterizing the role of the microenvironment for aberrant growth. Accounting\nfor cellular metabolic activity, competition for nutrients, spatial diffusion\nand their feedbacks on aberrant replication and death rates, we obtain a phase\nportrait where distinct asymptotic whole-tissue states are found upon varying\nthe tissue-blood turnover rate and the level of blood-borne primary nutrient.\nOver a broad range of parameters, the spreading dynamics is bistable as random\nfluctuations can impact the final state of the tissue. Such a behaviour turns\nout to be linked to the re-cycling of overflow products by non-aberrant cells.\nQuantitative insight on the overall emerging picture is provided by a spatially\nhomogeneous version of the model.\n", "  We study the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal in $3-\\epsilon$ space\ndimensions by extending the earlier one-loop analysis [Sur and Lee, Phys. Rev.\nB 91, 125136 (2015)] to higher-loop orders. We show that the\n$\\epsilon$-expansion is not organized by the standard loop expansion, and a\ntwo-loop graph becomes as important as one-loop graphs due to an infrared\nsingularity caused by an emergent quasilocality. This qualitatively changes the\nnature of the infrared (IR) fixed point, and the $\\epsilon$-expansion is\ncontrolled only after the two-loop effect is taken into account. Furthermore,\nwe show that a ratio between velocities emerges as a small parameter, which\nsuppresses a large class of diagrams. We show that the critical exponents do\nnot receive corrections beyond the linear order in $\\epsilon$ in the limit that\nthe ratio of velocities vanishes. The $\\epsilon$-expansion gives critical\nexponents which are consistent with the exact solution obtained in $0 <\n\\epsilon \\leq 1$.\n", "  We study vector portal dark matter models where the mediator couples only to\nleptons. In spite of the lack of tree-level couplings to colored states,\nradiative effects generate interactions with quark fields that could give rise\nto a signal in current and future experiments. We identify such experimental\nsignatures: scattering of nuclei in dark matter direct detection; resonant\nproduction of lepton-antilepton pairs at the Large Hadron Collider; and\nhadronic final states in dark matter indirect searches. Furthermore, radiative\neffects also generate an irreducible mass mixing between the vector mediator\nand the $Z$ boson, severely bounded by ElectroWeak Precision Tests. We use\ncurrent experimental results to put bounds on this class of models, accounting\nfor both radiatively induced and tree-level processes. Remarkably, the former\noften overwhelm the latter.\n", "  We used two novel approaches to produce sub-wavelength structure (SWS)\nanti-reflection coatings (ARC) on silicon for the millimeter and sub-millimeter\n(MSM) wave band: picosecond laser ablation and dicing with beveled saws. We\nproduced pyramidal structures with both techniques. The diced sample, machined\non only one side, had pitch and height of 350 $\\mu$m and 972 $\\mu$m. The two\nlaser ablated samples had pitch of 180 $\\mu$m and heights of 720 $\\mu$m and 580\n$\\mu$m; only one of these samples was ablated on both sides. We present\nmeasurements of shape and optical performance as well as comparisons to the\noptical performance predicted using finite element analysis and rigorous\ncoupled wave analysis. By extending the measured performance of the one-sided\ndiced sample to the two-sided case, we demonstrate 25 % band averaged\nreflectance of less than 5 % over a bandwidth of 97 % centered on 170 GHz.\nUsing the two-sided laser ablation sample, we demonstrate reflectance less than\n5 % over 83 % bandwidth centered on 346 GHz.\n", "  Macroscopic friction coefficients observed in experiments are the result of\nvarious types of complex multiscale interactions between sliding surfaces.\nTherefore, there are several ways to modify them depending on the physical\nphenomena involved. Recently, it has been demonstrated that surface structure,\ne.g. artificial patterning, can be used to tune frictional properties. In this\npaper, we show how the global friction coefficients can also be manipulated\nusing composite surfaces with varying roughness or stiffness values, i.e. by\ncombining geometrical features with the modification of local friction\ncoefficients or stiffnesses. We show that a remarkable reduction of static\nfriction can be achieved by introducing hierarchical arrangements of varying\nlocal roughness values, or by introducing controlled material stiffness\nvariations.\n", "  We measure the color and stellar mass dependence of clustering in\nspectroscopic galaxies at $0.6 < z < 0.65$ using data from the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey component of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\ngreatly increase the statistical precision of our clustering measurements by\nusing the cross-correlation of 66,657 spectroscopic galaxies to a sample of 6.6\nmillion fainter photometric galaxies. The clustering amplitude $w(R)$ is\nmeasured as the ratio of the mean excess number of photometric galaxies found\nwithin a specified radius annulus around a spectroscopic galaxy to that from a\nrandom photometric galaxy distribution. We recover many of the familiar trends\nat high signal-to-noise ratio. We find the ratio of the clustering amplitudes\nof red and blue massive galaxies to be $w_\\text{red}/w_\\text{blue} = 1.92 \\pm\n0.11$ in our smallest annulus of 75-125 kpc. At our largest radii (2-4 Mpc), we\nfind $w_\\text{red}/w_\\text{blue} = 1.24 \\pm 0.05$. Red galaxies therefore have\ndenser environments than their blue counterparts at $z \\sim 0.625$, and this\neffect increases with decreasing radius. Irrespective of color, we find that\n$w(R)$ does not obey a simple power-law relation with radius, showing a dip\naround 1 Mpc. Holding stellar mass fixed, we find a clear differentiation\nbetween clustering in red and blue galaxies, showing that clustering is not\nsolely determined by stellar mass. Holding color fixed, we find that clustering\nincreases with stellar mass, especially for red galaxies at small scales (more\nthan a factor of 2 effect over 0.75 dex in stellar mass).\n", "  Patterning graphene into various mesoscopic devices such as nanoribbons,\nquantum dots, etc. by lithographic techniques has enabled the guiding and\nmanipulation of graphene's Dirac-type charge carriers. Graphene, with\nwell-defined strain patterns, holds promise of similarly rich physics while\navoiding the problems created by the hard to control edge configuration of\nlithographically prepared devices. To engineer the properties of graphene via\nmechanical deformation, versatile new techniques are needed to pattern strain\nprofiles in a controlled manner. Here we present a process by which strain can\nbe created in substrate supported graphene layers. Our atomic force\nmicroscope-based technique opens up new possibilities in tailoring the\nproperties of graphene using mechanical strain.\n", "  Measurements of the production cross section of a $Z$ boson in association\nwith jets in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV are presented,\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.16 fb$^{-1}$\ncollected by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015.\nInclusive and differential cross sections are measured for events containing a\n$Z$ boson decaying to electrons or muons and produced in association with up to\nseven jets with $p_T > 30$ GeV and $|y| <2.5$. Predictions from different Monte\nCarlo generators based on leading-order and next-to-leading-order matrix\nelements for up to two additional partons interfaced with parton shower and\nfixed-order predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading\norder are compared with the measured cross sections. Good agreement within the\nuncertainties is observed for most of the modelled quantities, in particular\nwith the generators which use next-to-leading-order matrix elements and the\nmore recent next-to-next-to-leading-order fixed-order predictions.\n", "  We propose that the intrinsic geometry of holographic screens should be\ndescribed by the Newton-Cartan geometry. As a test of this proposal, we show\nthat the evolution equations of the screen can be written in a covariant form\nin terms of a stress tensor, an energy current, and a momentum one-form. We\nderive the expressions for the stress tensor, energy density, and momentum\none-form using Brown-York action formalism.\n", "  Experimental measurements of the ratios $R(D^{(*)})\\equiv\\frac{\\Gamma(B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu)}{\\Gamma(B\\to D^{(*)}\\ell\\nu)}$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$) show a\n$3.9\\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model prediction. In the absence of\nlight right-handed neutrinos, a new physics contribution to $b\\to c\\tau\\nu$\ndecays necessarily modifies also $b\\bar b\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and/or $c\\bar\nc\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ transitions. These contributions lead to violation of lepton\nflavor universality in, respectively, $\\Upsilon$ and $\\psi$ leptonic decays. We\nanalyze the constraints resulting from measurements of the leptonic\nvector-meson decays on solutions to the $R(D^{(*)})$ puzzle. Available data\nfrom BaBar and Belle can already disfavor some of the new physics explanations\nof this anomaly. Further discrimination can be made by measuring\n$\\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\\to\\tau\\tau$ in the upcoming Belle II experiment.\n", "  We propose a new approach to initialize the hydrodynamic fields such as\nenergy density distributions and four flow velocity fields in hydrodynamic\nmodeling of high-energy nuclear collisions at the collider energies. Instead of\nmatching the energy-momentum tensor or putting the initial conditions of\nquark-gluon fluids at a fixed initial time, we utilize a framework of\nrelativistic hydrodynamic equations with source terms to describe the initial\nstage. Putting the energy and momentum loss rate of the initial partons into\nthe source terms, we obtain hydrodynamic initial conditions dynamically. The\nresultant initial profile of the quark-gluon fluid looks highly bumpy as seen\nin the conventional event-by-event initial conditions. In addition, initial\nrandom flow velocity fields also are generated as a consequence of momentum\ndeposition from the initial partons. We regard the partons that survive after\nthe dynamical initialization process as the mini-jets and find sizable effects\nof both mini-jet propagation in the quark-gluon fluids and initial random\ntransverse flow on the final momentum spectra and anisotropic flow observables.\nWe perform event-by-event $(3+1)$-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic simulations\nwith this new framework that enables us to describe the hydrodynamic bulk\ncollectivity, parton energy loss, and interplay among them in a unified manner.\n", "  In three-dimensional noncentrosymmetric materials two-fold screw rotation\nsymmetry forces electron's energy bands to have Weyl points at which two bands\ntouch. This is illustrated for space groups No. 19 ($P2_12_12_1$) and No. 198\n($P2_13$), which have three orthogonal screw rotation axes. In the case of\nspace groups No. 61 ($Pbca$) and No. 205 ($P$a-3) that have extra inversion\nsymmetry, Weyl points are promoted to four-fold degenerate line nodes in\nglide-invariant planes. The three-fold rotation symmetry present in the space\ngroups No. 198 and No. 205 allows Weyl and Dirac points, respectively, to\nappear along its rotation axes in the Brillouin zone and generates four-fold\nand six-fold degeneracy at the $\\Gamma$ point and R point, respectively.\n", "  In this work, we obtain uncharged\\charged Kiselev-like black holes as a new\nclass of black hole solutions surrounded by perfect fluid in the context of\nRastall theory. Then, we study the specific cases of the uncharged\\charged\nblack holes surrounded by regular matter like dust and radiation, or exotic\nmatter like quintessence, cosmological constant and phantom fields. By\ncomparing the Kiselev-like black hole solutions in Rastall theory with the\nKiselev black hole solutions in GR, we find an effective perfect fluid\nbehaviour for the black hole's surrounding field. It is shown that the\ncorresponding effective perfect fluid has interesting characteristic features\ndepending on the different ranges of the parameters in Rastall theory. For\ninstance, Kiselev-like black holes surrounded by regular matter in Rastall\ntheory may be considered as Kiselev black holes surrounded by exotic matter in\nGR, or Kiselev-like black holes surrounded by exotic matter in Rastall theory\nmay be considered as Kiselev black holes surrounded by regular matter in GR.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new method to generate arbitrary\nFock-state superpositions in a superconducting quantum circuit, where a qubit\nis dispersively coupled to a microwave cavity mode without the need of\nfine-frequency tuning. Here the qubit is used to conditionally modulate the\nprobability amplitudes of the Fock state components of a coherent state to\nthose of the desired superposition state, instead of pumping photons one by one\ninto the cavity as in previous schemes. Our method does not require the\nadjustment of the qubit frequency during the cavity state preparation, and is\nmore robust to noise and accumulation of experimental errors compared to\nprevious ones. Using the method, we experimentally generate high-fidelity phase\neigenstates under various Hilbert-space dimensions and squeezed states, which\nare useful for quantum walk and high-precision measurements.\n", "  We reevaluate the necessity of $W_R$ gauge bosons being kinematically\naccessible to test the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) at hadron colliders.\nIn the limit that $W_R$ are too heavy, resonant production of sub-TeV Majorana\nneutrinos $N$ can still proceed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) via the\nprocess $pp\\rightarrow W_R^{\\pm *}\\rightarrow N \\ell^\\pm \\to \\ell^\\pm \\ell^\\pm\n+nj $ if mediated by a far off-shell $W_R$. Traditional searches strategies are\ninsensitive to this regime as they rely on momenta of final states scaling with\nTeV-scale $M_{W_R}$. For such situations, the process is actually kinematically\nand topologically identical to the direct production (DP) process\n$pp\\rightarrow W_{\\rm SM}^{\\pm *} \\rightarrow N \\ell^\\pm \\rightarrow \\ell^\\pm\n\\ell^\\pm +nj$. In this context, we reinterpret $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV LHC constraints\non DP rates for the minimal LRSM. For $m_N = 200-500$ GeV and right-left\ncoupling ratio $\\kappa_R = g_R/g_L$, we find $(M_{W_R} / \\kappa_R) > {1.1-1.8}$\nTeV at 95\\% CLs. Expected sensitivities to DP at 14 (100) TeV are also recast:\nwith $\\mathcal{L}=1~(10)~\\text{ab}^{-1}$, one can probe $(M_{W_R} / \\kappa_R) <\n{7.9-8.9~(14-40)}$ TeV for $m_N = {100 - 700~(1200)}$ GeV. Findings in terms of\ngauge invariant dimension-six operators with heavy $N$ are also reported.\n", "  We fit the unfolded data of $\\bar{B}^0\\rightarrow D^{*+} \\ell \\overline{\\nu}$\nfrom the Belle experiment, where $\\ell \\equiv e, \\mu$, using a method\nindependent of heavy quark symmetry to extrapolate to zero-recoil and extract\nthe value of $|V_{cb}|$. This results in $|V_{cb}| =\n(41.9^{~+2.0}_{~-1.9})\\times 10^{-3}$, which is robust to changes in the\ntheoretical inputs and very consistent with the value extracted from inclusive\nsemileptonic $B$ decays.\n", "  The evanescent field outside an optical nanofiber (ONF) can create optical\ntraps for neutral atoms. We present a non-destructive method to characterize\nsuch trapping potentials. An off-resonance linearly polarized probe beam that\npropagates through the ONF experiences a slow axis of polarization produced by\ntrapped atoms on opposite sides along the ONF. The transverse atomic motion is\nimprinted onto the probe polarization through the changing atomic index of of\nrefraction. By applying a transient impulse, we measure a time-dependent\npolarization rotation of the probe beam that provides both a rapid and\nnon-destructive measurement of the optical trapping frequencies.\n", "  Organic-inorganic halide perovskites present a number of challenges for\nfirst-principles atomistic materials modelling. These `plastic crystals'\nfeature dynamic processes across multiple length-scales and time-scales, which\ninclude: (i) transport of slow ions and fast electrons; (ii) highly anharmonic\nlattice dynamics with short phonon lifetimes; (iii) local symmetry breaking of\nthe average crystallographic space group; (iv) strong relativistic (spin-orbit\ncoupling) effects on the electronic band structure; (v) thermodynamic\nmetastability and rapid chemical breakdown. These issues, which affect the\noperation of solar cells, are outlined in this perspective. We also discuss\ngeneral guidelines for performing quantitative and predictive simulations of\nthese materials, which are relevant to metal-organic frameworks and other\nhybrid semiconducting, dielectric and ferroelectric compounds.\n", "  The development of optical nanofibers (ONF) and the study and control of\ntheir optical properties when coupling atoms to their electromagnetic modes has\nopened new possibilities for their use in quantum optics and quantum\ninformation science. These ONFs offer tight optical mode confinement (less than\nthe wavelength of light) and diffraction-free propagation. The small cross\nsection of the transverse field allows probing of linear and non-linear\nspectroscopic features of atoms with exquisitely low power. The cooperativity\n-- the figure of merit in many quantum optics and quantum information systems\n-- tends to be large even for a single atom in the mode of an ONF, as it is\nproportional to the ratio of the atomic cross section to the electromagnetic\nmode cross section. ONFs offer a natural bus for information and for\ninter-atomic coupling through the tightly-confined modes, which opens the\npossibility of one-dimensional many-body physics and interesting quantum\ninterconnection applications. The presence of the ONF modifies the vacuum\nfield, affecting the spontaneous emission rates of atoms in its vicinity. The\nhigh gradients in the radial intensity naturally provide the potential for\ntrapping atoms around the ONF, allowing the creation of one-dimensional arrays\nof atoms. The same radial gradient in the transverse direction of the field is\nresponsible for the existence of a large longitudinal component that introduces\nthe possibility of spin-orbit coupling of the light and the atom, enabling the\nexploration of chiral quantum optics.\n", "  Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY) are two-dimensional one-atom-thick carbon\nallotropes highly considered to substitute graphene in electronic applications\nbecause of the prediction of non null band-gap. There are seven types of GY\nstructures not yet fully investigated in literature. In this work, by means of\nclassical molecular dynamics simulations, the Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio\nand linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of all originally proposed seven\ntypes of GYs and corresponding GDYs are calculated. The dependence of these\nproperties with the density of the structure is investigated for the first\ntime. Quadratic increasing of the TEC of GY and GDY structures with density was\nfound. The elastic modulus of GYs and GDYs were shown to be more sensitive to\ntheir density than general porous materials. In particular, non-symmetric\nstructures are much softer along the armchair direction than along zigzag\ndirection, implying that the elasticity along armchair direction of GY and GDY\nstructures are similar to that of porous gels materials. Values larger than\nunity were found for the Poisson's ratio of some non-symmetric GYs and GDYs. A\nsimple honeycomb mechanical model is shown to capture the observed values of\nPoisson's ratio of GYs and GDYs.\n", "  We study renormalization in a scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere. The\ntheory is realized by a matrix model, where the matrix size plays the role of a\nUV cutoff. We define correlation functions by using the Berezin symbol\nidentified with a field and calculate them nonperturbatively by Monte Carlo\nsimulation. We find that the 2-point and 4-point functions are made independent\nof the matrix size by tuning a parameter and performing a wave function\nrenormalization. The results strongly suggest that the theory is\nnonperturbatively renormalizable in the ordinary sense.\n", "  Scaling laws for the propulsive performance of rigid foils undergoing\noscillatory heaving and pitching motions are presented. Water tunnel\nexperiments on a nominally two-dimensional flow validate the scaling laws, with\nthe scaled data for thrust, power, and efficiency all showing excellent\ncollapse. The analysis indicates that the behaviour of the foils depends on\nboth Strouhal number and reduced frequency, but for motions where the viscous\ndrag is small the thrust closely follows a linear dependence on reduced\nfrequency. The scaling laws are also shown to be consistent with biological\ndata on swimming aquatic animals.\n", "  Successful computer studies of glass-forming materials need to overcome both\nthe natural tendency to structural ordering and the dramatic increase of\nrelaxation times at low temperatures. We present a comprehensive analysis of\neleven glass-forming models to demonstrate that both challenges can be\nefficiently tackled using carefully designed models of size polydisperse\nsupercooled liquids together with an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm where\ntranslational particle displacements are complemented by swaps of particle\npairs. We study a broad range of size polydispersities, using both discrete and\ncontinuous mixtures, and we systematically investigate the role of particle\nsoftness, attractivity and non-additivity of the interactions. Each system is\ncharacterized by its robustness against structural ordering and by the\nefficiency of the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. We show that the combined\noptimisation of the potential's softness, polydispersity and non-additivity\nleads to novel computer models with excellent glass-forming ability. For such\nmodels, we achieve over ten orders of magnitude gain in the equilibration\ntimescale using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm, thus paving the way to\ncomputational studies of static and thermodynamic properties under experimental\nconditions. In addition, we provide microscopic insights into the performance\nof the swap algorithm which should help optimizing models and algorithms even\nfurther.\n", "  $\\mathrm{La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_4}$/$\\mathrm{La_2CuO_4}$ (LSCO15/LCO) bilayers\nwith a precisely controlled thickness of N unit cells (UCs) of the former and M\nUCs of the latter ([LSCO15\\_N/LCO\\_M]) were grown on (001)-oriented {\\slao}\n(SLAO) substrates with pulsed laser deposition (PLD). X-ray diffraction and\nreciprocal space map (RSM) studies confirmed the epitaxial growth of the\nbilayers and showed that a [LSCO15\\_2/LCO\\_2] bilayer is fully strained,\nwhereas a [LSCO15\\_2/LCO\\_7] bilayer is already partially relaxed. The\n\\textit{in situ} monitoring of the growth with reflection high energy electron\ndiffraction (RHEED) revealed that the gas environment during deposition has a\nsurprisingly strong effect on the growth mode and thus on the amount of\ndisorder in the first UC of LSCO15 (or the first two monolayers of LSCO15\ncontaining one $\\mathrm{CuO_2}$ plane each). For samples grown in pure\n$\\mathrm{N_2O}$ gas (growth type-B), the first LSCO15 UC next to the SLAO\nsubstrate is strongly disordered. This disorder is strongly reduced if the\ngrowth is performed in a mixture of $\\mathrm{N_2O}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$ gas\n(growth type-A). Electric transport measurements confirmed that the first UC of\nLSCO15 next to the SLAO substrate is highly resistive and shows no sign of\nsuperconductivity for growth type-B, whereas it is superconducting for growth\ntype-A. Furthermore, we found, rather surprisingly, that the conductivity of\nthe LSCO15 UC next to the LCO capping layer strongly depends on the thickness\nof the latter. A LCO capping layer with 7~UCs leads to a strong localization of\nthe charge carriers in the adjacent LSCO15 UC and suppresses superconductivity.\nThe magneto-transport data suggest a similarity with the case of weakly hole\ndoped LSCO single crystals that are in a so-called {\"{cluster-spin-glass\nstate}\"}\n", "  We present a microscopic study on current generation in graphene in response\nto an electric field. While scattering is generally considered to reduce the\ncurrent, we reveal that in graphene Auger processes give rise to a current\nenhancement via a phenomenon we denote dark carrier multiplication. Based on a\nmicroscopic approach, we show that, if other scattering channels are absent,\nthis prevents the carrier distribution to reach a stationary value. Taking into\naccount scattering with phonons a finite current is restored, however its value\nexceeds the stationary current without scattering.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase is a novel topological state of matter\ncharacterized by a nonzero quantized Hall conductivity without an external\nmagnetic field. The realizations of QAH effect, however, are experimentally\nchallengeable. Based on ab initio calculations, here we propose an intrinsic\nQAH phase in DCA Kagome lattice. The nontrivial topology in Kagome bands are\nconfirmed by the nonzero chern number, quantized Hall conductivity, and gapless\nchiral edge states of Mn-DCA lattice. A tight-binding (TB) model is further\nconstructed to clarify the origin of QAH effect. Furthermore, its Curie\ntemperature, estimated to be ~ 253 K using Monte-Carlo simulation, is\ncomparable with room temperature and higher than most of two-dimensional\nferromagnetic thin films. Our findings present a reliable material platform for\nthe observation of QAH effect in covalent-organic frameworks.\n", "  Motivated by the recent increased interest in energy non-conserving models in\ncosmology, we extend the analysis of the cosmological consequences of the\nClassical Channel Model of Gravity (CCG). This model is based on the\nclassical-quantum interaction between a test particle and a metric (classical)\nand results in a theory with a modified Wheeler-deWitt equation that in turn\nleads to non conservation of energy. We show that CCG applied to a cosmological\nscenario with primordial matter leads to an emergent dark fluid that at late\ntimes behaves as a curvature term in the Friedmann equations, showing that the\nlate time behaviour is always dominated by the vacuum solutions. We discuss\npossible observational constraints for this model and that, in its current\nformulation, CCG eludes any meaningful constraints from current observations.\n", "  We provide universal expressions for the classical piece of the amplitude\ngiven by the graviton/photon exchange between massive particles of arbitrary\nspin, at both tree and one loop level. In the gravitational case this leads to\nhigher order terms in the post-Newtonian expansion, which have been previously\nused in the binary inspiral problem. The expressions are obtained in terms of a\ncontour integral that computes the Leading Singularity, which was recently\nshown to encode the relevant information up to one loop. The classical limit is\nperformed along a holomorphic trajectory in the space of kinematics, such that\nthe leading order is enough to extract arbitrarily high multipole corrections.\nThese multipole interactions are given in terms of a recently proposed\nrepresentation for massive particles of any spin by Arkani-Hamed et al. This\nexplicitly shows universality of the multipole interactions in the effective\npotential with respect to the spin of the scattered particles. We perform the\nexplicit match to standard EFT operators for $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $S=1$. As a\nnatural byproduct we obtain the classical pieces up to one loop for the bending\nof light.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of the filamentation effect in gas\ndevices designed for X-ray Free-electron Lasers. The measurements were carried\nout at the Linac Coherent Light Source on the X-ray Correlation Spectroscopy\n(XCS) instrument using a Two-bunch FEL beam at 6.5 keV with 122.5 ns separation\npassing through an Argon gas cell. The relative intensities of the two pulses\nof the Two-bunch beam were measured, after and before the gas cell, from the\nX-ray scattering off thin targets by using fast diodes with sufficient temporal\nresolution. It was found that the after-to-before ratio of the intensities of\nthe second pulse was consistently higher than that of the first pulse,\nrevealing lower effective attenuation of the gas cell due to the heating and\nsubsequent gas density reduction in the beam path by the first pulse. This\nmeasurement is important in guiding the design and/or mitigating the adverse\neffect in gas devices for high repetition-rate FELs such as the LCLS-II and the\nEuropean XFEL or other future high repetition-rate upgrade to existing FEL\nfacilities\n", "  The thermodynamic properties of superconducting electrons are usually studied\nby means of the quasi-particles distribution; but in this approach, the ground\nstate energy and the dependence of the chemical potential on the electron\ndensity cannot be determined. In order to solve these problems, the\nthermodynamic potentials are derived by means of the Bogoliubov-Valatin\nformalism. The thermodynamic potentials can be obtained by computing the free\nenergy of a gas of quasi-particles, whose energy spectrum is conditional on the\ngap function. However, the nontrivial dependence of the gap on the temperature\njeopardises the validity of the standard thermodynamic relations. In this\narticle it is shown how the thermodynamic consistency (i.e. the validity of the\nMaxwell relations) is recovered, and the correction terms to the\nquasi-particles potentials are computed. It is shown that the\nBogoliubov-Valatin transformation avoids the problem of the thermodynamic\nconsistency of the quasi-particle approach; in facts, the correct\nidentification of the variables, which are associated with the quasi-particles,\nleads to a precise calculation of the quasi-particles vacuum energy and of the\ndependence of the chemical potential on the electron density. The stationarity\ncondition for the grand potential coincides with the gap equation, which\nguarantees the thermodynamic consistency. The expressions of various\nthermodynamic potentials, as functions of the (T,V,N) variables, are produced\nin the low temperature limit; as a final check, a rederivation of the\ncondensation energy is presented.\n", "  Despite remarkable progress in developing multifunctional materials,\nspin-driven ferroelectrics featuring both spontaneous magnetization and\nelectric polarization are still rare. Among such ferromagnetic ferroelectrics\nare conical spin spiral magnets with a simultaneous reversal of magnetization\nand electric polarization that is still little understood. Such materials can\nfeature various multiferroic domains that complicates their study. Here we\nstudy the multiferroic domains in ferromagnetic ferroelectric Mn$_{2}$GeO$_{4}$\nusing neutron diffraction, and show that it features a double-Q conical\nmagnetic structure that, apart from trivial 180 degree commensurate magnetic\ndomains, can be described by ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains only. We\nshow unconventional magnetoelectric couplings such as the magnetic-field-driven\nreversal of ferroelectric polarization with no change of spin-helicity, and\npresent a phenomenological theory that successfully explains the\nmagnetoelectric coupling. Our measurements establish Mn$_{2}$GeO$_{4}$ as a\nconceptually simple multiferroic in which the magnetic-field-driven flop of\nconical spin spirals leads to the simultaneous reversal of magnetization and\nelectric polarization.\n", "  The differences of the ejection-image structures in the chromospheric lines\nand the coronal continuum are considered. The outer, more diffusive scattering\nenvelope of the ejection seems to be produced by the excessive free electrons\ndue to the Compton effect. The resulting electric field accelerate the\nparticles while the hard radiation is acting. The directed motion of the\naccelerated particles induces the magnetic fields.\n", "  The accurate determination and control of the wavelength of light is\nfundamental to many fields of science. Speckle patterns resulting from the\ninterference of multiple reflections in disordered media are well-known to\nscramble the information content of light by complex but linear processes.\nHowever, these patterns are, in fact, exceptionally rich in information about\nthe illuminating source. We use a fibre-coupled integrating sphere to generate\nwavelength-dependent speckle patterns, in combination with algorithms based on\nthe transmission matrix method and principal component analysis, to realize a\nbroadband and sensitive wavemeter. We demonstrate sub-femtometre wavelength\nresolution at a centre wavelength of 780 nm and a broad calibrated measurement\nrange from 488 to 1064 nm. This is comparable with or exceeding the performance\nof conventional wavemeters. Using this speckle wavemeter as part of a feedback\nloop, we stabilize a 780 nm diode laser to achieve a linewidth better than 1\nMHz.\n", "  We study the transmission of light through a system consisting of an\narbitrary number $N$ of microtoroidal resonators coupled to a one-dimensional\n(1D) waveguide. The transmission $T$ through such a system and its full-width\nat half-maximum (FWHM) are calculated for various values of $N$ and mutual-mode\ncoupling coefficients. We found that at small mutual-mode coupling, the minimum\ntransmission vanishes exponentially with $N$ while the FWHM is proportional to\n$\\sqrt{N}$. At big mutual-mode coupling, as the number of resonators increases,\nthe mode-splitting is reduced. Our findings contribute to better understanding\nof novel interfaces between quantum emitters and resonant photonic structures\nfor quantum information processing.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements were\ncarried out on a multi-layered cuprate superconductor\nBa$_2$Ca$_5$Cu$_6$O$_{12}$(O$_{1-x}$,F$_x$)$_2$. STM topography revealed random\nspot structures with the characteristic length $\\le 0.5$ nm. The conductance\nspectra dI/dV(V) show the coexistence of smaller gaps $\\Delta_S$ and large gaps\n(pseudogaps) $\\Delta_L$. The pseudogap-related features in the superconducting\nstate were traced with the spatial resolution of $\\sim$ 0.07 nm. Here, $I$ and\n$V$ are the tunnel current and bias voltage, respectively. The temperature,\n$T$, dependence of $\\Delta_S$ follows the reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) dependence. The hallmark ratio 2$\\Delta_{S}(T=0)/k_B T_c$ equals to 4.9,\nwhich is smaller than those of other cuprate superconductors. Here, $T_c$ is\nthe superconducting critical temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe larger gap $\\Delta_L$ survives in the normal state and even increases with\n$T$ above $T_c$. The $T$ dependences of the spatial distributions for both\nrelevant gaps ($\\Delta$ map), as well as for each gap separately ($\\Delta_S$\nand $\\Delta_L$) were obtained. From the histogram of $\\Delta$ map, the averaged\ngap values were found to be $\\bar \\Delta_S = \\sim 24$ meV and $\\bar \\Delta_L =\n\\sim 79$ meV. The smaller gap $\\Delta_S$ shows a spatially homogeneous\ndistribution while the larger gap $\\Delta_L$ is quite inhomogeneous, indicating\nthat rather homogeneous superconductivity coexists with the patchy distributed\npseudogap. The spatial variation length $\\xi_{\\Delta_L}$ of $\\Delta_L$\ncorrelates with the scale of the topography spot structures, being\napproximately 0.4 nm. This value is considerably smaller than the coherence\nlength of this class of superconductors, suggesting that $\\Delta_L$ is strongly\naffected by the disorder of the apical O/F.\n", "  Invoking Maxwell's classical equations in conjunction with expressions for\nthe electromagnetic (EM) energy, momentum, force, and torque, we use a few\nsimple examples to demonstrate the nature of the EM angular momentum. The\nenergy and the angular momentum of an EM field will be shown to have an\nintimate relationship; a source radiating EM angular momentum will, of\nnecessity, pick up an equal but opposite amount of mechanical angular momentum;\nand the spin and orbital angular momenta of the EM field, when absorbed by a\nsmall particle, will be seen to elicit different responses from the particle.\n", "  We present an optimized seeded chemical vapor transport method for the growth\nof Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$ that allows for chemical control in a system with many\nstable phases to selectively produce large phase pure single crystals. This\nmethod is shown to consistently produce single crystals in the range of 120 to\n180 mg. A Wulff construction model of a representative crystal shows that the\nminimum energy surface is {1 1 0}, followed by {1 0 0}. Analysis of the lowest\nindex planes revealed that cleavage of Se-O bonds has a large energy cost,\nleading to an overall high surface energy. The seeded chemical vapor transport\ndemonstrated here shows promise for large single crystal growth of other\nfunctional materials such as Weyl semimetals, frustrated magnets, and\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Controlling quantum critical phenomena in strongly correlated electron\nsystems, which emerge in the neighborhood of a quantum phase transition, is a\nmajor challenge in modern condensed matter physics. Quantum critical phenomena\nare generated from the delicate balance between long-range order and its\nquantum fluctuation. So far, the nature of quantum phase transitions has been\ninvestigated by changing a limited number of external parameters such as\npressure and magnetic field. We propose a new approach for investigating\nquantum criticality by changing the strength of quantum fluctuation that is\ncontrolled by the dimensional crossover in metallic quantum well (QW)\nstructures of strongly correlated oxides. With reducing layer thickness to the\ncritical thickness of metal-insulator transition, crossover from a Fermi liquid\nto a non-Fermi liquid has clearly been observed in the metallic QW of SrVO$_3$\nby \\textit{in situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior with the critical exponent ${\\alpha} = 1$ is found to emerge in the\ntwo-dimensional limit of the metallic QW states, indicating that a quantum\ncritical point exists in the neighborhood of the thickness-dependent Mott\ntransition. These results suggest that artificial QW structures provide a\nunique platform for investigating novel quantum phenomena in strongly\ncorrelated oxides in a controllable fashion.\n", "  In terms of ${\\cal P}_{c1,c2}={\\cal P}_c(4380,4450)^+$ as the hidden charm\npentaquark states to consist of $c\\bar c uud$, we study the semileptonic\n$\\Lambda_b\\to ({\\cal P}_{c1,c2}\\to)J/\\psi p \\ell^-\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decays. In our\ndiscussion, while the main contribution to $\\Lambda_b\\to K^-J/\\psi p$ is from\nthe non-perturbative process via the doubly charmful $b\\to c\\bar cs$\ntransition, we propose that the $\\Lambda_b\\to {\\cal P}_{c1,c2}\\to J/\\psi p$\ntransitions are partly contribute to the $\\Lambda_b\\to K^-({\\cal\nP}_{c1,c2}\\to)J/\\psi p$ decays, in which the required $c\\bar c$ pair is formed\nby the sea quarks, intrinsic charm, or both. We predict that ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi p \\ell^-\\bar\n\\nu_\\ell)=(2.04^{+4.82}_{-1.57},1.75^{+4.14}_{-1.35})\\times 10^{-6}$ for\n$\\ell=(e,\\mu)$, which are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the\nobserved decay of $\\Lambda_b\\to p\\mu\\bar \\nu_\\mu$. We also explore the angular\ncorrelations for the $J/\\psi p$ and $\\ell^-\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ pairs. Our results of\nthe decay branching ratios and angular asymmetries in $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi p\n\\ell^-\\bar \\nu_\\ell$, accessible to the ongoing experiments at the LHCb, can be\nused to improve the understanding of the hidden charm pentaquark states.\n", "  We calculate in the framework of the collinear QCD approach the amplitude for\nexclusive neutrino-production of a pseudoscalar charmed $D$ meson. This process\nallows to access gluon and both chiral-odd and chiral-even quark generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs), which contribute in specific ways to the amplitude\nfor different polarization states of the $W$ boson. The energy dependence of\nthe cross section allows to separate different contributions and the\nmeasurement of the azimuthal dependence helps to single out the transversity\nchiral-odd GPDs contributions. The flavor dependence, and in particular the\ndifference between $D^+$ and $D^0$ production rates, allows to test the\nimportance of gluonic contributions. The behaviour of the proton and neutron\ntarget cross sections enables to separate the $u$ and $d$ quark contributions.\nPlanned medium and high energy neutrino facilities will thus allow some\nimportant progress in the realm of hadronic physics.\n", "  The nonlinear lattice---a new and nonlinear class of periodic\npotentials---was recently introduced to generate various nonlinear localized\nmodes. Several attempts failed to stabilize two-dimensional (2D) solitons\nagainst their intrinsic critical collapse in Kerr media. Here, we provide a\npossibility for supporting 2D matter-wave solitons and vortices in an extended\nsetting---the cubic and quintic model---by introducing another nonlinear\nlattice whose period is controllable and can be different from its cubic\ncounterpart, to its quintic nonlinearity, therefore making a fully `nonlinear\nquasi-crystal'.\n  A variational approximation based on Gaussian ansatz is developed for the\nfundamental solitons and in particular, their stability exactly follows the\ninverted \\textit{Vakhitov-Kolokolov} stability criterion, whereas the vortex\nsolitons are only studied by means of numerical methods. Stability regions for\ntwo types of localized mode---the fundamental and vortex solitons---are\nprovided. A noteworthy feature of the localized solutions is that the vortex\nsolitons are stable only when the period of the quintic nonlinear lattice is\nthe same as the cubic one or when the quintic nonlinearity is constant, while\nthe stable fundamental solitons can be created under looser conditions. Our\nphysical setting (cubic-quintic model) is in the framework of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) or nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, the\npredicted localized modes thus may be implemented in Bose-Einstein condensates\nand nonlinear optical media with tunable cubic and quintic nonlinearities.\n", "  The recent detection of a large polarization degree in the optical emission\nof an isolated neutron star led to the suggestion that this has been the first\nevidence of vacuum polarization in a strong magnetic field, an effect predicted\nby quantum electrodynamics but never observed before. This claim was challanged\nin a paper by Capparelli, Maiani & Polosa (2017), according to whom a much\nhigher polarization degree would be necessary to positively identify vacuum\npolarization. Here we show that their conclusions are biased by several\ninadequate assumptions and have no impact on the original claim.\n", "  We propose a novel scheme for realizing single-photon blockade in a weakly\ndriven hybrid cavity optomechanical system consisting of a nonlinear photonic\ncrystal. Sub-Poissonian statistics is realized even when the single-photon\noptomechanical coupling strength is smaller than the decay rate of the optical\nmode. The scheme relaxes the requirement of strong coupling for photon blockade\nin optomechanical systems. It is shown that photon blockade could be generated\nat the telecommunication wavelength.\n", "  We prove that a neutral atom in mean-field approximation has ${\\rm O}(4)$\nsymmetry and this fact explains the empirical $[n+l,n]$-rule or Madelung rule\nwhich describes effectively periods, structure and other properties of the\nMendeleev table of chemical elements.\n", "  We put constraints on dark energy properties using the PADE parameterisation,\nand compare it to the same constraints using Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)\nand $\\Lambda$CDM, at both the background and the perturbation levels. The dark\nenergy equation of state parameter of the models is derived following the\nmathematical treatment of PADE expansion. Unlike CPL parameterisation, the PADE\napproximation provides different forms of the equation of state parameter which\navoid the divergence in the far future. Initially, we perform a likelihood\nanalysis in order to put constraints on the model parameters using solely\nbackground expansion data and we find that all parameterisations are consistent\nwith each other. Then, combining the expansion and the growth rate data we test\nthe viability of PADE parameterisations and compare them with CPL and\n$\\Lambda$CDM models respectively. Specifically, we find that the growth rate of\nthe current PADE parameterisations is lower than $\\Lambda$CDM model at low\nredshifts, while the differences among the models are negligible at high\nredshifts. In this context, we provide for the first time growth index of\nlinear matter perturbations in PADE cosmologies. Considering that dark energy\nis homogeneous we recover the well known asymptotic value of the growth index,\nnamely $\\gamma_{\\infty}=\\frac{3(w_{\\infty}-1)}{6w_{\\infty}-5}$, while in the\ncase of clustered dark energy we obtain $\\gamma_{\\infty}\\simeq\n\\frac{3w_{\\infty}(3w_{\\infty}-5)}{(6w_{\\infty}-5)(3w_{\\infty}-1)}$. Finally, we\ngeneralize the growth index analysis in the case where $\\gamma$ is allowed to\nvary with redshift and we find that the form of $\\gamma(z)$ in PADE\nparameterisation extends that of the CPL and $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies\nrespectively.\n", "  Numerical methods are used to examine the thermodynamic characteristics of\nthe two-dimensional Ising model as a function of the number of spins N.\nOnsager's solution is generalized to a finite-size lattice, and experimentally\nvalidated analytical expressions for the free energy and its derivatives are\ncomputed. The heat capacity at the critical point is shown to grow\nlogarithmically with N. Due to the finite extent of the system the critical\ntemperature can only be determined to some accuracy.\n", "  Cu added CdS films were synthesized using spin coating technique at different\nspin speeds for different time durations. Films were subsequently annealed at\ndifferent temperatures for different time periods in air to crystallize the\nphase of CdS in thin film form. Films were characterized using XRD, UV- visible\nspectrometer and solar simulator. According to XRD patterns, addition of trace\namount of Cu did not change the structure of CdS. However, the optical band gap\ngradually decreases with percentage of Cu as expected. As a result, the\nphotocurrent, fill factor and efficiency measured in KI/I2 electrolyte\ngradually increase with the amount of Cu. Photovoltaic properties could be\nimproved without altering the structure of CdS. Efficiency enhanced CdS films\nfind potential applications in solar cell industry.\n", "  In this paper, investigations are conducted using Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models to investigate the importance of\nturbulence modelling for nasal inspiration at a constant flow rate of 250 ml/s.\nFour different, standard turbulence models are tested in a model geometry based\non pre-operative CT images of a selected obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome\n(OSAS) patient. The results show only minor differences between them.\nFurthermore, the turbulence models do not give significantly different results\nthan a laminar flow model. Thus, the main conclusion is that effects of\nturbulence are insignificant in CFD modelling of the airflow in the\npre-operative model of the upper airways of the chosen patient.\n", "  The tensile strength of small dusty bodies in the solar system is determined\nby the interaction between the composing grains. In the transition regime\nbetween small and sticky dust ($\\rm \\mu m$) and non cohesive large grains (mm),\nparticles still stick to each other but are easily separated. In laboratory\nexperiments we find that thermal creep gas flow at low ambient pressure\ngenerates an overpressure sufficient to overcome the tensile strength. For the\nfirst time it allows a direct measurement of the tensile strength of\nindividual, very small (sub)-mm aggregates which consist of only tens of grains\nin the (sub)-mm size range. We traced the disintegration of aggregates by\noptical imaging in ground based as well as microgravity experiments and present\nfirst results for basalt, palagonite and vitreous carbon samples with up to a\nfew hundred Pa. These measurements show that low tensile strength can be the\nresult of building loose aggregates with compact (sub)-mm units. This is in\nfavour of a combined cometary formation scenario by aggregation to compact\naggreates and gravitational instability of these units.\n", "  Turbulent boundary layers over flat walls in the presence of a hill are\nfrequently found in nature and industry. Some examples are the air flows over\nhills and desert dunes, but also water flows over aquatic dunes inside closed\nconduits. The perturbation of a two-dimensional boundary layer by a hill\nintroduces new scales in the problem, changing the way in which velocities and\nstresses are distributed along the flow. When in the presence of sediment\ntransport, the stress distribution along the hill is strongly related to bed\ninstabilities. This paper presents an experimental study on the perturbation of\na fully-developed turbulent boundary layer by a two-dimensional hill. Water\nflows were imposed over a hill fixed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and\nthe flow field was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry. From the flow\nmeasurements, mean and fluctuation fields were computed. The general behaviors\nof velocities and stresses are compared to published asymptotic analyses and\nthe surface shear stress is analyzed in terms of instabilities of a granular\nbed.\n", "  The study is looking into the potential of using computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) as a tool for predicting the outcome of surgery for alleviation of\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). From pre- and post-operative computed\ntomography (CT) of an OSAS patient, the pre- and post-operative geometries of\nthe patient's upper airways were generated. CFD simulations of laminar flow in\nthe patient's upper airway show that after nasal surgery the mass flow is more\nevenly distributed between the two nasal cavities and the pressure drop over\nthe nasal cavity has increased. The pressure change is contrary to clinical\nmeasurements that the CFD results have been compared with, and this is most\nlikely related to the earlier steps of modelling - CT acquisition and geometry\nretrieval.\n", "  We report the energy and angular distribution of ejected electrons from\nCH$_4$ and H$_{2}$O molecules impacted by 1 MeV H$^+$, He$^+$ and 650 keV N$^+$\nions. Spectra were measured at different observation angles, from 2 eV to 2000\neV. The obtained absolute double-differential-electron-emission cross sections\n(DDCS) were compared with the results of CTMC and CDW-EIS calculations. For the\nbare H+ projectile both theories show remarkable agreement with the experiment\nat all observed angles and energies. The CTMC results are in similarly good\nagreement with the DDCS spectra obtained for impact by dressed He$^+$ and N$^+$\nions, where screening effects and electron loss from the projectile gain\nimportance. The CDW-EIS calculations slightly overestimate the electron loss\nfor 1 MeV He$^+$ impact, and overestimate both the target and projectile\nionization at low emitted electron energies for 650 keV N$^+$ impact. The\ncontribution of multiple electron scattering by the projectile and target\ncenters (Fermi-shuttle) dominates the N$^+$-impact spectra at higher electron\nenergies, and it is well reproduced by the non-perturbative CTMC calculations.\nThe contributions of different processes in medium velocity collisions of\ndressed ions with molecules are determined.\n", "  The variation of fine structure constant with the variation of velocity of\nlight has been studied considering contribution to the permeability and\npermittivity of the vacuum and incorporating contribution of fractal potential\noriginated from the non-differentiability of fractal fluctuation. The time\nvariation of $\\alpha$ is found to depend on the complex velocity field\ncharacteristics of fractal nature of space time.\n", "  The strategy of using the definition of work function from photoelectric\neffect to determine precise and reliable work function by the contribution of\nfrequency to photoelectric yield is investigated theoretically in this paper.\nBased on the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the definition of work function\nproposed by Einstein in photoelectric effect, a typical numerical method is\npursed step by step to quantitatively analyze the frequency-dependent\nphotoelectric yield. Supplementing applications to In14 cluster and three kinds\nof metals, the simulations agree well with the observed spectra (photoelectric\nyield-frequency). At the same time, the threshold frequency of light-dependent\nthe work function is theoretically explained successfully via one equation so\nthat the work function can be predicted precisely and reliably. These results\nsuggest that the formalism pursed in this paper, which is straight forward and\nphysical, may be of significant utility in metal cluster spectroscopy. It is\nhoped also that the results will encourage a comprehensive theoretical analysis\nof the applicability of bulk-derived models to cluster photo-ionization\nbehavior, and of the transition from atomic and molecular-type to surface-type\nphotoemission.\n", "  CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are considered as an emerging\ntechnology in the field of charged particle tracking. They will be used in the\nvertex detectors of experiments like STAR, CBM and ALICE and are considered for\nthe ILC and the tracker of ATLAS. In those applications, the sensors are\nexposed to sizeable radiation doses.\n  While the tolerance of MAPS to ionizing radiation and fast hadrons is well\nknown, the damage caused by low energy neutrons was not studied so far. Those\nslow neutrons may initiate nuclear fission of $^{10}$B dopants found in the\nB-doped silicon active medium of MAPS. This effect was expected to create an\nunknown amount of radiation damage beyond the predictions of the NIEL (Non\nIonizing Energy Loss) model for pure silicon.\n  We estimate the impact of this effect by calculating the additional NIEL\ncreated by this fission. Moreover, we show first measured data for CMOS sensors\nwhich were irradiated with cold neutrons. The empirical results contradict the\nprediction of the updated NIEL model both, qualitatively and quantitatively:\nThe sensors irradiated with slow neutrons show an unexpected and strong\nacceptor removal, which is not observed in sensors irradiated with MeV\nneutrons.\n", "  Irreversible processes are frequently adopted to account for the entropy\nincrease in classical thermodynamics. However, the corresponding physical\norigins are not always clear, e.g. in a free expansion process, a typical model\nin textbooks. In this letter, we study the entropy change during free expansion\nfor a particle with the thermal de Broglie wavelength ($\\lambda_{T}$) in a\none-dimensional square trap with size $L$. By solely including quantum\ndephasing as an irreversible process, we recover classical result of entropy\nincrease in the classical region ($L\\gg\\lambda_{T}$), while predict prominent\ndiscrepancies in the quantum region ($L\\ll\\lambda_{T}$) because of\nnon-equilibrium feature of trapped atoms after expansion. It is interesting to\nnotice that the dephasing, though absent in classical system, is critical to\nclarify mysteries in classical thermodynamics.\n", "  Recently, new FeAs based high-temperature superconductors CaAFe4As4 (A=K, Rb,\nCs) with a layered tetragonal crystal structure were synthesized (TC ~ 30 K).\nIn this Letter, we report for the first time the band structures, Fermi surface\ntopology, total and partial densities of electronic states and interatomic\ninteractions for CaAFe4As4 as estimated by means of the first-principles\nFLAPW-GGA calculations. The interatomic bonding picture can be represented as a\nhighly anisotropic mixture of metallic, covalent, and ionic contributions,\nwhich are realized inside Fe4As4 layered blocks and between these blocks and\nCa, A atomic sheets. The Fermi surfaces of these systems have a multisheet\ncharacter and are compiled of a large number of cylinders at the edges and in\nthe central part of the Brillouin zone. It is established that the\nhigh-temperature superconductivity in CaAFe4As4 compounds as in other related\nsystems correlates well with such structure parameters as bond angles and anion\nheight.\n", "  Dark gaps are commonly seen in early-to-intermediate type barred galaxies\nhaving inner and outer rings or related features. In this paper, the\nmorphologies of 54 barred and oval ringed galaxies have been examined with the\ngoal of determining what the dark gaps are telling us about the structure and\nevolution of barred galaxies. The analysis is based mainly on galaxies selected\nfrom the Galaxy Zoo 2 database and the Catalogue of Southern Ringed Galaxies.\nThe dark gaps between inner and outer rings are of interest because of their\nlikely association with the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points that would be present\nin the gravitational potential of a bar or oval. Since the points are\ntheoretically expected to lie very close to the corotation resonance (CR) of\nthe bar pattern, the gaps provide the possibility of locating corotation in\nsome galaxies simply by measuring the radius rgp of the gap region and setting\nrCR=rgp. With the additional assumption of generally flat rotation curves, the\nlocations of other resonances can be predicted and compared with observed\nmorphological features. It is shown that this \"gap method\" provides remarkably\nconsistent interpretations of the morphology of early-to-intermediate type\nbarred galaxies. The paper also brings attention to cases where the dark gaps\nlie inside an inner ring, rather than between inner and outer rings. These may\nhave a different origin compared to the inner/outer ring gaps.\n", "  We develop Dy$^{3+}$-doped yttrium complexes for use as two-color thermometry\n(TCT) phosphor molecular crystals in heterogeneous materials. These complexes\ninclude: Dy:Y(acac)$_3$(phen), Dy:Y(hfa)$_3$(DPEPO), Dy:Y(4-BBA)$_3$(TPPO),\nDy:Y(acac)$_3$, and Dy:Y(acac)$_3$(DPEPO), where the Dy/Y ratio is 1:9. We\ncharacterize the materials' photoluminescence at different temperatures to\ndetermine the TCT calibration parameters and the degree to which thermal\nquenching influences the emission. From this data we observe a link between the\nexcited state lifetime at room temperature and the degree to which the material\nis susceptible to thermal quenching (i.e. materials having long room\ntemperature lifetimes are more resistant to thermal quenching than materials\nwith short room temperature lifetimes). Of the five complexes tested we find\nthat Dy:Y(acac)$_3$(DPEPO) has the best thermal performance, with the most\nlikely source of improvement being DPEPO's compact rigid structure. This\nrigidity helps with energy transfer to the Dy$^{3+}$ ion, suppresses\nnon-radiative loss modes, and reduces exciplex formation.\n", "  We develop a two-color thermometry (TCT) phosphor based on\n[Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acetylacetonate)$_3$(1,10-phenanthroline)]\n([Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)]) molecular crystals for use in heterogeneous\nmaterials. We characterize the optical properties of\n[Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)] crystals at different temperatures and Dy\nconcentrations and find that the emission is strongly quenched by increasing\ntemperature and concentration. We also observe a broad background emission (due\nto the ligands) and find that [Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)] photodegrades\nunder 355 nm illumination with the photodegradation resulting in decreased\nluminescence intensity. However, while decreasing the overall emission\nintensity, photodegradation is not found to influence the integrated intensity\nratio of the ${}^4I_{15/2} \\rightarrow {}^6H_{15/2}$ and ${}^4F_{9/2}\n\\rightarrow {}^6H_{15/2}$ transitions. This ratio allows us to compute the\ntemperature of the complex Based on the temperature dependence of these ratios\nwe calculate that [Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)] has a maximum sensitivity\nof 1.5 \\% K$^{-1}$ and our TCT system has a minimum temperature resolution of\n1.8 K. Finally, we demonstrate the use of [Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)] as\na TCT phosphor by determining a dynamic temperature profile using the emission\nfrom [Y$_{1-x}$Dy$_x$(acac)$_3$(phen)].\n", "  Manual maintenance and repair of cracks in concrete structures are often\nunsustainable because of associated labor, capital and environmental damage.\nIntroduction of microfibers and superabsorbent polymers is a material solution\nto restrict crack propagation and enhance self-healing efficiency. Therefore,\nthe study proposes a combination of polypropylene(PP) fibers and superabsorbent\npolymers (SAP) which would facilitate autonomous healing and recover original\nmechanical and durability properties of mortar. Mechanical strength, sorptivity\nand water penetration of healed mortars were compared to that of undamaged\nmortar at same age to estimate recovery of original properties while crack\nsealing was investigated by means of optical microscopy. Experimental results\nshow mortar with combination of PP fibers and SAP showed full recovery of\nmechanical strength after healing while recovery in durability up to 90% was\nrecorded. Microscopic images show that average crack-sealing ratio of 85% could\nbe achieved under moist condition by combination of SAP and PP fibers while\nsealing under drier air curing condition is also significantly higher than\nreference samples with only fibers. Crack width up to 330{\\mu}m has been found\nto be completely sealed by carbonate crystals. Furthermore, mortar with SAP and\nPP fibers retain about 70% of their original 28-day strength after three cycles\nof loading while reference mortar samples were found to retain only about\n40-50% of their original strength. Effective crack sealing and high recovery of\noriginal properties in mortars with SAP and fibers suggest that this material\ncombination would reduce the need for environmentally damaging and expensive\nrepairs during the service life.\n", "  For more than a decade there has been a push in the planetary science\ncommunity to support interoperable methods for accessing and working with\ngeospatial data. Common geospatial data products for planetary research include\nimage mosaics, digital elevation or terrain models, geologic maps, geographic\nlocation databases (e.g., craters, volcanoes) or any data that can be tied to\nthe surface of a planetary body (including moons, comets or asteroids). Several\nU.S. and international cartographic research institutions have converged on\nmapping standards that embrace standardized geospatial image formats, geologic\nmapping conventions, U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) cartographic\nand metadata standards, and notably on-line mapping services as defined by the\nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC).\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy analysis is employed to study the geometrical and\ntopological properties of $3000$kbp DNA molecules fixed in mica substrates with\n$MgCl_{2}$. We found that the aggregates on the substrate surface for certain\nsalt concentrations form a honeycomb stable structure with the addition of\nsalt. The honeycomb, and the transition to other structures, were characterized\nby the \\emph{Betti numbers}, which is a topological invariant property and by\n\\emph{Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal dimension}.\n", "  We report experimental measurements for ultrathin (< 15 nm) van der Waals\nheterostructures exhibiting external quantum efficiencies exceeding 50%, and\nshow that these structures can achieve experimental absorbance > 90%. By\ncoupling electromagnetic simulations and experimental measurements, we show\nthat pn WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with vertical carrier collection can have\ninternal photocarrier collection efficiencies exceeding 70%.\n", "  We report on the occurrence of negative-phase-velocity (NPV) planewave\npropagation in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole. By implementing the\nKerr metric, it is demonstrated that regions of NPV propagation are\nconcentrated at the equator of the ergosphere, while NPV propagation is less\ncommon towards the polar regions. Increasing the angular velocity of the black\nhole exaggerates the NPV concentration at the equator. NPV propagation is not\nobserved outside the stationary limit surface.\n"]}
