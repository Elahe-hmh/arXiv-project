In 25 nm thick Py films and 50 nm\nthick Co films both the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and MTEP show a\nrelative change in resistance and thermoelectric power (TEP) of the order of\n0.2% when the magnetic field is reversed, and in both cases there is no\nsignificant change in AMR or MTEP any more after the saturation field has been\nreached. Surprisingly, both Py and Co films have opposite MTEP behavior\nalthough both have the same sign for AMR and TEP. The data on 100 nm films of\nfully spin-polarized CrO2, grown both on TiO2 and on sapphire, show a different\npicture. The MTEP behavior at low fields shows peaks similar to the AMR in\nthese films, with variations up to 1%. With increasing field both the MR and\nthe MTEP variations keeps growing, with MTEP showing relative changes of 1.5%\nwith the thermal gradient along the b-axis and even 20% with the gradient along\nthe c-axis, with an intermediate value of 3% for the film on sapphire. It\nappears that the low-field effects are due to magnetic domain switching, while\nthe high-field effects are intrinsic to the electronic structure of CrO2.\n", "  A critical requirement for high gain and low noise avalanche photodiodes is\nthe single-carrier avalanche multiplication. We propose that the single-carrier\navalanche multiplication can be achieved in materials with a limited width of\nthe conduction or valence band resulting in a restriction of kinetic energy for\none of the charge carriers. This feature is not common to the majority of\ntechnologically relevant semiconductors, but it is observed in chalcogenides,\nsuch as Selenium and compound I2-II-IV-VI4 alloys.\n", "  Laser cooling has given a boost to atomic physics throughout the last thirty\nyears since it allows one to prepare atoms in motional states which can only be\ndescribed by quantum mechanics. Most methods, such as Doppler cooling,\npolarization gradient cooling or sub-recoil laser cooling rely, however, on a\nnear-resonant and cyclic coupling between laser light and well-defined internal\nstates. Although this feat has recently even been achieved for diatomic\nmolecules, it is very hard for mesoscopic particles. It has been proposed that\nan external cavity may compensate for the lack of internal cycling transitions\nin dielectric objects and it may thus provide assistance in the cooling of\ntheir centre of mass state. Here, we demonstrate cavity cooling of the\ntransverse kinetic energy of silicon nanoparticles propagating in genuine\nhigh-vacuum (< 10^8 mbar). We create and launch them with longitudinal\nvelocities even down to v < 1 m/s using laser induced thermomechanical stress\non a pristine silicon wafer. The interaction with the light of a high-finesse\ninfrared cavity reduces their transverse kinetic energy by more than a factor\nof 30. This is an important step towards new tests of recent proposals to\nexplore the still speculative non-linearities of quantum mechanics with objects\nin the mass range between 10^7 and 10^10 amu.\n", "  We study the consequences of unbroken rigid supersymmetry of four-dimensional\nfield theories placed on curved manifolds. We show that in Lorentzian signature\nthe background vector field coupling to the R-current is determined by the Weyl\ntensor of the background metric. In Euclidean signature, the same holds if two\nsupercharges of opposite R-charge are preserved, otherwise the (anti-)self-dual\npart of the vector field-strength is fixed by the Weyl tensor. As a result of\nthis relation, the trace and R-current anomalies of superconformal field\ntheories simplify, with the trace anomaly becoming purely topological. In\nparticular, in Lorentzian signature, or in the presence of two Euclidean\nsupercharges of opposite R-charge, supersymmetry of the background implies that\nthe term proportional to the central charge c vanishes, both in the trace and\nR-current anomalies. This is equivalent to the vanishing of a superspace Weyl\ninvariant. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.\n", "  Strong evidence for charge-density correlation in the underdoped phase of the\ncuprate YBa2Cu3Oy was obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and resonant\nx-ray scatter- ing. The fluctuations were found to be enhanced in strong\nmagnetic fields. Recently, 3D (three dimensional) charge-density wave (CDW)\nformation with long-range order (LRO) was observed by x-ray diffraction in H\n>15 T. To elucidate how the CDW transition impacts the pair condensate, we have\nused torque magnetization to 45 T and thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{xx}$ to\nconstruct the magnetic phase diagram in untwinned crystals with hole density p\n= 0.11. We show that the 3D CDW transitions appear as sharp features in the\nsusceptibility and $\\kappa_{xx}$ at the fields HK and Hp, which define phase\nboundaries in agreement with spectroscopic techniques. From measurements of the\nmelting field Hm(T) of the vortex solid, we obtain evidence for two vortex\nsolid states below 8 K. At 0.5 K, the pair condensate appears to adjust to the\n3D CDW by a sharp transition at 24 T between two vortex solids with very\ndifferent shear moduli. At even higher H (42 T) the second vortex solid melts\nto a vortex liquid which survives to fields well above 45 T. de Haas-van Alphen\noscillations appear at fields 24-28 T, below the lower bound for the upper\ncritical field Hc2.\n", "  Random matrix ensembles are introduced that respect the local tensor\nstructure of Hamiltonians describing a chain of $n$ distinguishable spin-half\nparticles with nearest-neighbour interactions. We prove a central limit theorem\nfor the density of states when $n \\rightarrow\\infty$, giving explicit bounds on\nthe rate of approach to the limit. Universality within a class of probability\nmeasures and the extension to more general interaction geometries are\nestablished. The level spacing distributions of the Gaussian Orthogonal,\nUnitary and Symplectic Ensembles are observed numerically for the energy levels\nin these ensembles.\n", "  We prove that translationally invariant Hamiltonians of a chain of $n$ qubits\nwith nearest-neighbour interactions have two seemingly contradictory features.\nFirstly in the limit $n\\rightarrow\\infty$ we show that any translationally\ninvariant Hamiltonian of a chain of $n$ qubits has an eigenbasis such that\nalmost all eigenstates have maximal entanglement between fixed-size sub-blocks\nof qubits and the rest of the system; in this sense these eigenstates are like\nthose of completely general Hamiltonians (i.e. Hamiltonians with interactions\nof all orders between arbitrary groups of qubits). Secondly in the limit\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$ we show that any nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian of a chain\nof $n$ qubits has a Gaussian density of states; thus as far as the eigenvalues\nare concerned the system is like a non-interacting one. The comparison applies\nto chains of qubits with translationally invariant nearest-neighbour\ninteractions, but we show that it is extendible to much more general systems\n(both in terms of the local dimension and the geometry of interaction).\nNumerical evidence is also presented which suggests that the translational\ninvariance condition may be dropped in the case of nearest-neighbour chains.\n", "  Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals are 3D analogs of graphene in which\ncrystalline symmetry protects the nodes against gap formation [1-3]. Na$_3$Bi\nand Cd$_3$As$_2$ were predicted to be Dirac semimetals [4,5], and recently\nconfirmed to be so by photoemission [6-8]. Several novel transport properties\nin a magnetic field $\\bf H$ have been proposed for Dirac semimetals [2,9-11].\nHere we report an interesting property in Cd$_3$As$_2$ that was unpredicted,\nnamely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses\nback-scattering in zero $\\bf H$. In single crystals, the protection results in\na very high mobility that exceeds $>10^7$ cm$^2$/Vs below 4 K. Suppression of\nbackscattering results in a transport lifetime 10$^4\\times$ longer than the\nquantum lifetime. The lifting of this protection by $\\bf H$ leads to an unusual\ngiant $\\bf H$-linear magnetoresistance that violates Kohler's rule. We discuss\nhow this may relate to changes to the Fermi surface induced by $\\bf H$.\n", "  We consider random interlacements on Z^d, with d bigger or equal to 3, when\ntheir vacant set is in a strongly percolative regime. We derive an asymptotic\nupper bound on the probability that the random interlacements disconnect a box\nof large side-length from the boundary of a larger homothetic box. As a\ncorollary, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound on a similar quantity, where the\nrandom interlacements are replaced by the simple random walk. It is plausible,\nbut open at the moment, that these asymptotic upper bounds match the asymptotic\nlower bounds obtained by Xinyi Li and the author in arXiv:1310.2177, for random\ninterlacements, and by Xinyi Li in a recent article, for the simple random\nwalk. In any case, our bounds capture the principal exponential rate of decay\nof these probabilities, in any dimension d bigger or equal to 3.\n", "  In a ferromagnet, the spin excitations are the well-studied magnons. In\nfrustrated quantum magnets, long-range magnetic order fails to develop despite\na large exchange coupling between the spins. In contrast to the magnons in\nconventional magnets, their spin excitations are poorly understood. Are they\nitinerant or localized? Here we show that the thermal Hall conductivity\n$\\kappa_{xy}$ provides a powerful probe of spin excitations in the \"quantum\nspin ice\" pyrochlore Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. The thermal Hall response is large even\nthough the material is transparent. The Hall response arises from spin\nexcitations with specific characteristics that distinguish them from magnons.\nAt low temperature ($T<$ 1 K), the thermal conductivity imitates that of a\ndirty metal. Using the Hall angle, we construct a phase diagram showing how the\nexcitations are suppressed by a magnetic field.\n", "  We have obtained deep NIR narrow and broad (J and Y) band imaging data of the\nGOODS-South field. The narrow band filter is centered at 1060 nm corresponding\nto redshifts $z = 0.62, 1.15, 1.85$ for the strong emission lines H$\\alpha$,\n$[$OIII$]$/H$\\beta$ and $[$OII$]$, respectively. From those data we extract a\nwell defined sample ($M(AB)=24.8$ in the narrow band) of objects with large\nemission line equivalent widths in the narrow band. Via SED fits to published\nbroad band data we identify which of the three lines we have detected and\nassign redshifts accordingly. This results in a well defined, strong emission\nline selected sample of galaxies down to lower masses than can easily be\nobtained with only continuum flux limited selection techniques. We compare the\n(SED fitting-derived) main sequence of star-formation (MS) of our sample to\nprevious works and find that it has a steeper slope than that of samples of\nmore massive galaxies. We conclude that the MS steepens at lower (below\n$M_{\\star} = 10^{9.4} M_{\\odot}$) galaxy masses. We also show that the SFR at\nany redshift is higher in our sample. We attribute this to the targeted\nselection of galaxies with large emission line equivalent widths, and conclude\nthat our sample presumably forms the upper boundary of the MS. We briefly\ninvestigate and outline how samples with accurate redshifts down to those low\nstellar masses open a new window to study the formation of large scale\nstructure in the early universe. In particular we report on the detection of a\nyoung galaxy cluster at $z=1.85$ which features a central massive galaxy which\nis the candidate of an early stage cD galaxy, and we identify a likely filament\nmapped out by $[$OIII$]$ and $H\\beta$ emitting galaxies at $z=1.15$.\n", "  We derive an exact solution belonging to Kundt class of spacetimes both with\nand without a cosmological constant that are minimally coupled to a free\nmassless scalar field. We show the algebraic type of these solutions and give\ninterpretation of the results. Subsequently, we look for solutions additionally\ncontaining an electromagnetic field satisfying nonlinear field equations.\n", "  We present deep 10h VLT/XSHOOTER spectroscopy for an extraordinarily luminous\nand extended Lya emitter at z=6.595 referred to as Himiko and first discussed\nby Ouchi et al. (2009), with the purpose of constraining the mechanisms\npowering its strong emission. Complementary to the spectrum, we discuss NIR\nimaging data from the CANDELS survey. We find neither for HeII nor any metal\nline a significant excess, with 3 sigma upper limits of 6.8, 3.1, and\n5.8x10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2 for CIV $\\lambda$1549, HeII $\\lambda$1640, CIII]\n$\\lambda$1909, respectively, assuming apertures with 200 km/s widths and offset\nby -250 km/s w.r.t to the peak Lya redshift. These limits provide strong\nevidence that an AGN is not a major contribution to Himiko's Lya flux. Strong\nconclusions about the presence of PopIII star-formation or gravitational\ncooling radiation are not possible based on the obtained HeII upper limit. Our\nLya spectrum confirms both spatial extent and flux (8.8+/-0.5x10^{-17}\nerg/s/cm^2) of previous measurements. In addition, we can unambiguously exclude\nany remaining chance of it being a lower redshift interloper by significantly\ndetecting a continuum redwards of Lya, while being undetected bluewards.\n", "  Not much by themselves, aparently.\n  We try to reconstruct the scale factor $a(t)$ of the universe from the SNe Ia\ndata, i.e. the luminosity distance $d_{L}(z)$, using only the cosmological\nprinciple and the assumption that gravitation is governed by a metric theory.\nIn our hence \"model-independent,\" or \"cosmographic\" study, we fit functions to\n$d_{L}(z)$ rather than $a(t)$, since $d_{L}(z)$ is what is measured. We find\nthat the acceleration history of the universe cannot be reliably determined in\nthis approach due to the irregularity and parametrization-dependence of the\nresults.\n  However, adding the GRB data to the dataset cures most of the irregularities,\nat the cost of compromising the model-independent nature of the study slightly.\nThen we can determine the redshift of transition to cosmic acceleration as\n$z_{\\rm t} \\sim 0.50 \\pm 0.09$ for a flat universe (larger for positive spatial\ncurvature).\n  If Einstein gravity (GR) is assumed, we find a redshift at which the density\nof the universe predicted from the $d_{L}(z)$ data is independent of curvature.\nWe use this point to derive an upper limit on matter density, hence a lower\nlimit on the density of dark energy. While these limits do not improve the\ngenerally accepted ones, they are derived *only using the $d_{L}(z)$ data*.\n", "  We have analysed a sample of 574 Spitzer 4.5 micron-selected galaxies with\n[4.5]<23 and Ks_auto>24 (AB) over the UltraVISTA ultra-deep COSMOS field. Our\naim is to investigate whether these mid-IR bright, near-IR faint sources\ncontribute significantly to the overall population of massive galaxies at\nredshifts z>=3. By performing a spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis\nusing up to 30 photometric bands, we have determined that the redshift\ndistribution of our sample peaks at redshifts z~2.5-3.0, and ~32% of the\ngalaxies lie at z>=3. We have studied the contribution of these sources to the\ngalaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high redshifts. We found that the\n[4.5]<23, Ks_auto>24 galaxies produce a negligible change to the GSMF\npreviously determined for Ks_auto<24 sources at 3=<z<4, but their contribution\nis more important at 4=<z<5, accounting for >~50% of the galaxies with stellar\nmasses Mst>~6 x 10^10 Msun. We also constrained the GSMF at the highest-mass\nend (Mst>~2 x 10^11 Msun) at z>=5. From their presence at 5=<z<6, and virtual\nabsence at higher redshifts, we can pinpoint quite precisely the moment of\nappearance of the first most massive galaxies as taking place in the ~0.2 Gyr\nof elapsed time between z~6 and z~5. Alternatively, if very massive galaxies\nexisted earlier in cosmic time, they should have been significantly\ndust-obscured to lie beyond the detection limits of current, large-area, deep\nnear-IR surveys.\n", "  The richness of 5d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theories with a UV fixed point at infinite\ncoupling is due to the existence of local disorder operators known as instanton\noperators. By considering the Higgs branch of $SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_f\n\\leq 7$ flavours at finite and infinite coupling, we write down the explicit\nchiral ring relations between instanton operators, the glueball superfield and\nmesons. Exciting phenomena appear at infinite coupling: the glueball superfield\nis no longer nilpotent and the classical chiral ring relations are quantum\ncorrected by instanton operators bilinears. We also find expressions for the\ndressing of instanton operators of arbitrary charge. The same analysis is\nperformed for $USp(2k)$ with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet and pure $SU(N)$\ngauge theories.\n", "  We present a stronger version of the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS)\nhierarchy of approximations for the set of separable states. Unlike DPS, our\nhierarchy converges exactly at a finite number of rounds for any fixed input\ndimension. This yields an algorithm for separability testing which is singly\nexponential in dimension and polylogarithmic in accuracy. Our analysis makes\nuse of tools from algebraic geometry, but our algorithm is elementary and\ndiffers from DPS only by one simple additional collection of constraints.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of a red quasar at z=2.32 with an intervening\ndamped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at z=2.13. Using high quality data from the\nX-shooter spectrograph at ESO Very Large Telescope we find that the absorber\nhas a metallicity consistent with Solar. We observe strong C I and H$_2$\nabsorption indicating a cold, dense absorbing medium. Partial coverage effects\nare observed in the C I lines, from which we infer a covering fraction of $27\n\\pm 6$ % and a physical diameter of the cloud of 0.1 pc. From the covering\nfraction and size, we estimate the size of the background quasar's broad line\nregion. We search for emission from the DLA counterpart in optical and\nnear-infrared imaging. No emission is observed in the optical data. However, we\nsee tentative evidence for a counterpart in the H and K' band images. The DLA\nshows high depletion (as probed by [Fe/Zn]=-1.22) indicating that significant\namounts of dust must be present in the DLA. By fitting the spectrum with\nvarious dust reddened quasar templates we find a best-fitting amount of dust in\nthe DLA of $A(V)_{\\rm DLA}=0.28 \\pm 0.01|_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.07|_{\\rm sys}$. We\nconclude that dust in the DLA is causing the colours of this intrinsically very\nluminous background quasar to appear much redder than average quasars, thereby\nnot fulfilling the criteria for quasar identification in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. Such chemically enriched and dusty absorbers are thus underrepresented\nin current samples of DLAs.\n", "  We report the early discovery of the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst\n(GRB) 140801A in the 137 deg$^2$ 3-$\\sigma$ error-box of the Fermi Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM). MASTER is the only observatory that automatically react to\nall Fermi alerts. GRB 140801A is one of the few GRBs whose optical counterpart\nwas discovered solely from its GBM localization. The optical afterglow of GRB\n140801A was found by MASTER Global Robotic Net 53 sec after receiving the\nalert, making it the fastest optical detection of a GRB from a GBM error-box.\nSpectroscopy obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the 6-m BTA\nof SAO RAS reveals a redshift of $z=1.32$. We performed optical and\nnear-infrared photometry of GRB 140801A using different telescopes with\napertures ranging from 0.4-m to 10.4-m. GRB 140801A is a typical burst in many\nways. The rest-frame bolometric isotropic energy release and peak energy of the\nburst is $E_\\mathrm{iso} = 5.54_{-0.24}^{+0.26} \\times 10^{52}$ erg and\n$E_\\mathrm{p, rest}\\simeq280$ keV, respectively, which is consistent with the\nAmati relation. The absence of a jet break in the optical light curve provides\na lower limit on the half-opening angle of the jet $\\theta=6.1$ deg. The\nobserved $E_\\mathrm{peak}$ is consistent with the limit derived from the\nGhirlanda relation. The joint Fermi GBM and Konus-Wind analysis shows that GRB\n140801A could belong to the class of intermediate duration. The rapid detection\nof the optical counterpart of GRB 140801A is especially important regarding the\nupcoming experiments with large coordinate error-box areas.\n", "  We study collective amplitude modes of the superconducting order parameter in\nstrongly-coupled electron-phonon systems described by the Holstein model using\nthe nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory with the self-consistent Migdal\napproximation as an impurity solver. The frequency of the Higgs amplitude mode\nis found to coincide with the superconducting gap even in the strongly-coupled\n(beyond BCS) regime. Besides the Higgs mode, we unravel another collective mode\ninvolving the dynamics of both the phonons and the superconducting order\nparameter. The frequency of this mode, higher than twice the renormalized\nphonon frequency in the superconducting phase, is shown to reflect a strong\nelectron-mediated phonon-phonon interaction. Both types of collective\nexcitations contribute to time-resolved photoemission spectra after a strong\nlaser pump as vertex corrections to produce resonance peaks, which allows one\nto distinguish them from quasiparticle excitations.\n", "  We study the secular dynamics of compact binaries (consisting of white\ndwarfs, neutron stars or black holes) with tertiary companions in hierarchical\ntriple systems. As the inner binary (with initially negligible eccentricity)\nundergoes orbital decay due to gravitational radiation, its eccentricity can be\nexcited by gravitational forcing from the tertiary. This excitation occurs when\nthe triple system passes through an \"apsidal precession resonance\", when the\nprecession rate of the inner binary, driven by the gravitational perturbation\nof the external companion and general relativity, matches the precession rate\nof the outer binary. The eccentricity excitation requires the outer companion\nto be on an eccentric orbit, with the mutual inclination between the inner and\nouter orbits less than $\\sim 40^\\circ$. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from\nthe inner binary can be significantly modified as the system evolves through\nthe apsidal precession resonance. For some system parameters (e.g., a white\ndwarf binary with a brown dwarf tertiary), the resonance can happen when the\nbinary emits GWs in the $10^{-4}-10^{-1}$~Hz range (the sensitivity band of\nLISA).\n", "  In calculations of gravitational collapse to form black holes, trapping\nhorizons (foliated by marginally trapped surfaces) make their first appearance\neither within the collapsing matter or where it joins on to a vacuum exterior.\nThose which then move outwards with respect to the matter have been proposed\nfor use in defining black holes, replacing the global concept of an \"event\nhorizon\" which has some serious drawbacks for practical applications. We here\npresent results from a study of the properties of both outgoing and ingoing\ntrapping horizons, assuming strict spherical symmetry throughout. We have\ninvestigated their causal nature (i.e. whether they are spacelike, timelike or\nnull), making contact with the Misner-Sharp- Hernandez formalism, which has\noften been used for numerical calculations of spherical collapse. We follow two\ndifferent approaches, one using a geometrical quantity related to expansions of\nnull geodesic congruences, and the other using the horizon velocity measured\nwith respect to the collapsing matter. After an introduction to these concepts,\nwe then implement them within numerical simulations of stellar collapse,\nrevisiting pioneering calculations from the 1960s where some features of the\nemergence and subsequent behaviour of trapping horizons could already be seen.\nOur presentation here is aimed firmly at \"real world\" applications of interest\nto astrophysicists and includes the effects of pressure, which may be important\nfor the asymptotic behaviour of the ingoing horizon.\n", "  We investigate the two-dimensional four-color Ashkin-Teller model by means of\nlarge-scale Monte-Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that the first-order phase\ntransition of the clean system is destroyed by random disorder introduced via\nsite dilution. The critical behavior of the emerging continuous transition\nbelongs to the clean two-dimensional Ising universality class, apart from\nlogarithmic corrections. These results confirm perturbative\nrenormalization-group predictions; they also agree with recent findings for the\nthree-color case, indicating that the critical behavior is universal.\n", "  The Dirac and Weyl semimetals are unusual materials in which the nodes of the\nbulk states are protected against gap formation by crystalline symmetry. The\nchiral anomaly~\\cite{Adler,Bell}, predicted to occur in both systems, was\nrecently observed as a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) in\nNa$_3$Bi and in TaAs. An important issue is whether Weyl physics appears in a\nbroader class of materials. We report evidence for the chiral anomaly in the\nhalf-Heusler GdPtBi. In zero field, GdPtBi is a zero-gap semiconductor with\nquadratic bands. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman energy leads to Weyl nodes. We\nhave observed a large negative LMR with the field-steering properties specific\nto the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly also induces strong suppression of\nthe thermopower. We report a detailed study of the thermoelectric response\nfunction $\\alpha_{xx}$ of Weyl fermions. The scheme of creating Weyl nodes from\nquadratic bands suggests that the chiral anomaly may be observable in a broad\nclass of semimetals.\n", "  We apply a discrete quantum walk from a quantum particle on a discrete\nquantum spacetime from loop quantum gravity and show that the related\nEntanglement Entropy can drive a entropic force. We apply this concepts to\npropose a model of a walker position topologically encoded on a spin network.\n", "  We study the extent to which very bright (-23.0 < MUV < -21.75) Lyman-break\nselected galaxies at redshifts z~7 display detectable Lya emission. To explore\nthis issue, we have obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of 9 z~7 galaxies\nfrom a parent sample of 24 z~7 galaxy candidates selected from the 1.65 sq.deg\nCOSMOS-UltraVISTA and SXDS-UDS survey fields using the latest near-infrared\npublic survey data, and new ultra-deep Subaru z'-band imaging (which we also\npresent and describe in this paper). Our spectroscopy has yielded only one\npossible detection of Lya at z=7.168 with a rest-frame equivalent width EW_0 =\n3.7 (+1.7/-1.1) Angstrom. The relative weakness of this line, combined with our\nfailure to detect Lya emission from the other spectroscopic targets allows us\nto place a new upper limit on the prevalence of strong Lya emission at these\nredshifts. For conservative calculation and to facilitate comparison with\nprevious studies at lower redshifts, we derive a 1-sigma upper limit on the\nfraction of UV bright galaxies at z~7 that display EW_0 > 50 Angstrom, which we\nestimate to be < 0.23. This result may indicate a weak trend where the fraction\nof strong Lya emitters ceases to rise, and possibly falls between z~6 and z~7.\nOur results also leave open the possibility that strong Lya may still be more\nprevalent in the brightest galaxies in the reionization era than their fainter\ncounterparts. A larger spectroscopic sample of galaxies is required to derive a\nmore reliable constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction at z~7 based on the\nLya fraction in the bright galaxies.\n", "  We present the COSMOS2015 catalog which contains precise photometric\nredshifts and stellar masses for more than half a million objects over the\n2deg$^{2}$ COSMOS field. Including new $YJHK_{\\rm s}$ images from the\nUltraVISTA-DR2 survey, $Y$-band from Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam and infrared data\nfrom the Spitzer Large Area Survey with the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Spitzer legacy\nprogram, this near-infrared-selected catalog is highly optimized for the study\nof galaxy evolution and environments in the early Universe. To maximise catalog\ncompleteness for bluer objects and at higher redshifts, objects have been\ndetected on a $\\chi^{2}$ sum of the $YJHK_{\\rm s}$ and $z^{++}$ images. The\ncatalog contains $\\sim 6\\times 10^5$ objects in the 1.5 deg$^{2}$\nUltraVISTA-DR2 region, and $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^5$ objects are detected in the\n\"ultra-deep stripes\" (0.62 deg$^{2}$) at $K_{\\rm s}\\leq 24.7$ (3$\\sigma$, 3\",\nAB magnitude). Through a comparison with the zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic\nredshifts, we measure a photometric redshift precision of $\\sigma_{\\Delta\nz/(1+z_s)}$ = 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction of $\\eta=0.5$%. At\n$3<z<6$, using the unique database of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, we\nfind $\\sigma_{\\Delta z/(1+z_s)}$ = 0.021 and $\\eta=13.2\\% $. The deepest\nregions reach a 90\\% completeness limit of 10$^{10}M_\\odot$ to $z=4$. Detailed\ncomparisons of the color distributions, number counts, and clustering show\nexcellent agreement with the literature in the same mass ranges. COSMOS2015\nrepresents a unique, publicly available, valuable resource with which to\ninvestigate the evolution of galaxies within their environment back to the\nearliest stages of the history of the Universe. The COSMOS2015 catalog is\ndistributed via anonymous ftp\n(ftp://ftp.iap.fr/pub/from_users/hjmcc/COSMOS2015/) and through the usual\nastronomical archive systems (CDS, ESO Phase 3, IRSA).\n", "  Continuous-time open quantum walks (CTOQW) are introduced as the formulation\nof quantum dynamical semigroups of trace-preserving and completely positive\nlinear maps (or quantum Markov semigroups) on graphs. We show that a CTOQW\nalways converges to a steady state regardless of the initial state when a graph\nis connected. When the graph is both connected and regular, it is shown that\nthe steady state is the maximally mixed state. As shown by the examples in this\narticle, the steady states of CTOQW can be very unusual and complicated even\nthough the underlying graphs are simple. The examples demonstrate that the\nstructure of a graph can affect quantum coherence in CTOQW through a long time\nrun. Precisely, the quantum coherence persists throughout the evolution of the\nCTOQW when the underlying topology is certain irregular graphs (such as a path\nor a star as shown in the examples). In contrast, the quantum coherence will\neventually vanish from the open quantum system when the underlying topology is\na regular graph (such as a cycle).\n", "  Magnetic recording using circularly polarized femto-second laser pulses is an\nemerging technology that would allow write speeds much faster than existing\nfield driven methods. However, the mechanism that drives the magnetization\nswitching in ferromagnets is unclear. Recent theories suggest that the\ninteraction of the light with the magnetized media induces an opto-magnetic\nfield within the media, known as the inverse Faraday effect. Here we show that\nan alternative mechanism, driven by thermal excitation over the anisotropy\nenergy barrier and a difference in the energy absorption depending on\npolarization, can create a net magnetization over a series of laser pulses in\nan ensemble of single domain grains. Only a small difference in the absorption\nis required to reach magnetization levels observed experimentally and the model\ndoes not preclude the role of the inverse Faraday effect but removes the\nnecessity that the opto-magnetic field is 10s of Tesla in strength.\n", "  It has been increasingly becoming clear that Casimir and Casimir-Polder\nentropies may be negative in certain regions of temperature and separation. In\nfact, the occurrence of negative entropy seems to be a nearly ubiquitous\nphenomenon. This is most highlighted in the quantum vacuum interaction of a\nnanoparticle with a conducting plate or between two nanoparticles. It has been\nargued that this phenomenon does not violate physical intuition, since the\ntotal entropy, including the self-entropies of the plate and the nanoparticle,\nshould be positive. New calculations, in fact, seem to bear this out at least\nin certain cases.\n", "  We derive the general form of the non-trivial geometric phase resulting from\nthe unique combination of point group and time reversal symmetries. This phase\narises e.g. when a magnetic adatom is adsorbed on a non-magnetic C$_n$ crystal\nsurface, where $n$ denotes the fold of the principal axis. The energetic\nordering and the relevant quantum numbers of the eigenstates are entirely\ndetermined by this quantity. Moreover, this phase allows to conveniently\npredict the protection mechanism of any prepared state, shedding light onto a\nlarge number of experiments and allowing a classification scheme. Owing to its\nrobustness this geometric phase also has great relevance for a large number of\napplications in quantum computing, where topologically protected states bearing\nlong relaxation times are highly desired.\n", "  We analyze the creation and emission of pairs of highly nonclassical\nmicrowave photons in a setup where a voltage-biased Josephson junction is\nconnected in series to two electromagnetic oscillators. Tuning the external\nvoltage such that the Josephson frequency equals the sum of the two mode\nfrequencies, each tunneling Cooper pair creates one additional photon in both\nof the two oscillators. The time-resolved statistics of photon emission events\nfrom the two oscillators is investigated by means of single- and\ncross-oscillator variants of the second-order correlation function\n$g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ and the waiting-time distribution $w(\\tau)$. They provide\ninsight into the strongly correlated quantum dynamics of the two oscillator\nsubsystems and reveal a rich variety of quantum features of light including\nstrong antibunching and the presence of negative values in the Wigner function.\n", "  We have developed a deterministic conservative solver for the inhomogeneous\nFokker-Planck-Landau equation coupled with the Poisson equation, which is a\n{classical mean-field} primary model for collisional plasmas. Two subproblems,\ni.e. the Vlasov-Poisson problem and homogeneous Landau problem, are obtained\nthrough time-splitting methods, and treated separately by the Runge-Kutta\nDiscontinuous Galerkin method and a conservative spectral method, respectively.\nTo ensure conservation when projecting between the two different computing\ngrids, a special conservation routine is designed to link the solutions of\nthese two subproblems. This conservation routine accurately enforces\nconservation of moments in Fourier space. The entire numerical scheme is\nimplemented with parallelization with hybrid MPI and OpenMP. Numerical\nexperiments are provided to study linear and nonlinear Landau Damping problems\nand two-stream flow problem as well.\n", "  We present the first X-ray reflection model for testing the assumption that\nthe metric of astrophysical black holes is described by the Kerr solution. We\nemploy the formalism of the transfer function proposed by Cunningham. The\ncalculations of the reflection spectrum of a thin accretion disk are split into\ntwo parts: the calculation of the transfer function and the calculation of the\nlocal spectrum at any emission point in the disk. The transfer function only\ndepends on the background metric and takes into account all the relativistic\neffects (gravitational redshift, Doppler boosting, and light bending). Our code\ncomputes the transfer function for a spacetime described by the Johannsen\nmetric and can easily be extended to any stationary, axisymmetric, and\nasymptotically flat spacetime. Transfer functions and single line shapes in the\nKerr metric are compared with those calculated from existing codes to check\nthat we reach the necessary accuracy. We also simulate some observations with\nNuSTAR and LAD/eXTP and fit the data with our new model to show the potential\ncapabilities of current and future observations to constrain possible\ndeviations from the Kerr metric.\n", "  Recently, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) has helped\nresearchers advance the emerging field of magnetic skyrmions. These magnetic\nquasi-particles, composed of topologically non-trivial magnetization textures,\nhave a large potential for application as information carriers in low-power\nmemory and logic devices. LTEM is one of a very few techniques for direct real\nspace imaging of magnetic features at the nanoscale. For Fresnel-contrast LTEM,\nthe transport of intensity equation (TIE) is the tool of choice for\nquantitative reconstruction of the local magnetic induction through the sample\nthickness. Typically this analysis requires collection of at least three\nimages.Here we show that for uniform thin magnetic films which includes many\nskyrmionic samples, the magnetic induction can be quantitatively determined\nfrom a single defocused image using a simplified TIE approach.\n", "  We present the results of a new spectroscopic survey for dusty intervening\nabsorption systems, particularly damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs), towards\nreddened quasars. The candidate quasars are selected from mid-infrared\nphotometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer combined with optical\nand near-infrared photometry. Out of 1073 candidates, we secure low-resolution\nspectra for 108 using the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, Spain. Based on\nthe spectra, we are able to classify 100 of the 108 targets as quasars. A large\nfraction (50 %) is observed to have broad absorption lines (BALs). Moreover, we\nfind 6 quasars with strange breaks in their spectra, which are not consistent\nwith regular dust reddening. Using template fitting we infer the amount of\nreddening along each line of sight ranging from A(V)$\\approx$0.1 mag to 1.2 mag\n(assuming an SMC extinction curve). In four cases, the reddening is consistent\nwith dust exhibiting the 2175{\\AA} feature caused by an intervening absorber,\nand for two of these, a MgII absorption system is observed at the best-fit\nabsorption redshift. In the rest of the cases, the reddening is most likely\nintrinsic to the quasar. We observe no evidence for dusty DLAs in this survey.\nHowever, the large fraction of BAL quasars hampers the detection of absorption\nsystems. Out of the 50 non-BAL quasars only 28 have sufficiently high redshift\nto detect Ly$\\alpha$ in absorption.\n", "  Gamma strength functions (GSFs) and level densities (LDs) are essential\ningredients of statistical nuclear reaction theory with many applications in\nastrophysics, reactor design, and waste transmutation. The aim of the present\nwork is a test of systematic parametrizations of the GSF recommended by the\nRIPL-3 data base for the case of $^{208}$Pb. The upward GSF and LD in\n$^{208}$Pb are compared to gamma decay data from an Oslo-type experiment to\nexamine the validity of the Brink-Axel (BA) hypothesis. The E1 and M1 parts of\nthe total GSF are determined from high-resolution forward angle inelastic\nproton scattering data taken at 295 MeV at RCNP, Osaka, Japan. The total LD in\n$^{208}$Pb is derived from the $1^-$ LD extracted with a fluctuation analysis\nin the energy region of the isovector giant dipole resonance. The E1 GSF is\ncompared to parametrizations recommended by the RIPL-3 data base showing\nsystematic deficiencies of all models in the energy region around neutron\nthreshold. The new data for the poorly known spinflip M1 resonance call for a\nsubstantial revision of the model suggested in RIPL-3. The total GSF derived\nfrom the present data is larger in the PDR energy region than the Oslo data but\nthe strong fluctuations due to the low LD resulting from the double shell\nclosure of $^{208}$Pb prevent a conclusion on a possible violation of the BA\nhypothesis. Using the parameters suggested by RIPL-3 for a description of the\nLD in $^{208}$Pb with the back-shifted Fermi gas model, remarkable agreement\nbetween the two experiments spanning a wide excitation energy range is\nobtained. Systematic parametrizations of the E1 and M1 GSF parts need to be\nreconsidered at low excitation energies. The good agreement of LD provides an\nindependent confirmation of the approach underlying the decomposition of GSF\nand LDs in Oslo-type experiments.\n", "  There are a number of different strategies to measure the phase shift between\ntwo pathways of light more efficiently than suggested by the standard quantum\nlimit. One way is to use highly entangled photons. Another way is to expose\nphotons to a non-linear or interacting Hamiltonian. This paper emphasises that\nthe conditional dynamics of open quantum systems provides an interesting\nadditional tool for quantum-enhanced metrology. As a concrete example, we\nreview a recent scheme which exploits the conditional dynamics of a\nlaser-driven optical cavity with spontaneous photon emission inside a quantum\nfeedback loop. Deducing information from second-order photon correlation\nmeasurements requires neither optical non-linearities nor entangled photons and\nshould therefore be of immediate practical interest.\n", "  We present the extensive follow-up campaign on the afterglow of GRB 110715A\nat 17 different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio bands, starting 81 seconds\nafter the burst and extending up to 74 days later. We performed for the first\ntime a GRB afterglow observation with the ALMA observatory. We find that the\nafterglow of GRB 110715A is very bright at optical and radio wavelengths. We\nuse optical and near infrared spectroscopy to provide further information about\nthe progenitor's environment and its host galaxy. The spectrum shows weak\nabsorption features at a redshift z = 0.8225, which reveal a host galaxy\nenvironment with low ionization, column density and dynamical activity. Late\ndeep imaging shows a very faint galaxy, consistent with the spectroscopic\nresults. The broadband afterglow emission is modelled with synchrotron\nradiation using a numerical algorithm and we determine the best fit parameters\nusing Bayesian inference in order to constrain the physical parameters of the\njet and the medium in which the relativistic shock propagates. We fitted our\ndata with a variety of models, including different density profiles and energy\ninjections. Although the general behaviour can be roughly described by these\nmodels, none of them are able to fully explain all data points simultaneously.\nGRB 110715A shows the complexity of reproducing extensive multi-wavelength\nbroadband afterglow observations, and the need of good sampling in wavelength\nand time and more complex models to accurately constrain the physics of GRB\nafterglows.\n", "  We show that the relaxion generically stops its rolling at a point that\nbreaks CP leading to relaxion-Higgs mixing. This opens the door to a variety of\nobservational probes since the possible relaxion mass spans a broad range from\nsub-eV to the GeV scale. We derive constraints from current experiments (fifth\nforce, astrophysical and cosmological probes, beam dump, flavour, LEP and LHC)\nand present projections from future experiments such as NA62, SHiP and PIXIE.\nWe find that a large region of the parameter space is already under the\nexperimental scrutiny. All the experimental constraints we derive are equally\napplicable for general Higgs portal models. In addition, we show that simple\nmultiaxion (clockwork) UV completions suffer from a mild fine tuning problem,\nwhich increases with the number of sites. These results favour a cut-off scale\nlower than the existing theoretical bounds.\n", "  We present a single-source dual atom interferometer and utilize it as a\ngradiometer for precise gravitational measurements. The macroscopic separation\nbetween interfering atomic wave packets (as large as 16 cm) reveals the\ninterplay of recoil effects and gravitational curvature from a nearby Pb source\nmass. The gradiometer baseline is set by the laser wavelength and pulse\ntimings, which can be measured to high precision. Using a long drift time and\nlarge momentum transfer atom optics, the gradiometer reaches a resolution of $3\n\\times 10^{-9}$ s$^{-2}$ per shot and measures a 1 rad phase shift induced by\nthe source mass.\n", "  The field theory Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) kernel, which relates scattering\namplitudes of gravitons and gluons, turns out to be the inverse of a matrix\nwhose components are bi-adjoint scalar partial amplitudes. In this note we\npropose an analogous construction for the string theory KLT kernel. We present\nsimple diagrammatic rules for the computation of the $\\alpha'$-corrected\nbi-adjoint scalar amplitudes that are exact in $\\alpha'$. We find compact\nexpressions in terms of graphs, where the standard Feynman propagators $1/p^2$\nare replaced by either $1/\\sin (\\pi \\alpha' p^2/2)$ or $1/\\tan (\\pi \\alpha'\np^2/2)$, as determined by a recursive procedure. We demonstrate how the same\nobject can be used to conveniently expand open string partial amplitudes in a\nBCJ basis.\n", "  The announcement of a quantum computer that can be accessed remotely by\nanyone from its laptop is a big event for the quantum computation scientist. In\nthis work we present the International Business Machines (IBM) quantum computer\nand its platform IBM Quantum Experience (IBM-QE) as a didactic proposal in\nquantum computation and information. In addition we also consider this paper as\nscientific divulgation of the IMB advertisement. In this paper we show the main\ntool (quantum gates) present in the IBM-QE and, through a simple strategy, we\ndiscuss about a possible decoherence source in the IBM 5 q-bit chips. As an\nexample of application of our study, we show how to implement the quantum\nteleportation using the IBM-QE.\n", "  The quasar Q0918+1636 (z=3.07) has an intervening high-metallicity Damped\nLyman-alpha Absorber (DLA) along the line of sight, at a redshift of z=2.58.\nThe DLA is located at a large impact parameter of 16.2 kpc, and has an almost\nsolar metallicity. It is shown, that a novel type of cosmological galaxy\nformation models, invoking a new SNII feedback prescription, the Haardt & Madau\n(2012) UVB field and explicit treatment of UVB self-shielding, can reproduce\nthe observed characteristics of the DLA. UV radiation from young stellar\npopulations in the galaxy, in particular in the photon energy range 10.36-13.61\neV (relating to Sulfur II abundance), are also considered in the analysis. It\nis found that a) for L~L* galaxies (at z=2.58), about 10% of the sight-lines\nthrough the galaxies at impact parameter 16.2 kpc will display a Sulfur II\ncolumn density N(SII)$>$ 10$^{15.82}$ cm$^{-2}$ (the observed value for the\nDLA), and b) considering only cases where a near-solar metallicity will be\ndetected at 16.2 kpc impact parameter, the probability distribution of galaxy\nSFR peaks near the value observed for the DLA galaxy counterpart of ~27\nMsun/yr. It is argued, that the bulk of the alpha-elements, like Sulfur, traced\nby the high metal column density, b=16.2 kpc absorption lines, were produced by\nevolving young stars in the inner galaxy, and later transported outward by\ngalactic winds.\n", "  We propose a scheme to deal with certain time-dependent non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian operators $H(t)$ that generate a real phase in their\ntime-evolution. This involves the use of invariant operators $I_{PH}(t)$ that\nare pseudo-Hermitian with respect to the time-dependent metric operator, which\nimplies that the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. Furthermore,\n$H(t)$ is not generally quasi-Hermitian and does not define an observable of\nthe system but $I_{PH}(t)$ obeys a quasi-hermiticity transformation as in the\ncompletely time-independent Hamiltonian systems case. The harmonic oscillator\nwith a time-dependent frequency under the action of a complex time-dependent\nlinear potential is considered as an illustrative example.\n", "  When measuring a time-varying phase, the standard quantum limit and\nHeisenberg limit as usually defined, for a constant phase, do not apply. If the\nphase has Gaussian statistics and a power-law spectrum $1/|\\omega|^p$ with\n$p>1$, then the generalized standard quantum limit and Heisenberg limit have\nrecently been found to have scalings of $1/{\\cal N}^{(p-1)/p}$ and $1/{\\cal\nN}^{2(p-1)/(p+1)}$, respectively, where ${\\cal N}$ is the mean photon flux. We\nshow that this Heisenberg scaling can be achieved via adaptive measurements on\nsqueezed states. We predict the experimental parameters analytically, and test\nthem with numerical simulations. Previous work had considered the special case\nof $p=2$.\n", "  Recent theoretical studies of topologically nontrivial electronic states in\nKondo insulators have pointed to the importance of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nfor stabilizing these states. However, systematic experimental studies that\ntune the SOC parameter $\\lambda_{\\rm{SOC}}$ in Kondo insulators remain elusive.\nThe main reason is that variations of (chemical) pressure or doping strongly\ninfluence the Kondo coupling $J_{\\text{K}}$ and the chemical potential $\\mu$ --\nboth essential parameters determining the ground state of the material -- and\nthus possible $\\lambda_{\\rm{SOC}}$ tuning effects have remained unnoticed. Here\nwe present the successful growth of the substitution series\nCe$_3$Bi$_4$(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_3$ ($0 \\le x \\le 1$) of the archetypal\n(noncentrosymmetric) Kondo insulator Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$. The Pt-Pd substitution\nis isostructural, isoelectronic, and isosize, and therefore likely to leave\n$J_{\\text{K}}$ and $\\mu$ essentially unchanged. By contrast, the large mass\ndifference between the $5d$ element Pt and the $4d$ element Pd leads to a large\ndifference in $\\lambda_{\\rm{SOC}}$, which thus is the dominating tuning\nparameter in the series. Surprisingly, with increasing $x$ (decreasing\n$\\lambda_{\\rm{SOC}}$), we observe a Kondo insulator to semimetal transition,\ndemonstrating an unprecedented drastic influence of the SOC. The fully\nsubstituted end compound Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ shows thermodynamic signatures of a\nrecently predicted Weyl-Kondo semimetal.\n", "  Instability of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites hinders their\ndevelopment for photovoltaic applications. First-principle calculations are\nused for evaluation of a decomposition reaction enthalpy of hybrid halide\nperovskites, which is linked to experimentally observed degradation of device\ncharacteristics. However, simple criteria for predicting stability of halide\nperovskites are lacking since Goldschmidt's tolerance and octahedral\ngeometrical factors do not fully capture formability of those perovskites. In\nthis paper, we extend the Born-Haber cycle to partition the reaction enthalpy\nof various perovskite structures into lattice, ionization, and molecularization\nenergy components. The analysis of various contributions to the reaction\nenthalpy points to an ionization energy of a molecule and a cage as an\nadditional criterion for predicting chemical trends in stability of hybrid\nhalide perovskites. Prospects of finding new perovskite structures with\nimproved chemical stability aimed for photovoltaic applications are discussed.\n", "  We propose a simple method to estimate the central charge of the conformal\nfield theory corresponding to a critical point of a two-dimensional lattice\nmodel from Monte Carlo simulations. The main idea is to use the Wang-Landau\nflat-histogram algorithm, which allows us to obtain the free energy of a\nlattice model on a torus as a function of torus radii. The central charge is\ncalculated with a good precision from a free energy scaling at the critical\npoint. We apply the method to the Ising, tricritical Ising (Blume-Capel), Potts\nand site-diluted Ising models, and also discuss estimation of conformal\nweights.\n", "  The strong interaction between individual Rydberg atoms provides a powerful\ntool exploited in an ever-growing range of applications in quantum information\nscience, quantum simulation, and ultracold chemistry. One hallmark of the\nRydberg interaction is that both its strength and angular dependence can be\nfine-tuned with great flexibility by choosing appropriate Rydberg states and\napplying external electric and magnetic fields. More and more experiments are\nprobing this interaction at short atomic distances or with such high precision\nthat perturbative calculations as well as restrictions to the leading\ndipole-dipole interaction term are no longer sufficient. In this tutorial, we\nreview all relevant aspects of the full calculation of Rydberg interaction\npotentials. We discuss the derivation of the interaction Hamiltonian from the\nelectrostatic multipole expansion, numerical and analytical methods for\ncalculating the required electric multipole moments, and the inclusion of\nelectromagnetic fields with arbitrary direction. We focus specifically on\nsymmetry arguments and selection rules, which greatly reduce the size of the\nHamiltonian matrix, enabling the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian up\nto higher multipole orders on a desktop computer. Finally, we present example\ncalculations showing the relevance of the full interaction calculation to\ncurrent experiments. Our software for calculating Rydberg potentials including\nall features discussed in this tutorial is available as open source.\n", "  We observe nonlinear scattering of 39 K atomic bright solitons launched in a\none-dimensional (1D) speckle disorder. We directly compare it with the\nscattering of non-interacting particles in the same disorder. The atoms in the\nsoliton tend to be collectively either reflected or transmitted, in contrast\nwith the behavior of independent particles, thus demonstrating a clear\nnonlinear effect in scattering. The observed strong fluctuations in the\nreflected fraction, between zero and 100%, are interpreted as a consequence of\nthe strong sensitivity of the system to the experimental conditions and in\nparticular to the soliton velocity. This behavior is reproduced in a mean-field\nframework by Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, and mesoscopic quantum\nsuperpositions of the soliton being fully reflected and fully transmitted are\nnot expected for our parameters. We discuss the conditions for observing such\nsuperpositions, which would find applications in atom interferometry beyond the\nstandard quantum limit.\n", "  In exactly solvable quantum-mechanical systems, ladder and intertwining\noperators play a central role because, if they are found, the energy spectra\ncan be obtained algebraically. In this paper, we propose the spectral\nintertwining relation as a unified relation of ladder and intertwining\noperators in a way that can depend on the energy eigenvalues. It is shown that\nthe spectral intertwining relations can connect eigenfunctions of different\nenergy eigenvalues belonging to two different Hamiltonians, which cannot be\nobtained by previously known structures such as shape invariance. As an\napplication, we find new spectral intertwining operators for the Hamiltonians\nof the hydrogen atom and the Rosen--Morse potential.\n", "  The antiproton-to-proton ratio in the cosmic-ray spectrum is a sensitive\nprobe of new physics. Using recent measurements of the cosmic-ray antiproton\nand proton fluxes in the energy range of 1-1000 GeV, we study the contribution\nto the $\\bar{p}/p$ ratio from secondary antiprotons that are produced and\nsubsequently accelerated within individual supernova remnants. We consider\nseveral well-motivated models for cosmic-ray propagation in the interstellar\nmedium and marginalize our results over the uncertainties related to the\nantiproton production cross section and the time-, charge-, and\nenergy-dependent effects of solar modulation. We find that the increase in the\n$\\bar{p}/p$ ratio observed at rigidities above $\\sim$ 100 GV cannot be\naccounted for within the context of conventional cosmic-ray propagation models,\nbut is consistent with scenarios in which cosmic-ray antiprotons are produced\nand subsequently accelerated by shocks within a given supernova remnant. In\nlight of this, the acceleration of secondary cosmic rays in supernova remnants\nis predicted to substantially contribute to the cosmic-ray positron spectrum,\naccounting for a significant fraction of the observed positron excess.\n", "  Background forces are linear long-range interactions of the cantilever body\nwith its surroundings that must be compensated for in order to reveal\ntip-surface force, the quantity of interest for determining material properties\nin atomic force microscopy. We provide a mathematical derivation of a method to\ncompensate for background forces, apply it to experimental data, and discuss\nhow to include background forces in simulation. Our method, based on\nlinear-response theory in the frequency domain, provides a general way of\nmeasuring and compensating for any background force and it can be readily\napplied to different force reconstruction methods in dynamic AFM.\n", "  We present the results of a Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/F160W SNAPSHOT sur-\nvey of the host galaxies of 39 long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) at z < 3.\nWe have non-detections of hosts at the locations of 4 bursts. Sufficient\naccuracy to as- trometrically align optical afterglow images and determine the\nlocation of the LGRB within its host was possible for 31/35 detected hosts. In\nagreement with other work, we find the luminosity distribution of LGRB hosts is\nsignificantly fainter than that of a star formation rate-weighted field galaxy\nsample over the same redshift range, indicating LGRBs are not unbiasedly\ntracing the star formation rate. Morphologi- cally, the sample of LGRB hosts\nare dominated by spiral-like or irregular galaxies. We find evidence for\nevolution of the population of LGRB hosts towards lower-luminosity, higher\nconcentrated hosts at lower redshifts. Their half-light radii are consistent\nwith other LGRB host samples where measurements were made on rest-frame UV\nobser- vations. In agreement with recent work, we find their 80 per cent\nenclosed flux radii distribution to be more extended than previously thought,\nmaking them intermedi- ate between core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and\nsuper-luminous supernova (SLSN) hosts. The galactocentric projected-offset\ndistribution confirms LGRBs as centrally concentrated, much more so than CCSNe\nand similar to SLSNe. LGRBs are strongly biased towards the brighter regions in\ntheir host light distributions, regardless of their offset. We find a\ncorrelation between the luminosity of the LGRB explosion site and the intrinsic\ncolumn density, N_H , towards the burst.\n", "  Many studies of synchronization properties of coupled oscillators, based on\nthe classical Kuramoto approach, focus on ensembles coupled via a mean field.\nHere we introduce a setup of Kuramoto-type phase oscillators coupled via two\nmean fields. We derive stability properties of the incoherent state and find\ntraveling wave solutions with different locking patterns; stability properties\nof these waves are found numerically. Mostly nontrivial states appear when the\ntwo fields compete, i.e. one tends to synchronize oscillators while the other\none desynchronizes them. Here we identify normal branches which bifurcate from\nthe incoherent state in a usual way, and anomalous branches, appearance of\nwhich cannot be described as a bifurcation. Furthermore, hybrid branches\ncombining properties of both are described. In the situations where no stable\ntraveling wave exists, modulated quasiperiodic in time dynamics is observed.\nOur results indicate that a competition between two coupling channels can lead\nto a complex system behavior, providing a potential generalized framework for\nunderstanding of complex phenomena in natural oscillatory systems.\n", "  We prove that \"generalized Lie algebroid\", a geometric object which appeared\nrecently in the literature, is a misconception.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP6.1 were performed to study the effect of\nneutron activation in Ar/CO$_{2}$ neutron detector counting gas. A general MCNP\nmodel was built and validated with simple analytical calculations. Simulations\nand calculations agree that only the $^{40}$Ar activation can have a\nconsiderable effect. It was shown that neither the prompt gamma intensity from\nthe $^{40}$Ar neutron capture nor the produced $^{41}$Ar activity have an\nimpact in terms of gamma dose rate around the detector and background level.\n", "  We report on the design and sensitivity of a new torsion pendulum for\nmeasuring the performance of ultra-precise inertial sensors and for the\ndevelopment of associated technologies for space-based gravitational wave\nobservatories and geodesy missions. The apparatus comprises a 1 m-long, 50\num-diameter, tungsten fiber that supports an inertial member inside a vacuum\nsystem. The inertial member is an aluminum crossbar with four hollow cubic test\nmasses at each end. This structure converts the rotation of the torsion\npendulum into translation of the test masses. Two test masses are enclosed in\ncapacitive sensors which provide readout and actuation. These test masses are\nelectrically insulated from the rest of the cross-bar and their electrical\ncharge is controlled by photoemission using fiber-coupled ultraviolet light\nemitting diodes. The capacitive readout measures the test mass displacement\nwith a broadband sensitivity of 30 nm / sqrt(Hz), and is complemented by a\nlaser interferometer with a sensitivity of about 0.5 nm / sqrt(Hz). The\nperformance of the pendulum, as determined by the measured residual torque\nnoise and expressed in terms of equivalent force acting on a single test mass,\nis roughly 200 fN / sqrt(Hz) around 2 mHz, which is about a factor of 20 above\nthe thermal noise limit of the fiber.\n", "  In this letter, we present LHC limits on the minimal universal extra\ndimension (MUED) model from LHC Run 1 data and current limits from searches of\nthe ongoing Run 2. Typical collider signals of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) states\nmimic generic degenerate supersymmetry (SUSY) missing transverse momentum\nsignatures since the excited KK particles cascade decay to jets, leptons and\nthe lightest KK particle which is stable due to KK parity and thus evades\ndetection. We test the parameter space against a large number of supersymmetry\nbased missing energy searches implemented in the public code CheckMATE. We\ndemonstrate the complementarity of employing various searches which target a\nlarge number of final state signatures, and we derive the most up to date\nlimits on the MUED parameter space from 13 TeV SUSY searches.\n", "  We study numerically the entanglement entropy and spatial correlations of the\none dimensional transverse field Ising model with three different\nperturbations. First, we focus on the out of equilibrium, steady state with an\nenergy current passing through the system. By employing a variety of\nmatrix-product state based methods, we confirm the phase diagram and compute\nthe entanglement entropy. Second, we consider a small perturbation that takes\nthe system away from integrability and calculate the correlations, the central\ncharge and the entanglement entropy. Third, we consider periodically weakened\nbonds, exploring the phase diagram and entanglement properties first in the\nsituation when the weak and strong bonds alternate (period two-bonds) and then\nthe general situation of a period of n bonds. In the latter case we find a\ncritical weak bond that scales with the transverse field as $J'_c/J$ =\n$(h/J)^n$, where $J$ is the strength of the strong bond, $J'$ of the weak bond\nand $h$ the transverse field. We explicitly show that the energy current is not\na conserved quantity in this case.\n", "  Galaxy surveys probe both structure formation and the expansion rate, making\nthem promising avenues for understanding the dark universe. Photometric surveys\naccurately map the 2D distribution of galaxy positions and shapes in a given\nredshift range, while spectroscopic surveys provide sparser 3D maps of the\ngalaxy distribution. We present a way to analyse overlapping 2D and 3D maps\njointly and without loss of information. We represent 3D maps using spherical\nFourier-Bessel (sFB) modes, which preserve radial coverage while accounting for\nthe spherical sky geometry, and we decompose 2D maps in a spherical harmonic\nbasis. In these bases, a simple expression exists for the cross-correlation of\nthe two fields. One very powerful application is the ability to simultaneously\nconstrain the redshift distribution of the photometric sample, the sample\nbiases, and cosmological parameters. We use our framework to show that combined\nanalysis of DESI and LSST can improve cosmological constraints by factors of\n${\\sim}1.2$ to ${\\sim}1.8$ on the region where they overlap relative to\nidentically sized disjoint regions. We also show that in the overlap of DES and\nSDSS-III in Stripe 82, cross-correlating improves photo-$z$ parameter\nconstraints by factors of ${\\sim}2$ to ${\\sim}12$ over internal photo-$z$\nreconstructions.\n", "  Using density-functional theory calculations, we analyze the optical\nabsorption properties of lead (Pb)-free metal halide perovskites\n(AB$^{2+}$X$_3$) and double perovskites (AB$^+$B$^{3+}$X$_6$) (A = Cs or\nmonovalent organic ion, B$^{2+}$ = non-Pb divalent metal, B$^+$ = monovalent\nmetal, B$^{3+}$ = trivalent metal, X = halogen). We show that, if B$^{2+}$ is\nnot Sn or Ge, Pb-free metal halide perovskites exhibit poor optical absorptions\nbecause of their indirect bandgap nature. Among the nine possible types of\nPb-free metal halide double perovskites, six have direct bandgaps. Of these six\ntypes, four show inversion symmetry-induced parity-forbidden or weak\ntransitions between band edges, making them not ideal for thin-film solar cell\napplication. Only one type of Pb-free double perovskite shows optical\nabsorption and electronic properties suitable for solar cell applications,\nnamely those with B$^+$ = In, Tl and B$^{3+}$ = Sb, Bi. Our results provide\nimportant insights for designing new metal halide perovskites and double\nperovskites for optoelectronic applications.\n", "  Provided a quantum superconducting condensate is allowed to occupy a curved\nhyper-plane of space-time, a geometric potential from the kinetic term arises.\nAn energy conservation relation involving the geometric field at every material\npoint in the superconductor can be demonstrated. The induced three-dimensional\nscalar curvature is directly related to the wavefunction/order parameter of the\nquantum condensate thus pointing the way to a possible experimental procedure\nto artificially induce curvature of space-time via change in the\nelectric/probability current density.\n", "  The rising attention to the spreading of fake news and unsubstantiated rumors\non online social media and the pivotal role played by confirmation bias led\nresearchers to investigate different aspects of the phenomenon. Experimental\nevidence showed that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing\ndeliberately false claims while dissenting information is mainly ignored or\nmight even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address\nmisinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants\nbehind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social\nmedia. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion\naround the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative,\ncross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We\nobserve the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both\nplatforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no\ncategorization of contents was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics\nbehind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a\nspecific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of\nautomatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to\nidentify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. We\nmeasure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the\nposts/tweets and the related emotional response of users. Our results provide\ninteresting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core\nnarratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of\nmassive viral phenomena around false claims.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement properties of an infinite class of excited\nstates in the quantum Lifshitz model (QLM). The presence of a conformal quantum\ncritical point in the QLM makes it unusually tractable for a model above one\nspatial dimension, enabling the ground state entanglement entropy for an\narbitrary domain to be expressed in terms of geometrical and topological\nquantities. Here we extend this result to excited states and find that the\nentanglement can be naturally written in terms of quantities which we dub\n\"entanglement propagator amplitudes\" (EPAs). EPAs are geometrical probabilities\nthat we explicitly calculate and interpret. A comparison of lattice and\ncontinuum results demonstrates that EPAs are universal. This work shows that\nthe QLM is an example of a 2+1d field theory where the universal behavior of\nexcited-state entanglement may be computed analytically.\n", "  We investigate the ability of the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K)\nneutrino experiment to detect new physics phenomena beyond the standard,\nthree-massive-neutrinos paradigm; namely the existence of a fourth, sterile\nneutrino or weaker-than-weak, non-standard neutrino interactions. With both\nbeam-based neutrinos from the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex\n(J-PARC) and atmospheric neutrinos, Hyper-K is capable of exploring new ranges\nof parameter space in these new-physics scenarios. We find that Hyper-K has\ncomparable capability to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment\n(DUNE), and that combining both beam- and atmospheric-based data can clear up\ndegeneracies in the parameter spaces of interest. We also comment on the\npotential improvement in searches for new physics if a combined analysis were\nperformed using Hyper-K and DUNE data.\n", "  The gravitational waves emitted by binary systems with extreme mass ratios\ncarry unique astrophysical information expected to be probed by the next\ngeneration of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA. The detection of these\nbinaries rely on an accurate modeling of the gravitational self-force that\ndrives their orbital evolution. Although the theoretical formalism to compute\nthe self-force has been largely established, the mathematical tools needed to\nimplement it are still under development, and the self-force computation\nremains an open problem. We present here a frequency-domain implementation of\nthe particle-without-particle (PwP) technique previously developed for the\ncomputation of the scalar self-force -- a helpful testbed for the gravitational\nself-force.\n", "  Cosmic growth of large scale structure probes the entire history of cosmic\nexpansion and gravitational coupling. To get a clear picture of the effects of\nmodification of gravity we consider a deviation in the coupling strength\n(effective Newton's constant) at different redshifts, with different durations\nand amplitudes. We derive, analytically and numerically, the impact on the\ngrowth rate and growth amplitude. Galaxy redshift surveys can measure a product\nof these through redshift space distortions and we connect the modified gravity\nto the observable in a way that may provide a useful parametrization of the\nability of future surveys to test gravity. In particular, modifications during\nthe matter dominated era can be treated by a single parameter, the \"area\" of\nthe modification, to an accuracy of $\\sim0.3\\%$ in the observables. We project\nconstraints on both early and late time gravity for the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument and discuss what is needed for tightening tests of\ngravity to better than 5% uncertainty.\n", "  A quantum board game is a multi-round protocol between a single quantum\nplayer against the quantum board. Molina and Watrous discovered quantum\nhedging. They gave an example for perfect quantum hedging: a board game with\nwinning probability < 1, such that the player can win with certainty at least\n1-out-of-2 quantum board games played in parallel. Here we show that perfect\nquantum hedging occurs in a cryptographic protocol - quantum coin flipping. For\nthis reason, when cryptographic protocols are composed, hedging may introduce\nserious challenges into their analysis.\n  We also show that hedging cannot occur when playing two-outcome board games\nin sequence. This is done by showing a formula for the value of sequential\ntwo-outcome board games, which depends only on the optimal value of a single\nboard game; this formula applies in a more general setting, in which hedging is\nonly a special case.\n", "  Spin-orbit-related effects offer a highly promising route for reading and\nwriting information in magnetic units of future devices. These phenomena rely\nnot only on the static magnetization orientation but also on its dynamics to\nachieve fast switchings that can reach the THz range. In this work, we consider\nCo/Pt and Fe/W bilayers to show that accounting for the phase difference\nbetween different processes is crucial to the correct description of the\ndynamical currents. By tuning each system towards its ferromagnetic resonance,\nwe reveal that dynamical spin Hall angles can non-trivially change sign and be\nboosted by over 500%, reaching giant values. We demonstrate that charge and\nspin pumping mechanisms can greatly magnify or dwindle the currents flowing\nthrough the system, influencing all kinds of magnetoresistive and Hall effects,\nthus impacting also dc and second harmonic experimental measurements.\n", "  The Lee-Wick models are higher-derivative theories that are claimed to be\nunitary thanks to a peculiar cancelation mechanism. In this paper, we provide a\nnew formulation of the models, to clarify several aspects that have remained\nquite mysterious, so far. Specifically, we define them as nonanalytically Wick\nrotated Euclidean theories. The complex energy plane is divided into\ndisconnected regions, which can be related to one another by a well-defined,\nalbeit nonanalytic procedure. Working in a generic Lorentz frame, the models\nare intrinsically equipped with the right recipe to treat the pinchings of the\nLee-Wick poles, with no need of external ad hoc prescriptions. We describe\nthese features in detail by calculating the one-loop bubble diagram and\nexplaining how the key properties generalize to more complicated diagrams. The\nphysical results of our formulation are different from those of the previous\nones. The unusual behaviors of the physical amplitudes lead to interesting\nphenomenological predictions.\n", "  We report a calculation of the nucleon axial form factors $G_A^q(Q^2)$ and\n$G_P^q(Q^2)$ for all three light quark flavors $q\\in\\{u,d,s\\}$ in the range\n$0\\leq Q^2\\lesssim 1.2\\text{ GeV}^2$ using lattice QCD. This work was done\nusing a single ensemble with pion mass 317 MeV and made use of the hierarchical\nprobing technique to efficiently evaluate the required disconnected loops. We\nperform nonperturbative renormalization of the axial current, including a\nnonperturbative treatment of the mixing between light and strange currents due\nto the singlet-nonsinglet difference caused by the axial anomaly. The form\nfactor shapes are fit using the model-independent $z$ expansion. From\n$G_A^q(Q^2)$, we determine the quark contributions to the nucleon spin and\naxial radii. By extrapolating the isovector $G_P^{u-d}(Q^2)$, we obtain the\ninduced pseudoscalar coupling relevant for ordinary muon capture and the\npion-nucleon coupling constant. We find that the disconnected contributions to\n$G_P$ form factors are large, and give an interpretation based on the dominant\ninfluence of the pseudoscalar poles in these form factors.\n", "  Evidence for intra-unit-cell (IUC) magnetic order in the pseudogap region of\nhigh-$T_c$ cuprates below a temperature $T^\\ast$ is found in several studies,\nbut NMR and $\\mu$SR experiments do not observe the expected static local\nmagnetic fields. It has been noted, however, that such fields could be averaged\nby fluctuations. Our measurements of muon spin relaxation rates in single\ncrystals of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ reveal magnetic fluctuations of the expected\norder of magnitude that exhibit critical slowing down at $T^\\ast$. These\nresults are strong evidence for fluctuating IUC magnetic order in the pseudogap\nphase.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters is a fundamental tool to\nstudy dark matter and constrain the geometry of the Universe. Recently, the\nHubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields programme has allowed a significant\nimprovement of mass and magnification measurements but lensing models still\nhave a residual root mean square between 0.2 arcsec and few arcsec- onds, not\nyet completely understood. Systematic errors have to be better understood and\ntreated in order to use strong lensing clusters as reliable cosmological\nprobes. We have analysed two simulated Hubble-Frontier-Fields-like clusters\nfrom the Hubble Frontier Fields Comparison Challenge, Ares and Hera. We use\nseveral estimators (relative bias on magnification, den- sity profiles,\nellipticity and orientation) to quantify the goodness of our reconstructions by\ncomparing our multiple models, optimized with the parametric software LENSTOOL\n, with the input models. We have quantified the impact of systematic errors\narising, first, from the choice of different density profiles and\nconfigurations and, secondly, from the availability of con- straints\n(spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, redshift ranges of the background\nsources) in the parametric modelling of strong lensing galaxy clusters and\ntherefore on the retrieval of cosmological parameters. We find that\nsubstructures in the outskirts have a significant im- pact on the position of\nthe multiple images, yielding tighter cosmological contours. The need for\nwide-field imaging around massive clusters is thus reinforced. We show that\ncompetitive cosmological constraints can be obtained also with complex\nmultimodal clusters and that photometric redshifts improve the constraints on\ncosmological parameters when considering a narrow range of (spectroscopic)\nredshifts for the sources.\n", "  To reach ambitious European CO$_2$ emission reduction targets, most scenarios\nof future European electricity systems rely on large shares of wind and solar\nphotovoltaic power generation. We interpolate between two concepts for\nbalancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental\nscales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This\ninterpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities\nfrom the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for\nthe capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural\ngas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as\npumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95%\nCO$_2$ emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical\nyear of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the\ncost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy\ngeneration is dominated by wind (65%) and hydro (15%), with average system\ncosts comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance\nin favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction\nis relaxed, 85% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be\ncaptured already with only 44% of the transmission volume.\n", "  Starting from a summary of detection statistics of our recent X-shooter\ncampaign, we review the major surveys, both space and ground based, for\nemission counterparts of high-redshift damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs)\ncarried out since the first detection 25 years ago. We show that the detection\nrates of all surveys are precisely reproduced by a simple model in which the\nmetallicity and luminosity of the galaxy associated to the DLA follow a\nrelation of the form, ${\\rm M_{UV}} = -5 \\times \\left(\\,[{\\rm M/H}] + 0.3\\,\n\\right) - 20.8$, and the DLA cross-section follows a relation of the form\n$\\sigma_{DLA} \\propto L^{0.8}$. Specifically, our spectroscopic campaign\nconsists of 11 DLAs preselected based on their equivalent width of SiII\n$\\lambda1526$ to have a metallicity higher than [Si/H] > -1. The targets have\nbeen observed with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope to\nsearch for emission lines around the quasars. We observe a high detection rate\nof 64% (7/11), significantly higher than the typical $\\sim$10% for random,\nHI-selected DLA samples. We use the aforementioned model, to simulate the\nresults of our survey together with a range of previous surveys: spectral\nstacking, direct imaging (using the `double DLA' technique), long-slit\nspectroscopy, and integral field spectroscopy. Based on our model results, we\nare able to reconcile all results. Some tension is observed between model and\ndata when looking at predictions of Ly$\\alpha$ emission for individual targets.\nHowever, the object to object variations are most likely a result of the\nsignificant scatter in the underlying scaling relations as well as\nuncertainties in the amount of dust which affects the emission.\n", "  We explore the structure and statistics of multiphase, magnetized ISM\nturbulence in the local Milky Way by means of driven periodic box numerical MHD\nsimulations. Using the higher order-accurate piecewise-parabolic method on a\nlocal stencil (PPML), we carry out a small parameter survey varying the mean\nmagnetic field strength and density while fixing the rms velocity to observed\nvalues. We quantify numerous characteristics of the transient and steady-state\nturbulence, including its thermodynamics and phase structure, kinetic and\nmagnetic energy power spectra, structure functions, and distribution functions\nof density, column density, pressure, and magnetic field strength. The\nsimulations reproduce many observables of the local ISM, including molecular\nclouds, such as the ratio of turbulent to mean magnetic field at 100 pc scale,\nthe mass and volume fractions of thermally stable HI, the lognormal\ndistribution of column densities, the mass-weighted distribution of thermal\npressure, and the linewidth-size relationship for molecular clouds. Our models\npredict the shape of magnetic field probability density functions (PDFs), which\nare strongly non-Gaussian, and the relative alignment of magnetic field and\ndensity structures. Finally, our models show how the observed low rates of star\nformation per free-fall time are controlled by the multiphase thermodynamics\nand large-scale turbulence.\n", "  This paper describes dynamic and thermodynamic (at $T=0$) properties of\nmesons in asymmetric matter in the framework of Chiral Perturbation Theory. We\nconsider a mesonic system at vanishing temperature with nonzero isospin\nchemical potential and strangeness chemical potential and we study their effect\non the phase diagram. We also study meson masses and mixing in the resulting\nnormal phase, pion condensation phase and kaon condensation phase. We find\ndifferences with previous papers regarding meson masses and mixing in the\ncondensed phases; the results presented here are supported by theory group\nanalysis and direct calculations. Pressure, density and equation of state of\nthe system at $T=0$ and nonzero $\\mu_I$ are calculated, finding remarkable\nagreement with analogue studies performed by lattice calculations.\n", "  Hierarchical quadruple systems arise naturally in stellar binaries and\ntriples that harbour planets. Examples are hot Jupiters (HJs) in stellar triple\nsystems, and planetary companions to HJs in stellar binaries. The secular\ndynamical evolution of these systems is generally complex, with secular chaotic\nmotion possible in certain parameter regimes. The latter can lead to extremely\nhigh eccentricities and, therefore, strong interactions such as efficient tidal\nevolution. These interactions are believed to play an important role in the\nformation of HJs through high-eccentricity migration. Nevertheless, a deeper\nunderstanding of the secular dynamics of these systems is still lacking. Here\nwe study in detail the secular dynamics of a special case of hierarchical\nquadruple systems in either the `2+2' or `3+1' configurations. We show how the\nequations of motion can be cast in a form representing a perturbed hierarchical\nthree-body system, in which the outer orbital angular momentum vector is\nprecessing steadily around a fixed axis. In this case, we show that\neccentricity excitation can be significantly enhanced when the precession\nperiod is comparable to the Lidov-Kozai oscillation time-scale of the inner\norbit. This arises from an induced large mutual inclination between the inner\nand outer orbits driven by the precession of the outer orbit, even if the\ninitial mutual inclination is small. We present a simplified semi-analytic\nmodel that describes the latter phenomenon.\n", "  We investigate aggregation and fragmentation dynamics of tracers and inertial\naggregates in random flows leading to steady state size distributions. Our\nobjective is to elucidate the impact of changes in aggregation rates, due to\ndifferences in advection dynamics, especially with respect to the influence of\ninertial effects. This aggregation process is, at the same time, balanced by\nfragmentation triggered by local hydrodynamic stress. Our study employs an\nindividual-particle-based model, tracking position, velocity and size of each\naggregate. We compare the steady-state size distribution formed by tracers and\ninertial aggregates, characterized by different sizes and densities. On the one\nhand, we show that the size distributions change their shape with changes of\nthe dilution rate of the suspension. On the other hand, we obtain that the size\ndistributions formed with different binding strengths between monomers can be\nrescaled to a single form with the use of a characteristic size for both dense\ninertial particles and tracer monomers. Nevertheless, this last scaling\nrelation also fails if the size distribution contains aggregates that behave as\ntracer-like and as inertial-like, which results in a crossover between\ndifferent scalings.\n", "  The effect of a mass-loading of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow in a\nrelativistic jet from active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^+e^-$ conversion is considered analytically. We\nargue that the effects of charge average separation due to specific initial\npairs' motion lead to partial magnetic and electric fields screening or\nenhancement. The effect of the fields screening has not been considered\nearlier. The pairs with the center-of-mass moving faster or slower than the\nbulk plasma flow create a surface charge and a current which either screen or\nenhance both electric and magnetic fields in a pair creation domain. This\nimpacts the bulk flow motion, which either accelerates or decelerates. The\npairs with the center-of-mass moving with exactly the drift velocity does not\ninduce the fields disturbance. In this case the flow decelerates due to pure\nmass-loading. For these different cases the Lorentz factor of the loaded\noutflow is calculated as a function of loading pairs number density. The effect\nmay be important on sub-parsec to parsec scales due to conversion of TeV jet\nradiation on soft infra-red to ultra-violet external isotropic photon field.\nThis leads to an outer shell acceleration. The conversion of MeV jet radiation\non larger scales may account for the flow deceleration due to pure\nmass-loading. The proposed mechanism may be a source of internal shocks and\ninstabilities in the pair creation region.\n", "  The radial transport of angular momentum in accretion disk is a fundamental\nprocess in the universe. It governs the dynamical evolution of accretion disks\nand has implications for various issues ranging from the formation of planets\nto the growth of supermassive black holes. While the importance of magnetic\nfields for this problem has long been demonstrated, the existence of a source\nof transport solely hydrodynamical in nature has proven more difficult to\nestablish and to quantify. In recent years, a combination of results coming\nfrom experiments, theoretical work and numerical simulations has dramatically\nimproved our understanding of hydrodynamically mediated angular momentum\ntransport in accretion disk. Here, based on these recent developments, we\nreview the hydrodynamical processes that might contribute to transporting\nangular momentum radially in accretion disks and highlight the many questions\nthat are still to be answered.\n", "  In this paper we present a new variable time step criterion for the\nvelocity-Verlet algorithm allowing to correctly simulate the dynamics of\ncharged particles exchanging energy via Coulomb collisions while minimising\nsimulation time. We present physical arguments supporting the use of the\ncriterion along with numerical results proving its validity. We numerically\nshow that $\\bar{\\textrm{H}}^{+}$ ions with 18 meV initial energy can be\ncaptured and sympathetically cooled by a Coulomb crystal of $\\textrm{Be}^{+}$\nand $\\textrm{HD}^{+}$ in less than 10 ms, an important result for the GBAR\nproject.\n", "  In the vanadium oxyfluoride compound\n(NH$_4$)$_2$[C$_7$H$_{14}$N][V$_7$O$_6$F$_{18}$] (DQVOF), the V$^{4+}$ (3d$^1$,\n$S=1/2$) ions realize a unique, highly frustrated breathing kagome lattice\ncomposed of alternately-sized, corner-sharing equilateral triangles. Here we\npresent an $^{17}$O NMR study of DQVOF, which isolates the local susceptibility\nof the breathing kagome network. By a fit to series expansion we extract the\nratio of the interactions within the breathing kagome plane, $J_\\triangledown /\nJ_\\vartriangle = 0.55(4)$, and the mean antiferromagnetic interaction\n$\\bar{J}=60(7)$~K. Spin lattice, $T_1$, measurements reveal an essentially\ngapless excitation spectrum with a maximum gap $\\Delta / \\bar{J}=0.007(7)$. Our\nstudy provides new impetus for further theoretical investigations in order to\nestablish whether the gapless spin liquid behavior displayed by DQVOF is\nintrinsic to its breathing kagome lattice or whether it is due to perturbations\nto this model, such as a residual coupling of the V$^{4+}$ ions in the\nbreathing kagome planes to the interlayer V$^{3+}$ ($S=1$) spins.\n", "  The instability of ferroelectric ordering in ultra-thin films is one of the\nmost important fundamental issues pertaining realization of a number of\nelectronic devices with enhanced functionality, such as ferroelectric and\nmultiferroic tunnel junctions or ferroelectric field effect transistors. In\nthis paper, we investigate the polarization state of archetypal ultrathin\n(several nanometres) ferroelectric heterostructures: epitaxial\nsingle-crystalline BaTiO$_3$ films sandwiched between the most habitual\nperovskite electrodes, SrRuO$_3$, on top of the most used perovskite substrate,\nSrTiO$_3$. We use a combination of piezoresponse force microscopy, dielectric\nmeasurements and structural characterization to provide conclusive evidence for\nthe ferroelectric nature of the relaxed polarization state in ultrathin\nBaTiO$_3$ capacitors. We show that even the high screening efficiency of\nSrRuO$_3$ electrodes is still insufficient to stabilize polarization in\nSrRuO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$/SrRuO$_3$ heterostructures at room temperature. We identify\nthe key role of domain wall motion in determining the macroscopic electrical\nproperties of ultrathin capacitors and discuss their dielectric response in the\nlight of the recent interest in negative capacitance behaviour.\n", "  We present the first catalogue of eclipsing binaries in two MOA fields\ntowards the Galactic bulge, in which over 8,000 candidates, mostly contact and\nsemi-detached binaries of periods < 1 d, were identified. In this paper, the\nlight curves of a small number of interesting candidates including eccentric\nbinaries, binaries with noteworthy phase modulations and eclipsing RS CVn type\nstars are shown as examples. In addition, we identified three triple object\ncandidates by detecting the light-travel-time effect in their eclipse time\nvariation curves.\n", "  We report a study on the thermal conductivity of CuFe$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$O$_2$ ($x\n=$ 0--0.12) single crystals at temperatures down to 0.3 K and in magnetic\nfields up to 14 T. CuFeO$_2$ is a well-known geometrically frustrated\ntriangular lattice antiferromagnet and can be made to display multiferroicity\neither by applying magnetic field along the $c$ axis or by doping nonmagnetic\nimpurities, accompanied with rich behaviors of magnetic phase transitions. The\nmain experimental findings of this work are: (i) the thermal conductivities\n($\\kappa_a$ and $\\kappa_c$) show drastic anomalies at temperature- or\nfield-induced magnetic transitions; (ii) the low-$T$ $\\kappa(H)$ isotherms\nexhibit irreversibility in a broad region of magnetic fields; (iii) there are\nphonon scattering effect caused by magnetic fluctuations at very low\ntemperatures. These results demonstrate strong spin-phonon coupling in this\nmaterial and reveal the non-negligible magnetic fluctuations in the \"ground\nstate\" of pure and Ga-doped samples.\n", "  We compute corrections to the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson to\nhadrons, to the fourth order in the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$. We use\nan effective theory in which the Higgs boson couples directly to bottom quarks\nand to gluons, via top quark--mediated effective couplings. Numerically, our\nresults are of a comparable size to the previously-known \"massless\"\ncontributions and complete the order $\\alpha_s^4$ corrections to the hadronic\ndecay of the Higgs boson. In these proceedings we also provide an independent\ncross check of the gluonic Higgs boson decay at order $\\alpha_s^5$.\n", "  In a recent paper [D. Philipp, V. Perlick, D. Puetzfeld, E. Hackmann, and C.\nL\\\"ammerzahl, Phys. Rev. D 95, 104037 (2017)], a definition of a\ngeneral-relativistic geoid, restricted to stationary spacetimes, was presented\nin terms of \"isochronometric surfaces\". In this note, we explicate how this\ndefinition is just a special, highly restrictive case of our earlier\nformulation of the general-relativistic geoid using quasilocal frames, which is\nvalid for generic, non-stationary spacetimes [M. Oltean, R.J. Epp, P.L.\nMcGrath, and R.B. Mann, Class. Quantum Grav. 33, 105001 (2016)]. Moreover, like\nthe isochronometric surface geoid, we show how our \"geoid quasilocal frame\"\n(GQF) can also be defined, simply and operationally, in terms of redshift\nmeasurements.\n", "  We construct 7-dimensional quantum field theories encoding the anomalies of\nconformal field theories with (2,0) supersymmetry in six dimensions. We explain\nhow the conformal blocks of the (2,0) theories arise in this context.

The problem is\naddressed within the conventional strong-field approximation (SFA) in standard\nvelocity gauge (VG) formulation under condition of arbitrary value of the\nso-called Keldysh parameter $\\gamma$ , including both the multiphoton (for\n$\\gamma \\gg 1$) and tunneling (for $\\gamma \\ll 1$) regimes of ionization.\nAccording to such VG-SFA consideration, the calculated photoelectron momentum\ndistributions (PMD) demonstrate a clear spatial asymmetry (viz., the\nphotoelectron emission proved to be different along the opposite directions\nwith respect to incident laser field polarization) even for particular\nbichromatic field(s) with polar symmetry of its total electric field strength.\nMoreover, a clear correlation between the spatial symmetry/asymmetry of\nphotoelectron emission and that of applied vector potential of bichromatic\nfield is reliably established, so that the symmetry of calculated PMD proved to\nfollow precisely the symmetry of applied vector potential of incident laser\nbichromatic field, in a close analogy with the well-known Aharonov-Bohm effect.\nBased on these our findings, the attempt is undertaken to identify the physical\nmechanism underlying this intriguing phenomenon and provide it with a kind of\nsemiclassical interpretation in terms of the partial contributions from\nphotoelectron momenta in final continuum states to partial strong-field ATI\namplidude(s) corresponding to a certain (fixed) number of either of two\nharmonics absorbed.\n", "  The DEAP-3600 experiment is a single-phase detector that uses 3600 Kg of\nliquid argon to search for Dark Matter at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada, 6800 ft.\nunderground. The projected sensitivity to the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon\ncross-section is $10^{-46}$ cm$^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV. A key\nexperimental requirement is the reduction of any possible source of background\nthat would mimic a Dark Matter signal. This document will review how radiogenic\nsurface backgrounds were reduced in-situ by removing 500 microns of acrylic\nfrom the innermost part of the detector with a resurfacing robot. Furthermore,\nit will review the transient cool-down process of the experiment, necessary to\nreach cryogenic operating temperature.\n", "  We examine the local geometry of affine surfaces which are locally symmetric.\nThere are 6 non-isomorphic local geometries. We realize these examples as Type\nA, Type B, and Type C geometries using a result of Opozda and classify the\nrelevant geometries up to linear isomorphism. We examine the geodesic\nstructures in this context. Particular attention is paid to the Lorentzian\nanalogue of the hyperbolic plane and to the pseudosphere.\n", "  A novel method is presented for measuring impulsive forces generated by\ndevices which are fed with medium power microwave signals. The forces are\nmeasured with a torsion balance or weighing scale, as usual, but the microwave\nsignal is coupled directly to the device under test via a special coupling\ncavity instead of being generated on the measurement device. The method was\nverified at power levels up to 15 W, has a transmission of at least 75% (-1.3\ndB attenuation) and is shown not to exert disturbing forces at this power level\n(vertical forces smaller then 10 micronewton). The application of this way of\nsupplying microwave signals could significantly improve experiments which\notherwise suffer from heat dissipation and Lorentz forces by components present\non the force measurement device. A particular field of application, where\nprevious research has failed to prove or disprove the existence of certain\nanomalous forces, is discussed.\n", "  Corrosion of Indian RAFMS (reduced activation ferritic martensitic steel)\nmaterial with liquid metal, Lead Lithium ( Pb-Li) has been studied under static\ncondition, maintaining Pb-Li at 550 C for different time durations, 2500, 5000\nand 9000 hours. Corrosion rate was calculated from weight loss measurements.\nMicrostructure analysis was carried out using SEM and chemical composition by\nSEM-EDX measurements. Micro Vickers hardness and tensile testing were also\ncarried out. Chromium was found leaching from the near surface regions and\nsurface hardness was found to decrease in all the three cases. Grain boundaries\nwere affected. Some grains got detached from the surface giving rise to pebble\nlike structures in the surface micrographs. There was no significant reduction\nin the tensile strength, after exposure to liquid metal.

We consider the aLIGO collaboration gravitational wave\nmeasurements of the binary black hole spins and the predicted modified gravity\n(MOG) preference for misaligned spins of the coalescing black holes. In MOG,\nduring the merger of two black holes, the enhanced strength of gravitation\nreduces the effective spin parameter $\\chi_{\\rm eff}\\sim 0$ in agreement with\nthe measured spin misalignment of the merging black holes observed in the\ngravitational wave detections by the aLIGO collaboration.\n", "  Context: The cosmological concordance model ($\\Lambda$CDM) matches the\ncosmological observations exceedingly well. This model has become the standard\ncosmological model with the evidence for an accelerated expansion provided by\nthe type Ia supernovae (SNIa) Hubble diagram. However, the robustness of this\nevidence has been addressed recently with somewhat diverging conclusions. Aims:\nThe purpose of this paper is to assess the robustness of the conclusion that\nthe Universe is indeed accelerating if we rely only on low-redshift\n(z$\\lesssim$2) observations, that is to say with SNIa, baryonic acoustic\noscillations, measurements of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, and\nmeasurements of the growth of matter perturbations. Methods: We used the\nstandard statistical procedure of minimizing the $\\chi^2$ function for the\ndifferent probes to quantify the goodness of fit of a model for both\n$\\Lambda$CDM and a simple nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model. In this\nanalysis, we do not assume that supernovae intrinsic luminosity is independent\nof the redshift, which has been a fundamental assumption in most previous\nstudies that cannot be tested. Results: We have found that, when SNIa intrinsic\nluminosity is not assumed to be redshift independent, a nonaccelerated\nlow-redshift power law model is able to fit the low-redshift background data as\nwell as, or even slightly better, than $\\Lambda$CDM. When measurements of the\ngrowth of structures are added, a nonaccelerated low-redshift power law model\nstill provides an excellent fit to the data for all the luminosity evolution\nmodels considered. Conclusions: Without the standard assumption that supernovae\nintrinsic luminosity is independent of the redshift, low-redshift probes are\nconsistent with a nonaccelerated universe.\n", "  We present and analyze three-dimensional data cubes of Neptune from the\nOSIRIS integral-field spectrograph on the 10-m Keck telescope, from July 2009.\nThese data have a spatial resolution of 0.035\"/pixel and spectral resolution of\nR~3800 in the H and K broad bands. We focus our analysis on regions of\nNeptune's atmosphere that are near-infrared dark- that is, free of discrete\nbright cloud features. We use a forward model coupled to a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm to retrieve properties of Neptune's aerosol structure and\nmethane profile above ~4 bar in these near-infrared dark regions.\n  Using a set of high signal-to-noise spectra in a cloud-free band from 2-12N,\nwe find that Neptune's cloud opacity is dominated by a compact, optically thick\ncloud layer with a base near 3 bar and composed of low albedo, forward\nscattering particles, with an assumed characteristic size of ~1$\\mu$m. Above\nthis cloud, we require a vertically extended haze of smaller (~0.1 $\\mu$m)\nparticles, which reaches from the upper troposphere (~0.6 bar) into the\nstratosphere. The particles in this haze are brighter and more isotropically\nscattering than those in the deep cloud. When we extend our analysis to 18\ncloud-free locations from 20N to 87S, we observe that the optical depth in\naerosols above 0.5 bar decreases by a factor of 2-3 or more at mid- and\nhigh-southern latitudes relative to low latitudes.\n  We also consider Neptune's methane (CH$_4$) profile, and find that our\nretrievals indicate a strong preference for a low methane relative humidity at\npressures where methane is expected to condense. Our preferred solution at most\nlocations is for a methane relative humidity below 10% near the tropopause in\naddition to methane depletion down to 2.0-2.5 bar. We tentatively identify a\ntrend of lower CH$_4$ columns above 2.5 bar at mid- and high-southern latitudes\nover low latitudes.\n", "  Because Majorana fermions are their own antiparticles, their electric and\nmagnetic dipole moments must vanish, leaving the anapole moment as their only\nstatic electromagnetic property. But the existence of induced dipole moments is\nnot necessarily prohibited. Through a study real Compton scattering, we explore\nthe constraints that the Majorana fermion's self-conjugate nature has on\ninduced moments. In terms of the Compton amplitude, we find no constraints if\nthe interactions are separately invariant under charge conjugation, parity, and\ntime reversal. However, if the interactions are odd under parity and even under\ntime reversal, then these contributions to the Compton amplitude must vanish.\nWe employ a simple model to confirm these general findings via explicit\ncalculation of the Majorana fermion's polarizabilities. We then use these\npolarizabilities to estimate the cross-section for $s$-wave annihilation of two\nMajorana fermions into photons. The cross-section is larger than a na\\\"ive\nestimate might suggest.\n", "  The control of electromechanical responses within bonding regions is\nessential to face frontier challenges in nanotechnologies, such as molecular\nelectronics and biotechnology. Here, we present I\\b{eta}-nanocellulose as a\npotentially new orthotropic 2D piezoelectric crystal. The predicted in-layer\npiezoelectricity is originated on a sui-generis hydrogen bonds pattern. Upon\nthis fact and by using a combination of ab-initio and ad-hoc models, we\nintroduce a description of electrical profiles along chemical bonds. Such\ndevelopments lead to obtain a rationale for modelling the extended\npiezoelectric effect originated within bond scales. The order of magnitude\nestimated for the 2D I\\b{eta}-nanocellulose piezoelectric response, ~pm V-1,\nranks this material at the level of currently used piezoelectric energy\ngenerators and new artificial 2D designs. Such finding would be crucial for\ndeveloping alternative materials to drive emerging nanotechnologies.\n", "  In this research was implemented the use of an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller\nto control the movements of a prototype robotic functional developed to perform\nrehabilitation exercises in the wrist joint; This device can be used to assist\nthe physiatrist to rehabilitate the tendinitis, synovitis, rheumatoid arthritis\nand for pre-operative and post-operative therapy in this joint. During the\ndesign stage of the functional prototype, the methodology of the industrial\ndesign process was used from a concurrent engineering approach, through which\nanthropometric studies could be performed related to the dimensions and angles\nof movement of the wrist joint in the population Venezuelan from the\ninformation collected, the design proposal was elaborated, and the use of CAD\nprograms defined the different forms, geometries and materials of the\ncomponents of the rehabilitation device, which were later analyzed using the\nfinite element method for the determination The tensional state of efforts and\nsafety factors through the use of CAE programs. In addition, a software was\ndeveloped for the acquisition, registration, reproduction and execution of the\ndifferent movements produced during the rehabilitation therapy. Through the\nresearch developed, a device was designed that will help the rehabilitation of\nthe wrist joint allowing the combination of dorsal-palmar flexion and\nulnar-radial movements to recover the joint function of various pathologies\npresented in the Venezuelan population.\n", "  We use a co-trapped ion ($^{88}\\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$) to sympathetically cool and\nmeasure the quantum state populations of a memory-qubit ion of a different\natomic species ($^{40}\\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$) in a cryogenic, surface-electrode ion\ntrap. Due in part to the low motional heating rate demonstrated here, the state\npopulations of the memory ion can be transferred to the auxiliary ion by using\nthe shared motion as a quantum state bus and measured with an average accuracy\nof 96(1)%. This scheme can be used in quantum information processors to reduce\nphoton-scattering-induced error in unmeasured memory qubits.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of dusty, supersonic turbulence in molecular\nclouds. We model 0.1, 1 and 10 {\\mu}m sized dust grains at an initial\ndust-to-gas mass ratio of 1:100, solving the equations of combined gas and dust\ndynamics where the dust is coupled to the gas through a drag term. We show\nthat, for 0.1 and 1 {\\mu}m grains, the dust-to-gas ratio deviates by typically\n10-20% from the mean, since the stopping time of the dust due to gas drag is\nshort compared to the dynamical time. Contrary to previous findings, we find no\nevidence for orders of magnitude fluctuation in the dust-to-gas ratio for 0.1\n{\\mu}m grains. Larger, 10 {\\mu}m dust grains may have dust-to-gas ratios\nincreased by up to an order of magnitude locally. Both small (0.1 {\\mu}m) and\nlarge ($\\gtrsim$ 1 {\\mu}m) grains trace the large-scale morphology of the gas,\nhowever we find evidence for 'size-sorting' of grains, where turbulence\npreferentially concentrates larger grains into dense regions. Size-sorting may\nhelp to explain observations of 'coreshine' from dark clouds, and why\nextinction laws differ along lines of sight through molecular clouds in the\nMilky Way compared to the diffuse interstellar medium.\n", "  Quantum circuits of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize; thus, the\nnumber of qubits is an important metric in a quantum circuit design. Further,\nscalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on Clifford + T gates. An\nefficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the\nnumber of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.\nRecently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which\nimproves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of\nqubits, and delay. However, the recent design is not based on fault-tolerant\nClifford + T gates. Also, it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs.\nTherefore, this work presents a T-count optimized quantum circuit for integer\nmultiplication with only $4 \\cdot n + 1$ qubits and no garbage outputs. The\nproposed quantum multiplier design saves the T-count by using a novel quantum\nconditional adder circuit. Also, where one operand to the controlled adder is\nzero, the conditional adder is replaced with a Toffoli gate array to further\nsave the T gates. To have fair comparison with the recent design by Babu and\nget an actual estimate of the T-count, it is made garbageless by using\nBennett's garbage removal scheme. The proposed design achieves an average\nT-count savings of $47.55\\%$ compared to the recent work by Babu. Further,\ncomparison is also performed with other recent works by Lin et. al. [2], and\nJayashree et. al.[3]. Average T-count savings of $62.71\\%$ and $26.30\\%$ are\nachieved compared to the recent works by Lin et. al., and Jayashree et. al.,\nrespectively.\n", "  This work presents an algorithm to generate depth, quantum gate and qubit\noptimized circuits for $GF(2^m)$ squaring in the polynomial basis. Further, to\nthe best of our knowledge the proposed quantum squaring circuit algorithm is\nthe only work that considers depth as a metric to be optimized. We compared\ncircuits generated by our proposed algorithm against the state of the art and\ndetermine that they require $50 \\%$ fewer qubits and offer gates savings that\nrange from $37 \\%$ to $68 \\%$. Further, existing quantum exponentiation are\nbased on either modular or integer arithmetic. However, Galois arithmetic is a\nuseful tool to design resource efficient quantum exponentiation circuit\napplicable in quantum cryptanalysis. Therefore, we present the quantum circuit\nimplementation of Galois field exponentiation based on the proposed quantum\nGalois field squaring circuit. We calculated a qubit savings ranging between\n$44\\%$ to $50\\%$ and quantum gate savings ranging between $37 \\%$ to $68 \\%$\ncompared to identical quantum exponentiation circuit based on existing squaring\ncircuits.\n", "  Most of zoonoses are multi-host parasites with multiple transmission routes\nthat are usually investigated separately despite their potential interplay. As\na unifying framework for modelling parasite spread through different paths of\ninfection, we suggest \"ecomultiplex\" networks, i.e. multiplex networks\nrepresenting interacting animal communities with (i) spatial structure and (ii)\nmetabolic scaling. We exploit this ecological framework for testing potential\ncontrol strategies for $T. cruzii$ spread in two real-world ecosystems. Our\ninvestigation highlights two interesting results. Firstly, the ecomultiplex\ntopology can be as efficient as more data-demanding epidemiological measures in\nidentifying which species facilitate parasite spread. Secondly, the interplay\nbetween predator-prey and host-parasite interactions leads to a phenomenon of\nparasite amplification in which top predators facilitate $T. cruzii$ spread,\noffering theoretical interpretation of previous empirical findings. Our\napproach is broadly applicable and could provide novel insights in designing\nimmunisation strategies for pathogens with multiple transmission routes in\nreal-world ecosystems.\n", "  One of central issues in iron-based superconductors is the role of structural\nchange to the superconducting transition temperature (T_c). It was found in\nFeSe that the lattice strain leads to a drastic increase in T_c, accompanied by\nsuppression of nematic order. By angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on\ntensile- or compressive-strained and strain-free FeSe, we experimentally show\nthat the in-plane strain causes a marked change in the energy overlap\n(DeltaE_{h-e}) between the hole and electron pockets in the normal state. The\nchange in DeltaE_{h-e} modifies the Fermi-surface volume, leading to a change\nin T_c. Furthermore, the strength of nematicity is also found to be\ncharacterized by DeltaE_{h-e}. These results suggest that the key to\nunderstanding the phase diagram is the fermiology and interactions linked to\nthe semimetallic band overlap.\n", "  This is an introduction to a provisional mathematical definition of Coulomb\nbranches of $3$-dimensional $\\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories,\nstudied in arXiv:1503.03676, arXiv:1601.03586.

It is\nnaturally related to the existence of a polynomial in momenta integral for a\nClassical Hamiltonian system with 1,5 degrees of freedom. For the solution in\nquestion it is not known a-priori if the system is elliptic or hyperbolic or of\nmixed type. We consider two possible regimes for the solution. The first is the\ncase of only one real eigenvalue, where we can completely classify the\nsolutions. The second case of strict Hyperbolicity is really a challenge. We\nfind a remarkable 2 by 2 reduction which is strictly Hyperbolic but violates\nthe condition of genuine non-linearity.\n", "  Various and spontaneous magnetic skyrmionic bubbles are experimentally\nobserved for the first time, at room temperature in a frustrated kagome magnet\nFe3Sn2 with unixial magnetic anisotropy. The magnetization dynamics were\ninvestigated using in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, revealing\nthat the transformation between different magnetic bubbles and domains are via\nthe motion of Bloch lines driven by applied external magnetic field. The\nresults demonstrate that Fe3Sn2 facilitates a unique magnetic control of\ntopological spin textures at room temperature, making it a promising candidate\nfor further skyrmion-based spintronic devices.\n", "  We study the number of cycles and their average length in $L\\times N$ lattice\nby using classical method of transfer matrix. In this work, we derive a\nbivariate generating function $G_3(y, z)$ in which a coefficient of $y^i z^j$\nis the number of cycles of length $i$ in $3\\times j$ lattice. By using the\nbivariate generating function, we show that the average length of cycles in\n$3\\times N$ lattice is $\\alpha N + \\beta + o(1)$ where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are\nsome algebraic numbers approximately equal to 3.166 and 0.961, respectively. We\nargue generalizations of this method for $L\\ge 4$, and obtain a generating\nfunction of the number of cycles in $L\\times N$ lattice for $L$ up to 7.\n", "  We report on the development of a new family of SQUID current sensors based\non sub-micron cross-type Josephson tunnel junctions.

With input coil inductances ranging from 10 nH to\n2.8 {\\mu}H and current sensitivities and coupled energy resolution down to 65\nfA/Hz^{1/2} and below 10 h, respectively, they are a versatile tool for\nnumerous applications.\n", "  The gamma-Cas category is a subgroup of Be stars displaying a strong, hard,\nand variable thermal X-ray emission. An XMM-Newton observation of pi Aqr\nreveals spectral and temporal characteristics that clearly make this Be star\nanother member of the gamma-Cas category. Furthermore, pi Aqr is a binary but,\ncontrary to gamma-Cas, the nature of the companion to the Be star is known; it\nis a non-degenerate (stellar) object and its small separation from the Be star\ndoes not leave much room for a putative compact object close to the Be disk.\nThis renders the accretion scenario difficult to apply in this system, and,\nhence, this discovery favors a disk-related origin for the gamma-Cas\nphenomenon.\n", "  We may anticipate that climate change will bring changes to the intensity and\nvariability of near surface winds, either through local effects or by altering\nthe large-scale flow. The impact of climate change on European wind resources\nhas been assessed using a single-model-ensemble of the latest regional climate\nmodel from the Rossby Centre, RCA4. These simulations used data from five of\nthe global climate models in the contemporary Climate Model Intercomparison\nProject (CMIP5) as boundary conditions, and the results are publicly available\nunder the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) project.\nOverall we find a consistent pattern of a decrease in the wind resources over\nthe European domain under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, although\nthere are some regions, principally North Africa and the Barents Sea, with\nprojected increases in wind resources. The pattern of change is both robust\nacross the choice of scenario, and persistent: there is a very similar pattern\nof change found in the latter part of the 21st century as in the earlier. A\ncase study was chosen to assess the potential for offshore wind-farms in the\nBlack Sea region. We developed a realistic methodology for extrapolating\nnear-surface wind speeds up to hub-height using a time-varying roughness\nlength, and determined the extractable wind power at hub-height using a\nrealistic model of contemporary wind-turbine energy production. We demonstrate\nthat, unlike much of the Mediterranean basin, there is no robust pattern of a\nnegative climate change impact on wind resources in the studied regions of the\nBlack Sea. Furthermore, the seasonality of wind resources, with a strong peak\nin the winter, matches well to the seasonality of energy-demand in the region,\nmaking offshore wind-farms in the Black Sea region a viable source of energy\nfor neighbouring countries.\n", "  Simulation of wave propagation in a microearthquake environment is often\nchallenging due to small-scale structural and material heterogeneities. We\nsimulate wave propagation in three different real microearthquake environments\nusing a spectral-element method. In the first example, we compute the full\nwavefield in 2D and 3D models of an underground ore mine, namely the Pyhaesalmi\nmine in Finland. In the second example, we simulate wave propagation in a\nhomogeneous velocity model including the actual topography of an unstable rock\nslope at Aaknes in western Norway. Finally, we compute the full wavefield for a\nweakly anisotropic cylindrical sample at laboratory scale, which was used for\nan acoustic emission experiment under triaxial loading. We investigate the\ncharacteristic features of wave propagation in those models and compare\nsynthetic waveforms with observed waveforms wherever possible. We illustrate\nthe challenges associated with the spectral-element simulation in those models.\n", "  The ALICE detector is well suited to measure heavy-flavour (charm and beauty)\nproduction via hadronic and semi-leptonic decay channels of heavy-flavour\nparticles. Here an overview of heavy-flavour measurements made with the ALICE\ndetector during Run 1 in pp and p--Pb collisions is presented and discussed.\n", "  Quantum-mechanical motion of a half-spin particle was examined in the axially\nsymmetric field of static naked singularities formed by mass distribution with\nquadrupole moment (q-metric). The analysis was performed by means of the method\nof effective potentials of the Dirac equation generalized for the case when\nradial and angular variables are not separated. As $-1<q<q_{lim}, |q_{lim}|<<1\n$ the naked singularities do not except the existence of stationary bound\nstates of Dirac particles for a prolate mass distribution in the q-metric along\nthe axial axis. For the oblate mass distribution, the naked singularities of\nthe q-metric are separated from the Dirac particle by infinitely large\nrepulsive barriers with the subsequent potential well deepening while moving\nalong the angle from the equator (or from $\\theta=\\theta_{min},\n\\theta=\\pi-\\theta_{min}$) towards poles. The exception are the poles and, as\n$0<q<q*$, some points $\\theta_{i}$ for the states of the particle with j>=3/2.\n", "  Recent theoretical results together with established theory have identified\nthe displacement thickness and the velocity at the boundary layer edge as\nsimilarity scaling parameter candidates for the wall-bounded turbulent boundary\nlayer. In the work described herein, we examine these scaling parameters along\nwith the Prandtl Plus scaling's and the Zagarola and Smits scaling's to search\nfor similarity in the outer region of experimental turbulent boundary layer\nvelocity profile datasets. A new integral area method combined with the\ntraditional chi-by-eye method is used to search for similar velocity profiles.\nThe results indicate that strict whole profile similarity is not evident in any\nof the datasets we searched. However, ten datasets are found that display\n\"similar-like\" behavior using the ratio of the inner to outer thickness ratio\nas a search criterion. In alignment with theory, the preferred similarity\nscaling parameters for the similar-like behavior case are the displacement\nthickness and the velocity at the boundary layer edge. It was found that there\nare a few datasets for which the Prandtl Plus scaling and the Zagarola and\nSmits scaling also work.\n", "  Two-color side-view probing of light-matter interaction from minute focal\nvolume of a tightly focused fs-laser pump pulse reveals charge dynamics with\nhigh 0.9 micrometers optical resolution and approximately ~20 fs temporal\nresolution in coincidence between pump and probe pulses. Use of two colors is\nadvantageous for probing optically excited plasma regions with different\ndensity. Holographical digital focusing and spatial filtering were implemented\nto obtain the same resolution images for subsequent Fourier analysis. Fast\nelectron removal with time constant ~150 fs was resolved and is consistent with\nself-trapping. Potential applications of an optical control over a\nlight-induced defect placement with deep-sub-wavelength resolution is\ndiscussed.\n", "  X-ray absorption spectroscopy yields direct access to the electronic and\ngeometric structure of hybrid inorganic-organic interfaces formed upon\nadsorption of complex molecules at metal surfaces. The unambiguous\ninterpretation of corresponding spectra is challenged by the intrinsic\ngeometric flexibility of the adsorbates and the chemical interactions with the\ninterface. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of the extended\nadsorbate-substrate system are an established tool to guide peak assignment in\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of complex interfaces. We extend this to\nthe simulation and interpretation of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data\nin the context of functional organic molecules on metal surfaces using\ndispersion-corrected DFT calculations within the transition potential approach.\nOn the example of X-ray absorption signatures for the prototypical case of\n2H-porphine adsorbed on Ag(111) and Cu(111) substrates, we follow the two main\neffects of the molecule/surface interaction on XAS: (1) the substrate-induced\nchemical shift of the 1s core levels that dominates in physisorbed systems and\n(2) the hybridization-induced broadening and loss of distinct resonances that\ndominates in more chemisorbed systems.\n", "  According to the Special Theory of Relativity, there should be no resting\nframe in our universe. Such an assumption, however, could be in conflict with\nthe Standard Model of cosmology today, which regards the vacuum not as an empty\nspace. Thus, there is a strong need to experimentally test whether there is a\nresting frame in our universe or not. We propose that this can be done by\nprecisely measuring the masses of two charged particles moving in opposite\ndirections. If all inertial frames are equivalent, there should be no\ndetectable mass difference between these two particles. If there is a resting\nframe in the universe, one will observe a mass difference that is dependent on\nthe orientation of the laboratory frame. The detailed experimental setup is\ndiscussed in this paper.\n", "  In horizontal collaborations, carriers form coalitions in order to perform\nparts of their logistics operations jointly. By exchanging transportation\nrequests among each other, they can operate more efficiently and in a more\nsustainable way. Collaborative vehicle routing has been extensively discussed\nin the literature. We identify three major streams of research: (i) centralized\ncollaborative planning, (ii) decentralized planning without auctions, and (ii)\nauction-based decentralized planning. For each of them we give a structured\noverview on the state of knowledge and discuss future research directions.\n", "  We consider seismic imaging to include seismic inversion. Imaging could use\napproximate operator or time instead of depth. Processing in time is an\nimportant part of seismic imaging as well as processing in depth. We can\nclassify seismic imaging as quantitative versus qualitative methods.\nQuantitative method uses numerical methods to find the solution whose modeled\nseismic data approximates the input seismic records. Then we will progress to\nqualitative methods which have three aspects. The first aspect will be topology\nand geometry. The second aspect is semigroup method. The third aspect is to use\nnon-differentiable solution.\n", "  The absorption characteristics of Cr(III), Cr(VI), Cu(II) ions on intact\nliving cells Spirulina platensis (pH9.6) were studied by using a UV-VIS\nspectrophotometer. Also biosorption of these ions with cyanobacteria Spirulina\nplatensis were studied using equilibrium dialysis and atomic absorption\nanalysis.It was shown, that the absorption intensity of Spirulina platensis\ndecreases, when Cr(III), Cr(VI), Cu(II) ions are added. Significant difference\nbetween the absorption intensity for Cu(II) Spirulina platensis and Cr(VI),\nCr(III) Spirulina platensis were observed. Cu(II) was more effectively adsorbed\nby cyanobacterium than Cr(VI) and Cr(III). The biosorption constants for Cu(II)\nSpirulina platensis is higher than for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) Spirulina platensis\n2.69 and 10.15- fold respectively.\n", "  New equilibrium solution branches for plane Couette flow are reported which\nadd to the inventory of known solution branches. The exact solutions are found\nby projecting known equilibria onto the resolvent modes of McKeon & Sharma (J.\nFl. Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336-382) to generate approximate solutions that\nare subsequently used as seeds in a Newton-Krylov-hookstep search. Searches\ninitialised with these projections have a convergence rate of 96%, leading to\nthe discovery of 16 new equilibria. The low-dimensional nature of the resulting\nequilibria is attributed to the projection generated by the resolvent model;\nresolvent modes for a given equilibrium solution span a low-dimensional space\nwhich the solution approximately inhabits. This property is exploited to\ngenerate new branches of equilibria in plane Couette flow, and to jump to known\nbranches. The new branches include bifurcations from previously known\nbifurcation curves and a disconnected bifurcation curve which displays\ninteresting behaviour when continued in Reynolds number. The unstable manifolds\nof the new exact coherent states are also computed to expand the known state\nspace structure of plane Couette flow.\n", "  Employing the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers offers the\npossibility to extend the functionality of conventional electronic devices,\nwhile colloidal chemistry can be used to synthesize inexpensive and tuneable\nnanomaterials. In order to benefit from both concepts, Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction has been investigated in colloidal lead sulphide nanosheets by\nelectrical measurements on the circular photo-galvanic effect. Lead sulphide\nnanosheets possess rock salt crystal structure, which is centrosymmetric. The\nsymmetry can be broken by quantum confinement, asymmetric vertical interfaces\nand a gate electric field leading to Rashba-type band splitting in momentum\nspace at the M points, which results in an unconventional selection mechanism\nfor the excitation of the carriers. The effect, which is supported by\nsimulations of the band structure using density functional theory, can be tuned\nby the gate electric field and by the thickness of the sheets. Spin-related\nelectrical transport phenomena in colloidal materials open a promising pathway\ntowards future inexpensive spintronic devices.\n", "  We demonstrate the potential for research and outreach of mixed polygon and\nhydrodynamic modeling and multi-waveband rendering in the interactive 3-D\nastrophysical virtual laboratory Shape. In 3-D special effects and animation\nsoftware for the mass media, computer graphics techniques that mix polygon and\nnumerical hydrodynamics have become common place. In astrophysics, however,\ninteractive modeling with polygon structures has only become available with the\nsoftware Shape. Numerical hydrodynamic simulations and their visualization are\nusually separate, while in Shape it is integrated with the polygon modeling\napproach that requires no programming by the user. With two generic examples,\nwe demonstrate that research and outreach modeling can be achieved with\ntechniques similar to those used in the media industry with the added\ncapability for physical rendering at any wavelength band, yielding more\nrealistic radiation modeling. Furthermore, we show how the hydrodynamics and\nthe polygon mesh modeling can be mixed to achieve results that are superior to\nthose obtained using either one of these modeling techniques alone.\n", "  Understanding the response of complex materials to external force is central\nto fields ranging from materials science to biology. Here, we describe a novel\ntype of mechanical adaptation in cross-linked networks of F-actin, a\nubuiquitous protein found in eukaryotic cells. We show that shear stress\nchanges its nonlinear mechanical response even long after that stress is\nremoved. The duration, magnitude and direction of forcing history all impact\nchanges in mechanical response. The `memory' of the forcing history is\nlong-lived, but can be erased by force application in the opposite direction.\nWe further show that the observed mechanical adaptation is consistent with\nstress-dependent changes in the nematic order of the constituent filaments.\nThus, this mechano-memory is a type of nonlinear hysteretic response in which\nan applied, \"training\" strain modifies the nonlinear elasticity. This\ndemonstrates that F-actin networks can encode analog read-write\nmechano-memories, which can be used for adaptation to mechanical stimuli.\n", "  We report the generation of photo-induced electromotive force (EMF) on the\nsurface of c-axis oriented InN epitaxial films grown on sapphire substrates. It\nhas been found that under the illumination of above band gap light, EMFs of\ndifferent magnitudes and polarities are developed on different parts of the\nsurface of these layers. The effect is not the same as the surface photovoltaic\nor Dember potential effects, both of which result in the development of EMF\nacross the layer thickness, not between different contacts on the surface.\nThese layers are also found to show negative photoconductivity effect.\nInterplay between surface photo-EMF and negative photoconductivity result in a\nunique scenario, where the magnitude as well as the sign of the photo-induced\nchange in conductivity become bias dependent. A theoretical model is developed,\nwhere both the effects are attributed to the 2D electron gas (2DEG) channel\nformed just below the film surface as a result of the transfer of electrons\nfrom certain donor-like-surfacestates, which are likely to be resulting due to\nthe adsorption of certain groups/adatoms on the film surface. In the model, the\nphoto-EMF effect is explained in terms of a spatially inhomogeneous\ndistribution of these groups/adatoms over the surface resulting in a lateral\nnon-uniformity in the depth distribution of the potential profile confining the\n2DEG. Existence of such an inhomogeneity in the distribution of surface\npotential has indeed been experimentally found for these layers.\n", "  TUS (Track Ultraviolet Setup) is the first space experiment aimed to check\nthe possibility of registering extreme energy cosmic rays (EECRs) at E>50 EeV\nby measuring the fluorescence signal of extensive air showers in the\natmosphere. The detector operates as a part of the scientific payload of the\nLomonosov satellite for more than a year. We describe an algorithm of searching\nfor EECR events in the TUS data and briefly discuss a number of candidates\nselected by formal criteria.\n"]}
