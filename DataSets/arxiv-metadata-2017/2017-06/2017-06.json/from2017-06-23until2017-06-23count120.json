Due to their motion there is a strong\npossibility of generation of color magnetic field. It is shown that however\nhadrons are color singlet particles they may have non-zero color magnetic\nmoment. Due to this color magnetic moment hadrons can show color interaction.\nIn this paper we have studied the chromomagnetic properties of nuclear matter.\n", "  The Domus Aurea, Nero's last \"palace\" constructed in the very heart of\nancient Rome, is a true masterpiece of Roman architecture. We explore here\nsymbolic aspects of the emperor's project, analysing the archaeoastronomy of\nthe best preserved part of the Domus, the Esquiline Wing. In particular, we\nstudy the so-called Octagonal Room, the huge vaulted room which is in many\nrespects a predecessor of the Pantheon. The project of the room turns out to be\nconnected with astronomy, as will be that of the Hadrian's Pantheon 60 years\nlater. Indeed, the divinization and \"solarisation\" of the emperor placed at the\nequinoxes as a point of balance in the heavens are shown to be explicitly\nreferred to in the rigorous orientation of the plan and in the peculiar\ngeometry of the design of the dome.\n", "  It is shown that certain fractionally-charged quasiparticles can be modeled\non \\(D-\\)dimensional lattices in terms of unconventional yet simple Fock\nalgebras of creation and annihilation operators. These unconventional Fock\nalgebras are derived from the usual fermionic algebra by taking roots (the\nsquare root, cubic root, etc.) of the usual fermionic creation and annihilation\noperators. If the fermions carry non-Abelian charges, then this approach\nfractionalizes the Abelian charges only. In particular, the \\(m\\)th-root of a\nspinful fermion carries charge \\(e/m\\) and spin \\(1/2\\). Just like taking a\nroot of a complex number, taking a root of a fermion yields a mildly non-unique\nresult. As a consequence, there are several possible choices of quantum\nexchange statistics for fermion-root quasiparticles. These choices are tied to\nthe dimensionality \\(D=1,2,3,\\dots\\) of the lattice by basic physical\nconsiderations. One particular family of fermion-root quasiparticles is\ndirectly connected to the parafermion zero-energy modes expected to emerge in\ncertain mesoscopic devices involving fractional quantum Hall states. Hence, as\nan application of potential mesoscopic interest, I investigate numerically the\nhybridization of Majorana and parafermion zero-energy edge modes caused by\nfractionalizing but charge-conserving tunneling.\n", "  Let $\\mathcal{A}$ be a completely rational local M\\\"obius covariant net on\n$S^1$, which describes a set of chiral observables. We show that local M\\\"obius\ncovariant nets $\\mathcal{B}_2$ on 2D Minkowski space which contains\n$\\mathcal{A}$ as chiral left-right symmetry are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith Morita equivalence classes of Q-systems in the unitary modular tensor\ncategory $\\mathrm{DHR}(\\mathcal{A})$. The M\\\"obius covariant boundary\nconditions with symmetry $\\mathcal{A}$ of such a net $\\mathcal{B}_2$ are given\nby the Q-systems in the Morita equivalence class or by simple objects in the\nmodule category modulo automorphisms of the dual category. We generalize to\nreducible boundary conditions.\n  To establish this result we define the notion of Morita equivalence for\nQ-systems (special symmetric $\\ast$-Frobenius algebra objects) and\nnon-degenerately braided subfactors. We prove a conjecture by Kong and Runkel,\nnamely that Rehren's construction (generalized Longo-Rehren construction,\n$\\alpha$-induction construction) coincides with the categorical full center.\nThis gives a new view and new results for the study of braided subfactors.\n", "  Phenomenological aspects of simple dark matter models are studied. We discuss\nways to discriminate the dark matter models in future experiments. We find that\nthe measurements of the branching fraction of the Higgs boson into two photons\nand the electric dipole moment of the electron as well as the direct detection\nexperiments are quite useful in discriminating particle models of dark matter.\nWe also discuss the prospects of finding new particles in dark sector at the\nLHC/ILC.\n", "  In the worldline formalism, scalar Quantum Electrodynamics on a 2-dimensional\nlattice is related to the areas of closed loops on this lattice. We exploit\nthis relationship in order to determine the general structure of the moments of\nthe algebraic areas over the set of loops that have fixed number of edges in\nthe two directions. We show that these moments are the product of a\ncombinatorial factor that counts the number of such loops, by a polynomial in\nthe numbers of steps in each direction. Our approach leads to an algorithm for\nobtaining explicit formulas for the moments of low order.\n", "  Using the data sets taken at center-of-mass energies above 4 GeV by the\nBESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, we search for the reaction e+e- ->\ngamma_ISR X(3872) -> gamma_ISR pi+pi-J/psi via the Initial State Radiation\ntechnique. The production of a resonance with quantum numbers J^PC = 1^++ such\nas the X(3872) via single photon e+e- annihilation is forbidden, but is allowed\nby a next-to-leading order box diagram. We do not observe a significant signal\nof X(3872), and therefore give an upper limit for the electronic width times\nthe branching fraction Gamma_ee^X(3872)Br(X(3872) -> pi+pi-J\\psi) < 0.13 eV at\nthe 90% confidence level. This measurement improves upon existing limits by a\nfactor of 46. Using the same final state, we also measure the electronic width\nof the psi(3686) to be Gamma_ee^psi(3686) = 2231 +- 18 +- 99 eV.\n", "  This paper reports on a computational study of the model error in the\nLANS-alpha and NS-alpha deconvolution models of homogeneous isotropic\nturbulence. The focus is on how well the model error may be characterized by a\nstochastic force. Computations are also performed for a new turbulence model\nobtained as a rescaled limit of the deconvolution model. The technique used is\nto plug a solution obtained from direct numerical simulation of the\nincompressible Navier--Stokes equations into the competing turbulence models\nand to then compute the time evolution of the resulting residual. All\ncomputations have been done in two dimensions rather than three for convenience\nand efficiency. When the effective averaging length scale in any of the models\nis $\\alpha_0=0.01$ the time evolution of the root-mean-squared residual error\ngrows as $\\sqrt t$. This growth rate is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nmodel error may be characterized by a stochastic force. When $\\alpha_0=0.20$\nthe residual error grows linearly. Linear growth suggests that the model error\npossesses a systematic bias which dominates the stochastic terms. Finally, for\n$\\alpha_0=0.04$ the LANS-alpha model possessed systematic bias; however, for\nthis value of $\\alpha_0$ the higher-order alpha models that were tested did\nnot.\n", "  We propose an extension of the Plefka expansion, which is well known for the\ndynamics of discrete spins, to stochastic differential equations with\ncontinuous degrees of freedom and exhibiting generic nonlinearities. The\nscenario is sufficiently general to allow application to e.g. biochemical\nnetworks involved in metabolism and regulation. The main feature of our\napproach is to constrain in the Plefka expansion not just first moments akin to\nmagnetizations, but also second moments, specifically two-time correlations and\nresponses for each degree of freedom. The end result is an effective equation\nof motion for each single degree of freedom, where couplings to other variables\nappear as a self-coupling to the past (i.e. memory term) and a coloured noise.\nThis constitutes a new mean field approximation that should become exact in the\nthermodynamic limit of a large network, for suitably long-ranged couplings. For\nthe analytically tractable case of linear dynamics we establish this exactness\nexplicitly by appeal to spectral methods of Random Matrix Theory, for Gaussian\ncouplings with arbitrary degree of symmetry.\n", "  In this paper, we study the quasineutral limit and asymptotic behaviors for\nthe quantum Navier-Stokes-Possion equation. We apply a formal expansion\naccording to Debye length and derive the neutral incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequation. To establish this limit mathematically rigorously, we derive uniform\n(in Debye length) estimates for the remainders, for well-prepared initial data.\nIt is demonstrated that the quantum effect do play important roles in the\nestimates and the norm introduced depends on the Planck constant $\\hbar>0$.\n", "  Charge transfer (CT) is a fundamental and ubiquitous mechanism in biology,\nphysics and chemistry. Here, we evidence that CT dynamics can be altered by\nmulti-layered hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) substrates. Taking\ntriphenylene:perylene diimide dyad supramolecular self-assemblies as a model\nsystem, we reveal longer-lived CT states in presence of HMM structures with\nboth charge separation and recombination characteristic times increased by\nfactors of 2.4 and 1.7, i.e. relative variations of 140 and 73 %, respectively.\nTo rationalise these experimental results in terms of driving force, we\nsuccessfully introduce image dipole interactions in Marcus theory. The\nnon-local effect herein demonstrated is directly linked to the number of\nmetal-dielectric pairs, can be formalised in the dielectric permittivity, and\nis presented as a solid analogue to local solvent polarizability effects. This\nmodel and extra PH3T:PC60BM results show the generality of this non-local\nphenomenon and that a wide range of kinetic tailoring opportunities can arise\nfrom substrate engineering. This work paves the way toward the design of\nartificial substrates to control CT dynamics of interest for applications in\noptoelectronics and chemistry.\n", "  The issue of the orientation of Greek Temples has been the subject of several\ndebates since the end of the 19 century. In fact, although a general tendency\nto orientation within the arc of the rising sun is undeniable, specific\npatterns and true meaning remain obscure. With the aim of shedding light on\nthis problem we present here a new complete, high precision survey of the\ntemples of Akragas, the so called Valley of the Temples UNESCO site. Our\nresults include a important temple which was essentially yet unpublished, and\nmost of all show that very different reasons influenced the orientation\nchoices, some symbolical, but others by far more practical, besides the general\nrule of orienting to the rising sun. In particular, the existence of temples\norientated in accordance with the towns grid, as well as to the cardinal points\nirrespectively from the sun's declination associated to true east at the uneven\nhorizon, is evidenced. Finally, for two temples having anomalous orientations a\nstellar and a lunar proposal are made respectively\n", "  The presence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons introduce a natural degeneracy inside\nthe vacuum solutions of the non-linear formulations of massive gravity in the\nsame spirit of the $\\sigma$-models. When the gravitational effects are taken\ninto account, and the observers are located at any distance with respect to the\nsource, this degeneracy corresponds to a multiplicity (flow) of the fundamental\nscales of the theory. The different values of the fundamental scales are\nconnected each other through the broken generators of the theory.\n", "  The placement of the Middle Bronze Age settlement Villaggio dei Faraglioni on\nthe Ustica island, one of the best preserved prehistoric village of the\nMediterranean area, is analyzed from a cognitive point of view, taking into\naccount archaeoastronomy and landscape archaeology aspects. It turns out that\nthe place might have been selected because of its privileged position with\nrespect to the landscape, better than conforming to utilitarian/defensive\nconsiderations, as instead occurs for contemporary, for instance Mycenaean,\nsites. From the village it was indeed possible to follow the rising and setting\nof the sun in the months close to the winter solstice on the two elevated peaks\nexisting on the opposite side of the island, in a symmetric way. As a\nconsequence, the inhabitants could determine the day of the winter solstice\nwith an approximation of a few days, using this partial calendar for\nagricultural and navigational purposes. A possible astronomical orientation of\nthe urban layout is also analyzed\n", "  We consider the problem of a subnetwork of observed nodes embedded into a\nlarger bulk of unknown (i.e. hidden) nodes, where the aim is to infer these\nhidden states given information about the subnetwork dynamics. The biochemical\nnetworks underlying many cellular and metabolic processes are important\nrealizations of such a scenario as typically one is interested in\nreconstructing the time evolution of unobserved chemical concentrations\nstarting from the experimentally more accessible ones. We present an\napplication to this problem of a novel dynamical mean field approximation, the\nExtended Plefka Expansion, which is based on a path integral description of the\nstochastic dynamics. As a paradigmatic model we study the stochastic linear\ndynamics of continuous degrees of freedom interacting via random Gaussian\ncouplings. The resulting joint distribution is known to be Gaussian and this\nallows us to fully characterize the posterior statistics of the hidden nodes.\nIn particular the equal-time hidden-to-hidden variance -- conditioned on\nobservations -- gives the expected error at each node when the hidden time\ncourses are predicted based on the observations. We assess the accuracy of the\nExtended Plefka Expansion in predicting these single node variances as well as\nerror correlations over time, focussing on the role of the system size and the\nnumber of observed nodes.\n", "  One of the most strikingly universal features of the high temperature\nsuperconductors is that the superconducting phase emerges in the close\nproximity of the antiferromagnetic phase, and the interplay between these two\nphases poses a long standing challenge. It is commonly believed that,as the\nantiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed to zero,\nthere appears a quantum critical point, around which the existence of\nantiferromagnetic fluctuation is responsible for the development of the\nsuperconductivity. In contrast to this scenario, we report the discovery of a\nbi-critical point identified at 2.88 GPa and 26.02 K in the pressurized high\nquality single crystal Ca0.73La0.27FeAs2 by complementary in situ high pressure\nmeasurements. At the critical pressure, we find that the antiferromagnetism\nsuddenly disappears and superconductivity simultaneously emerges at almost the\nsame temperature, and that the external magnetic field suppresses the\nsuperconducting transition temperature but hardly affects the antiferromagnetic\ntransition temperature.\n", "  We consider asymtotics of a domino tiling model on a class of domains which\nwe call rectangular Aztec diamonds. We prove the Law of Large Numbers for the\ncorresponding height functions and provide explicit formulas for the limit. For\na special class of examples, the explicit parametrization of the frozen\nboundary is given. It turns out to be an algebraic curve with very special\nproperties. Moreover, we establish the convergence of the fluctuations to the\nGaussian Free Field in appropriate coordinates. Our main tool is a recently\ndeveloped moment method for discrete particle systems.\n", "  We propose a method of describing a phase transition in a cell fluid model\nwith pair interaction potential that includes repulsive and attractive parts.\nAn exact representation of the grand partition function of this model is\nobtained in the collective variables set. The behavior of the system at\ntemperatures below and above the critical one is explored in the approximation\nof a mean-field type. An explicit analytic form of the equation of state which\nis applicable in a wide range of temperatures is derived, taking into account\nan equation between chemical potential and density. The coexistence curve, the\nsurface of the equation of state and the phase diagram of the cell Morse fluid\nare plotted.\n", "  A coupled quantum dot--nanocavity system in the weak coupling regime of\ncavity quantumelectrodynamics is dynamically tuned in and out of resonance by\nthe coherent elastic field of a $f_{\\rm SAW}\\simeq800\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ surface\nacoustic wave. When the system is brought to resonance by the sound wave,\nlight-matter interaction is strongly increased by the Purcell effect. This\nleads to a precisely timed single photon emission as confirmed by the second\norder photon correlation function $g^{(2)}$. All relevant frequencies of our\nexperiment are faithfully identified in the Fourier transform of $g^{(2)}$,\ndemonstrating high fidelity regulation of the stream of single photons emitted\nby the system.\n", "  It's pointed out that the values of the generators derived by the modern\ngyrokinetic theory are inappropriately amplified by the pullback transform with\nthe existence of electromagnetic perturbation, and the trajectory equations of\nthe gyrocenter include terms containing the perturbative magnetic vector\npotential not in the form of its curl. These terms are not physical ones, as\nthe perturbative magnetic vector potential could include an arbitrary gauge\nterm. In this paper, instead of the single-parameter Lie transform method\nutilized by the modern gyrokinetic theory, a multi-parameter Lie transform\nmethod is utilized. All characteristic scales of the system can be taken into\naccount. With the assistance of a kind of linear cancellation rule, the new\nmethod can decouple the gyroangle $\\theta$ from the remaining degrees of\nfreedom up to the second order of the parameter as the ratio between the Larmor\nradius and the transverse length scale of the equilibrium magnetic field. With\nthis new method, those nonphysical terms don't appear anymore in the trajectory\nequations.\n", "  We study the properties of bi-squeezed tripartite Gaussian states created by\ntwo spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes that share a common idler.\nWe give a complete description of the quantum correlations across of all\npartitions, as well as of the genuine multipartite entanglement, obtaining\nanalytical expressions for most of the quantities of interest. We find that the\nstate contains genuine tripartite entanglement, in addition to the bipartite\nentanglement among the modes that are directly squeezed. We also investigate\nthe effect of homodyne detection of the photons in the common idler mode, and\nanalyse the final reduced state of the remaining two signal modes. We find that\nthis measurement leads to a conversion of the coherence of the two signal modes\ninto entanglement, a phenomenon that can be regarded as a redistribution of\nquantum resources between the modes. The applications of these results to\nquantum optics and circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Higgs naturalness problem is solved if the growth of Einstein's\ngravitational interaction is softened at an energy $ \\lesssim 10^{11}\\,$GeV\n(softened gravity). We work here within an explicit realization where the\nEinstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is extended to include terms quadratic in the\ncurvature and a non-minimal coupling with the Higgs. We show that this solution\nis preserved by adding three right-handed neutrinos with masses below the\nelectroweak scale, accounting for neutrino oscillations, dark matter and the\nbaryon asymmetry. The smallness of the right-handed neutrino masses (compared\nto the Planck scale) and the QCD $\\theta$-term are also shown to be natural. We\nprove that a possible gravitational source of CP violation cannot spoil the\nmodel, thanks to the presence of right-handed neutrinos. Inflation is\napproximately described by the Starobinsky model in this context, and can occur\neven if we live in a metastable vacuum.\n", "  We present a new approach for predicting stable equilibrium shapes of\ncrystalline islands on flat substrates, as commonly occur through solid-state\ndewetting of thin films. The new theory is a generalization of the widely used\nWinterbottom construction i.e., an extension of the Wulff construction for\nparticles on substrates). This approach is equally applicable to cases where\nthe crystal surface energy is isotropic, weakly anisotropic, strongly\nanisotropic and \"cusped\". We demonstrate that, unlike in the classical\nWinterbottom approach, multiple equilibrium island shapes may be possible when\nthe surface energy is strongly anisotropic. We analyze these shapes through\nperturbation analysis, by calculating the first and second variations of the\ntotal free energy functional with respect to contact locations and island\nshape. Based on this analysis, we find the necessary conditions for stable\nequilibria and exploit this through a generalization of the Winterbottom\nconstruction to identify all possible stable equilibrium shapes. Finally, we\npropose a dynamical evolution method based on surface diffusion mass transport\nto determine whether all of the stable equilibrium shapes are dynamically\naccessible. Applying this approach, we demonstrate that islands with different\ninitial shapes may evolve into different stationary shapes and show that these\ndynamically-determined stationary states correspond to the predicted stable\nequilibrium shapes, as obtained from the generalized Winterbottom construction.\n", "  This monograph introduces the reader to basic notions of integrable\ntechniques for one-dimensional quantum systems. In a pedagogical way, a few\nexamples of exactly solvable models are worked out to go from the coordinate\napproach to the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, with some discussion on the finite\ntemperature thermodynamics. The aim is to provide the instruments to approach\nmore advanced books or to allow for a critical reading of research articles and\nthe extraction of useful information from them. We describe the solution of the\nanisotropic XY spin chain; of the Lieb-Liniger model of bosons with contact\ninteraction at zero and finite temperature; and of the XXZ spin chain, first in\nthe coordinate and then in the algebraic approach. To establish the connection\nbetween the latter and the solution of two dimensional classical models, we\nalso introduce and solve the 6-vertex model. Finally, the low energy physics of\nthese integrable models is mapped into the corresponding conformal field\ntheory. Through its style and the choice of topics, this book tries to touch\nall fundamental ideas behind integrability and is meant for students and\nresearchers interested either in an introduction to later delve in the advance\naspects of Bethe Ansatz or in an overview of the topic for broadening their\nculture.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger operator with constant magnetic field defined\non the half-plane with a Dirichlet boundary condition, $H_0$, and a decaying\nelectric perturbation $V$. We analyze the spectral density near the Landau\nlevels, which are thresholds in the spectrum of $H_0,$ by studying the Spectral\nShift Function (SSF) associated to the pair $(H_0+V,{H_0})$. For perturbations\nof a fixed sign, we estimate the SSF in terms of the eigenvalue counting\nfunction for certain compact operators. If the decay of $V$ is power-like, then\nusing pseudodifferential analysis, we deduce that there are singularities at\nthe thresholds and we obtain the corresponding asymptotic behavior of the SSF.\nOur technique gives also results for the Neumann boundary condition.\n", "  We investigate the $P-V$ criticality and the Maxwell equal area law for a\nfive-dimensional spherically symmetric AdS black hole with a scalar hair in the\nabsence of and in the presence of a Maxwell field, respectively. Especially in\nthe charged case, we give the exact $P-V$ critical values. More importantly, we\nanalyze the validity and invalidity of the Maxwell equal area law for the AdS\nhairy black hole in the scenarios without and with charges, respectively.\nWithin the scope of validity of the Maxwell equal area law, we point out that\nthere exists a representative van der Waals-type oscillation in the $P-V$\ndiagram. This oscillating part that indicates the phase transition from a small\nblack hole to a large one can be replaced by an isobar. The small and large\nblack holes share the same Gibbs free energy. We also give the distribution of\nthe critical points in the parameter space both without and with charges, and\nobtain for the uncharged case the fitting formula of the co-existence curve.\nMeanwhile, the latent heat is calculated, which gives the energy released or\nabsorbed between the small and large black hole phases in the\nisothermal-isobaric procedure.\n", "  Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) is a universal model for quantum\ncomputation. The combinatorial characterisation of determinism in this model,\npowered by measurements, and hence, fundamentally probabilistic, is the\ncornerstone of most of the breakthrough results in this field. The most general\nknown sufficient condition for a deterministic MBQC to be driven is that the\nunderlying graph of the computation has a particular kind of flow called Pauli\nflow. The necessity of the Pauli flow was an open question. We show that the\nPauli flow is necessary for real-MBQC, and not in general providing\ncounterexamples for (complex) MBQC. We explore the consequences of this result\nfor real MBQC and its applications. Real MBQC and more generally real quantum\ncomputing is known to be universal for quantum computing. Real MBQC has been\nused for interactive proofs by McKague. The two-prover case corresponds to\nreal-MBQC on bipartite graphs. While (complex) MBQC on bipartite graphs are\nuniversal, the universality of real MBQC on bipartite graphs was an open\nquestion. We show that real bipartite MBQC is not universal proving that all\nmeasurements of real bipartite MBQC can be parallelised leading to constant\ndepth computations. As a consequence, McKague techniques cannot lead to\ntwo-prover interactive proofs.\n", "  We present designs for scalable quantum computers composed of qubits encoded\nin aggregates of four or more Majorana zero modes, realized at the ends of\ntopological superconducting wire segments that are assembled into\nsuperconducting islands with significant charging energy. Quantum information\ncan be manipulated according to a measurement-only protocol, which is\nfacilitated by tunable couplings between Majorana zero modes and nearby\nsemiconductor quantum dots. Our proposed architecture designs have the\nfollowing principal virtues: (1) the magnetic field can be aligned in the\ndirection of all of the topological superconducting wires since they are all\nparallel; (2) topological $T$-junctions are not used, obviating possible\ndifficulties in their fabrication and utilization; (3) quasiparticle poisoning\nis abated by the charging energy; (4) Clifford operations are executed by a\nrelatively standard measurement: detection of corrections to quantum dot\nenergy, charge, or differential capacitance induced by quantum fluctuations;\n(5) it is compatible with strategies for producing good approximate magic\nstates.\n", "  We investigate the holographic R\\'enyi entropy for two-dimensional $\\mathcal\nN=(2,2)$ superconformal field theory (SCFT), which is dual to $\\mathcal N=2$\nsupergravity in AdS$_3$ background. In SCFT we have the stress tensor, current,\nand their supersymmetric partners, and in supergravity we have the graviton,\nvector field, and two gravitinos. We get the R\\'enyi mutual information of two\nshort intervals on complex plane in expansion by the cross ratio $x$ to order\n$x^4$, and R\\'enyi entropy of one interval on torus in expansion by\n$q=\\exp(-2\\pi\\beta/L)$, with $\\beta$ being the inverse temperature and $L$\nbeing the spatial period, to order $q^2$. We calculate in both the supergravity\nand SCFT sides, and find matches of the results.\n", "  We consider the gravitational force exerted on a point-like perturber of mass\n$M$ travelling within a uniform gaseous, opaque medium at constant velocity\n$V$. The perturber irradiates the surrounding gas with luminosity $L$. The\ndiffusion of the heat released is modelled with a uniform thermal diffusivity\n$\\chi$. Using linear perturbation theory, we show that the force exerted by the\nperturbed gas on the perturber differs from the force without radiation (or\nstandard dynamical friction). Hot, underdense gas trails the mass, which gives\nrise to a new force component, the heating force, with direction $+V$, thus\nopposed to the standard dynamical friction. In the limit of low Mach numbers,\nthe heating force has expression $F_\\mathrm{heat}=\\gamma(\\gamma-1)GML/(2\\chi\nc_s^2)$, $c_s$ being the sound speed and $\\gamma$ the ratio of specific heats.\nIn the limit of large Mach numbers, $F_\\mathrm{heat}=(\\gamma-1)GML/(\\chi\nV^2)f(r_\\mathrm{min}V/4\\chi)$, where $f$ is a function that diverges\nlogarithmically as $r_\\mathrm{min}$ tends to zero. Remarkably, the force in the\nlow Mach number limit does not depend on the velocity. The equilibrium speed,\nwhen it exists, is set by the cancellation of the standard dynamical friction\nand heating force. In the low Mach number limit, it scales with the luminosity\nto mass ratio of the perturber. Using the above results suggests that Mars- to\nEarth-sized planetary embryos heated by accretion in a gaseous protoplanetary\ndisc should have eccentricities and inclinations that amount to a sizeable\nfraction of the disc's aspect ratio, for conditions thought to prevail at a few\nastronomical units.\n", "  We theoretically and numerically study the influence of both instantaneous\nand Raman-delayed Kerr nonlinearities as well as a long-wavelength pump in the\nterahertz (THz) emissions produced by two-color femtosecond filaments in air.\nAlthough the Raman-delayed nonlinearity induced by air molecules weakens THz\ngeneration, four-wave mixing is found to impact the THz spectra accumulated\nupon propagation via self-, cross-phase modulations and self-steepening.\nBesides, using the local current theory, we show that the scaling of\nlaser-to-THz conversion efficiency with the fundamental laser wavelength\nstrongly depends on the relative phase between the two colors, the pulse\nduration and shape, rendering a universal scaling law impossible. Scaling laws\nin powers of the pump wavelength may only provide a rough estimate of the\nincrease in the THz yield. We confront these results with comprehensive\nnumerical simulations of strongly focused pulses and of filaments propagating\nover meter-range distances.\n", "  A highly sensitive, general, and preferably nondestructive technique to\ndetect polar molecules would greatly advance a number of fields, in particular\nquantum science with cold and ultracold molecules. Here, we propose using\nresonant energy transfer between molecules and Rydberg atoms to detect\nmolecules. Based on an energy transfer cross section of $>10^{-6}\\,$cm$^2$ for\nsufficiently low collision energies, a near unit efficiency non-destructive\ndetection of basically any polar molecule species in a well defined internal\nstate should be possible.\n", "  This paper presents the method and performance of primary vertex\nreconstruction in proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment\nduring Run 1 of the LHC. The studies presented focus on data taken during 2012\nat a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. The performance has been\nmeasured as a function of the number of interactions per bunch crossing over a\nwide range, from one to seventy. The measurement of the position and size of\nthe luminous region and its use as a constraint to improve the primary vertex\nresolution are discussed. A longitudinal vertex position resolution of about 30\nmicrometers is achieved for events with high multiplicity of reconstructed\ntracks. The transverse position resolution is better than 20 micrometers and is\ndominated by the precision on the size of the luminous region. An analytical\nmodel is proposed to describe the primary vertex reconstruction efficiency as a\nfunction of the number of interactions per bunch crossing and of the\nlongitudinal size of the luminous region. Agreement between the data and the\npredictions of this model is better than 3% up to seventy interactions per\nbunch crossing.\n", "  We consider the problem of inferring the dynamics of unknown (i.e. hidden)\nnodes from a set of observed trajectories and study analytically the average\nprediction error and the typical relaxation time of correlations between\nerrors. We focus on a stochastic linear dynamics of continuous degrees of\nfreedom interacting via random Gaussian couplings in the infinite network size\nlimit. The expected error on the hidden time courses can be found as the\nequal-time hidden-to-hidden covariance of the probability distribution\nconditioned on observations. In the stationary regime, we analyze the phase\ndiagram in the space of relevant parameters, namely the ratio between the\nnumbers of observed and hidden nodes, the degree of symmetry of the\ninteractions and the amplitudes of the hidden-to-hidden and hidden-to-observed\ncouplings relative to the decay constant of the internal hidden dynamics. In\nparticular, we identify critical regions in parameter space where the\nrelaxation time and the inference error diverge, and determine the\ncorresponding scaling behaviour.\n", "  We have measured both the current-voltage ($I_\\mathrm{SD}$-$V_\\mathrm{GS}$)\nand capacitance-voltage ($C$-$V_\\mathrm{GS}$) characteristics of a\n$\\mathrm{MoS_2-LiNbO_3}$ field effect transistor. From the measured capacitance\nwe calculate the electron surface density and show that its gate voltage\ndependence follows the theoretical prediction resulting from the\ntwo-dimensional free electron model. This model allows us to fit the measured\n$I_\\mathrm{SD}$-$V_\\mathrm{GS}$ characteristics over the \\emph{entire range} of\n$V_\\mathrm{GS}$. Combining this experimental result with the measured\ncurrent-voltage characteristics, we determine the field effect mobility as a\nfunction of gate voltage. We show that for our device this improved combined\napproach yields significantly smaller values (more than a factor of 4) of the\nelectron mobility than the conventional analysis of the current-voltage\ncharacteristics only.\n", "  Emergence of a classical particle trajectory concept from the full quantum\ndescription is a key feature of quantum mechanics. Recent progress of solid\nstate on-demand sources has brought single-electron manipulation into the\nquantum regime, however, the quantum-to-classical crossover remains unprobed.\nHere we describe theoretically a mechanism for generating single-electron wave\npackets by tunneling from a driven localized state, and show how to tune the\ndegree of quantumness. Applying our theory to existing on-demand sources, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of an experimental investigation of\nquantum-to-classical crossover for single electrons, and open up yet unexplored\npotential for few-electron quantum technology devices.\n", "  We investigate, numerically and experimentally, the effect of thermo-optical\n(TO) chaos on direct soliton generation (DSG) in microresonators. When the pump\nlaser is scanned from blue to red and then stopped at a fixed wavelength, we\nfind that the solitons generated sometimes remain (survive) and sometimes\nannihilate subsequent to the end of the scan. We refer to the possibility of\nthese different outcomes arising under identical laser scan conditions as\ncoexistence of soliton annihilation and survival. Numerical simulations that\ninclude the thermal dynamics show that the coexistence of soliton annihilation\nand survival is explained by TO chaos accompanying comb generation. The random\nfluctuations of the cavity resonance occurring under TO chaos are also found to\ntrigger spontaneous soliton generation after the laser scan ends. The\ncoexistence of soliton annihilation and survival as well as spontaneous soliton\ngeneration are observed experimentally in a silicon-nitride microresonator. The\nelucidation of the role of TO chaos provides important insights into the\nsoliton generation dynamics in microresonators, which may eventually facilitate\nstraightforward soliton generation in fully-integrated microresonators.\n", "  We investigate a model of thin layer turbulence that follows the evolution of\nthe two-dimensional motions ${\\bf u}_{_{2D}} (x,y)$ along the horizontal\ndirections $(x,y)$ coupled to a single Fourier mode along the vertical\ndirection ($z$) of the form ${\\bf u}_q (x, y, z)=[v_x(x,y) \\sin(qz),\nv_y(x,y)\\sin(qz), v_z(x,y)\\cos(qz)\\, ]$, reducing thus the system to two\ncoupled, two-dimensional equations. The reduced dimensionality of the model\nallows a thorough investigation of the transition from a forward to an inverse\ncascade of energy as the thickness of the layer $H=\\pi/q$ is varied. Starting\nfrom a thick layer and reducing its thickness it is shown that two critical\nheights are met (i) one for which the forward unidirectional cascade (similar\nto three-dimensional turbulence) transitions to a bidirectional cascade\ntransferring energy to both small and large scales and (ii) one for which the\nbidirectional cascade transitions to a unidirectional inverse cascade when the\nlayer becomes very thin (similar to two-dimensional turbulence). The two\ncritical heights are shown to have different properties close to criticality\nthat we are able to analyze with numerical simulations for a wide range of\nReynolds numbers and aspect ratios.\n", "  For a wide variety of quantum potentials, including the textbook `instanton'\nexamples of the periodic cosine and symmetric double-well potentials, the\nperturbative data coming from fluctuations about the vacuum saddle encodes all\nnon-perturbative data in all higher non-perturbative sectors. Here we unify\nthese examples in geometric terms, arguing that the all-orders quantum action\ndetermines the all-orders quantum dual action for quantum spectral problems\nassociated with a classical genus one elliptic curve. Furthermore, for a\nspecial class of genus one potentials this relation is particularly simple:\nthis class includes the cubic oscillator, symmetric double-well, symmetric\ndegenerate triple-well, and periodic cosine potential. These are related to the\nChebyshev potentials, which are in turn related to certain ${\\mathcal N}=2$\nsupersymmetric quantum field theories, to mirror maps for hypersurfaces in\nprojective spaces, and also to topological $c=3$ Landau-Ginzburg models and\n`special geometry'. These systems inherit a natural modular structure\ncorresponding to Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions in alternative bases,\nwhich is especially important for the quantization. Insights from\nsupersymmetric quantum field theory suggest similar structures for more\ncomplicated potentials, corresponding to higher genus. Our approach is very\nelementary, using basic classical geometry combined with all-orders WKB.\n", "  We revisit the notion of nonclassical distance of states of bosonic quantum\nsystems introduced in [M. Hillery, Phys. Rev. A 35, 725 (1987)] in a general\nmultimode setting. After reviewing its definition, we establish some of its\ngeneral properties. We obtain new upper and lower bounds on the nonclassical\ndistance in terms of the supremum of the Husimi function of the state.\nConsidering several examples, we elucidate the cases for which our lower bound\nis tight, which include the multimode number states and a class of multimode\nN00N states. The latter provide examples of states of definite photon number $n\n\\geq 2$ whose nonclassical distance can be made arbitrarily close to the upper\nlimit of $1$ by increasing the number of modes. We show that the nonclassical\ndistance of the even and odd Schr\\\"odinger cat states is bounded away from\nunity regardless of how macroscopic the superpositions are, and that the\nnonclassical distance is not necessarily monotonically increasing with respect\nto macroscopicity.\n", "  We study the high Reynolds number limit of a viscous fluid in the presence of\na rough boundary. We consider the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations with Navier slip boundary condition, in a domain whose boundaries\nexhibit fast oscillations in the form $x_2 = \\varepsilon^{1+\\alpha}\n\\eta(x_1/\\varepsilon)$, $\\alpha > 0$. Under suitable conditions on the\noscillating parameter $\\varepsilon$ and the viscosity $\\nu$, we show that\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes system converge to solutions of the Euler system\nin the vanishing limit of both $\\nu$ and $\\varepsilon$. The main issue is that\nthe curvature of the boundary is unbounded as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$,\nwhich precludes the use of standard methods to obtain the inviscid limit. Our\napproach is to first construct an accurate boundary layer approximation to the\nEuler solution in the rough domain, and then to derive stability estimates for\nthis approximation under the Navier-Stokes evolution.\n", "  We investigate the variation of the driving force for crystallization of a\nsupercooled liquid along isomorphs, curves along which structure and dynamics\nare invariant. The variation is weak, and can be predicted accurately for the\nLennard-Jones fluid using a recently developed formalism and data at a\nreference temperature. More general analysis allows interpretation of\nexperimental data for molecular liquids such as dimethyl phthalate and\nindomethacin, and suggests that the isomorph scaling exponent $\\gamma$ in these\ncases is an increasing function of density, although this cannot be seen in\nmeasurements of viscosity or relaxation time.\n", "  We analyze the De Donder-Weyl covariant field equations for the topologically\nmassive Yang-Mills theory. These equations are obtained through the\nPoisson-Gerstenhaber bracket described within the polysymplectic framework.\nEven though the Lagrangian defining the system of our interest is singular, we\nshow that by appropriately choosing the polymomenta one may obtain an\nequivalent regular Lagrangian, thus avoiding the standard analysis of\nconstraints. Further, our simple treatment allows us to only consider the\nprivileged $(n-1)$-forms in order to obtain the correct field equations, in\nopposition to certain examples found in the literature.\n", "  The effects of hydrostatic pressure on the static magnetism in\nEu(Fe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ are investigated by complementary\nelectrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility and single-crystal neutron\ndiffraction measurements. A specific pressure-temperature phase diagram of\nEu(Fe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is established. The structural phase\ntransition, as well as the spin-density-wave order of Fe sublattice, is\nsuppressed gradually with increasing pressure and disappears completely above\n2.0 GPa. In contrast, the magnetic order of Eu sublattice persists over the\nwhole investigated pressure range up to 14 GPa, yet displaying a non-monotonic\nvariation with pressure. With the increase of the hydrostatic pressure, the\nmagnetic state of Eu evolves from the canted antiferromagnetic structure in the\nground state, via a pure ferromagnetic structure under the intermediate\npressure, finally to a possible \"novel\" antiferromagnetic structure under the\nhigh pressure. The strong ferromagnetism of Eu coexists with the\npressure-induced superconductivity around 2 GPa. The change of the magnetic\nstate of Eu in Eu(Fe$_{0.925}$Co$_{0.075}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ upon the application\nof hydrostatic pressure probably arises from the modification of the indirect\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the Eu$^{2+}$ moments\ntuned by external pressure.\n", "  One dimensional hybrid systems play an important role in the search for\ntopological superconductivity. Nevertheless, all one dimensional hybrid systems\nso far have been externally defined. Here we show that one-dimensional domain\nwall in a nematic superconductor can serve as an emergent hybrid system in the\npresence of spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete setting we study the domain wall\nbetween nematic domains in FeSe, which is well established to be a nematic\nsuperconductor. We first show on the symmetry grounds that spin-triplet pairing\ncan be induced at the domain wall by constructing a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We\nthen demonstrate using Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach that such nematic domain\nwall supports zero energy bound states which would satisfy Majorana condition.\nWell-known existence of these domain walls at relatively high temperatures,\nwhich can in principle be located and investigated with scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy, presents new opportunities for a search for realization of Majorana\nbound states.\n", "  Excitation of relativistic electron beam driven wakefield in a cold plasma is\nstudied using 1-D fluid simulation techniques where the effect of ion motion is\nincluded. We have excited the wakefield using a ultra-relativistic,\nhomogeneous, rigid electron beam with different beam densities and mass-ratios\n(ratio of electron's to ion's mass). We have shown that the numerically excited\nwakefield is in a good agreement with the analytical results of Rosenzweig et\nal. \\textcolor{blue}{[Physical Review A. 40, 9, (1989)]} for several plasma\nperiods. It is shown here that the excited wake wave is equivalent to the\ncorresponding \"Khachatryan mode\" \\textcolor{blue}{[Physical Review E. 58, 6,\n(1998)]}. After several plasma periods, it is found that the excited wake wave\ngradually modifies and finally breaks, exhibiting sharp spikes in density and\nsawtooth like structure in electric field profile. It is shown here that the\nexcited wake wave breaks much below the Khachatryan's wave breaking limit.\n", "  We present here a generalization of the thermal discrete dipole approximation\n(TDDA) that allows us to describe the near-field radiative heat transfer\nbetween finite objects of arbitrary shape that exhibit magneto-optical (MO)\nactivity. We also extend the TDDA approach to describe the thermal emission of\na finite object with and without MO activity. Our method is also valid for\noptically anisotropic materials described by an arbitrary permittivity tensor\nand we provide simple closed formulas for the basic thermal quantities that\nconsiderably simplify the implementation of TDDA method. Moreover, we show that\nemploying our TDDA approach one can rigorously demonstrate Kirchhoff's\nradiation law relating the emissivity and absorptivity of an arbitrary MO\nobject. Our work paves the way for the theoretical study of the active control\nof emission and radiative heat transfer between MO systems of arbitrary size\nand shape.\n", "  We consider the factorization problem of matrix symbols relative to a closed\ncontour, i.e., a Riemann-Hilbert problem, where the symbol depends analytically\non parameters. We show how to define a function $\\tau$ which is locally\nanalytic on the space of deformations and that is expressed as a Fredholm\ndeterminant of an operator of \"integrable\" type in the sense of\nIts-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov. The construction is not unique and the\nnon-uniqueness highlights the fact that the tau function is really the section\nof a line bundle.\n", "  A novel approach to quintessential inflation model building is studied,\nwithin the framework of $\\alpha$-attractors, motivated by supergravity\ntheories. Inflationary observables are in excellent agreement with the latest\nCMB observations, while quintessence explains the dark energy observations\nwithout any fine-tuning. The model is kept intentionally minimal, avoiding the\nintroduction of many degrees of freedom, couplings and mass scales. In stark\ncontrast to $\\Lambda$CDM, for natural values of the parameters, the model\nattains transient accelerated expansion, which avoids the future horizon\nproblem, while it maintains the field displacement mildly sub-Planckian such\nthat the flatness of the quintessential tail is not lifted by radiative\ncorrections and violations of the equivalence principle (fifth force) are under\ncontrol. In particular, the required value of the cosmological constant is near\nthe eletroweak scale. Attention is paid to the reheating of the Universe, which\navoids gravitino overproduction and respects nucleosynthesis constraints.\nKination is treated in a model independent way. A spike in gravitational waves,\ndue to kination, is found not to disturb nucleosynthesis as well.\n", "  Multiple line nodes in energy-band gaps are found in semimetals preserving\nmirror-reflection symmetry. We classify possible configurations of multiple\nline nodes with crossing points (crossing line nodes) under point-group\nsymmetry. Taking the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) into account, we also\nclassify topological phase transitions from crossing-line-node Dirac semimetals\nto other topological phases, e.g., topological insulators and point-node\nsemimetals. This study enables one to find crossing-line-node semimetal\nmaterials and their behavior in the presence of SOI from the band structure in\nthe absence of SOI without detailed calculations. As an example, the theory\napplies to hexagonal rare-earth trihydrides with the HoD3 structure and\nclarifies that it is a crossing-line-node Dirac semimetal hosting three line\nnodes.\n", "  Classically, the tendency towards spontaneous synchronization is strongest if\nthe natural frequencies of the self-oscillators are as close as possible. We\nshow that this wisdom fails in the deep quantum regime, where the uncertainty\nof amplitude narrows down to the level of single quanta. Under these\ncircumstances identical self-oscillators cannot synchronize and detuning their\nfrequencies can actually help synchronization. The effect can be understood in\na simple picture: Interaction requires an exchange of energy. In the quantum\nregime, the possible quanta of energy are discrete. If the extractable energy\nof one oscillator does not exactly match the amount the second oscillator may\nabsorb, interaction, and thereby synchronization is blocked. We demon- strate\nthis effect, which we coin quantum synchronization blockade, in the minimal\nexample of two Kerr-type self-oscillators and predict consequences for small\noscillator networks, where synchronization between blocked oscillators can be\nmediated via a detuned oscillator. We also propose concrete implementations\nwith super- conducting circuits and trapped ions. This paves the way for\ninvestigations of new quantum synchronization phenomena in oscillator networks\nboth theoretically and experimentally.\n", "  The 11-type Fe-chalcogenides belong to the family of Fe-based\nsuperconductors. In these compounds, the interstitial Fe is known to strongly\ninfluence the magnetic and superconducting properties. Here we present the\nchemical homogeneity range of ternary compounds Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$\nbased on powder x-ray diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray analysis and\nmagnetization measurements. Our investigations show that the maximum amount of\nexcess Fe in homogeneous Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ decreases with increase in\nSe substitution for Te. Using our synthesis procedure, single-phase\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$, with $~0.5 \\leq x <~1$ could not be formed for any\namount of excess Fe. Further, the superconducting volume fraction in the\nmaterial is found to be strongly suppressed by excess Fe.\n", "  Context. Low mass stars are currently the best targets for searches for rocky\nplanets in the habitable zone of their host star. Over the last 13 years,\nprecise radial velocities measured with the HARPS spectrograph have identified\nover a dozen super-Earths and Earth-mass planets (msin i<10Mearth ) around M\ndwarfs, with a well understood selection function. This well defined sample\ninforms on their frequency of occurrence and on the distribution of their\norbital parameters, and therefore already constrains our understanding of\nplanetary formation. The subset of these low-mass planets that were found\nwithin the habitable zone of their host star also provide prized targets for\nfuture atmospheric biomarkers searches. Aims. We are working to extend this\nplanetary sample to lower masses and longer periods through dense and long-term\nmonitoring of the radial velocity of a small M dwarf sample. Methods. We\nobtained large numbers of HARPS spectra for the M dwarfs GJ 3138, GJ 3323, GJ\n273, GJ 628 and GJ 3293, from which we derived radial velocities (RVs) and\nspectroscopic activity indicators. We searched them for variabilities,\nperiodicities, Keplerian modulations and correlations, and attribute the\nradial-velocity variations to combinations of planetary companions and stellar\nactivity. Results. We detect 12 planets, of which 9 are new with masses ranging\nfrom 1.17 to 10.5 Mearth . Those planets have relatively short orbital periods\n(P<40 d), except two of them with periods of 217.6 and 257.8 days. Among these\nsystems, GJ 273 harbor two planets with masses close to the one of the Earth.\nWith a distance of 3.8 parsec only, GJ 273 is the second nearest known\nplanetary system - after Proxima Centauri - with a planet orbiting the\ncircumstellar habitable zone.\n", "  The vortices that appear repeatedly and suggest turbulent dynamics are\ncrucial to the understanding of sheared turbulence. These vortices produce\norder out of chaos, benefiting the turbulence modelling that focuses only on\nstatistically stable quantities. In three dimensions, the hairpin vortices [J.\nZhou, R. Adrian, S. Balachandar, T. Kendall, J. Fluid Mech., 387, 353 (1999);\nR. Adrian, Phys. Fluids, 19, 041301 (2007)] play such a fundamental role in the\ntransport of momentum and energy for wall bounded sheared turbulence. In two\ndimensions where the atmospheric flow has a great play, the fundamental\nvortices have yet to be observed. Here we report the experimental finding of\nthe slanted vortices in the quasi-two-dimensional sheared soap-film turbulence.\nWe also demonstrate how these slanted fundamental vortices, which result from\nthe interaction between the sheared mean flow and the random turbulent\nvortices, could possibly connect to the turbulent transport. The finding here\nmight introduce another means of understanding the planetary turbulence where\nthe mean flow is commonly existent and nonuniform.\n", "  Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are thought to be the core-collapse explosions\nof massive stars whose ejecta interact with He-rich circumstellar material\n(CSM). We report the discovery of a SN Ibn, with the longest rise-time ever\nobserved, OGLE-2014-SN-131. We discuss the potential powering mechanisms and\nthe progenitor nature of this peculiar stripped-envelope (SE),\ncircumstellar-interacting SN. Optical photometry and spectroscopy were obtained\nwith multiple telescopes including VLT, NTT, and GROND. We compare light curves\nand spectra with those of other known SNe Ibn and Ibc. CSM velocities are\nderived from the spectral analysis. The SN light curve is modeled under\ndifferent assumptions about its powering mechanism (${^{56}}$Ni decay,\nCSM-interaction, magnetar) in order to estimate the SN progenitor parameters.\nOGLE-2014-SN-131 spectroscopically resembles SNe Ibn such as SN 2010al. Its\npeak luminosity and post-peak colors are also similar to those of other SNe\nIbn. However, it shows an unprecedentedly long rise-time and a much broader\nlight curve compared to other SNe Ibn. Its bolometric light curve can be\nreproduced by magnetar and CSM-interaction models, but not by a\n${^{56}}$Ni-decay powering model. To explain the unusually long rise-time, the\nbroad light curve, the light curve decline, and the spectra characterized by\nnarrow emission lines, we favor a powering mechanism where the SN ejecta are\ninteracting with a dense CSM. The progenitor of OGLE-2014-SN-131 was likely a\nWolf-Rayet star with a mass greater than that of a typical SN Ibn progenitor,\nwhich expelled the CSM that the SN is interacting with.\n", "  We consider the large-time dynamics of one-dimensional processes involving\nadsorption and desorption of extended hard-core particles (dimers,\ntrimers,\\,$\\cdots,k$-mers), while interacting through their constituent\nmonomers. Desorption can occur whether or not these latter adsorbed together,\nwhich leads to reconstitution of $k$-mers and the appearance of sectors of\nmotion with nonlocal conservation laws for $k \\ge 3$. Dynamic exponents of the\nsector including the empty chain are evaluated by finite-size scaling analyses\nof the relaxation times embodied in the spectral gaps of evolution operators.\nFor attractive interactions it is found that in the low-temperature limit such\ntime scales converge to those of the Glauber dynamics, thus suggesting a\ndiffusive universality class for $k \\ge 2$. This is also tested by simulated\nquenches down to $T=0$ where a common scaling function emerges. By contrast,\nunder repulsive interactions the low-temperature dynamics is characterized by\nmetastable states which decay subdiffusively to a highly degenerate and\npartially jammed phase.\n", "  We apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, mainly principal component\nanalysis (PCA), to compare and contrast the phase behavior and phase\ntransitions in several classical spin models - the square and\ntriangular-lattice Ising models, the Blume-Capel model, a highly degenerate\nbiquadratic-exchange spin-one Ising (BSI) model, and the 2D XY model, and\nexamine critically what machine learning is teaching us. We find that\nquantified principal components from PCA not only allow exploration of\ndifferent phases and symmetry-breaking, but can distinguish phase transition\ntypes and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors\nhave a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the\nfrustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point\nto incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of\nthe BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo\nanalysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase\ntransition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the\n`charge' correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin\nconfigurations points to some of the limitations of PCA. Finally, we employ a\nnonlinear unsupervised machine learning procedure, the `antoencoder method',\nand demonstrate that it too can be trained to capture phase transitions and\ncritical points.\n", "  The momentum distribution and particle correlation due to the mass difference\nwere studied both in the case of the conventional expectation value and in the\ncase of $q$-expectation value, when the momentum distribution is described by a\nTsallis distribution with the entropic parameter $q \\ge 1$. The magnitude of\nthe momentum distribution for hard modes increases as $q$ increases, and the\n$q$-dependence of the momentum distribution is quite weak for soft modes. The\ncorrelation at $q>1$ is larger than that at $q=1$ for soft modes, while the\ncorrelation at $q>1$ is smaller than that at $q=1$ for hard modes. The\n$q$-dependence of these quantities in the case of $q$-expectation value is\nweaker than that in the case of the conventional expectation value,\nrespectively.\n", "  The problem of finding bounds of time-averaged characteristics of dynamical\nsystems, such as for example the bound on the mean energy dissipation rate in a\nturbulent flow governed by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, is\nconsidered. It is shown that both the well-known background flow method of\nDoering and Constantin and the direct method proposed by Seis in 2015\ncorrespond to the same quadratic storage functional in the framework of the\nindefinite storage functional method. In particular, a background flow can be\nfound corresponding to the linear functional used in the direct method and vice\nversa. It is shown that any bound obtained with the background flow method can\nalso be obtained by the direct method. The reverse is true subject to an\nadditional constraint. The relative advantages of the three methods are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The dependence of Brans-Dicke (BD) parameter upon the scalar field, for\ndifferent cosmological era of the expanding universe, has been explored. The\ntime dependence of the scalar field has been determined and thereby the\nexplicit time dependence of the BD parameter has been obtained. Experimental\nobservations regarding the time dependence of the gravitational constant has\nbeen considered for this study. The scale factor, Hubble parameter,\ndeceleration parameter, matter density, gravitational constant and the density\nparameters for matter and dark energy have been expressed in terms of the BD\nparameter and its time derivatives, showing its role in cosmic expansion.\n", "  Results of a search for physics beyond the Standard Model in events\ncontaining an energetic photon and large missing transverse momentum with the\nATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are reported. As the number of\nevents observed in data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1\n$\\textrm fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV, is in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, exclusion limits in\nmodels where dark-matter candidates are pair-produced are determined. For\ndark-matter production via an axial-vector or a vector mediator in the\ns-channel, this search excludes mediator masses below 750-1200 GeV for\ndark-matter candidate masses below 230-480 GeV at 95% confidence level,\ndepending on the couplings. In an effective theory of dark-matter production,\nthe limits restrict the value of the suppression scale $M_{*}$ to be above 790\nGeV at 95% confidence level. A limit is also reported on the production of a\nhigh-mass scalar resonance by processes beyond the Standard Model, in which the\nresonance decays to $Z\\gamma$ and the Z boson subsequently decays into\nneutrinos.\n", "  We present DsixTools, a Mathematica package for the handling of the\ndimension-six Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Among other features,\nDsixTools allows the user to perform the full one-loop Renormalization Group\nEvolution of the Wilson coefficients in the Warsaw basis. This is achieved\nthanks to the SMEFTrunner module, which implements the full one-loop anomalous\ndimension matrix previously derived in the literature. In addition, DsixTools\nalso contains modules devoted to the matching to the $\\Delta B = \\Delta S =\n1,2$ and $\\Delta B = \\Delta C = 1$ operators of the Weak Effective Theory at\nthe electroweak scale and their QCD and QED Renormalization Group Evolution\nbelow the electroweak scale.\n", "  For the constant-stress layer of wall turbulence, two-point correlations of\nvelocity fluctuations are studied theoretically by using the attached-eddy\nhypothesis, i.e., a phenomenological model of a random superposition of\nenergy-containing eddies that are attached to the wall. While the previous\nstudies had invoked additional assumptions, we focus on the minimum assumptions\nof the hypothesis to derive its most general forms of the correlation\nfunctions. They would allow us to use or assess the hypothesis without any\neffect of those additional assumptions. We also study the energy spectra and\nthe two-point correlations of the rate of momentum transfer and of the rate of\nenergy dissipation.\n", "  Since its proposal by Anderson, resonating valence bonds (RVB) formed by a\nsuperposition of fluctuating singlet pairs have been a paradigmatic concept in\nunderstanding quantum spin liquids (QSL). Here, we show that excitations\nrelated to singlet breaking on nearest-neighbor bonds describe the high-energy\npart of the excitation spectrum in YbMgGaO4, the effective spin-1/2 frustrated\nantiferromagnet on the triangular lattice, as originally considered by\nAnderson. By a thorough single-crystal inelastic neutron scattering (INS)\nstudy, we demonstrate that nearest-neighbor RVB excitations account for the\nbulk of the spectral weight above 0.5 meV. This renders YbMgGaO4 the first\nexperimental system where putative RVB correlations restricted to nearest\nneighbors are observed, and poses a fundamental question of how complex\ninteractions on the triangular lattice conspire to form this unique many-body\nstate.\n", "  A versatile control of magnetic systems, widely used to store information,\ncan also enable manipulating Majorana bounds states (MBS) and implementing\nfault-tolerant quantum information processing. The proposed platform relies on\nthe proximity-induced superconductivity in a two-dimensional electron gas\nplaced next to an array of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). A change in the\nmagnetization configuration in the MTJ array creates tunable magnetic textures\nthereby removing several typical requirements for MBS: strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, applied magnetic field, and confinement by one-dimensional structures\nwhich complicates demonstrating non-Abelian statistics through braiding. Recent\nadvances in fabricating two-dimensional epitaxial superconductor/semiconductor\nheterostructures and designing tunable magnetic textures support the\nfeasibility of this novel platform for MBS.\n", "  We present an in-depth study of the non-equilibrium statistics of the\nirreversible work produced during sudden quenches in proximity to the\nstructural linear-zigzag transition of ion Coulomb crystals in 1+1 dimensions.\nBy employing both an analytical approach based on a harmonic expansion and\nnumerical simulations, we show the divergence of the average irreversible work\nin proximity to the transition. We show that the non-analytic behaviour of the\nwork fluctuations can be characterized in terms of the critical exponents of\nthe quantum Ising chain. Due to the technological advancements in trapped ion\nexperiments, our results can be readily verified.\n", "  We study the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon (NLKG) equation with a\nconvolution potential, and we prove that solutions with small analytic norm\nremain small for exponentially long times. The result is uniform with respect\nto $c \\geq 1$, which however has to belong to a set of large measure.\n", "  Key features of the mechanical response of amorphous particulate materials,\nsuch as foams, emulsions, and granular media, to applied stress are determined\nby the frequency and size of particle rearrangements that occur as the system\ntransitions from one mechanically stable state to another. This work describes\ncoordinated experimental and computational studies of bubble rafts, which are\nquasi-two dimensional systems of bubbles confined to the air-water interface.\nWe focus on small mechanically stable clusters of four, five, six, and seven\nbubbles with two different sizes with diameter ratio $\\sigma_L/\\sigma_S = 1.4$.\nFocusing on small bubble clusters, which can be viewed as subsystems of a\nlarger system, allows us to investigate the full ensemble of clusters that\nform, measure the respective frequencies with which the clusters occur, and\ndetermine the form of the bubble-bubble interactions. We emphasize several\nimportant results. First, for clusters with N > 5 bubbles, we find using\ndiscrete element simulations that short-range attractive interactions between\nbubbles give rise to a larger ensemble of distinct mechanically stable clusters\ncompared to that generated by long-range attractive interactions. The\nadditional clusters in systems with short-range attractions possess larger gaps\nbetween pairs of neighboring bubbles on the periphery of the clusters. The\nensemble of bubble clusters observed in experiments is similar to the ensemble\nof clusters with long-range attractive interactions. We also compare the\nfrequency with which each cluster occurs in simulations and experiments. We\nfind that the cluster frequencies are extremely sensitive to the protocol used\nto generate them and only weakly correlated to the energy of the clusters.\n", "  Kerr optical frequency combs with multi-gigahertz spacing have previously\nbeen demonstrated in chip-scale microresonators, with potential applications in\ncoherent communication, spectroscopy, arbitrary waveform generation, and radio\nfrequency photonic oscillators. In general, the harmonics of a frequency comb\nare identically polarized in a single microresonator. In this work, we report\nthat one comb in one polarization is generated by an orthogonally polarized\nsoliton comb and two low-noise, orthogonally polarized combs interact with each\nother and exist simultaneously in a single microresonator. The second comb\ngeneration is attributed to the strong cross-phase modulation with the\northogonally polarized soliton comb and the high peak power of the intracavity\nsoliton pulse. Experimental results show that a second frequency comb is\nexcited even when a continuous wave light as a \"seed\"-with power as low as 0.1\nmW-is input, while its own power level is below the threshold of comb\ngeneration. Moreover, the second comb has a concave envelope, which is\ndifferent from the sech2 envelope of the soliton comb. This is due to the\nfrequency mismatch between the harmonics and the resonant frequency. We also\nfind that the repetition rates of these two combs coincide, although two\northogonal resonant modes are characterized by different free spectral ranges.\n", "  In Phys. Rev. D 79, 064016 (2009) it was claimed that quasinormal modes which\nany stationary, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black hole emits\nin the eikonal regime are determined by the parameters of the circular null\ngeodesic: the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal mode are multiples of\nthe frequency and instability timescale of the circular null geodesics\nrespectively. We shall consider asymptotically flat black hole in the\nEinstein-Lovelock theory, find analytical expressions for gravitational\nquasinormal modes in the eikonal regime and analyze the null geodesics.\nComparison of the both phenomena shows that the expected link between the null\ngeodesics and quasinormal modes is violated in the Einstein-Lovelock theory.\nNevertheless, the correspondence exists for a number of other cases and here we\nformulate its actual limits.\n", "  Here we discuss our recent investigations of the ionospheric plasma by using\nvery low and low frequency (VLF/LF) radio waves. We give a review of how to\ndetect different low ionospheric reactions (sudden ionospheric disturbances) to\nvarious terrestrial and extra-terrestrial events, show their classification\naccording to intensity and time duration, and present some methods for their\ndetections in time and frequency domains. Investigations of detection in time\ndomain are carried out for intensive long-lasting perturbations induced by\nsolar X-ray flares and for short-lasting perturbations caused by gamma ray\nbursts. We also analyze time variations of signals used in the low ionospheric\nmonitoring after earthquake events. In addition, we describe a procedure for\nthe detection of acoustic and gravity waves from the VLF/LF signal analysis in\nfrequency domain. The research of the low ionospheric plasma is based on data\ncollected by the VLF/LF receivers located in Belgrade, Serbia.\n", "  The consistency relations in large scale structure relate the lower-order\ncorrelation functions with their higher-order counterparts. They are direct\noutcome of the underlying symmetries of a dynamical system and can be tested\nusing data from future surveys such as Euclid. Using techniques from standard\nperturbation theory (SPT), previous studies of consistency relation have\nconcentrated on continuity-momentum (Euler)-Poisson system of an ideal fluid.\nWe investigate the consistency relations in effective field theory (EFT) which\nadjusts the SPT predictions to account for the departure from the ideal fluid\ndescription on small scales. We provide detailed results for the 3D density\ncontrast $\\delta$ as well as the {\\em scaled} divergence of velocity\n$\\bar\\theta$. Assuming a $\\Lambda$CDM background cosmology, we find the\ncorrection to SPT results becomes important at $k \\gtrsim 0.05 \\rm h/Mpc$ and\nthat the suppression from EFT to SPT results that scales as square of the wave\nnumber $k$, can reach $40\\%$ of the total at $k \\approx 0.25\\rm h/Mpc$ at\n$z=0$. We have also investigated whether effective field theory corrections to\nmodels of primordial non-Gaussianity can alter the squeezed limit behaviour,\nfinding the results to be rather insensitive to these counterterms. In\naddition, we present the EFT corrections to the squeezed limit of the\nbispectrum in redshift space which may be of interest for tests of theories of\nmodified gravity.\n", "  Large pulsar glitches (like the ones detected in the Vela) are though to be a\nconsequence of the superfluid component present in the interior of mature\nneutron stars. However strong entrainment challenges this picture. We study the\nimpact of entrainment on the angular momentum that can be exchanged between the\nnormal component and the superfluid during a glitch by means of a consistent\nglobal model. This allows to estimate the maximum angular momentum reservoir\nstored into the superfluid component of the star: the essential ingredient are\nnewly calculated mesoscopic pinning forces that block the superfluid vorticity\nin the crust of the neutron star. This method can also provide a quantitative\ntest for global models of rotating neutron stars, as well as for microphysical\ninputs present in literature (like entrainment parameters and pinning forces).\n", "  We explore the topological properties of double-Weyl semimetals with cold\natoms in optical lattices. We first propose to realize a tight-binding model of\nsimulating the double-Weyl semimetal with a pair of double-Weyl points by\nengineering the atomic hopping in a three-dimensional optical lattice. We show\nthat the double-Weyl points with topological charges of \\$pm2$ behave as sink\nand source of Berry flux in momentum space connecting by two Fermi arcs and\nthey are stabilized by the \\$C_{4h}$ point-group symmetry. By applying a\nrealizable \\$C_4$ breaking term, we find that each double-Weyl point splits\ninto two single-Weyl points and obtain rich phase diagrams in the parameter\nspace spanned by the strengths of an effective Zeeman term and the \\$C_4$\nbreaking term, which contains a topological and a normal insulating phases and\ntwo topological Weyl semimetal phases with eight and four single-Weyl points,\napart from the double-Weyl semimetal phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate with\nnumerical simulations that (i) the mimicked double- and single-Weyl points can\nbe detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions after a Bloch\noscillation; (ii) the Chern number of different quantum phases in the phase\ndiagram can be extracted from the center shift of the hybrid Wannier functions,\nwhich can be directly measured with the time-of-flight imaging; (iii) the band\ntopology of the \\$C_4$ symmetric Bloch Hamiltonian can be detected simply from\nmeasuring the spin polarization at the high symmetry momentum points with a\ncondensate in the optical lattice. The proposed system would provide a\npromising platform for elaborating the intrinsic exotic physics of double-Weyl\nsemimetals and the related topological phase transitions.\n", "  N-polar GaN p-n diodes are realized on single-crystal N-polar GaN bulk wafers\nby plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth. The current-voltage\ncharacteristics show high-quality rectification and electroluminescence\ncharacteristics with a high on/off current ratio and interband photon emission.\nThe measured electroluminescence spectrum is dominated by strong near-band edge\nemission, while deep level luminescence is greatly suppressed. A very low\ndislocation density leads to a high reverse breakdown electric field. The low\nleakage current N-polar diodes open up several potential applications in\npolarization-engineered photonic and electronic devices.\n", "  Besides the magnetic Lorentz force familiar from the Hall effect in metals\nand semiconductors, there exists a mechanism for charging peculiar to\nsuperconductors that is caused by the pair-potential gradient (PPG). We\nincorporate it in the augmented quasiclassical equations of superconductivity\nwith the Lorentz force to study charging of an isolated vortex in an\nequilibrium s-wave type-II superconductor. It is found that the PPG mechanism\ngives rise to charging concentrated within the core whose magnitude at the core\ncenter can be 10 to 100 times larger than that caused by the Lorentz force. Our\ndetailed calculations on the spatial, temperature, and\nmagnetic-penetration-depth dependences of the vortex-core charge reveal that\nthe PPG mechanism contributes dominantly to the core charging of the isolated\nvortex over a wide parameter range. The two mechanisms are also found to work\nadditively at the core center for the present model with an isotropic Fermi\nsurface.\n", "  Epitaxial Fe(Se,Te) thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition on\n(La0.18Sr0.82)(Al0.59Ta0.41)O3 (LSAT), CaF2-buffered LSAT and bare CaF2\nsubstrates, which exhibit an almost identical in-plane lattice parameter. The\ncomposition of all Fe(Se,Te) films were determined to be FeSe0.7Te0.3 by energy\ndispersive X-ray spectroscopy, irrespective of the substrate. Albeit the\nlattice parameters of all templates have comparable values, the in-plane\nlattice parameter of the FeSe0.7Te0.3 films varies significantly. We found that\nthe superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of FeSe0.7Te0.3 thin films is\nstrongly correlated with their a-axis lattice parameter. The highest Tc of over\n19 K was observed for the film on bare CaF2 substrate, which is related to\nunexpectedly large in-plane compressive strain originating mostly from the\nthermal expansion mismatch between the FeSe0.7Te0.3 film and the substrate.\n", "  The optical spectrum of liquid water is analyzed by subsystem time-dependent\ndensity functional theory. We provide simple explanations for several important\n(and so far elusive) features. Due to the disordered environment surrounding\neach water molecule, the joint density of states of the liquid is much broader\nthan that of the vapor. This results in a red shifted Urbach tail. Confinement\neffects provided by the first solvation shell are responsible for the blue\nshift of the first absorption peak compared to the vapor. In addition, we also\ncharacterize many-body excitonic effects. These dramatically affect the\nspectral weights at low frequencies, contributing to the refractive index by a\nsmall but significant amount.\n", "  Renyi entropy and central charge, $C_T$, are calculated for a coexact p--form\non an even sphere with particular reference to the conformally invariant case.\nIt is shown, for example, that the entanglement entropy is minus the standard\nconformal anomaly with no `shift' being required.\n  The shift necessary for a conformal p--form, when using a hyperbolic\ntechnique, is predicted, on a numerical basis, to be (minus) the entanglement\nentropy of a conformal (p-1)-form.\n  The central charges agree numerically with a general formula of Buchel {\\it\net al}.\n", "  Granulates are ubiquitous in nature and technology, but despite their great\nimportance, their dynamics are by far less well understood than those of\nliquids. We demonstrate in an almost compactly filled flat (Hele-Shaw) cell,\nwhere slow horizontal rotation simulates a variable gravitational force, that\nunexpected dynamic structures may arise under geometrical restrictions. The\ncell motion drives regular flow in the compact interior, and convection rolls\ncombine with segregation. The container fill level is crucial for the dynamic\nregime. A transition from chute flow at lower fill levels to convection in\ndensely packed containers is found. These observations suggest the existence of\ncomparable phenomena in situations where so far no systematic search for\ndynamic patterns has been performed.\n", "  The significant optical and size benefits of using a curved focal surface for\nimaging systems have been well studied yet never brought to market for lack of\na high-quality, mass-producible, curved image sensor. In this work we\ndemonstrate that commercial silicon CMOS image sensors can be thinned and\nformed into accurate, highly curved optical surfaces with undiminished\nfunctionality. Our key development is a pneumatic forming process that avoids\nrigid mechanical constraints and suppresses wrinkling instabilities. A\ncombination of forming-mold design, pressure membrane elastic properties, and\ncontrolled friction forces enables us to gradually contact the die at the\ncorners and smoothly press the sensor into a spherical shape. Allowing the die\nto slide into the concave target shape enables a threefold increase in the\nspherical curvature over prior approaches having mechanical constraints that\nresist deformation, and create a high-stress, stretch-dominated state. Our\nprocess creates a bridge between the high precision and low-cost but planar\nCMOS process, and ideal non-planar component shapes such as spherical imagers\nfor improved optical systems. We demonstrate these curved sensors in prototype\ncameras with custom lenses, measuring exceptional resolution of 3220\nline-widths per picture height at an aperture of f/1.2 and nearly 100% relative\nillumination across the field. Though we use a 1/2.3\" format image sensor in\nthis report, we also show this process is generally compatible with many state\nof the art imaging sensor formats. By example, we report photogrammetry test\ndata for an APS-C sized silicon die formed to a 30$^\\circ$ subtended spherical\nangle. These gains in sharpness and relative illumination enable a new\ngeneration of ultra-high performance, manufacturable, digital imaging systems\nfor scientific, industrial, and artistic use.\n", "  Super-Eddington mass accretion has been suggested as an efficient mechanism\nto grow supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We investigate the imprint left by\nthe radiative efficiency of the super-Eddington accretion process on the\nclustering of quasars using a new semi-analytic model of galaxy and quasar\nformation based on large-volume cosmological $N$-body simulations. Our model\nincludes a simple model for the radiative efficiency of a quasar, which\nimitates the effect of photon trapping for a high mass accretion rate. We find\nthat the model of radiative efficiency affects the relation between the quasar\nluminosity and the quasar host halo mass. The quasar host halo mass has only\nweak dependence on quasar luminosity when there is no upper limit for quasar\nluminosity. On the other hand, it has significant dependence on quasar\nluminosity when the quasar luminosity is limited by its Eddington luminosity.\nIn the latter case, the quasar bias also depends on the quasar luminosity, and\nthe quasar bias of bright quasars is in agreement with observations. Our\nresults suggest that the quasar clustering studies can provide a constraint on\nthe accretion disc model.\n", "  We introduce both an exactly solvable model and a coupled-layer construction\nfor an exotic, three-dimensional phase of matter with immobile topological\nexcitations that carry a protected internal degeneracy. Unitary transformations\non this degenerate Hilbert space may be implemented by braiding certain\npoint-like excitations. This provides a new way of extending non-Abelian\nstatistics to three-dimensions.\n", "  TWA 3A is the most recent addition to a small group of young binary systems\nthat both actively accrete from a circumbinary disk and have spectroscopic\norbital solutions. As such, it provides a unique opportunity to test binary\naccretion theory in a well-constrained setting. To examine TWA 3A's\ntime-variable accretion behavior, we have conducted a two-year, optical\nphotometric monitoring campaign, obtaining dense orbital phase coverage (~20\nobservations per orbit) for ~15 orbital periods. From U-band measurements we\nderive the time-dependent binary mass accretion rate, finding bursts of\naccretion near each periastron passage. On average, these enhanced accretion\nevents evolve over orbital phases 0.85 to 1.05, reaching their peak at\nperiastron. The specific accretion rate increases above the quiescent value by\na factor of ~4 on average but the peak can be as high as an order of magnitude\nin a given orbit. The phase dependence and amplitude of TWA 3A accretion is in\ngood agreement with numerical simulations of binary accretion with similar\norbital parameters. In these simulations, periastron accretion bursts are\nfueled by periodic streams of material from the circumbinary disk that are\ndriven by the binary orbit. We find that TWA 3A's average accretion behavior is\nremarkably similar to DQ Tau, another T Tauri binary with similar orbital\nparameters, but with significantly less variability from orbit to orbit. This\nis only the second clear case of orbital-phase-dependent accretion in a T Tauri\nbinary.\n", "  Single-bed whole-body positron emission tomography based on resistive plate\nchamber detectors (RPC-PET) has been proposed for human studies, as a\ncomplementary resource to scintillator-based PET scanners. The purpose of this\nwork is mainly about providing a reconstruction solution to such whole-body\nsingle-bed data collection on an event-by-event basis. We demonstrate a fully\nthree-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF)-based reconstruction algorithm that is\ncapable of processing the highly inclined lines of response acquired from a\nsystem with a very large axial field of view, such as those used in RPC-PET.\nSuch algorithm must be sufficiently fast that it will not compromise the\nclinical workflow of an RPC-PET system. We present simulation results from a\nvoxelized version of the anthropomorphic NCAT phantom, with oncological lesions\nintroduced into critical regions within the human body. The list-mode data was\nreconstructed with a TOF-weighted maximum-likelihood expectation maximization\n(MLEM). To accelerate the reconstruction time of the algorithm, a\nmulti-threaded approach supported by graphical processing units (GPUs) was\ndeveloped. Additionally, a TOF-assisted data division method is suggested that\nallows the data from nine body regions to be reconstructed independently and\nmuch more rapidly. The application of a TOF-based scatter rejection method\nreduces the overall body scatter from 57.1% to 32.9%. The results also show\nthat a 300-ps FWHM RPC-PET scanner allows for the production of a reconstructed\nimage in 3.5 minutes following a 7-minute acquisition upon the injection of 2\nmCi of activity (146 M coincidence events). We present for the first time a\nfull realistic reconstruction of a whole body, long axial coverage, RPC-PET\nscanner. We demonstrate clinically relevant reconstruction times comparable (or\nlower) to the patient acquisition times on both multi-threaded CPU and GPU.\n", "  The magnetic activity levels of planet host stars may differ from that of\nstars not known to host planets in several ways. Hot Jupiters may induce\nactivity in their hosts through magnetic interactions, or through tidal\ninteractions by affecting their host's rotation or convection. Measurements of\nphotospheric, chromospheric, or coronal activity might then be abnormally high\nor low compared to control stars that do not host hot Jupiters, or might be\nmodulated at the planet's orbital period. Such detections are complicated by\nthe small amplitude of the expected signal, by the fact that the signals may be\ntransient, and by the difficulty of constructing control samples due to\nexoplanet detection biases and the uncertainty of field star ages. We review\nthese issues, and discuss avenues for future progress in the field.\n", "  Most quark actions in lattice QCD encounter difficulties with chiral symmetry\nand its spontaneous breakdown. Minimally doubled fermions (MDF) are a category\nof strictly local chiral lattice fermions, whose continuum limit reproduces two\ndegenerate quark flavours. The two poles of their Dirac operator are aligned\nsuch that symmetries under charge conjugation or reflection of one particular\ndirection are explictly broken at finite lattice spacing. Properties of MDF are\nscrutinised with regard to broken symmetry and meson spectrum to discern their\nsuitability for numerical studies of QCD. Interactions induce anisotropic\noperator mixing for MDF. Hence, restoration of broken symmetries in the\ncontinuum limit requires three counterterms, one of which is power-law\ndivergent. Counterterms and operator mixing are studied perturbatively for two\nvariants of MDF. Two independent non-perturbative procedures for removal of the\npower-law divergence are developed by means of a numerical study of hadronic\nobservables for one variant of MDF in quenched approximation. Though three out\nof four pseudoscalar mesons are affected by lattice artefacts, the spectrum's\ncontinuum limit is consistent with two-flavour QCD. Thus, suitability of MDF\nfor numerical studies of QCD in the quenched approximation is demonstrated.\n", "  Quantum computing is no longer a nascent field. Programmable quantum\nannealing devices with more that 1000 qubits are commercially available. How\ndoes one know that a putative quantum annealing device is indeed quantum? How\nshould one go about benchmarking its performance and compare it to classical\nalgorithms? How can its performance be improved by error correction? In this\ncontribution to the focus collection on \"What would you do with 1000 qubits?\",\nwe review the work we and others have done in this area, since the first D-Wave\nquantum annealer with 108 qubits was made available to us. Some of the lessons\nwe have learned will be useful when other quantum computing platforms reach a\nsimilar scale, and practitioners will attempt to demonstrate quantum speedup.\n", "  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been used as ultrasensitive\nmagnetometers to perform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of\nstatistically polarized samples at 1 - 100 nm length scales. However, the\nspectral linewidth is typically limited to the kHz level, both by the NV sensor\ncoherence time and by rapid molecular diffusion of the nuclei through the\ndetection volume which in turn is critical for achieving long nuclear coherence\ntimes. Here we provide a blueprint for a set-up that combines a sensitivity\nsufficient for detecting NMR signals from nano- to micron-scale samples with a\nspectral resolution that is limited only by the nuclear spin coherence, i.e.\ncomparable to conventional NMR. Our protocol detects the nuclear polarization\ninduced along the direction of an external magnetic field with near surface NV\ncenters using lock-in detection techniques to enable phase coherent signal\naveraging. Using NV centers in a dual role of NMR detector and optical\nhyperpolarization source to increase signal to noise, and in combination with\nBayesian interference models for signal processing, nano/microscale NMR\nspectroscopy can be performed on sub-millimolar sample concentrations, several\norders of magnitude better than the current state of the art.\n", "  The purpose of this study is to investigate the structure and evolution of\nknowledge spillovers across technological domains. Specifically, dynamic\npatterns of knowledge flow among 29 technological domains, measured by patent\ncitations for eight distinct periods, are identified and link prediction is\ntested for capability for forecasting the evolution in these cross-domain\npatent networks. The overall success of the predictions using the Katz metric\nimplies that there is a tendency to generate increased knowledge flows mostly\nwithin the set of previously linked technological domains. This study\ncontributes to innovation studies by characterizing the structural change and\nevolutionary behaviors in dynamic technology networks and by offering the basis\nfor predicting the emergence of future technological knowledge flows.\n", "  We argue that four-dimensional black hole evaporation inevitably produces an\ninfinite number of soft particles in addition to the thermally distributed\n`hard' Hawking quanta, and moreover that the soft and hard particles are highly\ncorrelated. This raises the possibility that quantum purity is restored by\ncorrelations between the hard and soft radiation, while inclusive measurements\nwhich omit the soft radiation observe the thermal Hawking spectrum. In theories\nwhose only stable particle is the graviton, conservation laws are used to argue\nthat such correlations are in principle sufficient for the soft gravitons to\npurify the hard thermal ones.\n", "  In order to understand the flare trigger mechanism, we conducted\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using a coronal magnetic\nfield model derived from data observed by the Hinode satellite. Several types\nof magnetic bipoles were imposed into the photospheric boundary of the\nNon-linear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) model of Active Region NOAA 10930 on 2006\nDecember 13 to investigate what kind of magnetic disturbance may trigger the\nflare. As a result, we confirm that certain small bipole fields, which emerge\ninto the highly sheared global magnetic field of an active region, can\neffectively trigger a flare. These bipole fields can be classified into two\ngroups based on their orientation relative to the polarity inversion line: the\nso called opposite polarity (OP) and reversed shear (RS) structures as it was\nsuggested by Kusano et al. (2012). We also investigated the structure of the\nfootpoints of reconnected field lines. By comparing the distribution of\nreconstructed field lines and the observed flare ribbons, the trigger structure\nof the flare can be inferred. Our simulation suggests that the data-constrained\nsimulation taking into account both the large-scale magnetic structure and the\nsmall-scale magnetic disturbance such as emerging fluxes is a good way to find\nout a flare productive active region for space weather prediction.\n", "  While the dynamics of polymer chains in equilibrium media is well understood\nby now, the polymer dynamics in active non-equilibrium environments can be very\ndifferent. Here we study the dynamics of polymers in a viscous medium\ncontaining self-propelled particles in two dimensions by using Brownian\ndynamics simulations. We find that the polymer center of mass exhibits a\nsuperdiffusive motion at short to intermediate times and the motion turns\nnormal at long times, but with a greatly enhanced diffusivity. Interestingly,\nthe long time diffusivity shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the\nchain length and stiffness. We analyze how the polymer conformation and the\naccumulation of the self-propelled particles, and therefore the directed motion\nof the polymer, are correlated. At the point of maximal polymer diffusivity,\nthe polymer has preferentially bent conformations maintained by the balance\nbetween the chain elasticity and the propelling force generated by the active\nparticles. We also consider the barrier crossing dynamics of actively-driven\npolymers in a double-well potential. The barrier crossing times are\ndemonstrated to have a peculiar non-monotonic dependence, related to that of\nthe diffusivity. This effect can be potentially utilized for sorting of\npolymers from solutions in \\textit{in vitro} experiments.\n", "  Shape analyses of tephra grains result in understanding eruption mechanism of\nvolcanoes. However, we have to define and select parameter set such as\nconvexity for the precise discrimination of tephra grains. Selection of the\nbest parameter set for the recognition of tephra shapes is complicated.\nActually, many shape parameters have been suggested. Recently, neural network\nhas made a great success in the field of machine learning. Convolutional neural\nnetwork can recognize the shape of images without human bias and shape\nparameters. We applied the simple convolutional neural network developed for\nthe handwritten digits to the recognition of tephra shapes. The network was\ntrained by Morphologi tephra images, and it can recognize the tephra shapes\nwith approximately 90% of accuracy.\n", "  We investigate the full-counting statistics (FCS) of energy flow carried by\nelectrons in the transient regime. Based on two measurement scheme we formulate\na non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function theory to compute the generating\nfunction for FCS of energy transport. Specifically, we express the generating\nfunction using the path integral along Keldysh contour and obtain exact\nsolution of the generating function using the Grassmann algebra. With this\nformalism, we calculate the transient energy current and higher order cumulants\nfor both single and double quantum dot (QD) systems in the transient regime. To\nexamine finite bandwidth effect of leads to FCS of energy transport, we have\nused an exact solvable model with a Lorentizian linewidth where all\nnon-equilibrium Green's functions can be solved exactly in the time domain. It\nis found that the transient energy current exhibits damped oscillatory\nbehavior. For the single quantum dot system the frequency of oscillation is\nindependent of bandwidth of the leads while the decay rate of the oscillation\namplitude is determined by the lifetime of resonant state which increases as\nthe bandwidth decreases. At short times, a universal scaling of maximum\namplitude of normalized cumulants is identified for the single QD system. For\nthe double QD system, the damped oscillation of energy current is dominated by\nRabi oscillation with frequency approximately proportional to the coupling\nconstant between two quantum dots. In general, the transient energy current\nincreases when the coupling between two QDs is stronger. However, when the\ninterdot coupling is larger than half of the external bias the transient energy\ncurrent is suppressed significantly. All these results can be understood\nanalytically.\n", "  We monitored BL Lacertae simultaneously in the optical B, V, R and I bands\nfor 13 nights during the period 2012-2016. The variations were well correlated\nin all bands and the source showed significant intraday variability (IDV). We\nalso studied its optical flux and colour behaviour, and searched for inter-band\ntime lags. A strong bluer-when-brighter chromatism was found on the intra-night\ntime-scale. The spectral changes are not sensitive to the host galaxy\ncontribution. Cross-correlation analysis revealed possible time delay of about\n10 min between variations in the V and R bands. We interpreted the observed\nflares in terms of the model consisting of individual synchrotron pulses.\n", "  We calculate the geometric luminosity loss caused by filamentation of\ntransverse kicks, upright and skew quadrupolar errors due to discharges,\nso-called RF-breakdown, in the acceleration structures of a Linear Collider.\n", "  Causality implies that by measuring an absorption spectrum, the\ntime-dependent linear response function can be retrieved. Recent experiments\nsuggest a link between the shape of spectral lines observed in absorption\nspectroscopy with the amplitude and phase of the systems response function.\nThis has even been observed in the presence of strong, nonlinear interactions,\nwhich promote the observed system out of equilibrium, making it explicitly time\ndependent. Thus far, however, only the special case of a sudden modification of\nthe response function was understood analytically, leaving the general case of\nthe dynamical response to arbitrary interactions open to interpretation. Here,\nwe demonstrate that even for the case of a strongly driven, time-dependent\nsystem, one can reconstruct the full temporal response information from a\nsingle spectrum if a sufficiently short signal is used to trigger the\nabsorption process. This finding is directly applied to a time-domain\nobservation of Rabi cycling between doubly-excited atomic states in the\nfew-femtosecond regime. This general approach unlocks single-shot\nreal-time-resolved signal reconstruction across time scales down to attoseconds\nfor non-equilibrium states of matter. In contrast to available pump-probe\nschemes, there is no need for scanning time delays in order to access real-time\ninformation. The scientific applications of this technique range from testing\nfundamental quantum dynamics, to measuring and controlling ultrafast, chemical\nand biological reaction processes.\n", "  We have investigated the Regge trajectories of exotic hadrons by considering\ndifferent possible pentaquark configurations with finite quark mass in the flux\ntube model. Signifi- cant deviation is observed in the linear behavior of the\nRegge trajectories for pentaquark systems in view of the universal value of the\nRegge slope parameter for hadrons. The modified Regge trajectories are also\ncompared with the available experimental and lat- tice data. It is observed\nthat the non-linear Regge trajectories of such pentaqurk systems can be well\ndescribed by the relativistic corrections in view of the current quark masses\nand the high rotational speed of the quarks at the end of flux tube structure.\n", "  The Grad method is generalized based on the Bogolyubov idea of the functional\nhypothesis for states at the end of relaxation processes in a system. The Grad\nproblem (i.e., description of the Maxwell relaxation) for a completely ionized\nspatially uniform two-component electron-ion plasma is investigated using the\nLandau kinetic equation. The component distribution functions and time\nevolution equations for parameters describing the state of a system are\ncalculated, and corrections are obtained to the known results in a perturbation\ntheory in a small electron-to-ion mass ratio.\n", "  Direct simulation results for stationary gas transport through pure silica\nzeolite membranes (MFI, LTA and DDR types) are presented using a hybrid,\nnon-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation methodology introduced recently.\nThe intermolecular potential models for the investigated CH$_{4}$ and H$_{2}$\ngases were taken from literature. For different zeolites, the same atomic (Si\nand O) interaction parameters were used, and the membranes were constructed\naccording to their real (MFI, LTA, or DDR) crystal structures. A realistic\nnature of the applied potential parameters was tested by performing equilibrium\nadsorption simulations and by comparing the calculated results with the data of\nexperimental adsorption isotherms. The results of transport simulations carried\nout at 25$^0$C and 125$^0$C, and at 2.5, 5 or 10 bar clearly show that the\npermeation selectivities of CH$_{4}$ are higher than the corresponding\npermeability ratios of pure components, and significantly differ from the\nequilibrium selectivities in mixture adsorptions. We experienced a transport\nselectivity in favor of CH$_{4}$ in only one case. A large discrepancy between\ndifferent types of selectivity data can be attributed to dissimilar mobilities\nof the components in a membrane, their dependence on the loading of a membrane,\nand the unlike adsorption preferences of the gas molecules.\n", "  The properties of model solutions consisting of a solute --- single curcumin\nmolecule in water, methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide solvents have been studied\nusing molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations in the isobaric-isothermal\nensemble. The united atom OPLS force field (OPLS-UA) model for curcumin\nmolecule proposed by us recently [J. Mol. Liq., 2016, 223, 707] in combination\nwith the SPC/E water, and the OPLS-UA type models for methanol and dimethyl\nsulfoxide have been applied. We have described changes of the internal\nstructure of the solute molecule induced by different solvent media in very\ndetail. The pair distribution functions between particular fragments of a\nsolute molecule with solvent particles have been analyzed. Statistical features\nof the hydrogen bonding between different species were explored. Finally, we\nhave obtained a self-diffusion coefficient of curcumin molecules in three model\nsolvents.\n", "  We propose to use optical antennas made out of natural hyperbolic material\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and we demonstrate that this medium is a\npromising alternative to plasmonic and all-dielectric materials for realizing\nefficient subwavelength scatterers and metasurfaces based on them. We\ntheoretically show that particles out of hyperbolic medium possess different\nresonances enabled by the support of high-k waves and their reflection from the\nparticle boundaries. Among those resonances, there are electric quadrupole\nexcitations, which cause magnetic resonance of the particle similar to what\noccurs in high-refractive-index particles. Excitations of the particle\nresonances are accompanied by the drop in the reflection from nanoparticle\narray to near-zero value, which can be ascribed to resonant Kerker effect. If\nparticles are arranged in the spacer array with period d, narrow lattice\nresonances are possible at wavelength d, d/2, d/3 etc. This provides an\nadditional degree of control and possibility to excite resonances at the\nwavelength defined by the array spacing. For the hBN particle with hyperbolic\ndispersion, we show that the full range of the resonances, including magnetic\nresonance and a decrease of reflection, is possible.\n", "  Solar disinfection by photocatalysis is one of the promising methods used for\ndrinking water disinfection. It leads to the destruction of bacteria like\n$Escherichia$ $Coli$ ($E.$ $Coli$). In this paper, we compare our theoretical\nresults with experimental ones done previously by A.G. Rinc\\'on and his\ncolleagues concerning the order of decay of C$_{6}$H$_{4}$(OH)$_{2}$ isomers in\nthe presence of titanium dioxide TiO$_{2}$, and show the influence of optical\nproperties of those molecules on $E.$ $Coli$ inactivation. According to the\nadsorption energy parameter, we find that catechol has the highest adsorption\ndegree on titanium dioxide, followed by resorcinol, and finally hydroquinone.\nThree dihydroxybenzene isomers absorb photons belonging to ultraviolet (UV)\nrange. The lowest absorption energies of resorcinol, catechol and hydroquinone\nare respectively 3.42, 4.44 and 4.49 eV.\n", "  While phase response theory for limit cycle oscillators is a well established\ntool for the study of synchronization with predictive powers beyond simple\nlinear response, an analogous, unified approach for the study of phase\nsynchronization for autonomous chaotic oscillators has not been developed so\nfar. The main source of ambiguity for such an approach is chaotic phase\ndiffusion and the absence of a unique, geometrically meaningful phase. Here we\npresent a new approach to phase response theory for autonomous, structurally\nstable chaotic oscillators based on Lyapunov vectors and shadowing\ntrajectories. We also present an averaging technique for the slow dynamics of a\nsuitably defined geometric phase difference between a chaotic oscillator and a\ndriving force which can be used to estimate a phase coupling function in\nexperiments. Our work opens the door for systematic studies of synchronization\ncontrol of chaotic oscillations across scientific disciplines.\n", "  Closed Ring accelerating Structure (CRS) externally has a set of very\nattractive properties, both in RF parameters and in technological aspects. The\nstructure was proposed for application in compact linear accelerators of\nelectrons. Procedure of tuning and structure manufacturing was developed. The\nstructure is now proposed for protons acceleration in medium energy range.\\\\\nFor this structure very unusual dispersion properties were declared. It\nsimulates an additional consideration, to understand problem, and additional\nanalysis was performed.\\\\ Results of analysis indicate particularities of the\nstructure, generating strong hesitations for CRS.\n", "  In this paper it is shown that the enhancement factor of the local electric\nfield in metal covered ellipsoidal nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric host\nmatrix has two maxima at two different frequencies. The second maximum for the\nmetal covered inclusions with large dielectric core (small metal fraction $p$)\nis comparatively large. This maximum strongly depends on the depolarization\nfactor of the core $L_{z}^{(1)}$, keeping that of the shell $L_{z}^{(2)}$\nconstant and is less than $L_{z}^{(1)}$. If the frequency of the external\nradiation approaches the frequency of surface plasmons of a metal, the local\nfield in the particle considerably increases. The importance of maximum value\nof enhancement factor $|A|^{2}$ of the ellipsoidal inclusion is emphasized in\nthe case where the dielectric core exceeds metal fraction of the inclusion. The\nresults of numerical computations for typical small silver particles are\npresented graphically.\n", "  Ground state properties, dispersion relations and scaling behaviour of spin\ngap of a bond alternating spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain have\nbeen studied where the exchange interactions on alternate bonds are\nferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) in two separate cases. The\nresulting models separately represent nearest neighbour (NN) AFM-AFM and AFM-FM\nbond alternating chains. Ground state energy has been estimated analytically by\nusing both bond operator and Jordan-Wigner representations and numerically by\nusing exact diagonalization. Dispersion relations, spin gap and several ground\nstate orders have been obtained. Dimer order and string orders are found to\ncoexist in the ground state. Spin gap is found to develop as soon as the\nnon-uniformity in alternating bond strength is introduced in the AFM-AFM chain\nwhich further remains non-zero for the AFM-FM chain. This spin gap along with\nthe string orders attribute to the Haldane phase. The Haldane phase is found to\nexist in most of the anisotropic region similar to the isotropic point.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the spin injection from a ferromagnetic silicene\nto a normal silicene (FS/NS), where the magnetization in the FS is assumed from\nthe magnetic proximity effect. Based on a silicene lattice model, we\ndemonstrated that the pure spin injection could be obtained by tuning the Fermi\nenergy of two spin species, where one is in the spin orbit coupling gap and the\nother one is outside the gap. Moreover, the valley polarity of the spin species\ncan be controlled by a perpendicular electric field in the FS region. Our\nfindings may shed light on making silicene-based spin and valley devices in the\nspintronics and valleytronics field.\n", "  There are growing efforts in constructing topological edge states in\nclassical wave system. However, most of the work study the existence, creation\nand properties of the edge states, and the demonstration of application is\nhighly desirable. Here, we present our design of a two-dimensional anisotropic\nphononic crystal that exhibits tunable topological phases. We further explore\nthe contribution of anisotropy and show that the bandgap topology is also\nrelated to particular directions and frequency. Such frequency dependent\nbehavior can be utilized as a frequency filter.\n", "  We study the clustering of inertial particles using a periodic kinematic\nsimulation. Particles clustering is observed for different pairs of Stokes\nnumber and Froude number and different spectral power laws ($1.4 \\leqslant p\n\\leqslant 2.1$). The main focus is to identify and then quantify the effect of\n$p$ on the clustering attractor - by attractor we mean the set of points in the\nphysical space where the particles settle when time tends to infinity. It is\nobserved that spectral power laws can have a dramatic effect on the attractor\nshape. In particular, we observed a new attractor type which was not present in\nprevious studies for Kolmogorov spectra ($p=5/3$).\n", "  A theoretical investigation of the effects of spatial variation of confining\nelectric potential on photoionization cross section (PCS) in a spherical\nquantum dot is presented. The potential profiles considered here are the\nshifted parabolic potential and the inverse lateral shifted parabolic potential\ncompared with the well-studied parabolic potential. The primary findings are\nthat parabolic potential and the inverse lateral shifted parabolic potential\nblue shift the peaks of the PCS while the shifted parabolic potential causes a\nred shift.\n", "  We considered intersubband electron transitions in an array of\none-dimensional chains of spherical quantum dots in the\nGaAs/Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As semiconductor system. The absorption coefficient\ncaused by these transitions was calculated depending on frequency and\npolarization of incident light and on Fermi level position, and temperature. We\nestablished the existence of two maxima of the absorption coefficient at the\nedges of the absorption band. It is shown that the absorption coefficient\nreaches its maximal value at the center of the region between the $s$-,\n$p$-like subbands and slightly varies with temperature. The change of the\ndirection of the linearly polarized light wave incident on the chains from\nperpendicular to parallel leads to a sharp narrowing of the absorption band. It\nis obtained that the absorption bandwidth increases with the reduction of the\nquantum dot radius. We also analyzed the dependence of the absorption\ncoefficient of GaAs/Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As superlattice on concentration of\naluminium in the matrix.\n", "  Using a left multiplication defined on a right quaternionic Hilbert space, we\nshall demonstrate that various classes of coherent states such as the canonical\ncoherent states, pure squeezed states, fermionic coherent states can be defined\nwith all the desired properties on a right quaternionic Hilbert space. Further,\nwe shall also demonstrate squeezed states can be defined on the same Hilbert\nspace, but the noncommutativity of quaternions prevents us in getting the\ndesired results.\n", "  The structural stability, electronic properties and NH$_3$ adsorption\nproperties of pristine, Ti, Zr and F substituted $\\alpha$-MoO$_3$\nnanostructures are successfully studied using density functional theory with\nB3LYP/LanL2DZ basis set. The structural stability of $\\alpha$-MoO$_3$\nnanostructures is discussed in terms of formation energy. The electronic\nproperties of pristine, Ti, Zr and F incorporated $\\alpha$-MoO$_3$\nnanostructures are discussed in terms of HOMO-LUMO gap, ionization potential\nand electron affinity. $\\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanostructures can be fine-tuned with\nsuitable substitution impurity to improve the adsorption characteristics of\nammonia, which can be used to detect NH$_3$ in a mixed environment. The present\nwork gives an insight into tailoring $\\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanostructures for NH$_3$\ndetection.\n", "  High-energy-density electron-positron pair plasma production and its dynamics\nin a thin foil illuminated by two counter-propagating laser pulses are\ninvestigated through multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We compare\nthe production of electron-positron pairs and gamma-photons via quantum\nelectrodynamics processes in the relativistic transparent and opaque regimes,\nand find that the target transparency can significantly enhance the\nelectron-positron pair production due to the formation of stable standing wave\n(SW). An optimum foil density of 200 - 280 n_c (n_c is the laser critical\ndensity) is found for enhancing electron-positron pair production when laser\nintensity reaches a few 10e23 W/cm2. At such foil density, laser energy\nconversion to electron-positron pairs is approximately four times higher than\nat foil density of 710n_c, whereas laser energy conversion to gamma-photons\nkeeps almost the same. Consequently, high dense electron-positron plasma with a\nmaximum intensity above 10e20 W/cm2 is produced. Modulation dynamics of created\npair plasmas is further observed when target foil becomes transparent. It is\nshown that stable SWs formed directly by two counter-propagating lasers, not\nonly trap the created electron-positron pairs to their nodes, but also modulate\nperiodically average energy and phase-space and angular distributions of\ntrapped particles. However, similar trapping and modulation effects become\nobscure in the opaque regime due to the absence of stable SW field.\n", "  Wavefront stabilization is a fundamental challenge to high contrast imaging\nof exoplanets. For both space and ground observations, wavefront control\nperformance is ultimately limited by the finite amount of starlight available\nfor sensing, so wavefront measurements must be as efficient as possible. To\nmeet this challenge, we propose to sense residual errors using bright\nfocal-plane speckles at wavelengths outside the high contrast spectral\nbandwidth. We show that a linear relationship exists between the intensity of\nthe bright out-of-band speckles and residual wavefront aberrations. An\nefficient linear control loop can exploit this relationship. The proposed\nscheme, referred to as Spectral Linear Dark Field Control (spectral LDFC), is\nmore sensitive than conventional approaches for ultra-high contrast imaging.\nSpectral LDFC is closely related to, and can be combined with, the recently\nproposed spatial LDFC which uses light at the observation wavelength but\nlocated outside of the high contrast area in the focal plane image. Both LDFC\ntechniques do not require starlight to be mixed with the high contrast speckle\nfield, so full-sensitivity uninterrupted high contrast observations can be\nconducted simultaneously with wavefront correction iterations. We also show\nthat LDFC is robust against deformable mirror calibration errors and drifts, as\nit relies on detector response stability instead of deformable mirror\nstability. LDFC is particularly advantageous when science acquisition is\nperformed at a non-optimal wavefront sensing wavelength, such as nearIR\nobservations of planets around solar-type stars, for which visible-light\nspeckle sensing is ideal. We describe the approach at a fundamental level and\nprovide an algorithm for its implementation. We demonstrate, through numerical\nsimulation, that spectral LDFC is well-suited for picometer-level cophasing of\na large segmented space telescope.\n", "  Understanding the generation and distribution of the Sun's interior magnetic\n(B-) field is a longstanding challenge. Here we describe how measurements of\nthe Sun's oscillation eigenfunctions might be used to measure the Sun's\ninterior B-field. The B-field induces mode-mode couplings, causing the angular\npatterns of the eigenfunctions to differ from simple Y_{lm}'s We concentrate on\nthe magnetic coupling between modes with the same (n,l) values and different\nbut nearby $m$-values, since these non-axisymmetric couplings clearly cannot be\ndue to the Sun's axisymmetric rotation and since for these cases, mode mixing\nis enhanced by the near-degeneracy of the mode frequencies. We analyze\nmagnetically-induced mode mixing in two stages of increasing complexity: first\nneglecting mode damping, and then incorporating realistic damping rates. We\nintroduce a novel detection statistic that tests for the presence of\nnon-axisymmetric mode-mixing in Solar Doppler data. We show that our detection\nstatistic is naturally robust against spatial aliasing. We estimate our\nstatistic's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the mode-mixing\namplitude. While B-induced mode-mixing is probably not detectable in a single\nmode pair, we argue that the phase of the B-induced mixing should be\napproximately the same across a wide range of modes. The total SNR then grows\nroughly as Np^{1/2}, where Np is the number of mode pairs. We conclude that\nB-induced mode-mixing should be detectable for a fairly wide range of B-field\nmagnitudes and geometries.\n", "  In this paper we present a thorough analysis of the nature of news in\ndifferent mediums across the ages, introducing a unique mathematical model to\nfit the characteristics of information spread. This model enhances the\ninformation diffusion model to account for conflicting information and the\ntopical distribution of news in terms of popularity for a given era. We\ntranslate this information to a separate graphical node model to determine the\nspread of a news item given a certain category and relevance factor. The two\nmodels are used as a base for a simulation of information dissemination for\nvarying graph topoligies. The simulation is stress-tested and compared against\nreal-world data to prove its relevancy. We are then able to use these\nsimulations to deduce some conclusive statements about the optimization of\ninformation spread.\n", "  We consider a parametrically forced Bose-Einstein condensate in the combined\npresence of an optical lattice and harmonic oscillator potential in the mean\nfield approach. A spatial symmetry broken Bose-condensed phase in non-inertial\nand inertial frame yields a stripe phase in the presence of both cubic and\nquintic nonlinearities. We show that existence of such stripe phase solely\ndepends on the interplay between the quintic nonlinearity and lattice\npotential. Furthermore, we observe that a time-dependent harmonic oscillator\nfrequency destroys such stripe ordering. A linear stability analysis of the\nobtained solution is performed and we found that the solution is stable. In\norder to gain a better understanding of the underlying physics, we compute the\nenergy, showing nonlinear compression of the condensate in some parameter\ndomain.\n"]}
