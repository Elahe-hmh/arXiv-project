"abstract": ["  We discuss the differences and analogies of gravitational clustering in\nfinite and infinite systems. The process of collective, or violent, relaxation\nleading to the formation of quasi-stationary states is one of the distinguished\nfeatures in the dynamics of self-gravitating systems. This occurs, in different\nconditions, both in a finite than in an infinite system, the latter embedded in\na static or in an expanding background. We then discuss, by considering some\nsimple and paradigmatic examples, the problems related to the definition of a\nmean-field approach to gravitational clustering, focusing on role of discrete\nfluctuations. The effect of these fluctuations is a basic issue to be clarified\nto establish the range of scales and times in which a collision-less\napproximation may describe the evolution of a self-gravitating system and for\nthe theoretical modeling of the non-linear phase.\n", "  This paper computes co-rotating and contra-rotating impact-parameter formulas\nin the plane of symmetry for any plane symmetric and axisymmetric rotating body\nin all metric theories of gravity, including general relativity.\nImpact-parameter formulas are useful to compute the appearance of accreting\nblack holes, neutron stars, and other emitting or reflecting matter near a\ngravitationally compact rotating body. These rotating-body impact-parameter\nformulas generalize similar impact-parameter formulas for the Kerr case derived\nby Bardeen and coworkers in 1972, and another general-metric formula for the\nspherical case published by Bodenner and Will in 2003.\n", "  We systematically surveyed period variations of superhumps in SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae based on newly obtained data and past publications. In many\nsystems, the evolution of superhump period are found to be composed of three\ndistinct stages: early evolutionary stage with a longer superhump period,\nmiddle stage with systematically varying periods, final stage with a shorter,\nstable superhump period. During the middle stage, many systems with superhump\nperiods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to the\nearlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives\nbetween superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that the\nlengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of the\neccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation. We\ninterpret that late stage superhumps are rejuvenized excitation of 3:1\nresonance when the superhumps in the outer disk is effectively quenched. Many\nof WZ Sge-type dwarf novae showed long-enduring superhumps during the\npost-superoutburst stage having periods longer than those during the main\nsuperoutburst. The period derivatives in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are found to\nbe strongly correlated with the fractional superhump excess, or consequently,\nmass ratio. WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with a long-lasting rebrightening or with\nmultiple rebrightenings tend to have smaller period derivatives and are\nexcellent candidate for the systems around or after the period minimum of\nevolution of cataclysmic variables (abridged).\n", "  In order to apply thermodynamics to systems in which entropy is not\nextensive, it has become customary to define generalized entropies. While this\napproach has been effective, it is not the only possible approach. We suggest\nthat some systems, including nanosystems, can be investigated by instead\ngeneralizing the concept of extensivity. We begin by reexamining the role of\nlinearity in the definition of complex physical systems. We show that there is\na generalized form of extensivity that can be defined for a number of\nnon-linear systems. We further show that a generalization of the principle of\nlinear superposition is the basis for defining generalized extensivity. We\nintroduce a definition for the the degree of non-extensivity for systems. We\nshow that generalized extensivity can be used as a means of understanding\ncomplex physical systems and we propose extending the idea extensivity beyond\nthermodynamics to other physical systems, including nanosystems.\n", "  We present a Bell-type inequality for four-qubit systems. Using the\ninequality we investigate quantum nonlocality of a generic family of states\n$\\left|G_{abcd}\\right >$ [Phys. Rev. A 65, 052112 (2002)] and several canonical\nfour-qubit entangled states. It has been demonstrated that the inequality is\nmaximally violated by so called \"four-qubit maximal entangled state\n$\\left|G_{m}\\right >$\" and it is also violated by the four-qubit W state and a\nspecial family of states $\\left|G_{ab00}\\right >$. Moreover, a useful\nentanglement-nonlocality relationship for the family of states\n$\\left|G_{ab00}\\right >$ is obtained.\n", "  Quantum ensemble classification has significant applications in\ndiscrimination of atoms (or molecules), separation of isotopic molecules and\nquantum information extraction. However, quantum mechanics forbids\ndeterministic discrimination among nonorthogonal states. The classification of\ninhomogeneous quantum ensembles is very challenging since there exist\nvariations in the parameters characterizing the members within different\nclasses. In this paper, we recast quantum ensemble classification as a\nsupervised quantum learning problem. A systematic classification methodology is\npresented by using a sampling-based learning control (SLC) approach for quantum\ndiscrimination. The classification task is accomplished via simultaneously\nsteering members belonging to different classes to their corresponding target\nstates (e.g., mutually orthogonal states). Firstly a new discrimination method\nis proposed for two similar quantum systems. Then an SLC method is presented\nfor quantum ensemble classification. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach for the binary classification of\ntwo-level quantum ensembles and the multiclass classification of multilevel\nquantum ensembles.\n", "  Based on observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board\nHinode, the existence of a broad distribution of blue and red Dopplershift in\nactive region loops has been revealed; the distribution of Dopplershifts\ndepends on the peak temperature of formation of the observed spectral lines. To\nreproduce those observations, we use a nanoflare heating model for\nmulti-stranded coronal loops (Sarkar and Walsh 2008, 2009) and a set of\nspectral lines covering a broad range of temperature (from 0.25 MK to 5.6 MK).\nWe first show that red- and blueshifts are ubiquitous in all wavelength ranges;\nredshifts/downflows dominating cool spectral lines (from O V to Si VII) and\nblueshifts/upflows dominating the hot lines (from Fe XV to Ca XVII). These\nDopplershifts are indicative of plasma condensation and evaporation. By\ncomputing the average Dopplershift, we derive a new temperature diagnostic for\ncoronal loops: the temperature at which the average Dopplershift vanishes\nestimates the mean temperature of the plasma along the coronal loop and at the\nfootpoints. To compare closely with observations, we model dense and sparse\nHinode/EIS rasters at the instrument resolution. The temperature diagnostic\nprovides the same temperature estimates as the model whatever the type of\nraster or the viewing angle. To conclude, we have developed a robust\ntemperature diagnostic to measure the plasma temperature of a coronal loop\nusing a broad range of spectral lines.\n", "  Density functional theory calculations have been performed on Indium\nnanoclusters (Inn, n= 3 to 10) to explore the relative stability among their\ndifferent isomers and interaction with H2. Geometry optimizations starting from\ninitial candidate geometries were performed for each cluster size, so as to\ndetermine a few low energy isomers for each size. Clusters with planar\nconfiguration and high symmetry are found to be more stable. For n=8 there\ncomes transition from 2D to 3D structures, which formed by stacking of planar\nrings are most stable. Energetically favorable isomers of indium nanoclusters\nfor each size were considered to get H2 adsorbed. In general H2 interaction\nwith these clusters is week but with odd index i.e. 5, 7 and 9 is significant.\nIndium nanotube also indicates H2 adsorption but Eads increases many folds on\nintroduction of defect in the tube. On basis of these DFT studies we propose\nindium nanotubes and clusters of particular size appear to be good candidate\nfor hydrogen storage materials.\n", "  The propagation of TeV gamma rays can be strongly modified by B-field induced\nconversion to axionlike particles (ALPs). We show that, at such high energies,\nphoton dispersion is dominated by background photons - the only example where\nphoton-photon dispersion is of practical relevance. We determine the refractive\nindex for all energies and find that, for fixed energy density, background\nphotons below the pair-production threshold dominate. The cosmic microwave\nbackground alone provides an \"effective photon mass\" of (m_gamma)^2 = -(1.01\nneV * E/TeV)^2 for E < 1000 TeV. The extragalactic background light is\nsubdominant, but local radiation fields in the galaxy or the source regions\nprovide significant contributions. Photon-photon dispersion is small enough to\nleave typical scenarios of photon-ALP oscillations unscathed, but big enough to\nworry about it case by case.\n", "  In this paper, the effects of changes in Sol concentration on the structural\nand optical properties of SnO2 Nanoparticles are studied through the Sol-Gel\nmethod. SnO2 Nanoparticles are produced from different SnO2 solution\nconcentrations (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mol/L) at room temperature. X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is used to investigate\nthe effects of changes in Sol concentration on the crystalline and surface\nmorphology of Nanoparticles. The XRD pattern shows that the particles are in\nthe standard tetragonal phase of SnO2. The crystallites size are 11.7nm,\n18.8nm, and 74.8nm, for 0.1 M, 0.3M and 0.5 M of concentration respectively.\nThe average size of SnO2 particles decreases by a reduction in the Sol\nconcentration. The band gap value is 4.07ev, 4.28ev and 4.36ev for 0.1M, 0.3M\nand 0.5M of concentration respectively. The UV-visible analysis shows that\ndecreasing the Sol concentration will cause the absorption edge shift to the\nshorter wavelengths, because decreasing the Sol concentration will reduce the\nNanoparticles size, and smaller Nanoparticles size absorb shorter wavelengths\nbetter and also increase the band gap.\n", "  Within the context of the Brownian ratchet model, a molecular rotary system\nwas studied that can perform unidirectional rotations induced by linearly\npolarized ac fields, and produce positive work under loads. The model is based\non the Langevin equation for a particle in a two-dimensional (2D) three-tooth\nratchet potential of threefold symmetry. The performance of the system is\ncharacterized by the coercive torque, i.e., the strength of the load competing\nwith the torque induced by the ac driving field, and the energy efficiency in\nforce conversion from the driving field to torque. We propose a master equation\nfor coarse-grained states, which takes into account boundary motion between\nstates, and develop a kinetic description to estimate mean angular momentum\n(MAM) and powers relevant to the energy balance equation. The framework of\nanalysis incorporates several 2D characteristics, and is applicable to a wide\nclass of models of smooth 2D ratchet potential. We confirm that the obtained\nexpressions for MAM, power, and efficiency of the model can predict qualitative\nbehaviors. We also discuss the usefulness of the torque/power relationship for\nexperimental analyses, and propose a characteristic for 2D ratchet systems.\n", "  We define, as local quantities, the least energy and momentum allowed by\nquantum mechanics and special relativity for physical realizations of some\nclassical lattice dynamics. These definitions depend on local rates of\nfinite-state change. In two example dynamics, we see that these rates evolve\nlike classical mechanical energy and momentum.\n", "  We explore the astrobiological significance of F-type stars of spectral type\nbetween F5 V and F9.5 V, which possess Jupiter-type planets within or close to\ntheir climatological habitable zones. These planets, or at least a subset of\nthose, may also possess rocky exomoons, which potentially offer habitable\nenvironments. Our work considers eight selected systems. The Jupiter-type\nplanets in these systems are in notably differing orbits with eccentricities\nbetween 0.08 (about Mars) and 0.72. We consider the stellar UV environments\nprovided by the photospheric stellar radiation, which allows us to compute the\nUV habitable zones for the systems. Following previous studies, DNA is taken as\na proxy for carbon-based macromolecules following the paradigm that\nextraterrestrial biology might be based on hydrocarbons. We found that the\ndamage inflicted on DNA is notably different for the range of systems studied,\nand also varies according to the orbit of the Jupiter-type planet, especially\nfor systems of high ellipticity, as expected. For some systems excessive values\nof damage are attained compared to today's Earth or during the Archean eon.\nConsidering that the detection of exomoons around different types of stars will\nremain challenging in the foreseeable future, we view our work also as an\nexample and template for investigating the combined requirements of\nclimatological and UV-based habitability for exosolar objects.\n", "  Algorithmic approach to the problem of linearization by point transformation\nof ordinary differential equation of arbitrary order is presented.\nTest-linearization is purely algorithmic.\n", "  We show that key results of supersymmetry can be achieved via conformal\nsymmetry. We propose that the Higgs boson be a dynamical bound state rather\nthan an elementary scalar, so that there is no quadratic divergence self-energy\nproblem for it and no need to invoke supersymmetry to resolve it. We study a\nconformal invariant theory of interacting fermions and gauge bosons, in which\nthere is scaling with anomalous dimensions and dynamical symmetry breaking,\nwith the dynamical dimension of $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ being reduced from 3 to 2.\nWith this reduction we augment the theory with a then renormalizable 4-fermion\ninteraction with dynamical dimension equal to 4. We reinterpret the theory as a\nrenormalizable version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, with the gauge\ntheory sector with its now massive fermion being the mean field and the\n4-fermion interaction being the residual interaction. It is this residual\ninteraction that generates dynamical Goldstone and Higgs states, states that,\nas noted by Baker and Johnson, the gauge theory sector itself does not possess.\nThe Higgs boson is found to be a narrow resonance just above threshold. We\ncouple the theory to conformal gravity, with the interplay between conformal\ngravity and the 4-fermion interaction taking care of the vacuum energy problem.\nWith conformal gravity being a consistent quantum gravity theory there is no\nneed for string theory with its supersymmetric underpinnings. With conformal\ngravity fits to galactic rotation curves and the accelerating universe not\nneeding dark matter, there is no need to introduce supersymmetry for either the\nvacuum energy problem or to provide a potential dark matter candidate. We\npropose that it is conformal symmetry rather than supersymmetry that is\nfundamental, with the theory of nature being a locally conformal, locally gauge\ninvariant, non-Abelian NJL theory.\n", "  The U(1) BF Quantum Field Theory is revisited in the light of\nDeligne-Beilinson Cohomology. We show how the U(1) Chern-Simons partition\nfunction is related to the BF one and how the latter on its turn coincides with\nan abelian Turaev-Viro invariant. Significant differences compared to the\nnon-abelian case are highlighted.\n", "  It is argued that the classical local inertial frame used to define\nrotational states of quantum systems is only approximate, and that geometry\nitself must also be rotationally quantized at the Planck scale. A Lorentz\ninvariant statistical model of correlations in quantum geometry on larger\nscales predicts spacelike correlations that describe rotational fluctuations in\nthe inertial frame. Fluctuations are estimated to significantly affect the\ngravity of quantum field states on a macroscopic scale, characterized by the\nChandrasekhar radius. It is suggested that the cosmological constant might be a\nsignature of exotic rotational correlations entangled with the strong\ninteraction vacuum, and have a value determined entirely by Planck scale\nquantum gravity and Standard Model fields.\n", "  It is well known that the bulk physics of a topological phase constrains its\npossible edge physics through the bulk-edge correspondence. Therefore, the\ndifferent types of edge theories that a topological phase can host constitute a\nuniversal piece of data which can be used to characterize topological order. In\nthis paper, we argue that, beginning from only the fixed-point wave function\n(FPW) of a nonchiral topological phase and by locally deforming it, all\npossible edge theories can be extracted from its entanglement Hamiltonian (EH).\nWe give a general argument, and concretely illustrate our claim by deforming\nthe FPW of the Wen-plaquette model, the quantum double of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. In\nthat case, we show that the possible EHs of the deformed FPW reflect the known\npossible types of edge theories, which are generically gapped, but gapless if\ntranslational symmetry is preserved. We stress that our results do not require\nan underlying Hamiltonian--thus, this lends support to the notion that a\ntopological phase is indeed characterized by only a set of quantum states and\ncan be studied through its FPWs.\n", "  The observational era of gravitational-wave astronomy began in the Fall of\n2015 with the detection of GW150914. One potential type of detectable\ngravitational wave is short-duration gravitational-wave bursts, whose waveforms\ncan be difficult to predict. We present the framework for a new detection\nalgorithm for such burst events -- \\textit{oLIB} -- that can be used in\nlow-latency to identify gravitational-wave transients independently of other\nsearch algorithms. This algorithm consists of 1) an excess-power event\ngenerator based on the Q-transform -- \\textit{Omicron} --, 2) coincidence of\nthese events across a detector network, and 3) an analysis of the coincident\nevents using a Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian evidence calculator --\n\\textit{LALInferenceBurst}. These steps compress the full data streams into a\nset of Bayes factors for each event; through this process, we use elements from\ninformation theory to minimize the amount of information regarding the\nsignal-versus-noise hypothesis that is lost. We optimally extract this\ninformation using a likelihood-ratio test to estimate a detection significance\nfor each event. Using representative archival LIGO data, we show that the\nalgorithm can detect gravitational-wave burst events of astrophysical strength\nin realistic instrumental noise across different burst waveform morphologies.\nWe also demonstrate that the combination of Bayes factors by means of a\nlikelihood-ratio test can improve the detection efficiency of a\ngravitational-wave burst search. Finally, we show that oLIB's performance is\nrobust against the choice of gravitational-wave populations used to model the\nlikelihood-ratio test likelihoods.\n", "  By calculating entanglement measures and quantum violation of Bell-type\ninequality, we reveal the relationship between entanglement measure and the\namount of quantum violation for a family of four-qubit entangled states. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the Bell-type inequality is completely violated by these\nfour-qubit entangled states. The plot of entanglement measure as a function of\nthe expectation value of Bell operator shows that entanglement measure first\ndecreases and then increases smoothly with increasing quantum violation.\n", "  In this paper we consider the issue of massive gravity from a pure field\ntheoretical point of view, as the massive deformation of the gauge theory for a\nsymmetric rank-2 tensor field. We look for the most general massive theory with\nwell defined propagators, imposing the absence of unphysical poles (ghosts). We\nfind several possibilities, depending on the choice of the gauge fixing term.\n{Amongst these, two solutions with good massless limit are found.} The request\nof the absence of ghosts, alone, does not isolate the Fierz-Pauli case: several\nexamples of massive theories, which may include or not the Fierz-Pauli mass\nterm, are given. On the other hand, the Fierz-Pauli theory can be uniquely\nidentified by means of a symmetry: it turns out the the Fierz-Pauli massive\ngravity is the only element of the cohomology of a BRS operator.\n", "  Rapid state control of quantum systems is significant in reducing the\ninfluence of relaxation or decoherence caused by the environment and enhancing\nthe capability in dealing with uncertainties in the model and control process.\nBang-bang Lyapunov control can speed up the control process, but cannot\nguarantee convergence to a target state. This paper proposes two classes of new\nLyapunov control methods that can achieve rapidly convergent control for\nquantum states. One class is switching Lyapunov control where the control law\nis designed by switching between bang-bang Lyapunov control and standard\nLyapunov control. The other class is approximate bang-bang Lyapunov control\nwhere we propose two special control functions which are continuously\ndifferentiable and yet have a bang-bang type property. Related stability\nresults are given and a construction method for the degrees of freedom in the\nLyapunov function is presented to guarantee rapid convergence to a target\neigenstate being isolated in the invariant set. Several numerical examples\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve improved performance for\nrapid state control of quantum systems.\n", "  We present a general abstract framework for combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger\nequations, in which combinatorial identities are lifted to explicit bijections\nof sets, and more generally equivalences of groupoids. Key features of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations are revealed to follow from general\ncategorical constructions and universal properties. Rather than beginning with\nan equation inside a given Hopf algebra and referring to given Hochschild\n$1$-cocycles, our starting point is an abstract fixpoint equation in groupoids,\nshown canonically to generate all the algebraic structure. Precisely, for any\nfinitary polynomial endofunctor $P$ defined over groupoids, the system of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations $X=1+P(X)$ has a universal solution,\nnamely the groupoid of $P$-trees. The isoclasses of $P$-trees generate\nnaturally a Connes-Kreimer-like bialgebra, in which the abstract\nDyson-Schwinger equation can be internalised in terms of canonical\n$B_+$-operators. The solution to this equation is a series (the Green function)\nwhich always enjoys a Fa\\`a di Bruno formula, and hence generates a\nsub-bialgebra isomorphic to the Fa\\`a di Bruno bialgebra. Varying $P$ yields\ndifferent bialgebras, and cartesian natural transformations between various $P$\nyield bialgebra homomorphisms and sub-bialgebras, corresponding for example to\ntruncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Finally, all constructions can be\npushed inside the classical Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees by the\noperation of taking core of $P$-trees. A byproduct of the theory is an\ninterpretation of combinatorial Green functions as inductive data types in the\nsense of Martin-L\\\"of Type Theory (expounded elsewhere).\n", "  In this paper we present proof of principle experiments of an optical gating\nconcept for free electrons. We demonstrate a temporal resolution of 1.2+-0.3 fs\nvia energy and transverse momentum modulation as a function of time. The scheme\nis based on the synchronous interaction between electrons and the near-field\nmode of a dielectric nano-grating excited by a femtosecond laser pulse with an\noptical period duration of 6.5 fs. The sub-optical cycle resolution\ndemonstrated here is promising for use in laser-driven streak cameras for\nattosecond temporal characterization of bunched particle beams as well as\ntime-resolved experiments with free-electron beams. We expect that 10 as\ntemporal resolution will be achieved in the near future using such a scheme.\n", "  A common problem in lattice QCD simulations on the torus is the extremely\nlong autocorrelation time of the topological charge, when one approaches the\ncontinuum limit. The reason is the suppressed tunneling between topological\nsectors. The problem can be circumvented by replacing the torus with a\ndifferent manifold, so that the connectivity of the configuration space is\nchanged. This can be achieved by using open boundary conditions on the fields,\nas proposed earlier. It has the side effect of breaking translational\ninvariance strongly. Here we propose to use a non-orientable manifold, and show\nhow to define and simulate lattice QCD on it. We demonstrate in quenched\nsimulations that this leads to a drastic reduction of the autocorrelation time.\nA feature of the new proposal is, that translational invariance is preserved up\nto exponentially small corrections. A Dirac-fermion on a non-orientable\nmanifold poses a challenge to numerical simulations: the fermion determinant\nbecomes complex. We propose two approaches to circumvent this problem.\n", "  The master field is the large $N$ limit of the Yang-Mills measure on the\nEuclidean plane. It can be viewed as a non-commutative process indexed by paths\non the plane. We construct and study generalized master fields, called free\nplanar Markovian holonomy fields, which are versions of the master field where\nthe law of a simple loop can be as more general as it is possible. We prove\nthat those free planar Markovian holonomy fields can be seen as well as the\nlarge $N$ limit of some Markovian holonomy fields on the plane with unitary\nstructure group.\n", "  We have produced large and highly-reflective open-cell PVC extrusions for the\nNOvA neutrino oscillation experiment. The extrusions were sealed, instrumented,\nassembled into self-supporting detector blocks, and filled with liquid\nscintillator. Each Far Detector block stands 15.7 m high, is 15.7 m wide and\n2.1 m thick. More than 22,000 extrusions were produced with high dimensional\ntolerance and robust mechanical strength. This paper provides an overview of\nthe NOvA Far Detector, describes the preparation of the custom PVC powder, and\nthe making of the extrusions. Quality control was a key element in the\nproduction and is described in detail.\n", "  A d-orbital electron has an anisotropic electron orbital and is a source of\nmagnetism. The realization of a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) embedded at a\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface surprised researchers in materials and physical\nsciences because the 2DEG consists of 3d-electrons of Ti with extraordinarily\nlarge carrier mobility, even in the insulating oxide heterostructure. To date,\na wide variety of physical phenomena, such as ferromagnetism and the quantum\nHall effect, have been discovered in this 2DEG systems, demonstrating the\nability of the d-electron 2DEG systems to provide a material platform for the\nstudy of interesting physics. However, because of both ferromagnetism and the\nRashba field, long-range spin transport and the exploitation of spintronics\nfunctions have been believed difficult to implement in the d-electron 2DEG\nsystems. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of room-temperature\nspin transport in the d-electron-based 2DEG at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, where\nthe spin relaxation length is ca. exceeding 200 nm. Our finding, which counters\nthe conventional understandings to d-electron 2DEGs, opens a new field of\nd-electron spintronics. Furthermore, this work highlights a novel spin function\nin the conductive oxide system.\n", "  This paper outlines the common ground between the motivations lying behind\nHans Primas' algebraic approach to quantum phenomena and those lying behind\nDavid Bohm's approach which led to his notion of implicate/explicate order.\nThis connection has been made possible by the recent application of orthogonal\nClifford algebraic techniques to the de Broglie-Bohm approach for relativistic\nsystems with spin.\n", "  Beta eucryptite (LiAlSiO4) shows one-dimensional super-ionic conductivity as\nwell as anisotropic thermal expansion behavior. We have performed inelastic\nneutron scattering measurements in beta eucryptite over 300 to 900 K and\ncalculated the phonon spectrum using ab initio density functional theory\nmethod. The calculated energy profile for cooperative lithium ion displacements\nindicates preferential movement of Li ion along the hexagonal c-axis in the\nhigh temperature phase. However, the energy barrier for Li ion diffusion is\nsignificantly reduced when a Schottky defect is introduced in the crystal.\nFurther, the anisotropic stress dependence of the phonon spectrum is calculated\nto obtain the thermal expansion behavior along various axes. The calculations\nshow that the Gruneisen parameters of the low-energy phonon modes around 10 meV\nhave large negative values and govern the negative thermal expansion behavior\nboth along the a and c axes. On the other hand, anisotropic elasticity along\nwith anisotropic positive values of the Gruneisen parameters of the high-energy\nmodes in the range 30 to 70 meV are responsible for positive thermal expansion\nin the a-b plane and negative expansion along the c-axis. The analysis of the\npolarization vectors of the phonon modes sheds light on the mechanism of the\nanomalous thermal expansion behavior. We extend the study to discuss the\nrelationship of the soft phonons in the Brillouin zone with the observed\nhigh-pressure and high-temperature phase transitions as reported in the\nliterature.\n", "  Magnon-drag is shown to dominate the thermopower of elemental Fe from 2 to 80\nK and of elemental Co from 150 to 600 K; it is also shown to contribute to the\nthermopower of elemental Ni from 50 to 500 K. Two theoretical models are\npresented for magnon-drag thermopower. One is a hydrodynamic theory based\npurely on non-relativistic, Galilean, spin-preserving electron-magnon\nscattering. The second is based on spin-motive forces, where the thermopower\nresults from the electric current pumped by the dynamic magnetization\nassociated with a magnon heat flux. In spite of their very different\nmicroscopic origins, the two give similar predictions for pure metals at low\ntemperature, allowing us to semi-quantitatively explain the observed\nthermopower of elemental Fe and Co without adjustable parameters. We also find\nthat magnon-drag may contribute to the thermopower of Ni. A spin-mixing model\nis presented that describes the magnon-drag contribution to the Anomalous\nNernst Effect in Fe, again enabling a semi-quantitative match to the\nexperimental data without fitting parameters. Our work suggests that particle\nnon-conserving processes may play an important role in other types of drag\nphenomena, and also gives a predicative theory for improving metals as\nthermoelectric materials.\n", "  We present a self-contained review of the theory of dislocation-mediated\nquantum melting at zero temperature in two spatial dimensions. The theory\ndescribes the liquid-crystalline phases with spatial symmetries in between a\nquantum crystalline solid and an isotropic superfluid: quantum nematics and\nsmectics. It is based on an Abelian-Higgs-type duality mapping of phonons onto\ngauge bosons (\"stress photons\"), which encode for the capacity of the crystal\nto propagate stresses. Dislocations and disclinations, the topological defects\nof the crystal, are sources for the gauge fields and the melting of the crystal\ncan be understood as the proliferation (condensation) of these defects, giving\nrise to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism on the dual side. For the liquid crystal\nphases, the shear sector of the gauge bosons becomes massive signaling that\nshear rigidity is lost. Resting on symmetry principles, we derive the\nphenomenological imaginary time actions of quantum nematics and smectics and\nanalyze the full spectrum of collective modes. The quantum nematic is a\nsuperfluid having a true rotational Goldstone mode due to rotational symmetry\nbreaking, and the origin of this 'deconfined' mode is traced back to the\ncrystalline phase. The two-dimensional quantum smectic turns out to be a\ndizzyingly anisotropic phase with the collective modes interpolating between\nthe solid and nematic in a non-trivial way. We also consider electrically\ncharged bosonic crystals and liquid crystals, and carefully analyze the\nelectromagnetic response of the quantum liquid crystal phases. In particular,\nthe quantum nematic is a real superconductor and shows the Meissner effect.\nTheir special properties inherited from spatial symmetry breaking show up\nmostly at finite momentum, and should be accessible by momentum-sensitive\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Recently, the concept of topological insulators has been generalized to\ntopological semimetals, including three-dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetals, 3D\nDirac semimetals, and 3D node-line semimetals. In particular, several compounds\n(e.g., certain three-dimensional graphene networks, Cu3PdN, Ca3P2) were\ndiscovered to be 3D node-line semimetals, in which the conduction and the\nvalence bands cross at closed lines in the Brillouin zone. Except for the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Dirac semimetal (e.g., in graphene), 2D topological\nsemimetals are much less investigated. Here, we propose the new concept of a 2D\nnode-line semimetal and suggest that this state could be realized in a new\nmixed lattice (we name it as HK lattice) composed by kagome and honeycomb\nlattices. We find that A3B2 (A is a group-IIB cation and B is a group-VA anion)\ncompounds (such as Hg3As2) with the HK lattice are 2D node-line semimetals due\nto the band inversion between cation s orbital and anion pz orbital. In the\npresence of buckling or spin-orbit coupling, the 2D node-line semimetal state\nmay turn into 2D Dirac semimetal state or 2D topological crystalline insulating\nstate.\n", "  We consider the problem of determination of the neutrino mass ordering via\nprecise study of the vacuum neutrino oscillations in the JUNO and other future\nmedium baseline reactor neutrino experiments. We are proposing to resolve\nneutrino mass ordering by determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters\nfrom analysis of the data of the reactor experiments and comparison them with\nthe oscillation parameters obtained from analysis of the solar and KamLAND\nexperiments.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the reconstruction of the Higgs mass in events\nwith Higgs bosons decaying into a pair of tau leptons. The algorithm is based\non matrix element (ME) techniques and achieves a relative resolution on the\nHiggs boson mass of typically 15-20%. A previous version of the algorithm has\nbeen used in analyses of Higgs boson production performed by the CMS\ncollaboration during LHC Run 1. The algorithm is described in detail and its\nperformance on simulated events is assessed. The development of techniques to\nhandle tau decays in the ME formalism represents an important result of this\npaper.\n", "  We introduce a radar system capable of tracking a $5$mm spherical target\ncontinuously in three dimensions. The $10$GHz (X-band) radar system has a\ntransmission power of $1$W and operates in the near field of the horn antennae.\nBy comparing the phase shift of the electromagnetic wave traveling through the\nfree space with an IQ-Mixer, we obtain the relative movement of the target with\nrespect to the antennae. From the azimuth and inclination angles of the\nreceiving antennae obtained in the calibration, we reconstruct the target\ntrajectory in a three-dimensional Cartesian system. Finally, we test the\ntracking algorithm with target moving in circular as well as in pendulum\nmotions, and discuss the capability of the radar system.\n", "  When the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - a system of deconfined quarks and gluons\n- is in a nonequilibrium state, it is usually unstable with respect to color\ncollective modes. The instabilities, which are expected to strongly influence\ndynamics of the QGP produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are\nextensively discussed under the assumption that the plasma is weakly coupled.\nWe begin by presenting the theoretical approaches to study the QGP, which\ninclude: field theory methods based on the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism,\nclassical and kinetic theories, and fluid techniques. The dispersion equations,\nwhich give the spectrum of plasma collective excitations, are analyzed in\ndetail. Particular attention is paid to a momentum distribution of plasma\nconstituents which is obtained by deforming an isotropic momentum distribution.\nMechanisms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic instabilities are explained in\nterms of elementary physics. The Nyquist analysis, which allows one to\ndetermine the number of solutions of a dispersion equation without explicitly\nsolving it, and stability criteria are also discussed. We then review various\nnumerical approaches - purely classical or quantum - to simulate the temporal\nevolution of an unstable quark-gluon plasma. The dynamical role of\ninstabilities in the processes of plasma equilibration is analyzed.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the elastocaloric (eC) effect in natural rubber\n(NR) is studied adiabatically and isothermally. A broad temperature span for eC\neffect from 0 oC to 49 oC is observed. The maximum adiabatic temperature change\n({\\Delta}T) is 12 K at strain of 6 and occurs at 10 oC. These behaviors can be\npredicted by the temperature dependence of strain-induced crystallization (SIC)\nand temperature-induced crystallization (TIC). In isothermal condition, the\ndeduced {\\Delta}T from Clausius-Clapeyron factor can agree with the direct\nmeasurement at different temperatures. The eC performance of NR is compared\nwith shape memory alloys (SMAs). The potential of NR for a near room\ntemperature cooing application is primarily proved. This will open the SIC\nresearch of NR towards eC cooling direction.\n", "  We construct many new invariant solutions to the Strominger system with\nrespect to a 2-parameter family of metric connections\n$\\nabla^{\\varepsilon,\\rho}$ in the anomaly cancellation equation. The ansatz\n$\\nabla^{\\varepsilon,\\rho}$ is a natural extension of the canonical 1-parameter\nfamily of Hermitian connections found by Gauduchon, as one recovers the Chern\nconnection $\\nabla^{c}$ for $({\\varepsilon,\\rho})=(0,\\frac12)$, and the Bismut\nconnection $\\nabla^{+}$ for $({\\varepsilon,\\rho})=(\\frac12,0)$. In particular,\nexplicit invariant solutions to the Strominger system with respect to the Chern\nconnection, with non-flat instanton and positive $\\alpha'$ are obtained.\nFurthermore, we give invariant solutions to the heterotic equations of motion\nwith respect to the Bismut connection. Our solutions live on three different\ncompact non-K\\\"ahler homogeneous spaces, obtained as the quotient by a lattice\nof maximal rank of a nilpotent Lie group, the semisimple group\nSL(2,$\\mathbb{C}$) and a solvable Lie group. To our knowledge, these are the\nonly known invariant solutions to the heterotic equations of motion, and we\nconjecture that there is no other such homogeneous space admitting an invariant\nsolution to the heterotic equations of motion with respect to a connection in\nthe ansatz $\\nabla^{\\varepsilon,\\rho}$.\n", "  Millimeter-wave remote sensing technology can significantly improve\nmeasurements of volcanic eruptions, yielding new insights into eruption\nprocesses and improving forecasts of drifting volcanic ash for aviation safety.\nRadiometers can measure water vapor density and temperature inside eruption\nclouds, improving on existing measurements with infrared cameras that are\nlimited to measuring the outer cloud surface. Millimeter-wave radar can measure\nthe 3D mass distribution of volcanic ash inside eruption plumes and their\nnearby drifting ash clouds. Millimeter wavelengths are better matched to\ntypical ash particle sizes, offering better sensitivity than longer wavelength\nexisting weather radar measurements, as well as the unique ability to directly\nmeasure ash particle size in-situ. Here we present sensitivity calculations in\nthe context of developing the WAMS (Water and Ash Millimeter-wave Spectrometer)\ninstrument. WAMS, a radar/radiometer system designed to use off-the-shelf\ncomponents, would be able to measure water vapor and ash throughout an entire\neruption cloud, a unique capability.\n", "  Thermodynamic fluctuation metrics in Ruppeiner's formalism are worked out for\nKerr-AdS black holes in the extended state space. The implications of\nconstraints upon the state space geometry and their correspondence with\nthermodynamical ensembles are explicitly worked out in the most general\nsetting. The state space scalar curvature for a given ensemble is found to be\nsensitive to the instabilities/phase transitions therein. In particular, it is\nfound that the appropriate Ruppeiner scalar curvature does encode critical\nphenomena in the Kerr-AdS black holes. A detailed study is undertaken of the\ncurvature contour of the state space of the 4d Kerr-AdS black hole and suitable\ninferences are drawn. In particular, thermodynamic geometry suggests an\ninstability in the Schwarzschild-AdS limit for all the ensembles except the\npressure ensemble which is equivalent to the unextended state space of the\nKerr-AdS black holes. The extrinsic geometry of the ensemble hypersurfaces is\nintroduced and its relevance to constrained thermodynamic fluctuations\ndiscussed. A new interpretation for the thermodynamic curvature of black hole\nsystems is suggested.\n", "  We discuss the realization of quantum advantage in a system without quantum\nentanglement but with non-zero quantum discord. We propose an optical\nrealization of symmetric two-qubit $X$-states with controllable anti-diagonal\nelements. This approach does not requires initially entangled states, and it\ncan generate states that have quantum discord, with or without entanglement. We\ndiscuss how quantum advantage can be attained in the context of a two-qubit\ngame. We show that when entanglement is not present, the maximum quantum\nadvantage is 1/3 bit. A comparable quantum advantage, 0.311 bit, can be\nrealized with a simplified transaction protocol involving one vs. the three\nunitary operations needed for the maximum advantage.\n", "  In this work we present the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy\nmodels in the framework of particle creation mechanism. The particle creation\nmechanism presented here describes the true non equilibrium thermodynamics of\nthe universe. In spatially flat Friedmann-Lema{\\^\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse considered here, the dissipative bulk viscous pressure is due to the\nnon conservation of particle number. For simplicity, we assume that the\ncreation of perfect fluid particles to be isentropic (adiabatic) and\nconsequently the viscous pressure obeys a linear relationship with particle\ncreation rate. Due to complicated nature of the Einstein's field equations,\ndynamical systems analysis has been performed to understand deeply about the\ncosmological dynamics. We have found some interesting cosmological scenarios\nlike late-time evolution of universe dominated by dark energy which could mimic\nquintessence, cosmological constant or phantom field through a dark matter\ndominated era. We also obtained a possibility of crossing the phantom divide\nline which is favored by observations.\n", "  Using analytic properties of Blaschke factors we construct a family of\nanalytic hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of the torus for which the spectral\nproperties of the associated transfer operator acting on a suitable Hilbert\nspace can be computed explicitly. As a result, we obtain explicit expressions\nfor the decay of correlations of analytic observables without resorting to any\nkind of perturbation argument.\n", "  We study nuclear propagation through avoided crossings of electron energy\nlevels. We construct a surface hopping semigroup, which gives an Egorov-type\ndescription of the dynamics. The underlying time-dependent Schroedinger\nequation has a two-by-two matrix-valued potential, whose eigenvalue surfaces\nhave an avoided crossing. Using microlocal normal forms reminiscent of the\nLandau-Zener problem, we prove convergence to the true solution in the\nsemi-classical limit.\n", "  In this note, we extend the striking connections between quantum integrable\nsystems and conformal blocks recently found in http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01858\nin several directions. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the action of\nquartic conformal Casimir operator on general d-dimensional scalar conformal\nblocks, can be expressed in terms of certain combinations of commuting\nintegrals of motions of the two particle hyperbolic BC2 Calogero-Sutherland\nsystem. The permutation and reflection properties of the underlying Dunkl\noperators play crucial roles in establishing such a connection. Next, we show\nthat the scalar superconformal blocks in SCFTs with four and eight supercharges\nand suitable chirality constraints can also be identified with the\neigenfunctions of the same Calogero-Sutherland system, this demonstrates the\nuniversality of such a connection. Finally, we observe that the so-called\n\"seed\" conformal blocks for constructing four point functions for operators\nwith arbitrary space-time spins in four dimensional CFTs can also be linearly\nexpanded in terms of Calogero-Sutherland eigenfunctions.\n", "  The spectra and wave functions of heavy-light mesons are calculated within a\nrelativistic quark model, which is based on a heavy-quark expansion of the\ninstantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation by applying the Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation. The kernel we choose is the standard combination of linear\nscalar and Coulombic vector. The effective Hamiltonian for heavy-light\nquark-antiquark system is calculated up to order $1/m_Q^2$. Our results are in\ngood agreement with available experimental data except for the anomalous\n$D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states. The newly observed heavy-light\nmeson states can be accommodated successfully in the relativistic quark model\nwith their assignments presented. The $D_{sJ}^*(2860)$ can be interpreted as\nthe $|1^{3/2}D_1\\rangle$ and $|1^{5/2}D_3\\rangle$ states being members of the\n1D family with $J^P=1^-$ and $3^-$.\n", "  Square ice is a statistical mechanics model for two-dimensional ice, widely\nbelieved to have a conformally invariant scaling limit. We associate a Peano\n(space filling) curve to a square ice configuration, and more generally to a\nso-called 6-vertex model configuration, and argue that its scaling limit is a\nspace-filling version of the random fractal curve SLE$_\\kappa$,\nSchramm--Loewner evolution with parameter $\\kappa$, where $4<\\kappa\\leq\n12+8\\sqrt{2}$. For square ice, $\\kappa=12$. At the \"free-fermion point\" of the\n6-vertex model, $\\kappa=8+4\\sqrt{3}$. These unusual values lie outside the\nclassical interval $2\\le \\kappa\\le 8$.\n", "  The breakdown of the SU(6) global symmetry to its SU(5) subgroup, that\ncontains the standard model (SM) gauge group, in the E6 inspired composite\nHiggs model (E6CHM) results in a set of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs).\nThis set, in particular, involves the SM-like Higgs doublet and a SM singlet\nboson. In the limit when CP is conserved the SM singlet scalar A is a CP-odd\nstate that does not mix with the SM-like Higgs. The interactions of A with\nexotic matter beyond the SM, which ensures anomaly cancellation and approximate\ngauge coupling unification, can induce couplings of this pseudoscalar to the SM\ngauge bosons. We specify the interactions of the SM singlet pNGB state with the\nexotic vector-like fermions, top quark and SM gauge bosons. Also we explore the\ndependence of the branching ratios of the pseudoscalar A and its LHC production\ncross section on the parameters of the E6CHM.\n", "  An effective, reliable and time saving numerical method with using of the\nPruefer transformation is proposed to calculate eigenvalues of\nChandrasekhar-Page angular equations.\n", "  Inertial modes are the eigenmodes of contained rotating fluids restored by\nthe Coriolis force. When the fluid is incompressible, inviscid and contained in\na rigid container, these modes satisfy Poincar\\'e's equation that has the\npeculiarity of being hyperbolic with boundary conditions. Inertial modes are\ntherefore solutions of an ill-posed boundary-value problem. In this paper we\ninvestigate the mathematical side of this problem. We first show that the\nPoincar\\'e problem can be formulated in the Hilbert space of square-integrable\nfunctions, with no hypothesis on the continuity or the differentiability of\nvelocity fields. We observe that with this formulation, the Poincar\\'e operator\nis bounded and self-adjoint and as such, its spectrum is the union of the point\nspectrum (the set of eigenvalues) and the continuous spectrum only. When the\nfluid volume is an ellipsoid, we show that the inertial modes form a complete\nbase of polynomial velocity fields for the square-integrable velocity fields\ndefined over the ellipsoid and meeting the boundary conditions. If the\nellipsoid is axisymmetric then the base can be identified with the set of\nPoincar\\'e modes, first obtained by Bryan (1889), and completed with the\ngeostrophic modes.\n", "  We present a Mathematica package, QSWalk, to simulate the time evaluation of\nQuantum Stochastic Walks (QSWs) on arbitrary directed and weighted graphs. QSWs\nare a generalization of continuous time quantum walks that incorporate both\ncoherent and incoherent dynamics and as such, include both quantum walks and\nclassical random walks as special cases. The incoherent component allows for\nquantum walks along directed graph edges. The dynamics of QSWs are expressed\nusing the Lindblad formalism, originally developed for open quantum systems,\nwhich frames the problem in the language of density matrices. For a QSW on a\ngraph of $N$ vertices, we have a sparse superoperator in an $N^2$-dimensional\nspace, which can be solved efficiently using the built-in MatrixExp function in\nMathematica. We illustrate the use of the QSWalk package through several\nexample case studies.\n", "  Ultrasound waves propagating in water or soft biological tissue are strongly\nreflected when encountering the skull, which limits the use of ultrasound-based\ntechniques in transcranial imaging and therapeutic applications. Current\nknowledge on the acoustic properties of the cranial bone is restricted to\nfar-field observations, leaving its near-field properties unexplored. We report\non the existence of skull-guided acoustic waves, which was herein confirmed by\nnear-field measurements of optoacoustically-induced responses in ex-vivo murine\nskulls immersed in water. Dispersion of the guided waves was found to\nreasonably agree with the prediction of a multilayered flat plate model. It is\ngenerally anticipated that our findings may facilitate and broaden the\napplication of ultrasound-mediated techniques in brain diagnostics and therapy.\n", "  The desire to produce high-quality single photons for applications in quantum\ninformation science has lead to renewed interest in exploring solid-state\nemitters in the weak excitation regime. Under these conditions it is expected\nthat photons are coherently scattered, and so benefit from a substantial\nsuppression of detrimental interactions between the source and its surrounding\nenvironment. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here that this reasoning is\nincomplete, as phonon interactions continue to play a crucial role in\ndetermining solid-state emission characteristics even for very weak excitation.\nWe find that the sideband resulting from non-Markovian relaxation of the phonon\nenvironment is excitation strength independent. It thus leads to an intrinsic\nlimit to the fraction of coherently scattered light and to the visibility of\ntwo-photon coalescence at weak driving, both of which are absent for atomic\nsystems or within simpler Markovian treatments.\n", "  Integrable spin systems are an important subclass of integrable (soliton)\nnonlinear equations. They play important role in physics and mathematics. At\npresent, many integrable spin systems were found and studied. They are related\nwith the motion of 3-dimensional curves. In this paper, we consider a model of\ntwo moving interacting curves. Next, we find its integrable reduction related\nwith some integrable coupled spin system. Then we show that this integrable\ncoupled spin system is equivalent to the famous Manakov system.\n", "  This paper reports a series of measurements that characterize the directional\ndependence of the scintillation response of crystalline melt-grown and\nsolution-grown stilbene to incident DT and DD neutrons. These measurements give\nthe amplitude and pulse shape dependence on the proton recoil direction over\none hemisphere of the crystal, confirming and extending previous results in the\nliterature for melt-grown stilbene and providing the first measurements for\nsolution-grown stilbene. In similar measurements of liquid and plastic\ndetectors, no directional dependence was observed, confirming the hypothesis\nthat the anisotropy in stilbene and other organic crystal scintillators is a\nresult of internal effects due to the molecular or crystal structure and not an\nexternal effect on the measurement system.\n", "  A technique is introduced which allows to generate -- starting from any\nsolvable discrete-time dynamical system involving N time-dependent variables --\nnew, generally nonlinear, generations of discrete-time dynamical systems, also\ninvolving N time-dependent variables and being as well solvable by algebraic\noperations (essentially by finding the N zeros of explicitly known polynomials\nof degree N). The dynamical systems constructed using this technique may also\nfeature large numbers of arbitrary constants, and they need not be autonomous.\nThe solvable character of these models allows to identify special cases with\nremarkable time evolutions: for instance, isochronous or asymptotically\nisochronous discrete-time dynamical systems. The technique is illustrated by a\nfew examples.\n", "  At sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes\na transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Such an extreme state of strongly-interacting QCD\n(Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) matter is produced in the laboratory with high-energy\ncollisions of heavy nuclei, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is\nobserved [2-6]. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of\nQGP formation in nuclear collisions [7], is more pronounced for multi-strange\nbaryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed\nin high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions [8,9]. Yet, enhanced\nproduction of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we\npresent the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity\npp collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange\nparticles relative to pions increases significantly with the event\ncharged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement\nwith p-Pb collision results [10,11] indicating that the phenomenon is related\nto the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events\nstrangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in Pb-Pb\ncollisions, where a QGP is formed.\n", "  Transformation of neutron to antineutron is a small effect that has not yet\nbeen experimentally observed. %\\cite{Phillips:2014fgb}. In principle, it can\noccur with free neutrons in the vacuum or with bound neutrons inside the\nnuclear environment different for neutrons and antineutrons and for that reason\nin the latter case it is heavily suppressed. Free neutron transformation also\ncan be suppressed if environmental vector field exists destinguishing neutron\nfrom antineutron. We consider here the case of a vector field coupled to $B-L$\ncharge of the particles ($B-L$ photons) and study a possibility of this to lead\nto the observable suppression of neutron to antineutron transformation. The\nsuppression effect however can be removed by applying external magnetic field.\nIf the neutron--antineutron oscillation will be discovered in free neutron\noscillation experiments, this will imply limits on $B-L$ photon coupling\nconstant and interaction radius few order of magnitudes stronger than present\nlimits form the tests of the equivalence principle. If $n-\\bar n$ oscillation\nwill be discovered via nuclear instability, but not in free neutron\noscillations in corresponding level, this would indicate to the presence of\nfifth-forces mediated by such baryophotons.\n", "  We report a neutron scattering study of the magnetic excitation spectrum in\neach of the three temperature and pressure driven phases of URu$_2$Si$_2$. We\nfind qualitatively similar excitations throughout the (H0L) scattering plane in\nthe hidden order and large moment phases, with no changes in the\n$\\hbar\\omega$-widths of the excitations at the $\\Sigma$ = (1.407,0,0) and $Z$ =\n(1,0,0) points, within our experimental resolution. There is, however, an\nincrease in the gap at the $\\Sigma$ point from 4.2(2) meV to 5.5(3) meV,\nconsistent with other indicators of enhanced antiferromagnetism under pressure.\n", "  We study numerically the evolution of perturbed Korteweg-de Vries solitons\nand of well localized initial data by the Novikov-Veselov (NV) equation at\ndifferent levels of the \"energy\" parameter $ E $. We show that as $ |E| \\to\n\\infty $, NV behaves, as expected, similarly to its formal limit, the\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. However at intermediate regimes, i.e. when $ |\nE | $ is not very large, more varied scenarios are possible, in particular,\nblow-ups are observed. The mechanism of the blow-up is studied.\n", "  The thermal model properly describes the production yields of light nuclei in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions even so the loosely bound sizable nuclei\ncannot exist in the dense and hot hadron gas at a chemical freeze-out. Within\nthe coalescence model, light nuclei are formed at the latest stage of nuclear\ncollisions - a kinetic freeze-out - due to final state interactions. After\ndiscussing the models, we derive simple analytic formulas and, using model\nparameters directly inferred from experimental data, we show that the thermal\nand coalescence model predictions are quantitatively close to each other. A\npossibility to falsify one of the two models is suggested.\n", "  Frequency domain super-heterodyne laser light scattering is utilized in a low\nangle integral measurement configuration to determine flow and diffusion in\ncharged sphere suspensions showing moderate to strong multiple scattering. We\nintroduce an empirical correction to subtract the multiple scattering\nbackground and isolate the singly scattered light. We demonstrate the excellent\nfeasibility of this simple approach for turbid suspensions of transmittance\nT>0.4. We study the particle concentration dependence of the electro-kinetic\nmobility in low salt aqueous suspension over an extended concentration regime\nand observe a maximum at intermediate concentrations. We further use our scheme\nfor measurements of the self-diffusion coefficients in the fluid samples in the\nabsence or presence of shear, as well as in polycrystalline samples during\ncrystallization and coarsening. We discuss the scope and limits of our approach\nas well as possible future applications.\n", "  We show that a quantum network can protect the identity of a sender and\nreceiver from an external wiretapper. This new quantum communication protocol,\nwhich we call secure quantum routing, requires only single photons routed by\nlinear optical elements and photon counters, and does not require distributing\nentanglement over multiple nodes or active feedforward. We prove that secure\nquantum routing protects both the contents of the message and the identity of\nthe sender and receiver, and creates only a negligible reduction in the network\nchannel capacity.\n", "  We investigate the field dependence of the gauge coupling functions of\nfour-dimensional Type IIB orientifold and F-theory compactifications with\nspace-time filling seven-branes. In particular, we analyze the constraints\nimposed by holomorphicity and covariance under shift-symmetries of the bulk and\nbrane axions. This requires introducing quantum corrections that necessarily\ncontain Riemann theta functions on the complex torus spanned by the D7-brane\nWilson line moduli. Our findings hint towards a new underlying geometric\nstructure for gauge coupling functions in string compactifications. We\ngeneralize this discussion to a genuine F-theory compactification on an\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold. We perform the first general\ndimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity and dualization to the\nF-theory frame. The resulting effective action is compared with the circle\nreduction of a four-dimensional N=1 supergravity theory. The F-theory geometry\nelegantly unifies bulk and brane degrees of freedom and allows us to infer\nnon-trivial results about holomorphicity and shift-symmetries. For instance, we\ngain new insight into kinetic mixing of bulk and brane gauge fields.\n", "  Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory are often presented as\nfeaturing \"retrocausal\" effects in addition to the usual forward notion of\ncausation. This paper examines the ontological implications of certain\ntimesymmetric theories, and finds that no dynamical notion of causation applies\nto them, either forward or backward. It is concluded that such theories\nactually describe a static picture, in which the notion of causation is\nrelegated to a descriptor of static relationships among events. In addition,\nthese theories lead to an epistemic rather than ontologically referring,\nrealist view of quantum states.\n", "  We propose a holographic computation of the $2\\rightarrow 2$ meson scattering\nin a curved string background, dual to a QCD-like theory. We recover the\nVeneziano amplitude and compute a perturbative correction due to the background\ncurvature. The result implies a small deviation from a linear trajectory, which\nis a requirement of the UV regime of QCD.\n", "  In this work, we show that a complex equiangular tight frame (ETF) composed\nby $N$ vectors in dimension $d$ exists if and only if a certain bistochastic\nmatrix, univocally determined by $N$ and $d$, belongs to a special class of\nunistochastic matrices. This connection allows us to find new complex ETF in\ninfinitely many dimensions and to derive a method to introduce non-trivial free\nparameters in ETF. We derive a 6-parametric family of complex ETF(6,16), which\ndefines a family of symmetric POVM. Minimal and maximal possible average\nentanglement of the vectors within this qubit-qutrit family are presented.\nFurthermore, we propose an efficient numerical procedure to find the unitary\nmatrix underlying a unistochastic matrix, which we apply to find all existing\nclasses of complex ETF containing up to 19 vectors.\n", "  For static fluid interiors of compact objects in pure Lovelock gravity\n(involving ony one $N$th order term in the equation) we establish similarity in\nsolutions for the critical odd and even $d=2N+1, 2N+2$ dimensions. It turns out\nthat in critical odd $d=2N+1$ dimensions, there can exist no bound distribution\nwith a finite radius, while in critical even $d=2N+2$ dimensions, all solutions\nhave similar behavior. For exhibition of similarity we would compare star\nsolutions for $N =1, 2$ in $d=4$ Einstein and $d=6$ in Gauss-Bonnet theory\nrespectively. We also obtain the pure Lovelock analogue of the Finch-Skea\nmodel.\n", "  The inclusive $J/\\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra and nuclear\nmodification factors are reported at midrapidity ($|y|<1.0$) in Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV taken by the STAR\nexperiment. A suppression of $J/\\psi$ production, with respect to\n{\\color{black}the production in $p+p$ scaled by the number of binary\nnucleon-nucleon collisions}, is observed in central Au+Au collisions at these\nthree energies. No significant energy dependence of nuclear modification\nfactors is found within uncertainties. The measured nuclear modification\nfactors can be described by model calculations that take into account both\nsuppression of direct $J/\\psi$ production due to the color screening effect and\n$J/\\psi$ regeneration from recombination of uncorrelated charm-anticharm quark\npairs.\n", "  Plasmonic cavities can be used to control the atom-photon coupling process at\nthe nanoscale, since they provide ultrahigh density of optical states in an\nexceptionally small mode volume. Here we demonstrate strong coupling between\nmolecular excitons and plasmonic resonances (so-called plexcitonic coupling) in\na film-coupled nanocube cavity, which can induce profound and significant\nspectral and spatial modifications to the plasmonic gap modes. Within the\nspectral span of a single gap mode in the nanotube-film cavity with a 3-nm wide\ngap, the introduction of narrow-band J-aggregate dye molecules not only enables\nan anti-crossing behavior in the spectral response, but also splits the single\nspatial mode into two distinct modes that are easily identified by their\nfar-field scattering profiles. Simulation results confirm the experimental\nfindings and the sensitivity of the plexcitonic coupling is explored using\ndigital control of the gap spacing. Our work opens up a new perspective to\nstudy the strong coupling process, greatly extending the functionality of\nnanophotonic systems, with the potential to be applied in cavity quantum\nelectrodynamic systems.\n", "  The fracture process of commercially pure titanium was visualized in model\nmaterials containing artificial holes. These model materials were fabricated\nusing a femtosecond laser coupled with a diffusion bonding technique to obtain\nvoids in the interior of titanium samples. Changes in void dimensions during\nin-situ straining were recorded in three dimensions using x-ray computed\ntomography. Void growth obtained experimentally was compared with the Rice and\nTracey model which predicted well the average void growth. A large scatter in\nvoid growth data was explained by differences in grain orientation which was\nconfirmed by crystal plasticity simulations. It was also shown that grain\norientation has a stronger effect on void growth than intervoid spacing and\nmaterial strength. Intervoid spacing, however, appears to control whether the\nintervoid ligament failure is ductile or brittle.\n", "  We describe a novel, very fast and robust, directed search incoherent method\nfor periodic gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron stars in binary systems. As\ndirected search, we assume the source sky position to be known with enough\naccuracy, but all other parameters are supposed to be unknown. We exploit the\nfrequency-modulation due to source orbital motion to unveil the signal\nsignature by commencing from a collection of time and frequency peaks. We\nvalidate our pipeline adding 131 artificial continuous GW signals from pulsars\nin binary systems to simulated detector Gaussian noise, characterized by a\npower spectral density Sh = 4x10^-24 Hz^-1/2 in the frequency interval [70,\n200] Hz, which is overall commensurate with the advanced detector design\nsensitivities. The pipeline detected 128 signals, and the weakest signal\ninjected and detected has a GW strain amplitude of ~10^-24, assuming one month\nof gapless data collected by a single advanced detector. We also provide\nsensitivity estimations, which show that, for a single- detector data covering\none month of observation time, depending on the source orbital Doppler\nmodulation, we can detect signals with an amplitude of ~7x10^-25. By using\nthree detectors, and one year of data, we would easily gain more than a factor\n3 in sensitivity, translating into being able to detect weaker signals. We also\ndiscuss the parameter estimate proficiency of our method, as well as\ncomputational budget, which is extremely cheap. In fact, sifting one month of\nsingle-detector data and 131 Hz-wide frequency range takes roughly 2.4 CPU\nhours. Due to the high computational speed, the current procedure can be\nreadily applied in ally-sky schemes, sieving in parallel as many sky positions\nas permitted by the available computational power.\n", "  We study the measurement-induced geometric discord based on the trace norm\nand generalize some properties known for qutrits to qudits. Previous\npreliminary results for bipartite qutrit systems (i.e. d=3 systems) are here\nstrictly proved for arbitrary d. Present study supports observations, coming\nalso from other approaches, that systems with $d \\geq 3$ show similar behaviour\nwhen quantum correlations are concerned, but there is pronounced difference\nbetween d=2 and d=3. Qubit systems are exceptionally simple. Underlying\ngeometry of state spaces and related Lie groups are responsible for that.\n", "  A butterfly-based fast direct integral equation solver for analyzing\nhigh-frequency scattering from two-dimensional objects is presented. The solver\nleverages a randomized butterfly scheme to compress blocks corresponding to\nnear- and far-field interactions in the discretized forward and inverse\nelectric field integral operators. The observed memory requirements and\ncomputational cost of the proposed solver scale as O(Nlog^2N) and O(N^1.5\nlogN), respectively. The solver is applied to the analysis of scattering from\nelectrically large objects spanning over ten thousand of wavelengths and\nmodeled in terms of five million unknowns.\n", "  We study the so-called elephant random walk (ERW) which is a non-Markovian\ndiscrete-time random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}$ with unbounded memory which exhibits\na phase transition from diffusive to superdiffusive behaviour. We prove a law\nof large numbers and a central limit theorem. Remarkably the central limit\ntheorem applies not only to the diffusive regime but also to the phase\ntransition point which is superdiffusive. Inside the superdiffusive regime the\nERW converges to a non-degenerate random variable which is not normal. We also\nobtain explicit expressions for the correlations of increments of the ERW.\n", "  We report on precise measurements of magnetic field gradients extracted from\ntransverse relaxation rates of precessing spin samples. The experimental\napproach is based on the free precession of gaseous, nuclear spin polarized\n$^3$He and $^{129}$Xe atoms in a spherical cell inside a magnetic guiding field\nof about 400 nT using LT$_C$ SQUIDs as low-noise magnetic flux detectors. The\ntransverse relaxation rates of both spin species are simultaneously monitored\nas magnetic field gradients are varied. For transverse relaxation times\nreaching 100 h, the residual longitudinal field gradient across the spin sample\ncould be deduced to be$|\\vec{\\nabla}B_z|=(5.6 \\pm 0.4)$ pT/cm. The method takes\nadvantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio with which the decaying spin\nprecession signal can be monitored that finally leads to the exceptional\naccuracy to determine magnetic field gradients at the sub pT/cm scale.\n", "  We consider the D^8 R^5 and D^{10} R^5 terms in the low momentum expansion of\nthe five graviton amplitude in type IIB string theory at one loop. They involve\nintegrals of various modular graph functions over the fundamental domain of\nSL(2,Z). Unlike the graphs which arise in the four graviton amplitude or at\nlower orders in the momentum expansion of the five graviton amplitude where the\nlinks are given by scalar Green functions, there are several graphs for the D^8\nR^5 and D^{10} R^5 terms where two of the links are each given by a derivative\nof the Green function. Starting with appropriate auxiliary diagrams, we show\nthat these graphs can be expressed in terms of those which do not involve any\nderivatives. This results in considerable simplification of the amplitude.\n", "  We predict the existence of interaction-driven edge states of bound\ntwo-photon quasiparticles in a dimer periodic array of nonlinear optical\ncavities. Energy spectrum of photon pairs is dramatically richer than in the\nnoninteracting case or in a simple lattice, featuring collapse and revival of\nmultiple edge and bulk modes as well as edge states in continuum. Despite the\nunexpected breakdown of the Zak phase technique and the edge mixing of internal\nand center-of-mass motion we link the edge state existence to the two-photon\nquantum walk graph connectivity, thus uncovering the topological nature of the\nmany-body problem in complex lattices.\n", "  We argue that because of valence-fluctuation caused dynamical changes\n(fluctuations) of impurity energies in the impurity band of SmB6, energies of\nelectrons occupying impurity sites can be due to the uncertainty principle only\nestimated with corresponding uncertainty, so they can be represented by energy\nintervals of non-zero width. As a conse- quence, both occupied as well as\nunoccupied states can be found in the impurity band above as well as below\nFermi level even in the ground state. Therefore the subsystem of localized\ncharge carriers in the ground state of SmB6 cannot be described by an energy\ndistribution function expected for T = 0 K. This fundamental conclusion adds\nanother reason for absence of resistivity divergence in SmB6 at lowest\ntemperatures, and sheds new light on interpretation of experimental data\nobtained for SmB6 and similar systems at lowest temperatures.\n", "  Neutron stars and quark stars are ideal laboratories to study fundamental\nphysics at supra nuclear densities and strong gravitational fields.\nAstrophysical observables, however, depend strongly on the star's internal\nstructure, which is currently unknown due to uncertainties in the equation of\nstate. Universal relations, however, exist among certain stellar observables\nthat do not depend sensitively on the star's internal structure. One such set\nof relations is between the star's moment of inertia ($I$), its tidal Love\nnumber (Love) and its quadrupole moment ($Q$), the so-called I-Love-Q\nrelations. Similar relations hold among the star's multipole moments, which\nresemble the well-known black hole no-hair theorems. Universal relations break\ndegeneracies among astrophysical observables, leading to a variety of\napplications: (i) X-ray measurements of the nuclear matter equation of state,\n(ii) gravitational wave measurements of the intrinsic spin of inspiraling\ncompact objects, and (iii) gravitational and astrophysical tests of General\nRelativity that are independent of the equation of state. We here review how\nthe universal relations come about and all the applications that have been\ndevised to date.\n", "  Making full usage of bipolar transport in single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)\ntransistors could permit the development of two-in-one quantum devices with\nultra-short channels. We report on clean $\\sim$10 to 100 nm long suspended\nSWCNT transistors which display a large electron-hole transport asymmetry. The\ndevices consist of naked SWCNT channels contacted with sections of\nSWCNT-under-annealed-gold. The annealed gold acts as an n-doping top gate which\ncreates nm-sharp barriers at the junctions between the contacts and naked\nchannel. These tunnel barriers define a single quantum dot (QD) whose charging\nenergies to add an electron or a hole are vastly different ($e-h$ charging\nenergy asymmetry). We parameterize the $e-h$ transport asymmetry by the ratio\nof the hole and electron charging energies $\\eta_{e-h}$. We show that this\nasymmetry is maximized for short channels and small band gap SWCNTs. In a small\nband gap SWCNT device, we demonstrate the fabrication of a two-in-one quantum\ndevice acting as a QD for holes, and a much longer quantum bus for electrons.\nIn a 14 nm long channel, $\\eta_{e-h}$ reaches up to 2.6 for a device with a\nband gap of 270 meV. This strong $e-h$ transport asymmetry survives even at\nroom temperature.\n", "  We study the class of indecomposable two-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg theories\nwith (2,2) supersymmetry and central charge c < 6 with the aim of classifying\nall such theories up to marginal deformations. Our results include cases\noverlooked in previous classifications. The results are rigorous for three or\nfewer fields and more generally are rigorous if we assume an extra bound.\nNumerics suggest that we have the complete set of indecomposable\nLandau-Ginzburg families with c<6. This set consists of 38 infinite families\nand a finite list of 418 sporadic cases. The basic tools are classic results of\nKreuzer and Skarke on quasi-homogeneous isolated singularities and solutions to\ncertain feasibility integer programming problems.\n", "  We report on the observation of a high visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel interference\nof two heralded photons emitted from a spontaneous parametric down\nconversion~(SPDC) pumped by continuous-wave~(cw) light. A non-degenerate photon\npair at 1541~nm and 1580~nm is generated by cw-pumped SPDC through a\nperiodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. The heralded single photon at\n1541~nm is prepared by the detection of the photon at 1580~nm. We performed the\nexperiment of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between heralded single photons\nin separated time bins and observed a high visibility interference. All\ndetectors we used are superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and an\noverall temporal resolution of the photon detection is estimated as 85 ps,\nwhich is sufficiently shorter than the coherence time of the heralded photons.\n", "  Breakup of water jets under gravity is a common-place phenomenon. The role of\nsurface tension in the instability of water jets was recognized by Rayleigh and\nthe theory propounded goes by the name of Plateau-Rayleigh theory. The necks\nand bulges down along the jet-length that are created by perturbation waves of\nwavelengths larger than a certain value keep growing with time and ultimately\ncause the jet to breakup into drops. The effect of perturbation waves have been\ninvestigated experimentally and found to confirm the essentials of the theory.\nHowever, there is no unanimity about the origin of these perturbation waves.\nRecently, the idea of recoil capillary waves as an important source of the\nperturbation waves has been emphasized. The recoil of the end point of the\nremaining continuous jet at its breakup point is considered to travel upward as\na recoil capillary wave which gets reflected at the mouth of the nozzle from\nwhich the jet originates. The reflected capillary wave travels along the jet\ndownward with its Doppler shifted wavelength as a perturbation wave. We set up\nan experiment to directly verify the existence and effect of the recoil\ncapillary waves and present some preliminary results of our experiment.\n", "  We discuss the time dependence of subsystem entropies in interacting quantum\nsystems. As a model for the time dependence, we suggest that the entropy is as\nlarge as possible given two constraints: one follows from the existence of an\nemergent light cone, and the other is a conjecture associated to the\n\"entanglement velocity\" $v_E$. We compare this model to new holographic and\nspin chain computations, and to an operator growth picture. Finally, we\nintroduce a second way of computing the emergent light cone speed in\nholographic theories that provides a boundary dynamics explanation for a\nspecial case of entanglement wedge subregion duality in AdS/CFT.\n", "  We construct a large, redshift complete sample of distant galaxy clusters by\ncorrelating Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) redshifts\nwith clusters identified with the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic\nPercolation (redMaPPer) algorithm. Our spectroscopic completeness is 97% for ~\n7,000 clusters within the redMaPPer selection limit, $z \\leqslant$ 0.325, so\nthat our cluster correlation functions are much more precise than earlier work\nand not suppressed by photometric redshifts. We derive an accurate power-law\nmass-richness relation from the observed abundance with respect to the mass\nfunction from Millennium XXL (MXXL) simulation, adjusted to the Planck weighted\ncosmology. The number density of clusters is found to decline by 20% over the\nrange 0.1 $< z <$ 0.3, in good agreement with the evolution predicted by MXXL.\nOur projected three-dimensional correlation function scales with richness,\n$\\lambda$, rising from $r_0=$ 14 h$^{-1}$ Mpc at $\\lambda\\simeq$ 25, to $r_0=$\n22 h$^{-1}$ Mpc at $\\lambda\\simeq$ 60, with a gradient that matches MXXL when\napplying our mass-richness relation, whereas the observed amplitude of the\ncorrelation function at $\\left<z\\right>=$ 0.24 exceeds the MXXL prediction by\n20% at the $\\simeq$ 2.5$\\sigma$ level. This tension cannot be blamed on\nspurious, randomly located clusters as this would reduce the correlation\namplitude. Full consistency between the correlation function and the abundances\nis achievable for the pre-Planck values of $\\sigma_8=$ 0.9, $\\Omega_m=$ 0.25,\nand h = 0.73, matching the improved distance ladder estimate of the Hubble\nconstant.\n", "  The microcanonical ensemble has long been a starting point for the\ndevelopment of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics. However, this\napproach presents two problems. First, it predicts that the entropy is only\ndefined on a discrete set of energies for finite, quantum systems, while\nthermodynamics requires the entropy to be a continuous function of the energy.\nSecond, it fails to satisfy the stability condition ($\\Delta S / \\Delta U < 0$)\nfor first-order transitions with both classical and quantum systems. Swendsen\nhas recently shown that the source of these problems lies in the microcanonical\nensemble itself, which contains only energy eigenstates and excludes their\nlinear combinations. To the contrary, if the system of interest has ever been\nin thermal contact with another system, it will be described by a probability\ndistribution over many eigenstates that is equivalent to the canonical ensemble\nfor sufficiently large systems. Novotny et al. have recently supported this\npicture by dynamical numerical calculations for a quantum mechanical model, in\nwhich they showed the approach to a canonical distribution for up to 40 quantum\nspins. By simplifying the problem to calculate only the equilibrium properties,\nwe are able to extend the demonstration to more than a million particles.\n", "  We show that the anyonic statistics of fractionalized excitations display\ncharacteristic signatures in threshold spectroscopic measurements. Drawing\nmotivation from topologically ordered phases such as gapped quantum spin\nliquids and fractional chern insulators which possess fractionalized\nexcitations, we consider gapped systems with abelian anyonic excitations. The\nlow energy onset of associated correlation functions near the threshold show\nuniversal behaviour depending on the statistics of the anyons. This explains\nsome recent theoretical results in spin systems and also provides a route\ntowards detecting statistics in experiments such as neutron scattering and\ntunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  Optomechanical systems show tremendous promise for high sensitivity sensing\nof forces and modification of mechanical properties via light. For example,\nsimilar to neutral atoms and trapped ions, laser cooling of mechanical motion\nby radiation pressure can take single mechanical modes to their ground state.\nConventional optomechanical cooling is able to introduce additional damping\nchannel to mechanical motion, while keeping its thermal noise at the same\nlevel, and as a consequence, the effective temperature of the mechanical mode\nis lowered. However, the ratio of temperature to quality factor remains roughly\nconstant, preventing dramatic advances in quantum sensing using this approach.\nHere we propose an approach for simultaneously reducing the thermal load on a\nmechanical resonator while improving its quality factor. In essence, we use the\noptical interaction to dynamically modify the dominant damping mechanism,\nproviding an optomechanically-induced effect analogous to a phononic band gap.\nThe mechanical mode of interest is assumed to be weakly coupled to its heat\nbath but strongly coupled to a second mechanical mode, which is cooled by\nradiation pressure coupling to a red detuned cavity field. We also identify a\nrealistic optomechanical design that has the potential to realize this novel\ncooling scheme.\n", "  Spatially indirect excitons can be created when an electron and a hole,\nconfined to separate layers of a double quantum well system, bind to form a\ncomposite Boson. Because there is no recombination pathway such excitons are\nlong lived making them accessible to transport studies. Moreover, the ability\nto independently tune both the intralayer charge density and interlayer\nelectron-hole separation provides the capability to reach the low-density,\nstrongly interacting regime where a BEC-like phase transition into a superfluid\nground state is anticipated. To date, transport signatures of the superfluid\ncondensate phase have been seen only in quantum Hall bilayers composed of\ndouble well GaAs heterostructures. Here we report observation of the exciton\ncondensate in the quantum Hall effect regime of double layer structures of\nbilayer graphene. Correlation between the layers is identified by quantized\nHall drag appearing at matched layer densities, and the dissipationless nature\nof the phase is confirmed in the counterflow geometry. Independent tuning of\nthe layer densities and interlayer bias reveals a selection rule involving both\nthe orbital and valley quantum number between the symmetry-broken states of\nbilayer graphene and the condensate phase, while tuning the layer imbalance\nstabilizes the condensate to temperatures in excess of 4K. Our results\nestablish bilayer graphene quantum wells as an ideal system in which to study\nthe rich phase diagram of strongly interacting Bosonic particles in the solid\nstate.\n", "  The theory of free Majorana-Weyl spinors is the prototype of conformal field\ntheory in two dimensions in which the gravitational anomaly and the Weyl\nanomaly obstruct extending the flat spacetime results to curved backgrounds. In\nthis paper, we investigate a quantization scheme in which the short distance\nsingularity in the two-point function of chiral fermions on a two dimensional\ncurved spacetime is given by the Green's function corresponding to the\nclassical field equation. We compute the singular term in the Green's function\nexplicitly and observe that the short distance limit is not well-defined in\ngeneral. We identify constraints on the geometry which are necessary to resolve\nthis problem. On such special backgrounds the theory has locally\n$c=\\frac{1}{2}$ conformal symmetry.\n", "  We investigate retrieval of the stellar rotation signal for Proxima Centauri.\nWe make use of high-resolution spectra taken with uves and harps of Proxima\nCentauri over a 13-year period as well as photometric observations of Proxima\nCentauri from asas and hst. We measure the H{\\alpha} equivalent width and\nH{\\alpha} index, skewness and kurtosis and introduce a method that investigates\nthe symmetry of the line, the Peak Ratio, which appears to return better\nresults than the other measurements. Our investigations return a most\nsignificant period of 82.6 $\\pm$ 0.1 days, confirming earlier photometric\nresults and ruling out a more recent result of 116.6 days which we conclude to\nbe an alias induced by the specific harps observation times. We conclude that\nwhilst spectroscopic H{\\alpha} measurements can be used for period recovery, in\nthe case of Proxima Centauri the available photometric measurements are more\nreliable. We make 2D models of Proxima Centauri to generate simulated\nH{\\alpha}, finding that reasonable distributions of plage and chromospheric\nfeatures are able to reproduce the equivalent width variations in observed data\nand recover the rotation period, including after the addition of simulated\nnoise and flares. However the 2D models used fail to generate the observed\nvariety of line shapes measured by the peak ratio. We conclude that only 3D\nmodels which incorporate vertical motions in the chromosphere can achieve this.\n", "  We consider the \\emph{focusing} nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation posed on the\none dimensional line, with nonzero background condition at spatial infinity,\ngiven by a homogeneous plane wave. For this problem of physical interest, we\nstudy the initial value problem for perturbations of the background wave in\nSobolev spaces. It is well-known that the associated linear dynamics for this\nproblem describes a phenomenon known in the literature as \\emph{modulational\ninstability}, also recently related to the emergence of \\emph{rogue waves} in\nocean dynamics. In qualitative terms, small perturbations of the background\nstate increase its size exponentially in time. In this paper we show that, even\nif there is no time decay for the linear dynamics due to the modulationally\nunstable regime, the equation is still locally well-posed in $H^s$,\n$s>\\frac12$. We apply this result to give a rigorous proof of the unstable\ncharacter of two well-known NLS solutions: the Peregrine and Kuznetsov-Ma\nbreathers.\n", "  Assuming a diagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix, we investigate the\nneutrino Yukawa textures which lead to a non-zero reactor mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. The neutrino effective coupling matrix $\\kappa^{eff}$ is\npre-diagonalized by a constant mixing pattern $V_{\\nu}$ with a vanishing\n$\\theta^{\\nu}_{13}$. The resulting pre-diagonal symmetrical matrix $\\kappa$ is\nset to be four texture zeros with two types of off-diagonal elements nonzero,\nwhich is $\\kappa_{13}$ and $\\kappa_{23}$, respectively. With the expectation of\nsimple textures we thoroughly classify the linear combinations, $\\alpha_{i}$,\n$\\beta_{i}$ and $\\gamma_{i}$ of Yukawa elements $\\lambda_{ij}$ in a same row,\naccording to the values vanishing or not. Each set of the classifications can\nlead to a Yukawa texture which may have implications for the discrete flavor\nmodel buildings. We also present a model based on $A_{4}$ according to one set\nof the constraints on the three combinations with a specific choice of a\ncoefficient in Yukawa texture.\n", "  Aims. Hard X-ray spectra of black hole binaries (BHB) are produced by\nComptonization of soft seed photons by hot electrons near the black hole. The\nslope of the resulting ray spectra is governed by two main parameters: the\nelectron temperature and the optical depth of the emitting plasma. Given the\nextreme brightness of V404~Cyg during the 2015 outburst, we aim to constrain\nthe source spectral properties using an unprecedented time resolution in hard\nX-rays, and to monitor their evolution over the outburst. Methods. We have\nextracted and analyzed 602 X-ray spectra of V404 Cyg obtained by the IBIS/ISGRI\ninstrument on-board INTEGRAL during the 2015 June outburst, using effective\nintegration times ranging between 8 and 176000 seconds. We have fit the\nresulting spectra in the 20-200 keV energy range. Results. We find that while\nthe light curve and soft X-ray spectra of V404 Cyg are remarkably different\nfrom those of other BHBs, the spectral evolution of V404~Cyg in hard X-rays and\nthe relations between the spectral parameters are consistent with those\nobserved in other BHBs. We identify a hard branch} where the electron\ntemperature is anti-correlated with the hard X-ray flux, and a soft flaring\nbranch where the relation reverses. In addition, we find that during long X-ray\nplateaus detected at intermediate fluxes, the thermal Comptonization models\nfail to describe the spectra. However, the statistics improve if we allow the\nabsorption to vary freely in the fits to these spectra. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the hard branch in V404 Cyg is analogous to the canonical hard\nstate of BHBs. V404~Cyg never seems to enter the canonical soft state, although\nthe soft flaring branch bears resemblance to the BHB intermediate state and\nultra-luminous state. The X-ray plateaus are likely the result of absorption by\na Compton-thick outflow which reduces the observed flux by a factor of about\n10.[abridged]\n", "  A major advantage in using Szegedy's formalism over discrete-time and\ncontinuous-time quantum walks lies in its ability to define a unitary quantum\nwalk on directed and weighted graphs. In this paper, we present a general\nscheme to construct efficient quantum circuits for Szegedy quantum walks that\ncorrespond to classical Markov chains possessing transformational symmetry in\nthe columns of the transition matrix. In particular, the transformational\nsymmetry criteria do not necessarily depend on the sparsity of the transition\nmatrix, so this scheme can be applied to non-sparse Markov chains. Two classes\nof Markov chains that are amenable to this construction are cyclic permutations\nand complete bipartite graphs, for which we provide explicit efficient quantum\ncircuit implementations. We also prove that our scheme can be applied to Markov\nchains formed by a tensor product. We also briefly discuss the implementation\nof Markov chains based on weighted interdependent networks. In addition, we\napply this scheme to construct efficient quantum circuits simulating the\nSzegedy walks used in the quantum Pagerank algorithm for some classes of\nnon-trivial graphs, providing a necessary tool for experimental demonstration\nof the quantum Pagerank algorithm.\n", "  Topological states of matter have been a subject of intensive studies in\nrecent years because of their exotic properties such as the topologically\nprotected edge and surface states. The initial studies were exclusively for\nelectron systems. It is now known that topological states can also exist for\nother particles. Indeed, topologically protected edge states have already been\nfound for phonons and photons. In spite of active searching for topological\nstates in many fields, the studies in magnetism are relatively rare although\ntopological states are apparently important and useful in magnonics. Here we\nshow that the pyrochlore ferromagnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction are intrinsic magnonic Weyl semimetals. Similar to the electronic\nWeyl semimetals, the magnon bands in a magnonic Weyl semimetal are nontrivially\ncrossing in pairs at special points (called Weyl nodes) in momentum space. The\nequal energy contour around the Weyl nodes gives rise to the Fermi arcs on\nsample surfaces due to the topologically protected surface states between each\npair of Weyl nodes. Additional Weyl nodes and Fermi arcs can be generated in\nlower energy magnon bands when an anisotropic exchange interaction is\nintroduced.\n", "  Within the spirit of fluid turbulence, we consider the one-dimensional\nMajda-McLaughlin-Tabak (MMT) model that describes the interactions of nonlinear\ndispersive waves. We perform a detailed numerical study of the direct energy\ncascade in the defocusing regime. In particular, we consider a configuration\nwith large-scale forcing and small scale dissipation, and we introduce three\nnon- dimensional parameters: the ratio between nonlinearity and dispersion,\n{\\epsilon}, and the analogues of the Reynolds number, Re, i.e. the ratio\nbetween the nonlinear and dissipative time-scales, both at large and small\nscales. Our numerical experiments show that (i) in the limit of small\n{\\epsilon} the spectral slope observed in the statistical steady regime\ncorresponds to the one predicted by the Weak Wave Turbulence (WWT) theory. (ii)\nAs the nonlinearity is increased, the WWT theory breaks down and deviations\nfrom its predictions are observed. (iii) It is shown that such departures from\nthe WWT theoretical predictions are accompanied by the phenomenon of\nintermittency, typical of three dimensional fluid turbulence. We calculate the\nstructure-function as well as the probability density function of the wave\nfield at each scale and show that the degree of intermittency depends on\n{\\epsilon}.\n", "  We study a simple model describing superradiance in a system of two-level\natoms interacting with a single-mode bosonic field. The model permits a\ncontinuous crossover between integrable and partially chaotic regimes and shows\na complex thermodynamic and quantum phase structure. Several types of\nexcited-state quantum phase transitions separate quantum phases that are\ncharacterized by specific energy dependences of various observables and by\ndifferent atom-field and atom-atom entanglement properties. We observe an\napproximate revival of some states from the weak atom-field coupling limit in\nthe strong coupling regime.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a simple parametrization of the Hubble parameter H\nin order to explain the late time cosmic acceleration. We show that our\nproposal covers many models obtained in different schemes of parametrization\nunder one umbrella. We demonstrate that a simple modification in the functional\nform of Hubble parameter can give rise to interesting cosmological phenomena\nsuch as big rip singularity, bounce and others. We have also constrained the\nmodel parameters using the latest 28 points of H(z) data for three cases which\nadmit transition from deceleration to acceleration.\n", "  We present a method for generating cold neutral atoms via charge exchange\nreactions between trapped ions and Rydberg positronium. The high charge\nexchange reaction cross section leads to efficient neutralisation of the ions\nand since the positronium-ion mass ratio is small, the neutrals do not gain\nappreciable kinetic energy in the process. When the original ions are cold the\nreaction produces neutrals that can be trapped or further manipulated with\nelectromagnetic fields. Because a wide range of species can be targeted we\nenvisage that our scheme may enable experiments at low temperature that have\nbeen hitherto intractable due to a lack of cooling methods. We present an\nestimate for achievable temperatures, neutral number and density in an\nexperiment where the neutrals are formed at a milli-Kelvin temperature from\neither directly or sympathetically cooled ions confined on an ion chip. The\nneutrals may then be confined by their magnetic moment in a co-located magnetic\nminimum well also formed on the chip. We discuss general experimental\nrequirements.\n", "  We model changes of magnetic ordering in Mn-antiperovskite nitrides driven by\nbiaxial lattice strain at zero and at finite temperature. We employ a\nnon-collinear spin-polarised density functional theory to compare the response\nof the geometrically frustrated exchange interactions to a tetragonal symmetry\nbreaking (the so called piezomagnetic effect) across a range of Mn$_3$AN (A =\nRh, Pd, Ag, Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, In, Sn) at zero temperature. Building on the\nrobustness of the effect we focus on Mn$_3$GaN and extend our study to finite\ntemperature using the disordered local moment (DLM) first-principles electronic\nstructure theory to model the interplay between the ordering of Mn magnetic\nmoments and itinerant electron states. We discover a rich temperature-strain\nmagnetic phase diagram with two previously unreported phases stabilised by\nstrains larger than 0.75\\% and with transition temperatures strongly dependent\non strain. We propose an elastocaloric cooling cycle crossing two of the\navailable phase transitions to achieve simultaneously a large isothermal\nentropy change (due to the first order transition) and a large adiabatic\ntemperature change (due to the second order transition).\n", "  Al$^+$ ions optical clock is a very promising optical frequency standard\ncandidate due to its extremely small blackbody radiation shift. It has been\nsuccessfully demonstrated with indirect cooled, quantum-logic-based\nspectroscopy technique. Its accuracy is limited by second-order Doppler shift,\nand its stability is limited by the number of ions that can be probed in\nquantum logic processing. We propose a direct laser cooling scheme of Al$^+$\nions optical clocks where both the stability and accuracy of the clocks are\ngreatly improved. In the proposed scheme, two Al$^+$ ions traps are utilized.\nThe first trap is used to trap a large number of Al$^+$ ions to improve the\nstability of the clock laser, while the second trap is used to trap a single\nAl$^+$ ions to provide the ultimate accuracy. Both traps are cooled with a\ncontinuous wave 167 nm laser. The expected clock laser stability can reach\n$9.0\\times10^{-17}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$. For the second trap, in addition to 167 nm\nlaser Doppler cooling, a second stage pulsed 234 nm two-photon cooling laser is\nutilized to further improve the accuracy of the clock laser. The total\nsystematic uncertainty can be reduced to about $1\\times10^{-18}$. The proposed\nAl$^+$ ions optical clock has the potential to become the most accurate and\nstable optical clock.\n", "  Cosmic backreaction refers to the general question of whether a homogeneous\nand isotropic cosmological model is able to predict the correct expansion\ndynamics of our inhomogeneous Universe. One aspect of this issue concerns the\nvalidity of the continuous approximation: does a system of point masses expand\nthe same way as a fluid does? This article shows that it is not exactly the\ncase in Newtonian gravity, although the associated corrections vanish in an\ninfinite Universe. It turns out that Gauss's law is a key ingredient for such\ncorrections to vanish. Backreaction, therefore, generically arises in\nalternative theories of gravitation, which threatens the trustworthiness of\ntheir cosmological tests. This phenomenon is illustrated with a toy model of\nmassive gravity.\n", "  A thin liquid film coating a planar horizontal substrate may be unstable to\nperturbations in the film thickness due to unfavourable intermolecular\ninteractions between the liquid and the substrate, which may lead to\nfinite-time rupture. The self-similar nature of the rupture has been studied\nbefore by utilizing the standard lubrication approximation along with the\nDerjaguin (or disjoining) pressure formalism used to account for the\nintermolecular interactions, and a particular form of the disjoining pressure\nwith exponent $n=3$ has been used, namely, $\\Pi(h)\\propto -1/h^{3}$, where $h$\nis the film thickness. In the present study, we use a numerical continuation\nmethod to compute discrete solutions to self-similar rupture for a general\ndisjoining pressure exponent $n$. We focus on axisymmetric point-rupture\nsolutions and show that pairs of solution branches merge as $n$ decreases,\nleading to a critical value $n_c \\approx 1.485$ below which stable similarity\nsolutions do not appear to exist. We verify that this observation also holds\ntrue for plane-symmetric line-rupture solutions for which the critical value\nturns out to be slightly larger than for the axisymmetric case,\n$n_c^{\\mathrm{plane}}\\approx 1.5$. Computation of the full time-dependent\nproblem also demonstrates the loss of stable similarity solutions and the\nsubsequent onset of cascading oscillatory structures.\n", "  We study the time evolution of a half-filled Hubbard layer coupled to a\nmagnon bath after a quench of the Hubbard interaction. Qualitatively different\nregimes, regarding the asymptotic long-time dynamics, are identified and\ncharacterized within the mean-field approximation. In the absence of the bath,\nthe dynamics of the closed system is similar to that of a quenched BCS\ncondensate. Though the presence of the bath introduces an additional relaxation\nmechanism, our numerical results and analytical arguments show that\nequilibration with the bath is not necessarily attained within the\napproximations used. Instead, nonequilibrium states, similar to the ones\nobserved in the closed system, can emerge at long times as a consequence of the\ncompetition between the intrinsic relaxation mechanism (Landau damping, for\nexample), and the bath-induced dissipation.\n", "  In a recent letter [J. -H. Choi et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 066403 (2015)],\na universal linear relation between the binding energy Eb of exciton and the\nband gap Eg is found in different quasi-2D semiconductors. However, when one\nextrapolates the straight line to Eg=0, a positive Eb is obtained. This means\nthat a stable exciton exists in a metal (Eg=0), or in other words, the\nexcitation energy is negative. Therefore, for quasi-2D semiconductors with\nsmall band gap, Eb vs. Eg must deviate from the straight line suggested in the\nLetter.\n  We performed similar GW+BSE calculation as the Letter for compressed\nphosphorene and stretched graphene. At larger band gap, our data fall in the\nsame straight lien as the Letter. But for the quasi-2D semiconductors with\nsmall band gap, the Eb vs. Eg curve approaches to zero. A simple model based on\nlocal instantaneous screened interaction gives reasonable agreement with the\nmore rigorous calculations. For the quasi-2D semiconductors with diminishing\ngap Eg<0.3eV, due to the nonlocal retarded effect induced by the strong\nscreening in the small gap materials, one has to use 2-time transition\namplitude (Bethe-Salpeter wave function) to describe exciton.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a simple and modern discussion of rotational\nsuperradiance based on quantum field theory. We work with an effective theory\nvalid at scales much larger than the size of the spinning object responsible\nfor superradiance. Within this framework, the probability of absorption by an\nobject at rest completely determines the superradiant amplification rate when\nthat same object is spinning. We first discuss in detail superradiant\nscattering of spin 0 particles with orbital angular momentum $\\ell=1$, and then\nextend our analysis to higher values of orbital angular momentum and spin.\nAlong the way, we provide a simple derivation of vacuum friction---a \"quantum\ntorque\" acting on spinning objects in empty space. Our results apply not only\nto black holes but to arbitrary spinning objects. We also discuss superradiant\ninstability due to formation of bound states and, as an illustration, we\ncalculate the instability rate $\\Gamma$ for bound states with massive spin 1\nparticles. For a black hole with mass $M$ and angular velocity $\\Omega$, we\nfind $\\Gamma \\sim (G M \\mu)^7 \\Omega$ when the particle's Compton wavelength\n$1/\\mu$ is much greater than the size $GM$ of the spinning object. This rate is\nparametrically much larger than the instability rate for spin 0 particles,\nwhich scales like $(GM \\mu)^9 \\Omega$. This enhanced instability rate can be\nused to constrain the existence of ultralight particles beyond the Standard\nModel.\n", "  Detection and classification of transients in data from gravitational wave\ndetectors are crucial for efficient searches for true astrophysical events and\nidentification of noise sources. We present a hybrid method for classification\nof short duration transients seen in gravitational wave data using both\nsupervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. To train the\nclassifiers we use the relative wavelet energy and the corresponding entropy\nobtained by applying one-dimensional wavelet decomposition on the data. The\nprediction accuracy of the trained classifier on 9 simulated classes of\ngravitational wave transients and also LIGO's sixth science run hardware\ninjections are reported. Targeted searches for a couple of known classes of\nnon-astrophysical signals in the first observational run of Advanced LIGO data\nare also presented. The ability to accurately identify transient classes using\nminimal training samples makes the proposed method a useful tool for LIGO\ndetector characterization as well as searches for short duration gravitational\nwave signals.\n", "  We utilize the dynamical renormalization group formalism to calculate the\nreal space trajectory of a compact binary inspiral for long times via a\nsystematic resummation of secularly growing terms. This method generates closed\nform solutions without orbit averaging, and the accuracy can be systematically\nimproved. The expansion parameter is $v^5 \\nu \\Omega(t-t_0)$ where $t_0$ is the\ninitial time, $t$ is the time elapsed, and $\\Omega$ and $v$ are the angular\norbital frequency and initial speed, respectively, and $\\nu$ is the binary's\nsymmetric mass ratio. We demonstrate how to apply the renormalization group\nmethod to resum solutions beyond leading order in two ways. First, we calculate\nthe second order corrections of the leading radiation reaction force, which\ninvolves highly non-trivial checks of the formalism (i.e. its\nrenormalizability). Second, we show how to systematically include\npost-Newtonian corrections to the radiation reaction force. By avoiding orbit\naveraging we gain predictive power and eliminate ambiguities in the initial\nconditions. Finally, we discuss how this methodology can be used to find\nanalytic solutions to the spin equations of motion that are valid over long\ntimes.\n", "  Our polycrystalline sample study on the Yb-based chalcogenide spinels\n$A$Yb$_2$$X_4$ ($A =$ Cd, Mg, $X =$ S, Se) has revealed frustrated magnetism\ndue to the antiferromagnetically coupled Heisenberg spin on the pyrochlore\nlattice. Our crystal electric field analysis indicates the Yb ground state has\nnearly Heisenberg spins with a strong quantum character of the ground doublet.\nAll the materials exhibit an antiferromagnetic order at 1.4-1.8 K, much lower\ntemperature than the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling scale of $\\sim 10$ K.\nThe magnetic specific heat $C_{\\rm M}$ shows a $T^{3}$ dependence, indicating\nthe gapless feature in the Yb-based chalcogenide spinels. The magnetic entropy\nchange much smaller than $R$ ln 2 below the N\\'{e}el temperature and the small\nlocal magnetic field estimated from the $\\mu$SR measurements strongly suggest\nthe significantly reduced size of the ordered moment in comparison with the\nbare moment size 1.33 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Yb supporting strong fluctuations in the\ncommensurate and incommensurate ordered states in CdYb$_2$S$_4$ and\nMgYb$_2$S$_4$, respectively.\n", "  We study how an inversion-breaking quantum critical point affects the ground\nstate of a one-dimensional electronic liquid with repulsive interaction and\nspin-orbit coupling. We find that regardless of the interaction strength, the\ncritical fluctuations always lead to a gap in the electronic spin-sector. The\norigin of the gap is a two-particle backscattering process, which becomes\nrelevant due to renormalization of the Luttinger parameter near the critical\npoint. The resulting spin-gapped state is a one-dimensional version of spin\ntriplet superconductivity. Interestingly, in the case of a ferromagnetic\ncritical point the Luttinger parameter is renormalized in the opposite manner,\nsuch that the system remains non-superconducting.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap of simple barrier\ntunneling problems, which are related to using quantum annealing to find the\nglobal optimum of cost functions defined over n bits. Specifically we look at\nthe problem of having an n qubit system tunnel through a barrier of width and\nheight proportional to n^a. We show that with these quantum annealing problems,\nthe asymptotic, $n\\to\\infty$, behavior of the spectral gap does not accurately\ndescribe the behavior of the gap at finite n until extremely large values of n\n(n>10^{12}). We prove that this deficiency of the asymptotic expression is a\nfeature of simple one-dimensional tunneling problems themselves, casting doubt\non whether asymptotic analysis is an appropriate tool for studying tunneling\nproblems in quantum annealing for reasonably sized systems.\n", "  A detailed microstructural investigation was performed to understand\nstructural characteristics of a reaction-bonded B$_4$C/SiC ceramic composite.\nThe state-of-the-art focused ion beam & scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM)\nand transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the as-fabricated\nproduct consisted of core-rim structures with {\\alpha}-SiC and $B_4$C cores\nsurrounded by \\beta-SiC and $B_4$C, respectively. In addition, plate-like\n\\beta-SiC was detected within the $B_4$C rim. A phase formation mechanism was\nproposed and the analytical elucidation is anticipated to shed light on\npotential fabrication optimization and the property improvement of ceramic\ncomposites.\n", "  Quantum communication provides an absolute security advantage, and it has\nbeen widely developed over the past 30 years. As an important branch of quantum\ncommunication, quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) promotes high\nsecurity and instantaneousness in communication through directly transmitting\nmessages over a quantum channel. The full implementation of a quantum protocol\nalways requires the ability to control the transfer of a message effectively in\nthe time domain; thus, it is essential to combine QSDC with quantum memory to\naccomplish the communication task. In this paper, we report the experimental\ndemonstration of QSDC with state-of-the-art atomic quantum memory for the first\ntime in principle. We used the polarization degrees of freedom of photons as\nthe information carrier, and the fidelity of entanglement decoding was verified\nas approximately 90%. Our work completes a fundamental step toward practical\nQSDC and demonstrates a potential application for long-distance quantum\ncommunication in a quantum network.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional electron gas with strong spin-orbit coupling\ncontacted by two superconducting leads, forming a Josephson junction. We show\nthat in the presence of an in-plane Zeeman field the quasi-one-dimensional\nregion between the two superconductors can support a topological\nsuperconducting phase hosting Majorana bound states at its ends. We study the\nphase diagram of the system as a function of the Zeeman field and the phase\ndifference between the two superconductors (treated as an externally controlled\nparameter). Remarkably, at a phase difference of $\\pi$, the topological phase\nis obtained for almost any value of the Zeeman field and chemical potential. In\na setup where the phase is not controlled externally, we find that the system\nundergoes a first-order topological phase transition when the Zeeman field is\nvaried. At the transition, the phase difference in the ground state changes\nabruptly from a value close to zero, at which the system is trivial, to a value\nclose to $\\pi$, at which the system is topological. The critical current\nthrough the junction exhibits a sharp minimum at the critical Zeeman field, and\nis therefore a natural diagnostic of the transition. We point out that in\npresence of a symmetry under a modified mirror reflection followed by time\nreversal, the system belongs to a higher symmetry class and the phase diagram\nas a function of the phase difference and the Zeeman field becomes richer.\n", "  Upon cooling, glass-forming liquids experience a two-step relaxation\nassociated to the cage rattling and the escape from the cage, and the following\ndecoupling between the \\b{eta}- and the {\\alpha}-relaxations. The found\ndecoupling behaviors have greatly changed the face of glassy physics and\nmaterials studies. Here we report a novel dynamic decoupling that the\nrelaxation function changes gradually from a single-step to a two-step form as\ntemperature declines through the stress relaxation of various metallic glasses\nin a broad time and temperature range below glass transition temperature (Tg).\nSuch a two-step relaxation is unexpected in glassy state and reveals a\ndecoupling of dynamic modes arising from two different mechanisms: a faster one\nexhibiting ballistic-like feature, and a slower one associated with a broader\ndistribution of relaxation times typical of subdiffusive atomic motion. This\nfirst observation of two-step dynamics in metallic glassy state points to a far\nricher-than-expected scenario for glass relaxation.\n", "  We demonstrate that the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature-polarization cross-correlation provides accurate and robust\nconstraints on cosmological parameters. We compare them with the results from\ntemperature or polarization and investigate the impact of foregrounds, cosmic\nvariance, and instrumental noise. This analysis makes use of the Planck\nhigh-multipole HiLLiPOP likelihood based on angular power spectra, which takes\ninto account systematics from the instrument and foreground residuals directly\nmodelled using Planck measurements. The temperature-polarization correlation\n(TE) spectrum is less contaminated by astrophysical emissions than the\ntemperature power spectrum (TT), allowing constraints that are less sensitive\nto foreground uncertainties to be derived. For {\\Lambda}CDM parameters, TE\ngives very competitive results compared to TT. For basic {\\Lambda}CDM model\nextensions (such as AL, {\\Sigma}m{\\nu}, or Neff ), it is still limited by the\ninstrumental noise level in the polarization maps.\n", "  In order to improve the hydrogen storage properties of calcium hydride\n(CaH2), we have tuned its thermodynamical properties through fluorination.\nUsing ab-initio total energy calculations based on density functional theory,\nthe structural stability, electronic structure and chemical bonding of CaH2-xFx\nsystems are investigated. The phase transition of fluorinated systems from\northorhombic to cubic structure has been observed at 18% fluorine doped CaH2.\nThe phase stability analysis shows that CaH2-xFx systems are highly stable and\nthe stability is directly correlating with their ionicity. Density of states\n(DOS) plot reveals that CaH2-xFx systems are insulators. Partial DOS and charge\ndensity analyses conclude that these systems are governed by ionic bonding. Our\nresults show that H closer to F can be removed more easily than that far away\nfrom F and this is due to disproportionation induced in the bonding interaction\nby fluorination.\n", "  We present results from ab initio calculations based on density functional\ntheory for bismuth-based double perovskite Bi2MnTiO6. Using total energy\ncalculation with stress and force minimization we have predicted the\nequilibrium crystal structure for Bi2MnTiO6 considering potential structures\ninto the calculation. We have predicted that the ground state of Bi2MnTiO6 will\nbe a noncentrosymmetric rhombohedral structure with space group R3c. Our spin\npolarized calculation for different possible collinear magnetic configurations\nwe found that Bi2MnTiO6 will be an insulator with G-type antiferromagnetic\nordering in its ground state. The coexistence of both stereochemically active\nBi-6s lone pair and the Ti4+ with d0-ness which bring covalency results in the\nstabilization of noncentrosymmetric structure and thus ferroelectricity. Our\norbital projected density of states plot shows that the Mn2+ in Bi2MnTiO6 will\nbe at high spin state with a spin moment of 4.28 {\\mu}B. Hence Bi2MnTiO6 is\npredicted to be a magnetoelectric material.\n", "  Functional renormalisation group approach is applied to a system of kaons\nwith finite chemical potential. A set of approximate flow equations for the\neffective couplings is derived and solved. At high scale the system is found to\nbe at the normal phase whereas at some critical value of the running scale it\nundergoes the phase transition (PT) to the phase with a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry with the kaon condensate as an order parameter. The value of the\ncondensate turns out to be quite sensitive to the kaon-kaon scattering length.\n", "  Cosmic dusts are mostly responsible for polarization of the light that we ob-\nserve from astrophysical objects. They also lead to color-extinction, thermal\nre- emission and other scattering related phenomena. Dusts are made of small\nparticles which are characterised by their size (radius), composition (matter),\nand structure (morphology, including porosity). In the present work, we address\nthe question of the role of the dust particle porosity on light polarization\nand color, using Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) light scattering code. To\nanswer this question, we developed an algorithm to generate solid particles of\narbitrary values of porosity. In brief, the model considers a given homogeneous\nstructure made of touching dipoles. The dipoles are randomly removed one by\none, such that the remaining structure remains connected. We stop the removal\nprocess when the desired poros- ity is obtained. Then we study the optical\nproperties of the porous particle. That way, we show how the proper value of\nthe porosity affects the polarization and color of the light scattered by these\nporous particles. In addition to polarization, porosity has important effects\non photometric color. Considering an important application, we emphasize the\npossible role of the porosity of the cometary dust particles on polarization\nand color of the light scattered by cometary coma.\n", "  Spin-transfer torques in a nanocontact to an extended magnetic film can\ncreate spin waves that condense to form dissipative droplet solitons. Here we\nreport an experimental study of the temperature dependence of the current and\napplied field thresholds for droplet soliton formation, as well as the\nnanocontact's electrical characteristics associated with droplet dynamics.\nNucleation of droplet solitons requires higher current densities at higher\ntemperatures, in contrast to typical spin-transfer torque induced switching\nbetween static magnetic states. Magnetoresistance and electrical noise\nmeasurements show that soliton instabilities become more pronounced with\nincreasing temperature. These results are of fundamental interest in\nunderstanding the influence of thermal noise on droplet solitons, and in\ncontrolling their dynamics.\n", "  We revisit the computation of instanton effects to various correlation\nfunctions in ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM and clarify a controversy existing in the\nliterature regarding their consistency with the OPE and conformal symmetry. To\ncheck these properties, we examine the conformal partial wave decomposition of\nfour-point correlators involving combinations of half-BPS and Konishi operators\nand isolate the contribution from the conformal primary scalar operators of\ntwist four. We demonstrate that the leading instanton correction to this\ncontribution is indeed consistent with conformal symmetry and compute the\ncorresponding corrections to the OPE coefficients and the scaling dimensions of\nsuch twist-four operators. Our analysis justifies the regularization procedure\nused to compute ultraviolet divergent instanton contribution to correlation\nfunctions involving unprotected operators.\n", "  We propose a realization of a quantum heat engine in a hybrid\nmicrowave-optomechanical system that is the analog of a classical straight-twin\nengine. It exploits a pair of polariton modes that operate as out-of-phase\nquantum Otto cycles. A third polariton mode that is essential in the coupling\nof the optical and microwave fields is maintained in a quasi-dark mode to\nsuppress disturbances from the mechanical noise. We also find that the\nfluctuations in the contributions to the total work from the two polariton\nmodes are characterized by quantum correlations that generally lead to a\nreduction in the extractable work compared to its classical version.\n", "  We study the behavior of Fisher Zeros (FZs) and dynamical quantum phase\ntransitions (DQPTs) for a linearly ramped Haldane model occurring in the\nsubsequent temporal evolution of the same and probe the intimate connection\nwith the equilibrium topology of the model}. Here, we investigate the temporal\nevolution of the final state of the Haldane Hamiltonian (evolving with\ntime-independent final Hamiltonian) reached following a linear ramping of the\nstaggered (Semenoff) mass term from an initial to a final value, {first\nselecting a specific protocol}, so chosen that the system is ramped from one\nnon-topological phase to the other through a topological phase. {We establish\nthe existence of three possible behaviour of areas of FZs corresponding to a\ngiven sector: (i) no-DQPT, (ii) one-DQPT (intermediate) and (iii)two-DQPTs\n(re-entrant), depending on the inverse quenching rate $\\tau$. Our study also\nreveals that the appearance of the areas of FZs is an artefact of the non-zero\n(quasi-momentum dependent) Haldane mass ($M_H$), whose absence leads to an\nemergent one-dimensional behaviour indicated by the shrinking of the areas FZs\nto lines and the non-analyticity in the dynamical \"free energy\" itself.\nMoreover, the characteristic rates of crossover between the three behaviour of\nFZs are determined by the time-reversal invariant quasi-momentum points of the\nBrillouin zone where $M_H$ vanishes. Thus, we observe that through the presence\nor absence of $M_H$, there exists an intimate relation to the topological\nproperties of the equilibrium model even when the ramp drives the system far\naway from equilibrium.\n", "  The mechanical and electrical response of acoustophoretic microfluidic\ndevices attached to an ac-voltage-driven piezoelectric transducer is studied by\nmeans of numerical simulations. The governing equations are formulated in a\nvariational framework that, introducing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities,\nis used to derive the weak form for the finite element discretization of the\nequations and to characterize the device response in terms of\nfrequency-dependent figures of merit or indicators. The effectiveness of the\ndevice in focusing microparticles is quantified by two mechanical indicators:\nthe average direction of the pressure gradient and the amount of acoustic\nenergy localized in the microchannel. Further, we derive the relations between\nthe Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian and three electrical indicators: the resonance\nQ-value, the impedance and the electric power. The frequency response of the\nhard-to-measure mechanical indicators is correlated to that of the\neasy-to-measure electrical indicators, and by introducing optimality criteria,\nit is clarified to which extent the latter suffices to identify optimal driving\nfrequencies as the geometric configuration and the material parameters vary.\n", "  We study the possibility of reconstructing the quantum state of light in a\ncavity subject to dissipation. We pass atoms, also subject to decay, through\nthe cavity and surprisingly show that both decays allow the measurement of\n$s$-parametrized quasiprobability distributions. In fact, if we consider only\natomic decay, we show that the Wigner function may be reconstructed. Because\nthese distributions contain whole information of the initial field state, it is\npossible to recover information after both atomic and field decays occur.\n", "  Closed formulae for upper bound on three tangles of three-qubit reduced\nstates in terms of three-qubit invariant polynomials of pure four-qubit states\nare obtained. Our results offer tighter constraints on total three-way\nentanglement of a given qubit with the rest of the system than those used in\nref. [PRL 113, 110501 (2014), PRL 116, 049902(E) (2016)] to verify monogamy of\nfour-qubit quantum entanglement.\n", "  Organic microcavities are photonic nanostructures that strongly confine the\nelectromagnetic field, allowing exotic quantum regimes of light-matter\ninteraction with disordered organic semiconductors. The unambiguous\ninterpretation of the spectra of organic microcavities has been a long-standing\nchallenge due to several competing effects involving electrons, vibrations and\ncavity photons. Here we present a theoretical framework that is able to\ndescribe the main spectroscopic features of organic microcavities consistently.\nWe introduce a class of light-matter excitations called dark vibronic\npolaritons, which strongly emit but only weakly absorb light in the same\nfrequency region of the bare electronic transition. Successful comparison with\nexperimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory. The proposed\nmicroscopic understanding of organic microcavities paves the way for the\ndevelopment of optoelectronic devices enhanced by quantum optics.\n", "  We establish a statistical relationship between the inverse energy cascade\nand the spatial correlations of clustered vortices in two-dimensional quantum\nturbulence. The Kolmogorov spectrum $k^{-5/3}$ on inertial scales $r$\ncorresponds to a pair correlation function between the vortices with different\nsigns that decays as a power law with the pair distance given as $r^{-4/3}$. To\ntest these scaling relations, we propose a novel forced and dissipative point\nvortex model that captures the turbulent dynamics of quantized vortices by the\nemergent clustering of same-sign vortices. The inverse energy cascade\ndeveloping in a statistically neutral system originates from this vortex\nclustering that evolves with time.\n", "  Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can provide\ninformation about the masses, spins, and structure of neutron stars. However,\nthis requires accurate and computationally efficient waveform models that take\n<1s to evaluate for use in Bayesian parameter estimation codes that perform\n10^7 - 10^8 waveform evaluations. We present a surrogate model of a nonspinning\neffective-one-body waveform model with l = 2, 3, and 4 tidal multipole moments\nthat reproduces waveforms of binary neutron star numerical simulations up to\nmerger. The surrogate is built from compact sets of effective-one-body waveform\namplitude and phase data that each form a reduced basis. We find that 12\namplitude and 7 phase basis elements are sufficient to reconstruct any binary\nneutron star waveform with a starting frequency of 10Hz. The surrogate has\nmaximum errors of 3.8% in amplitude (0.04% excluding the last 100M before\nmerger) and 0.043 radians in phase. The version implemented in the LIGO\nAlgorithm Library takes ~0.07s to evaluate for a starting frequency of 30Hz and\n~0.8s for a starting frequency of 10Hz, resulting in a speed-up factor of ~10^3\n- 10^4 relative to the original Matlab code. This allows parameter estimation\ncodes to run in days to weeks rather than years, and we demonstrate this with a\nNested Sampling run that recovers the masses and tidal parameters of a\nsimulated binary neutron star system.\n", "  We propose a description of the Higgs boson as top-antitop quark bound state\nwithin a nonlocal relativistic quark model of Nambu - Jona-Lasinio type. In\ncontrast to model with local four-fermion interaction, the mass of the scalar\nbound state can be lighter than the sum of its constituents. This is achieved\nby adjusting the interaction range and the value of the coupling constant to\nexperimental data, for both the top quark mass and the scalar Higgs boson mass,\nwhich can simultaneously be described.\n", "  We investigate the effects of coupling between the two zigzag edges of\ngraphene nanoribbons on the Wigner crystallization of electrons and holes using\na combination of tight-binding, mean field Hubbard and many-body configuration\ninteraction methods. We show that the thickness of the nanoribbon plays a\ncrucial role in the formation of Wigner crystal. For ribbon widths smaller than\n16 \\mbox{\\AA}, increased kinetic energy overcomes the long-range Coulomb\nrepulsion and suppresses the Wigner crystallization. For wider ribbons up to 38\n\\mbox{\\AA} wide, strong Wigner localization is observed for even number of\nelectrons, revealing an even-odd effect also found in Coulomb blockade addition\nspectrum. Interedge correlations are found to be strong enough to allow\nsimultaneous crystallization on both edges, although an applied electric field\ncan decouple the two edges. Finally, we show that Wigner crystallization can\nalso occurs for holes, albeit weaker than for electrons.\n", "  We study the leptonic decay of charged pions in a compact star environment.\nConsidering leptons as a degenerated Fermi system, pions are tightly\nconstrained to decay into these particles because their Fermi levels are\noccupied. Thus, pion decay is only possible through thermal fluctuations. Under\nthese circumstances, pion lifetime is larger and hence can be considered to\nreach a metastable state. We explore restrictions under which such a\nmetastability is possible. We also study conditions under which pions and\nleptons already in chemical equilibrium can reach simultaneously the thermal\nequilibrium, and obtain the neutrino emissivity from metastable pions.\nScenarios that favor this metastable state are protoneutron stars.\n", "  Dirac fermions are actively investigated, and the discovery of the quantized\nanomalous Hall effect of massive Dirac fermions has spurred the promise of\nlow-energy electronics. Some materials hosting Dirac fermions are natural\nplatforms for interlayer coherence effects such as Coulomb drag and exciton\ncondensation. Here we determine the role played by the anomalous Hall effect in\nCoulomb drag in massive Dirac fermion systems. We focus on topological\ninsulator films with out-of plane magnetizations in both the active and passive\nlayers. The transverse response of the active layer is dominated by a\ntopological term arising from the Berry curvature. We show that the topological\nmechanism does not contribute to Coulomb drag, yet the longitudinal drag force\nin the passive layer gives rise to a transverse drag current. This anomalous\nHall drag current is independent of the active-layer magnetization, a fact that\ncan be verified experimentally. It depends non-monotonically on the\npassive-layer magnetization, exhibiting a peak that becomes more pronounced at\nlow densities. These findings should stimulate new experiments and quantitative\nstudies of anomalous Hall drag.\n", "  We consider the prescription dependence of the Higgs effective potential\nunder the presence of general nonminimal couplings. We evaluate the fermion\nloop correction to the effective action in a simplified Higgs-Yukawa model\nwhose path integral measure takes simple form either in the Jordan or Einstein\nframe. The resultant effective action becomes identical in both cases when we\nproperly take into account the quartically divergent term coming from the\nchange of measure. Working in the counterterm formalism, we clarify that the\ndifference between the prescriptions I and II comes from the counter term to\ncancel the logarithmic divergence. This difference can be absorbed into the\nchoice of tree-level potential from the infinitely many possibilities,\nincluding all the higher-dimensional terms. We also present another mechanism\nto obtain a flat potential by freezing the running of the effective quartic\ncoupling for large field values, using the nonminimal coupling in the gauge\nkinetic function.\n", "  Here we study the pattern of neutrino oscillations emerging from a previously\nproposed warped model construction incorporating $\\Delta(27)$ flavor symmetry.\nIn addition to a complete description of fermion masses, the model predicts the\nlepton mixing matrix in terms of two parameters. The good measurement of\n$\\theta_{13}$ makes these two parameters nearly proportional, leading to an\napproximate one-parameter description of neutrino oscillations. There is a\nsharp fourfold degenerate correlation between $\\delta_{CP}$ and the atmospheric\nmixing angle $\\theta_{23}$, so that maximal $\\theta_{23}$ also implies maximal\nleptonic CP violation. The predicted electron neutrino and anti-neutrino\nappearance probabilities indicate that the model should be tested at the T2K,\nNO$\\nu$A and DUNE long baseline oscillation experiments.\n", "  We show that harmonic driving of either the magnitude or the phase of the\nnearest-neighbor hopping amplitude in a p-wave superconducting wire can\ngenerate modes localized near the ends of the wire. The Floquet eigenvalues of\nthese modes can either be equal to $\\pm 1$ (which is known to occur in other\nmodels) or can lie near other values in complex conjugate pairs which is\nunusual; we call the latter anomalous end modes. All the end modes have equal\nprobabilities of particles and holes. If the amplitude of driving is small, we\nobserve an interesting bulk-boundary correspondence: the Floquet eigenvalues\nand the peaks of the Fourier transform of the end modes lie close to the\nFloquet eigenvalues and momenta at which the Floquet eigenvalues of the bulk\nsystem have extrema.\n", "  How fast can a laser pulse ionize an atom? We address this question by\nconsidering pulses that carry a fixed time-integrated energy per-area, and\nfinding those that achieve the double requirement of maximizing the ionization\nthat they induce, while having the shortest duration. We formulate this\ndouble-objective quantum optimal control problem by making use of the Pareto\napproach to multi-objetive optimization, and the differential evolution genetic\nalgorithm. The goal is to find out how much a precise time-profiling of\nultra-fast, large-bandwidth pulses may speed up the ionization process with\nrespect to simple-shape pulses. We work on a simple one-dimensional model of\nhydrogen-like atoms (the P\\\"oschl-Teller potential), that allows to tune the\nnumber of bound states that play a role in the ionization dynamics. We show how\nthe detailed shape of the pulse accelerates the ionization process, and how the\npresence or absence of bound states influences the velocity of the process.\n", "  In the past decade, network structures have penetrated nearly every aspect of\nour lives. The detection of anomalous vertices in these networks has become\nincreasingly important, such as in exposing computer network intruders or\nidentifying fake online reviews. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised\ntwo-layered meta-classifier that can detect irregular vertices in complex\nnetworks solely by using features extracted from the network topology.\nFollowing the reasoning that a vertex with many improbable links has a higher\nlikelihood of being anomalous,we employed our method on 10 networks of various\nscales, from a network of several dozen students to online social networks with\nmillions of users. In every scenario, we were able to identify anomalous\nvertices with lower false positive rates and higher AUCs compared to other\nprevalent methods. Moreover, we demonstrated that the presented algorithm is\nefficient both in revealing fake users and in disclosing the most influential\npeople in social networks.\n", "  We present comprehensive numerical studies of the motion of a buoyant or a\nnearly neutrally buoyant nano-sized ellipsoidal particle in a fluid filled\ncylindrical tube without or with the presence of imposed pressure gradient\n(weak Poiseuille flow). The Fluctuating hydrodynamics approach and the\nDeterministic method are both employed. We ensure that the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation and the principle of thermal equipartition of\nenergy are both satisfied. The major focus is on the effect of the confining\nboundary. Results for the velocity and angular velocity autocorrelations (VACF\nand AVACF), diffusivities, and drag and lift forces as functions of shape,\naspect ratio, inclination angle, and proximity to the wall are presented. For\nthe parameters considered, the boundary modifies the VACF and AVACF such that\nthree distinct regimes are discernible --- an initial exponential decay,\nfollowed by an algebraic decay culminating in a second exponential decay. The\nfirst is due to thermal noise, the algebraic regime is due to both thermal\nnoise and hydrodynamic correlations, while the second exponential decay shows\nthe effect of momentum reflection from the confining wall. Our predictions\ndisplay excellent comparison with published results for the algebraic regime\n(the only regime for which earlier results exist). We also discuss the role of\noff-diagonal elements of the mobility and diffusivity tensor that enables the\nquantification of the degree of lift and margination of the NC in the vessel.\nOur study covers a range of parameters that are of wide applicability in\nnanotechnology and in targeted drug delivery related to the health sciences.\n", "  Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a symmetry transforming bosons to fermions and vice\nversa. Indications of its existence have been extensively sought after in\nhigh-energy experiments. However, signatures of SUSY have yet to be detected.\nIn this manuscript we propose a condensed matter realization of SUSY on the\nedge of a Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state, given by filling factors of the form\n$\\nu =\\frac{k}{k+2}$, where $k$ is an integer. As we show, this strongly\ninteracting state exhibits an $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY. This allows us to use a\ntopological invariant - the Witten index - defined specifically for\nsupersymmetric theories, to count the difference between the number of bosonic\nand fermionic zero-modes in a circular edge. In our system, we argue that the\nedge hosts $k+1$ protected zero-modes. We further discuss the stability of SUSY\nwith respect to generic perturbations, and find that much of the above results\nremain unchanged. In particular, these results directly apply to the\nwell-established $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state, in which case SUSY is a highly\nrobust property of the edge theory. These results unveil a hidden topological\nstructure on the long-studied Read-Rezayi states.\n", "  We study Tan's contact, i.e. the coefficient of the high-momentum tails of\nthe momentum distribution at leading order, for an interacting one-dimensional\nBose gas subjected to a harmonic confinement. Using a strong-coupling\nsystematic expansion of the ground-state energy of the homogeneous system\nstemming from the Bethe-Ansatz solution, together with the local-density\napproximation, we obtain the strong-coupling expansion for Tan's contact of the\nharmonically trapped gas. Also, we use a very accurate conjecture for the\nground-state energy of the homogeneous system to obtain an approximate\nexpression for Tan's contact for arbitrary interaction strength, thus\nestimating the accuracy of the strong-coupling expansion. Our results are\nrelevant for ongoing experiments with ultracold atomic gases.\n", "  We present the \"trimon\", a multi-mode superconducting circuit implementing\nthree qubits with all-to-all longitudinal coupling. This always-on interaction\nenables simple implementation of generalized controlled-NOT gates which form a\nuniversal set. Further, two of the three qubits are protected against Purcell\ndecay while retaining measurability. We demonstrate high-fidelity state\nswapping operations between two qubits and characterize the coupling of all\nthree qubits to a neighbouring transmon qubit. Our results offer a new paradigm\nfor multi-qubit architecture with applications in quantum error correction,\nquantum simulations and quantum annealing.\n", "  This paper derives a set of easy-to-use tools designed to simplify\ncalculations with birdtrack op- erators comprised of symmetrizers and\nantisymmetrizers. In particular, we present cancellation rules allowing one to\nshorten the birdtrack expressions of operators, and propagation rules\nidentifying the circumstances under which it is possible to propagate\nsymmetrizers past antisymmetrizers and vice versa. We exhibit the power of\nthese simplification rules by means of a short example in which we apply the\ntools derived in this paper on a typical operator that can be encountered in\nthe representation theory of SU(N) over the product space $V^{\\otimes m}$ .\nThese rules form the basis for the construction of compact Hermitian Young\nprojection operators and their transition operators addressed in companion\npapers.\n", "  In this paper, we give a generic algorithm of the transition operators\nbetween Hermitian Young projection operators corresponding to equivalent\nirreducible representations of SU(N), using the compact expressions of\nHermitian Young projection operators derived in a companion paper. We show that\nthe Hermitian Young projection operators together with their transition\noperators constitute a fully orthogonal basis for the algebra of invariants of\n$V^{\\otimes m}$ that exhibits a systematically simplified multiplication table.\nWe discuss the full algebra of invariants over $V^{\\otimes 3}$ and $V^{\\otimes\n4}$ as explicit examples. In our presentation we make use of various standard\nconcepts such as Young projection operators, Clebsch-Gordan operators, and\ninvariants (in birdtrack notation). We tie these perspectives together and use\nthem to shed light on each other.\n", "  The present work describes the theoretical analysis of isotope effect\ncoefficient as a function of transition temperature in two orbital per site\nmodel Hamiltonian in iron based superconducting system. The expression of\nisotope effect coefficient has been computed numerically and self-consistently\nby employing Green's function technique within the BCS-mean-field\napproximation. It is observed that the isotope effect coefficient increases\nwith the increase of the hybridization while with the increase in Coulomb\ninteraction it starts decreasing. On increasing the carrier density per site in\ntwo orbital per site iron pnictide system, isotope effect coefficient\n($\\alpha$) exhibits large values (much higher than BCS limit) at lower\ntemperatures. While in the underdoped case, isotope effect coefficient shows\nminimum value in superconducting states of the iron based systems. Furthermore,\nit has been found that the large value of the isotope effect coefficient is the\nindication of the fact that the contribution of phonon alone is inadequate as\nthe origin of superconductivity in these systems. Finally, the obtained\ntheoretical results have been compared with experimental and existing\ntheoretical observations in iron based superconductors.\n", "  We report on a measurement of the $D^{+}$-meson production cross section as a\nfunction of transverse momentum ($p_T$) in proton-antiproton ($p\\bar{p}$)\ncollisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy, using the full data set collected\nby the Collider Detector at Fermilab in Tevatron Run II and corresponding to 10\nfb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. We use $D^{+} \\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decays\nfully reconstructed in the central rapidity region $|y|<1$ with transverse\nmomentum down to 1.5 GeV/$c$, a range previously unexplored in $p\\bar{p}$\ncollisions. Inelastic $p\\bar{p}$-scattering events are selected online using\nminimally-biasing requirements followed by an optimized offline selection. The\n$K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ mass distribution is used to identify the $D^+$ signal, and the\n$D^+$ transverse impact-parameter distribution is used to separate prompt\nproduction, occurring directly in the hard scattering process, from secondary\nproduction from $b$-hadron decays. We obtain a prompt $D^+$ signal of 2950\ncandidates corresponding to a total cross section $\\sigma(D^+, 1.5 < p_T <\n14.5~\\mbox{GeV/}c, |y|<1) = 71.9 \\pm 6.8 (\\mbox{stat}) \\pm 9.3\n(\\mbox{syst})~\\mu$b. While the measured cross sections are consistent with\ntheoretical estimates in each $p_T$ bin, the shape of the observed $p_T$\nspectrum is softer than the expectation from quantum chromodynamics. The\nresults are unique in $p\\bar{p}$ collisions and can improve the shape and\nuncertainties of future predictions.\n", "  We use a generalized Ricci tensor, defined for generalized metrics in Courant\nalgebroids, to show that Poisson-Lie T-duality is compatible with the 1-loop\nrenormalization group.\n", "  We represent in the universal form restricted one-instanton partition\nfunction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. It is based on the derivation of\nuniversal expressions for quantum dimensions (universal characters) of Cartan\npowers of adjoint and some other series of irreps of simple Lie algebras. These\nformulae also provide a proof of formulae for universal quantum dimensions for\nlow-dimensional representations, needed in derivation of universal knot\npolynomials (i.e. colored Wilson averages of Chern-Simons theory on 3d sphere).\nAs a check of the (complicated) formulae for universal quantum dimensions we\nprove numerically Deligne's hypothesis on universal characters for symmetric\ncube of adjoint representation.\n", "  In this paper, we describe a compact and practical algorithm to construct\nHermitian Young projection operators for irreducible representations of the\nspecial unitary group SU(N), and discuss why ordinary Young projection\noperators are unsuitable for physics applications. The proof of this\nconstruction algorithm uses the iterative method described by Keppeler and\nSj\\\"odahl. We further show that Hermitian Young projection operators share\ndesirable properties with Young tableaux, namely a nested hierarchy when\n\"adding a particle\". We end by exhibiting the enormous advantage of the\nHermitian Young projection operators constructed in this paper over those given\nby Keppeler and Sj\\\"odahl.\n", "  The equilibrium value of an observable defines a manifold in the phase space\nof an ergodic and equipartitioned many-body system. A typical trajectory\npierces that manifold infinitely often as time goes to infinity. We use these\npiercings to measure both the relaxation time of the lowest frequency eigenmode\nof the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain (FPU), as well as the fluctuations of the\nsubsequent dynamics in equilibrium. The dynamics in equilibrium is\ncharacterized by a power-law distribution of excursion times far off\nequilibrium, with diverging variance. Long excursions arise from sticky\ndynamics close to q-breathers localized in normal mode space. Measuring the\nexponent allows to predict the transition into nonergodic dynamics. We\ngeneralize our method to Klein-Gordon lattices (KG) where the sticky dynamics\nis due to discrete breathers localized in real space.\n", "  Application of transformation theory to underwater acoustics has been a\nchallenging task because highly anisotropic density is unachievable in water. A\npossible strategy is to exploit anisotropic modulus rather than density, while\nhas not been experimentally demonstrated. We present an annular underwater\nacoustic cloak designed from particular graded solid microstructures. The\ngeometry tailored microstructures mimics meta-fluid with highly anisotropic\nmodulus through substantially suppressed shear wave. Transient wave experiments\nare conducted with the cloak in a designed 2D underwater waveguide system and\nproved excellent cloaking performance for enclosed target over broadband\nfrequency 9-15 kHz. This finding paves the way for controlling underwater\nacoustics using the structured anisotropic modulus meta-fluid.\n", "  We examine how future gravitational-wave measurements from merging black\nholes (BHs) can be used to infer the shape of the black-hole mass function,\nwith important implications for the study of star formation and evolution and\nthe properties of binary BHs. We model the mass function as a power law,\ninherited from the stellar initial mass function, and introduce lower and upper\nmass cutoff parameterizations in order to probe the minimum and maximum BH\nmasses allowed by stellar evolution, respectively. We initially focus on the\nheavier BH in each binary, to minimize model dependence. Taking into account\nthe experimental noise, the mass measurement errors and the uncertainty in the\nredshift-dependence of the merger rate, we show that the mass function\nparameters, as well as the total rate of merger events, can be measured to <10%\naccuracy within a few years of advanced LIGO observations at its design\nsensitivity. This can be used to address important open questions such as the\nupper limit on the stellar mass which allows for BH formation and to confirm or\nrefute the currently observed mass gap between neutron stars and BHs. In order\nto glean information on the progenitors of the merging BH binaries, we then\nadvocate the study of the two-dimensional mass distribution to constrain\nparameters that describe the two-body system, such as the mass ratio between\nthe two BHs, in addition to the merger rate and mass function parameters. We\nargue that several years of data collection can efficiently probe models of\nbinary formation, and show, as an example, that the hypothesis that some\ngravitational-wave events may involve primordial black holes can be tested.\nFinally, we point out that in order to maximize the constraining power of the\ndata, it may be worthwhile to lower the signal-to-noise threshold imposed on\neach candidate event and amass a larger statistical ensemble of BH mergers.\n", "  Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and its variants are\nkey technologies for visualizing the dynamics of single molecules or organelles\nin live cells. Yet, truely quantitative TIRF remains problematic. One unknown\nhampering the interpretation of evanescent-wave excited fluorescence\nintensities is the undetermined cell refractive index (RI). Here, we use a\ncombination of TIRF excitation and supercritical angle fluorescence emission\ndetection to directly mea-sure the average RI in the 'footprint' region of the\ncell, during imaging. Our RI measurement is based on the determination on a\nback-focal plane image of the critical angle separating supercritical and\nundercritial fluorescence emission components. We validate our method by\nimaging mouse embryonic fibroblasts. By targeting various dyes and\nfluorescent-protein chimerae to vesicles, the plasma membrane as well as\nmitochondria and the ER, we demonstrate local RI measurements with subcellular\nresolution on a standard TIRF microscope with a removable Bertrand lens as the\nonly modification. Our tech-nique has important applications for imaging axial\nvesicle dynamics, mitochondrial energy state or detecting cancer cells.\n", "  Nanoscale magnetic skyrmions are considered as potential information carriers\nfor future spintronics memory and logic devices. Such applications will require\nthe control of their local creation and annihilation, which involves so far\nsolutions that are either energy consuming or difficult to integrate. Here we\ndemonstrate the control of skyrmion bubbles nucleation and annihilation using\nelectric field gating, an easily integrable and potentially energetically\nefficient solution. We present a detailed stability diagram of the skyrmion\nbubbles in a Pt/Co/oxide trilayer and show that their stability can be\ncontrolled via an applied electric field. An analytical bubble model, with the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction imbedded in the domain wall energy, account\nfor the observed electrical skyrmion switching effect. This allows us to unveil\nthe origin of the electrical control of skyrmions stability and to show that\nboth magnetic dipolar interaction and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\nplay an important role in the skyrmion bubble stabilization.\n", "  The way in which geometry encodes entanglement is a topic of much recent\ninterest in quantum many-body physics and the AdS/CFT duality. This relation is\nparticularly pronounced in the case of topological quantum field theories,\nwhere topology alone determines the quantum states of the theory. In this work,\nwe study the set of quantum states that can be prepared by the Euclidean path\nintegral in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Specifically, we consider\narbitrary 3-manifolds with a fixed number of torus boundaries in both abelian\nU(1) and non-abelian SO(3) Chern-Simons theory. For the abelian theory, we find\nthat the states that can be prepared coincide precisely with the set of\nstabilizer states from quantum information theory. This constrains the\nmultipartite entanglement present in this theory, but it also reveals that\nstabilizer states can be described by topology. In particular, we find an\nexplicit expression for the entanglement entropy of a many-torus subsystem\nusing only a single replica, as well as a concrete formula for the number of\nGHZ states that can be distilled from a tripartite state prepared through path\nintegration. For the nonabelian theory, we find a notion of \"state\nuniversality\", namely that any state can be prepared to an arbitrarily good\napproximation. The manifolds we consider can also be viewed as toy models of\nmulti-boundary wormholes in AdS/CFT.\n", "  This paper generalizes two facts about oriented 3d TFTs to the unoriented\ncase. On one hand, it is known that oriented 3d TFTs having a topological\nboundary condition admit a state-sum construction known as the Turaev-Viro\nconstruction. This is related to the string-net construction of fermionic\nphases of matter. We show how Turaev-Viro construction can be generalized to\nunoriented 3d TFTs. On the other hand, it is known that the \"fermionic\"\nversions of oriented TFTs, known as Spin-TFTs, can be constructed in terms of\n\"shadow\" TFTs which are ordinary oriented TFTs with an anomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n1-form symmetry. We generalize this correspondence to Pin$^+$-TFTs by showing\nthat they can be constructed in terms of ordinary unoriented TFTs with\nanomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry having a mixed anomaly with\ntime-reversal symmetry. The corresponding Pin$^+$-TFT does not have any anomaly\nfor time-reversal symmetry however and hence it can be unambiguously defined on\na non-orientable manifold. In case a Pin$^+$-TFT admits a topological boundary\ncondition, one can combine the above two statements to obtain a\nTuraev-Viro-like construction of Pin$^+$-TFTs. As an application of these\nideas, we construct a large class of Pin$^+$-SPT phases.\n", "  We present a discrete-time formulation for the autonomous learning\nconjecture. The main feature of this formulation is the possibility to apply\nthe autonomous learning scheme to systems in which the errors with respect to\ntarget functions are not well-defined for all times. This restriction for the\nevaluation of functionality is a typical feature in systems that need a finite\ntime interval to process a unit piece of information. We illustrate its\napplication on an artificial neural network with feed-forward architecture for\nclassification and a phase oscillator system with synchronization properties.\nThe main characteristics of the discrete-time formulation are shown by\nconstructing these systems with predefined functions.\n", "  We propose a new numerical method to compute parton distribution\namplitude(PDA) from the Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter wave function. The essential\nstep is to extract the weight function in the Nakanishi representation of the\nBethe-Salpeter wave function in Euclidean space, which is an ill-posed\ninversion problem, via the maximum entropy method(MEM). The Nakanishi weight\nfunction as well as the corresponding light-front PDA can be well determined.\nWe confirm the previous works on PDA computation therein the different method\nhas been performed.\n", "  Torsion is a metric-independent component of gravitation, which may provide a\nmore general geometry than the one taking place within general relativity. On\nthe other hand torsion could lead to interesting phenomenology in both particle\nphysics and cosmology. In the present work it is shown that a torsion field\ninteracting with the SM Higgs doublet and having a negligible coupling to SM\nfermions is protected from decaying by a $Z_2$ symmetry, and therefore becomes\na promising Dark Matter (DM) candidate. In order to check the consistency of\nthis scenario we evaluate the DM relic density and explore direct DM detection\nand collider constraints on this model. It turns out that in the model when the\nHiggs boson is only partly responsible for the generation of torsion mass,\nthere is a region of parameter space where torsion contributes 100% to the DM\nbudget of the Universe. Furthermore, we show that the LHC currently has a\nlimited sensitivity to the torsion parameter space via mono-jet signature and\nwill be able to considerably improve its coverage of the torsion parameter\nspace with the projected high luminosity.\n", "  The generalization of matrix product states (MPS) to continuous systems, as\nproposed in the breakthrough paper [F. Verstraete, J.I. Cirac, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n104, 190405(2010)], provides a powerful variational ansatz for the ground state\nof strongly interacting quantum field theories in one spatial dimension. A\ncontinuous MPS (cMPS) approximation to the ground state can be obtained by\nsimulating an Euclidean time evolution. In this Letter we propose a cMPS\noptimization algorithm based instead on energy minimization by gradient\nmethods, and demonstrate its performance by applying it to the Lieb Liniger\nmodel (an integrable model of an interacting bosonic field) directly in the\nthermodynamic limit. We observe a very significant computational speed-up, of\nmore than two orders of magnitude, with respect to simulating an Euclidean time\nevolution. As a result, much larger cMPS bond dimension D can be reached (e.g.\nD = 256 with moderate computational resources) thus helping unlock the full\npotential of the cMPS representation for ground state studies.\n", "  We consider the ionisation of atomic hydrogen by a strong infrared field. We\nextend and study in more depth an existing semi-analytical model. Starting from\nthe time-dependent Schroedinger equation in momentum space and in the velocity\ngauge we substitute the kernel of the non-local Coulomb potential by a sum of N\nseparable potentials, each of them supporting one hydrogen bound state. This\nleads to a set of N coupled one-dimensional linear Volterra integral equations\nto solve. We analyze the gauge problem for the model, the different ways of\ngenerating the separable potentials and establish a clear link with the strong\nfield approximation which turns out to be a limiting case of the present model.\nWe calculate electron energy spectra as well as the time evolution of electron\nwave packets in momentum space. We compare and discuss the results obtained\nwith the model and with the strong field approximation and examine in this\ncontext, the role of excited states.\n", "  We describe the development of a tracking device, mounted on an\nepi-fluorescent inverted microscope, suited to obtain time resolved 3D\nLagrangian tracks of fluorescent passive or active micro-objects in\nmicro-fluidic devices. The system is based on real-time image processing,\ndetermining the displacement of a x,y mechanical stage to keep the chosen\nobject at a fixed position in the observation frame. The z displacement is\nbased on the refocusing of the fluorescent object determining the displacement\nof a piezo mover keeping the moving object in focus. Track coordinates of the\nobject with respect to the micro-fluidic device, as well as images of the\nobject are obtained at a frequency of several tenths of Hertz. This device is\nparticularly well adapted to obtain trajectories of motile micro-organisms in\nmicro-fluidic devices with or without flow.\n", "  A diffusion theory for intramolecular reactions of polymer chain in dilute\nsolution is formulated. We give a detailed analytical expression for\ncalculation of rate of polymer looping in solution. The physical problem of\nlooping can be modeled mathematically with the use of a Smoluchowski like\nequation with a Dirac delta function sink of finite strength. The solution of\nthis equation is expressed in terms of Laplace Transform of the Greens function\nfor end to end motion of the polymer in absence of the sink. We have defined\ntwo different rate constants, the long term rate constant and the short term\nrate constant. The short term rate constant and long term rate constant varies\nwith several parameters such as length of the polymer, bond length and the\nrelaxation time. The long term rate constant is independent of the initial\nprobability distribution.\n", "  The spectrum of spinless, non-interacting electrons on a linear chain that is\nbuckled in a non- uniform manner giving it a flavor of a topologically\ndisordered lattice, is investigated within a tight binding formalism. We have\naddressed two specific cases, viz., a perfectly periodic chain wrinkled in a\nquasiperiodic Fibonacci pattern, and a quasiperiodic Fibonacci chain, where the\nbuckling also takes place in a Fibonacci pattern. The buckling brings distant\nneighbors in the parent chain to close proximity, which is simulated by a\ntunnel hopping amplitude. It is seen that, in the perfectly ordered case,\nincreasing the strength of the tunnel hopping (that is, bending the segments\nmore) absolutely continuous density of states is retained towards the edges of\nthe band, while the central portion becomes fragmented and host subbands of\nnarrowing widths containing extended, current carrying states, and multiple\nisolated bound states formed as a result of the bending. A switching on and off\nof the electronic transmission can thus be engineered by buckling. On the other\nhand, in the second example of a quasiperiodic Fibonacci chain, imparting a\nquasiperiodic buckling is found to generate continuous subband(s) destroying\nthe usual multifractality of the energy spectrum. We present exact results\nbased on a real space renormalization group analysis, that is corroborated by\nexplicit calculation of the two terminal electronic transport.\n", "  The PADME experiment at the DA$\\Phi$NE Beam-Test Facility (BTF) aims at\nsearching for invisible decays of the dark photon by measuring the final state\nmissing mass in the process $e^+e^- \\to \\gamma+ A'$, with $A'$ undetected. The\nmeasurement requires the determination of the 4-momentum of the recoil photon,\nperformed using a homogeneous, highly segmented BGO crystals calorimeter. We\nreport the results of the test of a 5$\\times$5 crystals prototype performed\nwith an electron beam at the BTF in July 2016.\n", "  Organic microcavities can be engineered to reach exotic quantum regimes of\nstrong and ultrastrong light-matter coupling. However, the microscopic\ninterpretation of their spectroscopic signals can be challenging due to the\ncompetition between coherent and dissipative processes involving electrons,\nvibrations and cavity photons. We develop here a theoretical framework based on\nthe Holstein-Tavis-Cummings model and a Markovian treatment of dissipation to\naccount for previously unexplained spectroscopic features of organic\nmicrocavities consistently. We identify conditions for the formation of dark\nvibronic polaritons, a new class of light-matter excitations that are not\nvisible in absorption but lead to strong photoluminescence lines. We show that\nphoton leakage from dark vibronic polaritons can be responsible for enhancing\nphotoluminescence at the lower polariton frequency, and also explain the\napparent breakdown of reciprocity between absorption and emission in the\nvicinity of the bare molecular transition frequency. Successful comparison with\nexperimental data demonstrates the applicability of our theory.\n", "  We consider renormalization of the three-body scattering problem in\nlow-energy effective field theory of self-interacting scalar particles by\napplying time-ordered perturbation theory to the manifestly Lorentz-invariant\nformulation. The obtained leading-order equation is perturbatively\nrenormalizable and non-perturbatively finite and does not require a three-body\ncounter term in contrast to its non-relativistic approximation.\n", "  We find all symmetric space solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity\ncompleting an earlier classification by Figueroa-O'Farrill. They come in two\ntypes: AdS solutions and pp-wave solutions. We analyze the supersymmetry\nconditions and show that out of the 99 AdS geometries the only supersymmetric\nones are the well known backgrounds arising as near-horizon limits of\n(intersecting) M-branes and preserving 32, 16 or 8 supersymmetries. The general\nform of the superisometry algebra for symmetric space backgrounds is also\nderived.\n", "  Mesoscopic numerical simulations provide a unique approach for the\nquantification of the chemical influences on red blood cell functionalities.\nThe transport Dissipative Particles Dynamics (tDPD) method can lead to such\neffective multiscale simulations due to its ability to simultaneously capture\nmesoscopic advection, diffusion, and reaction. In this paper, we present a\nGPU-accelerated red blood cell simulation package based on a tDPD adaptation of\nour red blood cell model, which can correctly recover the cell membrane\nviscosity, elasticity, bending stiffness, and cross-membrane chemical\ntransport. The package essentially processes all computational workloads in\nparallel by GPU, and it incorporates multi-stream scheduling and non-blocking\nMPI communications to improve inter-node scalability. Our code is validated for\naccuracy and compared against the CPU counterpart for speed. Strong scaling and\nweak scaling are also presented to characterizes scalability. We observe a\nspeedup of 10.1 on one GPU over all 16 cores within a single node, and a weak\nscaling efficiency of 91% across 256 nodes. The program enables\nquick-turnaround and high-throughput numerical simulations for investigating\nchemical-driven red blood cell phenomena and disorders.\n", "  We develop a complete path-integral formulation of relativistic quantum\nfields in local thermal equilibrium, which brings about the emergence of\nthermally induced curved spacetime. The resulting action is shown to have full\ndiffeomorphism invariance and gauge invariance in thermal spacetime with\nimaginary-time independent backgrounds. This leads to the notable symmetry\nproperties of emergent thermal spacetime: Kaluza-Klein gauge symmetry, spatial\ndiffeomorphism symmetry, and gauge symmetry. A thermodynamic potential in local\nthermal equilibrium, or the so-called Masseiu-Planck functional, is identified\nas a generating functional for conserved currents such as the energy-momentum\ntensor and the electric current.\n", "  The Markovian dynamics of a qubit is investigated in the scheme of random\nunitary dynamics, where Kraus operators are changed by an extra noise. The\nbehavior of Markovianity is explored in the perturbed scenario. We provide a\nnew algorithm for checking CP-divisibility (Markovianity) of a dynamical map.\n", "  We propose a minimal extension of the standard model by including a $U(1)$\nflavor symmetry to establish a correlation between the relic abundance of dark\nmatter, measured by WMAP and PLANCK satellite experiments and non-zero value of\n$\\sin \\theta_{13}$ observed at DOUBLE CHOOZ, Daya Bay, RENO and T2K. The\nflavour symmetry is allowed to be broken at a high scale to a remnant\n$\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, which not only ensures the stability to the dark\nmatter, but also gives rise to a modification to the existing $A_4$-based\ntri-bimaximal neutrino mixing. This deviation in turn suggests the required\nnon-zero value of $\\sin \\theta_{13}$. We assume the dark matter to be neutral\nunder the existing $A_4$ symmetry while charged under the $U(1)$ flavor\nsymmetry. Hence in this set-up, the non-zero value of $\\sin \\theta_{13}$\npredicts the dark matter charge under $U(1)$, which can be tested at various\nongoing and future direct and collider dark matter search experiments. We also\npoint out the involvement of nonzero leptonic CP phase $\\delta$, which plays an\nimportant role in the analysis.\n", "  Electric-field (E-field) control of magnetism enabled by multiferroics has\nthe potential to revolutionize the landscape of present memory devices plagued\nwith high energy dissipation. To date, this E-field controlled multiferroic\nscheme at room temperature has only been demonstrated using BiFeO3 (BFO) films\ngrown on DyScO3 (refs 1 and 2), a unique and expensive substrate, which gives\nrise to a particular ferroelectric domain pattern in BFO. Here, we demonstrate\nreversible E-field-induced switching of the magnetic state of the Co layer in\nCo/BFO (001) thin film heterostructures fabricated on SrTiO3 substrates. The\nangular dependence of the coercivity and the remanent magnetization of the Co\nlayer indicates that its easy axis reversibly switches by 45{\\deg} back and\nforth between the (100) and the (110) crystallographic directions of SrTiO3 as\na result of alternating application of positive and negative voltage pulses on\nBFO. The coercivity of the Co layer exhibits a hysteretic behavior between two\nstates as a function of voltage. To explain the observation, we have also\nmeasured the exact canting angle of the antiferromagnetic G-type domain in BFO\nfilms for the first time using neutron diffraction. These results suggest a\npathway to integrating BFO-based devices on Si wafers for implementing low\npower consumption and non-volatile magnetoelectronic devices.\n", "  A generalized method is proposed to compose new orbits from a given chaotic\nmap. The method provides an approach to examine discrete-time chaotic maps in a\n\"deep-zoom\" manner by using $k$-digits to the right from the decimal separator\nof a given point from the underlying chaotic map. Interesting phenomena have\nbeen identified. Rapid randomization was observed, i.e. chaotic patterns tend\nto become indistinguishable, when compared to the original orbits of the\nunderlying chaotic map. Our results were presented using different graphical\nanalyses (i.e., time-evolution, bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent,\nPoincar\\'e diagram and frequency distribution). Moreover, taking advantage of\nthis randomization improvement, we propose a Pseudo-Random Number Generator\n(PRNG) based on the $k$-logistic map. The pseudo-random qualities of the\nproposed PRNG passed both tests successfully, i.e. DIEHARD and NIST, and were\ncomparable with other traditional PRNGs such as the Mersenne Twister. The\nresults suggest that simple maps such as the logistic map can be considered as\ngood PRNG methods.\n", "  We investigate the cosmology of the minimal model of neutral naturalness, the\nmirror Twin Higgs. The softly-broken mirror symmetry relating the Standard\nModel to its twin counterpart leads to significant dark radiation in tension\nwith BBN and CMB observations. We quantify this tension and illustrate how it\ncan be mitigated in several simple scenarios that alter the relative energy\ndensities of the two sectors while respecting the softly-broken mirror\nsymmetry. In particular, we consider both the out-of-equilibrium decay of a new\nscalar as well as reheating in a toy model of twinned inflation, Twinflation.\nIn both cases the dilution of energy density in the twin sector does not merely\nreconcile the existence of a mirror Twin Higgs with cosmological constraints,\nbut predicts contributions to cosmological observables that may be probed in\ncurrent and future CMB experiments. This raises the prospect of discovering\nevidence of neutral naturalness through cosmology rather than colliders.\n", "  Room temperature Ionic liquids (RTIL) received considerable attention as a\nnew class of materials with fundamental importance for energy storage\n\\cite{Armand2009, Uesugi2013} and active lubrication \\cite{Palacio2010,\nDold2015, Smith2013a}. Their unique properties result from the competition of\nstrong electrostatic interactions with properly designed molecular structure to\navoid crystalization at room temperature. They are however unsual liquids,\nwhich challenge fundamentally the classical frameworks of electrolytes. In\nparticular their behavior at electrified interfaces remains elusive with very\nrich and exotic responses relevant to their electrochemical activity\n\\cite{Kornyshev2014,Merlet2012,Perkin2013,Atkin2009,Rotenberg2015,Endres2012,Bovio2009a,Bovio2009,Yokota2010}.\nIn this work, we use quartz tuning fork based AFM nanorheological measurements\nto explore the properties of RTIL in nanometric confinement. We unveil a\ndramatic change of the RTIL towards a solid-like phase below a threshold\nthickness, pointing to a capillary freezing in confinement. This threshold\nthickness is found to be intimately related to the metallic nature of the\nconfining materials, with more metallic surfaces facilitating capillary\nfreezing. This behavior is interpreted theoretically in terms of the shift of\nthe freezing transition, taking into account the influence of the electronic\nscreening on RTIL wetting of the confining surfaces, as described by the simple\nThomas-Fermi approach. Our findings provides fresh views on the properties of\nconfined RTIL with important implications for their statics and dynamics inside\nnanoporous metallic structures. This also suggests applications to tune\nnanoscale lubrication with the phase-changing RTIL, by varying the nature as\nwell as the patterning of the subtrate, and the application of active\npolarisation.\n", "  We present a quantitative and comparative study of magnetic field driven\ndomain wall depinning transition in different ferromagnetic ultrathin films\nover a wide range of temperature. We reveal a universal scaling function\naccounting for both drive and thermal effects on the depinning transition,\nincluding critical exponents. The consistent description we obtain for both the\ndepinning and subthreshold thermally activated creep motion should shed light\non the universal glassy dynamics of thermally fluctuating elastic objects\npinned by disordered energy landscapes.\n", "  Tourism is a complex dynamic system including multiple actors which are\nrelated each other composing an evolving social network. This paper presents a\ngrowing bipartite network model that explains the rise of the supply network in\na tourism destination from the beginning phases of development. The nodes are\nthe lodgings and services in a destination and a link between them appears if a\nrepresentative tourist hosted in the lodging visits/consumes the service during\nhis/her stay. The specific link between both categories are determined by a\nrandom and preferential attachment rule. The analytic results show that the\nlong-term degree distribution of services follows a shifted power-law\ndistribution. The numerical simulations show slight disagreements with the\ntheoretical results in the case of the one-mode degree distribution of\nservices, due to the low order of convergence to zero of X-motifs. The model\npredictions are compared with real data coming from a popular tourist\ndestination in Gran Canaria, Spain, showing a good agreement between numerical\nand empirical data.\n", "  Recently it has been shown that there is asymptotic BMS-like symmetry\nassociated with the near-horizon geometry of black holes in three and four\ndimensions. In this paper, we show that the presence of such BMS-like symmetry\nis a ubiquitous feature for black holes in generic dimensions. For black holes\nin $D$ dimensions, the symmetry contains 2 supertranslations and $D-2$\ngeneralized superrotations. The superrotations are found to generate a\ngeneralized Witt-like algebra that was previously noticed in a rather different\nconstruction. In the case of stationary and axisymmetric black holes, we\ncalculate the surface charges and show that the zero-mode charges are\nintimately related to the entropy and angular momenta of the black hole.\n", "  We investigate the thermoelectric current and heat conductance in a chiral\nJosephson contact on a surface of a 3D topological insulator, covered with\nsuperconducting and magnetic insulator films. The contact consists of two\njunctions of Majorana and Dirac channels next to two superconductors. Geometric\nasymmetry results in a supercurrent without a phase bias. The interference of\nDirac fermions causes oscillations of the electric and heat currents with an\nunconventional period $2\\Phi_0=h/e$ as functions of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Due\nto the gapless character of Majorana modes, there is no threshold for the\nthermoelectric effect and the current-flux relationship is non-sinusoidal.\nDepending on the magnetic flux, the direction of the electric current can be\nboth from the hot to cold lead and vice versa.\n", "  We consider a variation of the Kuramoto model with dynamic coupling, where\nthe coupling strengths are allowed to evolve in response to the phase\ndifference between the oscillators, a model first considered by Ha, Noh and\nPark. In particular we study the stability of fixed points for this model. We\ndemonstrate a somewhat surprising fact: namely that the fixed points of this\nmodel, as well as their stability, can be completely expressed in terms of the\nfixed points and stability of the analogous classical Kuramoto problem where\nthe coupling strengths are fixed to a constant (the same for all edges). In\nparticular for the \"all-to-all\" network, where the underlying graph is the\ncomplete graph, the problem reduces to the problem of understanding the fixed\npoints and stability of the all-to-all Kuramoto model with equal edge weights,\na problem that has been completely solved.\n", "  The magnetic-field dependencies of the longitudinal and Hall resistivity of\nthe electron-doped compounds $Nd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_{4+\\delta}$ in underdoped region\n(x=0.14) were investigated. It was established experimentally a strong magnetic\nfield dependence of the Hall conductivity, $\\sigma_{xy}(B)=C-b/B$, in the\nregion of magnetic fields corresponding to a transition from superconducting to\nresistive state. The observed feature can be explained with the sum of\ncontributions of the quasiparticles and moving Abrikosov vortices into Hall\neffect in a mixed state of type-II superconductor.\n", "  Recently (arXiv:1608.00526), a new framework for warped higher-dimensional\ncompactifications with \"bulk\" standard model (SM) was proposed: in addition to\nthe UV (Planck scale) and IR (a couple of TeV) branes, there is an intermediate\nbrane, taken to be around 10 TeV. The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from\nthe UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity\nfields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest\ngauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying\nflavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the\nlightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect\npermits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include\nflavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -\ndecay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of\nSM gauge bosons. In this work, we first delineate the parameter space where the\nabove mentioned cascade decay of gauge KK particles dominates, and thereby can\nbe the discovery mode at the LHC. We then perform a detailed analysis of the\nLHC signals from this model, finding that 300/fb suffices for evidence of\nKK-gluon in tri-jet, jet + di-photon and jet + di-boson channels. However, KK\nphoton in photon + di-jet, and KK-W in leptonic W + di-jet require 3000/fb. The\ncrucial feature of this decay chain is a \"double\" resonance, i.e. 3-particle\nand 2-particle invariant mass peaks, corresponding to the KK gauge boson and\nthe radion respectively.\n", "  The Kassiopeia particle tracking framework is an object-oriented software\npackage using modern C++ techniques, written originally to meet the needs of\nthe KATRIN collaboration. Kassiopeia features a new algorithmic paradigm for\nparticle tracking simulations which targets experiments containing complex\ngeometries and electromagnetic fields, with high priority put on calculation\nefficiency, customizability, extensibility, and ease of use for novice\nprogrammers. To solve Kassiopeia's target physics problem the software is\ncapable of simulating particle trajectories governed by arbitrarily complex\ndifferential equations of motion, continuous physics processes that may in part\nbe modeled as terms perturbing that equation of motion, stochastic processes\nthat occur in flight such as bulk scattering and decay, and stochastic surface\nprocesses occuring at interfaces, including transmission and reflection\neffects. This entire set of computations takes place against the backdrop of a\nrich geometry package which serves a variety of roles, including initialization\nof electromagnetic field simulations and the support of state-dependent\nalgorithm-swapping and behavioral changes as a particle's state evolves. Thanks\nto the very general approach taken by Kassiopeia it can be used by other\nexperiments facing similar challenges when calculating particle trajectories in\nelectromagnetic fields. It is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/KATRIN-Experiment/Kassiopeia\n", "  The de-excitation of alpha-conjugate nuclei produced in reactions of 35\nMeV/nucleon 40Ca with 40Ca has been investigated. Particular emphasis is placed\non examining the dynamics of collisions leading to projectile-like fragment\nexit channels. A general exploration of the reaction systematics reveals the\nbinary dissipative character of the collisions and a hierarchy effect similar\nto that seen for heavier systems. Investigation of the subset of events\ncharacterized by a total alpha-conjugate mass (alpha particles plus\nalpha-conjugate fragments) equal to 40 and atomic number equal to 20 reveals a\ndominance of alpha-conjugate exit channels. The hierarchy effect for these\nchannels leads to the production of alpha-clustered neck structures with\npotentially exotic geometries and properties.\n", "  Within the framework of Quantum Reduced Loop Gravity we quantize the\nHamiltonian for a gauge vector field. The regularization can be performed using\ntools analogous to the ones adopted in full Loop Quantum Gravity, while the\nmatrix elements of the resulting operator between basis states are analytic\ncoefficients. This analysis is the first step towards deriving the full quantum\ngravity corrections to the vector field semiclassical dynamics.\n", "  Disordered quantum antiferromagnets in two-dimensional compounds have been a\nfocus of interest in the last years due to their exotic properties. However,\nwith very few exceptions, the ground states of the corresponding Hamiltonians\nare notoriously difficult to simulate making their characterization and\ndetection very elusive, both, theoretically and experimentally. Here we propose\na method to signal quantum disordered antiferromagnets by doing exact\ndiagonalization in small lattices using random boundary conditions and\naveraging the observables of interest over the different disorder realizations.\nWe apply our method to study a Heisenberg spin-1/2 model in an anisotropic\ntriangular lattice. In this model, the competition between frustration and\nquantum fluctuations might lead to some spin liquid phases as predicted from\ndifferent methods ranging from spin wave mean field theory to 2D-DMRG or PEPS.\nOur method accurately reproduces the ordered phases expected of the model and\nsignals disordered phases by the presence of a large number of quasi degenerate\nground states together with the absence of a local order parameter. The method\npresents a weak dependence on finite size effects.\n", "  It was recently shown that the exact potential driving the electron's\ndynamics in enhanced ionization of H$_2^+$ can have large contributions arising\nfrom dynamical electron-nuclear correlation, going beyond what any\nelectrostatics-based model can provide[1]. This potential is defined via the\nexact factorization of the molecular wavefunction that allows the construction\nof a Schr\\\"odinger equation for the electronic system, in which the potential\ncontains exactly the effect of coupling to the nuclear system and any external\nfields. Here we study enhanced ionization in isotopologues of H$_2^+$ in order\nto investigate nuclear-mass-dependence of these terms for this process. We\ndecompose the exact potential into components that naturally arise from the\nconditional wavefunction, and also into components arising from the marginal\nelectronic wavefunction, and compare the performance of propagation on these\ndifferent components as well as approximate potentials based on the\nquasi-static or Hartree approximation with the exact propagation. A\nquasiclassical analysis is presented to help analyse the structure of different\nnon-electrostatic components to the potential driving the ionizing electron.\n", "  We introduce two new families of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) extensions of\nthe oscillator in a $d$-dimensional constant-curvature space. For the first\nthree members of each family, we obtain closed-form expressions of the energies\nand wavefunctions for some allowed values of the potential parameters using the\nBethe ansatz method. We prove that the first member of each family has a hidden\nsl(2,$\\mathbb{R}$) symmetry and is connected with a QES equation of the first\nor second type, respectively. One-dimensional results are also derived from the\n$d$-dimensional ones with $d \\ge 2$, thereby getting QES extensions of the\nMathews-Lakshmanan nonlinear oscillator.\n", "  The Peccei-Quinn symmetry is an automatic symmetry of the 3-3-1 gauge models\nwhich, consequently are not plagued with the strong CP problem. Nevertheless,\nthe axion that emerges from spontaneous breaking of Peccei-Quinn symmetry\ncannot be made invisible in the original versions of these models, unless we\nextend their scalar sector by an additional neutral scalar singlet. In this\ncase we show that if, we also add heavy neutrinos in the singlet form, we get\nto solve three interesting open questions at once: the real component of the\nneutral scalar singlet driving inflation, the axion playing the role of the\ndark matter of the universe and standard neutrinos gaining masses through\nseesaw mechanism.\n", "  We propose a new anomaly-free and family nonuniversal $\\mathrm{U}(1)'$\nextension of the standard model with the addition of two scalar singlets and a\nnew scalar doublet. The quark sector is extended by adding three exotic quark\nsinglets, while the lepton sector includes two exotic charged lepton singlets,\nthree right-handed neutrinos and three sterile Majorana leptons to obtain the\nfermionic mass spectrum of the standard model. The lepton sector also\nreproduces the elements of the PMNS matrix and the squared-mass differences\ndata from neutrino oscillation experiments. Also, analytical relations of the\nPMNS matrix are derived via the inverse see-saw mechanism, and numerical\npredictions of the parameters in both normal and inverse order scheme for the\nmass of the phenomenological neutrinos are obtained. We employed a simple\nseesaw-like method to obtain analytical mass eigenstates of the CP-even\n$3\\times 3$ mass matrix of the scalar sector.\n", "  The cosmological evolution of standard model Yukawa couplings may have major\nimplications for baryogenesis. In particular, as highlighted recently, the CKM\nmatrix alone could be the source of CP-violation during electroweak\nbaryogenesis provided that the Yukawa couplings were large and varied during\nthe electroweak phase transition. We provide a natural realisation of this idea\nin the context of Randall-Sundrum models and show that the geometrical warped\napproach to the fermion mass hierarchy may naturally display the desired\ncosmological dynamics. The key ingredient is the coupling of the\nGoldberger-Wise scalar, responsible for the IR brane stabilisation, to the bulk\nfermions, which modifies the fermionic profiles. This also helps alleviating\nthe usually tight constraints from CP-violation in Randall-Sundrum scenarios.\nWe study how the Yukawa couplings vary during the stabilisation of the\nRandall-Sundrum geometry and can thus induce large CP-violation during the\nelectroweak phase transition. Using holography, we discuss the 4D\ninterpretation of this dynamical interplay between flavour and electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos are among the most attractive extensions of the SM to\ngenerate the light neutrino masses observed in neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. When the sterile neutrinos are subject to a protective symmetry,\nthey can have masses around the electroweak scale and potentially large\nneutrino Yukawa couplings, which makes them testable at planned future particle\ncolliders. We systematically discuss the production and decay channels at\nelectron-positron, proton-proton and electron-proton colliders and provide a\ncomplete list of the leading order signatures for sterile neutrino searches.\nAmong other things, we discuss several novel search channels, and present a\nfirst look at the possible sensitivities for the active-sterile mixings and the\nheavy neutrino masses. We compare the performance of the different collider\ntypes and discuss their complementarity.\n", "  We present computer simulations of the vapour-nematic interface of the\nGay-Berne model. We considered situations which correspond to either prolate or\noblate molecules. We determine the anchoring of the nematic phase and correlate\nit with the intermolecular potential parameters. On the other hand, we evaluate\nthe surface tension associated to this interface. We find a corresponding\nstates law for the surface tension dependence on the temperature, valid for\nboth prolate and oblate molecules.\n", "  We study the production of high energy neutrinos in jets from the tidal\ndisruption of stars by supermassive black holes. The diffuse neutrino flux\nexpected from these tidal disruption events (TDEs) is calculated both\nanalytically and numerically, taking account the dependence of the rate of TDEs\non the redshift and black hole mass. We find that ~10% of the observed diffuse\nflux at IceCube at an energy of about 1 PeV can come from TDEs if the\ncharacteristics of known jetted tidal disruption events are assumed to apply to\nthe whole population of these sources. If, however, plausible scalings of the\njet Lorentz factor or variability timescale with the black hole mass are taken\ninto account, the contribution of the lowest mass black holes to the neutrino\nflux is enhanced. In this case, TDEs can account for most of the neutrino flux\ndetected at IceCube, describing both the neutrino flux normalization and\nspectral shape with moderate baryonic loadings. While the uncertainties on our\nassumptions are large, a possible signature of TDEs as the origin of the\nIceCube signal is the transition of the flux flavor composition from a pion\nbeam to a muon damped source at the highest energies, which will also result in\na suppression of Glashow resonance events.\n", "  We present NPTFit, an open-source code package, written in python and cython,\nfor performing non-Poissonian template fits (NPTFs). The NPTF is a\nrecently-developed statistical procedure for characterizing the contribution of\nunresolved point sources (PSs) to astrophysical data sets. The NPTF was first\napplied to Fermi gamma-ray data to give evidence that the excess of ~GeV\ngamma-rays observed in the inner regions of the Milky Way likely arises from a\npopulation of sub-threshold point sources, and the NPTF has since found\nadditional applications studying sub-threshold extragalactic sources at high\nGalactic latitudes. The NPTF generalizes traditional astrophysical template\nfits to allow for the ability to search for populations of unresolved PSs that\nmay follow a given spatial distribution. NPTFit builds upon the framework of\nthe fluctuation analyses developed in X-ray astronomy, and thus likely has\napplications beyond those demonstrated with gamma-ray data. The NPTFit package\nutilizes novel computational methods to perform the NPTF efficiently. The code\nis available at https://github.com/bsafdi/NPTFit and up-to-date and extensive\ndocumentation may be found at http://nptfit.readthedocs.io\n", "  Photoelastic techniques are used to make both qualitative and quantitative\nmeasurements of the forces within idealized granular materials. The method is\nbased on placing a birefringent granular material between a pair of polarizing\nfilters, so that each region of the material rotates the polarization of light\naccording to the amount of local of stress. In this review paper, we summarize\npast work using the technique, describe the optics underlying the technique,\nand illustrate how it can be used to quantitatively determine the vector\ncontact forces between particles in a 2D granular system. We provide a\ndescription of software resources available to perform this task, as well as\nkey techniques and resources for building an experimental apparatus.\n", "  We consider a supersymmetric SYK-like model without quenched disorder that is\nbuilt by coupling two kinds of fermionic N=1 tensor-valued superfields,\n\"quarks\" and \"mesons\". We prove that the model has a well-defined large-N limit\nin which the (s)quark 2-point functions are dominated by mesonic \"melon\"\ndiagrams. We sum these diagrams to obtain the Schwinger-Dyson equations and\nshow that in the IR, the solution agrees with that of the supersymmetric SYK\nmodel.\n", "  We present the first calculation of direct photon production at\nnext-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD. For this process,\nalthough the final state cuts mandate only the presence of a single electroweak\nboson, the underlying kinematics resembles that of a generic vector boson plus\njet topology. In order to regulate the infrared singularities present at this\norder we use the $N$-jettiness slicing procedure, applied for the first time to\na final state that at Born level includes colored partons but no required jet.\nWe compare our predictions to ATLAS 8 TeV data and find that the inclusion of\nthe NNLO terms in the perturbative expansion, supplemented by electroweak\ncorrections, provides an excellent description of the data with greatly reduced\ntheoretical uncertainties.\n", "  We analyse $K^- p \\to (\\eta, \\eta',\\pi^0) \\Lambda$ on the basis of the fit of\ndata in a wide region of energies, and $\\pi^- p \\to (\\eta, \\eta') n$ at the\nenergies of GAMS-4$\\pi$. We show that disagreements between the data and the\npredictions of Regge theory may be explained by the mode change of summation of\nintermediate contributions at increasing energy, from coherent to non-coherent.\nA method of experimental measurement of the non-coherent contributions is\nproposed. On the basis of available data on the charge-exchange reactions the\n$\\eta$--$\\eta'$ mixing is estimated.\n", "  We demonstrate the fact that linearity is a meaningful symmetry in the sense\nof Lie and Noether. The role played by that `linearity symmetry' in the\nquadrature of linear ordinary second-order differential equations is reviewed,\nby the use of canonical coordinates and the identification of a Wronskian-like\nconserved quantity as Lie invariant. The Jacobi last multiplier associated with\ntwo independent linearity symmetries is applied to derive the Caldirola-Kanai\nLagrangian from symmetry principles. Then the symmetry is recognized to be also\na Noether one. Finally, the study is extended to higher-order linear ordinary\ndifferential equations, derivable or not from an action principle.\n", "  We investigate perfect fluid stars in $(2+1)$ dimension in pseudo spheroidal\nspacetime with the help of Vaidya-Tikekar metric where the physical $3$-space\n($t=$ constant) is described by pseudo-spheroidal geometry. Here the\nspheroidicity parameter $a$, plays an important role for determining the\nproperties of a compact star. In the present work a class of interior solutions\ncorresponding to the Ba$\\tilde{n}$ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli $(BTZ)$ (Ba\\~nados et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 69:1849, 1992) exterior metric has been provided which\ndescribes a static circularly symmetric star with negative cosmological\nconstant in equilibrium. It is shown that asymptotically anti-de Sitter $(2+1)$\ndimensional spacetime described by BTZ admits a compact star solution with\nreasonable physical features.\n", "  Encoding quantum states in complex multiphoton fields can overcome loss\nduring signal transmission in a quantum network. Transmitting quantum\ninformation encoded in this way requires that locally stored states can be\nconverted to propagating fields. Here we experimentally show the controlled\nconversion of multiphoton quantum states, like \"Schr\\\"odinger cat\" states, from\na microwave cavity quantum memory into propagating modes. By parametric\nconversion using the nonlinearity of a single Josephson junction, we can\nrelease the cavity state in ~500 ns, about 3 orders of magnitude faster than\nits intrinsic lifetime. This `catapult' faithfully converts arbitrary cavity\nfields to traveling signals with an estimated efficiency of > 90%, enabling\non-demand generation of complex itinerant quantum states. Importantly, the\nrelease process can be controlled precisely on fast time scales, allowing us to\ngenerate entanglement between the cavity and the traveling mode by partial\nconversion. Our system can serve as the backbone of a microwave quantum\nnetwork, paving the way towards error-correctable distribution of quantum\ninformation and the transfer of highly non-classical states to hybrid quantum\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper the dynamical spin effects of the light-front holographic\nwavefunctions for light pseudoscalar mesons are studied using two different\nassumptions. These improved wavefunctions are then confronted with a number of\nsensitive hadronic observables: the decay constants of $\\pi$ and $K$ mesons,\ntheir $\\xi$-moments, the pion-to-photon transition form factor, and the pure\nannihilation $\\bar{B}_{s}\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and $\\bar{B}_{d}\\to K^+K^-$ decays.\nTaking $f_{\\pi}$, $f_{K}$ and their ratio $f_{K}/f_{\\pi}$ as constraint\nconditions, the $\\chi^2$ analyses for holographic parameters, including the\nmass scale parameter $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ and effective quark masses, are all\nconsistent with the mass scale which controls the slopes of the light-quark\nhadronic Regge trajectories. In addition, we also show how the improved\nlight-front holographic distribution amplitudes regulate the end-point\ndivergences which appear in the annihilation amplitudes of $B\\to PP$ decays.\n", "  The continuous imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo method with the worm update\nalgorithm is applied to explore the ground state properties of the spin-1/2\nHeisenberg model with antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling $J>0$ and ferromagnetic\n(F) coupling $J^{\\prime}<0$ along zigzag and armchair directions, respectively,\non honeycomb lattice. It is found that by enhancing the F coupling $J^{\\prime}$\nbetween zigzag AF chains, the system is smoothly crossover from one-dimensional\nzigzag spin chains to a two-dimensional magnetic ordered state. In absence of\nan external field, the system is in a stripe order phase. In presence of\nuniform and staggered fields, the uniform and staggered out-of-plane\nmagnetizations appear while the stripe order keeps in $xy$ plane, and a\nsecond-order quantum phase transition (QPT) at a critical staggered field is\nobserved. The critical exponents of correlation length for QPTs induced by a\nstaggered field for the cases with $J>0$, $J^{\\prime}<0$ and $J<0$,\n$J^{\\prime}>0$ are obtained to be $\\nu=0.677(2)$ and $0.693(0)$, respectively,\nindicating that both cases belong to O(3) universality. The scaling behavior in\na staggered field is analyzed, and the ground state phase diagrams in the plane\nof coupling ratio and staggered field are presented for two cases. The\ntemperature dependence of susceptibility and specific heat of both systems in\nexternal magnetic fields is also discussed.\n", "  We revisit charged lepton flavour in-flight conversions, in which a beam of\nelectrons or muons is directed onto a fixed target, $e + N \\to \\mu +N$, $e + N\n\\to \\tau +N$ and $\\mu + N \\to \\tau +N$, focusing on elastic interactions with a\nnucleus $N$. After a general discussion of this observable, we carry a full\nphenomenological analysis in the framework of minimal Standard Model extensions\nvia sterile neutrinos, with a strong emphasis on the r\\^ole of the increasingly\nmore stringent constraints arising from other (low-energy) charged lepton\nflavour violation observables. Despite the potential interest of this\nobservable, in particular in the light of certain upcoming facilities with the\ncapability of very intense lepton beams, our study suggests that due to current\nbounds on three-body decays ($\\ell_i \\to 3 \\ell_j$) and $\\mu-e$ conversion in\nNuclei, the expected number of conversions in such a minimal framework is\ndramatically reduced. An experimental observation of such a conversion would\nthus signal the presence of another source of flavour violation, possibly at\ntree-level.\n", "  We demonstrate dimensional ladder of higher dimensional quantum Hall effects\nby exploiting quantum Hall effects on arbitrary odd dimensional spheres.\nNon-relativistic and relativistic Landau models are analyzed on $S^{2k-1}$ in\nthe $SO(2k-1)$ monopole background. The total sub-band degeneracy of the odd\ndimensional lowest Landau level is shown to be equal to the winding number from\nthe base-manifold $S^{2k-1}$ to the one-dimension higher $SO(2k)$ gauge group.\nBased on the chiral Hopf maps, we clarify the underlying quantum Nambu geometry\nfor odd dimensional quantum Hall effect and the resulting quantum geometry is\nnaturally embedded also in one-dimension higher quantum geometry. An origin of\nsuch dimensional ladder connecting even and odd dimensional quantum Hall\neffects is illuminated from a viewpoint of the spectral flow of\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem in differential topology. We also present a\nBF topological field theory as an effective field theory in which membranes\nwith different dimensions undergo non-trivial linking in odd dimensional space.\nFinally, an extended version of the dimensional hierarchy for higher\ndimensional quantum Hall liquids is proposed, and its relationship to quantum\nanomaly and D-brane physics is discussed.\n", "  In the context of a left-right symmetric model, we introduce one full\ngeneration of vectorlike lepton doublets (both left and right-handed) together\nwith their mirror doublets. We show that the lightest vectorlike neutrino in\nthe model is right-handed, and can serve as the dark matter candidate. We find\nthat the relic density, as well as the direct and indirect DM detection bounds,\nare satisfied for a large range of the parameter space of the model. In\naccordance with the parameter space, we then explore the possibility of\ndetecting signals of the model at both the LHC and the ILC, in the pair\nproduction of the associated vectorlike charged leptons which decay into final\nstates including dark matter. A comprehensive analysis of signal and\nbackgrounds shows that the signals at the ILC, especially with polarized beams\nare likely to be visible for light vectorlike leptons, even with low\nluminosity, rendering our model highly predictable and experimentally testable.\n", "  In this paper, we study instanton corrections in the N=2* gauge theory by\nusing its description in string theory as a freely-acting orbifold. The latter\nis used to compute, using the worldsheet, the deformation of the Yang-Mills\naction. In addition, we calculate the deformed instanton partition function,\nthus extending the results to the non-perturbative sector of the gauge theory.\nAs we point out, the structure of the deformation is extremely similar to the\nOmega-deformation, therefore confirming the universality of the construction.\nFinally, we comment on the realisation of the mass deformation using physical\nvertex operators by exploiting the equivalence between Scherk-Schwarz\ndeformations and freely-acting orbifolds.\n", "  We report on a new experimental method based on initial-state radiation (ISR)\nin e-p scattering, in which the radiative tail of the elastic e-p peak contains\ninformation on the proton charge form factor ($G_E^p$) at extremely small\n$Q^2$. The ISR technique was validated in a dedicated experiment using the\nspectrometers of the A1-Collaboration at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI). This\nprovided first measurements of $G_E^p$ for $0.001\\leq Q^2\\leq 0.004 (GeV/c)^2$.\n", "  Optical control and manipulation of cold atoms has become an important topic\nin condensed matter. Widely employed are optical lattice shaking experiments\nwhich allow the introduction of artificial gauge fields, the design of\ntopological bandstructures, and more general probing of quantum critical\nphenomena. Here we develop new numerical methods to simulate these periodically\ndriven systems by implementing lattice shaking directly. As a result we avoid\nthe usual assumptions associated with a simplified picture based on Floquet\ndynamics. A demonstrable success of our approach is that it yields quantitative\nagreement with experiment, including Kibble-Zurek scaling. Importantly, we\nargue that because their dynamics corresponds to an effective non-linear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, these particular superfluid studies present a unique\nopportunity to address how general Floquet band engineering is affected by\ninteractions. In particular, interactions cause instabilities at which the\nbehavior of the system changes dramatically.\n", "  We investigate detailed lattice dynamics of copper halides CuX (X=Cl, Br, I)\nusing neutron inelastic scattering measurements and ab-initio calculations\naimed at a comparative study of their thermal expansion behavior. We identify\nthe low energy phonons which soften with pressure and are responsible for\nnegative thermal expansion. The eigenvector analysis of these modes suggests\nthat softening of the transverse-acoustic modes would lead to NTE in these\ncompounds. The calculations are in very good agreement with our measurements of\nphonon spectra and thermal expansion behavior as reported in the literature.\nOur calculations at high pressure further reveal that large difference in\nnegative thermal expansion behavior in these compounds is associated with the\ndifference of the unit cell volume.\n", "  We discuss a class of models with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking\ncharacterized by a non-unified messenger sector inducing non-standard gaugino\nmass ratios, as well as by additional contributions to the soft mass terms from\na matter-messenger coupling. The well-known effect of this coupling is to\ngenerate A-terms at one-loop level, hence raising the Higgs mass without\nrelying on super-heavy stops. At the same time, a hierarchy between Wino and\ngluino masses, as induced by the non-unified messenger fields, can greatly\nlower the radiative corrections to the Higgs soft mass term driven by the\nhigh-energy parameters, thus reducing the fine tuning. We search for models\nwith low fine tuning within this scenario, and we discuss the spectrum,\ncollider phenomenology, constraints, and prospects of the found solutions. We\nfind that some setups are accessible or already excluded by searches at the\nLarge Hadron Collider, and all our scenarios with a tuning better than about\n2\\% can be tested at the International Linear Collider.\n", "  Identifying influential nodes in networks is a significant and challenging\ntask. Among many centrality indices, the $k$-shell index performs very well in\nfinding out influential spreaders. However, the traditional method for\ncalculating the $k$-shell indices of nodes needs the global topological\ninformation, which limits its applications in large-scale dynamically growing\nnetworks. Recently, L\\@\\\"{u} \\emph{et al.} [Nature Communications 7 (2016)\n10168] proposed a novel asynchronous algorithm to calculate the $k$-shell\nindices, which is suitable to deal with large-scale growing networks. In this\npaper, we propose two algorithms to select nodes and update their intermediate\nvalues towards the $k$-shell indices, which can help in accelerating the\nconvergence of the calculation of $k$-shell indices. The former algorithm takes\ninto account the degrees of nodes while the latter algorithm prefers to choose\nthe node whose neighbors' values have been changed recently. We test these two\nmethods on four real networks and three artificial networks. The results\nsuggest that the two algorithms can respectively reduce the convergence time up\nto 75.4\\% and 92.9\\% in average, compared with the original asynchronous\nupdating algorithm.\n", "  Heat transport in open quantum systems is particularly susceptible to the\nmodeling of system-reservoir interactions. It thus requires to consistently\ntreat the coupling between a quantum system and its environment. While\nperturbative approaches are successfully used in fields like quantum optics and\nquantum information, they reveal deficiencies, typically in the context of\nthermodynamics, when it is essential to respect additional criteria such as\nfluctuation-dissipation theorems. We use a non-perturbative approach for\nquantum dissipative dynamics based on a stochastic Liouville-von Neumann\nequation to provide a very general and extremely efficient formalism for heat\ncurrents and its correlations in open harmonic chains. Specific results are\nderived not only for first but also for second order moments which requires to\naccount for both real and imaginary parts of bath-bath correlation functions.\nSpatiotemporal patterns are compared with weak coupling calculations. The\nregime of stronger system-reservoir couplings gives rise to an intimate\ninterplay between reservoir fluctuations and heat transfer far from\nequilibrium.\n", "  For nearly a century the universal logarithmic behaviour of the mean velocity\nprofile in a parallel flow was a mainstay of turbulent fluid mechanics and its\nteaching. Yet many experiments and numerical simulations are not fit\nexceedingly well by it, and the question whether the logarithmic law is indeed\nuniversal keeps turning up in discussion and in writing. Large experiments have\nbeen set up in different parts of the world to confirm or deny the logarithmic\nlaw and accurately estimate von K\\'arm\\'an's constant, the coefficient that\ngoverns it. We show that the discrepancy among flows in different (circular or\nplane) geometries, and between these and the logarithmic law, can be ascribed\nto the effect of the pressure gradient. When this effect is accounted for in\nthe form of a higher-order perturbation, universal agreement and a\nsatisfactorily simple formulation are recovered.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium transport properties of a disordered\nmolecular nanowire. The nanowire is regarded as a quasi-one-dimensional organic\ncrystal composed of self-assembled molecules. One orbital and a single random\nenergy are assigned to each molecule while the intermolecular coupling does not\nfluctuate. Consequently, electronic states are expected to be spatially\nlocalized. We consider the regime of strong localization, namely, the\nlocalization length is smaller than the length of the molecular wire.\nElectron-vibron interaction, taking place in each single molecule, is also\ntaken into account. We investigate the interplay between disorder and\nelectron-vibron interaction in response to either an applied electric bias or a\ntemperature gradient. To this end, we calculate the electric and heat currents\nwhen the nanowire is connected to leads, using the Keldysh non-equilibrium\nGreen's function formalism. At intermediate temperature, scattering by disorder\ndominates both charge and heat transport. We find that the electron-vibron\ninteraction enhances the effect of the disorder on the transport properties due\nto the exponential suppression of tunneling.\n", "  Extragalactic observations of water emission can provide valuable insights\ninto the excitation of the interstellar medium. In addition, extragalactic\nmegamasers are powerful probes of kinematics close to active nuclei. Therefore,\nit is paramount to determine the true origin of the water emission, whether it\nis excited by processes close to an AGN or in star-forming regions. We use ALMA\nBand 5 science verification observations to analyse the emission of the 183 GHz\nwater line in Arp 220 on sub-arcsecond scales, in conjunction with new ALMA\nBand 7 data at 325 GHz. Specifically, the nature of the process leading to the\nexcitation of emission at these water lines is studied in this context.\nSupplementary 22 GHz VLA observations are used to better constrain the\nparameter space in the excitation modelling of the water lines. We detect 183\nGHz H2O and 325 GHz water emission towards the two compact nuclei at the center\nof Arp 220, being brighter in Arp 220 West. The emission at these two\nfrequencies is compared to previous single-dish data and does not show evidence\nof variability. The 183 and 325 GHz lines show similar spectra and kinematics,\nbut the 22 GHz profile is significantly different in both nuclei due to a blend\nwith an NH3 absorption line. Our findings suggest that the most likely scenario\nto cause the observed water emission in Arp 220 is a large number of\nindependent masers originating from numerous star-forming regions.\n", "  Open and hidden heavy-flavor physics in high-energy nuclear collisions are\nentering a new and exciting stage towards reaching a clearer understanding of\nthe new experimental results with the possibility to link them directly to the\nadvancement in lattice Quantum Chromo-dynamics (QCD). Recent results from\nexperiments and theoretical developments regarding open and hidden heavy-flavor\ndynamics have been debated at the Lorentz Workshop \"Tomography of the\nquark-gluon plasma with heavy quarks}, which was held in October 2016 in\nLeiden, the Netherlands. In this contribution, we summarize identified common\nunderstandings and developed strategies for the upcoming five years, which aim\nat achieving a profound knowledge of the dynamical properties of the\nquark-gluon plasma.\n", "  We explore the theoretical observation that within the leading twist\napproximation, the nuclear effects of shadowing and antishadowing in\nnon-perturbative nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) at the input QCD\nevolution scale involve diffraction on nucleons of a nuclear target and\noriginate from merging of two parton ladders belonging to two different\nnucleons, which are close in the rapidity space. It allows us to propose that\nfor a given momentum fraction $x_P$ carried by the diffractive exchange,\nnuclear shadowing and antishadowing should compensate each other in the\nmomentum sum rule for nPDFs locally on the interval $\\ln (x/x_P) \\le 1$. We\nrealize this by constructing an explicit model of nuclear gluon antishadowing,\nwhich has a wide support in $x$, $10^{-4} < x < 0.2$, peaks at $x=0.05-0.1$ at\nthe level of $\\approx 15$\\% for $^{208}$Pb at $Q_0^2=4$ GeV$^2$ and rather\ninsignificantly depends on details of the model. We also studied the impact\nparameter $b$ dependence of antishadowing and found it to be slow.\n", "  We evaluate the impact of domain-wall annihilation on the currently ongoing\nand planned gravitational wave experiments, including a case in which domain\nwalls experience a frictional force due to interactions with the ambient\nplasma. We show the sensitivity reach in terms of physical parameters, namely,\nthe wall tension and the annihilation temperature. We find that a Higgs portal\nscalar, which stabilizes the Higgs potential at high energy scales, can form\ndomain walls whose annihilation produces a large amount of gravitational waves\nwithin the reach of the advanced LIGO experiment (O5). Domain wall annihilation\ncan also generate baryon asymmetry if the scalar is coupled to either SU(2)$_L$\ngauge fields or the $(B-L)$ current. This is a variant of spontaneous\nbaryogenesis, but it naturally avoids the isocurvature constraint due to the\nscaling behavior of the domain-wall evolution. We delineate the parameter space\nwhere the domain-wall baryogenesis works successfully and discuss its\nimplications for the gravitational wave experiments.\n", "  We derive the hydrodynamic equations of motion for a fluid of active\nparticles described by under- damped Langevin equations that reduce to the\nActive-Brownian-Particle model, in the overdamped limit. The contraction into\nthe hydrodynamic description is performed by locally averaging the par- ticle\ndynamics with the non-equilibrium many-particle probability density, whose\nformal expression is found in the physically relevant limit of high-friction\nthrough a multiple-time-scale analysis. This approach permits to identify the\nconditions under which self-propulsion can be subsumed into the fluid stress\ntensor and thus to define systematically and unambiguously the local pressure\nof the active fluid.\n", "  A central result that arose in applying information theory to the stochastic\nthermodynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems is the Information-Processing\nSecond Law (IPSL): the physical entropy of the universe can decrease if\ncompensated by the Shannon-Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy change of appropriate\ninformation-carrying degrees of freedom. In particular, the asymptotic-rate\nIPSL precisely delineates the thermodynamic functioning of autonomous\nMaxwellian demons and information engines. How do these systems begin to\nfunction as engines, Landauer erasers, and error correctors? Here, we identify\na minimal, inescapable transient dissipation engendered by physical information\nprocessing not captured by asymptotic rates, but critical to adaptive\nthermodynamic processes such as found in biological systems. A component of\ntransient dissipation, we also identify an implementation-dependent cost that\nvaries from one physical substrate to another for the same information\nprocessing task. Applying these results to producing structured patterns from a\nstructureless information reservoir, we show that \"retrodictive\" generators\nachieve the minimal costs. The results establish the thermodynamic toll imposed\nby a physical system's structure as it comes to optimally transduce\ninformation.\n", "  In one dimension, the area law and its implications for the approximability\nby Matrix Product States are the key to efficient numerical simulations\ninvolving quantum states. Similarly, in simulations involving quantum\noperators, the approximability by Matrix Product Operators (in Hilbert-Schmidt\nnorm) is tied to an operator area law, namely the fact that the Operator Space\nEntanglement Entropy (OSEE)---the natural analog of entanglement entropy for\noperators, investigated by Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A 63, 040304(R) (2001)] and by\nProsen and Pizorn [Phys. Rev. A 76, 032316 (2007)]---, is bounded. In the\npresent paper, it is shown that the OSEE can be calculated in two-dimensional\nconformal field theory, in a number of situations that are relevant to\nquestions of simulability of long-time dynamics in one spatial dimension.\n  It is argued that: (i) thermal density matrices $\\rho \\propto e^{-\\beta H}$\nand Generalized Gibbs Ensemble density matrices $\\rho \\propto e^{- H_{\\rm\nGGE}}$ with local $H_{\\rm GGE}$ generically obey the operator area law; (ii)\nafter a global quench, the OSEE first grows linearly with time, then decreases\nback to its thermal or GGE saturation value, implying that, while the operator\narea law is satisfied both in the initial state and in the asymptotic\nstationary state at large time, it is strongly violated in the transient\nregime; (iii) the OSEE of the evolution operator $U(t) = e^{-i H t}$ increases\nlinearly with $t$, unless the Hamiltonian is in a localized phase; (iv) local\noperators in Heisenberg picture, $\\phi(t) = e^{i H t} \\phi e^{-i H t}$, have an\nOSEE that grows sublinearly in time (perhaps logarithmically), however it is\nunclear whether this effect can be captured in a traditional CFT framework, as\nthe free fermion case hints at an unexpected breakdown of conformal invariance.\n", "  We report on the thermodynamic, magnetic properties and the magnetic\nstructure of ludwigite-type Cu2MnBO5. The specific heat, the low-field\nmagnetization and the paramagnetic susceptibility were studied on a single\ncrystal and combined with powder neutron diffraction data. The temperature\ndependence of the specific heat and the neutron diffraction pattern reveal a\nsingle magnetic phase transition at T=92 K, which corresponds to the magnetic\nordering into a ferromagnetic phase. The cation distribution and the values and\ndirections of magnetic moments of ions in different crystallographic sites are\nestablished. The magnetic moments of Cu2+ and Mn3+ ions occupying different\nmagnetic sites in the ferrimagnetic phase are pairwise antiparallel and their\ndirections do not coincide with the directions of the principal\ncrystallographic axes.The small value of the magnetic moment of copper ions\noccupying site 2a is indicative of partial disordering of the magnetic moments\non this site. The magnetization measurements show a strong temperature\nhysteresis of magnetization, which evidences for field-dependent transitions\nbelow the phase transition temperature.\n", "  The current vacuum energy density observed as dark energy ${ \\rho }_{ \\rm\ndark }\\simeq 2.5\\times10^{-47}\\ {\\rm GeV^{4}}$ is unacceptably small compared\nwith any other scales. Therefore, we encounter serious fine-tuning problem and\ntheoretical difficulty to derive the dark energy. However, the theoretically\nattractive scenario has been proposed and discussed in literature: In terms of\nthe renormalization-group (RG) running of the cosmological constant, the vacuum\nenergy density can be expressed as ${ \\rho }_{ \\rm vacuum }\\simeq m^{2}H^{2}$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the scalar field and rather dynamical in curved\nspacetime. However, there has been no rigorous proof to derive this expression\nand there are some criticisms about the physical interpretation of the RG\nrunning cosmological constant. In the present paper, we revisit the RG running\neffects of the cosmological constant and investigate the renormalized vacuum\nenergy density in curved spacetime. We demonstrate that the vacuum energy\ndensity described by ${ \\rho }_{ \\rm vacuum }\\simeq m^{2}H^{2}$ appears as\nquantum effects of the curved background rather than the running effects of\ncosmological constant. Comparing to cosmological observational data, we obtain\nan upper bound on the mass of the scalar fields to be smaller than the Planck\nmass, $m \\lesssim M_{\\rm Pl}$.\n", "  We study the process of dark matter particles scattering off $^{3,4}$He with\nnuclear wave functions computed using an ab initio many-body framework. We\nemploy realistic nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and develop an ab initio scheme to compute\na general set of different nuclear response functions. In particular, we then\nperform an accompanying uncertainty quantification on these quantities and\nstudy error propagation to physical observables. We find a rich structure of\nallowed nuclear responses with significant uncertainties for certain\nspin-dependent interactions. The approach and results that are presented in\nthis Paper establish a new framework for nuclear structure calculations and\nuncertainty quantification in the context of direct and (certain) indirect\nsearches for dark matter.\n", "  In twin Higgs models, a discrete Z2 symmetry between the standard model Higgs\nand the twin Higgs is introduced to address the hierarchy problem. In this\nwork, we propose another discrete symmetry in twin Higgs: the T parity, which\nmaps the twin Higgs quadruplet into its mirror copy. The T parity brings us a\nwhole group of T-odd particles, and leads to a promising dark matter candidate.\nWe present one realization of the T parity twin Higgs scenario by implementing\nthe $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_1 \\times U(1)_2$ gauge symmetry in twin\nHiggs model. In this specific setup, the T-odd U(1) gauge boson could be the\ndark matter candidate, and the T-odd particles have very distinct and\ninteresting phenomenology.\n", "  As an extension of recent work on two-dimensional light-front $\\phi^4$\ntheory, we implement Fock-sector dependence for the bare mass. Such dependence\nshould have important consequences for the convergence of nonperturbative\ncalculations with respect to the level of Fock-space truncation. The truncation\nforces the self-energy corrections to be sector-dependent; in particular, the\nhighest sector has no self-energy correction. Thus, the bare mass can be\nconsidered sector dependent as well. We find that, although higher Fock sectors\nhave a larger probability, the mass of the lightest state and the value of the\ncritical coupling are not significantly affected. This implies that coherent\nstates or the light-front coupled-cluster method may be required to properly\nrepresent critical behavior.\n", "  This paper applies variational data assimilation to inundation problems\ngoverned by the shallow water equations with wetting and drying. The objective\nof the assimilation is to recover an unknown time-varying wave profile at an\nopen ocean boundary from inundation observations. This problem is solved with\nderivative-based optimisation and an adjoint wetting and drying scheme to\nefficiently compute sensitivity information. The capabilities of this approach\nare demonstrated on an idealised sloping beach setup in which the profile of an\nincoming wave is reconstructed from wet/dry interface observations. The method\nis robust against noisy observations if a regularisation term is added to the\noptimisation objective. Finally, the method is applied to a laboratory\nexperiment of the Hokkaido-Nansei-Oki tsunami, where the wave profile is\nreconstructed with an error of less than 1% of the reference wave signal.\n", "  We model an isothermal aggregation process of particles/atoms interacting\naccording to the Lennard-Jones pair potential by mapping the energy landscapes\nof each cluster size $N$ onto stochastic networks, computing transition\nprobabilities {from} the network for an $N$-particle cluster to the one for\n$N+1$, and connecting these networks into a single joint network. The\nattachment rate is a control parameter. The resulting network representing the\naggregation of up to 14 particles contains {6427} vertices. It is not only\ntime-irreversible but also reducible. To analyze its transient dynamics, we\nintroduce the sequence of the expected initial and pre-attachment distributions\nand compute them for a wide range of attachment rates and three values of\ntemperature. As a result, we find the {configurations most likely to be\nobserved} in the process of aggregation for each cluster size. We examine the\nattachment process and conduct a structural analysis of the sets of local\nenergy minima for every cluster size. We show that both processes taking place\nin the network, attachment and relaxation, lead to the dominance of icosahedral\npacking in small (up to 14 atom) clusters.\n", "  We demonstrated the tuning of whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of a silica\nmicrosphere during optical levitation through the annealing process. We\ndetermined the annealing temperature from the power balance between the CO2\nlaser light heating and several cooling processes. Cooling caused by heat\nconduction through the surrounding air molecules is the dominant process. We\nachieved a blue shift of the WGMs as large as 1 \\%, which was observed in the\nwhite-light scattering spectrum from the levitated microsphere.\n", "  Fluctuations are strong in mesoscopic systems and have to be taken into\naccount for the description of transport. We show that they can even be used as\na resource for the operation of a system as a device. We use the physics of\nsingle-electron tunneling to propose a bipartite device working as a thermal\ntransistor. Charge and heat currents in a two terminal conductor can be gated\nby thermal fluctuations from a third terminal to which it is capacitively\ncoupled. The gate system can act as a switch that injects neither charge nor\nenergy into the conductor hence achieving huge amplification factors.\nNon-thermal properties of the tunneling electrons can be exploited to operate\nthe device with no energy consumption.\n", "  We study the energy conditions in the framework of the modi- fied gravity\nwith higher-derivative torsional terms in the action. We discuss the viability\nof the model by studying the energy conditions in terms of the cosmographical\nparameters like Hubble, deceleration, jerk, snap and lerk parameters. In\nparticular, We consider two spe- cific models that are proposed in literature\nand examine the viability bounds imposed by the weak energy condition.\n", "  We construct the electromagnetic anomaly effective term for a generalized\nlinear sigma model with two chiral nonets, one with a quark-antiquark\nstructure, the other one with a four quark content. We compute in the leading\norder of this framework the decays into two photons of six pseudoscalars:\n$\\pi_0(137)$, $\\pi_0(1300)$, $\\eta(547)$, $\\eta(958)$, $\\eta(1295)$ and\n$\\eta(1760)$. Our results agree well with the available experimental data.\n", "  High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HR-EELS) is utilized to\nprobe the surface spin canting in nanoparticles of two technologically\nimportant magnetic materials, i.e. Fe3O4 and CoFe2O4 (CFO). A soft experimental\ntechnique is developed that is capable of extracting EELS spectra with one\natomic plane resolution recorded in a single frame. This yields information at\ndifferent depth of the nanoparticle from the surface to the core regions with\nhigh signal to noise ratio and without beam damage. This enables comparing the\nfine structures between the surface and core regions of the nanoparticles. The\nresults confirm earlier observations of uniformly oriented spin canting\nstructure for CFO with additional information on atom site-selective spin\ncanting information. In case of Fe3O4 preferred canting orientation forming\ncore and shell structure is deduced. Unlike earlier reports based on polarized\nspin-flip neutron scattering measurement, it is possible to narrow down the\npossible canting angles for Fe3O4 (Td, Oh tilts 40{\\deg}, 40{\\deg}) and CFO\n(Td, Oh tilts 17{\\deg}, 17{\\deg}) from the experimental spectra combined with\nthe first principle based calculation considering non-collinear magnetism. In\naddition, the role of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in stabilizing the spin\ncanting at the nanoparticle surface is discussed. The results demonstrate that\nHREELS can be a powerful technique to probe the magnetic structure in\nnano-dimensional systems and has advantages over neutron based techniques in\nterms of superior spatial resolution, site specific information and easy of\nsample preparation.\n", "  We continue the study of the gl(1|1) Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the one, two, three and four point\nfunctions are analyzed, for vertex operators corresponding to typical and\nprojective representations. We illustrate their interplay with the logarithmic\nglobal conformal Ward identities. We compute the four point function for one\nprojective and three typical representations. Three coupled first order\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations are integrated consecutively in terms of\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions, and we assemble the solutions into a\nlocal correlator. Moreover, we prove crossing symmetry of the four point\nfunction of four typical representations at generic momenta. Throughout, the\nmap between the gl(1|1) Wess-Zumino-Witten model and symplectic fermions is\nexploited and extended.\n", "  Amorphous solids increase their stress as a function of an applied strain\nuntil a mechanical yield point whereupon the stress cannot increase anymore,\nafterwards exhibiting a steady state with a constant mean stress. In stress\ncontrolled experiments the system simply breaks when pushed beyond this mean\nstress. The ubiquity of this phenomenon over a huge variety of amorphous solids\ncalls for a generic theory that is free of microscopic details. Here we offer\nsuch a theory: the mechanical yield is a thermodynamic phase transition, where\nyield occurs as a spinodal phenomenon. At the spinodal point there exists a\ndivergent correlation length which is associated with the system-spanning\ninstabilities (known also as shear bands) which are typical to the mechanical\nyield. The theory, the order parameter used and the correlation functions which\nexhibit the divergent correlation length are universal in nature and can be\napplied to any amorphous solids that undergo mechanical yield.\n", "  Vorticity of matter generated in noncentral heavy-ion collisions at energies\nof the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) at the Joint Institute for\nNuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is studied. Simulations are performed within\nthe model of the three-fluid dynamics (3FD) which reproduces the major part of\nbulk observables at these energies. Comparison with earlier calculations is\ndone. Qualitative pattern of the vorticity evolution is analyzed. It is\ndemonstrated that the vorticity is mainly located at the border between\nparticipants and spectators. In particular, this implies that the relative\n$\\Lambda$-hyperon polarization should be stronger at rapidities of the\nfragmentation regions than that in the midrapidity region.\n", "  We investigate the phase transition dynamics of a quasi-2D antiferromagnetic\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from the easy-axis polar phase to the\neasy-plane polar phase, which is initiated by suddenly changing the sign of the\nquadratic Zeeman energy $q$. We observe the emergence and decay of spin\nturbulence and the formation of half-quantum vortices (HQVs) in the quenched\ncondensate. The characteristic time and length scales of the turbulence\ngeneration dynamics are proportional to $|q|^{-1/2}$ as inherited from the\ndynamic instability of the initial state. In the evolution of the spin\nturbulence, spin wave excitations develop from large to small length scales,\nsuggesting a direct energy cascade, and the spin population for the axial polar\ndomains exhibit a nonexponential decay. The final equilibrated condensate\ncontains HQVs, and the number is found to increase and saturate with increasing\n$|q|$. Our results demonstrate the time-space scaling properties of the phase\ntransition dynamics near the critical point and the peculiarities of the spin\nturbulence state of the antiferromagnetic spinor condensate.\n", "  Contrary to prevailing notion we find that the spectrum associated with the\nextended states in a complex system may belong to the Poisson universality\nclass if the system is subjected to a specific set of constraints. Our results\nare based on an exact theoretical as well as numerical analysis of column\nconstrained chiral ensembles with circulant off-diagonal blocks and are\nrelevant for a complete understanding of the eigenfunction localization and\nrelated physical properties.\n", "  Photostriction is predicted for SnS and SnSe monolayers, two-dimensional\nferroelectrics with rectangular unit cells (the lattice vector $\\mathbf{a}_1$\nis larger than $\\mathbf{a}_2$) and an intrinsic dipole moment parallel to\n$\\mathbf{a}_1$. Photostriction in these two-dimensional materials is found to\nbe induced by a screened electric polarization in the photoexcited electronic\nstate (i.e., a converse piezoelectric effect) that leads to a compression of\n$a_1$ and a comparatively smaller increase of $a_2$ for a reduced unit cell\narea. The structural change documented here is ten times larger than that\nobserved in BiFeO$_3$, making monochalcogenide monolayers an ultimate platform\nfor this effect. This structural modification should be observable under\nexperimentally feasible densities of photexcited carriers on samples that have\nbeen grown already, having a potential usefulness for light-induced, remote\nmechano-opto-electronic applications.\n", "  We conjecture the universal probability distribution at large time for the\none-point height in the 1D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) stochastic growth\nuniversality class, with initial conditions interpolating from any one of the\nthree main classes (droplet, flat, stationary) on the left, to another on the\nright, allowing for drifts and also for a step near the origin. The result is\nobtained from a replica Bethe ansatz calculation starting from the KPZ\ncontinuum equation, together with a \"decoupling assumption\" in the large time\nlimit. Some cases are checked to be equivalent to previously known results from\nother models in the same class, which provides a test of the method, others\nappear to be new. In particular we obtain the crossover distribution between\nflat and stationary initial conditions (crossover from Airy$_1$ to Airy$_{{\\rm\nstat}}$) in a simple compact form.\n", "  QCD at nonzero baryon chemical potential suffers from the sign problem, due\nto the complex quark determinant. Complex Langevin dynamics can provide a\nsolution, provided certain conditions are met. One of these conditions,\nholomorphicity of the Langevin drift, is absent in QCD since zeroes of the\ndeterminant result in a meromorphic drift. We first derive how poles in the\ndrift affect the formal justification of the approach and then explore the\nvarious possibilities in simple models. The lessons from these are subsequently\napplied to both heavy dense QCD and full QCD, and we find that the results\nobtained show a consistent picture. We conclude that with careful monitoring,\nthe method can be justified a posteriori, even in the presence of\nmeromorphicity.\n", "  A comprehensive theoretical analysis of photo-induced forces in an\nilluminated nanojunction, formed between an atomic force microscopy tip and a\nsample, is presented. The formalism is valid within the dipolar approximation\nand includes multiple scattering effects between the tip, sample and a planar\nsubstrate through a dyadic Green's function approach. This physically intuitive\ndescription allows a detailed look at the quantitative contribution of multiple\nscattering effects to the measured photo-induced force, effects that are\ntypically unaccounted for in simpler analytical models. Our findings show that\nthe presence of the planar substrate and anisotropy of the tip have a\nsubstantial effect on the magnitude and the spectral response of the\nphoto-induced force exerted on the tip. Unlike previous models, our\ncalculations predict photo-induced forces that are within range of\nexperimentally measured values in photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM)\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the motion of magnetic skyrmions in a nanowire induced by a\nspin-wave current $J$ flowing out of a driving layer close to the edge of the\nwire. By applying micromagnetic simulation and an analysis of the effective\nThiele equation, we find that the skyrmion trajectory is governed by an\ninterplay of both forces due to the magnon current and the wire boundary. The\nskyrmion is attracted to the driving layer and is accelerated by the repulsive\nforce due to the wire boundary. We consider both cases of a driving\nlongitudinal and transverse to the nanowire, but a steady-state motion of the\nskyrmion is only obtained for a transverse magnon current. For the latter case,\nwe find in the limit of low current densities $J$ the velocity-current relation\n$v \\sim J/\\alpha$ where $v$ is the skyrmion velocity and $\\alpha$ is the\nGilbert damping. For large $J$ in case of strong driving, the skyrmion is\npushed into the driving layer resulting in a drop of the skyrmion velocity and,\neventually, the destruction of the skyrmion.\n", "  The linear response is investigated in a long-range Hamiltonian system from\nthe view point of dynamics, which is described by the Vlasov equation in the\nlimit of large population. Due to existence of the Casimir invariants of the\nVlasov dynamics, an external field does not drive the system to the forced\nthermal equilibrium in general, and the linear response is suppressed. With the\naid of a linear response theory based on the Vlasov dynamics, we compute the\nsuppressed linear response in a system having two order parameters, which\nintroduce the conjugate two external fields and the susceptibility matrix of\nsize two accordingly. Moreover, the two order parameters bring three phases and\nthe three types of second-order phase transitions between two of them. For each\ntype of the phase transitions, all the critical exponents for elements of the\nsusceptibility matrix are computed. The critical exponents reveal that some\nelements of the matrices do not diverge even at critical points, while the\nmean-field theory predicts divergences. The linear response theory also\nsuggests appearance of negative off-diagonal elements, in other words, an\napplied external field decreases the value of an order parameter. These\ntheoretical predictions are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the\nVlasov equation.\n", "  Ionic liquids are solvent-free electrolytes, some of which possess an\nintriguing self-assembly property. Using a mean-field framework (based on\nOnsager's relations) we show that bulk nano-structures arise via type-I and II\nphase transitions (PT), which directly affect the electrical double layer (EDL)\nstructure. Ginzburg-Landau equation is derived and PT are related to\ntemperature, potential and interactions. The type-I PT occurs for geometrically\ndissimilar anion/cation ratio and, surprisingly, is induced by perturbations on\norder of thermal fluctuations. Finally, we compare the insights with the\ndecaying charge layers within the EDL, as widely observed in experiments.\n", "  In the framework of supersymmetry, when $R$-parity is violated the Higgs\ndoublet superfield $H_d$ can be interpreted as another doublet of leptons,\nsince all of them have the same quantum numbers. Thus Higgs scalars are\nsleptons and Higgsinos are leptons. We argue that this interpretation can be\nextended to the second Higgs doublet superfield $H_u$, when right-handed\nneutrinos are assumed to exist. As a consequence, we advocate that this is the\nminimal construction where the two Higgs doublets can be interpreted in a\nnatural way as a fourth family of lepton superfields, and that this is more\nsatisfactory than the usual situation in supersymmetry where the Higgses are\n`disconnected' from the rest of the matter and do not have a three-fold\nreplication. On the other hand, in analogy with the first three families where\nfor each lepton representation there is a quark counterpart, we propose a\npossible extension of this minimal model including a vector-like quark doublet\nrepresentation as part of the fourth family. We also discuss the phenomenology\nof the associated new quarks.\n", "  We consider a scenario where time dependence on physical parameters is\nintroduced by the misalignment of an ultra-light scalar field. The initial VEV\nof such field at the early time remains a constant until Hubble becomes\ncomparable to its mass. Interesting cosmological consequences are considered.\nLight sterile neutrinos hinted by terrestrial neutrino experiments are studied\nas a benchmark model. We show the BBN constraints can be easily avoided in this\nscenario, even if reheating temperature is high. The scalar can be naturally\nlight in spite of its couplings to other fields. Parameters of sterile neutrino\nmay remain changing with time nowadays. This can further relax the tension from\nthe recent IceCube constraints.\n", "  We introduce diffusively coupled networks where the dynamical system at each\nvertex is planar Hamiltonian. The problems we address are synchronisation and\nan analogue of diffusion-driven Turing instability for time-dependent\nhomogeneous states. As a consequence of the underlying Hamiltonian structure\nthere exist unusual behaviours compared with networks of coupled limit cycle\noscillators or activator-inhibitor systems.\n", "  This work, which extends Squire et al. [ApJL, 830 L25 (2016)], explores the\neffect of self-generated pressure anisotropy on linearly polarized\nshear-Alfv\\'en fluctuations in low-collisionality plasmas. Such anisotropies\nlead to stringent limits on the amplitude of magnetic perturbations in\nhigh-beta plasmas, above which a fluctuation can destabilize itself through the\nparallel firehose instability. This causes the wave frequency to approach zero,\n\"interrupting\" the wave and stopping its oscillation. These effects are\nexplored in detail in the collisionless and weakly collisional \"Braginskii\"\nregime, for both standing and traveling waves. The focus is on simplified\nmodels in one dimension, on scales much larger than the ion gyroradius. The\neffect has interesting implications for the physics of magnetized turbulence in\nthe high-beta conditions that are prevalent in many astrophysical plasmas.\n", "  We study the influence of the electron-magnon interaction on the particle\ntransport in strongly disordered systems. The analysis is based on results\nobtained for a single hole in the one-dimensional t-J model. Unless there\nexists a mechanism that localizes spin excitations, the charge carrier remains\ndelocalized even for a very strong disorder and shows subdiffusive motion up to\nthe longest accessible times. However, upon inspection of the propagation times\nbetween neighboring sites as well as a careful finite-size scaling we\nconjecture that the anomalous subdiffusive transport may be transient and\nshould eventually evolve into a normal diffusive motion.\n", "  Generalising the results in arXiv:1612.00281, we construct\ninfinite-dimensional families of non-singular stationary space times, solutions\nof Yang-Mills-Higgs-Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-dilaton-scalar field\nequations with a negative cosmological constant. The families include an\ninfinite-dimensional family of solutions with the usual AdS conformal structure\nat conformal infinity.\n", "  We investigate the effect of strong interactions on the spectral properties\nof quantum wires with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a magnetic field,\nusing a combination of Matrix Product State and bosonization techniques.\nQuantum wires with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction and magnetic field\nexhibit a partial gap in one-half of the conducting modes. Such systems have\nattracted wide-spread experimental and theoretical attention due to their\nunusual physical properties, among which are spin-dependent transport, or a\ntopological superconducting phase when under the proximity effect of an s-wave\nsuperconductor. As a microscopic model for the quantum wire we study an\nextended Hubbard model with spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman field. We obtain\nspin resolved spectral densities from the real-time evolution of excitations,\nand calculate the phase diagram. We find that interactions increase the pseudo\ngap at $k = 0$ and thus also enhance the Majorana-supporting phase and\nstabilize the helical spin order. Furthermore, we calculate the optical\nconductivity and compare it with the low energy spiral Luttinger Liquid result,\nobtained from field theoretical calculations. With interactions, the optical\nconductivity is dominated by an excotic excitation of a bound\nsoliton-antisoliton pair known as a breather state. We visualize the\noscillating motion of the breather state, which could provide the route to\ntheir experimental detection in e.g. cold atom experiments.\n", "  Based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), strongly correlated\nquantum many-body systems at finite temperatures can be simulated by sampling\nover a certain class of pure matrix product states (MPS) called minimally\nentangled typical thermal states (METTS). When a system features symmetries,\nthese can be utilized to substantially reduce MPS computation costs. It is\nconceptually straightforward to simulate canonical ensembles using symmetric\nMETTS. In practice, it is important to alternate between different symmetric\ncollapse bases to decrease autocorrelations in the Markov chain of METTS. To\nthis purpose, we introduce symmetric Fourier and Haar-random block bases that\nare efficiently mixing. We also show how grand-canonical ensembles can be\nsimulated efficiently with symmetric METTS. We demonstrate these approaches for\nspin-1/2 XXZ chains and discuss how the choice of the collapse bases influences\nautocorrelations as well as the distribution of measurement values and, hence,\nconvergence speeds.\n", "  We have found that the Berry phase of bilayer graphene becomes from 2$\\pi$\nestimated by Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations when the A-B stacked pristine\nbilayer graphene experiences the Li-intercalation and sequential Li-desorption\nprocess in ultrahigh vacuum. Furthermore, the mobility of such processed\nbilayer graphene increases around four times larger, ~ 8,000 cm2/V$\\cdot$s,\nthan that of the pristine bilayer graphene. This is mainly due to increment of\nthe scattering time and decrement of the cyclotron mass, which can be\ninterpreted as a result of the change of the stacking structure of bilayer\ngraphene from A-B to A-A, corresponding to a change from the parabolic to the\nlinear band dispersion.\n", "  In this work, we investigate how the presence of initial entanglement affects\nenergy transport in a network. The network have sites dedicated to incoherent\ninput or output of energy and intermediate control sites where initial\nentanglement can be established. For short times, we found that initial\nentanglement in the control sites provides a robust efficiency enhancer for\nenergy transport. For longer times, dephasing considerably damps the quantum\ncorrelations, and the advantage of having initial entanglement tends to\ndisappear in favor of the well known mechanism of noise-assisted transport. We\ncareful study these two mechanisms in this work, and we believe our findings\nmay be usuful for a better understanding of the relation between\nnonclassicality and transport, a topic of potential interest for quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  Recently, at least 50 million of novel examples of compact $G_2$ holonomy\nmanifolds have been constructed as twisted connected sums of asymptotically\ncylindrical Calabi-Yau threefolds. The purpose of this paper is to study mirror\nsymmetry for compactifications of Type II superstrings in this context. We\nfocus on $G_2$ manifolds obtained from building blocks constructed from dual\npairs of tops, which are the closest to toric CY hypersurfaces, and formulate\nthe analogue of the Batyrev mirror map for this class of $G_2$ holonomy\nmanifolds, thus obtaining several millions of novel dual superstring\nbackgrounds. In particular, this leads us to conjecture a plethora of novel\nexact dualities among the corresponding 2d N=1 sigma models.\n", "  We propose a new order parameter of a $Z_N$ symmetry in SU(N) gauge theories\nin $4$ dimensional Minkowski space-time, assuming spatial periodic boundary\nconditions. It is given by $Tr(P\\exp(i\\int_c A_{\\mu}dx^{\\mu}))$ where the\nspatial path $c$ is taken, for example, along $x_1$ axis. The parameter\nvanishes when the $Z_N$ symmetry is preserved. We calculate the contribution of\nQCD monopoles to the order parameter and show that when the monopoles condense\n$\\langle\\Phi\\rangle\\neq 0$, it vanishes, while it does not vanish when they do\nnot condense. These calculations are performed using a monopole field $\\Phi$\ncanonically quantized in a model of dual superconductor.\n", "  Using $4.479 \\times 10^{8}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector, we search for the decays $\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow\ne^{+}e^{-}\\chi_{c0,1,2}$ and $\\chi_{c0,1,2} \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}J/\\psi$. The\ndecays $\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\\chi_{c0,1,2}$ and $\\chi_{c0,1,2}\n\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}J/\\psi$ are observed for the first time. The measured\nbranching fractions are $\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow\ne^{+}e^{-}\\chi_{c0,1,2}) = (11.7 \\pm 2.5 \\pm 1.0)\\times10^{-4}$, $(8.6 \\pm 0.3\n\\pm 0.6)\\times10^{-4}$, $(6.9 \\pm 0.5 \\pm 0.6)\\times10^{-4}$, and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0,1,2} \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}J/\\psi) = (1.51 \\pm 0.30 \\pm\n0.13)\\times10^{-4}$, $(3.73 \\pm 0.09 \\pm 0.25)\\times10^{-3}$, $(2.48 \\pm 0.08\n\\pm 0.16)\\times10^{-3}$. The ratios of the branching fractions\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow\ne^{+}e^{-}\\chi_{c0,1,2})}{\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686) \\rightarrow\n\\gamma\\chi_{c0,1,2})}$ and $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0,1,2} \\rightarrow\ne^{+}e^{-}J/\\psi)}{\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0,1,2} \\rightarrow \\gamma J/\\psi)}$ are\nalso reported.\n", "  We discuss a possible link between the recently observed macroscopic ordering\nof ultra cold dipolar excitons (MOES) and the phenomenon of supersolidity. In\nthe dilute limit we predict a stable supersolid state for a\nquasi-one-dimensional system of bosonic dipoles characterized by two- and\nthree-body contact repulsion. We phenomenologically extend our theory to the\nstrongly-correlated regime and find a critical value of the contact interaction\nparameter at which the supersolid exhibits a quantum phase transition to a\nfragmented state. The wavelength of the fragmented-condensate solid is defined\nby the balance between the quantum pressure and the entropy due to fluctuations\nof the relative phases between the fragments. Our model appears to be in good\nagreement with the relevant experimental data, including the very recent\nresults on commensurability effect and wavelength of the MOES.\n", "  Tapered and dispersion managed (DM) silicon nanophotonic waveguides are\ninvestigated for the generation of optimal ultra broadband supercontinuum (SC).\nDM waveguides are structures showing a longitudinally dependent group velocity\ndispersion that results from the variation of the waveguide width with the\npropagation distance. For the generation of optimal SC, a genetic algorithm has\nbeen used to find the best dispersion map. This allows for the generation of\nhighly coherent supercontinuums that span over 1.14 octaves from 1300 nm to\n2860 nm and 1.25 octaves from 1200 nm to 2870 nm at -20 dB level for the\ntapered and DM waveguides respectively, for a 2 $\\mu$m, 200 fs and 6.4 pJ input\npulse. The comparison of these two structures with the usually considered\noptimal fixed width waveguide shows that the SC is broader and flatter in the\nmore elaborated DM waveguide, while the high coherence is ensured by the\nvarying dispersion.\n", "  We identify two orthogonal sources of structural entropy in rattler-free\ngranular systems - affine, involving structural changes that only deform the\ncontact network, and topological, corresponding to different topologies of the\ncontact network. We show that a recently developed connectivity-based granular\nstatistical mechanics separates the two naturally by identifying the structural\ndegrees of freedom with spanning trees on the graph of the contact network. We\nextend the connectivity-based formalism to include constraints on, and\ncorrelations between, degrees of freedom as interactions between branches of\nthe spanning tree. We then use the statistical mechanics formalism to calculate\nthe partition function generally and the different entropies in the\nhigh-angoricity limit. We also calculate the degeneracy of the affine entropy\nand a number of expectation values. From the latter, we derive an equipartition\nprinciple and an equation of state relating the macroscopic volume and boundary\nstress to the analogue of the temperature, the contactivity.\n", "  We consider the problem of light transmission from a high refractive index\nmedium into a low index environment. While total internal reflection severely\nlimits such transmission in systems with smooth interfaces, diffractive\nmetasurfaces may help out-couple light that enters an interface at blazing\nangles. We demonstrate that the profile of the structured interface can be\nnumerically optimized to target a particular emission pattern. Our study\nsuggests that while metasurfaces can help to out-couple light from a range of\nincident directions, there exists a universal limit for total transmission\nefficiency that depends only on the dielectric properties of the two materials\nand is independent of the profile and the composition of the metasurface\ncoupler.\n", "  The production of the $f_1(1285)$ resonance in the reaction of $\\gamma p\n\\rightarrow f_1(1285) p$ is investigated within a Regge-effective Lagrangian\napproach. Besides the contributions of the $t$-channel $\\rho$ and $\\omega$\ntrajectories exchanges, we also take into account the contributions of\n$s/u$-channel $N(2300)$ terms, $s/u$-channel nucleon terms, and the contact\nterm. By fitting to the CLAS data, we find that the $s$-channel $N(2300)$ term\nplays an important role in this reaction. We predict the total cross section\nfor this reaction, and find a clear bump structure around $W=2.3$ GeV, which is\nassociated with the $N(2300)$ state. The reaction of $\\gamma p \\to f_1(1285) p$\ncould be useful to further study of the $N(2300)$ experimentally.\n", "  Collective excitations of a hot QCD medium are the main focus of the present\narticle. The analysis is performed within semi-classical transport theory with\nisotropic and anisotropic momentum distribution functions for the gluonic and\nquark-antiquark degrees of freedom that constitutes the hot QCD plasma. The\nisotropic/equilibrium momentum distributions for gluons and quarks are based on\na recent quasi-particle description of hot QCD equations of state. The\nanisotropic distributions are just the extensions of isotropic ones by\nstretching or squeezing them in one of the directions. The hot QCD medium\neffects in the model adopted here enter through the effective gluon and quark\nfugacities along with non-trivial dispersion relations leading to an effective\nQCD coupling constant. Interestingly, with these distribution functions the\ntensorial structure of the gluon polarization tensor in the medium turned out\nto be similar to the one for the non-interacting ultra-relativistic system of\nquarks/antiquarks and gluons . The interactions mainly modify the Debye mass\nparameter and , in turn, the effective coupling in the medium. These\nmodifications have been seen to modify the collective modes of the hot QCD\nplasma in a significant way.\n", "  We present a manifestly T-dual formulation of curved spaces such as an AdS\nspace. For group manifolds related by the orthogonal vielbein fields the three\nform H=dB in the doubled space is universal at least locally. We construct an\naffine nondegenerate doubled bosonic AdS algebra to define the AdS space with\nthe Ramond-Ramond flux. The non-zero commutator of the left and right momenta\nleads to that the left momentum is in an AdS space while the right momentum is\nin a dS space. Dimensional reduction constraints and the physical AdS algebra\nare shown to preserve all the doubled coordinates.\n", "  This literature review addresses inductive pulsed power generators and their\nmajor components. Different inductive storage designs like solenoids, toroids\nand force-balanced coils are briefly presented and their advantages and\ndisadvantages are mentioned. Special emphasis is given to inductive circuit\ntopologies which have been investigated in railgun research such as the XRAM,\nmeat grinder or pulse transformer topologies. One section deals with opening\nswitches as they are indispensable for inductive storages and another one deals\nbriefly with SMES for pulsed power applications. In the end, the most relevant\ninductor systems which were realized in respect to railgun research are\nsummarized in a table, together with its main characteristics.\n", "  Ultrasound Atomic Force Microscopy (US-AFM) has been used for subsurface\nimaging of nanostructures. The contact stiffness variations have been suggested\nas the origin of the image contrast. Therefore, to analyze the image contrast,\nthe local changes in the contact stiffness due to the presence of subsurface\nfeatures should be calculated. So far, only static simulations have been\nconducted to analyze the local changes in the contact stiffness and,\nconsequently, the contrast in US-AFM. Such a static approach does not fully\nrepresent the real US-AFM experiment, where an ultrasound wave is launched\neither into the sample or at the tip, which modulates the contact stiffness.\nThis is a time-dependent nonlinear dynamic problem rather than a static and\nstationary one. This letter presents dynamic 3D ultrasound analysis of contact\nstiffness in US-AFM (in contrast to static analysis) to realistically predict\nthe changes in contact stiffness and thus the changes in the subsurface image\ncontrast. The modulation frequency also influences the contact stiffness\nvariations and, thus, the image contrast. The three-dimensional time-dependent\nultrasound analysis will greatly aid in the contrast optimization of subsurface\nnanoimaging with US-AFM.\n", "  Clogging raises as the principal phenomenon during many evacuation processes\nof pedestrians in a panic situation. As people push to escape from danger,\ncompression forces may increase to harming levels. Many individuals might fall\ndown, while others will try to dodge the fallen people, or, simply pass through\nthem. We studied the dynamics of the crowd for these situations, in the context\nof the \"social force model\". We modeled the unconscious (fallen) pedestrians as\ninanimate bodies that can be dodged (or not) by the surrounding individuals. We\nfound that new morphological structures appear along the evacuating crowd.\nUnder specific conditions, these structures may enhance the evacuation\nperformance. The pedestrian's willings for either dodging or passing through\nthe unconscious individuals play a relevant role in the overall evacuation\nperformance.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the dynamics of a Josephson junction in the\nframework of the RSJ model. We consider a junction that hosts two supercurrrent\ncontributions: a $2\\pi$- and a $4\\pi$-periodic in phase, with intensities\n$I_{2\\pi}$ and $I_{4\\pi}$ respectively. We study the size of the Shapiro steps\nas a function of the ratio of the intensity of the mentioned contributions,\ni.e. $I_{4\\pi}/I_{2\\pi}$. We provide detailed explanations where to expect\nclear signatures of the presence of the $4\\pi$-periodic contribution as a\nfunction of the external parameters: the intensity AC-bias $I_\\text{ac}$ and\nfrequency $\\omega_\\text{ac}$. On the one hand, in the low AC-intensity regime\n(where $I_\\text{ac}$ is much smaller than the critical current, $I_\\text{c}$),\nwe find that the non-linear dynamics of the junction allows the observation of\nonly even Shapiro steps even in the unfavorable situation where\n$I_{4\\pi}/I_{2\\pi}\\ll 1$. On the other hand, in the opposite limit\n($I_\\text{ac}\\gg I_\\text{c}$), even and odd Shapiro steps are present.\nNevertheless, even in this regime, we find signatures of the\n$4\\pi$-supercurrent in the beating pattern of the even step sizes as a function\nof $I_\\text{ac}$.\n", "  The Immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity is a one parameter ambiguity of\nthe theory whose precise interpretation is not universally agreed upon. It is\nan inherent characteristic of the quantum theory as it appears in the spectra\nof geometric operators, despite being irrelevant at the classical level. The\nparameter's appearance in the area and volume spectra to the same power as the\nPlanck area suggest that it plays a role in determining the fundamental length\nscale of space. In fact, a consistent interpretation is that it represents a\nconstant rescaling of the kinematical spatial geometry. An interesting\nrealization is that promoting the Immirzi parameter to be a general conformal\ntransformation leads to a system which can be identified as analogous to the\nlinking theory of shape dynamics. A three-dimensional gravitational gauge\nconnection is then constructed within the linking theory in a manner analogous\nto loop quantum gravity, thereby facilitating the application of the\nestablished procedure of loop quantization.\n", "  We investigate how the quantum control of a two-level system (TLS) coupled to\nphotons can modify and tune the TLS's photon absorption spectrum. Tuning and\ncontrolling the emission and the absorption is of much interest e.g.\\ for the\ndevelopment of efficient interfaces between stationary and flying qubits in\nmodern architectures for quantum computation and quantum communication. We\nconsider the periodic pulse control, where the TLS is subjected to a periodic\nsequence of the near-resonant Rabi driving pulses, each pulse implementing a\n180$^\\circ$ rotation. For small inter-pulse delays, the absorption spectrum\nfeatures a pronounced peak of stimulated emission at the pulse frequency, as\nwell as equidistant satellite peaks with smaller spectral weights. As long as\nthe detuning between the carrier frequency of the driving and the TLS\ntransition frequency remains moderate, this spectral shape shows little change.\nTherefore, the quantum control allows shifting the absorption peak to a desired\nposition, and locks the absorption peak to the carrier frequency of the driving\npulses. Detailed description of the spectrum, and its evolution as a function\ntime, the inter-pulse spacing and the detuning, is presented.\n", "  A real singlet scalar, connected to the Standard Model sector through a\nportal with the Higgs boson, is one of the simplest and most popular models for\ndark matter (DM). However, the experimental advances in direct and indirect DM\nsearches, together with the latest results from the LHC, have ruled out vast\nareas of the parameter space of this scenario, and are expected to probe it\ncompletely within the next years, ruling it out if no signal is found.\nMotivated by the simplicity of this model, in this article we address a\nminimal, renormalizable extension that could evade detection, consisting of the\naddition of an extra real singlet scalar field in the dark sector. We analyze\nthe physical constraints on the model and show that the new annihilation and/or\ncoannihilation channels involving the extra singlet allow to reproduce the\ncorrect DM relic abundance while avoiding the bounds from direct and indirect\nsearches for any DM mass above 50 GeV. We also show that, in some interesting\nregions of the parameter space, the extra particle can be integrated-out,\nleaving a \"clever\" effective theory (just involving the DM particle and the\nHiggs), that essentially reproduces the results.\n", "  We construct a menu of objects that can give rise to bright flares when\ndisrupted by massive black holes (BHs), ranging from planets to evolved stars.\nThrough their tidal disruption, main sequence and evolved stars can effectively\nprobe the existence of otherwise quiescent supermassive BHs and white dwarfs\ncan probe intermediate mass BHs. Many low-mass white dwarfs possess extended\nhydrogen envelopes, which allow for the production of prompt flares in\ndisruptive encounters with moderately massive BHs of $10^5$ to\n$10^7~M_\\odot$--masses that may constitute the majority of massive BHs by\nnumber. These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing\nmoderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the\ndisruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal\ndisruption of a $0.17~M_\\odot$ white dwarf by a $10^5~M_\\odot$ BH reaches a\nmaximum between 0.6 and 11 days, with a peak fallback rate that is usually\nsuper-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical\ntidal disruption event. Encounters stripping only the envelope can provide\nhydrogen-only fallback, while encounters disrupting the core evolve from H- to\nHe-rich fallback. While most tidal disruption candidates observed thus far are\nconsistent with the disruptions of main sequence stars, the rapid timescales of\nnuclear transients such as Dougie and PTF10iya are naturally explained by the\ndisruption of low-mass white dwarfs. As the number of observed flares continues\nto increase, the menu presented here will be essential for characterizing\nnuclear BHs and their environments through tidal disruptions.\n", "  Metasurfaces offer significant potential to control far-field light\npropagation through the engineering of amplitude, polarization, and phase at an\ninterface. We report here phase modulation of an electronically reconfigurable\nmetasurface and demonstrate its utility for mid-infrared beam steering. Using a\ngate-tunable graphene-gold resonator geometry, we demonstrate highly tunable\nreflected phase at multiple wavelengths and show up to 237{\\deg} phase\nmodulation range at an operating wavelength of 8.50 {\\mu}m. We observe a smooth\nmonotonic modulation of phase with applied voltage from 0{\\deg} to 206{\\deg} at\na wavelength of 8.70 {\\mu}m. Based on these experimental data, we demonstrate\nwith antenna array calculations an average beam steering efficiency of 50% for\nreflected light for angles up to 30{\\deg}, relative to an ideal metasurface,\nconfirming the suitability of this geometry for reconfigurable mid-infrared\nbeam steering devices.\n", "  We present a point-by-point determination of the Sivers distributions from\nhadron leptoproduction data. The method, which relies on some simple\nassumptions, is based on the combined analysis of proton and deuteron\nobservables. We make use of the single-spin asymmetries measured by COMPASS in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of 160 GeV muons on transversely\npolarized proton and deuteron targets.\n", "  We have found Dirac nodal lines (DNLs) in the band structures of metallic\nrutile oxides IrO$_2$, OsO$_2$, and RuO$_2$ and revealed a large spin Hall\nconductivity contributed by these nodal lines, which explains a strong spin\nHall effect (SHE) of IrO$_2$ discovered recently. Two types of DNLs exist. The\nfirst type forms DNL networks that extend in the whole Brillouin zone and\nappears only in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which induces surface\nstates on the boundary. Because of SOC-induced band anti-crossing, a large\nintrinsic SHE can be realized in these compounds. The second type appears at\nthe Brillouin zone edges and is stable against SOC because of the protection of\nnonsymmorphic symmetry. Besides reporting new DNL materials, our work reveals\nthe general relationship between DNLs and the SHE, indicating a way to apply\nDirac nodal materials for spintronics.\n", "  We present a fully three-dimensional Bloch mode expansion technique and\nphoton Green function formalism to compute the quality factor, mode volume, and\nPurcell enhancement distributions of a disordered W1 photonic crystal slab\nwaveguide in the slow-light Anderson localization regime. By considering\nfabrication (intrinsic) and intentional (extrinsic) disorder we find that the\nquality factor and Purcell enhancement statistics are well described by\nlog-normal distributions without any fitting parameters. We also compare\ndirectly the effects of hole size fluctuations as well as fluctuations in the\nhole position. The functional dependence of the mean and standard deviation of\nthe quality factor and Purcell enhancement distributions is found to decrease\nexponentially on the square root of the extrinsic disorder parameter. The\nstrong coupling probability between a single quantum dot and an\nAnderson-localized mode is numerically computed and found to exponential\ndecrease with the squared extrinsic disorder parameter, where low disordered\nsystems give rise to larger probabilities when state-of-art quantum dots are\nconsidered. The optimal regions to position quantum dots in the W1 waveguide\nare also discussed. These theoretical results are fundamental interesting and\nconnect to recent experimental works on photonic crystal slab waveguides in the\nslow-light regime.\n", "  We present the first lattice-QCD calculation of the pion distribution\namplitude using the large- momentum effective field theory (LaMET) approach,\nwhich allows us to extract lightcone parton observables from a Euclidean\nlattice. The mass corrections needed to extract the pion distribution amplitude\nfrom this approach are calculated to all orders in $m^2_{\\pi} /P_z^2$. We also\nimplement the Wilson- line renormalization which is crucial to remove the power\ndivergences in this approach, and find that it reduces the oscillation at the\nend points of the distribution amplitude. Our exploratory result at 310-MeV\npion mass favors a single-hump form broader than the asymptotic form of the\npion distribution amplitude.\n", "  Particle transport in random media obeying a given mixing statistics is key\nin several applications in nuclear reactor physics and more generally in\ndiffusion phenomena emerging in optics and life sciences. Exact solutions for\nthe ensemble-averaged physical observables are hardly available, and several\napproximate models have been thus developed, providing a compromise between the\naccurate treatment of the disorder-induced spatial correlations and the\ncomputational time. In order to validate these models, it is mandatory to\nresort to reference solutions in benchmark configurations, typically obtained\nby explicitly generating by Monte Carlo methods several realizations of random\nmedia, simulating particle transport in each realization, and finally taking\nthe ensemble averages for the quantities of interest. In this context, intense\nresearch efforts have been devoted to Poisson (Markov) mixing statistics, where\nbenchmark solutions have been derived for transport in one-dimensional\ngeometries. In a recent work, we have generalized these solutions to two and\nthree-dimensional configurations, and shown how dimension affects the\nsimulation results. In this paper we will examine the impact of mixing\nstatistics: to this aim, we will compare the reflection and transmission\nprobabilities, as well as the particle flux, for three-dimensional random media\nobtained by resorting to Poisson, Voronoi and Box stochastic tessellations. For\neach tessellation, we will furthermore discuss the effects of varying the\nfragmentation of the stochastic geometry, the material compositions, and the\ncross sections of the transported particles.\n", "  In this paper, the effect of transmitter beam size on the performance of free\nspace optical (FSO) communication has been determined experimentally.\nIrradiance profile for varying turbulence strength is obtained using optical\nturbulence generating (OTG) chamber inside laboratory environment. Based on the\nresults, an optimum beam size is investigated using the semi-analytical method.\nMoreover, the combined effects of atmospheric scintillation and beam wander\ninduced pointing errors are considered in order to determine the optimum beam\nsize that minimizes the bit error rate (BER) of the system for a fixed\ntransmitter power and link length. The results show that the optimum beam size\nincreases with the increase in zenith angle but has negligible effect with the\nincrease in fade threshold level at low turbulence levels and has a marginal\neffect at high turbulence levels. Finally, the obtained outcome is useful for\nFSO system design and BER performance analysis.\n", "  A bipartite subspace $S$ is called strongly\npositive-partial-transpose-unextendible (PPT-unextendible) if for every\npositive integer $k$, there is no PPT operator supporting on the orthogonal\ncomplement of $S^{\\otimes k}$. We show that a subspace is strongly\nPPT-unextendible if it contains a PPT-definite operator (a positive\nsemidefinite operator whose partial transpose is positive definite). Based on\nthese, we are able to propose a simple criterion for verifying whether a set of\nbipartite orthogonal quantum states is indistinguishable by PPT operations in\nthe many copy scenario. Utilizing this criterion, we further point out that any\nentangled pure state and its orthogonal complement cannot be distinguished by\nPPT operations in the many copy scenario. On the other hand, we investigate\nthat the minimum dimension of strongly PPT-unextendible subspaces in an\n$m\\otimes n$ system is $m+n-1$, which involves a generalization of the result\nthat non-positive-partial-transpose (NPT) subspaces can be as large as any\nentangled subspace [N. Johnston, Phys. Rev. A 87: 064302 (2013)].\n", "  We analyze general zero mode properties of the parent Hamiltonian of the\nunprojected Jain-2/5 state. We characterize the zero mode condition associated\nto this Hamiltonian via projection onto a four-dimensional two-particle\nsubspace for given pair angular momentum, for the disk and similarly for the\nspherical geometry. Earlier numerical claims in the literature about ground\nstate uniqueness on the sphere are substantiated on analytic grounds, and\nrelated results are derived. Preference is given to second quantized methods,\nwhere zero mode properties are derived not from given analytic wave functions,\nbut from a \"lattice\" Hamiltonian and associated zero mode conditions. This\nmethod reveals new insights into the guiding-center structure of the\nunprojected Jain-2/5 state, in particular a system of dominance patterns\nfollowing a \"generalized Pauli principle\", which establishes a complete\none-to-one correspondence with the edge mode counting. We also identify\none-body operators that function as generators of zero modes.\n", "  We report the first longitudinal/transverse separation of the deeply virtual\nexclusive $\\pi^0$ electroproduction cross section off the neutron and coherent\ndeuteron. The corresponding four structure functions $d\\sigma_L/dt$,\n$d\\sigma_T/dt$, $d\\sigma_{LT}/dt$ and $d\\sigma_{TT}/dt$ are extracted as a\nfunction of the momentum transfer to the recoil system at $Q^2$=1.75 GeV$^2$\nand $x_B$=0.36. The $ed \\to ed\\pi^0$ cross sections are found compatible with\nthe small values expected from theoretical models. The $en \\to en\\pi^0$ cross\nsections show a dominance from the response to transversely polarized photons,\nand are in good agreement with calculations based on the transversity GPDs of\nthe nucleon. By combining these results with previous measurements of $\\pi^0$\nelectroproduction off the proton, we present a flavor decomposition of the $u$\nand $d$ quark contributions to the cross section.\n", "  We consider an SU(2)-lattice gauge model in the tree gauge. Classically, this\nis a system with symmetries whose configuration space is a direct product of\ncopies of SU(2), acted upon by diagonal inner automorphisms. We derive defining\nrelations for the orbit type strata in the reduced classical phase space. The\nlatter is realized as a certain quotient of a direct product of copies of the\ncomplexified group SL(2,\\CC) (sometimes named the GIT-quotient because it\nprovides a categorical quotient in the sense of geometric invariant theory).\nThe relations derived can be used for the construction of the orbit type\ncostratification of the Hilbert space of the quantum system in the sense of\nHuebschmann.\n", "  The numerical value of the fine-structure constant generally leads to small\nisospin-breaking effects due to electromagnetism in QCD. This smallness\ncomplicates determining isospin breaking from lattice QCD computations that\ninclude electromagnetism. One solution to this problem consists of performing\ncomputations using larger-than-physical values of the electric charge, and\nsubsequently extrapolating (or interpolating) to the physical value of the\nfine-structure constant. Motivated by recent lattice QCD + QED computations of\nelectromagnetic masses employing this setup, we consider finite-volume effects\narising from the use of larger-than-physical electric charges. A modified\npower-counting scheme, which is based on treating the fine-structure constant\nas larger than its physical value, is explored. Results for perturbative QED\ncorrections, however, are surprising. Within the framework of non-relativistic\nQED, multi-loop diagrams exhibit a momentum factorization property that\nproduces exact cancellations. We determine that power-law finite-volume effects\nvanish at the leading two- and three-loop order, as well as the next-to-leading\ntwo-loop order. For larger-than-physical charges, we consequently expect no\nappreciable volume corrections beyond leading-order QED.\n", "  The measurement of Single Transverse-Spin Asymmetries, $A_N$, for various\nquarkonium states and Drell-Yan lepton pairs can shed light on the orbital\nangular momentum of quarks and gluons, a fundamental ingredient of the\nproton-spin puzzle. The AFTER@LHC proposal combines a unique kinematic coverage\nand large luminosities thanks to the Large Hadron Collider beams to deliver\nprecise measurements, complementary to the knowledge provided by collider\nexperiments such as at RHIC. In this paper, we report on sensitivity studies\nfor $J/\\psi$, $\\Upsilon$ and Drell-Yan $A_N$ done using the performance of\nLHCb-like or ALICE-like detectors, combined with polarised gaseous hydrogen and\nhelium-3 targets. In particular, such analyses will provide us with new\ninsights and knowledge about transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution\nfunctions for quarks and gluons and on twist-3 collinear matrix elements in the\nproton and the neutron.\n", "  Thermodynamics of the near extremal black p-branes can be described by\ncollective motions of gravitationally interacting branes. This proposal is\ncalled the p-soup model. In this paper, we check this proposal in the case of\nblack brane system which is asymptotically Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse in an infinite distance. As a result, we can show that the\ngravitationally interacting branes explain free energy, entropy, temperature\nand other physical quantities in these systems. This implies that the\nmicrostates of this kind of brane system can be also understood in the p-soup\nmodel.\n", "  We combine few- and many-body degrees of freedom in a model applicable to\nboth bound and continuum states and adaptable to different subfields of\nphysics. We formulate a self-consistent three-body model for a core-nucleus\nsurrounded by two valence nucleons. We treat the core in the mean-field\napproximation and use the same effective Skyrme interaction between both core\nand valence nucleons. We apply the model to $^{26}$O where we reproduce the\nknown experimental data as well as phenomenological models with more\nparameters. The decay of the ground state is found to proceed directly into the\ncontinuum without effect of the virtual sequential decay through the well\nreproduced $d_{3/2}$-resonance of $^{25}$O.\n", "  We have performed Joule power loss calculations for a flat dechirper. We have\nconsidered the configurations of the beam on-axis between the two plates---for\nchirp control---and for the beam especially close to one plate---for use as a\nfast kicker. Our calculations use a surface impedance approach, one that is\nvalid when corrugation parameters are small compared to aperture (the\nperturbative parameter regime). In our model we ignore effects of field\nreflections at the sides of the dechirper plates, and thus expect the results\nto underestimate the Joule losses. The analytical results were also tested by\nnumerical, time-domain simulations. We find that most of the wake power lost by\nthe beam is radiated out to the sides of the plates. For the case of the beam\npassing by a single plate, we derive an analytical expression for the\nbroad-band impedance, and---in Appendix B---numerically confirm recently\ndeveloped, analytical formulas for the short-range wakes. While our theory can\nbe applied to the LCLS-II dechirper with large gaps, for the nominal apertures\nwe are not in the perturbative regime and the reflection contribution to Joule\nlosses is not negligible. With input from computer simulations, we estimate the\nJoule power loss (assuming bunch charge of 300 pC, repetition rate of 100 kHz)\nis 21~W/m for the case of two plates, and 24 W/m for the case of a single\nplate.\n", "  Observations of millimeter wavelength radio recombination lines (mm-RRLs) are\nused to search for HII regions in an unbiased way that is complementary to many\nof the more traditional methods previously used. We carried out targeted mm-RRL\nobservations (39$\\leq$ principal quantum number ($n$) $\\leq$65 and $\\Delta n$ =\n1, 2, 3 and 4, i.e. H$n\\alpha$, H$n\\beta$, H$n\\gamma$ and H$n\\delta$) using the\nIRAM 30m and Mopra 22m telescopes. We observed 976 compact dust clumps selected\nfrom a catalog of $\\sim$10,000 ATLASGAL sources. We detected H$n\\alpha$ mm-RRL\nemission toward 178 clumps; H$n\\beta$, H$n\\gamma$ and H$n\\delta$ were also\ndetected toward 65, 23, and 22 clumps, respectively. This is the largest sample\nof mm-RRLs detections published to date. Comparing the positions of these\nclumps with radio continuum surveys we identified compact radio counterparts\nfor 134 clumps. The nature of the other 44 detections is unclear, but 8\ndetections are thought to be potentially new HII regions. Broad linewidths are\nseen toward nine clumps (linewidth > 40 km s$^{-1}$) revealing significant\nturbulent motions within the ionized gas. We find that the linewidth of the\nH$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1$-$0) emission is significantly wider than those without\nmm-RRL detection. We also find a correlation between the integrated fluxes of\nthe mm-RRLs and the 6 cm continuum flux densities of their radio counterparts.\nWe find that the mm-RRL emission is associated with HII regions with\n$n_{e}<10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and HII region diameter >0.03 pc. We detected mm-RRLs\ntoward 178 clumps and identified eight new HII region candidates. The broad\nmm-RRL from nine clumps may indicate that they arise in very young\nhyper-compact HII regions. The mm-RRLs trace the radio continuum sources\ndetected by high-resolution observations and their line parameters show\nassociations with the embedded radio sources and their parental molecular\nclumps.\n", "  Accessing intrinsic properties of a graphene device can be hindered by the\ninfluence of contact electrodes. Here, we capacitively couple graphene devices\nto superconducting resonant circuits and observe clear changes in the\nresonance- frequency and -widths originating from the internal charge dynamics\nof graphene. This allows us to extract the density of states and charge\nrelaxation resistance in graphene p-n junctions without the need of electrical\ncontacts. The presented characterizations pave a fast, sensitive and\nnon-invasive measurement of graphene nanocircuits.\n", "  We discuss the permutation group G of massive vacua of four-dimensional gauge\ntheories with N=1 supersymmetry that arises upon tracing loops in the space of\ncouplings. We concentrate on superconformal N=4 and N=2 theories with N=1\nsupersymmetry preserving mass deformations. The permutation group G of massive\nvacua is the Galois group of characteristic polynomials for the vacuum\nexpectation values of chiral observables. We provide various techniques to\neffectively compute characteristic polynomials in given theories, and we deduce\nthe existence of varying symmetry breaking patterns of the duality group\ndepending on the gauge algebra and matter content of the theory. Our examples\ngive rise to interesting field extensions of spaces of modular forms.\n", "  To insight the relationships between the self-organizing structures of cells,\nsuch as the cell clusters, and the properties of biotissues is helpful in\nrevealing the function and designing biomaterial. Traditional random foam model\nneglects several important details of the frameworks of cell clusters, in this\nstudy we use a more complete model, cell adhesion model, to investigate the\nmechanical and morphological properties of the two-dimensional (2D) dry foams\ncomposed by cells. Supposing these structures are formed due to adhesion\nbetween cells, the equilibrium formations result from the minimum of the free\nenergy. The equilibrium shape equations for high symmetrical structures without\nthe volume constraint are derived, and the analytical results of the\ncorresponding mechanical parameters, such as the Young's modulus, bulk modulus\nand failure strength, are obtained. Numerical simulation method is applied to\nstudy the complex shapes with the volume constraint and several stable\nmulticellular structures are obtained. Symmetry-breaking due to the volume\nchange is founded and typical periodic shapes and the corresponding phase\ntransformations are explored. Our study provides a potential method to connect\nthe microstructure with the macro-mechanical parameters of biotissues. The\nresults also are helpful to understand the physical mechanism of how the\nstructures of biotissues are formed.\n", "  We study the annihilation of topological solitons in the simplest setting: a\none-dimensional ferromagnet with an easy axis. We develop an effective theory\nof the annihilation process in terms of four collective coordinates: two zero\nmodes of the translational and rotational symmetries $Z$ and $\\Phi$,\nrepresenting the average position and azimuthal angle of the two solitons, and\ntwo conserved momenta $\\zeta$ and $\\varphi$, representing the relative distance\nand twist. Comparison with micromagnetic simulations shows that our approach\ncaptures well the essential physics of the process.\n", "  The viscosity of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is usually described\nholographically by the entropy-normalized dynamic viscosity $\\eta/s$. However,\nother measures of viscosity, such as the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ and the\nReynolds number $Re$, are often useful, and they too should be investigated\nfrom a holographic point of view. We show that a simple model of this kind puts\nan upper bound on $Re$ for nearly central collisions at a given temperature;\nthis upper bound is in very good agreement with the observational lower bound\n(from the RHIC facility). Furthermore, in a holographic approach using only\nEinstein gravity, $\\eta/s$ does not respond to variations of other physical\nparameters, while $\\nu$ and $Re$ can do so. In particular, it is known that the\nmagnetic fields arising in peripheral heavy-ion collisions vary strongly with\nthe impact parameter $b$, and we find that the holographic model predicts that\n$\\nu$ and $Re$ can also be expected to vary substantially with the magnetic\nfield and therefore with $b$.\n", "  We present off-shell N=2 supergravity actions, which exhibit spontaneously\nbroken local supersymmetry and allow for de Sitter vacua for certain values of\nthe parameters. They are obtained by coupling the standard N=2\nsupergravity-matter systems to the Goldstino superfields introduced in\narXiv:1105.3001 and arXiv:1607.01277 in the rigid supersymmetric case. These\nN=2 Goldstino superfields include nilpotent chiral and linear supermultiplets.\nWe also describe a new reducible N=1 Goldstino supermultiplet.\n", "  Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism, we investigate the spatial\nrelation between the electro-chemical potential measured in scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, and local current patterns over the entire range from the quantum\nto the classical transport regime. These quantities show similar spatial\npatterns near the quantum limit, but are related by Ohm's law only in the\nclassical regime. We demonstrate that defects induce a Landauer residual\nresistivity dipole in the electro-chemical potential with the concomitant\nspatial current pattern representing the field lines of the dipole.\n", "  Nonlinear edge localized modes in a tokamak are examined using global\nthree-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Coherent\ncurrent-carrying filament (ribbon-like) structures wrapped around the torus are\nnonlinearly formed due to nonaxisymmetric reconnecting current sheet\ninstabilities, the so called peeling-like edge localized modes. These fast\ngrowing modes saturate by breaking axisymmetric current layers isolated near\nthe plasma edge and go through repetitive relaxation cycles by expelling\ncurrent radially outward and relaxing it back. The local bi-directional\nfluctuation-induced electromotive force (emf) from the edge localized modes,\nthe dynamo action, relaxes the axisymmetric current density and forms current\nholes near the edge.\n", "  In semi-leptonic $B$ decays with a tau lepton, features of the production\nprocess are imprinted on the tau helicity states. Since the tau momentum cannot\nbe fully reconstructed experimentally, the available information on the tau\nproperties is encoded in its visible decay products. Focusing on the process\n$B\\to D\\tau\\nu$, we find explicit relations between the tau properties and the\nkinematics of the charged particles in the decays $\\tau\\to\\pi\\nu$,\n$\\tau\\to\\rho\\nu$, and $\\tau\\to\\ell\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$. In particular, we show that\nthe perpendicular polarization, $P_\\perp$, and the forward-backward asymmetry,\n$A_\\tau$, of the tau lepton can simultaneously be extracted from an angular\nasymmetry of the charged particle against the $D$ meson. For the most sensitive\ndecay channel, $\\tau\\to\\pi\\nu$, we expect a relative statistical precision of\nabout $10\\%$ for $P_\\perp$ and $A_\\tau$ in a measurement based on\n$50\\,$ab$^{-1}$ of data at BELLE II.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that close-in brown dwarfs in the mass range 35-55\nM$_{\\rm Jup}$ are almost depleted as companions to stars, suggesting that\nobjects with masses above and below this gap might have different formation\nmechanisms. We determine the fundamental stellar parameters, as well as\nindividual abundances for a large sample of stars known to have a substellar\ncompanion in the brown dwarf regime. The sample is divided into stars hosting\n\"massive\" and \"low-mass\" brown dwarfs. Following previous works a threshold of\n42.5 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ was considered. Our results confirm that stars with brown\ndwarf companions do not follow the well-established gas-giant planet\nmetallicity correlation seen in main-sequence planet hosts. Stars harbouring\n\"massive\" brown dwarfs show similar metallicity and abundance distribution as\nstars without known planets or with low-mass planets. We find a tendency of\nstars harbouring \"less-massive\" brown dwarfs of having slightly larger\nmetallicity, [X$_{\\rm Fe}$/Fe] values, and abundances of Sc II, Mn I, and Ni I\nin comparison with the stars having the massive brown dwarfs. The data suggest,\nas previously reported, that massive and low-mass brown dwarfs might present\ndifferences in period and eccentricity. We find evidence of a non-metallicity\ndependent mechanism for the formation of massive brown dwarfs. Our results\nagree with a scenario in which massive brown dwarfs are formed as stars. At\nhigh-metallicities, the core-accretion mechanism might become efficient in the\nformation of low-mass brown dwarfs while at lower metallicities low-mass brown\ndwarfs could form by gravitational instability in turbulent protostellar discs.\n", "  The role of energy exchange between a quantum system and its environment is\ninvestigated from the perspective of the Onsager conductance matrix. We\nconsider the thermoelectric linear transport of an interacting quantum dot\ncoupled to two terminals under the influence of an electrical potential and a\nthermal bias. We implement in our model the effect of coupling to\nelectromagnetic environmental modes created by nearby electrons within the\nP(E)-theory of dynamical Coulomb blockade. Our findings relate the lack of some\nsymmetries among the Onsager matrix coefficients with an enhancement of the\nefficiency at maximum power and the occurrence of the heat rectification\nphenomenon.\n", "  It is known in vacuum that the three-flavor neutrino survival probability can\nbe approximated by the effective two-flavor form to first orders in $\\epsilon\n\\equiv \\Delta m^2_{21} / \\Delta m^2_{31}$, with introduction of the effective\n$\\Delta m^2_{\\alpha \\alpha}$ ($\\alpha = e, \\mu, \\tau$), in regions of neutrino\nenergy $E$ and baseline $L$ such that $\\Delta m^2_{31} L / 2E \\sim \\pi$. Here,\nwe investigate the question of whether the similar effective two-flavor\napproximation can be formulated for the survival probability in matter. Using a\nperturbative framework with the expansion parameters $\\epsilon$ and $s_{13}\n\\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, we give an affirmative answer to this question and\nthe resultant two-flavor form of the probability is valid to order $\\epsilon$.\nHowever, we observe a contrived feature of the effective $\\Delta m^2_{\\alpha\n\\alpha} (a)$ in matter. It ceases to be a combination of the fundamental\nparameters and has energy dependence, which may be legitimate because it comes\nfrom the matter potential. But, it turned out that $\\Delta m^2_{\\mu \\mu} (a)$\nbecomes $L$-dependent, though $\\Delta m^2_{ee} (a)$ is not, which casts doubt\non adequacy of the concept of effective $\\Delta m^2$ in matter. We also find\nthat the appearance probability in vacuum admits, to order $\\epsilon$, the\nsimilar effective two-flavor form with a slightly different effective $\\Delta\nm^2_{\\beta \\alpha}$ from the disappearance channel. A general result is derived\nto describe suppression of the matter effect in the oscillation probability.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the notion of an omni $n$-Lie algebra and show\nthat they are linearization of higher analogues of standard Courant algebroids.\nWe also introduce the notion of a nonabelian omni $n$-Lie algebra and show that\nthey are linearization of higher analogues of Courant algebroids associated to\nNambu-Poisson manifolds.\n", "  A new concept of permanent magnet systems for guiding superparamagnetic\nparticles on arbitrary trajectories is proposed. The basic concept is to use\none magnet system with a strong and homogeneous (dipolar) magnetic field to\nmagnetize and orient the particles. A second constantly graded field\n(quadrupolar) is superimposed to the first to generate a force. In this\nconfiguration the motion of the particles is driven solely by the component of\nthe gradient field which is parallel to the direction of the homogeneous field.\nThen the particles are guided with constant force in a single direction over\nthe entire volume. The direction can be adjusted by varying the angle between\nquadrupole and dipole. Since a single gradient is impossible, the other\ngradient component determines the angular deviation of the force. The latter\ncan be neglected if the homogeneous field is stronger than the local\ncontribution of the gradient field. A possible realization is a coaxial\narrangement of two Halbach cylinders. A dipole produces a strong and\nhomogeneous field to evenly magnetize the particles, while the second cylinder\nis a quadrupole to generate the force. A simple prototype was constructed to\ndemonstrate the principle on several nano-particles, which were moved along a\nrough square by manually changing the force angle. The observed velocities of\nparticles were always several orders of magnitude higher than the theoretical\nvalue. This discrepancy is attributed to the observed formation of long\nparticle chains as a result of their polarization by the homogeneous field. The\nmagnetic moment of such a chain is then the combination of that of its\nconstituents. A complete system will consist of another quadrupole (third\ncylinder) to additionally scale the strength of the force by another rotation.\nIn this configuration the device could then also be used as a simple MRI\nmachine to image the particles.\n", "  The manuscript describes several monochromatization schemes starting from\nA.~Renieri \\cite{ref:Renieri} proposal for head-on collisions based on\ncorrelation between particles transverse position and energy deviation. We\nbriefly explain initial proposal and expand it for crossing angle collisions.\nThen we discuss new monochromatization scheme for crossing angle collisions\nbased on correlation between particles longitudinal position and energy\ndeviation.\n", "  There is numerical evidence that the world sheet action of the confining flux\ntube in D=3+1 SU(N) gauge theories contains a massive excitation with 0-\nquantum numbers whose mass shows some decrease as one goes from SU(3) to SU(5).\nIt has furthermore been shown that this particle is naturally described as\narising from a topological interaction term in the world-sheet action, so that\none can describe it as being `axion'-like. Recently it has been pointed out\nthat if the mass of this `axion' vanishes as N -> oo then it becomes possible\nfor the world sheet theory to be integrable in the planar limit. In this paper\nwe perform lattice calculations of this `axion' mass from SU(2) to SU(12),\nwhich allows us to make a controlled extrapolation to N=oo and so test this\ninteresting possibility. We find that the `axion' does not in fact become\nmassless as N -> oo. So if the theory is to possess planar integrability then\nit must be some other world sheet excitation that becomes massless in the\nplanar limit.\n", "  Models with non-minimal Higgs sectors represent a mainstream direction in\ntheoretical exploration of physics opportunities beyond the Standard Model.\nExtended scalar sectors help alleviate difficulties of the Standard Model and\nlead to a rich spectrum of characteristic collider signatures and astroparticle\nconsequences. In this review, we introduce the reader to the world of extended\nHiggs sectors. Not pretending to exhaustively cover the entire body of\nliterature, we walk through a selection of the most popular examples: the two-\nand multi-Higgs-doublet models, as well as singlet and triplet extensions. We\nwill show how one typically builds models with extended Higgs sectors, describe\nthe main goals and the challenges which arise on the way, and mention some\nmethods to overcome them. We will also describe how such models can be tested,\nwhat are the key observables one focuses on, and illustrate the general\nstrategy with a subjective selection of results.\n", "  We use stochastic rotation dynamics to examine the dynamics of the ejection\nof an initially strongly confined flexible polymer from a spherical capsid with\nand without hydrodynamics. The results obtained using SRD are compared to\nsimilar Langevin simulations. Inclusion of hydrodynamic modes speeds up the\nejection but also allows the part of the polymer outside the capsid to expand\ncloser to equilibrium. This shows as higher values of radius of gyration when\nhydrodynamics are enabled. By examining the waiting times of individual polymer\nbeads we find that the waiting time $t_w$ grows with the number of ejected\nmonomers $s$ as a sum of two exponents. When $\\approx 63 \\%$ of the polymer has\nejected the ejection enters the regime of slower dynamics. The functional form\nof $t_w$ vs $s$ is universal for all ejection processes starting from the same\ninitial monomer densities. Inclusion of hydrodynamics only reduces its\nmagnitude. Consequently, we define a universal scaling function $h$ such that\nthe cumulative waiting time $t = N_0 h(s/N_0)$ for large $N_0$. Our\nunprecedently precise measurements of force indicate that this form for\n$t_w(s)$ originates from the corresponding force towards the pore decreasing\nsuper exponentially at the end of the ejection. Our measured $t_w(s)$ explains\nthe apparent superlinear scaling of the ejection time with the polymer length\nfor short polymers. However, for asymptotically long polymers $t_w(s)$ predicts\nlinear scaling.\n", "  We succeed to find compact analytical expressions which allow to easily\nextract the black hole spin from observations of its shadow, without need to\nconstruct or model the entire curve of the shadow. The deformation of Kerr\nblack hole shadow can be characterised in a simple way by oblateness (the ratio\nof the horizontal and vertical angular diameters which are supposed to be\nmeasured by an observer). The deformation is significant in case the black hole\nis nearly extreme and observer is not so far from the equatorial plane. In this\napproximation, we present: (i) the spin lower limit via oblateness, (ii) the\nspin via oblateness and viewing angle, in case the latter is known from other\nobservations.\n", "  We report evidence for a reentrant spin glass phase in electron-doped\n$\\text{EuFe}_2\\text{As}_2$ single crystals and first traces of the\nsuperconductivity re-entrance in optics. In the close-to-optimal doped\n$\\text{Eu}(\\text{Fe}_{0.91}\\text{Ir}_{0.09})_2\\text{As}_2$ and\n$\\text{Eu}(\\text{Fe}_{0.93}\\text{Rh}_{0.07})_2\\text{As}_2$ samples two magnetic\ntransitions are observed below the superconducting critical temperature $T_c\n\\approx 21$~K: the canted $A$-type antiferromagnetic order of the\n$\\text{Eu}^{2+}$ ions sets in around $17\\,\\text{K}$; the spin glass behavior\noccurs another $2\\,\\text{K}$ lower in temperature. In addition, strong evidence\nfor an additional transition is found far below the spin glass temperature. Our\nextensive optical and magnetic investigations provide new insight into the\ninterplay of local magnetism and superconductivity in these systems and\nelucidate the effect of the spin-glass phase on the reentrant superconducting\nstate.\n", "  Generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) are\nthe most general parton correlation functions of hadrons. By considering the\nexclusive double Drell-Yan process it is shown for the first time how quark\nGTMDs can be measured. Specific GTMDs can be addressed by means of polarization\nobservables.\n", "  We examine lepton flavor violating (LFV) interactions for heavy right-handed\nneutrinos that exist in most of the standard model extensions that address dark\nmatter (DM) and neutrino mass at the loop level. In order to probe the collider\neffect of these LFV interactions, we impose the assumption that the model\nparameters give the right values of the DM relic density and fulfill the\nconstraints from the LFV processes $\\ell_{\\alpha}\\rightarrow\\ell_{\\beta}\\gamma$\nand $\\ell_{\\alpha}\\rightarrow3\\ell_{\\beta}$. We also investigate the\npossibility of probing these interactions, and hence the right-handed neutrino,\nat leptonic colliders through different final state signatures.\n", "  In study of muon neutrino disappearance at 810 km, the NOvA experiment finds\nflavor mixing of the atmospheric sector to deviate from maximal\n($\\sin^2\\theta_{23} = 0.5$) by 2.6 $\\sigma$. The result is in tension with the\n295-km baseline measurements of T2K which are consistent with maximal mixing.\nWe propose that $\\theta_{23}$ is in fact maximal, and that the disagreement is\nharbinger of environmentally-induced decoherence. The departure from maximal\nmixing can be accounted for by an energy-independent decoherence of strength\n$\\Gamma = (2.3 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{-23}$ GeV.\n", "  An extended atomistic spin model allowing for studies of the finite\ntemperature magnetic properties of alloys is proposed. The model is obtained by\nextending the Heisenberg Hamiltonian via a parameterization from a first\nprinciples basis, interpolating from both the low temperature ferromagnetic and\nthe high temperature paramagnetic reference states. This allows us to treat\nmagnetic systems with varying degree of itinerant character within the model.\nSatisfactory agreement with both previous theoretical studies and experiments\nare obtained in terms of Curie temperatures and paramagnetic properties. The\nproposed model is not restricted to elements but is also applied to binary\nalloys, such as the technologically important material Permalloy, where\nsignificant differences in the finite magnetic properties of Fe and Ni magnetic\nmoments are found. The proposed model strives to find the right compromise\nbetween accuracy and computational feasibility for accurate modeling, even for\ncomplex magnetic alloys and compounds.\n", "  BaMn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator where a metal-insulator\ntransition occurs with hole doping via the substitution of Ba with K. The\nmetal-insulator transition causes only a small suppression of the N\\'eel\ntemperature ($T_\\mathrm{N}$) and the ordered moment, suggesting that doped\nholes interact weakly with the Mn spin system. Powder inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements were performed on three different powder samples of\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Mn$_{2}$As$_{2}$ with $x=$0, 0.125 and 0.25 to study the\neffect of hole doping and metallization on the spin dynamics of these\ncompounds. We compare the neutron intensities to a linear spin wave theory\napproximation to the $J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{c}$ Heisenberg model. Hole doping is found\nto introduce only minor modifications to the exchange energies and spin gap.\nThe changes observed in the exchange constants are consistent with the small\ndrop of $T_\\mathrm{N}$ with doping.\n", "  We determine the generating functions of 1/4 BPS dyons in a class of 4d\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ string vacua arising as CHL orbifolds of $K3 \\times T^2$, a\nclassification of which has been recently completed. We show that all such\ngenerating functions obey some simple physical consistency conditions that are\nvery often sufficient to fix them uniquely. The main constraint we impose is\nthe absence of unphysical walls of marginal stability: discontinuities of 1/4\nBPS degeneracies can only occur when 1/4 BPS dyons decay into pairs of 1/2 BPS\nstates. Formally, these generating functions in spacetime can be described as\nmultiplicative lifts of certain supersymmetric indices (twining genera) on the\nworldsheet of the corresponding nonlinear sigma model on K3. As a consequence,\nour procedure also leads to an explicit derivation of almost all of these\ntwining genera. The worldsheet indices singled out in this way match precisely\na set of functions of interest in moonshine, as predicted by a recent\nconjecture.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate the necessity of including the generally omitted\ncollective mode contributions in calculations of the Meissner effect for\nnon-uniform superconductors. We consider superconducting pairing with non-zero\ncenter of mass momentum, as is relevant to high transition temperature\ncuprates, cold atoms, and quantum chromodynamic superconductors. For the\nconcrete example of the Fulde-Ferrell phase we present a quantitative\ncalculation of the superfluid density, showing the collective mode\ncontributions are not only appreciable but that they derive from the amplitude\nmode of the order parameter. This latter mode (related to the Higgs mode in a\ncharged system) is generally viewed as being invisible in conventional\nsuperconductors. However, our analysis shows that it is extremely important in\npair-density wave type superconductors, where it destroys superfluidity well\nbefore the mean-field order parameter vanishes.\n", "  As an alternative option to kinetic electrons, the gyrokinetic total-f\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) code XGC1 has been extended to the MHD/fluid type\nelectromagnetic regime by combining gyrokinetic PIC ions with massless\ndrift-fluid electrons analogous to Chen and Parker, Physics of Plasmas 8, 441\n(2001). Two representative long wavelength modes, shear Alfv\\'en waves and\nresistive tearing modes, are verified in cylindrical and toroidal magnetic\nfield geometries.\n", "  The rare flavour-changing neutral current decay $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is among\nthe most important indirect probes of new physics at the LHC, as it is strongly\nsuppressed in the Standard Model, very sensitive to new physics effects, and\ntheoretically exceptionally clean. We present a thorough state-of-the-art\nanalysis of the constraints on new physics from present and future measurements\nof this decay, focusing on scalar operators. We show model-independently and in\nconcrete new physics models, namely the MSSM and two leptoquark scenarios, that\na future precise measurement of the mass-eigenstate rate asymmetry in\n$B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ would allow to disentangle new physics scenarios that would\nbe indistinguishable based on measurements of the branching ratio alone. We\nalso highlight the complementarity between $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and direct\nsearches in both model classes. Our numerics is based on the open source code\nflavio and is made publicly available.\n", "  We use a combination of neutron and X-ray total scattering measurements\ntogether with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis to characterise the\nvariation in local structure across the orbital order--disorder transition in\nLaMnO$_3$. Our experimental data are inconsistent with a conventional\norder--disorder description of the transition, and reflect instead the\nexistence of a discontinuous change in local structure between ordered and\ndisordered states. Within the orbital-ordered regime, the neutron and X-ray\nPDFs are best described by a local structure model with the same local orbital\narrangements as those observed in the average (long-range) crystal structure.\nWe show that a variety of meaningfully-different local orbital arrangement\nmodels can give fits of comparable quality to the experimental PDFs collected\nwithin the disordered regime; nevertheless, our data show a subtle but\nconsistent preference for the anisotropic Potts model proposed in \\emph{Phys\nRev.\\ B} {\\bf 79}, 174106 (2009). The key implications of this model are\nelectronic and magnetic isotropy together with the loss of local inversion\nsymmetry at the Mn site. We conclude with a critical assessment of the\ninterpretation of PDF measurements when characterising local symmetry breaking\nin functional materials.\n", "  We present a comprehensive benchmark study of the adsorption energy of a\nsingle water molecule on the (001) LiH surface using periodic coupled cluster\nand quantum Monte Carlo theories. We benchmark and compare different\nimplementations of quantum chemical wave function based theories in order to\nverify the reliability of the predicted adsorption energies and the employed\napproximations. Furthermore we compare the predicted adsorption energies to\nthose obtained employing widely-used van der Waals density-functionals. Our\nfindings show that quantum chemical approaches are becoming a robust and\nreliable tool for condensed phase electronic structure calculations, providing\nan additional tool that can also help in potentially improving currently\navailable van der Waals density-functionals.\n", "  [Background] The neutrino-nucleus ($\\nu A$) cross section is a major source\nof systematic uncertainty in neutrino-oscillation studies. A precise $\\nu A$\nscattering model, in which multinucleon effects are incorporated, is pivotal\nfor an accurate interpretation of the data. [Purpose] In $\\nu A$ interactions,\nmeson-exchange currents (MECs) can induce two-nucleon ($2N$) knockout from the\ntarget nucleus, resulting in a two-particle two-hole (2p2h) final state. They\nalso affect single nucleon ($1N$) knockout reactions, yielding a one-particle\none-hole (1p1h) final state. Both channels affect the inclusive strength. We\npresent a study of axial and vector, seagull and pion-in-flight currents in\nmuon-neutrino induced $1N$ and $2N$ knockout reactions on $^{12}$C. [Method]\nBound and emitted nucleons are described as Hartree-Fock wave functions. For\nthe vector MECs, the standard expressions are used. For the axial current,\nthree parameterizations are considered. The framework developed here allows for\na treatment of MECs and short-range correlations (SRCs). [Results] Results are\ncompared with electron-scattering data and with literature. The strengths of\nthe seagull, pion-in-flight and axial currents are studied separately and\ndouble differential cross sections including MECs are compared with results\nincluding SRCs. A comparison with MiniBooNE and T2K data is presented.\n[Conclusions] In the 1p1h channel, the effects of the MECs tend to cancel each\nother, resulting in a small effect on the double differential cross section.\n$2N$ knockout processes provide a small contribution to the inclusive double\ndifferential cross section, ranging from the $2N$ knockout threshold into the\ndip region. A fair agreement with the MiniBooNE and T2K data is reached.\n", "  Al2O3 is a potential dielectric material for metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)\ndevices. Al2O3 films deposited on semiconductors usually exhibit amorphous due\nto lattice mismatch. Compared to two-dimensional graphene, MoS2 is a typical\nsemiconductor, therefore, it has more extensive application. The\namorphous-Al2O3/MoS2 (a-Al2O3/MoS2) interface has attracted people's attention\nbecause of its unique properties. In this paper, the interface behaviors of\na-Al2O3/MoS2 under non-strain and biaxial strain are investigated by first\nprinciples calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). First of all,\nthe generation process of a-Al2O3 sample is described, which is calculated by\nmolecular dynamics and geometric optimization. Then, we introduce the band\nalignment method, and calculate band offset of a-Al2O3/MoS2 interface. It is\nfound that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO)\nchange with the number of MoS2 layers. The dependence of leakage current on the\nband offset is also illustrated. At last, the band structure of monolayer MoS2\nunder biaxial strain is discussed. The biaxial strain is set in the range from\n-6% to 6% with the interval of 2%. Impact of the biaxial strain on the band\nalignment is investigated.\n", "  The role of major mergers in galaxy evolution is investigated through a\ndetailed characterization of the stellar populations, ionized gas properties,\nand star formation rates (SFR) in the early-stage merger LIRGs IC 1623 W and\nNGC 6090, by analysing optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) and high\nresolution HST imaging. The spectra were processed with the Starlight full\nspectral fitting code, and the emission lines measured in the residual spectra.\nThe results are compared with control non-interacting spiral galaxies from the\nCALIFA survey. Merger-induced star formation is extended and recent, as\nrevealed by the young ages (50-80 Myr) and high contributions to light of young\nstellar populations (50-90$\\%$), in agreement with merger simulations in the\nliterature. These early-stage mergers have positive central gradients of the\nstellar metallicity, with an average $\\sim$0.6 Z$_{\\odot}$. Compared to\nnon-interacting spirals, they have lower central nebular metallicity, and\nflatter profiles, in agreement with the gas inflow scenario. We find that they\nare dominated by star formation, although shock excitation cannot be discarded\nin some regions, where high velocity dispersion is found (170-200 km s$^{-1}$).\nThe average SFR in these early-stage mergers ($\\sim$23-32 M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$) is enhanced with respect to main-sequence Sbc galaxies by factors of\n6-9, slightly above the predictions from classical merger simulations, but\nstill possible in about 15$\\%$ of major galaxy mergers, where U/LIRGs belong.\n", "  We show that three-dimensional information is critical to discerning the\neffects of parity violation in the primordial gravity-wave background. If\npresent, helical gravity waves induce parity-violating correlations in the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) between parity-odd polarization $B$-modes and\nparity-even temperature anisotropies ($T$) or polarization $E$-modes.\nUnfortunately, $EB$ correlations are much weaker than would be naively\nexpected, which we show is due to an approximate symmetry resulting from the\ntwo-dimensional nature of the CMB. The detectability of parity-violating\ncorrelations is exacerbated by the fact that the handedness of individual modes\ncannot be discerned in the two-dimensional CMB, leading to a noise contribution\nfrom scalar matter perturbations. In contrast, the tidal imprints of primordial\ngravity waves fossilized into the large-scale structure of the Universe are a\nthree-dimensional probe of parity violation. Using such fossils the handedness\nof gravity waves may be determined on a mode-by-mode basis, permitting future\nsurveys to probe helicity at the percent level if the amplitude of primordial\ngravity waves is near current observational upper limits.\n", "  Magnons - the quanta of spin waves - propagating in magnetic materials with\nwavelengths at the nanometer-scale and carrying information in the form of an\nangular momentum, can be used as data carriers in next-generation, nano-sized\nlow-loss information processing systems. In this respect, artificial magnetic\nmaterials with properties periodically varied in space, known as magnonic\ncrystals, are especially promising for controlling and manipulating the magnon\ncurrents. In this article, different approaches for the realization of static,\nreconfigurable, and dynamic magnonic crystals are presented along with a\nvariety of novel wave phenomena discovered in these crystals. Special attention\nis devoted to the utilization of magnonic crystals for processing of analog and\ndigital information.\n", "  According to the conjecture \"complexity equals action,\" the complexity of a\nholographic state is equal to the action of a Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch of\nblack holes in anti-de Sitter space. In this paper we calculate the action\ngrowth of charged black holes with a single horizon, paying attention to the\ncontribution from a spacelike singularity inside the horizon. We consider two\nkinds of such charged black holes: one is a charged dilaton black hole, and the\nother is a Born-Infeld black hole with $\\beta^2 Q^2<1/4$. In both cases,\nalthough an electric charge appears in the black hole solutions, the inner\nhorizon is absent, instead a spacelike singularity appears inside the horizon.\nWe find that the action growth of the WDW patch of the charged black hole is\nfinite and satisfies the Lloyd bound. As a check, we also calculate the action\ngrowth of a charged black hole with a phantom Maxwell field. In this case,\nalthough the contributions from the bulk integral and the spacelike singularity\nare individually divergent, these two divergences just cancel each other and a\nfinite action growth is obtained. But in this case, the Lloyd bound is violated\nas expected.\n", "  The geodesic motion on anti-de Sitter spacetimes is studied pointing out how\nthe trajectories are determined by the ten independent conserved quantities\nassociated to the specific SO(2,3) isometries of these manifolds. The new\nresult is that there are two conserved SO(3) vectors which play the same role\nas the Runge-Lenz vector of the Kepler problem, determining the major and minor\nsemiaxes of the ellipsoidal anti-de Sitter geodesics.\n", "  For a given many-electron molecule, it is possible to define a corresponding\none-electron Schr\\\"odinger equation, using potentials derived from simple\natomic densities, whose solution predicts fairly accurate molecular orbitals\nfor single- and multi-determinant wavefunctions for the molecule. The energy is\nnot predicted and must be evaluated by calculating Coulomb and exchange\ninteractions over the predicted orbitals. Potentials are found by minimizing\nthe energy of predicted wavefunctions. There exist slightly less accurate\naverage potentials for first-row atoms that can be used without modification in\ndifferent molecules. For a test set of molecules representing different bonding\nenvironments, these average potentials give wavefunctions with energies that\ndeviate from exact self-consistent field or configuration interaction energies\nby less than 0.08 eV and 0.03 eV per bond or valence electron pair,\nrespectively.\n", "  We study the real-time evolution of an electron influenced by intense\nelectromagnetic fields using the time-dependent basis light-front quantization\n(tBLFQ) framework. We focus on demonstrating the non-perturbative feature of\nthe tBLFQ approach through a realistic application of the strong coupling QED\nproblem, in which the electromagnetic fields are generated by an\nultra-relativistic nucleus. We calculate transitions of an electron influenced\nby such electromagnetic fields and we show agreement with light-front\nperturbation theory when the atomic number of the nucleus is small. We compare\ntBLFQ simulations with perturbative calculations for nuclei with different\natomic numbers, and obtain the significant higher-order contributions for heavy\nnuclei. The simulated real-time evolution of the momentum distribution of an\nelectron evolving inside the strong electromagnetic fields exhibits significant\nnon-perturbative corrections comparing to light-front perturbation theory\ncalculations. The formalism used in this investigation can be extended to QCD\nproblems in heavy ion collisions and electron ion collisions.\n", "  We investigate single- and double-$h$, the discovered Standard Model\n(SM)-like Higgs boson, production at future $e^+e^-$ colliders in Composite\n2-Higgs Doublet Models (C2HDMs) and Elementary 2-Higgs Doublet Models (E2HDMs)\nwith a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. We first survey their parameter spaces\nallowed by theoretical bounds from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability\nas well as by future data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an integrated\nluminosity up to 3000 fb$^{-1}$ under the assumption that no new Higgs boson is\ndetected. We then discuss how different the cross sections can be between the\ntwo scenarios when $\\kappa_V^{}$, the $hVV$ ($V=W^\\pm,Z$) coupling normalised\nto the SM value, is taken to be the same value in the both scenario We find\nthat if $\\kappa_V^2$ is found to be, e.g., $0.98$, then the cross sections in\nC2HDMs with $f$ (the compositeness scale) in the TeV region can be maximally\nchanged to be about $-15\\%$, $-18\\%$, $-50\\%$ and $-35\\%$ for the $e^+e^-\\to t\n\\bar t h$, $e^+e^-\\to Zhh$, $e^+e^-\\to e^+e^-hh$ and $e^+e^-\\to t\\bar{t}hh$\nprocesses, respectively, with respect to those in E2HDMs. Thus, a future\nelectron-positron collider has the potential to discriminate between E2HDMs and\nC2HDMs, even when only $h$ event rates are measured.\n", "  (abridged) The dominant thermal mechanisms in the neutral interstellar\nmedium, which acts as a star-forming gas reservoir, are uncertain in extremely\nmetal-poor galaxies. Our objective is to identify the heating mechanisms in one\nsuch galaxy, IZw18, and assess the diagnostic value of fine-structure cooling\nlines. We also seek to constrain the mass of H$_2$, which, despite being an\nimportant catalyst and tracer of star formation, remains elusive in this\nobject. Building on a previous photoionization model within a multi-sector\ntopology, we provide additional constraints from the [CII] and [OI] lines and\nthe dust mass recently measured with Herschel. The heating of the HI region\nappears to be mainly due to photoionization by radiation from a bright X-ray\nbinary source, while photoelectric effect (PE) is negligible. The [CII] and\n[OI] lines imply an average X-ray luminosity of $4\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nwhile the [NeV] upper limits bring strong constraints to the soft X-ray flux\narising from the binary. A negligible amount of H$_2$ is predicted, but\n$\\lesssim10^7$ M$_\\odot$ of H$_2$ may be hidden in sufficiently dense clouds of\norder $\\lesssim10$ pc in size. Regardless of the presence of significant\namounts of H$_2$, [CII] and [OI] do not trace the so-called CO-dark gas, but\nthe almost purely atomic medium. Although the [CII]+[OI]/TIR ratio is close to\nvalues found in more metal-rich sources, it cannot be safely used as a PE\nheating efficiency proxy. This ratio seems to be kept stable due to a\ncorrelation between the X-ray luminosity and the star-formation rate. We\npropose that X-ray heating is an important process in extremely metal-poor\nsources. The weak PE heating due to the low dust-to-gas ratio could be\ncompensated for by the larger occurrence and power of X-ray binaries in\nlow-metallicity galaxies. We speculate that X-ray heating may quench star\nformation.\n", "  We present a novel approximation method that can predict the number of\nsolitons asymptotically appearing under arbitrary rapidly decreasing initial\nwave packets. The number of solitons can be estimated without integration of\nthe original soliton equations. As an example, we take the one-dimensional\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation and estimate the behaviors of the scattering\namplitude in detail. The results show good agreement compared with those\nobtained by direct numerical integration. The presented method is applicable to\na wide class of one-dimensional soliton equations.\n", "  Through experiments and numerical simulations we explore the behavior of rf\nSQUID (radio frequency superconducting quantum interference device)\nmetamaterials, which show extreme tunability and nonlinearity. The emergent\nelectromagnetic properties of this metamaterial are sensitive to the degree of\ncoherent response of the driven interacting SQUIDs. Coherence suffers in the\npresence of disorder, which is experimentally found to be mainly due to a dc\nflux gradient. We demonstrate methods to recover the coherence, specifically by\nvarying the coupling between the SQUID meta-atoms and increasing the\ntemperature or the amplitude of the applied rf flux.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of shear viscosity in the presence of small\nanisotropy and a finite chemical potential. First, we construct an anisotropic\nReissner Nordstr{\\\"o}m blackbrane in 5 dimensions in a simple Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory with a small linear dilaton. This solution is characterized by three\nmass scales : anisotropy $\\rho$, temperature T and chemical potential $\\mu$. We\nfind this solution upto second order in the dilaton anisotropy parameter\n$\\rho$. This blackbrane solution corresponds to an anisotropic phase where the\nanisotropy is small compared to the temperature and chemical potential. We find\nthat in this anisotropic phase, some components of the anisotropic shear\nviscosity tensor, which are spin one with respect to the residual symmetry\nafter breaking rotational invariance, violates the KSS bound (${\\eta \\over\ns}\\ge {1 \\over 4 \\pi} $) proposed by Kovtun, Son and Starinets. We identify the\nregions of the parameter space where these violations are significant. We carry\nout a similar analysis in 4 dimensions and find similar violation of the KSS\nbound for the spin one components to demonstrate the generality of the result.\nOur results are particularly relevant in the context of strongly coupled\nsystems found in nature. We also provide an intuitive understanding of the\nresults using dimensional reduction and a Boltzmann calculation in a weakly\ncoupled version of a similar system. The Boltzmann analysis performed in a\nsystem of weakly interacting particles in a linear potential also shows that\ncomponents of the viscosity tensor may be reduced. It is intriguing that the\nBoltzmann analysis also predicts the corrections to be negative and that too in\na manner similar to the anisotropic strongly coupled theories with smooth\ngravity duals.\n", "  We study two Weyl semimetal generalizations in five dimensions (5d) which\nhave Yang monopoles and linked Weyl surfaces in the Brillouin zone,\nrespectively, and carry the second Chern number as a topological number. In\nparticular, we show a Yang monopole naturally reduces to a Hopf link of two\nWeyl surfaces when the $\\mathbf{TP}$ (time-reversal combined with\nspace-inversion) symmetry is broken. We then examine the phase transition\nbetween insulators with different topological numbers in 5d. In analogy to the\n3d case, 5d Weyl semimetals emerge as intermediate phases during the\ntopological phase transition.\n", "  We demonstrate photon counting at 1550 nm wavelength using microwave kinetic\ninductance detectors (MKIDs) made from TiN/Ti/TiN trilayer films with\nsuperconducting transition temperature Tc ~ 1.4 K. The detectors have a\nlumped-element design with a large interdigitated capacitor (IDC) covered by\naluminum and inductive photon absorbers whose volume ranges from 0.4 um^3 to 20\num^3. We find that the energy resolution improves as the absorber volume is\nreduced. We have achieved an energy resolution of 0.22 eV and resolved up to 7\nphotons per pulse, both greatly improved from previously reported results at\n1550 nm wavelength using MKIDs. Further improvements are possible by optimizing\nthe optical coupling to maximize photon absorption into the inductive absorber.\n", "  We discuss effects of the brane-localized mass terms on the fixed points of\nthe toroidal orbifold $T^2/Z_2$ under the presence of background magnetic\nfluxes, where multiple lowest and higher-level Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are\nrealized before introducing the localized masses in general. Through the\nknowledge of linear algebra, we find that, in each KK level, one of or more\nthan one of the degenerate KK modes are almost inevitably perturbed, when\nsingle or multiple brane-localized mass terms are introduced. When the typical\nscale of the compactification is far above the electroweak scale or the TeV\nscale, we apply this mechanism for uplifting unwanted massless or light modes\nwhich are prone to appear in models on magnetized orbifolds.\n", "  We evaluate the parity-odd part of the effective action due to massive Dirac\nfermions on a $S^2 \\times S^1$ manifold, minimally coupled to an external\nAbelian gauge field. We do that for a special class of gauge-field\nconfigurations, which is specially suitable to the study of the behaviour of\nthe fermionic determinant under large gauge field configurations, which are\nallowed by the space-time geometry.\n", "  A new relativistic method based on the Dirac equation for calculating fully\ndifferential cross sections for ionization in ion-atom collisions is developed.\nThe method is applied to ionization of the atomic hydrogen by antiproton\nimpact, as a non-relativistic benchmark. The fully differential, as well as\nvarious doubly and singly differential cross sections for ionization are\npresented. The role of the interaction between the projectile and the target\nnucleus is discussed. Several discrepancies in available theoretical\npredictions are resolved. The relativistic effects are studied for ionization\nof hydrogenlike xenon ion under the impact of carbon nuclei.\n", "  We present a definition of the geoid that is based on the formalism of\ngeneral relativity without approximations; i.e. it allows for arbitrarily\nstrong gravitational fields. For this reason, it applies not only to the Earth\nand other planets but also to compact objects such as neutron stars. We define\nthe geoid as a level surface of a time-independent redshift potential. Such a\nredshift potential exists in any stationary spacetime. Therefore, our geoid is\nwell defined for any rigidly rotating object with constant angular velocity and\na fixed rotation axis that is not subject to external forces. Our definition is\noperational because the level surfaces of a redshift potential can be realized\nwith the help of standard clocks, which may be connected by optical fibers.\nTherefore, these surfaces are also called isochronometric surfaces. We\ndeliberately base our definition of a relativistic geoid on the use of clocks\nsince we believe that clock geodesy offers the best methods for probing\ngravitational fields with highest precision in the future. However, we also\npoint out that our definition of the geoid is mathematically equivalent to a\ndefinition in terms of an acceleration potential, i.e. that our geoid may also\nbe viewed as a level surface orthogonal to plumb lines. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that our definition reduces to the known Newtonian and\npost-Newtonian notions in the appropriate limits. As an illustration, we\ndetermine the isochronometric surfaces for rotating observers in axisymmetric\nstatic and axisymmetric stationary solutions to Einstein's vacuum field\nequation, with the Schwarzschild metric, the Erez-Rosen metric, the q-metric\nand the Kerr metric as particular examples.\n", "  How to detect quantum correlations in bi-partite scenarios using a split\nmany-body system and collective measurements on each party? We address this\nquestion by deriving entanglement witnesses using either only first or first\nand second order moments of local collective spin components. In both cases, we\nderive optimal witnesses for spatially split spin squeezed states in the\npresence of local white noise. We then compare the two optimal witnesses with\nrespect to their resistance to various noise sources operating either at the\npreparation or at the detection level. We finally evaluate the statistics\nrequired to estimate the value of these witnesses when measuring a split\nspin-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. Our results can be seen as a step\ntowards Bell tests with many-body systems.\n", "  In this article, we will construct the additional perturbative quantum torus\nsymmetry of the dispersionless BKP hierarchy basing on the $W_{\\infty}$\ninfinite dimensional Lie symmetry. These results show that the complete quantum\ntorus symmetry is broken from the BKP hierarchy to its dispersionless\nhierarchy. Further a series of additional flows of the multicomponent BKP\nhierarchy will be defined and these flows constitute an $N$-folds direct\nproduct of the positive half of the quantum torus symmetries.\n", "  In this work, we have characterized changes in the dynamics of a\ntwo-dimensional relativistic standard map in the presence of dissipation and\nspecially when it is submitted to thermal effects modeled by a Gaussian noise\nreservoir. By the addition of thermal noise in the dissipative relativistic\nstandard map (DRSM) it is possible to suppress typical stable periodic\nstructures (SPSs) embedded in the chaotic domains of parameter space for large\nenough temperature strengths. Smaller SPSs are first affected by thermal\neffects, starting from their borders, as a function of temperature. To estimate\nthe necessary temperature strength capable to destroy those SPSs we use the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent to obtain the critical temperature ($T_C$) diagrams.\nFor critical temperatures the chaotic behavior takes place with the suppression\nof periodic motion, although, the temperature strengths considered in this work\nare not so large to convert the deterministic features of the underlying system\ninto a stochastic ones.\n", "  We present a simple prescription for the rotation of polarization produced by\na relativistically moving gravitational lens, applicable to arbitrary\ndeflection angle and arbitrary velocity of the lens. When geometric optics is\napplicable, two independent components contribute to the total rotation of\npolarization: (i) in the frame of the lens the polarization vector experiences\nminimal rotation defined by the deflection angle (as measured by a set of\nremote observers, or no rotation if defined in terms of parallel-propagated\ntetrad); (ii) the effect of the motion of the lens on the polarization can be\ntaken into account exactly using special relativistic Lorentz transformation of\npolarization. The effects of the gravitational lensing are thus parametrized by\nthe deflection angle of the null geodesics (not necessarily small) and the\nmotion of the lens (not necessarily with velocities much smaller than that of\nlight).\n", "  Here we introduce the interstellar dust modelling framework THEMIS (The\nHeterogeneous dust Evolution Model for Interstellar Solids), which takes a\nglobal view of dust and its evolution in response to the local conditions in\ninterstellar media. This approach is built upon a core model that was developed\nto explain the dust extinction and emission in the diffuse interstellar medium.\nThe model was then further developed to self-consistently include the effects\nof dust evolution in the transition to denser regions. The THEMIS approach is\nunder continuous development and currently we are extending the framework to\nexplore the implications of dust evolution in HII regions and the\nphoton-dominated regions associated with star formation. We provide links to\nthe THEMIS, DustEM and DustPedia websites where more information about the\nmodel, its input data and applications can be found.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the generations of topological\ndefects when a system undergoes a second-order phase transition via quenches.\nWe study the holographic KZ scaling using holographic superconductors. The\nscaling can be understood analytically from a scaling analysis of the bulk\naction. The argument is reminiscent of the scaling analysis of the mean-field\ntheory but is more subtle and is not entirely obvious. This is because the\nscaling is not the one of the original bulk theory but is an emergent one that\nappears only at the critical point. The analysis is also useful to determine\nthe dynamic critical exponent $z$.\n", "  The high-frequency vibration of the imaging system degrades the quality of\nthe reconstruction of ptychography by acting as a low-pass filter on ideal\ndiffraction patterns. In this study, we demonstrate that by subtracting the\ndeliberately blurred diffraction patterns from the recorded patterns and adding\nthe properly amplified subtraction to the original data, the high-frequency\ncomponents lost by the vibration of the setup can be recovered, and thus the\nimage quality can be distinctly improved. Because no prior knowledge regarding\nthe vibrating properties of the imaging system is needed, the proposed method\nis general and simple and has applications in several research fields.\n", "  We study electronic image states around a metallic nanoring and show that the\ninterplay between the attractive polarization force and a repulsive centrifugal\nforce gives rise to Rydberg-like image states trapped several nanometers away\nfrom the surface. The nanoring is modeled as a perfectly conducting isolated\ntorus whose electrostatic image potential is derived analytically. The image\nstates are computed via a two-dimensional finite-difference scheme as solutions\nof the effective Schr\\\"odinger equation describing the outer electron subject\nto this image potential. These findings demonstrate not only the existence of\ndetached image states around nanorings but allow us also to provide general\ncriteria on the ring geometry, i.e. the aspect ratio of the torus, that need to\nbe fulfilled in order to support such states.\n", "  It has been proposed recently (Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 (2015), 022001) that the\ncharmoniumlike state named X(3915) and suggested to be a $0^{++}$ scalar, is\njust the helicity-0 realisation of the $2^{++}$ tensor state $\\chi_{c2}(3930)$.\nThis scenario would call for a helicity-0 dominance, which were at odds with\nthe properties of a conventional tensor charmonium, but might be compatible\nwith some exotic structure of the $\\chi_{c2}(3930)$. In this paper, we\ninvestigate, if such a scenario is compatible with the assumption that the\n$\\chi_{c2}(3930)$ is a $D^*\\bar D^*$ molecular state - a spin partner of the\n$X(3872)$ treated as a shallow bound state. We demonstrate that for a tensor\nmolecule the helicity-0 component vanishes for vanishing binding energy and\naccordingly for a shallow bound state a helicity-2 dominance would be natural.\nHowever, for the $\\chi_{c2}(3930)$, residing about 100 MeV below the $D^*\\bar\nD^*$ threshold, there is no a priori reason for a helicity-2 dominance and thus\nthe proposal formulated in the above mentioned reference might indeed point at\na molecular structure of the tensor state. Nevertheless, we find that the\nexperimental data currently available favour a dominant contribution of the\nhelicity-2 amplitude also in this scenario, if spin symmetry arguments are\nemployed to relate properties of the molecular state to those of the X(3872).\nWe also discuss what research is necessary to further constrain the analysis.\n", "  Context. Recent studies on Kappa distribution functions invoked in space\nplasma applications have emphasized two alternative approaches which may assume\nthe temperature parameter either dependent or independent of the power-index\n$\\kappa$. Each of them can obtain justification in different scenarios\ninvolving Kappa-distributed plasmas, but direct evidences supporting any of\nthese two alternatives with measurements from laboratory or natural plasmas are\nnot available yet. Aims. This paper aims to provide more facts on this\nintriguing issue from direct fitting measurements of suprathermal electron\npopulations present in the solar wind, as well as from their destabilizing\neffects predicted by these two alternating approaches. Methods. Two fitting\nmodels are contrasted, namely, the global Kappa and the dual Maxwellian-Kappa\nmodels, which are currently invoked in theory and observations. The\ndestabilizing effects of suprathermal electrons are characterized on the basis\nof a kinetic approach which accounts for the microscopic details of the\nvelocity distribution. Results. In order to be relevant, the model is chosen to\naccurately reproduce the observed distributions and this is achieved by a dual\nMaxwellian-Kappa distribution function. A statistical survey indicates a\n$\\kappa$-dependent temperature of the suprathermal (halo) electrons for any\nheliocentric distance. Only for this approach the instabilities driven by the\ntemperature anisotropy are found to be systematically stimulated by the\nabundance of suprathermal populations, i.e., lowering the values of\n$\\kappa$-index.\n", "  We construct the most general, to cubic order in curvature, theory of gravity\nwhose (most general) static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are fully\ndescribed by a single field equation. The theory possess the following\nremarkable properties: i) it has a well-defined Einstein gravity limit ii) it\nadmits `Schwarzschild-like' solutions characterized by a single metric function\niii) on maximally symmetric backgrounds it propagates the same degrees of\nfreedom as Einstein's gravity iv) Lovelock and quasi-topological gravities, as\nwell as the recently developed Einsteinian cubic gravity [ArXiv:1607.06463] in\nfour dimensions, are recovered as special cases. We perform a brief analysis of\nasymptotically flat black holes in this theory and study their thermodynamics.\n", "  We construct a class of five dimensional black hole solutions to cubic\nquasi-topological gravity with conformal scalar hair and study their\nthermodynamics. We find these black holes provide the second example of black\nhole $\\lambda$-lines: a line of second order (continuous) phase transitions,\nakin to the fluid/superfluid transition of $^4$He. Examples of isolated\ncritical points are found for spherical black holes, marking the first in the\nliterature to date. We also find various novel and interesting phase\nstructures, including an isolated critical point occurring in conjunction with\na double reentrant phase transition. The AdS vacua of the theory are studied,\nfinding ghost-free configurations where the scalar field takes on a non-zero\nconstant value, in notable contrast to the five dimensional Lovelock case.\n", "  We study the cosmological dynamics of D-BIonic and DBI scalar field, which is\ncoupled to matter fluid. For the exponential potential and the exponential\ncouplings, we find a new analytic scaling solution yielding the accelerated\nexpansion of the Universe. Since it is shown to be an attractor for some range\nof the coupling parameters, the density parameter of matter fluid can be the\nobserved value, as in the coupled quintessence with a canonical scalar field.\nContrary to the usual coupled quintessence, where the value of matter couple\ngiving observed density parameter is too large to satisfy observational\nconstraint from CMB, we show that the D-BIonic theory can give similar solution\nwith much smaller value of matter coupling. As a result, together with the fact\nthat the D-BIonic theory has a screening mechanism, the D-BIonic theory can\nsolve the so-called coincidence problem as well as the dark energy problem.\n", "  Arrays of qubits encoded in the ground-state manifold of neutral atoms\ntrapped in optical (or magnetic) lattices appear to be a promising platform for\nthe realization of a scalable quantum computer. Two-qubit conditional gates\nbetween nearest-neighbor qubits in the array can be implemented by exploiting\nthe Rydberg blockade mechanism, as was shown by D. Jaksch et al. [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 85, 2208 (2000)]. However, the energy shift due to dipole-dipole\ninteractions causing the blockade falls off rapidly with the interatomic\ndistance and protocols based on direct Rydberg blockade typically fail to\noperate between atoms separated by more than one lattice site. In this work, we\npropose an extension of the protocol of Jaksch \\emph{et al.}\\ for controlled-Z\nand controlled-NOT gates which works in the general case where the qubits are\nnot nearest-neighbor in the array. Our proposal relies on the Rydberg\nexcitation hopping along a chain of ancilla non-coding atoms connecting the\nqubits on which the gate is to be applied. The dependence of the gate fidelity\non the number of ancilla atoms, the blockade strength and the decay rates of\nthe Rydberg states is investigated. A comparison between our implementation of\ndistant controlled-NOT gate and one based on a sequence of nearest-neighbor\ntwo-qubit gates is also provided.\n", "  Sometimes the early star formation can be found in cold and dense molecular\nclouds, such as infrared dark cloud (IRDC). Considering star formation often\noccurs in clustered condition, HII regions may be triggering a new generation\nof star formation, so we can search for initial stage of massive star formation\naround HII regions. Based on that above, this work is to introduce one method\nof how to search for initial stage of massive star formation around HII\nregions. Towards one sample of the HII region G18.2-0.3, multiwavelength\nobservations are carried out to investigate its physical condition. In contrast\nand analysis, we find three potential initial stages of massive star formation,\nsuggesting that it is feasible to search for initial stage of massive star\nformation around HII regions.\n", "  Seismic data quality is vital to geophysical applications, so methods of data\nrecovery, including denoising and interpolation, are common initial steps in\nthe seismic data processing flow. We present a method to perform simultaneous\ninterpolation and denoising, which is based on double-sparsity dictionary\nlearning. This extends previous work that was for denoising only. The original\ndouble sparsity dictionary learning algorithm is modified to track the traces\nwith missing data by defining a masking operator that is integrated into the\nsparse representation of the dictionary. A weighted low-rank approximation\nalgorithm is adopted to handle the dictionary updating as a sparse recovery\noptimization problem constrained by the masking operator. Compared to\ntraditional sparse transforms with fixed dictionaries that lack the ability to\nadapt to complex data structures, the double-sparsity dictionary learning\nmethod learns the signal adaptively from selected patches of the corrupted\nseismic data while preserving compact forward and inverse transform operators.\nNumerical experiments on synthetic seismic data indicate that this new method\npreserves more subtle features in the dataset without introducing pseudo-Gibbs\nartifacts when compared to other directional multiscale transform methods such\nas curvelets.\n", "  The pair density wave (PDW) superconducting state has been proposed to\nexplain the layer- decoupling effect observed in the compound\nLa$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ at $x=1/8$ (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 127003). In this state\nthe superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, in contrast with\nthe usual superconducting (SC) state where the order parameter is uniform. In\nthis work, we study the properties of the amplitude (Higgs) modes in a\nunidirectional PDW state. To this end we consider a phenomenological model of\nPDW type states coupled to a Fermi surface of fermionic quasiparticles. In\ncontrast to conventional superconductors that have a single Higgs mode,\nunidirectional PDW superconductors have two Higgs modes. While in the PDW state\nthe Fermi surface largely remains gapless, we find that the damping of the PDW\nHiggs modes into fermionic quasiparticles requires exceeding an energy\nthreshold. We show that this suppression of damping in the PDW state is due to\nkinematics. As a result, only one of the two Higgs modes is significantly\ndamped. In addition, motivated by the experimental phase diagram, we discuss\nthe mixing of Higgs modes in the coexistence regime of the PDW and uniform SC\nstates. These results should be observable directly in a Raman spectroscopy, in\nmomentum resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, and in resonant inelastic\nX-ray scattering, thus providing evidence of the PDW states.\n", "  An alternative to Density Functional Theory are wavefunction based electronic\nstructure calculations for solids. In order to perform them the Exponential\nWall (EW) problem has to be resolved. It is caused by an exponential increase\nof the number of configurations with increasing electron number N. There are\ndifferent routes one may follow. One is to characterize a many-electron\nwavefunction by a vector in Liouville space with a cumulant metric rather than\nin Hilbert space. This removes the EW problem. Another is to model the solid by\nan {\\it impurity} or {\\it fragment} embedded in a {\\it bath} which is treated\nat a much lower level than the former. This is the case in Density Matrix\nEmbedding Theory (DMET) or Density Embedding Theory (DET). The latter are\nclosely related to a Schmidt decomposition of a system and to the determination\nof the associated entanglement. We show here the connection between the two\napproaches. It turns out that the DMET (or DET) has an identical active space\nas a previously used Local Ansatz, based on a projection and partitioning\napproach. Yet, the EW problem is resolved differently in the two cases. By\nstudying a $H_{10}$ ring these differences are analyzed with the help of the\nmethod of increments.\n", "  We report frequency measurement of the clock transition in an 115In+ ion\nsympathetically-cooled with Ca+ ions in a linear rf trap. The Ca+ ions are used\nas a probe of the external electromagnetic field and as the coolant for\npreparing the cold In+. The frequency is determined to be 1 267 402 452 901\n049.9 (6.9) Hz by averaging 36 measurements using an optical frequency comb\nreferenced to the frequency standards located in the same site.\n", "  When a small, uncharged, compact object is immersed in an external background\nspacetime, at zeroth order in its mass it moves as a test particle in the\nbackground. At linear order, its own gravitational field alters the geometry\naround it, and it moves instead as a test particle in a certain effective\nmetric satisfying the linearized vacuum Einstein equation. In the letter [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 109, 051101 (2012)], using a method of matched asymptotic\nexpansions, I showed that the same statement holds true at second order: if the\nobject's leading-order spin and quadrupole moment vanish, then through second\norder in its mass it moves on a geodesic of a certain smooth, locally causal\nvacuum metric defined in its local neighbourhood. Here I present the complete\ndetails of the derivation of that result. In addition, I extend the result,\nwhich had previously been derived in gauges smoothly related to Lorenz, to a\nclass of highly regular gauges that should be optimal for numerical self-force\ncomputations.\n", "  We study the grand unification model flipped $SU(5)$ with additional\nvector-like particle multiplets, or ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ for short, in the\nframework of General No-Scale Supergravity. In our analysis we allow the\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking soft terms to be generically non-zero, thereby\nextending the phenomenologically viable parameter space beyond the highly\nconstrained one-parameter version of ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$. In this initial\ninquiry, the mSUGRA/CMSSM SUSY breaking terms are implemented. We find this\neasing away from the vanishing SUSY breaking terms enables a more broad mass\nrange of vector-like particles, dubbed flippons, including flippons less than 1\nTeV that could presently be observed at the LHC2, as well as a lighter gluino\nmass and SUSY spectrum overall. This presents heightened odds that the General\nNo-Scale ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ viable parameter space can be probed at the LHC2.\nThe phenomenology comprises both bino and higgsino dark matter, including a\nHiggs funnel region. Particle states emerging from the SUSY cascade decays are\npresented to experimentally distinguish amongst the diverse phenomenological\nregions.\n", "  Advanced diffractive films may afford advantages over passive reflective\nsurfaces for a variety space missions that use solar or laser in-space\npropulsion. Three cases are compared: Sun-facing diffractive sails, Littrow\ndiffraction configurations, and conventional reflective sails. A simple\nEarth-to-Mars orbit transfer at a constant attitude with respect to the\nsun-line finds no penalty for transparent diffractive sails. Advantages of the\nlatter approach include actively controlled metasails and the reuse of photons.\n", "  We use general hydrodynamic equations to determine the long-wavelength spin\nexcitations in isotropic antiferromagnets in the presence of a homogeneous\nmagnetization. The latter may be induced, such as in antiferromagnets in an\nexternal magnetic field, or spontaneous, such as in ferrimagnetic or canted\nphases that are characterized by the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic order. Depending on the physical situation, we find propagating\nspin waves that are gapped in some cases and gapless in others, diffusive\nmodes, or relaxational modes. The excitation spectra turn out to be\nqualitatively different depending on whether or not the homogeneous\nmagnetization is a conserved quantity. The results lay the foundation for a\ndescription of a variety of quantum phase transitions, including the transition\nfrom a ferromagnetic metal to an antiferromagnetic one, and the spin-flop\ntransitions that are observed in some antiferromagnets. They also are crucial\nfor incorporating weak-localization and Altshuler-Aronov effects into the\ndescriptions of quantum phases in both clean and disordered magnetic metals.\n", "  Remarkable mathematical properties of the integrable nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (NLSE) can offer advanced solutions for the mitigation of nonlinear\nsignal distortions in optical fibre links. Fundamental optical soliton,\ncontinuous and discrete eigenvalues of the nonlinear spectrum have already been\nconsidered for transmission of information in fibre-optic channels. Here we\npropose to apply signal modulation to the kernel of the\nGelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equations (GLME) that offers the advantage of a\nrelatively simple decoder design. First, we describe an approach based on\nexploiting the general N-soliton solution of the NLSE for simultaneous coding\nof $N$ symbols involving $4\\times N$ coding parameters. As a specific elegant\nsub-class of the general schemes we introduce a soliton orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (SOFDM) method. This method is based on the choice of\nidentical imaginary parts of the N-soliton solution eigenvalues, corresponding\nto equidistant soliton frequencies making it similar to the conventional OFDM\nscheme, thus, allowing use of the efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm to\nrecover the data. Then, we demonstrate how to use this new approach to control\nsignal parameters in the case of the continuous spectrum.\n", "  The occupancies and entropic entanglement measures for the ground state of\ntwo particles in a two-dimensional harmonic anisotropic trap are studied. We\nimplement a method to study the large interaction strength limit for different\nshort- and long-range interaction potentials that allows to obtain the exact\nentanglement spectrum and several entropies. We show that for long-range\ninteractions, the von Neumann, min-entropy and the family of R\\'enyi entropies\nremain finite for the anisotropic traps and diverge logarithmically for the\nisotropic traps. In the short-range interaction case the entanglement measures\ndiverge for any anisotropic parameter due to the divergence of uncertainty in\nthe momentum since for short-range interactions the relative position width\nvanishes. We also show that when the reduced density matrix has finite support\nthe R\\'enyi entropies present a non-analytical behaviour.\n", "  We discuss the applicability of the Wong formula for fusion cross sections in\na single-channel problem. To this end, we carry out a systematic study and\ncompare the approximate fusion cross sections with the exact results in a wide\nmass region of reaction systems. We show that the deviation of the approximate\nresults from the exact cross sections is large for light systems, even though\nthe Wong formula provides a reasonable approximation for heavy systems. We also\ndiscuss the energy dependence of the deviation, and show that for a given\nprojectile nucleus the critical energy, at which the deviation exceeds 5\\% of\nthe exact cross sections, increases as a function of the mass number of the\ntarget nucleus.\n", "  Magnetised exoplanets are expected to emit at radio frequencies analogously\nto the radio auroral emission of Earth and Jupiter. We predict the radio\nemission from V830 Tau b, the youngest (2 Myr) detected exoplanet to date. We\nmodel the host star wind using 3DMHD simulations that take into account its\nsurface magnetism. With this, we constrain the local conditions around V830 Tau\nb that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio\nflux densities of 6 to 24mJy, depending on the assumed radius of the planet\n(one or two Rjupiter). These radio fluxes are present peaks that are up to\ntwice the average values. We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent\n(a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100G),\nopposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to\n240MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By\ncomparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we\nconstrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values\nbetween ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the\nradio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of\n275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,\ncould be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically\nthick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. Planetary emission can only\npropagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission\nexceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency. For that, we find that for planetary\nradio emission to propagate through the host star wind, planetary magnetic\nfield strengths larger than ~1.3 to 13 G are required. The V830 Tau system is a\nvery interesting system for conducting radio observations from both the\nperspective of radio emission from the planet as well as from the host star's\nwind.\n", "  We review recent theoretical and experimental progress on the role of\ntwo-photon exchange (TPE) in electron-proton scattering at low to moderate\nmomentum transfers. We make a detailed comparison and analysis of the results\nof competing experiments on the ratio of e+p to e-p elastic scattering cross\nsections, and of the theoretical calculations describing them. A summary of the\ncurrent experimental situation is provided, along with an outlook for future\nexperiments.\n", "  Charge-neutral 180$^\\circ$ domain walls that separate domains of antiparallel\npolarization directions are common structural topological defects in\nferroelectrics. In normal ferroelectrics, charged 180$^\\circ$ domain walls\nrunning perpendicular to the polarization directions are highly energetically\nunfavorable because of the depolarization field and are difficult to stabilize.\nWe explore both neutral and charged 180$^\\circ$ domain walls in\nhyperferroelectrics, a class of proper ferroelectrics with persistent\npolarization in the presence of a depolarization field, using density\nfunctional theory. We obtain zero temperature equilibrium structures of\nhead-to-head and tail-to-tail walls in recently discovered $ABC$-type hexagonal\nhyperferroelectrics. Charged domain walls can also be stabilized in canonical\nferroelectrics represented by LiNbO$_3$ without any dopants, defects or\nmechanical clamping. First-principles electronic structure calculations show\nthat charged domain walls can reduce and even close the band gap of host\nmaterials and support quasi-two-dimensional electron(hole) gas with enhanced\nelectrical conductivity.\n", "  A systematic analysis of correlations between different orders of\n$p_T$-differential flow is presented, including mode coupling effects in flow\nvectors, correlations between flow angles (a.k.a. event-plane correlations),\nand correlations between flow magnitudes, all of which were previously studied\nwith integrated flows. We find that the mode coupling effects among\ndifferential flows largely mirror those among the corresponding integrated\nflows, except at small transverse momenta where mode coupling contributions are\nsmall. For the fourth- and fifth-order flow vectors $V_4$ and $V_5$ we argue\nthat the event plane correlations can be understood as the ratio between the\nmode coupling contributions to these flows and and the flow magnitudes. We also\nfind that for $V_4$ and $V_5$ the linear response contribution scales linearly\nwith the corresponding cumulant-defined eccentricities but not with the\nstandard eccentricities.\n", "  When a spacetime has boundaries, the entangling surface does not have to be\nnecessarily compact and it may have boundaries as well. Then there appear a\nnew, boundary, contribution to the entanglement entropy due to the intersection\nof the entangling surface with the boundary of the spacetime. We study the\nboundary contribution to the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy in\ndimensions $d=3$ and $d=4$ when the entangling surface is orthogonal to the\nboundary. In particular, we compute a boundary term in the entropy of\n${\\mathcal{N}}=4$ super-gauge multiplet at weak coupling. This result is\ncompared with the holographic calculation of the entropy based on the\nRyu-Takayanagi proposal adapted appropriately to the present situation. We find\na complete agreement between these two calculations provided the boundary\nconditions imposed on the gauge multiplet preserve $1/2$ of the supersymmetry\nand the extension of the boundary into the AdS bulk is a minimal hypersurface.\n", "  Chiral multiferroic langasites have attracted attention due to their\ndoubly-chiral magnetic ground state within an enantiomorphic crystal. We report\non a detailed resonant soft X-ray diffraction study of the multiferroic\nBa$_3$TaFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ and oxygen $K$ edges. Below\n$T_N$ ($\\approx27K$) we observe the satellite reflections $(0,0,\\tau)$,\n$(0,0,2\\tau)$, $(0,0,3\\tau)$ and $(0,0,1-3\\tau)$ where $\\tau \\approx 0.140 \\pm\n0.001$. The dependence of the scattering intensity on X-ray polarization and\nazimuthal angle indicate that the odd harmonics are dominated by the\nout-of-plane ($\\mathbf{\\hat{c}}$-axis) magnetic dipole while the $(0,0,2\\tau)$\noriginates from the electron density distortions accompanying magnetic order.\nWe observe dissimilar energy dependences of the diffraction intensity of the\npurely magnetic odd-harmonic satellites at the Fe $L_3$ edge. Utilizing\nfirst-principles calculations, we show that this is a consequence of the loss\nof threefold crystal symmetry in the multiferroic phase.\n", "  We investigate the ground state properties of ultracold atoms with long range\ninteractions trapped in a two leg ladder configuration in the presence of an\nartificial magnetic field. Using a Gross-Pitaevskii approach and a mean field\nGutzwiller variational method, we explore both the weakly interacting and\nstrongly interacting regime, respectively. We calculate the boundaries between\nthe density-wave/supersolid and the Mott-insulator/superfluid phases as a\nfunction of magnetic flux and uncover regions of supersolidity. The mean-field\nresults are confirmed by numerical simulations using a cluster mean field\napproach.\n", "  Vortices are widely studied in fields ranging from nonlinear optics to\nmagnetic systems and superconductors. A vortex carries a binary information\ncorresponding to its topological charge, `plus' or `minus', that can be used\nfor information storage and processing. In spatially extended optical and\ncondensed many-particle systems, achieving full control over vortex formation\nand its charge is particularly difficult and is not easily extended to systems\nof multiple vortices. Here we demonstrate the optical creation of multiplets of\nphase-locked vortices in polariton condensates using off-resonant excitation\nwith ring-shaped pump beams. We find that the vorticity of one vortex can be\ncontrolled solely using the phase-locking with other nearby vortices. Using\nthis mechanism, we demonstrate how an existing vortex with a specific\ntopological charge can be inverted to the oppositely charged state, and how the\ncharge state of one reference vortex can be copied to a neighboring vortex.\nThis way we can optically encode any set of binary information onto a chain of\nvortices. We further show that this information can be modified later by using\nthe possibility to address and manipulate each vortex in the chain\nindividually.\n", "  Within the standard three-neutrino framework, the absolute neutrino masses\nand their ordering (either normal, NO, or inverted, IO) are currently unknown.\nHowever, the combination of current data coming from oscillation experiments,\nneutrinoless double beta decay searches, and cosmological surveys, can provide\ninteresting constraints for such unknowns in the sub-eV mass range, down to\nO(0.1) eV in some cases. We discuss current limits on absolute neutrino mass\nobservables by performing a global data analysis, that includes the latest\nresults from oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay bounds\nfrom the KamLAND-Zen experiment, and constraints from representative\ncombinations of Planck measurements and other cosmological data sets. In\ngeneral, NO appears to be somewhat favored with respect to IO at the level of\n~2 sigma, mainly by neutrino oscillation data (especially atmospheric),\ncorroborated by cosmological data in some cases. Detailed constraints are\nobtained via the chi^2 method, by expanding the parameter space either around\nseparate minima in NO and IO, or around the absolute minimum in any ordering.\nImplications for upcoming oscillation and non-oscillation neutrino experiments,\nincluding beta-decay searches, are also discussed.\n", "  Uncovering the mechanisms that control size, growth, and division rates of\nsystems reproducing through binary division means understanding basic\nprinciples of their life cycle. Recent work has focused on how division rates\nare regulated in bacteria and yeast, but this question has not yet been\naddressed in more complex, multicellular organisms. We have acquired a unique\nlarge-scale data set on the growth and asexual reproduction of two freshwater\nplanarian species, Dugesia japonica and Dugesia tigrina, which reproduce by\ntransverse fission and succeeding regeneration of head and tail pieces into new\nplanarians. We show that generation-dependent memory effects in planarian\nreproduction need to be taken into account to accurately capture the\nexperimental data. To achieve this, we developed a new additive model that\nmixes multiple size control strategies based on planarian size, growth, and\ntime between divisions. Our model quantifies the proportions of each strategy\nin the mixed dynamics, revealing the ability of the two planarian species to\nutilize different strategies in a coordinated manner for size control.\nAdditionally, we found that head and tail offspring of both species employ\ndifferent mechanisms to monitor and trigger their reproduction cycles. Thus, we\nfind a diversity of strategies not only between species but also between heads\nand tails within species. Our additive model provides two advantages over\nexisting 2D models that fit a multivariable splitting rate function to the data\nfor size control: Firstly, it can be fit to relatively small data sets and can\nthus be applied to systems where available data is limited. Secondly, it\nenables new biological insights because it explicitly shows the contributions\nof different size control strategies for each offspring type.\n", "  We study the motion of massive particles with electric and magnetic charges\nin the background of a magnetically charged Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger\nstringy black hole. We solve analytically the equations of motion of the test\nparticles and we describe the orbital motion in terms of the Weierstrass\nelliptic functions. We find that there are critical values of the magnetic\ncharge of the black hole and the magnetic charge of the test particle which\ncharacterize the bound and unbound orbits and we study two observables, the\nperihelion shift and the Lense-Thirring effect. The trajectories depend on the\nelectric and magnetic charges of the test particle. While the angular-motion\ndepends on the electric charge of the test particle, the $r$ and $t$-motion\ndepends on the mass and the magnetic charge of the test particle.\n", "  We consider a classical and possibly driven composite system $X \\otimes Y$\nweakly coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir $R$ so that an unambiguous\nstochastic thermodynamics ensues for $X \\otimes Y$. This setup can be\nequivalently seen as a system $X$ strongly coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir\n$Y \\otimes R$. We demonstrate that only in the limit where the dynamics of $Y$\nis much faster then $X$, our unambiguous expressions for thermodynamic\nquantities such as heat, entropy or internal energy, are equivalent to the\nstrong coupling expressions recently obtained in the literature using the\nHamiltonian of mean force. By doing so, we also significantly extend these\nresults by formulating them at the level of instantaneous rates and by allowing\nfor time-dependent couplings between $X$ and its environment. Away from the\nlimit where $Y$ evolves much faster than $X$, previous approaches fail to\nreproduce the correct results from the original unambiguous formulation, as we\nillustrate numerically for an underdamped Brownian particle coupled strongly to\na non-Markovian reservoir.\n", "  We describe the unitarity approach for the numerical computation of two-loop\nintegral coefficients of scattering amplitudes. It is well known that the\nleading propagator singularities of an amplitude's integrand are related to\nproducts of tree amplitudes. At two loops, Feynman diagrams with doubled\npropagators appear naturally, which lead to subleading pole contributions. In\ngeneral, it is not known how these contributions can be directly expressed in\nterms of a product of on-shell tree amplitudes. We present a universal\nalgorithm to extract these subleading pole terms by releasing some of the\non-shell conditions. We demonstrate the new approach by numerically computing\ntwo-loop four-gluon integral coefficients.\n", "  The mass and decay width of the $\\phi$ meson in cold nuclear matter are\ncomputed in an effective Lagrangian approach. The medium dependence of these\nproperties are obtained by evaluating kaon-antikaon loop contributions to the\n$\\phi$ self-energy, employing the medium-modified kaon masses, calculated using\nthe quark-meson coupling model. The loop integral is regularized with a dipole\nform factor, and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of cutoff mass in\nthe form factor is investigated. At normal nuclear matter density we find a\ndownward shift of the $\\phi$ mass by a few percent, while the decay width is\nenhanced by an order of magnitude. For a large variation of the cutoff mass\nparameter, the results for the $\\phi$ mass and the decay width turn out to vary\nvery little. Our results support results in the literature which suggest that\none should observe a small downward mass shift and a large broadening of the\ndecay width. In order to explore the possibility of studying the binding and\nabsorption of $\\phi$ mesons in nuclei, we also present the single-particle\nbinding energies and half-widths of $\\phi$-nucleus bound states for some\nselected nuclei.\n", "  In chaotic deterministic systems, seemingly stochastic behavior is generated\nby relatively simple, though hidden, organizing rules and structures. Prominent\namong the tools used to characterize this complexity in 1D and 2D systems are\ntechniques which exploit the topology of dynamically invariant structures.\nHowever, the path to extending many such topological techniques to three\ndimensions is filled with roadblocks that prevent their application to a wider\nvariety of physical systems. Here, we overcome these roadblocks and\nsuccessfully analyze a realistic model of 3D fluid advection, by extending the\nhomotopic lobe dynamics (HLD) technique, previously developed for 2D\narea-preserving dynamics, to 3D volume-preserving dynamics. We start with\nnumerically-generated finite-time chaotic-scattering data for particles\nentrained in a spherical fluid vortex, and use this data to build a symbolic\nrepresentation of the dynamics. We then use this symbolic representation to\nexplain and predict the self-similar fractal structure of the scattering data,\nto compute bounds on the topological entropy, a fundamental measure of mixing,\nand to discover two different mixing mechanisms, which stretch 2D material\nsurfaces and 1D material curves in distinct ways.\n", "  Oxygen-deficient TiO$_2$ in the rutile structure as well as the Ti$_3$O$_5$\nMagn{\\'e}li phase is investigated within the charge self-consistent combination\nof density functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). It\nis shown that an isolated oxygen vacancy (V$_{\\rm O}$) in titanium dioxide is\nnot sufficient to metallize the system at low temperatures. In a semiconducting\nphase, an in-gap state is identified at $\\varepsilon_{\\rm IG}^{\\hfill}\\sim\n-0.75\\,$eV\\, in excellent agreement with experimental data. Band-like impurity\nlevels, resulting from a threefold V$_{\\rm O}$-Ti coordination as well as\nentangled $(t_{2g},e_g)$ states, become localized due to site-dependent\nelectronic correlations. Charge localization and strong orbital polarization\noccur in the V$_{\\rm O}$-near Ti ions, which details can be modified by a\nvariation of the correlated subspace. At higher oxygen vacancy concentration, a\ncorrelated metal is stabilized in the Magn{\\'e}li phase. A V$_{\\rm O}$-defect\nrutile structure of identical stoichiometry shows key differences in the\norbital-resolved character and the spectral properties. Charge\ndisproportionation is vital in the oxygen-deficient compounds, but obvious\nmetal-insulator transitions driven or sustained by charge order are not\nidentified.\n", "  In this work we deal with a non-canonical scalar field in the two-dimensional\nspacetime. We search for a generalized model that is twin of the standard\nmodel, supporting the same defect structure with the same energy density. We\nalso study the stability of the defect solution under small fluctuations, which\nis governed by a Sturm-Liouville equation, and show how to make it stable. The\nmodel is then modified and used in the five-dimensional spacetime to construct\na thick brane that engenders the first order framework and preserves the\ntwinlike behavior, under tensorial fluctuations of the metric in its\ngravitational sector.\n", "  We present the synthesis and a detailed investigation of structural and\nmagnetic properties of metal-organic compound Cu$_2$(IPA)$_2$(DMF)(H$_2$O) by\nmeans of x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements.\nSingle crystals of the title compound were synthesized by judicious selection\nof organic ligand and employing a selective hydrothermal reaction route. It\ncrystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with space group $Cmca$. The\nstructural analysis revealed that two Cu$^{2+}$ ions are held together by the\norganic component (-O-C-O-) in a square paddle-wheel to form spin dimers which\nare aligned perpendicular to each other and are further coupled through organic\nligands (isophthalic acid) forming two-dimensional layers. Temperature\ndependent magnetic susceptibility $\\chi(T)$ could be described well using\nspin-$1/2$ dimer model. The spin susceptibility $\\chi_{\\rm spin} (T)$ shows an\nexponential decrease in the low temperature region, below the broad maximum,\nconfirming the singlet ground state with a large spin gap of $\\Delta/k_{\\rm B}\n\\simeq 409$~K. The heat capacity $C_{\\rm p}$ measured as a function of\ntemperature also confirms the absence of magnetic long-range-order down to 2~K.\n", "  We apply a three-dimensional (3D) implementation of the time-dependent\nrestricted-active-space self-consistent-field (TD-RASSCF) method to investigate\neffects of electron correlation in the ground state of Be as well as in its\nphotoionization dynamics by short XUV pulses, including time-delay in\nphotoionization. First, we obtain the ground state by propagation in imaginary\ntime. We show that the flexibility of the TD-RASSCF on the choice of the active\norbital space makes it possible to consider only relevant active space\norbitals, facilitating the convergence to the ground state compared to the\nmulticonfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock method, used as a benchmark to\nshow the accuracy and efficiency of TD-RASSCF. Second, we solve the equations\nof motion to compute photoelectron spectra of Be after interacting with a short\nlinearly polarized XUV laser pulse. We compare the spectra for different RAS\nschemes, and in this way we identify the orbital spaces that are relevant for\nan accurate description of the photoelectron spectra. Finally, we investigate\nthe effects of electron correlation on the magnitude of the relative time-delay\nin the photoionization process into two different ionic channels. One channel,\nthe ground state channel in the ion, is accessible without electron\ncorrelation. The other channel is only accessible when including electron\ncorrelation. The time-delay is highly sensitivity to the choice of the active\nspace, and hence to the account of electron-electron correlation.\n", "  We investigate the visibility of signals characterised by wide bumps over a\nsmoothly falling background that cannot be accurately predicted by Monte Carlo\ncalculations. Examples of such are the wide bumps that triboson and quadriboson\nresonance cascade decays would yield in diboson resonance searches in fully\nhadronic final states. We find that the sensitivity to triboson bumps is rather\nsmall: signals of a moderate size could be present in current data and yet\nremain unnoticed. For quadriboson cascade decays the signals can hardly be\ndistinguished from the background in the current searches.\n", "  We investigate the static interquark potential for the three-quark system in\nSU(3) lattice gauge theory at zero temperature by using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We extract the potential from the correlation function of the\nthree Polyakov loops, which are computed by employing the multilevel algorithm.\nWe obtain remarkably clean results of the three-quark potential for O(200) sets\nof the three-quark configurations of various sizes and geometries including not\nonly the cases that three quarks are put at the vertices of acute, right, and\nobtuse triangles, but also the extreme cases such that three quarks are put in\nline. We find several new interesting features of the three-quark potential and\nthen discuss its possible functional form.\n", "  In this paper, we present a study to measure the differences between the\natmospheric neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations in the Iron-Calorimeter\ndetector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory experiment. Charged Current\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ interactions with the detector under the\ninfluence of earth matter effect have been simulated for ten years of exposure.\nThe observed $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ events spectrum are\nseparately binned into direction and energy bins, and a $\\chi^{2}$ is minimised\nwith respect to each bin to extract the oscillation parameters for $\\nu_{\\mu}$\nand $\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ separately. We then present the ICAL sensitivity to\nconfirm a non-zero value of the difference in atmospheric mass squared of\nneutrino and anti-neutrino i.e. $|\\Delta\nm^{2}_{32}|-|\\Delta\\overline{m^{2}}_{32}|$.\n", "  The robust detection of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar and stellar\nflares has been the topic of recent debate. In light of this, we have adapted a\nmethod described by Vaughan (2005) to aid with the search for QPPs in flare\ntime series data. The method identifies statistically significant periodic\nsignals in power spectra, and properly accounts for red noise as well as the\nuncertainties associated with the data. We show how the method can be further\ndeveloped to be used with rebinned power spectra, allowing us to detect QPPs\nwhose signal is spread over more than one frequency bin. An advantage of these\nmethods is that there is no need to detrend the data prior to creating the\npower spectrum. Examples are given where the methods have been applied to\nsynthetic data, as well as real flare time series data with candidate QPPs from\nthe Nobeyama Radioheliograph. These show that, despite the transient nature of\nQPPs, peaks corresponding to the QPPs can be seen at a significant level in the\npower spectrum without any form of detrending or other processing of the\noriginal time series data, providing the background trends are not too steep.\n", "  In metallic samples of small enough size and sufficiently strong\nmomentum-conserving scattering, the viscosity of the electron gas can become\nthe dominant process governing transport. In this regime, momentum is a\nlong-lived quantity whose evolution is described by an emergent hydrodynamical\ntheory. Furthermore, breaking time-reversal symmetry leads to the appearance of\nan odd component to the viscosity called the Hall viscosity, which has\nattracted considerable attention recently due to its quantized nature in gapped\nsystems but still eludes experimental confirmation. Based on microscopic\ncalculations, we discuss how to measure the effects of both the even and odd\ncomponents of the viscosity using hydrodynamic electronic transport in\nmesoscopic samples under applied magnetic fields.\n", "  We study the internal structure of the pion using a model inspired by the\nAdS/QCD correspondence. The holographic approach provides the light-front wave\nfunction (LFWF) for the leading Fock state component of the pion. We adopt two\ndifferent forms for the LFWF derived from the AdS/QCD soft-wall model, with\nfree parameters fitted to the available experimental information on the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor and the leading-twist parton distribution function.\nThe intrinsic scale of the model is taken as an additional fit parameter.\nWithin this framework, we provide predictions for the unpolarized transverse\nmomentum dependent parton distribution (TMD), and discuss its property both at\nthe scale of the model and after TMD evolution to higher scales that are\nrelevant for upcoming experimental measurements.\n", "  The detection of gravity plays a fundamental role during the growth and\nevolution of plants. Although progress has been made in our understanding of\nthe molecular, cellular and physical mechanisms involved in the gravity\ndetection, a coherent scenario consistent with all the observations is still\nlacking. In this perspective paper we discuss recent experiments showing that\nthe response to inclination of shoots is independent of the gravity intensity,\nmeaning that the gravity sensor detects an inclination and not a force. This\nresult questions some of the commonly accepted hypotheses and leads to propose\na new \"position sensor hypothesis\". The implications of this new scenario are\ndiscussed in the light of different observations available in the literature.\n", "  Thermal conductance of a homogeneous 1D nonlinear lattice system with\nneareast neighbor interactions has recently been computationally studied in\ndetail by Li et al [Eur. Phys. J. B {\\bf 88}, 182 (2015)], where its power-law\ndependence on temperature $T$ for high temperatures is shown. Here, we address\nits entire temperature dependence, in addition to its dependence on the size\n$N$ of the system. We obtain a neat data collapse for arbitrary temperatures\nand system sizes, and numerically show that the thermal conductance curve is\nquite satisfactorily described by a fat-tailed $q$-Gaussian dependence on\n$TN^{1/3}$ with $q \\simeq 1.55$. Consequently, its $T \\to\\infty$ asymptotic\nbehavior is given by $T^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=2/(q-1) \\simeq 3.64$.\n", "  We demonstrated the first-order interference between coherent light at 1580\nnm and 795 nm by using frequency-domain Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The\nMZI is implemented by two frequency-domain BSs based on a second-order\nnonlinear optical effect in a periodically-poled lithium niobate waveguide with\na strong pump light. We achieved the visibility of over 0.99 at 50% conversion\nefficiencies of the BSs. Toward photonic quantum information processing,\nsufficiently small background photon rate is necessary. From the measurement\nresults with a superconducting single photon detector, we discuss the\nfeasibility of the frequency-domain MZI in a quantum regime. Our estimation\nshows that single photon interference with the visibility above 0.9 is feasible\nwith practical settings.\n", "  We study a left right (LR) extension of the Standard Model (SM) where the\nDark Matter (DM) candidate is composed of a set of fermionic Majorana triplets.\nThe DM is stabilized by a remnant $Z_{2}$ symmetry from the breaking of the LR\ngroup to the SM. Two simple scenarios where the DM particles plus a certain set\nof extra fields lead to gauge coupling unification with a low LR scale are\nexplored. The constraints from relic density and predictions for direct\ndetection are discussed for both scenarios. The first scenario with a $SU(2)_R$\nvectorlike fermion triplet contains a DM candidate which is almost\nunconstrained by current direct detection experiments. The second scenario,\nwith an additional $SU(2)_R$ triplet, opens up a scalar portal leading to\ndirect detection constraints which are similar to collider limits for right\ngauge bosons. The DM parameter space consistent with phenomenological\nrequirements can also lead to successful gauge coupling unification in a\n$SO(10)$ setup.\n", "  Anderson localization is related to exponential localization of a particle in\nthe configuration space in the presence of a disorder potential. Anderson\nlocalization can be also observed in the momentum space and corresponds to\nquantum suppression of classical diffusion in systems that are classically\nchaotic. Another kind of Anderson localization has been recently proposed, i.e.\nlocalization in the time domain due to the presence of {\\it disorder} in time.\nThat is, the probability density for the detection of a system at a fixed\nposition in the configuration space is localized exponentially around a certain\nmoment of time if a system is driven by a force that fluctuates in time. We\nshow that an electron in a Rydberg atom, perturbed by a fluctuating microwave\nfield, Anderson localizes along a classical periodic orbit. In other words the\nprobability density for the detection of an electron at a fixed position on an\norbit is exponentially localized around a certain time moment. This phenomenon\ncan be experimentally observed.\n", "  The low-temperature magnetic phases in the layered honeycomb lattice material\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been studied as a function of in-plane magnetic field.\nIn zero field this material orders magnetically below 7 K with so-called zigzag\norder within the honeycomb planes. Neutron diffraction data show that a\nrelatively small applied field of 2 T is sufficient to suppress the population\nof the magnetic domain in which the zigzag chains run along the field\ndirection. We found that the intensity of the magnetic peaks due to zigzag\norder is continuously suppressed with increasing field until their\ndisappearance at $\\mu_o$H$_c$=8 T. At still higher fields (above 8 T) the\nzigzag order is destroyed, while bulk magnetization and heat capacity\nmeasurements suggest that the material enters a state with gapped magnetic\nexcitations. We discuss the magnetic phase diagram obtained in our study in the\ncontext of a quantum phase transition.\n", "  A single wave component of a quantum particle can in principle be detected by\nthe way that it interferes with itself, that is, through the local wave\nfunction correlation. The interpretation as the expectation of a local\ntranslation operator allows this measure of quantum wavyness to be followed\nthrough the process of decoherence in open quantum systems. This is here\nassumed to be Markovian, determined by Lindblad operators that are linear in\nposition and momentum. The limitation of small averaging windows and even\nsmaller correlation lengths simplifies the semiclassical theory for the\nevolving local correlation. Its spectrum has a peak for each classical\nmomentum, subjected to Gaussian broadening with decoherence. These spectral\nlines can be clearly resolved even after the Wigner function has become\npositive: The correlations located far from caustics seem to be the last\nvestige of quantum oscilations.\n", "  The remarkable properties of the geodesic light-cone (GLC) coordinates allow\nanalytic expressions for the light-cone observables, providing a new\nnon-perturbative way for calculating the effects of inhomogeneities in our\nUniverse. However, the gauge-invariance of these expressions in the GLC\nformalism has not been shown explicitly. Here we provide this missing part of\nthe GLC formalism by proving the gauge-invariance of the GLC expressions for\nthe light-cone observables, such as the observed redshift, the luminosity\ndistance, and the physical area and volume of the observed sources. Our study\nprovides a new insight on the properties of the GLC coordinates and it\ncomplements the previous work by the GLC collaboration, leading to a\ncomprehensive description of light propagation in the GLC representation.\n", "  Electron evaporation plays an important role in the electron temperature\nevolution and thus expansion rate in low-density ultracold plasmas. In\naddition, evaporation is useful as a potential tool for obtaining colder\nelectron temperatures and characterizing plasma parameters. Evaporation theory\nhas been developed for atomic gases and has been applied to a one-component\nplasma system. We numerically investigate whether such an adapted theory is\napplicable to ultracold neutral plasmas. We find that it is not due to the\nviolation of fundamental assumptions of the model. The details of our\ncalculations are presented as well as a discussion of the implications for a\nsimple description of the electron evaporation rate in ultracold plasmas.\n", "  We present a solution to the decompactification problem of gauge thresholds\nin chiral heterotic string theories with two large extra dimensions, where\nsupersymmetry is spontaneously broken by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. Whenever\nthe Kaluza-Klein scale is much lower than the string scale, the infinite towers\nof heavy states contribute non-trivially to the renormalisation of gauge\ncouplings, which typically grow linearly with the large volume of the internal\nspace and invalidate perturbation theory. We trace the origin of the\ndecompactification problem to properties of the six dimensional theory obtained\nin the infinite volume limit and show that thresholds may instead exhibit\nlogarithmic volume dependence and we provide the conditions for this to occur.\nWe illustrate this mechanism with explicit string constructions where the\ndecompactification problem does not occur.\n", "  Detonation propagation in a compressible medium wherein the energy release\nhas been made spatially inhomogeneous is examined via numerical simulation. The\ninhomogeneity is introduced via step functions in the reaction progress\nvariable, with the local value of energy release correspondingly increased so\nas to maintain the same average energy density in the medium, and thus a\nconstant Chapman Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. A one-step Arrhenius rate\ngoverns the rate of energy release in the reactive zones. The resulting\ndynamics of a detonation propagating in such systems with one-dimensional\nlayers and two-dimensional squares are simulated using a Godunov-type\nfinite-volume scheme. The resulting wave dynamics are analyzed by computing the\naverage wave velocity and one-dimensional averaged wave structure. In the case\nof sufficiently inhomogeneous media wherein the spacing between reactive zones\nis greater than the inherent reaction zone length, average wave speeds\nsignificantly greater than the corresponding CJ speed of the homogenized medium\nare obtained. If the shock transit time between reactive zones is less than the\nreaction time scale, then the classical CJ detonation velocity is recovered.\nThe spatio-temporal averaged structure of the waves in these systems is\nanalyzed via a Favre averaging technique, with terms associated with the\nthermal and mechanical fluctuations being explicitly computed. The analysis of\nthe averaged wave structure identifies the super-CJ detonations as weak\ndetonations owing to the existence of mechanical non-equilibrium at the\neffective sonic point embedded within the wave structure. The correspondence of\nthe super-CJ behavior identified in this study with real detonation phenomena\nthat may be observed in experiments is discussed.\n", "  We propose a simple method of combined synchronous modulations to generate\nthe analytically exact solutions for a parity-time symmetric two-level system.\nSuch exact solutions are expressible in terms of simple elementary functions\nand helpful for illuminating some generalizations of appealing concepts\noriginating in the Hermitian system. Some intriguing physical phenomena, such\nas stabilization of a non-Hermitian system by periodic driving, non-Hermitian\nanalogs of coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) and complete population\ninversion (CPI), are demonstrated analytically and confirmed numerically. In\naddition, by using these exact solutions we derive a pulse area theorem for\nsuch non-Hermitian CPI in the parity-time symmetric two-level system. Our\nresults may provide an additional possibility for pulse manipulation and\ncoherent control of the parity-time symmetric two-level system.\n", "  Using the coalescence model based on nucleons from a blast-wave model with\nits parameters fitted to the measured proton transverse momentum spectrum and\nelliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider,\nwe study the elliptic flows of light nuclei in these collisions. We find that\nto describe the measured elliptic flows of deuterons (anti-deuterons) and\ntritons (helium-3) requires that the emission source for nucleons of high\ntransverse momentum is more elongated along the reaction plane than in the\nperpendicular direction. Our results thus suggest that the elliptic flows of\nlight nuclei can be used to study the nucleon emission source in relativistic\nheavy ion collisions.\n", "  Exploring a variety of closing schemes to the infinite hierarchy of momentum\nmoments of the exactly solvable Boltzmann equation for systems undergoing\nGubser flow, we study the precision with which the resulting hydrodynamic\nequations reproduce the exact evolution of hydrodynamic moments of the\ndistribution function. We find that anisotropic hydrodynamics, obtained by ex-\npanding the distribution function around a dynamically evolving locally\nanisotropic background whose evolution is matched to exactly reproduce the\nmacroscopic pressure anisotropy caused by the different longitudinal and\ntransverse expansion rates in Gubser flow, provides the most accurate\nmacroscopic description of the microscopic kinetic evolution. This confirms a\nsimilar earlier finding for Bjorken flow [Moln\\'ar, Niemi and Rischke, Phys.\nRev. D 94, 125003 (2016)]. We explain the physics behind this optimal matching\nprocedure and show that one can efficiently correct for a non- optimized\nmatching choice by adding a residual shear stress to the energy-momentum tensor\nwhose evolution is again determined by the Boltzmann equation. Additional\ninsights to guide the optimal choice of a macroscopic anisotropic hydrodynamic\nframework for strongly-coupled systems that do not admit a microscopic kinetic\ndescription are reported.\n", "  We express the resonant energies of the delta-shell potential in terms of the\nLambert $W$ function, and we calculate their decay widths and decay constants.\nThe ensuing numerical results strengthen the interpretation of such decay\nwidths and constants as a way to quantify the coupling between a resonance and\nthe continuum. We calculate explicitly the decay energy spectrum of the\nresonances of the delta-shell potential, and we show numerically that the\nlineshape of such spectrum is not the same as, and can be very different from,\nthe Breit-Wigner (Lorentzian) distribution. We argue that the standard Golden\nRule cannot describe the interference of two resonances, and we show how to\ndescribe such interference by way of the decay energy spectrum of two resonant\nstates.\n", "  We propose a new method to solve the eigen-value problem with a two-center\nsingle-particle potential. This method combines the usual matrix\ndiagonalization with the method of separable representation of a two-center\npotential, that is, an expansion of the two-center potential with a finite\nbasis set. To this end, we expand the potential on a harmonic oscillator basis,\nwhile single-particle wave functions on a combined basis with a harmonic\noscillator and eigen-functions of a one-dimensional two-center potential. In\norder to demonstrate its efficiency, we apply this method to a system with two\n$^{16}$O nuclei, in which the potential is given as a sum of two Woods-Saxon\npotentials.\n", "  Quantum metrology aims to exploit quantum phenomena to overcome classical\nlimitations in the estimation of relevant parameters. We consider a probe\nundergoing a phase shift $\\varphi$ whose generator is randomly sampled\naccording to a distribution with unknown concentration $\\kappa$, which\nintroduces a physical source of noise. We then investigate strategies for the\njoint estimation of the two parameters $\\varphi$ and $\\kappa$ given a finite\nnumber $N$ of interactions with the phase imprinting channel. We consider both\nsingle qubit and multipartite entangled probes, and identify regions of the\nparameters where simultaneous estimation is advantageous, resulting in up to a\ntwofold reduction in resources. Quantum enhanced precision is achievable at\nmoderate $N$, while for sufficiently large $N$ classical strategies take over\nand the precision follows the standard quantum limit. We show that full-scale\nentanglement is not needed to reach such an enhancement, as efficient\nstrategies using significantly fewer qubits in a scheme interpolating between\nthe conventional sequential and parallel metrological schemes yield the same\neffective performance. These results may have relevant applications in\noptimization of sensing technologies.\n", "  We consider a massive black hole in four dimensional AdS space and study the\neffect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of the black hole. We\nconsider thermal fluctuations as logarithmic correction terms in the entropy.\nWe analyse the effect of logarithmic correction on thermodynamics potentials\nlike Helmholtz and Gibbs which are found decreasing functions. We study\ncritical points and stability and find that presence of logarithmic correction\nis necessary to have stable phase and critical point.\n", "  We present an automatic measurement platform that enables the\ncharacterization of nanodevices by electrical transport and optical\nspectroscopy as a function of uniaxial stress. We provide insights into and\ndetailed descriptions of the mechanical device, the substrate design and\nfabrication, and the instrument control software, which is provided under\nopen-source license. The capability of the platform is demonstrated by\ncharacterizing the piezo-resistance of an InAs nanowire device using a\ncombination of electrical transport and Raman spectroscopy. The advantages of\nthis measurement platform are highlighted by comparison with state-of-the-art\npiezo-resistance measurements in InAs nanowires. We envision that the\nsystematic application of this methodology will provide new insights into the\nphysics of nanoscale devices and novel materials for electronics, and thus\ncontribute to the assessment of the potential of strain as a technology booster\nfor nanoscale electronics.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the phase structure of a (1+1)-dimensional quark\nmodel with four-quark interaction and in the presence of baryon ($\\mu_B$),\nisospin ($\\mu_I$) and chiral isospin ($\\mu_{I5}$) chemical potentials.\nSpatially inhomogeneous chiral density wave (for chiral condensate) and single\nwave (for charged pion condensate) approaches are used. It is established that\nin the large-$N_c$ limit ($N_c$ is the number of colored quarks) there exists a\nduality correspondence between the chiral symmetry breaking phase and the\ncharged pion condensation (PC) one. Moreover, it is shown that inhomogeneous\ncharged PC phase with nonzero baryon density is induced in the model by\narbitrary small values of the chemical potential $\\mu_{I5}$ (for a rather large\nregion of $\\mu_B$ and $\\mu_I$).\n", "  We investigate the quantum phases of ultracold atoms trapped in a vortex\nlattice using a mixture of two bosonic species (A and B), in the presence of an\nartificial gauge field. Heavy atoms of species B are confined in the array of\nvortices generated in species A, and they are described through a Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. In contrast to the optical-lattice setups, the vortex lattice has an\nintrinsic dynamics, given by its Tkachenko modes. Including these quantum\nfluctuations in the effective model for B atoms yields an extended Bose-Hubbard\nmodel, with an additional \"phonon\"-mediated long-range attraction. The\nground-state phase diagram of this model is computed through a variational\nansatz and the quantum Monte Carlo technique. When compared with the ordinary\nBose-Hubbard case, the long-range interatomic attraction causes a shift and\nresizing of the Mott-insulator regions. Finally, we discuss the experimental\nfeasibility of the proposed scheme, which relies on the proper choice of the\natomic species and on a large control of physical parameters, like the\nscattering lengths and the vorticity.\n", "  We study magnetic Taylor-Couette flow in a system having nondimensional radii\n$r_i=1$ and $r_o=2$, and periodic in the axial direction with wavelengths\n$h\\ge100$. The rotation ratio of the inner and outer cylinders is adjusted to\nbe slightly in the Rayleigh-stable regime, where magnetic fields are required\nto destabilize the flow, in this case triggering the axisymmetric helical\nmagnetorotational instability (HMRI). Two choices of imposed magnetic field are\nconsidered, both having the same azimuthal component $B_\\phi=r^{-1}$, but\ndiffering axial components. The first choice has $B_z=0.1$, and yields the\nfamiliar HMRI, consisting of unidirectionally traveling waves. The second\nchoice has $B_z\\approx0.1\\sin(2\\pi z/h)$, and yields HMRI waves that travel in\nopposite directions depending on the sign of $B_z$. The first configuration\ncorresponds to a convective instability, the second to an absolute instability.\nThe two variants behave very similarly regarding both linear onset as well as\nnonlinear equilibration.\n", "  The angle-resolved inner-shell photoionization of R-trifluoromethyloxirane,\nC3H3F3O, is studied experimentally and theoretically. Thereby, we investigate\nthe photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) for nearly-symmetric O 1s and F 1s\nelectronic orbitals, which are localized on different molecular sites. The\nrespective dichroic $\\beta_{1}$ and angular distribution $\\beta_{2}$ parameters\nare measured at the photoelectron kinetic energies from 1 to 16 eV by using\nvariably polarized synchrotron radiation and velocity map imaging spectroscopy.\nThe present experimental results are in good agreement with the outcome of ab\ninitio electronic structure calculations. We report a sizable chiral asymmetry\n$\\beta_{1}$ of up to about 9% for the K-shell photoionization of oxygen atom.\nFor the individual fluorine atoms, the present calculations predict asymmetries\nof similar size. However, being averaged over all fluorine atoms, it drops down\nto about 2%, as also observed in the present experiment. Our study demonstrates\na strong emitter- and site-sensitivity of PECD in the one-photon inner-shell\nionization of this chiral molecule.\n", "  Current LHC results indicate a possible enhancement in the production of\nHiggs bosons in association with top quarks (tth) over the Standard Model (SM)\nexpectations, suggesting an increase in the top Yukawa coupling. To explain\nthese results, we study the effect of adding to the SM a small set of\nvector-like partners of the top and bottom quarks with masses of order ~1 TeV.\nWe consider Yukawa coupling matrices with vanishing determinant and show that\nthen, Higgs production through gluon fusion is not affected by deviations in\nthe top quark Yukawa coupling, and in fact depends only on deviations in the\nbottom quark Yukawa coupling. We call this scenario the \"Brane Higgs Limit\", as\nit can emerge naturally in models of warped extra-dimensions with all matter\nfields in the bulk, except the Higgs (although it could also occur in 4D\nscenarios with vector-like quarks and special flavor symmetries forcing the\nvanishing of the Yukawa determinants). We show that the scenario is highly\npredictive for all Higgs production/decay modes, making it easily falsifiable,\nmaybe even at the LHC RUN 2 with higher luminosity.\n", "  Calculations of the correlations between the Rabi frequency on the\n$H^3\\Delta_1$ to $C^1\\Pi$ transition in ThO molecule and experimental setup\nparameters in the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) search experiment is\nperformed. Calculations are required for estimations of systematic errors in\nthe experiment due to imperfections in laser beams used to prepare the molecule\nand read out the eEDM signal.\n", "  We have measured the K-shell and total internal conversion coefficients\n(ICCs), alpha_K and alpha_T, for the 109.3-keV M4 transition in 125Te to be\n185.0(40) and 350.0(38), respectively. Previously this transition's ICCs were\nconsidered anomalous, with alpha values lying below calculated values. When\ncompared with Dirac-Fock calculations, our new results show good agreement. The\nalpha_K result agrees well with the version of the theory that takes account of\nthe K-shell atomic vacancy and disagrees with the one that does not. This is\nconsistent with our conclusion drawn from a series of high multipolarity\ntransitions.\n", "  The processes $e^+e^-\\to K^0_{\\scriptscriptstyle S}K^\\pm\\pi^{\\mp}\\pi^0$ and\n$e^+e^-\\to K^0_{\\scriptscriptstyle S}K^\\pm\\pi^{\\mp}\\eta$ are studied over a\ncontinuum of energies from threshold to 4 GeV with the initial-state photon\nradiation method. Using 454 fb$^{-1}$ data collected with the BABAR detector at\nthe SLAC PEP-II storage ring, the first measurements of the cross sections for\nthese processes are obtained. The intermediate resonance structures from\n$K^{*0}(K\\pi)^0$, $K^{*}(892)^\\pm(K\\pi)^\\mp$ and $K^0_{\\scriptscriptstyle\nS}K^\\pm\\rho^{\\mp}$ are studied. The $J/\\psi$ is observed in all of these\nchannels, and corresponding branching fractions are measured.\n", "  The relativistic mean-field theory with Green's function method is extended\nto study $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei. Taking hypernucleus $^{61}_{\\Lambda}$Ca as an\nexample, the single-particle resonant states for $\\Lambda$ hyperons are\ninvestigated by analyzing density of states and the corresponding energies and\nwidths are given. Different behaviors are observed for the resonant states,\ni.e., the distributions of the very narrow $1f_{5/2}$ and $1f_{7/2}$ states are\nvery similar as bound states while that of the wide $1g_{7/2}$ and $1g_{9/2}$\nstates are like scattering states. Besides, the impurity effect of $\\Lambda$\nhyperons on the single-neutron resonant states are investigated. For most of\nthe resonant states, both the energies and widths decrease with adding more\n$\\Lambda$ hyperons due to the attractive $\\Lambda N$ interaction. Finally, the\nenergy level structure of $\\Lambda$ hyperons in the Ca hypernucleus isotopes\nwith mass number $A=53-73$ are studied, obvious shell structure and small\nspin-orbit splitting are found for the single-$\\Lambda$ spectrum.\n", "  This letter presents the results of an advanced parametrization of the solar\nwind electron temperature anisotropy and the instabilities resulting from the\ninterplay of the (bi-)Maxwellian core and (bi-)Kappa halo populations in the\nslow solar wind. A large set of observational data (from the Ulysses, Helios\nand Cluster missions) is used to parametrize these components and establish\ntheir correlations. The instabilities are significantly stimulated in the\npresence of suprathermals, and the instability thresholds shape the limits of\nthe temperature anisotropy for both the core and halo populations re-stating\nthe incontestable role that the selfgenerated instabilities can play in\nconstraining the electron anisotropy. These results confirm a particular\nimplication of the suprathermal electrons which are less dense but hotter than\nthermal electrons.\n", "  The cosmological particle horizon is the maximum measurable length in the\nUniverse. The existence of such a maximum observable length scale implies a\nmodification of the quantum uncertainty principle. Thus due to non-locality of\nquantum mechanics, the global properties of the Universe could produce a\nsignature on the behaviour of local quantum systems. A Generalized Uncertainty\nPrinciple (GUP) that is consistent with the existence of such a maximum\nobservable length scale $l_{max}$ is $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\;\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha \\Delta x^2}$ where $\\alpha =\nl_{max}^{-2}\\simeq (H_0/c)^2$ ($H_0$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the\nspeed of light). In addition to the existence of a maximum measurable length\n$l_{max}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt \\alpha}$, this form of GUP implies also the existence\nof a minimum measurable momentum $p_{min}=\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\hbar\n\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Using appropriate representation of the position and momentum\nquantum operators we show that the spectrum of the one dimensional harmonic\noscillator becomes $\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_n=2n+1+\\lambda_n \\bar{\\alpha}$ where\n$\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_n\\equiv 2E_n/\\hbar \\omega$ is the dimensionless properly\nnormalized $n^{th}$ energy level, $\\bar{\\alpha}$ is a dimensionless parameter\nwith $\\bar{\\alpha}\\equiv \\alpha \\hbar/m \\omega$ and $\\lambda_n\\sim n^2$ for\n$n\\gg 1$ (we show the full form of $\\lambda_n$ in the text). For a typical\nvibrating diatomic molecule and $l_{max}=c/H_0$ we find $\\bar{\\alpha}\\sim\n10^{-77}$ and therefore for such a system, this effect is beyond reach of\ncurrent experiments. However, this effect could be more important in the early\nuniverse and could produce signatures in the primordial perturbation spectrum\ninduced by quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field.\n", "  We present the results of neutron scattering experiments to study the crystal\nand magnetic structures of the Mott-insulating transition metal oxyselenides\nPr2O2M2OSe2 (M = Mn, Fe). The structural role of the non-Kramers Pr3+ ion is\ninvestigated and analysis of Pr3+ crystal field excitations performed.\nLong-range order of Pr3+ moments in Pr2O2Fe2OSe2 can be induced by an applied\nmagnetic field.\n", "  In this article, we show that making global fits of string theory model\nparameters to data is an interesting mechanism for probing, mapping and\nforecasting connections of the theory to real world physics. We considered a\nlarge volume scenario (LVS) with D3-branes matter fields and supersymmetry\nbreaking. A global fit of the parameters to low energy data shows that the set\nof LVS models are associated with light gluinos which are quasi-degenerate with\nthe neutralinos and charginos they can promptly decay into and thus possibly\nhidden to current LHC gluino search strategies.\n", "  The inner surface of superconducting cavities plays a crucial role to achieve\nhighest accelerating fields and low losses. For an investigation of this inner\nsurface of more than 100 cavities within the cavity fabrication for the\nEuropean XFEL and the ILC HiGrade Research Project, an optical inspection robot\nOBACHT was constructed. To analyze up to 2325 images per cavity, an image\nprocessing and analysis code was developed and new variables to describe the\ncavity surface were obtained. The accuracy of this code is up to 97% and the\nPPV 99% within the resolution of 15.63 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$. The optical obtained\nsurface roughness is in agreement with standard profilometric methods. The\nimage analysis algorithm identified and quantified vendor specific fabrication\nproperties as the electron beam welding speed and the different surface\nroughness due to the different chemical treatments. In addition, a correlation\nof $\\rho = -0.93$ with a significance of $6\\,\\sigma$ between an obtained\nsurface variable and the maximal accelerating field was found.\n", "  This work aims to understand the behavior of non-linear waves in the vicinity\nof a coronal null point. In previous works we have showed that high frequency\nwaves are generated in such magnetic configuration. This paper studies those\nwaves in detail in order to provide a plausible explanation of their\ngeneration. We demonstrate that slow magneto-acoustic shock waves generated in\nthe chromosphere propagate through the null point and produce a train of\nsecondary shocks that escape along the field lines. A particular combination of\nthe shock wave speeds generates waves at a frequency of 80 mHz. We speculate\nthat this frequency may be sensitive to the atmospheric parameters in the\ncorona and therefore can be used to probe the structure of this solar layer.\n", "  Polarization selectivity of light-field-induced charge localization was\ninvestigated in an organic metal alpha-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 with a triangular lattice.\nDependences of transient reflectivity spectra on polarizations of the 7-fs pump\nand probe lights indicate that a short-range charge order (CO) is efficiently\ninduced from the metallic phase for the pump polarization perpendicular to the\n1010-type CO axis. Numerical solution of a time-dependent Schrodinger equation\nclarified that the 1010-CO is induced by field-induced re-distribution of\ncharges cooperating with competing inter-site Coulomb repulsions in the\ntriangular lattice.\n", "  We theoretically study the electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport\nproperties of graphene nanoribbons under torsional deformations. The modelling\nfollows a nonequilibrium Green's function approach in the ballistic transport\nregime, describing the electrical and phononic properties through\n\\textit{ab-initio} density functional theory and empirical interatomic\npotentials, respectively. We consider two different types of deformations, a\ncontinuous twist of a given angle applied to the nanoribbon, and two\nconsecutive twists applied in opposite angular directions. The numerical\nresults are carefully analysed in terms of spatially-resolved electron\neigenchannels, polarization-dependent phonon transmission and thermoelectric\nfigure-of-merit.\n", "  We investigate the time and the energy minimum optimal solutions for the\nrobust control of two-level quantum systems against offset or control field\nuncertainties. Using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we derive the global\noptimal pulses for the first robustness orders. We show that the dimension of\nthe control landscape is lower or equal to 2N for a field robust to the N th\norder, which leads to an estimate of its complexity.\n", "  We show that the existing theory does not give correct in-plane spectrum of\nsuperlattices at small in-plane momentum. Magneto-absorption experiments\ndemonstrate that the energy range of the parabolic region of the spectrum near\nthe electron subband bottom is by the order of magnitude lower than the value\npredicted by the traditional approach. We developed a modified theory according\nto which the energy range of the parabolic region and carrier in-plane\neffective masses are determined by the effective bandgap of the superlattice\nrather than by the bulk bandgaps of the superlattice layers. The results of the\nnew theory are consistent with the experiment.\n", "  The low-lying energy levels of proton-rich $^{56}$Cu have been extracted\nusing in-beam $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with the state-of-the-art $\\gamma$-ray\ntracking array GRETINA in conjunction with the S800 spectrograph at the\nNational Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University.\nExcited states in $^{56}$Cu serve as resonances in the\n$^{55}$Ni(p,$\\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu reaction, which is a part of the rp-process in\ntype I x-ray bursts. To resolve existing ambiguities in the reaction Q-value, a\nmore localized IMME mass fit is used resulting in $Q=639\\pm82$~keV. We derive\nthe first experimentally-constrained thermonuclear reaction rate for\n$^{55}$Ni(p,$\\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu. We find that, with this new rate, the\nrp-process may bypass the $^{56}$Ni waiting point via the $^{55}$Ni(p,$\\gamma$)\nreaction for typical x-ray burst conditions with a branching of up to\n$\\sim$40$\\%$. We also identify additional nuclear physics uncertainties that\nneed to be addressed before drawing final conclusions about the rp-process\nreaction flow in the $^{56}$Ni region.\n", "  Resonant x-ray scattering at the Dy $M_5$ and Ni $L_3$ absorption edges was\nused to probe the temperature and magnetic field dependence of magnetic order\nin epitaxial LaNiO$_3$-DyScO$_3$ superlattices. For superlattices with 2 unit\ncell thick LaNiO$_3$ layers, a commensurate spiral state develops in the Ni\nspin system below 100 K. Upon cooling below $T_{ind} = 18$ K, Dy-Ni exchange\ninteractions across the LaNiO$_3$-DyScO$_3$ interfaces induce collinear\nmagnetic order of interfacial Dy moments as well as a reorientation of the Ni\nspins to a direction dictated by the strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy of\nDy. This transition is reversible by an external magnetic field of 3 T.\nTailored exchange interactions between rare-earth and transition-metal ions\nthus open up new perspectives for the manipulation of spin structures in\nmetal-oxide heterostructures and devices.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the phase diagram of copper intercalated\nTiSe$_2$ single crystals, combining local Hall-probe magnetometry, tunnel diode\noscillator technique (TDO), specific-heat, and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy measurements. A series of the Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$ samples from three\ndifferent sources with various copper content $x$ and superconducting critical\ntemperatures $T_c$ have been investigated. We first show that the vortex\npenetration mechanism is dominated by geometrical barriers enabling a precise\ndetermination of the lower critical field, $H_{c1}$. We then show that the\ntemperature dependence of the superfluid density deduced from magnetic\nmeasurements (both $H_{c1}$ and TDO techniques) clearly suggests the existence\nof a small energy gap in the system, with a coupling strength $2\\Delta_s \\sim\n[2.4-2.8]k_BT_c$, regardless of the copper content, in puzzling contradiction\nwith specific heat measurements which can be well described by one single large\ngap $2\\Delta_l \\sim [3.7-3.9]k_BT_c$. Finally, our measurements reveal a\nnon-trivial doping dependence of the condensation energy, which remains to be\nunderstood.\n", "  Inspired by the low--density Lee-Yang expansion for the energy of a dilute\nFermi gas of density $\\rho$ and momentum $k_F$, we introduce here a\nSkyrme--type functional that contains only $s$-wave terms and provides, at the\nmean--field level, (i) a satisfactory equation of state for neutron matter from\nextremely low densities up to densities close to the equilibrium point, and\n(ii) a good--quality equation of state for symmetric matter at density scales\naround the saturation point. This is achieved by using a density--dependent\nneutron-neutron scattering length $a(\\rho$) which satisfies the low--density\nlimit (for Fermi momenta going to zero) and has a density dependence tuned in\nsuch a way that the low--density constraint $|a(\\rho) k_F| \\le 1$ is satisfied\nat all density scales.\n", "  We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the integrable spin-1\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations with a 4x4 Lax pair on the half-line. The\nsolution of this system can be obtained in terms of the solution of a 4x4\nmatrix Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem formulated in the complex k-plane. The\nrelevant jump matrices of the RH problem can be explicitly found using the two\nspectral functions s(k) and S(k), which can be defined by the initial data, the\nDirichlet-Neumann boundary data at x=0. The global relation is established\nbetween the two dependent spectral functions. The general mappings between\nDirichlet and Neumann boundary values are analyzed in terms of the global\nrelation.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the surface plasmon resonance in small metal\nspheres is calculated using an electron gas model within the Random Phase\nApproximation. The calculation is mainly devoted to the study of spheres with\ndiameters up to at least 10 nm, where quantum effects can still be relevant and\nsimple plasmon pole approximation for the dielectric function is no more\nappropriate. We find a possible blue shift of the plasmon resonance position\nwhen the temperature is increased while keeping the size of the sphere fixed.\nThe blue shift is appreciable only when the temperature is a large fraction of\nthe Fermi energy. These results provide a guide for pump and probe experiments\nwith a high time resolution, and tailored to study the excited electron system\nbefore thermalisation with the lattice takes place.\n", "  The theoretical description of non-renewal stochastic systems is a challenge.\nAnalytical results are often not available or can only be obtained under strong\nconditions, limiting their applicability. Also, numerical results have mostly\nbeen obtained by ad-hoc Monte--Carlo simulations, which are usually\ncomputationally expensive when a high degree of accuracy is needed. To gain\nquantitative insight into these systems under general conditions, we here\nintroduce a numerical iterated first-passage time approach based on solving the\ntime-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) to describe the statistics of\nnon-renewal stochastic systems. We illustrate the approach using\nspike-triggered neuronal adaptation in the leaky and perfect integrate-and-fire\nmodel, respectively. The transition to stationarity of first-passage time\nmoments and their sequential correlations occur on a non-trivial timescale that\ndepends on all system parameters. Surprisingly this is so for both single\nexponential and scale-free power-law adaptation. The method works beyond the\nsmall noise and timescale separation approximations. It shows excellent\nagreement with direct Monte Carlo simulations, which allows for the computation\nof transient and stationary distributions. We compare different methods to\ncompute the evolution of the moments and serial correlation coefficients (SCC),\nand discuss the challenge of reliably computing the SCC which we find to be\nvery sensitive to numerical inaccuracies for both the leaky and perfect\nintegrate-and-fire models. In conclusion, our methods provide a general picture\nof non-renewal dynamics in a wide range of stochastic systems exhibiting short\nand long-range correlations.\n", "  We explain how to find the asymptotic form of fixed point solutions in\nfunctional truncations, in particular $f(R)$ approximations. We find that\nquantum fluctuations do not decouple at large $R$, typically leading to\nelaborate asymptotic solutions containing several free parameters. By a\ncounting argument, these can be used to map out the dimension of the fixed\npoint solution spaces. They are also necessary to validate the numerical\nsolution, and provide the physical part in the limit that the cutoff is\nremoved: the fixed point equation of state. As an example we apply the\ntechniques to a recent $f(R)$ approximation by Demmel et al, finding asymptotic\nmatches to their numerical solution. Depending on the value of the endomorphism\nparameter, we find many other asymptotic solutions and fixed point solution\nspaces of differing dimensions, yielding several alternative scenarios for the\nequation of state. Asymptotic studies of other $f(R)$ approximations are needed\nto clarify the picture.\n", "  Properties of $\\Lambda,~\\Xi^0$ hypernuclei and neutron stars are investigated\nin quark mean field model with pion and gluon corrections. Firstly, $u, ~d$,\nand $s$ quarks are confined by relativistic harmonic oscillator potentials to\ngenerate the baryons, like nucleon, $\\Lambda, ~\\Sigma$, and $\\Xi$ hyperons. The\neffects of pion-quark coupling and one-gluon exchange are considered\nperturbatively. Then, the baryons interact with each other through exchanging\n$\\sigma, ~\\omega,$ and $\\rho$ mesons between quarks in hypernuclei and nuclear\nmatter. The strengths of confinement potentials for $u, ~d,$ and $s$ quarks are\ndetermined by the masses and radii of free baryons. The coupling constants\nbetween the quarks and mesons are fixed by the ground-state properties of\nseveral nuclei and single-hyperon potentials at nuclear saturation density,\nwhich arises three parameter sets for the coupling constants between mesons and\nquarks, named QMF-NK1S, QMF-NK2S, and QMF-NK3S. Compared to the results of\nprevious quark mean field model without pion and gluon corrections, it is found\nthat properties of $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei, i.e. the single $\\Lambda$ energies,\nare more consistent with the experimental observables. Properties of $\\Xi^0$\nhypernuclei are also calculated and compared with the results in previous quark\nmean field model. With these three parameter sets, the neutron stars containing\nhyperons are investigated through solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequation. Maximum masses of neutron stars approach $2.1M_\\odot$ with hyperons\nand corresponding radii are around $13$ km.\n", "  We show that, at the critical temperature, there is a class of Lee-Yang zeros\nof the partition function in a general scalar field theory, which location\nscales with the size of the system with a characteristic exponent expressed in\nterms of the isothermal critical exponent $\\delta$. In the thermodynamic limit\nthe zeros belonging to this class condense to the critical point {\\zeta}=1 on\nthe real axis in the complex fugacity plane while the complementary set of\nzeros (with Re {\\zeta} < 1) covers uniformly the unit circle. Although the\naforementioned class degenerates to a single point for an infinite system, when\nthe size is finite it dominates in the partition function and determines the\nself-similar structure (fractal geometry, scaling laws) of the critical system.\nThis property opens up the perspective to formulate finite-size scaling theory\nin effective QCD, near the chiral critical point, in terms of the location of\nLee-Yang zeros.\n", "  Yang-Mills theories supplemented by an additional coordinate constraint,\nwhich is solved and substituted in the original Lagrangian, provide examples of\nthe so called Nambu models, in the case where such constraints arise from\nspontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Some explicit calculations have shown\nthat, after additional conditions are imposed, Nambu models are capable of\nreproducing the original gauge theories, thus making Lorentz violation\nunobservable and allowing the interpretation of the corresponding massless\ngauge bosons as the Goldstone bosons arising from the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. A natural question posed by this approach in the realm of gauge\ntheories is to determine under which conditions the recovery of an arbitrary\ngauge theory from the corresponding Nambu model, defined by a general\nconstraint over the coordinates, becomes possible. We refer to these theories\nas extended Nambu models (ENM) and emphasize the fact that the {defining\ncoordinate} constraint is not treated as a standard gauge fixing term. At this\nlevel, the mechanism for generating the constraint is irrelevant and the case\nof spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking is taken only as a motivation, which\nnaturally bring this problem under consideration. Using a non-perturbative\nHamiltonian analysis we prove that the ENM yields the original gauge theory\nafter we demand current conservation for all time, together with the imposition\nof the Gauss laws constraints as initial conditions upon the dynamics of the\nENM. The Nambu models yielding electrodynamics, Yang Mills theories and\nlinearized gravity are particular examples of our general approach.\n", "  We apply the concept of a frequency-dependent effective temperature based on\nthe fluctuation-dissipation ratio to a driven Brownian particle in a\nnonequilibrium steady state. Using this system as a thermostat for a weakly\ncoupled harmonic oscillator, the oscillator thermalizes according to a\ncanonical distribution at the respective effective temperature across the\nentire frequency spectrum. By turning the oscillator from a passive\n\"thermometer\" into a heat engine, we realize the cyclic extraction of work from\na single thermal reservoir, which is feasible only due to its nonequilibrium\nnature.\n", "  In this letter, we present a study of the condensation of exciton-polaritons\nin large etched pillar structures that exhibit shallow edge trapping. The\n$\\approx$ 100 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 100 $\\mu$m pillars were fabricated using\nphotolithography and a BCl$_3$/Cl$_2$ reactive ion etch. A low energy region\nemerged along the etched edge, with the minima $\\approx$ 7 $\\mu$m from the\nouter edge. The depth of the trap was 0.5-1.5 meV relative to the level central\nregion, with the deepest trapping at the corners. We were able to produce a\nBose-Einstein condensate in the trap near the edges and corners by pumping\nnon-resonantly in the middle of the pillar. This condensate began as a set of\ndisconnected condensates at various points along the edges, but then became a\nsingle mono-energetic condensate as the polariton density was increased.\nSimilar edge traps could be used to produce shallow 1D traps along edges or\nother more complex traps using various etch geometries and scales.\n", "  In the present article we consider an accurate modeling of spectrograph with\ncascade of volume-phase holographic gratings. The proposed optical scheme\nallows to detect spectra in an extended wavelength range without gaps providing\nrelatively high spectral resolution and high throughput. However, modeling and\nminimization of possible cross-talks between gratings and stray light in such a\nscheme represents a separate task. We use analytical equations of coupled wave\ntheory together with rigorous coupled wave analysis to optimize the gratings\nparameters and further apply the latter together with non-sequential raytracing\nalgorithm to model propagation of beams through the spectrograph. The results\nshow relatively high throughput up to 53% and absence of any significant\ncross-talks or ghost images even for ordinary holograms recorded on dichromated\ngelatin.\n", "  Using micromagnetic simulation, we show that in-plane uniaxial magnetic\nanisotropy (IPUA) can be used to obtain FAN-OUT, AND and OR gates in an array\nof coupled disks with magnetic vortex configuration. First, we studied the\ninfluence of the direction of application of the IPUA on the energy transfer\ntime ({\\tau}) between two identical coupled nanodisks. We found that when the\ndirection of the IPUA is along the x axis the magnetic interaction increases,\nallowing shorter values of {\\tau}, while the IPUA along the y direction has the\nopposite effect. The magnetic interactions between the nanodisks along x and y\ndirections (the coupling integrals) as a function of the uniaxial anisotropy\nconstant (K {\\sigma} ) were obtained using a simple dipolar model. Next, we\ndemonstrated that choosing a suitable direction of application of the IPUA, it\nis possible to create several different logic gates with a single array of\ncoupled nanodisks\n", "  Raman scattering has been employed to investigate lattice and magnetic\nexcitations of the honeycomb Kitaev material $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and its\nHeisenberg counterpart CrCl$_3$. Our phonon Raman spectra give evidence for a\nfirst-order structural transition from a monoclinic to a rhombohedral structure\nfor both compounds. Significantly, only $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ features a large\nthermal hysteresis, consistent with the formation of a wide phase of\ncoexistence. In the related temperature interval of $70-170$ K, we observe a\nhysteretic behavior of magnetic excitations as well. The stronger magnetic\nresponse in the rhombohedral compared to the monoclinic phase evidences a\ncoupling between the crystallographic structure and low-energy magnetic\nresponse. Our results demonstrate that the Kitaev magnetism concomitant with\nfractionalized excitations is susceptible to small variations of bonding\ngeometry.\n", "  We study the tidal deformability of bare quark stars and hybrid compact stars\ncomposed of a quark matter core in general relativity, assuming that the\ndeconfined quark matter exists in a crystalline color superconducting phase. We\nfind that taking the elastic property of crystalline quark matter into account\nin the calculation of the tidal deformability can break the universal I-Love\nrelation discovered for fluid compact stars, which connects the moment of\ninertia and tidal deformability. Our result suggests that measurements of the\nmoment of inertia and tidal deformability can in principle be used to test the\nexistence of solid quark stars, despite our ignorance of the high density\nequation of state (EOS). Assuming that the moment of inertia can be measured to\n10% level, one can then distinguish a 1.4 (1) $M_\\odot$ solid quark star\ndescribed by our quark matter EOS model with a gap parameter $\\Delta=25$ MeV\nfrom a fluid compact star if the tidal deformability can be measured to about\n10% (45%) level. On the other hand, we find that the nuclear matter fluid\nenvelope of a hybrid star can screen out the effect of the solid core\nsignificantly so that the resulting I-Love relation for hybrid stars still\nagrees with the universal relation for fluid stars to about 1% level.\n", "  We have used the Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy technique to monitor the\ncharging process of highly resistive granular thin films. The sample is\nconnected to two leads and is separated by an insulator layer from a gate\nelectrode. When a gate voltage is applied, charges enter from the leads and\nrearrange across the sample. We find very slow processes with characteristic\ncharging times exponentially distributed over a wide range of values, resulting\nin a logarithmic relaxation to equilibrium. After the gate voltage has been\nswitched off, the system again relaxes logarithmically slowly to the new\nequilibrium. The results cannot be explained with diffusion models, but most of\nthem can be understood with a hopping percolation model, in which the\nlocalization length is shorter than the typical site separation. The technique\nis very promising for the study of slow phenomena in highly resistive systems\nand will be able to estimate the conductance of these systems when direct\nmacroscopic measurement techniques are not sensitive enough.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a new even constrained B(C) type Toda hierarchy\nand derive its B(C) type Block type additional symmetry. Also we generalize the\nB(C) type Toda hierarchy to the $N$-component B(C) type Toda hierarchy which is\nproved to have symmetries of a coupled $\\bigotimes^NQT_+ $ algebra ( $N$-folds\ndirect product of the positive half of the quantum torus algebra $QT$).\n", "  In 5D relativity, the usual 4D cosmological constant is determined by the\nextra dimension. If the extra dimension is spacelike, one can get a positive\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and a 4D de Sitter (dS) space. In this paper we\npresent that, if the extra dimension is timelike oppositely, the negative\n$\\Lambda$ will be emerged and the induced 4D space will be an asymptotic\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS). Under the minimum assumption, we solve the Kaluza-Klein\nequation $R_{AB} = 0$ in a canonical system and obtain the AdS solution in a\ngeneral case. The result shows that an AdS space is induced naturally from a\nKaluza-Klein manifold on a hypersurface (brane). The Lagrangian of test\nparticle indicates the equation of motion can be geodesics if the 4D metric is\nindependent of extra dimension. The causality is well respected because it is\nappropriately defined by a null higher dimensional interval. In this 5D\nrelativity, the holographic principle can be used safely because the brane is\nasymptotic Euclidean AdS in the bulk. We also explore some possible holographic\nduality implications about the field/operator correspondence and the two-points\ncorrelation functions.\n", "  This paper describes a general method for manipulation of nuclear spins in\nzero magnetic field. In the absence of magnetic fields, the spins lose the\nindividual information on chemical shifts and inequivalent spins can only be\ndistinguished by nuclear gyromagnetic ratios and spin-spin couplings. For\nspin-1/2 nuclei with different gyromagnetic ratios (i.e., different species) in\nzero magnetic field, we describe the scheme to realize a set of universal\nquantum logic gates, e.g., arbitrary single-qubit gates and two-qubit\ncontrolled-NOT gate. This method allows for universal quantum control in\nsystems which might provide promising applications in materials science,\nchemistry, biology,quantum information processing and fundamental physics.\n", "  From the per unit length free energy for DNA under tension, we have\ncalculated an effective contour length dependent persistence length for short\nDNA. This effective persistence length results from the enhanced fluctuations\nin short DNA. It decreases for shorter DNA, making shorter DNA more flexible.\nThe results of the J-factor calculated using this effective persistence length\nare in good agreement with experimental data.\n", "  In this paper, we derive analytical expressions for the leading-order\nhydrodynamic mobility of a small solid particle undergoing motion tangential to\na nearby large spherical capsule whose membrane possesses resistance towards\nshearing and bending. Together with the results obtained in the first part\n(Daddi-Moussa-Ider and Gekle, Phys. Rev. E {\\bfseries 95}, 013108 (2017)) where\nthe axisymmetric motion perpendicular to the capsule membrane is considered,\nthe solution of the general mobility problem is thus determined. We find that\nshearing resistance induces a low-frequency peak in the particle self-mobility,\nresulting from the membrane normal displacement in the same way, although less\npronounced, to what has been observed for the axisymmetric motion. In the zero\nfrequency limit, the self-mobility correction near a hard sphere is recovered\nonly if the membrane has a non-vanishing resistance towards shearing. We\nfurther compute the particle in-plane mean-square displacement of a nearby\ndiffusing particle, finding that the membrane induces a long-lasting\nsubdiffusive regime. Considering capsule motion, we find that the correction to\nthe pair-mobility function is solely determined by membrane shearing\nproperties. Our analytical calculations are compared and validated with fully\nresolved boundary integral simulations where a very good agreement is obtained.\n", "  Deviation and precession effects of a bunch of spinning particles in the\nfield of a weak gravitational plane wave are studied according to the\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) model. Before the passage of the wave the\nparticles are at rest with associated spin vector aligned along a given\ndirection with constant magnitude. The interaction with the gravitational wave\ncauses the particles to keep moving on the 2-plane orthogonal to the direction\nof propagation of the wave, with the transverse spin vector undergoing\noscillations around the initial orientation. The transport equations for both\nthe deviation vector an spin vector between two neighboring world lines of such\na congruence are then solved by a suitable extension of the MPD model off the\nspinning particle's world line. In order obtain measurable physical quantities\na \"laboratory\" has been set up by constructing a Fermi coordinate system\nattached to a reference world line. The {\\it exact} transformation between TT\ncoordinates and Fermi coordinates is derived too.\n", "  An N=4 supersymmetric extension of the l-conformal Galilei algebra is\nconstructed. This is achieved by combining generators of spatial symmetries\nfrom the l-conformal Galilei algebra and those underlying the most general\nsuperconformal group in one dimension D(2,1;a). The value of the group\nparameter a is fixed from the requirement that the resulting superalgebra is\nfinite-dimensional. The analysis reveals a=-1/2 thus reducing D(2,1;a) to\nOSp(4|2).\n", "  We apply the geometric quantization procedure via symplectic groupoids\nproposed by E. Hawkins to the setting of epistemically restricted toy theories\nformalized by Spekkens. In the continuous degrees of freedom, this produces the\nalgebraic structure of quadrature quantum subtheories. In the odd-prime finite\ndegrees of freedom, we obtain a functor from the Frobenius algebra in\n\\textbf{Rel} of the toy theories to the Frobenius algebra of stabilizer quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  Coexistence of different geometric shapes at low energies presents a\nuniversal structure phenomenon that occurs over the entire chart of nuclides.\nStudies of the shape coexistence are important for understanding the\nmicroscopic origin of collectivity and modifications of shell structure in\nexotic nuclei far from stability. The aim of this work is to provide a\nsystematic analysis of characteristic signatures of coexisting nuclear shapes\nin different mass regions, using a global self-consistent theoretical method\nbased on universal energy density functionals and the quadrupole collective\nmodel. The low-energy excitation spectrum and quadrupole shape invariants of\nthe two lowest $0^{+}$ states of even-even nuclei are obtained as solutions of\na five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) model, with parameters\ndetermined by constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the\nrelativistic energy density functional PC-PK1, and a finite-range pairing\ninteraction. The theoretical excitation energies of the states: $2^+_1$,\n$4^+_1$, $0^+_2$, $2^+_2$, $2^+_3$, as well as the $B(E2; 0^+_1\\to 2^+_1)$\nvalues, are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental values\nfor 621 even-even nuclei. Quadrupole shape invariants have been implemented to\ninvestigate shape coexistence, and the distribution of possible\nshape-coexisting nuclei is consistent with results obtained in recent\ntheoretical studies and available data. The present analysis has shown that,\nwhen based on a universal and consistent microscopic framework of nuclear\ndensity functionals, shape invariants provide distinct indicators and reliable\npredictions for the occurrence of low-energy coexisting shapes. This method is\nparticularly useful for studies of shape coexistence in regions far from\nstability where few data are available.\n", "  The use of Fourier methods in wave-front reconstruction can significantly\nreduce the computation time for large telescopes with a high number of degrees\nof freedom. However, Fourier algorithms for discrete data require a rectangular\ndata set which conform to specific boundary requirements, whereas wave-front\nsensor data is typically defined over a circular domain (the telescope pupil).\nHere we present an iterative Gerchberg routine modified for the purposes of\ndiscrete wave-front reconstruction which adapts the measurement data\n(wave-front sensor slopes) for Fourier analysis, fulfilling the requirements of\nthe Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and providing accurate reconstruction. The\nroutine is used in the adaptation step only and can be coupled to any other\nWiener-like or least-squares method. We compare simulations using this method\nwith previous Fourier methods and show an increase in performance in terms of\nStrehl ratio and a reduction in noise propagation for a 40x40 SPHERE-like\nadaptive optics system. For closed loop operation with minimal iterations the\nGerchberg method provides an improvement in Strehl, from 95.4% to 96.9% in\nK-band. This corresponds to ~40 nm improvement in rms, and avoids the high\nspatial frequency errors present in other methods, providing an increase in\ncontrast towards the edge of the correctable band.\n", "  Aims. We study the forward shock in the oxygen-rich young supernova remnant\n(SNR) 1E0102.2-7219 (1E0102 in short) via optical coronal emission from [Fe\nXIV] and [Fe XI]: emission lines which offer an alternative method to X-rays to\ndo so.\n  Methods. We have used the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) optical\nintegral field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on Cerro Paranal\nto obtain deep observations of SNR 1E0102 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our\nobservations cover the entire extent of the remnant with a seeing limited\nspatial resolution of 0.7\" = 0.2 pc at the distance of 1E 0102.\n  Results. Our MUSE observations unambiguously reveal the presence of [Fe XIV]\nand [Fe XI] emission in 1E0102. The emission largely arises from a thin,\npartial ring of filaments surrounding the fast moving O-rich ejecta in the\nsystem. The brightest [Fe XIV] and [Fe XI] emission is found along the eastern\nand north-western sides of 1E0102, where shocks are driven into denser ISM\nmaterial, while fainter emission along the northern edge reveals the location\nof the forward shock in lower density gas, possibly the relic stellar wind\ncavity. Modeling of the eastern shocks and the photoionization precursor\nsurrounding 1E0102, we derive a pre-shock density $n_H$ = (7.4 +-1.5)\ncm$^{-3}$, and a shock velocity 330 km/s < $v_s$ < 350 km/s.\n", "  We investigate with experiments and novel mapping the structure of a\nhexagonally ordered filament bundle that is held near its ends and\nprogressively twisted around its central axis. The filaments are free to slide\nrelative to each other and are further held under tension-free boundary\nconditions. Measuring the bundle packing with micro x-ray imaging, we find that\nthe filaments develop the helical rotation $\\Omega$ imposed at the boundaries.\nWe then show that the observed structure is consistent with a mapping of the\nfilament positions to disks packed on a dual non-Euclidean surface with a\nGaussian curvature which increases with twist. We further demonstrate that the\nmean inter-filament distance is minimal on the surface which can be\napproximated by a hemisphere with an effective curvature $K_{eff} = 3\\Omega^2$.\nExamining the packing on the dual surface, we analyze the geometric frustration\nof packing in twisted bundles and find the core to remain relatively\nhexagonally ordered with inter-filament strains growing from the bundle center,\ndriving the formation of defects at the exterior of highly twisted bundles.\n", "  We consider reflection-positivity (Osterwalder-Schrader positivity, O.S.-p.)\nas it is used in the study of renormalization questions in physics. In concrete\ncases, this refers to specific Hilbert spaces that arise before and after the\nreflection. Our focus is a comparative study of the associated spectral theory,\nnow referring to the canonical operators in these two Hilbert spaces. Indeed,\nthe inner product which produces the respective Hilbert spaces of quantum\nstates changes, and comparisons are subtle.\n  We analyze in detail a number of geometric and spectral theoretic properties\nconnected with axiomatic reflection positivity, as well as their probabilistic\ncounterparts; especially the role of the Markov property. This view also\nsuggests two new theorems, which we prove. In rough outline: It is possible to\nexpress OS-positivity purely in terms of a triple of projections in a fixed\nHilbert space, and a reflection operator. For such three projections, there is\na related property, often referred to as the Markov property; and it is well\nknown that the latter implies the former; i.e., when the reflection is given,\nthen the Markov property implies O.S.-p., but not conversely. In this paper we\nshall prove two theorems which flesh out a much more precise relationship\nbetween the two. We show that for every OS-positive system\n$\\left(E_{+},\\theta\\right)$, the operator $E_{+}\\theta E_{+}$ has a canonical\nand universal factorization.\n", "  Conventional superconductivity, as used in this review, refers to\nelectron-phonon coupled superconducting electron-pairs described by BCS theory.\nUnconventional superconductivity refers to superconductors where the Cooper\npairs are not bound together by phonon exchange but instead by exchange of some\nother kind, e. g. spin fluctuations in a superconductor with magnetic order\neither coexistent or nearby in the phase diagram. Such unconventional\nsuperconductivity has been known experimentally since heavy fermion CeCu2Si2,\nwith its strongly correlated 4f electrons, was discovered to superconduct below\n0.6 K in 1979. Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the\nlayered cuprates in 1986, the study of these materials saw Tc jump to 164 K by\n1994. Further progress in high temperature superconductivity would be aided by\nunderstanding the cause of such unconventional pairing. This review compares\nthe fundamental properties of 9 unconventional superconducting classes of\nmaterials - from 4f-electron heavy fermions to organic superconductors to\nclasses where only three known members exist to the cuprates with over 200\nexamples, with the hope that common features will emerge to help theory explain\n(and predict!) these phenomena. In addition, three new emerging classes of\nsuperconductors (topological, interfacial [e. g. FeSe on SrTiO3], and H2S under\nhigh pressure) are briefly covered, even though their conventionality is not\nyet fully determined.\n", "  The study of systems with sustained energy uptake and dissipation at the\nscale of the constituent particles is an area of central interest in\nnonequilibrium statistical physics. Identifying such systems as a distinct\ncategory -- Active Matter -- unifies our understanding of autonomous collective\nmove- ment in the living world and in some surprising inanimate imitations. In\nthis article I present the Active Matter framework, briefly recall some early\nwork, review our recent results on single-particle and collective behaviour,\nincluding experiments on active granular monolayers, and discuss new directions\nfor the future.\n", "  We performed $^{59}$Co nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of\nsingle-crystalline U$_6$Co. There is a small decrease in the Knight shift in\nthe superconducting (SC) state, but this change mainly arises from the SC\ndiamagnetic effect. The negligible change of the spin part of the Knight shift,\ntogether with the absence of the Pauli-paramagnetic effect in the SC U$_6$Co,\nis understood as a consequence of the small spin susceptibility. The nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ is also measured in the SC state under the\nmagnetic field, and exhibits a tiny Hebel-Slichter peak just below the SC\ntransition temperature and exponential behavior at lower temperatures. These\nbehaviors are in agreement with the full-gap s-wave pairing in U$_6$Co.\n", "  Complex oxides exhibit many intriguing phenomena, including metal-insulator\ntransition, ferroelectricity/multiferroicity, colossal magnetoresistance and\nhigh transition temperature superconductivity. Advances in epitaxial thin film\ngrowth techniques enable us to combine different complex oxides with atomic\nprecision and form an oxide heterostructure. Recent theoretical and\nexperimental work has shown that charge transfer across oxide interfaces\ngenerally occurs and leads to a great diversity of emergent interfacial\nproperties which are not exhibited by bulk constituents. In this report, we\nreview mechanisms and physical consequence of charge transfer across interfaces\nin oxide heterostructures. Both theoretical proposals and experimental\nmeasurements of various oxide heterostructures are discussed and compared. We\nalso review the theoretical methods that are used to calculate charge transfer\nacross oxide interfaces and discuss the success and challenges in theory.\nFinally, we present a summary and perspectives for future research.\n", "  The \"double diffusivity\" model was proposed in the late 1970s, and reworked\nin the early 1980s, as a continuum counterpart to existing discrete models of\ndiffusion corresponding to high diffusivity paths, such as grain boundaries and\ndislocation lines. Technically, the model pans out as a system of coupled {\\it\nFick type} diffusion equations to represent \"regular\" and \"high\" diffusivity\npaths with \"source terms\" accounting for the mass exchange between the two\npaths. The model remit was extended by analogy to describe flow in porous media\nwith double porosity, as well as to model heat conduction in media with two\nnon-equilibrium local temperature baths e.g. ion and electron baths. Uncoupling\nof the two partial differential equations leads to a higher-ordered diffusion\nequation, solutions of which could be obtained in terms of classical diffusion\nequation solutions. Similar equations could also be derived within an \"internal\nlength\" gradient (ILG) mechanics formulation applied to diffusion problems,\n{\\it i.e.}, by introducing nonlocal effects, together with inertia and\nviscosity, in a mechanics based formulation of diffusion theory. This issue\nbecomes particularly important in the case of diffusion in nanopolycrystals\nwhose deterministic ILG based theoretical calculations predict a relaxation\ntime that is only about one-tenth of the actual experimentally verified\ntimescale. This article provides the \"missing link\" in this estimation by\nadding a vital element in the ILG structure, that of stochasticity, that takes\ninto account all boundary layer fluctuations. Our stochastic-ILG diffusion\ncalculation confirms rapprochement between theory and experiment, thereby\nbenchmarking a new generation of gradient-based continuum models that conform\ncloser to real life fluctuating environments.\n", "  The quantum phases of 2-leg spin-1/2 ladders with skewed rungs are obtained\nusing exact diagonalization of systems with up to 26 spins and by density\nmatrix renormalization group calculations to 500 spins. The ladders have\nisotropic antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange $J_2 > 0$ between first neighbors in\nthe legs, variable isotropic AF exchange $J_1$ between some first neighbors in\ndifferent legs, and an unpaired spin per odd-membered ring when $J_1 \\gg J_2$.\nLadders with skewed rungs and variable $J_1$ have frustrated AF interactions\nleading to multiple quantum phases: AF at small $J_1$, either F or AF at large\n$J_1$, as well as bond-order-wave phases or reentrant AF (singlet) phases at\nintermediate $J_1$.\n", "  The double-polarization observable $E$ and the helicity-dependent cross\nsections $\\sigma_{1/2}$ and $\\sigma_{3/2}$ have been measured for the first\ntime for single $\\pi^{0}$ photoproduction from protons and neutrons bound in\nthe deuteron at the electron accelerator facility MAMI in Mainz, Germany. The\nexperiment used a circularly polarized photon beam and a longitudinally\npolarized deuterated butanol target. The reaction products, recoil nucleons and\ndecay photons from the $\\pi^0$ meson were detected with the Crystal Ball and\nTAPS electromagnetic calorimeters. Effects from nuclear Fermi motion were\nremoved by a kinematic reconstruction of the $\\pi^{0}N$ final state. A\ncomparison to data measured with a free proton target showed that the absolute\nscale of the cross sections is significantly modified by nuclear final-state\ninteraction (FSI) effects. However, there is no significant effect on the\nasymmetry $E$ since the $\\sigma_{1/2}$ and $\\sigma_{3/2}$ components appear to\nbe influenced in a similar way. Thus, the best approximation of the two\nhelicity-dependent cross sections for the free neutron is obtained by combining\nthe asymmetry $E$ measured with quasi-free neutrons and the unpolarized cross\nsection corrected for FSI effects under the assumption that the FSI effects are\nsimilar for neutrons and protons.\n", "  The influence of hydrogen gas absorption by the Pd layer of bi-layered films\ncontaining Pd and Co layers on the inverse Spin Hall Effect (iSHE) in the\nmaterial is measured. iSHE is driven by ferromagnetic resonance in the cobalt\nlayer. In these conditions, the iSHE is seen as a d.c. voltage across the Pd\nlayer. In the presence of hydrogen gas the iSHE peak shifts downwards in the\napplied field together with the ferromagnetic resonance absorption peak for the\nmaterial. In parallel, an increase in the iSHE peak height and in its width is\nobserved. Our analysis suggests that these observations can potentially be\nexplained as a reduction in the spin Hall angle for the Palladium layer in the\npresence of hydrogen gas.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the pairing in spherical nuclei. We use the\nsame finite-range interaction of Gogny type in the three steps of our approach,\nHartree-Fock, Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer, and quasi-particle random phase\napproximation calculations. We study electric and magnetic dipole, quadrupole\nand octuple excitations in oxygen and calcium isotopes and also in isotopes\nwith 20 neutrons. We investigate the pairing effects on single particle\nenergies and occupation probabilities, on the excitation energies, $B$-values\nand collectivity of low-lying states including the isoscalar electric dipole\nand the magnetic dipole excitations, and also the giant resonances. The\ninclusion of the pairing increases the values of the excitation energies in all\nthe cases we have studied. In general, the effects of the pairing are too small\nto remarkably improve the agreement with the available experimental data.\n", "  Under the low density and high temperature conditions typical of heliospheric\nplasmas, the macroscopic evolution of the heliosphere is strongly affected by\nthe kinetic plasma physics governing fundamental microphysical mechanisms.\nKinetic turbulence, collision less magnetic reconnection, particle\nacceleration, and kinetic instabilities are four poorly understood,\ngrand-challenge problems that lie at the new frontier of kinetic heliophysics.\nThe increasing availability of high cadence and high phase-space resolution\nmeasurements of particle velocity distributions by current and upcoming\nspacecraft missions and of massively parallel nonlinear kinetic simulations of\nweakly collisional heliospheric plasmas provides the opportunity to transform\nour understanding of these kinetic mechanisms through the full utilization of\nthe information contained in the particle velocity distributions. Several major\nconsiderations for future investigations of kinetic heliophysics are examined.\nTurbulent dissipation followed by particle heating is highlighted as an\ninherently two-step process in weakly collisional plasmas, distinct from the\nmore familiar case in fluid theory. Concerted efforts must be made to tackle\nthe big-data challenge of visualizing the high-dimensional (3D-3V) phase space\nof kinetic plasma theory through physics-based reductions. Furthermore, the\ndevelopment of innovative analysis methods that utilize full velocity-space\nmeasurements, such as the field-particle correlation technique, will enable us\nto gain deeper insight into these four grand-challenge problems of kinetic\nheliophysics. A systems approach to tackle the multi-scale problem of\nheliophysics through a rigorous connection between the kinetic physics at\nmicroscales and the self-consistent evolution of the heliosphere at macro\nscales will propel the field of kinetic heliophysics into the future.\n", "  The magnetic structure and spin-wave excitations in the quasi-square-lattice\nlayered perovskite compound La$_5$Mo$_4$O$_{16}$ were studied by a combination\nof neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering techniques using\npolycrystalline sample. Neutron powder diffraction refinement revealed that the\nmagnetic structure is ferrimagnetic in the $ab$ plane with antiferromagnetic\nstacking along the $c$ axis where the magnetic propagation vector is\n$\\mathbf{k}=\\left(0,0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. The ordered magnetic moments are\nestimated to be $0.54(2)\\mu_\\text{B}$ for Mo$^{5+}$ ($4d^1$) ions and\n$1.07(3)\\mu_\\text{B}$ for Mo$^{4+}$ ($4d^2$) ions at 4 K, which are about half\nof the expected values. The inelastic neutron scattering results display strong\neasy-axis magnetic anisotropy along the $c$ axis due to the spin-orbit\ninteraction in Mo ions evidenced by the spin gap at the magnetic zone center.\nThe model Hamiltonian consisting of in-plane anisotropic exchange interactions,\nthe interlayer exchange interaction, and easy-axis single-ion anisotropy can\nexplain our inelastic neutron scattering data well. Strong Ising-like\nanisotropy and weak interlayer coupling compared with the intralayer exchange\ninteraction can explain both the high-temperature magnetoresistance and\nlong-time magnetization decay recently observed in La$_5$Mo$_4$O$_{16}$.\n", "  We explore transport properties of a normal metal-superconductor-normal metal\n(NSN) junction, where the superconducting region supports mixed singlet and\nchiral triplet pairings. We show that in the subgapped regime when the chiral\ntriplet pairing amplitude dominates over that of the singlet, a resonance\nphenomena emerges out where all the quantum mechanical scattering probabilities\nacquire a value of 0.25. At the resonance, crossed Andreev reflection mediating\nthrough such junction, acquires a zero energy peak. This reflects as a zero\nenergy peak in the conductance as well in the topological phase when $\\Delta_p\n> \\Delta_s$.\n", "  Using the tight-binding approach, we analyze the effect of a one-dimensional\nsuperlattice (1DSL) potential on the electronic structure of black phosphorene\nand transition metal dichalcogenides. We observe that the 1DSL potential\nresults in a decrease of the energy band gap of the two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials. An analytical model is presented to relate the decrease in the\ndirect-band gap to the different orbital characters between the valence band\ntop and conduction band bottom of the 2D materials. The direct-to-indirect gap\ntransition, which occurs under a 1DSL potential with an unequal barrier width,\nis also discussed.\n", "  Microscopic Imaging Ellipsometry is an optical technique that uses an\nobjective and sensing procedure to measure the ellipsometric parameters {\\Psi}\nand {\\Delta} in the form of microscopic maps. This technique is well known for\nbeing non-invasive and label-free. Therefore it can be used to detect and\ncharacterize biological species without any impact. In this work MIE was used\nto measure the optical response of dried Streptococcus mutans cells on a glass\nsubstrate. The ellipsometric {\\Psi} and {\\Delta} maps were obtained with Optrel\nMultiskop system for specular reflection in the visible range ({\\lambda}= 450nm\n-750nm). The {\\Psi} and {\\Delta} images at 500nm, 600nm, and 700nm were\nanalyzed using three different theoretical models with single-bounce,\ntwo-bounce, and multi-bounce light paths to obtain the optical constants and\nheight distribution. The obtained images of the optical constants show\ndifferent aspects when comparing the single-bounce analysis with the two-bounce\nor multi-bounce analysis in detecting S. mutans samples. Furthermore, the\nheight distributions estimated by two-bounce and multi-bounce analysis of S.\nmutans samples were in agreement with the thickness values measured by AFM,\nwhich implies that the two-bounce and multi-bounce analysis can provide\ninformation complementary to that obtained by single-bounce light path.\n", "  Shearing transitions of multi-layer molecularly thin-film lubrication systems\nin variations of the film-substrate coupling strength and the load are studied\nby using a multiscale method. Three kinds of the interlayer slips found in\ndecreasing the coupling strength are in qualitative agreement with experimental\nresults. Although tribological behaviors are almost insensitive to the smaller\ncoupling strength, they and the effective film thickness are enlarged more and\nmore as the larger one increases. When the load increases, the tribological\nbehaviors are similar to those in increasing coupling strength, but the\neffective film thickness is opposite.\n", "  Recent theories of hot-electron relaxation in dense hydrogen or deuterium are\nexamined in the light of recent molecular-dynamics simulations as well as\nvarious theoretical developments within the two-temperature model. The\ntheoretical work since 1998 have led to the formulation of the $f$-sum version\nof the Fermi Golden rule formula as the most convenient method for the\ncalculation of the rate of cooling of hot electrons where energy is transferred\nto cold ions. The attempt to include relaxation via the ion-acoustic modes of\nthe two coupled subsystems, i.e., electrons and ions has led to a coupled-mode\nformulation which has now been established by a variety of formal methods.\nHowever, various simplified calculational models of the system with\ncoupled-modes, as well as sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations seem to\ndisagree. It is expected that coupled-mode calculations which use the simple\nCoulomb potential $V_{ei}(r)=-|e|Z/r$ for the electron-ion interaction within\nRPA will greatly over-estimate the coupled-mode contribution. A weak\npseudopotential $U_{ei}(r)$ would probably bring the estimated coupled-mode\ncontribution to agree with that obtained by simulations. It is suggested that\nthe available `reduced models' have been constructed without much attention to\nthe satisfaction of important sum rules, Kramers-Kr\\\"onig relations etc. We\nalso deal with the question of how strongly coupled ion-ion systems can be\naddressed by an extension of the second-order linear response theory which is\nthe basis of current formulations of energy relaxation in warm-dense matter\nsystems. These are of interest in a variety of fields including hot-electron\nsemi-conductor devices, inertial-fusion studies of hot compressed hydrogen, as\nwell as in astrophysical applications.\n", "  The ratios $R_{2k}$ of renormalized coupling constants $g_{2k}$ that enter\nthe effective potential and small-field equation of state acquire the universal\nvalues at criticality. They are calculated for the three-dimensional scalar\n$\\lambda\\phi^4$ field theory (3D Ising model) within the pseudo-$\\epsilon$\nexpansion approach. Pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions for the critical values of\n$g_6$, $g_8$, $g_{10}$, $R_6 = g_6/g_4^2$, $R_8 = g_8/g_4^3$ and $R_{10} =\ng_{10}/g_4^4$ originating from the five-loop renormalization group (RG) series\nare derived. Pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions for the sextic coupling have rapidly\ndiminishing coefficients, so addressing Pad\\'e approximants yields proper\nnumerical results. Use of Pad\\'e--Borel--Leroy and conformal mapping\nresummation techniques further improves the accuracy leading to the values\n$R_6^* = 1.6488$ and $R_6^* = 1.6490$ which are in a brilliant agreement with\nthe result of advanced lattice calculations. For the octic coupling the\nnumerical structure of the pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions is less favorable.\nNevertheless, the conform-Borel resummation gives $R_8^* = 0.868$, the number\nbeing close to the lattice estimate $R_8^* = 0.871$ and compatible with the\nresult of 3D RG analysis $R_8^* = 0.857$. Pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions for\n$R_{10}^*$ and $g_{10}^*$ are also found to have much smaller coefficients than\nthose of the original RG series. They remain, however, fast growing and big\nenough to prevent obtaining fair numerical estimates.\n", "  River deposits are one of the main lines of evidence that tell us that Mars\nonce had a climate different from today, and so changes in river deposits with\ntime tell us something about how Mars climate changed with time. In this study,\nwe focus in on one sedimentary basin - Aeolis Dorsa - which contains an\nexceptionally high number of exceptionally well-preserved river deposits that\nappear to have formed over an interval of $>$0.5 Myr. We use changes in the\nriver deposits' scale with stratigraphic elevation as a proxy for changes in\nriver paleodischarge. Meander wavelengths tighten upwards and channel widths\nnarrow upwards, and there is some evidence for a return to wide\nlarge-wavelength channels higher in the stratigraphy. Meander wavelength and\nchannel width covary with stratigraphic elevation. The factor of 1.5-2\nvariations in paleochannel dimensions with stratigraphic elevation correspond\nto $\\sim$2.6-fold variability in bank-forming discharge (using standard\nwavelength-discharge scalings and width-discharge scalings). Taken together\nwith evidence from a marker bed for discharge variability at $\\sim$10m\nstratigraphic distances, the variation in the scale of river deposits indicates\nthat bank-forming discharge varied at both 10m stratigraphic (10$^2$ - 10$^6$\nyr) and $\\sim$100 m stratigraphic (10$^3$ - 10$^9$ yr) scales. Because these\nvariations are correlated across the basin, they record a change in basin-scale\nforcing, rather than smaller-scale internal feedbacks. Changing sediment input\nleading to a change in characteristic slopes and/or drainage area could be\nresponsible, and another possibility is changing climate ($\\pm$50 W/m$^2$ in\npeak energy available for snow/ice melt).\n", "  We implement and test the exact time integration method proposed by Townsend\n2009 for gas cooling in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The errors using\nthis time integrator for the internal energy are limited by the resolution of\nthe cooling tables and are insensitive to the size of the timestep, improving\naccuracy relative to explicit or implicit schemes when the cooling time is\nshort. We compare results with different time integrators for gas cooling in\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the temperature of the gas\nin filaments before accreting into dark matter halos to form stars, obtained\nwith the exact cooling integration, lies close to the equilibrium where\nradiative cooling balances heating from the UV background. For comparison, the\ngas temperature without the exact integrator shows substantial deviations from\nthe equilibrium relation. Galaxy stellar masses with the exact cooling\ntechnique agree reasonably well, but are systematically lower than the results\nobtained by the other integration schemes, reducing the need for feedback to\nsuppress star formation. Our implementation of the exact cooling technique is\nprovided and can be easily incorporated into any hydrodynamic code.\n", "  Our predictions, based on density-functional calculations, reveal that\nsurface doping of ZnO nanowires with Bi leads to a linear-in-$k$ splitting of\nthe conduction-band states, through spin-orbit interaction, due to the lowering\nof the symmetry in the presence of the dopant. This finding implies that spin\npolarization of the conduction electrons in Bi-doped ZnO nanowires could be\ncontrolled with applied electric (as opposed to magnetic) fields, making them\ncandidate materials for spin-orbitronic applications. Our findings also show\nthat the degree of spin splitting could be tuned by adjusting the dopant\nconcentration. Defect calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations\nindicate that stable doping configurations exhibiting the foregoing\nlinear-in-$k$ splitting could be realized under reasonable thermodynamic\nconditions.\n", "  The APerture SYNthesis SIMulator is a simple interactive tool to help the\nstudents visualize and understand the basics of the Aperture Synthesis\ntechnique, applied to astronomical interferometers. The users can load many\ndifferent interferometers and source models (and also create their own), change\nthe observing parameters (e.g., source coordinates, observing wavelength,\nantenna location, integration time, etc.), and even deconvolve the\ninterferometric images and corrupt the data with gain errors (amplitude and\nphase). The program is fully interactive and all the figures are updated in\nreal time. APSYNSIM has already been used in several interferometry schools and\nhas got very positive feedback from the students.\n", "  A protein is traditionally visualised as a piecewise linear discrete curve,\nand its geometry is conventionally characterised by the extrinsically\ndetermined Ramachandran angles. However, a protein backbone has also two\nindependent intrinsic geometric structures, due to the peptide planes and the\nside chains. Here we adapt and develop modern 3D virtual reality techniques to\nscrutinize the atomic geometry along a protein backbone, in the vicinity of a\npeptide plane. For this we compare backbone geometry-based (extrinsic) and\nstructure-based (intrinsic) coordinate systems, and as an example we inspect\nthe trans and cis peptide planes. We reveal systematics in the way how a cis\npeptide plane deforms the neighbouring atomic geometry, and we develop a\nvirtual reality based visual methodology that can identify the presence of a\ncis peptide plane from the arrangement of atoms in its vicinity. Our approach\ncan easily detect exceptionally placed atoms in crystallographic structures.\nThus it can be employed as a powerful visual refinement tool which is\napplicable also in the case when resolution of the protein structure is limited\nand whenever refinement is needed. As concrete examples we identify a number of\ncrystallographic protein structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) that display\nexceptional atomic positions around their cis peptide planes.\n", "  We demonstrate a one-dimensional optical phased array on an integrated\nsilicon platform for operation at 1.55 microns. Light is emitted end-fire from\nthe chip edge where the waveguides are terminated. The innovative design and\nhigh confinement afforded by the silicon waveguides enables lambda/2 spacing\n(775-nm pitch) at the output. Steering is achieved by inducing a phase shift\nbetween the waveguides via integrated thermo-optic heaters. The device forms a\nbeam with a FWHM angular width of 17 degrees, and we demonstrate beam steering\nover a 64 degrees range.\n", "  The metriplectic formalism couples Poisson brackets of the Hamiltonian\ndescription with metric brackets for describing systems with both Hamiltonian\nand dissipative components. The construction builds in asymptotic convergence\nto a preselected equilibrium state. Phenomena such as friction, electric\nresistivity, thermal conductivity and collisions in kinetic theories are well\nrepresented in this framework. In this paper we present an application of the\nmetriplectic formalism of interest for the theory of control: a suitable torque\nis applied to a free rigid body, which is expressed through a metriplectic\nextension of its \"natural\" Poisson algebra. On practical grounds, the effect is\nto drive the body to align its angular velocity to rotation about a stable\nprincipal axis of inertia, while conserving its kinetic energy in the process.\nOn theoretical grounds, this example shows how the non-Hamiltonian part of a\nmetriplectic system may include convergence to a limit cycle, the first example\nof a non-zero dimensional attractor in this formalism. The method suggests a\nway to extend metriplectic dynamics to systems with general attractors, e.g.\nchaotic ones, with the hope of representing bio-physical, geophysical and\necological models.\n", "  Gallium-based liquid metals have recently been found important in a variety\nof newly emerging applications such as room temperature metal 3D printing,\ndirect writing of electronics and biomedicine etc. In all these practices, one\nfrequently encounters the situations that a printed circuit or track needs to\nbe corrected or the unwanted parts of the device should be removed as desired.\nHowever, few appropriate strategies are currently available to tackle such\nimportant issues at this stage. Here we have identified several low cost ways\ntoward this goal by comparatively investigating three typical strategies\nspanning from mechanical, chemical, to electrochemical principles, for removing\nthe gallium-based liquid metal circuits or thin films. Regarding the mechanical\napproach, we constructed an eraser for removing the liquid metal thin films. It\nwas shown that ethanol (CH3CH2OH) could serve as a good candidacy material for\nthe mechanical eraser. In the chemical category, we adopted alkalis and acids\nto remove the finely printed liquid metal circuits and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\nsolution was particularly revealed to be rather efficient in making a chemical\neraser. In the electrochemical strategy, we applied a 15 V voltage to a liquid\nmetal thin film (covered with water) and successfully removed the target metal\npart. These methods were comparatively evaluated with each of the merits and\nshortcomings preliminarily clarified in the end. The present work is expected\nto be important for the increasing applications of the liquid metal enabled\nadditive manufactures.\n", "  Living organisms process information to interact and adapt to their changing\nenvironment with the goal of finding food, mates or averting hazards. The\nstructure of their niche has profound repercussions by both selecting their\ninternal architecture and also inducing adaptive responses to environmental\ncues and stimuli. Adaptive, collective behaviour underpinned by specialized\noptimization strategies is ubiquitously found in the natural world. This\nexceptional success originates from the processes of fitness and selection.\nHere we prove that a universal physical mechanism of a nonequilibrium\ntransition underlies the collective organization of information-processing\norganisms. As cognitive agents build and update an internal, cognitive\nrepresentation of the causal structure of their environment, complex patterns\nemerge in the system, where the onset of pattern formation relates to the\nspatial overlap of cognitive maps. Studying the exchange of information among\nthe agents reveals a continuous, order-disorder transition. As a result of the\nspontaneous breaking of translational symmetry, a Goldstone mode emerges, which\npoints at a collective mechanism of information transfer among cognitive\norganisms. Taken together, the characteristics of this phase transition\nconsolidate different results in cognitive and biological sciences in a\nuniversal manner. These finding are generally applicable to the design of\nartificial intelligent swarm systems that do not rely on centralized control\nschemes.\n", "  We present radial tracks for four early-type galaxies with embedded\nintermediate-scale discs in a modified spin-ellipticity diagram. Here, each\ngalaxy's spin and ellipticity profiles are shown as a radial track, as opposed\nto a single, flux-weighted aperture-dependent value as is common in the\nliterature. The use of a single ellipticity and spin parameter is inadequate to\ncapture the basic nature of these galaxies, which transition from fast to slow\nrotation as one moves to larger radii where the disc ceases to dominate. After\npeaking, the four galaxy's radial tracks feature a downturn in both ellipticity\nand spin with increasing radius, differentiating them from elliptical galaxies,\nand from lenticular galaxies whose discs dominate at large radii. These\ngalaxies are examples of so-called discy elliptical galaxies, which are a\nmorphological hybrid between elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies, and\nhave been designated ES galaxies.\n  The use of spin-ellipticity tracks provides extra structural information\nabout individual galaxies over a single aperture measure. Such tracks provide a\nkey diagnostic for classifying early-type galaxies, particularly in the era of\n2D kinematic (and photometric) data beyond one effective radius.\n", "  We study the five chirality-flipping interactions that appear in the\ntop-Higgs sector at leading order in the standard model effective field theory.\nWe consider constraints from collider observables, flavor physics, and\nelectric-dipole-moment experiments. This analysis results in very competitive\nconstraints from indirect observables when one considers a single coupling at a\ntime. In addition, we discuss how these limits are affected in scenarios in\nwhich multiple top-Higgs interactions are generated at the scale of new\nphysics.\n", "  Methyl valerate (C$_6$H$_{12}$O$_2$, methyl pentanoate) is a methyl ester and\na relevant surrogate component for biodiesel. In this work, we present ignition\ndelays of methyl valerate measured using a rapid compression machine at a range\nof engine-relevant temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio conditions. The\nconditions we have studied include equivalence ratios from 0.25 to 2.0,\ntemperatures between 680 K and 1050 K, and pressures of 15 bar and 30 bar. The\nignition delay data demonstrate a negative temperature coefficient region in\nthe temperature range of 720 K-800 K for both $\\phi$=2.0, 15 bar and\n$\\phi$=1.0, 30 bar, with two-stage ignition apparent over the narrower\ntemperature ranges of 720 K-760 K for the lower pressure and 740 K-800 K at the\nhigher pressure. In addition, the experimental ignition delay data are compared\nwith simulations using an existing chemical kinetic model from the literature.\nThe simulations with the literature model under-predict the data by factors\nbetween 2 and 10 over the entire range of the experimental data. To help\ndetermine the possible reasons for the discrepancy between simulations and\nexperiments, a new chemical kinetic model is developed using the Reaction\nMechanism Generator (RMG) software. The agreement between the experimental data\nand the RMG model is improved but still not satisfactory. Directions for future\nimprovement of the methyl valerate model are discussed.\n", "  Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is a new advanced engine\nconcept that uses a dual fuel mode of operation to achieve significant\nimprovements in fuel economy and emissions output. The fuels that are typically\nused in this mode include a low- and a high-reactivity fuel in varying\nproportions to control ignition timing. As such, understanding the interaction\neffects during autoignition of binary fuel blends is critical to optimizing\nthese RCCI engines. In this work, we measure the autoignition delays of binary\nblends of dimethyl ether (C$_2$H$_6$O, DME) and methanol (CH$_4$O, MeOH) in a\nrapid compression machine. In these experiments, dimethyl ether and methanol\nfunction as the high- and low-reactivity fuels, respectively. We considered\nfive fuel blends at varying blending ratios (by mole), including 100% DME-0%\nMeOH, 75% DME-25% MeOH, 0% DME-0% MeOH, 25% DME-75% MeOH, and 0% DME-100% MeOH.\nExperiments are conducted at an engine-relevant pressure of 30 bar, for the\nstoichiometric equivalence ratio. In addition, the experimental results are\ncompared with simulations using a chemical kinetic model for DME/MeOH\ncombustion generated by merging independent, well-validated models for DME and\nMeOH.\n", "  In the study of nanobubbles, nanodroplets or nanolenses immobilised on a\nsubstrate, a cross-section of a spherical-cap is widely applied to extract\ngeometrical information from atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic images.\nIn this paper, we have developed a comprehensive 3D spherical cap fitting\nprocedure (3D-SCFP) to extract morphologic characteristics of complete or\ntruncated spherical caps from AFM images. Our procedure integrates several\nadvanced digital image analysis techniques to construct a 3D spherical cap\nmodel, from which the geometrical parameters of the nanostructures are\nextracted automatically by a simple algorithm. The procedure takes into account\nall valid data points in the construction of the 3D spherical cap model to\nachieve high fidelity in morphology analysis. We compare our 3D fitting\nprocedure with the commonly used 2D cross-sectional profile fitting method to\ndetermine the contact angle of a complete spherical cap and a truncated\nspherical cap. The results from 3D-SCFP are consistent and accurate, while 2D\nfitting is unavoidably arbitrary in selection of the cross-section and has a\nmuch lower number of data points on which the fitting can be based, which in\naddition is biased to the top of the spherical cap. We expect that the\ndeveloped 3D spherical-cap fitting procedure will find many applications in\nimaging analysis.\n", "  The Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) spectrum G(t) and Raster\nImage Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) spectrum R(t) of dilute diffusing\nparticles are determined by the displacement distribution function P(x,t) of\nthe particles and by the experimental parameters of the associated optical\ntrains. This letter obtains the general relationships between P(x,t) and these\nspectra. For dilute diffusing molecules in simple liquids, P(x,t) is a Gaussian\nin the displacement x; the corresponding G(t) is a Lorentzian in\n(<(x(t))^2>)^(1/2). In complex fluids such as polymer solutions, colloid and\nprotein solutions, and the interior of living cells, P(x,t) may have a\nnon-Gaussian dependence on x, for example an exponential in |x|. We compare\ntheoretical forms for FCS and for RICS spectra of two systems in which P(x,t)\nis a Gaussian or an exponential in x, but in which the mean-square\ndisplacements are precisely equal at all times. If the G(t) and R(t) arising\nfrom an exponential P(x,t) are interpreted by using the forms for G(t) and R(t)\nthat are appropriate for a Gaussian P(x,t), the inferred diffusion coefficient\nmay be substantially in error.\n", "  Some critical comments on the prevailing model of star-disk interaction are\nmade, in particular, on the rotating nature of the magnetic field lines and on\nthe application of the magnetohydrodynamic frozen-field theorem to the disk\nplasma. As an alternative, a unipolar induction model is proposed, where the\nmagnetic field is stationary in space and the stellar unipolar electric field\n$\\vec E_{*}$ on the surface is uploaded to the magnetosphere. Through the\nPoynting vector, the star and the magnetosphere form a coupled system where the\ntotal angular momentum, consisting the mechanical one of the star, the\nelectromagnetic one of the magnetosphere, and the mechanical one of the plasma\nin the magnetosphere, is conserved. The stellar interaction with the accretion\ndisk is through the projection of the unipolar electric field $\\vec E_{*}$ onto\nthe disk via the equipotential field lines, generating a disk current and\nconsequently toroidal fields with opposite signs on both sides of the disk,\nwith return current loops via the stellar surface. As a result, magnetic flux\nis added to the magnetospheric field in the northern and southern hemispheres\nwith the disk current sheet as the boundary condition. This makes the star-disk\nsystem an astrophysical site where intense magnetic fields are generated\nthrough the rotational energy of the star. Angular momentum extraction from\nthis star-disk system happens as the magnetic flux in the magnetosphere\nincreases to the point that exceeds the current carrying capacity of the disk,\nleading to a mega scale magnetic eruption sending Poynting fluxes to space\neither isotropically or beamed.\n", "  It is shown via theory and simulation that the resonant frequency of a Free\nElectron Laser may be modulated to obtain an FEL interaction with a frequency\nbandwidth which is at least an order of magnitude greater than normal FEL\noperation. The system is described in the linear regime by a summation over\nexponential gain modes, allowing the amplification of multiple light\nfrequencies simultaneously. Simulation in 3D demonstrates the process for\nparameters of the UK's CLARA FEL test facility currently under construction.\nThis new mode of FEL operation has close analogies to Frequency Modulation in a\nconventional cavity laser. This new, wide bandwidth mode of FEL operation\nscales well for X-ray generation and offers users a new form of high-power FEL\noutput.\n", "  In the Grover-type quantum search process a search operator is iteratively\napplied, say, k times, on the initial database state. We present an additive\ndecomposition scheme such that the iteration process is expressed, in the\ncomputational space, as a linear combination of k operators, each of which\nconsists of a single Grover-search followed by an overall phase-rotation. The\nvalue of k and the rotation phase are the same as those determined in the\nframework of the search with certainty. We further show that the final state\ncan be expressed in terms of a single oracle operator of the Grover-search and\nphase-rotation factors. We discuss how the additive form can be utilized so\nthat it effectively reduces the computational load of the iterative search, and\nwe propose an effective shortcut gate that realizes the same outcome as the\niterative search.\n", "  Practical measures of electronic decoherence, called distilled purities, that\nare applicable to many-body systems are introduced. While usual measures of\nelectronic decoherence such as the purity employ the full $N$-particle density\nmatrix which is generally unavailable, the distilled purities are based on the\n$r$-body reduced density matrices ($r$-RDMs) which are more accessible\nquantities. The $r$-body distilled purities are derivative quantities of the\npreviously introduced $r$-body reduced purities [I. Franco and H. Appel, J.\nChem. Phys. 139, 094109 (2013)] that measure the non-idempotency of the\n$r$-RDMs. Specifically, the distilled purities exploit the structure of the\nreduced purities to extract coherences between Slater determinants with integer\noccupations defined by a given single-particle basis that compose an electronic\nstate. In this way, the distilled purities offer a practical platform to\nquantify coherences in a given basis that can be used to analyze the quantum\ndynamics of many-electron systems. Exact expressions for the one-body and\ntwo-body distilled purities are presented and the utility of the approach is\nexemplified via an analysis of the dynamics of oligo-acetylene as described by\nthe Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. Last, the advantages and limitations of\nthe purity, reduced purity and distilled purity as measures of electronic\ncoherence are discussed.\n", "  The readout electronics upgrade for the ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeters at\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider requires a radiation-hard ADC. The design of a\nradiation-hard dual-channel 12-bit 40 MS/s pipeline ADC for this use is\npresented. The design consists of two pipeline A/D channels each with four\nMultiplying Digital-to-Analog Converters followed by 8-bit\nSuccessive-Approximation-Register analog-to-digital converters. The custom\ndesign, fabricated in a commercial 130 nm CMOS process, shows a performance of\n67.9 dB SNDR at 10 MHz for a single channel at 40 MS/s, with a latency of 87.5\nns (to first bit read out), while its total power consumption is 50 mW/channel.\nThe chip uses two power supply voltages: 1.2 and 2.5 V. The sensitivity to\nsingle event effects during irradiation is measured and determined to meet the\nsystem requirements.\n", "  Evaporation of multi-component drops is crucial to various technologies and\nhas numerous potential applications because of its ubiquity in nature.\nSuperamphiphobic surfaces, which are both superhydrophobic and superoleophobic,\ncan give a low wettability not only for water drops but also for oil drops. In\nthis paper, we experimentally, numerically and theoretically investigate the\nevaporation process of millimetric sessile ouzo drops (a transparent mixture of\nwater, ethanol, and trans-anethole) with low wettability on a superamphiphobic\nsurface. The evaporation-triggered ouzo effect, i.e. the spontaneous\nemulsification of oil microdroplets below a specific ethanol concentration,\npreferentially occurs at the apex of the drop due to the evaporation flux\ndistribution and volatility difference between water and ethanol. This\nobservation is also reproduced by numerical simulations. The volume decrease of\nthe ouzo drop is characterized by two distinct slopes. The initial steep slope\nis dominantly caused by the evaporation of ethanol, followed by the slower\nevaporation of water. At later stages, thanks to Marangoni forces the oil wraps\naround the drop and an oil shell forms. We propose an approximate diffusion\nmodel for the drying characteristics, which predicts the evaporation of the\ndrops in agreement with experiment and numerical simulation results. This work\nprovides an advanced understanding of the evaporation process of ouzo\n(multi-component) drops.\n", "  The synthesis of vitamin D is strongly linked to the availability of solar\nenergy. For a long time, it was clear that using the erythemal irradiances is a\ngood choice to calculate the exposure time. Several authors argue that this\nmethod of minimum exposure time overestimates the calculation of the solar\nirradiance of vitamin D. In this paper, the vitamin D and erythemal irradiances\nare calculated on the basis of the spectral solar irradiance in Urcuqu\\'i\n(Ecuador). From these results, we obtain the minimal exposure time. It was\nfound that there is a difference between the use of the erythemal irradiance\nand the vitamin D one; namely, the exposure times were too large (almost a 100%\ndifference) for the erythemal irradiance.\n", "  Free-electron lasers (FELs) opened a new window on imaging the motion of\natoms and molecules. At SLAC, FEL experiments are performed at LCLS using 120\nHz pulses with 10^12 to 10^13 photons in 10 fs (billions of times brighter than\nat the most powerful synchrotrons). Concurrently, users and staff operate under\nhigh pressure due to flexible and often rapidly changing setups and low\ntolerance for system malfunction. This extreme detection environment raises\nunique challenges, from obvious to surprising, and leads to treating detectors\nas consumables. We discuss in detail the detector damage mechanisms observed in\n7 years of operation at LCLS, together with the corresponding damage mitigation\nstrategies and their effectiveness. Main types of damage mechanisms already\nidentified include: (1) x-ray radiation damage (from \"catastrophic\" to\n\"classical\"), (2) direct and indirect damage caused by optical lasers, (3)\nsample induced damage, (4) vacuum related damage, (5) high-pressure\nenvironment. In total, 19 damage mechanisms have been identified. We also\npresent general strategies for reducing damage risk or minimizing the impact of\ndetector damage on the science program. These include availability of\nreplacement parts and skilled operators and also careful planning, incident\ninvestigation resulting in updated designs, procedures and operator training.\n", "  Nanodroplets on a solid surface (i.e. surface nanodroplets) have practical\nimplications for high-throughput chemical and biological analysis,\nlubrications, lab-on-chip devices, and near-field imaging techniques. Oil\nnanodroplets can be produced on a solid-liquid interface in a simple step of\nsolvent exchange in which a good solvent of oil is displaced by a poor solvent.\nIn this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the formation of\nnanodroplets by the solvent exchange process under well-controlled flow\nconditions. We find that the contact angle of the nanodroplets is independent\nof the flow condition. However, there are significant effects from the flow\nrate and the flow geometry on the droplet size. We develop a theoretical\nframework to account for these effects. The main idea is that the droplet\nnuclei are exposed to an oil oversaturation pulse during the exchange process.\nThe analysis gives that the volume of the nanodroplets increases with the\nPeclet number $Pe$ of the flow as $\\propto Pe^{3/4}$, which is in good\nagreement with our experimental results. In addition, at fixed flow rate and\nthus fixed Peclet number, larger and less homogeneously distributed droplets\nformed at less narrow channels, due to convection effects originating from the\ndensity difference between the two solutions of the solvent exchange. The\nunderstanding from this work provides valuable guidelines for producing surface\nnanodroplets with desired sizes by controlling the flow conditions.\n", "  Terahertz driven magnetization dynamics are explored in the orthoferrite\nDyFeO3. A high-field, single cycle THz pulse is used to excite magnon modes in\nthe crystal together with other resonances. Both quasi-ferromagnetic and\nquasi-antiferromagnetic magnon modes are excited and appear in time-resolved\nmeasurements of the Faraday rotation. Other modes are also observed in the\nmeasurements of the time-resolved linear birefringence. Analysis of the\nexcitation process reveals that despite larger than expected electro-optical\nsusceptibility it is mainly the THz magnetic field that couples to the\nquasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-antiferromagnetic magnon branches.\n", "  We study laser cooling of $^{24}$Mg atoms in dipole optical trap with pumping\nfield resonant to narrow $(3s3s)\\,^1S_0 \\rightarrow \\, (3s3p)\\,^{3}P_1$\n($\\lambda = 457$ nm) optical transition. For description of laser cooling of\natoms in the optical trap with taking into account quantum recoil effects we\nconsider two quantum models. The first one is based on direct numerical\nsolution of quantum kinetic equation for atom density matrix and the second one\nis simplified model based on decomposition of atom density matrix over\nvibration states in the dipole trap. We search pumping field intensity and\ndetuning for minimum cooling energy and fast laser cooling.\n", "  Society faces a fundamental global problem of understanding which individuals\nare currently developing strong support for some extremist entity such as ISIS\n(Islamic State) -- even if they never end up doing anything in the real world.\nThe importance of online connectivity in developing intent has been confirmed\nby recent case-studies of already convicted terrorists. Here we identify\ndynamical patterns in the online trajectories that individuals take toward\ndeveloping a high level of extremist support -- specifically, for ISIS. Strong\nmemory effects emerge among individuals whose transition is fastest, and hence\nmay become 'out of the blue' threats in the real world. A generalization of\ndiagrammatic expansion theory helps quantify these characteristics, including\nthe impact of changes in geographical location, and can facilitate prediction\nof future risks. By quantifying the trajectories that individuals follow on\ntheir journey toward expressing high levels of pro-ISIS support -- irrespective\nof whether they then carry out a real-world attack or not -- our findings can\nhelp move safety debates beyond reliance on static watch-list identifiers such\nas ethnic background or immigration status, and/or post-fact interviews with\nalready-convicted individuals. Given the broad commonality of social media\nplatforms, our results likely apply quite generally: for example, even on\nTelegram where (like Twitter) there is no built-in group feature as in our\nstudy, individuals tend to collectively build and pass through so-called\nsuper-group accounts.\n", "  We demonstrate Au-assisted vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth of Ge nanowires\n(NWs) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at 220 {\\deg}C, which is compatible with\nthe temperature window for Si-based integrated circuit. Low temperature grown\nGe NWs hold a smaller size, similar uniformity and better fit with Au tips in\ndiameter, in contrast to Ge NWs grown at around or above the eutectic\ntemperature of Au-Ge alloy in the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth. Three growth\norientations were observed on Ge (110) by the VSS growth at 220 {\\deg}C,\ndiffering from only one growth direction of Ge NWs by the VLS growth at a high\ntemperature. The evolution of NWs dimension and morphology from the VLS growth\nto the VSS growth is qualitatively explained via analyzing the mechanism of the\ntwo growth modes.\n", "  We compute the non-adiabatic production of heavy fermion during inflation due\nto its coupling with inflaton. The coupling, partly inspired by axion\nmonodromy, comes from the modulation of the fermion mass by the inflaton field.\nEven though the fermion mass is always much higher than the Hubble scale and\nthe density of the produced fermions is low, they can still have detectable\nsignatures in the cosmic microwave background. Their contributions to the\nprimordial $N$-spectra are then analyzed in detail and compared with those from\nthe fermion's bosonic super-partner. At the classical level, where the produced\nparticles are treated as classical sources, the effect on the $N$-spectra is\nproportional to the density of the produced particles and the fermion and boson\ncases have the same contribution. Quantum interference, however, leads to\ndistinction between the two cases. Implications of this similarity and\ndistinction are discussed before making general remarks about the limitations\nof our calculation and possible ways of overcoming them.\n", "  A publication trend in Physics Education by employing bibliometric analysis\nleads the researchers to describe current scientific movement. This paper tries\nto answer \"What do Physics education scientists concentrate in their\npublications?\" by analyzing the productivity and development of publications on\nthe subject category of Physics Education in the period 1980--2013. The Web of\nScience databases in the research areas of \"EDUCATION - EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH\"\nwas used to extract the publication trends. The study involves 1360\npublications, including 840 articles, 503 proceedings paper, 22 reviews, 7\neditorial material, 6 Book review, and one Biographical item. Number of\npublications with \"Physical Education\" in topic increased from 0.14 % (n = 2)\nin 1980 to 16.54 % (n = 225) in 2011. Total number of receiving citations is\n8071, with approximately citations per papers of 5.93. The results show the\npublication and citations in Physic Education has increased dramatically while\nthe Malaysian share is well ranked.\n", "  We investigate the quantum phase transition of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nmodel by inspecting the two-site entanglements in the ground state. It is shown\nthat the topological phase transition of the SSH model is signified by a\nnonanalyticity of local entanglement, which becomes discontinuous for finite\neven system sizes, and that this nonanalyticity has a topological origin. Such\na peculiar singularity has a universal nature in one-dimensional topological\nphase transitions of noninteracting fermions. We make this clearer by pointing\nout that an analogous quantity in the Kitaev chain exhibiting the identical\nnonanalyticity is the local electron density. As a byproduct, we show that\nthere exists a different type of phase transition, whereby the pattern of the\ntwo-site entanglements undergoes a sudden change. This transition is\ncharacterised solely by quantum information theory and does not accompany the\nclosure of the spectral gap. We analyse the scaling behaviours of the\nentanglement in the vicinities of the transition points.\n", "  With ultra-fast writing capacity and high reliability, the spin-orbit torque\nis regarded as a promising alternative to fabricate next-generation magnetic\nrandom access memory. However, the three-terminal setup can be challenging when\nscaling down the cell size. In particular, the thermal stability is an\nimportant issue. Here we demonstrate that the current-pulse-induced\nperpendicular exchange bias can significantly relieve the concern of thermal\nstability. The switching of the exchange bias direction is induced by the\nspin-orbit torque when passing current pulses through the Pt/Co system with an\ninserted IrMn antiferromagnetic layer. Manipulating the current-pulse-induced\nexchange bias, spin-orbit-torque switching at zero field between states with\nunidirectional anisotropy is achieved and the thermal agitation of the magnetic\nmoment is strongly suppressed. The spin-orbit torque mechanism provides an\ninnovative method to generate and to control the exchange bias by electrical\nmeans, which enables us to realize the new switching mechanism of highly stable\nperpendicular memory cells.\n", "  The standard way of modeling plasticity in polycrystals is by using the\ncrystal plasticity model for single crystals in each grain, and imposing\nsuitable traction and slip boundary conditions across grain boundaries. In this\nfashion, the system is modeled as a collection of boundary-value problems with\nmatching boundary conditions. In this paper, we develop a diffuse-interface\ncrystal plasticity model for polycrystalline materials that results in a single\nboundary-value problem with a single crystal as the reference configuration.\nUsing a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into lattice\nand plastic parts, i.e. F(X,t) = F^L(X,t) F^P(X,t), an initial stress-free\npolycrystal is constructed by imposing F^L to be a piecewise constant rotation\nfield R^0(X), and F^P = R^0(X)^T, thereby having F(X,0) = I, and zero elastic\nstrain. This model serves as a precursor to higher order crystal plasticity\nmodels with grain boundary energy and evolution.\n", "  The Born-Infeld (BI) model is a nonlinear correction of Maxwell's equations.\nBy adding the energy and Poynting vector as additional variables, it can be\naugmented as a 10$\\times$10 system of hyperbolic conservation laws, called the\naugmented BI (ABI) equations. The author found that, through a quadratic change\nof the time variable, the ABI system gives a simple energy dissipation model\nthat combines Darcy's law and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Using the concept of\n\"relative entropy\" (or \"modulated energy\"), borrowed from the theory of\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws, we introduce a notion of generalized\nsolutions, that we call dissipative solutions. For given initial conditions,\nthe set of generalized solutions is not empty, convex, and compact. Smooth\nsolutions to the dissipative system are always unique in this setting.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically using the atomistic non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction formalism with the inclusion of self-consistent charging, the design\nof a superior thermoelectric generator based on an \"anti-reflection\" coated\ndouble barrier resonant tunnelling diode. Unlike a typical double barrier\ndevice, we show that enabling the anti-reflection design facilitates a \"boxcar\"\ntype feature in its transmission spectrum, which significantly enhances the\nthermoelectric performance. It is demonstrated that the best operating regime\nof this device offers a maximum power in the range of $0.7$ to $0.9 MW/m^{2}$\nat efficiencies ranging from $46$ to $54\\%$ of Carnot efficiency. The physics\nof charge and heat transport in the ballistic regime of operation helps us gain\nadditional insights on how a large number of transverse current carrying modes\nboost the output power and simultaneously how the diminishing effects of\nhigh-energy parasitic currents aid the efficiency. Finally, a comparative study\nwith a conventional double barrier thermoelectric is presented in terms of\nstandard performance parameters which clearly reveals the performance benefits\nof enabling an anti-reflection coating.\n", "  Raman spectra of few-layer WS2 have been measured with up to seven excitation\nenergies, and peculiar resonance effects are observed. The two-phonon acoustic\nphonon scattering signal close to the main E2g1 peak is stronger than the main\npeaks for excitations near the A or B exciton states. The low-frequency Raman\nspectra show a series of shear and layer-breathing modes that are useful for\ndetermining the number of layers. In addition, hitherto unidentified peaks (X1\nand X2), which do not seem to depend on the layer thickness, are observed near\nresonances with exciton states. The polarization dependences of the two peaks\nare different: X1 vanishes in cross polarization, but X2 does not. At the\nresonance with the A exciton state, the Raman-forbidden, lowest-frequency shear\nmode for odd number of layers appears as strong as that for the allowed case of\neven number of layers. This mode also exhibits a strong Breit-Wigner-Fano line\nshape and an anomalous polarization behavior at this resonance.\n", "  The geometric, aesthetic, and mathematical elegance of origami is being\nrecognized as a powerful pathway to self-assembly of micro and nano-scale\nmachines with programmable mechanical properties. The typical approach to\ndesigning the mechanical response of an ideal origami machine is to include\nmechanisms where mechanical constraints transform applied forces into a desired\nmotion along a narrow set of degrees of freedom. In fact, to date, most design\napproaches focus on building up complex mechanisms from simple ones in ways\nthat preserve each individual mechanism's degree of freedom (DOF), with\nexamples ranging from simple robotic arms to homogenous arrays of identical\nvertices, such as the well-known Miura-ori. However, such approaches typically\nrequire tight fabrication tolerances, and often suffer from parasitic\ncompliance. In this work, we demonstrate a technique in which\nhigh-degree-of-freedom mechanisms associated with single vertices are\nheterogeneously combined so that the coupled phase spaces of neighboring\nvertices are pared down to a controlled range of motions. This approach has the\nadvantage that it produces mechanisms that retain the DOF at each vertex, are\nrobust against fabrication tolerances and parasitic compliance, but\nnevertheless effectively constrain the range of motion of the entire machine.\nWe demonstrate the utility of this approach by mapping out the configuration\nspace for the modified Miura-ori vertex of degree 6, and show that when strung\ntogether, their combined configuration spaces create mechanisms that isolate\ndeformations, constrain the configuration topology of neighboring vertices, or\nlead to sequential bistable folding throughout the entire origami sheet.\n", "  We describe a fiber-optic solution for simultaneous distribution of all\nsignals generated at todays most advanced time and frequency laboratories, i.e.\nan ultrastable optical reference frequency derived from an optical atomic\nclock, a radio frequency precisely linked to a realization of the SI-Second,\nand a realization of an atomic timescale, being the local representation of the\nvirtual, global UTC timescale. In our solution both the phase of the optical\ncarrier and the delay of electrical signals (10 MHz frequency reference and one\npulse-per-second time tags) are stabilized against environmental perturbations\ninfluencing the fiber link instability and accuracy. We experimentally\ndemonstrate optical transfer stabilities of 5e-18 and 2e-15 for 100 s averaging\nperiod, for optical carrier and 10 MHz signals, respectively.\n", "  We have determined the spatiotemporal characteristics of the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling using auroral imaging. Observations at\nfixed positions for an extended period of time are provided by a ground-based\nall-sky imager measuring the 557.7 nm auroral emissions. We report on a single\nevent of nightside aurora ($\\sim$22 magnetic local time) preceding a substorm\nonset. To determine the spatiotemporal characteristics, we perform an\ninnovative analysis of an all-sky imager movie (19 min duration, images at 3.31\nHz) that combines a two-dimensional spatial fast Fourier transform with a\ntemporal correlation. We find a scale size-dependent variability where the\nlargest scale sizes are stable on timescales of minutes while the small scale\nsizes are more variable. When comparing two smaller time intervals of different\ntypes of auroral displays, we find a variation in their characteristics. The\ncharacteristics averaged over the event are in remarkable agreement with the\nspatiotemporal characteristics of the nightside field-aligned currents during\nmoderately disturbed times. Thus, two different electrodynamical parameters of\nthe M-I coupling show similar behavior. This gives independent support to the\nclaim of a system behavior that uses repeatable solutions to transfer energy\nand momentum from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.\n", "  In this paper we explore the validity of the Rosenfeld and the Dzugutov\nrelation for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, its repulsive counterpart, the WCA\nsystem and a network forming liquid, the NTW model. We find that for all the\nsystems both the relations are valid at high temperature regime with an\nuniversal exponent close to 0.8. Similar to that observed for the simple\nliquids, the LJ and the WCA systems show a breakdown of the scaling laws at the\nlow temperature regime. However for the NTW model, which is a simple liquid,\nthese scaling laws are valid even at lower temperature regime similar to that\nfound for ionic melts. Thus we find that the NTW model has mixed\ncharacteristics of simple liquids and ionic melts. Our study further reveals a\nquantitative relationship between the Rosenfeld and the Arrhenius relations.\nFor strong liquids, the validity of the Rosenfeld relation in the low\ntemperature regime is connected to it following the Arrhenius behaviour in that\nregime. Finally we explore the role of pair entropy and residual multiparticle\nentropy in the dynamics as a function of fragility of the systems.\n", "  This brief review describes some of the observed properties of the\npopulations of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants\n(RSGs) found in nearby galaxies, with a focus on their luminosity functions,\nmass-loss rates and dust production. I do this within the context of their role\nas potential supernova (SN) progenitors, and the evolution of SNe and their\nremnants. The paper ends with an outlook to the near future, in which new\nfacilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope offer a step change in our\nunderstanding of the evolution and fate of the coolest massive stars in the\nUniverse.\n", "  Network science has released its talents in social network analysis based on\nthe information of static topologies. In reality social contacts are dynamic\nand evolve concurrently in time. Nowadays they can be recorded by ubiquitous\ninformation technologies, and generated into temporal social networks to\nprovide new sights in social reality mining. Here, we define \\emph{circle link}\nto measure contextual relationships in three empirical social temporal\nnetworks, and find that the tendency of friends having frequent continuous\ninteractions with their common friend prefer to be close, which can be\nconsidered as the extension of Granovetter's hypothesis in temporal social\nnetworks. Finally, we present a heuristic method based on circle link to\npredict relationships and acquire acceptable results.\n", "  The correction of Hawking temperature of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black\nhole is investigated using the generalized Klein-Gordon equation and the\ngeneralized Dirac equation by taking the quantum gravity effects into account.\nWe derive the corrected Hawking temperatures for scalar particles and fermions\ncrossing the event horizon. The quantum gravity effects prevent the rise of\ntemperature in the SdS black hole. Besides correction of Hawking temperature,\nthe Hawking radiation of SdS black hole is also investigated using massive\nparticles tunneling method. By considering self gravitation effect of the\nemitted particles and the space time background to be dynamical, it is also\nshown that the tunneling rate is related to the change of Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy and small correction term $(1+2\\beta m^2)$. If the energy and the\nangular momentum are taken to be conserved, the derived emission spectrum\ndeviates from the pure thermal spectrum. This result gives a correction to the\nHawking radiation and is also in agreement with the result of Parikh and\nWilczek.\n", "  Quantum sensing takes advantage of well controlled quantum systems for\nperforming measurements with high sensitivity and precision. We have\nimplemented a concept for quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution,\nindependent of the qubit probe and limited only by the stability of an external\nsynchronization clock. Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in detection to\ncontinuously probe a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single\nnitrogen vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate detection of oscillating\nmagnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 uHz over a MHz bandwidth. The\ncontinuous sampling further guarantees an excellent sensitivity, reaching a\nsignal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10,000:1 for a 170 nT test signal measured\nduring a one-hour interval. Our technique has applications in magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy, quantum simulation, and sensitive signal detection.\n", "  An interaction system has a finite set of agents that interact pairwise,\ndepending on the current state of the system. Symmetric decomposition of the\nmatrix of interaction coefficients yields the representation of states by\nself-adjoint matrices and hence a spectral representation. As a result,\ncooperation systems, decision systems and quantum systems all become visible as\nmanifestations of special interaction systems. The treatment of the theory is\npurely mathematical and does not require any special knowledge of physics. It\nis shown how standard notions in cooperative game theory arise naturally in\nthis context. In particular, Fourier transformation of cooperative games\nbecomes meaningful. Moreover, quantum games fall into this framework. Finally,\na theory of Markov evolution of interaction states is presented that\ngeneralizes classical homogeneous Markov chains to the present context.\n", "  Massive spin-2 particles has been a subject of great interest in current\nresearch. If the graviton has a small mass, the gravitational force at large\ndistances decreases more rapidly, which could contribute to explain the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. The massive spin-2 particles are\ncommonly described by the known Fierz-Pauli action which is formulated in terms\nof a symmetric tensor $h_{\\mu\\nu}=h_{\\nu\\mu}$. However, the Fierz-Pauli theory\nis not the only possible description of massive spin-2 particles via a rank-2\ntensor. There are other two families of models $\\mathcal{L}(a_1)$ and\n$\\mathcal{L}_{nFP}(c)$, where $a_1$ and $c$ are real arbitrary parameters,\nwhich describe massive particles of spin-2 in the flat space via a nonsymmetric\ntensor $e_{\\mu\\nu}\\neq e_{\\nu\\mu}$. In the present work we derive Lagrangian\nconstraints stemming from $\\mathcal{L}(a_1)$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{nFP}(c)$ in\ncurved backgrounds with nonminimal couplings which are analytic functions of\n$m^2$. We show that the constraints lead to a correct counting of degrees of\nfreedom if nonminimal terms are included with fine tuned coefficients and the\nbackground space is of the Einstein type, very much like the Fierz-Pauli case.\nWe also examine the existence of local symmetries.\n", "  The relaxation rate of a Maxwellian velocity distribution function that has\nan initially anisotropic temperature $(T_\\parallel \\neq T_\\perp)$ is an\nimportant physical process in space and laboratory plasmas. It is also a\ncanonical example of an energy transport process that can be used to test\ntheory. Here, this rate is evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations of\nthe one-component plasma. Results are compared with the predictions of four\nkinetic theories; two treating the weakly coupled regime (1) the Landau\nequation, and (2) the Lenard-Balescu equation, and two that attempt to extend\nthe theory into the strongly coupled regime (3) the effective potential theory\nand (4) the generalized Lenard-Balescu theory. The role of dynamic screening is\nstudied, and is found to have a negligible influence on this transport rate.\nOscillations and a delayed relaxation onset in the temperature profiles are\nobserved at strong coupling, which are not described by the kinetic theories.\n", "  To explore large-scale population indoor interactions, we analyze 18,715\nusers' WiFi access logs recorded in a Chinese university campus during 3\nmonths, and define two categories of human interactions, the event interaction\n(EI) and the temporal interaction (TI). The EI helps construct a transmission\ngraph, and the TI helps build an interval graph. The dynamics of EIs show that\ntheir active durations are truncated power-law distributed, which is\nindependent on the number of involved individuals. The transmission duration\npresents a truncated power-law behavior at the daily timescale with weekly\nperiodicity. Besides, those `leaf' individuals in the aggregated contact\nnetwork may participate in the `super-connecting cliques' in the aggregated\ntransmission graph. Analyzing the dynamics of the interval graph, we find that\nthe probability distribution of TIs' inter-event duration also displays a\ntruncated power-law pattern at the daily timescale with weekly periodicity,\nwhile the pairwise individuals with burst interactions are prone to randomly\nselect their interactive locations, and those individuals with periodic\ninteractions have preferred interactive locations.\n", "  Recently, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN) iPTF15esb at\nredshift $z=0.224$ was reported, whose light curve (LC) and spectrum show\nseveral unusual characteristics. Its late-time spectrum shows a strong, broad\nH$\\alpha $ emission line and the bolometric LC exhibits two peaks and a\npost-peak plateau. Here we propose an ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM)\ninteraction model involving multiple shells and winds to explain this\ndouble-peak SN. We find that the theoretical LC reproduced by this model can\nwell match the observations of iPTF15esb. Based on this result, we infer that\nthe progenitor has undergone at least three violent mass-loss processes before\nthe SN explosion. Furthermore, we find that the masses of the CSM wind and\nshells from the outermost shell (the first eruption) to the innermost wind (the\nfinal eruption) decrease sequentially but their densities increase. The\nvariation trend of the inferred densities of the shells and wind is consistent\nwith the stellar structure before an SN explosion. Further investigations for\nsimilar SLSNe would provide a probe for the mass-loss history of their\nprogenitors.\n", "  A system-level framework of complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe chemical\ncross-talk would help elucidate the role of our gut microbiota in health and\ndisease. Here we report a literature-curated interspecies network of the human\ngut microbiota, called NJS16. This is an extensive data resource composed of\n~570 microbial species and 3 human cell types metabolically interacting through\n>4,400 small-molecule transport and macromolecule degradation events. Based on\nthe contents of our network, we develop a mathematical approach to elucidate\nrepresentative microbial and metabolic features of the gut microbial community\nin a given population, such as a disease cohort. Applying this strategy to\nmicrobiome data from type 2 diabetes patients reveals a context-specific\ninfrastructure of the gut microbial ecosystem, core microbial entities with\nlarge metabolic influence, and frequently-produced metabolic compounds that\nmight indicate relevant community metabolic processes. Our network presents a\nfoundation towards integrative investigations of community-scale microbial\nactivities within the human gut.\n", "  CrCl3 is a layered insulator that undergoes a crystallographic phase\ntransition below room temperature and orders antiferromagnetically at low\ntemperature. Weak van der Waals bonding between the layers and ferromagnetic\nin-plane magnetic order make it a promising material for obtaining atomically\nthin magnets and creating van der Waals heterostructures. In this work we have\ngrown crystals of CrCl3, revisited the structural and thermodynamic properties\nof the bulk material, and explored mechanical exfoliation of the crystals. We\nfind two distinct anomalies in the heat capacity at 14 and 17 K confirming that\nthe magnetic order develops in two stages on cooling, with ferromagnetic\ncorrelations forming before long range antiferromagnetic order develops between\nthem. This scenario is supported by magnetization data. A magnetic phase\ndiagram is constructed from the heat capacity and magnetization results. We\nalso find an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the crystallographic\nphase transition, indicating some coupling between the magnetism and the\nlattice. First principles calculations accounting for van der Waals\ninteractions also indicate spin-lattice coupling, and find multiple nearly\ndegenerate crystallographic and magnetic structures consistent with the\nexperimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate that monolayer and few-layer\nCrCl3 specimens can be produced from the bulk crystals by exfoliation,\nproviding a path for the study of heterostructures and magnetism in ultrathin\ncrystals down to the monolayer limit.\n", "  We propose a new approach in studying the planetary orbits and the perihelion\nprecession in General Relativity by means of the Homotopy Perturbation Method\n(HPM).For this purpose, we give a brief review of the nonlinear geodesic\nequations in the spherical symmetry spacetime which are to be studied in our\nwork. On the basis of the main idea of HPM, we construct the appropriate\nhomotopy what leads to the problem of solving the set of linear equations.\nFirst of all, we consider the simple example of the Schwarzschild metric for\nwhich the approximate geodesics solutions are known, in order to compare the\nHPM solution for orbits with those obtained earlier. Moreover, we obtain an\napproximate HPM solution for the Reissner-Nordstorm spacetime of a charged\nstar.\n", "  Within the Ontological Models Framework (OMF), Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph\n(PBR) have given an argument by which they claimed that the epistemic view on\nthe wavefunction should be ruled out. This study highlights an incorrect\nconclusion in PBR's arguments, which was made due to inadequacies in the\ndefinitions of OMF. To be precise, OMF models the ontology of the preparation\nprocedure, but it does not model the ontology of the measurement device. Such\nan asymmetric treatment becomes problematic, in scenarios in which measurement\ndevices have a quantum nature. Modifying the OMF's definition such that the\nontology of the measurement device becomes included, we will see how PBR's\nresult disappears.\n", "  Antihydrogen is at the forefront of antimatter research at the CERN\nAntiproton Decelerator. Experiments aiming to test the fundamental CPT symmetry\nand antigravity effects require the efficient detection of antihydrogen\nannihilation events, which is performed using highly granular tracking\ndetectors installed around an antimatter trap. Improving the efficiency of the\nantihydrogen annihilation detection plays a central role in the final\nsensitivity of the experiments. We propose deep learning as a novel technique\nto analyze antihydrogen annihilation data, and compare its performance with a\ntraditional track and vertex reconstruction method. We report that the deep\nlearning approach yields significant improvement, tripling event coverage while\nsimultaneously improving performance by over 5% in terms of Area Under Curve\n(AUC).\n", "  The autoignition delays of iso-butanol, oxygen, and nitrogen mixtures have\nbeen measured in a heated rapid compression machine (RCM). At compressed\npressures of 15 and 30 bar, over the temperature range 800-950 K, and for\nequivalence ratio of $\\phi$ = 0.5 in air, no evidence of an NTC region of\noverall ignition delay is found. By comparing the data from this study taken at\n$\\phi$ = 0.5 to previous data collected at $\\phi$ = 1.0 (Weber et al. 2013), it\nwas found that the $\\phi$ = 0.5 mixture was less reactive (as measured by the\ninverse of the ignition delay) than the $\\phi$ = 1.0 mixture for the same\ncompressed pressure. Furthermore, a recent chemical kinetic model of\niso-butanol combustion was updated using the automated software Reaction\nMechanism Generator (RMG) to include low- temperature chain branching pathways.\nComparison of the ignition delays with the updated model showed reasonable\nagreement for most of the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, further work\nis needed to fully understand the low temperature pathways that control\niso-butanol autoignition in the RCM.\n", "  The autoignition delays of mixtures of methyl-cyclohexane (MCH), oxygen,\nnitrogen, and argon have been studied in a heated rapid compression machine\nunder the conditions $P_C$ = 50 bar, $T_C$ = 690 - 910K. Three different\nmixture compositions were studied, with equivalence ratios ranging from $\\phi$\n= 0.5 - 1.5. The trends of the ignition delay measured at 50 bar were similar\nto the trends measured in earlier experiments at $P_C$ = 15.1 and 25.5 bar. The\nexperimentally measured ignition delays were compared to a newly updated\nchemical kinetic model for the combustion of MCH. The model has been updated to\ninclude newly calculated reaction rates for much of the low-temperature\nchemistry. The agreement between the experiments and the model was\nsubstantially improved compared to a previous version of the model.\nNevertheless, despite the encouraging improvements, work continues on further\nadvances, e.g. in improving predictions of the first stage ignition delays.\n", "  Investigation of the autoignition delay of the butanol isomers has been\nperformed at elevated pressure of 15 bar and low to intermediate temperatures\nof 725-870 K. Stoichiometric mixtures made in nitrogen/oxygen air were studied.\nFor the temperature and pressure conditions in this study, no NTC or two-stage\nignition behavior were observed. The reactivity of the isomers of butanol, in\nterms of inverse ignition delay, was ranked as n-butanol > sec-butanol ~\niso-butanol > tert-butanol. Predictions of the ignition delay by several\nkinetic mechanisms available in the literature generally over-predict the\nignition delays.\n", "  Autoignition delay experiments for the isomers of butanol, including n-,\nsec-, tert-, and iso-butanol, have been performed using a heated rapid\ncompression machine. For a compressed pressure of 15 bar, the compressed\ntemperatures have been varied in the range of 725-855 K for all the\nstoichiometric fuel/oxidizer mixtures. Over the conditions investigated in this\nstudy, the ignition delay decreases monotonically as temperature increases and\nexhibits single-stage characteristics. Experimental ignition delays are also\ncompared to simulations computed using three kinetic mechanisms available in\nthe literature. Reasonable agreement is found for three isomers (tert-, iso-,\nand n-butanol).\n", "  Combining material informatics and high-throughput electronic structure\ncalculations offers the possibility of a rapid characterization of complex\nmagnetic materials. Here we demonstrate that datasets of electronic properties\ncalculated at the ab initio level can be effectively used to identify and\nunderstand physical trends in magnetic materials, thus opening new avenues for\naccelerated materials discovery. Following a data-centric approach, we utilize\na database of Heusler alloys calculated at the density functional theory level\nto identify the ideal ions neighbouring Fe in the $X_2$Fe$Z$ Heusler prototype.\nThe hybridization of Fe with the nearest neighbour $X$ ion is found to cause\nredistribution of the on-site Fe charge and a net increase of its magnetic\nmoment proportional to the valence of $X$. Thus, late transition metals are\nideal Fe neighbours for producing high-moment Fe-based Heusler magnets. At the\nsame time a thermodynamic stability analysis is found to restrict $Z$ to main\ngroup elements. Machine learning regressors, trained to predict magnetic moment\nand volume of Heusler alloys, are used to determine the magnetization for all\nmaterials belonging to the proposed prototype. We find that Co$_2$Fe$Z$ alloys,\nand in particular Co$_2$FeSi, maximize the magnetization, which reaches values\nup to 1.2T. This is in good agreement with both ab initio and experimental\ndata. Furthermore, we identify the Cu$_2$Fe$Z$ family to be a cost-effective\nmaterials class, offering a magnetization of approximately 0.65T.\n", "  Investigation of the autoignition delay of the butanol isomers has been\nperformed at elevated pressures of 15 bar and 30 bar and low to intermediate\ntemperatures of 680-860 K. The reactivity of the stoichiometric isomers of\nbutanol, in terms of inverse ignition delay, was ranked as n-butanol >\nsec-butanol ~ iso-butanol > tert-butanol at a compressed pressure of 15 bar but\nchanged to n-butanol > tert-butanol > sec-butanol > iso-butanol at 30 bar. For\nthe temperature and pressure conditions in this study, no NTC or two-stage\nignition behavior were observed. However, for both of the compressed pressures\nstudied in this work, tert-butanol exhibited unique pre-ignition heat release\ncharacteristics. As such, tert-butanol was further studied at two additional\nequivalence ratios ($\\phi$ = 0.5 and 2.0) to help determine the cause of the\nheat release.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the crystal structure of the thin-film,\nferromagnetic topological insulator (Bi, Sb)$_{2-x}$V$_x$Te$_3$. The\ndissipationless quantum anomalous Hall edge states it manifests are of\nparticular interest for spintronics, as a natural spin filter or pure spin\nsource, and as qubits for topological quantum computing. For ranges typically\nused in experiments, we investigate the effect of doping, substrate choice and\nfilm thickness on the (Bi, Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ unit cell using high-resolution X-ray\ndiffractometry. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy measurements provide local structural and interfacial\ninformation. We find that the unit cell is unaffected in-plane by vanadium\ndoping changes, and remains unchanged over a thickness range of 4--10 quintuple\nlayers (1 QL $\\approx$ 1 nm). The in-plane lattice parameter ($a$) also remains\nthe same in films grown on different substrate materials. However, out-of-plane\nthe $c$-axis is reduced in films grown on less closely lattice-matched\nsubstrates, and increases with the doping level.\n", "  This paper presents an alternate form for the dynamic modelling of a\nmechanical system that simulates in real life a gantry crane type, using\nEuler's classical mechanics and Lagrange formalism, which allows find the\nequations of motion that our model describe. Moreover, it has a basic model\ndesign system using the SolidWorks software, based on the material and\ndimensions of the model provides some physical variables necessary for\nmodelling. In order to verify the theoretical results obtained, a contrast was\nmade between solutions obtained by simulation in SimMechanics-Matlab and\nEuler-Lagrange equations system, has been solved through Matlab libraries for\nsolving equation's systems of the type and order obtained. The force is\ndetermined, but not as exerted by the spring, as this will be the control\nvariable. The objective to bring the mass of the pendulum from one point to\nanother with a specified distance without the oscillation from it, so that, the\nanswer is overdamped. This article includes an analysis of PID control in which\nthe equations of motion of Euler-Lagrange are rewritten in the state space,\nonce there, they were implemented in Simulink to get the natural response of\nthe system to a step input in F and then draw the desired trajectories.\n", "  We explore consequences for the solar dynamo of a newly-developed physical\nhypothesis describing a weak coupling of the orbital and rotational motions of\nextended bodies. The coupling is given by - c ((dL/dt) x omega sub alpha) x r,\nwhere dL/dt represents the rate of change of barycentric orbital angular\nmomentum, omega sub alpha is the angular velocity of rotation, r is a position\nvector identifying a particular location in a coordinate system rotating with\nthe Sun, and c is a coupling efficiency coefficient. This form of coupling has\nno dependence on tides. The coupling expression defines a non-axisymmetric\nglobal-scale acceleration field that varies both in space and with time.\nMeridional components of acceleration typically dominate in equatorial and\nmiddle latitudes, while zonal accelerations become increasingly significant at\nhigher latitudes. A comparison of the waveform of the putative dynamical\nforcing function with the time series for measured solar meridional flow speeds\nfrom Sunspot Cycle 23 yields correlations significant at the 99.9% level. We\nintroduce the possibility of a destructive interaction between the predicted\nlarge-scale flows (due to orbit-spin coupling) and the dynamo mechanism(s) of\nthe 22-year magnetic activity cycle; observations in recent cycles of higher\nmeridional flow speeds during episodes of reduced solar sunspot activity may be\nexplained as a consequence of differences between the phasing of the magnetic\ncycle and the phase of the forcing function. Algorithms are provided for\ncalculating meridional and zonal orbit-spin coupling accelerations within the\nSun as a function of latitude, longitude, depth, and time.\n", "  This is the first of three papers that present a detailed guide for working\nwith the codes {\\sc tlusty} and {\\sc synspec} to generate model stellar\natmospheres or accretion disks, and to produce detailed synthetic spectra. In\nthis paper, we present a very brief manual intended for casual users who intend\nto use these codes for simple, well defined tasks. This paper does not present\nany background theory, or a description of the adopted numerical approaches,\nbut instead uses simple examples to explain how to employ these codes. In\nparticular, it shows how to produce a simple model atmosphere from the scratch,\nor how to improve an existing model by considering more extended model atoms.\nThis paper also presents a brief guide to the spectrum synthesis program {\\sc\nsynspec}.\n", "  Conventional computers are ill suited to run CA models, and so discourage\ntheir development. By creating a hardware platform that makes a broad range of\nnew CA algorithms practical for real applications, we hope to whet the appetite\nof researchers for the astronomical computing power that can be harnessed in\nmicrophysics in a CA format.\n", "  The results of an analysis of turbulent pipe flow based on a Karhunen-Lo`eve\ndecomposition are presented. The turbulent flow is generated by a direct\nnumerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations using a spectral element\nalgorithm at a Reynolds number Re_\\tau=150. This simulation yields a set of\nbasis functions that captures 90% of the energy after 2,453 modes. The\neigenfunctions are categorised into two classes and six subclasses based on\ntheir wavenumber and coherent vorticity structure. Of the total energy, 81% is\nin the propagating class, characterised by constant phase speeds; the remaining\nenergy is found in the non propagating subclasses, the shear and roll modes.\nThe four subclasses of the propagating modes are the wall, lift, asymmetric,\nand ring modes. The wall modes display coherent vorticity structures near the\nwall, the lift modes display coherent vorticity structures that lift away from\nthe wall, the asymmetric modes break the symmetry about the axis, and the ring\nmodes display rings of coherent vorticity. Together, the propagating modes form\na wave packet, as found from a circular normal speed locus. The energy transfer\nmechanism in the flow is a four step process. The process begins with energy\nbeing transferred from mean flow to the shear modes, then to the roll modes.\nEnergy is then transfer ed from the roll modes to the wall modes, and then\neventually to the lift modes. The ring and asymmetric modes act as catalysts\nthat aid in this four step energy transfer. Physically, this mechanism shows\nhow the energy in the flow starts at the wall and then propagates into the\nouter layer.\n"]}
