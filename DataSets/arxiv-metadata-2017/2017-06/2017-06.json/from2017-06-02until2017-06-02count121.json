These commutative relations correspond to the intrinsic symmetry of\nthe physical system, which are equivalent to the original partial differential\nequation can be solved by separation of variables. Detailed calculation shows\nthat, only a few cases can be completely solved by separation of variables. In\ngeneral cases, we have to solve the Dirac equation and Schr\\\"odinger equation\nby effective perturbation or approximation methods, especially in the cases\nincluding nonlinear potential or self interactive potentials.\n", "  We study a class of graph Hamiltonians given by a type of quiver\nrepresentation to which we can associate (non)--commutative geometries. By\nselecting gauging data these geometries are realized by matrices through an\nexplicit construction or a Kan-extension. We describe the changes in gauge via\nthe action of a regauging groupoid. It acts via matrices that give rise to a\nnoncommutative 2--cocycle and hence to a groupoid extension (gerbe).\n  We furthermore show that automorphisms of the underlying graph of the quiver\ncan be lifted to extended symmetry groups of regaugings. In the commutative\ncase, we deduce that the extended symmetries act via a projective\nrepresentation. This yields isotypical decompositions and super--selection\nrules.\n  We apply these results to the PDG and honeycomb wire--networks using\nrepresentation theory for projective groups and show that all the degeneracies\nin the spectra are consequences of these enhanced symmetries. This includes the\nDirac points of the G(yroid) and the honeycomb systems.\n", "  In this paper we give a new foundational, categorical formulation for\noperations and relations and objects parameterizing them. This generalizes and\nunifies the theory of operads and all their cousins including but not limited\nto PROPs, modular operads, twisted (modular) operads, properads, hyperoperads,\ntheir colored versions, as well as algebras over operads and an abundance of\nother related structures, such as crossed simplicial groups, the augmented\nsimplicial category or FI--modules.\n  The usefulness of this approach is that it allows us to handle all the\nclassical as well as more esoteric structures under a common framework and we\ncan treat all the situations simultaneously. Many of the known constructions\nsimply become Kan extensions.\n  In this common framework, we also derive universal operations, such as those\nunderlying Deligne's conjecture, construct Hopf algebras as well as perform\nresolutions, (co)bar transforms and Feynman transforms which are related to\nmaster equations. For these applications, we construct the relevant model\ncategory structures. This produces many new examples.\n", "  In this work, we consider systems that are subjected to intermittent\ninstabilities due to external stochastic excitation. These intermittent\ninstabilities, though rare, have a large impact on the probabilistic response\nof the system and give rise to heavy-tailed probability distributions. By\nmaking appropriate assumptions on the form of these instabilities, which are\nvalid for a broad range of systems, we formulate a method for the analytical\napproximation of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the system\nresponse (both the main probability mass and the heavy-tail structure). In\nparticular, this method relies on conditioning the probability density of the\nresponse on the occurrence of an instability and the separate analysis of the\ntwo states of the system, the unstable and stable state. In the stable regime\nwe employ steady state assumptions, which lead to the derivation of the\nconditional response pdf using standard methods for random dynamical systems.\nThe unstable regime is inherently transient and in order to analyze this regime\nwe characterize the statistics under the assumption of an exponential growth\nphase and a subsequent decay phase until the system is brought back to the\nstable attractor. The method we present allows us to capture the statistics\nassociated with the dynamics that give rise to heavy-tails in the system\nresponse and the analytical approximations compare favorably with direct Monte\nCarlo simulations, which we illustrate for two prototype intermittent systems:\nan intermittently unstable mechanical oscillator excited by correlated\nmultiplicative noise and a complex mode in a turbulent signal with fixed\nfrequency, where multiplicative stochastic damping and additive noise model\ninteractions between various modes.\n", "  Based on Clauser-Horner-Shimony-Holt inequality, we show a fruitful method to\nexploit Bell inequalities for multipartite qubit systems. These Bell\ninequalities are designed with a simpler architecture tailored to experimental\ndemonstration. Under the optimal setting we derive a set of compact Mermin-type\ninequalities and discuss quantum violations for generalized\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GGHZ) states. Also, we reveal relationship between\nquantum nonlocality and four-partite entanglement for four-qubit GGHZ states.\n", "  We investigate new physics effects on the Wtb effective couplings in a\nmodel-independent manner. The new physics effects are summarized as four\nindependent couplings $f_1^L$, $f_1^R$, $f_2^L$ and $f_2^R$. Using\nsingle-top-quark productions and W-helicity fraction measurements at the LHC\nand Tevatron, we perform a global fit to impose constraints on top quark\neffective couplings. We introduce a set of parameters $x_0$, $x_m$, $x_p$ and\n$x_5$ to study the correlations among Wtb effective couplings. We show that (i)\nimproving the measurements of $\\sigma_t$ and $\\sigma_{tW}$ is important in\nconstraining the correlation of $(f_1^R,f_2^R)$ and $(f_2^L,f_2^R)$; (ii)\n$f_1^L$ and $f_2^R$ are anti-correlated, which is sensitive to all the\nexperiments; (iii) $f_1^R$ and $f_2^L$ are also anti-correlated, which is\nsensitive to the W-helicity measurements; (iv) the correlation between $f_2^L$\nand $f_2^R$ is sensitive to the precision of $\\sigma_t$, $\\sigma_{tW}$ and\n$F_0$ measurements. The effective Wtb couplings are studied in three kinds of\nnew physics models: $SU(2)_1 \\times SU(2)_2 \\times U(1)_X$ models, vector-like\nquark models and Littlest Higgs model with and without T-parity. The Wtb\ncouplings in the left-right model and the un-unified model are sensitive to the\nratio of gauge couplings when the new heavy gauge boson's mass ($M_{W'}$) is\nless than several hundred GeV, but the constraint is loose if $M_{W'}>1$ TeV.\nThe Wtb couplings in vector-like quark models and the Littlest Higgs models are\nsensitive to the mixing angles of new heavy particles and SM particles. We also\ninclude the constraints of the oblique T-parameter and Zbb couplings which\nimpose much tighter constraints on the mixing angles. We show that the Wtb\ncoupling constraints become relevant if the precision of single top production\ncross section measurements could be reduced to 1\\% relative to the SM\npredictions in future.\n", "  Polytropic transonic solutions of spherically symmetric and steady galactic\nwinds in the gravitational potential of a dark matter halo (DMH) with a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are studied. The solutions are classified in\nterms of their topological features, and the gravitational potential of the\nSMBH adds a new branch to the transonic solutions generated by the gravity of\nthe DMH. The topological types of the transonic solutions depend on the mass\ndistribution, the amount of supplied energy, the polytropic index $\\gamma$, and\nthe slope $\\alpha$ of the DMH mass distribution. When $\\alpha$ becomes larger\nthan a critical value $\\alpha_\\mathrm{c}$, the transonic solution types change\ndramatically. Further, our model predicts that it is possible for a slowly\naccelerating outflow to exist, even in quiescent galaxies with small $\\gamma$.\nThis slowly accelerating outflow differs from those considered in many of the\nprevious studies focusing on supersonic outflows in active star-forming\ngalaxies. In addition, our model indicates that outflows in active star-forming\ngalaxies have only one transonic point in the inner region ($\\sim$ 0.01 kpc).\nThe locus of this transonic point does not strongly depend on $\\gamma$. We\napply the polytropic model incorporating mass flux supplied by stellar\ncomponents to the Sombrero Galaxy, and conclude that it can reproduce the\nobserved gas density and the temperature distribution well. This result differs\nsignificantly from the isothermal model, which requires an unrealistically\nlarge mass flux (Igarashi et al. 2014). Thus, we conclude that the polytropic\nmodel is more realistic than the isothermal model, and that the Sombrero Galaxy\ncan have a slowly accelerating outflow.\n", "  The first combined experimental and theoretical studies of dust\nremobilization by plasma forces are reported. The main theoretical aspects of\nremobilization in fusion devices under steady state conditions are analyzed. In\nparticular, the dominant role of adhesive forces is highlighted and generic\nremobilization conditions - direct lift-up, sliding, rolling - are formulated.\nA novel experimental technique is proposed, based on controlled adhesion of\ndust grains on tungsten samples combined with detailed mapping of the dust\ndeposition profile prior and post plasma exposure. Proof-of-principle\nexperiments in the TEXTOR tokamak and the EXTRAP-T2R reversed-field pinch are\npresented. The versatile environment of the linear device Pilot-PSI allowed for\nexperiments with different magnetic field topologies and varying plasma\nconditions that were complemented with camera observations.\n", "  We propose a fruitful scheme for exploring multiphoton entangled states based\non linear optics and weak nonlinearities. Compared with the previous schemes\nthe present method is more feasible because there are only small phase shifts\ninstead of a series of related functions of photon numbers in the process of\ninteraction with Kerr nonlinearities. In the absence of decoherence we analyze\nthe error probabilities induced by homodyne measurement and show that the\nmaximal error probability can be made small enough even when the number of\nphotons is large. This implies that the present scheme is quite tractable and\nit is possible to produce entangled states involving a large number of photons.\n", "  We show that the semi-classical analysis of generic Euclidean path integrals\nnecessarily requires complexification of the action and measure, and\nconsideration of complex saddle solutions. We demonstrate that complex saddle\npoints have a natural interpretation in terms of the Picard-Lefschetz theory.\nMotivated in part by the semi-classical expansion of QCD with adjoint matter on\n${\\mathbb R}^3\\times S^1$, we study quantum-mechanical systems with bosonic and\nfermionic (Grassmann) degrees of freedom with harmonic degenerate minima, as\nwell as (related) purely bosonic systems with harmonic non-degenerate minima.\nWe find exact finite action non-BPS bounce and bion solutions to the\nholomorphic Newton equations. We find not only real solutions, but also complex\nsolution with non-trivial monodromy, and finally complex multi-valued and\nsingular solutions. Complex bions are necessary for obtaining the correct\nnon-perturbative structure of these models. In the supersymmetric limit the\ncomplex solutions govern the ground state properties, and their contribution to\nthe semiclassical expansion is necessary to obtain consistency with the\nsupersymmetry algebra. The multi-valuedness of the action is either related to\nthe hidden topological angle or to the resurgent cancellation of ambiguities.\nWe also show that in the approximate multi-instanton description the\nintegration over the complex quasi-zero mode thimble produces the most salient\nfeatures of the exact solutions. While exact complex saddles are more difficult\nto construct in quantum field theory, the relation to the approximate thimble\nconstruction suggests that such solutions may be underlying some remarkable\nfeatures of approximate bion saddles in quantum field theories.\n", "  Recently it was proposed that asymptotically flat spacetimes have a\nholographic dual which is an ultra-relativistic conformal field theory. In this\npaper, we obtain the conformal anomaly for such a theory via the flat-space\nholography technique. Furthermore, using flat-space holography we obtain a\nC-function for this theory which is monotonically decreasing from the UV to the\nIR by employing the null energy condition in the bulk.\n", "  We consider the problem of probabilistic quantification of dynamical systems\nthat have heavy-tailed characteristics. These heavy-tailed features are\nassociated with rare transient responses due to the occurrence of internal\ninstabilities. Here we develop a computational method, a probabilistic\ndecomposition-synthesis technique, that takes into account the nature of\ninternal instabilities to inexpensively determine the non-Gaussian probability\ndensity function for any arbitrary quantity of interest. Our approach relies on\nthe decomposition of the statistics into a `non-extreme core', typically\nGaussian, and a heavy-tailed component. This decomposition is in full\ncorrespondence with a partition of the phase space into a `stable' region where\nwe have no internal instabilities, and a region where non-linear instabilities\nlead to rare transitions with high probability. We quantify the statistics in\nthe stable region using a Gaussian approximation approach, while the\nnon-Gaussian distributions associated with the intermittently unstable regions\nof the phase space are inexpensively computed through order-reduction methods\nthat take into account the strongly nonlinear character of the dynamics. The\nprobabilistic information in the two domains is analytically synthesized\nthrough a total probability argument. The proposed approach allows for the\naccurate quantification of non-Gaussian tails at more than 10 standard\ndeviations, at a fraction of the cost associated with the direct Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. We demonstrate the probabilistic decomposition-synthesis method\nfor rare events for two dynamical systems exhibiting extreme events: a\ntwo-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, and in a\nnonlinear envelope equation characterizing the propagation of unidirectional\nwater waves.\n", "  The sequence of amino acid monomers in the primary structure of a protein is\ndecided by the corresponding sequence of codons (triplets of nucleic acid\nmonomers) on the template messenger RNA (mRNA). The polymerization of a\nprotein, by incorporation of the successive amino acid monomers, is carried out\nby a molecular machine called ribosome. We develop a stochastic kinetic model\nthat captures the possibilities of mis-reading of mRNA codon and prior\nmis-charging of a tRNA. By a combination of analytical and numerical methods we\nobtain the distribution of the times taken for incorporation of the successive\namino acids in the growing protein in this mathematical model. The\ncorresponding exact analytical expression for the average rate of elongation of\na nascent protein is a `biologically motivated' generalization of the {\\it\nMichaelis-Menten formula} for the average rate of enzymatic reactions. This\ngeneralized Michaelis-Menten-like formula (and the exact analytical expressions\nfor a few other quantities) that we report here display the interplay of four\ndifferent branched pathways corresponding to selection of four different types\nof tRNA.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of an atomic mixture composed of two\nmulti-atom ensembles. Each ensemble is driven separately by a coherent laser\nfield, respectively, and dampens via the interactions with the environmental\nvacuum electromagnetic field reservoir. We find that, due to the photon\nexchange among the two components, long-time excitation oscillations appear,\nwhich may be significantly longer than the inverse lifetime of a single\nemitter. Furthermore, few-atom \"jumps\" to the excited state occur as a function\nof the parameter characterizing the inter-component interactions around a\ncertain working point.\n", "  We exploit quantum discord to detect quantum correlations for two-state\nMarkov binary, which has broad of applications in quantum information theory.\nTo calculate the correlation in Markov-binary, We wrote a transition matrix\nelements based on orthogonal states, the computational results show oscillatory\nbehavior in terms of the relevant variables. According to the results, when we\nhave maximum quantum information, quantum discord reaches its minimum.\n", "  The treatment of the number-theoretical problem of integer partitions within\nthe approach of statistical mechanics is discussed. Historical overview is\ngiven and known asymptotic results for linear and plane partitions are\nreproduced. From numerical analysis of restricted plane partitions an\nasymptotic formula is conjectured for an intermediate number of parts.\n", "  We introduce a 3-parameter class of maps acting on a bipartite system that\nare a natural generalisation of the depolarizing channel (and include it as a\nspecial case). Then, we find the exact regions of the parameter space that\nalternatively determine a positive, completely positive, entanglement-breaking\nor entanglement-annihilating map. This model displays a much richer behaviour\nthan the one shown by a simple depolarizing channel, yet it stays exactly\nsolvable. As an example of this richness, PPT but not entanglement-breaking\nmaps are found. A simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is\nprovided. Then, the study of the entanglement-annihilating property is fully\naddressed. Finally, we apply our results to solve the problem of the\nentanglement annihilation caused in a bipartite system by a tensor product of\nlocal depolarizing channels. In this context, a conjecture recently posed in\nthe literature is proven, and many related open questions are answered. To\narrive at this result we furthermore show how the Hadamard product between\nquantum states can be implemented via local operations.\n", "  The influence of spacetime foam on a broad class of bosonic fields with\narbitrary numbers of particles in the low energy regime is investigated. Based\non recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitational\nsystems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, and\ngravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to their\nmean frequencies. For the long time propagation, the Markov approximation is\nemployed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. In\nthis case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from the\nnoisy spacetime, we show that such phenomena turn out to be completely\nsuppressed for scalar bosons, photons, and gravitons, which are coupled to\ngravity but otherwise free. The short time effects are then recovered through\nthe transient non-Markovian evolution. Focusing on scalar bosons in initially\nincoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation depend\nstrongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. We further\nidentify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for a\nlarge number of particles. The surprising new effect tends to \"bundle\"\nidentical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a width\ninversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations,\nor its square root due to the vacuum fluctuations of spacetime.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagram of a three-dimensional, time-reversal\nsymmetric topological superconductor in the presence of charge impurities and\nrandom $s$-wave pairing. Combining complimentary field theoretic and numerical\nmethods, we show that the quantum phase transition between two topologically\ndistinct paired states (or thermal insulators), described by thermal Dirac\nsemimetal, remains unaffected in the presence of sufficiently weak generic\nrandomness. At stronger disorder, however, these two phases are separated by an\nintervening thermal metallic phase of diffusive Majorana fermions. We show that\nacross the insulator-insulator and metal-insulator transitions, normalized\nthermal conductance displays single parameter scaling, allowing us to\nnumerically extract the critical exponents across them. The pertinence of our\nstudy in strong spin-orbit coupled, three-dimensional doped narrow gap\nsemiconductors, such as Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, is discussed.\n", "  Motivated by quantum mechanical corrections to the Newtonian potential, which\ncan be translated into an $\\hbar$-correction to the $g_{00}$ component of the\nSchwarzschild metric, we construct a quantum mechanically corrected metric\nassuming $-g_{00}=g^{rr}$. We show how the Bekenstein black hole entropy $S$\nreceives its logarithmic contribution provided the quantum mechanical\ncorrections to the metric are negative. In this case the standard horizon at\nthe Schwarzschild radius $r_S$ increases by small terms proportional to $\\hbar$\nand a remnant of the order of Planck mass emerges. We contrast these results\nwith a positive correction to the metric which, apart from a corrected\nSchwarzschild horizon, leads to a new purely quantum mechanical horizon.\n", "  In previous works we examined the spectra for systems of 2 protons and 2\nneutrons, in a single j shell calculation, by obtaining matrix elements from\nexperiment. More recently we considered schematic interactions in the same\nmodel space. We continue in this vein here. The present work and the former can\nbe regarded as 2 bookends on a bookshelf.\n", "  We calculate the $gg\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ amplitude by including the $t\\bar t$\nbound-state effects near their mass threshold. In terms of the non-relativistic\nexpansion of the amplitude, the LO contribution is an energy-independent term\nin the one-loop amplitude. We include the NLO contribution described by the\nnon-relativistic Green function and part of the NNLO contribution. Despite a\nmissing NLO piece which can be accomplished with the two-loop-level amplitude\nvia massive quarks, the shape of the diphoton mass spectrum is predicted with a\ngood accuracy. Thanks to the simple and clean nature of the observable, its\nexperimental measurement can be a direct method to determine the short-distance\nmass of the top quark at hadron colliders.\n", "  The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach based on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is one\nof the most promising and viable numerical tools to study turbulent dispersed\nflows when the computational cost of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) becomes\ntoo expensive. The applicability of this approach is however limited if the\neffects of the Sub-Grid Scales (SGS) of the flow on particle dynamics are\nneglected. In this paper, we propose to take these effects into account by\nmeans of a Lagrangian stochastic SGS model for the equations of particle\nmotion. The model extends to particle-laden flows the velocity-filtered density\nfunction method originally developed for reactive flows. The underlying\nfiltered density function is simulated through a Lagrangian Monte Carlo\nprocedure that solves for a set of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)\nalong individual particle trajectories. The resulting model is tested for the\nreference case of turbulent channel flow, using a hybrid algorithm in which the\nfluid velocity field is provided by LES and then used to advance the SDEs in\ntime. The model consistency is assessed in the limit of particles with zero\ninertia, when \"duplicate fields\" are available from both the Eulerian LES and\nthe Lagrangian tracking. Tests with inertial particles were performed to\nexamine the capability of the model to capture particle preferential\nconcentration and near-wall segregation. Upon comparison with DNS-based\nstatistics, our results show improved accuracy and considerably reduced errors\nwith respect to the case in which no SGS model is used in the equations of\nparticle motion.\n", "  We describe a simple and fast algorithm for identifying friends-of-friends\nfeatures and prove its correctness. The algorithm avoids unnecessary expensive\nneighbor queries, uses minimal memory overhead, and rejects slowdown in high\nover-density regions. We define our algorithm formally based on pair\nenumeration, a problem that has been heavily studied in fast 2-point\ncorrelation codes and our reference implementation employs a dual KD-tree\ncorrelation function code. We construct features in a hierarchical tree\nstructure, and use a splay operation to reduce the average cost of identifying\nthe root of a feature from $O[\\log L]$ to $O[1]$ ($L$ is the size of a feature)\nwithout additional memory costs. This reduces the overall time complexity of\nmerging trees from $O[L\\log L]$ to $O[L]$, reducing the number of operations\nper splay by orders of magnitude. We next introduce a pruning operation that\nskips merge operations between two fully self-connected KD-tree nodes. This\nimproves the robustness of the algorithm, reducing the number of merge\noperations in high density peaks from $O[\\delta^2]$ to $O[\\delta]$. We show\nthat for cosmological data set the algorithm eliminates more than half of merge\noperations for typically used linking lengths $b \\sim 0.2$ (relative to mean\nseparation). Furthermore, our algorithm is extremely simple and easy to\nimplement on top of an existing pair enumeration code, reusing the optimization\neffort that has been invested in fast correlation function codes.\n", "  We show that self-consistent partial synchrony in globally coupled\noscillatory ensembles is a general phenomenon. We analyze in detail appearance\nand stability properties of this state in possibly the simplest setup of a\nbiharmonic Kuramoto-Daido phase model as well as demonstrate the effect in\nlimit-cycle relaxational Rayleigh oscillators. Such a regime extends the notion\nof splay state from a uniform to distribution of phases to an oscillating one.\nSuitable collective observables such as the Kuramoto order parameter allow\ndetecting the presence of a inhomogeneous distribution. The characteristic and\nmost peculiar property of partial synchrony is the difference between the\nfrequencies of single units and that of the macroscopic field.\n", "  We present the results of the first IceCube search for dark matter\nannihilation in the center of the Earth. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles\n(WIMPs), candidates for dark matter, can scatter off nuclei inside the Earth\nand fall below its escape velocity. Over time the captured WIMPs will be\naccumulated and may eventually self-annihilate. Among the annihilation products\nonly neutrinos can escape from the center of the Earth. Large-scale neutrino\ntelescopes, such as the cubic kilometer IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at\nthe South Pole, can be used to search for such neutrino fluxes.\n  Data from 327 days of detector livetime during 2011/ 2012 were analyzed. No\nexcess beyond the expected background from atmospheric neutrinos was detected.\nThe derived upper limits on the annihilation rate of WIMPs in the Earth and the\nresulting muon flux are an order of magnitude stronger than the limits of the\nlast analysis performed with data from IceCube's predecessor AMANDA. The limits\ncan be translated in terms of a spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section.\nFor a WIMP mass of 50 GeV this analysis results in the most restrictive limits\nachieved with IceCube data.\n", "  We characterize the complex, heavy-tailed probability distribution functions\n(pdf) describing the response and its local extrema for structural systems\nsubjected to random forcing that includes extreme events. Our approach is based\non the recent probabilistic decomposition-synthesis technique, where we\ndecouple rare events regimes from the background fluctuations. The result of\nthe analysis has the form of a semi-analytical approximation formula for the\npdf of the response (displacement, velocity, and acceleration) and the pdf of\nthe local extrema. For special limiting cases (lightly damped or heavily damped\nsystems) our analysis provides fully analytical approximations. We also\ndemonstrate how the method can be applied to high dimensional structural\nsystems through a two-degrees-of-freedom structural system undergoing rare\nevents due to intermittent forcing. The derived formulas can be evaluated with\nvery small computational cost and are shown to accurately capture the\ncomplicated heavy-tailed and asymmetrical features in the probability\ndistribution many standard deviations away from the mean, through comparisons\nwith expensive Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  Recent studies point towards nontriviality of the ergodic phase in systems\nexhibiting many-body localization (MBL), which shows subexponential relaxation\nof local observables, subdiffusive transport and sublinear spreading of the\nentanglement entropy. Here we review the dynamical properties of this phase and\nthe available numerically exact and approximate methods for its study. We\ndiscuss in which sense this phase could be considered ergodic and present\npossible phenomenological explanations of its dynamical properties. We close by\nanalyzing to which extent the proposed explanations were verified by numerical\nstudies and present the open questions in this field.\n", "  Within the framework of Boltzmann equation, we present a $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$\ntheory based study for the low-field mobilities of InSb nanowires (InSb NWs)\nwith relatively large cross sectional sizes (with diameters up to 51.8 nm). For\nsuch type of large size nanowires, the intersubband electron-phonon scattering\nis of crucial importance to affect the scattering rate and then the mobility.\nIn our simulation, the lowest 15 electron subbands and 50 transverse modes of\nphonons are carefully accounted for. We find that, up to the 51.84 nm diameter,\nthe mobility monotonously increases with the diameter, not yet showing any\nsaturated behavior. We also find that, while the bulk InSb mobility is\nconsiderably higher than the bulk Si, the small size (e.g. $\\sim 3$ nm\ndiameter) nanowires from both materials have similar magnitude of mobilities.\nThis implies, importantly, that the mobility of the InSb NWs would decrease\nfaster than the SiNWs as we reduce the cross sectional size of the nanowires.\n", "  Recently, new methods were introduced which allow one to solve ordinary\nintegrals by performing only derivatives. These studies were originally\nmotivated by the difficulties of the quantum field theoretic path integral, and\ncorrespondingly, the results were derived by heuristic methods. Here, we give\nrigorous proofs for the methods to hold on fully specified function spaces. We\nthen illustrate the efficacy of the new methods by applying them to the study\nof the surprising behavior of so-called Borwein integrals.\n", "  A new construction of BPS monodromies for 4d ${\\mathcal N}=2$ theories of\nclass S is introduced. A novel feature of this construction is its manifest\ninvariance under Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing, in the sense that no\ninformation on the 4d BPS spectrum is employed. The BPS monodromy is encoded by\ntopological data of a finite graph, embedded into the UV curve $C$ of the\ntheory. The graph arises from a degenerate limit of spectral networks,\nconstructed at maximal intersections of walls of marginal stability in the\nCoulomb branch of the gauge theory. The topology of the graph, together with a\nnotion of framing, encode equations that determine the monodromy. We develop an\nalgorithmic technique for solving the equations, and compute the monodromy in\nseveral examples. The graph manifestly encodes the symmetries of the monodromy,\nproviding some support for conjectural relations to specializations of the\nsuperconformal index. For $A_1$-type theories, the graphs encoding the\nmonodromy are \"dessins d'enfants\" on $C$, the corresponding Strebel\ndifferentials coincide with the quadratic differentials that characterize the\nSeiberg-Witten curve.\n", "  The pressure-temperature-phase diagram of the new heavy-fermion\nsuperconductor CeAu$_2$Si$_2$ is markedly different from those studied\npreviously. Indeed, superconductivity emerges, not on the verge, but deep\ninside the magnetic phase. In this context, we have carried out ac-calorimetry,\nresistivity and thermoelectric power measurements on a CeAu$_2$Si$_2$-single\ncrystal under high-pressure. The principal novelties of this experiment are the\nobservation of a new transition line, presumably a magnetic structure\nrearrangement at $T_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\mathrm{mod}}$ inside the antiferromagnetic\nphase, and the occurrence of quantum critical behavior in resistivity linked to\nsuperconductivity. Strong non-Fermi-liquid behavior is observed around the\nmaximum of superconductivity and enhanced scattering rates are observed close\nto both the emergence and the maximum of superconductivity. Intriguingly,\n$T_{\\mathrm{M}}^{\\mathrm{mod}}$ almost coincides with the onset of the\nsuperconducting transition over a broad pressure range, where mysteriously Tc\nincreases with the strengthening of magnetism. A comparison of the features in\nCeAu$_2$Si$_2$ and its parent compounds CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ and CeCu$_2$Ge$_2$\nplotted as function of the unit-cell volume leads us to promote that critical\nfluctuations of a valence crossover play a crucial role in the superconducting\nparing mechanism. Our study reveals new intriguing features of magnetism and\nillustrates a complex interplay between magnetism, quantum criticality and\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Determining the state of a quantum system is a consuming procedure. For this\nreason, whenever one is interested only in some particular property of a state,\nit would be desirable to design a measurement setup that reveals this property\nwith as little effort as possible. Here we investigate whether, in order to\nsuccessfully complete a given task of this kind, one needs an informationally\ncomplete measurement, or if something less demanding would suffice. The first\nalternative means that in order to complete the task, one needs a measurement\nwhich fully determines the state. We formulate the task as a membership problem\nrelated to a partitioning of the quantum state space and, in doing so, connect\nit to the geometry of the state space. For a general membership problem we\nprove various sufficient criteria that force informational completeness, and we\nexplicitly treat several physically relevant examples. For the specific cases\nthat do not require informational completeness, we also determine bounds on the\nminimal number of measurement outcomes needed to ensure success in the task.\n", "  Computing the electric eddy currents in non-linear materials, such as\nsuperconductors, is \\E{not straightforward}. The design of superconducting\nmagnets and power applications needs electromagnetic computer modeling, being\nin many cases a three-dimensional (3D) problem. Since 3D problems require high\ncomputing times, novel time-efficient modeling tools are highly desirable. This\narticle presents a novel computing modeling method based on a variational\nprinciple. The self-programmed implementation uses an original minimization\nmethod, which divides the sample into sectors. This speeds-up the computations\nwith no loss of accuracy, while enabling efficient parallelization. This method\ncould also be applied to model transients in linear materials or networks of\nnon-linear electrical elements. As example, we analyze the magnetization\ncurrents of a cubic superconductor. This 3D situation remains unknown, in spite\nof the fact that it is often met in material characterization and bulk\napplications. We found that below the penetration field and in part of the\nsample, current flux lines are not rectangular and significantly bend in the\ndirection parallel to the applied field. In conclusion, the presented numerical\nmethod is able to time-efficiently solve fully 3D situations without loss of\naccuracy.\n", "  In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and\ndynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals\nof the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the\nidentifiers \"HIV/AIDS\", \"Human Immunodeficiency Virus\", \"HIV-1\" and \"Acquired\nImmunodeficiency Syndrome\" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried\nout. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of\nthe papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree\nof 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text\nmining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics.\nThirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and\noldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the\npatient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular\nstructures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the\ndevelopment of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the\ndisease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts\noccurred in successive \"waves\" over the time which suggest a transition in the\nparadigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in\nHIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in\nelements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but\nalso by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the\ndramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred\nbetween 1993 and 1995.\n", "  We describe an implementation of Shor's quantum algorithm to factor n-bit\nintegers using only 2n+2 qubits. In contrast to previous space-optimized\nimplementations, ours features a purely Toffoli based modular multiplication\ncircuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in O(n^3) and O(n^3\nlog(n)), respectively. We thus achieve the same space and time costs as\nTakahashi et al., while using a purely classical modular multiplication\ncircuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads\noriginating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of\nfaults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware\nimplementation. Our new (in-place) constant-adder, which is used to construct\nthe modular multiplication circuit, uses only dirty ancilla qubits and features\na circuit size and depth in O(n log(n)) and O(n), respectively.\n", "  We introduce a two-player nonlocal game, called the $(G,H)$-isomorphism game,\nwhere classical players can win with certainty if and only if the graphs $G$\nand $H$ are isomorphic. We then define the notions of quantum and\nnon-signalling isomorphism, by considering perfect quantum and non-signalling\nstrategies for the $(G,H)$-isomorphism game, respectively. In the quantum case,\nwe consider both the tensor product and commuting frameworks for nonlocal\ngames. We prove that non-signalling isomorphism coincides with the well-studied\nnotion of fractional isomorphism, thus giving the latter an operational\ninterpretation. Second, we show that, in the tensor product framework, quantum\nisomorphism is equivalent to the feasibility of two polynomial systems in\nnon-commuting variables, obtained by relaxing the standard integer programming\nformulations for graph isomorphism to Hermitian variables. On the basis of this\ncorrespondence, we show that quantum isomorphic graphs are necessarily\ncospectral. Finally, we provide a construction for reducing linear binary\nconstraint system games to isomorphism games. This allows us to produce quantum\nisomorphic graphs that are nevertheless not isomorphic. Furthermore, it allows\nus to show that our two notions of quantum isomorphism, from the tensor product\nand commuting frameworks, are in fact distinct relations, and that the latter\nis undecidable. Our construction is related to the FGLSS reduction from\ninapproximability literature, as well as the CFI construction.\n", "  We argue that if the degeneracy of the spectrum of linear perturbations of\nAdS is properly taken into account, there are globally regular, time-periodic,\nasymptotically AdS solutions (geons) bifurcating from each linear\neigenfrequency of AdS.\n", "  The principle of maximum entropy provides a useful method for inferring\nstatistical mechanics models from observations in correlated systems, and is\nwidely used in a variety of fields where accurate data are available. While the\nassumptions underlying maximum entropy are intuitive and appealing, its\nadequacy for describing complex empirical data has been little studied in\ncomparison to alternative approaches. Here data from the collective spiking\nactivity of retinal neurons is reanalysed. The accuracy of the maximum entropy\ndistribution constrained by mean firing rates and pairwise correlations is\ncompared to a random ensemble of distributions constrained by the same\nobservables. In general, maximum entropy approximates the true distribution\nbetter than the typical or mean distribution from that ensemble. This advantage\nimproves with population size, with groups as small as 8 being almost always\nbetter described by maximum entropy. Failure of maximum entropy to outperform\nrandom models is found to be associated with strong correlations in the\npopulation.\n", "  We demonstrate a quantum nanophotonics platform based on germanium-vacancy\n(GeV) color centers in fiber-coupled diamond nanophotonic waveguides. We show\nthat GeV optical transitions have a high quantum efficiency and are nearly\nlifetime-broadened in such nanophotonic structures. These properties yield an\nefficient interface between waveguide photons and a single GeV without the use\nof a cavity or slow-light waveguide. As a result, a single GeV center reduces\nwaveguide transmission by $18 \\pm 1\\%$ on resonance in a single pass. We use a\nnanophotonic interferometer to perform homodyne detection of GeV resonance\nfluorescence. By probing the photon statistics of the output field, we\ndemonstrate that the GeV-waveguide system is nonlinear at the single-photon\nlevel.\n", "  Reliable quantum communication/processing links between modules are a\nnecessary building block for various quantum processing architectures. Here we\nconsider a spin chain system with alternating strength couplings and containing\nthree defects, that impose three domain walls between topologically distinct\nregions of the chain. We show that -- in addition to its useful, high fidelity,\nquantum state transfer properties -- an entangling protocol can be implemented\nin this system, with optional localisation and storage of the entangled states.\nWe demonstrate both numerically and analytically that, given a suitable initial\nproduct-state injection, the natural dynamics of the system produces a\nmaximally entangled state at a given time. We present detailed investigations\nof the effects of fabrication errors, analyzing random static disorder both in\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the system Hamiltonian. Our results show\nthat the entangled state formation is very robust against perturbations of up\nto $\\sim10\\%$ the weaker chain coupling, and also robust against timing\ninjection errors. We propose a further protocol which manipulates the chain in\norder to localise and store each of the entangled qubits. The engineering of a\nsystem with such characteristics would thus provide a useful device for quantum\ninformation processing tasks involving the creation and storage of entangled\nresources.\n", "  The static and dynamic states of N\\'eel skyrmions in ultrathin ferromagnetic\nfilms with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) have been\nmicromagnetically simulated as functions of the interfacial DMI strength and\napplied static magnetic field. Findings reveal that while the breathing,\ncounterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) rotational eigenmodes exist in the\nskyrmion lattice (SkL) phase, only the first two modes are present in the\nisolated skyrmion (ISk) phase. Additionally, the eigenfrequency of the CCW mode\nis insensitive to the magnetic-field driven SkL-ISk phase transition, and the\ninter-skyrmion interaction is largely responsible for exciting the CW mode in\nthe SkL phase. The findings provide physical insight into the dynamics of the\nphase transition and would be of use to potential skyrmion-based microwave\napplications.\n", "  We obtain a geometrical inequality involving the ADM mass, the angular\nmomentum and the size of an ordinary, axially symmetric object. We use the\nmonotonicity of the Geroch quasi-local energy on 2-surfaces along the inverse\nmean curvature flow. We also compute numerical examples to test the robustness\nof our hypotheses and results\n", "  We study both noncentrosymmetric and time-reversal breaking Weyl semimetal\nsystems under a strong magnetic field with the Coulomb interaction. The\nthree-dimensional bulk system is reduced to many mutually interacting\nquasi-one-dimensional wires. Each strongly correlated wire can be approached\nwithin the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid formalism. Including impurity scatterings,\nwe inspect the localization effect and the temperature dependence of the\nelectrical resistivity. The effect of a large number of Weyl points in real\nmaterials is also discussed.\n", "  A high-resolution finite volume method approach to incorporating\ntime-dependent slip across rectangular subfaults when modeling general fault\ngeometry is presented. The fault slip is induced by a modification of the\nRiemann problem to the linear elasticity equations across cell interfaces\naligned with the subfaults. This is illustrated in the context of the\nhigh-resolution wave-propagation algorithms that are implemented in the open\nsource Clawpack software (www.clawpack.org), but this approach could be easily\nincorporated into other Riemann solver based numerical methods. Surface\ndeformation results are obtained in both two and three dimensions and compared\nto those given by the steady-state, homogeneous half-space Okada solution.\n", "  Incorporating computer programming exercises in introductory physics is a\ndelicate task that involves a number of choices that may have a strong affect\non student learning. We present an approach that speaks to a number of common\nconcerns that arise when using programming exercises in introductory physics\nclasses where most students are absolute beginner programmers. These students\nneed an approach that is (1) simple, involving 75 or fewer lines of\nwell-commented code, (2) easy to use, with browser-based coding tools, (3)\ninteractive, with a high frame rate to give a video-game like feel, (4)\nstep-by-step with the ability to interact with intermediate stages of the\n\"correct\" program and (5) thoughtfully integrated into the physics curriculum,\nfor example, by illustrating velocity and acceleration vectors throughout. We\npresent a set of hour-long activities for classical mechanics that resemble\nwell-known games such as \"asteroids\", \"lunar lander\" and \"angry birds\". Survey\nresults from the first activity from four semesters of introductory physics\nclasses at OSU in which a high percentage of the students are weak or absolute\nbeginner programmers seems to confirm that the level of difficulty is\nappropriate for this level and that the students enjoy the activity. These\nexercises are available for general use at http://compadre.org/PICUP In the\nfuture we plan to assess conceptual knowledge using an animated version of the\nForce Concept Inventory originally developed by M. Dancy.\n", "  The Prandtl Plus scaling parameters are reexamined theoretically. The flow\ngoverning equations approach is used to examine similarity issues of the inner\nregion of wall-bounded turbulent flows as well as laminar flow cases. It is\nfound that the Prandtl Plus parameters are in fact similarity scaling\nparameters for laminar sink flow but NOT the more general laminar Falkner-Skan\nboundary layer flows. For turbulent boundary layer flows along a wall, it is\nfound that only turbulent sink flows show similarity with the Prandtl Plus\nscaling parameters. This is diametrically opposed to the accepted notion that\nthe Prandtl Plus parameters work for every wall-bounded turbulent flow. To\ncorrect the problem with the Prandtl Plus parameters, we introduce a new set of\nscaling parameters that work for the Falkner-Skan boundary layer flows and\nsatisfy the relevant part of the flow governing equations approach to\nsimilarity.\n", "  In real-world applications, observations are often constrained to a small\nfraction of a system. Such spatial subsampling can be caused by the\ninaccessibility or the sheer size of the system, and cannot be overcome by\nlonger sampling. Spatial subsampling can strongly bias inferences about a\nsystem's aggregated properties. To overcome the bias, we derive analytically a\nsubsampling scaling framework that is applicable to different observables,\nincluding distributions of neuronal avalanches, of number of people infected\nduring an epidemic outbreak, and of node degrees. We demonstrate how to infer\nthe correct distributions of the underlying full system, how to apply it to\ndistinguish critical from subcritical systems, and how to disentangle\nsubsampling and finite size effects. Lastly, we apply subsampling scaling to\nneuronal avalanche models and to recordings from developing neural networks. We\nshow that only mature, but not young networks follow power-law scaling,\nindicating self-organization to criticality during development.\n", "  The massive parallel approach of neuromorphic circuits leads to effective\nmethods for solving complex problems. It has turned out that resistive\nswitching devices with a continuous resistance range are potential candidates\nfor such applications. These devices are memristive systems - nonlinear\nresistors with memory. They are fabricated in nanotechnology and hence\nparameter spread during fabrication may aggravate reproducible analyses. This\nissue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.\n  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device\ncan be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena.\nHowever, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for\ninvestigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation\npurposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast\nsimulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced\nelectrical model of a valence change mechanism (VCM) based double barrier\nmemristive device (DBMD) with a continuous resistance range. This device\nconsists of an ultra-thin memristive layer sandwiched between a tunnel barrier\nand a Schottky-contact. The introduced model leads to very fast simulations by\nusing usual circuit simulation tools while maintaining physically meaningful\nparameters.\n  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model and experimental\ndata have been utilized as references to verify the concentrated model.\n", "  We prove a multivariable elliptic extension of Jackson's summation formula\nconjectured by Spiridonov. The trigonometric limit case of this result is due\nto Gustafson and Rakha. As applications, we obtain two further multivariable\nelliptic Jackson summations and two multivariable elliptic Bailey\ntransformations. The latter four results are all new even in the trigonometric\ncase.\n", "  Dynamical phase transitions are crucial features of the fluctuations of\nstatistical systems, corresponding to boundaries between qualitatively\ndifferent mechanisms of maintaining unlikely values of dynamical observables\nover long periods of time. They manifest themselves in the form of\nnon-analyticities in the large deviation function of those observables. In this\npaper, we look at bulk-driven exclusion processes with open boundaries. It is\nknown that the standard asymmetric simple exclusion process exhibits a\ndynamical phase transition in the large deviations of the current of particles\nflowing through it. That phase transition has been described thanks to specific\ncalculation methods relying on the model being exactly solvable, but more\ngeneral methods have also been used to describe the extreme large deviations of\nthat current, far from the phase transition. We extend those methods to a large\nclass of models based on the ASEP, where we add arbitrary spatial\ninhomogeneities in the rates and short-range potentials between the particles.\nWe show that, as for the regular ASEP, the large deviation function of the\ncurrent scales differently with the size of the system if one considers very\nhigh or very low currents, pointing to the existence of a dynamical phase\ntransition between those two regimes: high current large deviations are\nextensive in the system size, and the typical states associated to them are\nCoulomb gases, which are correlated ; low current large deviations do not\ndepend on the system size, and the typical states associated to them are\nanti-shocks, consistently with a hydrodynamic behaviour. Finally, we illustrate\nour results numerically on a simple example, and we interpret the transition in\nterms of the current pushing beyond its maximal hydrodynamic value, as well as\nrelate it to the appearance of Tracy-Widom distributions in the relaxation\nstatistics of such models.\n", "  We propose a solution to the problem of realizing a predefined and arbitrary\npure quantum state, based on the simultaneous presence of coherent and\ndissipative dynamics, noncommuting on the target state and in the limit of\nstrong dissipation. More precisely, we obtain a necessary and sufficient\ncriterion whereby the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of an open quantum\nsystem described by a Lindblad master equation approaches a target pure state\nin the Zeno regime, i.e., for infinitely large dissipative coupling. We also\nprovide an explicit formula for the characteristic dissipative strength beyond\nwhich the purity of the NESS becomes effective, thus paving the way to an\nexperimental implementation of our criterion. For an illustration, we deal with\ntargeting a Bell state, an arbitrary pure state of $N$ qubits, and a spin-helix\nstate of $N$ qubits.\n", "  Parametric conversion and amplification based on three-wave mixing are\npowerful primitives for efficient quantum operations. For superconducting\nqubits, such operations can be realized with a quadrupole Josephson junction\nelement, the Josephson Ring Modulator (JRM), which behaves as a loss-less\nthree-wave mixer. However, combining multiple quadrupole elements is a\ndifficult task so it would be advantageous to have a pure three-wave dipole\nelement that could be tessellated for increased power handling and/or\ninformation throughput. Here, we present a dipole circuit element with\nthird-order nonlinearity, which implements three-wave mixing. Experimental\nresults for a non-degenerate amplifier based on the proposed pure third-order\nnonlinearity are reported.\n", "  Permutation symmetries of multipartite quantum states are defined only when\nthe constituent subsystems are of equal dimensions. In this work we extend this\nnotion of permutation symmetry to heterogeneous systems, that is, systems\ncomposed of subsystems having unequal dimensions. Given a tensor product space\nof $k$ subsystems (of arbitrary dimensions) and a permutation operation\n$\\sigma$ over $k$ symbols, these states are such that they have identical\ndecompositions (up to an overall phase) in the given tensor product space and\nthe tensor product space obtained by the permuting the subsystems by $\\sigma$.\nTowards this, we construct a matrix whose action is to simultaneously permute\nthe subsystem label and subsystem dimension of a given state according to\npermutation $\\sigma$. Eigenvectors of this matrix have the required symmetry.\nWe then examine entanglement of states in the igenspaces of these matrices. It\nis found that all nonsymmetric eigenspaces of such matrices are completely\nentangled subspaces, with states being equally entangled in both the given\ntensor product space and the permuted tensor product space.\n", "  These are expanded lecture notes from lectures given at the Workshop on\nhigher structures at MATRIX Melbourne. These notes give an introduction to\nFeynman categories and their applications.\n  Feynman categories give a universal categorical way to encode operations and\nrelations. This includes the aspects of operad--like theories such as PROPs,\nmodular operads, twisted (modular) operads, properads, hyperoperads and their\ncolored versions. There is more depth to the general theory as it applies as\nwell to algebras over operads and an abundance of other related structures,\nsuch as crossed simplicial groups, the augmented simplicial category or\nFI--modules. Through decorations and transformations the theory is also related\nto the geometry of moduli spaces. Furthermore the morphisms in a Feynman\ncategory give rise to Hopf-- and bi--algebras with examples coming from\ntopology, number theory and quantum field theory. All these aspects are\ncovered.\n", "  The geometric phase and topological property for one-dimensional hybrid\nplasmonic-photonic crystals consisting of a simple lattice of graphene sheets\nare investigated systematically. For transverse magnetic waves, both plasmonic\nand photonic modes exist in the momentum space. The accidental degeneracy point\nof these two kinds of modes is identified to be a diabolic point accompanied\nwith a topological phase transition. For a closed loop around this degeneracy\npoint, the Berry phase is Pi as a consequence of the discontinuous jump of the\ngeometric Zak phase. The wave impedance is calculated analytically for the\nsemi-infinite system, and the corresponding topological interface states either\nstart from or terminate at the degeneracy point. This type of localized\ninterface states may find potential applications in photonics and plasmonics.\n", "  The supersymmetric Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model proposed by Cheng, Dai, Faisel\nand Kong is re-analyzed by using an auxiliary superfield method in which a\nhidden local U(1) symmetry emerges. It is shown that, in the healthy\nfield-space region where no negative metric particles appear, only SUSY\npreserving vacua can be realized in the weak coupling regime and a composite\nmassive spin-1 supermultiplets appear as a result of spontaneous breaking of\nthe hidden local U(1) symmetry. In the strong coupling regime, on the other\nhand, SUSY is dynamically broken, but it is always accompanied by negative\nmetric particles.\n", "  We report on a novel method for photo-association of strongly polar trilobite\nRydberg molecules. This exotic ultralong-range dimer, consisting of a\nground-state atom bound to the Rydberg electron via electron-neutral\nscattering, inherits its polar character from the admixture of high angular\nmomentum electronic orbitals. The absence of low-$L$ character hinders standard\nphoto-association techniques. Here, we show that for suitable principal quantum\nnumbers resonant coupling of the orbital motion with the nuclear spin of the\nperturber, mediated by electron-neutral scattering, hybridizes the trilobite\nmolecular potential with the more conventional ${\\rm{S}}$-type molecular state.\nThis provides a general path to associate trilobite molecules with large\nelectric dipole moments, as demonstrated via high-resolution spectroscopy. We\nfind a dipole moment of 135(45) D for the trilobite state. Our results are\ncompared to theoretical predictions based on a Fermi-model.\n", "  The electronic structure of recently discovered $\\beta$-Fe$_4$Se$_5$ with\n$\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}$ ordered Fe vacancies is calculated using\nfirst-principles density functional theory. We find that the ground state is an\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator in agreement with the experimental\nobservation. In K$_2$Fe$_4$Se$_5$, it is known that the ground state is\n$\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}$-blocked-checkerboard AFM ordered. But for this\nmaterial, we find that the ground state is $\\sqrt{5} \\times\n\\sqrt{5}$-pair-checkerboard AFM ordered, in which the intrablock four Fe spins\nexhibit the collinear AFM order and the interblock spins on any two\nnearest-neighboring sites are antiparallel aligned. This state is about 130\nmeV/Fe lower in energy than the $\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}$-blocked-checkerboard\nAFM one. Electron doping can lower the energy of the $\\sqrt{5} \\times\n\\sqrt{5}$-blocked-checkerboard AFM state and introduce a transition between\nthese two states, suggesting that there is strong AFM fluctuation in FeSe-based\nmaterials upon doping. This provides a unified picture to understand the AFM\norders in $\\beta$-Fe$_4$Se$_5$ and in alkali-metal intercalated FeSe materials.\n", "  We investigate how three different possibilities of neutrino mass\nhierarchies, namely normal, inverted, and degenerate, can affect the\nobservational constraints on three well known dynamical dark energy models,\nnamely the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, logarithmic, and the\nJassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan parametrizations. In order to impose the observational\nconstraints on the models, we performed a robust analysis using Planck 2015\ntemperature and polarization data, Supernovae type Ia from Joint Light curve\nanalysis, baryon acoustic oscillations distance measurements, redshift space\ndistortion characterized by $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$ data, weak gravitational lensing\ndata from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, and cosmic\nchronometers data plus the local value of the Hubble parameter. We find that\ndifferent neutrino mass hierarchies return similar fit on almost all model\nparameters and mildly change the dynamical dark energy properties.\n", "  The viability of a variant of numerical stochastic perturbation theory, where\nthe Langevin equation is replaced by the SMD algorithm, is examined. In\nparticular, the convergence of the process to a unique stationary state is\nrigorously established and the use of higher-order symplectic integration\nschemes is shown to be highly profitable in this context. For illustration, the\ngradient-flow coupling in finite volume with Schr\\\"odinger functional boundary\nconditions is computed to two-loop (i.e. NNL) order in the SU(3) gauge theory.\nThe scaling behaviour of the algorithm turns out to be rather favourable in\nthis case, which allows the computations to be driven close to the continuum\nlimit.\n", "  Detailed numerical analyses of the orbital motion of a test particle around a\nspinning primary are performed. They aim to investigate the possibility of\nusing the post-Keplerian (pK) corrections to the orbiter's periods (draconitic,\nanomalistic and sidereal) as a further opportunity to perform new tests of\npost-Newtonian (pN) gravity. As a specific scenario, the S-stars orbiting the\nMassive Black Hole (MBH) supposedly lurking in Sgr A$^\\ast$ at the center of\nthe Galaxy is adopted. We, first, study the effects of the pK Schwarzchild,\nLense-Thirring and quadrupole moment accelerations experienced by a target star\nfor various possible initial orbital configurations. It turns out that the\nresults of the numerical simulations are consistent with the analytical ones in\nthe small eccentricity approximation for which almost all the latter ones were\nderived. For highly elliptical orbits, the size of all the three pK corrections\nconsidered turn out to increase remarkably. The periods of the observed S2 and\nS0-102 stars as functions of the MBH's spin axis orientation are considered as\nwell. The pK accelerations considered lead to corrections of the orbital\nperiods of the order of 1-100d (Schwarzschild), 0.1-10h (Lense-Thirring) and\n1-10^3s (quadrupole) for a target star with a=300-800~AU and e ~ 0.8, which\ncould be possibly measurable by the future facilities.\n", "  An experimental setup of three coupled $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric wave guides\nshowing the characteristics of a third-order exceptional point (EP3) has been\ninvestigated in an idealized model of three delta-functions wave guides in\nW.~D. Heiss and G.~Wunner, J. Phys. A 49, 495303 (2016). Here we extend these\ninvestigations to realistic, extended wave guide systems. We place major focus\non the strong parameter sensitivity rendering the discovery of an EP3 a\nchallenging task. We also investigate the vicinity of the EP3 for further\nbranch points of either cubic or square root type behavior.\n", "  Different molecular dynamics methods like the direct method, the Green-Kubo\n(GK) method and homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method\nhave been widely used to calculate lattice thermal conductivity\n($\\kappa_\\ell$). While the first two methods have been used and compared quite\nextensively, there is a lack of comparison of these methods with the HNEMD\nmethod. Focusing on the underlying computational parameters, we present a\ndetailed comparison of the GK and HNEMD methods for both bulk and vacancy Si\nusing the Stillinger-Weber potential. For the bulk calculations, we find both\nmethods to perform well and yield $\\kappa_\\ell$ within acceptable\nuncertainties. In case of the vacancy calculations, HNEMD method has a slight\nadvantage over the GK method as it becomes computationally cheaper for lower\n$\\kappa_\\ell$ values. This study could promote the application of HNEMD method\nin $\\kappa_\\ell$ calculations involving other lattice defects like nanovoids,\ndislocations, interfaces.\n", "  Superconducting circuits are well established as a strong candidate platform\nfor the development of quantum computing. In order to advance to a practically\nuseful level, architectures are needed which combine arrays of many qubits with\nselective qubit control and readout, without compromising on coherence. Here we\npresent a coaxial circuit QED architecture in which qubit and resonator are\nfabricated on opposing sides of a single chip, and control and readout wiring\nare provided by coaxial wiring running perpendicular to the chip plane. We\npresent characterisation measurements of a fabricated device in good agreement\nwith simulated parameters and demonstrating energy relaxation and dephasing\ntimes of $T_1 = 4.1\\,\\mu$s and $T_2 = 5.7\\,\\mu$s respectively. The architecture\nallows for scaling to large arrays of selectively controlled and measured\nqubits with the advantage of all wiring being out of the plane.\n", "  One proposed formation channel for stellar mass black holes (BHs) is through\nhierarchical mergers of smaller BHs. Repeated mergers between comparable mass\nBHs leave an imprint on the spin of the resulting BH, since the final BH spin\nis largely determined by the orbital angular momentum of the binary. We find\nthat for stellar mass BHs forming hierarchically the distribution of spin\nmagnitudes is universal, with a peak at $a \\sim 0.7$ and little support below\n$a \\sim 0.5$. We show that the spin distribution is robust against changes to\nthe mass ratio of the merging binaries, the initial spin distribution of the\nfirst generation of BHs, and the number of merger generations. While we assume\nan isotropic distribution of initial spin directions, spins that are\npreferentially aligned or antialigned do not qualitatively change our results.\nWe also consider a \"cluster catastrophe\" model for BH formation in which we\nallow for mergers of arbitrary mass ratios and show that this scenario predicts\na unique spin distribution that is similar to the universal distribution\nderived for major majors. We explore the ability of spin measurements from\nground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors to constrain hierarchical merger\nscenarios. We apply a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to mock GW data and\nargue that the fraction of BHs that formed through hierarchical mergers will be\nconstrained with $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ LIGO binary black hole detections, while\nwith $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ detections we could falsify a model in which all\ncomponent BHs form hierarchically.\n", "  We consider the process of cooling of a heavy particle beam in a co-moving\nelectron beam of low temperature guided by a solenoidal magnetic field. This\npaper summarizes the main results of theoretical studies of this process\nconducted by the author during a period of several years. The main result of\nthese studies is a conclusion that magnetization of the electron beam can\nprovide the possibility of drastic enhancement of the cooling rate of a heavy\nparticle beam with achieving equilibrium temperatures that are much lower than\nthe transverse temperatures of the electron beam. Magnetized electron cooling\nis proposed for cooling of ion beams in high-luminosity colliders.\n", "  We obtain the quantized momentum solutions, $\\mathcal{P}_{n}$, of the\nFeinberg-Horodecki equation. We study the space-like coherent states for the\nspace-like counterpart of the Schr\\\"odinger equation with trigonometric\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential which is constructed by temporal counterpart of the\nspatial P\\\"oschl-Teller potential.\n", "  Inner accretion disc around a black hole provides a rare, natural probe to\nunderstand the fundamental physics of the strong gravity regime. A possible\ntilt of such a disc, with respect to the black hole spin equator, is important.\nThis is because such a tilt affects the observed spectral and timing properties\nof the disc X-ray emission via Lense-Thirring precession, which could be used\nto test the theoretical predictions regarding the strong gravity. Here, we\nanalytically solve the steady, warped accretion disc equation of Scheurer and\nFeiler (1996), and find an expression of the radial profile of the disc tilt\nangle. In our exact solution, considering a prograde disc around a slowly\nspinning black hole, we include the inner part of the disc, which was not done\nearlier in this formalism. Such a solution is timely, as a tilted inner disc\nhas recently been inferred from X-ray spectral and timing features of the\naccreting black hole H1743-322. Our tilt angle radial profile expression\nincludes observationally measurable parameters, such as black hole mass and\nKerr parameter, and the disc inner edge tilt angle $W_{\\rm in}$, and hence can\nbe ideal to confront observations. Our solution shows that the disc tilt angle\nin $10-100$ gravitational radii is a significant fraction of the disc outer\nedge tilt angle, even for $W_{\\rm in} = 0$. Moreover, tilt angle radial\nprofiles have humps in $\\sim 10-1000$ gravitational radii for some sets of\nparameter values, which should have implications for observed X-ray features.\n", "  Energy conservation in radiating processes requires, at the classical level,\nto take into account damping forces on the sources. These forces can be\nrepresented in terms of asymptotic data and lead to charges defined as\nintegrals over the asymptotic boundary. For scattering processes these charges,\nin case of zero radiated energy, are conserved and encode the information about\nthe sub-leading soft theorems and matching conditions. The QED version of the\nself forces is associated with the dependence of the differential cross section\non the infrared resolution scale.\n", "  We report the appearance of a new radio source at a projected offset of 460\npc from the nucleus of Cygnus A. The flux density of the source (which we\ndesignate Cygnus A-2) rose from an upper limit of <0.5 mJy in 1989 to 4 mJy in\n2016 (nu=8.5 GHz), but is currently not varying by more than a few percent per\nyear. The radio luminosity of the source is comparable to the most luminous\nknown supernovae, it is compact in VLBA observations down to a scale of 4 pc,\nand it is coincident with a near-infrared point source seen in pre-existing\nadaptive optics and HST observations. The most likely interpretation of this\nsource is that it represents a secondary supermassive black hole in a close\norbit around the Cygnus A primary, although an exotic supernova model cannot be\nruled out. The gravitational influence of a secondary SMBH at this location may\nhave played an important role in triggering the rapid accretion that has\npowered the Cygnus A radio jet over the past 10^7 years.\n", "  Interface widely exists in carbon nanotube (CNT) assembly materials, taking\nplace at different length scales. It determines severely the mechanical\nproperties of these assembly materials. Here I assess the mechanical properties\nof individual CNTs and CNT bundles, the inter-layer or inter-shell mechanics in\nmulti-walled CNTs, the shear properties between adjacent CNTs, and the\nassembly-dependent mechanical and multifunctional properties of macroscopic CNT\nfibers and films.\n", "  By the Magnus-Floquet approach we calculate the effective Hamiltonian for a\ncharged particle on the lattice subject to a homogeneous high frequency\noscillating electric field. The obtained result indicate the absence of dynamic\nlocalization of the particle for any value of the lattice constant and electric\nfield applied, which completes the limit results obtained by Dunlap and Kenkre.\n", "  We present an alternative approach to the fabrication of highly efficient\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on tungsten\nsilicide. Using well-established technologies for the deposition of dielectric\nmirrors and anti-reflection coatings in conjunction with an embedded WSi\nbilayer photon absorber structure, we fabricated a bandwidth-enhanced detector.\nIt exhibits system detection efficiencies (SDE) higher than\n$\\left(87.1\\pm1.3\\right)\\,\\%$ in the range from $1450\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to\n$1640\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, with a maximum of $\\left(92.9\\pm1.1\\right)\\,\\%$ at\n$1515\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Our measurements indicate SDE enhancements of up to\n$\\left(18.4\\pm1.7\\right)\\,\\%$ over a single-absorber WSi SNSPD. The latter has\nbeen optimized for 1550 nm for comparison and exhibits maximum SDE of\n$\\left(93.5\\pm1.2\\right)\\,\\%$ at 1555 nm. We emphasize that our technological\napproach has been tested with, but is not limited to, the wavelengths and\nabsorber material presented here. It could be adapted flexibly for multi-color\ndetector systems from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared wavelength range.\nThis bears the potential for significant improvements in many current quantum\noptical experiments and applications as well as for detector commercialization.\n", "  Graphene-based photodetectors have demonstrated mechanical flexibility, large\noperating bandwidth, and broadband spectral response. However, their linear\ndynamic range (LDR) is limited by graphene's intrinsichot-carrier dynamics,\nwhich causes deviation from a linear photoresponse at low incident powers. At\nthe same time, multiplication of hot carriers causes the photoactive region to\nbe smeared over distances of a few micro-meters, limiting the use of graphene\nin high-resolution applications. We present a novel method for engineer-ing\nphotoactive junctions in FeCl3-intercalated graphene using laser irradiation.\nPhotocurrent measured at these planar junctions shows an extraordinary linear\nresponse with an LDR value at least 4500 times larger than that of other\ngraphene devices (44 dB) while maintaining high stability against environmental\ncontamination without the need for encapsulation. The observed photoresponse is\npurely photovoltaic, demonstrating complete quenching of hot-carrier effects.\nThese results pave the way toward the design of ultrathin photode-tectors with\nunprecedented LDR for high-definition imaging and sensing.\n", "  A ground-layer adaptive optics system (GLAO) uses a single adaptive mirror to\npartially correct the wavefront for atmospheric and telescope aberrations over\na wide field of view. Instead of reaching diffraction limit on a narrow field,\nthe idea is to provide partial improvement of the PSF over a wide field\nappropriate for multi-object spectrographs or wide field imagers. We derive an\nanalytic formulation for the GLAO corrected PSF and then apply that in\ndeveloping a methodology for calculating sensitivity improvement for\nastronomical instruments.\n", "  We consider a half-soliton stationary state of the nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with the power nonlinearity on a star graph consisting of N edges and\na single vertex. For the subcritical power nonlinearity, the half-soliton state\nis a degenerate critical point of the action functional under the mass\nconstraint such that the second variation is nonnegative. By using normal\nforms, we prove that the degenerate critical point is a nonlinear saddle point,\nfor which the small perturbations to the half-soliton state grow slowly in time\nresulting in the nonlinear instability of the half-soliton state. The result\nholds for any $N \\geq 3$ and arbitrary subcritical power nonlinearity. It gives\na precise dynamical characterization of the previous result of Adami {\\em et\nal.}, where the half-soliton state was shown to be a saddle point of the action\nfunctional under the mass constraint for $N = 3$ and for cubic nonlinearity.\n", "  The Semimicroscopic Algebraic Cluster Model (SACM) is extended to heavy\nnuclei, making use of the pseudo-SU(3) model. As a first step, the concept of\nforbiddenness will be resumed. One consequence of the forbiddenness is that the\nground state of a nucleus can in general be described by two internally excited\nclusters. After that, the pseudo- SACM is formulated. The basis of pseudo-SACM\nis constructed, defin- ing each cluster within the united nucleus with the same\noscillator fre- quency and deformation of the harmonic oscillator as a mean\nfield and dividing the nucleons in those within the unique and normal orbitals,\nconsistently for both clusters and the united nucleus. As test cases, this\nmodel is applied to 236U $\\rightarrow$ 210Pb+26Ne and 224Ra $\\rightarrow}\n210Pb+14C. Some spectroscopic factors will be calculated as predictions.\n", "  We present two independent analyses as further evidence that galaxy\nclustering at scales of 500 Mpc and greater has a periodic time component\ninduced by oscillations in the scale factor at a frequency of approximately 7\ncycles over one Hubble time. The scale factor oscillations were discovered in\nprevious work by analyzing the Hubble diagram for type 1a SNe data. In the\npresent work we analyze galaxy number count data from SDSSIII-BOSS, DR9 using a\nsimple oscillating expanding space model and also perform a Fourier analysis of\nthe same SDSSIII data set . The number distribution of galaxies on these scales\nshould be relatively smooth. However, a DR9 plot of galaxy number count per\n0.01 redshift bin as a function of redshift shows significant bumps to redshift\n0.5. Later releases show the same behavior. Our model fits essentially all\nbumps at 99.8% confidence once the oscillation is included. A Fourier analysis\nof the same number count vs. redshift data (processed only to convert redshift\nto equal time bins) clearly shows the dominant 7-cycle signal at 15/1\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The DR9 galaxy number count peaks near redshift 0.5 and\nthen falls off due to target magnitude limitations. In our model we assume\nideal observation to all redshifts. The oscillation model displays a matching\npeak at redshift 0.5, then falls, but continues on to rise predicting a second\npeak at redshift 0.64. Confirmation of the second peak from future SDSSIV data\nto higher redshift would further support our observation of oscillations in the\nscale factor. The oscillations may derive from a scalar field model of dark\nmatter as shown in our earlier work.\n", "  A new pathway to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in high pressure\ndiamond anvil cells is introduced, using inductively coupled broadband passive\nelectro-magnetic lenses to locally amplify the magnetic flux at the isolated\nsample, leading to an increase in sensitivity. The lenses are adopted for the\ngeometrical restrictions imposed by a toroidal diamond indenter cell, and yield\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios at pressures as high as 72 GPa, at initial sample\nvolumes of only 230 pl. The corresponding levels of detection, LODt, are found\nto be up to four orders of magnitude lower compared to formerly used solenoidal\nmicro-coils in diamond anvil cells, as shown by Proton-NMR measurements on\nparaffin oil. This approach opens up the field of ultra-high pressure sciences\nfor one of the most versatile spectroscopic methods available in a pressure\nrange unprecedended up to now.\n", "  Recent theoretical and experimental results suggest the possibility of using\ncurrent and near-future quantum hardware in challenging sampling tasks. In this\npaper, we introduce free energy-based reinforcement learning (FERL) as an\napplication of quantum hardware. We propose a method for processing a quantum\nannealer's measured qubit spin configurations in approximating the free energy\nof a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We then apply this method to perform\nreinforcement learning on the grid-world problem using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum\nannealer. The experimental results show that our technique is a promising\nmethod for harnessing the power of quantum sampling in reinforcement learning\ntasks.\n", "  Computational propaganda deploys social or political bots to try to shape,\nsteer and manipulate online public discussions and influence decisions.\nCollective behaviour of populations of social bots has not been yet widely\nstudied, though understanding of collective patterns arising from interactions\nbetween bots would aid social bot detection. Here we show that there are\nsignificant differences in collective behaviour between population of bots and\npopulation of humans as detected from their Twitter activity. Using a large\ndataset of tweets we have collected during the UK EU referendum campaign, we\nseparated users into population of bots and population of humans based on the\nlength of sequences of their high-frequency tweeting activity. We show that\nwhile pairwise correlations between users are weak they co-exist with\ncollective correlated states, however the statistics of correlations and\nco-spiking probability differ in both populations. Our results demonstrate that\npopulations of social bots and human users in social media exhibit collective\nproperties similar to the ones found in social and biological systems placed\nnear a critical point.\n", "  The biophysical consequences of nanoscale curvature have been challenging to\nresolve due to size-dependent membrane behavior and the experimental resolution\nlimits imposed by optical diffraction. Recent advances in nanoengineering and\nsuper-resolution techniques have enabled new capabilities for creating and\nobserving curvature. In particular, draping supported lipid bilayers over\nlithographically patterned substrates provides a model system for endocytic\npits. The experiments and simulations presented below describe the possible\ndetection of membrane curvature through fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single\nparticle tracking (SPT), and polarized localization microscopy (PLM). FRAP and\nFCS depend on diffraction-limited illumination and detection. In particular, a\nsimulation of FRAP shows no effects on lipids diffusion due to a 50 nm diameter\nmembrane bud at any stage in the budding process. Simulated FCS demonstrated\nsmall effects due to a 50 nm radius membrane bud that was amplified with\ncurvature-dependent lipid mobility changes. However, PLM and SPT achieve\nsub-diffraction-limited resolution of membrane budding and lipid mobility\nthrough the identification of the single-lipid positions with <15 nm spatial\nand <20 ms temporal resolution. By mapping the single-lipid step lengths to\nlocations on the membrane, the effects of curvature on lipid behavior have been\nresolved.\n", "  A method for the estimation of electron density from the ratio of the wave\nmagnetic and electric field amplitude of whistler waves is developed. Near the\ngeomagnetic equator, whistler wave normals are mainly close to the direction of\nthe background magnetic field. Dispersion relation of whistler wave in the\nparallel propagation approximation is used in this method. Signals registered\nby STAFF-SA instrument on board the Cluster spacecraft are used for electron\ndensity reconstruction. The Cluster spacecraft crossed the plasmasphere at all\nlocal times and in a wide range of latitudes over 10 years (2001-2010) covering\nwell the frequency range of both plasmaspheric hiss and lower band chorus\nemissions in a vicinity of the geomagnetic equator. The proposed technique can\nbe useful in allowing to supplement plasma density statistics obtained from\nrecent probes (such as THEMIS or Van Allen Probes), as well as for reanalysis\nof statistics derived from continuous measurements of only one or two\ncomponents of the wave magnetic and electric fields on board spacecraft\ncovering equatorial regions of the magnetosphere.\n", "  Tsallis' pioneer q-probability distribution $P_i=\\frac\n{[1+\\beta(1-q)U_i]^{\\frac {1} {q-1}}} {Z}$, $Z=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\n[1+\\beta(1-q)U_i]^{\\frac {1} {q-1}}$ [J. of Stat. Phys., {\\bf 52} (1988) 479]\nhas been recently attacked in arXiv:1705.01752, in a Reply to our\narXiv:1704.07493 publication. We show here that such an attack is groundless.\n", "  The evaluation of possible climate change consequence on extreme rainfall has\nsignificant implications for the design of engineering structure and\nsocioeconomic resources development. While many studies have assessed the\nimpact of climate change on design rainfall using global and regional climate\nmodel (RCM) predictions, to date, there has been no comprehensive comparison or\nevaluation of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) statistics at regional scale,\nconsidering both stationary versus nonstationary models for the future climate.\nTo understand how extreme precipitation may respond to future IDF curves, we\nused an ensemble of three RCMs participating in the North-American (NA)-CORDEX\ndomain over eight rainfall stations across Southern Ontario, one of the most\ndensely populated and major economic region in Canada. The IDF relationships\nare derived from multi-model RCM simulations and compared with the\nstation-based observations. We modeled precipitation extremes, at different\ndurations using extreme value distributions considering parameters that are\neither stationary or nonstationary, as a linear function of time. Our results\nshowed that extreme precipitation intensity driven by future climate forcing\nshows a significant increase in intensity for 10-year events in 2050s\n(2030-2070) relative to 1970-2010 baseline period across most of the locations.\nHowever, for longer return periods, an opposite trend is noted. Surprisingly,\nin term of design storms, no significant differences were found when comparing\nstationary and nonstationary IDF estimation methods for the future (2050s) for\nthe larger return periods. The findings, which are specific to regional\nprecipitation extremes, suggest no immediate reason for alarm, but the need for\nprogressive updating of the design standards in light of global warming.\n", "  We report here a peculiar dynamically ordered state of clustering droplets of\na mixture of organic solvent. There droplets are driven by the solutal\nMarangoni effect on the surface of aqueous surfactant solution. They form\ntemporal ring clusters which start collapsing immediately after its formation.\nThis process is repeated for more than several hours with the period of 5--20\nminutes. We propose an inhomogeneous force model to phenomenologically\nunderstand the basic mechanism of this dynamics, where the forces acting on\neach particle are controlled differently. This droplet system offers a simple,\nnon-biological experimental model for the study of complex dynamical states\nrealized by a group of self-propelled particles.\n", "  A method based on supersymmteric (SUSY) quantum mechanics has been developed\nby exploiting conditional Shape invariance property for obtaining exact ground\nstate solution of generalized polynomial potential with Coulomb term. Specific\ncases have been discussed with extensive analytical calculation. How this\nmethod can be used to calculate the excited states has also been demonstrated.\nWe have also used a numerical technique (RKGS) and obtained the energy\neigenvalues upto second excited state by solving the Schrodinger equation for\nquartic and sextic polynomial potentials with the Coulomb term and shown that\nthe analytical results provide very good approximations to the numerical\nresults.\n", "  Nano-structured silicon anodes are attractive alternatives to graphite in\nLi-ion batteries. Despite recent remarkable progresses in numerous Si-C\ncomposites, the commercialisation with significance is still limited. One of\nthe most critical issues remained to understand is fundamentals on Li-Si\nCoulombic efficiency, namely, CE. Particularly, it is key to quantitatively and\nqualitatively resolve CE alterations and evolutions by the various Li-Si\nstructural changes over longer cycling. However, such work is surprisingly\nscarce. Here, we provide new findings that iterating the hysteretic\namorphous-crystalline Li-Si phase transformations accumulatively governs CE\nevolutions, the manner of which is numerically distinguished from incremental\namorphous Li-Si volume changes. The iterations, usually featured as capacity\ndegradation factors, can form the most efficient CE profiles over hundreds of\ncycles, i.e. minimising accumulative irreversible Li consumption, among the\ngiven Li-Si reaction sequences. Combined with atomistic probing methodologies,\nwe show that the iteration drastically alters electrochemical and structural\ncharacteristics, which is synchronised with the CE behaviours.\n", "  The SERS spectrum of hydroquinone, adsorbed on nanoparticles of titanium\ndioxide is analyzed. It is pointed out that the enhancement is stronger for\nlarger mean size of nanoparticles that is in an agreement with the\nelectrostatic approximation. In addition it is found that there are the lines,\nwhich are forbidden in usual Raman spectra. Along with this there is the\nenhancement, caused both by the normal and tangential components of the\nelectric field. This result is in agreement with the theory of SERS on\nsemiconductor and dielectric substrates. Discovery of the forbidden lines\nindicates sufficiently large role of the strong quadrupole light-molecule\ninteraction in such a system.\n", "  In a former paper the concept of Bipartite PageRank was introduced and a\ntheorem on the limit of authority flowing between nodes for personalized\nPageRank has been generalized. In this paper we want to extend those results to\nmultimodal networks. In particular we introduce a hypergraph type that may be\nused for describing multimodal network where a hyperlink connects nodes from\neach of the modalities. We introduce a generalisation of PageRank for such\ngraphs and define the respective random walk model that can be used for\ncomputations. we finally state and prove theorems on the limit of outflow of\nauthority for cases where individual modalities have identical and distinct\ndamping factors.\n", "  We construct an artificial U(1) gauge field in the cold atom system to form a\nmonopole along with vortices. It is supposed that the cold atoms are confined\non a spherical surface, and two sets of identical laser beams in the opposite\npropagating directions shine on two sides of the sphere. Arbitrary Chern number\nCN, proportional to the quantized magnetic flux, can be obtained by selecting\nproper laser modes. This construction meets the condition of Chern's theorem,\nso that the vortices of the atom wave function will emerge on the sphere, whose\nwinding number equals CN. It is found that a geometric symmetry is broken\nspontaneously for odd CN, which corresponds to a topology-induced quantum phase\ntransition. In particular for CN=1, the ground state of the cold atoms are\ndouble-degenerate and can be applied to make a stable qubit. Since the\nground-state degeneracy is protected by topology-induced symmetry breaking\nagainst dissipation, the proposed topological structure has vast potential in\nquantum storage.\n", "  Machine learning (ML) is increasingly becoming a helpful tool in the search\nfor novel functional compounds. Here we use classification via random forests\nto predict the stability of half-Heusler (HH) compounds, using only\nexperimentally reported compounds as a training set. Cross-validation yields an\nexcellent agreement between the fraction of compounds classified as stable and\nthe actual fraction of truly stable compounds in the ICSD. The ML model is then\nemployed to screen 71,178 different 1:1:1 compositions, yielding 481 likely\nstable candidates. The predicted stability of HH compounds from three previous\nhigh throughput ab initio studies is critically analyzed from the perspective\nof the alternative ML approach. The incomplete consistency among the three\nseparate ab initio studies and between them and the ML predictions suggests\nthat additional factors beyond those considered by ab initio phase stability\ncalculations might be determinant to the stability of the compounds. Such\nfactors can include configurational entropies and quasiharmonic contributions.\n", "  Since Self-Organised Criticality (SOC) was introduced in the 1987 both the\nnature of the self-organisation and of the criticality remains controversial.\nRecent observations on rain precipitation and on brain activity suggest that\nreal systems may dynamically wander about in the vicinity of criticality rather\nthan tune to a critical point. We use computer simulations to study the\nDrossel-Schwable forest-fire model of SOC and find that it exhibits behaviour\nsimilar to that found for rain and brain activity. In particular we analyse the\nresidence time for different densities of trees and perform finite size scaling\nanalysis of the with of the distribution of residence times. We conclude that\ndespite of the long known fact that this model does not exhibit exact scaling\nand power laws its behaviour may exactly for that be very relevant to real\nphysical systems.\n", "  A new pixel detector for the CMS experiment was built in order to cope with\nthe instantaneous luminosities anticipated for the Phase~I Upgrade of the LHC.\nThe new CMS pixel detector provides four-hit tracking with a reduced material\nbudget as well as new cooling and powering schemes. A new front-end readout\nchip mitigates buffering and bandwidth limitations, and allows operation at low\ncomparator thresholds. In this paper, comprehensive test beam studies are\npresented, which have been conducted to verify the design and to quantify the\nperformance of the new detector assemblies in terms of tracking efficiency and\nspatial resolution. Under optimal conditions, the tracking efficiency is\n$99.95\\pm0.05\\,\\%$, while the intrinsic spatial resolutions are\n$4.80\\pm0.25\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $7.99\\pm0.21\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ along the\n$100\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and $150\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ pixel pitch, respectively. The\nfindings are compared to a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the pixel\ndetector and good agreement is found.\n", "  In this paper, we study a new type of large-scale instability in obliquely\nrotating stratified fluids with small scale non-helical turbulence. The\nsmall-scale turbulence is generated by the external force with zero helicity\nand low Reynolds number. The theory uses the method of multiscale asymptotic\ndevelopments. The nonlinear equations for large scale motions are obtained in\nthe third order of the perturbation theory. In this paper, we consider the\nlinear instability and the stationary nonlinear modes. We obtain solutions in\nthe form of nonlinear Beltrami waves and localized vortex structures as kinks\nof new type.\n", "  A unified model of vortex tangles is proposed to describe unconventional\ntransport in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, which not only captures\nthe fast vortices scenario at low density, but also predicts a novel mechanism\nof core-core collisions in dense vortex fluid regime. The theory clarifies the\nnature of vortex fluctuations being the quantum fluctuations of holes and then\nresolves a discrepancy of two orders of magnitude of Anderson's damping model\n$\\hbar n_v$, with right prediction of the nonlinear field dependence of the\nresistivity $\\rho=\\rho_n(B+B_T)/(B_0+B+B_T)$ and the Nernst effect, validated\nby data of several samples. Consequently, Anderson's vortex tangles concept and\nphase fluctuation scenario of pseudogap are verified quantitatively.\n", "  Large hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single-layer islands of high crystalline\nquality were grown on Ir(111) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and have been\nstudied with low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). Two types of hBN islands\nhave been observed that structurally differ in their shape and orientation with\nrespect to iridium, where the former greatly depends on the iridium step\nmorphology. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and IV-LEEM spectroscopy\nrevealed that the two island types also exhibit different work functions and\nbindings to iridium, which provides an explanation for differences in their\nshape and growth modes. In addition, various temperatures were used for the CVD\nsynthesis of hBN, and it was found that at temperatures higher than ~950\n{\\deg}C boron atoms, originating either from decomposed borazine molecules or\ndisintegrated hBN islands, can form additional compact reconstructed regions.\nThe presented results are important for advancement in synthesis of\nhigh-quality hBN and other boron-based layered materials, and could therefore\nexpedite their technological implementation.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to illustrate in a family of interesting examples\nhow to study the representation theory of vertex operator superalgebras by\ncombining the theory of vertex algebra extensions and modular forms.\n  Let $L_k\\left(\\mathfrak{osp}(1 | 2)\\right)$ be the simple affine vertex\noperator superalgebra of $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ at an admissible level $k$. We\nuse a Jacobi form decomposition to see that this is a vertex operator\nsuperalgebra extension of $L_k(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)\\otimes \\text{Vir}(p, (p+p')/2)$\nwhere $k+3/2=p/(2p')$ and $\\text{Vir}(u, v)$ denotes the regular Virasoro\nvertex operator algebra of central charge $c=1-6(u-v)^2/(uv)$. Especially, for\na positive integer $k$, we get a regular vertex operator superalgebra and this\ncase is studied further.\n  The interplay of the theory of vertex algebra extensions and modular data of\nthe vertex operator subalgebra allows us to classify all simple local\n(untwisted) and Ramond twisted $L_k\\left(\\mathfrak{osp}(1 | 2)\\right)$-modules\nand to obtain their super fusion rules. The latter are obtained in a second way\nfrom Verlinde's formula for vertex operator superalgebras. Finally, using again\nthe theory of vertex algebra extensions, we find all simple modules and their\nfusion rules of the parafermionic coset $C_k = \\text{Com}\\left(V_L,\nL_k\\left(\\mathfrak{osp}(1 | 2)\\right)\\right)$ where $V_L$ is the lattice vertex\noperator algebra of the lattice $L=\\sqrt{2k}\\mathbb{Z}$.\n", "  INTRODUCTION: The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) serve\nas the accepted standard to monitor treatment efficacy in lung cancer. However,\nthe time intervals between consecutive computerized tomography scans might be\ntoo long to allow early identification of treatment failure. This study\nexamines the use of breath sampling to monitor responses to anticancer\ntreatments in patients with advanced lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 143\nbreath samples were collected from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer. The\nexhaled breath signature, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nand a nanomaterial-based array of sensors, was correlated with the response to\ntherapy assessed by RECIST: complete response, partial response, stable\ndisease, or progressive disease. RESULTS: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\nanalysis identified three volatile organic compounds as significantly\nindicating disease control (PR/stable disease), with one of them also\nsignificantly discriminating PR/stable disease from progressive disease. The\nnanoarray had the ability to monitor changes in tumor response across therapy,\nalso indicating any lack of further response to therapy. When one-sensor\nanalysis was used, 59% of the follow-up samples were identified correctly.\nThere was 85% success in monitoring disease control (stable disease/partial\nresponse). CONCLUSION: Breath analysis, using mainly the nanoarray, may serve\nas a surrogate marker for the response to systemic therapy in lung cancer. As a\nmonitoring tool, it can provide the oncologist with a quick bedside method of\nidentifying a lack of response to an anticancer treatment. This may allow\nquicker recognition than does the current RECIST analysis. Early recognition of\ntreatment failure could improve patient care.\n", "  Gravitational instabilities (GIs) are most likely a fundamental process\nduring the early stages of protoplanetary disc formation. Recently, there have\nbeen detections of spiral features in young, embedded objects that appear\nconsistent with GI-driven structure. It is crucial to perform hydrodynamic and\nradiative transfer simulations of gravitationally unstable discs in order to\nassess the validity of GIs in such objects, and constrain optimal targets for\nfuture observations. We utilise the radiative transfer code LIME to produce\ncontinuum emission maps of a $0.17\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ self-gravitating\nprotosolar-like disc. We note the limitations of using LIME as is and explore\nmethods to improve upon the default gridding. We use CASA to produce synthetic\nobservations of 270 continuum emission maps generated across different\nfrequencies, inclinations and dust opacities. We find that the spiral structure\nof our protosolar-like disc model is distinguishable across the majority of our\nparameter space after 1 hour of observation, and is especially prominent at\n230$\\,$GHz due to the favourable combination of angular resolution and\nsensitivity. Disc mass derived from the observations is sensitive to the\nassumed dust opacities and temperatures, and therefore can be underestimated by\na factor of at least 30 at 850$\\,$GHz and 2.5 at 90$\\,$GHz. As a result, this\neffect could retrospectively validate GIs in discs previously thought not\nmassive enough to be gravitationally unstable, which could have a significant\nimpact on the understanding of the formation and evolution of protoplanetary\ndiscs.\n", "  The exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for atoms, molecules and\nextended systems continues to be a \"Holy Grail\" problem for the field of atomic\nand molecular physics since inception. Recently, breakthroughs have been made\nin the development of hardware- efficient quantum optimizers and coherent Ising\nmachines capable of simulating hundreds of interacting spins through an\nIsing-type Hamiltonian. One of the most vital questions associated with these\nnew devices is: \"Can these machines be used to perform electronic structure\ncalculations?\" In this study, we discuss the general standard procedure used by\nthese devices and show that there is an exact mapping between the electronic\nstructure Hamiltonian and the Ising Hamiltonian. The simulation results of the\ntransformed Ising Hamiltonian for H2, He2, HeH+, and LiH molecules match the\nexact numerical calculations. This demonstrates that one can map the molecular\nHamiltonian to an Ising-type Hamiltonian which could easily be implemented on\ncurrently available quantum hardware.\n", "  Jets, whatever small (e.g. spicules) or large (e.g. macrospicules) their\nsize, may play a key role in momentum and energy transport from photosphere to\nchromosphere and at least to the low corona. Here, we investigate the\nproperties of abundant, large-scale dynamic jets observable in the solar\natmosphere: the macrospicules (MS). These jets are observationally more\ndistinct phenomena than their little, and perhaps more ubiquitous, cousins, the\nspicules. Investigation of long-term variation of the properties of\nmacrospicules may help to a better understanding of their underlying physics of\ngeneration and role in coronal heating. Taking advantage of the high temporal\nand spatial resolution of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a new dataset, with\nseveral hundreds of macrospicules, was constructed encompassing a period of\nobservations over six years. Here, we analyse the measured properties and\nrelations between these properties of macrospicules as function of time during\nthe observed time interval. We found that cross-correlations of several of\nthese macrospicule properties display a strong oscillatory pattern. Next,\nwavelet analysis is used to provide more detailed information about the\ntemporal behaviour of the various properties of MS. For coronal hole\nmacrospicules, a significant peak is found at around 2-year period. This peak\nalso exists partially or is shifted to longer period, in the case of quiet Sun\nmacrospicules. These observed findings may be rooted in the underlying\nmechanism generating the solar magnetic field, i.e. the global solar dynamo.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to examine the tidal forces occurred in Kiselev\nblack hole surrounded by radiation and dust fluids. It is noted that radial and\nangular component of tidal force change the sign between event and Cauchy\nhorizons. We solve the geodesic deviation equation for radially free falling\nbodies toward Kiselev black holes. We explain the geodesic deviation vector\ngraphically and point out the location of event and Cauchy horizons in it for\nspecific values of radiation and dust parameter.\n", "  This lecture provides an introduction to quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the\nlattice. The continuum limit and Monte Carlo simulations are briefly discussed.\nDifferent facets of QCD are nicely exhibited by the potential of a static quark\nand anti-quark pair and results from lattice calculations of this quantity will\nbe presented.\n", "  The paper focuses on aspects of the measurement problem introducing quantum\nstates (q-states) for measured and measuring systems. The link between\nnon-interacting and interacting quantum systems is first look at. For two\nindependent partite systems logical sums A+B stand for non-interacting\nq-systems; while a direct product space AxB gathers interacting states. However\nthis latter should support physical q-states with base states that do not\nseparately belong to either A nor B; the latter correspond to bridge states,\nnamely entangled states that can perform as links (bridges) between A+B and AxB\ndomains. Bridge states at laboratory space open possibilities to describe\ntransport in quantized amounts of energy and angular momentum. These link bases\nsustain entanglements of different kinds. Interactions bring in quantized\nelectromagnetic (em) fields. Matter sustained q-states entangled to\nem-sustained q-states open bridges to transport information between matter and\nradiation.\n", "  The current work is done to see which artery has more chance of having\ncardiovascular diseases by measuring value of pressure gradient in the common\ncarotid artery (CCA) and ascending aorta according to age and gender. Pressure\ngradient is determined in the CCA and ascending aorta of presumed healthy\nvolunteers, having age between 10 and 60 years. A real 2D model of both aorta\nand common carotid artery is constructed for different age groups using\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD). Pressure gradient of both the arteries are\ncalculated and compared for different age groups and gender. It is found that\nwith increase in diameter of common carotid artery and ascending aorta with\nadvancing age pressure gradient decreases. The value of pressure gradient of\naorta is found less than common carotid artery in both cases of age and gender.\n", "  Measuring the magnetoresistance (MR) of ultraclean {\\it GaAs} two-dimensional\nholes in a large $r_s$ range of 20-50, two striking behaviors in relation to\nthe spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerge in response to strong electron-electron\ninteraction. First, in exact correspondence to the zero-field\nmetal-to-insulator transition (MIT), the sign of the MR switches from being\npositive in the metallic regime to being negative in the insulating regime when\nthe carrier density crosses the critical density $p_c$ of MIT ($r_s\\sim 39$).\nSecond, as the SOC-driven correction $\\Delta\\rho$ to the MR decreases with\nreducing carrier density (or the in-plane wave vector), it exhibits an upturn\nin the close proximity just above $p_c$ where $r_s$ is beyond 30, indicating a\nsubstantially enhanced SOC effect. This peculiar behavior echoes with a trend\nof delocalization long suspected for the SOC-interaction interplay. Meanwhile,\nfor $p<p_c$ or $r_s>40$, in contrast to the common belief that a magnet field\nenhances Wigner crystallization, the negative MR is likely linked to enhanced\ninteraction.\n", "  The importance of calculating pressure profiles across liquid interfaces is\nincreasingly gaining recognition, and efficient methods for the calculation of\nlong-range contributions are fundamental in addressing systems with a large\nnumber of charges. Here, we show how to compute the local pressure contribution\nfor mesh-based Ewald methods, retaining the typical N log N scaling as a\nfunction of the lattice nodes N. This is a considerable improvement on existing\nmethods, which include approximating the electrostatic contribution using a\nlarge cut-off and the, much slower, Ewald calculation. As an application, we\ncalculate the contribution to the pressure profile across the water/vapour\ninterface, coming from different molecular layers, both including and removing\nthe effect of thermal capillary waves. We compare the total pressure profile\nwith the one obtained using the cutoff approximation for the calculation of the\nstresses, showing that the stress distribution obtained by the Harasima and\nIrving-Kirkwood are quite similar and shifted with respect to each other at\nmost 0.05~nm.\n", "  In the first-order formulation, general relativity could be formally viewed\nas the topological $BF$ theory with a specific constraint, the Plebanski\nconstraint. $BF$ theory is expected to be the classical limit of the\nCrane-Yetter~(CY) topological state sum. In the Euclidean case, the Plebanski\nconstraint could be lifted in an elegant way to a quantum version in the CY\nstate sum, called the simplicity condition. The constrained state sum is known\nas the Barrett-Crane~(BC) model. In this note we investigate this condition\nfrom the topological field theory side. Since the condition is in fact imposed\non the faces, we want to understand it from the viewpoint of the surface\ntheory. Essentially this condition could be thought of as resulting from the\nboundary-bulk dualtiy, or more precisely from the recent \"bulk=center\"\nproposal. In the language of topological phases, it corresponds to the diagonal\nanyon condensation, with the BC model being the condensed phase.\n  The CY state sum, and correspondingly the BC model, is usually constructed\nwith a modular tensor category~(MTC) from representations of a quantum group at\nroots of unity. The category of representations of quantum group and that of\nmodules of the corresponding affine Lie algebra are known to be equivalent as\nMTCs. This equivalence, together with the simplicity condition in the BC model,\nguarantees the construction of a full 2d rational conformal field theory\nthrough the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert formalism. We thus obtain a full-fledged 4d\nquantum geometry, which we name as \"stringy quantum geometry\". Some attracting\nfeatures of such a new geometry are briefly discussed.\n", "  Solvothermal intercalation of ethylenediamine molecules into FeSe separates\nthe layers by 1078 pm and creates a different stacking. FeSe(en)0.3 is not\nsuperconducting although each layer exhibits the stripe-type crystal structure\nand the Fermi surface topology of superconducting FeSe. FeSe(en)0.3 requires\nelectron-doping for high-Tc similar to monolayers of FeSe@SrTiO3, whose much\nhigher Tc may arise from the proximity of the oxide surface.\n", "  Direct impact excitation by precipitating electrons is believed to be the\nmain source of 630.0 nm emissions in the cusp ionosphere. However, this paper\ninvestigates a different source, 630.0 emissions caused by thermally excited\natomic oxygen O$(^{1}$D) when high electron temperature prevail in the cusp. On\n22 January 2012 and 14 January 2013, the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific\nAssociation (EISCAT) radar on Svalbard measured electron temperature\nenhancements exceeding 3000 K near magnetic noon in the cusp ionosphere over\nSvalbard. The electron temperature enhancements corresponded to electron\ndensity enhancements exceeding $10^{11}$m$^{-3}$ accompanied by intense 630.0\nnm emissions in a field of view common to both the EISCAT Svalbard radar and a\nmeridian scanning photometer. This offered an excellent opportunity to\ninvestigate the role of thermally excited O$(^{1}$D) 630.0 nm emissions in the\ncusp ionosphere. The thermal component was derived from the EISCAT Radar\nmeasurements and compared with optical data. For both events the calculated\nthermal component had a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 to the total\nobserved 630.0 nm intensity which contains both thermal and particle impact\ncomponents. Despite fairly constant solar wind, the calculated thermal\ncomponent intensity fluctuated possibly due to dayside transients in the\naurora.\n", "  In 2008 a sequence of geomagnetic storms occurred triggered by high-speed\nsolar wind streams from coronal holes. Improved estimates of precipitating\nfluxes of energetic electrons are derived from measurements on board the\nNOAA/POES 18 satellite using a new analysis technique. These fluxes are used to\nquantify the direct impact of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) during\nsolar minimum on middle atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) measured from the Aura\nsatellite. During winter, localized longitudinal density enhancements in the OH\nare observed over northern Russia and North America at corrected geomagnetic\nlatitudes poleward of 55$^{\\circ}$. Although the northern Russia OH enhancement\nis closely associated with increased EEP at these longitudes, the strength and\nlocation of the North America enhancement appear to be unrelated to EEP. This\nOH density enhancement is likely due to vertical motion induced by atmospheric\nwave dynamics that transports air rich in atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen\ndownward into the middle atmosphere, where it plays a role in the formation of\nOH. In the Southern Hemisphere, localized enhancements of the OH density over\nWest Antarctica can be explained by a combination of enhanced EEP due to the\nlocal minimum in Earth's magnetic field strength and atmospheric dynamics. Our\nfindings suggest that even during solar minimum, there is substantial\nEEP-driven OH production. However, to quantify this effect, a detailed\nknowledge of where and when the precipitation occurs is required in the context\nof the background atmospheric dynamics.\n", "  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a commonly used protocol for data\ntransmission in small embedded systems. UDP as such is unreliable and packet\nlosses can occur. The achievable data rates can suffer if optimal packet sizes\nare not used. The alternative, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) guarantees\nthe ordered delivery of data and automatically adjusts transmission to match\nthe capability of the transmission link. Nevertheless UDP is often favored over\nTCP due to its simplicity, small memory and instruction footprints. Both UDP\nand TCP are implemented in all larger operating systems and commercial embedded\nframeworks. In addition UDP also supported on a variety of small hardware\nplatforms such as Digital Signal Processors (DSP) Field Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGA). This is not so common for TCP. This paper describes how high\nspeed UDP based data transmission with very low packet error ratios was\nachieved. The near-reliable communications link is used in a data acquisition\n(DAQ) system for the next generation of extremely intense neutron source,\nEuropean Spallation Source. This paper presents measurements of UDP performance\nand reliability as achieved by employing several optimizations. The\nmeasurements were performed on Xeon E5 based CentOS (Linux) servers. The\nmeasured data rates are very close to the 10 Gb/s line rate, and zero packet\nloss was achieved. The performance was obtained utilizing a single processor\ncore as transmitter and a single core as receiver. The results show that\nsupport for transmitting large data packets is a key parameter for good\nperformance.\n  Optimizations for throughput are: MTU, packet sizes, tuning Linux kernel\nparameters, thread affinity, core locality and efficient timers.\n", "  The transition from laminar to turbulent flow has been a notorious riddle in\nfluid dynamics since the nineteenth century. Hydrodynamic instabilities were\nregarded as a cause for the onset of turbulence, but their theoretical\ninvestigation led to paradoxical results. I focus on studies about the\ninstability of laminar boundary-layer flow along a flat plate. The experimental\ndiscovery of boundary-layer oscillations (Tollmien-Schlichting waves) in the\nUSA during World War II vindicated a long-disputed theory developed in Germany\nin the 1920s and 1930s. However, the instability which causes these\noscillations marks only the initial phase of the onset of turbulence;\nhigher-order instabilities had to be assumed in order to extend the analysis to\nthe regions of the transition zone where more complex phenomena (such as\n\"turbulent spots\") mark the onset of turbulence. There is still no theory to\ndescribe these processes in a satisfactory manner. The emphasis on the\nfundamental character of the problem, however, tends to obscure the practical\ninterests which motivated the study of boundary-layer instabilities throughout\nits long history. The disputed theories played a role in the quest for \"laminar\nairfoils\" and other practical applications. Theory and practice are entangled\nmore intimately than it would appear from the rhetoric about the fundamental\ncharacter of the \"turbulence problem\".\n", "  Cerium dioxide (CeO2) thin films were deposited by atomic layer deposition\n(ALD) on both Si and TiN substrates. The ALD growth produces CeO2 cubic\npolycrystalline films on both substrates. However, the films show a\npreferential orientation along <200> crystallographic direction for CeO2/Si or\n<111> for CeO2/TiN. In correspondence, we measure a relative concentration of\nCe3+ equals to 22.0% in CeO2/Si and around 18% in CeO2/TiN, by X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. Such values indicate the presence of oxygen\nvacancies in the films. Our results extend the knowledge on the structural and\nchemical properties of ALD-deposited CeO2 either on Si or TiN substrates,\nunderlying films differences and similarities, thus contributing to boost the\nuse of CeO2 through ALD deposition as foreseen in a wide number of\napplications.\n", "  Using electrical detection of a strongly coupled spin-photon system comprised\nof a microwave cavity mode and two magnetic samples, we demonstrate the long\ndistance manipulation of spin currents. This distant control is not limited by\nthe spin diffusion length, instead depending on the interplay between the local\nand global properties of the coupled system, enabling systematic spin current\ncontrol over large distance scales (several centimeters in this work). This\nflexibility opens the door to improved spin current generation and manipulation\nfor cavity spintronic devices.\n", "  The conformable time fractional Jimbo-Miwa and Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations\nare solved by the generalized form of the Kudryashov method. A simple\ncompatible wave transformation is employed to reduce the dimension of the\nequations to one. The predicted solution is of the form of a rational\nexpression of two finite series at both the numerator and the denominator. The\nterms of both series are of the powers of some functions having exponential\nexpressions satisfying a particular ODE. The exact solutions are expressed\nexplicitly in terms of powers of some exponential functions in form of rational\nexpressions.\n", "  We propose an Eulerian thermodynamically compatible model for ideal\nplasticity of crystalline solids treated as a material flow through an\nadjustable crystal lattice space. The model is based on the additive splitting\nof the velocity gradient into the crystal lattice part and the plastic part.\nThe approach extends a Gibbs-potential-based formulation developed by Rajagopal\nand Srinivasa for obtaining the response functions for elasto-visco-plastic\ncrystals. The framework makes constitutive assumptions for two scalar\nfunctions: the Gibbs potential and the rate of dissipation. The constitutive\nequations relating the stress to kinematical quantities is then determined\nusing the condition that the rate of dissipation is maximal providing that the\nrelevant constraints are met. The proposed model is applied to\nthree-dimensional micropillar compression, and its features, both on the level\nof modelling and computer simulations, are discussed and compared to relevant\nstudies.\n", "  A new type of diode that is made entirely of electrically excitable muscle\ncells and nonexcitable fibroblast cells is designed, fabricated, and\ncharacterized. These two cell types in a rectangular pattern allow the signal\ninitiated on the excitable side to pass to the nonexcitable side, and not in\nthe opposite direction.\n", "  In this work we compute all relevant contributions stemming from the\neconomical 3-3-1 model to the muon magnetic moment and the lepton flavor\nviolation decay $\\mu \\rightarrow e\\gamma$. Using the current bounds on these\nphenomena, we derive lower limits on the scale of symmetry breaking of the\nmodel. Moreover, taking into account existing limits from meson and collider\nstudies we show that there is still room for a possible signal in $\\mu\n\\rightarrow e\\gamma$ in the near future.\n"]}
