It is shown that the\ngauge-rotated $H_3$ Hamiltonian as well as one of the integrals, when written\nin terms of the invariants of the Coxeter group $H_3$, is in algebraic form: it\nhas polynomial coefficients in front of derivatives. The Hamiltonian has\ninfinitely-many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces in polynomials, they\nform the infinite flag with the characteristic vector $\\vec \\al\\ =\\ (1,2,3)$.\nOne among possible integrals is found (of the second order) as well as its\nalgebraic form. A hidden algebra of the $H_3$ Hamiltonian is determined. It is\nan infinite-dimensional, finitely-generated algebra of differential operators\npossessing finite-dimensional representations characterized by a generalized\nGauss decomposition property. A quasi-exactly-solvable integrable\ngeneralization of the model is obtained. A discrete integrable model on the\nuniform lattice in a space of $H_3$-invariants \"polynomially\"-isospectral to\nthe quantum $H_3$ model is defined.\n", "  The quantum $H_4$ integrable system is a 4D system with rational potential\nrelated to the non-crystallographic root system $H_4$ with 600-cell symmetry.\nIt is shown that the gauge-rotated $H_4$ Hamiltonian as well as one of the\nintegrals, when written in terms of the invariants of the Coxeter group $H_4$,\nis in algebraic form: it has polynomial coefficients in front of derivatives.\nAny eigenfunctions is a polynomial multiplied by ground-state function\n(factorization property). Spectra corresponds to one of the anisotropic\nharmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian has infinitely-many finite-dimensional\ninvariant subspaces in polynomials, they form the infinite flag with the\ncharacteristic vector $\\vec \\al\\ =\\ (1,5,8,12)$.\n", "  It is shown that the $E_8$ trigonometric Olshanetsky-Perelomov Hamiltonian,\nwhen written in terms of the Fundamental Trigonometric Invariants (FTI), is in\nalgebraic form, i.e., has polynomial coefficients, and preserves two infinite\nflags of polynomial spaces marked by the Weyl (co)-vector and $E_8$ highest\nroot (both in the basis of simple roots) as characteristic vectors. The\nexplicit form of the Hamiltonian in new variables has been obtained both by\ndirect calculation and by means of the orbit function technique. It is shown a\ntriangularity of the Hamiltonian in the bases of orbit functions and of\nalgebraic monomials ordered through Weyl heights. Examples of first\neigenfunctions are presented.\n", "  We show that for a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there exist observables\nthat induce a tensor product structure such that the entanglement properties of\nany pure state can be tailored. In particular, we provide an explicit, finite\nmethod for constructing observables in an unstructured d-dimensional system so\nthat an arbitrary known pure state has any Schmidt decomposition with respect\nto an induced bipartite tensor product structure. In effect, this article\ndemonstrates that in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, entanglement\nproperties can always be shifted from the state to the observables and all pure\nstates are equivalent as entanglement resources in the ideal case of complete\ncontrol of observables.\n", "  The transport coefficients of a granular fluid driven by a stochastic bath\nwith friction are obtained by solving the inelastic Enskog kinetic equation\nfrom the Chapman-Enskog method. The heat and momentum fluxes as well as the\ncooling rate are determined to first order in the deviations of the\nhydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state.\nSince the collisional cooling cannot be compensated locally for the heat\nproduced by the external driving force, the reference distribution $f^{(0)}$\n(zeroth-order approximation) depends on time through its dependence on\ntemperature. This fact gives rise to conceptual and practical difficulties not\npresent in the undriven case. On the other hand, to simplify the analysis and\ngiven that we are interested in computing transport in the first order of\ndeviations from the reference state, the steady-state conditions are considered\nto get explicit forms for the transport coefficients and the cooling rate. A\ncomparison with recent molecular dynamics simulations for driven granular\nfluids shows an excellent agreement for the kinematic viscosity although some\ndiscrepancies are observed for the longitudinal viscosity and the thermal\ndiffusivity at large densities. Finally, a linear stability analysis of the\nhydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state is\nperformed. As expected, no instabilities are found thanks to the presence of\nthe external bath.\n", "  The quantum mechanics of two Coulomb charges on a plane $(e_1, m_1)$ and\n$(e_2, m_2)$ subject to a constant magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the\nplane is considered. Four integrals of motion are explicitly indicated. It is\nshown that for two physically-important particular cases, namely that of two\nparticles of equal Larmor frequencies, ${e_c} \\propto\n\\frac{e_1}{m_1}-\\frac{e_2}{m_2}=0$ (e.g. two electrons) and one of a neutral\nsystem (e.g. the electron - positron pair, Hydrogen atom) at rest (the\ncenter-of-mass momentum is zero) some outstanding properties occur. They are\nthe most visible in double polar coordinates in CMS $(R, \\phi)$ and relative\n$(\\rho, \\varphi)$ coordinate systems: (i) eigenfunctions are factorizable, all\nfactors except one with the explicit $\\rho$-dependence are found analytically,\nthey have definite relative angular momentum, (ii) dynamics in $\\rho$-direction\nis the same for both systems, it corresponds to a funnel-type potential and it\nhas hidden $sl(2)$ algebra; at some discrete values of dimensionless magnetic\nfields $b \\leq 1$, (iii) particular integral(s) occur, (iv) the hidden $sl(2)$\nalgebra emerges in finite-dimensional representation, thus, the system becomes\n{\\it quasi-exactly-solvable} and (v) a finite number of polynomial\neigenfunctions in $\\rho$ appear. Nine families of eigenfunctions are presented\nexplicitly.\n", "  Conformally compactified (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime may be\nidentified with the projective light cone in (4+2)-dimensional spacetime. In\nthe latter spacetime the special conformal group acts via rotations and boosts,\nand conformal inversion acts via reflection in a single coordinate.\nHexaspherical coordinates facilitate dimensional reduction of Maxwell\nelectromagnetic field strength tensors to (3+1) from (4 + 2) dimensions. Here\nwe focus on the operation of conformal inversion in different\ncoordinatizations, and write some useful equations. We then write a conformal\ninvariant and a pseudo-invariant in terms of field strengths; the\npseudo-invariant in (4+2) dimensions takes a new form. Our results advance the\nstudy of general nonlinear conformal-invariant electrodynamics based on\nnonlinear constitutive equations.\n", "  Numerical simulations of the shallow water equations on rotating spheres\nproduce mixtures of robust vortices and alternating zonal jets, as seen in the\natmospheres of the gas giant planets. However, simulations that include\nRayleigh friction invariably produce a sub-rotating (retrograde) equatorial jet\nfor Jovian parameter regimes, whilst observations of Jupiter show a\nsuper-rotating (prograde) equatorial jet that has persisted over several\ndecades. Super-rotating equatorial jets have recently been obtained in shallow\nwater simulations that include a Newtonian relaxation of perturbations to the\nlayer thickness to model radiative cooling to space, and in simulations of the\nthermal shallow water equations that include a similar relaxation term in their\ntemperature equation. Simulations of global quasigeostrophic forms of these\ndifferent models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as the parent\nmodels, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for setting the direction\nlies within quasigeostrophic theory. We provide such a mechanism by calculating\nthe effective force acting on the thickness-weighted zonal mean flow due to the\ndecay of an equatorially trapped Rossby wave. Decay due to Newtonian cooling\ncreates an eastward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with the\nformation of a super-rotating equatorial jet, while decay due to Rayleigh\nfriction leads to a westward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with\nthe formation of a sub-rotating equatorial jet. In both cases the meridionally\nintegrated zonal mean of the absolute zonal momentum is westward, consistent\nwith the standard result that Rossby waves carry westward pseudomomentum, but\nthis does not preclude the zonal mean flow being eastward on and close to the\nequator.\n", "  This work presents a modified Kedem-Katchalsky equations for osmosis through\nnano-pore. osmotic reflection coefficient of a solute was found to be chiefly\naffected by the entrance of the pore while filtration reflection coefficient\ncan be affected by both the entrance and the internal structure of the pore.\nUsing an analytical method, we get the quantitative relationship between\nosmotic reflection coefficient and the molecule size. The model is verified by\ncomparing the theoretical results with the reported experimental data of\naquaporin osmosis. Our work is expected to pave the way for a better\nunderstanding of osmosis in bio-system and to give us new ideas in designing\nnew membranes with better performance.\n", "  The Schroedinger equation for two electrons in the field of a charged fixed\ncenter $Z$ is solved with the Lagrange mesh method for charges close to the\ncritical charge $Z_{cr}$. We confirm the value of the nuclear critical charge\n$Z_{cr}$ recently calculated in Estienne et al. {\\em Phys. Rev. Lett. \\bf 112},\n173001 (2014) to 11 decimal digits using an inhomogeneous (non-uniform)\nthree-dimensional lattice of size $70 \\times 70 \\times 20$. We show that the\nground state energy for H$^-$ is accurate to 14 decimals on the lattice $50\n\\times 50 \\times 40$ in comparison with the highly accurate result by\nNakashima-Nakatsuji, {\\it J. Chem. Phys. \\bf 127}, 224104 (2007).\n", "  The potential of the $A_2$ quantum elliptic model (3-body Calogero-Moser\nelliptic model) is defined by the pairwise three-body interaction through\nWeierstrass $\\wp$-function and has a single coupling constant. A change of\nvariables has been found, which are $A_2$ elliptic invariants, such that the\npotential becomes a rational function, while the flat space metric as well as\nits associated vector are polynomials in two variables. It is shown that the\nmodel possesses the hidden $sl(3)$ algebra - the Hamiltonian is an element of\nthe universal enveloping algebra $U_{sl(3)}$ for arbitrary coupling constant -\nthus, it is equivalent to $sl(3)$-quantum Euler-Arnold top. The integral, in a\nform of the third order differential operator with polynomial, is constructed\nexplicitly, being also an element of $U_{sl(3)}$. It is shown that there exists\na discrete sequence of the coupling constants for which a finite number of\npolynomial eigenfunctions, up to a (non-singular) gauge factor occur.\n  The potential of the $G_2$ quantum elliptic model (3-body Wolfes elliptic\nmodel) is defined by the pairwise and three-body interactions through\nWeierstrass $\\wp$-function and has two coupling constants. A change of\nvariables has been found, which are $G_2$ elliptic invariants, such that the\npotential becomes a rational function, while the flat space metric as well as\nits associated vector are polynomials in two variables. It is shown the model\npossesses the hidden $g^{(2)}$ algebra. It is shown that there exists a\ndiscrete family of the coupling constants for which a finite number of\npolynomial eigenfunctions up to a (non-singular) gauge factor occur.\n", "  The research works on the biological effects of electromagnetic (EM)\nradiation have increased globally. Computer simulation models were developed to\nassess exposure of square, rectangular, pyramidal, and cylindrical water\ncontainers to microwave radiation at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz. The development\nof the models included determination of EM field distribution and the resulting\nspecific absorption rate (SAR) in the stored water. These models employed CST\nSTUDIO SUITE 2014 package to solve EM field equations by applying the\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The effect of frequency, packaging\nshape, and polarization on SAR induced in water was determined. High electric\nfield and point SAR were obtained over the whole azimuth and elevation angles\nrange in the pyramidal container model. The highest values of SAR were induced\nin water at the sharp edges of the four water container models. The order of\nthe effect on total SAR and maximum point SAR is cylindrical < square <\nrectangular < pyramidal model at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz for both vertical and\nhorizontal polarizations. It can be concluded that the variation in the\npackaging shape of the containers, polarization, irradiation geometry, and\nfrequency. In addition, the sharp edges of the container models significantly\naffect the calculation and distribution of electric and magnetic fields and SAR\nvalues induced in the stored water, which in turn could cause variations in the\nnon-thermal effects of the electromagnetic fields in the stored water.\n", "  An Exactly-Solvable (ES) potential on the sphere $S^n$ is reviewed and the\nrelated Quasi-Exactly-Solvable (QES) potential is found and studied. Mapping\nthe sphere to a simplex it is found that the metric (of constant curvature) is\nin polynomial form, and both the ES and the QES potentials are rational\nfunctions. Their hidden algebra is $gl_n$ in a finite-dimensional\nrepresentation realized by first order differential operators acting on $RP^n$.\nIt is shown that variables in the Schr\\\"odinger eigenvalue equation can be\nseparated in spherical coordinates and a number of the integrals of the second\norder exists assuring the complete integrability. The QES system is\ncompletely-integrable for $n=2$ and non-maximally superintegrable for $n\\ge 3$.\nThere is no separable coordinate system in which it is exactly solvable. We\npoint out that by taking contractions of superintegrable systems, such as\ninduced by Wigner-In\\\"on\\\"u Lie algebra contractions, we can find other QES\nsuperintegrable systems, and we illustrate this by contracting our $S^n$ system\nto a QES non-maximal superintegrable system on Euclidean space $E^n$, an\nextension of the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potential.\n", "  The bivariate distribution of degrees of adjacent vertices (degree-degree\ndistribution) is an important network characteristic defining the statistical\ndependencies between degrees of adjacent vertices. We show the asymptotic\ndegree-degree distribution of a sparse inhomogeneous random intersection graph\nand discuss its relation to the clustering and power law properties of the\ngraph.\n", "  We consider the integrable dilute Temperley-Lieb (dTL) O($n=1$) loop model on\na semi-infinite strip of finite width $L$. In the analogy with the\nTemperley-Lieb (TL) O($n=1$) loop model the ground state eigenvector of the\ntransfer matrix is studied by means of a set of $q$-difference equations,\nsometimes called the $q$KZ equations. We compute some ground state components\nof the transfer matrix of the dTL model, and show that all ground state\ncomponents can be recovered for arbitrary $L$ using the $q$KZ equation and\ncertain recurrence relation. The computations are done for generic open\nboundary conditions.\n", "  This is the second part of our study of the ground state eigenvector of the\ntransfer matrix of the dilute Temperley-Lieb loop model with the loop weight\n$n=1$ on a semi infinite strip of width $L$. We focus here on the computation\nof the normalization (otherwise called the sum rule) $Z_L$ of the ground state\neigenvector, which is also the partition function of the critical site\npercolation model. The normalization $Z_L$ is a symmetric polynomial in the\ninhomogeneities of the lattice $z_1,..,z_L$. This polynomial satisfies several\nrecurrence relations which we solve independently in terms of Jacobi-Trudi like\ndeterminants. Thus we provide a few determinantal expressions for the\nnormalization $Z_L$.\n", "  We report the observation of tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for ultracold\n$^{87}$Rb atoms in hyperfine spin-1 states. Different from most earlier\nexperiments where atomic SOC of pseudo-spin-1/2 are synthesized with Raman\ncoupling lasers, the scheme we demonstrate employs a gradient magnetic field\n(GMF) with ground state atoms and is immune to atomic spontaneous emission. The\neffect of the SOC is confirmed through the studies of: 1) the collective dipole\noscillation of an atomic condensate in a harmonic trap after the synthesized\nSOC is abruptly turned on; and 2) the minimum energy state at a finite\nadiabatically adjusted momentum when the SOC strength is slowly ramped up. The\ncoherence properties of the spinor condensates remain very good after\ninteracting with modulating GMFs, which prompts the enthusiastic claim that our\nwork provides a new repertoire for synthesized gauge fields aimed at quantum\nsimulation studies with cold atoms.\n", "  We describe a method for simulating the real time evolution of extended\nquantum systems in two dimensions. The method combines the benefits of\nintegrability and matrix product states in one dimension to avoid several\nissues that hinder other applications of tensor based methods in 2D. In\nparticular it can be extended to infinitely long cylinders. As an example\napplication we present results for quantum quenches in the 2D quantum (2+1\ndimensional) Ising model. In quenches that cross a phase boundary we find that\nthe return probability shows non-analyticities in time.\n", "  Uncertainty relation is one of the fundamental building blocks of quantum\ntheory. Nevertheless, the traditional uncertainty relations do not fully\ncapture the concept of incompatible observables. Here we present a stronger\nSchr\\\"odinger-like uncertainty relation, which is stronger than the relation\nrecently derived by L. Maccone and A. K. Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 (2014)\n260401]. Furthermore, we give an additive uncertainty relation which holds for\nthree incompatible observables, which is stronger than the relation newly\nobtained by S. Kechrimparis and S. Weigert [Phys. Rev. A 90 (2014) 062118] and\nthe simple extension of the Schr\\\"odinger uncertainty relation.\n", "  In this work we study the phase structure of skew symplectic sigma models,\nwhich are a certain class of two-dimensional N = (2,2) non-Abelian gauged\nlinear sigma models. At low energies some of them flow to non-linear sigma\nmodels with Calabi-Yau target spaces, which emerge from non-Abelian strong\ncoupling dynamics. The observed phase structure results in a non-trivial\nduality proposal among skew symplectic sigma models and connects non-complete\nintersection Calabi-Yau threefolds, that are non-birational among another, in a\ncommon quantum Kahler moduli space. As a consequence we find non-trivial\nidentifications of spectra of topological B-branes, which from a modern\nalgebraic geometry perspective imply derived equivalences among Calabi-Yau\nvarieties. To further support our proposals, we calculate the two sphere\npartition function of skew symplectic sigma models to determine geometric\ninvariants, which confirm the anticipated Calabi-Yau threefold phases. We show\nthat the two sphere partition functions of a pair of dual skew symplectic sigma\nmodels agree in a non-trivial fashion. To carry out these calculations, we\ndevelop a systematic approach to study higher-dimensional Mellin-Barnes type\nintegrals. In particular, these techniques admit the evaluation of two sphere\npartition functions for gauged linear sigma models with higher rank gauge\ngroups, but are applicable in other contexts as well.\n", "  We use epitaxial strain to shift the energy of the two-dimensional Ag(111)\nsurface states of Ag islands on Nb(110) substrates, allowing to spatially tune\nthe bottom of the surface-state band $E_{\\rm SS}$ through the Fermi level\n$E_{\\rm F}$. Bulk and surface-state contributions to the Ag(111) local density\nof states (LDOS) can be separated with scanning tunneling spectroscopy. For\nthick islands ($\\approx$\\, 20 nm), the Ag surface states are decoupled from the\nAg bulk states via orthogonality, and the superconductive gap induced by\nproximity to Nb is due to bulk states only. However, for thin islands (3-4 nm),\nsurface-state electrons develop superconducting correlations as identified by a\ncomplete energy gap in the LDOS when $E_{\\rm F}$ is smaller than but close to\n$E_{\\rm F}$. The induced superconductivity in this case is of two-band nature\nand appears to occur when the surface-state wave function reaches down to the\nAg/Nb interface.\n", "  Warm atomic vapor quantum memories are simple and robust, yet suffer from a\nnumber of parasitic processes which produce excess noise. For operating in a\nsingle-photon regime precise filtering of the output light is essential. Here\nwe report a combination of magnetically tuned absorption and Faraday filters,\nboth light-direction-insensitive, which stop the driving lasers and attenuate\nspurious fluorescence and four-wave mixing while transmitting narrowband Stokes\nand anti-Stokes photons generated in write-in and readout processes. We\ncharacterize both filters with respect to adjustable working parameters. We\ndemonstrate a significant increase in the signal to noise ratio upon applying\nthe filters seen qualitatively in measurements of correlation between the\nRaman-scattered photons.\n", "  Here we present an alternative approach, requiring only basic tools of\ndifferential geometry. This method was conceived by Kijowski and first\npresented during the IV Marcel Grossman Meeting on General Relativity in Rome\n(1986). It was later published in a generalized form by J. Jezierski, J.\nKijowski in 1987 (Positivity of total energy in general relativity, Physical\nReview D {\\bf 36} (1987), 1041-4). We summarize these results briefly and\npresent a new foliation gauge.\n", "  In a series of two papers, we investigate the large deviations and asymptotic\nbehavior of stochastic models of brain neural networks with random interaction\ncoefficients. In this first paper, we take into account the spatial structure\nof the brain and consider (i) the presence of interaction delays that depend on\nthe distance between cells and (ii) Gaussian random interaction amplitude whose\nmean and variance depend on the neurons positions and scale as the inverse of\nthe network size. We show that the empirical measure satisfies a\nlarge-deviation principle with good rate function reaching its minimum at a\nunique spatially extended probability measure. This result implies averaged\nconvergence of the empirical measure and propagation of chaos. The limit is\ncharacterized through complex non-Markovian implicit equation in which the\nnetwork interaction term is replaced by a non-local Gaussian process whose\nstatistics depend on the solution over the whole neural field.\n", "  Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm\nthat samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA)\nHamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a\ncomparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA\nefficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of\nthis spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the\ngrowing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of\ntunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over\nclassical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze\nonly a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques\napplied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the\nquantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary\ndistribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of\nSQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.\n", "  Rupture is a nonlinear instability resulting in a finite-time singularity as\na fluid layer approaches zero thickness at a point. We study the dynamics of\nrupture in a generalized mathematical model of thin films of viscous fluids\nwith evaporative effects. The governing lubrication model is a fourth-order\nnonlinear parabolic partial differential equation with a non-conservative loss\nterm due to evaporation. Several different types of finite-time singularities\nare observed due to balances between evaporation and surface tension or\nintermolecular forces. Non-self-similar behavior and two classes of\nself-similar rupture solutions are analyzed and validated against high\nresolution PDE simulations.\n", "  We propose a gravitational energy-momentum tensor of the general relativity\nobtained using Noethers theorem. It transforms as a tensor under general\ncoordinate transformations. One of the two indices of the gravitational\nenergy-momentum tensor labels a local Lorentz frame that satisfies the\nenergy-momentum conservation law. The energies for a gravitational wave and a\nFriedmann-Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker universe are calculated as examples.\n", "  Casimir entropy is an important aspect of casimir effect.In this paper,we\nemploy the path integral method to derive the total relation for casimir\nentropy and internal energy of arbitrary shaped objects in the presence of\ntwo,three and four dimensions scalar fields and electromagnetic field.We obtain\nthe casimir entropy and internal energy of two nanoribbon immersed in scalar\nfield and two nanospheres immersed in scalar field and electromagnetic\nfield.The casmir entropy of two nanospheres immersed in the electromagnetic\nfield in small interval of temperature variations,shown a different behavior.\n", "  We study the renormalization group flow of the Luttinger-Ward functional and\nof its two-particle irreducible vertex functions, given a cut-off in the\ntwo-particle interaction. We derive a conserving approximation to the flow and\nrelate it to the fluctuation exchange approximation as well as to\nnon-conserving approximations introduced in an earlier publication ctuation\nexchange approximation as well as to nonconserving approximations introducen\n[J. F. Rentrop, S. G. Jakobs, and V. Meden, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48, 145002\n(2015)]. We apply the different approximate flow equations to the single\nimpurity Anderson model in thermal equilibrium at vanishing temperature.\nNumerical results for the effective mass, the spin susceptibility, the charge\nsusceptibility, and the linear conductance reflect the similarity of the\nmethods to the fluctuation exchange approximation. We find the majority of the\napproximations to deviate stronger from the exact results than one-particle\nirreducible functional renormalization group schemes. However, we identify a\nsimple static two-particle irreducible flow scheme which performs remarkably\nwell and produces an exponential Kondo-like scale in the renormalized level\nposition.\n", "  The theoretical understanding of active matter, which is driven out of\nequilibrium by directed motion, is still fragmental and model oriented.\nStochastic thermodynamics, on the other hand, is a comprehensive theoretical\nframework for driven systems that allows to define fluctuating work and heat.\nWe apply these definitions to active matter, assuming that dissipation can be\nmodelled by effective non-conservative forces. We show that, through the work,\nconjugate extensive and intensive observables can be defined even in\nnon-equilibrium steady states lacking a free energy. As an illustration, we\nderive the expressions for the pressure and interfacial tension of active\nBrownian particles. The latter becomes negative despite the observed stable\nphase separation. We discuss this apparent contradiction, highlighting the role\nof fluctuations, and we offer a tentative explanation.\n", "  Static spin-stripe order and superconductivity were systematically studied in\nLa_2-xBa_xCuO_4 (0.11 - 0.17) at ambient pressure by means of magnetization and\nmuSR experiments. We find that all the investigated La_2-xBa_xCuO_4 samples\nexhibit static spin-stripe order and that the quasi two-dimensional\nsuperconducting (SC) transition temperature T_c1 and the static spin-stripe\norder temperature T_so have very similar values throughout the phase diagram.\nMoreover, the magnetic and the SC properties of the x = 0.155 (LBCO-0.155) and\nx = 0.17 (LBCO-0.17) samples were studied under hydrostatic pressure. As a\nremarkable result, in these bulk cuprate superconductors the three-dimensional\nSC transition temperature T_c and T_so nearly coincide at all pressure\ninvestigated (0 - 2.3 GPa). We also observed a pressure induced transition from\nlong-range spin stripe order to a disordered magnetic state at 1.6 GPa in\nLBCO-0.155, coexisting with a SC state with substantial superfluid density. In\nLBCO-0.17 a disordered magnetic state is present at all p. The present results\nindicate that static magnetic order and SC pairing correlations develop in a\ncooperative fashion in La_2-xBa_xCuO_4, and provide a new route of\nunderstanding the complex interplay between static magnetism and\nsuperconductivity in the stripe phase of cuprates.\n", "  The H.E.S.S. collaboration has reported a high-energy spherically symmetric\ndiffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner 50 pc of the Milky Way, up to ~ 50 TeV.\nHere we propose a leptonic model which provides an alternative to the hadronic\nscenario presented by the H.E.S.S. collaboration, and connects the newly\nreported TeV emission to the Fermi-LAT Galactic center GeV excess. Our model\nrelies on a combination of inverse Compton emission from a population of\nmillisecond pulsars---which can account for the GeV excess---and a supermassive\nblack hole-induced spike of heavy (~ 60 TeV) dark matter particles annihilating\ninto electrons with a sub-thermal cross-section. With an up-to-date\ninterstellar radiation field, as well as a standard magnetic field and\ndiffusion set-up, our model accounts for the spectral morphology of the\ndetected emission. Moreover, we show that the dark matter induced emission\nreproduces the spatial morphology of the H.E.S.S. signal above ~ 10 TeV, while\nwe obtain a slightly more extended component from pulsars at lower energies,\nwhich could be used as a prediction for future H.E.S.S. observations.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to set out the problems of modeling quantum\ncommunication and signal processing where the communication between systems via\na non-Markovian channel. This is a general feature of quantum transmission\nlines. Our ultimate objective is to extend the networks rules that have been\ndeveloped for Markovian models. To this end we recall the Hamiltonian\ndescription of such non-Markov models of transmission lines and their\nquantization. These have occurred in the context of non-quilibrium\nthermodynamics, but our interest is in the transmission lines as carriers of\ninformation rather than heat baths. We show that there is an analytic\nscattering matrix associated with these models and that stability may be\nformulated in terms of the lossless bounded real property. Noting that the\ninput and output fields do not separately satisfy a non-self- demolition\nprinciple, we discuss the rigorous limit in which such models appear Markov and\nso amenable to standard approaches of quantum filtering and control\n", "  We study the application of Kasparov theory to topological insulator systems\nand the bulk-edge correspondence. We consider observable algebras as modelled\nby crossed products, where bulk and edge systems may be linked by a short exact\nsequence. We construct unbounded Kasparov modules encoding the dynamics of the\ncrossed product. We then link bulk and edge Kasparov modules using the Kasparov\nproduct. Because of the anti-linear symmetries that occur in topological\ninsulator models, real $C^*$-algebras and $KKO$-theory must be used.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of freely expanding liquid sheets prepared with\nfluids with different rheological properties, (i) viscous fluids with a\nzero-shear viscosity $\\eta_0$ in the range $(1-1000) \\, \\mathrm{mPa.s}$ and\n(ii) viscoelastic Maxwell fluids whose elastic modulus, $G_0$, characteristic\nrelaxation time, $\\tau$, and zero-shear viscosity, $\\eta_0=G_0 \\tau$, can be\ntuned over several orders of magnitude. The sheets are produced by impacting a\ndrop of fluid on a small cylindrical solid target. For viscoelastic fluids, we\nshow that, when $\\tau$ is shorter than the typical lifetime of the sheet ($\\sim\n10$ ms), the dynamics of the sheet is similar to that of Newtonian viscous\nliquids with equal zero-shear viscosity. In that case, for little viscous\nsamples ($\\eta_0 <\\sim 30$ mPa.s), the maximal expansion of the sheet,\n$d_{\\rm{max}}$, is independent of $\\eta_0$, whereas for more viscous samples,\n$d_{\\rm{max}}$ decreases as $\\eta_0$ increases. We provide a simple model to\naccount for the dependence of the maximal expansion of the sheet with the\nviscosity that is based on an energy balance between inertia, surface tension\nand viscous shear dissipation on the solid target, and which accounts well for\nour experimental data. By contrast, when $\\tau$ is longer than the typical\nlifetime of the sheet, the behavior drastically differs. The sheet expansion is\nstrongly enhanced as compared to that of viscous samples with comparable\nzero-shear viscosity, but is heterogeneous with the occurrence of cracks,\nrevealing the elastic nature of the viscoelastic fluid.\n", "  We establish a relationship between decay centrality and two widely used and\ncomputationally cheaper measures of centrality, namely degree and closeness. We\nshow that for low values of the decay parameter the nodes with maximum decay\ncentrality also have maximum degree, whereas for high values of the decay\nparameter they also maximize closeness. For intermediate values, we provide\nsufficient conditions that allow the comparison of decay centrality of\ndifferent nodes and we show via numerical simulations that in the vast majority\nof networks, the nodes with maximum decay centrality are characterized by a\nthreshold on the decay parameter below which they belong to the set of nodes\nwith maximum degree and above which they belong to the set of nodes with\nmaximum closeness. We also propose a simple rule of thumb that ensures a nearly\noptimal choice with very high probability.\n", "  This letter reports on how the Wilson flow technique can efficaciously kill\nthe short-distance quantum fluctuations of 2- and 3-gluon Green functions,\nremoves the $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$ scale and destroys the transition from the\nconfining non-perturbative to the asymptotically-free perturbative sector.\nAfter the Wilson flow, the behavior of the Green functions with momenta can be\ndescribed in terms of the quasi-classical instanton background. The same\nbehavior also occurs, before the Wilson flow, at low-momenta. This last result\npermits applications as, for instance, the detection of instanton\nphenomenological properties or a cheap lattice calibration.\n", "  The opening of a band gap due to compressive uniaxial strain renders bulk\nHgTe a strong three-dimensional topological insulators with protected gapless\nsurface states at any surface. By employing a six-band k.p model, we determine\nthe spin textures of the topological surface states of strained HgTe using\ntheir close relations with the mirror Chern numbers of the system and the\norbital composition of the surface states. We show that at surfaces with C2v\npoint group symmetry an increase in the strain magnitude triggers a topological\nphase transition where the winding number of the surface state spin texture is\nflipped while the four topological invariants characterizing the bulk band\nstructure of the material are unchanged.\n", "  We express the rules for forming quantum feedback networks using the\nStratonovich form of quantum stochastic calculus rather than the Ito, or SLH\nform. Remarkably the feedback reduction rule implies that we obtain the Schur\ncomplement of the matrix of Stratonovich coupling operators where we short out\nthe internal input/output coefficients.\n", "  A relativistic description of the structure of heavy alkali atoms and\nalkali-like ions using S-spinors and L-spinors has been developed. The core\nwavefunction is defined by a Dirac-Fock calculation using an S-spinors basis.\nThe S-spinor basis is then supplemented by a large set of L-spinors for the\ncalculation of the valence wavefunction in a frozen-core model. The numerical\nstability of the L-spinor approach is demonstrated by computing the energies\nand decay rates of several low-lying hydrogen eigenstates, along with the\npolarizabilities of a $Z=60$ hydrogenic ion. The approach is then applied to\ncalculate the dynamic polarizabilities of the $5s$, $4d$ and $5p$ states of\nSr$^+$. The magic wavelengths at which the Stark shifts between different pairs\nof transitions are zero are computed. Determination of the magic wavelengths\nfor the $5s \\to 4d_{\\frac32}$ and $5s \\to 4d_{\\frac52}$ transitions near\n$417$~nm (near the wavelength for the $5s \\to 5p_j$ transitions) would allow a\ndetermination of the oscillator strength ratio for the $5s \\to 5p_{\\frac12}$\nand $5s \\to 5p_{\\frac32}$ transitions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the planar circular restricted three-body problem in\nthe context of a pseudo-Newtonian approximation. By using the\nFodor-Hoenselaers-Perj\\'es procedure, we perform an expansion in the mass\npotential of a static massive spherical source up to the first non-Newtonian\nterm, giving place to a gravitational potential that includes first-order\ngeneral relativistic effects. With this result, we model a system composed by\ntwo pseudo-Newtonian primaries describing circular orbits around their common\ncenter of mass, and a test particle orbiting the system in the equatorial\nplane. The dynamics of the new system of equations is studied in terms of the\nPoincar\\'e section method and the Lyapunov exponents, where the introduction of\na new parameter $\\epsilon$, allows us to observe the transition from the\nNewtonian to the pseudo-Newtonian regime. We show that when the Jacobian\nconstant is fixed, a chaotic orbit in the Newtonian regime can be either\nchaotic or regular in the pseudo-Newtonian approach. As a general result, we\nfind that most of the pseudo-Newtonian configurations are less stable than\ntheir Newtonian equivalent.\n", "  We investigate wave propagation in rotationally symmetric tubes with a\nperiodic spatial modulation of cross section. Using an asymptotic perturbation\nanalysis, the governing quasi two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation can\nbe reduced into a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion-advection equation.\nAssuming a weak perturbation by the advection term and using projection method,\nin a second step, an equation of motion for traveling waves within such tubes\ncan be derived. Both methods predict properly the nonlinear dependence of the\npropagation velocity on the ratio of the modulation period of the geometry to\nthe intrinsic width of the front, or pulse. As a main feature, we can observe\nfinite intervals of propagation failure of waves induced by the tube's\nmodulation. In addition, using the Fick-Jacobs approach for the highly\ndiffusive limit we show that wave velocities within tubes are governed by an\neffective diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of a\nsingle bottleneck on the period of pulse trains within tubes. We observe period\nchanges by integer fractions dependent on the bottleneck width and the period\nof the entering pulse train.\n", "  We present the possibility of steering the direction of correlations between\nthe off-resonant Raman scattered photons from the angularly multimode atomic\nmemory based on warm rubidium vapors. Using acousto-optic deflectors (AOD)\ndriven by different modulation frequencies we experimentally change the angle\nof incidence of the laser beams on the atomic ensemble. Performing correlations\nmeasurements for various deflection angles we verify that we can choose the\nanti-Stokes light propagation direction independently of the correlated Stokes\nscattered light in the continuous way. As a result we can select the spatial\nmode of photons retrieved from the memory, which may be important for future\ndevelopment of quantum information processing.\n", "  We study numerically the Bloch electron wave-packet dynamics in periodic\npotentials to simulate laser-solid interactions. We introduce a quasi-classical\nmodel in the \\emph{k} space combined with the energy band structure to\nunderstand the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) process occurring in a\nsubcycle timescale. This model interprets the multiple plateau structure in HHG\nspectra well and the linear dependence of cutoff energies on the amplitude of\nvector potential of the laser fields. It also predicts the emission time of\nHHG, which agrees well with the results by solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE). It provides a scheme to reconstruct the energy\ndispersion relations in Brillouin zone and to control the trajectories of HHG\nby varying the shape of laser pulses. This model is instructive for\nexperimental measurements.\n", "  We discuss how one can realize a photonic device that combines synthetic\ndimensions and synthetic magnetic fields with spatially local interactions.\nUsing an array of ring cavities, the angular coordinate around each cavity\nspans the synthetic dimension. The synthetic magnetic field arises as the\nintercavity photon hopping is associated with a change of angular momentum.\nPhoton-photon interactions are local in the periodic angular coordinate around\neach cavity. Experimentally observable consequences of the synthetic magnetic\nfield and of the local interactions are pointed out.\n", "  The development of sensible microscopic models is essential to elucidate the\nnormal-state and superconducting properties of the iron-based superconductors.\nBecause these materials are mostly metallic, a good starting point is an\neffective low-energy model that captures the electronic states near the Fermi\nlevel and their interactions. However, in contrast to cuprates, iron-based\nhigh-$T_{c}$ compounds are multi-orbital systems with Hubbard and Hund\ninteractions, resulting in a rather involved 10-orbital lattice model. Here we\nreview different minimal models that have been proposed to unveil the universal\nfeatures of these systems. We first review minimal models defined solely in the\norbital basis, which focus on a particular subspace of orbitals, or solely in\nthe band basis, which rely only on the geometry of the Fermi surface. The\nformer, while providing important qualitative insight into the role of the\norbital degrees of freedom, do not distinguish between high-energy and\nlow-energy sectors and, for this reason, generally do not go beyond mean-field.\nThe latter allow one to go beyond mean-field and investigate the interplay\nbetween superconducting and magnetic orders as well as Ising-nematic order.\nHowever, they cannot capture orbital-dependent features like spontaneous\norbital order. We then review recent proposals for a minimal model that\noperates in the band basis but fully incorporates the orbital composition and\nsymmetries of the low-energy excitations. We discuss the results of the\nrenormalization group study of such a model, particularly of the interplay\nbetween superconductivity, magnetism, and spontaneous orbital order, and\ncompare theoretical predictions with experiments on iron pnictides and\nchalcogenides. We also discuss the impact of the glide-plane symmetry on the\nlow-energy models, highlighting the key role played by the spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  In this work, we report our study on the THz emission in Fe/Pt magnetic\nheterostructures. We have carried out a comprehensive investigation of THz\nemission from Fe/Pt magnetic heterostructures, employing time-domain THz\nspectroscopy. We reveal that by properly tuning the thickness of Fe or Pt\nlayer, THz emission can be greatly improved in this type of heterostructure. We\nfurther demonstrate that the THz field strength emitted from a newly designed\nmultilayer (Pt/Fe/MgO)$_n$ with n=3 can reach a value of ~1.6 kV/cm, which is\ncomparable to the values from the conventional GaAs antenna with a bias of 4\nkV/cm, and the nonlinear crystals, e.g., 100 micrometer GaP and 2 mm ZnTe. For\nthe first time, the intensity and spectrum of THz wave is demonstrated to be\ntunable by the magnetic field applied on the patterned magnetic Fe/Pt\nheterostructures. These findings thus promise novel approaches to fabricate\npowerful and tunable THz emitters based on magnetic heterostructure.\n", "  We study the scaling with the number of colours, $N_c$, of the weak\namplitudes mediating kaon mixing and decay. We evaluate the amplitudes of the\ntwo relevant current-current operators on the lattice for $N_c=3-7$. We\nconclude that the subleading $1/N_c$ corrections in $\\hat{B}_K$ are small, but\nthose in the $K \\rightarrow \\pi\\pi$ amplitudes are large and fully\nanti-correlated in the $I=0, 2$ isospin channels. We briefly comment on the\nimplications for the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule.\n", "  Offering high-brilliance X-ray beams on micrometer length scales, the\nmicrofocus-SAXS at SSRF BL16B1 was established with a KB mirror system for\nstudying small sample volumes, or probing micro-scopic morphologies. The SAXS\nminimum q value was 0.1nm-1 with a flux of 1.5 * 10^10 photons/s. Two\nposition-resolved scanning experimental methods were combined with\nmicrofocus-SAXS that include STXM and CT. To improve the significant smearing\neffect in the horizontal direction, an effective and easy-to-use desmearing\nprocedure for two-dimensional SAXS pattern based on the blind deconvolution was\ndeveloped and the deblurring results demonstrated the good restoration effect\nfor the defocus image. Finally, a bamboo sample was selected for SAXS-CT\nexperiment which illustrated the performance of the microfocus-SAXS method.\n", "  The Heisenberg-Kitaev model is a paradigmatic model to describe the magnetism\nin honeycomb-lattice Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as\nA$_2$IrO$_3$ (A = Na, Li) and $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Here we study in detail the\nphysics of the Heisenberg-Kitaev model in an external magnetic field. Using a\ncombination of Monte-Carlo simulations and spin-wave theory we map out the\nclassical phase diagram for different directions of the magnetic field. Broken\nSU(2) spin symmetry renders the magnetization process rather complex, with\nsequences of phases and metamagnetic transitions. In particular, we find\nvarious large-unit-cell and multi-Q phases including a vortex-crystal phase for\na field in the [111] direction. We also discuss quantum corrections in the\nhigh-field phase.\n", "  Theoretical limits to the performance of superconductors in high magnetic\nfields parallel to their surfaces are of key relevance to current and future\naccelerating cavities, especially those made of new higher-Tc materials such as\nNb$_3$Sn, NbN, and MgB$_2$. Indeed, beyond the so-called superheating field\n$H_{\\mathcal{sh}}$, flux will spontaneously penetrate even a perfect\nsuperconducting surface and ruin the performance. We present intuitive\narguments and simple estimates for $H_{\\mathcal{sh}}$, and combine them with\nour previous rigorous calculations, which we summarize. We briefly discuss\nexperimental measurements of the superheating field, comparing to our\nestimates. We explore the effects of materials anisotropy and the danger of\ndisorder in nucleating vortex entry. Will we need to control surface\norientation in the layered compound MgB$_2$? Can we estimate theoretically\nwhether dirt and defects make these new materials fundamentally more\nchallenging to optimize than niobium? Finally, we discuss and analyze recent\nproposals to use thin superconducting layers or laminates to enhance the\nperformance of superconducting cavities. Flux entering a laminate can lead to\nso-called pancake vortices; we consider the physics of the dislocation motion\nand potential re-annihilation or stabilization of these vortices after their\nentry.\n", "  We study the odd-wave interacting identical fermions in one-dimension with\nfinite effective range. We show that to fully describe the high-momentum\ndistribution $\\rho(k)$ up to $k^{-4}$, one needs four parameters characterizing\nthe properties when two particles {\\it contact} with each other. Two parameters\nare related to the variation of energy with respect to the odd-wave scattering\nlength and the effective range, respectively, determining the $k^{-2}$ tail and\npart of $k^{-4}$ tail in $\\rho(k)$. The other two parameters are related to the\ncenter-of-mass motion of the system, respectively determining the $k^{-3}$ tail\nand the other part of $k^{-4}$ tail. We point out that the unusual $k^{-3}$\ntail, which has not been discovered before in atomic systems, is an intrinsic\ncomponent to complete the general form of $\\rho(k)$ and also realistically\ndetectable under certain experimental conditions. Various other universal\nrelations are also derived in terms of those contact parameters, and finally\nthe results are confirmed through the exact solution of a two-body problem.\n", "  In a partially filled flat Bloch band electrons do not have a well defined\nFermi surface and hence the low-energy theory is not a Fermi liquid.\nNeverethless, under the influence of an attractive interaction, a\nsuperconductor well described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wave\nfunction can arise. Here we study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a\ngeneric Hubbard model with a flat band. We obtain an effective Hamiltonian for\nthe flat band physics by eliminating higher lying bands via perturbative\nSchrieffer-Wolff transformation. At first order in the interaction energy we\nrecover the usual procedure of projecting the interaction term onto the flat\nband Wannier functions. We show that the BCS wave function is the exact ground\nstate of the projected interaction Hamiltonian and that the compressibility is\ndiverging as a consequence of an emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is\nbroken by second order interband transitions resulting in a finite\ncompressibility, which we illustrate for a one-dimensional ladder with two\nperfectly flat bands. These results motivate a further approximation leading to\nan effective ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. The gauge-invariant result for the\nsuperfluid weight of a flat band can be obtained from the ferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model only if the maximally localized Wannier functions in the\nMarzari-Vanderbilt sense are used. Finally, we prove an important inequality $D\n\\geq \\mathcal{W}^2$ between the Drude weight $D$ and the winding number\n$\\mathcal{W}$, which guarantees ballistic transport for topologically\nnontrivial flat bands in one dimension.\n", "  We have performed a case study investigating a recently proposed scheme to\nobtain an effective pair potential for active Brownian particles [Farage et\nal., Phys. Rev. E 91, 042310 (2015)]. Applying this scheme to the Lennard-Jones\npotential, numerical simulations of active Brownian particles are compared to\nsimulations of passive Brownian particles interacting by the effective pair\npotential. Analyzing the static pair correlations, our results indicate a\nlimited range of activity parameters (speed and orientational correlation time)\nfor which we obtain quantitative, or even qualitative, agreement. Moreover, we\nfind a qualitatively different behavior for the virial pressure even for small\npropulsion speeds. Combining these findings we conclude that beyond linear\nresponse active particles exhibit genuine non-equilibrium properties that\ncannot be captured by effective pair interaction alone.\n", "  The deformation-induced splitting of isoscalar giant monopole resonance\n(ISGMR) is systematically analyzed in a wide range of masses covering medium,\nrare-earth, actinide, and superheavy axial deformed nuclei. The study is\nperformed within the fully self-consistent quasiparticle\nrandom-phase-approximation (QRPA) method based on the Skyrme functional. Two\nSkyrme forces, one with a large (SV-bas) and one with a small (SkP) nuclear\nincompressibility, are considered. The calculations confirm earlier results\nthat, due to the deformation-induced E0-E2 coupling, the isoscalar E0 resonance\nattains a double-peak structure and significant energy upshift. Our results are\ncompared with available analytic estimations. Unlike earlier studies, we get a\nsmaller energy difference between the lower and upper peaks and thus a stronger\nE0-E2 coupling. This in turn results in more pumping of E0 strength into the\nlower peak and more pronounced splitting of ISGMR. We also discuss widths of\nthe peaks and their negligible correlation with deformation.\n", "  A linear response function (LRF) that relates the temporal tendency of zonal\nmean temperature and zonal wind to their anomalies and external forcing is used\nto accurately quantify the strength of the eddy-jet feedback associated with\nthe annular mode in an idealized GCM. Following a simple feedback model, the\nresults confirm the presence of a positive eddy-jet feedback in the annular\nmode dynamics, with a feedback strength of 0.137 day$^{-1}$ in the idealized\nGCM. Statistical methods proposed by earlier studies to quantify the feedback\nstrength are evaluated against results from the LRF. It is argued that the\nmean-state-independent eddy forcing reduces the accuracy of these statistical\nmethods because of the quasi-oscillatory nature of the eddy forcing. A new\nmethod is proposed to approximate the feedback strength as the regression\ncoefficient of low-pass filtered eddy forcing onto low-pass filtered annular\nmode index, which converges to the value produced by the LRF when timescales\nlonger than 200 days are used for the low-pass filtering. Applying the new\nlow-pass filtering method to the reanalysis data, the feedback strength in the\nSouthern annular mode is found to be 0.121 day$^{-1}$, which is presented as an\nimprovement over previous estimates. This work also highlights the importance\nof using sub-daily data in the analysis by showing the significant contribution\nof medium-scale waves of periods less than 2 days to the annular mode dynamics,\nwhich was under-appreciated in most of previous research. The present study\nprovides a framework to quantify the eddy-jet feedback strength in models and\nreanalysis data.\n", "  The scaling of antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of corundum-type\nchromia films have been investigated. N\\'eel temperature $T_N$ was determined\nfrom the effect of perpendicular exchange-bias on the magnetization of a\nweakly-coupled adjacent ferromagnet. For a thick-film case, the validity of\ndetection is confirmed by a susceptibility measurement. Detection of $T_N$ was\npossible down to 1-nm-thin chromia films. The scaling of ordering temperature\nwith thickness was studied using different buffering materials, and compared\nwith Monte-Carlo simulations. The spin-correlation length and the corresponding\ncritical exponent were estimated, and they were consistent between experimental\nand simulation results. The spin-correlation length is an order of magnitude\nless than cubic antiferromagnets. We propose that the difference is from the\nchange of number of exchange-coupling links in the two crystal systems.\n", "  High resolution molecular dynamics simulations with full Coulomb interactions\nof electrons are used to investigate field emission from a prolate spheroidal\ntip. The space charge limited current is several times lower than the current\ncalculated with the Fowler-Nordheim formula. The image-charge is taken into\naccount with a spherical approximation, which is good around the top of the\ntip, i.e. region where the current is generated.\n", "  Certain non-uniform strain applied to graphene flakes has been shown to\ninduce pseudo-Landau levels in the single-particle spectrum, which can be\nrationalized in terms of a pseudo-magnetic field for electrons near the Dirac\npoints. However, this Landau level structure is in general approximate and\nrestricted to low energies. Here we introduce a family of strained bipartite\ntight-binding models in arbitrary spatial dimension d and analytically prove\nthat their entire spectrum consists of perfectly degenerate pseudo-Landau\nlevels. This construction generalizes the case of triaxial strain on graphene's\nhoneycomb lattice to arbitrary d; in d=3 our model corresponds to tetraxial\nstrain on the diamond lattice. We discuss general aspects of pseudo-Landau\nlevels in arbitrary d.\n", "  Superconductivity is shown to be completely destroyed in thin mesoscopic or\nnanoscopic rings closed by the junction with a noticeable interfacial pair\nbreaking and/or a Josephson coupling, if a ring's radius r is less than the\nminimum radius r_min. The quantity r_min depends on the phase difference across\nthe junction, or on the magnetic flux that controls the phase difference in the\nflux-biased ring. It also depends on the Josephson and interfacial effective\ncoupling constants, and in particular, on whether the ring is closed by 0 or pi\njunction. The current-phase relation is substantially modified when the ring's\nradius exceeds r_min for some of the phase difference values, or slightly goes\nbeyond its maximum. The modified critical temperature Tc, as well as the\ntemperature dependent supercurrent near Tc are identified here as functions of\nthe ring's radius and the magnetic flux.\n", "  We consider a system of non-interacting fermions in one dimension subject to\na single-particle potential consisting of (a) a strong optical lattice, (b) a\nharmonic trap, and (c) uncorrelated on-site disorder. After a quench, in which\nthe center of the harmonic trap is displaced, we study the occupation function\nof the fermions and the time-evolution of experimental observables.\nSpecifically, we present numerical and analytical results for the post-quench\noccupation function of the fermions, and analyse the time-evolution of the\nreal-space density profile. Unsurprisingly for a non-interacting (and therefore\nintegrable) system, the infinite-time limit of the density profile is\nnon-thermal. However, due to Bragg-localization of the higher-energy\nsingle-particle states, the approach to even this non-thermal state is\nextremely slow. We quantify this statement, and show that it implies a\nsensitivity to disorder parametrically stronger than that expected from\nAnderson localization.\n", "  The thermodynamic uncertainty relation provides an inequality relating any\nmean current, the associated dispersion and the entropy production rate for\narbitrary non-equilibrium steady states. Applying it here to a general model of\na molecular motor running against an external force or torque, we show that the\nthermodynamic efficiency of such motors is universally bounded by an expression\ninvolving only experimentally accessible quantities. For motors pulling cargo\nthrough a viscous fluid, a universal bound for the corresponding Stokes\nefficiency follows as a variant. A similar result holds if mechanical force is\nused to synthesize molecules of high chemical potential. Crucially, no\nknowledge of the detailed underlying mechano-chemical mechanism is required for\napplying these bounds.\n", "  We study the subgap spectrum of the interacting single-level quantum dot\ncoupled between two superconducting reservoirs, forming the Josephson-type\ncircuit, and additionally hybridized with a metallic normal lead. This system\nallows for the phase-tunable interplay between the correlation effects and the\nproximity-induced electron pairing resulting in the singlet-doublet (0-$\\pi$)\ncrossover and the phase-dependent Kondo effect. We investigate the spectral\nfunction, induced local pairing, Josephson supercurrent, and Andreev\nconductance in a wide range of system parameters by the numerically exact\nNumerical Renormalization Group and Quantum Monte Carlo calculations along with\nperturbative treatments in terms of the Coulomb repulsion and the hybridization\nterm. Our results address especially the correlation effects reflected in\ndependencies of various quantities on the local Coulomb interaction strength as\nwell as on the coupling to the normal lead. We quantitatively establish the\nphase-dependent Kondo temperature $\\log T_{K}(\\phi)\\propto\\cos^{2}(\\phi/2)$ and\nshow that it can be read off from the half-width of the zero-bias enhancement\nin the Andreev conductance in the doublet phase, which can be experimentally\nmeasured by the tunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  Muon component of extensive air showers (EAS) initiated by cosmic ray\nparticles carries information on the primary particle identity. We show that\nthe muon content of EAS could be measured in a broad energy range from 10-100\nTeV up to ultra-high-energy cosmic ray range using wide field-of-view imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes observing strongly inclined or nearly\nhorizontal EAS from the ground of from high altitude. Cherenkov emission from\nmuons in such EAS forms a distinct component (halo or tail) of the EAS image in\nthe telescope camera. We show that detection of the muon signal could be used\nto measure composition of the cosmic ray spectrum in the energy ranges of the\nknee, the ankle and of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition. It could also\nbe used to veto the cosmic ray background in gamma-ray observations. This\ntechnique provides a possibility for up to two orders of magnitude improvement\nof sensitivity for gamma-ray flux in the energy band above 10 PeV, compared to\nKASCADE-Grande, and an order-of-magnitude improvement of sensitivity in the\nmulti-EeV energy band, compared to Pierre Auger Observatory.\n", "  Nucleation processes are at the heart of a large number of phenomena, from\ncloud formation to protein crystallization. A recently emerging area where\nnucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein\nself-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to\nnanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received\nmuch attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies\nfocussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step\nforward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous\nprotein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an\noverview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation of\nprotein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the\ncluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the\nreaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical\nsize of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case\nof filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the\nnucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process.\nUsing computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the\nnucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of\nspontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate\nto the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the\nportion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational\nconversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common\nkinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order\nof the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into\nperspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.\n", "  Magnetic sensing and imaging instruments are important tools in biological\nand material sciences. There is an increasing demand for attaining higher\nsensitivity and spatial resolution, with implementations using a single qubit\noffering potential improvements in both directions. In this article we describe\na scanning magnetometer based on the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as the\nsensor. By means of a quantum-assisted readout scheme together with advances in\nphoton collection efficiency, our device exhibits an enhancement in signal to\nnoise ratio of close to an order of magnitude compared to the standard\nfluorescence readout of the nitrogen-vacancy center. This is demonstrated by\ncomparing non-assisted and assisted methods in a $T_1$ relaxation time\nmeasurement.\n", "  Recent progress regarding the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of\nextended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD), a model with Hall drift and electron\ninertia, is summarized. The advantages of the Hamiltonian approach are invoked\nto study some general properties of XMHD turbulence, and to compare them\nagainst their ideal MHD counterparts. For instance, the helicity flux transfer\nrates for XMHD are computed, and Liouville's theorem for this model is also\nverified. The latter is used, in conjunction with the absolute equilibrium\nstates, to arrive at the spectra for the invariants, and to determine the\ndirection of the cascades, e.g., generalizations of the well-known ideal MHD\ninverse cascade of magnetic helicity. After a similar analysis is conducted for\nXMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium\nstates, a couple of interesting results emerge. When cross helicity is taken to\nbe ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in\nthe Hall MHD range - this is shown to be consistent with previous results in\nthe literature. In contrast, in the inertial MHD range, viz. at scales smaller\nthan the electron skin depth, all spectral quantities are expected to undergo\ndirect cascading. The consequences and relevance of our results in space and\nastrophysical plasmas are also briefly discussed.\n", "  The static and dynamic polarizabilities, and the tune-out wavelengths of the\nground state of Rb and the hyperfine ground states of $^{87, 85}$Rb have been\ncalculated by using relativistic configuration interaction plus core\npolarization(RCICP) approach. It is found that the first primary tune-out\nwavelengths of the $ 5s_{1/2}, F=1, 2 $ states of $ ^{87}$Rb are\n790.018187(193) nm and 790.032602(193) nm severally, where the calculated\nresult for the $ 5s_{1/2}, F=2 $ state is in good agreement with the latest\nhigh-precision measurement 790.032388(32) nm [Phys. Rev. A 92, 052501 (2015)].\nSimilarly, the first primary tune-out wavelengths of the $ 5s_{1/2}, F=2, 3 $\nstates of $^{85}$Rb are 790.023515(218) nm and 790.029918(218) nm respectively.\nFurthermore, the tune-out wavelengths for the different magnetic sublevels $\nM_{F}$ of each hyperfine level $F$ are also determined by considering the\ncontributions of tensor polarizabilities.\n", "  Previous work has established an equality between the geodesic integral of a\nfree bulk field in AdS and the contribution of the conformal descendants of its\ndual CFT primary operator to the OPE of two other operators inserted at the\nendpoints of the geodesic. Working in the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$\ncorrespondence, we extend this relation to include the $1/N$ corrections to the\nbulk field obtained by dressing it with i) a $U(1)$ current and ii) the CFT\nstress tensor. In the former case, we argue that the contribution of the\nKa\\v{c}-Moody descendants to the respective boundary OPE equals the geodesic\nintegral of a particular $U(1)$-dressed bulk field, which is framed to the\nboundary via a split Wilson line. In the latter case, we compute the\ngravitational $1/N$ corrections to the bulk field in various gauges, and then\nwrite a CFT expression for a putative bulk field whose geodesic integral\ncaptures the contribution of Virasoro descendants to the OPE of interest. We\ncomment on the bulk interpretation of this expression.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae are a powerful cosmological probe, that gave the first\nstrong evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Here we\nprovide an overview of how supernovae can go further to reveal information\nabout what is causing the acceleration, be it dark energy or some modification\nto our laws of gravity. We first summarise the many different approaches used\nto explain or test the acceleration, including parametric models (like the\nstandard model, LambdaCDM), non-parametric models, dark fluid models such as\nquintessence, and extensions to standard gravity. We also show how supernova\ndata can be used beyond the Hubble diagram, to give information on\ngravitational lensing and peculiar velocities that can be used to distinguish\nbetween models that predict the same expansion history. Finally, we review the\nmethods of statistical inference that are commonly used, making a point of\nseparating parameter estimation from model selection.\n", "  Sr2IrO4 was predicted to be an unconventional superconductor upon carrier\ndoping since it highly resembles the high-temperature cuprates. Here, to\nunderstand carrier doping effect on spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Sr2IrO4,\nthe electronic structure and local structure distortion for Sr2-xLaxIrO4 system\nhave been investigated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). By comparing the\nintensity of white-line features at the Ir L2,3 absorption edges, we observe\nremarkably large branching ratios in La-doped compounds, greater than that of\nthe parent material Sr2IrO4, suggesting a strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI)\nfor Sr2IrO4-based system. Moreover, extended x-ray absorption fine structure\n(EXAFS) spectra demonstrate more regular IrO6 octahedra, i.e. the weakened\ncrystal electric field (CEF) versus La-doping. By theoretical calculations, the\nsynergistic effect of regular IrO6 octahedra and electron doping is\nestablished, which accounts for the transition from a Mott insulator to a\nconductive state in Sr2-xLaxIrO4-based system.\n", "  Colloids are suspensions of small solid particles in a liquid, and exhibit\nglassy behavior when the particle concentration is high. In these samples, the\nparticles are roughly analogous to individual molecules in a traditional glass.\nThis model system has been used to study the glass transition since the 1980's.\nIn this Viewpoint we summarize some of the intriguing behaviors of the glass\ntransition in colloids, and discuss open questions.\n", "  We present a tight-binding (TB) model and $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$ theory for\nelectrons in monolayer and few-layer InSe. The model is constructed from a\nbasis of all $s$ and $p$ valence orbitals on both indium and selenium atoms,\nwith tight-binding parameters obtained from fitting to independently computed\ndensity functional theory (DFT) band structures for mono- and bilayer InSe. For\nthe valence and conduction band edges of few-layer InSe, which appear to be in\nthe vicinity of the $\\Gamma$ point, we calculate the absorption coefficient for\nthe principal optical transitions as a function of the number of layers, $N$.\nWe find a strong dependence on $N$ of the principal optical transition\nenergies, selection rules, and optical oscillation strengths, in agreement with\nrecent observations \\cite{Bandurin2016}. Also, we find that the conduction band\nelectrons are relatively light ($m \\propto 0.14-0.18 m_e$), in contrast to an\nalmost flat, and slightly inverted, dispersion of valence band holes near the\n$\\Gamma$-point, which is found for up to $N \\propto 6$.\n", "  We introduce a framework for degenerate classical field theories in the BV\nformalism, which allows us to discuss many interesting examples of theories\nwhich do not admit a Lagrangian description. Further, we study phase spaces and\nboundary conditions for classical field theories on manifolds with boundary,\nand from a fixed classical field theory together with a choice of boundary\ncondition, construct a degenerate classical field theory on the boundary. We\napply these ideas to many physically interesting examples including the\nKapustin-Witten twists of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons theory,\nthe chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten model, chiral Toda theory, and a new 3d classical\nfield theory called Whittaker theory.\n", "  We explore the self-interacting dark matter scenario in a simple dark sector\nmodel where the dark matter interacts through a dark photon. Splitting a Dirac\nfermion dark matter into two levels using a small Majorana mass can evade\nstrong direct detection constraints on the kinetic mixing between the dark and\nnormal photons, thus allowing the dark sector to be more visible at high\nintensity and/or high energy experiments. It is pointed out that such a mass\nsplitting has a strong impact on the dark matter self-interaction strength. We\nderive the new parameter space of a pseudo-Dirac self-interacting dark matter.\nInterestingly, with increasing mass splitting, a weak scale dark matter mass\nwindow survives that could be probed by the LHC and future colliders.\n", "  We consider a metric which describes Ba$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$ados geometries and\nshow that the considered metric is a solution of generalized minimal massive\ngravity (GMMG) model. We consider the Killing vector field which preserves the\nform of considered metric. Using the off-shell quasi-local approach we obtain\nthe asymptotic conserved charges of given solution. Similar to the Einstein\ngravity in the presence of negative cosmological constant, for the GMMG model\nalso, we show that the algebra among the asymptotic conserved charges is\nisomorphic to two copies of the Virasoro algebra. Eventually, we find relation\nbetween the algebra of the near horizon and the asymptotic conserved charges.\nThis relation show that the main part of the horizon fluffs proposal of\nRefs.\\cite{140,14} appear for generic black holes in the class of\nBa$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$ados geometries in the context of GMMG model.\n", "  Unidirectional invisibility of a PT-symmetric optical system is of great\ninterest, but challenging as well since it is infeasible to fulfill it through\nwide optical frequency ranges in all angular directions. Accordingly we study\nreflectionless and invisible patterns in the TE and TM modes of an optical slab\nsystem consisting of adjacent or separated pair of balanced gain and loss\nlayers with a gap. We provide a comprehensive study of one of the simplest\nexperimentally accessible examples of a unidirectionally reflectionless and\ninvisible PT-symmetric optical slab system. We obtain the physically optimal\nconditions for the realization of these phenomena. We derive analytic\nexpressions, and show that only certain gain amounts restricted to take values\nbetween certain minimum and maximum values give rise to uni/bi-directionally\ninvisible configurations. The size of gap decides the measure of\nreflectionlessness and invisibility parameters, especially on gain value and\nincident angle.\n", "  Simulations of physical phenomena are essential to the expedient design of\nprecision components in aerospace and other high-tech industries. These\nphenomena are often described by mathematical models involving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) without exact solutions. Modern design problems\nrequire simulations with a level of resolution that is difficult to achieve in\na reasonable amount of time even in effectively parallelized solvers. Though\nthe scale of the problem relative to available computing power is the greatest\nimpediment to accelerating these applications, significant performance gains\ncan be achieved through careful attention to the details of memory accesses.\nParallelized PDE solvers are subject to a trade-off in memory management: store\nthe solution for each timestep in abundant, global memory with high access\ncosts or in a limited, private memory with low access costs that must be passed\nbetween nodes. The GPU implementation of swept time-space decomposition\npresented here mitigates this dilemma by using private (shared) memory,\navoiding internode communication, and overwriting unnecessary values. It shows\nsignificant improvement in the execution time of the PDE solvers in one\ndimension achieving speedups of 6-2x for large and small problem sizes\nrespectively compared to naive GPU versions and 7-300x compared to parallel CPU\nversions.\n", "  In the recent article Phys.\\ Lett.\\ B {\\bf 759} (2016) 424 a new class of\nfield theories called Nonlinear Field Space Theory has been proposed. In this\napproach, the standard field theories are considered as linear approximations\nto some more general theories characterized by nonlinear field phase spaces.\nThe case of spherical geometry is especially interesting due to its relation\nwith the spin physics. Here, we explore this possibility showing that classical\nscalar field theory with such a field space can be viewed as a perturbation of\na continuous spin system. In this picture, the spin precession and the scalar\nfield excitations are dual descriptions of the same physics. The duality is\nstudied on the example of the Heisenberg model. It is shown that the Heisenberg\nmodel coupled to a magnetic field leads to a non-relativistic scalar field\ntheory, characterized by quadratic dispersion relation. Finally, on the basis\nof analysis of the relation between the spin phase space and the scalar field\ntheory we propose the \\emph{Spin-Field correspondence} between the known types\nof fields and the corresponding spin systems.\n", "  The spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), especially its tilt\n$n_T$, carries significant information about the primordial universe. Combining\nrecent aLIGO and Planck2015+BK14 data, we find that the current limit is\n$n_T=0.016^{+0.614}_{-0.989}$ at 95% C.L. We also estimate the impacts of\nEinstein Telescope and LISA on constraining $n_T$. Moreover, based on the\neffective field theory of cosmological perturbations, we make an attempt to\nconfront some models of early universe scenarios, which produce blue-tilted GWs\nspectrum ($n_T>0$), with the corresponding datasets.\n", "  We combine quasiparticle interference simulation (theory) and atomic\nresolution scanning tunneling spectro-microscopy (experiment) to visualize the\ninterference patterns on a type-II Weyl semimetal Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ for\nthe first time. Our simulation based on first-principles band topology\ntheoretically reveals the surface electron scattering behavior. We identify the\ntopological Fermi arc states and reveal the scattering properties of the\nsurface states in Mo$_{0.66}$W$_{0.34}$Te$_2$. In addition, our result reveals\nan experimental signature of the topology via the interconnectivity of bulk and\nsurface states, which is essential for understanding the unusual nature of this\nmaterial.\n", "  The galactic cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in the Earth\nstratosphere and troposphere. The induced by primary cosmic ray particles\nionization is important in various processes related to atmospheric physics and\nchemistry, specifically the minor constituents. The ion production in the\natmosphere is enhanced compared to the average following major solar energetic\nparticles events, specifically over the polar caps. During the solar cycle 23\nwe observed several strong ground level enhancements, one of the strongest\namong them been the Bastille day event on 14 July 2000. In the work presented\nhere we apply a full Monte Carlo 3-D model in order to compute the cosmic ray\ninduced ionization. The model is based on atmospheric shower simulation with\nthe PLANETOCOSMICS code and the ion production rate is considered as a\nsuperposition of cosmic rays with galactic and solar origin. The ion production\nrate is computed as a function of the altitude above the sea level and the\nshort, mid and long term ionization effect relative to the average due to\ngalactic cosmic rays is computed.\n", "  The possible effect of solar variability, accordingly cosmic rays variation\non atmospheric physics and chemistry is highly debated over the last years.\nAccording to several recent models the induced by cosmic rays atmospheric\nionization plays a key role in several different processes. At recent, an\napparent effect on minor constituents and aerosols over polar regions during\nmajor solar proton events was observed. The ion production rate during ground\nlevel enhancements is a superposition of the contribution of cosmic rays with\ngalactic and solar origin. The solar cycle 23 provided several strong ground\nlevel enhancements. The period of end October - beginning of November 2003 was\ncharacterized by a strong cosmic ray variability, namely a sequence of three\nGLEs was observed. In addition, there were several Forbush decreases, which led\nto a suppression of galactic cosmic ray flux. As a consequence the cosmic ray\ninduced ion production in the atmosphere and the corresponding ionization\neffect were subject of dynamical changes. Here we compute the complex ion\nproduction due to cosmic rays during the Halloween sequence of ground level\nenhancements on October-November 2003 and we estimate the ionization effect.\nThe spectral and angular characteristics of the solar protons are explicitly\nconsidered throughout the events as well their time evolution. The ionization\neffect during the period is computed at several altitudes above the sea level\nin a region with $R_{c}$ $\\le$ 1 GV and $R_{c}$ $\\le$ 2 GV.\n", "  The production of anti-hydrogen ions in the GBAR experiment will occur via a\ntwo step charge exchange process. In a first reaction, the anti-protons from\nthe ELENA ring at CERN will capture a positron from a positronium target\nproducing anti-hydrogen atoms. Those interacting in the same positronium target\nwill produce in a second step anti-hydrogen ions. This results in a dependence\nfor the anti-ions production rate which is roughly proportional to the\npositronium density squared. We present a scheme to increase the anti-ions\nproduction rate in the GBAR experiment by tailoring the anti-proton to the\npositron pulse in order to maximise the temporal overlap of Ps and\nanti-protons. Detailed simulations show that an order of magnitude could be\ngained by bunching the anti-protons from ELENA. In order to avoid losses in\ntheir capture in the Paul trap due to the energy spread introduced by the\nbunching, debunching with a symmetrical inverted pulse can be applied to the\nanti-hydrogen ions.\n", "  How impulsive magnetic energy release leads to solar eruptions and how those\neruptions are energized and evolve are vital unsolved problems in Heliophysics.\nThe standard model for solar eruptions summarizes our current understanding of\nthese events. Magnetic energy in the corona is released through drastic\nrestructuring of the magnetic field via reconnection. Electrons and ions are\nthen accelerated by poorly understood processes. Theories include contracting\nloops, merging magnetic islands, stochastic acceleration, and turbulence at\nshocks, among others. Although this basic model is well established, the\nfundamental physics is poorly understood. HXR observations using\ngrazing-incidence focusing optics can now probe all of the key regions of the\nstandard model. These include two above-the-looptop (ALT) sources which bookend\nthe reconnection region and are likely the sites of particle acceleration and\ndirect heating. The science achievable by a direct HXR imaging instrument can\nbe summarized by the following science questions and objectives which are some\nof the most outstanding issues in solar physics (1) How are particles\naccelerated at the Sun? (1a) Where are electrons accelerated and on what time\nscales? (1b) What fraction of electrons is accelerated out of the ambient\nmedium? (2) How does magnetic energy release on the Sun lead to flares and\neruptions? A Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) instrument, which can\nbe built now using proven technology and at modest cost, would enable\nrevolutionary advancements in our understanding of impulsive magnetic energy\nrelease and particle acceleration, a process which is known to occur at the Sun\nbut also throughout the Universe.\n", "  Even in the absence of resolved flares, the corona is heated to several\nmillion degrees. However, despite its importance for the structure, dynamics,\nand evolution of the solar atmosphere, the origin of this heating remains\npoorly understood. Several observational and theoretical considerations suggest\nthat the heating is driven by small, impulsive energy bursts which could be\nParker-style \"nanoflares\" (Parker 1988) that arise via reconnection within the\ntangled and twisted coronal magnetic field. The classical \"smoking gun\"\n(Klimchuk 2009; Cargill et al. 2013) for impulsive heating is the direct\ndetection of widespread hot plasma (T > 6 MK) with a low emission measure. In\nrecent years there has been great progress in the development of Transition\nEdge Sensor (TES) X-ray microcalorimeters that make them more ideal for\nstudying the Sun. When combined with grazing-incidence focusing optics, they\nprovide direct spectroscopic imaging over a broad energy band (0.5 to 10 keV)\ncombined with extremely impressive energy resolution in small pixels, as low as\n0.7 eV (FWHM) at 1.5 keV (Lee 2015), and 1.56 eV (FWHM) at 6 keV (Smith 2012),\ntwo orders of magnitude better than the current best traditional solid state\nphoton-counting spectrometers. Decisive observations of the hot plasma\nassociated with nanoflare models of coronal heating can be provided by new\nsolar microcalorimeters. These measurements will cover the most important part\nof the coronal spectrum for searching for the nanoflare-related hot plasma and\nwill characterize how much nanoflares can heat the corona both in active\nregions and the quiet Sun. Finally, microcalorimeters will enable to study all\nof this as a function of time and space in each pixel simultaneously a\ncapability never before available.\n", "  We study the relationship between the classical Hamilton flow and the quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger evolution where the Hamiltonian is a degree-2 complex-valued\npolynomial. When the flow obeys a strict positivity condition equivalent to\ncompactness of the evolution operator, we find geometric expressions for the\n$L^2$ operator norm and a singular-value decomposition of the Schr\\\"odinger\nevolution, using the Hamilton flow. The flow also gives a geometric composition\nlaw for these operators, which correspond to a large class of integral\noperators with nondegenerate Gaussian kernels.\n", "  Semiconductor heterostructures are backbones for solid state based\noptoelectronic devices. Recent advances in assembly techniques for van der\nWaals heterostructures has enabled the band engineering of semiconductor\nheterojunctions for atomically thin optoelectronic devices. In two-dimensional\nheterostructures with type II band alignment, interlayer excitons, where\nCoulomb-bound electrons and holes are confined to opposite layers, have shown\npromising properties for novel excitonic devices, including a large binding\nenergy, micron-scale in-plane drift-diffusion, and long population and valley\npolarization lifetime. Here, we demonstrate interlayer exciton optoelectronics\nbased on electrostatically defined lateral p-n junctions in a MoSe2-WSe2\nheterobilayer. Applying a forward bias enables the first observation of\nelectroluminescence from interlayer excitons. At zero bias, the p-n junction\nfunctions as a highly sensitive photodetector, where the wavelength-dependent\nphotocurrent measurement allows the direct observation of resonant optical\nexcitation of the interlayer exciton. The resulting photocurrent amplitude from\nthe interlayer exciton is about 200 times smaller compared to the resonant\nexcitation of intralayer exciton. This implies that the interlayer exciton\noscillator strength is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the\nintralayer exciton due to the spatial separation of electron and hole to\nopposite layers. These results lay the foundation for exploiting the interlayer\nexciton in future 2D heterostructure optoelectronic devices.\n", "  In this paper we will propose a physical interpretation of Borel resummation.\nWe will define Borel transformation on the Lagrangian level. This\ntransformation essentially coincides with coupling the original theory to the\nnon-dynamical complex dilaton field. In the perturbative sector it reproduces\nstandard Borel resummation. In the non-perturbative sector this transformation\nreproduces Bogomolny--Zinn-Justin(BZJ) regularization. Our approach unifies the\nperturbative Borel resummation and non-perturbative BZJ procedure.\n", "  The readout electronics for the resonant beam position monitors (BPMs) in the\nFermilab Switchyard (SY) have been upgraded, utilizing a low noise amplifier\ntransition board and Fermilab designed digitizer boards. The stripline BPMs are\nestimated to have an average signal output of between -110 dBm and -80 dBm,\nwith an estimated peak output of -70 dBm. The external resonant circuit is\ntuned to the SY machine frequency of 53.10348 MHz. Both the digitizer and\ntransition boards have variable gain in order to accommodate the large dynamic\nrange and irregularity of the resonant extraction spill. These BPMs will aid in\nauto-tuning of the SY beamline as well as enabling operators to monitor beam\nposition through the spill.\n", "  We show a simple, analytic equation describing a class of two-dimensional\nshapes well suited for representation of aircraft airfoil profiles. Our goal\nwas to create a description characterized by a small number of parameters with\neasily understandable meaning, providing a tool to alter the shape with\noptimization procedures as well as manual tweaks by the designer. The generated\nshapes are well suited for numerical analysis with 2D flow solving software\nsuch as XFOIL.\n", "  The inverse problem of cosmic ray transport of ultra-high energy cosmic rays\nis considered. The analysis of Auger data on energy spectrum, energy dependence\nof mean logarithm of atomic mass number and its variance allows definite\nconclusions on the shape of the source spectrum in the frameworks of the\ninverse problem approach. The discussion on regularization procedure for\nconsidered ill-posed problem is presented.\n", "  The U.S. Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) report encouraged\nthe realization of Fermilab's Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) to support\nfuture neutrino programs in the United States. PIP-II aims at enhancing the\ncapabilities of the Fermilab existing accelerator complex while simultaneously\nproviding a flexible platform for its future upgrades. The central part of\nPIP-II project is the construction of a new 800 MeV H- Superconducting (SC)\nLinac together with upgrades of the Booster and Main Injector synchrotrons. New\ntransfer lines will also be needed to deliver beam to the downstream\naccelerators and facilities. In this paper we present the recent development of\nthe design of the transfer lines discussing the principles that guided their\ndesign, the constraints and requirements imposed by the existing accelerator\ncomplex and the following modifications implemented to comply with a better\nunderstanding of the limitations and further requirements that emerged during\nthe development of the project.\n", "  We present {\\em Spitzer} secondary-eclipse observations of the hot Jupiter\nHAT-P-13 b in the 3.6 {\\micron} and 4.5 {\\micron} bands. HAT-P-13 b inhabits a\ntwo-planet system with a configuration that enables constraints on the planet's\nsecond Love number, \\math{k\\sb{2}}, from precise eccentricity measurements,\nwhich in turn constrains models of the planet's interior structure. We exploit\nthe direct measurements of \\math{e \\cos \\omega} from our secondary-eclipse data\nand combine them with previously published radial velocity data to generate a\nrefined model of the planet's orbit and thus an improved estimate on the\npossible interval for \\math{k\\sb{2}}. We report eclipse phases of \\math{0.49154\n\\pm 0.00080} and \\math{0.49711 \\pm 0.00083} and corresponding \\math{e \\cos\n\\omega} estimates of \\math{-0.0136 \\pm 0.0013} and \\math{-0.0048 \\pm 0.0013}.\nUnder the assumptions of previous work, our estimate of \\math{k\\sb{2}} of 0.81\n{\\pm} 0.10 is consistent with the lower extremes of possible core masses found\nby previous models, including models with no solid core. This anomalous result\nchallenges both interior models and the dynamical assumptions that enable them,\nincluding the essential assumption of apsidal alignment. We also report eclipse\ndepths of 0.081\\% {\\pm} 0.008\\% in the 3.6 {\\micron} channel and 0.088 \\% {\\pm}\n0.028 \\% in the 4.5 {\\micron} channel. These photometric results are\nnon-uniquely consistent with solar-abundance composition without any thermal\ninversion.\n", "  Low-scale supersymmetry breaking scenario in which the breaking scale is\naround TeV has been discussed as a possibility to obtain a large Higgs mass and\nto moderate the fine tuning problem. A characteristic feature is that the\nhidden sector would be accessible at colliders in such a scenario. In this\npaper, we investigate the phenomenology of sgoldstino which is the scalar\ncomponent of the goldstino superfield. We present partial widths and branching\nratios for sgoldstinos decaying to final states involving Higgs bosons and\nsparticles which have not been discussed in detail so far.\n", "  The development of adaptive optics (AO) played a major role in modern\nastronomy over the last three decades. By compensating for the atmospheric\nturbulence, these systems enable to reach the diffraction limit on large\ntelescopes. In this review, we will focus on high contrast applications of\nadaptive optics, namely, imaging the close vicinity of bright stellar objects\nand revealing regions otherwise hidden within the turbulent halo of the\natmosphere to look for objects with a contrast ratio lower than 10^-4 with\nrespect to the central star. Such high-contrast AO-corrected observations have\nled to fundamental results in our current understanding of planetary formation\nand evolution as well as stellar evolution. AO systems equipped three\ngenerations of instruments, from the first pioneering experiments in the\nnineties, to the first wave of instruments on 8m-class telescopes in the years\n2000, and finally to the extreme AO systems that have recently started\noperations. Along with high-contrast techniques, AO enables to reveal the\ncircumstellar environment: massive protoplanetary disks featuring spiral arms,\ngaps or other asymmetries hinting at on-going planet formation, young giant\nplanets shining in thermal emission, or tenuous debris disks and micron-sized\ndust leftover from collisions in massive asteroid-belt analogs. After\nintroducing the science case and technical requirements, we will review the\narchitecture of standard and extreme AO systems, before presenting a few\nselected science highlights obtained with recent AO instruments.\n", "  As SCRF particle accelerator technology advances the need for \"low\nparticulate\" and \"particle free\" vacuum systems becomes greater and greater. In\nthe course of the operation of these systems, there comes a time when various\ninstruments have to be temporarily attached for diagnostic purposes: RGAs, leak\ndetectors, and additional pumps. In an effort to make the additions of these\ninstruments easier and more time effective, we propose to use KF style flanges\nfor these types of temporary diagnostic connections. This document will\ndescribe the tests used to compare the particles generated using the assembly\nof the, widely accepted for \"particle free\" use, conflat flange to the proposed\nKF style flange, and demonstrate that KF flanges produce comparable or even\nless particles.\n", "  We show that the spectrum of a discrete two-dimensional periodic\nSchr\\\"odinger operator on a square lattice with a sufficiently small potential\nis an interval, provided the period is odd in at least one dimension. In\ngeneral, we show that the spectrum may consist of at most two intervals and\nthat a gap may only open at energy zero. This sharpens several results of\nKr\\\"uger and may be thought of as a discrete version of the Bethe--Sommerfeld\nconjecture. We also describe an application to the study of two-dimensional\nalmost-periodic operators.\n", "  Transition metal oxide memristors, or resistive random-access memory (RRAM)\nswitches, are under intense development for storage-class memory because of\ntheir favorable operating power, endurance, speed, and density. Their\ncommercial deployment critically depends on predictive compact models based on\nunderstanding nanoscale physico-chemical forces, which remains elusive and\ncontroversial owing to the difficulties in directly observing atomic motions\nduring resistive switching, Here, using scanning transmission synchrotron x-ray\nspectromicroscopy to study in-situ switching of hafnium oxide memristors, we\ndirectly observed the formation of a localized oxygen-deficiency-derived\nconductive channel surrounded by a low-conductivity ring of excess oxygen.\nSubsequent thermal annealing homogenized the segregated oxygen, resetting the\ncells towards their as-grown resistance state. We show that the formation and\ndissolution of the conduction channel are successfully modeled by radial\nthermophoresis and Fick diffusion of oxygen atoms driven by Joule heating. This\nconfirmation and quantification of two opposing nanoscale radial forces that\naffect bipolar memristor switching are important components for any future\nphysics-based compact model for the electronic switching of these devices.\n", "  We investigate the phase coherence of isoscalar pairs from the $B({\\rm\nGT};0^+_1\\,T\\!=\\!1 \\to 1^+_1\\,T\\!=\\!0)$ values in two-particle configurations\nof $A=6$, 18, and 42 nuclei and two-hole configurations of $A=14$ and 38 ones.\nWe find that these Gamow-Teller (GT) matrix elements are always constructive\nand thus enlarged under isovector- and isoscalar-pairing Hamiltonians, whereas\nthe observed GT strengths are strongly hindered for the two-hole\nconfigurations, including the famous $^{14}$C dating $\\beta$ decay. This\nindicates that the actual isoscalar pair, unlike the isovector pair, has no\ndefinite phase coherence, which can work against forming isoscalar-pair\ncondensates.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) has become the most popular approach to\nelectronic structure across disciplines, especially in material and chemical\nsciences. Last year, at least 30,000 papers used DFT to make useful predictions\nor give insight into an enormous diversity of scientific problems, ranging from\nbattery development to solar cell efficiency and far beyond. The success of\nthis field has been driven by usefully accurate approximations based on known\nexact conditions and careful testing and validation. In the last decade,\napplications of DFT in a new area, warm dense matter, have exploded. DFT is\nrevolutionizing simulations of warm dense matter including applications in\ncontrolled fusion, planetary interiors, and other areas of high energy density\nphysics. Over the past decade or so, molecular dynamics calculations driven by\nmodern density functional theory have played a crucial role in bringing\nchemical realism to these applications, often (but not always) with excellent\nagreement with experiment. This chapter summarizes recent work from our group\non density functional theory at non-zero temperatures, which we call thermal\nDFT. We explain the relevance of this work in the context of warm dense matter,\nand the importance of quantum chemistry to this regime. We illustrate many\nbasic concepts on a simple model system, the asymmetric Hubbard dimer.\n", "  There were proposed new formulas for the dielectric medium permittivity\ndistribution along spatial coordinates in the space between a linear TEM-horn's\nleafs, which were obtained according to the rules of geometric optics in the\nassumption of the phase center being lumped or distributed. The formulas has\nbeen checked by FDTD simulation of an ultra-wideband signal excitation; two\ncases were studied---when dielectric medium is present, and absent. For these\nboth cases, there was obtained voltage steady-wave ratio, as well as radiation\npatterns at a set of frequencies up to 20~GHz; the results comparison was\nperformed.\n", "  This paper reports detailed K-shell line profiles of iron (Fe) and nickel\n(Ni) of the Galactic Center X-ray Emission (GCXE), Galactic Bulge X-ray\nEmission (GBXE), Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE), magnetic Cataclysmic\nVariables (mCVs), non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (non-mCVs), and coronally\nActive Binaries (ABs). For the study of the origin of the GCXE, GBXE, and GRXE,\nthe spectral analysis is focused on equivalent widths of the Fe K$\\alpha$, Fe\nHe$\\alpha$, and Fe Ly$\\alpha$ lines. The global spectrum of the GBXE is\nreproduced by a combination of the mCVs, non-mCVs, and ABs spectra. On the\nother hand, the GRXE spectrum shows significant data excesses at the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ and Fe He$\\alpha$ line energies. This means that additional\ncomponents other than mCVs, non-mCVs, and ABs are required, which have\nsymbiotic phenomena of cold gas and very high-temperature plasma. The GCXE\nspectrum shows larger excesses than those found in the GRXE spectrum at all the\nK-shell lines of iron and nickel. Among them the largest ones are the Fe\nK$\\alpha$, Fe He$\\alpha$, Fe Ly$\\alpha$, and Fe Ly$\\beta$ lines. Together with\nthe fact that the scale heights of the Fe K$\\alpha$, Fe He$\\alpha$, and Fe\nLy$\\alpha$ lines are similar to that of the central molecular zone (CMZ), the\nexcess components would be related to high-energy activity in the extreme\nenvelopment of the CMZ.\n", "  We present a new type of three-dimensional essential Dirac semimetal with\nmagnetic ordering. The Dirac points are protected by the magnetic space groups\nand cannot be gapped without lowering such symmetries, where the combined\nantiunitary symmetry of half-translation operator and time-reversal plays an\nessential role. We introduce two explicit tight-binding models for space groups\n$16$ and $102$, which possesses Dirac point at time-reversal-invariant momenta\nof surface Brillouin zone. In contrast to the time-reversal-invariant essential\nDirac semimetal, the magnetic space groups here can be either symmorphic or\nnon-symmorphic, and the magnetic DSM is symmetry tuned to the boundary between\nweak topologically distinct insulating phases. Interestingly, the\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations could lead to an ideal Weyl semimetal phase\nwith only two minimal Weyl points pinned exactly at the Fermi energy for\nfilling $\\nu\\in4\\mathbb{Z}+2$. By reducing the dimensionality we are able to\naccess the Dirac and Weyl semimetal phases in two dimensions.\n", "  Based on full-wave scattering theory with self-consistent mean field\napproximation, we study the optical multi-stability of graphene-wrapped\ndielectric nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the optical bistability (OB) of\nthe graphene-wrapped nanoparticle exist in both near-field and far-field\nspectra, and show the optical multi-stability arising from the contributions of\nhigher-order terms of the incident external field. Moreover, both the optical\nstable region and the switching threshold values can be tuned by changing\neither the Fermi level or the size of the nanoparticle. Our results promise the\ngraphene-wrapped dielectric nanoparticle a candidate of multi-state optical\nswitching, optical memories and relevant optoelectronic devices.\n", "  We theoretically study the role of nonlinear surface plasmoms on the optical\nbistability of graphene-wrapped dielectric cylinders, within the framework of\nboth full-wave scattering theory and the quasistatic limit. Typical hysteresis\ncurves are observed in both near-field and far-field spectra. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that introducing the full wave theory results in another bistable\nbehavior with a high applied electromagnetic field, suggesting a more explicit\nway in analyzing the unstable behavior of the graphene-wrapped dielectric\ncylinder. Furthermore, optical stable region and the switching threshold values\nare proved to be tunable by changing either the size, permittivity of the\nnanocylinder or the chemical potential of graphene, promising the\ngraphene-wrapped dielectric cylinder a candidate for all-optical switching and\nnano-memories.\n", "  The experimental device for generation of undulator radiation in terahertz\nwavelength region by use of undulator on ferromagnets is created. The device is\nbased on a beam of a microtrone with the energy 7.5 MeV. The radiation\nwavelength is 200 micron. Registered spontaneous radiation has a power of 10\nmicrowatt at a current of a beam 2 mA in a pulse. With the optical resonator,\nin a mode, the amplification of 6 percent is received, that in some times is\nmore than expected value. This effect is explained as a result of partial\ncoherence of radiation.\n", "  We report on our study of the D meson semileptonic decays in 2+1 flavor\nlattice QCD. Gauge ensembles are generated at three lattice cutoffs up to 4.5\nGeV and with pion masses as low as 300 MeV. We employ the Moebius domain-wall\nfermion action for both light and charm quarks. We report our preliminary\nresults for the vector and scalar form factors and discuss their dependence on\nthe momentum transfer, quark masses and lattice spacing.\n", "  During the flyby in 2010, the OSIRIS camera on-board Rosetta acquired\nhundreds of high-resolution images of asteroid Lutetia's surface through a\nrange of narrow-band filters. While Lutetia appears very bland in the visible\nwavelength range, Magrin et al. (2012) tentatively identified UV color\nvariations in the Baetica cluster, a group of relatively young craters close to\nthe north pole. As Lutetia remains a poorly understood asteroid, such color\nvariations may provide clues to the nature of its surface. We take the color\nanalysis one step further. First we orthorectify the images using a shape model\nand improved camera pointing, then apply a variety of techniques (photometric\ncorrection, principal component analysis) to the resulting color cubes. We\ncharacterize variegation in the Baetica crater cluster at high spatial\nresolution, identifying crater rays and small, fresh impact craters. We argue\nthat at least some of the color variation is due to space weathering, which\nmakes Lutetia's regolith redder and brighter.\n", "  In this paper we use the Nikiforv-Uvarov method to obtain the approximate\nsolutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with deformed five parameter exponential\ntype potential (DFPEP) model. We also obtain the solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in the presence of the DFPEP in the non-relativistic limits. In\naddition, we calculate in the nonrelativistic limits the thermodynamics\nproperties such as vibrational mean energy U, free energy F and the specific\nheat capacity C . Special cases of the potential are also discussed.\n", "  Mid-infrared 7-20 $\\mu$m imaging of Jupiter demonstrates that the increased\nalbedo of Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt (SEB) during the `fade' (whitening)\nevent of 2009-2010 was correlated with changes to atmospheric temperature and\naerosol opacity. The opacity of the tropospheric condensation cloud deck at\npressures less than 800 mbar increased by 80% between May 2008 and July 2010,\nmaking the SEB ($7-17^\\circ$ S) as opaque in the thermal infrared as the\nadjacent equatorial zone. After the cessation of discrete convective activity\nwithin the SEB in May 2009, a cool quiescent band of high aerosol opacity (the\nSEB zone at $11-15^\\circ$ S) was observed separating the cloud-free northern\nand southern SEB components. The cooling of the SEBZ (with peak-to-peak\ncontrasts of $1.0\\pm0.5$ K), as well as the increased aerosol opacity at 4.8\nand 8.6 $\\mu$m, preceded the visible whitening of the belt by several months. A\nchain of five warm, cloud-free `brown barges' (subsiding airmasses) were\nobserved regularly in the SEB between June 2009 and June 2010, by which time\nthey too had been obscured by the enhanced aerosol opacity of the SEB, although\nthe underlying warm circulation was still present in July 2010. The cool\ntemperatures and enhanced aerosol opacity of the SEBZ after July 2009 are\nconsistent with an upward flux of volatiles from deeper levels (e.g.,\nammonia-laden air) and enhanced condensation, obscuring the blue-absorbing\nchromophore and whitening the SEB by April 2010. Revival of the dark SEB\ncoloration in the coming months will ultimately require sublimation of these\nices by subsidence and warming of volatile-depleted air. [Abridged]\n", "  We present possible explanations of pulsations in early B-type main sequence\nstars which arise purely from the excitation of gravity modes. There are three\nstars with this type of oscillations detected from the BRITE light curves:\n$\\kappa$ Cen, a Car, $\\kappa$ Vel. We show that by changing metallicity or the\nopacity profile it is possible in some models to dump pressure modes keeping\ngravity modes unstable. Other possible scenario involves pulsations of a lower\nmass companion.\n", "  The transformation of Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt (SEB) from its faded,\nwhitened state in 2009-2010 to its normal brown appearance is documented via\ncomparisons of thermal-infrared (5-20 $\\mu$m) and visible-light imaging between\nNovember 2010 and November 2011. The SEB revival consisted of convective\neruptions triggered over $\\sim100$ days, potentially powered by the latent heat\nreleased by the condensation of water. The plumes rise from the water cloud\nbase and ultimately diverge and cool in the stably-stratified upper\ntroposphere. Thermal-IR images were acquired 2 days after the SEB disturbance\nwas first detected by amateur observers on November 9th 2010. Subsequent images\nrevealed the cold, putatively anticyclonic and cloudy plume tops surrounded by\nwarm, cloud-free conditions at their peripheries. The majority of the plumes\nerupted from a single source near $140-160^\\circ$W, coincident with the remnant\ncyclonic circulation of a brown barge that had formed during the fade.\nAdditional plumes erupted from the leading edge of the central disturbance\nimmediately east of the source. The tropospheric plumes excited stratospheric\nthermal waves over the SEB, showing a direct connection between moist\nconvection and stratospheric wave activity. The subsidence of dry, unsaturated\nair warmed the troposphere and removed the white aerosols. The aerosol-free air\nwas redistributed throughout the SEB by the zonal flow, following a\nwestward-moving southern branch and an eastward-moving northern branch that\nrevived the brown colouration over $\\sim200$ days. The last stage of the\nrevival was the re-establishment of normal convective activity northwest of the\nGRS in September 2011. Moist convection may therefore play an important role in\ncontrolling the timescale and atmospheric variability during the SEB life\ncycle. [Abridged]\n", "  We investigate the formation, activation and eruption of a flux rope from the\nsigmoid active region NOAA 11719 by analyzing E(UV), X-ray and radio\nmeasurements. During the pre-eruption period of ~7 hours, the AIA 94 A images\nreveal the emergence of a coronal sigmoid through the interaction between two\nJ-shaped bundles of loops which proceeds with multiple episodes of coronal loop\nbrightenings and significant variations in the magnetic flux through the\nphotosphere. These observations imply that repetitive magnetic reconnections\nlikely play a key role in the formation of the sigmoidal flux rope in the\ncorona and also contribute toward sustaining the temperature of the flux rope\nhigher than the ambient coronal structures. Notably, the formation of the\nsigmoid is associated with the fast morphological evolution of an S-shaped\nfilament channel in the chromosphere. The sigmoid activates toward eruption\nwith the ascend of a large flux rope in the corona which is preceded by the\ndecrease of photospheric magnetic flux through the core flaring region\nsuggesting tether-cutting reconnection as a possible triggering mechanism. The\nflux rope eruption results in a two-ribbon M6.5 flare with a prolonged rise\nphase of ~21 min. The flare exhibits significant deviation from the standard\nflare model in the early rise phase during which a pair of J-shaped flare\nribbons form and apparently exhibit converging motions parallel to the polarity\ninversion line which is further confirmed by the motions of HXR footpoint\nsources. In the later stages, the flare follows the standard flare model and\nthe source region undergoes a complete sigmoid-to-arcade transformation.\n", "  Recent works have shown how the [C/N] ratio in stars after the first\ndredge-up (FDU) can be used as an age estimator in virtue of its dependence on\nstellar mass. For this purpose, precise predictions of the surface chemical\ncomposition before and after the mixing takes place in the convective envelope\nof subgiant stars are necessary. Stellar evolution models can provide us with\nsuch predictions, although a comparision with objects of known age is needed\nfor calibration. Open clusters are excellent test cases, as they represent a\nsingle stellar population for which the age can be derived through, e.g.,\nisochrone fitting. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of stars\nbelonging to the well-known open cluster M67 observed by the APOGEE survey in\nthe twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and whose chemical\nproperties were derived with the ASPCAP pipeline. We find that the [C/N]\nabundance of subgiant branch stars is overestimated by $\\sim0.2$ dex due to an\noffset in the determination of the [N/Fe] abundance. Stars on the red giant\nbranch and red clump are shown not to be affected by this offset. We derive\n$\\text{[C/N]}_{FDU}=-0.46\\pm 0.03$ dex, which poses a strong constraint on\ncalibrations of $\\text{[C/N]}_{FDU}$ as age indicator. We also do not find any\nclear signature of additional chemical mixing processes that set in after the\nred giant branch bump. The results obtained for M67 indicate the importance of\nconducting high-resolution spectroscopic studies of open clusters of different\nages in order to establish an accurate age-dating method for field stars.\n", "  The secure communication of information plays an ever increasing role in our\nsociety today. Classical methods of encryption inherently rely on the\ndifficulty of solving a problem such as finding prime factors of large numbers\nand can, in principle, be cracked by a fast enough machine. The burgeoning\nfield of quantum communication relies on the fundamental laws of physics to\noffer unconditional information security. Here we introduce the key concepts of\nquantum superposition and entanglement as well as the no-cloning theorem that\nform the basis of this field. Then, we review basic quantum communication\nschemes with single and entangled photons and discuss recent experimental\nprogress in ground and space-based quantum communication. Finally, we discuss\nthe emerging field of high-dimensional quantum communication, which promises\nincreased data rates and higher levels of security than ever before. We discuss\nrecent experiments that use the orbital angular momentum of photons for sharing\nlarge amounts of information in a secure fashion.\n", "  Novelties are part of our daily lives. We constantly adopt new technologies,\nconceive new ideas, meet new people, experiment with new situations.\nOccasionally, we as individuals, in a complicated cognitive and sometimes\nfortuitous process, come up with something that is not only new to us, but to\nour entire society so that what is a personal novelty can turn into an\ninnovation at a global level. Innovations occur throughout social, biological\nand technological systems and, though we perceive them as a very natural\ningredient of our human experience, little is known about the processes\ndetermining their emergence. Still the statistical occurrence of innovations\nshows striking regularities that represent a starting point to get a deeper\ninsight in the whole phenomenology. This paper represents a small step in that\ndirection, focusing on reviewing the scientific attempts to effectively model\nthe emergence of the new and its regularities, with an emphasis on more recent\ncontributions: from the plain Simon's model tracing back to the 1950s, to the\nnewest model of Polya's urn with triggering of one novelty by another. What\nseems to be key in the successful modelling schemes proposed so far is the idea\nof looking at evolution as a path in a complex space, physical, conceptual,\nbiological, technological, whose structure and topology get continuously\nreshaped and expanded by the occurrence of the new. Mathematically it is very\ninteresting to look at the consequences of the interplay between the \"actual\"\nand the \"possible\" and this is the aim of this short review.\n", "  The ablation of solid tin surfaces by an 800-nanometer-wavelength laser is\nstudied for a pulse length range from 500 fs to 4.5 ps and a fluence range\nspanning 0.9 to 22 J/cm^2. The ablation depth and volume are obtained employing\na high-numerical-aperture optical microscope, while the ion yield and energy\ndistributions are obtained from a set of Faraday cups set up under various\nangles. We found a slight increase of the ion yield for an increasing pulse\nlength, while the ablation depth is slightly decreasing. The ablation volume\nremained constant as a function of pulse length. The ablation depth follows a\ntwo-region logarithmic dependence on the fluence, in agreement with the\navailable literature and theory. In the examined fluence range, the ion yield\nangular distribution is sharply peaked along the target normal at low fluences\nbut rapidly broadens with increasing fluence. The total ionization fraction\nincreases monotonically with fluence to a 5-6% maximum, which is substantially\nlower than the typical ionization fractions obtained with nanosecond-pulse\nablation. The angular distribution of the ions does not depend on the laser\npulse length within the measurement uncertainty. These results are of\nparticular interest for the possible utilization of fs-ps laser systems in\nplasma sources of extreme ultraviolet light for nanolithography.\n", "  In 1965, the discovery of a new type of uniform radiation, located between\nradiowaves and infrared light, was accidental. Known today as Cosmic Microwave\nbackground (CMB), this diffuse radiation is commonly interpreted as a fossil\nlight released in an early hot and dense universe and constitutes today the\nmain 'pilar' of the big bang cosmology. Considerable efforts have been devoted\nto derive fundamental cosmological parameters from the characteristics of this\nradiation that led to a surprising universe that is shaped by at least three\nmajor unknown components: inflation, dark matter and dark energy. This is an\nimportant weakness of the present consensus cosmological model that justifies\nraising several questions on the CMB interpretation. Can we consider its\ncosmological nature as undisputable? Do other possible interpretations exist in\nthe context of other cosmological theories or simply as a result of other\nphysical mechanisms that could account for it? In an effort to questioning the\nvalidity of scientific hypotheses and the under-determination of theories\ncompared to observations, we examine here the difficulties that still exist on\nthe interpretation of this diffuse radiation and explore other proposed tracks\nto explain its origin. We discuss previous historical concepts of diffuse\nradiation before and after the CMB discovery and underline the limit of our\npresent understanding.\n", "  In this thesis, we study the interplay of phase separation and wetting in\nmulticomponent systems. For this purpose, we have examined the phase separation\npattern of a binary mixture (AB) in presence of stationary spherical particles\n(C) which prefers one of the components of the binary (say, A). Binary AB is\ncomposed of critical composition(50:50) and off-critical compositions(60:40,\n40:60). Particle sizes of 8 units and 16 units are used in the simulations. Two\ntypes of particle loading are used, 5\\% and 10\\%. We have employed a ternary\nform of Cahn-Hilliard equation to incorporate immobile fillers in our system.\nTo elucidate the effect of wetting on phase separation we have designed three\nsets of $\\chi_{ij}$ and $\\kappa_{ij}$ to include the effects of neutral\npreference, weak preference and strong preference of the particle for one of\nthe binary components. If the particles are preferentially wetted by one of the\ncomponents then early stage microstructures show transient concentric alternate\nlayers of preferred and non-preferred phases around the particles. When\nparticles are neutral to binary components then such a ring pattern does not\nform. At late times, neutral preference between particles and binary components\nyields a continuous morphology whereas preferential wetting produces isolated\ndomains of non-preferred phases dispersed in a continuous matrix of preferred\nphase. For off-critical compositions, if minor component wets the particle then\na bicontinuous morphology results whereas if major component wets the network a\ndroplet morphology is seen. When majority component wets the particle, a\npossibility of double phase separation is reported. In such alloys phase\nseparation starts near the particle surface and propagates to the bulk at\nintermediate to late times forming spherical or nearly spherical droplets of\nthe minor component.\n", "  Planck units are natural physical scales of mass, length and time, built with\nthe help of the fundamental constants $\\hbar, c, G$. The functional role of the\nconstants used for the construction of Planck units is different. If the first\ntwo of them represent the limits of the action and the speed of light and\nunderlie quantum mechanics and special relativity, the Newton's constant $G$\n\"only\" fixes the absolute value of the gravitational forces. It seems natural\nto make a set of fundamental constants more consistent and more effective if\nused to build Planck units only limit values. To this end, in addition to the\nlimit values $\\hbar $ and $c$ we introduce an additional limit value - a\nmaximum power in nature. On the basis of these values, a modification of the\nPlanck unit system is proposed. The proposed modification leaves unchanged the\nnumerical values of Planck units, however, opens up exciting new possibilities\nfor interpreting the known results and for obtaining new ones.\n", "  The principal new point is that ultra-high spin of the elementary particles\nmakes Einstein's gravity so strong, that its influence to metric is shifted\nfrom Planck to the Compton scale! Compatibility of the Kerr-Newman (KN) gravity\nwith quantum theory is achieved by implementation of the supersymmetric Higgs\nmodel without modification of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We consider the\nnonperturbative bag-like solution to supersymmetric generalized LG field model,\nwhich creates a flat and supersymmetric vacuum state inside the bag, forming\nthe Compton zone for consistent work of quantum theory. The bag is deformable,\nand its shape is controlled by BPS bound, providing compatibility of the bag\nboundary with external gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) field. In\nparticular, for the spinning KN gravity the bag takes the form of oblate disk\nwith a circular string placed on the disk border. Excitations of the KN EM\nfield create circular traveling waves. The super-bag solution is naturally\nupgraded to the Wess-Zumino supersymmetric QED model, indicating a bridge from\nthe nonperturbative super-bag to perturbative formalism of the conventional\nQED.\n", "  In this paper we derive a cosmological model from the $f(R,T)$ theory of\ngravity, for which $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. We consider $f(R,T)=f(R)+f(T)$, with $f(R)$ being the\nStarobinksy model $R+\\alpha R^{2}$ and $f(T)=\\gamma T$, with $\\alpha$ and\n$\\gamma$ constants. We find that from such a functional form, it is possible to\ndescribe the cosmological scenario of a radiation-dominated universe, which has\nshown to be a non-trivial feature within the $f(R,T)$ formalism.\n", "  Complex systems in a wide variety of areas such as biological modeling, image\nprocessing, and language recognition can be modeled using networks of very\nsimple machines called finite automata. Connecting subsystems modeled using\nfinite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such\nnetwork, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n\n> 1 with a single finite automaton located at each point of the array. One of\nthe oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing\nsynchronization problem, originally proposed by John Myhill in 1957. As with\nany long-standing problem, there are a large number of solutions to the firing\nsynchronization problem. Our goal, and the contribution of this work, is to\nsummarize recent solutions to the problem. We focus primarily on solutions to\nthe original problem, that is, the problem where the network is a\none-dimensional array and there is a single initiator located at one of the\nends. We summarize both minimal-time and non-minimal-time solutions, with an\nemphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on\nsolutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata.\nIn the process we also identify open problems that remain in terms of finding\nminimal-state solutions to the firing synchronization problem.\n", "  In order to scrutinize the nature of Dark Energy, many Equations of State\nhave been proposed. In this context we examine four popular models (the\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, Jassal model, Barboza & Alcaniz model\nand Wetterich model) in the field of quintessence and barotropic dark energy\nmodels, to compare with each other. We develop a theoretical method of\nconstructing the quintessence potential directly from the four equations of\nstate which describes the properties of the dark energy.\n", "  The validity of the dissipative quantum model of olfaction has not been\nexamined yet and therefore the model suffers from the lack of experimental\nsupport. Here, we generalize the model and propose a numerical analysis of the\ndissipative odorant-mediated inelastic electron tunneling mechanism of\nolfaction, to be used as a potential examination in experiments. Our analysis\ngives several predictions on the model such as efficiency of elastic and\ninelastic tunneling of electrons through odorants, sensitivity thresholds in\nterms of temperature and pressure, isotopic effect on sensitivity, and the\nchiral recognition for discrimination between the similar and different scents.\nOur predictions should yield new knowledge to design new experimental protocols\nfor testing the validity of the model.\n", "  This paper presents the first MD simulations of a model, which we have\ndesigned for understanding the development of electro-induced instability of a\nthin toluene emulsion film in contact with saline aqueous phase. This study\ndemonstrates the charge accumulation role in toluene film rupture when a DC\nelectric field is applied. The critical value of the external field at which\nfilm ruptures, thin film charge distribution, capacitance, number densities and\nfilm structure have been obtained in simulating the system within NVT and NPT\nensembles. A mechanism of thin film rupture driven by the electric discharge is\nsuggested.We show that NPT ensemble with a constant surface tension is a better\nchoice for further modeling of the systems that resemble more close the real\nfilms.\n", "  In this paper, we discussed the non-local derivative on the fractal Cantor\nset. The scaling properties are given for both local and non-local fractal\nderivatives. The local and non-local fractal differential equations are solved\nand compared and related physical models are suggested.\n", "  A phenomenon can hardly be found that accompanied physical paradigms and\ntheoretical concepts in a more reflecting way than magnetism. From the\nbeginnings of metaphysics and the first classical approaches to magnetic poles\nand streamlines of the field, it has inspired modern physics on its way to the\nclassical field description of electrodynamics, and further to the quantum\nmechanical description of internal degrees of freedom of elementary particles.\nMeanwhile, magnetic manifestations have posed and still do pose complex and\noften controversially debated questions. This regards so various and utterly\ndistinct topics as quantum spin systems and the grand unification theory. This\nmay be foremost caused by the fact that all of these effects are based on\ncorrelated structures, which are induced by the interplay of dynamics and\nelementary interactions. It is strongly correlated systems that certainly\nrepresent one of the most fascinating and universal fields of research. In\nparticular, low dimensional systems are in the focus of interest, as they\nreveal strongly pronounced correlations of counterintuitive nature. As regards\nthis framework, the quantum Hall effect must be seen as one of the most\nintriguing and complex problems of modern solid state physics. Even after two\ndecades and the same number of Nobel prizes, it still keeps researchers of\nnearly all fields of physics occupied. In spite of seminal progress, its\ninherent correlated order still lacks understanding on a microscopic level.\nDespite this, it is obvious that the phenomenon is thoroughly fundamental of\nnature. To resolve some puzzles of this nature is a key topic of this thesis.\n(excerpt from abstract)\n", "  Editorial for the Special Issue of \"Zeitschrift fuer Physikalische Chemie\" on\n\"Hierarchical Colloidal Nanostructures\"\n", "  Numerical and experimental turbulence simulations are nowadays reaching the\nsize of the so-called big data, thus requiring refined investigative tools for\nappropriate statistical analyses and data mining. We present a new approach\nbased on the complex network theory, offering a powerful framework to explore\ncomplex systems with a huge number of interacting elements. Although interest\non complex networks has been increasing in the last years, few recent studies\nhave been applied to turbulence. We propose an investigation starting from a\ntwo-point correlation for the kinetic energy of a forced isotropic field\nnumerically solved. Among all the metrics analyzed, the degree centrality is\nthe most significant, suggesting the formation of spatial patterns which\ncoherently move with similar vorticity over the large eddy turnover time scale.\nPattern size can be quantified through a newly-introduced parameter (i.e.,\naverage physical distance) and varies from small to intermediate scales. The\nnetwork analysis allows a systematic identification of different spatial\nregions, providing new insights into the spatial characterization of turbulent\nflows. Based on present findings, the application to highly inhomogeneous flows\nseems promising and deserves additional future investigation.\n", "  A CW-compatible, pulsed H- superconducting linac \"PIP-II\" is being planned to\nupgrade Fermilab's injection complex. To validate the front-end concept, a test\naccelerator (The PIP-II Injector Test, formerly known as \"PXIE\") is under\nconstruction. The warm part of this accelerator comprises a 10 mA DC, 30 keV H-\nion source, a 2 m-long Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a 2.1 MeV Radio\nFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) capable of operation in Continuous Wave (CW) mode,\nand a 10 m-long Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT). The paper will report on\nthe installation of the RFQ and the first sections of the MEBT and related\nmechanical design considerations.\n", "  This paper examines the behavior of the dimensionless dissipation rate\n$C_{\\varepsilon}$ for stationary and nonstationary magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence in presence of external forces. By combining with previous studies\nfor freely decaying MHD turbulence, we obtain here both the most general model\nequation for $C_{\\varepsilon}$ applicable to homogeneous MHD turbulence and a\ncomprehensive numerical study of the Reynolds number dependence of the\ndimensionless total energy dissipation rate at unity magnetic Prandtl number.\nWe carry out a series of medium to high resolution direct numerical simulations\nof mechanically forced stationary MHD turbulence in order to verify the\npredictions of the model equation for the stationary case. Furthermore,\nquestions of nonuniversality are discussed in terms of the effect of external\nforces as well as the level of cross- and magnetic helicity. The measured\nvalues of the asymptote $C_{\\varepsilon,\\infty}$ lie between $0.193 \\leqslant\nC_{\\varepsilon,\\infty} \\leqslant 0.268$ for free decay, where the value depends\non the initial level of cross- and magnetic helicities. In the stationary case\nwe measure $C_{\\varepsilon,\\infty} = 0.223$.\n", "  We demonstrate vector magnetometry with an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamond without the need for an external bias field. The anisotropy\nof the electric dipole moments of the NV center reduces the ambiguity of the\noptically detected magnetic resonances upon polarized visible excitation.\nFurther lifting of the remaining ambiguities is achieved via application of an\nappropriately linearly polarized microwave field, which enables suppression of\nspin-state transitions of a certain crystallographic NV orientation. This\nallows for the full vector reconstruction of small (less 0.1 mT) magnetic\nfields without an external bias field having to interfere with the magnetic\nstructure.\n", "  Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature\nwith durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an\nextragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger\nthan any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst\nhaving a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent\nstar-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of\nextragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly\nfaint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct\nsub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable\nassociations.\n"]}
