Toda systems and\nobtain a new class of integrable systems in a specific limit of the elliptic\nSL(N,C) top. The relation is based on the Inozemtsev limit (IL) and a\nsymplectic map from the elliptic Calogero-Moser system to the elliptic SL(N,C)\ntop. In the case when N=2 we use an explicit form of a symplectic map from the\nphase space of the elliptic Calogero-Moser system to the phase space of the\nelliptic SL(2,C) top and show that the limiting tops are equivalent to the Toda\nchains. In the case when N>2 we generalize the above procedure using only the\nlimiting behavior of Lax matrices. In a specific limit we also obtain a more\ngeneral class of systems and prove the integrability in the Liouville sense of\na certain subclass of these systems. This class is described by a classical\nr-matrix obtained from an elliptic r-matrix.\n", "  This is an expository account of Balaban's approach to the renormalization\ngroup. The method is illustrated with a treatment of the the ultraviolet\nproblem for the scalar phi^4 model on a toroidal lattice in dimension d=3. This\nyields another proof of the stability bound. In this first paper we analyze the\nsmall field contribution to the partition function.\n", "  In this article, we study the light-flavor scalar and axial-vector diquark\nstates in the vacuum and in the nuclear matter using the QCD sum rules in an\nsystematic way, and make reasonable predictions for their masses in the vacuum\nand in the nuclear matter.\n", "  We present our near-infrared (NIR) imaging observations of two neutron star\nlow mass X-ray binaries XMMU J174716.1-281048 and SAX J1806.5-2215 obtained\nusing the PANIC instrument on the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope and the WHIRC\ninstrument on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope respectively. Both sources are\nmembers of the class of faint to very-faint X-ray binaries and undergo very\nlong X-ray outburst, hence classified as `quasi persistent X-ray binaries'.\nWhile XMMU J174716.1-281048 was active for almost 12 years between 2003 and\n2015, SAX J1806.5-2215 has been active for more than 5 years now since 2011.\nFrom our observations, we identify two NIR stars consistent with the Chandra\nX-ray error circle of XMMU J174716.1-281048. The comparison of our observations\nwith the UKIRT Galactic plane observations taken during the same outburst,\ncolor-color diagram analysis and spectral energy distribution suggest that both\nstars are probably a part of the field population and are likely high mass\nstars. Hence possibly neither of the two stars is a true NIR counterpart. For\nthe faint X-ray binary SAX J1806.5-2215 during its current outburst, we\ndetected a NIR star in our K band WIYN observations consistent with its Chandra\nerror circle. The identified NIR star was not detected during the UKIRT\nobservations taken during its quiescent state. The comparison of two\nobservations suggest that there was an increase in flux by at least one\nmagnitude of the detected star during our observations, hence suggests the\ndetection of the likely counterpart of SAX J1806.5-2215.\n", "  We investigate AdS3/CFT2 correspondence in three dimensional supergravity. We\nconstruct a current for general coordinate invariance and that for local\nsupersymmetry via covariant approach. Hamiltonian and supercharge are well\ndefined in terms of vielbein and spin connection. After discussing asymptotic\nsupersymmetry group at the boundary of AdS3 geometry, we show that there exist\na direct product of Virasoro algebras at the boundary. We also show that one of\nthem is extended to super Virasoro algebra.\n", "  Propotional paths as summed up by the Goldscheider Rule (GR) -- stating that\ngiven a constant strain rate, the evolution of the stress maintains the ratios\nof its components -- is a characteristics of elasto-plastic motion in granular\nmedia. Barodesy, a constitutive relation proposed recently by Kolymbas, is a\nmodel that, with GR as input, successfully accounts for data from soil\nmechanical experiments. Granular solid hydrodynamics (GSH), a theory derived\nfrom general principles of physics and two assumptions about the basic behavior\nof granular media, is constructed to qualitatively account for a wide range of\nobservation -- from elastic waves over elasto-plastic motion to rapid dense\nflow. In this paper, showing the close resemblance of results from Barodesy and\nGSH, we further validate GSH and provide an understanding for GR.\n", "  This is an expository account of Balaban's approach to the renormalization\ngroup. The method is illustrated with a treatment of the the ultraviolet\nproblem for the scalar phi^4 model on toroidal lattice in dimension d=3. In\nthis second paper we control the large field contribution to the partition\nfunction.\n", "  Nuclear processes in solid environment are investigated. It is shown that if\na slow, quasi-free heavy particle of positive charge interacts with a \"free\"\nelectron of a metallic host, it can obtain such a great magnitude of momentum\nin its intermediate state that the probability of its nuclear reaction with an\nother positively charged, slow, heavy particle can significantly increase. It\nis also shown that if a quasi-free heavy particle of positive charge of\nintermediately low energy interacts with a heavy particle of positive charge of\nthe solid host, it can obtain much greater momentum relative to the former case\nin the intermediate state and consequently, the probability of a nuclear\nreaction with a positively charged, heavy particle can even more increase. This\nmechanism opens the door to a great variety of nuclear processes which up till\nknow are thought to have negligible rate at low energies. Low energy nuclear\nreactions allowed by the Coulomb assistance of heavy charged particles is\npartly overviewed. Nuclear $pd$ and $dd$ reactions are investigated\nnumerically. It was found that the leading channel in all the discussed charged\nparticle assisted $dd$ reactions is the electron assisted $d+d\\rightarrow $\n$^{4}He$ process.\n", "  It is recognized that in the family of heavy charged particle and electron\nassisted double nuclear processes resonance-like behavior can appear. The\ntransition rates of the heavy particle assisted 3rd-order and electron assisted\n4th-order resonance like double nuclear processes are determined. The power of\nlow energy nuclear reactions in $Ni-H$ systems formed in $Ni$ placed in $H_{2}$\ngas environment is treated. Nuclear power produced by quasi-resonant electron\nassisted double nuclear processes in these $Ni-H$ systems is calculated. The\npower obtained tallies with experiments and its magnitude is considerable for\npractical applications.\n", "  We solve a spectral and an inverse spectral problem arising in the\ncomputation of peakon solutions to the two-component PDE derived by Geng and\nXue as a generalization of the Novikov and Degasperis-Procesi equations. Like\nthe spectral problems for those equations, this one is of a 'discrete cubic\nstring' type -- a nonselfadjoint generalization of a classical inhomogeneous\nstring -- but presents some interesting novel features: there are two Lax\npairs, both of which contribute to the correct complete spectral data, and the\nsolution to the inverse problem can be expressed using quantities related to\nCauchy biorthogonal polynomials with two different spectral measures. The\nlatter extends the range of previous applications of Cauchy biorthogonal\npolynomials to peakons, which featured either two identical, or two closely\nrelated, measures. The method used to solve the spectral problem hinges on the\nhidden presence of oscillatory kernels of Gantmacher-Krein type implying that\nthe spectrum of the boundary value problem is positive and simple. The inverse\nspectral problem is solved by a method which generalizes, to a nonselfadjoint\ncase, M. G. Krein's solution of the inverse problem for the Stieltjes string.\n", "  The continuum equations of fluid mechanics are rederived with the intention\nof keeping certain mechanical and thermodynamic concepts separate. A new\n\"mechanical\" mass density is created to be used in computing inertial\nquantities, whereas the actual mass density is treated as a thermodynamic\nvariable. A new set of balance laws is proposed, including a mass balance\nequation with a non-convective flux. The basic principles of irreversible\nthermodynamics are used to obtain linear constitutive equations that are\nexpansions of--not only the usual affinities involving gradients of temperature\nand velocity--but also the gradient of the chemical potential. Transport\ncoefficients are then chosen based on an elementary diffusion model, which\nyields simple constitutive laws featuring just two transport parameters: one\nfor the longitudinal part of the motion and one for the rotational part. The\nresulting formulation differs from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations of fluid\nmotion. In order to highlight key similarities and differences between the two\napproaches, several examples in fluid mechanics are treated in part II,\nincluding sound propagation, light scattering, steady-state shock waves,\nthermophoresis, and Poiseuille flow.\n", "  We investigate a bunch of D0-branes to reveal its quantum nature from the\ngravity side. In the classical limit, it is well described by a non-extremal\nblack 0-brane in type IIA supergravity. The solution is uplifted to the eleven\ndimensions and expressed by a non-extremal M-wave solution. After reviewing the\neffective action for the M-theory, we explicitly solve the equations of motion\nfor the near horizon geometry of the M-wave. As a result we derive an unique\nsolution which includes the effect of the quantum gravity. Thermodynamic\nproperty of the quantum near horizon geometry of the black 0-brane is also\nstudied by using Wald's formula. Combining our result with that of the Monte\nCarlo simulation of the dual thermal gauge theory, we find strong evidence for\nthe gauge/gravity duality in the D0-branes system at the level of quantum\ngravity.\n", "  Electron assisted neutron exchange process in solid state environment is\ninvestigated. It is shown that if a metal is irradiated with free electrons\nthen the $e+$ $_{Z}^{A_{1}}X+$ $_{Z}^{A_{2}}X\\rightarrow e^{\\prime }+$\n$%_{Z}^{A_{1}-1}X+$ $_{Z}^{A_{2}+1}X+\\Delta $ electron assisted neutron\nexchange process has measurable probability even in the case of slow electrons\nof energy much less than the reaction energy $\\Delta $. The transition\nprobability per unit time, the cross section of the process and the yield in an\nirradiated sample are determined in the Weisskopf and long wavelength\napproximations and in the single particle shell model. Numerical data for the\n$e+$ $_{28}^{A_{1}}Ni+$ $_{28}^{A_{2}}Ni\\rightarrow e^{\\prime }+ $\n$_{28}^{A_{1}+1}Ni+$ $_{28}^{A_{2}-1}Ni+\\Delta $ and the $e+$\n$%_{46}^{A_{1}}Pd+$ $_{46}^{A_{2}}Pd\\rightarrow e^{\\prime }+$\n$%_{46}^{A_{1}+1}Pd+$ $_{46}^{A_{2}-1}Pd+\\Delta $ electron assisted neutron\nexchange reactions are also presented.\n", "  The electron assisted low energy $dd$ reactions in deuterized metals are\ninvestigated. It is shown that if a metal is irradiated with slow, free\ndeuterons then the $e+d+d\\rightarrow e^{\\prime }+p+t$ and $e+d+d\\rightarrow\ne^{\\prime }+n+$ $^{3}He$\\ electron assisted $dd$ processes will have measurable\nprobabilities even in the case of slow deuterons. The cross sections and the\nyields in an irradiated sample are determined. The results are associated with\nthe so called anomalous screening effect. It is concluded that the electron\n$dd$ processes have to be taken into account when evaluating the experimental\ndata of low energy fusion reactions in metals.\n", "  When we consider five-dimensional warped Taub-NUT/Bolt AdS black string with\nminimally coupled massive scalar field, we calculate entropy by using the brick\nwall method. It is found that they are proportional to being quadratically\ndivergent in a cutoff parameter. In particular, we show that the entropy of\nwarped Taub-NUT AdS black string holds for an area law in the bulk as well as\non the brane. Furthermore, when the negative cosmological constant is treated\nas thermodynamic pressure, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities and\ninvestigate their extended thermodynamic properties. Interestingly, we obtain a\nthermodynamically stable range as a function of the temperature for warped\nTaub-NUT AdS black string. Finally, we also study a proportional behavior of\nthe thermodynamic quantities along a warp factor, and find that an entropy, a\nspecific heat, a Gibbs free energy, and an action difference increase as a warp\nfactor grows up.\n", "  The minimal time required for a system to evolve between two different states\nis an important notion for developing ultra-speed quantum computer and\ncommunication channel. Here, we introduce a new metric for non-degenerate\ndensity operator evolving along unitary orbit and show that this is\nexperimentally realizable operation dependent metric on quantum state space.\nUsing this metric, we obtain the geometric uncertainty relation that leads to a\nnew quantum speed limit. Furthermore, we argue that this gives a tighter bound\nfor the evolution time compared to any other bound. We also obtain a Levitin\nkind of bound for mixed states. We propose how to measure this new distance and\nspeed limit in quantum interferometry. Finally, the lower bound for the\nevolution time of a quantum system is studied for any completely positive trace\npreserving map using this metric.\n", "  We prove that compact Cauchy horizons in a smooth spacetime satisfying the\nnull energy condition are smooth. As an application, we consider the problem of\ndetermining when a cobordism admits Lorentzian metrics with certain properties.\nIn particular, we prove a result originally due to Tipler without the\nsmoothness hypothesis necessary in the original proof.\n", "  This paper describes a programme to map large-scale cosmic structures on the\nlargest possible scales by using the Five hundred metre Aperture Spherical\nTelescope (FAST) to make a 21 cm (red-shifted) intensity map of the sky for the\nrange $0.5 < z < 2.5$. The goal is to map to the angular and spectral\nresolution of FAST a large swath of the sky by simple drift scans with a\ntransverse set of beams. This approach would be complementary to galaxy surveys\nand could be completed before the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could begin a\nmore detailed and precise effort. The science would be to measure the\nlarge-scale structure on the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations and\nlarger scale, and the results would be complementary to its contemporary\nobservations and significant. The survey would be uniquely sensitive to the\npotential very large-scale features from inflation at the Grand Unified Theory\n(GUT) scale and complementary to observations of the cosmic microwave\nbackground.\n", "  The effective action of superstring theory or M-theory is approximated by\nsupergravity in the low energy limit, and quantum corrections to the\nsupergravity are taken into account by including higher derivative terms. In\nthis paper, we consider equations of motion with those higher derivative terms\nin M-theory and solve them to derive quantum M-wave solution. A quantum black\n0-brane solution is also obtained by Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of the\nM-wave solution. The quantum black 0-brane is asymptotically flat and uniquely\ndetermined by imposing appropriate conditions. The mass and the R-R charge of\nthe quantum black 0-brane are derived by using the ADM mass and the charge\nformulae, and we see that only the mass is affected by the quantum correction.\nVarious limits of the quantum black 0-brane are also considered, and especially\nwe show that an internal energy in the near horizon limit is correctly\nreproduced.\n", "  A unified continuum-mechanical theory has been until now lacking for granular\nmedia, some believe it could not exist. Derived employing the hydrodynamic\napproach, GSH is such a theory, though as yet a qualitative one. The behavior\nbeing accounted for includes static stress distribution, elastic wave,\nelasto-plastic motion, the critical state and rapid dense flow. The equations\nand application to a few typical experiments are presented here.\n", "  Granular solid hydrodynamics (GSH) is a continuum-mechanical theory for\ngranular media, the range of which is shown in this paper. Simple, frequently\nanalytic solutions are related to classic observations at different shear\nrates, including: (i)~static stress distribution, clogging; (ii)~elasto-plastic\nmotion: loading and unloading, approach to the critical state, angle of\nstability and repose; (iii)~rapid dense flow: the $\\mu$-rheology, Bagnold\nscaling and the stress minimum; (iv)~elastic waves, compaction, wide and narrow\nshear band. Less conventional experiments have also been considered: shear\njamming, creep flow, visco-elastic behavior and nonlocal fluidization. With all\nthese phenomena ordered, related, explained and accounted for, though\nfrequently qualitatively, we believe that GSH may be taken as a unifying\nframework, providing the appropriate macroscopic vocabulary and mindset that\nhelp one coming to terms with the breadth of granular physics.\n", "  We discovered a fractional Chern structure in chiral superconducting\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$ nanofilms by employing electric transport. By using Sr$_2$RuO$_4$\nsingle crystals with nanoscale thickness, a fractional Hall conductance was\nobserved without an external magnetic field. The Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ nanofilms\nenhanced the superconducting transition temperature to about 3 K. We found an\nanomalous induced voltage with temperature and thickness dependence, and the\nswitching behavior of the induced voltage appeared when we applied a magnetic\nfield. We suggest that there was fractional magnetic-field-induced electric\npolarization in the interlayer. These anomalous results are related to\ntopological invariance. The fractional axion angle $\\theta=\\pi/6$ is determined\nby observing the topological magneto-electric effect in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$\nnanofilms.\n", "  Definitions of orbital angular momentum based on Wigner distributions are\nused to discuss the connection between the Ji definition of the quark orbital\nangular momentum and that of Jaffe and Manohar. The difference between these\ntwo definitions can be interpreted as the change in the quark orbital angular\nmomentum as it leaves the target in a DIS experiment. The mechanism responsible\nfor that change is similar to the mechanism that causes transverse single-spin\nasymmetries in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering.\n", "  Non-quasiparticle (incoherent) states which play an important role in the\nelectronic structure of half-metallic ferromagnets (HMF) are investigated\nconsistently in the case of antiferromagnetic $s-d(f)$ exchange interaction.\nTheir appropriate description in the limit of strong correlations requires a\nrearrangement of perturbation series in comparison with the usual Dyson\nequation. This consideration provides a solution of the Kondo problem in the\nHMF case and can be important for first-principle HMF calculations performed\nearlier for ferromagnetic $s-d(f)$ interaction.\n", "  The features of electron assisted neutron exchange processes in crystalline\nsolids are survayed. It is stated that, contrary to expectations, the cross\nsection of these processes may reach an observable magnitude even in the very\nlow energy case because of the extremely huge increment caused by the Coulomb\nfactor of the electron assisted processes and by the effect of the\ncrystal-lattice. The features of electron assisted heavy charged particle\nexchange processes, electron assisted nuclear capure processes and heavy\ncharged particle assisted nuclear processes are also overviewed. Experimental\nobservations, which may be related to our theoretical findings, are dealt with.\nThe anomalous screening phenomenon is related to electron assisted neutron and\nproton exchange processes in crystalline solids. A possible explanation of\nobservations by Fleischmann and Pons is presented. The possibility of the\nphenomenon of nuclear transmutation is qualitatively explained with the aid of\nusual and charged particle assisted reactions. The electron assisted neutron\nexchange processes in pure $Ni$ and $Li-Ni$ composite systems (in the\nRossi-type E-Cat) are analyzed and it is concluded that these reactions may be\nresponsible for recent experimental observations.\n", "  We take into account higher derivative R4 corrections in M-theory and\nconstruct quantum black hole and black string solutions in 11 dimensions up to\nthe next leading order. The quantum black string is stretching along the 11th\ndirection and the Gregory-Laflamme instability is examined at the quantum\nlevel. Thermodynamics of the boosted quantum black hole and black string are\nalso discussed. Especially we take the near horizon limit of the quantum black\nstring and investigate its instability quantitatively.\n", "  We study a normalized version of the second order renormalization group flow\non closed Riemannian surfaces. We discuss some general properties of this flow\nand establish several basic formulas. In particular, we focus on surfaces with\nzero and positive Euler characteristic.\n", "  $D$-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is addressed for square root power\nlaw potential. Bound state unnormalized eigenfunctions and the energy\neigenvalues are obtained using wave function ansatz method. Some special cases\nare studied at the end to ensure the correctness of present work.\n", "  Researchers have reported (i) correlations of coronal mass ejection (CME)\nspeeds and the total photospheric magnetic flux swept out by flare ribbons in\nflare-associated eruptive events, and, separately, (ii) correlations of CME\nspeeds and more rapid decay, with height, of magnetic fields in potential\ncoronal models above eruption sites. Here, we compare the roles of both ribbon\nfluxes and the decay rates of overlying fields in a set of 16 eruptive events.\nWe confirm previous results that higher CME speeds are associated with both\nlarger ribbon fluxes and more rapidly decaying overlying fields. We find the\nassociation with ribbon fluxes to be weaker than a previous report, but\nstronger than the dependence on the decay rate of overlying fields. Since the\nphotospheric ribbon flux is thought to approximate the amount of coronal\nmagnetic flux reconnected during the event, the correlation of speeds with\nribbon fluxes suggests that reconnection plays some role in accelerating CMEs.\nOne possibility is that reconnected fields that wrap around the rising ejection\nproduce an increased outward hoop force, thereby increasing CME acceleration.\nThe correlation of CME speeds with more rapidly decaying overlying fields might\nbe caused by greater downward magnetic tension in stronger overlying fields,\nwhich could act as a source of drag on rising ejections.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states at half integer Landau\nfillings ($\\nu$) have long been of great interest, since they have correlations\nthat differ from those of the fundamental Laughlin states found at odd\ndenominators. At $\\nu=1/2$ the FQHE has been observed in wide or double quantum\nwells, and is ascribed to the two-component Halperin-Laughlin $\\Psi_{331}$\nstate. $\\Psi_{331}$ excitations carry charge $\\pm e/4$, like the carriers of\n$\\nu=5/2$ states which are of interest in quantum computation. Further, such an\nexcitation (quasiparticle or -hole) of $\\Psi_{331}$ has unequal, opposite\ncharge in the top and bottom layers, and hence an up or down dipole moment.\nHere we report evidence for a Wigner solid (WS) of such dipolar quasiholes from\na quantitative study of the microwave spectra of a wide quantum well (WQW) at\n$\\nu$ close to 1/2.\n", "  In this paper we classify all four dimensional real Lie bialgebras of\nsymplectic type. The classical r- matrices for these Lie bialgebras and Poisson\nstructures on all of the related four dimensional Poisson-Lie groups are also\nobtained. Some new integrable models for which the Poisson-Lie group plays the\nrole as a phase space and its dual Lie group plays the role of a symmetry group\nof the system, are obtained.\n", "  In this paper, an existence theory is established for ring-profiled optical\nvortex solitons. We consider such solitons in the context of an electromagnetic\nlight wave propagating in a self-focusing nonlinear media and governed by a\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger type equation. A variational principle and constrained\nminimization approach is used to prove the existence of positive solutions for\nan undetermined wave propagation constant. We provide a series of explicit\nestimates related to the wave propagation constant, a prescribed energy flux,\nand vortex winding number. Further, on a Nehari manifold, the existence of\npositive solutions for a wide range of parameter values is proved. We also\nprovide numerical analysis to illustrate the behavior of the soliton's\namplitude and wave propagation constant with respect to a prescribed energy\nflux and vortex winding number.\n", "  Generation of thermal convection flow in the liquid metal battery, a device\nrecently proposed as a promising solution for the problem of the short-term\nenergy storage, is analyzed using a numerical model. It is found that\nconvection caused by Joule heating of electrolyte during charging or\ndischarging is virtually unavoidable. It exists in laboratory prototypes larger\nthan a few cm in size and should become much stronger in larger-scale\nbatteries. The phenomenon needs further investigation in view of its positive\n(enhanced mixing of reactants) and negative (loss of efficiency and possible\ndisruption of operation due to the flow-induced deformation of the electrolyte\nlayer) effects.\n", "  The eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite (XCLASS) is a toolbox for the\nCommon Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA) containing new functions\nfor modeling interferometric and single dish data. Among the tools is the\nmyXCLASS program which calculates synthetic spectra by solving the radiative\ntransfer equation for an isothermal object in one dimension, whereas the finite\nsource size and dust attenuation are considered as well. Molecular data\nrequired by the myXCLASS program are taken from an embedded SQLite3 database\ncontaining entries from the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy CDMS)\nand JPL using the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Center (VAMDC) portal.\nAdditionally, the toolbox provides an interface for the model optimizer package\nModeling and Analysis Generic Interface for eXternal numerical codes (MAGIX),\nwhich helps to find the best description of observational data using myXCLASS\n(or another external model program), i.e., finding the parameter set that most\nclosely reproduces the data.\n", "  A mechanical analogy is used to analyze the interaction between the magnetic\nfield, electric current and deformation of interfaces in liquid metal\nbatteries. It is found that, during charging or discharging, a sufficiently\nlarge battery is prone to instabilities of two types. One is similar to the\nmetal pad instability known for aluminum reduction cells. Another type is new.\nIt is related to the destabilizing effect of the Lorentz force formed by the\nazimuthal magnetic field induced by the base current and the current\nperturbations caused by the local variations of the thickness of the\nelectrolyte layer.\n", "  Since the discovery of half-filled cuprate to be a Mott insulator, the\nexcitation spectra above the chemical potential for the unoccupied states has\nattracted many research attentions. There were many theoretical works using\ndifferent numerical techniques to study this problem, but many have reached\ndifferent conclusions. One of the reasons is the lack of very detailed\nhigh-resolution experimental results for the theories to be compared with.\nRecently, the scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n(STS)\\cite{cai2015visualizing,ye2013visualizing} on lightly doped Mott\ninsulator with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order found the presence of in-gap\nstates with energy of order half an eV above the chemical potential. The\nmeasured spectral properties with doping are not quite consistent with earlier\ntheoretical works. In this paper we perform a diagonalization method on top of\nthe variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculation to study the evolution of AFM\nMott state with doped hole concentration in the Hubbard model (HM). Our results\nfound in-gap states that behave similarly with ones reported by STS. These\nin-gap states acquire a substantial amount of dynamical spectral weight\ntransferred from the upper Hubbard band. The in-gap states move toward chemical\npotential with increasing spectral weight as doping increases. Our result also\nprovides information about the energy scale of these in-gap states in relation\nwith the coulomb coupling strength U.\n", "  Quark matter which contains s-quarks in addition to u- and d- could be stable\nor metastable. In this case, lumps made of this strange matter, called\nstrangelets, could occasionally hit the Earth. When travelling through the\natmosphere they would behave not dissimilar to usual high-velocity meteors with\nonly exception that, eventually, strangelets reach the surface. As these\nencounters are expected to be extremely rare events, very large exposure is\nneeded for their observation. Fluorescence detectors utilized in large\nultra-high energy cosmic ray observatories, such as the Pierre Auger\nobservatory and the Telescope Array are well suited for a task of the detection\nof these events. The flux limits that can be obtained with the Telescope Array\nfluorescence detectors could be as low as $5\\times\n10^{-22}~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ which would improve by 1.5 orders of magnitude\nthe strongest present limits obtained from ancient mica crystals.\n", "  A relaxed primordial power spectrum (PPS) of scalar perturbations arising\nfrom inflation can impact the dark radiation constraints obtained from Cosmic\nMicrowave Background and other cosmological measurements. If inflation produces\na non-standard PPS for the initial fluctuations, a fully thermalized light\nsterile neutrino can be favoured by CMB observations, instead of being strongly\ndisfavoured. In the case of a thermal axion, the constraints on the axion mass\nare relaxed when the PPS is different from the standard power law.\n", "  There is now strong evidence that Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) are\npreferentially formed in low-metallicity environments. However, the magnitude\nof this effect, and its functional dependence on metallicity have not been well\ncharacterized. In our previous paper, Graham & Fruchter (2013), we compared the\nmetallicity distribution of LGRB host galaxies to the that of star forming\ngalaxies in the local universe. Here we build upon this work by in effect\ndividing one distribution by the other, and thus directly determine the\nrelative rate of LGRB formation as a function of metallicity in the\nlow-redshift universe. We find a dramatic cutoff in LGRB formation above a\nmetallicity of log(O/H)}+12 ~ 8.3 in the KK04 scale, with LGRBs forming between\nten and fifty times more frequently per unit star-formation below this cutoff\nthan above. Furthermore, our data suggests that the rate of LGRB formation per\nunit star formation continues to fall above this break. We estimate the LGRB\nformation rate per unit star formation may drop by as much as a factor of one\nhundred between one-third solar and solar metallicity.\n", "  Synthetic photonic materials are an emerging platform for exploring the\ninterface between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic material\nproperties[1-5]. Photons experiencing a Lorentz force develop handedness,\nproviding opportunities to study quantum Hall physics and topological quantum\nscience[6-8]. Here we present an experimental realization of a magnetic field\nfor continuum photons. We trap optical photons in a multimode ring resonator to\nmake a two-dimensional gas of massive bosons, and then employ a non-planar\ngeometry to induce an image rotation on each round-trip[9]. This results in\nphotonic Coriolis/Lorentz and centrifugal forces and so realizes the\nFock-Darwin Hamiltonian for photons in a magnetic field and harmonic trap[10].\nUsing spatial- and energy-resolved spectroscopy, we track the resulting\nphotonic eigenstates as radial trapping is reduced, finally observing a\nphotonic Landau level at degeneracy. To circumvent the challenge of trap\ninstability at the centrifugal limit[10,11], we constrain the photons to move\non a cone. Spectroscopic probes demonstrate flat space (zero curvature) away\nfrom the cone tip. At the cone tip, we observe that spatial curvature increases\nthe local density of states, and we measure fractional state number excess\nconsistent with the Wen-Zee theory, providing an experimental test of this\ntheory of electrons in both a magnetic field and curved space[12-15]. This work\nopens the door to exploration of the interplay of geometry and topology, and in\nconjunction with Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, enables\nstudies of photonic fractional quantum Hall fluids[16,17] and direct detection\nof anyons[18-19].\n", "  We study the Einstein-singleton theory during de Sitter inflation since it\nprovides a way of degenerate fourth-order scalar theory. We obtain an exact\nsolution expressed in terms of the exponential-integral function by solving the\ndegenerate fourth-order scalar equation in de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we\nfind that its power spectrum blows negatively up in the superhorizon limit,\nwhile it is negatively scale-invariant in the subhorizon limit. This suggests\nthat the Einstein-singleton theory contains the ghost-instability and thus, it\nis not suitable for developing a slow-roll inflation model.\n", "  Simulations based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models have been\nused to support high-consequence decisions related to turbulent flows. Apart\nfrom the deterministic model predictions, the decision makers are often equally\nconcerned about the predictions confidence. Among the uncertainties in RANS\nsimulations, the model-form uncertainty is an important or even a dominant\nsource. Therefore, quantifying and reducing the model-form uncertainties in\nRANS simulations are of critical importance to make risk-informed decisions.\nResearchers in statistics communities have made efforts on this issue by\nconsidering numerical models as black boxes. However, this physics-neutral\napproach is not a most efficient use of data, and is not practical for most\nengineering problems. Recently, we proposed an open-box, Bayesian framework for\nquantifying and reducing model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by\nincorporating observation data and physics-prior knowledge. It can incorporate\nthe information from the vast body of existing empirical knowledge with\nmathematical rigor, which enables a more efficient usage of data. In this work,\nwe examine the merits of incorporating various types of prior knowledge in the\nuncertainties quantification and reduction in RANS simulations. The result\ndemonstrates that informative physics-based prior plays an important role in\nimproving the quantification of model-form uncertainties, particularly when the\nobservation data are limited. Moreover, it suggests that the proposed Bayesian\nframework is an effective way to incorporate empirical knowledge from various\nsources.\n", "  It is usually assumed that in the linear regime the two-point correlation\nfunction of galaxies contains only a monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole.\nLooking at cross-correlations between different populations of galaxies, this\nturns out not to be the case. In particular, the cross-correlations between a\nbright and a faint population of galaxies contain also a dipole. In this paper\nwe present the first attempt to measure this dipole. We discuss the four types\nof effects that contribute to the dipole: relativistic distortions, evolution\neffect, wide-angle effect and large-angle effect. We show that the first three\ncontributions are intrinsic anti-symmetric contributions that do not depend on\nthe choice of angle used to measure the dipole. On the other hand the\nlarge-angle effect appears only if the angle chosen to extract the dipole\nbreaks the symmetry of the problem. We show that the relativistic distortions,\nthe evolution effect and the wide-angle effect are too small to be detected in\nthe LOWz and CMASS sample of the BOSS survey. On the other hand with a specific\ncombination of angles we are able to measure the large-angle effect with high\nsignificance. We emphasise that this large-angle dipole does not contain new\nphysical information, since it is just a geometrical combination of the\nmonopole and the quadrupole. However this measurement, which is in excellent\nagreement with theoretical predictions, validates our method for extracting the\ndipole from the two-point correlation function and it opens the way to the\ndetection of relativistic effects in future surveys like e.g. DESI.\n", "  According to Verlinde's recent proposal, the gravity is originally an\nentropic force. In this work, we obtain the corrections to the entropy-area law\nof black holes within rainbow gravity. The corrected entropy-area law leads to\nthe modifications of the number of bits $N$. Inspired by Verlinde's argument on\nthe entropic force, and using the modified number of bits, we can investigate\nthe effects of rainbow gravity on the modified Newtonian dynamics, Newton's law\nof gravitation, and Einstein's general relativity in entropic force approach.\n", "  We derive the leading quantum corrections to the gravitational potentials in\na de Sitter background, due to the vacuum polarization from loops of conformal\nfields. Our results are valid for arbitrary conformal theories, even strongly\ninteracting ones, and are expressed using the coefficients $b$ and $b'$\nappearing in the trace anomaly. Apart from the de Sitter generalization of the\nknown flat-space results, we find two additional contributions: one which\ndepends on the finite coefficients of terms quadratic in the curvature\nappearing in the renormalized effective action, and one which grows\nlogarithmically with physical distance. While the first contribution\ncorresponds to a rescaling of the effective mass, the second contribution leads\nto a slower fall-off of the Newton potential at large distances, and is\npotentially measurable.\n", "  The history of neutrino mixing and oscillations is briefly presented. Basics\nof neutrino mixing and oscillations and convenient formalism of neutrino\noscillations in vacuum is given. The role of neutrino in the Standard Model and\nthe Weinberg mechanism of the generation of the Majorana neutrino masses are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We construct an analytic phenomenological model for extended warm/hot gaseous\ncoronae of $L_*$ galaxies. We consider UV OVI COS-Halos absorption line data in\ncombination with Milky Way X-ray OVII and OVIII absorption and emission. We fit\nthese data with a single model representing the COS-Halos galaxies and a\nGalactic corona. Our model is multi-phased, with hot and warm gas components,\neach with a (turbulent) log-normal distribution of temperatures and densities.\nThe hot gas, traced by the X-ray absorption and emission, is in hydrostatic\nequilibrium in a Milky Way gravitational potential. The median temperature of\nthe hot gas is $1.5 \\times 10^6$~K and the mean hydrogen density is $\\sim 5\n\\times 10^{-5}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$. The warm component as traced by the OVI, is gas\nthat has cooled out of the high density tail of the hot component. The total\nwarm/hot gas mass is high and is $1.2 \\times 10^{11}~{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. The gas\nmetallicity we require to reproduce the oxygen ion column densities is $0.5$\nsolar. The warm OVI component has a short cooling time ($\\sim 2 \\times 10^8$\nyears), as hinted by observations. The hot component, however, is $\\sim 80\\%$\nof the total gas mass and is relatively long-lived, with $t_{cool} \\sim 7\n\\times 10^{9}$ years. Our model supports suggestions that hot galactic coronae\ncan contain significant amounts of gas. These reservoirs may enable galaxies to\ncontinue forming stars steadily for long periods of time and account for\n\"missing baryons\" in galaxies in the local universe.\n", "  We present a new approach for quantifying the abundance of galaxy clusters\nand constraining cosmological parameters using dynamical measurements. In the\nstandard method, galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, $v$, or velocity\ndispersions are used to infer cluster masses, $M$, in order to quantify the\nhalo mass function (HMF), $dn(M)/d\\log(M)$, which is strongly affected by mass\nmeasurement errors. In our new method, the probability distribution of\nvelocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic\ncalled the velocity distribution function (VDF), $dn(v)/dv$. The VDF can be\nmeasured more directly and precisely than the HMF and it can also be robustly\npredicted with cosmological simulations which capture the dynamics of subhalos\nor galaxies. We apply these two methods to mock cluster catalogs and forecast\nthe bias and constraints on the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$ and the\namplitude of matter fluctuations $\\sigma_8$ in flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.\nFor an example observation of 200 massive clusters, the VDF with (without)\nvelocity errors constrains the parameter combination $\\sigma_8\\Omega_m^{0.29\\\n(0.29)} = 0.587 \\pm 0.011\\ (0.583 \\pm 0.011)$ and shows only minor bias.\nHowever, the HMF with dynamical mass errors is biased to low $\\Omega_m$ and\nhigh $\\sigma_8$ and the fiducial model lies well outside of the forecast\nconstraints, prior to accounting for Eddington bias. When the VDF is combined\nwith constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the degeneracy\nbetween cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced. Upcoming\nspectroscopic surveys that probe larger volumes and fainter magnitudes will\nprovide a larger number of clusters for applying the VDF as a cosmological\nprobe.\n", "  New blends of simply synthesized quasi two-dimensional (quasi-2D) hydrophobic\nperovskite semiconductors, employed in high performance light emitting diodes\n(LEDs) which function due to excitonic energy transfer effects, are reported.\nThese materials are self-assembled blends of 2D, quasi-2D and three-dimensional\n(3D) hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors (HOIS). Moreover, shown for the\nfirst time, crude mixing of 3D perovskite and unprotonated amines provides\nsimilar semiconductors. HOIS reported here are based on the organic cations\nCH3NH3+, CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)8NH3+ or C6H5CH2CH2NH3+ and inorganic networks\nformed out of PbX42- anions (X=I, Br, Cl). HOIS exhibit strong bound excitonic\nstates with increased oscillator strength at room temperature, tunable via\nsimple halide substitution. HOIS blends manifest energy transfer effects, where\nadjacent nanoparticles of different band gap energies (Eg) transfer optical\nenergy to those with the lowest Eg; the suggested light emission mechanism\nhere. LED fabrication is attained via a single deposition of the hydrophobic\nmixture, reducing device complexity, cost and degradability. LED's diodic\nbehavior is observed even under light albeit its photovoltaic and\nphotoconductive quasi-2D and 3D components. LED devices exposed for over than\nfour months under adverse laboratory conditions, showed stable light emission.\nFurther research on this class of quasi-2D/3D HOIS mixtures is expected to lead\nto novel quantum electronic devices.\n", "  The EDGES High-Band experiment aims to detect the sky-average brightness\ntemperature of the $21$-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in the\nredshift range $14.8 \\gtrsim z \\gtrsim 6.5$. To probe this redshifted signal,\nEDGES High-Band conducts single-antenna measurements in the frequency range\n$90-190$ MHz from the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western\nAustralia. In this paper, we describe the current strategy for calibration of\nthe EDGES High-Band receiver and report calibration results for the instrument\nused in the $2015-2016$ observational campaign. We propagate uncertainties in\nthe receiver calibration measurements to the antenna temperature using a Monte\nCarlo approach. We define a performance objective of $1$~mK residual RMS after\nmodeling foreground subtraction from a fiducial temperature spectrum using a\nfive-term polynomial. Most of the calibration uncertainties yield residuals of\n$1$~mK or less at $95\\%$ confidence. However, current uncertainties in the\nantenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to\n$20$ mK even in low-foreground sky regions. These dominant residuals could be\nreduced by 1) improving the accuracy in reflection measurements, especially\ntheir phase 2) improving the impedance match at the antenna-receiver interface,\nand 3) decreasing the changes with frequency of the antenna reflection phase.\n", "  We show how the large-scale cosmological dynamics can be obtained from the\nhydrodynamics of isotropic group field theory condensate states in the\nGross-Pitaevskii approximation. The correct Friedmann equations are recovered\nin the semi-classical limit for some choices of the parameters in the action\nfor the group field theory, and quantum gravity corrections arise in the\nhigh-curvature regime causing a bounce which generically resolves the big-bang\nand big-crunch singularities.\n", "  The evolution of the large-scale distribution of matter is sensitive to a\nvariety of fundamental parameters that characterise the dark matter, dark\nenergy, and other aspects of our cosmological framework. Since the majority of\nthe mass density is in the form of dark matter that cannot be directly\nobserved, to do cosmology with large-scale structure one must use observable\n(baryonic) quantities that trace the underlying matter distribution in a\n(hopefully) predictable way. However, recent numerical studies have\ndemonstrated that the mapping between observable and total mass, as well as the\ntotal mass itself, are sensitive to unresolved feedback processes associated\nwith galaxy formation, motivating explicit calibration of the feedback\nefficiencies. Here we construct a new suite of large-volume cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations (called BAHAMAS, for BAryons and HAloes of MAssive\nSystems) where subgrid models of stellar and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)\nfeedback have been calibrated to reproduce the present-day galaxy stellar mass\nfunction and the hot gas mass fractions of groups and clusters in order to\nensure the effects of feedback on the overall matter distribution are broadly\ncorrect. We show that the calibrated simulations reproduce an unprecedentedly\nwide range of properties of massive systems, including the various observed\nmappings between galaxies, hot gas, total mass, and black holes, and represent\na significant advance in our ability to mitigate the primary systematic\nuncertainty in most present large-scale structure tests.\n", "  The conducting gas that forms at the interface between LaAlO$_3$ and\nSrTiO$_3$ has proven to be a fertile playground for a wide variety of physical\nphenomena. The bulk of previous research has focused on the (001) and (110)\ncrystal orientations. Here we report detailed measurements of the\nlow-temperature electrical properties of (111) LAO/STO interface samples. We\nfind that the low-temperature electrical transport properties are highly\nanisotropic, in that they differ significantly along two mutually orthogonal\ncrystal orientations at the interface. While anisotropy in the resistivity has\nbeen reported in some (001) samples and in (110) samples, the anisotropy in the\n(111) samples reported here is much stronger, and also manifests itself in the\nHall coefficient as well as the capacitance. In addition, the anisotropy is not\npresent at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperatures, but only at\nliquid helium temperatures and below. The anisotropy is accentuated by exposure\nto ultraviolet light, which disproportionately affects transport along one\nsurface crystal direction. Furthermore, analysis of the low-temperature Hall\ncoefficient and the capacitance as a function of back gate voltage indicates\nthat in addition to electrons, holes contribute to the electrical transport.\n", "  Numerical models based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations\nare widely used in engineering turbulence modeling. However, the RANS\npredictions have large model-form uncertainties for many complex flows.\nQuantification of these large uncertainties originating from the modeled\nReynolds stresses has attracted attention in turbulence modeling community.\nRecently, a physics-based Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form\nuncertainties has been proposed with successful applications to several flows.\nNonetheless, how to specify proper priors without introducing unwarranted,\nartificial information remains challenging to the current form of the\nphysics-based approach. Another recently proposed method based on random matrix\ntheory provides the prior distributions with the maximum entropy, which is an\nalternative for model-form uncertainty quantification in RANS simulations. In\nthis work, we utilize the random matrix theoretic approach to assess and\npossibly improve the specification of priors used in the physics-based\napproach. The numerical results show that, to achieve maximum entropy in the\nprior of Reynolds stresses, the perturbations of shape parameters in\nBarycentric coordinates are normally distributed. Moreover, the perturbations\nof the turbulence kinetic energy should conform to log-normal distributions.\nFinally, it sheds light on how large the variance of each physical variable\nshould be compared with each other to achieve the approximate maximum entropy\nprior. The conclusion can be used as a guidance for specifying proper priors in\nthe physics-based, Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework.\n", "  The growth of computational resources in the past decades has expanded the\napplication of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) from the traditional fields\nof aerodynamics and hydrodynamics to a number of new areas. Examples range from\nthe heat and fluid flows in nuclear reactor vessels and in data centers to the\nturbulence flows through wind turbine farms and coastal vegetation plants.\nHowever, in these new applications complex structures are often exist (e.g.,\nrod bundles in reactor vessels and turbines in wind farms), which makes fully\nresolved, first-principle based CFD modeling prohibitively expensive. This\nobstacle seriously impairs the predictive capability of CFD models in these\napplications. On the other hand, a limited amount of measurement data is often\navailable in the systems in the above-mentioned applications. In this work we\npropose a data-driven, physics-based approach to perform full field inversion\non the effects of the complex structures on the flow. This is achieved by\nassimilating observation data and numerical model prediction in an iterative\nEnsemble Kalman method. Based on the inversion results, the velocity and\nturbulence of the flow field can be obtained. A major novelty of the present\ncontribution is the non-parametric, full field inversion approach adopted,\nwhich is in contrast to the inference of coefficient in the ad hoc models often\npracticed in previous works. The merits of the proposed approach are\ndemonstrated on the flow past a porous disk by using both synthetic data and\nreal experimental measurements. The spatially varying drag forces of the porous\ndisk on the flow are inferred. The proposed approach has the potential to be\nused in the monitoring of complex system in the above mentioned applications.\n", "  The coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) plays a crucial role\nat the final evolution of stars. The detection of it would be of importance in\nastroparticle physics. Among all available neutrino sources, galactic\nsupernovae give the highest neutrino flux in the MeV range. Among all liquid\nxenon dark matter experiments, XMASS has the largest sensitive volume and light\nyield. The possibility to detect galactic supernova via the CEvNS-process on\nxenon nuclei in the current XMASS detector was investigated. The total number\nof events integrated in about 18 seconds after the explosion of a supernova\n10~kpc away from the Earth was expected to be from 3.5 to 21.1, depending on\nthe supernova model used to predict the neutrino flux, while the number of\nbackground events in the same time window was measured to be negligible. All\nlead to very high possibility to detect CEvNS experimentally for the first time\nutilizing the combination of galactic supernovae and the XMASS detector. In\ncase of a supernova explosion as close as Betelgeuse, the total observable\nevents can be more than ten thousand, making it possible to distinguish\ndifferent supernova models by examining the evolution of neutrino event rate in\nXMASS.\n", "  The Barcelona-Catania-Paris-Madrid (BCPM) functional recently proposed to\ndescribe nuclear structure properties of finite nuclei is generalized as to\ninclude a realistic effective mass. The resulting functional is as good as the\nprevious one in describing binding energies, radii, deformation properties, etc\nand, in addition, the description of Giant Quadrupole Resonance energies is\ngreatly improved.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the capacitance of a double quantum dot\nin the charge and spin qubit configurations probed at high-frequencies. We find\nthat in general the total capacitance of the system consists of two\nstate-dependent terms: The quantum capacitance arising from adiabatic charge\nmotion and the tunnelling capacitance that appears when repopulation occurs at\na rate comparable or faster than the probing frequency. The analysis of the\ncapacitance lineshape as a function of externally controllable variables offers\na way to characterize the qubits' charge and spin state as well as relevant\nsystem parameters such as charge and spin relaxation times, tunnel coupling,\nelectron temperature and electron g-factor. Overall, our analysis provides a\nformalism to understand dispersive qubit-resonator interactions which can be\napplied to high-sensitivity and non-invasive quantum-state readout.\n", "  We propose related schemes to generate arbitrarily shaped single photons,\ni.e. photons with an arbitrary temporal profile, and coherent state\nsuperpositions using simple optical elements. The first system consists of two\ncoupled cavities, a memory cavity and a shutter cavity, containing a second\norder optical nonlinearity and electro-optic modulator (EOM) respectively.\nPhotodetection events of the shutter cavity output herald preparation of a\nsingle photon in the memory cavity, which may be stored by immediately changing\nthe optical length of the shutter cavity with the EOM after detection.\nOn-demand readout of the photon, with arbitrary shaping, can be achieved\nthrough modulation of the EOM. The second scheme consists of a memory cavity\nwith two outputs which are interfered, phase shifted, and measured. States that\nclosely approximate a coherent state superposition can be produced through\npostselection for sequences of detection events, with more photon detection\nevents leading to a larger superposition. We furthermore demonstrate that\n`No-Knowledge Feedback' can be easily implemented in this system and used to\npreserve the superposition state, as well as provide an extra control mechanism\nfor state generation.\n", "  We show that the operational definition of non-classicality of a quantum\nstate depends on the motion of the observer. We use the relativistic\nUnruh-DeWitt detector model to witness nonclassicality of the probed field\nstate. It turns out that the witness based on the properties of the\nP-representation of the quantum state depends on the trajectory of the\ndetector. Inertial and noninertial motion of the device have qualitatively\ndifferent impact on the performance of the witness.\n", "  We present the ALMA Band 3 and Band 6 results of 12CO(2-1), 13$CO(2-1),\nH30alpha recombination line, free-free emission around 98 GHz, and the dust\nthermal emission around 230 GHz toward the N159 East Giant Molecular Cloud\n(N159E) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). LMC is the nearest active\nhigh-mass star forming face-on galaxy at a distance of 50 kpc and is the best\ntarget for studing high-mass star formation. ALMA observations show that N159E\nis the complex of filamentary clouds with the width and length of ~1 pc and 5\npc - 10 pc, respectively. The total molecular mass is 0.92 x 10^5 Msun from the\n13CO(2-1) intensity. N159E harbors the well-known Papillon Nebula, a compact\nhigh-excitation HII region. We found that a YSO associated with the Papillon\nNebula has the mass of 35 Msun and is located at the intersection of three\nfilamentary clouds. It indicates that the formation of the high-mass YSO was\ninduced by the collision of filamentary clouds. Fukui et al. 2015 reported a\nsimilar kinematic structure toward a YSO in the N159 West region which is\nanother YSO that has the mass larger than 35 Msun in these two regions. This\nsuggests that the collision of filamentary clouds is a primary mechanism of\nhigh-mass star formation. We found a small molecular hole around the YSO in\nPapillon Nebula with sub-pc scale. It is filled by free-free and H30alpha\nemission. Temperature of the molecular gas around the hole reaches ~ 80 K. It\nindicates that this YSO has just started the distruction of parental molecular\ncloud.\n", "  Stochastic effects in generic scenarios of inflation with multiple fields are\ninvestigated. First passage time techniques are employed to calculate the\nstatistical moments of the number of inflationary $e$-folds, which give rise to\nall correlation functions of primordial curvature perturbations through the\nstochastic $\\delta N$ formalism. The number of fields is a critical parameter.\nThe probability of exploring arbitrarily large-field regions of the potential\nbecomes non-vanishing when more than two fields are driving inflation. The mean\nnumber of $e$-folds can be infinite, depending on the number of fields; for\nplateau potentials, this occurs even with one field. In such cases, correlation\nfunctions of curvature perturbations are infinite. They can, however, be\nregularised if a reflecting (or absorbing) wall is added at large energy or\nfield value. The results are found to be independent of the exact location of\nthe wall and this procedure is, therefore, well-defined for a wide range of\ncutoffs, above or below the Planck scale. Finally, we show that, contrary to\nsingle-field setups, multi-field models can yield large stochastic corrections\neven at sub-Planckian energy, opening interesting prospects for probing quantum\neffects on cosmological fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate the physical conditions of ionized gas in high-z star-forming\ngalaxies using diagnostic diagrams based on the rest-frame optical emission\nlines. The sample consists of 701 galaxies with an Ha detection at $1.4\\lesssim\nz\\lesssim1.7$, from the FMOS-COSMOS survey, that represent the normal\nstar-forming population over the stellar mass range $10^{9.6} \\lesssim\nM_\\ast/M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{11.6}$ with those at $M_\\ast>10^{11}~M_\\odot$ being\nwell sampled. We confirm an offset of the average location of star-forming\ngalaxies in the BPT diagram ([OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha), primarily towards higher\n[OIII]/Hb, compared with local galaxies. Based on the [SII] ratio, we measure\nan electron density ($n_e=220^{+170}_{-130}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), that is higher\nthan that of local galaxies. Based on comparisons to theoretical models, we\nargue that changes in emission-line ratios, including the offset in the BPT\ndiagram, are caused by a higher ionization parameter both at fixed stellar mass\nand at fixed metallicity with additional contributions from a higher gas\ndensity and possibly a hardening of the ionizing radiation field. Ionization\ndue to AGNs is ruled out as assessed with Chandra. As a consequence, we revisit\nthe mass-metallicity relation using [NII]/Ha and a new calibration including\n[NII]/[SII] as recently introduced by Dopita et al. Consistent with our\nprevious results, the most massive galaxies ($M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\\odot$)\nare fully enriched, while those at lower masses have metallicities lower than\nlocal galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that the stellar masses, metallicities\nand star formation rates of the FMOS sample are well fit with a\nphysically-motivated model for the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies.\n", "  We show that in presence of a deformable lattice potential, the nature of the\ndisorder-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) is fundamentally changed with\nrespect to the non-interacting (Anderson) scenario. For strong disorder, even a\nmodest electron-phonon interaction is found to dramatically renormalize the\nrandom potential, opening a mobility gap at the Fermi energy. This process,\nwhich reflects disorder-enhanced polaron formation, is here given a microscopic\nbasis by treating the lattice deformations and Anderson localization effects on\nthe same footing. We identify an intermediate \"bad insulator\" transport regime\nwhich displays resistivity values exceeding the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and with\na negative temperature coefficient, as often observed in strongly disordered\nmetals. Our calculations reveal that this behavior originates from significant\ntemperature-induced rearrangements of electronic states due to enhanced\ninteraction effects close to the disorder-driven MIT.\n", "  We study the spectral fluctuations of the $^{208}$Pb nucleus using the\ncomplete experimental spectrum of 151 states up to excitation energies of\n$6.20$ MeV recently identified at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium at Garching,\nGermany. For natural parity states the results are very close to the\npredictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for the nearest-neighbor spacing\ndistribution. A quantitative estimate of the agreement is given by the Brody\nparameter $\\omega$, which takes the value $\\omega=0$ for regular systems and\n$\\omega \\simeq 1$ for chaotic systems. We obtain $\\omega=0.85 \\pm 0.02$ which\nis, to our knowledge, the closest value to chaos ever observed in experimental\nbound states of nuclei. By contrast, the results for unnatural parity states\nare far from RMT behavior. We interpret these results as a consequence of the\nstrength of the residual interaction in $^{208}$Pb, which, according to\nexperimental data, is much stronger for natural than for unnatural parity\nstates. In addition our results show that chaotic and non-chaotic nuclear\nstates coexist in the same energy region of the spectrum.\n", "  A recent study by Bojowald and Paily provided a path toward the\nidentification of an effective quantum-spacetime picture of Loop Quantum\nGravity, applicable in the \"Minkowski regime\", the regime where the large-scale\n(coarse-grained) spacetime metric is flat. A pivotal role in the analysis is\nplayed by Loop-Quantum-Gravity-based modifications to the hypersurface\ndeformation algebra, which leave a trace in the Minkowski regime. We here show\nthat the symmetry-algebra results reported by Bojowald and Paily are consistent\nwith a description of spacetime in the Minkowski regime given in terms of the\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime, whose relevance for the study of\nthe quantum-gravity problem had already been proposed for independent reasons.\n", "  We present the Open Supernova Catalog, an online collection of observations\nand metadata for presently 36,000+ supernovae and related candidates. The\ncatalog is freely available on the web (https://sne.space), with its main\ninterface having been designed to be a user-friendly, rapidly-searchable table\naccessible on desktop and mobile devices. In addition to the primary catalog\ntable containing supernova metadata, an individual page is generated for each\nsupernova which displays its available metadata, light curves, and spectra\nspanning X-ray to radio frequencies. The data presented in the catalog is\nautomatically rebuilt on a daily basis and is constructed by parsing several\ndozen sources, including the data presented in the supernova literature and\nfrom secondary sources such as other web-based catalogs. Individual supernova\ndata is stored in the hierarchical, human- and machine-readable JSON format,\nwith the entirety of each supernova's data being contained within a single JSON\nfile bearing its name. The setup we present here, which is based upon open\nsource software maintained via git repositories hosted on github, enables\nanyone to download the entirety of the supernova dataset to their home computer\nin minutes, and to make contributions of their own data back to the catalog via\ngit. As the supernova dataset continues to grow, especially in the upcoming era\nof all-sky synoptic telescopes which will increase the total number of events\nby orders of magnitude, we hope that the catalog we have designed will be a\nvaluable tool for the community to analyze both historical and contemporary\nsupernovae.\n", "  Light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) such as, e.g.~axion-like\nparticles, that are non-thermally produced via the misalignment mechanism are\npromising dark matter candidates. An important feature of pNGBs is their\nperiodic potential, whose scale of periodicity controls all their couplings. As\na consequence of the periodicity the maximal potential energy is limited and,\nhence, producing the observed dark matter density poses significant constraints\non the allowed masses and couplings. In the presence of a monodromy, the field\nrange as well as the range of the potential can be significantly extended. As\nwe argue in this paper this has important phenomenological consequences. The\nconstraints on the masses and couplings are ameliorated and couplings to\nStandard Model particles could be significantly stronger, thereby opening up\nconsiderable experimental opportunities. Yet, monodromy models can also give\nrise to new and qualitatively different features. As a remnant of the\nperiodicity the potential can feature pronounced wiggles. When the field is\npassing through them quantum fluctuations are enhanced and particles with\nnon-vanishing momentum are produced. Here, we perform a first analysis of this\neffect and delineate under which circumstances this becomes important. We\ndiscuss possible cosmological consequences.\n", "  We consider multipeakon solutions, and to some extent also multishockpeakon\nsolutions, of a coupled two-component integrable PDE found by Geng and Xue as a\ngeneralization of Novikov's cubically nonlinear Camassa-Holm type equation. In\norder to make sense of such solutions, we find it necessary to assume that\nthere are no overlaps, meaning that a peakon or shockpeakon in one component is\nnot allowed to occupy the same position as a peakon or shockpeakon in the other\ncomponent. Therefore one can distinguish many inequivalent configurations,\ndepending on the order in which the peakons or shockpeakons in the two\ncomponents appear relative to each other. Here we are in particular interested\nin the case of interlacing peakon solutions, where the peakons alternatingly\noccur in one component and in the other. Based on explicit expressions for\nthese solutions in terms of elementary functions, we describe the general\nfeatures of the dynamics, and in particular the asymptotic large-time\nbehaviour. As far as the positions are concerned, interlacing Geng-Xue peakons\ndisplay the usual scattering phenomenon where the peakons asymptotically travel\nwith constant velocities, which are all distinct, except that the two fastest\npeakons will have the same velocity. However, in contrast to many other peakon\nequations, the amplitudes of the peakons will not in general tend to constant\nvalues; instead they grow or decay exponentially. Thus the logarithms of the\namplitudes (as functions of time) will asymptotically behave like straight\nlines, and comparing these lines for large positive and negative times, one\nobserves phase shifts similar to those seen for the positions of the peakons.\nIn addition to these K+K interlacing pure peakon solutions, we also investigate\n1+1 shockpeakon solutions, and collisions leading to shock formation in a 2+2\npeakon-antipeakon solution.\n", "  Generating \"locally\" the local oscillator is a fundamental requirement for\ncontinous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), both for performance and\nsecurity reasons. As a consequence, next-generation CV- QKD systems will have\nto be implemented with a local local oscillator (LLO). This issue has been\nexplicitly tackled in recent works, where the proposed and implemented\napproach, that we call LLO-sequential, consists in sequentially (temporally)\nmultiplexing quantum signal optical pulses with phase reference pilot tones\noptical pulses. We develop a comprehensive analysis of the noise model and the\nhardware requirements in order to perform LLO CV-QKD. This analysis allows to\nquantitatively understand one of the limits of CV-QKD implemented with the\nLLO-sequential approach: such systems, unless operated at very high speed, have\nvery strong requirements in terms of tolerable laser phase noise.\nLLO-sequential CV-QKD can thus in practice only be implemented with expensive,\nlow phase noise lasers, such as ECL lasers. The main contribution of this work\nis to introduce designs for LLO CV-QKD based on self-coherence phase sharing,\nin which the phase reference information and the quantum information are\ncoherently obtained from a single optical wavefront. We propose in particular a\ndesign, called LLO-displacement, where the phase reference information is\nencoded in the displacement of the standard CV-QKD Gaussian modulated coherent\nstate (GMCS) protocol. We analyze the performance and the hardware requirements\nof the LLO-displacement design and our results indicate that it can be used to\nperform CV-QKD over distances up to 100 km with realistic and affordable\nhardware, in particular with standard telecom equipment and low cost DFB\nlasers. This opens a practical path towards the development of coherent quantum\ncommunications systems compatible with next-generation networks requirements.\n", "  Motivated by hints of the effective emergent nature of spacetime structure,\nwe formulate a spacetime-free algebraic framework for quantum theory, in which\nno a priori background geometric structure is required. Such a framework is\nnecessary in order to study the emergence of effective spacetime structure in a\nconsistent manner, without assuming a background geometry from the outset.\nInstead, the background geometry is conjectured to arise as an effective\nstructure of the algebraic and dynamical relations between observables that are\nimposed by the background statistics of the system. Namely, we suggest that\nquantum reference states on an extended observable algebra, the free algebra\ngenerated by the observables, may give rise to effective spacetime structures.\nAccordingly, perturbations of the reference state lead to perturbations of the\ninduced effective spacetime geometry. We initiate the study of these\nperturbations, and their relation to gravitational phenomena.\n", "  We investigate phenomenological interactions between dark matter and dark\nenergy and constrain these models by employing the most recent cosmological\ndata including the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies from\nPlanck 2015, Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble\nconstant and redshift-space distortions. We find that the interaction in the\ndark sector parameterized as an energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy\nis strongly suppressed by the whole updated cosmological data. On the other\nhand, an interaction between dark sectors with the energy flow from dark energy\nto dark matter is proved in better agreement with the available cosmological\nobservations. This coupling between dark sectors is needed to alleviate the\ncoincidence problem.\n", "  Present global fits of world neutrino data hint towards non-maximal\n$\\theta_{23}$ with two nearly degenerate solutions, one in the lower octant\n($\\theta_{23} <\\pi/4$), and the other in the higher octant ($\\theta_{23}\n>\\pi/4$). This octant ambiguity of $\\theta_{23}$ is one of the fundamental\nissues in the neutrino sector, and its resolution is a crucial goal of\nnext-generation long-baseline (LBL) experiments. In this letter, we address for\nthe first time, the impact of a light eV-scale sterile neutrino towards such a\nmeasurement, taking the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as a case\nstudy. In the so-called 3+1 scheme involving three active and one sterile\nneutrino, the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ transition probability probed in the LBL\nexperiments acquires a new interference term via active-sterile oscillations.\nWe find that this novel interference term can mimic a swap of the $\\theta_{23}$\noctant, even if one uses the information from both neutrino and antineutrino\nchannels. As a consequence, the sensitivity to the octant of $\\theta_{23}$ can\nbe completely lost and this may have serious implications in our understanding\nof neutrinos from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives.\n", "  We have used the AMR hydrodynamic code, MG, to perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations with self-gravity of stellar feedback in a sheet-like molecular\ncloud formed through the action of the thermal instability. We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a 15 solar mass star and a 40\nsolar mass star into a 100 pc-diameter 17000 solar mass cloud with a corrugated\nsheet morphology that in projection appears filamentary. The stellar winds are\nintroduced using appropriate Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 solar\nmass star case, the wind forms a narrow bipolar cavity with minimal effect on\nthe parent cloud. In the 40 solar mass star case, the more powerful stellar\nwind creates a large cylindrical cavity through the centre of the cloud. After\n12.5 Myrs and 4.97 Myrs respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae\n(SNe). In the 15 solar mass star case, the SN material and energy is primarily\ndeposited into the molecular cloud surroundings over ~10^5 years before the SN\nremnant escapes the cloud. In the 40 solar mass star case, a significant\nfraction of the SN material and energy rapidly escapes the molecular cloud\nalong the wind cavity in a few tens of kiloyears. Both SN events compress the\nmolecular cloud material around them to higher densities (so may trigger\nfurther star formation), and strengthen the magnetic field, typically by\nfactors of 2-3 but up to a factor of 10. Our simulations are relevant to\nobservations of bubbles in flattened ring-like molecular clouds and bipolar HII\nregions.\n", "  We analyze the problem of how different ground states associated to the same\nset of the Hamiltonian parameters evolve after a sudden quench. To realize our\nanalysis we define a quantitative approach to the local distinguishability\nbetween different ground states of a magnetically ordered phase in terms of the\ntrace distance between the reduced density matrices obtained projecting two\nground states in the same subset. Before the quench, regardless the particular\nchoice of the subset, any system in a magnetically ordered phase is\ncharacterized by ground states that are locally distinguishable. On the other\nhand, after the quench, the maximum of the distinguishability shows an\nexponential decay in time. Hence, in the limit of very large time, all the\ninformations about the particular initial ground state are lost even if the\nsystems are integrable. We prove our claims in the framework of the\nmagnetically ordered phases that characterize both the $XY$ model and\n$N$-cluster Ising models. The fact that we find similar behavior in models\nwithin different classes of symmetry makes us confident about the generality of\nour results.\n", "  We show that the recent results of \\ [Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 25 (2016) 1650051]\non the application of Lie/Noether symmetries in scalar field cosmology are\nwell-known in the literature while the problem could have been solved easily\nunder a coordinate transformation. That follows from the property, that the\nadmitted group of invariant transformations of dynamical system is independent\non the coordinate system.\n", "  In this article we discuss the modelling of elastic and electromagnetic wave\npropagation through one- and two-dimensional structured piezoelectric solids.\nDispersion and the effect of piezoelectricity on the group velocity and\npositions of stop bands are studied in detail. We will also analyze the\nreflection and transmission associated with the problem of scattering of an\nelastic wave by a heterogeneous piezoelectric stack. Special attention is given\nto the occurrence of transmission resonances in finite stacks and their\ndependence on a piezoelectric effect. A 2D doubly-periodic piezoelectric\ncheckerboard structure is subsequently introduced, for which the dispersion\nsurfaces for Bloch waves have been constructed and analysed, with the emphasis\non the dynamic anisotropy and special features of standing waves within the\npiezoelectric structure.\n", "  We study the overdensity of point sources in the direction of X-ray-selected\ngalaxy clusters from the Meta-Catalog of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies\n(MCXC; $\\langle z \\rangle = 0.14$) at South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Sydney\nUniversity Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) frequencies. Flux densities at 95, 150\nand 220 GHz are extracted from the 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey maps at the\nlocations of SUMSS sources, producing a multi-frequency catalog of radio\ngalaxies. In the direction of massive galaxy clusters, the radio galaxy flux\ndensities at 95 and 150 GHz are biased low by the cluster Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\nEffect (SZE) signal, which is negative at these frequencies. We employ a\ncluster SZE model to remove the expected flux bias and then study these\ncorrected source catalogs. We find that the high frequency radio galaxies are\ncentrally concentrated within the clusters and that their luminosity functions\n(LFs) exhibit amplitudes that are characteristically an order of magnitude\nlower than the cluster LF at 843 MHz. We use the 150 GHz LF to estimate the\nimpact of cluster radio galaxies on an SPT-SZ like survey. The radio galaxy\nflux typically produces a small bias on the SZE signal and has negligible\nimpact on the observed scatter in the SZE mass-observable relation. If we\nassume there is no redshift evolution in the radio galaxy LF then $1.8\\pm0.7$\npercent of the clusters would be lost from the sample. Allowing for redshift\nevolution of the form $(1+z)^{2.5}$ increases the incompleteness to $5.6\\pm1.0$\npercent. Improved constraints on the evolution of the cluster radio galaxy LF\nrequire a larger cluster sample extending to higher redshift.\n", "  Motivated by recent measurements of the lifetime (decay width) of paramagnons\nin quantum antiferromagnet TlCuCl3, we investigate paramagnon decay in a heat\nbath and formulate an appropriate quantum theory. Our formulation can be split\ninto two regimes: (i) a non-perturbative, 'hot quantum soup' regime where\nparamagnon width is comparable to its energy; (ii) usual perturbative regime\nwhere paramagnon width is significantly lower than its energy. Close to the\nNeel tempera- ture the paramagnon width becomes comparable to its energy and\nfalls into the hot quantum soup regime. To describe this regime we develop a\nnew finite frequency, finite temperature technique for a nonlinear quantum\nfield theory; the 'golden rule of quantum kinetics'. The formulation is generic\nand applicable to any three dimensional quantum antiferromagnet in the vicinity\nof a quantum critical point. Specifically we apply our results to TlCuCl3 and\nfind agreement with experimental data. Additionally, we show that logarithmic\nrunning of the coupling constant in the upper critical dimension changes the\ncommonly accepted picture of the quantum disordered and quantum critical\nregimes.\n", "  We present a weak-lensing and dynamical study of the complex cluster Abell\n1758 (A1758, z = 0.278) supported by hydrodynamical simulations. This cluster\nis composed of two main structures, called A1758N and A1758S. The Northern\nstructure is composed of A1758NW & A1758NE, with lensing determined masses of\n7.90_{-1.55}^{+1.89} X 10^{14} M_\\odot and 5.49_{-1.33}^{+1.67} X 10^{14}\nM_\\odot, respectively. They show a remarkable feature: while in A1758NW there\nis a spatial agreement among weak lensing mass distribution, intracluster\nmedium and its brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in A1758NE the X-ray peak is\nlocated 96_{-15}^{+14} arcsec away from the mass peak and BCG positions. Given\nthe detachment between gas and mass we could use the local surface mass density\nto estimate an upper limit for the dark matter self-interaction cross section:\n\\sigma/m<5.83 cm^2 g^{-1}. Combining our velocity data with hydrodynamical\nsimulations we have shown that A1758 NW \\& NE had their closest approach 0.27\nGyr ago and their merger axis is 21+-12 degrees from the plane of the sky. In\nthe A1758S system we have measured a total mass of 4.96_{-1.19}^{+1.08} X\n10^{14} M_\\odot and, using radial velocity data, we found that the main merger\naxis is located at 70+-4 degrees from the plane of the sky, therefore closest\nto the line-of-sight.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black\nhole and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-de Sitter (RNdS) black hole in the view of\nglobal and effective thermodynamic quantities. Making use of the effective\nfirst law of thermodynamics, we can derive the effective thermodynamic\nquantities of de Sitter black holes. It is found that these effective\nthermodynamic quantities also satisfy Smarr-like formula. Especially, the\neffective temperatures are nonzero in the Nariai limit, which is consistent\nwith the idea of Bousso and Hawking. By calculating heat capacity and Gibbs\nfree energy, we find SdS black hole is always thermodynamically stable and RNdS\nblack hole may undergoes phase transition at some points.\n", "  We study the gravitational shock wave generated by a massless high energy\nparticle in the context of higher order gravities of the form $F(R,R_{\\mu\n\\nu}R^{\\mu \\nu},R_{\\mu \\nu \\alpha \\beta}R^{\\mu \\nu \\alpha \\beta})$. In the case\nof $F(R)$ gravity, we investigate the gravitational shock wave solutions\ncorresponding to various cosmologically viable gravities, and as we demonstrate\nthe solutions are rescaled versions of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity solution.\nInterestingly enough, other higher order gravities result to the general\nrelativistic solution, except for some specific gravities of the form $F(R_{\\mu\n\\nu}R^{\\mu \\nu})$ and $F(R,R_{\\mu \\nu}R^{\\mu \\nu})$, which we study in detail.\nIn addition, when realistic Gauss-Bonnet gravities of the form\n$R+F(\\mathcal{G})$ are considered, the gravitational shock wave solutions are\nidentical to the general relativistic solution. Finally, the singularity\nstructure of the gravitational shock waves solutions is studied, and it is\nshown that the effect of higher order gravities makes the singularities milder\nin comparison to the general relativistic solutions, and in some particular\ncases the singularities seem to be absent.\n", "  We propose a new class of univariate nonstationary time series models, using\nthe framework of modulated time series, which is appropriate for the analysis\nof rapidly-evolving time series as well as time series observations with\nmissing data. We extend our techniques to a class of bivariate time series that\nare isotropic. Exact inference is often not computationally viable for time\nseries analysis, and so we propose an estimation method based on the\nWhittle-likelihood, a commonly adopted pseudo-likelihood. Our inference\nprocedure is shown to be consistent under standard assumptions, as well as\nhaving considerably lower computational cost than exact likelihood in general.\nWe show the utility of this framework for the analysis of drifting instruments,\nan analysis that is key to characterising global ocean circulation and\ntherefore also for decadal to century-scale climate understanding.\n", "  We search for the rare flavor-changing neutral current process\n$B^{+}\\rightarrow K^{+}\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ using data from the BABAR experiment.\nThe data sample, collected at the center-of-mass energy of the $\\Upsilon{(4S)}$\nresonance, corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 424 fb$^{-1}$ and to\n471 million $B\\overline{B}$ pairs. We reconstruct one $B$ meson, produced in\nthe $\\Upsilon{(4S)}\\rightarrow B^{+} B^{-}$ decay, in one of many hadronic\ndecay modes and search for activity compatible with a $B^{+}\\rightarrow K^{+}\n\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ decay in the rest of the event. Each $\\tau$ lepton is\nrequired to decay leptonically into an electron or muon and neutrinos.\nComparing the expected number of background events with the data sample after\napplying the selection criteria, we do not find evidence for a signal. The\nmeasured branching fraction is ($1.31^{+0.66}_{-0.61}$(\nstat.)$^{+0.35}_{-0.25}$( sys.)$) \\times 10^{-3}$ with an upper limit, at the\n90\\% confidence level, of $\\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\\rightarrow\nK^{+}\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-})$$< 2.25\\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  In this study, we demonstrate that general relativity predicts arrival time\ndifferences between gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals\ncaused by the wave effects in gravitational lensing. The GW signals can arrive\n$earlier$ than the EM signals in some cases if the GW/EM signals have passed\nthrough a lens, even if both signals were emitted simultaneously by a source.\nGW wavelengths are much larger than EM wavelengths; therefore, the propagation\nof the GWs does not follow the laws of geometrical optics, including the\nShapiro time delay, if the lens mass is less than approximately $10^5 {\\rm\nM}_\\odot (f/{\\rm Hz})^{-1}$, where $f$ is the GW frequency. The arrival time\ndifference can reach $\\sim 0.1 \\, {\\rm s} \\, (f/{\\rm Hz})^{-1}$ if the signals\nhave passed by a lens of mass $\\sim 8000{\\rm M}_\\odot (f/{\\rm Hz})^{-1}$ with\nthe impact parameter smaller than the Einstein radius; therefore, it is more\nprominent for lower GW frequencies. For example, when a distant super massive\nblack hole binary (SMBHB) in a galactic center is lensed by an intervening\ngalaxy, the time lag becomes of the order of $10$ days. Future pulsar timing\narrays including SKA (the Square Kilometre Array) and X-ray detectors may\ndetect several time lags by measuring the orbital phase differences between the\nGW/EM signals in the SMBHBs. Gravitational lensing imprints a characteristic\nmodulation on a chirp waveform; therefore, we can deduce whether a measured\narrival time lag arises from intrinsic source properties or gravitational\nlensing. Determination of arrival time differences would be extremely useful in\nmultimessenger observations and tests of general relativity.\n", "  The long-standing challenge of creating a Milky Way-like disk galaxy from\ncosmological simulations has motivated significant developments in both\nnumerical methods and physical models in recent years. We investigate these two\nfundamental aspects in a new comparison project using a set of cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-size\ngalaxy. In this study, we focus on the comparison of two particle-based\nhydrodynamics methods: the improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code\nGadget, and the Lagrangian Meshless Finite-Mass (MFM) code GIZMO. All the\nsimulations in this paper use the same initial conditions and physical models,\nwhich include physics of both dark matter and baryons, star formation,\n\"energy-driven\" outflow, metal-dependent cooling, stellar evolution and metal\nenrichment from supernovae. We find that both numerical schemes produce a\nlate-type galaxy with extended gaseous and stellar disks. However, notable\ndifferences are present in a wide range of galaxy properties and their\nevolution, including star formation history, gas content, disk structure and\nkinematics. In particular, there is significant difference in gas properties\nand their evolution between the two simulations. Compared to GIZMO, Gadget\nsimulation produces a larger fraction of cold, dense gas at high redshift which\nfuels rapid star formation and results in a higher stellar mass by $20\\%$ and a\nlower gas fraction by $10\\%$ at $z = 0$, and the resulting gas disk is smoother\nand more coherent in rotation due to damping of turbulent motion by the\nnumerical viscosity in SPH, in contrast to the GIZMO simulation which shows\nmore prominent spiral structure. Given its better convergence properties and\nlower computational cost, we argue that MFM method is a promising alternative\nto the widely used SPH in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.\n", "  Dust plays a key role in the evolution of the ISM and its correct modelling\nin numerical simulations is therefore fundamental. We present a new and\nself-consistent model that treats grain thermal coupling with the gas,\nradiation balance, and surface chemistry for molecular hydrogen. This method\ncan be applied to any dust distribution with an arbitrary number of grain types\nwithout affecting the overall computational cost. In this paper we describe in\ndetail the physics and the algorithm behind our approach, and in order to test\nthe methodology, we present some examples of astrophysical interest, namely (i)\na one-zone collapse with complete gas chemistry and thermochemical processes,\n(ii) a 3D model of a low-metallicity collapse of a minihalo starting from\ncosmological initial conditions, and (iii) a turbulent molecular cloud with\nH-C-O chemistry (277 reactions), together with self-consistent cooling and\nheating solved on the fly. Although these examples employ the publicly\navailable code KROME, our approach can be easily integrated into any\ncomputational framework.\n", "  A model cluster, with a resonant electron spin surrounded with identical\nnuclear spins occupying the sites of a cubic lattice, and with dipolar coupling\nbetween the spins, is used for a theoretical investigation of the transient\nnutations induced by a strong oscillating field but disturbed by these local\ndipolar fields. An effective Hamiltonian valid at the time scale of the\nnutations is first established. An analytical expression for the Dipolar\nCoherence time tDC is derived by adapting Van Vleck's perturbative approach to\nthe present situation, with weak rather than intermediate dipolar coupling. It\nis found that the dipolar coupling does not affect tDC at exact ESR resonance\n(Delta=0), a result reminiscent of a behaviour found in transient NMR in\nliquids, in an inhomogeneous static field. The expression for tDC also presents\na qualitative similarity with a time introduced in that liquid-state NMR\ncontext. Introducing a collection of independent clusters, a bridge is built\nbetween tDC and the half-width delta of the usual steady state unsaturated ESR\nline. Assuming a simple cubic lattice, numerical values for (tDC)Delta=delta\nare given, for both undiluted and dilute samples. It is shown that the TN do\nnot obey the Bloch equations. Precautions to be taken when trying a qualitative\ncomparison between the present results and existing experimental data, and some\nthermodynamic aspects, are discussed.\n", "  The constant mean extrinsic curvature on a spacelike slice may constitute a\nphysically preferred time coordinate, `York time'. One line of enquiry to probe\nthis idea is to understand processes in our cosmological history in terms of\nYork time. Following a review of the theoretical motivations, we focus on\nslow-roll inflation and the freezing and Hubble re-entry of cosmological\nperturbations. We show how the mathematical account of these processes is\ndistinct from the conventional account in terms of standard cosmological or\nconformal time. We also consider the cosmological York-timeline more broadly\nand contrast it with the conventional cosmological timeline.\n", "  We present a study on the coherent rotation of the intracluster medium and\ndark matter components of simulated galaxy clusters extracted from a\nvolume-limited sample of the MUSIC project. The set is re-simulated with three\ndifferent recipes for the gas physics: $(i)$ non-radiative, $(ii)$ radiative\nwithout AGN feedback, and $(iii)$ radiative with AGN feedback. Our analysis is\nbased on the 146 most massive clusters identified as relaxed, 57 per cent of\nthe total sample. We classify these objects as rotating and non-rotating\naccording to the gas spin parameter, a quantity that can be related to cluster\nobservations. We find that 4 per cent of the relaxed sample is rotating\naccording to our criterion. By looking at the radial profiles of their specific\nangular momentum vector, we find that the solid body model is not a suitable\ndescription of rotational motions. The radial profiles of the velocity of the\ndark matter show a prevalence of the random velocity dispersion. Instead, the\nintracluster medium profiles are characterized by a comparable contribution\nfrom the tangential velocity and the dispersion. In general, the dark matter\ncomponent dominates the dynamics of the clusters, as suggested by the\ncorrelation between its angular momentum and the gas one, and by the lack of\nrelevant differences among the three sets of simulations.\n", "  Recent surveys of marine plastic debris density have revealed high levels in\nthe center of the subtropical gyres. Earlier studies have argued that the\nformation of great garbage patches is due to Ekman convergence in such regions.\nIn this work we report a tendency so far overlooked of drogued and undrogued\ndrifters to accumulate distinctly over the subtropical gyres, with undrogued\ndrifters accumulating in the same areas where plastic debris accumulate. We\nshow that the observed accumulation is too fast for Ekman convergence to\nexplain it. We demonstrate that the accumulation is controlled by finite-size\nand buoyancy (i.e., inertial) effects on undrogued drifter motion subjected to\nocean current and wind drags. We infer that the motion of flotsam in general is\nconstrained by similar effects. This is done by using a newly proposed\nMaxey--Riley equation which models the submerged (surfaced) drifter portion as\na sphere of the fractional volume that is submerged (surfaced).\n", "  We present a new and efficient algorithm for finding point sources in the\nphoton event data stream from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, FermiFAST.\nThe key advantage of FermiFAST is that it constructs a catalogue of potential\nsources very fast by arranging the photon data in a hierarchical data\nstructure. Using this structure FermiFAST rapidly finds the photons that could\nhave originated from a potential gamma-ray source. It calculates a likehihood\nratio for the contribution of the potential source using the angular\ndistribution of the photons within the region of interest. It can find within a\nfew minutes the most significant half of the Fermi Third Point Source catalogue\n(3FGL) with nearly 80\\% purity from the four years of data used to construct\nthe catalogue. If a higher purity sample is desirable, one can achieve a sample\nthat includes the most significant third of the Fermi 3FGL with only five\npercent of the sources unassociated with Fermi sources. Outside the galaxy\nplane, all but eight of the 580 FermiFAST detections are associated with 3FGL\nsources. And of these eight, six yield significant detections of greater than\nfive sigma when a further binned likelihood analysis is performed. This\nsoftware allows for rapid exploration of the Fermi data, simulation of the\nsource detection to calculate the selection function of various sources and the\nerrors in the obtained parameters of the sources detected.\n", "  Neutrinos with energies in the PeV to EeV range produce upgoing extensive air\nshowers when they interact underground close enough to the surface of the\nEarth. We study the possibility for detection of such showers with a system of\nvery wide field-of-view imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, named CHANT\nfor CHerenkov from Astrophysical Neutrinos Telescope, pointing down to a strip\nbelow the Earth's horizon from space. We find that CHANT provides sufficient\nsensitivity for the study of the astrophysical neutrino flux in a wide energy\nrange, from 10 PeV to 10 EeV. A space-based CHANT system can discover and study\nin detail the cosmogenic neutrino flux originating from interactions of\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the intergalactic medium.\n", "  We investigate the implications of a minimal $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry extension\nof the standard model at the LHC. To achieve the spontaneous symmetry breaking,\na heavy Higgs doublet of the $SU(2)$ is introduced. To obtain an anomaly free\nmodel and the decays of new charged gauge bosons, we include a vector-like\nquark doublet. We also employ a real scalar boson to dictate the heavy Higgs\nproduction via the gluon-gluon fusion processes. It is found that the new gauge\ncoupling and the masses of new gauge bosons can be strictly bounded by the\nelectroweak $\\rho$-parameter and dilepton resonance experiments at the LHC. It\nis found that due to the new charged gauge boson enhancement, the cross\nsections for a heavy scalar boson to diphoton channel measured by ATLAS and CMS\ncan be easily satisfied when the values of Yukawa couplings are properly taken.\nFurthermore, by adopting event simulation, we find that the significance of\n$pp\\to (\\gamma \\gamma)_H+{\\rm jet}$, where the diphoton is from the heavy Higgs\ndecay, can be over $4\\sigma$ when the luminosity is above 60 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  Radio-loud neutron stars known as pulsars allow a wide range of experimental\ntests for fundamental physics, ranging from the study of super-dense matter to\ntests of general relativity and its alternatives. As a result, pulsars provide\nstrong-field tests of gravity, they allow for the direct detection of\ngravitational waves in a 'pulsar timing array', and they promise the future\nstudy of black hole properties. This contribution gives an overview of the\non-going experiments and recent results.\n", "  We consider space-time correlations in driven diffusive systems which undergo\na fluctuation into a regime with an atypically large current or dynamical\nactivity. For a single conserved mass we show that the spatio-temporal density\ncorrelations in one space dimension are given by conformally invariant field\ntheories with central charge $c=1$, corresponding to a ballistic universality\nclass with dynamical exponent $z=1$. We derive a phase diagram for atypical\nbehaviour that besides the conformally invariant regime exhibits a regime of\nphase separation for atypically low current or activity. On the phase\ntransition line, corresponding to typical behaviour, the dynamics belongs to\nthe Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class with dynamical exponent $z=3/2$,\nexcept for a diffusive point with $z=2$. We demonstrate the validity of the\ntheory for the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process with both\nperiodic and open boundaries by exact results for the dynamical structure in\nthe limit of maximal current.\n", "  The oxygen isotope ($^{16}$O/$^{18}$O) effect (OIE) on the pseudogap\n(charge-stripe ordering) temperature $T^{\\ast}$ is investigated for the cuprate\nsuperconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ as a function of doping $x$ by means\nof x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) studies. A strong $x$ dependent\nand sign reversed OIE on $T^{\\ast}$ is observed. The OIE exponent\n$\\alpha_{T^{\\ast}}$ systematically decreases from $\\alpha_{T^{\\ast}} = -\n0.6(1.3)$ for $x = 0.15$ to $\\alpha_{T^{\\ast}} = - 4.4(1.1)$ for $x = 0.06$,\ncorresponding to increasing $T^{\\ast}$ and decreasing superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$. Both $T^{\\ast}(^{16}{\\rm O})$ and\n$T^{\\ast}(^{18}{\\rm O})$ exhibit a linear doping dependence with different\nslopes and critical end points (where $T^{\\ast}(^{16}{\\rm O})$ and\n$T^{\\ast}(^{18}{\\rm O})$ fall to zero) at $x_{c}(^{16}{\\rm O}) = 0.201(4)$ and\n$x_{c}(^{18}{\\rm O}) = 0.182(3)$, indicating a large positive OIE of $x_{c}$\nwith an exponent of $\\alpha_{x_{c}} = 0.84(22)$. The remarkably large and\nstrongly doping dependent OIE on $T^{\\ast}$ signals a substantial involvement\nof the lattice in the formation of the pseudogap, consistent with a polaronic\napproach to cuprate superconductivity and the vibronic character of its ground\nstate.\n", "  We present the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) observations of the LIGO binary black hole merger event GW151226 and\ncandi- date LVT151012. No candidate electromagnetic counterparts were detected\nby either the GBM or LAT. We present a detailed analysis of the GBM and LAT\ndata over a range of timescales from seconds to years, using automated\npipelines and new techniques for char- acterizing the upper limits across a\nlarge area of the sky. Due to the partial GBM and LAT coverage of the large\nLIGO localization regions at the trigger times for both events, dif- ferences\nin source distances and masses, as well as the uncertain degree to which\nemission from these sources could be beamed, these non-detections cannot be\nused to constrain the variety of theoretical models recently applied to explain\nthe candidate GBM counterpart to GW150914.\n", "  We study the impact of stellar winds and supernovae on the multi-phase\ninterstellar medium using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations carried\nout with FLASH. The selected galactic disc region has a size of (500 pc)$^2$ x\n$\\pm$ 5 kpc and a gas surface density of 10 M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$. The simulations\ninclude an external stellar potential and gas self-gravity, radiative cooling\nand diffuse heating, sink particles representing star clusters, stellar winds\nfrom these clusters which combine the winds from indi- vidual massive stars by\nfollowing their evolution tracks, and subsequent supernova explosions. Dust and\ngas (self-)shielding is followed to compute the chemical state of the gas with\na chemical network. We find that stellar winds can regulate star (cluster)\nformation. Since the winds suppress the accretion of fresh gas soon after the\ncluster has formed, they lead to clusters which have lower average masses\n(10$^2$ - 10$^{4.3}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and form on shorter timescales (10$^{-3}$ -\n10 Myr). In particular we find an anti-correlation of cluster mass and\naccretion time scale. Without winds the star clusters easily grow to larger\nmasses for ~5 Myr until the first supernova explodes. Overall the most massive\nstars provide the most wind energy input, while objects beginning their\nevolution as B-type stars contribute most of the supernova energy input. A\nsignificant outflow from the disk (mass loading $\\gtrsim$ 1 at 1 kpc) can be\nlaunched by thermal gas pressure if more than 50% of the volume near the disc\nmid-plane can be heated to T > 3x10$^5$ K. Stellar winds alone cannot create a\nhot volume-filling phase. The models which are in best agreement with observed\nstar formation rates drive either no outflows or weak outflows.\n", "  Resource consumption of the conventional surface code is expensive, in part\ndue to the need to separate the defects that create the logical qubit far apart\non the physical qubit lattice. We propose that instantiating the\ndeformation-based surface code using superstabilizers makes it possible to\ndetect short error chains connecting the superstabilizers, allowing us to place\nlogical qubits close together. Additionally, we demonstrate the process of\nconversion from the defect-based surface code, which works as arbitrary state\ninjection, and a lattice surgery-like CNOT gate implementation that requires\nfewer physical qubits than the braiding CNOT gate. Finally we propose a\nplacement design for the deformation-based surface code and analyze its\nresource consumption; large scale quantum computation requires $\\frac{25}{4}d^2\n+5d + 1$ physical qubits per logical qubit where $d$ is the code distance,\nwhereas the planar code requires $16d^2 -16d + 4$ physical qubits per logical\nqubit, for a reduction of about 55%.\n", "  We apply the hydrodynamic theory of electron liquid to demonstrate that a\ncircularly polarized radiation induces the diamagnetic, helicity-sensitive dc\ncurrent in a ballistic nanoring. This current is dramatically enhanced in the\nvicinity of plasmonic resonances. The resulting magnetic moment of the nanoring\nrepresents a giant increase of the inverse Faraday effect. With increasing\nradiation intensity, linear plasmonic excitations evolve into the strongly\nnon-linear plasma shock waves. These excitations produce a series of the well\nresolved peaks at the THz frequencies. We demonstrate that the plasmonic wave\ndispersion transforms the shock waves into solitons. The predicted effects\nshould enable multiple applications in a wide frequency range (from the\nmicrowave to terahertz band) using optically controlled ultra low loss\nelectric, photonic and magnetic devices.\n", "  Recent studies have revealed an oscillating asymmetry in the vertical\nstructure of the Milky Way's disc. Here we analyze 16 high-resolution, fully\ncosmological simulations of the evolution of individual Milky Way-sized\ngalaxies, carried out with the MHD code AREPO. At redshift zero, about $70\\%$\nof our galactic discs show strong vertical patterns, with amplitudes that can\nexceed 2 kpc. Half of these are typical `integral sign' warps. The rest are\noscillations similar to those observed in the Milky Way. Such structures are\nthus expected to be common. The associated mean vertical motions can be as\nlarge as 30~km/s. Cold disc gas typically follows the vertical patterns seen in\nthe stars. These perturbations have a variety of causes: close encounters with\nsatellites, distant flybys of massive objects, accretion of misaligned cold gas\nfrom halo infall or from mergers. Tidally induced vertical patterns can be\nidentified in both young and old stellar populations, whereas those originating\nfrom cold gas accretion are seen mainly in the younger populations. Galaxies\nwith regular or at most weakly perturbed discs are usually, but not always,\nfree from recent interactions with massive companions, although we have one\ncase where an equilibrium compact disc reforms after a merger.\n", "  Topological quantum phases cannot be characterized by local order parameters\nin the bulk. In this work however, we show that signatures of a topological\nquantum critical point do remain in local observables in the bulk, and manifest\nthemselves as non-analyticities in their expectation values taken over a family\nof non-equilibrium states generated using a quantum quench protocol. The\nsignature can be used for precisely locating the critical points in parameter\nspace. A large class of initial states can be chosen for the quench (including\nfinite temperature states), the sufficient condition being existence of a\nfinite occupation-gradient with respect to energy for the single-particle\ncritical mode. We demonstrate these results in tractable models of\nnon-interacting fermions exhibiting topological phase transitions in one and\ntwo spatial dimensions. We also show that the non-analyticities can be absent\nif the gap-closing is non-topological, i.e., when it corresponds to no phase\ntransition.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate coherent control of a quantum system, whose\ndynamics is chaotic in the classical limit. Interaction of diatomic molecules\nwith a periodic sequence of ultrashort laser pulses leads to the dynamical\nlocalization of the molecular angular momentum, a characteristic feature of the\nchaotic quantum kicked rotor. By changing the phases of the rotational states\nin the initially prepared coherent wave packet, we control the rotational\ndistribution of the final localized state and its total energy. We demonstrate\nthe anticipated sensitivity of control to the exact parameters of the kicking\nfield, as well as its disappearance in the classical regime of excitation.\n", "  We study the Laplacian perturbed by two delta potentials on a two-dimensional\nflat torus. There are two types of eigenfunctions for this operator: old, or\nunperturbed eigenfunctions which are eigenfunctions of the standard Laplacian,\nand new, perturbed eigenfunctions which are affected by the scatterers. We\nprove that along a density one sequence, the new eigenfunctions are uniformly\ndistributed in configuration space, provided that the difference of the\nscattering points is Diophantine.\n", "  We address the issue of energy and charge dependence of global polarization\nof $\\Lambda$ hyperons in peripheral $Au-Au$ collisions recently observed by the\nSTAR collaboration at RHIC. We compare different contributions to the anomalous\nmechanism relating polarization to vorticity and hydrodynamic helicity in QCD\nmatter. We stress that the suppression of the gravitational anomaly\ncontribution in strongly correlated matter observed in lattice simulations\nconfirms our earlier prediction of rapid decrease of polarization with\nincreasing collision energy. Our mechanism leads to polarization of $\\bar\n\\Lambda$ of the same sign and larger magnitude than the polarization of\n$\\Lambda$. The energy and charge dependence of polarization is suggested as a\nsensitive probe of fine details of QCD matter structure.\n", "  The existence of tiny neutrino masses at a scale more than a million times\nsmaller than the lightest charged fermion mass, namely the electron, and their\nmixings can not be explained within the framework of the exceptionally\nsuccessful Standard Model. There are four ideas that has been proposed to\nexplain the tiny neutrino masses. These include the see-saw mechanism with a\nright handed neutrino at the GUT scale, and this is the most elegant mechanism.\nThe other mechanisms are radiatively generated neutrino masses, the neutrino\nmass arising from a 2nd Higgs doublet having a tiny VEV and coupling only to\nthe neutrinos, and finally the mirror model or simply the EW-scale $\\nu_R$\nmodel. The mirror model has new quarks and leptons of opposite chirality at the\nelectroweak scale (for the same Standard Model gauge symmetry $SU(2)_W \\times\nU(1)_Y$) compared to what we have for the Standard Model. With suitable\nmodification of the Higgs sector, the EW-scale $\\nu_R$ model satisfies the\nelectroweak precision test and also the constraints coming from the observed\n125-GeV Higgs scalar. Since in this model, the mirror fermions are required to\nbe in the EW scale, these can be produced at the LHC giving final states with a\nvery low background from the SM. One such final state is the same sign\ndileptons with large missing $p_T$ for the events. In this work, we explore the\nconstraint provided by the $8$ TeV data, and prospect of observing this signal\nin the $13$ TeV runs at the LHC. Additional signals will be the presence of\ndisplaced vertices depending on the smallness of the Yukawa couplings of the\nmirror leptons with the ordinary leptons and the singlet Higgs present in the\nmodel. Of particular importance to the EW-scale $\\nu_R$ model is the production\nof $\\nu_R$ which will be a direct test of the seesaw mechanism at collider\nenergies.\n", "  Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies are dominated by dark matter halo from\nthe innermost radii; hence they are ideal candidates to investigate the\ninfluence of dark matter on different dynamical aspects of spiral galaxies.\nHere, we study the effect of dark matter halo on grand-design, m = 2, spiral\nmodes in a galactic disk, treated as a collisionless system, by carrying out a\nglobal modal analysis within the WKB approximation. First, we study a\nsuperthin, LSB galaxy UGC 7321 and show that it does not support discrete\nglobal spiral modes when modeled as a disk-alone system or as a disk plus dark\nmatter system. Even a moderate increase in the stellar central surface density\ndoes not yield any global spiral modes. This naturally explains the observed\nlack of strong large-scale spiral structure in LSBs. An earlier work (Ghosh,\nSaini & Jog, 2016) where the galactic disk was treated as a fluid system for\nsimplicity had shown that the dominant halo could not arrest global modes. We\nfound that this difference arises due to the different dispersion relation used\nin the two cases and which plays a crucial role in the search for global spiral\nmodes. Thus the correct treatment of stars as a collisionless system as done\nhere results in the suppression of global spiral modes, in agreement with the\nobservations. We performed a similar modal analysis for the Galaxy, and found\nthat the dark matter halo has a negligible effect on large-scale spiral\nstructure.\n", "  We develop a multidimensionally constrained relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov\n(MDC-RHB) model in which the pairing correlations are taken into account by\nmaking the Bogoliubov transformation. In this model, the nuclear shape is\nassumed to be invariant under the reversion of $x$ and $y$ axes; i.e., the\nintrinsic symmetry group is $V_4$ and all shape degrees of freedom\n$\\beta_{\\lambda\\mu}$ with even $\\mu$ are included self-consistently. The RHB\nequation is solved in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis. A\nseparable pairing force of finite range is adopted in the MDC-RHB model. The\npotential energy curves of neutron-rich even-even Zr isotopes are calculated\nwith relativistic functionals DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 and possible tetrahedral shapes\nin the ground and isomeric states are investigated. The ground state shape of\n$^{110}$Zr is predicted to be tetrahedral with both functionals and so is that\nof $^{112}$Zr with the functional DD-PC1. The tetrahedral ground states are\ncaused by large energy gaps around $Z=40$ and $N=70$ when $\\beta_{32}$\ndeformation is included. Although the inclusion of the $\\beta_{30}$ deformation\ncan also reduce the energy around $\\beta_{20}=0$ and lead to minima with\npear-like shapes for nuclei around $^{110}$Zr, these minima are unstable due to\ntheir shallowness.\n", "  Recently, evidence was provided for the existence of an $a$-function for\nrenormalisable quantum field theories in three dimensions. An explicit\nexpression was given at lowest order for general theories involving scalars and\nfermions, and shown to be related to the beta-functions by a gradient flow\nequation with positive-definite metric as in four dimensions. Here, we extend\nthis lowest-order calculation to a general abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory\ncoupled to fermions and scalars, and derive a prediction for part of the\nfour-loop Yukawa beta-function. We also compute the complete four-loop Yukawa\nbeta-function for the scalar-fermion theory and show that it is entirely\nconsistent with the gradient flow equations at next-to-leading order.\n", "  Accounting for electrons and nuclei simultaneously is a powerful capability\nof ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). However, AIMD is often unable to\naccurately reproduce properties of systems such as water due to inaccuracies in\nthe underlying electronic density functionals. This shortcoming is often\naddressed by added empirical corrections and/or increasing the simulation\ntemperature. We present here a maximum-entropy approach to directly incorporate\nlimited experimental data via a minimal bias. Biased AIMD simulations of water\nand an excess proton in water are shown to give significantly improved\nproperties both for observables which were biased to match experimental data\nand for unbiased observables. This approach also yields new physical insight\ninto inaccuracies in the underlying density functional theory as utilized in\nthe unbiased AIMD.\n", "  A method to simulate anomalous fermion-boson interactions in Wtb vertex is\npresented with a minimal set of simulated samples of single top quark events at\nthe LHC energies. In proposed method additional auxiliary vector fields\ncorresponding to the Standard Model gauge fields are implemented for each type\nof the anomalous vertex structure. The method allows to simulate a\nmanifestation of anomalous gauge couplings in two approaches used in\nexperimental analyses either keeping only the linear order contributions in the\nanomalous couplings or keeping all contributions in numerators and denominators\nas appeared in matrix elements. All the single top quark production mechanisms,\n$t$-, $s$- and associative tW-channels are considered. The correctness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated.\n", "  The core issue for the implementation of the diamond NV centre qubits\ntechnology is the sensitive readout of NV spin state. We have recently\ndemonstrated the photoelectric detection of NV magnetic resonances (PDMR),\nanticipated to be faster and more sensitive than optical detection (ODMR). Here\nwe report on a PDMR contrast of 9 % - three times enhanced compared to previous\nwork - on shallow N-implanted diamond. Based on ab-initio modelling, we\ndemonstrate a novel one-photon ionization dual-beam PDMR protocol. We predict\nthat this scheme is significantly less vulnerable to the influence of defects\nsuch as substitutional nitrogen.\n", "  Gravitational lensing is a good probe into the topological structure of dark\ngravitating celestial objects. In this paper, we investigate the light curve of\na light ray that passes through the throat of an Ellis wormhole, the simplest\nexample of traversable wormholes. The method developed here is also applicable\nto other traversable wormholes. To study whether the light curve of a light ray\nthat passes through a wormhole throat is distinguishable from that which does\nnot, we also calculate light curves without the passage of a throat for an\nEllis wormhole, a Schwarzschild black hole, and an ultrastatic wormhole with\nthe spatial geometry identical to that of the Schwarzschild black hole in the\nfollowing two cases: (i) \"microlensing,\" where the source, lens, and observer\nare almost aligned in this order and the light ray starts at the source,\nrefracts in the weak gravitational field of the lens with a small deflection\nangle, and reaches the observer, and (ii) \"retrolensing,\" where the source,\nobserver, and lens are almost aligned in this order, and the light ray starts\nat the source, refracts in the vicinity of the light sphere of the lens with a\ndeflection angle very close to $\\pi$, and reaches the observer. We find that\nthe light curve of the light ray that passes through the throat of the Ellis\nwormhole is clearly distinguishable from that by the microlensing but not from\nthat by the retrolensing. This is because the light curve of a light ray that\npasses by a light sphere of a lens with a large deflection angle has common\ncharacters, irrespective of the details of the lens object. This implies that\nthe light curves of the light rays that pass through the throat of more general\ntraversable wormholes are qualitatively the same as that of the Ellis wormhole.\n", "  We discuss implications of Weak gravity conjecture (WGC) for exotic D-brane\ninstantons. In particular, WGC leads to indirect stringent bounds on\nnon-perturbative superpotentials generated by exotic instantons, with many\nimplications for phenomenology: R-parity violating processes, neutrino mass,\n$\\mu$-problem, Neutron-Antineutron transitions and collider physics.\n", "  Chirality is an important concept that describes the asymmetry property of a\nsystem, which usually emerges spontaneously due to mirror symmetry breaking.\nSuch spontaneous chirality manifests predominantly as parity breaking in modern\nphysics, which has been studied extensively, for instance, in Higgs physics,\ndouble-well Bose-Einstein condensates, topological insulators and\nsuperconductors. In the optical domain, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking\nhas been elusive experimentally, especially for micro- and nano-photonics which\ndemands multiple identical subsystems, such as photonic nanocavities,\nmeta-molecules and other dual-core settings. Here, for the first time, we\nobserve spontaneous emergence of a chiral field in a single ultrahigh-Q\nwhispering- gallery microresonator. This counter-intuitive effect arises due to\nthe inherent Kerr nonlinearity-modulated coupling between clockwise (CW) and\ncounterclockwise (CCW) propagating waves. At an ultra-weak input threshold of a\nfew hundred microwatts, the initial chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously,\nand the CW-to-CCW output ratio reaches 20:1. The spontaneous chirality in\nmicroresonator holds great potential in studies of fundamental physics and\napplied photonic devices.\n", "  We study the off-equilibrium behavior of systems with short-range\ninteractions driven across a thermal first-order transition, where the dynamics\nis exponentially slow. We consider a dynamics that starts in the high-T phase\nat time t = t_i<0 and ends in in the low-T phase at t=t_f>0, with a\ntime-dependent temperature T(t)/T_c \\approx 1 - t/t_s, where t_s is the\nprotocol time scale. A general off-equilibrium scaling (OS) behavior emerges in\nthe limit of large t_s. We check it at the first-order transition of the\ntwo-dimensional q-state Potts model with q=10 and 20. The numerical results\nshow evidence of a dynamic transition, where the OS functions show a\nspinodal-like singularity. Therefore, the general mean-field picture valid for\nsystems with long-range interactions is qualitatively recovered, provided the\ntime dependence is appropriately (logarithmically) rescaled.\n", "  The relativistic dynamic equations are derived for a\nsuperfluid-superconducting mixture coupled to the electromagnetic field. For\ndefiniteness, and bearing in mind possible applications of our results to\nneutron stars, it is assumed that the mixture is composed of superfluid\nneutrons, superconducting protons, and normal electrons. Proton\nsuperconductivity of both I and II types is analysed, and possible presence of\nneutron and proton vortices (or magnetic domains in the case of type-I proton\nsuperconductivity) is allowed for. The derived equations neglect all\ndissipative effects except for the mutual friction dissipation and are valid\nfor arbitrary temperatures (i.e. they do not imply that all nucleons are\npaired), which is especially important for magnetar conditions. It is\ndemonstrated that these general equations can be substantially simplified for\ntypical neutron stars, for which a kind of magnetohydrodynamic approximation is\njustified. Our results are compared to the nonrelativistic formulations\nexisting in the literature and a number of discrepancies are found. In\nparticular, it is shown that, generally, the electric displacement ${\\pmb D}$\ndoes not coincide with the electric field ${\\pmb E}$, contrary to what is\nstated in the previous works. The relativistic framework developed here is\neasily extendable to account for more sophisticated microphysics models and it\nprovides the necessary basis for realistic modelling of neutron stars.\n", "  The direct detection of Dark Matter particles with mass below the GeV-scale\nis hampered by soft nuclear recoil energies and finite detector thresholds. For\na given maximum relative velocity, the kinematics of elastic Dark Matter\nnucleus scattering sets a principal limit on detectability. Here we propose to\nbypass the kinematic limitations by considering the inelastic channel of photon\nemission in the nuclear recoil. Our proposed method allows to set the first\nlimits on Dark Matter below 500 MeV in the plane of Dark Matter mass and cross\nsection with nucleons. In situations where a Dark Matter-electron coupling is\nsuppressed, Bremsstrahlung may constitute the only path to probe low-mass Dark\nMatter awaiting new detector technologies with lowered recoil energy\nthresholds.\n", "  Multi-level quantum protocols may potentially supersede standard quantum\noptical polarization-encoded protocols in terms of amount of information\ntransmission and security. However, for free space telecomunications, we do not\nhave tools for limiting loss due to diffraction and perturbations, as for\nexample turbulence in air. Here we study propagation invariant quantum X-waves\nwith angular momentum; this representation expresses the electromagnetic field\nas a quantum gas of weakly interacting bosons. The resulting spatio-temporal\nquantized light pulses are not subject to diffraction and dispersion, and are\nintrinsically resilient to disturbances in propagation. We show that\nspontaneous down-conversion generates squeezed X-waves useful for quantum\nprotocols. Surprisingly the orbital angural momentum affects the squeezing\nangle, and we predict the existence of a characteristic axicon aperture for\nmaximal squeezing. There results may boost the applications in free space of\nquantum optical transmission and multi-level quantum protocols, and may also be\nrelevant for novel kinds of interferometers, as satellite-based gravitational\nwave detectors.\n", "  Symmetry plays a fundamental role in our understanding of both conventional\nsymmetry breaking phases and the more exotic quantum and topological phases of\nmatter. We explore the experimental signatures of symmetry enriched U(1)\nquantum spin liquids (QSLs) on the pyrochlore lattice. We point out that the Ce\nlocal moment of the newly discovered pyrochlore QSL candidate\nCe$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, is a dipole-octupole doublet. The generic model for these\nunusual doublets supports two distinct symmetry enriched U(1) QSL ground states\nin the corresponding quantum spin ice regimes. These two U(1) QSLs are dubbed\ndipolar U(1) QSL and octupolar U(1) QSL. While the dipolar U(1) QSL has been\ndiscussed in many contexts, the octupolar U(1) QSL is rather unique. Based on\nthe symmetry properties of the dipole-octupole doublets, we predict the\npeculiar physical properties of the octupolar U(1) QSL, elucidating the unique\nspectroscopic properties in the externalmagnetic fields. We further predict the\nAnderson-Higgs transition from the octupolar U(1) QSL driven by the external\nmagnetic fields. We identify the experimental relevance with the candidate\nmaterial Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and other dipole-octupole doublet systems.\n", "  The Bondi solution, which describes the radial inflow of a gas onto a\nnon-rotating black hole, provides a powerful test for numerical relativistic\ncodes. However, the Bondi solution is usually derived in Schwarzschild\ncoordinates, which are not well suited for dynamical spacetime evolutions.\nInstead, many current numerical relativistic codes adopt moving-puncture\ncoordinates, which render black holes in trumpet geometries. Here we transform\nthe Bondi solution into trumpet coordinates, which result in regular\nexpressions for the fluid flow extending into the black-hole interior. We also\nevolve these solutions numerically and demonstrate their usefulness for testing\nand calibrating numerical codes.\n", "  We deduce the intrinsic conductivity properties of the ferroelectric domain\nwalls around the topologically protected domain vortex cores in multiferroic\nYMnO3. This is achieved by performing a careful equivalent-circuit analysis of\ndielectric spectra measured in single-crystalline samples with different vortex\ndensities. The conductivity contrast between the bulk domains and the less\nconducting domain boundaries is revealed to reach up to a factor 500 at room\ntemperature, depending on sample preparation. Tunneling of localized defect\ncharge carriers is the dominant charge-transport process in the domain walls\nthat are depleted of mo-bile charge carriers. This work demonstrates that via\nequivalent-circuit analysis, dielectric spectroscopy can provide valuable\ninformation on the intrinsic charge-transport properties of ferroelectric\ndomain walls, which is of high relevance for the design of new\ndomain-wall-based microelectronic devices.\n", "  We investigate the anisotropic clustering of the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) sample, which consists of\n$1\\,198\\,006$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.75$ and a sky\ncoverage of $10\\,252\\,$deg$^2$. We analyse this dataset in Fourier space, using\nthe power spectrum multipoles to measure Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD)\nsimultaneously with the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) scale. We include the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and\nhexadecapole in our analysis and compare our measurements with a perturbation\ntheory based model, while properly accounting for the survey window function.\nTo evaluate the reliability of our analysis pipeline we participate in a mock\nchallenge, which resulted in systematic uncertainties significantly smaller\nthan the statistical uncertainties. While the high-redshift constraint on\n$f\\sigma_8$ at $z_{\\rm eff}=0.61$ indicates a small ($\\sim 1.4\\sigma$)\ndeviation from the prediction of the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM model, the\nlow-redshift constraint is in good agreement with Planck $\\Lambda$CDM. This\npaper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from\nBOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others\nin~\\citet{Alam2016} to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.\n", "  We compile an updated list of 38 measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$\nbetween redshifts $0.07 \\leq z \\leq 2.36$ and use them to place constraints on\nmodel parameters of constant and time-varying dark energy cosmological models,\nboth spatially flat and curved. We use five models to measure the redshift of\nthe cosmological deceleration-acceleration transition, $z_{\\rm da}$, from these\n$H(z)$ data. Within the error bars, the measured $z_{\\rm da}$ are insensitive\nto the model used, depending only on the value assumed for the Hubble constant\n$H_0$. The weighted mean of our measurements is $z_{\\rm da} = 0.72 \\pm 0.05\\\n(0.84 \\pm 0.03)$ for $H_0 = 68 \\pm 2.8\\ (73.24 \\pm 1.74)$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$ and should provide a reasonably model-independent estimate of this\ncosmological parameter. The $H(z)$ data are consistent with the standard\nspatially-flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model but do not rule out non-flat\nmodels or dynamical dark energy models.\n", "  We report on the search for gamma-ray emission from 20 magnetars using 6\nyears of Fermi, Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. No significant\nevidence for gamma-ray emission from any of the currently-known magnetars is\nfound. We derived the most stringent upper limits to date on the 0.1--10 GeV\nemission of Galactic magnetars, which are estimated between\n$\\sim10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Gamma-ray pulsations were\nsearched for the four magnetars having reliable ephemerides over the observing\nperiod, but none were detected. On the other hand, we also studied the\ngamma-ray morphology and spectra of seven Supernova Remnants associated or\nadjacent to the magnetars.\n", "  We discuss a generalization of the classic Keplerian disk test problem\nallowing for both pressure and rotational support, as a method of testing\nastrophysical codes incorporating both gravitation and hydrodynamics. We argue\nfor the inclusion of pressure in rotating disk simulations on the grounds that\nrealistic, astrophysical disks exhibit non-negligible pressure support. We then\napply this test problem to examine the performance of various smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) methods incorporating a number of improvements proposed\nover the years to help SPH better address problems noted in modeling the\nclassical gravitation only Keplerian disk. We also apply this test to a newly\ndeveloped extension of SPH based on reproducing kernels called CRKSPH.\nCounterintuitively, we find that pressure support worsens the performance of\ntraditional SPH on this problem, causing unphysical collapse away from the\nsteady-state disk solution even more rapidly than the purely gravitational\nproblem, whereas CRKSPH greatly reduces this error.\n", "  A Light Emitting Diode (LED) based on a two dimensional (2D) Hybrid\nOrganic-Inorganic Semiconductor (HOIS) functioning at room temperature is\ndemonstrated. LED is fabricated by depositing a layer of\n(4-fluorophenethylamine-H)2PbI4 on an ITO substrate. It is the first time that\nsuch a room temperature excitonic LED based on 2D lead iodide perovskite is\npresented, as well as for its simplicity, low cost, ambient conditions\nfabrication and functioning at 5-10V. The newly introduced class of 3D HOIS\nperovskite LEDs, is now broadened with the implementation of the 2D HOIS. Novel\nfunctionalities can be realized since it is now possible to access the hybrid's\n2D semiconductor advantageous properties, such as increased excitonic binding\nenergy, oscillator strength and peak wavelength tunability.\n", "  Automated arc detection methods are needed to scan the ongoing and\nnext-generation wide-field imaging surveys, which are expected to contain\nthousands of strong lensing systems. Arc finders are also required for a\nquantitative comparison between predictions and observations of arc abundance.\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed to this end, but machine learning methods\nhave remained as a relatively unexplored step in the arc finding process. In\nthis work we introduce a new arc finder based on pattern recognition, which\nuses a set of morphological measurements derived from the Mediatrix\nFilamentation Method as entries to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We show\na full example of the application of the arc finder, first training and\nvalidating the ANN on simulated arcs and then applying the code on four Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) images of strong lensing systems. The simulated arcs use\nsimple prescriptions for the lens and the source, while mimicking HST\nobservational conditions. We also consider a sample of objects from HST images\nwith no arcs in the training of the ANN classification. We use the training and\nvalidation process to determine a suitable set of ANN configurations, including\nthe combination of inputs from the Mediatrix method, so as to maximize the\ncompleteness while keeping the false positives low. In the simulations the\nmethod was able to achieve a completeness of about 90% with respect to the arcs\nthat are input to the ANN after a preselection. However, this completeness\ndrops to $\\sim$ 70% on the HST images. The false detections are of the order of\n3% of the objects detected in these images. The combination of Mediatrix\nmeasurements with an ANN is a promising tool for the pattern recognition phase\nof arc finding. More realistic simulations and a larger set of real systems are\nneeded for a better training and assessment of the efficiency of the method.\n", "  An alternative neutrino oscillation process is presented as a counterexample\nfor which the neutrino may have nil mass consistent with the standard model.\nThe process is developed in a quantum trajectories representation of quantum\nmechanics, which has a Hamilton-Jacobi foundation. This process has no need for\nmass differences between mass eigenstates. Flavor oscillations and\n$\\bar{\\nu},\\nu$ oscillations are examined.\n", "  We describe the Zonal Atmospheric Stellar Parameters Estimator (ZASPE), a new\nalgorithm, and its associated code, for determining precise stellar atmospheric\nparameters and their uncertainties from high resolution echelle spectra of\nFGK-type stars. ZASPE estimates stellar atmospheric parameters by comparing the\nobserved spectrum against a grid of synthetic spectra only in the most\nsensitive spectral zones to changes in the atmospheric parameters. Realistic\nuncertainties in the parameters are computed from the data itself, by taking\ninto account the systematic mismatches between the observed spectrum and the\nbest-fit synthetic one. The covariances between the parameters are also\nestimated in the process. ZASPE can in principle use any pre-calculated grid of\nsynthetic spectra. We tested the performance of two existing libraries (Coehelo\net al. 2005, Husser et al. 2013) and we concluded that neither is suitable for\ncomputing precise atmospheric parameters. We describe a process to synthesise a\nnew library of synthetic spectra that was found to generate consistent results\nwhen compared with parameters obtained with different methods (interferometry,\nasteroseismology, equivalent widths).\n", "  We show that a recently discovered relation, which expresses tree-level\nsingle trace Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes with one graviton and $(n-1)$ gauge\nbosons as a linear combination of pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes with $n$\ngauge bosons, can be derived from the CHY representation. In addition we show\nthat there is a generalisation, which expresses tree-level single trace\nEinstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes with $r$ gravitons and $(n-r)$ gauge bosons as a\nlinear combination of pure Yang-Mills tree amplitudes with $n$ gauge bosons. We\npresent a general formula for this case.\n", "  First passage under restart has recently emerged as a conceptual framework\nsuitable for the description of a wide range of phenomena, but the endless\nvariety of ways in which restart mechanisms and first passage processes mix and\nmatch hindered the identification of unifying principles and general truths.\nHope that these exist came from a recently discovered universality displayed by\nprocesses under optimal, constant rate, restart---but extensions and\ngeneralizations proved challenging as they marry arbitrarily complex processes\nand restart mechanisms. To address this challenge, we develop a generic\napproach to first passage under restart. Key features of diffusion under\nrestart---the ultimate poster boy for this wide and diverse class of\nproblems---are then shown to be completely universal.\n", "  We study classical solutions in the Weyl-transverse (WTDiff) gravity. The\nWTDiff gravity is invariant under both the local Weyl (conformal)\ntransformation and the volume preserving diffeormorphisms (transverse\ndiffeomorphisms) and is known to be equivalent to general relativity at least\nat the classical level. In particular, we find that in a general space-time\ndimension, the Schwarzschild metric is a classical solution in the WTDiff\ngravity when it is expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n", "  Two of the most widely observed and yet most puzzling features of the Sun's\nmagnetic field are coronal loops that are smooth and laminar and\nprominences/filaments that are strongly sheared. These two features would seem\nto be quite unrelated in that the loops are near their minimum-energy\ncurrent-free state, whereas filaments are regions of high magnetic stress and\nintense electric currents. We argue that, in fact, these two features are\ninextricably linked in that both are due to a single process: the injection of\nmagnetic helicity into the corona by photospheric motions and the subsequent\nevolution of this helicity by coronal reconnection. In this paper, we present\nnumerical simulations of the response of a \\citet{Parker72} corona to\nphotospheric driving motions that have varying degrees of helicity preference.\nWe obtain four main conclusions: 1) in agreement with the helicity condensation\nmodel of \\citet{Antiochos13}, the inverse cascade of helicity by magnetic\nreconnection results in the formation of prominences/filaments localized about\npolarity inversion lines (PILs); 2) this same process removes most structure\nfrom the rest of the corona, resulting in smooth and laminar coronal loops; 3)\nthe amount of remnant tangling in coronal loops is inversely dependent on the\nnet helicity injected by the driving motions; and 4) the structure of the solar\ncorona depends only on the helicity preference of the driving motions and not\non their detailed time dependence. We discuss the implications of our results\nfor high-resolution observations of the corona.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy (EE) of Gaussian systems on a lattice with\nperiodic boundary conditions, both in the vacuum and at nonzero temperatures.\nBy restricting the reduced subsystem to periodic sublattices, we can compute\nthe entanglement spectrum and EE exactly. We illustrate this for a free\n(1+1)-dimensional massive scalar field at a fixed temperature. Consistent with\nprevious literature, we demonstrate that for a sufficiently large periodic\nsublattice the EE grows extensively, even in the vacuum. Furthermore, the\nanalytic expression for the EE allows us probe its behavior both in the\nmassless limit and in the continuum limit at any temperature.\n", "  We conducted a deep narrow-band imaging survey with the Subaru Prime Focus\nCamera on the Subaru Telescope and constructed a sample of Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\n(LAEs) at z=2.53 in the UDS-CANDELS field where a sample of H$\\alpha$ emitters\n(HAEs) at the same redshift is already obtained from our previous narrow-band\nobservation at NIR. The deep narrow-band and multi broadband data allow us to\nfind LAEs of stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFRs) down to\n$\\gtrsim$$10^8$ M$_\\odot$ and $\\gtrsim$0.2 M$_\\odot$/yr, respectively. We show\nthat the LAEs are located along the same mass-SFR sequence traced by normal\nstar-forming galaxies such as HAEs, but towards a significantly lower mass\nregime. Likewise, LAEs seem to share the same mass--size relation with typical\nstar-forming galaxies, except for the massive LAEs, which tend to show\nsignificantly compact sizes. We identify a vigorous mass growth in the central\npart of LAEs: the stellar mass density in the central region of LAEs increases\nas their total galaxy mass grows. On the other hand, we see no Ly$\\alpha$ line\nin emission for most of the HAEs. Rather, we find that the Ly$\\alpha$ feature\nis either absent or in absorption (Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers; LAAs), and its\nabsorption strength may increase with reddening of the UV continuum slope. We\ndemonstrate that a deep Ly$\\alpha$ narrow-band imaging like this study is able\nto search for not only LAEs but also LAAs in a certain redshift slice. This\nwork suggests that LAEs trace normal star-forming galaxies in the low-mass\nregime, while they remain as a unique population because the majority of HAEs\nare not LAEs.\n", "  We use the BAHAMAS and MACSIS hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the impact\nof baryons on the mass distribution and dynamics of massive galaxy clusters, as\nwell as the bias in X-ray and weak lensing mass estimates. These simulations\nuse the sub-grid physics models calibrated in the BAHAMAS project, which\ninclude feedback from both supernovae and active galactic nuclei. They form a\ncluster population covering almost two orders of magnitude in mass, with more\nthan 3,500 clusters with masses greater than $10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ at\n$z=0$. We start by characterising the clusters in terms of their spin, shape\nand density profile, before considering the bias in both weak lensing and\nhydrostatic mass estimates. Whilst including baryonic effects leads to more\nspherical, centrally concentrated clusters, the median weak lensing mass bias\nis unaffected by the presence of baryons. In both the dark matter only and\nhydrodynamic simulations, the weak lensing measurements underestimate cluster\nmasses by ${\\approx}10\\%$ for clusters with\n$M_{200}{\\leq}10^{15}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and this bias tends to zero at higher\nmasses. We also consider the hydrostatic bias when using both the true density\nand temperature profiles, and those derived from X-ray spectroscopy. When using\nspectroscopic temperatures and densities, the hydrostatic bias decreases as a\nfunction of mass, leading to a bias of ${\\approx}40\\%$ for clusters with\n$M_{500}{\\geq}10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. This is due to the presence of cooler\ngas in the cluster outskirts. Using mass weighted temperatures and the true\ndensity profile reduces this bias to $5{-}15\\%$.\n", "  The giant $k$-core --- maximal connected subgraph of a network where each\nnode has at least $k$ neighbors --- is important in the study of phase\ntransitions and in applications of network theory. Unlike Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\ngraphs and other random networks where $k$-cores emerge discontinuously for\n$k\\ge 3$, we show that transitive linking (or triadic closure) leads to 3-cores\nemerging through single or double phase transitions of both discontinuous and\ncontinuous nature. We also develop a $k$-core calculation that includes\nclustering and provides insights into how high-level connectivity emerges.\n", "  We study ambipolar diffusion in strongly magnetised neutron stars, with\nspecial focus on the effects of neutrino reaction rates and the impact of a\nsuperfluid/superconducting transition in the neutron star core. For\naxisymmetric magnetic field configurations, we determine the deviation from\n$\\beta-$equilibrium induced by the magnetic force and calculate the velocity of\nthe slow, quasi-stationary, ambipolar drift. We study the temperature\ndependence of the velocity pattern and clearly identify the transition to a\npredominantly solenoidal flow. For stars without superconducting/superfluid\nconstituents and with a mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic field of typical\nmagnetar strength, we find that ambipolar diffusion proceeds fast enough to\nhave a significant impact on the magnetic field evolution only at low core\ntemperatures, $T \\lesssim 1-2\\times10^8$ K. The ambipolar diffusion timescale\nbecomes appreciably shorter when fast neutrino reactions are present, because\nthe possibility to balance part of the magnetic force with pressure gradients\nis reduced. We also find short ambipolar diffusion timescales in the case of\nsuperconducting cores for $T \\lesssim 10^9$ K, due to the reduced interaction\nbetween protons and neutrons. In the most favourable scenario, with fast\nneutrino reactions and superconducting cores, ambipolar diffusion results in\nadvection velocities of several km/kyr. This velocity can substantially\nreorganize magnetic fields in magnetar cores, in a way that can only be\nconfirmed by dynamical simulations.\n", "  Ground-based interferometers are not perfectly all-sky instruments, and it is\nimportant to account for their behavior when considering the distribution of\ndetected events. In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to\nsources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the\nsensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do\nnot acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable\nsources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data\nduring their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight\nthan noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects\nand how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond\ngalactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that\nequatorial observatories can access over $80\\%$ of the localization\nprobability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\\%$. Facilities\nlocated near the two LIGO sites can observe sources closer to their zenith than\ntheir analogs in the South, but the average observation will still be no closer\nthan $44^\\circ$ from zenith. We also find that observatories in Africa or the\nSouth Atlantic will wait systematically longer before they can begin observing\ncompared to the rest of the world, although there is a preference for\nlongitudes near the LIGOs. These effects, along with knowledge of the LIGO\nantenna pattern, can inform electromagnetic follow-up activities and\noptimization, including the possibility of directing observations even before\ngravitational-wave events occur.\n", "  NGC 2617 is a nearby ($z\\sim 0.01$) active galaxy that recently switched from\nbeing a Seyfert 1.8 to be a Seyfert 1.0. At the same time, it underwent a\nstrong increase of X-ray flux by one order of magnitude with respect to\narchival measurements. We characterise the X-ray spectral and timing properties\nof NGC 2617 with the aim of studying the physics of a changing-look active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). We performed a comprehensive timing and spectral\nanalysis of two XMM-Newton pointed observations spaced by one month,\ncomplemented by archival quasi-simultaneous INTEGRAL observations. We found\nthat, to the first order, NGC 2617 looks like a type 1 AGN in the X-ray band\nand, with the addition of a modest reflection component, its continuum can be\nmodelled well either with a power law plus a phenomenological blackbody, a\npartially covered power law, or a double Comptonisation model. Independent of\nthe continuum adopted, in all three cases a column density of a few $10^{23}$\ncm$^{-2}$ of neutral gas covering 20-40\\% of the continuum source is required\nby the data. Most interestingly, absorption structures due to highly ionised\niron have been detected in both observations with a redshift of about $0.1c$\nwith respect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy. The redshifted\nabsorber can be ascribed to a failed wind/aborted jets component, to\ngravitational redshift effects, and/or to matter directly falling towards the\ncentral supermassive black hole. In either case, we are probing the innermost\naccretion flow around the central supermassive black hole of NGC 2617 and might\nbe even watching matter in a direct inflow towards the black hole itself.\n", "  We present an accurate study of the static-nucleus electronic energy band gap\nof solid molecular hydrogen at high pressure. The excitonic and quasiparticle\ngaps of the $C2/c$, $Pc$, $Pbcn$, and $P6_3/m$ structures at pressures of 250,\n300, and 350~GPa are calculated using the fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte\nCarlo (DMC) method. The difference between the mean-field and many-body band\ngaps at the same density is found to be almost independent of system size and\ncan therefore be applied as a scissor correction to the mean-field gap of an\ninfinite system to obtain an estimate of the many-body gap in the thermodynamic\nlimit. By comparing our static-nucleus DMC energy gaps with available\nexperimental results, we demonstrate the important role played by nuclear\nquantum effects in the electronic structure of solid hydrogen. Our DMC results\nsuggest that the metallization of high-pressure solid hydrogen occurs via a\nstructural phase transition rather than band gap closure.\n", "  We investigate high-redshift galaxy sizes using a semi-analytic model\nconstructed for the Dark-ages Reionization And Galaxy-formation Observables\nfrom Numerical Simulation project. Our fiducial model, including strong\nfeedback from supernovae and photoionization background, accurately reproduces\nthe evolution of the stellar mass function and UV luminosity function. Using\nthis model, we study the size--luminosity relation of galaxies and find that\nthe effective radius scales with UV luminosity as $R_\\mathrm{e}\\propto\nL^{0.25}$ at $z{\\sim}5$--$9$. We show that recently discovered very luminous\ngalaxies at $z{\\sim}7$ (Bowler et al. 2016) and $z{\\sim}11$ (Oesch et al. 2016)\nlie on our predicted size--luminosity relations. We find that a significant\nfraction of galaxies at $z>8$ will not be resolved by JWST, but GMT will have\nthe ability to resolve all galaxies in haloes above the atomic cooling limit.\nWe show that our fiducial model successfully reproduces the redshift evolution\nof average galaxy sizes at $z>5$. We also explore galaxy sizes in models\nwithout supernova feedback. The no-supernova feedback models produce galaxy\nsizes that are smaller than observations. We therefore confirm that supernova\nfeedback plays an important role in determining the size--luminosity relation\nof galaxies and its redshift evolution during reionization.\n", "  The conditions of stability of the superfluid phase in double layer systems\nwith pairing of spatially separated electrons and holes in the low density\nlimit are studied. The general expression for the collective excitation\nspectrum is obtained. It is shown that under increase in the distance $d$\nbetween the layers the minimum emerges in the excitation spectrum. When d\nreaches the critical value the superfluid state becomes unstable relative to\nthe formation of a kind of the Wigner crystal state. The same instability\noccurs at fixed d under increase in the density of carries. It is established\nthat the critical distance and the critical density are related to each other\nby the inverse power function. The impact of the impurities on the temperature\nof the superfluid transition is investigated. The impact is found weak at the\nimpurity concentration smaller than the density of the pairs. It is shown that\nin the rarefied system the critical temperature T_c = 100 K can be reached.\n", "  Observations of the flow on Jupiter exists essentially only for the\ncloud-level, which is dominated by strong east-west jet-streams. These have\nbeen suggested to result from dynamics in a superficial thin weather-layer, or\nalternatively be a manifestation of deep interior cylindrical flows. However,\nit is possible that the observed winds are indeed superficial, yet there exists\ndeep flow that is completely decoupled from it. To date, all models linking the\nwind, via the induced density anomalies, to the gravity field, to be measured\nby Juno, consider only flow that is a projection of the observed could-level\nwind. Here we explore the possibility of complex wind dynamics that include\nboth the shallow weather-layer wind, and a deep flow that is decoupled from the\nflow above it. The upper flow is based on the observed cloud-level flow and is\nset to decay with depth. The deep flow is constructed to produce cylindrical\nstructures with variable width and magnitude, thus allowing for a wide range of\npossible scenarios for the unknown deep flow. The combined flow is then related\nto the density anomalies and gravitational moments via a dynamical model. An\nadjoint inverse model is used for optimizing the parameters controlling the\nsetup of the deep and surface-bound flows, so that these flows can be\nreconstructed given a gravity field. We show that the model can be used for\nexamination of various scenarios, including cases in which the deep flow is\ndominating over the surface wind. We discuss extensively the uncertainties\nassociated with the model solution. The flexibility of the adjoint method\nallows for a wide range of dynamical setups, so that when new observations and\nphysical understanding will arise, these constraints could be easily\nimplemented and used to better decipher Jupiter flow dynamics.\n", "  Cosmic shear is sensitive to fluctuations in the cosmological matter density\nfield, including on small physical scales, where matter clustering is affected\nby baryonic physics in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as star formation,\nsupernovae feedback and AGN feedback. While muddying any cosmological\ninformation that is contained in small scale cosmic shear measurements, this\ndoes mean that cosmic shear has the potential to constrain baryonic physics and\ngalaxy formation. We perform an analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES)\nScience Verification (SV) cosmic shear measurements, now extended to smaller\nscales, and using the Mead et al. 2015 halo model to account for baryonic\nfeedback. While the SV data has limited statistical power, we demonstrate using\na simulated likelihood analysis that the final DES data will have the\nstatistical power to differentiate among baryonic feedback scenarios. We also\nexplore some of the difficulties in interpreting the small scales in cosmic\nshear measurements, presenting estimates of the size of several other\nsystematic effects that make inference from small scales difficult, including\nuncertainty in the modelling of intrinsic alignment on nonlinear scales,\n`lensing bias', and shape measurement selection effects. For the latter two, we\nmake use of novel image simulations. While future cosmic shear datasets have\nthe statistical power to constrain baryonic feedback scenarios, there are\nseveral systematic effects that require improved treatments, in order to make\nrobust conclusions about baryonic feedback.\n", "  Using pulsed photoionization the coherent spin manipulation and echo\nformation of ensembles of NV- centers in diamond are detected electrically\nrealizing contrasts of up to 17 %. The underlying spin-dependent ionization\ndynamics are investigated experimentally and compared to Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. This allows the identification of the conditions optimizing\ncontrast and sensitivity which compare favorably with respect to optical\ndetection.\n", "  Cosmic rays (CRs) have recently re-emerged as attractive candidates for\nmediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,\nbut not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical\nevolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant\ndiffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes.\n", "  It has been found that surface operators have a significant role in AGT\nrelation. This duality is an outstanding consequence of M-theory, but it is\nactually encoded into the brane web for which the topological string can work.\nFrom this viewpoint, the surface defect in AGT relation is geometrically\nengineered as a toric brane realization. Also, there is a class of the brane\nconfiguration in M-theory called M-strings which can be translated into the\nlanguage of the topological string. In this work, we propose a new M-string\nconfiguration which can realize AGT relation in the presence of the surface\ndefect by utilizing the geometric transition in the refined topological string.\n", "  The long-standing problem of whether the cosmological constant affects\ndirectly the deflection of light caused by a gravitational lens is\nreconsidered. We use a new approach based on the Hawking quasilocal mass of a\nsphere grazed by light rays and on its splitting into local and cosmological\nparts. Previous literature restricted to the cosmological constant is extended\nto any form of dark energy accelerating the universe in which the gravitational\nlens is embedded.\n", "  We present 2D hydrodynamical simulations for the evolution of early-type\ngalaxies containing central massive black holes (MBHs), starting at age 2 Gyr.\nThe code contains accurate and physically consistent radiative and mechanical\nAGN wind feedback, with parsec-scale central resolution. Mass input comes from\nstellar evolution; energy input includes Type Ia and II supernova and stellar\nheating; star-formation is included. Realistic, axisymmetric dynamical models\nfor the galaxies are built solving the Jeans' equations. The lowest mass models\n(Mstar = 8 10^{10}Msun) develop global outflows sustained by SNIa's heating,\nending with a significantly lower amount of hot gas and new stars. In more\nmassive models, nuclear outbursts last to the present epoch, with large and\nfrequent fluctuations in nuclear emission and from the gas (Lx). Each burst\nlast ~ 10^{7.5} yr, during which (for r < 2-3 kpc) cold, inflowing, and hot,\noutflowing gas phases coexist. The Lx-T relation for the gas matches that of\nlocal galaxies. AGN activity causes positive feedback for star formation.\nRoughly half of the total mass loss is recycled into new stars (DeltaMstar),\njust ~ 3% of it is accreted on the MBH, the remainder being ejected from the\ngalaxy. The ratio between the mass of gas expelled to that in to new stars, the\nload factor, is ~0.6. Rounder galaxies shapes lead to larger final MBH masses,\nDeltaMstar, and Lx. Almost all the time is spent at very low nuclear\nluminosities, yet one quarter of the total energy is emitted at an Eddington\nratio > 0.1. The duty-cycle of AGN activity approximates 4% (Abridged).\n", "  One of the goals of the present paper is to propose an elementary method to\nfind a general formula for the Fourier transform containing a pair of complex\ngamma functions with a monomial sm in terms of Gauss's hypergeometric functions\n2F1. We further collect some mathematical results that follow by means of this\ntransform. Physical applications requiring the expectation values of position\nand momentum operators for a quantum system endowed with position-dependent\neffective mass are presented.\n", "  We investigate the contribution of major mergers (mass ratios $>1:5$) to\nstellar mass growth and morphological transformations around the epoch of peak\ncosmic star formation ($z\\sim2$). We visually classify a complete sample of\nmassive (M $>$ 10$^{10}$M$_{\\odot}$) galaxies at this epoch, drawn from the\nCANDELS survey, into late-type galaxies, major mergers, spheroids and disturbed\nspheroids which show morphological disturbances. Given recent simulation work,\nwhich indicates that recent ($<$0.3-0.4 Gyr) major-merger remnants exhibit\nclear tidal features in such images, we use the fraction of disturbed spheroids\nto probe the role of major mergers in driving morphological transformations.\nThe percentage of blue spheroids (i.e. with ongoing star formation) that show\nmorphological disturbances is only 21 $\\pm$ 4%, indicating that major mergers\nare not the dominant mechanism for spheroid creation at $z\\sim2$ - other\nprocesses, such as minor mergers or cold accretion are likely to be the main\ndrivers of this process. We also use the rest-frame U-band luminosity as a\nproxy for star formation to show that only a small fraction of the star\nformation budget ($\\sim$3%) is triggered by major mergers. Taken together, our\nresults show that major mergers are not significant drivers of galaxy evolution\nat $z\\sim2$.\n", "  We present experimental data and associated theory for correlations in a\nseries of experiments involving repeated Landau-Zener sweeps through the\ncrossing point of a singlet state and a spin aligned triplet state in a GaAs\ndouble quantum dot containing two conduction electrons, which are loaded in the\nsinglet state before each sweep, and the final spin is recorded after each\nsweep. The experiments reported here measure correlations on time scales from 4\n$\\mu$s to 2 ms. When the magnetic field is aligned in a direction such that\nspin-orbit coupling cannot cause spin flips, the correlation spectrum has\nprominent peaks centered at zero frequency and at the differences of the Larmor\nfrequencies of the nuclei, on top of a frequency-independent background. When\nthe spin-orbit field is relevant, there are additional peaks, centered at the\nfrequencies of the individual species. A theoretical model which neglects the\neffects of high-frequency charge noise correctly predicts the positions of the\nobserved peaks, and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the size of the\nfrequency-independent background, but gives peak areas that are larger than the\nobserved areas by a factor of two or more. The observed peak widths are roughly\nconsistent with predictions based on nuclear dephasing times of the order of 60\n$\\mu$s. However, there is extra weight at the lowest observed frequencies,\nwhich suggests the existence of residual correlations on the scale of 2 ms. We\nspeculate on the source of these discrepancies.\n", "  One way to diagnose chaos in bipartite unitary channels is via the tripartite\ninformation of the corresponding Choi state, which for certain choices of the\nsubsystems reduces to the negative conditional mutual information (CMI). We\nstudy this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify\nits role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the\nchannel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between\nindividual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does\nnot imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply\na type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs. When the CMI is\nmaximal, we find that the residual channel from an individual input to an\nindividual output is completely depolarizing when the other input is maximally\nmixed. However, we again find that this result is not robust. We also extend\nsome of these results to the multipartite case and to the case of Haar-random\npure input states. Finally, we look at the relationship between tripartite\ninformation and its Renyi-2 version which is directly related to\nout-of-time-order correlation functions. In particular, we demonstrate an\narbitrarily large gap between the two quantities.\n", "  The von Neumann entanglement entropy is used to estimate the critical point\n$h_c/J \\simeq 0.143(3)$ of the mixed ferro-antiferromagnetic three-state\nquantum Potts model $H = \\sum_i [ J ( X_i X_{i+1}^{\\,2} + X_i^{\\,2} X_{i+1} ) -\nh\\, R_i ]$, where $X_i$ and $R_i$ are standard three-state Potts spin operators\nand $J>0$ is the antiferromagnetic coupling parameter. This critical point\nvalue gives improved estimates for two Kosterlitz-Thouless transition points in\nthe antiferromagnetic ($\\beta < 0$) region of the $\\Delta$--$\\beta$ phase\ndiagram of the three-state quantum chiral clock model, where $\\Delta$ and\n$\\beta$ are, respectively, the chirality and coupling parameters in the clock\nmodel. These are the transition points $\\beta_c \\simeq - 0.143(3)$ at $\\Delta =\n\\frac12$ between incommensurate and commensurate phases and $\\beta_c \\simeq -\n7.0(1)$ at $\\Delta = 0$ between disordered and incommensurate phases. The von\nNeumann entropy is also used to calculate the central charge $c$ of the\nunderlying conformal field theory in the massless phase $h \\le h_c$. The\nestimate $c \\simeq 1$ in this phase is consistent with the known exact value at\nthe particular point $h/J = -1$ corresponding to the purely antiferromagnetic\nthree-state quantum Potts model. The algebraic decay of the Potts spin-spin\ncorrelation in the massless phase is used to estimate the continuously varying\ncritical exponent $\\eta$.\n", "  Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories are of recent interest to the condensed matter\ncommunity, in part because they represent topological phases of matter, but\nalso because they characterize the response theory of certain symmetry\nprotected topological (SPT) phases. However, as yet there has not been a\ncomprehensive treatment of the spectra of these models in the field theoretic\nsetting -- the goal of this work is to fill the gap in the literature, at least\nfor a selection of DW models with abelian gauge groups but non-abelian\ntopological order. As applications, various correlation functions and fusion\nrules of line operators are calculated. We discuss for example the appearance\nof non-abelian statistics in DW theories with abelian gauge groups.\n", "  Thermalized fireballs should be created by cusp events on superconducting\ncosmic strings. This simple notion allows to reliably estimate particle\nemission from the cusps in a given background magnetic field. With plausible\nassumptions about intergalactic magnetic fields, the cusp events can produce\nobservable fluxes of high-energy photons and neutrinos with unique signatures.\n", "  Despite great efforts, an unambiguous demonstration of entanglement of mobile\nelectrons in solid state conductors is still lacking. Investigating\ntheoretically a generic entangler-detector setup, we here show that a witness\nof entanglement between two flying electron qubits can be constructed from only\ntwo current cross correlation measurements, for any nonzero detector\nefficiencies and non-collinear polarization vectors. We find that all entangled\npure states, but not all mixed ones, can be detected with only two\nmeasurements, except the maximally entangled states, which require three.\nMoreover, detector settings for optimal entanglement witnessing are presented.\n", "  The curvature inhomogeneities are systematically scrutinized in the framework\nof the Glauber approach. The amplified quantum fluctuations of the scalar and\ntensor modes of the geometry are shown to be first-order coherent while the\ninterference of the corresponding intensities is larger than in the case of\nBose-Einstein correlations. After showing that the degree of second-order\ncoherence does not suffice to characterize unambiguously the curvature\ninhomogeneities, we argue that direct analyses of the degrees of third and\nfourth-order coherence are necessary to discriminate between different\ncorrelated states and to infer more reliably the statistical properties of the\nlarge-scale fluctuations. We speculate that the moments of the multiplicity\ndistributions of the relic phonons might be observationally accessible thanks\nto new generations of instruments able to count the single photons of the\nCosmic Microwave Background in the THz region.\n", "  We present results from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on\nthe identification, selection biases, and host galaxy properties of 55 X-ray,\nIR and optically-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $1.4 < z < 3.8$. We\nobtain rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies and AGN and use the BPT diagram\nto identify optical AGN. We examine the uniqueness and overlap of the AGN\nidentified at different wavelengths. There is a strong bias against identifying\nAGN at any wavelength in low mass galaxies, and an additional bias against\nidentifying IR AGN in the most massive galaxies. AGN hosts span a wide range of\nstar formation rate (SFR), similar to inactive galaxies once stellar mass\nselection effects are accounted for. However, we find (at $\\sim 2-3\\sigma$\nsignificance) that IR AGN are in less dusty galaxies with relatively higher SFR\nand optical AGN in dusty galaxies with relatively lower SFR. X-ray AGN\nselection does not display a bias with host galaxy SFR. These results are\nconsistent with those from larger studies at lower redshifts. Within\nstar-forming galaxies, once selection biases are accounted for, we find AGN in\ngalaxies with similar physical properties as inactive galaxies, with no\nevidence for AGN activity in particular types of galaxies. This is consistent\nwith AGN being fueled stochastically in any star-forming host galaxy. We do not\ndetect a significant correlation between SFR and AGN luminosity for individual\nAGN hosts, which may indicate the timescale difference between the growth of\ngalaxies and their supermassive black holes.\n", "  Strong Alfv\\'enic turbulence develops eddy-like motions perpendicular to the\nlocal direction of magnetic fields. This local alignment induces velocity\ngradients perpendicular to the local direction of the magnetic field. We use\nthis fact to propose a new technique of studying the direction of magnetic\nfields from observations, the Velocity Gradient Technique. We test our idea by\nemploying the synthetic observations obtained via 3D MHD numerical simulations\nfor different sonic and Alfv\\'en Mach numbers. We calculate the velocity\ngradient, $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$, using the velocity centroids. We find that\n$\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ traces the projected magnetic field best for the synthetic\nmaps obtained with sub-Alfv\\'enic simulations providing good point-wise\ncorrespondence between the magnetic field direction and that of\n$\\mathbf{\\Omega}$. The reported alignment is much better than the alignment\nbetween the density gradients and the magnetic field and we demonstrated that\nit can be used to find the magnetic field strength using the\nChandrasekhar-Fermi method. Our study opens a new way of studying magnetic\nfields using spectroscopic data.\n", "  The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) is a proposed constraint on theories with\ngauge fields and gravity, requiring the existence of light charged particles\nand/or imposing an upper bound on the field theory cutoff $\\Lambda$. If taken\nas a consistency requirement for effective field theories (EFTs), it rules out\npossibilities for model-building including some models of inflation. I\ndemonstrate simple models which satisfy all forms of the WGC, but which through\nHiggsing of the original gauge fields produce low-energy EFTs with gauge forces\nthat badly violate the WGC. These models illustrate specific loopholes in\narguments that motivate the WGC from a bottom-up perspective; for example the\narguments based on magnetic monopoles are evaded when the magnetic confinement\nthat occurs in a Higgs phase is accounted for. This indicates that the WGC\nshould not be taken as a veto on EFTs, even if it turns out to be a robust\nproperty of UV quantum gravity theories. However, if the latter is true then\nparametric violation of the WGC at low energy comes at the cost of non-minimal\nfield content in the UV. I propose that only a very weak constraint is\napplicable to EFTs, $\\Lambda \\lesssim \\left(-\\log g \\right)^{-1/2} M_\\text{pl}$\nwhere $g$ is the gauge coupling, motivated by entropy bounds. Remarkably, EFTs\nproduced by Higgsing a theory that satisfies the WGC can saturate but not\nviolate this bound.\n", "  We report new constraints on the size of large extra dimensions from data\ncollected by the MINOS experiment between 2005 and 2012. Our analysis employs a\nmodel in which sterile neutrinos arise as Kaluza-Klein states in large extra\ndimensions and thus modify the neutrino oscillation probabilities due to mixing\nbetween active and sterile neutrino states. Using Fermilab's NuMI beam exposure\nof $10.56 \\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target, we combine muon neutrino charged\ncurrent and neutral current data sets from the Near and Far Detectors and\nobserve no evidence for deviations from standard three-flavor neutrino\noscillations. The ratios of reconstructed energy spectra in the two detectors\nconstrain the size of large extra dimensions to be smaller than\n$0.45\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ at 90% C.L. in the limit of a vanishing lightest active\nneutrino mass. Stronger limits are obtained for non-vanishing masses.\n", "  We study a possible superconductivity in quasiperiodic systems, by portraying\nthe issue within the attractive Hubbard model on a Penrose lattice. Applying a\nreal-space dynamical mean-field theory to the model consisting of 4181 sites,\nwe find a superconducting phase at low temperatures. Reflecting the\nnonperiodicity of the Penrose lattice, the superconducting state exhibits an\ninhomogeneity. According to the type of the inhomogeneity, the superconducting\nphase is categorized into three different regions which cross over each other.\nAmong them, the weak-coupling region exhibits spatially extended Cooper pairs,\nwhich are nevertheless distinct from the conventional pairing of two electrons\nwith opposite momenta.\n", "  In this paper we study a suitable limit of integrable QFT with the aim to\nidentify continuous non-relativistic integrable models with local interactions.\nThis limit amounts to sending to infinity the speed of light c but\nsimultaneously adjusting the coupling constant g of the quantum field theories\nin such a way to keep finite the energies of the various excitations. The QFT\nconsidered here are Toda Field Theories and the O(N) non-linear sigma model. In\nboth cases the resulting non-relativistic integrable models consist only of\nLieb-Liniger models, which are fully decoupled for the Toda theories while\nsymmetrically coupled for the O(N) model. These examples provide explicit\nevidence of the universality and ubiquity of the Lieb-Liniger models and, at\nthe same time, suggest that these models may exhaust the list of possible\nnon-relativistic integrable theories of bosonic particles with local\ninteractions.\n", "  We compare the velocity dispersion of the intracluster medium (ICM) of the\nPerseus cluster of galaxies as observed by the Hitomi X-ray telescope to our\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jet-inflated bubbles in cluster\ncooling flows, and conclude that the observations support the mixing-heating\nmechanism of the ICM. In the mixing-heating mechanism the ICM is heated by\nmixing of hot bubble gas with the ICM. This mixing is caused by vortices that\nare formed during the inflation process of the bubble. Sound waves and\nturbulence are also excited by the vortices, but they contribute less than 20\nper cents to the heating of the ICM. Shocks that are excited by the jets\ncontribute even less.\n", "  The competition among superconductivity, stripe-type magnetic order, and a\nnew type of $C_4$ symmetric magnetic order in $\\mathrm{Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2}$ is\ntheoretically studied, focusing on its impact on the global phase diagram. By\ncarrying out a renormalization group analysis of an effective field theory, we\nobtain the energy-scale dependent flows of all the model parameters, and then\napply the results to understand the observed phase diagram. On the basis of the\nrenormalization group analysis, we show that the critical line of nematic order\nhas a negative slope in the superconducting dome and superconductivity is\nsuppressed near the magnetic quantum critical point, which are both consistent\nwith recent experiments. Moreover, we find that, although the observed $C_4$\nsymmetric magnetic state could be a charge-spin density wave or a spin-vortex\ncrystal at high temperatures, charge-spin density wave is the only stable $C_4$\nmagnetic state in the low-temperature regime. Therefore, ordering competition\nprovides a method to distinguish these two candidate $C_4$ magnetic states.\n", "  We present a method for the precise determination of the full elasticity\ntensor from a single crystal diffraction experiment using monochromatic X-rays.\nFor the two benchmark systems calcite and magnesium oxide we show that the\nmeasurement of thermal diffuse scattering in the proximity of Bragg reflections\nprovides accurate values of the complete set of elastic constants. This\napproach allows for a reliable and model free determination of the elastic\nproperties and can be performed together with crystal structure investigation\nin the same experiment.\n", "  We describe methods using frequency combs and optical resonators for\nrecording two-dimensional (2D) ultrafast spectroscopy signals with high\nsensitivity. By coupling multiple frequency combs to higher-order modes of one\nor more optical cavities, background-free, cavity-enhanced 2D spectroscopy\nsignals are naturally generated via phase cycling. As in cavity-enhanced\nultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (CE-TAS), the signal to noise is\nenhanced by a factor proportional to the cavity finesse squared, so even using\ncavities of modest finesse, a very high sensitivity is expected, enabling\nultrafast 2D spectroscopy experiments in dilute molecular beams.\n", "  The recent advanced LIGO detections of gravitational waves from merging\nbinary black holes enhance the prospect of exploring binary evolution via\ngravitational-wave observations of a population of compact-object binaries. In\nthe face of uncertainty about binary formation models, model-independent\ninference provides an appealing alternative to comparisons between observed and\nmodelled populations. We describe a procedure for clustering in the\nmulti-dimensional parameter space of observations that are subject to\nsignificant measurement errors. We apply this procedure to a mock data set of\npopulation-synthesis predictions for the masses of merging compact binaries\nconvolved with realistic measurement uncertainties, and demonstrate that we can\naccurately distinguish subpopulations of binary neutron stars, binary black\nholes, and mixed neutron star -- black hole binaries with tens of observations.\n", "  Quantum generalizations of Renyi's entropies are a useful tool to describe a\nvariety of operational tasks in quantum information processing. Two families of\nsuch generalizations turn out to be particularly useful: the Petz quantum Renyi\ndivergence $\\bar{D}_{\\alpha}$ and the minimal quantum Renyi divergence\n$\\tilde{D}_{\\alpha}$. In this paper, we prove a reverse Araki-Lieb-Thirring\ninequality that implies a new relation between these two families of\ndivergences, namely that $\\alpha \\bar{D}_{\\alpha}(\\rho \\| \\sigma) \\leq\n\\tilde{D}_{\\alpha}(\\rho \\| \\sigma)$ for $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ and where $\\rho$ and\n$\\sigma$ are density operators. This bound suggests defining a \"pretty good\nfidelity\", whose relation to the usual fidelity implies the known relations\nbetween the optimal and pretty good measurement as well as the optimal and\npretty good singlet fraction. We also find a new necessary and sufficient\ncondition for optimality of the pretty good measurement and singlet fraction.\n", "  Spins bound to point defects are increasingly viewed as an important resource\nfor solid-state implementations of quantum information technologies. In\nparticular, there is a growing interest in the identification of new classes of\ndefect spin that can be controlled optically. Here we demonstrate ensemble\noptical spin polarization and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of\nthe S = 1 electronic ground state of chromium (Cr4+) impurities in silicon\ncarbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN). Spin polarization is made possible by\nthe narrow optical linewidths of these ensembles (< 8.5 GHz), which are similar\nin magnitude to the ground state zero-field spin splitting energies of the ions\nat liquid helium temperatures. We therefore are able to optically resolve\nindividual spin sublevels within the ensembles at low magnetic fields using\nresonant excitation from a cavity-stabilized, narrow-linewidth laser.\nAdditionally, these near-infrared emitters possess exceptionally weak phonon\nsidebands, ensuring that > 73% of the overall optical emission is contained\nwith the defects zero-phonon lines. These characteristics make this\nsemiconductor-based, transition metal impurity system a promising target for\nfurther study in the ongoing effort to integrate optically active quantum\nstates within common optoelectronic materials.\n", "  We show that the merger and tidal disruption of a C/O white dwarf (WD) by a\nneutron star (NS) binary companion provides a natural formation scenario for\nthe PSR B1257+12 planetary system. Starting with initial conditions for the\ndebris disk produced of the disrupted WD, we model its long term viscous\nevolution, including for the first time the effects of mass and angular\nmomentum loss during the early radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)\nphase and accounting for the unusual C/O composition on the disk opacity. For\nplausible values of the disk viscosity $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ and the\nRIAF mass loss efficiency, we find that the disk mass remaining near the planet\nformation radius at the time of solid condensation is sufficient to explain the\npulsar planets. Rapid rocky planet formation via gravitational instability of\nthe solid carbon-dominated disk is facilitated by the suppression of vertical\nshear instabilities due to the high solid-to-gas ratio. Additional evidence\nsupporting a WD-NS merger scenario includes (1) the low observed occurrence\nrate of pulsar planets ($\\lesssim 1\\%$ of NS birth), comparable to the expected\nWD-NS merger rate; (2) accretion by the NS during the RIAF phase is sufficient\nto spin PSR B1257+12 up to its observed 6 ms period; (3) similar models of `low\nangular momentum' disks, such as those produced from supernova fallback, find\ninsufficient mass reaching the planet formation radius. The unusually high\nspace velocity of PSR B1257+12 of $\\gtrsim 326\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ suggests a\npossible connection to the Calcium-rich transients, dim supernovae which occur\nin the outskirts of their host galaxies and were proposed to result from\nmergers of WD-NS binaries receiving SN kicks. The C/O disk composition implied\nby our model likely results in carbon-rich planets with diamond interiors.\n", "  We quantitatively investigate the possibility of detecting baryonic acoustic\noscillations (BAO) using single-dish 21cm intensity mapping observations in the\npost-reionization era. We show that the telescope beam smears out the isotropic\nBAO signature and, in the case of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instrument,\nmakes it undetectable at redshifts $z\\gtrsim1$. We however demonstrate that the\nBAO peak can still be detected in the radial 21cm power spectrum and describe a\nmethod to make this type of measurements. By means of numerical simulations,\ncontaining the 21cm cosmological signal as well as the most relevant Galactic\nand extra-Galactic foregrounds and basic instrumental effect, we quantify the\nprecision with which the radial BAO scale can be measured in the 21cm power\nspectrum. We systematically investigate the signal-to-noise and the precision\nof the recovered BAO signal as a function of cosmic variance, instrumental\nnoise, angular resolution and foreground contamination. We find that the\nexpected noise levels of SKA would degrade the final BAO errors by $\\sim5\\%$\nwith respect to the cosmic-variance limited case at low redshifts, but that the\neffect grows up to $\\sim65\\%$ at $z\\sim2-3$. Furthermore, we find that the\nradial BAO signature is robust against foreground systematics, and that the\nmain effect is an increase of $\\sim20\\%$ in the final uncertainty on the\nstandard ruler caused by the contribution of foreground residuals as well as\nthe reduction in sky area needed to avoid high-foreground regions. We also find\nthat it should be possible to detect the radial BAO signature with high\nsignificance in the full redshift range. We conclude that a 21cm experiment\ncarried out by the SKA should be able to make direct measurements of the\nexpansion rate $H(z)$ with competitive per-cent level precision on redshifts\n$z\\lesssim2.5$.\n", "  Height fluctuations of growing surfaces can be characterized by the\nprobability distribution of height in a spatial point at a finite time.\nRecently there has been spectacular progress in the studies of this quantity\nfor the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in $1+1$ dimensions. Here we notice\nthat, at or above a critical dimension, the finite-time one-point height\ndistribution is ill-defined in a broad class of linear surface growth models,\nunless the model is regularized at small scales. The regularization via a\nsystem-dependent small-scale cutoff leads to a partial loss of universality. As\na possible alternative, we introduce a \\emph{local average height}. For the\nlinear models the probability density of this quantity is well-defined in any\ndimension. The weak-noise theory (WNT) for these models yields the \"optimal\npath\" of the interface conditioned on a non-equilibrium fluctuation of the\nlocal average height. As an illustration, we consider the conserved\nEdwards-Wilkinson (EW) equation, where, without regularization, the finite-time\none-point height distribution is ill-defined in all physical dimensions. We\nalso determine the optimal path of the interface in a closely related problem\nof the finite-time \\emph{height-difference} distribution for the non-conserved\nEW equation in $1+1$ dimension. Finally, we discuss a UV catastrophe in the\nfinite-time one-point distribution of height in the (non-regularized) KPZ\nequation in $2+1$ dimensions.\n", "  We study the structure of loops in networks using the notion of modulus of\nloop families. We introduce a new measure of network clustering by quantifying\nthe richness of families of (simple) loops. Modulus tries to minimize the\nexpected overlap among loops by spreading the expected link-usage optimally. We\npropose weighting networks using these expected link-usages to improve\nclassical community detection algorithms. We show that the proposed method\nenhances the performance of certain algorithms, such as spectral partitioning\nand modularity maximization heuristics, on standard benchmarks.\n", "  Machine learning methods incorporating deep neural networks have been the\nsubject of recent proposals for new hadronic resonance taggers. These methods\nrequire training on a dataset produced by an event generator where the true\nclass labels are known. However, training a network on a specific event\ngenerator may bias the network towards learning features associated with the\napproximations to QCD used in that generator which are not present in real\ndata. We therefore investigate the effects of variations in the modelling of\nthe parton shower on the performance of deep neural network taggers using jet\nimages from hadronic W-bosons at the LHC, including detector-related effects.\nBy investigating network performance on samples from the Pythia, Herwig and\nSherpa generators, we find differences of up to fifty percent in background\nrejection for fixed signal efficiency. We also introduce and study a method,\nwhich we dub zooming, for implementing scale-invariance in neural network-based\ntaggers. We find that this leads to an improvement in performance across a wide\nrange of jet transverse momenta. Our results emphasise the importance gaining a\ndetailed understanding what aspects of jet physics these methods are\nexploiting.\n", "  We report the detection of a GeV $\\gamma$-ray source which is spatially\noverlapping and thus very likely associated with the unidentified\nvery-high-energy (VHE) $\\gamma$-ray source HESS J1427-608 with the Pass 8 data\nrecorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The photon spectrum of this source\nis best described by a power-law with an index of $1.85\\pm0.17$ in the energy\nrange of $3-500$ GeV, and the measured flux connects smoothly with that of HESS\nJ1427-608 at a few hundred GeV. This source shows no significant extension and\ntime variation. The broadband GeV-TeV emission over four decades of energies\ncan be well fitted by a single power-law function with an index of 2.0, without\nobvious indication of spectral cutoff toward high energies. Such a result\nimplies that HESS J1427-608 may be a PeV particle accelerator. We discuss\npossible nature of HESS J1427-608 according to the multi-wavelength spectral\nfittings. Given the relatively large errors, either a leptonic or a hadronic\nmodel can explain the multi-wavelength data from radio to VHE $\\gamma$-rays.\nThe inferred magnetic field strength is a few $\\mu$G, which is smaller than\ntypical values of supernova remnants (SNRs), and is consistent with some pulsar\nwind nebulae (PWNe). On the other hand, the flat $\\gamma$-ray spectrum is\nslightly different from typical PWNe but similar to that of some known SNRs.\n", "  We compare 5 sub-grid models for supernova (SN) feedback in adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR) simulations of isolated dwarf and L-star disk galaxies with\n20-40 pc resolution. The models are thermal dump, stochastic thermal,\n'mechanical' (injecting energy or momentum depending on the resolution),\nkinetic, and delayed cooling feedback. We focus on the ability of each model to\nsuppress star formation and generate outflows. Our highest-resolution runs\nmarginally resolve the adiabatic phase of the feedback events, which correspond\nto 40 SN explosions, and the first three models yield nearly identical results,\npossibly indicating that kinetic and delayed cooling feedback converge to wrong\nresults. At lower resolution all models differ, with thermal dump feedback\nbecoming inefficient. Thermal dump, stochastic, and mechanical feedback\ngenerate multiphase outflows with mass loading factors $\\beta \\ll 1$, which is\nmuch lower than observed. For the case of stochastic feedback we compare to\npublished SPH simulations, and find much lower outflow rates. Kinetic feedback\nyields fast, hot outflows with $\\beta\\sim 1$, but only if the wind is in effect\nhydrodynamically decoupled from the disk by using a large bubble radius.\nDelayed cooling generates cold, dense and slow winds with $\\beta> 1$, but large\namounts of gas occupy regions of temperature-density space with short cooling\ntimes. We conclude that either our resolution is too low to warrant physically\nmotivated models for SN feedback, that feedback mechanisms other than SNe are\nimportant, or that other aspects of galaxy evolution, such as star formation,\nrequire better treatment.\n", "  We examine the baryon content of low-mass {\\Lambda}CDM halos\n$(10^8<M_{200}/{\\rm M_\\odot}<5\\times 10^{9})$ using the APOSTLE cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations. Most of these systems are free of stars and have a\ngaseous content set by the combined effects of cosmic reionization, which\nimposes a mass-dependent upper limit, and of ram pressure stripping, which\nreduces it further in high-density regions. Halos mainly affected by\nreionization (RELHICs; REionization-Limited HI Clouds) inhabit preferentially\nlow-density regions and make up a population where the gas is in hydrostatic\nequilibrium with the dark matter potential and in thermal equilibrium with the\nionizing UV background. Their thermodynamic properties are well specified, and\ntheir gas density and temperature profiles may be predicted in detail. Gas in\nRELHICs is nearly fully ionized but with neutral cores that span a large range\nof HI masses and column densities and have negligible non-thermal broadening.\nWe present predictions for their characteristic sizes and central column\ndensities: the massive tail of the distribution should be within reach of\nfuture blind HI surveys. Local Group RELHICs (LGRs) have some properties\nconsistent with observed Ultra Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs) but the\nsheer number of the latter suggests that most UCHVCs are not RELHICs. Our\nresults suggest that LGRs (i) should typically be beyond 500 kpc from the Milky\nWay or M31; (ii) have positive Galactocentric radial velocities; (iii) HI sizes\nnot exceeding 1 kpc, and (iv) should be nearly round. The detection and\ncharacterization of RELHICs would offer a unique probe of the small-scale\nclustering of cold dark matter.\n", "  We present zoom-in, AMR, high-resolution ($\\simeq 30$ pc) simulations of\nhigh-redshift ($z \\simeq 6$) galaxies with the aim of characterizing their\ninternal properties and interstellar medium. Among other features, we adopt a\nstar formation model based on a physically-sound molecular hydrogen\nprescription, and introduce a novel scheme for supernova feedback, stellar\nwinds and dust-mediated radiation pressure. In the zoom-in simulation the\ntarget halo hosts \"Dahlia\", a galaxy with a stellar mass $M_*=1.6\\times\n10^{10}$M$_\\odot$, representative of a typical $z\\sim 6$ Lyman Break Galaxy.\nDahlia has a total H2 mass of $10^{8.5}$M$_\\odot$, that is mainly concentrated\nin a disk-like structure of effective radius $\\simeq 0.6$ kpc and scale height\n$\\simeq 200$ pc. Frequent mergers drive fresh gas towards the center of the\ndisk, sustaining a star formation rate per unit area of $\\simeq 15 $M$_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. The disk is composed by dense ($n \\gtrsim 25$ cm$^{-3}$),\nmetal-rich ($Z \\simeq 0.5 $ Z$_\\odot$) gas, that is pressure-supported by\nradiation. We compute the $158\\mu$m [CII] emission arising from {Dahlia}, and\nfind that $\\simeq 95\\%$ of the total [CII] luminosity\n($L_{[CII]}\\simeq10^{7.5}$ L$_\\odot$) arises from the H2 disk. Although $30\\%$\nof the CII mass is transported out of the disk by outflows, such gas negligibly\ncontributes to [CII] emission, due to its low density ($n \\lesssim 10$\ncm$^{-3}$) and metallicity ($Z\\lesssim 10^{-1}$Z$_\\odot$). Dahlia is\nunder-luminous with respect to the local [CII]-SFR relation; however, its\nluminosity is consistent with upper limits derived for most $z\\sim6$ galaxies.\n", "  Using spatially resolved spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA we have demonstrated\nthat low ionisation emission line regions (LIERs) in local galaxies result from\nphotoionisation by hot evolved stars, not active galactic nuclei. LIERs are\nubiquitous in both quiescent galaxies and in the central regions of galaxies\nwhere star formation takes place at larger radii. We refer to these two classes\nof galaxies as extended LIER (eLIER) and central LIER (cLIER) galaxies\nrespectively. cLIERs are late type galaxies located around the green valley, in\nthe transition region between the star formation main sequence and quiescent\ngalaxies. These galaxies display regular disc rotation in both stars and gas,\nalthough featuring a higher central stellar velocity dispersion than star\nforming galaxies of the same mass. cLIERs are consistent with being slowly\nquenched inside-out; the transformation is associated with massive bulges,\npointing towards the importance of bulge growth via secular evolution. eLIERs\nare morphologically early types and are indistinguishable from passive galaxies\ndevoid of line emission in terms of their stellar populations, morphology and\ncentral stellar velocity dispersion. Ionised gas in eLIERs shows both disturbed\nand disc-like kinematics. When a large-scale flow/rotation is observed in the\ngas, it is often misaligned relative to the stellar component. These features\nindicate that eLIERs are passive galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas\ncomponent, acquired mostly via external accretion. Importantly, quiescent\ngalaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments and have\nsignificantly higher satellite fraction than eLIERs. Environmental effects thus\nrepresent the likely cause for the existence of line-less galaxies on the red\nsequence.\n", "  r-mode astroseismology provides a unique way to study the internal\ncomposition of compact stars. Due to their precise timing, recycled millisecond\nradio pulsars present a particularly promising class of sources. Although their\nthermal properties are still poorly constrained, X-ray data is very useful for\nastroseismology since r-modes could strongly heat a star. Using known and new\nupper bounds on the temperatures and luminosities of several non-accreting\nmillisecond radio pulsars we derive bounds on the r-mode amplitude as low as\n$\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-8}$ and discuss the impact on scenarios for their internal\ncomposition.\n", "  From a sample of spectra of 439 white dwarfs (WDs) from the ESO-VLT\nSupernova-Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY), we measure the maximal changes in\nradial-velocity (DRVmax) between epochs (generally two epochs, separated by up\nto 470d), and model the observed DRVmax statistics via Monte-Carlo simulations,\nto constrain the population characteristics of double WDs (DWDs). The DWD\nfraction among WDs is fbin=0.100+/-0.020 (1-sigma, random) +0.02 (systematic),\nin the separation range ~<4AU within which the data are sensitive to binarity.\nAssuming the distribution of binary separation, a, is a power-law, dN/da ~\na^alpha, at the end of the last common-envelope phase and the start of solely\ngravitational-wave-driven binary evolution, the constraint by the data is\nalpha=-1.3+/-0.2 (1-sigma) +/-0.2 (systematic). If these parameters extend to\nsmall separations, the implied Galactic WD merger rate per unit stellar mass is\nR_merge=(1-80)e-13 /yr/Msun (2-sigma), with a likelihood-weighted mean of\nR_merge=(7+/-2)e-13 /yr/Msun (1-sigma). The Milky Way's specific Type-Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) rate is likely R_Ia~1.1e-13 /yr/Msun and therefore, in terms\nof rates, a possibly small fraction of all merging DWDs (e.g. those with\nmassive-enough primary WDs) could suffice to produce most or all SNe Ia.\n", "  The observation of non-saturating classical linear magnetoresistivity has\nbeen an enigmatic phenomenon in solid state physics. We present a study of a\ntwo-dimensional ohmic conductor, including local Hall effect and a\nself-consistent consideration of the environment. An equivalent-circuit scheme\ndelivers a simple and convincing argument why the magnetoresistivity is linear\nin strong magnetic field, provided that current and biasing electric field are\nmisaligned by a nonlocal mechanism. A finite-element model of a two-dimensional\nconductor is suited to display the situations that create such deviating\ncurrents. Besides edge effects next to electrodes, charge carrier density\nfluctuations are efficiently generating this effect. However, mobility\nfluctuations that have frequently been related to linear magnetoresistivity are\nbarely relevant. Despite its rare observation, linear magnetoresitivity is\nrather the rule than the exception in a regime of low charge carrier densities,\nmisaligned current pathways and strong magnetic field.\n", "  The recent development of brand new observational techniques and theoretical\nmodels have greatly advanced the exoplanet research field. Despite significant\nachievements, which have allowed the detection of thousands extrasolar systems,\na comprehensive understanding of planetary formation and evolution mechanisms\nis still desired. One relevant limitation is given by the accuracy in the\nmeasurements of planet-host star ages. The star GJ 504 has been found to host a\nsubstellar companion whose nature is strongly debated. There has been a recent\ndifference of opinion in the literature owing to the uncertainty on the age of\nthe system: a young age of $\\sim$ 160 Myr would imply a giant planet as a\ncompanion, but a recent revision pointing to a solar age ($\\sim$ 4 Gyr) instead\nsuggests a brown dwarf. With the aim of shedding light on this debated topic,\nwe have carried out a high-resolution spectroscopic study of GJ 504 to derive\nstellar parameters, metallicity, and abundances of both light and heavy\nelements, providing a full chemical characterisation. The main objective is to\ninfer clues on the evolutionary stage (hence the age) of this system. We\nperformed a strictly differential (line-by-line) analysis of GJ 504 with\nrespect to two reference stars, that is the planet-host dwarf $\\iota$ Hor and\nthe subgiant HIP 84827. The former is crucial in this context because its\nstellar parameters (hence the evolutionary stage) is well constrained from\nasteroseismic observations. Regardless of the zero point offsets, our\ndifferential approach allows us to put tight constraints on the age of GJ 504\nwith respect to $\\iota$ Hor, thereby minimising the internal uncertainties. We\nfound that the surface gravity of GJ 504 is 0.2 $\\pm$ 0.07 dex lower than that\nof the main-sequence star $\\iota$ Hor, suggesting a past turn-off\nevolution[...]\n", "  We use a spherical model and an extended excursion set formalism with\ndrifting diffusive barriers to predict the abundance of cosmic voids in the\ncontext of general relativity as well as f(R) and symmetron models of modified\ngravity. We detect spherical voids from a suite of N-body simulations of these\ngravity theories and compare the measured void abundance to theory predictions.\nWe find that our model correctly describes the abundance of both dark matter\nand galaxy voids, providing a better fit than previous proposals in the\nliterature based on static barriers. We use the simulation abundance results to\nfit for the abundance model free parameters as a function of modified gravity\nparameters, and show that counts of dark matter voids can provide interesting\nconstraints on modified gravity. For galaxy voids, more closely related to\noptical observations, we find that constraining modified gravity from void\nabundance alone may be significantly more challenging. In the context of\ncurrent and upcoming galaxy surveys, the combination of void and halo\nstatistics including their abundances, profiles and correlations should be\neffective in distinguishing modified gravity models that display different\nscreening mechanisms.\n", "  Collective behaviour has been observed in hadronic measurements of high\nmultiplicity proton+lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), as well\nas in (proton, deuteron, helium-3)+gold collisions at the Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). To better understand the evolution dynamics and the\nproperties of the matter created in these small systems, a systematic study of\nthe soft hadronic observables together with electromagnetic radiation from\nthese collisions is performed, using a hydrodynamic framework. Quantitative\nagreement is found between theoretical calculations and existing experimental\nhadronic observables. The validity of the fluid dynamical description is\nestimated by calculating Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers. Sizeable thermal\nyields are predicted for low $p_T$ photons. Further predictions of higher order\ncharged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients and of thermal photon enhancement\nare proposed.\n", "  The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey is a massive\nobservational project to trace the Milky Way's history of star formation,\nchemical enrichment, stellar migration and minor mergers. Using high-resolution\n(R$\\simeq$28,000) spectra taken with the High Efficiency and Resolution\nMulti-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) instrument at the Anglo-Australian\nTelescope (AAT), GALAH will determine stellar parameters and abundances of up\nto 29 elements for up to one million stars. Selecting targets from a\ncolour-unbiased catalogue built from 2MASS, APASS and UCAC4 data, we expect to\nobserve dwarfs at 0.3 to 3 kpc and giants at 1 to 10 kpc. This enables a\nthorough local chemical inventory of the Galactic thin and thick disks, and\nalso captures smaller samples of the bulge and halo. In this paper we present\nthe plan, process and progress as of early 2016 for GALAH survey observations.\nIn our first two years of survey observing we have accumulated the largest\nhigh-quality spectroscopic data set at this resolution, over 200,000 stars. We\nalso present the first public GALAH data catalogue: stellar parameters (Teff,\nlog(g), [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe]), radial velocity, distance modulus and reddening\nfor 10680 observations of 9860 Tycho-2 stars that may be included in the first\nGaia data release.\n", "  Coarsening dynamics theory has successfully described the equilibration of a\nbroad class of systems.By studying the relaxation of a periodic array of\nmicrocondensates immersed in a Fermi gas which can mediate long-range spin\ninteractions to simulate frustrated classical magnets, we show that coarsening\ndynamics can be suppressed by geometrical frustration. The system is found to\neventually approach a metastable state which is robust against random field\nnoise and characterized by finite correlation lengths with the emergence of\ntopologically stable Z2 vortices. We find universal scaling laws with no\nthermal-equilibrium analog that relate the correlation lengths and the number\nof vortices to the degree of frustration in the system.\n", "  Data Release 5 (DR5) of the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) is the fifth\ndata release from a magnitude-limited (9< I < 12) survey of stars randomly\nselected in the southern hemisphere. The RAVE medium-resolution spectra\n($R\\sim7500$) covering the Ca-triplet region (8410-8795\\AA) span the complete\ntime frame from the start of RAVE observations in 2003 to their completion in\n2013. Radial velocities from 520,781 spectra of 457,588 unique stars are\npresented, of which 255,922 stellar observations have parallaxes and proper\nmotions from the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS) in Gaia DR1. For our\nmain DR5 catalog, stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity,\nand overall metallicity) are computed using the RAVE DR4 stellar pipeline, but\ncalibrated using recent K2 Campaign 1 seismic gravities and Gaia benchmark\nstars, as well as results obtained from high-resolution studies. Also included\nare temperatures from the Infrared Flux Method, and we provide a catalogue of\nred giant stars in the dereddened color $(J-Ks)_0$ interval (0.50,0.85) for\nwhich the gravities were calibrated based only on seismology. Further data\nproducts for sub-samples of the RAVE stars include individual abundances for\nMg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni, and distances found using isochrones. Each RAVE\nspectrum is complemented by an error spectrum, which has been used to determine\nuncertainties on the parameters. The data can be accessed via the RAVE Web site\nor the Vizier database.\n", "  Strong evidence for dual superconformal symmetry in $\\mathcal{N} = 6$\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory has fueled expectations that the AdS/CFT\ndual geometry $AdS_4 \\times \\mathbb{C} P^3$ is self-dual under T-duality. We\nrevisit the problem to identify commuting bosonic and fermionic isometries in a\nsystematic fashion and show that fermionic T-duality, a symmetry originally\nproposed by Berkovits & Maldacena, inevitably leads to a singularity in the\ndilaton transformation. We show that TsT deformations commute with fermionic\nT-duality and comment on T-duality in the corresponding sigma model. Our\nresults rule out self-duality based on fermionic T-duality for $AdS_4 \\times\n\\mathbb{C} P^3$ or its TsT deformations, but leave the door open for new\npossibilities.\n", "  We investigate the electronic properties of the three-dimensional\nstripyhoneycomb $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ via relativistic density functional\ntheory calculations as well as exact diagonalization of finite clusters and\nexplore the details of the optical conductivity. Our analysis of this quantity\nreveals the microscopic origin of the experimentally observed (i) optical\ntransitions and (ii) anisotropic behavior along the various polarization\ndirections. In particular we find that the optical excitations are overall\ndominated by transitions between $j_\\text{eff}$ = 1/2 and 3/2 states and the\nweight of transitions between $j_\\text{eff}$ = 1/2 states at low frequencies\ncan be correlated to deviations from a pure Kitaev description. We furthermore\nreanalyze within this approach the electronic excitations in the known\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb systems $\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ and Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and\ndiscuss the results in comparison to $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$.\n", "  Recent experiments have uncovered evidence of the strongly coupled nature of\nthe graphene: the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated by up to a factor of 20 near\nthe charge neutral point. We describe this strongly-coupled plasma by a\nholographic model in which there are two distinct conserved U(1) currents. We\nfind that our analytic results for the transport coefficients for two current\nmodel have a significantly improved match to the density dependence of the\nexperimental data than the models with only one current. The additive structure\nin the transports coefficients plays an important role. We also suggest the\norigin of the two currents.\n", "  We develop and validate a new model to study simultaneous erosion and\ndeposition in three-dimensional porous media. We study the changes of the\nporous structure induced by the deposition and erosion of matter on the solid\nsurface and find that when both processes are active, channelization in the\nporous structure always occurs. The channels can be stable or only temporary\ndepending mainly on the driving mechanism. Whereas a fluid driven by a constant\npressure drop in general does not form steady channels, imposing a constant\nflux always produces stable channels within the porous structure. Furthermore\nwe investigate how changes of the local deposition and erosion properties\naffect the final state of the porous structure, finding that the larger the\nrange of wall shear stress for which there is neither erosion nor deposition,\nthe more steady channels are formed in the structure.\n", "  Nearby galaxies host ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), whose nature\nremains largely unknown. Until the discovery of the first ULX pulsar, M82 X-2,\nthe mechanism powering the large luminosities of most ULXs was thought to be\nsuper-Eddington accretion onto black holes. The ULX pulsar clearly indicates\nthat this hypothesis is not universal, and the question arises if other ULXs\nare as well powered by accretion onto neutron stars. One possibility to have\nhighly super-Eddington luminosity is by reducing the opacity by strong magnetic\nfields as in magnetars, as proposed for M82 X-2. To study the link between ULXs\nand magnetar bursts/flares, we have performed a comparative spectral study\nbetween these classes, which both emit at similar super-Eddington luminosities\nat around $L \\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that, when their spectra are\nfitted with dual thermal models, the long term spectral variations of ULXs are\nsimilar to short term spectral variability seen during magnetar flares. In both\nclasses of sources the black body temperatures and radii follow similar\n$R_\\textrm{bb} \\propto T_\\textrm{bb}^{-2}$ trends, the only difference being\nthat the temperatures in ULXs are an order of magnitude lower and thus they\nhave much larger characteristic emission areas. Furthermore, the ratio between\nthe luminosities of the two black body components shows the same one-to-one\ndependence in ULXs and magnetars. We discuss the possible origins of these\nsimilarities, and speculate that the reason for the lack of pulsations in\n\"magnetar-ULXs\" could be that their photospheres are extended far beyond the\nneutron star surface.\n", "  We experimentally study the occurrence of spontaneous spinning (Quincke\nrotation) of an ellipsoid in a uniform DC electric field. For an ellipsoid\nsuspended in an unbounded fluid, we find two stable states characterized by the\norientation of the ellipsoid long axis relative to the applied electric field :\nspinless (parallel) and spinning (perpendicular). The phase diagram of\nellipsoid behavior as a function of field strength and aspect ratio is in close\nagreement with the theory of Cebers et al. Phys. Rev .E 63:016301 (2000). We\nalso investigated the dynamics of the ellipsoidal Quincke rotor resting on a\nplanar surface with normal perpendicular to the field direction. We find novel\nbehaviors, such as swinging (long axis oscillating around the applied field\ndirection) and tumbling, due to the confinement.\n", "  The emergence of a diverging length scale in many-body systems at a quantum\nphase transition implies that total entanglement has to reach its maximum\nthere. In order to fully characterize this, one has to consider multipartite\nentanglement as, for instance, bipartite entanglement between individual\nparticles fails to signal this effect. However, quantification of multipartite\nentanglement is very hard and detecting it may not be possible due to the lack\nof accessibility to all individual particles. For these reasons it will be more\nsensible to partition the system into relevant subsystems, each containing few\nto many spins, and study entanglement between those constituents as a\ncoarse-grain picture of multipartite entanglement between individual particles.\nIn impurity systems, famously exemplified by two-impurity and two-channel Kondo\nmodels, it is natural to divide the system into three parts, namely, impurities\nand the left and right bulks. By exploiting two tripartite entanglement\nmeasures, based on negativity, we show that at impurity quantum phase\ntransitions the tripartite entanglement diverges and shows scaling behavior.\nWhile the critical exponents are different for each tripartite entanglement\nmeasure they both provide very similar critical exponents for the two-impurity\nand the two-channel Kondo models suggesting that they belong to the same\nuniversality class.\n", "  Hot, Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs), selected from the WISE all sky\ninfrared survey, host some of the most powerful Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)\nknown, and might represent an important stage in the evolution of galaxies.\nMost known Hot DOGs are at $z> 1.5$, due in part to a strong bias against\nidentifying them at lower redshift related to the selection criteria. We\npresent a new selection method that identifies 153 Hot DOG candidates at $z\\sim\n1$, where they are significantly brighter and easier to study. We validate this\napproach by measuring a redshift $z=1.009$, and an SED similar to higher\nredshift Hot DOGs for one of these objects, WISE J1036+0449\n($L_{\\rm\\,Bol}\\simeq 8\\times 10^{46}\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$), using data from\nKeck/LRIS and NIRSPEC, SDSS, and CSO. We find evidence of a broadened component\nin MgII, which, if due to the gravitational potential of the supermassive black\nhole, would imply a black hole mass of $M_{\\rm\\,BH}\\simeq 2 \\times 10^8\nM_{\\odot}$, and an Eddington ratio of $\\lambda_{\\rm\\,Edd}\\simeq 2.7$. WISE\nJ1036+0449 is the first Hot DOG detected by NuSTAR, and the observations show\nthat the source is heavily obscured, with a column density of\n$N_{\\rm\\,H}\\simeq(2-15)\\times10^{23}\\rm\\,cm^{-2}$. The source has an intrinsic\n2-10 keV luminosity of $\\sim 6\\times 10^{44}\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$, a value\nsignificantly lower than that expected from the mid-infrared/X-ray correlation.\nWe also find that the other Hot DOGs observed by X-ray facilities show a\nsimilar deficiency of X-ray flux. We discuss the origin of the X-ray weakness\nand the absorption properties of Hot DOGs. Hot DOGs at $z\\lesssim1$ could be\nexcellent laboratories to probe the characteristics of the accretion flow and\nof the X-ray emitting plasma at extreme values of the Eddington ratio.\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model contain additional heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons that are coupled to heavy scalar top quarks (stops). This\nsystem exhibits interesting field theoretic phenomena when the Higgs mass is\nclose to the stop-antistop production threshold. Existing work in the\nliterature has examined the digluon-to-diphoton cross section near threshold\nand has focused on enhancements in the cross section that might arise either\nfrom the perturbative contributions to the Higgs-to-digluon and\nHiggs-to-diphoton form factors or from mixing of the Higgs boson with stoponium\nstates. Near threshold, enhancements in the relevant amplitudes that go as\ninverse powers of the stop-antistop relative velocity require resummations of\nperturbation theory and/or nonperturbative treatments. We present a complete\nformulation of threshold effects at leading order in the stop-antistop relative\nvelocity in terms of nonrelativistic effective field theory. We give detailed\nnumerical calculations for the case in which the stop-antistop Green's function\nis modeled with a Coulomb-Schr\\\"odinger Green's function. We find several\ngeneral effects that do not appear in a purely perturbative treatment.\nHiggs-stop-antistop mixing effects displace physical masses from the threshold\nregion, thereby rendering the perturbative threshold enhancements inoperative.\nIn the case of large Higgs-stop-antistop couplings, the displacement of a\nphysical state above threshold substantially increases its width, owing to its\ndecay width to a stop-antistop pair, and greatly reduces its contribution to\nthe cross section.\n", "  Optical frequency combs [1-8] have resulted in significant advances in\noptical frequency metrology and found wide application to precise physical\nmeasurements [1-4, 9] and molecular fingerprinting [8]. A direct analogue of\nfrequency combs in the phononic or acoustic domain has not been reported to\ndate. In this letter, we report the first clear experimental evidence for a\nphononic frequency comb. In contrast to the Kerr nonlinearity [10] in optical\nfrequency comb formation, the phononic frequency comb is generated through the\nintrinsic coupling of a driven phonon mode with an auto-parametrically excited\nsub-harmonic mode [16]. Through systematic experiments at different drive\nfrequencies and amplitudes, we portray the well-connected process of phononic\nfrequency comb formation and define attributes to control the features [17-18]\nassociated with comb formation in such a system. Further, the interplay between\nthese nonlinear resonances and the well-known Duffing phenomenon [12-14] is\nalso observed. The presented pathway for phononic frequency comb formation\nfinds general relevance to other nonlinear systems in both classical and\nquantum domains.\n", "  The enormous velocities of the so called hypervelocity stars (HVSs) derive,\nlikely, from close interactions with massive black holes, binary stars\nencounters or supernova explosions. In this paper, we investigate the origin of\nhypervelocity stars as consequence of the close interaction between the Milky\nWay central massive black hole and a passing-by young stellar cluster. We found\nthat both single and binary HVSs may be generated in a burst-like event, as the\ncluster passes near the orbital pericentre. High velocity stars will move close\nto the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster\norbital motion at the pericentre. The binary fraction of these HVS jets depends\non the primordial binary fraction in the young cluster. The level of initial\nmass segregation determines the value of the average mass of the ejected stars.\nSome binary stars will merge, continuing their travel across and out of the\nGalaxy as blue stragglers.\n", "  The recent discovery of the Lorentz symmetry-violating 'Type II' Weyl\nsemimetal phase has renewed interest in the study of Weyl physics in condensed\nmatter systems. However, tuning the exceptional properties of this novel state\nhas remained a challenge. Optical lattices, created using standing laser beams,\nprovide a convenient platform to tune tunnelling parameters continuously in\ntime. In this paper, we propose a generalised two level system exhibiting type\nII Weyl points that can be realised using ultra-cold atoms in an optical\nlattice. The system is engineered using a three-dimensional lattice with\ncomplex $\\pi$ phase tunnelling amplitudes. Various unique properties of the\ntype II Weyl semimetal such as open Fermi surface, anomalous chirality and\ntopological Fermi arcs can be probed using the proposed optical lattice scheme.\n", "  We explore the classical dynamics of two interacting rotating dipoles that\nare fixed in the space and exposed to an external homogeneous electric field.\nKinetic energy transfer mechanisms between the dipoles are investigated varying\nboth the amount of initial excess kinetic energy of one of them and the\nstrength of the electric field. In the field-free case, and depending on the\ninitial excess energy an abrupt transition between equipartition and\nnon-equipartition regimes is encountered. The study of the phase space\nstructure of the system as well as the formulation of the Hamiltonian in an\nappropriate coordinate frame provide a thorough understanding of this sharp\ntransition. When the electric field is turned on, the kinetic energy transfer\nmechanism is significantly more complex and the system goes through different\nregimes of equipartition and non-equipartition of the energy including chaotic\nbehavior.\n", "  Aims. High Synchrotron Peaked blazars (HSPs) dominate the -ray sky at\nenergies larger than a few GeV; however, only a few hundred blazars of this\ntype have been catalogued so far. In this paper we present the 2WHSP sample,\nthe largest and most complete list of HSP blazars available to date, which is\nan expansion of the 1WHSP catalog of gamma-ray source candidates off the\nGalactic plane.\n  Methods. We cross-matched a number of multi-wavelength surveys (in the radio,\ninfrared and X-ray bands) and applied selection criteria based on the radio to\nIR and IR to X-ray spectral slopes. To ensure the selection of genuine HSPs we\nexamined the SED of each candidate and estimated the peak frequency of its\nsynchrotron emission ($\\nu_{\\rm peak}$) using the ASDC SED tool, including only\nsources with Synchrotron peak $\\nu_{\\rm peak} > 10^{15}$ Hz (equivalent to\n$\\nu_{\\rm peak} > 4$ eV).\n  Results. We have assembled the largest and most complete catalog of HSP\nblazars to date, which includes 1691 sources. A number of population\nproperties, such as infrared colours, synchrotron peak, redshift distributions,\nand -ray spectral properties, have been used to characterise the sample and\nmaximize completeness. We also derived the radio logN-logS distribution. This\ncatalog has already been used to provide seeds to discover new very high energy\nobjects within Fermi-LAT data and to look for the counterparts of neutrino and\nultra high energy cosmic ray sources, showing its potential for the\nidentification of promising high-energy gamma-ray sources and multi-messenger\ntargets.\n", "  We introduce a new type of topological magnon matter: the magnonic pendant to\nelectronic nodal-line semimetals. Magnon spectra of anisotropic pyrochlore\nferromagnets feature twofold degeneracies of magnon bands along a closed loop\nin reciprocal space. These magnon nodal lines are topologically protected by\nthe coexistence of inversion and time-reversal symmetry; they require the\nabsence of spin-orbit interaction (no Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction). We\ncalculate the topological invariants of the nodal lines and show that details\nof the associated magnon drumhead surface states depend strongly on the\ntermination of the surface. Magnon nodal-line semimetals complete the family of\ntopological magnons in three-dimensional ferromagnetic materials.\n", "  The data taken by the advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors\ncontains short duration noise transients that limit the significance of\nastrophysical detections and reduce the duty cycle of the instruments. As the\nadvanced detectors are reaching sensitivity levels that allow for multiple\ndetections of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources it is crucial to achieve\na fast and accurate characterization of non-astrophysical transient noise\nshortly after it occurs in the detectors. Previously we presented three methods\nfor the classification of transient noise sources. They are Principal Component\nAnalysis for Transients (PCAT), Principal Component LALInference Burst (PC-LIB)\nand Wavelet Detection Filter with Machine Learning (WDF-ML). In this study we\ncarry out the first performance tests of these algorithms on gravitational-wave\ndata from the Advanced LIGO detectors. We use the data taken between the 3rd of\nJune 2015 and the 14th of June 2015 during the 7th engineering run (ER7), and\noutline the improvements made to increase the performance and lower the latency\nof the algorithms on real data. This work provides an important test for\nunderstanding the performance of these methods on real, non stationary data in\npreparation for the second advanced gravitational-wave detector observation\nrun, planned for later this year. We show that all methods can classify\ntransients in non stationary data with a high level of accuracy and show the\nbenefits of using multiple classifiers.\n", "  Recent optical studies of monolayer transition metal dechalcogenides have\ndemonstrated that their excitonic absorption feature splits into two widely\nseparated peaks at finite carrier densities. The additional peak is usually\nattributed to the presence of trions, bound states of two electrons and a hole\nor an electron and two holes. Here we argue that in the density range over\nwhich the trion peak is well resolved, it cannot be interpreted in terms of\nweakly coupled three-body systems, and that the appropriate picture is instead\none in which excitons are dressed by interactions with a Fermi sea of excess\ncarriers. This coupling splits the exciton spectrum into a lower energy\nattractive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as a trion branch, and a\nhigher energy repulsive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as an\nexciton branch. We have calculated the frequency and doping dependence of the\noptical conductivity and found that: (i) the splitting varies linearly with the\nFermi energy of the excess quasiparticles; (ii) the trion peak is dominant at\nhigh carrier densities; (iii) and the trion peak width is considerably smaller\nthan that of the excitonic peak. Our results are in good agreement with recent\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the probability distribution of a current flowing through a\ndiffusive system connected to a pair of reservoirs at its two ends. Sufficient\nconditions for the occurrence of a host of possible phase transitions both in\nand out of equilibrium are derived. These transitions manifest themselves as\nsingularities in the large deviation function, resulting in enhanced current\nfluctuations. Microscopic models which implement each of the scenarios are\npresented, with possible experimental realizations. Depending on the model, the\nsingularity is associated either with a particle-hole symmetry breaking, which\nleads to a continuous transition, or in the absence of the symmetry with a\nfirst-order phase transition. An exact Landau theory which captures the\ndifferent singular behaviors is derived.\n", "  Some scenarios for planetesimal formation go through a phase of collapse of\ngravitationally bound clouds of mm-cm-sized pebbles. Such clouds can form for\nexample through the streaming instability in protoplanetary disks. We model the\ncollapse process with a statistical model to obtain the internal structure of\nplanetesimals with solid radii between 10 and 1,000 km. In the collapse,\npebbles collide and, depending on relative speed, collisions have different\noutcomes. A mixture of particle sizes inside a planetesimal leads to better\npacking capabilities and higher densities. In this paper we apply results from\nnew laboratory experiments of dust aggregate collisions (presented in a\ncompanion paper) to model collision outcomes. We find that the internal\nstructure of a planetesimal is strongly dependent on both its mass and the\napplied fragmentation model. Low-mass planetesimals have no/few fragmenting\npebble collisions in the collapse phase and end up as porous pebble-piles. The\namount of fragmenting collisions increases with increasing cloud mass,\nresulting in wider particle size distributions and higher density. The collapse\nis nevertheless \"cold\" in the sense that collision speeds are damped by the\nhigh collision frequency. This ensures that a significant fraction of large\npebbles survive the collapse in all but the most massive clouds. Our results\nare in broad agreement with the observed increase in density of Kuiper belt\nobjects with increasing size as exemplified by the recent characterization of\nthe highly porous comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.\n", "  In this paper, we have constructed Boson star (BS) solutions in four\ndimensional scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) theory. In order to have non-trivial\neffect from Gauss-Bonnet term, we invoked non-minimal coupling between a\ncomplex scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling parameter,\n$\\alpha$. We show that the scalar field can no longer take arbitrary value at\nthe center of the star. Furthermore, boson-stars in our higher derivative\ntheory turn out to be slightly massive but much more compact than those in the\nusual Einstein's gravity. Interestingly, we found that for $\\alpha<-0.4$ and\n$\\alpha>0.8$, binding energy for all possible boson stars is always negative.\nThis implies that these stars are intrinsically stable against the decay by\ndispersion. We also present the mass-radius and mass-frequency curves for\nboson-star and compare them with other compact objects in gravity models\nderived from Gauss-Bonnet term.\n", "  Transitional protostellar disks have inner cavities heavily depleted in dust\nand gas, yet most show signs of ongoing accretion, often at rates comparable to\nfull disks. We show that recent constraints on the gas surface density in a few\nwell-studied disk cavities imply that the accretion speed is at least\ntranssonic. We propose that this is the natural result of accretion driven by\nmagnetized winds. Typical physical conditions of the gas inside such cavities\nare estimated for plausible X-ray and FUV radiation fields. The gas is\nmolecular and predominantly neutral, with a dimensionless ambipolar parameter\nin the right general range for wind solutions of the type developed by\nK\\\"onigl, Wardle, and others. That is to say, the density of ions and electrons\nis sufficient for moderately good coupling to the magnetic field, but not so\ngood that the magnetic flux need be dragged inward by the accreting neutrals.\n", "  The solar chromosphere observed in H-alpha consists mostly of narrow fibrils.\nThe longest typically originate in network or plage and arch far over adjacent\ninternetwork. We use data from multiple telescopes to analyze one well-observed\nexample in a quiet area. It resulted from the earlier passage of an\naccelerating disturbance in which the gas was heated to high temperature as in\nthe spicule-II phenomenon. After this passage a dark H-Halpha fibril appeared\nas a contrail. We use Saha-Boltzmann extinction estimation to gauge the onset\nand subsequent visibilities in various diagnostics and conclude that such\nH-alpha fibrils can indeed be contrail phenomena, not indicative of the\nthermodynamic and magnetic environment when they are observed but of more\ndynamic happenings before. They do not connect across internetwork cells but\nrepresent launch tracks of heating events and chart magnetic field during\nlaunch, not at present.\n", "  We present the light curves of the hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae\n(SLSNe-I) PTF12dam and iPTF13dcc, discovered by the (intermediate) Palomar\nTransient Factory. Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly\ndeclining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF12dam is very similar\nin duration (~10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (2-3 mag\nfainter) compared to those observed in other SLSNe-I. In contrast, the\nlong-duration (>30 days) early excess emission in iPTF13dcc, whose brightness\ncompetes with that of the main peak, appears to be of a different nature. We\nconstruct bolometric light curves for both targets, and fit a variety of\nlight-curve models to both the early bump and main peak in an attempt to\nunderstand the nature of these explosions. Even though the slope of the\nlate-time light-curve decline in both SLSNe is suggestively close to that\nexpected from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, the amount of\nnickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the\nestimated ejecta mass. The magnetar model including an increasing escape\nfraction provides a reasonable description of the PTF12dam observations.\nHowever, neither the basic nor the double-peaked magnetar model is capable of\nreproducing the iPTF13dcc light curve. A model combining a shock breakout in an\nextended envelope with late-time magnetar energy injection provides a\nreasonable fit to the iPTF13dcc observations. Finally, we find that the light\ncurves of both PTF12dam and iPTF13dcc can be adequately fit with the\ncircumstellar medium (CSM) interaction model.\n", "  We investigate the mechanical behavior of particle-stabilized droplets using\nmicropipette aspiration. We observe that droplets stabilized with amphiphilic\ndumbbell-shaped particles exhibit a two-stage response to increasing suction\npressure. Droplets first drip, then wrinkle and buckle like an elastic shell.\nWhile particles have a dramatic impact on the mechanism of failure, the\nmechanical strength of the droplets is only modestly increased. On the other\nhand, droplets coated with the molecular surfactant Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate are\neven weaker than bare droplets. In all cases, the magnitude of the critical\npressure for the onset of instabilities is set by the fluid surface tension.\n", "  We present a study of a recurring jet observed on October 31, 2011 by\nSDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT and Hinode/EIS. We discuss the physical parameters of the\njet such as density, differential emission measure, peak temperature, velocity\nand filling factor obtained using imaging and spectroscopic observations. A\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) analysis was performed at the region of the\njet-spire and the footpoint using EIS observations and also by combining AIA\nand XRT observations. The DEM curves were used to create synthetic spectra with\nthe CHIANTI atomic database. The plasma along the line-of-sight in the\njet-spire and jet-footpoint was found to be peak at 2.0 MK. We calculated\nelectron densities using the Fe XII ($\\lambda$186/$\\lambda$195) line ratio in\nthe region of the spire (Ne = 7.6x$10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$) and the footpoint\n(1.1x$10^{11}$ $cm^{-3}$). The plane-of-sky velocity of the jet is found to be\n524 km/s. The resulting EIS DEM values are in good agreement with those\nobtained from AIA-XRT. There is no indication of high temperatures, such as\nemission from Fe XVII ($\\lambda$254.87) (log T [K] = 6.75) seen in the\njet-spire. In case of the jet-footpoint, synthetic spectra predict weak\ncontributions from Ca XVII ($\\lambda$192.85) and Fe XVII ($\\lambda$254.87).\nWith further investigation, we confirmed emission from the Fe XVIII\n($\\lambda$93.932) line in the AIA 94 ${\\AA}$ channel in the region of the\nfootpoint. We also found good agreement between the estimated and predicted Fe\nXVIII count rates. A study of the temporal evolution of the jet-footpoint and\nthe presence of high-temperature emission from the Fe XVIII (log T [K] = 6.85)\nline leads us to conclude that the hot component in the jet-footpoint was\npresent initially that the jet had cooled down by the time EIS observed it.\n", "  Motivated by the projectable Horava--Lifshitz model/mimetic matter scenario,\nwe consider a particular modification of standard gravity, which manifests as\nan imperfect low pressure fluid. While practically indistinguishable from a\ncollection of non-relativistic weakly interacting particles on cosmological\nscales, it leaves drastically different signatures in the Solar system. The\nmain effect stems from gravitational focusing of the flow of Imperfect Dark\nMatter passing near the Sun. This entails strong amplification of Imperfect\nDark Matter energy density compared to its average value in the surrounding\nhalo. The enhancement is many orders of magnitude larger than in the case of\nCold Dark Matter, provoking deviations of the metric in the second order in the\nNewtonian potential. Effects of gravitational focusing are prominent enough to\nsubstantially affect the planetary dynamics. Using the existing bound on the\nPPN parameter $\\beta_{PPN}$, we deduce a stringent constraint on the unique\nconstant of the model.\n", "  SDSS J2222+2745 is a galaxy cluster at z=0.49, strongly lensing a quasar at\nz=2.805 into six widely separated images. In recent HST imaging of the field,\nwe identify additional multiply lensed galaxies, and confirm the sixth quasar\nimage that was identified by Dahle et al. (2013). We used the Gemini North\ntelescope to measure a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.56 of one of the secondary\nlensed galaxies. These data are used to refine the lens model of SDSS\nJ2222+2745, compute the time delay and magnifications of the lensed quasar\nimages, and reconstruct the source image of the quasar host and a second lensed\ngalaxy at z=2.3. This second galaxy also appears in absorption in our Gemini\nspectra of the lensed quasar, at a projected distance of 34 kpc. Our model is\nin agreement with the recent time delay measurements of Dahle et al. (2015),\nwho found tAB=47.7+/-6.0 days and tAC=-722+/-24 days. We use the observed time\ndelays to further constrain the model, and find that the model-predicted time\ndelays of the three faint images of the quasar are tAD=502+/-68 days,\ntAE=611+/-75 days, and tAF=415+/-72 days. We have initiated a follow-up\ncampaign to measure these time delays with Gemini North. Finally, we present\ninitial results from an X-ray monitoring program with Swift, indicating the\npresence of hard X-ray emission from the lensed quasar, as well as extended\nX-ray emission from the cluster itself, which is consistent with the lensing\nmass measurement and the cluster velocity dispersion.\n", "  We present the development, manufacturing and performance of spherically bent\ncrystal analyzers (SBCAs) of 100 mm diameter and 0.5 m bending radius. The\nelastic strain in the crystal wafer is partially released by a \"strip-bent\"\nmethod where the crystal wafer is cut in strips prior to the bending and the\nanodic bonding process. Compared to standard 1 m SBCAs, a gain in intensity is\nobtained without loss of energy resolution. The gain ranges between 2.5 and\n4.5, depending on the experimental conditions and the width of the emission\nline measured. This reduces the acquisition times required to perform high\nenergy-resolution x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy on ultra-dilute\nspecies, accessing concentrations of the element of interest down to, or below,\nthe ppm (ng/mg) level.\n", "  We consider black hole solutions of Einstein gravity that describe\ndeformations of CFTs at finite temperature in which spatial translations have\nbeen broken explicitly. We focus on deformations that are periodic in the\nnon-compact spatial directions, which effectively corresponds to considering\nthe CFT on a spatial torus with a non-trivial metric. We apply a DC thermal\ngradient and show that in a hydrodynamic limit the linearised, local thermal\ncurrents can be determined by solving linearised, forced Navier-Stokes\nequations for an incompressible fluid on the torus. We also show how\nsub-leading corrections to the thermal current can be calculated as well as\nshowing how the full stress tensor response that is generated by the DC source\ncan be obtained. We also compare our results with the fluid-gravity approach.\n", "  We present an illustrative discussion of the physics potential of $\\mu^-$-\n$e^+$ conversion. We point out that this process, although much less frequently\nstudied than the related but much more popular processes of $\\mu^-$- $e^-$\nconversion and neutrinoless double beta decay, in fact is a promising\nalternative possibility to detect both lepton flavour and number violation.\nHowever, for this goal to be reached, a combined effort of experiments and\ntheory, both in nuclear and particle physics, is necessary to advance. The aim\nof this paper is to be an \"appetiser\" to trigger such an initiative.\n", "  The main goal of this work is to perform a detailed study of the optical\nvariability of the Be/X-ray binary SAX J2239.3+6116. We obtained multi-colour\nBVRI photometry and polarimetry and 4000-7000 A spectroscopy. The optical\ncounterpart to SAX J2239.3+6116 is a V=14.8 B0Ve star located at a distance of\n~4.9 kpc. The interstellar reddening in the direction of the source is\nE(B-V)=1.70 mag. The monitoring of the Halpha line reveals a slow long-term\ndecline of its equivalent width since 2001. The line profile is characterized\nby a stable double-peak profile with no indication of large-scale distortions.\nAlthough somewhat higher than predicted by the models, the optical polarization\nis consistent with electron scattering in the circumstellar disk. We attribute\nthe long-term decrease in the intensity of the Halpha line to the dissipation\nof the circumstellar disk of the Be star. The longer variability timescales\nobserved in SAX J2239.3+6116 compared to other Be/X-ray binaries may be\nexplained by the wide orbit of the system.\n", "  We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Data Release 12 (DR12Q),\ncontaining nearly 300,000 AGNs, to calculate the monochromatic luminosities at\n5100\\AA, 3000\\AA, and 1350\\AA, derived from the broad-band extinction-corrected\nSDSS magnitudes. After matching them to their counterparts based on spectra and\npublished in the SDSS Quasar Data Release 7 (DR7Q), we find perfect\ncorrelations with minute mean offsets ($\\sim$0.01 dex) and dispersions of\ndifferences of 0.11, 0.10, 0.12 dex, respectively, across a 2.5 dex luminosity\nrange. We then estimate the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) black hole masses\nusing the broad line region radius--luminosity relations and the FWHM of the\nMgII and CIV emission lines, to provide a catalog of 283,032 virial black hole\nmass estimates (132,451 for MgII, 213,068 for CIV, and 62,487 for both) along\nwith the bolometric luminosity and the Eddington ratio estimates for\n$0.1<z<5.5$ and for roughly a quarter of the sky covered by SDSS. The black\nhole mass estimates from MgII turned out to be closely matched to the ones from\nDR7Q with the dispersion of differences of 0.34 dex across a $\\sim$2 dex BH\nmass range. We uncovered a bias in the derived CIV FWHMs from DR12Q as compared\nto DR7Q, that we correct empirically. The CIV BH mass estimates should be used\nwith caution because the CIV line is known to cause problems in the BH mass\nestimation from single-epoch spectra. Finally, after the FWHM correction, the\nAGN black hole mass estimates from CIV closely match the DR7Q ones (with the\ndispersion of 0.28 dex), and more importantly the MgII and CIV BH masses agree\ninternally with the mean offset of 0.07 dex and the dispersion of 0.39 dex.\n", "  We investigate the symmetry structure of inflation in 2+1 dimensions. In\nparticular, we show that the asymptotic symmetries of three-dimensional de\nSitter space are in one-to-one correspondence with cosmological adiabatic modes\nfor the curvature perturbation. In 2+1 dimensions, the asymptotic symmetry\nalgebra is infinite-dimensional, given by two copies of the Virasoro algebra,\nand can be traced to the conformal symmetries of the two-dimensional spatial\nslices of de Sitter. We study the consequences of this infinite-dimensional\nsymmetry for inflationary correlation functions, finding new soft theorems that\nhold only in 2+1 dimensions. Expanding the correlation functions as a power\nseries in the soft momentum $q$, these relations constrain the traceless part\nof the tensorial coefficient at each order in $q$ in terms of a lower-point\nfunction. As a check, we verify that the ${\\cal O}(q^2)$ identity is satisfied\nby inflationary correlation functions in the limit of small sound speed.\n", "  Gamma-ray flash generation in near critical density (NCD) target irradiated\nby four symmetrical colliding laser pulses is numerically investigated. With\npeak intensities about $10^{23}$ W/cm$^2$, the laser pulses boost electron\nenergy through direct laser acceleration, while pushing them inward with the\nponderomotive force. After backscattering with counter-propagating laser, the\naccelerated electron is trapped in the optical lattice or the electromagnetic\nstanding waves (SW) created by the coherent overlapping of the laser pulses,\nand emits gamma-ray photons in Multiple Compton Scattering regime, where\nelectrons act as a medium transferring energy from the laser to gamma-rays. The\nenergy conversion rate from laser pulses to gamma-ray can be as high as 50\\%\n", "  In this work, a quantum dot that is defined asymmetrically by electrostatic\nmeans induced on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is investigated to unravel the\neffect of geometric constrains on the formation of spin droplets under\nquantised Hall conditions. The incompressibility of exciting nu = 5/2 state is\nexplored by solving the Schrodinger equation within spin density functional\ntheory, where the confinement potential is obtained self-consistently utilising\nthe Thomas-Fermi approximation. Our numerical investigations show that the\nspatial distribution of the nu = 2 incompressible strips and electron\noccupation in the second lowest Landau level considerably differ from the\nresults of the laterally symmetric quantum dots. Our findings yield two\nimportant consequences, first the incompressibility of the intriguing nu = 5/2\nstate is strongly affected by the asymmetry, and second, since the\nAharonov-Bohm interference patterns depend on the velocity of the particles,\nasymmetry yields an additional parameter to adjust the oscillation period,\nwhich imposes a boundary condition dependency in observing quasi-particle\nphases.\n", "  We construct a many-body theory of magneto-elasticity in one dimension and\nshow that the dynamical correlation functions of the quantum magnet, connecting\nthe spins with phonons, involve all energy scales. Accounting for all magnetic\nstates non-perturbatively via the exact diagonalisation techniques of Bethe\nansatz, we find that the renormalisation of the phonon velocity is a\nnon-monotonous function of the external magnetic field and identify a new\nmechanism for attenuation of phonons - via hybridisation with the continuum of\nexcitations at high energy. We conduct ultrasonic measurements on a\nhigh-quality single crystal of the frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet $\\textrm{Cs}_{2}\\textrm{CuCl}_{4}$ in its one-dimensional\nregime and confirm the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that ultrasound\ncan be used as a powerful probe of strong correlations in one dimension.\n", "  We present two novel methods for the estimation of the angular power spectrum\nof cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. We assume an absolute CMB\nexperiment with arbitrary asymmetric beams and arbitrary sky coverage. The\nmethods differ from earlier ones in that the power spectrum is estimated\ndirectly from time-ordered data, without first compressing the data into a sky\nmap, and they take into account the effect of asymmetric beams. In particular,\nthey correct the beam-induced leakage from temperature to polarization. The\nmethods are applicable to a case where part of the sky has been masked out to\nremove foreground contamination, leaving a pure CMB signal, but incomplete sky\ncoverage. The first method (DQML) is derived as the optimal quadratic\nestimator, which simultaneously yields an unbiased spectrum estimate and\nminimizes its variance. We successfully apply it to multipoles up to\n$\\ell$=200. The second method is derived as a weak-signal approximation from\nthe first one. It yields an unbiased estimate for the full multipole range, but\nrelaxes the requirement of minimal variance. We validate the methods with\nsimulations for the 70 GHz channel of {\\tt Planck} surveyor, and demonstrate\nthat we are able to correct the beam effects in the $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$\nspectra up to multipole $\\ell$=1500. Together the two methods cover the\ncomplete multipole range with no gap in between.\n", "  We present new estimates for the statistical properties of damped\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs). We compute the column density distribution\nfunction at $z>2$, the line density, $\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}X$, and the neutral\nhydrogen density, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{DLA}$. Our estimates are derived from the DLA\ncatalogue of Garnett 2016, which uses the SDSS-III DR12 quasar spectroscopic\nsurvey. This catalogue provides a probability that a given spectrum contains a\nDLA, allowing us to use even the noisiest data without biasing our results and\nthus substantially increase our sample size. We measure a non-zero column\ndensity distribution function at $95\\%$ confidence for all column densities\n$N_\\mathrm{HI} < 5\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We make the first measurements\nfrom SDSS of $\\mathrm{d}N/\\mathrm{d}X$ and $\\Omega_\\mathrm{DLA}$ at $z>4$. We\nshow that our results are insensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio of the\nspectra, but that there is a residual dependence on quasar redshift for\n$z<2.5$, which may be due to remaining systematics in our analysis.\n", "  Interaction of a high intensity short laser pulse with near-critical plasmas\nallows to achieve extremely high coupling efficiency and transfer laser energy\nto energetic ions. One dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations are\nconsidered to detail the processes involved in the energy transfer. A\nconfrontation of the numerical results with the theory highlights a key role\nplayed by the process of stimulated Raman scattering in the relativistic\nregime. The interaction of a 1 ps laser pulse (I $\\sim$ 6.10$^{18}$ W.cm$^2$)\nwith an under-critical (0.5 $n_c$) homogeneous plasma leads to a very high\nplasma absorption reaching 68 % of the laser pulse energy. This permits a\nhomogeneous electron heating all along the plasma and an efficient ion\nacceleration at the plasma edges and in cavities.\n", "  We analyse the properties of the HI gas distribution in the Auriga project, a\nset of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations performed with the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO and a physics model for galaxy formation that succeeds\nin forming realistic late-type galaxies in the 30 Milky Way-sized haloes\nsimulated in this project. We use a simple approach to estimate the neutral\nhydrogen fraction in our simulation set, which treats low-density and\nstar-forming gas separately, and we explore two different prescriptions to\nsubtract the contribution of molecular hydrogen from the total HI content. The\nHI gas in the vast majority of the systems forms extended discs although more\ndisturbed morphologies are present. Notwithstanding the general good agreement\nwith observed HI properties -- such as radial profiles and the mass-diameter\nrelation -- the Auriga galaxies are systematically larger and more gas-rich\nthan typical nearby galaxies. Interestingly, the amount of HI gas outside the\ndisc plane correlates with the star formation rate, consistent with a picture\nwhere most of this extra-planar HI gas originates from a fountain-like flow.\nOur findings are robust with respect to the different assumptions adopted for\ncomputing the molecular hydrogen fraction and do not vary significantly over a\nwide range of numerical resolution. The HI modelling introduced in this paper\ncan be used in future work to build artificial interferometric HI data cubes,\nallowing an even closer comparison of the gas dynamics in simulated galaxies\nwith observations.\n", "  We examine galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, and gas\ncontents predicted by the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which\nemploy meshless hydrodynamics and novel feedback prescriptions that yield a\ngood match to observed galaxy stellar mass assembly. We combine 50, 25, and\n12.5 Mpc/h boxes with a quarter billion particles each to show that MUFASA\nbroadly reproduces a wide range of relevant observations, including SFR and\nspecific SFR functions, the mass-metallicity relation, HI and H2 fractions, HI\n(21 cm) and CO luminosity functions, and cosmic gas density evolution. There\nare mild but significant discrepancies, such as too many high-SFR galaxies,\noverly metal-rich and HI-poor galaxies at M*>10^{10} Mo, and sSFRs that are too\nlow at z~1-2. The HI mass function increases by x2 out to z~1 then steepens to\nhigher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan\net al. conversion factor shows a rapid increase of CO-bright galaxies out to\nz~2 in accord with data. Omega_HI and Omega_H2 both scale roughly as (1+z)^0.7\nout to z~3, comparable to the rise in HI and H2 fractions. MUFASA galaxies with\nhigh SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher HI and H2 fractions,\nfollowing observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how\nfluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling\nrelations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution.\nThese successes highlight MUFASA as a viable platform to study many facets of\ncosmological galaxy evolution.\n", "  We investigate the effects of cosmic ray (CR) dynamics on cold, dense clouds\nembedded in a hot, tenuous galactic halo. If the magnetic field does not\nincrease too much inside the cloud, the local reduction in Alfv\\'en speed\nimposes a bottleneck on CRs streaming out from the star-forming galactic disk.\nThe bottleneck flattens the upstream CR gradient in the hot gas, implying that\nmulti-phase structure could have global effects on CR driven winds. A large CR\npressure gradient can also develop on the outward-facing edge of the cloud.\nThis pressure gradient has two independent effects. The CRs push the cloud\nupward, imparting it with momentum. On smaller scales, the CRs pressurize cold\ngas in the fronts, reducing its density, consistent with the low densities of\ncold gas inferred in recent COS observations of local $L_{*}$ galaxies. They\nalso heat the material at the cloud edge, broadening the cloud-halo interface\nand causing an observable change in interface ionic abundances. Due to the much\nweaker temperature dependence of cosmic ray heating relative to thermal\nconductive heating, CR mediated fronts have a higher ratio of low to high ions\ncompared to conduction fronts, in better agreement with observations. We\ninvestigate these effects separately using 1D simulations and analytic\ntechniques.\n", "  This work presents an analysis of monoenergetic electronic recoil peaks in\nthe dark-matter-search and calibration data from the first underground science\nrun of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector. Liquid xenon charge and\nlight yields for electronic recoil energies between 5.2 and 661.7 keV are\nmeasured, as well as the energy resolution for the LUX detector at those same\nenergies. Additionally, there is an interpretation of existing measurements and\ndescriptions of electron-ion recombination fluctuations in liquid xenon as\nlimiting cases of a more general liquid xenon re- combination fluctuation\nmodel. Measurements of the standard deviation of these fluctuations at\nmonoenergetic electronic recoil peaks exhibit a linear dependence on the number\nof ions for energy deposits up to 661.7 keV, consistent with previous LUX\nmeasurements between 2-16 keV with $^3$H. We highlight similarities in liquid\nxenon recombination for electronic and nuclear recoils with a comparison of\nrecombination fluctuations measured with low-energy calibration data.\n", "  Due to the topological nature of Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, exotic\nedge states have been found existing in one-dimensional periodic and\nquasiperiodic lattices. In this article, we investigate continuous-time quantum\nwalks of identical particles initially located on either edge of commensurate\nAAH lattices in detail. It is shown that the quantum walker is delocalized\namong the whole lattice until the strength of periodic modulation is strong\nenough. The inverse participation ratios (IPRs) for all of the eigenstates are\ncalculated. It is found that the localization properties of the quantum walker\nis mainly determined by the IPRs of the topologically protected edge states.\nMore interestingly, the edge states are shown to have an exotic\n`\\emph{repulsion}' effect on quantum walkers initiated from the lattice sites\ninside the bulk. Furthermore, we examine the role of nearest-neighbour\ninteraction on the quantum walks of two identical fermions. Clear enhancement\nof the `\\emph{repulsion}' effect by strong interaction has been shown.\n", "  We employ high resolution spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry to derive the\nphysical properties and magnetic characteristics of the multiple system HD\n164492C, located in the young open cluster M20. The spectrum reveals evidence\nof 3 components: a broad-lined early B star (HD 164492C1), a narrow-lined early\nB star (HD 164492C2), and a late B star (HD 164492C3). Components C2 and C3\nexhibit significant ($>100$ km/s) bulk radial velocity variations with a period\nof $12.5351(7)$ d that we attribute to eccentric binary motion around a common\ncentre-of-mass. Component C1 exhibits no detectable radial velocity variations.\nUsing constraints derived from modeling the orbit of the C2+C3 binary and from\nsynthesis of the combined spectrum, we determine the approximate physical\ncharacteristics of the components. We conclude that a coherent evolutionary\nsolution consistent with the published age of M20 implies a distance to the\nsystem of $0.9\\pm 0.2$ kpc, corresponding to the smallest published values. We\nconfirm the detection of a strong magnetic field in the combined spectrum. The\nfield is clearly associated with the broad-lined C1 component of the system.\nRepeated measurement of the longitudinal magnetic field allows the derivation\nof the rotation period of the magnetic star, $P_{\\rm rot}=1.36986(6)$ d. We\nderive the star's magnetic geometry, finding $i=63\\pm 6$ deg, $\\beta=33\\pm 6$\ndeg and a dipole polar strength $B_{\\rm d}=7.9^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$ kG. Strong\nemission - varying according to the magnetic period - is detected in the\nH$\\alpha$ profile. This is consistent with the presence of a centrifugal\nmagnetosphere surrounding the rapidly rotating magnetic C1 component.\n", "  Observations reveal a uniform Kolmogorov turbulence throughout the diffuse\nionized interstellar medium (ISM) and supersonic turbulence preferentially\nlocated in the Galactic plane. Correspondingly, we consider the Galactic\ndistribution of electron density fluctuations consisting of not only a\nKolmogorov density spectrum but also a short-wave-dominated density spectrum\nwith the density structure formed at small scales due to shocks. The resulting\ndependence of the scatter broadening time on the dispersion measure (DM)\nnaturally interprets the existing observational data for both low and high-DM\npulsars. According to the criteria that we derive for a quantitative\ndetermination of scattering regimes over wide ranges of DMs and frequencies\n$\\nu$, we find that the pulsars with low DMs are primarily scattered by the\nKolmogorov turbulence, while those at low Galactic latitudes with high DMs\nundergo more enhanced scattering dominated by the supersonic turbulence, where\nthe corresponding density spectrum has a spectral index $\\approx 2.6$. Besides,\nby considering a volume filling factor of the density structures with the\ndependence on $\\nu$ as $\\propto \\nu^{1.4}$ in the supersonic turbulence, our\nmodel can also explain the observed shallower $\\nu$ scaling of the scattering\ntime than the Kolmogorov scaling for the pulsars with relatively large DMs. The\ncomparison between our analytical results and the scattering measurements of\npulsars in turn makes a useful probe of the properties of the large-scale ISM\nturbulence, e.g., an injection scale of $\\sim 100$ pc, and also characteristics\nof small-scale density structures.\n", "  In the simplified dark matter models commonly studied, the mass generation\nmechanism for the dark fields is not typically specified. We demonstrate that\nthe dark matter interaction types, and hence the annihilation processes\nrelevant for relic density and indirect detection, are strongly dictated by the\nmass generation mechanism chosen for the dark sector particles, and the\nrequirement of gauge invariance. We focus on the class of models in which\nfermionic dark matter couples to a spin-1 vector or axial-vector mediator.\nHowever, in order to generate dark sector mass terms, it is necessary in most\ncases to introduce a dark Higgs field and thus a spin-0 scalar mediator will\nalso be present. In the case that all the dark sector fields gain masses via\ncoupling to a single dark sector Higgs field, it is mandatory that the\naxial-vector coupling of the spin-1 mediator to the dark matter is non-zero;\nthe vector coupling may also be present depending on the charge assignments.\nFor all other mass generation options, only pure vector couplings between the\nspin-1 mediator and the dark matter are allowed. If these coupling restrictions\nare not obeyed, unphysical results may be obtained such as a violation of\nunitarity at high energies. These two-mediator scenarios lead to important\nphenomenology that does not arise in single mediator models. We survey\ntwo-mediator dark matter models which contain both vector and scalar mediators,\nand explore their relic density and indirect detection phenomenology.\n", "  The NEMO-3 experiment measured the half-life of the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay\nand searched for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay of $^{116}$Cd. Using $410$ g of\n$^{116}$Cd installed in the detector with an exposure of $5.26$ y,\n($4968\\pm74$) events corresponding to the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay of $^{116}$Cd\nto the ground state of $^{116}$Sn have been observed with a signal to\nbackground ratio of about $12$. The half-life of the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay has\nbeen measured to be $\nT_{1/2}^{2\\nu}=[2.74\\pm0.04\\mbox{(stat.)}\\pm0.18\\mbox{(syst.)}]\\times10^{19}$\ny. No events have been observed above the expected background while searching\nfor $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. The corresponding limit on the half-life is\ndetermined to be $T_{1/2}^{0\\nu} \\ge 1.0 \\times 10^{23}$ y at the $90$ % C.L.\nwhich corresponds to an upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass of\n$\\langle m_{\\nu} \\rangle \\le 1.4-2.5$ eV depending on the nuclear matrix\nelements considered. Limits on other mechanisms generating $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay such as the exchange of R-parity violating supersymmetric particles,\nright-handed currents and majoron emission are also obtained.\n", "  The redshift-space bispectrum (three point statistics) of galaxies depends on\nthe expansion rate, the growth rate, and geometry of the Universe, and hence\ncan be used to measure key cosmological parameters. In a homogeneous Universe\nthe bispectrum is a function of five variables and unlike its two point\nstatistics counterpart -- the power spectrum, which is a function of only two\nvariables -- is difficult to analyse unless the information is somehow reduced.\nThe most commonly considered reduction schemes rely on computing angular\nintegrals over possible orientations of the bispectrum triangle, thus reducing\nit to sets of function of only three variables describing the triangle shape.\nWe use Fisher information formalism to study the information loss associated\nwith this angular integration. Without any reduction, the bispectrum alone can\ndeliver constraints on the growth rate parameter $f$ that are better by a\nfactor of $2.5$ compared to the power spectrum, for a sample of luminous red\ngalaxies expected from near future galaxy surveys at a redshift of $z\\sim0.65$.\nAt lower redshifts the improvement could be up to a factor of $3$. We find that\nmost of the information is in the azimuthal averages of the first three even\nmultipoles. This suggests that the bispectrum of every configuration can be\nreduced to just three numbers (instead of a 2D function) without significant\nloss of cosmologically relevant information.\n", "  We investigate the information content of various cosmic shear statistics on\nthe theory of gravity. Focusing on the Hu-Sawicki-type $f(R)$ model, we perform\na set of ray-tracing simulations and measure the convergence bispectrum, peak\ncounts and Minkowski functionals. We first show that while the convergence\npower spectrum does have sensitivity to the current value of extra scalar\ndegree of freedom $|f_{\\rm R0}|$, it is largely compensated by a change in the\npresent density amplitude parameter $\\sigma_{8}$ and the matter density\nparameter $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}$. With accurate covariance matrices obtained from\n1000 lensing simulations, we then examine the constraining power of the three\nadditional statistics. We find that these probes are indeed helpful to break\nthe parameter degeneracy, which can not be resolved from the power spectrum\nalone. We show that especially the peak counts and Minkowski functionals have\nthe potential to rigorously (marginally) detect the signature of modified\ngravity with the parameter $|f_{\\rm R0}|$ as small as $10^{-5}$ ($10^{-6}$) if\nwe can properly model them on small ($\\sim 1\\, \\mathrm{arcmin}$) scale in a\nfuture survey with a sky coverage of 1,500 squared degrees. We also show that\nthe signal level is similar among the additional three statistics and all of\nthem provide complementary information to the power spectrum. These findings\nindicate the importance of combining multiple probes beyond the standard power\nspectrum analysis to detect possible modifications to General Relativity.\n", "  At the LHC, dileptonic events may turn up new physics interacting with quarks\nand leptons. The poster child for this scenario is a resonant $Z'$, much\nanticipated in $\\ell^+ \\ell^-$ invariant mass spectra. However, angular spectra\nof dileptons may play an equal or stronger role in discovering a non-resonant\nspecies. This paper avails of their LHC measurements to corner the couplings\nand masses of leptoquarks (LQs), that can mediate $q \\bar{q} \\rightarrow \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ in the $t$-channel and dramatically alter Standard Model angular\nspectra. Also derived are constraints from alterations to $m_{\\ell \\ell}$\ndistributions. These dilepton probes, exploiting the high rates and small\nuncertainties of the Drell-Yan process, rival or outdo dedicated LHC searches\nfor LQs in single and pair production modes. The couplings of LQs with\nelectronic interactions are best bound today by low-energy measurements of\natomic parity violation, but can be probed better by $\\ell^+ \\ell^-$\nmeasurements in the high luminosity runs of the LHC, with the angular spectra\nleading the way. This work also advocates the experimental presentation of\nboost-invariant angular asymmetries that vanish in the SM.\n", "  We present Chandra X-ray Observatory and Submillimeter Array (SMA) imaging of\nHBC 515, a system consisting of multiple young stellar objects (YSOs). The five\nmembers of HBC 515 represent a remarkably diverse array of YSOs, ranging from\nthe low-mass Class I/II protostar HBC 515B, through Class II and transition\ndisk objects (HBC 515D and C, respectively), to the \"diskless\", intermediate-\nmass, pre-main sequence binary HBC 515A. Our Chandra/ACIS imaging establishes\nthat all five components are X-ray sources, with HBC 515A - a\nsubarcsecond-separation binary that is partially resolved by Chandra - being\nthe dominant X-ray source. We detect an X-ray flare associated with HBC 515B.\nIn the SMA imaging, HBC 515B is detected as a strong 1.3 mm continuum emission\nsource; a second, weaker mm continuum source is coincident with the position of\nthe transition disk object HBC 515C. These results strongly support the\nprotostellar nature of HBC 515B, and firmly establish HBC 515A as a member of\nthe rare class of relatively massive, X-ray luminous \"weak-lined T Tauri stars\"\nthat are binaries and have shed their disks at very early stages of pre-MS\nevolution. The coexistence of two such disparate objects within a single,\npresumably coeval multiple YSO system highlights the influence of pre- MS star\nmass, binarity, and X-ray luminosity in regulating the lifetimes of\ncircumstellar, planet-forming disks and the timescales of star-disk\ninteractions.\n", "  We study the critical behavior and the ground-state entanglement of a large\nclass of $\\mathrm{su}(1|1)$ supersymmetric spin chains with a general (not\nnecessarily monotonic) dispersion relation. We show that this class includes\nseveral relevant models, with both short- and long-range interactions of a\nsimple form. We determine the low temperature behavior of the free energy per\nspin, and deduce that the models considered have a critical phase in the\nuniversality class of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), whose\ncentral charge coincides with the number of connected components of the Fermi\nsea. We also study the R\\'enyi entanglement entropy of the ground state,\nderiving its asymptotic behavior as the block size tends to infinity. In\nparticular, we show that this entropy exhibits the logarithmic growth\ncharacteristic of $(1+1)$-dimensional CFTs and one-dimensional (fermionic)\ncritical lattice models, with a central charge consistent with the\nlow-temperature behavior of the free energy. Our results confirm the widely\nbelieved conjecture that the critical behavior of fermionic lattice models is\ncompletely determined by the topology of their Fermi surface.\n", "  We analyze chiral topological edge modes in a non-Hermitian variant of the 2D\nDirac equation. Such modes appear at interfaces between media with different\n\"masses\" and/or signs of the \"non-Hermitian charge\". The existence of these\nedge modes is intimately related to exceptional points of the bulk\nHamiltonians, i.e., degeneracies in the bulk spectra of the media. We find that\nthe topological edge modes can be divided into three families\n(\"Hermitian-like\", \"non-Hermitian\", and \"mixed\"), these are characterized by\ntwo winding numbers, describing two distinct kinds of half-integer charges\ncarried by the exceptional points. We show that all the above types of\ntopological edge modes can be realized in honeycomb lattices of ring resonators\nwith asymmetric or gain/loss couplings.\n", "  Pristine monolayer graphene exhibits very poor screening because the density\nof states vanishes at the Dirac point. As a result, charge relaxation is\ncontrolled by the effects of zero-point motion (rather than by the Coulomb\ninteraction) over a wide range of parameters. Combined with the fact that\ngraphene possesses finite intrinsic conductivity, this leads to a regime of\nrelaxation described by a non-linear diffusion equation with a diffusion\ncoefficient that diverges at zero charge density. Some consequences of this\nfast diffusion are self-similar superdiffusive regimes of relaxation, the\ndevelopment of a charge depleted region at the interface between electron- and\nhole-rich regions, and finite extinction times for periodic charge profiles.\n", "  In this work, we propose a scheme that provides an analytical estimate for\nthe time-dependent degree distribution of some networks. This scheme maps the\nproblem into a random walk in degree space, and then we choose the paths that\nare responsible for the dominant contributions. The method is illustrated on\nthe dynamical versions of the Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi and Watts-Strogatz graphs, which\nwere introduced as static models in the original formulation. We have succeeded\nin obtaining an analytical form for the dynamics Watts-Strogatz model, which is\nasymptotically exact for some regimes.\n", "  One of the remarkable interaction effects on topological insulators is the\nreduction of topological classification in free-fermion systems. We address\nthis issue in a bilayer honeycomb lattice model by taking into account\ntemperature effects on the reduction. Our analysis, based on the real-space\ndynamical mean field theory, elucidates the following results. (i) Even when\nthe reduction occurs, the winding number defined by the Green's function can\ntake a nontrivial value at zero temperature. (ii) The winding number taking the\nnontrivial value becomes consistent with the absence of gapless edge modes due\nto Mott behaviors emerging only at the edges. (iii) Temperature effects can\nrestore the gapless edge modes, provided that the energy scale of interactions\nis smaller than the bulk gap. In addition, we observe the topological edge Mott\nbehavior only in some finite temperature region.\n", "  We develop a microscopic large-$N$ theory of electron-electron interaction\ncorrections to multi-legged Feynman diagrams describing second- and third-order\nnonlinear response functions. Our theory, which reduces to the well-known\nrandom phase approximation in the linear-response limit, is completely general\nand is useful to understand all second- and third-order nonlinear effects,\nincluding harmonic generation, wave mixing, and photon drag. We apply our\ntheoretical framework to the case of graphene, by carrying out microscopic\ncalculations of the second- and third-order nonlinear response functions of an\ninteracting two-dimensional (2D) gas of massless Dirac fermions. We compare our\nresults with recent measurements, where all-optical launching of graphene\nplasmons has been achieved by virtue of the finiteness of the quasi-homogeneous\nsecond-order nonlinear response of this inversion-symmetric 2D material.\n", "  Binary black holes have been in limelight off late due to the detection of\ngravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries in the events GW150914 and\nGW151226. In this paper we study gravitational lensing by the binary black\nholes modeled as equal mass Majumdar-Papapetrou dihole metric and show that\nthis system displays features that are quite unprecedented and absent in any\nother lensing configuration investigated so far. We restrict our attention to\nthe light rays which move on the plane midway between the two identical black\nholes, which allows us to employ techniques developed for the equatorial\nlensing in spherically symmetric spacetimes. If distance between the two black\nholes is below a certain threshold value, the system admits two photon spheres.\nAs in the case of single black hole, infinitely many relativistic images are\nformed due to the light rays which turn back from the region outside the outer\n(unstable) photon sphere, all of which lie beyond a critical angular radius\nwith respect to the lens. However in the presence of the inner (stable) photon\nsphere, the effective potential now increases again and the light rays that\nenter the outer photon sphere can turn back, leading to the formation of a new\nset of infinitely many relativistic images, all of which lie below the critical\nradius from the lens mentioned above. As the distance between the two black\nhole increases, two photon spheres approach each other, merge and eventually\ndisappear. In the absence of photon sphere, apart from the formation of a\nfinite number of discrete relativistic images, the system remarkably admits a\nradial caustic, which has never been observed in the context of relativistic\nlensing before. Thus the system of binary black hole admits novel features both\nin the presence and absence of photon spheres. We discuss possible\nobservational signatures and implications of binary black hole lensing.\n", "  For systems of classical spins interacting with the bath via damping and\nthermal noise, the approach is suggested to replace the white noise by a pulse\nnoise acting at regular time intervals $\\Delta t$, within which the system\nevolves conservatively. The method is working well in the typical case of a\nsmall dimensionless damping constant $\\lambda$ and allows a considerable\nspeed-up of computations by using high-order numerical integrators with a large\ntime step $\\delta t$ (up to a fraction of the precession period), while keeping\n$\\delta t\\ll\\Delta t$ to reduce the relative contribution of noise-related\noperations. In cases when precession can be discarded, $\\delta t$ can be\nincreased up to a fraction of the relaxation time $\\propto1/\\lambda$ that leads\nto a further speed-up. This makes equilibration speed comparable with that of\nMetropolis Monte Carlo. The pulse-noise approach is tested on single-spin and\nmulti-spin models.\n", "  We study the polarized quark hadronization in a Monte Carlo (MC) framework\nbased on the recent extension of the quark-jet framework, where a\nself-consistent treatment of the quark polarization transfer in a sequential\nhadronization picture has been presented. Here, we first adopt this approach\nfor MC simulations of hadronization process with finite number of produced\nhadrons, expressing the relevant probabilities in terms of the eight leading\ntwist quark-to-quark transverse momentum dependent (TMD) splitting functions\n(SFs) for elementary $q \\to q'+h$ transition. We present explicit expressions\nfor the unpolarized and Collins fragmentation functions (FFs) of unpolarized\nhadrons emitted at rank two. Further, we demonstrate that all the current\nspectator-type model calculations of the leading twist quark-to-quark TMD SFs\nviolate the positivity constraints, and propose quark model based ansatz for\nthese input functions that circumvents the problem. We validate our MC\nframework by explicitly proving the absence of unphysical azimuthal modulations\nof the computed polarized FFs, and by precisely reproducing the earlier derived\nexplicit results for rank two pions. Finally, we present the full results for\npion unpolarized and Collins FFs, as well as the corresponding analyzing powers\nfrom high statistics MC simulations with a large number of produced hadrons for\ntwo different model input elementary SFs. The results for both sets of input\nfunctions exhibit the same general features of opposite signed Collins function\nfor favored and unfavored channels at large $z$, and at the same time\ndemonstrate the flexibility of the quark-jet framework by producing\nsignificantly different dependences of the results at mid- to low-$z$ for the\ntwo model inputs.\n", "  We suggest two alternative schemes to predict lepton mixing angles as well as\n$CP$ violating phases from a discrete flavor symmetry group combined with $CP$\nsymmetry. In the first scenario, the flavor and $CP$ symmetry is broken to the\nresidual groups of the structure $Z_2\\times CP$ in the neutrino and charged\nlepton sectors. The resulting lepton mixing matrix depends on two free\nparameters $\\theta_{\\nu}$ and $\\theta_{l}$. This type of breaking pattern is\nextended to the quark sector. In the second scheme, an abelian subgroup\ncontained in the flavor group is preserved by the charged lepton mass matrix\nand the neutrino mass matrix is invariant under a single remnant $CP$\ntransformation, all lepton mixing parameter are determined in terms of three\nfree parameters $\\theta_{1, 2, 3}$. We derive the most general criterion to\ndetermine whether two distinct residual symmetries lead to the same mixing\npattern if the redefinition of the free parameters $\\theta_{\\nu, l}$ and\n$\\theta_{1, 2, 3}$ is taken into account. We have studied the lepton mixing\npatterns arising from the flavor group $S_4$ and $CP$ symmetry which are\nsubsequently broken to all of the possible residual symmetries discussed in\nthis work.\n", "  We study the surface tension of highly magnetized three flavor quark matter\nwithin the formalism of multiple reflection expansion (MRE). Quark matter is\ndescribed as a mixture of free Fermi gases composed by quarks $u$, $d$, $s$ and\nelectrons, in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. Due to the presence\nof strong magnetic fields the particles' transverse motion is quantized into\nLandau levels, and the surface tension has a different value in the parallel\nand transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field.\n  We calculate the transverse and longitudinal surface tension for different\nvalues of the magnetic field and for quark matter drops with different sizes,\nfrom a few fm to the bulk limit. For baryon number densities between $2-10$\ntimes the nuclear saturation density, the surface tension falls in the range $2\n- 20$ MeV /fm$^{2}$. The largest contribution comes from strange quarks which\nhave a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for $u$ or $d$\nquarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons. Our\nresults show that the total surface tension is quite insensitive to the size of\nthe drop. We also find that the surface tensions in the transverse and parallel\ndirections are almost unaffected by the magnetic field if $eB$ is below $\\sim 5\n\\times 10^{-3} $ GeV$^2$. Nevertheless, for higher values of $eB$, there is a\nsignificant increase in the parallel surface tension and a significant decrease\nin the transverse one with respect to the unmagnetized case.\n", "  Aiming at testing the validity of our magnesium atomic model and\ninvestigating the effects of non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) on\nthe formation of the H-band neutral magnesium lines, we derive the differential\nMg abundances from selected transitions for 13 stars either adopting or\nrelaxing the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). Our\nanalysis is based on high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio H-band\nspectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE) and optical spectra from several instruments. The absolute differences\nbetween the Mg abundances derived from the two wavelength bands are always less\nthan 0.1 dex in the NLTE analysis, while they are slightly larger for the LTE\ncase. This suggests that our Mg atomic model is appropriate for investigating\nthe NLTE formation of the H-band Mg lines. The NLTE corrections for the Mg I\nH-band lines are sensitive to the surface gravity, becoming larger for smaller\nlog g values, and strong lines are more susceptible to departures from LTE. For\ncool giants, NLTE corrections tend to be negative, and for the strong line at\n15765 \\AA\\ they reach -0.14 dex in our sample, and up to -0.22 dex for other\nAPOGEE stars. Our results suggest that it is important to include NLTE\ncorrections in determining Mg abundances from the H-band Mg I transitions,\nespecially when strong lines are used.\n", "  Radiative charge exchange collisions between a carbon atom C(${}^3$P) and a\nhelium ion He+, both in their ground state, are investigated theoretically.\nDetailed quantum chemistry calculations are carried out to obtain potential\nenergy curves and transition dipole matrix elements for doublet and quartet\nmolecular states of the HeC+ cation. Radiative charge transfer cross sections\nand rate coefficients are calculated and are found at thermal and lower\nenergies to be large compared to those for direct charge transfer. The present\nresults might be applicable to modelling the complex interplay of [C II] (or\nC+), C, and CO at the boundaries of interstellar photon dominated regions\n(PDRs) and in xray dominated regions (XDRs), where the abundance of He+ affects\nthe abundance of CO.\n", "  We consider wave transport phenomena in a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension\nof the periodically-kicked quantum rotator model and reveal that dynamical\nlocalization assists the unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$ phase. In the delocalized\n(quantum resonance) regime, $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is always in the broken\nphase and ratchet acceleration arises as a signature of unidirectional\nnon-Hermitian transport. An optical implementation of the periodically-kicked\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian, based on transverse beam propagation in a\npassive optical resonator with combined phase and loss gratings, is suggested\nto visualize acceleration modes in fractional Talbot cavities.\n", "  Measurements on resistivity and magnetic susceptibility have been carried out\nfor Bi single crystals under pressures up to 10.5GPa. The temperature dependent\nresistivity shows a semimetallic behavior at ambient and low pressures (below\nabout 1.6GPa). This is followed by an upturn of resistivity in low temperature\nregion when the pressure is increased, which is explained as a semiconductor\nbehavior. This feature gradually gets enhanced up to a pressure of about\n2.52GPa. Then a non-monotonic temperature dependent resistivity appears upon\nfurther increasing pressure, which is accompanied by a strong suppression to\nthe low temperature resistivity upturn. Simultaneously, a superconducting\ntransition occurs at about 3.92K under a pressure of about 2.63GPa. With\nfurther increasing pressure, a second superconducting transition emerges at\nabout 7K under about 2.8GPa. For these two superconducting states, the\nsuperconductivity induced magnetic screening volumes are quite large. As the\npressure further increased to 8.1GPa, we observe the third superconducting\ntransition at about 8.2K. The resistivity measurements under magnetic field\nallow us to determine the upper critical fields $\\mu_0 H_{c2}$ of the\nsuperconducting phases. The upper critical field for the phase with $T_c=3.92$K\nis extremely low. Based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, the\nestimated value of $\\mu_0 H_{c2}$ for this phase is about 0.103T. While the\nupper critical field for the phase with $T_c$=7K is very high with a value of\nabout 4.56T. Finally, we present a pressure dependent phase diagram of Bi\nsingle crystals. Our results reveal the interesting and rich physics in bismuth\nsingle crystals under high pressure.\n", "  The photospheric radius is one of the fundamental parameters governing the\nradiative equilibrium of a star. We report new observations of the nearest\nsolar-type stars Alpha Centauri A (G2V) and B (K1V) with the VLTI/PIONIER\noptical interferometer. The combination of four configurations of the VLTI\nenable us to measure simultaneously the limb darkened angular diameter thetaLD\nand the limb darkening parameters of the two solar-type stars in the\nnear-infrared H band (lambda = 1.65 microns). We obtain photospheric angular\ndiameters of thetaLD(A) = 8.502 +/- 0.038 mas (0.43%) and thetaLD(B) = 5.999\n+/- 0.025 mas (0.42%), through the adjustment of a power law limb darkening\nmodel. We find H band power law exponents of alpha(A) = 0.1404 +/- 0.0050\n(3.6%) and alpha(B) = 0.1545 +/- 0.0044 (2.8%), which closely bracket the\nobserved solar value (alpha_sun = 0.15027). Combined with the parallax pi =\n747.17 +/- 0.61 mas recently determined, we derive linear radii of RA = 1.2234\n+/- 0.0053 Rsun (0.43%) and RB = 0.8632 +/- 0.0037 Rsun (0.43%). The power law\nexponents that we derive for the two stars indicate a significantly weaker limb\ndarkening than predicted by both 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere models. As this\ndiscrepancy is also observed on near-infrared limb darkening profile of the\nSun, an improvement of the calibration of stellar atmosphere models is clearly\nneeded. The reported PIONIER visibility measurements of Alpha Cen A and B\nprovide a robust basis to validate the future evolutions of these models.\n", "  We investigate the zero-temperature metal-insulator transition in a\none-dimensional two-component Fermi gas in the presence of a quasi-periodic\npotential resulting from the superposition of two optical lattices of equal\nintensity but incommensurate periods. A mobility edge separating (low energy)\nAnderson localized and (high energy) extended single-particle states appears in\nthis continuous-space model beyond a critical intensity of the quasi-periodic\npotential. In order to discern the metallic phase from the insulating phase in\nthe interacting many-fermion system, we employ unbiased quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) simulations combined with the many-particle localization length familiar\nfrom the modern theory of the insulating state. In the noninteracting limit,\nthe critical optical-lattice intensity for the metal-insulator transition\npredicted by the QMC simulations coincides with the Anderson localization\ntransition of the single-particle eigenstates. We show that weak repulsive\ninteractions induce a shift of this critical point towards larger intensities,\nmeaning that repulsion favors metallic behavior. This shift appears to be\nlinear in the interaction parameter, suggesting that even infinitesimal\ninteractions can affect the position of the critical point.\n", "  The structure of the NGC 6251 jet on the milliarcsecond scale is investigated\nusing images taken with the European VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline\nArray. We detect a structural transition of the jet from a parabolic to a\nconical shape at a distance of (1-2) x 10^5 times the Schwarzschild radius from\nthe central engine, which is close to the sphere of gravitational influence of\nthe supermassive black hole (SMBH). We also examine the jet pressure profiles\nwith the synchrotron minimum energy assumption to discuss the physical origin\nof the structural transition. The NGC 6251 jet, together with the M87 jet,\nsuggests a fundamental process of structural transition in the jets of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). Collimated AGN jets are characterized by their external\ngalactic medium, showing that AGN jets interplay with the SMBH and its host\ngalaxy.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the magnetic and transport\nproperties of the Hubbard Model, and its strong coupling Heisenberg limit, on a\none-third depleted square lattice. This is the geometry occupied, after charge\nordering, by the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Ni$^{1+}$ atoms in a single layer of the\nnickelate materials La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ and (predicted) La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$. Our\nmodel is also a description of strained graphene, where a honeycomb lattice has\nbond strengths which are inequivalent. For the Heisenberg case, we determine\nthe location of the quantum critical point (QCP) where there is an onset of\nlong range antiferromagnetic order (LRAFO), and the magnitude of the order\nparameter, and then compare with results of spin wave theory. An ordered phase\nalso exists when electrons are itinerant. In this case, the growth in the\nantiferromagnetic structure factor coincides with the transition from band\ninsulator to metal in the absence of interactions.\n", "  Using a nonperturbative functional renormalization-group approach to the\ntwo-dimensional quantum O($N$) model, we compute the low-frequency limit\n$\\omega\\to 0$ of the zero-temperature conductivity in the vicinity of the\nquantum critical point. Our results are obtained from a derivative expansion to\nsecond order of a scale-dependent effective action in the presence of an\nexternal (i.e., non-dynamical) non-Abelian gauge field. While in the disordered\nphase the conductivity tensor $\\sigma(\\omega)$ is diagonal, in the ordered\nphase it is defined, when $N\\geq 3$, by two independent elements, $\\sigma_{\\rm\nA}(\\omega)$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm B}(\\omega)$, respectively associated to SO($N$)\nrotations which do and do not change the direction of the order parameter. For\n$N=2$, the conductivity in the ordered phase reduces to a single component\n$\\sigma_{\\rm A}(\\omega)$. We show that $\\lim_{\\omega\\to\n0}\\sigma(\\omega,\\delta)\\sigma_{\\rm A}(\\omega,-\\delta)/\\sigma_q^2$ is a\nuniversal number which we compute as a function of $N$ ($\\delta$ measures the\ndistance to the quantum critical point, $q$ is the charge and $\\sigma_q=q^2/h$\nthe quantum of conductance). On the other hand we argue that the ratio\n$\\sigma_{\\rm B}(\\omega\\to 0)/\\sigma_q$ is universal in the whole ordered phase,\nindependent of $N$ and, when $N\\to\\infty$, equal to the universal conductivity\n$\\sigma^*/\\sigma_q$ at the quantum critical point.\n", "  The Gaia-ESO survey (GES) is now in its fifth and last year of observations,\nand has already produced tens of thousands of high-quality spectra of stars in\nall Milky Way components. This paper presents the strategy behind the selection\nof astrophysical calibration targets, ensuring that all GES results on radial\nvelocities, atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundance ratios will be both\ninternally consistent and easily comparable with other literature results,\nespecially from other large spectroscopic surveys and from Gaia. The\ncalibration of GES is particularly delicate because of: (i) the large space of\nparameters covered by its targets, ranging from dwarfs to giants, from O to M\nstars, and with a large range of metallicities, as well as including fast\nrotators, emission line objects, stars affected by veiling and so on; (ii) the\nvariety of observing setups, with different wavelength ranges and resolution;\nand (iii) the choice of analyzing the data with many different state-of-the art\nmethods, each stronger in a different region of the parameter space, which\nensures a better understanding of systematic uncertainties. An overview of the\nGES calibration and homogenization strategy is also given, along with some\nexamples of the usage and results of calibrators in GES iDR4 - the fourth\ninternal GES data release, that will form the basis of the next GES public data\nrelease. The agreement between GES iDR4 recommended values and reference values\nfor the calibrating objects are very satisfactory. The average offsets and\nspreads are generally compatible with the GES measurement errors, which in iDR4\ndata already meet the requirements set by the main GES scientific goals.\n", "  There are two distinct breaks in the cosmic ray (CR) spectrum: the so-called\n\"knee\" around $3 \\times 10^{15}$ eV and the so-called \"ankle\" around $10^{18}$\neV. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at supernova remnant (SNR) shock fronts\nis thought to accelerate galactic CRs to energies below the knee, while an\nextragalactic origin is presumed for CRs with energies beyond the ankle. CRs\nwith energies between $3 \\times 10^{15}$ and $10^{18}$ eV, which we dub the\n\"shin,\" have an unknown origin. It has been proposed that DSA at galactic wind\ntermination shocks, rather than at SNR shocks, may accelerate CRs to these\nenergies. This paper uses the galactic wind model of Bustard et al. (2016) to\nanalyze whether galactic wind termination shocks may accelerate CRs to shin\nenergies within a reasonable acceleration time and whether such CRs can\nsubsequently diffuse back to the galaxy. We argue for acceleration times on the\norder of 100 Myrs rather than a few billion years, as assumed in some previous\nworks, and we discuss prospects for magnetic field amplification at the shock\nfront. Ultimately, we generously assume that the magnetic field is amplified to\nequipartition. This formalism allows us to obtain analytic formulae, applicable\nto any wind model, for CR acceleration. Even with generous assumptions, we find\nthat very high wind velocities are required to set up the necessary conditions\nfor acceleration beyond $10^{17}$ eV. We also estimate the luminosities of CRs\naccelerated by outflow termination shocks, including estimates for the Milky\nWay wind.\n", "  A large number of interstellar absorption features at ~ 4000\\AA\\ -- 1.8\n{\\mu}m, known as the \"diffuse interstellar bands\" (DIBs), remains unidentified.\nMost recent works relate them to large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nmolecules or ultrasmall carbonaceous grains which are also thought to be\nresponsible for the 2175 \\AA\\ extinction bump and/or the far ultraviolet (UV)\nextinction rise at $\\lambda^{-1} > 5.9\\ {\\mu}m^{-1}$. Therefore, one might\nexpect some relation between the UV extinction and DIBs. Such a relationship,\nif established, could put important constraints on the carrier of DIBs. Over\nthe past four decades, whether DIBs are related to the shape of the UV\nextinction curves has been extensively investigated. However, the results are\noften inconsistent, partly due to the inconsistencies in characterizing the UV\nextinction. Here we re-examine the connection between the UV extinction curve\nand DIBs. We compile the extinction curves and the equivalent widths of 40 DIBs\nalong 97 slightlines. We decompose the extinction curve into three Drude-like\nfunctions composed of the visible/near-infrared component, the 2175 \\AA\\ bump,\nand the far-UV extinction at $\\lambda^{-1} > 5.9\\ {\\mu}m^{-1}$. We argue that\nthe wavelength-integrated far-UV extinction derived from this decomposition\ntechnique best measures the strength of the far-UV extinction. No correlation\nis found between the far-UV extinction and most (~90\\%) of the DIBs. We have\nalso shown that the color excess E(1300-1700), the extinction difference at\n1300 \\AA\\ and 1700 \\AA\\ often used to measure the strength of the far-UV\nextinction, does not correlate with DIBs. Finally, we confirm the earlier\nfindings of no correlation between the 2175 \\AA\\ bump and DIBs or between the\n2175 \\AA\\ bump and the far-UV extinction.\n", "  The non-equilibrium dynamics of small boson ensembles in a one-dimensional\noptical lattice is explored upon a sudden quench of an additional harmonic trap\nfrom strong to weak confinement. We find that the competition between the\ninitial localization and the repulsive interaction leads to a resonant response\nof the system for intermediate quench amplitudes, corresponding to avoided\ncrossings in the many-body eigenspectrum with varying final trap frequency. In\nparticular, we show that these avoided crossings can be utilized to prepare the\nsystem in a desired state. The dynamical response is shown to depend on both\nthe interaction strength as well as the number of atoms manifesting the\nmany-body nature of the tunneling dynamics.\n", "  Resonant photoluminescence excitation (RPLE) spectra of a neutral InGaAs\nquantum dot show an unconventional line-shape that depends on the detection\npolarization. We characterize this phenomenon by performing\npolarization-dependent RPLE measurements and simulating the measured spectra\nwith a 3-level quantum model. This analysis enables us to extract the coherence\nbetween the two exciton states from the measured spectra. The good agreement\nbetween the data and model indicates that the interference between coherent\nscatterings from both fine structure split exciton states is the key to\nunderstanding this phenomenon.\n", "  We investigate flux qubits driven by a biharmonic magnetic signal, with a\nphase lag that acts as an effective time reversal broken parameter. The driving\ninduced transition rate between the ground and the excited state of the flux\nqubit can be thought as an effective transmitance, profiting from a direct\nanalogy between interference effects at avoided level crossings and scattering\nevents in disordered electronic systems. For time scales prior to full\nrelaxation but large compared to the decoherence time, this characteristic rate\nhas been accessed experimentally and its sensitivity with both the phase lag\nand the dc flux detuning explored. In this way signatures of Universal\nConductance Fluctuations-like effects have recently been analized in flux\nqubits and compared with a phenomenological model that only accounts for\ndecoherence, as a classical noise. We here solve the full dynamics of the\ndriven flux qubit in contact with a quantum bath employing the Floquet Markov\nMaster equation. Within this formalism relaxation and decoherence rates result\nstrongly dependent on both the phase lag and the dc flux detuning.\nConsequently, the associated pattern of fluctuations in the characteristic\nrates display important differences with those obtained within the mentioned\nphenomenological model. In particular we demonstrate the Weak Localization-like\neffect in the averages values of the relaxation rate. Our predictions can be\ntested for accessible, but longer time scales than the current experimental\ntimes.\n", "  We propose a procedure to obtain exact analytical solutions to the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations involving explicit time-dependent\nHermitian Hamitonians from solutions to time-independent non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian systems and the time-dependent Dyson relation together with the\ntime-dependent quasi-Hermiticity relation. We illustrate the working of this\nmethod for a simple Hermitian Rabi-type model by relating it to a non-Hermitian\ntime-independent system corresponding to the one-site lattice Yang-Lee model.\n", "  A major goal of axion searches is to reach inside the parameter space region\nof realistic axion models. Currently, the boundaries of this region depend on\nsomewhat arbitrary criteria, and it would be desirable to specify them in terms\nof precise phenomenological requirements. We consider hadronic axion models and\nclassify the representations $R_Q$ of the new heavy quarks $Q$. By requiring\nthat $i)$ the $Q$ are sufficiently short lived to avoid issues with long lived\nstrongly interacting relics, $ii)$ no Landau poles are induced below the Planck\nscale, fifteen cases are selected, which define a phenomenologically preferred\naxion window bounded by a maximum (minimum) value of the axion-photon coupling\nabout twice (four times) larger than commonly assumed. Allowing for more than\none $R_Q$, larger couplings, as well as complete axion-photon decoupling,\nbecome possible.\n", "  We study a multi-component dark matter model where interactions with the\nStandard Model are primarily via the Higgs boson. The model contains\nvector-like fermions charged under $SU(2)_W \\times U(1)_Y$ and under the dark\ngauge group, $U(1)^\\prime$. This results in two dark matter candidates. A\nspin-1 and a spin-1/2 candidate, which have loop and tree-level couplings to\nthe Higgs, respectively. We explore the resulting effect on the dark matter\nrelic abundance, while also evaluating constraints on the Higgs invisible width\nand from direct detection experiments. Generally, we find that this model is\nhighly constrained when the fermionic candidate is the predominant fraction of\nthe dark matter relic abundance.\n", "  Recent papers have shown that a small systematic redshift shift ($\\Delta\nz\\sim 10^{-5}$) in measurements of type Ia supernovae can cause a significant\nbias ($\\sim$1\\%) in the recovery of cosmological parameters. Such a redshift\nshift could be caused, for example, by a gravitational redshift due to the\ndensity of our local environment. The sensitivity of supernova data to redshift\nshifts means supernovae make excellent probes of inhomogeneities. We therefore\ninvert the analysis, and try to diagnose the nature of our local gravitational\nenvironment by fitting for $\\Delta z$ as an extra free parameter alongside the\nusual cosmological parameters.\n", "  We investigate the quantum radiation produced by an Unruh-De Witt detector in\na uniformly accelerating motion coupled to the vacuum fluctuations. Quantum\nradiation is nonvanishing, which is consistent with the previous calculation by\nLin and Hu [Phys. Rev. D 73, 124018 (2006)]. We infer that this quantum\nradiation from the Unruh-De Witt detector is generated by the nonlocal\ncorrelation of the Minkowski vacuum state, which has its origin in the\nentanglement of the state between the left and the right Rindler wedges.\n", "  Tomographic intensity mapping of the HI using the redshifted 21 cm\nobservations opens up a new window towards our understanding of cosmological\nbackground evolution and structure formation. This is a key science goal of\nseveral upcoming radio telescopes including the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).\nIn this article we focus on the post-reionization signal and investigate the of\ncross correlating the 21 cm signal with other tracers of the large scale\nstructure. We consider the cross-correlation of the post-reionization 21 cm\nsignal with the Lyman-alpha forest, Lyman-break galaxies and late time\nanisotropies in the CMBR maps like weak lensing and the Integrated Sachs Wolfe\neffect. We study the feasibility of detecting the signal and explore the\npossibility of obtaining constraints on cosmological models using it.\n", "  The magnetic geometry of the surface magnetic fields of more than 55 cool\nstars have now been mapped using spectropolarimetry. In order to better\nunderstand these observations, we compare the magnetic field topology at\ndifferent surface scale sizes of observed and simulated cool stars. For ease of\ncomparison between the high-resolution non-potential magnetofrictional\nsimulations and the relatively low-resolution observations, we filter out the\nsmall-scale field in the simulations using a spherical harmonics decomposition.\nWe show that the large-scale field topologies of the solar-based simulations\nproduce values of poloidal/toroidal fields and fractions of energy in\naxisymmetric modes that are similar to the observations. These global\nnon-potential evolution model simulations capture key magnetic features of the\nobserved solar-like stars through the processes of surface flux transport and\nmagnetic flux emergence. They do not, however, reproduce the magnetic field of\nM-dwarfs or stars with dominantly toroidal field. Furthermore, we analyse the\nmagnetic field topologies of individual spherical harmonics for the simulations\nand discover that the dipole is predominately poloidal, while the quadrupole\nshows the highest fraction of toroidal fields. Magnetic field structures\nsmaller than a quadrupole display a fixed ratio between the poloidal and\ntoroidal magnetic energies.\n", "  Asteroseismology probes the interiors of stars by studying oscillation modes\nat a star's surface. Although pulsation spectra are well understood for\nsolar-like oscillators, a substantial fraction of red giant stars observed by\nKepler exhibit abnormally low-amplitude dipole oscillation modes. Fuller et al.\n(2015) suggests this effect is produced by strong core magnetic fields that\nscatter dipole internal gravity waves (IGWs) into higher multipole IGWs or\nmagnetic waves. In this paper, we study the interaction of IGWs with a magnetic\nfield to test this mechanism. We consider two background stellar structures:\none with a uniform magnetic field, and another with a magnetic field that\nvaries both horizontally and vertically. We derive analytic solutions to the\nwave propagation problem and validate them with numerical simulations. In both\ncases, we find perfect conversion from IGWs into magnetic waves when the IGWs\npropagate into a region exceeding a critical magnetic field strength. Downward\npropagating IGWs cannot reflect into upward propagating IGWs because their\nvertical wavenumber never approaches zero. Instead, they are converted into\nupward propagating slow (Alfvenic) waves, and we show they will likely\ndissipate as they propagate back into weakly magnetized regions. Therefore,\nstrong internal magnetic fields can produce dipole mode suppression in red\ngiants, and gravity modes will likely be totally absent from the pulsation\nspectra of sufficiently magnetized stars.\n", "  We study the dynamics of galaxy mergers, with emphasis on the gas feeding of\nnuclear regions, using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy\nencounters. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the simulations allows\nus to not only recover the standard picture of tidal-torque induced inflows,\nbut also to detail another, important feeding path produced by ram pressure.\nThe induced shocks effectively decouple the dynamics of the gas from that of\nthe stars, greatly enhancing the loss of gas angular momentum and leading to\nincreased central inflows. The ram-pressure shocks also cause, in many cases,\nthe entire galactic gas disc of the smaller galaxy to abruptly change its\ndirection of rotation, causing a complete \"flip\" and, several $10^8$ yr later,\na subsequent \"counter-flip\". This phenomenon results in the existence of\nlong-lived decoupled gas-stellar and stellar-stellar discs, which could hint at\na new explanation for the origin of some of the observed kinematically\ndecoupled cores/counter-rotating discs. Lastly, we speculate, in the case of\nnon-coplanar mergers, on the possible existence of a new class of remnant\nsystems similar to some of the observed X-shaped radio galaxies.\n", "  In order to reveal the origin of the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) that are\nfrequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we perform\ntwo-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the line-driven disk\nwinds, which are accelerated by the radiation force due to the spectral lines.\nThe line-driven winds are successfully launched for the range of $M_{\\rm\nBH}=10^{6-9}M_\\odot$ and $\\varepsilon$=0.1-0.5, and the resulting mass outflow\nrate ($\\dot{M_{\\rm w}}$), momentum flux ($\\dot{p_{\\rm w}}$), and kinetic\nluminosity ($\\dot{E_{\\rm w}}$) are in the region containing 90% of the\nposterior probability distribution in the $\\dot M_{\\rm w}$-$L_{\\rm bol}$ plane,\n$\\dot p_{\\rm w}$-$L_{\\rm bol}$ plane, and $\\dot E_{\\rm w}$-$L_{\\rm bol}$ plane\nshown in Gofford et al., where $M_{\\rm BH}$ is the black hole mass,\n$\\varepsilon$ is the Eddington ratio, and $L_{\\rm bol}$ is the bolometric\nluminosity. The best-fitting relations in Gofford et al., $d\\log\\dot{M_{\\rm\nw}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim 0.9$, $d\\log\\dot{p_{\\rm w}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim\n1.2$, and $d\\log\\dot{E_{\\rm w}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim 1.5$, are roughly\nconsistent with our results, $d\\log\\dot{M_{\\rm w}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim 9/8$,\n$d\\log\\dot{p_{\\rm w}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim 10/8$, and $d\\log\\dot{E_{\\rm\nw}}/d\\log{L_{\\rm bol}}\\sim 11/8$. In addition, our model predicts that no UFO\nfeatures are detected for the AGNs with $\\varepsilon \\lesssim 0.01$, since the\nwinds do not appear. Also, only AGNs with $M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^8 M_\\odot$\nexhibit the UFOs when $\\varepsilon \\sim 0.025$. These predictions nicely agree\nwith the X-ray observations (Gofford et al.). These results support that the\nline-driven disk wind is the origin of the UFOs.\n", "  Astrometric data from the recent Gaia Data Release 1 has been matched against\nthe sample of stars from Kepler with known rotation periods. A total of 1,299\nbright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good\nastrometric solutions, most with temperatures hotter than 5000 K. From these\nsources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute\nG-band magnitudes. These main sequence stars show a bimodality in their\nrotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr\nrotation-isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found\nin cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars\ndue to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the\nrotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting the period\nbimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ~300pc of the Sun,\nrather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the\nunique power for understanding stellar populations by combining temporal\nmonitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.\n", "  Anisotropies in distortions to the frequency spectrum of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) can be created through spatially varying heating processes in\nthe early Universe. For instance, the dissipation of small-scale acoustic modes\ndoes create distortion anisotropies, in particular for non-Gaussian primordial\nperturbations. In this work, we derive approximations that allow describing the\nassociated distortion field. We provide a systematic formulation of the problem\nusing Fourier-space window functions, clarifying and generalizing previous\napproximations. Our expressions highlight the fact that the amplitudes of the\nspectral-distortion fluctuations induced by non-Gaussianity depend also on the\nhomogeneous value of those distortions. Absolute measurements are thus required\nto obtain model-independent distortion constraints on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. We also include a simple description for the evolution of\ndistortions through photon diffusion, showing that these corrections can\nusually be neglected. Our formulation provides a systematic framework for\ncomputing higher order correlation functions of distortions with CMB\ntemperature anisotropies and can be extended to describe correlations with\npolarization anisotropies.\n", "  We study feedback during massive star formation using semi-analytic methods,\nconsidering the effects of disk winds, radiation pressure, photoevaporation and\nstellar winds, while following protostellar evolution in collapsing massive gas\ncores. We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5. However,\nradiation pressure is also significant to widen the outflow cavity causing\nreductions of SFE compared to the disk-wind only case, especially for >100Msun\nstar formation at clump mass surface densities Sigma<0.3g/cm2. Photoevaporation\nis of relatively minor importance due to dust attenuation of ionizing photons.\nStellar winds have even smaller effects during the accretion stage. For core\nmasses Mc~10-1000Msun and Sigma~0.1-3g/cm2, we find the overall SFE to be\n0.31(Rc/0.1pc)^{-0.39}, potentially a useful sub-grid star-formation model in\nsimulations that can resolve pre-stellar core radii,\nRc=0.057(Mc/60Msun)^{1/2}(Sigma/g/cm2)^{-1/2}pc. The decline of SFE with Mc is\ngradual with no evidence for a maximum stellar-mass set by feedback processes\nup to stellar masses of ~300Msun. We thus conclude that the observed truncation\nof the high-mass end of the IMF is shaped mostly by the pre-stellar core mass\nfunction or internal stellar processes. To form massive stars with the observed\nmaximum masses of ~150-300Msun, initial core masses need to be >500-1000Msun.\nWe also apply our feedback model to zero-metallicity primordial star formation,\nshowing that, in the absence of dust, photoevaporation staunches accretion at\n~50Msun. Our model implies radiative feedback is most significant at\nmetallicities ~10^{-2}Zsun, since both radiation pressure and photoevaporation\nare effective in this regime.\n", "  The RXTE observed four outbursts of the accreting X-ray binary transient\nsource, GX 304-1 in 2010 and 2011. We present results of detailed 3-100 keV\nspectral analysis of 69 separate observations, and report a positive\ncorrelation between cyclotron line parameters, as well as other spectral\nparameters, with power law flux. The cyclotron line energy, width and depth\nversus flux, and thus luminosity, correlations show a flattening of the\nrelationships with increasing luminosity, which are well described by\nquasi-spherical or disk accretion that yield the surface magnetic field to be\n~60 keV. Since HEXTE cluster A was fixed aligned with the PCA field of view and\ncluster B was fixed viewing a background region 1.5 degrees off of the source\ndirection during these observations near the end of the RXTE mission, the\ncluster A background was estimated from cluster B events using HEXTEBACKEST.\nThis made possible the detection of the ~55 keV cyclotron line and an accurate\nmeasurement of the continuum. Correlations of all spectral parameters with the\nprimary 2-10 keV power law flux reveal it to be the primary driver of the\nspectral shape. The accretion is found to be in the collisionless shock braking\nregime.\n", "  We study the evolution of higher-order nonclassicality and entanglement\ncriteria in atmospheric fluctuating-loss channels. By formulating input-output\nrelations for the matrix of moments, we investigate the influence of such\nchannels on the corresponding quantumness criteria. This generalization of our\nprevious work on Gaussian entanglement [M. Bohmann et al., Phys. Rev. A 94,\n010302(R) (2016)] not only exploits second-order-based scenarios, but it also\nprovides a detailed investigation of nonclassicality and entanglement in\nnon-Gaussian and multimode radiation fields undergoing a fluctuating\nattenuation. That is, various examples of criteria and states are studied in\ndetail, unexpected effects, e.g., the dependency of the squeezing transfer on\nthe coherent displacement, are discovered, and it is demonstrated that\nnon-Gaussian entanglement can be more robust against atmospheric losses than\nGaussian one. Additionally, we propose a detection scheme for measuring the\nconsidered moments after propagation through the atmosphere. Therefore, our\nresults may help to develop, improve, and optimize non-Gaussian sources of\nquantum light for applications in free-space quantum communication.\n", "  We analyse the cluster luminosity functions (CLFs) of the youngest star\nclusters in three galaxies exhibiting prominent circumnuclear starburst rings.\nWe focus specifically on NGC 1512 and NGC 6951, for which we have access to\nH$\\alpha$ data that allow us to unambiguously identify the youngest sample\nclusters. To place our results on a firm statistical footing, we first explore\nin detail a number of important technical issues affecting the process from\nconverting the observational data into the spectral-energy distributions of the\nobjects in our final catalogues. The CLFs of the young clusters in both\ngalaxies exhibit approximate power-law behaviour down to the 90 per cent\nobservational completeness limits, thus showing that star cluster formation in\nthe violent environments of starburst rings appears to proceed similarly as\nthat elsewhere in the local Universe. We discuss this result in the context of\nthe density of the interstellar medium in our starburst-ring galaxies.\n", "  We present a new model for the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy,\nthe Magellanic Clouds and the intergalactic medium (IGM) that can be used to\nestimate distances to real or simulated pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nbased on their dispersion measure (DM). The Galactic model has an extended\nthick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk\nrepresenting the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to\nGalactic HII regions, a Galactic Center disk and seven local features including\nthe Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from\nthe Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the\nmodel. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189\npulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used\nfor the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the\nuncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and\nwithin 20\\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that\n95\\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less\nthan a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the\nTC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all\nmeasures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are\nestimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and\nFRBs.\n", "  We discuss the nodal structure of odd-parity superconductors in the presence\nof non-symmorphic crystal symmetries, both with and without spin-orbit\ncoupling, and with and without time reversal symmetry. We comment on the\nrelation of our work to previous work in the literature, and also the\nimplications for unconventional superconductors such as UPt$_3$.\n", "  We present the Grackle chemistry and cooling library for astrophysical\nsimulations and models. Grackle provides a treatment of non-equilibrium\nprimordial chemistry and cooling for H, D, and He species, including H2\nformation on dust grains; tabulated primordial and metal cooling; multiple UV\nbackground models; and support for radiation transfer and arbitrary heat\nsources. The library has an easily implementable interface for simulation codes\nwritten in C, C++, and Fortran as well as a Python interface with added\nconvenience functions for semi-analytical models. As an open-source project,\nGrackle provides a community resource for accessing and disseminating\nastrochemical data and numerical methods. We present the full details of the\ncore functionality, the simulation and Python interfaces, testing\ninfrastructure, performance, and range of applicability. Grackle is a fully\nopen-source project and new contributions are welcome.\n", "  Although Monte Carlo calculations using Importance Sampling have matured into\nthe most widely employed method for determining first principle results in QCD,\nthey spectacularly fail for theories with a sign problem or for which certain\nrare configurations play an important role. Non-Markovian Random walks, based\nupon iterative refinements of the density-of-states, overcome such overlap\nproblems. I will review the Linear Logarithmic Relaxation (LLR) method and, in\nparticular, focus onto ergodicity and exponential error suppression.\nApplications include the high-state Potts model, SU(2) and SU(3) Yang-Mills\ntheories as well as a quantum field theory with a strong sign problem: QCD at\nfinite densities of heavy quarks.\n", "  We present a new sample of strong gravitational lens systems where both the\nforeground lenses and background sources are early-type galaxies. Using imaging\nfrom HST/ACS and Keck/NIRC2, we model the surface brightness distributions and\nshow that the sources form a distinct population of massive, compact galaxies\nat redshifts $0.4 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.7$, lying systematically below the\nsize-mass relation of the global elliptical galaxy population at those\nredshifts. These may therefore represent relics of high-redshift red nuggets or\ntheir partly-evolved descendants. We exploit the magnifying effect of lensing\nto investigate the structural properties, stellar masses and stellar\npopulations of these objects with a view to understanding their evolution. We\nmodel these objects parametrically and find that they generally require two\nS\\'ersic components to properly describe their light profiles, with one more\nspheroidal component alongside a more envelope-like component, which is\nslightly more extended though still compact. This is consistent with the\nhypothesis of the inside-out growth of these objects via minor mergers. We also\nfind that the sources can be characterised by red-to-blue colour gradients as a\nfunction of radius which are stronger at low redshift -- indicative of ongoing\naccretion -- but that their environments generally appear consistent with that\nof the general elliptical galaxy population, contrary to recent suggestions\nthat these objects are predominantly associated with clusters.\n", "  We take the JUNO experiment as an example to explore nuclearites in the\nfuture large liquid scintillator detector. Comparing to the previous\ncalculations, the visible energy of nuclearites across the liquid scintillator\nwill be reestimated for the liquid scintillator based detector. Then the JUNO\nsensitivities to the nuclearite flux are presented. It is found that the JUNO\nprojected sensitivities can be better than $7.7 \\times 10^{-17} {\\rm cm^{-2}\ns^{-1} sr^{-1}}$ for the nuclearite mass $10^{15} \\; {\\rm GeV} \\leq M \\leq\n10^{24}$ GeV and initial velocity $10^{-4} \\leq \\beta_0 \\leq 10^{-1}$ with a 20\nyear running. Note that the JUNO will give the most stringent limits for\ndowngoing nuclearites with $1.6 \\times 10^{13} \\; {\\rm GeV} \\leq M \\leq 4.0\n\\times 10^{15}$ GeV and a typical galactic velocity $\\beta_0 = 10^{-3}$.\n", "  We numerically examine the transport of an assembly of active run-and-tumble\ndisks interacting with a traveling wave substrate. We show that as a function\nof substrate strength, wave speed, disk activity, and disk density, a variety\nof dynamical phases arise that are correlated with the structure and net flux\nof disks. We find that there is a sharp transition into a state where the disks\nare only partially coupled to the substrate and form a phase separated cluster\nstate. This transition is associated with a drop in the net disk flux and can\noccur as a function of the substrate speed, maximum substrate force, disk run\ntime, and disk density. Since variation of the disk activity parameters\nproduces different disk drift rates for a fixed traveling wave speed on the\nsubstrate, the system we consider could be used as an efficient method for\nactive matter species separation. Within the cluster phase, we find that in\nsome regimes the motion of the cluster center of mass is in the opposite\ndirection to that of the traveling wave, while when the maximum substrate force\nis increased, the cluster drifts in the direction of the traveling wave. This\nsuggests that swarming or clustering motion can serve as a method by which an\nactive system can collectively move against an external drift.\n", "  A common assumption is that galaxies fall in two distinct regions on a plot\nof specific star-formation rate (SSFR) versus galaxy stellar mass: a\nstar-forming Galaxy Main Sequence (GMS) and a separate region of `passive' or\n`red and dead galaxies'. Starting from a volume-limited sample of nearby\ngalaxies designed to contain most of the stellar mass in this volume, and thus\nbeing a fair representation of the Universe at the end of 12 billion years of\ngalaxy evolution, we investigate the distribution of galaxies in this diagram\ntoday. We show that galaxies follow a strongly curved extended GMS with a steep\nnegative slope at high galaxy stellar masses. There is a gradual change in the\nmorphologies of the galaxies along this distribution, but there is no clear\nbreak between early-type and late-type galaxies. Examining the other evidence\nthat there are two distinct populations, we argue that the `red sequence' is\nthe result of the colours of galaxies changing very little below a critical\nvalue of the SSFR, rather than implying a distinct population of galaxies, and\nthat Herschel observations, which show at least half of early-type galaxies\ncontain a cool interstellar medium, also imply continuity between early-type\nand late-type galaxies. This picture of a unitary population of galaxies\nrequires more gradual evolutionary processes than the rapid quenching processes\nneeded to to explain two distinct populations. We challenge theorists to\nreproduce the properties of this `Galaxy End Sequence'.\n", "  The OVI $\\lambda\\lambda$1032, 1038\\AA\\ doublet emission traces collisionally\nionized gas with $T\\approx 10^{5.5}$ K, where the cooling curve peaks for\nmetal-enriched plasma. This warm-hot phase is usually not well-resolved in\nnumerical simulations of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), but can be\nresponsible for a significant fraction of the emitted energy. Comparing\nsimulated OVI emission to observations is therefore a valuable test of whether\nsimulations predict reasonable cooling rates from this phase. We calculate OVI\n$\\lambda$1032\\AA\\ emission, assuming collisional ionization equilibrium, for\nour small-box simulations of the stratified ISM regulated by supernovae. We\nfind that the agreement is very good for our solar neighborhood model, both in\nterms of emission flux and mean OVI density seen in absorption. We explore runs\nwith higher surface densities and find that, in our simulations, the OVI\nemission from the disk scales roughly linearly with the star formation rate.\nObservations of OVI emission are rare for external galaxies, but our results do\nnot show obvious inconsistency with the existing data. Assuming the solar\nmetallicity, OVI emission from the galaxy disk in our simulations accounts for\nroughly 0.5\\% of supernovae heating.\n", "  One of the most powerful probes of new physics is the polarized Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB). The detection of a nonzero polarization angle\nrotation between the CMB surface of last scattering and today could provide\nevidence of Lorentz-violating physics. The purpose of this paper is twofold.\nFirst we review one popular mechanism for polarization rotation of CMB photons:\nthe pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. Second, we propose a method to use the\nPolarbear experiment to constrain Lorentz-violating physics in the context of\nthe Standard-Model Extension, a framework to standardize a large class of\npotential Lorentz-violating terms in particle physics.\n", "  A version of the configuration interaction (CI) method is developed which\ntreats highly excited many-electron basis states perturbatively, so that their\ninclusion does not affect the size of the CI matrix. This removes, at least in\nprinciple, the main limitation of the CI method in dealing with many-electron\natoms or ions. We perform calculations of the spectra of iodine and its ions,\ntungsten, and ytterbium as examples of atoms with open $s$, $p$, $d$ and\n$f$-shells. Good agreement of the calculated data with experiment illustrates\nthe power of the method. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.\n", "  Circumbinary planets are generally more likely to transit than equivalent\nsingle-star planets, but practically the geometry and orbital dynamics of\ncircumbinary planets make the chance of observing a transit inherently\ntime-dependent. In this follow-up paper to Martin & Triaud (2015), the\ntime-dependence is probed deeper by analytically calculating when and for how\nlong the binary and planet orbits overlap, allowing for transits to occur. The\nderived equations are applied to the known transiting circumbinary planets\nfound by Kepler to predict when future transits will occur, and whether they\nwill be observable by upcoming space telescopes TESS, CHEOPS and PLATO. The\nmajority of these planets spend less than 50% of their time in a transiting\nconfiguration, some less than 20%. From this it is calculated that the known\nKepler eclipsing binaries likely host an additional ~ 17 - 30 circumbinary\nplanets that are similar to the ten published discoveries, and they will\nultimately transit some day, potentially during the TESS and PLATO surveys.\n", "  The Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) sample of white dwarf parallaxes is presented,\nincluding 6 directly observed degenerates and 46 white dwarfs in wide binaries.\nThis data set is combined with spectroscopic atmospheric parameters to study\nthe white dwarf mass-radius relationship (MRR). Gaia parallaxes and G\nmagnitudes are used to derive model atmosphere dependent white dwarf radii,\nwhich can then be compared to the predictions of a theoretical MRR. We find a\ngood agreement between Gaia DR1 parallaxes, published effective temperatures\n(Teff) and surface gravities (log g), and theoretical MRRs. As it was the case\nfor Hipparcos, the precision of the data does not allow for the\ncharacterisation of hydrogen envelope masses. The uncertainties on the\nspectroscopic atmospheric parameters are found to dominate the error budget and\ncurrent error estimates for well-known and bright white dwarfs may be slightly\noptimistic. With the much larger Gaia DR2 white dwarf sample it will be\npossible to explore the MRR over a much wider range of mass, Teff, and spectral\ntypes.\n", "  Theoretical models predict that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can be\nefficient dust producers (0.1-1.0 Msun), potentially accounting for most of the\ndust production in the early Universe. Observational evidence for this dust\nproduction efficiency is however currently limited to only a few CCSN remnants\n(e.g., SN1987A, Crab Nebula). In this paper, we revisit the dust mass produced\nin Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a ~330-year old O-rich Galactic supernova remnant\n(SNR) embedded in a dense interstellar foreground and background. We present\nthe first spatially resolved analysis of Cas A based on Spitzer and Herschel\ninfrared and submillimetre data at a common resolution of ~0.6 arcmin for this\n5 arcmin diameter remnant following a careful removal of contaminating line\nemission and synchrotron radiation. We fit the dust continuum from 17 to 500\nmicron with a four-component interstellar medium (ISM) and supernova (SN) dust\nmodel. We find a concentration of cold dust in the unshocked ejecta of Cas A\nand derive a mass of 0.3-0.5 Msun of silicate grains freshly produced in the\nSNR, with a lower limit of >=0.1-0.2 Msun. For a mixture of 50% of\nsilicate-type grains and 50% of carbonaceous grains, we derive a total SN dust\nmass between 0.4 Msun and 0.6 Msun. These dust mass estimates are higher than\nfrom most previous studies of Cas A and support the scenario of supernova\ndominated dust production at high redshifts. We furthermore derive an\ninterstellar extinction map for the field around Cas A which towards Cas A\ngives average values of A_V=6-8 mag, up to a maximum of A_V=15 mag.\n", "  In this paper we investigate environment driven gas depletion in satellite\ngalaxies, taking full advantage of the atomic hydrogen (HI) spectral stacking\ntechnique to quantify the gas content for the entire gas-poor to -rich regime.\nWe do so using a multi-wavelength sample of 10,600 satellite galaxies, selected\naccording to stellar mass (log M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\odot}$ $\\geq$ 9) and redshift\n(0.02 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 0.05) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with HI data\nfrom the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. Using key HI-to-stellar\nmass scaling relations, we present evidence that the gas content of satellite\ngalaxies is, to a significant extent, dependent on the environment in which a\ngalaxy resides. For the first time, we demonstrate that systematic\nenvironmental suppression of gas content at both fixed stellar mass and fixed\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) in satellite galaxies begins in halo masses\ntypical of the group regime (log M$_{h}$/M$_{\\odot}$ < 13.5), well before\ngalaxies reach the cluster environment. We also show that environment driven\ngas depletion is more closely associated to halo mass than local density. Our\nresults are then compared with state-of-the-art semi-analytic models and\nhydrodynamical simulations and discussed within this framework, showing that\nmore work is needed if models are to reproduce the observations. We conclude\nthat the observed decrease of gas content in the group and cluster environments\ncannot be reproduced by starvation of the gas supply alone and invoke fast\nacting processes such as ram-pressure stripping of cold gas to explain this.\n", "  In this work, we present a new investigation about the impact of intrinsic\ncharm (IC) on the physical observables, in particular, on the heavy structure\nfunction $F_2^c$. Since IC distribution is dominant at large Bjorken variable\n$x$, normally, it is expected that it can be explored only at large $x$. But,\nby studying the correlation of the charm density in the proton with $F_2^c$, we\nare going to show that the IC component can also be effective at low $x$. To\ninvestigate further, we perform three QCD global analyses of parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs), by including the EMC $F_2^c$ data that are\nrecognized as clear evidence for existence of the intrinsic charm in the\nproton, and also by considering the IC component. Although the fit of the EMC\ndata is extremely poor due to the data points with lower $x$ values, i.e. $x<\n$0.05, but these analyses can give us new information about the impact of EMC\ndata and IC contribution on the behaviour of PDFs.\n", "  An active participation of players in evolutionary games depends on several\nfactors, ranging from personal stakes to the properties of the interaction\nnetwork. Diverse activity patterns thus have to be taken into account when\nstudying the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Here we study the\nweak prisoner's dilemma game, where the activity of each player is determined\nin a probabilistic manner either by its degree or by its payoff. While\ndegree-correlated activity introduces cascading failures of cooperation that\nare particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs,\npayoff-correlated activity provides a more nuanced activity profile, which\nultimately hinders systemic breakdowns of cooperation. To determine optimal\nconditions for the evolution of cooperation, we introduce an exponential decay\nto payoff-correlated activity that determines how fast the activity of a player\nreturns to its default state. We show that there exists an intermediate decay\nrate, at which the resolution of the social dilemma is optimal. This can be\nexplained by the emerging activity patterns of players, where the inactivity of\nhubs is compensated effectively by the increased activity of average-degree\nplayers, who through their collective influence in the network sustain a higher\nlevel of cooperation. The sudden drops in the fraction of cooperators observed\nwith degree-correlated activity therefore vanish, and so does the need for the\nlengthy spatiotemporal reorganization of compact cooperative clusters. The\nabsence of such asymmetric dynamic instabilities thus leads to an optimal\nresolution of social dilemmas, especially when the conditions for the evolution\nof cooperation are strongly adverse.\n", "  We consider an alternative to conventional three-point statistics such as the\nbispectrum, which is purely based on the Fourier phases of the density field:\nthe line correlation function. This statistic directly probes the non-linear\nclustering regime and contains information highly complementary to that\ncontained in the power spectrum. In this work, we determine, for the first\ntime, its potential to constrain cosmological parameters and detect baryon\nacoustic oscillations (hereafter BAOs). We show how to compute the line\ncorrelation function for a discrete sampled set of tracers that follow a local\nLagrangian biasing scheme and demonstrate how it breaks the degeneracy between\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations and the bias parameters of the model. We\nthen derive analytic expressions for its covariance and show that it can be\nwritten as a sum of a Gaussian piece plus non-Gaussian corrections. We compare\nour predictions with a large ensemble of $N$-body simulations and confirm that\nBAOs do indeed modulate the signal of the line correlation function for scales\n$50$-$100\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$, and that the characteristic S-shape feature\nwould be detectable in upcoming Stage IV surveys at the level of $\\sim4\\sigma$.\nWe then focus on the cosmological information content and compute Fisher\nforecasts for an idealized Stage III galaxy redshift survey of volume $V\\sim\n10\\,h^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ and out to $z=1$. We show that, combining the line\ncorrelation function with the galaxy power spectrum and a Planck-like microwave\nbackground survey, yields improvements up to a factor of two for parameters\nsuch as $\\sigma_8$, $b_1$ and $b_2$, compared to using only the two-point\ninformation alone.\n", "  While most of the known debris discs present cold dust at tens of AU, a few\nyoung systems exhibit hot dust analogous to the Zodiacal dust. $\\eta$ Corvi is\nparticularly interesting as it is old and it has both, with its hot dust\nsignificantly exceeding the maximum luminosity of an in-situ collisional\ncascade. Previous work suggested that this system could be undergoing an event\nsimilar to the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) soon after or during a dynamical\ninstability. Here we present ALMA observations of $\\eta$ Corvi with a\nresolution of 1.\"2 (~22au) to study its outer belt. The continuum emission is\nconsistent with an axisymmetric belt, with a mean radius of 152au and radial\nFWHM of 46au, which is too narrow compared to models of inward scattering of an\nLHB-like scenario. Instead, the hot dust could be explained as material passed\ninwards in a rather stable planetary configuration. We also report a 4sigma\ndetection of CO at ~ 20au. CO could be released in situ from icy planetesimals\nbeing passed in when crossing the H$_2$O or CO$_2$ ice lines. Finally, we place\nconstraints on hidden planets in the disc. If a planet is sculpting the disc's\ninner edge, this should be orbiting at 75-100au, with a mass of 3-30 M$_\\oplus$\nand an eccentricity < 0.08. Such a planet would be able to clear its chaotic\nzone on a timescale shorter than the age of the system and scatter material\ninwards from the outer belt to the inner regions, thus feeding the hot dust.\n", "  We study the feasibility of detecting weak lensing spatial correlations\nbetween Supernova (SN) Type Ia magnitudes with present (Dark Energy Survey,\nDES) and future (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, LSST) surveys. We investigate\nthe angular auto-correlation function of SN magnitudes (once the background\ncosmology has been subtracted) and cross-correlation with galaxy catalogues. We\nexamine both analytical and numerical predictions, the latter using simulated\ngalaxy catalogues from the MICE Grand Challenge Simulation. We predict that we\nwill be unable to detect the SN auto-correlation in DES, while it should be\ndetectable with the LSST SN deep fields (15,000 SNe on 70 deg^2) at ~6sigma\nlevel of confidence (assuming 0.15 magnitudes of intrinsic dispersion). The\nSN-galaxy cross-correlation function will deliver much higher signal-to-noise,\nbeing detectable in both surveys with an integrated signal-to-noise of ~100 (up\nto 30 arcmin separations). We predict joint constraints on the matter density\nparameter (Omega_m) and the clustering amplitude (sigma_8) by fitting the\nauto-correlation function of our mock LSST deep fields. When assuming a\nGaussian prior for Omega_m, we can achieve a 25% measurement of sigma_8 from\njust these LSST supernovae (assuming 0.15 magnitudes of intrinsic dispersion).\nThese constraints will improve significantly if the intrinsic dispersion of SNe\nIa can be reduced.\n", "  A magnetic field was recently shown to enhance field-parallel heat conduction\nin a strongly correlated plasma whereas cross-field conduction is reduced. Here\nwe show that in such plasmas, the magnetic field has the additional effect of\ninhibiting the isotropization process between field-parallel and cross-field\ntemperature components thus leading to the emergence of strong and long-lived\ntemperature anisotropies when the plasma is locally perturbed. An extended heat\nequation is shown to describe this process accurately.\n", "  SuWt 2 is a planetary nebula consisting of a bright ring-like waist from\nwhich protrude faint extended lobes - a morphology believed to be typical of\nprogenitors which have experienced a close-binary evolution. Previous\nobservations of NSV 19992, the star at the projected centre of SuWt 2, have\nfound it to comprise two A-type stars in a 4.9 day eclipsing orbit, neither of\nwhich could be the nebular progenitor. Radial velocity studies provided a hint\nthat the systemic velocity of this double A-type binary might be varying over\ntime, suggesting the presence of a third component hypothesised to be the\nnebular progenitor. Here, we present an extensive radial velocity monitoring\nstudy of NSV 19992, performed with the high-resolution echelle spectrograph\nUVES mounted on ESO's VLT, in order to constrain the possible variation in the\nsystemic velocity of the A-type binary and its relation to the progenitor of\nSuWt 2. The observations, acquired over a period of approximately one year,\nshow no evidence of variability in the systemic velocity of NSV 19992.\nCombining these new observations with previous high-resolution spectroscopy\ndemonstrates that the systemic velocity is also stable over much longer periods\nand, moreover, is distinct from that of SuWt 2, strongly indicating that the\ntwo are not associated. We conclude that NSV 19992 is merely a field star\nsystem, by chance lying in the same line of sight as the nebular centre, and\nthat it bares no relation to SuWt 2 or its, as yet unidentified, central\nstar(s).\n", "  A crucial step in planet hunting surveys is to select the best candidates for\nfollow up observations, given limited telescope resources. This is often\nperformed by human `eyeballing', a time consuming and statistically awkward\nprocess. Here we present a new, fast machine learning technique to separate\ntrue planet signals from astrophysical false positives. We use Self Organising\nMaps (SOMs) to study the transit shapes of \\emph{Kepler} and \\emph{K2} known\nand candidate planets. We find that SOMs are capable of distinguishing known\nplanets from known false positives with a success rate of 87.0\\%, using the\ntransit shape alone. Furthermore, they do not require any candidates to be\ndispositioned prior to use, meaning that they can be used early in a mission's\nlifetime. A method for classifying candidates using a SOM is developed, and\napplied to previously unclassified members of the \\emph{Kepler} KOI list as\nwell as candidates from the \\emph{K2} mission. The method is extremely fast,\ntaking minutes to run the entire KOI list on a typical laptop. We make\n\\texttt{Python} code for performing classifications publicly available, using\neither new SOMs or those created in this work. The SOM technique represents a\nnovel method for ranking planetary candidate lists, and can be used both alone\nor as part of a larger autovetting code.\n", "  We report results of an extended spectropolarimetric and photometric\nmonitoring of the weak-line T Tauri star V830 Tau and its recently-detected\nnewborn close-in giant planet. Our observations, carried out within the MaTYSSE\nprogramme, were spread over 91d, and involved the ESPaDOnS and Narval\nspectropolarimeters linked to the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii, the 2m Bernard\nLyot and the 8-m Gemini-North Telescopes. Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we\ncharacterize the surface brightness distributions, magnetic topologies and\nsurface differential rotation of V830 Tau at the time of our observations, and\ndemonstrate that both distributions evolve with time beyond what is expected\nfrom differential rotation. We also report that near the end of our\nobservations, V830 Tau triggered one major flare and two weaker precursors,\nshowing up as enhanced red-shifted emission in multiple spectral activity\nproxies. With 3 different filtering techniques, we model the radial velocity\n(RV) activity jitter (of semi-amplitude 1.2km/s) that V830 Tau generates,\nsuccessfully retrieve the 68m/s RV planet signal hiding behind the jitter,\nfurther confirm the existence of V830 Tau b and better characterize its orbital\nparameters. We find that the method based on Gaussian-process regression\nperforms best thanks to its higher ability at modelling not only the activity\njitter, but also its temporal evolution over the course of our observations,\nand succeeds at reproducing our RV data down to a rms precision of 35m/s. Our\nresult provides new observational constraints on scenarios of star / planet\nformation and demonstrates the scientific potential of large-scale searches for\nclose-in giant planets around T Tauri stars.\n", "  We present the results of a study of a large sample of A and Am stars with\nspectral types from LAMOST and light curves from WASP. We find that, unlike\nnormal A stars, $\\delta$ Sct pulsations in Am stars are mostly confined to the\neffective temperature range 6900 $<$ $T_{\\rm eff}$ $<$ 7600 K. We find evidence\nthat the incidence of pulsations in Am stars decreases with increasing\nmetallicism (degree of chemical peculiarity). The maximum amplitude of the\npulsations in Am stars does not appear to vary significantly with metallicism.\nThe amplitude distributions of the principal pulsation frequencies for both A\nand Am stars appear very similar and agree with results obtained from Kepler\nphotometry. We present evidence that suggests turbulent pressure is the main\ndriving mechanism in pulsating Am stars, rather than the $\\kappa$-mechanism,\nwhich is expected to be suppressed by gravitational settling in these stars.\n", "  Context: Results from previous searches for new meteor showers in the\ncombined Croatian Meteor Network and SonotaCo meteor databases suggested\npossible parent bodies for several newly identified showers. Aims: We aim to\nperform an analysis to validate the connection between the identified showers\nand candidate parent bodies. Methods: Simulated particles were ejected from\ncandidate parent bodies, a dynamical modeling was performed and the results\nwere compared to the real meteor shower observations. Results: From the 13\nanalysed cases, three were found to be connected with comets, four with\nasteroids which are possibly dormant comets, four were inconclusive or\nnegative, and two need more observational data before any conclusions can be\ndrawn.\n", "  Star formation in galaxies at the center of cooling-flow galaxy clusters is\nan important phenomenon in the context of formation and evolution of massive\ngalaxies in the Universe. Yet, star formation rates (SFRs) in such systems\ncontinue to be elusive. We use our Bayesian-motivated spectral energy\ndistribution (SED)-fitting code, BAYESCOOL, to estimate the plausible SFR\nvalues in the brightest cluster galaxy of a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy\ncluster, Phoenix. Previous studies of Phoenix have resulted in the highest\nmeasurement of SFR for any galaxy, with the estimates reaching up to 1000 solar\nmasses/yr. However, a very small number of models have been considered in those\nstudies. BAYESCOOL allows us to probe a large parameter space. We consider two\nmodels for star formation history, instantaneous bursts and continuous star\nformation, a wide range of ages for the old and the young stellar population,\nalong with other discrete parameters, such as the initial mass function,\nmetallicities, internal extinction and extinction law. We find that in the\nabsence of any prior except that the maximum cooling rate < 3000 solar\nmasses/yr, the SFR lies in the range (2230-2890) solar masses/yr. If we impose\nan observational prior on the internal extinction, E(B-V) < 0.6, the best-fit\nSFR lies in (454-494) solar masses/yr, and we consider this as the most\nprobable range of SFR values for Phoenix. The SFR dependence on the extinction\nis a reflection of the standard age-extinction degeneracy, which can be\novercome by using a prior on one of the two quantities in question.\n", "  We analyse the effect on adiabatic stellar oscillation frequencies of\nreplacing the near-surface layers in 1D stellar structure models with averaged\n3D stellar surface convection simulations. The main difference is an expansion\nof the atmosphere by 3D convection, expected to explain a major part of the\nasteroseismic surface effect; a systematic overestimation of p-mode frequencies\ndue to inadequate surface physics.\n  We employ pairs of 1D stellar envelope models and 3D simulations from a\nprevious calibration of the mixing-length parameter, alpha. That calibration\nconstitutes the hitherto most consistent matching of 1D models to 3D\nsimulations, ensuring that their differences are not spurious, but entirely due\nto the 3D nature of convection. The resulting frequency shift is identified as\nthe structural part of the surface effect. The important, typically\nnon-adiabatic, modal components of the surface effect are not included in the\npresent analysis, but relegated to future papers.\n  Evaluating the structural surface effect at the frequency of maximum mode\namplitude, $\\nu_{\\rm max}$, we find shifts from $\\delta\\nu$=-0.8 microHz for\ngiants at $\\log g$=2.2 to -35 microHz for a ($T_{\\rm eff}=6901$ K, $\\log\ng$=4.29) dwarf. The fractional effect $\\delta\\nu(\\nu_{\\rm max})/\\nu_{\\rm max}$,\nranges from -0.1% for a cool dwarf (4185 K, 4.74) to -6% for a warm giant (4962\nK, 2.20).\n", "  We revisit the integer lattice (IL) method to numerically solve the\nVlasov-Poisson equations, and show that a slight variant of the method is a\nvery easy, viable, and efficient numerical approach to study the dynamics of\nself-gravitating, collisionless systems. The distribution function lives in a\ndiscretized lattice phase-space, and each time-step in the simulation\ncorresponds to a simple permutation of the lattice sites. Hence, the method is\nLagrangian, conservative, and fully time-reversible. IL complements other\nexisting methods, such as N-body/particle mesh (computationally efficient, but\naffected by Monte-Carlo sampling noise and two-body relaxation) and finite\nvolume (FV) direct integration schemes (expensive, accurate but diffusive). We\nalso present improvements to the FV scheme, using a moving mesh approach\ninspired by IL, to reduce numerical diffusion and the time-step criterion.\nBeing a direct integration scheme like FV, IL is memory limited (memory\nrequirement for a full 3D problem scales as N^6, where N is the resolution per\nlinear phase-space dimension). However, we describe a new technique for\nachieving N^4 scaling. The method offers promise for investigating the full 6D\nphase-space of collisionless systems of stars and dark matter.\n", "  Cross sections for the charm-production reactions $\\bar p p \\to \\bar\n\\Lambda_c^- \\Sigma_c^+$, $\\bar \\Sigma_c\\Sigma_c$, $\\bar \\Xi_c\\Xi_c$, and $\\bar\n\\Xi_c'\\Xi_c'$ are presented, for energies near their respective thresholds. The\nresults are based on a calculation performed in the meson-exchange framework in\nclose analogy to earlier studies of the J\\\"ulich group on the\nstrangeness-production reactions $\\bar p p \\to \\bar \\Lambda\\Sigma$, $\\bar\n\\Sigma\\Sigma$, $\\bar \\Xi\\Xi$ by connecting the two sectors via SU(4) flavor\nsymmetry. The cross sections are found to be in the order of $0.1 - 1$ $\\mu b$\nat energies of $100$ MeV above the respective thresholds, for all considered\nchannels. Complementary to meson-exchange, where the charmed baryons are\nproduced by the exchange of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons, a charm-production potential\nderived in a quark model is employed for assessing uncertainties. The cross\nsections predicted within that picture turned out to be significantly smaller.\n", "  We consider $P(\\phi^I,X^{IJ})$ theories of multi-field inflation and ask the\nquestion of how to define the adiabatic and entropy perturbations, widely used\nin calculating the curvature and isocurvature power spectra, in this general\ncontext. It is found that when the field perturbations propagate with different\nspeeds, these adiabatic and entropy modes are not generally the fundamental\n(most natural to canonically quantise) degrees of freedom that propagate with a\nsingle speed. The alternative fields which do propagate with a single speed are\nfound to be a rotation in field space of the adiabatic and entropy\nperturbations. We show how this affects the form of the horizon-crossing power\nspectrum, when there is not a single \"adiabatic sound speed\" sourcing the\ncurvature perturbation. Special cases of our results are discussed, including\n$P(X)$ theories where the adiabatic and entropy perturbations are fundamental.\nWe finally look at physical motivations for considering multi-speed models of\ninflation, particularly showing that disformal couplings can naturally lead to\nthe kind of kinetic interactions which cause fields to have different sound\nspeeds.\n", "  We report on six new Chandra observations of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula\n(PWN). The PWN consists of three distinct elongated structures - two $\\approx\n0.2 d_{250}$ pc long lateral tails and a segmented axial tail of $\\approx 0.05\nd_{250}$ pc length, where $d_{250}=d/(250 {\\rm pc})$. The photon indices of the\npower law spectra of the lateral tails, $\\Gamma \\approx 1$, are significantly\nharder than those of the pulsar ($\\Gamma \\approx 1.5$) and the axial tail\n($\\Gamma \\approx 1.6$). There is no significant diffuse X-ray emission between\nthe lateral tails -- the ratio of the X-ray surface brightness between the\nsouth tail and this sky area is at least 12. The lateral tails apparently\nconnect directly to the pulsar and show indication of moving footpoints. The\naxial tail comprises time-variable emission blobs. However, there is no\nevidence for constant or decelerated outward motion of these blobs. Different\nphysical models are consistent with the observed morphology and spectra of the\nGeminga PWN. In one scenario, the lateral tails could represent an azimuthally\nasymmetric shell whose hard emission is caused by the Fermi acceleration\nmechanism of colliding winds. In another scenario, the lateral tails could be\nluminous, bent polar outflows, while the blobs in the axial tail could\nrepresent a crushed torus. In a resemblance to planetary magnetotails, the\nblobs of the axial tail might also represent short-lived plasmoids which are\nformed by magnetic field reconnection in the relativistic plasma of the pulsar\nwind tail.\n", "  We use deep Chandra imaging to measure the distribution of X-ray luminosities\n(L_X) for samples of star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass and\nredshift, using a Bayesian method to push below the nominal X-ray detection\nlimits. Our luminosity distributions all show narrow peaks at L_X < 10^{42}\nerg/s that we associate with star formation, as opposed to AGN that are traced\nby a broad tail to higher L_X. Tracking the luminosity of these peaks as a\nfunction of stellar mass reveals an \"X-ray main sequence\" with a constant slope\n~0.63 +/- 0.03 over 8.5 < log M*/Msun < 11.5 and 0.1 < z < 4, with a\nnormalization that increases with redshift as (1+z)^{3.79+/-0.12}. We also\ncompare the peak X-ray luminosities with UV-to-IR tracers of star formation\nrates (SFRs) to calibrate the scaling between L_X and SFR. We find that L_X\n\\propto SFR^{0.83} x (1+z)^{1.3}, where the redshift evolution and\nnon-linearity likely reflect changes in high-mass X-ray binary populations of\nstar-forming galaxies. Using galaxies with a broader range of SFR, we also\nconstrain a stellar-mass-dependent contribution to L_X, likely related to\nlow-mass X-ray binaries. Using this calibration, we convert our X-ray main\nsequence to SFRs and measure a star-forming main sequence with a constant slope\n~0.76+/-0.06 and a normalization that evolves with redshift as\n(1+z)^{2.95+/-0.33}. Based on the X-ray emission, there is no evidence for a\nbreak in the main sequence at high stellar masses, although we cannot rule out\na turnover given the uncertainties in the scaling of L_X to SFR.\n", "  We present the first results from the largest H$\\alpha$ survey of star\nformation and AGN activity in galaxy clusters. Using 9 different narrow band\nfilters, we select $>3000$ H$\\alpha$ emitters within $19$ clusters and their\nlarger scale environment over a total volume of $1.3\\times10^5$ Mpc$^3$. The\nsample includes both relaxed and merging clusters, covering the $0.15-0.31$\nredshift range and spanning from $5\\times10^{14}$ $M_{\\odot}$ to\n$30\\times10^{14}$ $M_{\\odot}$. We find that the H$\\alpha$ luminosity function\n(LF) for merging clusters has a higher characteristic density $\\phi^*$ compared\nto relaxed clusters. $\\phi^*$ drops from cluster core to cluster outskirts for\nboth merging and relaxed clusters, with the merging cluster values $\\sim0.3$\ndex higher at each projected radius. The characteristic luminosity $L^*$ drops\nover the $0.5-2.0$ Mpc distance from the cluster centre for merging clusters\nand increases for relaxed objects. Among disturbed objects, clusters hosting\nlarge-scale shock waves (traced by radio relics) are overdense in H$\\alpha$\nemitters compared to those with turbulence in their intra-cluster medium\n(traced by radio haloes). We speculate that the increase in star formation\nactivity in disturbed, young, massive galaxy clusters can be triggered by\ninteractions between gas-rich galaxies, shocks and/or the intra-cluster medium,\nas well as accretion of filaments and galaxy groups. Our results indicate that\ndisturbed clusters represent vastly different environments for galaxy evolution\ncompared to relaxed clusters or average field environments.\n", "  We obtain estimates of stellar atmospheric parameters for a previously\npublished sample of 1777 relatively bright (9 < B < 14) metal-poor candidates\nfrom the Hamburg/ESO Survey. The original Frebel et al. analysis of these stars\nwas only able to derive estimates of [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] for a subset of the\nsample, due to limitations in the methodology then available. A new\nspectroscopic analysis pipeline has been used to obtain estimates of Teff, log\ng, [Fe/H], and [C/Fe] for almost the entire dataset. This sample is very local\n- about 90% of the stars are located within 0.5 kpc of the Sun. We consider the\nchemodynamical properties of these stars in concert with a similarly local\nsample of stars from a recent analysis of the Bidelman & MacConnell\n'weak-metal' candidates by Beers et al. We use this combined sample to identify\npossible members of the suggested halo stream of stars by Helmi et al. and\nChiba & Beers, as well as stars that may be associated with stripped debris\nfrom the putative parent dwarf of the globular cluster Omega Centauri,\nsuggested to exist by previous authors. We identify a clear increase in the\ncumulative frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with declining\nmetallicity, as well as an increase in the fraction of CEMP stars with distance\nfrom the Galactic plane, consistent with previous results. We also identify a\nrelatively large number of CEMP stars with kinematics consistent with the\nmetal-weak thick-disk population, with possible implications for its origin.\n", "  Binaries hosting a massive star and a non-accreting pulsar are powerful\nnon-thermal emitters due to the interaction of the pulsar and the stellar wind.\nThe winds of massive stars are thought to be inhomogeneous, which could have an\nimpact on the non-thermal emission. We study numerically the impact of the\npresence of inhomogeneities or clumps in the stellar wind on the high-energy\nnon-thermal radiation of high-mass binaries hosting a non-accreting pulsar. We\ncompute the trajectories and physical properties of the streamlines in the\nshocked pulsar wind without clumps, with a small clump, and with a large one.\nThis information is used to compute the synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission from the non-thermal populations, accounting also for the effect of\ngamma-ray absorption through pair creation. A specific study is done for PSR\nB1259-63/LS2883. When stellar wind clumps perturb the two-wind interaction\nregion, the associated non-thermal radiation in the X-ray band,of synchrotron\norigin, and in the GeV-TeV band, of inverse Compton origin, is affected by\nseveral effects: (i) strong changes in the the plasma velocity direction that\nresult in Doppler boosting factor variations, (ii) strengthening of the\nmagnetic field that mainly enhances the synchrotron radiation, (iii)\nstrengthening of the pulsar wind kinetic energy dissipation at the shock,\npotentially available for particle acceleration, and (iv) changes in the rate\nof adiabatic losses that affect the lower energy part of the non-thermal\nparticle population. The radiation above 100 GeV detected, presumably, during\nthe post-periastron crossing of the Be star disc in PSR B1259-63/LS2883, can be\nroughly reproduced assuming that the crossing of the disc is modeled as the\nencounter with a large inhomogeneity.\n", "  At low densities the standard ionisation history of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) predicts a decreasing temperature of the IGM with decreasing density once\nhydrogen (and helium) reionisation is complete. Heating the high-redshift,\nlow-density IGM above the temperature expected from photo-heating is difficult,\nand previous claims of high/rising temperatures in low density regions of the\nUniverse based on the probability density function (PDF) of the opacity in\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest data at $2<z<4$ have been met with considerable\nscepticism, particularly since they appear to be in tension with other\nconstraints on the temperature-density relation (TDR). We utilize here an\nultra-high signal-to-noise spectrum of the QSO HE0940-1050 and a novel\ntechnique to study the low opacity part of the PDF. We show that there is\nindeed evidence (at 90% confidence level) that a significant volume fraction of\nthe under-dense regions at $z \\sim 3$ has temperatures as high or higher than\nthose at densities comparable to the mean and above. We further demonstrate\nthat this conclusion is nevertheless consistent with measurements of a slope of\nthe TDR in over-dense regions that imply a decreasing temperature with\ndecreasing density, as expected if photo-heating of ionised hydrogen is the\ndominant heating process. We briefly discuss implications of our findings for\nthe need to invoke either spatial temperature fluctuations, as expected during\nhelium reionization, or additional processes that heat a significant volume\nfraction of the low-density IGM.\n", "  We report on the amplitude of the density turbulence spectrum ($C_{N}^{2}$)\nand the density modulation index ($\\delta N/N$) in the solar wind between $10$\nand $45 R_{\\odot}$. We derive these quantities using a structure function that\nis observationally constrained by occultation observations of the Crab nebula\nmade in 2011 and 2013 and similar observations published earlier. We use the\nmost general form of the structure function, together with currently used\nprescriptions for the inner/dissipation scale of the turbulence spectrum. Our\nwork yields a comprehensive picture of a) the manner in which $C_{N}^{2}$ and\n$\\delta N/N$ vary with heliocentric distance in the solar wind and b) of the\nsolar cycle dependence of these quantities.\n", "  We aim to create a large sample of local post-starburst (PSB) galaxies to\nstudy their characteristic properties, particularly morphological features\nindicative of gravitational distortions and indications for active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs). The selection is based on a huge Kohonen self-organising map\n(SOM) of about one million SDSS spectra. The SOM is made fully available for\nthe astronomical community, in combination with an interactive user interface.\nWe compiled a catalogue of 2665 PSB galaxies with redshifts z < 0.4. In the\ncolour-mass diagram, the PSB sample is found to be clearly concentrated towards\nthe region between the red and the blue cloud, in agreement with the idea that\nPSB galaxies represent the transitioning phase between actively and passively\nevolving galaxies. The relative frequency of morphologically distorted PSB\ngalaxies is at least 57%, significantly higher than in a comparison sample. The\nsearch for AGNs based on conventional selection criteria in the radio and MIR\nresults in a low AGN fraction of 2 - 3%. We confirm an MIR excess in the mean\nSED of the PSB galaxy sample that may indicate hidden AGNs, though other\nsources are also possible. (Abstract modified to match the arXiv format.)\n", "  We compare the methods of amplitude reconstruction, for a complete experiment\nand a truncated partial wave analysis, applied to the photoproduction of\npseudo-scalar mesons. The approach is pedagogical, showing in detail how the\namplitude reconstruction (observables measured at a single energy and angle) is\nrelated to a truncated partial-wave analysis (observables measured at a single\nenergy and a number of angles).\n", "  We present infrared views of the environmental effects on the dust properties\nin star-forming (SF) galaxies at z ~ 0, using the AKARI Far-Infrared Surveyor\n(FIS) all-sky map and the large spectroscopic galaxy sample from Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We restrict the sample to those within\nthe redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.07 and the stellar mass range of 9.2 <\nlog_10 (M_star/M_solar). We select SF galaxies based on their H_alpha\nequivalent width (EW_Ha> 4 A) and emission line flux ratios. We perform\nfar-infrared (FIR) stacking analyses by splitting the SDSS SF galaxy sample\naccording to their stellar mass, specific SFR (SSFR_SDSS), and environment. We\nderive total infrared luminosity (LIR) for each subsample using the average\nflux densities at WIDE-S (90 micron) and WIDE-L (140 micron) bands, and then\ncompute IR-based SFR (SFR_IR) from L_IR. We find a mild decrease of IR- based\nSSFR (SSFR_IR) amongst SF galaxies with increasing local density (~0.1-dex\nlevel at maximum), which suggests that environmental effects do not instantly\nshut down the SF activity in galaxies. We also derive average dust temperature\n(T_dust) using the flux densities at 90 micron and 140 micron bands. We confirm\na strong positive correlation between T_dust and SSFR_IR, consistent with\nrecent studies. The most important finding of this study is that we find a\nmarginal trend that T_dust increases with increasing environmental galaxy\ndensity. Although the environmental trend is much milder than the SSFR-T_dust\ncorrelation, our results suggest that the environmental density may affect the\ndust temperature in SF galaxies, and that the physical mechanism which is\nresponsible for this phenomenon is not necessarily specific to cluster\nenvironments because the environmental dependence of T_dust holds down to\nrelatively low-density environments.\n", "  The Fornax Cluster is the nearest galaxy cluster in the southern sky. NGC\n1404 is a bright elliptical galaxy falling through the intracluster medium of\nthe Fornax Cluster. The sharp leading edge of NGC 1404 forms a classical \"cold\nfront\" that separates 0.6 keV dense interstellar medium and 1.5 keV diffuse\nintracluster medium. We measure the angular pressure variation along the cold\nfront using a very deep (670\\,ksec) {\\sl Chandra} X-ray observation. We are\ntaking the classical approach -- using stagnation pressure to determine a\nsubstructure's speed -- to the next level by not only deriving a general speed\nbut also directionality which yields the complete velocity field as well as the\ndistance of the substructure directly from the pressure distribution. We find a\nhydrodynamic model consistent with the pressure jump along NGC 1404's\natmosphere measured in multiple directions. The best-fit model gives an\ninclination of 33$^{\\circ}$ and a Mach number of 1.3 for the infall of NGC\n1404, in agreement with complementary measurements of the motion of NGC 1404.\nOur study demonstrates the successful treatment of a highly ionized ICM as\nideal fluid flow, in support of the hypothesis that magnetic pressure is not\ndynamically important over most of the virial region of galaxy clusters.\n", "  We turn our attention to Haffner 9, a Milky Way open cluster whose previous\nfundamental parameter estimates are far from being in agreement. In order to\nprovide with accurate estimates we present high-quality Washington CT1 and\nJohnson BVI photometry of the cluster field. We put particular care in\nstatistically clean the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from field star\ncontamination, which was found a common source in previous works for the\ndiscordant fundamental parameter estimates. The resulting cluster CMD fiducial\nfeatures were confirmed from a proper motion membership analysis. Haffner 9 is\na moderately young object (age ~ 350 Myr), placed in the Perseus arm -at a\nheliocentric distance of ~ 3.2 kpc-, with a lower limit for its present mass of\n~ 160 Mo and of nearly metal solar content. The combination of the cluster\nstructural and fundamental parameters suggest that it is in an advanced stage\nof internal dynamical evolution, possibly in the phase typical of those with\nmass segregation in their core regions. However, the cluster still keeps its\nmass function close to that of the Salpeter's law.\n", "  The upcoming TESS mission is expected to find thousands of transiting planets\naround bright stars, yet for three-quarters of the fields observed the temporal\ncoverage will limit discoveries to planets with orbital periods below 13.7\ndays. From the Kepler catalog, the mean probability of these short-period\ntransiting planets having additional longer period transiters (which would be\nmissed by TESS) is 18%, a value ten times higher than the average star. In this\nwork, we show how this probability is not uniform but functionally dependent\nupon the properties of the observed short-period transiters, ranging from less\nthan 1% up to over 50%. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on the\nKepler catalog and making careful feature selection to account for the\ndiffering sensitivity of TESS, we are able to predict the most likely\nshort-period transiters to be accompanied by additional transiters. Through\ncross-validation, we predict that a targeted, optimized TESS transit and/or\nradial velocity follow-up program using our trained ANN would have a discovery\nyield improved by a factor of two. Our work enables a near-optimal follow-up\nstrategy for surveys following TESS targets for additional planets, improving\nthe science yield derived from TESS and particularly beneficial in the search\nfor habitable-zone transiting worlds.\n", "  In this work we present a systematic theoretical analysis regarding\ndark-bright solitons and their interactions, motivated by recent advances in\natomic two-component repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensates. In\nparticular, we study analytically via a two-soliton ansatz adopted within a\nvariational formulation the interaction between two dark-bright solitons in a\nhomogeneous environment beyond the integrable regime, by considering general\ninter/intra-atomic interaction coefficients. We retrieve the possibility of a\nfixed point in the case where the bright solitons are out of phase. As the\ninter-component interaction is increased, we also identify an exponential\ninstability of the two-soliton state, associated with a subcritical pitchfork\nbifurcation. The latter gives rise to an asymmetric partition of the bright\nsoliton mass and dynamically leads to spontaneous splitting of the bound pair.\nIn the case of the in-phase bright solitons, we explain via parsing the\nanalytical approximations and monitoring the direct dynamics why no such pair\nis identified, despite its prediction by the variational analysis.\n", "  The NA62 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of charged kaon decays\nwith a highly efficient trigger for decays into electrons in 2007. The kaon\nbeam represents a source of tagged neutral pion decays in vacuum. A measurement\nof the electromagnetic transition form factor slope of the neutral pion in the\ntime-like region from $1.05\\times10^6$ fully reconstructed $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decay\nis presented. The limits on dark photon production in $\\pi^0$ decays from the\nearlier kaon experiment at CERN, NA48/2, are also reported.\n", "  We present new results on the evolution of rest-frame blue/UV sizes and\nSersic indices of H$\\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies over the last 11\nGyrs. We investigate how the perceived evolution can be affected by a range of\nbiases and systematics such as cosmological dimming and resolution effects. We\nuse GALFIT and an artificial redshifting technique, which includes the\nluminosity evolution of H$\\alpha$-selected galaxies, to quantify the change on\nthe measured structural parameters with redshift. We find typical sizes of 2 to\n3 kpc and Sersic indices of n~1.2, close to pure exponential disks all the way\nfrom z=2.23 to z=0.4. At z=0 we find typical sizes of 4-5 kpc. Our results show\nthat, when using GALFIT, cosmological dimming has a negligible impact on the\nderived effective radius for galaxies with <10 kpc, but we find a ~20% bias on\nthe estimate of the median Sersic indices, rendering galaxies more disk-like.\nStar-forming galaxies have grown on average by a factor of 2-3 in the last 11\nGyrs with $r_e\\propto(1+z)^{-0.75}$. By exploring the evolution of the stellar\nmass-size relation we find evidence for a stronger size evolution of the most\nmassive star-forming galaxies since z~2, as they grow faster towards z~0 when\ncompared to the lower stellar mass counterparts. As we are tracing the\nrest-frame blue/UV, we are likely witnessing the growth of disks where star\nformation is ongoing in galaxies while their profiles remain close to\nexponential disks, n<1.5, across the same period.\n", "  We present a revised TRGB calibration, accurate to 2.7% of distance. A\nmodified TRGB magnitude corrected for the color dependence of the TRGB, the QT\nmagnitude, is introduced for better measurement of the TRGB. We determine the\ncolor-magnitude relation of the TRGB from photometry of deep images of HST/ACS\nfields around eight nearby galaxies. The zero-point of the TRGB at the fiducial\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]=-1.6 ((V-I)_{0,TRGB}=1.5)) is obtained from photometry of\ntwo distance anchors, NGC 4258 (M106) and the LMC, to which precise geometric\ndistances are known: M_{QT,TRGB}=-4.023+-0.073 mag from NGC 4258 and\nM_{QT,TRGB}=-4.004+-0.096 mag from the LMC. A weighted mean of the two\nzero-points is M_{QT,TRGB}=-4.016+-0.058 mag. Quoted uncertainty is ~2 times\nsmaller than those of the previous calibrations. We compare the empirical TRGB\ncalibration derived in this study with theoretical stellar models, finding that\nthere are significant discrepancies, especially for red color ((F606W-F814W)_0\n> 2.5). We provide the revised TRGB calibration in several magnitude systems\nfor future studies.\n", "  We report the discovery of the first 'ghostly' damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorption\nsystem (DLA), which is identified by the presence of absorption from strong\nlow-ion species at $z_{\\rm abs}=1.70465$ along the line of sight to the quasar\nSDSSJ113341.29$-$005740.0 with $z_{\\rm em}=1.70441$. No Ly$\\alpha$ absorption\ntrough is seen associated with these absorptions because the DLA trough is\nfilled with the leaked emission from the broad emission line region of the\nquasar. By modeling the quasar spectrum and analyzing the metal lines, we\nderive log$N$(HI)(cm$^{-2}$)$\\sim$21.0 $\\pm$ 0.3. The DLA cloud is small ($\\le$\n0.32 pc) thus not covering entirely the broad line region and is located at\n$\\ge$ 39 pc from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). Although the DLA is\nslightly redshifted relative to the quasar, its metallicity\n([S/H]=$-$0.41$\\pm$0.30) is intermediate between what is expected from\ninfalling and outflowing gas. It could be possible that the DLA is part of some\ninfalling material accreting onto the quasar host galaxy through filaments, and\nthat its metallicity is raised by mixing with the enriched outflowing gas\nemanating from the central AGN. Current DLA surveys miss these 'ghostly' DLAs,\nand it would be important to quantify the statistics of this population by\nsearching the SDSS database using metal absorption templates.\n", "  We study quantum disordered ground states of the two dimensional\nHeisenberg-Kitaev model on the triangular lattice using a Schwinger boson\napproach. Our aim is to identify and characterize potential gapped quantum spin\nliquid phases that are stabilized by anisotropic Kitaev interactions. For\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg- and Kitaev couplings and sufficiently small spin\n$S$ we find three different symmetric $Z_2$ spin liquid phases, separated by\ntwo continuous quantum phase transitions. Interestingly, the gap of elementary\nexcitations remains finite throughout the transitions. The first spin liquid\nphase corresponds to the well known zero-flux state in the Heisenberg limit,\nwhich is stable with respect to small Kitaev couplings and develops $120^\\circ$\norder in the semi-classical limit at large $S$. In the opposite Kitaev limit we\nfind a different spin liquid ground-state, which is a quantum disordered\nversion of a magnetically ordered state with antiferromagnetic chains, in\naccordance with results in the classical limit. Finally, at intermediate\ncouplings we find a spin liquid state with unconventional spin correlations.\nUpon spinon condensation this state develops Bragg peaks at incommensurate\nmomenta in close analogy to the magnetically ordered Z2 vortex crystal phase,\nwhich has been analyzed in recent theoretical works.\n", "  Two galaxies that lie deep within the Local Void provide a test of the\nexpectation that voids expand. The modest (M_B~-14) HI bearing dwarf galaxies\nALFAZOAJ1952+1428 and KK246 have been imaged with Hubble Space Telescope in\norder to study the stellar populations and determine distances from the\nluminosities of stars at the tip of the red giant branch. The mixed age systems\nhave respective distances of 8.39 Mpc and 6.95 Mpc and inferred line-of-sight\npeculiar velocities of -114 km/s and -66 km/s toward us and away from the void\ncenter. These motions compound on the Milky Way motion of ~230 km/s away from\nthe void. The orbits of the two galaxies are reasonably constrained by a\nnumerical action model encompassing an extensive region that embraces the Local\nVoid. It is unambiguously confirmed that these two void galaxies are moving\naway from the void center at several hundred km/s.\n", "  We report the detection of two new gamma-ray sources in the Fermi-LAT sky\n(Pass 8) at energies higher than 20 GeV, and confirmed at lower energies, using\na source detection tool based on the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. One of\nthese sources, at a Galactic latitude of about -4{\\deg}, is a new discovery,\nwhile the other was previously reported above 50 GeV in the 2FHL catalogue. We\nsearched for archival multi-wavelength data of possible counterparts and found\ninteresting candidates. Both objects are radio sources and their WISE infrared\ncolours are typical of blazars. While for the former source no optical spectra\nare available, for the latter a puzzling optical spectrum corresponding to a\nwhite dwarf star is found in the 6dF database. We discuss the spectral energy\ndistributions of both sources and possible interpretations.\n", "  Completely open systems can exchange heat, work, and matter with the\nenvironment. While energy, volume, and number of particles fluctuate under\ncompletely open conditions, the equilibrium states of the system, if they\nexist, can be specified using the temperature, pressure, and chemical potential\nas control parameters. The unconstrained ensemble is the statistical ensemble\ndescribing completely open systems and the replica energy is the appropriate\nfree energy for these control parameters from which the thermodynamics must be\nderived. It turns out that macroscopic systems with short-range interactions\ncannot attain equilibrium configurations in the unconstrained ensemble, since\ntemperature, pressure, and chemical potential cannot be taken as a set of\nindependent variables in this case. In contrast, we show that systems with\nlong-range interactions can reach states of thermodynamic equilibrium in the\nunconstrained ensemble. To illustrate this fact, we consider a modification of\nthe Thirring model and compare the unconstrained ensemble with the canonical\nand grand canonical ones: the more the ensemble is constrained by fixing the\nvolume or number of particles, the larger the space of parameters defining the\nequilibrium configurations.\n", "  The heaviest metals found in stars in most ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies\nin the Milky Way halo are generally underabundant by an order of magnitude or\nmore when compared with stars in the halo field. Among the heavy elements\nproduced by n-capture reactions, only Sr and Ba can be detected in red giant\nstars in most UFD galaxies. This limited chemical information is unable to\nidentify the nucleosynthesis process(es) responsible for producing the heavy\nelements in UFD galaxies. Similar [Sr/Ba] and [Ba/Fe] ratios are found in three\nbright halo field stars, BD-18 5550, CS 22185-007, and CS 22891-200. Previous\nstudies of high-quality spectra of these stars report detections of additional\nn-capture elements, including Eu. The [Eu/Ba] ratios in these stars span +0.41\nto +0.86. These ratios and others among elements in the rare earth domain\nindicate an r-process origin. These stars have some of the lowest levels of\nr-process enhancement known, with [Eu/H] spanning -3.95 to -3.32, and they may\nbe considered nearby proxies for faint stars in UFD galaxies. Direct\nconfirmation, however, must await future observations of additional heavy\nelements in stars in the UFD galaxies themselves.\n", "  Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge\ntheorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as\nthis remains the only plausible hypothesis.\n", "  We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1\ngalaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk.\nThe 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 to 9157 angstroms) combine\nsimultaneous HST , Swift , and ground-based observations over a 180 day period\nfrom 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the\nreverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central\ntime-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination, i,\ntemperature T1 at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius\nslope, alpha. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates\npoorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the\nX-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the\nobserving period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and\nmean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a\nstandard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/LEdd = 0.1\n", "  We introduce the concept of \"absolutely classical\" spin states, in analogy to\nabsolutely separable states of bi-partite quantum systems. Absolutely classical\nstates are states that remain classical under any unitary transformation\napplied to them. We investigate the maximum ball of absolutely classical states\ncentered on the fully mixed state that can be inscribed into the set of\nclassical states, and derive a lower bound for its radius as function of the\ntotal spin quantum number. The result is compared to the case of absolutely\nseparable states.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the GQ Lup system, a young Sun-like star with\na substellar mass companion in a wide-separation orbit. These observations of\n870 $\\mu$m continuum and CO J=3-2 line emission with beam size $\\sim0.3''$\n($\\sim45$ AU) resolve the disk of dust and gas surrounding the primary star, GQ\nLup A, and provide deep limits on any circumplanetary disk surrounding the\ncompanion, GQ Lup b. The circumprimary dust disk is compact with a FWHM of\n$59\\pm12$ AU, while the gas has a larger extent with a characteristic radius of\n$46.5\\pm1.8$ AU. By forward-modeling the velocity field of the circumprimary\ndisk based on the CO emission, we constrain the mass of GQ Lup A to be $M_* =\n(1.03\\pm0.05)*(d/156\\text{ pc})$ $M_\\odot$, where $d$ is a known distance, and\ndetermine that we view the disk at an inclination angle of\n$60.5^\\circ\\pm0.5^\\circ$ and a position angle of $346^\\circ \\pm1^\\circ$. The\n$3\\sigma$ upper limit on the 870 $\\mu$m flux density of any circumplanetary\ndisk associated with GQ Lup b of $<0.15$ mJy implies an upper limit on the dust\ndisk mass of $<0.04$ $M_\\oplus$ for standard assumptions about optically thin\nemission. We discuss proposed mechanisms for the formation of wide-separation\nsubstellar companions given the non-detection of circumplanetary disks around\nGQ Lup b and other similar systems.\n", "  We consider the ionization of neon induced by a femtosecond laser pulse\ncomposed of overlapping, linearly polarized bichromatic extreme ultraviolet and\ninfrared fields. In particular, we study the effects of the infrared light on a\ntwo-pathway ionization scheme for which Ne 2s22p53s1P is used as intermediate\nstate. Using time-dependent calculations, supported by a theoretical approach\nbased on the strong-field approximation, we analyze the ionization probability\nand the photoelectron angular distributions associated with the different\nsidebands of the ionization spectrum. Complex oscillations of the angular\ndistribution anisotropy parameters as a function of the infrared light\nintensity are revealed. Finally, we demonstrate that coherent control of the\nasymmetry is achievable by tuning the infrared frequency to a nearby electronic\ntransition.\n", "  We present a theory of spatially indirect exciton condensate states in\nsystems composed of a pair of electrically isolated Bernal graphene bilayers.\nThe ground state phase diagram in a two-dimensional\ndisplacement-field/inter-bilayer-bias space includes layer-polarized\nsemiconductors, spin-density-wave states, exciton condensates, and states with\nmixed excitonic and spin order. We find that two different condensate states,\ndistinguished by a chirality index, are stable under different electrical\ncontrol conditions.\n", "  We present APEX 218 GHz observations of molecular emission in a complete\nsample of embedded protostars in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. To study\nthe physical properties of the cores, we calculate H$_2$CO and c-C$_3$H$_2$\nrotational temperatures, both of which are good tracers of the kinetic\ntemperature of the molecular gas. We find that the H$_2$CO temperatures range\nbetween 16 K and 124 K, with the highest H$_2$CO temperatures toward the hot\ncorino source IRAS 16293-2422 (69-124 K) and the sources in the $\\rho$ Oph A\ncloud (23-49 K) located close to the luminous Herbig Be star S 1, which\nexternally irradiates the $\\rho$ Oph A cores. On the other hand, the\nc-C$_3$H$_2$ rotational temperature is consistently low (7-17 K) in all\nsources. Our results indicate that the c-C$_3$H$_2$ emission is primarily\ntracing more shielded parts of the envelope whereas the H$_2$CO emission (at\nthe angular scale of the APEX beam; 3600 au in Ophiuchus) mainly traces the\nouter irradiated envelopes, apart from in IRAS 16293-2422, where the hot corino\nemission dominates. In some sources, a secondary velocity component is also\nseen, possibly tracing the molecular outflow.\n", "  Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that integral field\nspectroscopy can connect the high-order stellar kinematic moments h3\n(~skewness) and h4 (~kurtosis) in galaxies to their cosmological assembly\nhistory. Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a\nsample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral\nfield data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter\n($\\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and\nslow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular\nrotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that\nregular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereas\nquasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and\n$V/\\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an\nalternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual\nh3 versus $V/\\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar\nkinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow\nrotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that\ngalaxies with similar $\\lambda_{R_e}-\\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctly\ndifferent h3-$V/\\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified\nfast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\\sigma$ anti-correlation. These\nobjects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From\nmorphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks.\nInstead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have\ncounter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the\nstrong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\\sigma$ as evidence for disks in most\nfast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.\n", "  We present multiple spectropolarimetric observations of the nearby Type Ia\nsupernova (SN) 2011fe in M101, obtained before, during, and after the time of\nmaximum apparent visual brightness. The excellent time coverage of our\nspectropolarimetry has allowed better monitoring of the evolution of\npolarization features than is typical, which has allowed us new insight into\nthe nature of normal SNe Ia. SN 2011fe exhibits time-dependent polarization in\nboth the continuum and strong absorption lines. At early epochs, red\nwavelengths exhibit a degree of continuum polarization of up to 0.4\\%, likely\nindicative of a mild asymmetry in the electron-scattering photosphere. This\nbehavior is more common in sub-luminous SNe Ia than in normal events, such as\nSN2011fe. The degree of polarization across a collection of absorption lines\nvaries dramatically from epoch to epoch. During the earliest epoch a\n$\\lambda$4600-5000 \\AA\\ complex of absorption lines shows enhanced polarization\nat a different position angle than the continuum. We explore the origin of\nthese features, presenting a few possible interpretations, without arriving at\na single favored ion. During two epochs near maximum, the dominant polarization\nfeature is associated with the Si{\\sc ii} $\\lambda$6355 \\AA\\ absorption line.\nThis is common for SNeIa, but for SN2011fe the polarization of this feature\nincreases after maximum light, whereas for other SNeIa, that polarization\nfeature was strongest before maximum light.\n", "  We evaluate the partial decay widths for the semileptonic $\\Lambda_b \\to \\bar\n\\nu_l l \\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\\Lambda_b \\to \\bar \\nu_l l \\Lambda_c(2625)$\ndecays from the perspective that these two $\\Lambda^*_c$ resonances are\ndynamically generated from the $DN$ and $D^*N$ interaction with coupled\nchannels. We find that the ratio of the rates obtained for these two reactions\nis compatible with present experimental data and is very sensitive to the $D^*\nN$ coupling, which becomes essential to obtain agreement with experiment.\nTogether with the results obtained for the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\pi^- \\Lambda^*_c$\nreactions, it gives strong support to the molecular picture of the two\n$\\Lambda^*_c$ resonances and the important role of the $D^*N$ component\nneglected in prior studies of the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$ from the molecular\nperspective.\n", "  The aim of this work is to characterize physical properties of Ultra Luminous\nInfrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) detected in\nthe far-infrared (FIR) 90um band in the AKARI Deep Field-South (ADF-S) survey.\nIn particular, we want to estimate the AGN contribution to the [U]LIRGs'\ninfrared emission and which types of AGNs are related to their activity. We\nexamined 69 galaxies at z>0.05 detected at 90um by the AKARI satellite in the\nADF-S, with optical counterparts and spectral coverage from the ultraviolet to\nthe FIR. We used two independent spectral energy distribution fitting codes:\none fitting the SED from FIR to FUV (CIGALE) and gray-body + power spectrum fit\nfor the infrared part of the spectra (CMCIRSED) in order to identify a\nsubsample of [U]LIRGs, and to estimate their properties. Based on the CIGALE\nSED fitting, we have found that [U]LIRGs selected at the 90um AKARI band\ncompose ~56% of our sample (we found 17 ULIRGs and 22 LIRGs, spanning over the\nredshift range 0.06<z<1.23). Their physical parameters, such as stellar mass,\nstar formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR are consistent with the ones found\nfor other samples selected at IR wavelengths. We have detected a significant\nAGN contribution to the MIR luminosity for 63% of LIRGs and ULIRGs. Our LIRGs\ncontain Type 1, Type 2, and intermediate types of AGN, whereas for ULIRGs, a\nmajority (more than 50%) of AGN emission originates from Type 2 AGNs. The\ntemperature--luminosity and temperature--mass relations for the dust component\nof ADF--S LIRGs and ULIRGs indicate that these relations are shaped by the dust\nmass and not by the increased dust heating. We conclude that LIRGs contain Type\n1, Type 2, and intermediate types of AGNs, with an AGN contribution to the MIR\nemission at the median level of 13+/-3%, whereas the majority of ULIRGs contain\nType 2 AGNs, with a median AGN fraction equal to 19+/-8%.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a three\ndimensional metamaterial that can motivate electromagnetic induced transparency\n(EIT) by using circular polarized wave as stimulations. The unit cell consists\nof a pair of metallic strips printed on both sides of the printed circuit board\n(PCB), where a conductive cylinder junction is used to connect the metal strips\nby drilling a hole inside the substrate. When a right circularly polarized wave\nis incident, destructive interference is excited between meta-atoms of the 3D\nstructure, the transmission spectrum demonstrates a sharp transparency window.\nA coupled oscillator model and an electrical equivalent circuit model are\napplied to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the coupling mechanism in\nthe EIT-like metamaterial. Analysis in detail shows the EIT window's amplitude\nand frequency are modulated by changing the degree of symmetry breaking. The\nproposed metamaterial may achieve potential applications in developing chiral\nslow light devices.\n", "  Filaments in Herschel molecular cloud images are found to exhibit a\n\"characteristic width\". This finding is in tension with spatial power spectra\nof the data, which show no indication of this characteristic scale. We\ndemonstrate that this discrepancy is a result of the methodology adopted for\nmeasuring filament widths. First, we perform the previously used analysis\ntechnique on artificial scale-free data, and obtain a peaked width distribution\nof filament-like structures. Next, we repeat the analysis on three Herschel\nmaps and reproduce the narrow distribution of widths found in previous studies\n$-$ when considering the average width of each filament. However, the\ndistribution of widths measured at all points along a filament spine is broader\nthan the distribution of mean filament widths, indicating that the narrow\nspread (interpreted as a \"characteristic\" width) results from averaging.\nFurthermore, the width is found to vary significantly from one end of a\nfilament to the other. Therefore, the previously identified peak at 0.1 pc\ncannot be understood as representing the typical width of filaments. We find an\nalternative explanation by modelling the observed width distribution as a\ntruncated power-law distribution, sampled with uncertainties. The position of\nthe peak is connected to the lower truncation scale and is likely set by the\nchoice of parameters used in measuring filament widths. We conclude that a\n\"characteristic\" width of filaments is not supported by the available data.\n", "  The study of solar active longitudes has generated a great interest in the\nrecent years. In this work we have used an unique continuous sunspot data\nseries obtained from Kodaikanal observatory and revisited the problem. Analysis\nof the data shows a persistent presence of the active longitude during the\nwhole 90 years of data duration. We compare two well studied analysis methods\nand presented their respective results. The separation between the two most\nactive longitudes is found be roughly 180{\\deg} for majority of time.\nAdditionally, we also find a comparatively weaker presence of separations at\n90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Migration pattern of these active longitudes as\nrevealed from our data is found to be consistent with the solar differential\nrotation curve. We also study the periodicities in the active longitudes and\nfound two dominant periods of $\\approx$1.3 years and $\\approx$2.2 years. These\nperiods, also found in other solar proxies, indicate their relation with the\nglobal solar dynamo mechanism.\n", "  In order to constrain the evolutionary state of the red supergiant\nBetelgeuse, we have produced a suite of models with ZAMS masses from 15 to 25\nMsun in intervals of 1 Msun including the effects of rotation. The models were\ncomputed with the stellar evolutionary code MESA. For non-rotating models we\nfind results that are similar to other work. It is somewhat difficult to find\nmodels that agree within 1 sigma of the observed values of R, Teff and L, but\nmodestly easy within 3 sigma uncertainty. Incorporating the nominal observed\nrotational velocity, ~15 km/s, yields significantly different, and challenging,\nconstraints. This velocity constraint is only matched when the models first\napproach the base of the red supergiant branch (RSB), having crossed the\nHertzsprung gap, but not yet having ascended the RSB and most violate even\ngenerous error bars on R, Teff and L. Models at the tip of the RSB typically\nrotate at only ~0.1 km/s, independent of any reasonable choice of initial\nrotation. We discuss the possible uncertainties in our modeling and the\nobservations, including the distance to Betelgeuse, the rotation velocity, and\nmodel parameters. We summarize various options to account for the rotational\nvelocity and suggest that one possibility is that Betelgeuse merged with a\ncompanion star of about 1 Msun as it ascended the RSB, in the process producing\nthe ring structure observed at about 7' away. A past coalescence would\ncomplicate attempts to understand the evolutionary history and future of\nBetelgeuse.\n", "  Strong X-ray emission from large scale jets of radio loud quasars still\nremains an open problem. Models based on inverse Compton scattering off CMB\nphotons by relativistically beamed jets have recently been ruled out, since\nFermi LAT observations for 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752 give the upper limit far\nbelow the model prediction. Synchrotron emission from a separate electron\npopulation with multi-hundred TeV energies remains a possibility although its\norigin is not well known. We examine a photo-hadronic origin of such high\nenergy electrons/positrons, assuming that protons are accelerated up to\n$10^{19}$ eV and produce electrons/positrons through Bethe-Heitler process and\nphoto-pion production. These secondary electrons/positrons are injected at\nsufficiently high energies and produce X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays by synchrotron\nradiation without conflicting with the Fermi LAT upper limits. We find that the\nresultant spectrum well reproduces the X-ray observations from PKS 0637-752, if\nthe proton power is at least $10^{49} \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$, which is\nhighly super-Eddington. It is noted that the X-ray emission originates\nprimarily from leptons through Bethe-Heitler process, while leptons from\nphoto-pion origin lose energy directly through synchrotron emission of\nmulti-TeV photons rather than cascading. To avoid the overproduction of the\noptical flux, optical emission is primarily due to synchrotron emission of\nsecondary leptons rather than primary electrons, or a mild degree of beaming of\nthe jet is needed, if it is owing to the primary electrons. Proton synchrotron\nluminosity is a few orders of magnitude smaller.\n", "  Aims. A recent debate on the decade-long stability of the interstellar He\nflow vector, and in particular the flow longitude, has prompted us to check for\nany variability in the interstellar H flow vector as observed by the SWAN\ninstrument on board SOHO. Methods. We used a simple model-independent method to\ndetermine the interstellar H flow longitude, based on the parallax effects\ninduced on the Lyman-{\\alpha} intensity measured by SWAN following the\nsatellite motion around the Sun. Results. Our results show that the\ninterstellar H flow vector longitude does not vary significantly from an\naverage value of 252.9$^{\\circ}$ $\\pm$ 1.4$^{\\circ}$ throughout the 20-year\nspan of the SWAN dataset, further strengthening the arguments for the stability\nof the interstellar gas flow.\n", "  We present a search for transient and highly variable sources at low radio\nfrequencies (150-200 MHz) that explores long timescales of 1-3 years. We\nconducted this search by comparing the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey Alternative Data\nRelease 1 (TGSS ADR1) and the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison\nWidefield Array (GLEAM) survey catalogues. To account for the different\ncompleteness thresholds in the individual surveys, we searched for compact\nGLEAM sources above a flux density limit of 100 mJy that were not present in\nthe TGSS ADR1; and also for compact TGSS ADR1 sources above a flux density\nlimit of 200 mJy that had no counterpart in GLEAM. From a total sample of 234\n333 GLEAM sources and 275 612 TGSS ADR1 sources in the overlap region between\nthe two surveys, there were 99658 GLEAM sources and 38 978 TGSS ADR sources\nthat passed our flux density cutoff and compactness criteria. Analysis of these\nsources resulted in three candidate transient sources. Further analysis ruled\nout two candidates as imaging artefacts. We analyse the third candidate and\nshow it is likely to be real, with a flux density of 182 +/- 26 mJy at 147.5\nMHz. This gives a transient surface density of rho = (6.2 +/- 6) x 10-5 deg-2 .\nWe present initial follow-up observations and discuss possible causes for this\ncandidate. The small number of spurious sources from this search demonstrates\nthe high reliability of these two new low-frequency radio catalogues.\n", "  In this paper, we focus on the pre-flare coronal dimmings. We report our\nmultiwavelength observations of the GOES X1.6 solar flare and the accompanying\nhalo CME produced by the eruption of a sigmoidal magnetic flux rope (MFR) in\nNOAA active region (AR) 12158 on 2014 September 10. The eruption was observed\nby the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory\n(SDO). The photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms were observed by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO. The soft X-ray (SXR) fluxes\nwere recorded by the GOES spacecraft. The halo CME was observed by the white\nlight coronagraphs of the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) aboard\nSOHO.} {About 96 minutes before the onset of flare/CME, narrow pre-flare\ncoronal dimmings appeared at the two ends of the twisted MFR. They extended\nvery slowly with their intensities decreasing with time, while their apparent\nwidths (8$-$9 Mm) nearly kept constant. During the impulsive and decay phases\nof flare, typical fanlike twin dimmings appeared and expanded with much larger\nextent and lower intensities than the pre-flare dimmings. The percentage of 171\n{\\AA} intensity decrease reaches 40\\%. The pre-flare dimmings are most striking\nin 171, 193, and 211 {\\AA} with formation temperatures of 0.6$-$2.5 MK. The\nnorthern part of the pre-flare dimmings could also be recognized in 131 and 335\n{\\AA}.} To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of pre-flare coronal\ndimmings, which can be explained by the density depletion as a result of the\ngradual expansion of the coronal loop system surrounding the MFR during the\nslow rise of the MFR.\n", "  Two observables are called complementary if preparing a physical object in an\neigenstate of one of them yields a completely random result in a measurement of\nthe other. We investigate small sets of complementary observables that cannot\nbe extended by yet another complementary observable. We construct explicit\nexamples of the unextendible sets up to dimension $16$ and conjecture certain\nsmall sets to be unextendible in higher dimensions. Our constructions provide\nthree complementary measurements, only one observable away from the ultimate\nminimum of two observables in the set. Almost all of our examples in finite\ndimension allow to discriminate pure states from some mixed states, and shed\nlight on the complex topology of the Bloch space of higher-dimensional quantum\nsystems.\n", "  Aims: Following the detection of the fast radio burst FRB150418 by the SUPERB\nproject at the Parkes radio telescope, we aim to search for very-high energy\ngamma-ray afterglow emission. Methods: Follow-up observations in the very-high\nenergy gamma-ray domain were obtained with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescope system within 14.5 hours of the radio burst. Results: The\nobtained 1.4 hours of gamma-ray observations are presented and discussed. At\nthe 99 % C.L. we obtained an integral upper limit on the gamma-ray flux of\n(E>350 GeV) < 1.33 x 10^-8 m^-2s^-1. Differential flux upper limits as function\nof the photon energy were derived and used to constrain the intrinsic\nhigh-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418. Conclusions: No hints for\nhigh-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418 were found. Taking absorption on\nthe extragalactic background light into account and assuming a distance of z =\n0.492 based on radio and optical counterpart studies and consistent with the\nFRB dispersion, we constrain the gamma-ray luminosity at 1 TeV to L < 5.1 x\n10^47 erg/s at 99% C.L.\n", "  The ATLAS collaboration recently reported on the first observation of\nassociated-production of a $Z^0$ boson with a $J/\\psi$. We recently claimed\nthat the corresponding yield of the {\\it prompt} $J/\\psi$ was dominated by\ndouble parton scatterings in the ATLAS acceptance with a somewhat small value\nof $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$. We also found out that single parton scatterings were\nonly dominant at large transverse momenta. We present here the first\nphenomenological analysis of another part of the ATLAS data sample, namely of a\n$Z^0$ boson plus a {\\it non-prompt} $J/\\psi$. Our study is performed at\nnext-to-leading order in $\\alpha_s$ and includes parton-shower effects via the\n{\\sc\\small MadGraph5_aMC@NLO} framework. We find out that the data, unlike the\ncase of prompt $J/\\psi+Z^0$, do not hint at significant DPS contributions.\nOwing to the current experimental and theoretical uncertainties, there is still\na room for these but with a lower limit of $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$ close to 5 mb. We\nstress the importance of QCD corrections to account for the ATLAS data.\n", "  We study formation and long-term evolution of a circumstellar disk in a\ncollapsing molecular cloud core using a resistive magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulation. While the formed circumstellar disk is initially small, it grows as\naccretion continues and its radius becomes as large as 200 AUs toward the end\nof the Class-I phase. A pair of grand-design spiral arms form due to\ngravitational instability in the disk, and they transfer angular momentum in\nthe highly resistive disk. Although the spiral arms disappear in a few\nrotations as expected in a classical theory, new spiral arms form recurrently\nas the disk soon becomes unstable again by gas accretion. Such recurrent spiral\narms persist throughout the Class-0 and I phase. We then perform synthetic\nobservations and compare our model with a recent high-resolution observation of\na young stellar object Elias 2-27, whose circumstellar disk has grand design\nspiral arms. We find good agreement between our theoretical model and the\nobservation. Our model suggests that the grand design spiral arms around Elias\n2-27 are consistent with material arms formed by gravitational instability. If\nsuch spiral arms commonly exist in young circumstellar disks, it implies that\nyoung circumstellar disks are considerably massive and gravitational\ninstability is the key process of angular momentum transport.\n", "  We analyse the structure and kinematics of ionized gas in the vicinity of the\nultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) HoII X-1 in the Holmberg II galaxy using\nobservational data obtained with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer in the\nH$\\alpha$, [SII] and [OIII] emission lines at the Russian 6-m telescope.\nDecomposition of the line profiles allows us to identify the broad component of\nemission lines caused by the ULX action. We found evidence of an expanding\nsuperbubble around the young star cluster located in the studied region. We\nconclude that the blue-shifted 'arc' around the ULX observed in the\nline-of-sight velocity field may correspond to a bow shock caused by the ULX\nmovement from that nearby young star cluster. If this interpretation is\ncorrect, it will be the first kinematic evidence of ULX's escape from their\nparent star clusters.\n", "  NASA's K2 mission is observing tens of thousands of stars along the ecliptic,\nproviding data suitable for large scale asteroseismic analyses to inform\ngalactic archaeology studies. Its first campaign covered a field near the north\ngalactic cap, a region never covered before by large asteroseismic-ensemble\ninvestigations, and was therefore of particular interest for exploring this\npart of our Galaxy. Here we report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars\nselected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission's \"North\nGalactic Cap\" campaign 1. Our consolidated analysis uses six independent\nmethods to measure the global seismic properties, in particular the large\nfrequency separation, and the frequency of maximum power. From the full target\nsample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red giants, a number\ncomparable with estimates from galactic synthesis modeling. Thus, as a valuable\nby-product we find roughly 7500 stars to be dwarfs, which provide a sample well\nsuited for galactic exoplanet occurrence studies because they originate from\nour simple and easily reproducible selection function. In addition, to\nfacilitate the full potential of the data set for galactic archaeology we\nassess the detection completeness of our sample of oscillating red giants. We\nfind the sample is at least near complete for stars with 40 < numax/microHz <\n270, and numax_detec < 2.6*1e6 * 2e-Kp microHz. There is a detection bias\nagainst helium core burning stars with numax ~ 30 microHz, affecting the number\nof measurements of DeltaNu and possibly also numax. Although we can detect\noscillations down to Kp = 15, our campaign 1 sample lacks enough faint giants\nto assess the detection completeness for stars fainter than Kp ~ 14.5.\n", "  We present results from a deep 2'x3' (comoving scale of 3.7 Mpc x 5.5 Mpc at\nz=3) survey at 1.1 mm taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) in the SSA22 field. We observe the core region of a z = 3.09\nprotocluster, achieving a typical rms sensitivity of 60 micro-Jy/beam at a\nspatial resolution of 0\".7. We detect 18 robust ALMA sources at a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) > 5. Comparison between the ALMA map and a 1.1 mm\nmap taken with the AzTEC camera on the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope\nExperiment (ASTE) indicates that three submillimeter sources discovered by the\nAzTEC/ASTE survey are resolved into eight individual submillimeter galaxies\n(SMGs) by ALMA. At least ten of our 18 ALMA SMGs have spectroscopic redshifts\nof z = 3.09, placing them in the protocluster. This shows that a number of\ndusty starburst galaxies are forming simultaneously in the core of the\nprotocluster. The nine brightest ALMA SMGs with SNR > 10 have a median\nintrinsic angular size of 0\".32+0\".13-0\".06 (2.4+1.0-0.4 physical kpc at z =\n3.09), which is consistent with previous size measurements of SMGs in other\nfields. As expected the source counts show a possible excess compared to the\ncounts in the general fields at S_1.1mm >= 1.0 mJy due to the protocluster. Our\ncontiguous mm mapping highlights the importance of large-scale structures on\nthe formation of dusty starburst galaxies.\n", "  We systematically investigate the near- (NIR) to far-infrared (FIR)\nphotometric properties of a nearly complete sample of local active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) detected in the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) all-sky ultra\nhard X-ray (14-195 keV) survey. Out of 606 non-blazar AGN in the Swift/BAT\n70-month catalog at high galactic latitude of $|b|>10^{\\circ}$, we obtain IR\nphotometric data of 604 objects by cross-matching the AGN positions with\ncatalogs from the WISE, AKARI, IRAS, and Herschel infrared observatories. We\nfind a good correlation between the ultra-hard X-ray and mid-IR (MIR)\nluminosities over five orders of magnitude ($41 < \\log (L_{14-195}/{\\rm\nerg}~{\\rm s}^{-1})< 46$). Informed by previous measures of the intrinsic\nspectral energy distribution of AGN, we find FIR pure-AGN candidates whose FIR\nemission is thought to be AGN-dominated with low starformation activity. We\ndemonstrate that the dust covering factor decreases with the bolometric AGN\nluminosity, confirming the luminosity-dependent unified scheme. We also show\nthat the completeness of the WISE color-color cut in selecting Swift/BAT AGN\nincreases strongly with 14-195 keV luminosity.\n", "  The variation in area of quiet magnetic network measured over the sunspot\ncycle should modulate the spatially averaged photospheric temperature gradient,\nsince temperature declines with optical depth more gradually in magnetic flux\ntube atmospheres. Yet, limb darkening measurements show no dependence upon\nactivity level, even at an rms precision of 0.04%. We study the sensitivity of\nlimb darkening to changes in area filling factor using a 3D MHD model of the\nmagnetized photosphere. The limb darkening change expected from the measured 11\nyr area variation lies below the level of measured limb darkening variations,\nfor a reasonable range of magnetic flux in quiet network and internetwork\nregions. So the remarkably constant limb darkening observed over the solar\nactivity cycle is not inconsistent with the measured 11 year change in area of\nquiet magnetic network. Our findings offer an independent constraint on\nphotospheric temperature gradient changes reported from measurements of the\nsolar spectral irradiance from the Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM), and\nrecently, from wavelength differential spectrophotometry using the Solar\nOptical Telescope (SOT) aboard the HINODE spacecraft.\n", "  We have compiled the most comprehensive burst sample from magnetar 4U\n0142+61, comprising 27 bursts from its three burst-active episodes in 2011,\n2012 and the latest one in 2015 observed with Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. Bursts\nfrom 4U 0142+61 morphologically resemble typical short bursts from other\nmagnetars. However, 4U 0142+61 bursts are less energetic compared to the bulk\nof magnetar bursts. We uncovered an extended tail emission following a burst on\n2015 February 28, with a thermal nature, cooling over a time-scale of several\nminutes. During this tail emission, we also uncovered pulse peak phase aligned\nX-ray bursts , which could originate from the same underlying mechanism as that\nof the extended burst tail, or an associated and spatially coincident but\ndifferent mechanism.\n", "  A spectroscopic and photometric analysis has been carried out for thirty-two\ncandidate SX_Phe variable blue straggler stars in the Kepler-field (Balona &\nNemec 2012). Radial velocities (RVs), space motions (U,V,W), projected rotation\nvelocities (v sin i), spectral types, and atmospheric characteristics (T_eff,\nlog g, [Fe/H], xi_t, zeta_RT, etc.) are presented for 30 of the 32 stars.\nAlthough several stars are metal-weak with extreme halo orbits, the mean [Fe/H]\nof the sample is near solar, thus the stars are more metal-rich than expected\nfor a typical sample of Pop.II stars, and more like halo metal-rich A-type\nstars (Perry 1969). Two thirds of the stars are fast rotators with v sin i > 50\nkm/s, including four stars with v sin i > 200 km/s. Three of the stars have\n(negative) RVs > 250 km/s, five have retrograde space motions, and 21 have\ntotal speeds (relative to the LSR) > 400 km/s. All but one of the 30 stars have\npositions in a Toomre diagram consistent with the kinematics of bona fide halo\nstars (the exception being a thick-disk star). Observed Roemer time delays,\npulsation frequency modulations and light curves suggest that at least one\nthird of the stars are in binary (or triple) systems with orbital periods\nranging from 2.3 days to more than four years.\n", "  In a search of proper motion catalogs for common proper motion stars in the\nfield of the Kepler spacecraft I identified 93 likely binary systems. A\ncomparison of their rotation periods is a test of the gyrochronology concept.\nTo find their periods I calculated the autocorrelation function of the Kepler\nmission photometry for each star. In most systems for which good periods can be\nfound, the cooler star has a longer period than the hotter component in general\nagreement with models. However, there is a wide range in the gradients of lines\nconnecting binary pairs in a period-color diagram. Furthermore, near the solar\ncolor, only a few stars have longer periods than the Sun, suggesting that they,\nand their cooler companions are not much older than the Sun. In addition, there\nis an apparent gap at intermediate periods in the period distribution of the\nlate K and early M stars. Either star formation in this direction has been\nvariable, or stars evolve in period at a non-uniform rate, or some stars evolve\nmore rapidly than others at the same mass. Finally, using the autocorrelation\nfunction as a measure of the activity level, I found that while the F, G and\nearly K stars become less active as their periods increase, there is no\ncorrelation between period and activity for the mid K to early M stars.\n", "  The main object of the paper is to present the condition of the non-diffusive\npart of the Reynolds stress for driving the double-cell structure of the solar\nmeridional circulation, which has been revealed by recent helioseismic\nobservations. By conducting a set of mean-field hydrodynamic simulations, we\nconfirm for the first time that the double-cell meridional circulation can be\nachieved along with the solar-like differential rotation when the Reynolds\nstress transports the angular momentum upward in the lower part and downward in\nthe upper part of the convection zone. It is concluded that, in a stationary\nstate, the accumulated angular momentum via the Reynolds stress in the middle\nlayer is advected to both the upper and lower parts of the convection zone by\neach of the two meridional circulation cells, respectively.\n", "  We have analized a sample of 327 clusters of galaxies spanning the range\n0.06-0.70 in redshift. Strong constraints on their mean intracluster emission\nby dust have been obtained using maps and catalogs from the HERSCHEL HerMES\nproject; within a radius of 5 arcmin centered in each cluster, the 95% C.L.\nlimits obtained are 86.6, 48.2 and 30.9 mJy at the observed frequencies of 250,\n350 and 500 $\\mu$m. From these restrictions, and assuming physical parameters\ntypical of interstellar media in the Milky Way, we have obtained tight upper\nlimits on the visual extinction of background galaxies due to the intracluster\nmedia: $A_V$(95% C.L.) <~$10^{-3}$ mags. Strong constraints are also obtained\nfor the mass of such dust; for instance using the data at 350 $\\mu$m we\nestablish a 95% upper limit of $<10^9M_\\odot$ within a circle with a radius of\n5 arcmin centered in the clusters. This corresponds to a fraction of the total\nmass of the clusters of $9.5\\times 10^{-6}$, and indicates a deficiency in the\ngas-to-dust ratio in the intracluster media by about three orders of magnitude\nas regards the value found in the Milky Way. Computing the total infrared\nluminosity of the clusters in three ranges of redshift (0.05-0.24, 0.24-0.42\nand 0.42-0.71) and two ranges of mass ($<10^{14}$ and $>10^{14}M_\\odot$)\nrespectively, a strong evolution of luminosity in redshift ($L\\sim z^{1.5}$)\nfor both ranges of masses is found. The results indicate a strong declining in\nstar formation rate with time in the last $\\sim 6$ Gyr.\n", "  Recently in \\cite{34}, the role of electromagnetic field on the cracking of\nspherical polytropes has been investigated without perturbing charge parameter\nexplicitly. In this study, we have examined the occurrence of cracking of\nanisotropic spherical polytropes through perturbing parameters like anisotropic\npressure, energy density and charge. We consider two different types of\npolytropes in this study. We discuss the occurrence of cracking in two\ndifferent ways $(i)$ by perturbing polytropic constant, anisotropy and charge\nparameter $(ii)$ by perturbing polytropic index, anisotropy and charge\nparameter for each case. We conclude that cracking appears for a wide range of\nparameters in both cases. Also, our results are reduced to \\cite{33} in the\nabsence of charge.\n", "  Single star evolution does not allow extremely low-mass stars to cross the\nclassical instability strip (IS) during the Hubble time. However, within binary\nevolution framework low-mass stars can appear inside the IS once the mass\ntransfer (MT) is taken into account. Triggered by a discovery of low-mass 0.26\nMsun RR Lyrae-like variable in a binary system, OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792, we\ninvestigate the occurrence of similar binary components in the IS, which set up\na new class of low-mass pulsators. They are referred to as Binary Evolution\nPulsators (BEPs) to underline the interaction between components, which is\ncrucial for substantial mass loss prior to the IS entrance. We simulate a\npopulation of 500 000 metal-rich binaries and report that 28 143 components of\nbinary systems experience severe MT (loosing up to 90% of mass), followed by at\nleast one IS crossing in luminosity range of RR Lyrae (RRL) or Cepheid\nvariables. A half of these systems enter the IS before the age of 4 Gyr. BEPs\ndisplay a variety of physical and orbital parameters, with the most important\nbeing the BEP mass in range 0.2-0.8 Msun, and the orbital period in range\n10-2500 d. Based on the light curve only, BEPs can be misclassified as genuine\nclassical pulsators, and as such they would contaminate genuine RRL and\nclassical Cepheid variables at levels of 0.8% and 5%, respectively. We state\nthat the majority of BEPs will remain undetected and we discuss relevant\ndetection limitations.\n", "  We report the results of high-resolution ($R \\sim 80,000$) spectroscopic\nobservations of the emission-line object HD 85567, which has been classified as\na FS CMa type object or a pre-main-sequence star. The main goal is to put more\nconstraints on the object's fundamental parameters as well as on its nature and\nevolutionary state. Absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 85567 were found\nsimilar to those of mid B--type dwarfs and correspond to the following\nfundamental parameters: T$_{\\rm eff} = 15000\\pm500$ K, $v \\sin i = 31\\pm3$ km\ns$^{-1}$, $\\log g \\sim 4.0$. The interstellar extinction, A$_V$ $= 0.50\\pm0.02$\nmag, was measured using the strengths of some diffuse interstellar bands. We\nalso obtained $UBV(RI)_{\\rm c}$ images of a $10^{\\prime} \\times 10^{\\prime}$\nregion around the object. Photometry of projectionally close stars was used to\nderive an interstellar extinction law in this direction and resulted in a\ndistance of 1300$\\pm$100 pc to the object and a luminosity of $\\log$\n(L/L$_\\odot) = 3.3\\pm0.2$. We found no significant radial velocity variations\nof the absorption lines in the spectra of HD 85567 obtained during two\nmonth-long periods of time in 2012 and 2015. Our analysis of the spectroscopic\nand photometric data available for the star led us to a conclusion that it\ncannot be a pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be star. We argue that the\ncircumstellar gas and dust were produced during the object's evolution as most\nlikely a binary system, which contains an undetected secondary component and is\nunlikely to be a merger product.\n", "  Heavy ion ratio abundances in Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events,\ne.g.~Fe/O, often exhibit decreases over time. Using particle instruments on the\nACE, SOHO and STEREO spacecraft, we analysed heavy ion data from 4 SEP events\ntaking place between December 2006 and December 2014. We constructed 36\ndifferent ionic pairs and studied their time evolution in each event. We\nquantified the temporal behaviour of abundant SEP ratios by fitting the data to\nderive a decay time constant $B$. We also considered the ratio of ionic\nmass--to--charge for each pair, the $S$ value given e.g.~for Fe/O by $S_{\\rm\nFe/O} = (M/Q)_{\\rm Fe}\\big/(M/Q)_{\\rm O}$. We found that the temporal behaviour\nof SEP ratios is ordered by the value of $S$: ratios with $S>1$ showed\ndecreases over time (i.e.~$B<0$) and those with $S<1$ showed increases ($B>0$).\nWe plotted $B$ as a function of $S$ and observed a clear monotonic dependence:\nratios with a large $S$ decayed at a higher rate. A prominent discontinuity at\n$S=2.0$ (corresponding to He/H) was found in 3 of the 4 events, suggesting\nanomalous behaviour of protons. The X/H ratios often show an initial increase\nfollowed by a decrease, and decay at a slower rate. We discuss possible causes\nof the observed $B$ versus $S$ trends within current understanding of SEP\npropagation.\n", "  We propose a unified description for the constants of motion for\nsuperintegrable deformations of the oscillator and Coulomb systems on\nN-dimensional Euclidean space, sphere and hyperboloid. We also consider the\nduality between these generalized systems and present some example.\n", "  Magnetized neutron stars power at least some ultra-luminous X-ray sources.\nThe accretion flow in these cases is interrupted at the magnetospheric radius\nand then reaches the surface of a neutron star following magnetic field lines.\nAccreting matter moving along magnetic field lines forms the accretion envelope\naround the central object. We show that, in case of high mass accretion rates\n$\\gtrsim 10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$ the envelope becomes closed and optically\nthick, which influences the dynamics of the accretion flow and the\nobservational manifestation of the neutron star hidden behind the envelope.\nParticularly, the optically thick accretion envelope results in a multi-color\nblack-body spectrum originating from the magnetospheric surface. The spectrum\nand photon energy flux vary with the viewing angle, which gives rise to\npulsations characterized by high pulsed fraction and typically smooth pulse\nprofiles. The reprocessing of radiation due to interaction with the envelope\nleads to the disappearance of cyclotron scattering features from the spectrum.\nWe speculate that the super-orbital variability of ultra-luminous X-ray sources\npowered by accreting neutron stars can be attributed to precession of the\nneutron star due to interaction of magnetic dipole with the accretion disc.\n", "  Stellar masses of galaxies are frequently obtained by fitting stellar\npopulation synthesis models to galaxy photometry or spectra. The state of the\nart method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total\nstellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods\nyield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work\nwe improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the\nresolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an\napparent filamentary mass distribution, and a spatial coincidence between mass\nstructures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on\niterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named\nBayesian Successive Priors (BSP). We have applied BSP to M 51, and to a pilot\nsample of 90 spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral\nGalaxy Survey. By comparing quantitatively both methods, we find that the\naverage fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half than\npreviously thought. In contrast with the previous method, the output BSP\nmass-maps bear a better resemblance to near infrared images.\n", "  It has been revealed that the magnetic topology in the solar atmosphere\ndisplays hemispheric preference, i.e., negative/positive helicity in the\nnorthern/southern hemisphere, respectively. However, the strength of the\nhemispheric rule and its cyclic variation are controversial. In this paper, we\napply a new method based on filament drainage to 571 erupting filaments from\n2010 May to 2015 December in order to determine the filament chirality and its\nhemispheric preference. It is found that $91.6\\%$ of our sample of erupting\nfilaments follow the hemispheric rule of helicity sign. It is found that the\nstrength of the hemispheric preference of the quiescent filaments decreases\nslightly from $\\sim$$97\\%$ in the rising phase to $\\sim$$85\\%$ in the declining\nphase of solar cycle 24, whereas the strength of the intermediate filaments\nkeeps a high value around $96\\pm4\\%$ all the time. Only the active-region\nfilaments show significant variations. Their strength of the hemispheric rule\nrises from $\\sim$$63\\%$ to $\\sim$$95\\%$ in the rising phase, and keeps a high\nvalue $82\\pm5\\%$ during the declining phase. Furthermore, during a half-year\nperiod around the solar maximum, their hemispheric preference totally vanishes.\nBesides, we also diagnose the magnetic configurations of the filaments based on\nour indirect method, and found that in our sample of erupting events, $89\\%$\nare inverse-polarity filaments with a flux rope magnetic configuration, whereas\n$11\\%$ are normal-polarity filaments with a sheared arcade configuration.\n", "  We present measurements of the clustering properties of a sample of infrared\n(IR) bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs). Combining 125 deg$^2$ of wide and\ndeep optical images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope\nand all-sky mid-IR (MIR) images taken with Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer,\nwe have discovered 4,367 IR-bright DOGs with $(i - [22])_{\\rm AB}$ $>$ 7.0 and\nflux density at 22 $\\mu$m $>$ 1.0 mJy. We calculate the angular autocorrelation\nfunction (ACF) for a uniform subsample of 1411 DOGs with 3.0 mJy $<$ flux (22\n$mu$m) $<$ 5.0 mJy and $i_{\\rm AB}$ $<$ 24.0. The ACF of our DOG subsample is\nwell-fit with a single power-law, $\\omega (\\theta)$ = (0.010 $\\pm$ 0.003)\n$\\theta^{-0.9}$, where $\\theta$ in degrees. The correlation amplitude of\nIR-bright DOGs is larger than that of IR-faint DOGs, which reflects a\nflux-dependence of the DOG clustering, as suggested by Brodwin et al. (2008).\nWe assume that the redshift distribution for our DOG sample is Gaussian, and\nconsider 2 cases: (1) the redshift distribution is the same as IR-faint DOGs\nwith flux at 22 $\\mu$m $<$ 1.0 mJy, mean and sigma $z$ = 1.99 $\\pm$ 0.45, and\n(2) $z$ = 1.19 $\\pm$ 0.30, as inferred from their photometric redshifts. The\ninferred correlation length of IR-bright DOGs is $r_0$ = 12.0 $\\pm$ 2.0 and\n10.3 $\\pm$ 1.7 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, respectively. IR-bright DOGs reside in massive\ndark matter halos with a mass of $\\log [\\langle M_{\\mathrm{h}} \\rangle /\n(h^{-1} M_{\\odot})]$ = 13.57$_{-0.55}^{+0.50}$ and 13.65$_{-0.52}^{+0.45}$ in\nthe two cases, respectively.\n", "  Diffusive shock acceleration by the shockwaves in supernova remnants (SNRs)\nis widely accepted as the dominant source for Galactic cosmic rays. However, it\nis unknown what determines the maximum energy of accelerated particles. The\nsurrounding environment could be one of the key parameters. The SNR RCW 86\nshows both thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission with different spatial\nmorphologies. These emission originate from the shock-heated plasma and\naccelerated electrons respectively, and their intensities reflect their density\ndistributions. Thus, the remnant provides a suitable laboratory to test\npossible association between the acceleration efficiency and the environment.\nIn this paper, we present results of spatially resolved spectroscopy of the\nentire remnant with Suzaku. The spacially-resolved spectra are well reproduced\nwith a combination of a power-law for synchrotron emission and a two-component\noptically thin thermal plasma, corresponding to the shocked interstellar medium\n(ISM) with kT of 0.3-0.6 keV and Fe-dominated ejecta. It is discovered that the\nphoton index of the nonthermal component becomes smaller with decreasing the\nemission measure of the shocked ISM, where the shock speed has remained high.\nThis result implies that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons in RCW 86\nis higher in the low-density and higher shock speed regions.\n", "  We provide an example of an analysis to explore the optimization of\nobservations of transiting hot jupiters with JWST to characterize their\natmospheres, based on a simple three-parameter forward model. We construct\nexpansive forward model sets for eleven hot jupiters, ten of which are\nrelatively well-characterized, exploring a range of parameters such as\nequilibrium temperature and metallicity, as well as considering host stars over\na wide range in brightness. We compute posterior distributions of our model\nparameters for each planet with all of the available JWST spectroscopic modes\nand several programs of combined observations and compute their effectiveness\nusing the metric of estimated mutual information per degree of freedom. From\nthese simulations, clear trends emerge that provide guidelines for designing a\nJWST observing program. We demonstrate that these guidelines apply over a wide\nrange of planet parameters and target brightnesses for our simple forward\nmodel.\n", "  Transition type dwarf galaxies are thought to be systems undergoing the\nprocess of transformation from a star-forming into a passively evolving dwarf,\nwhich makes them particularly suitable to study evolutionary processes driving\nthe existence of different dwarf morphological types. Here we present results\nfrom a spectroscopic survey of ~200 individual red giant branch stars in the\nPhoenix dwarf, the closest transition type with a comparable luminosity to\n\"classical\" dwarf galaxies. We measure a systemic heliocentric velocity V =\n-21.2 km/s. Our survey reveals the clear presence of prolate rotation, which is\naligned with the peculiar spatial distribution of the youngest stars in\nPhoenix. We speculate that both features might have arisen from the same event,\npossibly an accretion of a smaller system. The evolved stellar population of\nPhoenix is relatively metal-poor (<[Fe/H]> = -1.49+/-0.04 dex) and shows a\nlarge metallicity spread ($\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.51\\pm0.04$\\,dex), with a\npronounced metallicity gradient of -0.13+/-0.01 dex per arcmin similar to\nluminous, passive dwarf galaxies. We also report a discovery of an extremely\nmetal-poor star candidate in Phoenix and discuss the importance of correcting\nfor spatial sampling when interpreting the chemical properties of galaxies with\nmetallicity gradients. This study presents a major leap forward in our\nknowledge of the internal kinematics of the Phoenix transition type dwarf\ngalaxy, and the first wide area spectroscopic survey of its metallicity\nproperties.\n", "  Electronic bands in a square lattice when subjected to a perpendicular\nmagnetic field form the Hofstadter butterfly pattern. We study the evolution of\nthis pattern as a function of bond percolation disorder (removal or dilution of\nlattice bonds). With increasing concentration of the bonds removed, the\nbutterfly pattern gets smoothly decimated. However, in this process of\ndecimation, bands develop interesting characteristics and features. For\nexample, in the high disorder limit, some butterfly-like pattern still persists\neven as most of the states are localized. We also analyze, in the low disorder\nlimit, the effect of percolation on wavefunctions (using inverse participation\nratios) and on band gaps in the spectrum. We explain and provide the reasons\nbehind many of the key features in our results by analyzing small clusters and\nfinite size rings. Furthermore, we study the effect of bond dilution on\ntransverse conductivity($\\sigma_{xy}$). We show that starting from the clean\nlimit, increasing disorder reduces $\\sigma_{xy}$ to zero, even though the\nstrength of percolation is smaller than the classical percolation threshold.\nThis shows that the system undergoes a direct transition from a integer quantum\nHall state to a localized Anderson insulator beyond a critical value of bond\ndilution. We further find that the energy bands close to the band edge are more\nstable to disorder than at the band center. To arrive at these results we use\nthe coupling matrix approach to calculate Chern numbers for disordered systems.\nWe point out the relevance of these results to signatures in\nmagneto-oscillations.\n", "  One of important directions in superstring theory is to reveal the quantum\nnature of black hole. In this paper we embed Schwarzschild black hole into\nsuperstring theory or M-theory, which we call a smeared black hole, and resolve\nquantum corrections to it. Furthermore we boost the smeared black hole along\nthe 11th direction and construct a smeared quantum black 0-brane in 10\ndimensions. Quantum aspects of the thermodynamic for these black objects are\ninvestigated in detail. We also discuss radiations of a string and a D0-brane\nfrom the smeared quantum black 0-brane.\n", "  To ascertain whether photometric decompositions of galaxies into bulges and\ndisks are astrophysically meaningful, we have developed a new technique to\ndecompose spectral data cubes into separate bulge and disk components, subject\nonly to the constraint that they reproduce the conventional photometric\ndecomposition. These decompositions allow us to study the kinematic and stellar\npopulation properties of the individual components and how they vary with\nposition, in order to assess their plausibility as discrete elements, and to\nstart to reconstruct their distinct formation histories. An initial application\nof this method to CALIFA integral field unit observations of three isolated S0\ngalaxies confirms that in regions where both bulge and disc contribute\nsignificantly to the flux they can be physically and robustly decomposed into a\nrotating dispersion-dominated bulge component, and a rotating low-dispersion\ndisc component. Analysis of the resulting stellar populations shows that the\nbulges of these galaxies have a range of ages relative to their discs,\nindicating that a variety of processes are necessary to describe their\nevolution. This simple test case indicates the broad potential for extracting\nfrom spectral data cubes the full spectral data of a wide variety of individual\ngalaxy components, and for using such decompositions to understand the\ninterplay between these various structures, and hence how such systems formed.\n", "  We present the Chandra imaging and spectral analysis of NGC 4968, a nearby (z\n= 0.00986) Seyfert 2 galaxy. We discover extended ($\\sim$1 kpc) X-ray emission\nin the soft band (0.5 - 2 keV) that is neither coincident with the narrow line\nregion nor the extended radio emission. Based on spectral modeling, it is\nlinked to on-going star formation ($\\sim$2.6-4 M$_{\\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$). The soft\nemission at circumnuclear scales (inner $\\sim$400 pc) originates from hot gas,\nwith kT $\\sim$ 0.7 keV, while the most extended thermal emission is cooler (kT\n$\\sim$ 0.3 keV). We refine previous measurements of the extreme Fe K$\\alpha$\nequivalent width in this source (EW = 2.5$^{+2.6}_{-1.0}$ keV), which suggests\nthe central engine is completely embedded within Compton-thick levels of\nobscuration. Using physically motivated models fit to the Chandra spectrum, we\nderive a Compton-thick column density ($N_{\\rm H} > 1.25\\times10^{24}$\ncm$^{-2}$) and an intrinsic hard (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosity of\n$\\sim$3-8$\\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (depending on the presumed geometry of\nthe obscurer), which is over two orders of magnitude larger than that observed.\nThe large Fe K$\\alpha$ EW suggests a spherical covering geometry, which could\nbe confirmed with X-ray measurements above 10 keV. NGC 4968 is similar to other\nactive galaxies that exhibit extreme Fe K$\\alpha$ EWs (i.e., $>$2 keV) in that\nthey also contain ongoing star formation. This work supports the idea that gas\nassociated with nuclear star formation may increase the covering factor of the\nenshrouding gas and play a role in obscuring AGN.\n", "  For decades ever since the early detection in the 1990s of the emission\nspectral features of crystalline silicates in oxygen-rich evolved stars, there\nis a long-standing debate on whether the crystallinity of the silicate dust\ncorrelates with the stellar mass loss rate. To investigate the relation between\nthe silicate crystallinities and the mass loss rates of evolved stars, we carry\nout a detailed analysis of 28 nearby oxygen-rich stars. We derive the mass loss\nrates of these sources by modeling their spectral energy distributions from the\noptical to the far infrared. Unlike previous studies in which the silicate\ncrystallinity was often measured in terms of the crystalline-to-amorphous\nsilicate mass ratio, we characterize the silicate crystallinities of these\nsources with the flux ratios of the emission features of crystalline silicates\nto that of amorphous silicates. This does not require the knowledge of the\nsilicate dust temperatures which are the major source of uncertainties in\nestimating the crystalline-to-amorphous silicate mass ratio. With a Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient of ~0.24, we find that the silicate crystallinities and\nthe mass loss rates of these sources are not correlated. This supports the\nearlier findings that the dust shells of low mass-loss rate stars can contain a\nsignificant fraction of crystalline silicates without showing the\ncharacteristic features in their emission spectra.\n", "  Radio observations suggest that 3C 75, located in the dumbbell shaped galaxy\nNGC 1128 at the center of Abell 400, hosts two colliding jets. Motivated by\nthis source, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using a\nmodified version of the GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement hydrodynamical\nparallel code ($\\mathit{GAMER}$) to study colliding extragalactic jets. We find\nthat colliding jets can be cast into two categories: 1) bouncing jets, in which\ncase the jets bounce off each other keeping their identities, and 2) merging\njets, when only one jet emerges from the collision. Under some conditions the\ninteraction causes the jets to break up into oscillating filaments of opposite\nhelicity, with consequences for their downstream stability. When one jet is\nsignificantly faster than the other and the impact parameter is small, the jets\nmerge; the faster jet takes over the slower one. In the case of merging jets,\nthe oscillations of the filaments, in projection, may show a feature which\nresembles a double helix, similar to the radio image of 3C 75. Thus we\ninterpret the morphology of 3C 75 as a consequence of the collision of two jets\nwith distinctly different speeds at a small impact parameter, with the faster\njet breaking up into two oscillating filaments.\n", "  Binary star-formation theory predicts that close binaries (a<100 AU) will\nexperience periodic pulsed accretion events as streams of material form at the\ninner edge of a circumbinary disk, cross a dynamically cleared gap, and feed\ncircumstellar disks or accrete directly onto the stars. The archetype for the\npulsed-accretion theory is the eccentric, short-period, classical T Tauri\nbinary DQ Tau. Low-cadence (~daily) broadband photometry has shown brightening\nevents near most periastron passages, just as numerical simulations would\npredict for an eccentric binary. Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during\nthe collision of stellar magnetospheres near periastron could, however, produce\nthe same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. To\nreveal the dominate physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau's low-cadence\nobservations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multi-band\nphotometry over 10 orbital periods, supplemented with 27 nights of\nminute-cadence photometry centered on 4 separate periastron passages. While\nboth accretion and stellar flares are present, the dominant timescale and\nmorphology of brightening events are characteristic of accretion. On average,\nthe mass accretion rate increases by a factor of 5 near periastron, in good\nagreement with recent models. Large variability is observed in the morphology\nand amplitude of accretion events from orbit-to-orbit. We argue this is due to\nthe absence of stable circumstellar disks around each star, compounded by\ninhomogeneities at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and within the\naccretion streams themselves. Quasi-periodic apastron accretion events are also\nobserved, which are not predicted by binary accretion theory.\n", "  A large sample of over 38,000 chromospherically active candidate solar-like\nstars and cooler dwarfs from the RAVE survey is addressed in this paper. An\nimproved activity identification with respect to the previous study was\nintroduced to build a catalog of field stars in the Solar neighborhood with an\nexcess emission flux in the calcium infrared triplet wavelength region. The\ncentral result of this work is the calibration of the age--activity relation\nfor the main sequence dwarfs in a range from a few $10 \\; \\mathrm{Myr}$ up to a\nfew Gyr. It enabled an order of magnitude age estimation of the entire active\nsample. Almost 15,000 stars are shown to be younger than $1\\;\\mathrm{Gyr}$ and\n$\\sim$2000 younger than $100\\;\\mathrm{Myr}$. The young age of the most active\nstars is confirmed by their position off the main sequence in the $J-K$ versus\n$N_{UV}-V$ diagram showing strong ultraviolet excess, mid-infrared excess in\nthe $J-K$ versus $W_1-W_2$ diagram and very cool temperatures ($J-K>0.7$). They\noverlap with the reference pre-main sequence RAVE stars often displaying X-ray\nemission. The activity level increasing with the color reveals their different\nnature from the solar-like stars and probably represents an underlying dynamo\ngenerating magnetic fields in cool stars. 50\\% of the RAVE objects from DR5 are\nfound in the TGAS catalog and supplemented with accurate parallaxes and proper\nmotions by Gaia. This makes the database of a large number of young stars in a\ncombination with RAVE's radial velocities directly useful as a tracer of the\nvery recent large-scale star formation history in the Solar neighborhood. The\ndata are available online in the Vizier database.\n", "  GRB 140903A, a short duration $\\gamma-$ray burst (SGRB) detected by {\\it\nSwift}, is characterized by its long-lasting radio emission among SGRBs. In\naddition to the $\\sim 10^{6}$ s radio afterglow emission, the afterglow of GRB\n140903A displays a plateau from $10^3$ s to $7 \\times 10^3 $ s in the X-rays.\nIn this work, we attribute the X-ray plateau to the energy injection into the\ndecelerating blast wave and then model the later radio/optical/X-ray afterglow\nemission within the standard fireball afterglow model. The afterglow emission\nhas been well reproduced with reasonable physical parameters, including a jet\nhalf-opening angle $\\sim 0.05$. We also compare the physical properties of\nSGRBs with and without radio afterglow detections and find that nearby SGRBs\nare brighter and easier to be detected in radio. Such a phenomena has been\ninterpreted within the afterglow model.\n", "  Alfv\\'{e}n waves are believed to play an important role in the heating and\nacceleration of the fast solar wind emanating from coronal holes. Nonlinear\ninteractions between the dominant ${\\bf z}_{+}$ waves and minority ${\\bf\nz}_{-}$ waves have the potential to transfer wave energy either to smaller\nperpendicular scales (\"direct cascade\") or to larger scales (\"inverse\ncascade\"). In this paper we use reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations\nto investigate how the cascade rates $\\epsilon_{\\pm}$ depend on perpendicular\nwavenumber and radial distance from Sun center. For models with a smooth\nbackground atmosphere we find that an inverse cascade ($\\epsilon_{+} < 0$)\noccurs for the dominant waves at radii between 1.4 and 2.5 $R_\\odot$ and\ndimensionless wavenumbers in the inertial range ($15 < a_\\perp < 44$), and a\ndirect cascade ($\\epsilon_{+} > 0$) occurs elsewhere. For a model with density\nfluctuations there are multiple regions with inverse cascade. In both cases the\ncascade rate $\\epsilon_{+}$ varies significantly with perpendicular wavenumber,\nindicating that the cacsade is a highly non-local process. As a result of the\ninverse cascades, the enery dissipation rates are much lower than expected from\na phenomenological model, and are insufficient to maintain the temperature of\nthe background atmosphere. We conclude that RMHD models are unable to reproduce\nthe observed properties of the fast solar wind.\n", "  We present results obtained from a detailed analysis of a deep Chandra\nobservation of the bright FR II radio galaxy 3C~444 in Abell~3847 cluster. A\npair of huge X-ray cavities are detected along North and South directions from\nthe centre of 3C 444. X-ray and radio images of the cluster reveal peculiar\npositioning of the cavities and radio bubbles. The radio lobes and X-ray\ncavities are apparently not spatially coincident and exhibit offsets by ~61 kpc\nand ~77 kpc from each other along the North and South directions, respectively.\nRadial temperature and density profiles reveal the presence of a cool core in\nthe cluster. Imaging and spectral studies showed the removal of substantial\namount of matter from the core of the cluster by the radio jets. A detailed\nanalysis of the temperature and density profiles showed the presence of a\nrarely detected elliptical shock in the cluster. Detection of inflating\ncavities at an average distance of ~55 kpc from the centre implies that the\ncentral engine feeds a remarkable amount of radio power (~6.3 X 10^44 erg/s)\ninto the intra-cluster medium over ~10^8 yr, the estimated age of cavity. The\ncooling luminosity of the cluster was estimated to be ~8.30 X 10^43 erg/s,\nwhich confirms that the AGN power is sufficient to quench the cooling. Ratios\nof mass accretion rate to Eddington and Bondi rates were estimated to be ~0.08\nand 3.5 X 10^4, respectively. This indicates that the black hole in the core of\nthe cluster accretes matter through chaotic cold accretion.\n", "  We gathered two complete samples of $M_{AB}(r)<-18$ ($M_{star} > 10^{9}\nM_{\\odot}$) galaxies, which are representative of the present-day galaxies and\ntheir counterparts at 5 Gyr ago. We analysed their 2D luminosity profiles and\ncarefully decomposed them into bulges, bars and discs. This was done in a very\nconsistent way at the two epochs, by using the same image quality and same\n(red) filters at rest. We classified them into elliptical, lenticular, spiral,\nand peculiar galaxies on the basis of a morphological decision tree. We found\nthat at $z=0$, sub-M* ($10^{9} M_{\\odot} < M_{star} < 1.5 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$) galaxies follow a similar Hubble Sequence compared to their massive\ncounterparts, though with a considerable larger number of (1) peculiar galaxies\nand (2) low surface brightness galaxies. These trends persist in the $z\\sim0.5$\nsample, suggesting that sub-M* galaxies have not reached yet a virialised\nstate, conversely to their more massive counterparts. The fraction of peculiar\ngalaxies is always high, consistent with a hierarchical scenario in which minor\nmergers could have played a more important role for sub-M* galaxies than for\nmore massive galaxies. Interestingly, we also discovered that more than 10\\% of\nthe sub-M* galaxies at z=0.5 are low surface brightness galaxies with clumpy\nand perturbed features that suggest merging. Even more enigmatic is the fact\nthat their disc scale-lengths are comparable to that of M31, while their\nstellar masses are similar to that of the LMC.\n", "  A wind nebula, generating extended X-ray emission, was recently detected\nsurrounding Swift J1834.9-0846. This is the first magnetar for which such a\nwind nebula was found. Here, we investigate whether there is a plausible\nscenario where the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can be sustained without the need\nof advocating for additional sources of energy other than rotational. We do\nthis by using a detailed radiative and dynamical code that studies the\nevolution of the nebula and its particle population in time. We find that such\na scenario indeed exists: Swift J1834.9-0846's nebula can be explained as being\nrotationally-powered, as all other known PWNe are, if it is currently being\ncompressed by the environment. The latter introduces several effects, the most\nimportant of which is the appearance of adiabatic heating, being increasingly\ndominant over the escape of particles as reverberation goes by. The need of\nreverberation naturally explains why this is the only magnetar nebula detected,\nand provides estimates for Swift 1834.9-0846's age.\n", "  Polarimetric observations of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars are a powerful\nway to image protoplanetary disks. However, interpretation of these images is\ndifficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle\nof scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with\nand without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a\nfunction of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are\ndistorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more\neccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations\nare unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks\nwith gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less\npolarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased\ncontrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks,\ngaps can take on the appearance of being localized \"holes\" in brightness rather\nthan full axisymmetric structures. Photocenter offsets along the minor axis of\nthe disk in both total intensity and polarized intensity images can be readily\nexplained by the finite thickness of the disk. Alone, polarized scattered light\nimages of disks do not necessarily reveal intrinsic disk structure. However,\nwhen combined with total intensity images, the orientation of the disk can be\ndeduced and much can be learned about disk structure and dust properties.\n", "  We propose a size-consistent generalization of the recently developed\nspin-extended configuration interaction with singles and doubles (ECISD), where\na CI wave function is explicitly spin-projected. The size-consistent effect is\neffectively incorporated by treating quadruples within the formulation of\ncoupled electron pair approximation. As in coupled-cluster theory, quadruple\nexcitations are approximated by a disconnected product of double excitations.\nDespite its conceptual similarity to the standard single- and multireference\nanalogues, such a generalization requires careful derivation, as the\nspin-projected CI space is non-orthogonal and overcomplete. Although our\nmethods generally yield better results than ECISD, size-consistency is only\napproximately retained because the action of a symmetry-projection operator is\nsize-inconsistent. In this work, we focus on simple models where\nexclusion-principle-violating terms, which eliminate undesired contributions to\nthe correlation effects, are either completely neglected or averaged. These\nmodels possess an orbital-invariant energy functional that is to be minimized\nby diagonalizing an energy-shifted effective Hamiltonian within the singles and\ndoubles manifold. This allows for a straightforward generalization of the ECISD\nanalytical gradients needed to determine molecular properties and geometric\noptimization. Given the multireference nature of the spin-projected\nHartree--Fock method, the proposed approaches are expected to handle static\ncorrelation, unlike single-reference analogues. We critically assess the\nperformance of our methods using dissociation curves of molecules,\nsinglet-triplet splitting gaps, hyperfine coupling constants, and the chromium\ndimer. The size-consistency and size-extensivity of the methods are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper we study the quantum cosmology of homogeneous and isotropic\ncosmology, via the Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal formalism of phase space\nquantization, with perfect fluid as a matter source. The corresponding quantum\ncosmology is described by the Moyal-Wheeler-DeWitt equation which has exact\nsolutions in Moyal phase space, resulting in Wigner quasiprobability\ndistribution functions peaking around the classical paths for large values of\nscale factor. We show that the Wigner functions of these models are peaked\naround the non-singular universes with quantum modified density parameter of\nradiation.\n", "  We present narrow-, broad-band, and WISE archive images, and high- and\nintermediate-resolution long-slit spectra of K 4-37, a planetary nebula that\nhas never been analyzed in detail. Although K 4-37 appears bipolar, the\nmorphokinematical analysis discloses the existence of three distinct axes and\nadditional particular directions in the object, indicating that K 4-37 is a\nmulti-axis planetary nebula that has probably been shaped by several bipolar\noutflows at different directions. A 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$ main-sequence progenitor is\nestimated from the derived high nebular He and N abundances, and very high N/O\nabundance ratio ($\\sim$2.32). The general properties are compatible with K 4-37\nbeing a highly evolved planetary nebula located at $\\sim$14 kpc. The WISE image\nat 22 $\\mu$m reveals K 4-37 to be surrounded by a large ($\\sim$13$\\times$8\npc$^2$) elliptical detached shell probably related to material ejected from the\nAGB progenitor. The observed elliptical morphology suggests deformation of an\noriginally spherical AGB shell by the ISM magnetic field or by the influence of\na companion. We compare K 4-37 and NGC 6309 and found remarkable similarities\nin their physical structure but noticeably different chemical abundances that\nindicate very different progenitor mass. This strongly suggests that,\nirrespective of the initial mass, their (presumably binary) central stars have\nshared a very similar mass ejection history.\n", "  Following up on previous studies, we here complete a full analysis of the\nvoid size distributions of the Cosmic Void Catalog (CVC) based on three\ndifferent simulation and mock catalogs; dark matter, haloes and galaxies. Based\non this analysis, we attempt to answer two questions: Is a 3-parameter\nlog-normal distribution a good candidate to satisfy the void size distributions\nobtained from different types of environments? Is there a direct relation\nbetween the shape parameters of the void size distribution and the\nenvironmental effects? In an attempt to answer these questions, we here find\nthat all void size distributions of these data samples satisfy the 3-parameter\nlog-normal distribution whether the environment is dominated by dark matter,\nhaloes or galaxies. In addition, the shape parameters of the 3-parameter\nlog-normal void size distribution seem highly affected by environment,\nparticularly existing substructures. Therefore, we show two quantitative\nrelations given by linear equations between the skewness and the maximum tree\ndepth, and variance of the void size distribution and the maximum tree depth\ndirectly from the simulated data. In addition to this, we find that the\npercentage of the voids with nonzero central density in the data sets has a\ncritical importance. If the number of voids with nonzero central densities\nreaches greater and or equal to 3.84 percentage in a simulation/mock sample,\nthen a second population is observed in the void size distributions. This\nsecond population emerges as a second peak in the log-normal void size\ndistribution at larger radius.\n", "  We revisited the line spectra emitted from long GRB (LGRB) host galaxies at\nz<0.5 in order to calculate by the detailed modelling of the line ratios the\nphysical conditions and relative abundances in LGRB hosts in this redshift\nrange. We have found lower metallicities than in LGRB hosts at higher z. New\nresults about metallicities and physical conditions in the different regions\nthroughout the LGRB 980425 host at z=0.0085 are presented. In particular, we\nhave found that the effective starburst temperature in the supernova (SN)\nregion is the highest throughout the host galaxy. The low ionization parameter\nreveals that the radiation source is far or somehow prevented from reaching the\nemitting gas in the SN region. The models constrained by a few oxygen, nitrogen\nand sulphur line ratios to Hb in LGRB 980425 host satisfactorily reproduce the\nHeII/Hb and [ArIII]/Hb line ratios. The modelling of the observed\n[SIV]10.51\\mu/[SIII]18.71\\mum and [NeIII]10.6\\mum/[NeII]12.81\\mum line ratios\nfrom LGRB 031203 host galaxy at z=0.105 shows that the mid-IR lines are emitted\nfrom geometrically thin shock dominated filaments which are not reached by the\nphotoionizing flux, while the optical lines are emitted from the radiation\ndominated outflowing clouds.\n", "  One of the main goals of modern cosmology is to search for primordial\ngravitational waves by looking on their imprints in the B-type polarization in\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation. However, this signal is contaminated\nby various sources, including cosmic weak lensing, foreground radiations,\ninstrumental noises, as well as the E-to-B leakage caused by the partial sky\nsurveys, which should be well understood to avoid the misinterpretation of the\nobserved data. In this paper, we adopt the E/B decomposition method suggested\nby Smith in 2006, and study the imprints of E-to-B leakage residuals in the\nconstructed B-type polarization maps, $\\mathcal{B}(\\hat{n})$, by employing\nvarious statistical tools. We find that the effects of E-to-B leakage are\nnegligible for the $\\mathcal{B}$-mode power spectrum, as well as the skewness\nand kurtosis analyses of $\\mathcal{B}$-maps. However, if employing the\nmorphological statistical tools, including Minkowski functionals and/or Betti\nnumbers, we find the effect of leakage can be detected at very high confidence\nlevel, which shows that in the morphological analysis, the leakage can play a\nsignificant role as a contaminant for measuring the primordial B-mode signal\nand must be taken into account for a correct explanation of the data.\n", "  We analyse the theoretical light curves of Cepheid variables at optical ({\\it\nUBVRI}) and near-infrared ({\\it JKL}) wavelengths using the Fourier\ndecomposition and principal component analysis methods. The Cepheid light\ncurves are based on the full amplitude, nonlinear, convective hydrodynamical\nmodels for chemical compositions representative of Cepheids in the Galaxy\n($Y=0.28$, $Z=0.02$), Large Magellanic Cloud ($Y=0.25$, $Z=0.008$) and Small\nMagellanic Cloud ($Y=0.25$, $Z=0.004$). We discuss the variation of light curve\nparameters with different compositions and mass-luminosity levels as a function\nof period and wavelength, and compare our results with observations. For a\nfixed composition, the theoretical amplitude parameters decrease while the\nphase parameters increase with wavelength, similar to the observed Fourier\nparameters. The optical amplitude parameters obtained using canonical\nmass-luminosity Cepheid models, exhibit a large offset with respect to the\nobservations for periods between 7-11 days, when compared to the non-canonical\nmass-luminosity levels. The central minimum of the Hertzsprung progression for\namplitude parameters, shifts to the longer periods with decrease/increase in\nmetallicity/wavelength for both theoretical and observed light curves. The\nprincipal components for Magellanic Clouds Cepheid models are consistent with\nobservations at optical wavelengths. We also observe two distinct populations\nin the first principal component for optical and near-infrared wavelengths\nwhile $J$-band contributes to both populations. Finally, we take into account\nthe variation in the convective efficiency by increasing the adopted mixing\nlength parameter from the standard 1.5 to 1.8. This results in a zero-point\noffset in the bolometric mean magnitudes and in amplitude parameters (except\nclose to 10 days), reducing the systematically large difference in theoretical\namplitudes.\n", "  The hydrodynamical interaction between freely expanding supernova ejecta and\na relativistic wind injected from the central region is studied in analytic and\nnumerical ways. As a result of the collision between the ejecta and the wind, a\ngeometrically thin shell surrounding a hot bubble forms and expands in the\nejecta. We use a self-similar solution to describe the early dynamical\nevolution of the shell and carry out a two-dimensional special relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulation to follow further evolution. The Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability inevitably develops at the contact surface separating the shocked\nwind and ejecta, leading to the complete destruction of the shell and the\nleakage of hot gas from the hot bubble. The leaking hot materials immediately\ncatch up with the outermost layer of the supernova ejecta and thus different\nlayers of the ejecta are mixed. We present the spatial profiles of\nhydrodynamical variables and the kinetic energy distributions of the ejecta. We\nstop the energy injection when a total energy of $10^{52}$ erg, which is 10\ntimes larger than the initial kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta, is\ndeposited into the ejecta and follow the subsequent evolution. From the results\nof our simulations, we consider expected emission from supernova ejecta powered\nby the energy injection at the centre and discuss the possibility that\nsuperluminous supernovae and broad-lined Ic supernovae could be produced by\nsimilar mechanisms.\n", "  Recent lattice QCD calculations of direct CP violation in $K_L \\to \\pi \\pi$\ndecays indicate tension with the experimental results. Assuming this tension to\nbe real, we investigate a possible beyond-the-Standard Model explanation via\nright-handed charged currents. By using chiral perturbation theory in\ncombination with lattice QCD results, we accurately calculate the modification\nof $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ induced by right-handed charged currents and extract\nvalues of the couplings that are necessary to explain the discrepancy, pointing\nto a scale around $10^2$ TeV. We find that couplings of this size are not in\nconflict with constraints from other precision experiments, but next-generation\nhadronic electric dipole moment searches (such as neutron and ${}^{225}$Ra) can\nfalsify this scenario. We work out in detail a direct link, based on chiral\nperturbation theory, between CP violation in the kaon sector and electric\ndipole moments induced by right-handed currents which can be used in future\nanalyses of left-right symmetric models.\n", "  Building on previous work, we have expanded our catalog of evolutionary\nmodels for stars with variable composition; here we present models for stars of\nmass 0.5 - 1.2 Msol, at scaled metallicities of 0.1 - 1.5 Zsol, and specific\nC/Fe, Mg/Fe, and Ne/Fe values of 0.58 - 1.72 C/Fe_sol, 0.54 - 1.84 Mg/Fe_sol\nand 0.5 - 2.0 Ne/Fe_sol, respectively. We include a spread in abundance values\nfor carbon and magnesium based on observations of their variability in nearby\nstars; we choose an arbitrary spread in neon abundance values commensurate with\nthe range seen in other low Z elements due to the difficult nature of obtaining\nprecise measurements of neon abundances in stars. As indicated by the results\nof Truitt et al. (2015), it is essential that we understand how differences in\nindividual elemental abundances, and not just the total scaled metallicity, can\nmeasurably impact a star's evolutionary lifetime and other physical\ncharacteristics. In that work we found that oxygen abundances significantly\nimpacted the stellar evolution; carbon, magnesium, and neon are potentially\nimportant elements to individually consider due to their relatively high (but\nalso variable) abundances in stars. We present 528 new stellar main sequence\nmodels, and we calculate the time-dependent evolution of the associated\nhabitable zone boundaries for each based on mass, temperature, and luminosity.\nWe also reintroduce the 2 Gyr \"Continuously Habitable Zone\" as a useful tool to\nhelp gauge the habitability potential for a given planetary system.\n", "  Optical wide-field surveys with a high cadence are expected to create a new\nfield of astronomy, so-called \"movie astronomy,\" in the near future. The amount\nof data of the observations will be huge, and hence efficient data compression\nwill be indispensable. Here we propose a low-rank matrix approximation with\nsparse matrix decomposition as a promising solution to reduce the data size\neffectively, while preserving sufficient scientific information. We apply one\nof the methods to the movie data obtained with the prototype model of the\nTomo-e Gozen mounted on the 1.0-m Schmidt telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once\nthe full-scale observation of the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will generate ~30\nTB of data per night. We demonstrate that the data are compressed by a factor\nof about 10 in size without losing transient events like optical short\ntransient point-sources and meteors. The intensity of point sources can be\nrecovered from the compressed data. The processing runs sufficiently fast,\ncompared with the expected data-acquisition rate in the actual observing runs.\n", "  This work presents a linear analytical calculation on the stability and\nevolution of a compressible, viscous self-gravitating (SG) Keplerian disc with\nboth horizontal thermal diffusion and a constant cooling timescale when an\naxisymmetric structure is present and freely evolving. The calculation makes\nuse of the shearing sheet model and is carried out for a range of cooling\ntimes. Although the solutions to the inviscid problem with no cooling or\ndiffusion are well known, it is non-trivial to predict the effect caused by the\nintroduction of cooling and of small diffusivities; this work focuses on\nperturbations of intermediate wavelengths, therefore representing an extension\nto the classical stability analysis on thermal and viscous instabilities. For\ndensity wave modes the analysis can be simplified by means of a regular\nperturbation analysis; considering both shear and thermal diffusivities, the\nsystem is found to be overstable for intermediate and long wavelengths for\nvalues of the Toomre parameter $Q \\lesssim 2$; a non-SG instability is also\ndetected for wavelengths $\\gtrsim 18H$, where $H$ is the disc scale height, as\nlong as $\\gamma \\lesssim 1.305$. The regular perturbation analysis does not\nhowever hold for the entropy and potential vorticity slow modes as their ideal\ngrowth rates are degenerate. To understand their evolution, equations for the\naxisymmetric structure's amplitudes in these two quantities are analytically\nderived and their instability regions obtained. The instability appears boosted\nby increasing the value of the adiabatic index and of the Prandtl number, while\nit is quenched by efficient cooling.\n", "  Asymptotic Giant Branch stars are known to produce `cosmic' fluorine but it\nis uncertain whether these stars are the main producers of fluorine in the\nSolar neighborhood or if any of the other proposed formation sites, type II\nsupernovae and/or Wolf-Rayet stars, are more important. Recent articles have\nproposed both Asymptotic Giant Branch stars as well as type II supernovae as\nthe dominant sources of fluorine in the Solar neighborhood.\n  In this paper we set out to determine the fluorine abundance in a sample of\n49 nearby, bright K-giants for which we previously have determined the stellar\nparameters as well as alpha abundances homogeneously from optical\nhigh-resolution spectra. The fluorine abundance is determined from a 2.3 $\\mu$m\nHF molecular line observed with the spectrometer Phoenix.\n  We compare the fluorine abundances with those of alpha elements mainly\nproduced in type II supernovae and find that fluorine and the alpha-elements do\nnot evolve in lock-step, ruling out type II supernovae as the dominating\nproducers of fluorine in the Solar neighborhood.\n  Furthermore, we find a secondary behavior of fluorine with respect to oxygen,\nwhich is another evidence against the type II supernovae playing a large role\nin the production of fluorine in the Solar neighborhood. This secondary\nbehavior of fluorine will put new constraints on stellar models of the other\ntwo suggested production sites: Asymptotic Giant Branch stars and Wolf-Rayet\nstars.\n", "  Continuous injection models of spectral ageing have long been used to\ndetermine the age of radio galaxies from their integrated spectrum; however,\nmany questions about their reliability remain unanswered. With various large\narea surveys imminent (e.g. LOFAR, MeerKAT, MWA) and planning for the next\ngeneration of radio interferometer well underway (e.g. ngVLA, SKA),\ninvestigations of radio galaxy physics are set to shift away from studies of\nindividual sources to the population as a whole. Determining if and how\nintegrated models of spectral ageing can be applied in the era of big data is\ntherefore crucial. In this paper, I compare classical integrated models of\nspectral ageing to recent well resolved studies that use modern analysis\ntechniques on small spatial scales to determine their robustness and validity\nas a source selection method. I find that integrated models are unable to\nrecover key parameters and, even when known a priori, provide a poor, frequency\ndependent description of a source's spectrum. I show a disparity of up to a\nfactor of 6 in age between the integrated and resolved methods but suggest,\neven with these inconsistencies, such models still provide a potential method\nof candidate selection in the search for remnant radio galaxies and in\nproviding a cleaner selection of high redshift radio galaxies in $z - {\\alpha}$\nselected samples.\n", "  We present an investigation of three chemically peculiar (CP) stars and one\nCP star candidate which exhibit photometric periods below 12 hours. New\nspectroscopic observations have been acquired which confirm the peculiar nature\nof all objects. HD 77013 and HD 81076 are classical CP1 (Am) stars; HD 67983 is\na marginal CP1 (Am: ) star, and HD 98000 is a CP2 (Ap) star. We have procured\nobservations from the ASAS-3 and SuperWASP archives and obtained additional\nphotometry in order to verify the results from the sky survey data. We have\nderived astrophysical parameters and investigated the positions of our target\nstars in the MBol versus log Teff diagram, from which information on\nevolutionary status has been derived. We present period analyses and discuss\neach object in detail. From the available data, we propose pulsational\nvariability as the underlying mechanism for the variability in HD 67983, HD\n77013 and HD 81076, which offer the opportunity to study the interaction of\natomic diffusion and pulsation. HD 67983 and HD 77013 exhibit multiperiodic\nvariability in the gamma Doradus frequency realm; HD 81076 is a delta Scuti\nstar. The CP2 star HD 98000 exhibits monoperiodic variability with a frequency\nof f~2.148 c/d (P~0.466 d), which we interpret as the rotational period. If\nthis assumption is correct, HD 98000 is the alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV)\nvariable with the shortest period hitherto observed and thus a very interesting\nobject that might help to investigate the influence of rotational mixing on\nchemical peculiarities.\n", "  We analyze the relationship between star formation (SF), substructure, and\nsupercluster environment in a sample of 107 nearby galaxy clusters using data\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Previous works have investigated the\nrelationships between SF and cluster substructure, and cluster substructure and\nsupercluster environment, but definitive conclusions relating all three of\nthese variables has remained elusive. We find an inverse relationship between\ncluster SF fraction (f_SF) and supercluster environment density, calculated\nusing the galaxy luminosity density field at a smoothing length of 8 h^-1 Mpc\n(D8). The slope of f_SF vs. D8 is -0.008 +/- 0.002. The f_SF of clusters\nlocated in low-density large-scale environments, 0.244 +/- 0.011, is higher\nthan for clusters located in high-density supercluster cores, 0.202 +/- 0.014.\nWe also divide superclusters, according to their morphology, into filament- and\nspider-type systems. The inverse relationship between cluster f_SF and\nlarge-scale density is dominated by filament- rather than spider-type\nsuperclusters. In high-density cores of superclusters, we find a higher f_SF in\nspider-type superclusters, 0.229 +/- 0.016, than in filament-type\nsuperclusters, 0.166 +/- 0.019. Using principal component analysis, we confirm\nthese results and the direct correlation between cluster substructure and SF.\nThese results indicate that cluster SF is affected by both the dynamical age of\nthe cluster (younger systems exhibit higher amounts of SF); the large-scale\ndensity of the supercluster environment (high-density core regions exhibit\nlower amounts of SF); and supercluster morphology (spider-type superclusters\nexhibit higher amounts of SF at high densities).\n", "  In order to perform a more complete census of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in\nthe local Universe, we investigate the use of the HeII~$\\lambda 4685$ emission\nline diagnostic diagram by Shirazi & Brinchmann (2012) in addition to the\nstandard methods based on other optical emission lines. The He II based\ndiagnostics is more sensitive to AGN ionization in the presence of strong star\nformation than conventional line diagnostics. We survey a magnitude-limited\nsample of 63,915 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 at\n$0.02<z<0.05$ and use both the conventional BPT emission line diagnostic\ndiagrams, as well as the HeII diagram to identify AGN. In this sample, 1,075\ngalaxies are selected as AGN using the BPT diagram, while an additional 234\ngalaxies are identified as AGN using the HeII diagnostic diagram, representing\na 22% increase of AGN in the parent galaxy sample. We explore the host galaxy\nproperties of these new HeII selected AGN candidates and find that they are\nmost common in star-forming galaxies on the blue cloud and on the main sequence\nwhere ionization from star-formation is most likely to mask AGN emission in the\nBPT lines. We note in particular a high HeII AGN fraction in galaxies above the\nhigh-mass end of the main sequence where quenching is expected to occur. We use\narchival Chandra observations to confirm the AGN nature of candidates selected\nthrough HeII based diagnostic. Finally, we discuss how this technique can help\ninform galaxy/black hole co-evolution scenarios.\n", "  Until recently, the strong interstellar scattering observed towards the\nGalactic center (GC) black hole, Sgr A*, was thought to come from dense gas\nwithin the GC region. The pulse broadening towards the transient magnetar SGR\nJ1745-2900 near Sgr A* has shown that the source of the scattering is instead\nlocated much closer to Earth, possibly in a nearby spiral arm. We show that a\nsingle HII region along the line of sight, 1.5-4.8 kpc away from Earth with\ndensity $n_e$ of a few 100 cm$^{-3}$ and radius R = 1.8-3.2 pc can explain the\nobserved angular broadening of Sgr A*. Clouds closer to the GC overproduce the\nobserved DM, providing an independent location constraint that agrees with that\nfrom the magnetar pulse broadening. Our model predicts that sources within 10\npc should show the same scattering origin as the magnetar and Sgr A*, while the\nnearest known pulsars with separations > 20 pc should not. The radio spectrum\nof Sgr A* should show a cutoff from free-free absorption at 0.2-1 GHz. For a\nmagnetic field strength $B = 15-70 \\mu$G, the HII region could produce the\nrotation measure of the magnetar, the largest of any known pulsar, without\nrequiring the gas near Sgr A* to be strongly magnetised.\n", "  We investigate the ionization dynamics of atoms irradiated by an intense\nlaser field using a semiclassical model that includes magnetic Lorentz force in\nthe rescattering process. We find that, the electrons tunneled with different\ninitial transverse momenta (i.e., perpendicular to the instantaneous electric\nfield direction) distributed on a specific circle in the momentum plane can\nfinally converge to the same transverse momentum after experiencing Coulomb\nforward scattering. These electron trajectories lead to a bright spot structure\nin the 2D transverse momentum distribution, and particularly in the\nlong-wavelength limit, a nonzero momentum peak in the direction antiparallel to\nthe laser propagation (or radiation pressure) direction. Making analysis of the\nsubcycle dynamics of rescattering trajectories, we unveil the underlying\nmechanism of the anti-intuitive peak. Beyond the strong field approximation and\nthe dipole approximation, we quantitatively predict the spot center and the\npeak position. Our results are compared with a recent experiment and some\ntheoretical predictions are given.\n", "  Although they were first synthesized in chemistry laboratories nearly fifty\nyears ago, the physical properties of the metals PdCoO2, PtCoO2 and PdCrO2 have\nonly more recently been studied in detail. The delafossite structure contains\ntriangular co-ordinated atomic layers, and electrical transport in the\ndelafossite metals is strongly two-dimensional. Their most notable feature is\ntheir in-plane conductivity, which is amazingly high for oxide metals. At room\ntemperature, the conductivity of non-magnetic PdCoO2 and PtCoO2 is higher per\ncarrier than those of any alkali metal and even the most conductive elements,\ncopper and silver. At low temperatures the best crystals have resistivities of\na few n{\\Omega}cm, corresponding to mean free paths of tens of microns. PdCrO2\nis a frustrated antiferromagnetic metal, with magnetic scattering contributing\nto the resistivity at high temperatures and small gaps opening in the Fermi\nsurface below the N\\'eel temperature. There is good evidence that electronic\ncorrelations are weak in the Pd/Pt layers but strong in the Co/Cr layers;\nindeed the Cr layer in PdCrO2 is thought to be a Mott insulator. The\ndelafossite metals therefore act like natural heterostructures between strongly\ncorrelated and nearly free electron sub-systems. Combined with the extremely\nhigh conductivity, they provide many opportunities to study electrical\ntransport and other physical properties in new regimes. The purpose of this\nreview is to describe current knowledge of these fascinating materials and set\nthe scene for what is likely to be a considerable amount of future research.\n", "  A millisecond pulsar is a neutron star that has been substantially spun up by\naccretion from a binary companion. A previously unrecognized factor governing\nthe spin evolution of such pulsars is the crucial effect of non-steady or\ntransient accretion. We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron\nstars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases considering the drastic\nvariation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere\ninteraction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray\ntransients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can\npersistent accretors, even when the spin down due to electromagnetic radiation\nduring quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the\nequilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean\nthat no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each\noutburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which\ndepends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than\nthat for persistent sources. This explains our numerical finding. This finding\nimplies that any meaningful study of neutron star spin and magnetic field\ndistributions requires the inclusion of the transient accretion effect, since\nmost accreting neutron star sources are transients. Our finding also implies\nthe existence of a submillisecond pulsar population, which is not observed.\nThis may point to the need for a competing spin-down mechanism for the\nfastest-rotating accreting pulsars, such as gravitational radiation.\n", "  We study a model of rapidly cooling shocked stellar winds in young massive\nclusters and estimate the circumstances under which secondary star formation,\nout of the reinserted winds from a first stellar generation (1G), is possible.\nWe have used two implementations of the model: a highly idealized\ncomputationally inexpensive spherically symmetric semi-analytic model, and a\ncomplex three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and they are in a\ngood mutual agreement. The results confirm our previous findings that in a\ncluster with 1G mass $10^7$ M$_\\odot$ and half-mass radius $2.38$ pc, the\nshocked stellar winds become thermally unstable, collapse into dense gaseous\nstructures that partially accumulate inside the cluster, self-shield against\nionizing stellar radiation and form the second generation (2G) of stars. We\nhave used the semi-analytic model to explore a subset of the parameter space\ncovering a wide range of the observationally poorly constrained parameters: the\nheating efficiency, $\\eta_\\mathrm{he}$, and the mass loading,\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{ml}$. The results show that the fraction of the 1G stellar winds\naccumulating inside the cluster can be larger than $50$ % if $\\eta_\\mathrm{he}\n\\lesssim 10$ % which is suggested by the observations. Furthermore, for low\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{he}$, the model provides a self-consistent mechanism predicting\n2G stars forming only in the central zones of the cluster. Finally, we have\ncalculated the accumulated warm gas emission in the H30$\\alpha$ recombination\nline, analyzed its velocity profile and estimated its intensity for super star\nclusters in interacting galaxies NGC4038/9 (Antennae) showing that the warm gas\nshould be detectable with ALMA.\n", "  We present a freely available xspec model for the modulations seen in the\nlong-term light curves of multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). By\nincorporating the physics of multiple electron scatterings (ray traced with a\nMonte-Carlo routine), we go beyond analytical predictions and show that the\ngeometrical beaming of radiation in the conical outflow can be more than a\nfactor of 100 for opening angles smaller than $10^\\circ$. We apply our new\nmodel to the long-term, well sampled Swift light curve of the recently\nconfirmed ULX pulsar NGC 5907 X-1 with an established period of 78 days. Our\nresults suggest that geometrical beaming together with a slight precession of\nthe conical wind can describe the light curve with a consistent set of\nparameters for the wind. The small opening angle of roughly\n$10\\mathrm{-}13^\\circ$ implies a highly super-critical flow and boosting\nfactors at the order of $\\mathcal{B}=60\\mathrm{-}90$ that would yield a fairly\nlow surface magnetic field strength of $2\\times 10^{10}\\,$Gauss.\n", "  The origin of the slow solar wind is still a topic of much debate. The\ncontinual emergence of small transient structures from helmet streamers is\nthought to constitute one of the main sources of the slow wind. Determining the\nheight at which these transients are released is an important factor in\ndetermining the conditions under which the slow solar wind forms. To this end,\nwe have carried out a multipoint analysis of small transient structures\nreleased from a north-south tilted helmet streamer into the slow solar wind\nover a broad range of position angles during Carrington Rotation 2137.\nCombining the remote-sensing observations taken by the Solar-TErrestrial\nRElations Observatory (STEREO) mission with coronagraphic observations from the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft, we show that the release\nof such small transient structures (often called blobs), which subsequently\nmove away from the Sun, is associated with the concomitant formation of\ntransient structures collapsing back towards the Sun; the latter have been\nreferred to by previous authors as raining inflows. This is the first direct\nassociation between outflowing blobs and raining inflows, which locates the\nformation of blobs above the helmet streamers and gives strong support that the\nblobs are released by magnetic reconnection.\n", "  We investigate whether the beta function of the finite-$N$ Gross-Neveu model,\nas calculated up to the four-loop level, exhibits evidence for an infrared\nzero. As part of our analysis, we calculate and analyze Pad\\'e approximants to\nthis beta function and evaluate effects of scheme dependence. From our study,\nwe find that in the range of coupling where the perturbative calculation of the\nfour-loop beta function is reliable, it does not exhibit robust evidence for an\ninfrared zero.\n", "  We have mapped 12CO J=3-2 and other molecular lines from the \"water-fountain\"\nbipolar pre-planetary nebula (PPN) IRAS 16342-3814 with ~0.\"35 resolution using\nALMA. We find (i) two very high-speed knotty, jet-like molecular outflows, (ii)\na central high-density (> few x 10^6 cm^{-3}), expanding torus of diameter 1300\nAU, and (iii) the circumstellar envelope of the progenitor AGB, generated by a\nsudden, very large increase in the mass-loss rate to >3.5 x 10^{-4} Msun/yr in\nthe past ~455 yr. Strong continuum emission at 0.89 mm from a central source\n(690 mJy), if due to thermally-emitting dust, implies a substantial mass (0.017\nMsun) of very large (~mm-sized) grains. The measured expansion ages of the\nabove structural components imply that the torus (age~160 yr) and the younger\nhigh-velocity outflow (age~110 yr) were formed soon after the sharp increase in\nthe AGB mass-loss rate. Assuming a binary model for the jets in IRAS 16342, the\nhigh momentum rate for the dominant jet-outflow in IRAS 16342 implies a high\nminimum accretion rate, ruling out standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind\naccretion and wind Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) models with white-dwarf or\nmain-sequence companions. Most likely, enhanced RLOF from the primary or\naccretion modes operating within common envelope evolution are needed.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that star formation depends on the driving of\nmolecular cloud turbulence, and differences in the driving can produce an order\nof magnitude difference in the star formation rate. The turbulent driving is\ncharacterised by the parameter $\\zeta$, with $\\zeta=0$ for compressive,\ncurl-free driving (e.g. accretion or supernova explosions), and $\\zeta=1$ for\nsolenoidal, divergence-free driving (e.g. Galactic shear). Here we develop a\nnew method to measure $\\zeta$ from observations of synchrotron emission from\nmolecular clouds. We calculate statistics of mock synchrotron intensity images\nproduced from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, in which the\ndriving was controlled to produce different values of $\\zeta$. We find that the\nmean and standard deviation of the log-normalised synchrotron intensity are\nsensitive to $\\zeta$, for values of $\\zeta$ between $0$ (curl-free driving) and\n$0.5$ (naturally-mixed driving). We quantify the dependence of zeta on the\ndirection of the magnetic field relative to the line of sight. We provide\nbest-fit formulae for $\\zeta$ in terms of the log-normalised mean and standard\ndeviation of synchrotron intensity, with which $\\zeta$ can be determined for\nmolecular clouds that have similar Alfv\\'enic Mach number to our simulations.\nThese formulae are independent of the sonic Mach number. Signal-to-noise ratios\nlarger than $5$, and angular resolutions smaller than $5\\%$ of the cloud\ndiameter, are required to apply these formulae. Although there are no firm\ndetections of synchrotron emission from molecular clouds, by combining Green\nBank Telescope and Very Large Array observations it should be possible to\ndetect synchrotron emission from molecular clouds, thereby constraining the\nvalue of $\\zeta$.\n", "  Observations of the frequencies of different rotational transitions of the\nmethanol molecule have provided the most sensitive probe to date for changes in\nthe proton-to-electron mass ratio, over space and time. Using methanol\nabsorption detected in the gravitational lens system PKS B1830-211, changes in\nthe proton-to-electron ratio over the last 7.5 billion years have been\nconstrained to a fractional change less than 1.1e-07. Molecular absorption\nsystems at cosmological distances present the best opportunity for constraining\nor measuring changes in the fundamental constants of physics over time,\nhowever, we are now at the stage where potential differences in the morphology\nof the absorbing systems and the background source, combined with their\ntemporal evolution, provide the major source of uncertainty in some systems.\nHere we present the first milliarcsecond resolution observations of the\nmolecular absorption system towards PKS B1830-211. We have imaged the\nabsorption from the 12.2-GHz transition of methanol (which is redshifted to\n6.45 GHz) toward the southwestern component and show that it is possibly offset\nfrom the peak of the continuum emission and partially resolved on\nmilliarcsecond scales. Future observations of other methanol transitions with\nsimilar angular resolution offer the best prospects for reducing systematic\nerrors in investigations of possible changes in the proton-to-electron mass\nratio on cosmological scales.\n", "  Central galaxies (CGs) in galaxy groups and clusters are believed to form and\nassemble a good portion of their stellar mass at early times, but they also\naccrete significant mass at late times via galactic cannibalism, that is\nmerging with companion group or cluster galaxies that experience dynamical\nfriction against the common host dark-matter halo. The effect of these mergers\non the structure and kinematics of the CG depends not only on the properties of\nthe accreted satellites, but also on the orbital parameters of the encounters.\nHere we present the results of numerical simulations aimed at estimating the\ndistribution of merging orbital parameters of satellites cannibalized by the\nCGs in groups and clusters. As a consequence of dynamical friction, the\nsatellites' orbits evolve losing energy and angular momentum, with no clear\ntrend towards orbit circularization. The distributions of the orbital\nparameters of the central-satellite encounters are markedly different from the\ndistributions found for halo-halo mergers in cosmological simulations. The\norbits of satellites accreted by the CGs are on average less bound and less\neccentric than those of cosmological halo-halo encounters. We provide fits to\nthe distributions of the central-satellite merging orbital parameters that can\nbe used to study the merger-driven evolution of the scaling relations of CGs.\n", "  We demonstrate a unified scenario for neutrino mass, baryon asymmetry, dark\nmatter and inflation. In addition to a fermion triplet for the so-called\nminimal dark matter, we extend the standard model by three heavy fields\nincluding a scalar singlet, a fermion triplet and a fermion singlet/Higgs\ntriplet. The heavy scalar singlet, which is expected to drive an inflation, and\nthe dark matter fermion triplet are odd under an unbroken $Z_2^{}$ discrete\nsymmetry, while the other fields are all even. The heavy fermion triplet offers\na tree-level type-III seesaw and then mediates a three-body decay of the\ninflaton into the standard model lepton and Higgs doublets with the dark matter\nfermion triplet. The heavy fermion singlet/Higgs triplet not only results in a\ntype-I/II seesaw at tree level but also contributes to the inflaton decay at\none-loop level. In this scenario, the type-I/II seesaw contains all of the\nphysical CP phases in the lepton sector and hence the CP violation for the\nnon-thermal leptogenesis by the inflaton decay exactly comes from the imaginary\npart of the neutrino mass matrix.\n", "  The recently discovered high-T$_c$ superconductor\nCa$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$ is a unique compound not only because of its low\nsymmetry crystal structure, but also because of its electronic structure which\nhosts Dirac-like metallic bands resulting from (spacer) zig-zag As chains. We\npresent a comprehensive first principles theoretical study of the electronic\nand crystal structures of Ca$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$. After discussing the\nconnection between the crystal structure of the 112 family, which\nCa$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$ is a member of, with the other known structures of\nFe pnictide superconductors, we check the thermodynamic phase stability of\nCaFeAs$_{2}$, and similar hyphothetical compounds SrFeAs$_{2}$ and BaFeAs$_{2}$\nwhich, we find, are slightly higher in energy. We calculate the optical\nconductivity of Ca$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$ using the DFT + DMFT method, and\npredict a large in-plane resistivity anisotropy in the normal phase, which does\nnot originate from electronic nematicity, but is enhanced by the electronic\ncorrelations. In particular, we predict a 0.34 eV peak in the $yy$ component of\nthe optical conductivity of the 30\\% La doped compound, which correponds to\ncoherent interband transitions within a fast-dispersing band arising from the\nzig-zag As-chains which are unique to this compound. We also study the Landau\nfree energy for Ca$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$ including the order parameter\nrelevant for the nematic transition and find that the free energy does not have\nany extra terms that could induce ferro-orbital order. This explains why the\npresence of As chains does not broaden the nematic transition in\nCa$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$FeAs$_{2}$.\n", "  The 2015 Planck data release has placed tight constraints on the class of in\nationary models allowed. The current best fit region favors concave downwards\nin ationary potentials, since they produce a suppressed tensor to scalar index\nratio r. Concave downward potentials have a negative curvature V\"<0, therefore\na tachyonic mass square that drives fluctuations. Furthermore, their use can\nbecome problematic if the field rolls in a part of the potential away from the\nextrema, since the semiclassical approximation of quantum cosmology, used for\nderiving the most probable wavefunction of the universe from the landscape and\nfor addressing the quantum to classical transition, breaks down away from the\nsteepest descent region. We here propose a way of dealing with such potentials\nby inverting the metric signature and solving for the wavefunction of the\nuniverse in the Euclidean sector. This method allows us to extend our theory of\nthe origin of the universe from a quantum multiverse, to a more general class\nof concave inflationary potentials where a straightforward application of the\nsemiclassical approximation fails. The work here completes the derivation of\nmodifications to the Newtonian potential and to the inflationary potential,\nwhich originate from the quantum entanglement of our universe with all others\nin the quantum landscape multiverse, leading to predictions of observational\nsignatures for both types of in ationary models, concave and convex potentials.\n", "  We propose a dual cavity Fabry-Perot interferometer as a wavelength\ncalibrator and a stability tracking device for astronomical spectrograph. The\nFPI consists of two adjoining cavities engraved on a low expansion monoblock\nspacer. A low-finesse astro-cavity is intended for generating a uniform grid of\nreference lines to calibrate the spectrograph and a high-finesse lock-cavity is\nmeant for tracking the stability of the reference lines using optical frequency\nstandards. The differential length changes in two cavities due to temperature\nand vibration perturbations are quantitatively analyzed using finite element\nmethod. An optimized mounting geometry with fractional length changes $\\Delta\nL/L \\approx 1.5\\times 10^{-12}$ is suggested. We also identify conditions\nnecessary to suppress relative length variations between two cavities well\nbelow 10$^{-10}$~m, thus facilitating accurate dimension tracking and\ngeneration of stable reference spectra for Doppler measurement at 10 cms$^{-1}$\nlevel.\n", "  High-mass multiples might form via fragmentation of self-gravitational disks\nor alternative scenarios such as disk-assisted capture. However, only few\nobservational constraints exist on the architecture and disk structure of\nhigh-mass protobinaries and their accretion properties. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a close ($57.9\\pm0.2$mas=170au) high-mass protobinary,\nIRAS17216-3801, where our VLTI/GRAVITY+AMBER near-infrared interferometry\nallows us to image the circumstellar disks around the individual components\nwith 3 milliarcsecond resolution. We estimate the component masses to $\\sim20$\nand $\\sim18 M_{\\odot}$ and find that the radial intensity profiles can be\nreproduced with an irradiated disk model, where the inner regions are excavated\nof dust, likely tracing the dust sublimation region in these disks. The\ncircumstellar disks are strongly misaligned with respect to the binary\nseparation vector, which indicates that the tidal forces did not have time to\nrealign the disks, pointing towards a young dynamical age of the system. We\nconstrain the distribution of the Br$\\gamma$ and CO-emitting gas using\nVLTI/GRAVITY spectro-interferometry and VLT/CRIRES spectro-astrometry and find\nthat the secondary is accreting at a higher rate than the primary. VLT/NACO\nimaging shows $L'$-band emission on 3-4 times larger scales than the binary\nseparation, matching the expected dynamical truncation radius for the\ncircumbinary disk. The IRAS17216-3801 system is $\\sim3\\times$ more massive and\n$\\sim5\\times$ more compact than other high-mass multiplies imaged at infrared\nwavelengths and the first high-mass protobinary system where circumstellar and\ncircumbinary dust disks could be spatially resolved. This opens exciting new\nopportunities for studying star-disk interactions and the role of multiplicity\nin high-mass star formation.\n", "  We uncover a superscattering behavior of pseudospin-1 wave from weak\nscatterers in the subwavelength regime where the scatterer size is much smaller\nthan wavelength. The phenomenon manifests itself as unusually strong scattering\ncharacterized by extraordinarily large values of the cross section even for\narbitrarily weak scatterer strength. We establish analytically and numerically\nthat the physical origin of superscattering is revival resonances, for which\nthe conventional Born theory breaks down. The phenomenon can be experimentally\ntested using synthetic photonic systems.\n", "  Recently, black phosphorus quantum dots were fabricated experimentally.\nMotivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the electronic and\noptical properties of rectangular phosphorene quantum dots (RPQDs) in the\npresence of an in-plane electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field. The\nenergy spectra and wave functions of RPQDs are obtained numerically using the\ntight-binding (TB) approach. We find edge states within the band gap of the\nRPQD which are well separated from the bulk states. In an undoped RPQD and for\nin-plane polarized light, due to the presence of well-defined edge states, we\nfind three types of optical transitions which are between the bulk states,\nbetween the edge and bulk states, and between the edge states. The electric and\nmagnetic fields influence the bulk-to-bulk, edge-to-bulk, and edge-to-edge\ntransitions differently due to the different responses of bulk and edge states\nto these fields.\n", "  We present new deep photometry of the rich globular cluster (GC) systems\naround the Brightest Cluster Galaxies UGC 9799 (Abell 2052) and UGC 10143\n(Abell 2147), obtained with the HST ACS and WFC3 cameras. For comparison, we\nalso present new reductions of similar HST/ACS data for the Coma supergiants\nNGC 4874 and 4889. All four of these galaxies have huge cluster populations (to\nthe radial limits of our data, comprising from 12000 to 23000 clusters per\ngalaxy). The metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) of the GCs can still be\nmatched by a bimodal-Gaussian form where the metal-rich and metal-poor modes\nare separated by ~0.8 dex, but the internal dispersions of each mode are so\nlarge that the total MDF becomes very broad and nearly continuous from [Fe/H] =\n-2.4 to Solar. There are, however, significant differences between galaxies in\nthe relative numbers of \\emph{metal-rich} clusters, suggesting that they\nunderwent significantly different histories of mergers with massive, gas-rich\nhalos. Lastly, the proportion of metal-poor GCs rises especially rapidly\noutside projected radii R > 4 R_eff, suggesting the importance of accreted\ndwarf satellites in the outer halo. Comprehensive models for the formation of\nGCs as part of the hierarchical formation of their parent galaxies will be\nneeded to trace the systematic change in structure of the MDF with galaxy mass,\nfrom the distinctly bimodal form in smaller galaxies up to the broad continuum\nthat we see in the very largest systems.\n", "  We report a new analysis protocol for HCN hyperfine data, based on the\nPYSPECKIT package, and results of using this new protocol to analyse a sample\narea of seven massive molecular clumps from the Census of High- and Medium-mass\nProtostars (CHaMP) survey, in order to derive maps of column density for this\nspecies. There is a strong correlation between the HCN integrated intensity,\nIHCN, and previously reported IHCO+ in the clumps, but IN2H+ is not well\ncorrelated with either of these other two \"dense gas tracers\". The four fitted\nparameters from PYSPECKIT in this region fall in the range of VLSR = 8-10 km/s,\n{\\sigma} V = 1.2-2.2 km/s, Tex = 4-15 K, and {\\tau} = 0.2-2.5. These parameters\nallow us to derive a column density map of these clouds, without limiting\nassumptions about the excitation or opacity. A more traditional (linear) method\nof converting IHCN to total mass column gives much lower clump masses than our\nresults based on the hyperfine analysis. This is primarily due to areas in the\nsample region of low I, low Tex, and high {\\tau} . We conclude that there may\nbe more dense gas in these massive clumps not engaged in massive star formation\nthan previously recognized. If this result holds for other clouds in the CHaMP\nsample, it would have dramatic consequences for the calibration of the\nKennicutt-Schmidt star formation laws, including a large increase in the gas\ndepletion time-scale in such regions.\n", "  We report the results of the parquet renormalization group (RG) analysis of\nthe phase diagram of the most general 5-pocket model for Fe-based\nsuperconductors. We use as an input the orbital structure of excitations near\nthe five pockets made out of $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$, and $d_{xy}$ orbitals and\nargue that there are 40 different interactions between low-energy fermions in\nthe orbital basis. All interactions flow under RG, as one progressively\nintegrates out fermions with higher energies. We find that the low-energy\nbehavior is amazingly simple, despite the large number of interactions. Namely,\nat low-energies the full 5-pocket model effectively reduces either to a\n3-pocket model made of one $d_{xy}$ hole pocket and two electron pockets, or a\n4-pocket model made of two $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ hole pockets and two electron\npockets. The leading instability in the effective 4-pocket model is a\nspontaneous orbital (nematic) order, followed by $s^{+-}$ superconductivity. In\nthe effective 3-pocket model orbital fluctuations are weaker, and the system\ndevelops either $s^{+-}$ superconductivity or stripe SDW. In the latter case,\nnematicity is induced by composite spin fluctuations.\n", "  $\\alpha$-decay properties of the yet unknown nucleus $^{296}$118 are\npredicted using the systematic behavior of parameters of $\\alpha$-nucleus\ndouble-folding potentials. The results are $Q_\\alpha = 11.655 \\pm 0.095$ MeV\nand $T_{1/2} = 0.825$ ms with an uncertainty of about a factor of 4.\n", "  Hybrid superconductor-semiconducting nanowire devices provide an ideal\nplatform to investigating novel intragap bound states, such as the Andreev\nbound states (ABSs), Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, and the Majorana bound\nstates. The competition between Kondo correlations and superconductivity in\nJosephson quantum dot (QD) devices results in two different ground states and\nthe occurrence of a 0-$\\pi$ quantum phase transition. Here we report on\ntransport measurements on hybrid superconductor-InSb nanowire QD devices with\ndifferent device geometries. We demonstrate a realization of continuous\ngate-tunable ABSs with both 0-type levels and $\\pi$-type levels. This allow us\nto manipulate the transition between 0 and $\\pi$ junction and explore charge\ntransport and spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition regime.\nFurthermore, we find a coexistence of 0-type ABS and $\\pi$-type ABS in the same\ncharge state. By measuring temperature and magnetic field evolution of the\nABSs, the different natures of the two sets of ABSs are verified, being\nconsistent with the scenario of phase transition between the singlet and\ndoublet ground state. Our study provides insights into Andreev transport\nproperties of hybrid superconductor-QD devices and sheds light on the crossover\nbehavior of the subgap spectrum in the vicinity of 0-$\\pi$ transition.\n", "  Combining the recently reported electric dipole moment (EDM) of $^{199}$Hg\natom due to breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries with the improved\nrelativistic atomic calculations, precise limits on the tensor-pseudotensor\n(T-PT) electron-nucleus (e-N) coupling coefficient and the nuclear Schiff\nmoment (NSM) interactions are determined. Using these limits with the nuclear\ncalculations, we infer limits on the EDMs of neutron and proton as $d_n < 2.2\n\\times 10^{-26} |e| \\rm{cm}$ and $d_p < 2.1 \\times 10^{-25} |e| \\rm{cm}$,\nrespectively, and on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) parameter and the\ncombined up- and down- quark chromo-EDMs as $|\\bar{\\theta}| < 1.1 \\times\n10^{-10}$ and $|\\tilde{d}_u - \\tilde{d}_d| < 5.5 \\times 10^{-27} |e|\\rm{cm}$,\nrespectively. These are the best limits till date to probe new sources of CP\nviolation beyond the standard model (SM) from a diamagnetic atom. Role of\nconsidering a capable many-body method to account the electron correlation\neffects to all orders for inferring the above limits has been highlighted. From\nthis analysis, constraints on the T-PT e-N coupling coefficient with a large\nrange of mass of a possible dark matter carrier $\\chi$ between the atomic\nelectrons and nucleus are given.\n", "  We present and analyze the possibility of using optical ${\\it u}$-band\nluminosities to estimate star-formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies based on the\ndata from the South Galactic Cap ${\\it u }$ band Sky Survey (SCUSS), which\nprovides a deep ${\\it u}$-band photometric survey covering about 5000 $deg^2$\nof the South Galactic Cap. Based on two samples of normal star-forming galaxies\nselected by the BPT diagram, we explore the correlations between ${\\it\nu}$-band, H$\\alpha$, and IR luminosities by combing SCUSS data with the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and ${\\it Wide}$-${\\it field\\ Infrared\\ Survey\\\nExplorer}$ (${\\it WISE}$). The attenuation-corrected ${\\it u}$-band\nluminosities are tightly correlated with the Balmer decrement-corrected\nH$\\alpha$ luminosities with an rms scatter of $\\sim$ 0.17 dex. The IR-corrected\n${\\it u }$ luminosities are derived based on the correlations between the\nattenuation of ${\\it u}$-band luminosities and ${\\it WISE}$ 12 (or 22) $\\mu$m\nluminosities, and then calibrated with the Balmer-corrected H$\\alpha$\nluminosities. The systematic residuals of these calibrations are tested against\nthe physical properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. We find\nthat the best-fitting nonlinear relations are better than the linear ones and\nrecommended to be applied in the measurement of SFRs. The systematic deviations\nmainly come from the pollution of old stellar population and the effect of dust\nextinction; therefore, a more detailed analysis is needed in the future work.\n", "  Yttrium Iron Garnet is the ubiquitous magnetic insulator used for studying\npure spin currents. The exchange constants reported in the literature vary\nconsiderably between different experiments and fitting procedures. Here we\ncalculate them from first-principles. The local Coulomb correction (U - J) of\ndensity functional theory is chosen such that the parameterized spin model\nreproduces the experimental Curie temperature and a large electronic band gap,\nensuring an insulating phase. The magnon spectrum calculated with our\nparameters agrees reasonably well with that measured by neutron scattering. A\nresidual disagreement about the frequencies of optical modes indicates the\nlimits of the present methodology.\n", "  The nature of three-dimensional reconnection when a twisted flux tube erupts\nduring an eruptive flare or coronal mass ejection is considered. The\nreconnection has two phases: first of all, 3D \"zipper reconnection\" propagates\nalong the initial coronal arcade, parallel to the polarity inversion line\n(PIL), then subsequent quasi-2D \"main phase reconnection\" in the low corona\naround a flux rope during its eruption produces coronal loops and chromospheric\nribbons that propagate away from the PIL in a direction normal to it.\n  One scenario starts with a sheared arcade: the zipper reconnection creates a\ntwisted flux rope of roughly one turn ($2\\pi$ radians of twist), and then main\nphase reconnection builds up the bulk of the erupting flux rope with a\nrelatively uniform twist of a few turns. A second scenario starts with a\npre-existing flux rope under the arcade. Here the zipper phase can create a\ncore with many turns that depend on the ratio of the magnetic fluxes in the\nnewly formed flare ribbons and the new flux rope. Main phase reconnection then\nadds a layer of roughly uniform twist to the twisted central core. Both phases\nand scenarios are modeled in a simple way that assumes the initial magnetic\nflux is fragmented along the PIL. The model uses conservation of magnetic\nhelicity and flux, together with equipartition of magnetic helicity, to deduce\nthe twist of the erupting flux rope in terms the geometry of the initial\nconfiguration.\n  Interplanetary observations show some flux ropes have a fairly uniform twist,\nwhich could be produced when the zipper phase and any pre-existing flux rope\npossess small or moderate twist (up to one or two turns). Other interplanetary\nflux ropes have highly twisted cores (up to five turns), which could be\nproduced when there is a pre-existing flux rope and an active zipper phase that\ncreates substantial extra twist.\n", "  Large scale flows have been a challenging feature of cosmography ever since\ngalaxy scaling relations came on the scene 40 years ago. The next generation of\nsurveys will offer a serious test of the standard cosmology.\n", "  Huge electromagnetic fields are known to be present during the late stages of\nthe dynamics of supernovae. Thus, when dealing with electrodynamics in this\ncontext, the possibility may arise to probe nonlinear theories (generalizations\nof the Maxwellian electromagnetism). We firstly solve Einstein field equations\nminimally coupled to an arbitrary (current-free) nonlinear Lagrangian of\nelectrodynamics (NLED) in the slow rotation regime $a\\ll M$ (black hole's\nmass), up to first order in $a/M$. We then make use of the robust and\nself-contained Born-Infeld Lagrangian in order to compare and contrast the\nphysical properties of such NLED spacetime with its Maxwellian counterpart (a\nslowly rotating Kerr-Newman spacetime), especially focusing on the astrophysics\nof both neutrino flavor oscillations ($\\nu_e \\rightarrow \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$)\nand spin-flip ($\\nu_l \\rightarrow \\nu_r$, \"$l$\" stands for \"left\" and \"$r$\"\nstands for \"right\", change of neutrino handedness) mass level-crossings, the\nequivalent to gyroscopic precessions. Such analysis proves that in the\nspacetime of a slowly rotating nonlinear charged black hole (RNCBH),\nintrinsically associated with the assumption the electromagnetism is nonlinear,\nthe neutrino dynamics in core-collapse supernovae could be significantly\nchanged. In such astrophysical environment a positive enhancement (reduction of\nthe electron fraction $Y_e<0.5$) of the r-process may take place. Consequently,\nit might result in hyperluminous supernova explosions due to enlargement, in\natomic number and amount, of the decaying nuclides. Finally, we envisage some\nphysical scenarios that may lead to short-lived charged black holes with high\ncharge-to-mass ratios (associated with unstable highly magnetized neutron\nstars) and ways to possibly disentangle theories of the electromagnetism from\nother black holes observables (by means of light polarization measurements).\n", "  We report on two-photon photoassociation (PA) spectroscopy of ultracold\nheteronuclear LiRb molecules. This is used to determine the binding energies of\nthe loosely bound levels of the electronic ground singlet and the lowest\ntriplet states of LiRb. We observe strong two-photon PA lines with power\nbroadened line widths greater than 20 GHz at relatively low laser intensity of\n30 W/cm$^{2}$. The implication of this observation on direct atom to molecule\nconversion using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is discussed and\nthe prospect for electronic ground state molecule production is theoretically\nanalyzed.\n", "  Multiple bosons undergoing coherent evolution in a coupled network of sites\nconstitute a so-called quantum walk system. The simplest example of such a\ntwo-particle interference is the celebrated Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. When\nscaling to larger boson numbers, simulating the exact distribution of bosons\nhas been shown, under reasonable assumptions, to be exponentially hard. We\nanalyze the feasibility and expected performance of a globally connected\nsuperconducting resonator based quantum walk system, using the known\ncharacteristics of state-of-the-art components. We simulate the sensitivity of\nsuch a system to decay processes and to perturbations and compare with coherent\ninput states.\n", "  We present the first paper of a series focused on the Blazhko effect in RR\nLyrae type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode, that are located in the\nGalactic bulge. A~comprehensive overview about the incidence rate and\nlight-curve characteristics of the Blazhko stars is given. We analysed 8\\,282\nstars having the best quality data in the OGLE-IV survey, and found that at\nleast $40.3$\\,\\% of stars show modulation of their light curves. The number of\nBlazhko stars we identified is 3\\,341, which is the largest sample ever studied\nimplying the most relevant statistical results currently available. Using\ncombined data sets with OGLE-III observations, we found that 50\\,\\% of stars\nthat show unresolved close peaks to the main component in OGLE-IV are actually\nBlazhko stars with extremely long periods. Blazhko stars with modulation occur\npreferentially among RR Lyrae stars with shorter pulsation periods in the\nGalactic bulge. Fourier amplitude and phase coefficients based on the mean\nlight curves appear to be substantially lower for Blazhko stars than for stars\nwith unmodulated light curve in average. We derived new relations for the\ncompatibility parameter $D_{m}$ in $I$ passband and relations that allow for\ndifferentiating modulated and non-modulated stars easily on the basis of\n$R_{31}$, $\\phi_{21}$ and $\\phi_{31}$. Photometric metallicities, intrinsic\ncolours and absolute magnitudes computed using empirical relations are the same\nfor Blazhko and non-modulated stars in the Galactic bulge suggesting no\ncorrelation between the occurrence of the Blazhko effect and these parameters.\n", "  We present results from the first observations of the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) program for\nWASP-101b, a highly inflated hot Jupiter and one of the community targets\nproposed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Science (ERS)\nprogram. From a single HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observation, we find that\nthe near-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-101b contains no significant\nH$_2$O absorption features and we rule out a clear atmosphere at 13{\\sigma}.\nTherefore, WASP-101b is not an optimum target for a JWST ERS program aimed at\nobserving strong molecular transmission features. We compare WASP-101b to the\nwell studied and nearly identical hot Jupiter WASP-31b. These twin planets show\nsimilar temperature-pressure profiles and atmospheric features in the\nnear-infrared. We suggest exoplanets in the same parameter space as WASP-101b\nand WASP-31b will also exhibit cloudy transmission spectral features. For\nfuture HST exoplanet studies, our analysis also suggests that a lower count\nlimit needs to be exceeded per pixel on the detector in order to avoid unwanted\ninstrumental systematics.\n", "  We present a detailed investigation of the temperature and depth dependence\nof the magnetic properties of 3D topological Kondo insulator SmB6 , in\nparticular near its surface. We find that local magnetic field fluctuations\ndetected in the bulk are suppressed rapidly with decreasing depths,\ndisappearing almost completely at the surface. We attribute the magnetic\nexcitations to spin excitons in bulk SmB6 , which produce local magnetic fields\nof about ~1.8 mT fluctuating on a time scale of ~60 ns. We find that the\nexcitonic fluctuations are suppressed when approaching the surface on a length\nscale of 40-90 nm, accompanied by a small enhancement in static magnetic\nfields. We associate this length scale to the size of the excitonic state.\n", "  The solar s-process abundances have been analyzed in the framework of a\nGalactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model. The aim of this work is to implement\nthe study by Bisterzo et al. (2014), who investigated the effect of one of the\nmajor uncertainties of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) yields, the internal\nstructure of the 13C pocket. We present GCE predictions of s-process elements\ncomputed with additional tests in the light of the suggestions provided in\nrecent publications.\n  The analysis is extended to different metallicities, by comparing GCE results\nand updated spectroscopic observations of unevolved field stars. We verify that\nthe GCE predictions obtained with different tests may represent, on average,\nthe evolution of selected neutron-capture elements in the Galaxy. The impact of\nan additional weak s-process contribution from fast-rotating massive stars is\nalso explored.\n", "  First-principles density functional theory methods are used to investigate\nthe structure, energetics, and vibrational motions of the neutral vacancy\ndefect in diamond. The measured optical absorption spectrum demonstrates that\nthe tetrahedral $T_d$ point group symmetry of pristine diamond is maintained\nwhen a vacancy defect is present. This is shown to arise from the presence of a\ndynamic Jahn-Teller distortion that is stabilised by large vibrational\nanharmonicity. Our calculations further demonstrate that the dynamic\nJahn-Teller-distorted structure of $T_d$ symmetry is lower in energy than the\nstatic Jahn-Teller distorted tetragonal $D_{2d}$ vacancy defect, in agreement\nwith experimental observations. The tetrahedral vacancy structure becomes more\nstable with respect to the tetragonal structure by increasing temperature. The\nlarge anharmonicity arises mainly from quartic vibrations, and is associated\nwith a saddle point of the Born-Oppenheimer surface and a minimum in the free\nenergy. This study demonstrates that the behaviour of Jahn-Teller distortions\nof point defects can be calculated accurately using anharmonic vibrational\nmethods. Our work will open the way for first-principles treatments of dynamic\nJahn-Teller systems in condensed matter.\n", "  In order to establish the doping dependence of the critical current\nproperties in the iron-based superconductors, the in-plane critical current\ndensity (Jc) of BaFe2As2-based superconductors, Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (K-Ba122),\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (Co-Ba122), and BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (P-Ba122) in a wide range of\ndoping concentration (x) was investigated by means of magnetization hysteresis\nloop (MHL) measurements on single-crystal samples. Depending on the dopant\nelements and their concentration, Jc exhibits a variety of magnetic-field (H)\nand temperature (T) dependences. (1) In the case of K-Ba122, MHL of the\nunderdoped samples (x < 0.33) exhibits the second magnetization peak (SMP),\nwhich sustains high Jc at high H and high T, exceeding 10^5 A/cm2 at T = 25 K\nand H = 6 T for x = 0.30. On the other hand, SMP is missing in the optimally (x\n~ 0.36-0.40) and overdoped (x ~ 0.50) samples, and consequently Jc rapidly\ndecreases by more than one order of magnitude, although the change in Tc is\nwithin a few K. (2) For Co-Ba122, SMP is always present over the entire\nsuperconducting (SC) dome from the under (x ~ 0.05) to the overdoped (x ~ 0.12)\nregion. However, the magnitude of Jc significantly changes with x, exhibiting a\nsharp maximum at x ~ 0.057, which is a slightly underdoped composition for\nCo-Ba122. (3) For P-Ba122, the highest Jc is attained at x = 0.30 corresponding\nto the highest Tc composition. For the overdoped samples, MHL is characterized\nby SMP located close to the irreversibility field. Common to the three doping\nvariations, Jc becomes highest at the under-doping side of SC dome near the\nphase boundary between SC phase and the antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase.\nAlso, the peak appears in a narrow range of doping, distinct from the Tc dome\nwith broad maximum. These similarities in the three cases indicate that the\nobserved doping dependence of Jc is intrinsic to the BaFe2As2-based\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Magnetized plasma jets are generally modeled as magnetic flux tubes filled\nwith flowing plasma governed by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We outline here a\nmore fundamental approach based on flux tubes of canonical vorticity, where\ncanonical vorticity is defined as the circulation of the species canonical\nmomentum. This approach extends the concept of magnetic flux tube evolution to\ninclude the effects of finite particle momentum and enables visualization of\nthe topology of plasma jets in regimes beyond MHD. A flared, current-carrying\nmagnetic flux tube in an ion-electron plasma with finite ion momentum is thus\nequivalent to either a pair of electron and ion flow flux tubes, a pair of\nelectron and ion canonical momentum flux tubes, or a pair of electron and ion\ncanonical vorticity flux tubes. We examine the morphology of all these flux\ntubes for increasing electrical currents, different radial current profiles,\ndifferent electron Mach numbers, and a fixed, flared, axisymmetric magnetic\ngeometry. Calculations of gauge-invariant relative canonical helicities track\nthe evolution of magnetic, cross, and kinetic helicities in the system, and\nshow that ion flow fields can unwind to compensate for an increasing magnetic\ntwist. The results demonstrate that including a species finite momentum can\nresult in a very long collimated canonical vorticity flux tube even if the\nmagnetic flux tube is flared. With finite momentum, particle density gradients\nmust be normal to canonical vorticities, not to magnetic fields, so\nobservations of collimated astrophysical jets could be images of canonical\nvorticity flux tubes instead of magnetic flux tubes.\n", "  Meteoritic abundances of r-process elements are analyzed to deduce the\nhistory of chemical enrichment by r-process from the beginning of disk\nformation to the present time in the solar vicinity, by combining the abundance\ninformation from short-lived radioactive nuclei such as 244Pu with that from\nstable r-process nuclei such as Eu. These two types of nuclei can be associated\nwith one r-process event and cumulation of events till formation of the solar\nsystem, respectively. With help of the observed local star formation history,\nwe deduce the chemical evolution of 244Pu and obtain three main results: (i)\nthe last r-process event occurred 130-140 Myr before formation of the solar\nsystem, (ii) the present-day low 244Pu abundance as measured in deep sea\nreservoirs results from the low recent star formation rate compared to ~4.5 - 5\nGyr ago, and (iii) there were ~15 r-process events in the solar vicinity from\nformation of the Galaxy to the time of solar system formation and ~30 r-process\nevents to the present time. Then, adopting a reasonable hypothesis that a\nneutron star merger is the r-process production site, we find that the ejected\nr-process elements are extensively spread out and mixed with interstellar\nmatter with a mass of ~3.5 million solar masses, which is about 100 times\nlarger than that for supernova ejecta. In addition, the event frequency of\nr-process production is estimated to be one per about 1400 core-collapse\nsupernovae, which is identical to the frequency of neutron star mergers\nestimated from the analysis of stellar abundances.\n", "  NGC 7793 P13 is an ultraluminous X-ray source harboring an accreting pulsar.\nWe report on the detection of a ~65 d period X-ray modulation with Swift\nobservations in this system. The modulation period found in the X-ray band is\nP=65.05+/-0.10 d and the profile is asymmetric with a fast rise and a slower\ndecay. On the other hand, the u-band light curve collected by Swift UVOT\nconfirmed an optical modulation with a period of P=64.24+/-0.13 d. We explored\nthe phase evolution of the X-ray and optical periodicities and propose two\nsolutions. A superorbital modulation with a period of ~2,700-4,700 d probably\ncaused by the precession of a warped accretion disk is necessary to interpret\nthe phase drift of the optical data. We further discuss the implication if this\n~65d periodicity is caused by the superorbital modulation. Estimated from the\nrelationship between the spin-orbital and orbital-superorbital periods of known\ndisk-fed high-mass X-ray binaries, the orbital period of P13 is roughly\nestimated as 3-7 d. In this case, an unknown mechanism with a much longer time\nscale is needed to interpret the phase drift. Further studies on the stability\nof these two periodicities with a long-term monitoring could help us to probe\ntheir physical origins.\n", "  We present 12CO (2-1) data of three Virgo spirals - NGC 4330, NGC 4402 and\nNGC 4522 obtained using the Submillimeter Array. These three galaxies show\nclear evidence of ram pressure stripping due to the cluster medium as found in\nprevious HI imaging studies. Using high-resolution CO data, we investigate how\nthe properties of the inner molecular gas disc change while a galaxy is\nundergoing HI stripping in the cluster. At given sensitivity limits, we do not\nfind any clear signs of molecular gas stripping. However, both its morphology\nand kinematics appear to be quite disturbed as those of HI. Morphological\npeculiarities present in the molecular and atomic gas are closely related with\neach other, suggesting that molecular gas can be also affected by strong ICM\npressure even if it is not stripped. CO is found to be modestly enhanced along\nthe upstream sides in these galaxies, which may change the local star formation\nactivity in the disc. Indeed, the distribution of H$\\alpha$ emission, a tracer\nof recent star formation, well coincides with that of the molecular gas,\nrevealing enhancements near the local CO peak or along the CO compression. FUV\nand H$\\alpha$ share some properties in common, but FUV is always more extended\nthan CO/H$\\alpha$ in the three galaxies, implying that the star-forming disc is\nrapidly shrinking as the molecular gas properties have changed. We discuss how\nICM pressure affects dense molecular gas and hence star formation properties\nwhile diffuse atomic gas is being removed from a galaxy.\n", "  The combination of photometry, spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry of the\nchemically peculiar stars often aims to study the complex physical phenomena\nsuch as stellar pulsation, chemical inhomogeneity, magnetic field and their\ninterplay with stellar atmosphere and circumstellar environment. The prime\nobjective of the present study is to determine the atmospheric parameters of a\nset of Am stars to understand their evolutionary status. Atmospheric abundances\nand basic parameters are determined using full spectrum fitting technique by\ncomparing the high-resolution spectra to the synthetic spectra. To know the\nevolutionary status we derive the effective temperature and luminosity from\ndifferent methods and compare them with the literature. The location of these\nstars in the H-R diagram demonstrate that all the sample stars are evolved from\nthe Zero-Age-Main-Sequence towards Terminal-Age-Main-Sequence and occupy the\nregion of $\\delta$ Sct instability strip. The abundance analysis shows that the\nlight elements e.g. Ca and Sc are underabundant while iron peak elements such\nas Ba, Ce etc. are overabundant and these chemical properties are typical for\nAm stars. The results obtained from the spectropolarimetric analysis shows that\nthe longitudinal magnetic fields in all the studied stars are negligible that\ngives further support their Am class of peculiarity.\n", "  We analyze time evolution of a spherically-symmetric collapsing matter from a\npoint of view that black holes evaporate by nature. We consider conformal\nmatters and solve the semi-classical Einstein equation $G_{\\mu\\nu}=8\\pi G\n\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu} \\rangle$ by using the 4-dimensional Weyl anomaly with a\nlarge $c$ coefficient. Here $\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu} \\rangle$ contains the\ncontribution from both the collapsing matter and Hawking radiation. The\nsolution indicates that the collapsing matter forms a dense object and\nevaporates without horizon or singularity, and it has a surface but looks like\nan ordinary black hole from the outside. Any object we recognize as a black\nhole should be such an object.\n", "  HD 164492C is a spectroscopic triple stellar system that has been recently\ndetected to possess a strong magnetic field. We have obtained high-resolution\nspectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations over a timespan of two years\nand derived physical, chemical, and magnetic properties for this object. The\nsystem is formed by an eccentric close spectroscopic binary (Ca1-Ca2) with a\nperiod of 12.5 days, and a massive tertiary Cb. We calculated the orbital\nparameters of the close pair, reconstructed the spectra of the three\ncomponents, and determined atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances by\nspectral synthesis. From spectropolarimetric observations, multi-epoch\nmeasurements of the longitudinal magnetic fields were obtained. The magnetic\nfield is strongly variable on timescales of a few days, with a most probable\nperiod in the range of 1.4-1.6 days. Star Cb with Teff~25000 K is the\napparently fastest rotator and the most massive star of this triple system and\nhas anomalous chemical abundances with a marked overabundance of helium,\n0.35+/-0.04 by number. We identified this star as being responsible for the\nobserved magnetic field, although the presence of magnetic fields in the\ncomponents of the Ca pair cannot be excluded. Star Ca1 with a temperature of\nabout 24000 K presents a normal chemical pattern, while the least massive star\nCa2 is a mid-B type star (Teff~15000 K) with an overabundance of silicon. The\nobtained stellar parameters of the system components suggest a distance of 1.5\nkpc and an age of 10-15 Myr.\n", "  We present a new large-scale (4 square degrees) simultaneous $^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J$=1$-$0) mapping of L1188 with the PMO 13.7-m\ntelescope. Our observations have revealed that L1188 consists of two nearly\northogonal filamentary molecular clouds at two clearly separated velocities.\nToward the intersection showing large velocity spreads, we find several\nbridging features connecting the two clouds in velocity, and an open arc\nstructure which exhibits high excitation temperatures, enhanced $^{12}$CO and\n$^{13}$CO emission, and broad $^{12}$CO line wings. This agrees with the\nscenario that the two clouds are colliding with each other. The distribution of\nyoung stellar object (YSO) candidates implies an enhancement of star formation\nin the intersection of the two clouds. We suggest that a cloud-cloud collision\nhappened in L1188 about 1~Myr ago, possibly triggering the formation of low-\nand intermediate-mass YSOs in the intersection.\n", "  The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair of qubits plays a critical role in\nmany quantum protocol applications such as quantum communication and quantum\nteleportation. Due to interaction with the environment, an EPR pair might lose\nits entanglement and can no longer serve as useful quantum resources. On the\nother hand, it has been suggested that introducing disorder into environment\nmight help to prevent thermalization and improve the preservation of\nentanglement. Here, we theoretically investigate the time evolution of quantum\nentanglement of an EPR pair in a random-field XXZ spin chain model in the\nAnderson localized (AL) and many-body localized (MBL) phase. We find that the\nentanglement between the qubits decreases and approaches to a plateau in the AL\nphase, but shows a power-law decrease after some critical time determined by\nthe interaction strength in the MBL phase. Our findings, on one hand, shed\nlights on applying AL/MBL to improve quantum information storage; on the other\nhand, can be used as a practical indicator to distinguish the AL and MBL phase.\n", "  A method of determining the optimum number of levels of decomposition in\nsoft-thresholding wavelet denoising using Stationary Wavelet Transform is\npresented here. The method calculates the risk at each level of decomposition\nusing Steins Unbiased Risk Estimate, analogous to calculating the sum square\nerror of the denoising process. The SURE risk is found to reach minimum at the\nsame level of decomposition as the sum square error. The advantage of this\nmethod is that the clean signal need not be known a priori. The method can be\nused with either a priori known noise variance or an estimate of the noise\nvariance. This allows the determination of the optimum level of decomposition\nfor wavelet denoising of an unknown signal so long as the noise variance can be\nestimated.\n", "  Spectral absorption features can be used to constrain the stellar initial\nmass function (IMF) in the integrated light of galaxies. Spectral indices used\nat low redshift are in the far red, and therefore increasingly hard to detect\nat higher and higher redshifts as they pass out of atmospheric transmission and\nCCD detector wavelength windows. We employ IMF-sensitive indices at bluer\nwavelengths. We stack spectra of red, quiescent galaxies around $z=0.4$, from\nthe DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The $z=0.4$ red galaxies have 2 Gyr average\nages so that they cannot be passively evolving precursors of nearby galaxies.\nThey are slightly enhanced in C and Na, and slightly depressed in Ti. Split by\nluminosity, the fainter half appears to be older, a result that should be\nchecked with larger samples in the future. We uncover no evidence for IMF\nevolution between $z=0.4$ and now, but we highlight the importance of sample\nselection, finding that an SDSS sample culled to select archetypal elliptical\ngalaxies at z$\\sim$0 is offset toward a more bottom heavy IMF. Other samples,\nincluding our DEEP2 sample, show an offset toward a more spiral galaxy-like\nIMF. All samples confirm that the reddest galaxies look bottom heavy compared\nwith bluer ones. Sample selection also influences age-color trends: red,\nluminous galaxies always look old and metal-rich, but the bluer ones can be\nmore metal-poor, the same abundance, or more metal-rich, depending on how they\nare selected.\n", "  The nonlinear thin-shell instability (NTSI) may explain some of the turbulent\nhydrodynamic structures that are observed close to the collision boundary of\nenergetic astrophysical outflows. It develops in nonplanar shells that are\nbounded on either side by a hydrodynamic shock, provided that the amplitude of\nthe seed oscillations is sufficiently large. The hydrodynamic NTSI has a\nmicroscopic counterpart in collisionless plasma. A sinusoidal displacement of a\nthin shell, which is formed by the collision of two clouds of unmagnetized\nelectrons and protons, grows and saturates on timescales of the order of the\ninverse proton plasma frequency. Here we increase the wavelength of the seed\nperturbation by a factor 4 compared to that in a previous study. Like in the\ncase of the hydrodynamic NTSI, the increase in the wavelength reduces the\ngrowth rate of the microscopic NTSI. The prolonged growth time of the\nmicroscopic NTSI allows the waves, which are driven by the competing ion\nacoustic instability, to grow to a large amplitude before the NTSI saturates\nand they disrupt the latter. The ion acoustic instability thus imposes a limit\non the largest wavelength that can be destabilized by the NTSI in collisionless\nplasma. The limit can be overcome by binary collisions. We bring forward\nevidence for an overstability of the collisionless NTSI.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the underlying physical mechanism of the\nrecently proposed protocol for superreplication of quantum phase gates [W.\nD\\\"ur, P. Sekatski, and M. Skotiniotis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 120503 (2015)],\nwhich allows to produce up to $N^2$ high-fidelity replicas from N input copies\nin the limit of large N. Our implementation of 1->2 replication of the\nsingle-qubit phase gates is based on linear optics and qubits encoded into\nstates of single photons. We employ the quantum Toffoli gate to imprint\ninformation about the structure of an input two-qubit state onto an auxiliary\nqubit, apply the replicated operation to the auxiliary qubit, and then\ndisentangle the auxiliary qubit from the other qubits by a suitable quantum\nmeasurement. We characterize the replication protocol by full quantum process\ntomography and observe good agreement of the experimental results with theory.\n", "  Methanol (CH$_3$OH) is found to be abundant and widespread towards the\nCentral Molecular Zone, the inner few hundred parsecs of our Galaxy. Its origin\nis, however, not fully understood. It was proposed that the high cosmic ray\nionisation rate in this region could lead to a more efficient non-thermal\ndesorption of this species formed on grain surfaces, but it would also mean\nthat this species is destroyed in a relatively short timescale. In a first\nstep, we run chemical models with a high cosmic ray ionisation rate and find\nthat this scenario can only reproduce the lowest abundances of methanol derived\nin this region ($\\sim$10$^{-9}$-10$^{-8}$). In a second step, we investigate\nanother scenario based on episodic explosions of grain mantles. We find a good\nagreement between the predicted abundances of methanol and the observations. We\nfind that the dominant route for the formation of methanol is through\nhydrogenation of CO on the grains followed by the desorption due to the grain\nmantle explosion. The cyclic aspect of this model can explain the widespread\npresence of methanol without requiring any additional mechanism. We also model\nsilicon monoxide (SiO), another species detected in several molecular clouds of\nthe Galactic Centre. An agreement is found with observations for a high\ndepletion of Si (Si/H $\\sim$ 10$^{-8}$) with respect to the solar abundance.\n", "  Over two decades of exoplanetology have yielded thousands of discoveries, yet\nsome types of systems are yet to be observed. Circumstellar planets around one\nstar in a binary have been found, but not for tight binaries (< 5 AU).\nAdditionally, extra-solar moons are yet to be found. This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body\nmotion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and\nmake it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5-10 yr.\nCircumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational\nchallenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature\nthat may be difficult to identify. This may help explain their present\nnon-detection, or maybe they simply do not exist. Whilst this paper considers\nbinaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries\nfavourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes to the point of being\nguaranteed. Transits of exomoons exhibit a similar behaviour under precession,\nbut unfortunately only have one star to transit rather than two.\n", "  Observationally, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the\nhard X-ray photon index $\\Gamma$ and the Compton reflection scaling factor\n$\\Re$ in active galactic nuclei. In this paper, we propose that the\n$\\Gamma-\\Re$ correlation can be explained within the framework of the\ncondensation of the hot corona onto the cold accretion disc around a\nsupermassive black hole. In the model, it is presumed that, initially, a\nvertically extended hot gas (corona) is supplied to the central supermassive\nblack hole by capturing the interstellar medium and stellar wind. In this\nscenario, when the initial mass accretion rate $\\dot M/ \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}\n\\gtrsim 0.01$, at a critical radius $r_{\\rm d}$, part of the hot gas begins to\ncondense onto the equatorial disc plane of the black hole, forming an inner\ncold accretion disc. Then the matter is accreted in the form of the disc-corona\nstructure extending down to the innermost stable circular orbits of the black\nhole. The size of the inner disc is determined by the initial mass accretion\nrate. With the increase of the initial mass accretion rate, the size of the\ninner disc increases, which results in both the increase of the Compton\nreflection scaling factor $\\Re$ and the increase of the hard X-ray photon index\n$\\Gamma$. By comparing with a sample of Seyfert galaxies with well-fitted X-ray\nspectra, it is found that our model can roughly explain the observations.\nFinally, we discuss the possibility to apply our model to high mass X-ray\nbinaries, which are believed to be fueled by the hot wind from the companion\nstar.\n", "  In a survey conducted between 2011-12 of interstellar Na I D line profiles in\nthe direction of the Vela supernova remnant, a few lines of sight showed\ndramatic changes in low velocity absorption components with respect to profiles\nfrom 1993-1994 reported by Cha & Sembach. Three stars - HD 63578, HD 68217 and\nHD 76161 showed large decrease in strength over the 1993-2012 interval. HD\n68217 and HD 76161 are associated with the Vela SNR whereas HD 63578 is\nassociated with $\\gamma^2$ Velorum wind bubble. Here, we present high spectral\nresolution observations of Ca II K lines obtained with the Southern African\nLarge Telescope (SALT) towards these three stars along with simultaneous\nobservations of Na I D lines. These new spectra confirm that the Na D\ninterstellar absorption weakened drastically between 1993-1994 and 2011-2012\nbut show for the first time that the Ca II K line is unchanged between\n1993-1994 and 2015. This remarkable contrast between the behaviour of Na D and\nCa II K line absorption lines is a puzzle concerning gas presumably affected by\nthe outflow from the SNR and the wind from $\\gamma^2$ Velorum.\n", "  Asteroseismic parameters allow us to measure the basic stellar properties of\nfield giants observed far across the Galaxy. Most of such determinations are,\nup to now, based on simple scaling relations involving the large frequency\nseparation, \\Delta\\nu, and the frequency of maximum power, \\nu$_{max}$. In this\nwork, we implement \\Delta\\nu\\ and the period spacing, {\\Delta}P, computed along\ndetailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and\nhence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data\nreveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and\n19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available.\nAdding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can\ndecrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these\nmethods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived\nfrom isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB\nand RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than\nexpected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent\nmass-transfer events.\n", "  We investigate the correlation of HCN 1-0 with dense gas mass in the Galactic\ncenter. We find that in general (on the ~10 pc size scale of individual\nmolecular cloud cores) HCN 1-0 is well correlated with the dense molecular gas\nmass using a standard log-log relationship. However individual clouds in this\nenvironment show systematic deviations from this relationship that contribute\nto around 0.75 dex of scatter. Most notably, Sgr B2, the most massive cloud in\nthe Galactic center, has an integrated HCN 1-0 intensity of cloud less than\nhalf its mass, and several other clouds including GCM-0.02-0.07 show an\nenhancement of HCN 1-0 by a factor of 2-3 relative to clouds of comparable\nmass. We also find that HCN 1-0 is more intense for a given mass in the\nlarge-scale diffuse emission in the central 300 parsecs compared to the compact\nemission from individual cloud cores. We identify the two primary sources of\nscatter in the relationship between HCN 1-0 and dense gas mass to be\nself-absorption (which reduces the observed HCN 1-0 intensity of Sgr B2) and\nvariations in HCN abundance, which appear to increase the brightness of HCN 1-0\nin GCM-0.02-0.07 and other clouds. We find that these sources of scatter would\nonly contribute to an ~10% error in the dense gas mass inferred from the HCN\n1-0 intensity in the Galactic center. However, the implied order of magnitude\nHCN abundance variations between Galactic center clouds, and the systematic\nnature of these variations warn of potential biases in the use of HCN as dense\ngas mass tracer in more extreme environments, such as AGN and shock-dominated\nregions. Finally, we also investigate other tracers having transitions near 3\nmm, finding that HNCO, HNC and HCO+ largely behave like HCN, while HC3N, and\nCH3CN are higher fidelity tracers of the amount of gas in clouds like Sgr B2\nthat suffer from strong self-absorption of the HCN 1-0 line. [abridged]\n", "  The volume of data generated by modern astronomical telescopes is extremely\nlarge and rapidly growing. However, current high-performance data processing\narchitectures/frameworks are not well suited for astronomers because of their\nlimitations and programming difficulties. In this paper, we therefore present\nOpenCluster, an open-source distributed computing framework to support rapidly\ndeveloping high-performance processing pipelines of astronomical big data. We\nfirst detail the OpenCluster design principles and implementations and present\nthe APIs facilitated by the framework. We then demonstrate a case in which\nOpenCluster is used to resolve complex data processing problems for developing\na pipeline for the Mingantu Ultrawide Spectral Radioheliograph. Finally, we\npresent our OpenCluster performance evaluation. Overall, OpenCluster provides\nnot only high fault tolerance and simple programming interfaces, but also a\nflexible means of scaling up the number of interacting entities. OpenCluster\nthereby provides an easily integrated distributed computing framework for\nquickly developing a high-performance data processing system of astronomical\ntelescopes and for significantly reducing software development expenses.\n", "  We demonstrate an approach for background-free three-dimensional imaging of\ndirector fields in liquid crystals using stimulated Raman scattering\nmicroscopy. This imaging technique is implemented using a single femtosecond\npulsed laser and a photonic crystal fiber, providing Stokes and pump\nfrequencies needed to access Raman shifts of different chemical bonds of\nmolecules and allowing for chemically selective and broadband imaging of both\npristine liquid crystals and composite materials. Using examples of model\nthree-dimensional structures of director fields, we show that the described\ntechnique is a powerful tool for mapping of long-range molecular orientation\npatterns in soft matter via polarized chemical-selective imaging.\n", "  We have observed Markarian 501 in Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray wavelength\nband for 70.6 hours from 15 April to 30 May, 2012 using TACTIC telescope.\nDetailed analysis of $\\sim$66.3 hours of clean data revealed the presence of a\nTeV $\\gamma$-ray signal (686$\\pm$77 $\\gamma$-ray events) from the source\ndirection with a statistical significance of 8.89$\\sigma$ above 850 GeV.\nFurther, a total of 375 $\\pm$ 47 $\\gamma$-ray like events were detected in 25.2\nhours of observation from 22 - 27 May, 2012 with a statistical significance of\n8.05$\\sigma$ indicating that the source has possibly switched over to a\nrelatively high gamma-ray emission state. We have derived time-averaged\ndifferential energy spectrum of the state in the energy range 850 GeV - 17.24\nTeV which fits well with a power law function of the form\n$dF/dE=f_{0}E^{-\\Gamma}$ with $f_{0}= (2.27 \\pm 0.38) \\times 10 ^{-11} $\nphotons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ and $\\Gamma=2.57 \\pm 0.15$. In order to\ninvestigate the source state, we have also used almost simultaneous\nmultiwavelength observations viz: high energy data collected by\n$\\it{Fermi}$-LAT, X-ray data collected by $\\it{Swift}$-XRT and MAXI, optical\nand UV data collected by $\\it{Swift}$-UVOT, and radio data collected by OVRO,\nand reconstructed broad-band Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The obtained\nSED supports leptonic model (homogeneous single zone) for VHE gamma-ray\nemission involving synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton (SSC) processes.\n", "  The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_\\mathrm{CO}$) is known to correlate\nwith the metallicity ($Z$). The dust abundance, which is related to the\nmetallicity, is responsible for this correlation through dust shielding of\ndissociating photons and H$_2$ formation on dust surfaces. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity\n($\\mathcal{D}$--$Z$ relation) affects the H$_2$ and CO abundances (and\n$X_\\mathrm{CO}$) of a `molecular' cloud. For the $\\mathcal{D}$--$Z$ relation,\nwe adopt a dust evolution model developed in our previous work, which treats\nthe evolution of not only dust abundance but also grain sizes in a galaxy.\nShielding of dissociating photons and H$_2$ formation on dust are solved\nconsistently with the dust abundance and grain sizes. As a consequence, our\nmodels {predict consistent metallicity dependence of $X_\\mathrm{CO}$ with\nobservational data}. Among various processes driving dust evolution, grain\ngrowth by accretion has the largest impact on the $X_\\mathrm{CO}$--$Z$\nrelation. The other processes also have some impacts on the\n$X_\\mathrm{CO}$--$Z$ relation, but their effects are minor compared with the\nscatter of the observational data at the metallicity range ($Z\\gtrsim 0.1$\nZ$_\\odot$) where CO could be detected. We also find that dust condensation in\nstellar ejecta has a dramatic impact on the H$_2$ abundance at low\nmetallicities ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Z$_\\odot$), relevant for damped Lyman $\\alpha$\nsystems and nearby dwarf galaxies, and that the grain size dependence of H$_2$\nformation rate is also important.\n", "  About half of human cancers show normal TP53 gene and aberrant overexpression\nof Mdm2 and/or MdmX. This fact promotes a promising cancer therapeutic strategy\nwhich targeting the interactions between p53 and Mdm2/MdmX. For developing the\ninhibitors to disrupt the p53-Mdm2/MdmX interactions, we systematically\ninvestigate structural and interaction characteristics of p53 and inhibitors\nwith Mdm2 and MdmX from atomistic level by exploiting stochastic molecular\ndynamics simulations. We find that some specific $\\alpha$ helices in Mdm2 and\nMdmX structure play key role in their bindings with inhibitors and the hydrogen\nbond formed by residue Trp23 of p53 with its counterpart in Mdm2/MdmX\ndetermines dynamical competition processes of the disruption of Mdm2-p53\ninteraction and replacement of p53 from Mdm2-p53 complex {\\it in vivo}. We hope\nthat the results reported in this paper provide basic information for designing\nfunctional inhibitors and realizing cancer gene therapy.\n", "  Workhorse theories throughout all of physics derive effective Hamiltonians to\ndescribe slow time evolution, even though low-frequency modes are actually\ncoupled to high-frequency modes. Such effective Hamiltonians are accurate\nbecause of \\textit{adiabatic decoupling}: the high-frequency modes `dress' the\nlow-frequency modes, and renormalize their Hamiltonian, but they do not\nsteadily inject energy into the low-frequency sector. Here, however, we\nidentify a broad class of dynamical systems in which adiabatic decoupling fails\nto hold, and steady energy transfer across a large gap in natural frequency\n(`steady downconversion') instead becomes possible, through nonlinear\nresonances of a certain form. Instead of adiabatic decoupling, the special\nfeatures of multiple time scale dynamics lead in these cases to efficiency\nconstraints that somewhat resemble thermodynamics.\n", "  We complete the intrinsic characterization of spherically symmetric solutions\npartially accomplished in a previous paper [Class.Quant.Grav. (2010) 27\n205024]. In this approach we consider every compatible algebraic type of the\nRicci tensor, and we analyze specifically the conformally flat case for perfect\nfluid and Einstein-Maxwell solutions. As a direct application we obtain the\n{\\em ideal} labeling (exclusively involving explicit concomitants of the metric\ntensor) of the Schwarzschild interior metric and the Vaidya solution. The\nStephani universes and some significative subfamilies are also characterized.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical role of inhibitory and highly connected nodes\n(hub) in synchronization and input processing of leaky-integrate-and-fire\nneural networks with short term synaptic plasticity. We take advantage of a\nheterogeneous mean-field approximation to encode the role of network structure\nand we tune the fraction of inhibitory neurons $f_I$ and their connectivity\nlevel to investigate the cooperation between hub features and inhibition. We\nshow that, depending on $f_I$, highly connected inhibitory nodes strongly drive\nthe synchronization properties of the overall network through dynamical\ntransitions from synchronous to asynchronous regimes. Furthermore, a metastable\nregime with long memory of external inputs emerges for a specific fraction of\nhub inhibitory neurons, underlining the role of inhibition and connectivity\nalso for input processing in neural networks.\n", "  The principles behind the computation of protein-ligand binding free energies\nby Monte Carlo integration are described in detail. The simulation provides\ngas-phase binding free energies that can be converted to aqueous energies by\nsolvation corrections. The direct integration simulation has several\ncharacteristics beneficial to free-energy calculations. One is that the number\nof parameters that must be set for the simulation is small and can be\ndetermined objectively, making the outcome more deterministic, with respect to\nchoice of input conditions, as compared to perturbation methods. Second, the\nsimulation is free from assumptions about the starting pose or nature of the\nbinding site. A final benefit is that binding free energies are a direct\noutcome of the simulation, and little processing is required to determine them.\n  The well-studied T4 lysozyme experimental free energy data and crystal\nstructures were used to evaluate the method.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to provide practitioners with further insight\ninto spurious damping forces that can be generated in nonlinear seismic\nresponse history analyses (RHA). The term 'spurious' is used to refer to\ndamping forces that are not present in an elastic system and appear as\nnonlinearities develop: such damping forces are not necessarily intended and\nappear as a result of modifications in the structural properties as it yields\nor damages due to the seismic action. In this paper, two types of spurious\ndamping forces are characterized. Each type has often been treated separately\nin the literature, but each has been qualified as 'spurious', somehow blurring\ntheir differences. Consequently, in an effort to clarify the consequences of\nchoosing a particular viscous damping model for nonlinear RHA, this paper shows\nthat damping models that avoid spurious damping forces of one type do not\nnecessarily avoid damping forces of the other type.\n", "  We present a spectral analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph spectrum of the southern VY Scl nova-like variable BB Doradus,\nobtained as part of a Cycle 20 {\\it HST/COS} survey of accreting white dwarfs\nin cataclysmic variables.\n  BB Dor was observed with {\\it COS} during an intermediate state with a low\nmass accretion rate, thereby allowing an estimate of the white dwarf\ntemperature. The results of our spectral analysis show that the white dwarf is\na significant far ultraviolet component with a temperature of\n$\\sim$35,000-$\\sim$50,000$~$K, assuming a $0.80~M_{\\odot}$ WD mass\n($\\log(g)=8.4$). The disk with a mass accretion rate of $\\approx\n10^{-10}~M_{\\odot}~$yr$^{-1}$ contributes about 1/5 to 1/2 of the far\nultraviolet flux.\n", "  We present a strongly interacting quadruple system associated with the K2\ntarget EPIC 220204960. The K2 target itself is a Kp = 12.7 magnitude star at\nTeff ~ 6100 K which we designate as \"B-N\" (blue northerly image). The host of\nthe quadruple system, however, is a Kp = 17 magnitude star with a composite\nM-star spectrum, which we designate as \"R-S\" (red southerly image). With a 3.2\"\nseparation and similar radial velocities and photometric distances, 'B-N' is\nlikely physically associated with 'R-S', making this a quintuple system, but\nthat is incidental to our main claim of a strongly interacting quadruple system\nin 'R-S'. The two binaries in 'R-S' have orbital periods of 13.27 d and 14.41\nd, respectively, and each has an inclination angle of >89 degrees. From our\nanalysis of radial velocity measurements, and of the photometric lightcurve, we\nconclude that all four stars are very similar with masses close to 0.4 Msun.\nBoth of the binaries exhibit significant ETVs where those of the primary and\nsecondary eclipses 'diverge' by 0.05 days over the course of the 80-day\nobservations. Via a systematic set of numerical simulations of quadruple\nsystems consisting of two interacting binaries, we conclude that the outer\norbital period is very likely to be between 300 and 500 days. If sufficient\ntime is devoted to RV studies of this faint target, the outer orbit should be\nmeasurable within a year.\n", "  We present the second release of value-added catalogues of the LAMOST\nSpectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anticentre (LSS-GAC DR2). The catalogues\npresent values of radial velocity $V_{\\rm r}$, atmospheric parameters ---\neffective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$, surface gravity log$g$, metallicity\n[Fe/H], $\\alpha$-element to iron (metal) abundance ratio [$\\alpha$/Fe]\n([$\\alpha$/M]), elemental abundances [C/H] and [N/H], and absolute magnitudes\n${\\rm M}_V$ and ${\\rm M}_{K_{\\rm s}}$ deduced from 1.8 million spectra of 1.4\nmillion unique stars targeted by the LSS-GAC since September 2011 until June\n2014. The catalogues also give values of interstellar reddening, distance and\norbital parameters determined with a variety of techniques, as well as proper\nmotions and multi-band photometry from the far-UV to the mid-IR collected from\nthe literature and various surveys. Accuracies of radial velocities reach\n5kms$^{-1}$ for late-type stars, and those of distance estimates range between\n10 -- 30 per cent, depending on the spectral signal-to-noise ratios. Precisions\nof [Fe/H], [C/H] and [N/H] estimates reach 0.1dex, and those of [$\\alpha$/Fe]\nand [$\\alpha$/M] reach 0.05dex. The large number of stars, the contiguous sky\ncoverage, the simple yet non-trivial target selection function and the robust\nestimates of stellar radial velocities and atmospheric parameters, distances\nand elemental abundances, make the catalogues a valuable data set to study the\nstructure and evolution of the Galaxy, especially the solar-neighbourhood and\nthe outer disk.\n", "  Flight delay happens every day in airports all over the world. However,\nsystemic investigation in large scales remains a challenge. We collect primary\ndata of domestic departure records from Bureau of Transportation Statistics of\nUnited States, and do empirical statistics with them in form of complementary\ncumulative distributions functions (CCDFs) and transmission function of the\ndelays. Fourteen main airlines are characterized by two types of CCDFs: shifted\npower-law and exponentially truncated shifted power-law. By setting up two\nphenomenological models based on mean-field approximation in temporal regime,\nwe convert effect from other delay factors into a propagation one. Three\nparameters meaningful in measuring airlines emerge as universal metrics.\nMoreover, method used here could become a novel approach to revealing practical\nmeanings hidden in temporal big data in wide fields.\n", "  Three dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations were carried out in order\nto perform a new polarization study of the radio emission of the supernova\nremnant SN 1006. These simulations consider that the remnant expands into a\nturbulent interstellar medium (including both magnetic field and density\nperturbations). Based on the referenced-polar angle technique, a statistical\nstudy was done on observational and numerical magnetic field position-angle\ndistributions. Our results show that a turbulent medium with an adiabatic index\nof 1.3 can reproduce the polarization properties of the SN 1006 remnant. This\nstatistical study reveals itself as a useful tool for obtaining the orientation\nof the ambient magnetic field, previous to be swept up by the main supernova\nremnant shock.\n", "  We construct a self-consistent relativistic Newtonian analogue corresponding\nto gravitational static spherical symmetric spacetime geometries, staring\ndirectly from a generalized scalar relativistic gravitational action in\nNewtonian framework, which gives geodesic equations of motion identical to\nthose of the parent metric. Consequently, the derived velocity-dependent\nrelativistic scalar potential, which is a relativistic generalization of\nNewtonian gravitational potential, exactly reproduces the relativistic\ngravitational features corresponding to any static spherical symmetric\nspacetime geometry in its entirety, including all the experimentally tested\ngravitational effects in the weak field up to the present. This relativistic\nanalogous potential is expected to be quite useful in studying wide range of\nastrophysical phenomena, especially in strong field gravity.\n", "  We derive a method for finding Lie Symmetries for third-order difference\nequations. We use these symmetries to reduce the order of the difference\nequations and hence obtain the solutions of some third-order difference\nequations. We also introduce a technique for obtaining their first integrals.\n", "  We present high-resolution e-MERLIN radio continuum maps of the Dwarf\nIrregular galaxy IC10 at 1.5GHz and 5GHz. We detect 11 compact sources at\n1.5GHz, 5 of which have complementary detections at 5GHz. We classify 3\nextended sources as compact H{\\sc ii} regions within IC10, 5 sources as\ncontaminating background galaxies and identify 3 sources which require\nadditional observations to classify. We do not expect that any of these 3\nsources are Supernova Remnants as they will likely be resolved out at the\nassumed distance of IC10 (0.7Mpc). We correct integrated flux densities of IC10\nfrom the literature for contamination by unrelated background sources and\nobtain updated flux density measurements of $354\\pm11$\\,mJy at 1.5GHz and\n$199\\pm9$\\,mJy at 4.85GHz. The background contamination does not contribute\nsignificantly to the overall radio emission from IC10, so previous analysis\nconcerning its integrated radio properties remain valid.\n", "  We give a concrete description of a controlled quantum stochastic dynamical\nmodel corresponding to a quantum system (a cavity mode) under going continual\nquadrature measurements, with a PID controller acting on the filtered estimate\nfor the mode operator. Central use is made of the input and output pictures\nwhen constructing the model: these unitarily equivalent pictures are presented\nin the paper, and used to transfer concepts relating to the controlled internal\ndynamics to those relating to measurement output, and vice versa. The approach\nshows the general principle for investigating mathematically and physically\nconsistent models in which standard control theoretic methods are to be\nextended to the quantum setting.\n", "  This work discusses about the transport coefficients for non equilibrium hot\nmetals. First, we review the role of the non equilibrium Kappa distribution in\nwhich the Kappa parameter varies with the temperature. A brief discussion\ncompares such distribution with the classical non equilibrium function. Later,\nwe analyze the generalized electrical conductivity obtained from the evolution\nof the Kappa distribution. Also, we reexamine the connection between a\nmaterial-dependent coefficient which can be extracted from the thermionic\nemission and the melting point of the metal. We extend previous studies by\nanalyzing additional metals used as thermionic emitters. Finally, in the light\nof the Wiedemann-Franz Law, we present a new generalized thermal conductivity,\nwhich is also applied to several metals.\n", "  Anhydrous pyroxene-rich interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) have been\nproposed as surface analogs for about two-thirds of all C-complex asteroids.\nHowever, this suggestion appears to be inconsistent with the presence of\nhydrated silicates on the surfaces of some of these asteroids including Ceres.\nHere we report the presence of enstatite (pyroxene) on the surface of two\nC-type asteroids (Ceres and Eugenia) based on their spectral properties in the\nmid-infrared range. The presence of this component is particularly unexpected\nin the case of Ceres because most thermal evolution models predict a surface\nconsisting of hydrated compounds only. The most plausible scenario is that\nCeres' surface has been partially contaminated by exogenous enstatite-rich\nmaterial, possibly coming from the Beagle asteroid family. This scenario\nquestions a similar origin for Ceres and the remaining C-types, and it possibly\nsupports recent results obtained by the Dawn mission (NASA) that Ceres may have\nformed in the very outer solar system. Concerning the smaller C-types such as\nEugenia, both their derived surface composition (enstatite and amorphous\nsilicates) and low density suggest that these bodies accreted from the same\nbuilding blocks, namely chondritic porous, pyroxene-rich IDPs and volatiles\n(mostly water ice), and that a significant volume fraction of these bodies has\nremained unaffected by hydrothermal activity likely implying a late accretion.\nIn addition, their current heliocentric distance may best explain the presence\nor absence of water ice at their surfaces. Finally, we raise the possibility\nthat CI chondrites, Tagish Lake-like material, or hydrated IDPs may be\nrepresentative samples of the cores of these bodies.\n", "  Imidazolium based porous cationic polymers were synthesized using an\ninnovative and facile approach, which takes advantage of the Debus Radziszewski\nreaction to obtain meso- and microporous polymers following click chemistry\nprinciples. In the obtained set of materials, click based porous cationic\npolymers have the same cationic backbone, whereas they bear the commonly used\nanions of imidazolium poly(ionic liquid)s. These materials show hierarchical\nporosity and a good specific surface area. Furthermore, their chemical\nstructure was extensively characterized using ATR FTIR and SS NMR\nspectroscopies, and HR MS. These polymers show good performance towards carbon\ndioxide sorption, especially those possessing the acetate anion. This polymer\nhas an uptake of 2 mmol per g of CO2 at 1 bar and 273 K, a value which is among\nthe highest recorded for imidazolium poly(ionic liquid)s. These polymers were\nalso modified in order to introduce N-heterocyclic carbenes along the backbone.\nCarbon dioxide loading in the carbene-containing polymer is in the same range\nas that of the non-modified versions, but the nature of the interaction is\nsubstantially different. The combined use of in situ FTIR spectroscopy and\nmicrocalorimetry evidenced a chemisorption phenomenon that brings about the\nformation of an imidazolium carboxylate zwitterion.\n", "  We derive a new formulation of the $3D$ compressible Euler equations with\ndynamic entropy exhibiting remarkable null structures and regularity\nproperties. Our results hold for an arbitrary equation of state (which yields\nthe pressure in terms of the density and the entropy) in non-vacuum regions\nwhere the speed of sound is positive. Our work is an extension of our prior\njoint work with J. Luk, in which we derived a similar new formulation in the\nspecial case of a barotropic fluid, that is, when the equation of state depends\nonly on the density. The new formulation comprises covariant wave equations for\nthe Cartesian components of the velocity and the logarithmic density coupled to\na transport equation for the specific vorticity (defined to be vorticity\ndivided by density), a transport equation for the entropy, and some additional\ntransport-divergence-curl-type equations involving special combinations of the\nderivatives of the solution variables. The good geometric structures in the\nequations allow one to use the full power of the vectorfield method in treating\nthe \"wave part\" of the system. In a forthcoming application, we will use the\nnew formulation to give a sharp, constructive proof of finite-time shock\nformation, tied to the intersection of acoustic \"wave\" characteristics, for\nsolutions with nontrivial vorticity and entropy at the singularity. In the\npresent article, we derive the new formulation and overview the central role\nthat it plays in the proof of shock formation.\n", "  Fundamental mechanisms of energy storage, corrosion, sensing, and multiple\nbiological functionalities are directly coupled to electrical processes and\nionic dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. In many cases, these processes are\nspatially inhomogeneous taking place at grain boundaries, step edges, point\ndefects, ion channels, etc. and possess complex time and voltage dependent\ndynamics. This necessitates time-resolved and real-space probing of these\nphenomena. In this review, we discuss the applications of force-sensitive\nvoltage modulated scanning probe microscopy (SPM) for probing electrical\nphenomena at solid-liquid interfaces. We first describe the working principles\nbehind electrostatic and Kelvin Probe Force microscopies (EFM & KPFM) at the\ngas-solid interface, review the state of the art in advanced KPFM methods and\ndevelopments to (i) overcome limitations of classical KPFM, (i) expand the\ninformation accessible from KPFM, and (iii) extend KPFM operation to liquid\nenvironments. We briefly discuss the theoretical framework of the electrical\ndouble layer (EDL) forces and dynamics, the implications and breakdown of\nclassical EDL models for highly charged interfaces, or under high ion\nconcentrations, and briefly describe recent modifications of the classical EDL\ntheory relevant for understanding nanoscale electrical measurements at the\nsolid-liquid interface. We further review the latest achievements in mapping\nsurface charge, dielectric constants, and electrodynamic and electrochemical\nprocesses in liquids. Finally, we outline the key challenges and opportunities\nthat exist in the field of nanoscale electrical measurements in liquid as well\nas provide a roadmap for the future development of liquid KPFM.\n", "  Chemical or enzymatic cross-linking of casein micelles (CMs) increases their\nstability against dissociating agents. In this paper, a comparative study of\nstability between native CMs and CMs cross-linked with genipin (CMs-GP) as a\nfunction of pH is described. Stability to temperature and ethanol were\ninvestigated in the pH range 2.0-7.0. The size and the charge\n($\\zeta$-potential) of the particles were determined by dynamic light\nscattering. Native CMs precipitated below pH 5.5, CMs-GP precipitated from pH\n3.5 to 4.5, whereas no precipitation was observed at pH 2.0-3.0 or pH 4.5-7.0.\nThe isoelectric point of CMs-GP was determined to be pH 3.7. Highest stability\nagainst heat and ethanol was observed for CMs-GP at pH 2, where visible\ncoagulation was determined only after 800 s at 140 $^\\circ$C or 87.5% (v/v) of\nethanol. These results confirmed the hypothesis that cross-linking by GP\nincreased the stability of CMs.\n", "  Network structure can have significant effects on the propagation of\ndiseases, memes, and information on social networks. Such effects depend on the\nspecific type of dynamical process that affects the nodes and edges of a\nnetwork, and it is important to develop tractable models of spreading processes\non networks to explore how network structure affects dynamics. In this paper,\nwe incorporate the idea of \\emph{synergy} into a two-state (\"active\" or\n\"passive\") threshold model of social influence on networks. Our model's update\nrule is deterministic, and the influence of each meme-carrying (i.e., active)\nneighbor can --- depending on a parameter --- either be enhanced or inhibited\nby an amount that depends on the number of active neighbors of a node. Such a\nsynergistic system models social behavior in which the willingness to adopt\neither accelerates or saturates depending on the number of neighbors who have\nadopted that behavior. We illustrate that the synergy parameter in our model\nhas a crucial effect on system dynamics, as it determines whether degree-$k$\nnodes are possible or impossible to activate. We simulate synergistic meme\nspreading on both random-graph models and networks constructed from empirical\ndata. Using a local-tree approximation, we examine the spreading of synergistic\nmemes and find good agreement on all but one of the networks on which we\nsimulate spreading. We find for any network and for a broad family of\nsynergistic models that one can predict which synergy-parameter values allow\ndegree-$k$ nodes to be activated.\n", "  A set of molecular descriptors whose length is independent of molecular size\nis developed for machine learning models that target thermodynamic and\nelectronic properties of molecules. These features are evaluated by monitoring\nperformance of kernel ridge regression models on well-studied data sets of\nsmall organic molecules. The features include connectivity counts, which\nrequire only the bonding pattern of the molecule, and encoded distances, which\nsummarize distances between both bonded and non-bonded atoms and so require the\nfull molecular geometry. In addition to having constant size, these features\nsummarize information regarding the local environment of atoms and bonds, such\nthat models can take advantage of similarities resulting from the presence of\nsimilar chemical fragments across molecules. Combining these two types of\nfeatures leads to models whose performance is comparable to or better than the\ncurrent state of the art. The features introduced here have the advantage of\nleading to models that may be trained on smaller molecules and then used\nsuccessfully on larger molecules.\n", "  The electronic and nuclear spin degrees of freedom for donor impurities in\nsemiconductors form ultra coherent two-level systems that are useful for\nquantum information applications. Spins naturally have magnetic dipoles, so\nalternating current (AC) magnetic fields are frequently used to drive spin\ntransitions and perform quantum gates. These fields can be difficult to\nspatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such\nas AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin\nqubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be\ndriven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by\ndemonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P\nand $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their\ndonor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field\ncontrol since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale. This leads\nto lower power requirements, higher qubit densities, and faster gate times. We\nalso show that this form of control allows for driving nuclear spin qubits at\neither their resonance frequency or the first subharmonic of that frequency,\nthus reducing device bandwidth requirements. Interestingly, as we relax the\nbandwidth requirements, we demonstrate that the computational Hilbert space is\nexpanded to include double quantum transitions, making it feasible to use all\nfour nuclear spin states to implement nuclear-spin-based qudits in Si:As. Based\non these results, one can envision novel high-density, low-power quantum\ncomputing architectures using nuclear spins in silicon.\n", "  Simulations of the elastic strain fields for double Ge/Si quantum dots\nlocated on the same wetting layer are carried out. The cluster approximation is\nused for the atomistic model based on the Keating potential. The spatial\ndistributions of the strain energy density and electron potential energy are\ncalculated using clusters containing atoms of 150 coordination spheres. It is\nshown that the used cluster boundary conditions are close to the periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  This work studies solutions of the scalar wave equation \\[\\Box_g\\phi=0\\] on a\nfixed subextremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m spacetime with non-vanishing charge\n$q$ and mass $M$. In a recent paper, Luk and Oh established that generic smooth\nand compactly supported initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface lead to solutions\nwhich are singular in the $W^{1,2}_{loc}$ sense near the Cauchy horizon in the\nblack hole interior, and it follows easily that they are also singular in the\n$W^{1,p}_{loc}$ sense for $p>2$. On the other hand, the work of Franzen shows\nthat such solutions are non-singular near the Cauchy horizon in the\n$W^{1,1}_{loc}$ sense. Motivated by these results, we investigate the strength\nof the singularity at the Cauchy horizon. We identify a sufficient condition on\nthe black hole interior (which holds for the full subextremal parameter range\n$0<|q|<M$) ensuring $W^{1,p}_{loc}$ blow up near the Cauchy horizon of\nsolutions arising from generic smooth and compactly supported data for every\n$1<p<2$. We moreover prove that provided the spacetime parameters satisfy\n$\\frac{2\\sqrt e}{e+1}<\\frac{|q|}{M}<1$, we in fact have $W^{1,p}_{loc}$ blow up\nnear the Cauchy horizon for such solutions for every $1<p<2$. This shows that\nthe singularity is even stronger than was implied by the work of Luk and Oh for\nthis restricted parameter range.\n", "  Grain boundary diffusion in severely deformed Al-based AA5024 alloy is\ninvestigated. Different states are prepared by combination of equal channel\nangular processing and heat treatments, with the radioisotope $^{57}$Co being\nemployed as a sensitive probe of a given grain boundary state. Its diffusion\nrates near room temperature (320~K) are utilized to quantify the effects of\nsevere plastic deformation and a presumed formation of a previously reported\ndeformation-modified state of grain boundaries, solute segregation at the\ninterfaces, increased dislocation content after deformation and of the\nprecipitation behavior on the transport phenomena along grain boundaries. The\ndominant effect of nano-sized Al$_3$Sc-based precipitates is evaluated using\ndensity functional theory and the Eshelby model for the determination of\nelastic stresses around the precipitates.\n", "  In this article we provide a practical prescription to harness the rigorous\nmicroscopic, quantum level descriptions of light-matter systems provided by\nHopfield diagonalisation for quantum description of nonlinear scattering. A\ngeneral frame to describe the practically important second-order optical\nnonlinearities which underpin sum and difference frequency generation is\ndeveloped for arbitrarily inhomogeneous dielectric environments. Specific\nattention is then focussed on planar systems with optical nonlinearity mediated\nby a polar dielectric $\\beta$-SiC halfspace. In this system we calculate the\nrate of second harmonic generation and the result compared to recent\nexperimental measurements. Furthermore the rate of difference frequency\ngeneration of subdiffraction surface phonon polaritons on the $\\beta$-SiC\nhalfspace by two plane waves is calculated. The developed theory is easily\nintegrated with commercial finite element solvers, opening the way for\ncalculation of second-order nonlinear scattering coefficients in complex\ngeometries which lack analytical linear solutions.\n", "  We have studied radio haloes and relics in nine merging galaxy clusters using\nthe Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The images used for this study were\nobtained from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey which\nwas carried out at 5 frequencies, viz. 88, 118, 154, 188 and 215 MHz. We detect\ndiffuse radio emission in 8 of these clusters. We have estimated the spectra of\nhaloes and relics in these clusters over the frequency range 80-1400 MHz; the\nfirst such attempt to estimate their spectra at low frequencies. The spectra\nfollow a power law with a mean value of $\\alpha = -1.13\\pm0.21$ for haloes and\n$\\alpha = -1.2\\pm0.19$ for relics where, $S \\propto \\nu^{\\alpha}$. We\nreclassify two of the cluster sources as radio galaxies. The low frequency\nspectra are thus an independent means of confirming the nature of cluster\nsources. Five of the nine clusters host radio haloes. For the remaining four\nclusters, we place upper limits on the radio powers of possible haloes in them.\nThese upper limits are a factor of 2-20 below those expected from the $L_{\\rm\nX}-P_{\\rm 1.4}$ relation. These limits are the lowest ever obtained and the\nimplications of these limits to the hadronic model of halo emission are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Local muon density spectra (LMDS) at various zenith angles have been\nreconstructed from the data of two detectors of the Experimental complex NEVOD.\nThe inclined muon bundles at the ground level were detected with the coordinate\ndetector DECOR, and for the near-vertical direction with the calibration\ntelescope system (CTS) of the Cherenkov water detector. In comparison with the\nearlier DECOR results, the experimental statistics has been increased by 2-3\ntimes for different ranges of zenith angle and muon bundle multiplicity and is\nnow based on about 40,000 h of the setup operation. The live time of\nmeasurements with CTS is about 12,000 h. It is found with both setups that the\nslope of LMDS is increasing above the primary energy of about 1017 eV. The\ndetails of the experiment and data analysis are presented.\n", "  We study the impact of vector leptoquarks on the recent anomalies in\nsemileptonic $B$ meson decays such as $R_K$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ etc. We constrain\nthe leptoquark couplings by using the existing data on the branching ratios of\n$B_s \\to l^+ l^-$ and $\\bar{B} \\to X_s l^+ l^-$ processes, where\n$l=e,\\mu,\\tau$. We estimate the branching ratios of $\\bar B \\to D^{(*)} l \\bar\n\\nu_l$ processes using the constrained leptoquark parameter space. We also\ninvestigate the possibility of simultaneous explanation of $R_{D^{(*)}}$, $R_K$\nanomalies in this model.\n", "  It is shown that, in the case of early B-type main-sequence stars, of the\nthree ratios N/C, C/O, and N/O which are regarded as indicators of stellar\nevolution, the ratio N/O is more reliable since it seems to be insensitive to\noverionization of the NII and OII ions. On the other hand, the N/C and C/O\nratios, which include carbon, may contain systematic errors for stars with Teff\n> 18500 K because of neglected overionization of CII ions. The ratio N/O is\nstudied in the atmospheres of 46 early main-sequence B stars. These values of\nN/O are examined as functions of the effective temperature, age, rotation\nspeed, and mass of the stars. Most early B-stars in the main sequence are found\nto have [N / O] = 0 , which indicates that N/O varies little during the main\nsequence stage, and this result is independent of the basic parameters listed\nabove. There are two explanations for the large number of stars with [N / O] =\n0 : it is predicted theoretically that for an initial rotation velocity V0 <\n100 km/s, N/O varies little toward the end of the main sequence stage ([N/O] <\n0.2) and observations show that most early main-sequence B-stars do actually\nhave low initial rotation velocities V0. The few early main-sequence B-stars\nwith higher [N/O] = 0.4-0.8 correspond to models with rotation velocities V0 =\n200-300 km/s. This conclusion is consistent with earlier data for stars with\nthe same masses in a later stage of evolution: the AFG-supergiant and bright\ngiant stage.\n", "  Hyperuniform geometries feature correlated disordered topologies which follow\nfrom a tailored k-space design. Here we study gold plasmonic hyperuniform\nmetasurfaces and we report evidence of the effectiveness of k-space engineering\non both light scattering and light emission experiments. The metasurfaces\npossess interesting directional emission properties which are revealed by\nmomentum spectroscopy as diffraction and fluorescence emission rings at\nsize-specific k-vectors. The opening of these rotational-symmetric patterns\nscales with the hyperuniform correlation length parameter as predicted via the\nspectral function method.\n", "  Solar activity affects the whole heliosphere and near-Earth space\nenvironment. It has been reported in the literature that the mechanism\nresponsible for the solar activity modulation behaves like a low-dimensional\nchaotic system. Studying these kind of physical systems and, in particular,\ntheir temporal evolution requires non-linear analysis methods. To this regard,\nin this work we apply the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to the study\nof two of the most commonly used solar cycle indicators; i.e. the series of the\nsunspots number (SSN), and the radio flux 10.7 cm, with the aim of identifying\npossible dynamical transitions in the system. A task which is particularly\nsuited to the RQA. The outcome of this analysis reveals the presence of large\nfluctuations of two RQA measures; namely the determinism and the laminarity. In\naddition, large differences are also seen between the evolution of the RQA\nmeasures of the SSN and the radio flux. That suggests the presence of\ntransitions in the dynamics underlying the solar activity. Besides it also\nshows and quantifies the different nature of these two solar indices.\nFurthermore, in order to check whether our results are affected by data\nartifacts, we have also applied the RQA to both the recently recalibrated SSN\nseries and the previous one, unveiling the main differences between the two\ndata sets. The results are discussed in light of the recent literature on the\nsubject.\n", "  Air-showers measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory were analyzed in order\nto extract the depth of maximum (Xmax).The results allow the analysis of the\nXmax distributions as a function of energy ($> 10^{17.8}$ eV). The Xmax\ndistributions, their mean and standard deviation are analyzed with the help of\nshower simulations with the aim of interpreting the mass composition. The mean\nand standard deviation were used to derive <ln A> and its variance as a\nfunction of energy. The fraction of four components (p, He, N and Fe) were fit\nto the Xmax distributions. Regardless of the hadronic model used the data is\nbetter described by a mix of light, intermediate and heavy primaries. Also,\nindependent of the hadronic models, a decrease of the proton flux with energy\nis observed. No significant contribution of iron nuclei is derived in the\nentire energy range studied.\n", "  Accounting for elasto-plastic motion in granular media, hypoplasticity is a\nstate-of-the-art constitutive model derived from data accumulated over many\ndecades. In contrast, GSH, a hydrodynamic theory, is derived from general\nprinciples of physics, with comparatively few inputs from experiments, yet\nsporting an applicability ranging from static stress distribution via\nelasto-plastic motion to fast dense flow, including non-uniform ones such as a\nshear band. Comparing both theories, we find great similarities for uniform,\nslow, elasto-plastic motion. We also find that proportional paths and the\nGoldscheider rule used to construct barodesy, another, more recent constitutive\nmodel, are natural results of GSH's equations. This is useful as it gives these\nconstitutive relations a solid foundation in physics, and in reverse, GSH a\nrobust connection to reality. The same symbiotic relation exists between GSH\nand KCR, or Kamrin's non-local constitutive relation, a model that was\nsuccessfully employed to account for a wide shear band in split bottom cells.\n", "  We show that charge ordering (more precisely, two-sublattice bond\ndisproportionation) in the rare earth nickelate perovskites is intimately\nrelated to a negative charge transfer energy. By adding an additional potential\non the Ni d states we are able to vary the charge tranfer energy and compute\nrelaxed structures within an ab-initio framework. We show that the difference\nin Ni-O bond lengths and the value of the ordered state magnetic moment\ncorrelate with the charge transfer energy and that the transition to the\nbond-disproportionated state occurs when the effective charge transfer energy\nbecomes negative.\n", "  We study a formulation of lattice gravity defined via Euclidean dynamical\ntriangulations (EDT). After fine-tuning a non-trivial local measure term we\nfind evidence that four-dimensional, semi-classical geometries are recovered at\nlong distance scales in the continuum limit. Furthermore, we find that the\nspectral dimension at short distance scales is consistent with 3/2, a value\nthat is also observed in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) approach to\nquantum gravity.\n", "  A new four-dimensional black hole solution of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Yang-Mills\ntheory is constructed, several degenerated forms of the black hole solution are\npresented. The related thermodynamical quantities are calculated, with which\nthe first law of thermodynamics is checked to be satisfied. Identifying the\ncosmological constant as pressure of the system, the phase transition behaviors\nof the black hole in the extended phase space are studied.\n", "  Recent developments in magnetic field sensing with negatively charged\nnitrogen-vacancy centers (NV) in diamond employ magnetic-field (MF) dependent\nfeatures in the photoluminescence (PL) and eliminate the need for microwaves\n(MW). Here, we study two approaches towards improving the magnetometric\nsensitivity using the ground-state level anti-crossing (GSLAC) feature of the\nNV center at a background MF of 102.4\\,mT. Following the first approach, we\ninvestigate the feature parameters for precise alignment in a dilute diamond\nsample; the second approach extends the sensing protocol into absorption via\ndetection of the GSLAC in the diamond transmission of a 1042\\,nm laser beam.\nThis leads to an increase of GSLAC contrast and results in a magnetometer with\na sensitivity of 0.45\\,nT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ and a photon shot-noise limited\nsensitivity of 12.2 pT/$\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}$.\n", "  All information about primary cosmic rays above the knee has been obtained\nfrom results of EAS investigations. At that, two alternative approaches exist:\ncosmophysical and nuclear physical. In the frame of the first one, all changes\nin measured EAS characteristics are explained by the changes in energy spectrum\nand mass composition of primary cosmic rays. In this paper, the second approach\nis considered, in frame of which corresponding changes in EAS parameters are\nexplained by changes of interaction model above the knee. Some experimental\npossibilities of proof of the correctness of the nuclear physical approach are\nconsidered.\n", "  Rate of single-photon generation by quantum emitters (QEs) can be enhanced by\nplacing a QE inside a resonant structure. This structure can represent an\nall-dielectric micro-resonator or waveguide and thus be characterized by\nultra-low loss and dimensions on the order of wavelength. Or it can be a metal\nnanostructure supporting localized or propagating surface plasmon-polariton\nmodes that are of subwavelength dimensions, but suffer from strong absorption.\nIn this work, we develop a physically transparent analytical model of\nsingle-photon emission in resonant structures and show unambiguously that,\nnotwithstanding the inherently high loss, the external emission rate can be\nenhanced with plasmonic nanostructures by two orders of magnitude compared to\nall-dielectric structures. Our analysis provides guidelines for developments of\nnew plasmonic configurations and materials to be exploited in quantum\nplasmonics.\n", "  Inspired by the theoretical prediction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3423 (2001)] and\nthe disputed experimental results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 189601(2002), Phys.\nRev. Lett. 90, 014302 (2003)], we systematically investigate the pattern of\nbinary mixtures consisting of same layer-thickness under vertical vibration.\nVarious kinds of mixtures with different diameters and densities particles are\nused to observe the separation regime. It is found that these mixtures behave\nlike five kinds of segregation patterns for different driving control\nparameters, i.e., Brazil nut (BN), reversed Brazil nut (RBN), Mixed states,\nlight-BN (LBN), and light-RBN (LRBN), where the latter two regimes are neither\npurely segregated nor completely mixed states. Not only that, but LBN (LRBN) is\nobserved to be the transition path from BN (RBN) to Mixed state. Moreover, BN\nphenomenon takes place in the area of low density ratio and found to be\nindependent of layer structure, while RBN is sensitive to the layer structure\nand occurs at the large density ratio but lower diameter ratio. Our result may\nbe helpful for the establishment of theory about the segregation and mixing of\ngranular mixtures.\n", "  Social networks contain implicit knowledge that can be used to infer\nhierarchical relations that are not explicitly present in the available data.\nInteraction patterns are typically affected by users' social relations. We\npresent an approach to inferring such information that applies a link-analysis\nranking algorithm at different levels of time granularity. In addition, a\nvoting scheme is employed for obtaining the hierarchical relations. The\napproach is evaluated on two datasets: the Enron email data set, where the goal\nis to infer manager-subordinate relationships, and the Co-author data set,\nwhere the goal is to infer PhD advisor-advisee relations. The experimental\nresults indicate that the proposed approach outperforms more traditional\napproaches to inferring hierarchical relations from social networks.\n", "  Lenses are crucial to light-enabled technologies. Conventional lenses have\nbeen perfected to achieve near-diffraction-limited resolution and minimal\nchromatic aberrations. However, such lenses are bulky and cannot focus light\ninto a hotspot smaller than half wavelength of light. Pupil filters, initially\nsuggested by Toraldo di Francia, can overcome the resolution constraints of\nconventional lenses, but are not intrinsically chromatically corrected. Here we\nreport single-element planar lenses that not only deliver sub-wavelength\nfocusing (beating the diffraction limit of conventional refractive lenses) but\nalso focus light of different colors into the same hotspot. Using the principle\nof super-oscillations we designed and fabricated a range of binary dielectric\nand metallic lenses for visible and infrared parts of the spectrum that are\nmanufactured on silicon wafers, silica substrates and optical fiber tips. Such\nlow cost, compact lenses could be useful in mobile devices, data storage,\nsurveillance, robotics, space applications, imaging, manufacturing with light,\nand spatially resolved nonlinear microscopies.\n", "  Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) is one of the most significant\nproblems in secure and optimal operation of modern electricity markets. New\nsources of uncertainties such as wind speed volatility and price-sensitive\nloads impose additional challenges to this large-scale problem. This paper\nproposes a new Stochastic SCUC using point estimation method to model the power\nsystem uncertainties more efficiently. Conventional scenario-based Stochastic\nSCUC approaches consider the Mont Carlo method; which presents additional\ncomputational burdens to this large-scale problem. In this paper we use point\nestimation instead of scenario generating to detract computational burdens of\nthe problem. The proposed approach is implemented on a six-bus system and on a\nmodified IEEE 118-bus system with 94 uncertain variables. The efficacy of\nproposed algorithm is confirmed, especially in the last case with notable\nreduction in computational burden without considerable loss of precision.\n", "  Data driven studies of heavy-ion results has played a big role in\nhighlighting interesting features of these complex systems. In this proceeding,\na simple QGP-brick interpretation of the $R_{\\rm AA}$ and $v_{2}$ at high\n$p_{\\rm T}$ ($p_{\\rm T} \\approx 10$ GeV/c) is presented. This interpretation\ndraws attention to two fundamental questions: is there an effect of the\nasymmetric QGP expansion on the $v_{2}$ at high $p_{\\rm T}$? is there an energy\nloss difference between quarks and gluons? Finally, it is discussed how these\nstudies can be extended using Event-Shape Engineering and how they can be\napplied to compare the energy loss of light and heavy quarks.\n", "  We analyze repulsively coupled Kuramoto oscillators, which are exposed to a\ndistribution of natural frequencies. This source of disorder leads to closed\norbits with a variety of different periods, which can be orders of magnitude\nlonger than periods of individual oscillators. By construction the attractor\nspace is quite rich. This may cause long transients until the deterministic\ntrajectories find their stationary orbits. The smaller the width of the\ndistribution about the common natural frequency is, the longer are the emerging\ntime scales on average. Among the long-period orbits we find self-similar\nsequences of temporary phase-locked motion on different time scales. The ratio\nof time scales is determined by the ratio of widths of the distributions.\n", "  Beginning with a decomposition of the Newtonian field of gravity, I show that\nfour classical color fields can be associated with the gravitational field. The\nmeaning of color here is that these fields do not add up to yield the Newtonian\ngravitational field, but the forces and potential energies associated with them\nadd up to yield the Newtonian force and potential energy, respectively. These\nfour color fields can have associated magnetic fields as in linearized gravity.\nThus we envisage a theory where four sets of Maxwellian equations would\nprevail. A quantum gravity theory with four spin 1 fields can thus be\nenvisaged.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the nature of scalar field potential in $f(R,\nR_{\\alpha\\beta} R^{\\alpha\\beta},\\phi)$ gravity using a well-motivated\nreconstruction scheme for flat FRW geometry. The beauty of this scheme lies in\nthe assumption that the Hubble parameter can be expressed in terms of scalar\nfield and vice versa. Firstly, we develop field equations in this gravity and\npresent some general explicit forms of scalar field potential via this\ntechnique. In the first case, we take De Sitter universe model and construct\nsome field potentials by taking different cases for coupling function. In the\nsecond case, we derive some field potentials using power law model in the\npresence of different matter sources like barotropic fluid, cosmological\nconstant and Chaplygin gas for some coupling functions. From graphical\nanalysis, it is concluded that using some specific values of the involved\nparameters, the reconstructed scalar field potentials are cosmologically viable\nin both cases.\n", "  This is the first in a two-part series in which we extend non-relativistic\nstochastic mechanics, in the ZSM formulation [1, 2], to semiclassical Newtonian\ngravity (ZSM-Newton) and semiclassical Newtonian electrodynamics (ZSM-Coulomb),\nunder the assumption that the gravitational and electromagnetic fields are\nfundamentally classical (i.e., not independently quantized fields). Our key\nfindings are: (1) a derivation of the usual $N$-particle Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation for many particles interacting through operator-valued gravitational\nor Coulomb potentials, and (2) recovery of the `single-body'\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger-Newton and Schr{\\\"o}dinger-Coulomb equations as mean-field\nequations valid for systems of gravitationally and electrostatically\ninteracting identical particles, respectively, in the weak-coupling large N\nlimit. We also compare ZSM-Newton/Coulomb to semiclassical Newtonian\ngravity/electrodynamics approaches based on standard quantum theory, dynamical\ncollapse theories, and the de Broglie-Bohm theory.\n", "  For the purpose of searching for Lorentz-invariance violation in the minimal\nStandard-Model Extension, we perfom a reanalysis of data obtained from the\n$^{133}\\text{Cs}$ fountain clock operating at SYRTE. The previous study led to\nnew limits on eight components of the $\\tilde{c}_{\\mu\\nu}$ tensor, which\nquantifies the anisotropy of the proton kinetic energy. We recently derived an\nadvanced model for the frequency shift of hyperfine Zeeman transition due to\nLorentz violation and became able to constrain the ninth component, the\nisotropic coefficient $\\tilde{c}_{TT}$, which is the least well-constrained\ncoefficient of $\\tilde{c}_{\\mu\\nu}$. This model is based on a second-order\nboost Lorentz transformation from the laboratory frame to the Sun-centered\nframe, and it gives rise to an improvement of five orders of magnitude on\n$\\tilde{c}_{TT}$ compared to the state of the art.\n", "  The 2016 Snook Prize has been awarded to Diego Tapias, Alessandro Bravetti,\nand David Sanders for their paper -- Ergodicity of One-Dimensional Systems\nCoupled to the Logistic Thermostat. They introduced a relatively stiff\nhyperbolic tangent thermostat force and successfully tested its ability to\nreproduce Gibbs' canonical distribution for the harmonic oscillator, the\nquartic oscillator, and the Mexican Hat potentials. Their work constitutes an\neffective response to the 2016 Ian Snook Prize Award goal -- Finding ergodic\nalgorithms for Gibbs' canonical ensemble using a single thermostat variable. We\nconfirm their work here and highlight an interesting feature of the Mexican Hat\nproblem when it is solved with an adaptive integrator.\n", "  We study turbulent natural convection in enclosures with conjugate heat\ntransfer. The simplest way to increase the heat transfer in this flow is\nthrough rough surfaces. In numerical simulations often the constant temperature\nis assigned at the walls in contact with the fluid, which is unrealistic in\nlaboratory experiments. The DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation), to be of help to\nexperimentalists, should consider the heat conduction in the solid walls\ntogether with the turbulent flow between the hot and the cold walls. Here the\ncold wall, $0.5h$ thick (where $h$ is the channel half-height) is smooth, and\nthe hot wall has two- and three-dimensional elements of thickness $0.2h$ above\na solid layer $0.3h$ thick. The independence of the results on the box size has\nbeen verified. A bi-periodic domain $4h$ wide allows to have a sufficient\nresolution with a limited number of grid points. It has been found that, among\nthe different kind of surfaces at a Rayleigh number $Ra \\approx 2 \\cdot 10^6$,\nthe one with staggered wedges has the highest heat transfer. A large number of\nsimulations varying the $Ra$ from $10^3$ to $10^7$ were performed to find the\ndifferent ranges of the Nusselt number ($Nu$) relationship as a function of\n$Ra$. Flow visualizations allow to explain the differences in the $Nu(Ra)$\nrelationship. Two values of the thermal conductivity were chosen, one\ncorresponding to copper and the other ten times higher. It has been found that\nthe Nusselt number behaves as $Nu=\\alpha Ra^\\gamma$, with $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$\nindependent on the solid conductivity, and dependent on the roughness shape.\n", "  Two short introductory lectures on Flavor Physics delivered at CLASHEP 2015.\nAmong included topics: The KM matrix and the KM model of CP-violation,\nDetermination of KM Elements, FCNC and GIM, New Physics and Flavor, Neutral\nMeson Mixing and CP Asymmetries. Many problems for the student, and solutions\nto selected problems, included.\n", "  Tight-binding models provide a conceptually transparent and computationally\nefficient method to represent the electronic properties of materials. With\nAFLOW$\\pi$ we introduce a framework for high-throughput first principles\ncalculations that automatically generates tight-binding hamiltonians without\nany additional input. Several additional features are included in AFLOW$\\pi$\nwith the intent to simplify the self-consistent calculation of Hubbard U\ncorrections, the calculations of phonon dispersions, elastic properties,\ncomplex dielectric constants, and electronic transport coefficients. As\nexamples we show how to compute the optical properties of layered nitrides in\nthe $AM$N$_2$ family, and the elastic and vibrational properties of binary\nhalides with CsCl and NaCl structure.\n", "  Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes record an enormous number of\ncosmic-ray background events. Suppressing these background events while\nretaining $\\gamma$-rays is key to achieving good sensitivity to faint\n$\\gamma$-ray sources. The differentiation between signal and background events\ncan be accomplished using machine learning algorithms, which are already used\nin various fields of physics. Multivariate analyses combine several variables\ninto a single variable that indicates the degree to which an event is\n$\\gamma$-ray-like or cosmic-ray-like. In this paper we will focus on the use of\nboosted decision trees for $\\gamma$/hadron separation. We apply the method to\ndata from the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System\n(VERITAS), and demonstrate an improved sensitivity compared to the VERITAS\nstandard analysis.\n", "  Active matter systems are able to exhibit emergent non-equilibrium states due\nto activity-induced effective interactions between the active particles. Here\nwe study the aggregation and dynamical behavior of active rotating particles,\nspinners, embedded in 2D passive colloidal monolayers, which constitutes one\nsuch non-equilibrium process. Using both experiments and simulations we observe\naggregation of active particles or spinners whose behavior resembles classical\n2D coarsening. The aggregation behavior and spinner attraction depends on the\nmechanical properties of the passive monolayer and the activity of spinners.\nSpinner aggregation only occurs when the passive monolayer behaves elastically\nand when the spinner activity exceeds a minimum activity threshold.\nInterestingly for the spinner concentrations investigated here, the spinner\nconcentration doesn't seem to change the dynamics of the aggregation behavior.\nThere is also a characteristic cluster size at which the dynamics of spinner\naggregation is maximized as drag through the passive monolayer is minimized and\nthe stress applied on the passive medium is maximized. We also show that a\nternary mixture of passive particles, co-rotating, and counter-rotating\nspinners also aggregates into clusters of co and counter-rotating spinners\nrespectively.\n", "  Gravity assist manoeuvres are one of the most succesful techniques in\nastrodynamics. In these trajectories the spacecraft comes very close to the\nsurface of the Earth, or other Solar system planets or moons, and, as a\nconsequence, it experiences the effect of atmospheric friction by the outer\nlayers of the Earth's atmosphere or ionosphere.\n  In this paper we analyze a standard atmospheric model to estimate the density\nprofile during the two Galileo flybys, the NEAR and the Juno flyby. We show\nthat, even allowing for a margin of uncertainty in the spacecraft cross-section\nand the drag coefficient, the observed -8 mm/sec anomalous velocity decrease\nduring the second Galileo flyby of December, 8th, 1992 cannot be attributed\nonly to atmospheric friction. On the other hand, for perigees on the border\nbetween the termosphere and the exosphere the friction only accounts for a\nfraction of a millimeter per second in the final asymptotic velocity.\n", "  We study the computation complexity of Boolean functions in the quantum black\nbox model. In this model our task is to compute a function\n$f:\\{0,1\\}\\to\\{0,1\\}$ on an input $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ that can be accessed by\nquerying the black box. Quantum algorithms are inherently probabilistic; we are\ninterested in the lowest possible probability that the algorithm outputs\nincorrect answer (the error probability) for a fixed number of queries. We show\nthat the lowest possible error probability for $AND_n$ and $EQUALITY_{n+1}$ is\n$1/2-n/(n^2+1)$.\n", "  Modern theories of galaxy formation predict that galaxies impact on their\ngaseous surroundings, playing the fundamental role of regulating the amount of\ngas converted into stars. While star-forming galaxies are believed to provide\nfeedback through galactic winds, Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs) are believed\ninstead to provide feedback through the heat generated by accretion onto a\ncentral supermassive black hole. A quantitative difference in the impact of\nfeedback on the gaseous environments of star-forming galaxies and QSOs has not\nbeen established through direct observations. Using the Sherwood cosmological\nsimulations, we demonstrate that measurements of neutral hydrogen in the\nvicinity of star-forming galaxies and QSOs during the era of peak galaxy\nformation show excess LyA absorption extending up to comoving radii of about\n150 kpc for star-forming galaxies and 300 - 700 kpc for QSOs. Simulations\nincluding supernovae-driven winds with the wind velocity scaling like the\nescape velocity of the halo account for the absorption around star-forming\ngalaxies but not QSOs.\n", "  In most applications of nanoporous materials the pore structure is as\nimportant as the chemical composition as a determinant of performance. For\nexample, one can alter performance in applications like carbon capture or\nmethane storage by orders of magnitude by only modifying the pore structure\n(1,2). For these applications it is therefore important to identify the optimal\npore geometry and use this information to find similar materials. However, the\nmathematical language and tools to identify materials with similar pore\nstructures, but different composition, has been lacking. Here we develop a pore\nrecognition approach to quantify similarity of pore structures and classify\nthem using topological data analysis (3,4). Our approach allows us to identify\nmaterials with similar pore geometries, and to screen for materials that are\nsimilar to given top-performing structures. Using methane storage as a case\nstudy, we also show that materials can be divided into topologically distinct\nclasses -- and that each class requires different optimization strategies. In\nthis work we have focused on pore space, but our topological approach can be\ngeneralised to quantify similarity of any geometric object, which, given the\nmany different Materials Genomics initiatives (5,6), opens many interesting\navenues for big-data science.\n", "  We leverage commutative hypercomplex analysis to find closed-form solutions\nof some systems of stochastic differential equations. Specifically, we obtain\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which a system of stochastic\ndifferential equations can be transformed into a scalar one involving processes\nvalued in a commutative hypercomplex. In the event the targeted scalar\nstochastic differential equation is solved by quadratures, we recover the\nsolution of the original system by projecting the solution of the scalar\nstochastic differential equation along the units of the underlying commutative\nhypercomplex. The conversion of a system of stochastic differential equations\ninvolving real-valued processes into a scalar one written in terms of\nhypercomplex-valued processes is termed hypercomplexification. Both\nhypercomplexification and its reverse are mediated by the analyticity of\nstochastic differential equations data. They may be iterated in order to\ngenerate higher-dimensional integrable systems of stochastic differential\nequations and solve them. We showcase the utility of hypercomplexification by\ntreating several examples including linear, and linearizable systems of\nstochastic differential equations and stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems.\nAlthough we consider only random systems driven by white noises,\nhypercomplexification is fundamentally algebraic, and it readily extends to\nstochastic systems involving other types of disturbances.\n", "  In deep supercooled liquids, particles get trapped in transient cages made up\nof neighbouring particles. Here we define a cage from a geometrical quantity,\nfree volume, such that the free volume of a particle is the cage volume. First\nwe show that the relationship between the average cage volume and the\nstructural relaxation time questions the existence of glass transition in hard\nsphere systems. Our observation suggests that the cage volume is zero at the\ntransition. Further we show that cage rearrangements are strongly coupled to\nthe single particle squared displacements. Additionally a cage can rearrange by\nlosing its neighbours with almost no change in particle displacements. The\npicture presented here also supports the complex scenarios of relaxation,\ndynamic heterogeneity and cooperative rearrangement.\n", "  The results of the molecular dynamics simulation of the radiation influence\non the structure and thermophysical properties of water are presented. The\nchanges in the radial distribution functions, momentum distribution function\nand the selfdiffusion coefficients are quantified. It is shown that the\nirradiation causes the changes in the structural and thermodynamic properties\nof water. The \"effective temperature\" of the stationary nonequilibrium water\nsystem under the irradiation allowing to define the correspondent equilibrium\nsystem with the same structural and thermodynamic properties is calculated. It\nis confirmed that the structural changes in the liquid systems under\nirradiation are caused by the changes in the coefficients of the Maxwell\ndistribution function due to the momentum exchange between the active particles\nand the particles forming the liquid. To explain the phenomena observed in the\nmolecular dynamics simulation the results are quantitatively compared to the\npredictions of the theoretical model of the phenomenon that is based on the\nBogolyubov chain of equations and with the experimental data.\n", "  We present two different approaches to model power grids as interconnected\nnetworks of networks. Both models are derived from a model for spatially\nembedded mono-layer networks and are generalised to handle an arbitrary number\nof network layers. The two approaches are distinguished by their use case. The\nstatic glue stick construction model yields a multi-layer network from a\npredefined layer interconnection scheme, i.e. different layers are attached\nwith transformer edges. It is especially suited to construct multi-layer power\ngrids with a specified number of nodes in and transformers between layers. We\ncontrast it with a genuine growth model which we label interconnected layer\ngrowth model.\n", "  We investigate symmetry reduction of optimal control problems for\nleft-invariant control systems on Lie groups, with partial symmetry breaking\ncost functions. Our approach emphasizes the role of variational principles and\nconsiders a discrete-time setting as well as the standard continuous-time\nformulation. Specifically, we recast the optimal control problem as a\nconstrained variational problem with a partial symmetry breaking Lagrangian and\nobtain the Euler--Poincar\\'e equations from a variational principle. By\napplying a Legendre transformation to it, we recover the Lie-Poisson equations\nobtained by A. D. Borum [Master's Thesis, University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign, 2015] in the same context. We also discretize the variational\nprinciple in time and obtain the discrete-time Lie-Poisson equations. We\nillustrate the theory with some practical examples including a motion planning\nproblem in the presence of an obstacle.\n", "  The NA48/2 and $\\text{NA62}\\text{-}{\\text{R}_\\text{K}}$ experiments at the\nCERN SPS collected a large sample of charged kaon decays in flight.\n$\\text{NA62}\\text{-}{\\text{R}_\\text{K}}$ was running in 2007-08 with a highly\nefficient minimum bias trigger for decays into electrons. A preliminary\nmeasurement of the electromagnetic transition form factor slope of the $\\pi^0$\nfrom $1.05\\times 10^{6}$ fully reconstructed $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decays is\npresented. The obtained value $a = (3.70 \\pm 0.53_\\text{stat} \\pm\n0.36_\\text{syst})\\times 10^{-2}$ represents a $5.8\\sigma$ observation of a\nnon-zero slope in the time-like region of momentum transfer. An upper limit on\nthe rate of a lepton number violating decay $K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\mp\\mu^\\pm\\mu^\\pm$ is\nreported from $\\sim 1.6\\times 10^{11} K^\\pm$ decays at NA48/2 in 2003-04:\n$\\mathcal{B} < 8.6\\times 10^{-11}$ at $90 \\%$ CL. Searches for heavy sterile\nneutrino $N_4$ and inflaton $\\chi$ resonances in $K^\\pm\\to\\pi\\mu\\mu$ decays are\nreported. No signal is observed and upper limits on the products\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^\\pm\\to\\mu^\\pm N_4)\\mathcal{B}(N_4\\to\\pi^\\mp\\mu^\\pm)$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^\\pm\\to\\pi^\\pm \\chi)\\mathcal{B}(\\chi\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)$ are set in\nthe range $10^{-10}-10^{-9}$ for resonance lifetimes up to $100~\\text{ps}$. The\nresult of a search for dark photon with the same sample of decays is also\nreported. In the absence of observed signal, the limits on the mixing parameter\n$\\varepsilon^2$ in the range $9-70~\\text{MeV/c}^{2}$ are improved.\n", "  We use an extensive NOAA database of hourly precipitation data from 5995\nstations in the 48 contiguous United States over the period 1949--2009 to\ninvestigate possible trends in the frequency and severity of extreme weather\nevents, defined as periods of intense precipitation. The frequency and\nintensity of these events are quantified by a dimensionless storminess, defined\nas the variance of the hourly rainfall at a site normalized by the square of\nthe mean rainfall at that site. For 1722 stations with sufficient data, we\ncompute the rate of change of the logarithm of the storminess at each station\nand set bounds on its mean (over stations) trend; use of the logarithms weights\ntrends at calm stations equally to those at stormy stations and enhances the\nstatistical power of the mean. These results are confirmed by reversing the\norder of averaging: first computing, for each year, the mean (over stations)\nlogarithm of the storminess, and then fitting to its trend. We set $2\\sigma$\nupper bounds of 0.001/y (doubling or halving time scales $> 1000$ y) on any\ntrend, increasing or decreasing.\n", "  We study the effect of local strain in the electronic transport properties of\nvertical metal-atomically thin MoS2-metal structures. We use a conductive\natomic force microscope tip to apply different load forces to monolayer and\nfew-layer MoS2 crystals deposited onto a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO)\nsubstrate while measuring simultaneously the I-V characteristics of the\nvertical tip/MoS2/ITO structures. The structures show rectifying I-V\ncharacteristics, with rectification ratios strongly dependent on the applied\nload. To understand these results, we compare the experimental I-Vs with a\ndouble Schottky barrier model, which is in good agreement with our experimental\nresults and allows us to extract quantitative information about the electronic\nproperties of the tip/MoS2/ITO structures and their dependence on the applied\nload. Finally, we test the stability of the studied structures using them as\nmechanically tunable current rectifiers.\n", "  The generation of a magnetic field in the Early Universe is considered, due\nto the gravitational production of the Z-boson field during inflation. Scaled\nto the epoch of galaxy formation this magnetic field suffices to trigger the\ngalactic dynamo and explain the observed galactic magnetic fields. The\nmechanism is independent of the inflationary model.\n", "  We investigate the effects of negative pressure induced by dark energy\n(cosmological constant or quintessence) on the dynamics at various\nastrophysical scales. Negative pressure induces a repulsive term (antigravity)\nin Newton's law which dominates on large scales. Assuming a value of the\ncosmological constant consistent with the recent SnIa data we determine the\ncritical scale $r_c$ beyond which antigravity dominates the dynamics ($r_c \\sim\n1Mpc $) and discuss some of the dynamical effects implied. We show that\ndynamically induced mass estimates on the scale of the Local Group and beyond\nare significantly modified due to negative pressure. We also briefly discuss\npossible dynamical tests (eg effects on local Hubble flow) that can be applied\non relatively small scales (a few $Mpc$) to determine the density and equation\nof state of dark energy.\n", "  We attempt to put constraints on different cosmological and biasing models by\ncombining the recent clustering results of X-ray sources in the local ($z\\le\n0.1$) and distant universe ($z\\sim 1$).\n", "  In this paper we review the present status and implications of H-alpha\nsurveys at various redshifts. With the advent of sensitive wide-format\nnear-infrared detectors on large telescopes, deep and extensive H-alpha surveys\nare now feasible to redshift z~2.5. The cosmic star formation history can\ntherefore be traced out to this redshift using H-alpha alone, avoiding\ncomplications arising from the comparison of different tracers at different\nredshifts. The H-alpha surveys to date confirm the rapid increase in luminosity\ndensity from z=0 out to z=1, and show that this increase flattens off at higher\nredshifts, remaining approximately constant out to at least z~2.2. We also\ndiscuss the prospects for determining the masses of high redshift galaxies\nbased on emission lines. A set of high-quality H-alpha rotation curves of\nsamples of disk galaxies at a number of different redshifts would allow a study\nof the evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation and address fundamental issues in\ndisk galaxy formation. Such a program remains challenging even with present-day\nlarge telescopes.\n", "  Using the APM cluster distribution we find interesting alignment effects: (1)\nCluster substructure is strongly correlated with the tendency of clusters to be\naligned with their nearest neighbour and in general with the nearby clusters\nthat belong to the same supercluster, (2) Clusters belonging in superclusters\nshow a statistical significant tendency to be aligned with the major axis\norientation of their parent supercluster. Furthermore we find that dynamically\nyoung clusters are more clustered than the overall cluster population. These\nare strong indications that cluster develop in a hierarchical fashion by\nmerging along the large-scale filamentary superclusters within which they are\nembedded.\n", "  Interstellar magnetic fields are strong: up to 25 muG in spiral arms and 40\nmuG in nuclear regions. In the spiral galaxy NGC 6946 the average magnetic\nenergy density exceeds that of the thermal gas. Magnetic fields control the\nevolution of dense clouds and possibly the global star formation efficiency in\ngalaxies. Gas flows and shocks in spiral arms and bars are modified by magnetic\nfields. Magnetic forces in star-forming circumnuclear regions are able to drive\nmass inflow towards the active nucleus. Magnetic fields are essential for the\npropagation of cosmic rays and the formation of galactic winds and halos.\n", "  We have obtained near-infrared spectra of L dwarfs, L/T transition objects\nand T dwarfs using Subaru. Resulting spectra are examined in detail to see\ntheir dependence on the spectral types. We have obtained bolometric\nluminosities of the objects with known parallaxes in our sample, first by\nintegrating the spectra and second by K band bolometric correction. We derive\nthe relation between effective temperature and spectral type.\n", "  We discuss how the vector nature of magnetic fields, and the geometrical\ninterpretation of gravity introduced by general relativity, lead to a special\ncoupling between magnetism and spacetime curvature. This magneto-geometrical\ninteraction effectively transfers the tension properties of the field into the\nspacetime fabric, triggering a variety of effects with potentially far-reaching\nimplications.\n", "  We study the perfect monopole action as an infrared effective theory of SU(2)\nQCD. It is transformed exactly into a lattice string model. Since the monopole\ninteractions are weak in the infrared SU(2) QCD, the string interactions become\nstrong. The strong coupling expansion of string model shows the quantum\nfluctuation is small. The classical string tension is estimated analytically,\nand we see it is very close to the quantum one in the SU(2) QCD. We also\ndiscuss how to calculate the glueball mass in our model.\n", "  We calculate one-loop scattering amplitudes for gravitons and two-forms in\ndimensions greater than four. The string based Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relationships\nallow gravitons and two-forms to be treated in a unified manner. We use the\nresults to determine the ultra-violet infinities present in these amplitudes\nand show how these determine the renormalised one-loop action in six and eight\ndimensions.\n", "  We have developed a matrix model for FQH states at filling factor\n\\nu_{k_1k_2} going beyond the Laughlin theory. To illustrate our idea, we have\nconsidered an FQH system of a finite number N=(N_{1}+N_{2}) of electrons with\nfilling factor \\nu_{k_{1}k_{2}} = \\nu_{p_{1}p_{2}}=\\frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}p_{2}-1};\np_{1} is an odd integer and p_{2} is an even integer. The \\nu_{p_{1}p_{2}}\nseries corresponds just to the level two of the Haldane hierarchy; it recovers\nthe Laughlin series \\nu_{p_{1}} =\\frac{1}{p_{1}} by going to the limit p_{2}\nlarge and contains several observable FQH states such as \\nu = 2/3, 2/5, >....\n", "  Trigonometric degeneration of the Baxter-Belavin elliptic r matrix is\ndescribed by the degeneration of the twisted WZW model on elliptic curves. The\nspaces of conformal blocks and conformal coinvariants of the degenerate model\nare factorised into those of the orbifold WZW model.\n", "  We have considered SU(2)xU(1) gauge field theory describing electroweak\ninteractions. We have demonstrated that centrifugal term in model Hamiltonian\nincreases the region of regular dynamics of Yang-Mills and Higgs fields system\nat low densities of energy. Also we have found analytically the approximate\nrelation for critical density of energy of the order to chaos transition on\ncentrifugal constant. It is necessary to note that mentioned increase of the\nregion of regular dynamics has linear dependance on the value of the\ncentrifugal constant.\n", "  The current generation of covariant mean-field models has had many successes\nin calculations of bulk observables for medium to heavy nuclei, but there\nremain many open questions. New challenges are confronted when trying to\nsystematically extend these models to reliably address nuclear structure\nphysics away from the line of stability. In this lecture, we discuss a\nframework for the next generation of relativistic models that can address these\nquestions and challenges. We interpret nuclear mean-field approaches as\napproximate implementations of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), which\nis widely used in condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications. We look\nto effective field theory (EFT) for a systematic approach to low-energy nuclear\nphysics that can provide the framework for nuclear DFT.\n", "  Recent progress in Lorentz-covariant quantum field theories of the nuclear\nmany-body problem (quantum hadrodynamics or QHD) is discussed. The effective\nfield theory studied here contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar (\\sigma)\nand vector (\\omega) fields, and isovector vector (\\rho) fields. The theory\nexhibits a nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R\nchiral symmetry and has three desirable features: it uses the same degrees of\nfreedom to describe the nuclear currents and the strong-interaction dynamics,\nit satisfies the symmetries of the underlying theory of QCD, and its parameters\ncan be calibrated using strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron scattering or\nthe empirical properties of finite nuclei. Moreover, it has recently been\nverified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to expand the\neffective Lagrangian systematically in powers of the meson fields (and their\nderivatives) and to truncate the expansion reliably after the first few orders.\nUsing a mean-field version of the energy functional, accurate quantitative\nresults are obtained for the bulk and single-particle properties of medium- and\nheavy-mass nuclei. The importance of modern perspectives in effective field\ntheory and density functional theory for understanding these successes of QHD\nis emphasized. The inclusion of hadronic electromagnetic structure and of\nnonanalytic terms in the energy functional is also considered briefly. As a\nfurther application, weak-interaction currents are studied in the QHD\nframework. The axial-vector current, evaluated through the leading order in the\nfield expansion, satisfies both PCAC and the Goldberger--Treiman relation, and\nthe corresponding vector and axial-vector charges satisfy the familiar chiral\ncharge algebra to all orders in the pion field.\n", "  An overview on the relativistic Dirac-Brueckner approach to the nuclear\nmany-body problem is given. Different approximation schemes are discussed, with\nparticular emphasis on the nuclear self-energy and the saturation mechanism of\nnuclear matter. I will further discuss extensions of the standard approach,\namongst other things the inclusion of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom,\nmany-body forces and finally compare relativistic and non-relativistic\napproaches.\n", "  The degrees of freedom associated with shape fluctuations and space\norientation of atomic nuclei are analyzed with effective forces and large\nconfiguration spaces. A pedagogical theoretical introduction to the topic of\nsymmetries restoration broken in the mean field approach as well as to the\nconcept of generator coordinate is presented. We discuss global properties,\nlike binding energies, two neutron separation energies and quadrupole moments,\nas well as spectroscopic ones like excitation energies or transition\nprobabilities. The analysis covers selected examples of light and heavy nuclei,\nas well as some examples from the stability line to the drip lines.\n", "  These lecture notes address a central problem of theoretical nuclear physics:\nhow to establish a relationship between low-energy, non-perturbative QCD and\nnuclear phenomenology which includes both nuclear matter and finite nuclei. We\ndevelop a microscopic covariant description of nuclear many-body dynamics\nconstrained by chiral symmetry and in-medium QCD sum rules. A relativistic\npoint-coupling model is derived, based on an effective Lagrangian with\ndensity-dependent contact interactions between nucleons. These interactions are\nconstructed from chiral one- and two-pion exchange, combined with the large\nisoscalar nucleon self-energies that arise through changes in the quark\ncondensate and the quark density at finite baryon density. Nuclear binding and\nsaturation are almost completely generated by chiral (two-pion exchange)\nfluctuations in combination with Pauli effects, whereas strong scalar and\nvector fields of about equal magnitude and opposite sign, induced by changes of\nthe QCD vacuum in the presence of baryonic matter, generate the large effective\nspin-orbit potential in finite nuclei. Promising results are found for the\nnuclear matter equation of state and for the bulk and single-nucleon properties\nof finite nuclei.\n"]}
