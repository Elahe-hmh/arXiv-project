Progress in characteristic\nevolution is traced from the early stage of 1D feasibility studies to 2D\naxisymmetric codes that accurately simulate the oscillations and gravitational\ncollapse of relativistic stars and to current 3D codes that provide pieces of a\nbinary black hole spacetime. Cauchy codes have now been successful at\nsimulating all aspects of the binary black hole problem inside an artificially\nconstructed outer boundary. A prime application of characteristic evolution is\nto extend such simulations to null infinity where the waveform from the binary\ninspiral and merger can be unambiguously computed. This has now been\naccomplished by Cauchy-characteristic extraction, where data for the\ncharacteristic evolution is supplied by Cauchy data on an extraction worldtube\ninside the artificial outer boundary. The ultimate application of\ncharacteristic evolution is to eliminate the role of this outer boundary by\nconstructing a global solution via Cauchy-characteristic matching. Progress in\nthis direction is discussed.\n", "  [Abridged] Due to their large distances, high-z galaxies are observed at a\nvery low spatial resolution. In order to disentangle the evolution of galaxy\nkinematics from low resolution effects, we have used Fabry-Perot 3D Ha\ndata-cubes of 153 nearby isolated galaxies from the GHASP survey to simulate\ndata-cubes of galaxies at z=1.7. We show that the inner velocity gradient is\nlowered and is responsible for a peak in the velocity dispersion map.\nToy-models of rotating disks have been built to recover the parameters from low\nresolution data. The poor resolution makes the kinematical inclination\nuncertain and the center difficult to recover. The major axis is retrieved with\nan accuracy higher than 5deg for 70% of the sample. Toy-models also enable to\nretrieve statistically the maximum velocity and the mean velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies with a satisfying accuracy. This validates the use of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for high-z galaxies but the loss of resolution induces a lower slope\nat high-z. We conclude that the main kinematic parameters are better\nconstrained for galaxies with an optical radius larger than three times the\nseeing. The simulated data have been compared to actual high-z galaxies data in\nthe redshift range 3>z>0.4. For rotation-dominated galaxies, we find that the\nuse of the velocity dispersion central peak as a signature of rotating disks\nmay misclassify slow and solid body rotators (~30% of our sample). We show that\nthe projected data cannot reproduce the high velocity dispersion observed in\nhigh-z galaxies except when no beam smearing correction is applied. This\nunambiguously means that, at the opposite of local evolved galaxies, there\nexists at high redshift at least a population of disk galaxies for which a\nlarge fraction of the dynamical support is due to random motions.\n", "  We discuss a self-consistent solution for a fermion coupled to static scalar\nfield in the form of a kink (domain wall). In particular, we study the case\nwhen the fermion occupies an excited non-zero frequency level in the presence\nof the domain wall field. The effect of the domain wall profile distortion is\ncalculated analytically.\n", "  We construct loop operators in two dimensional Toda CFT and calculate with\nthem the exact expectation value of certain supersymmetric 't Hooft and dyonic\nloop operators in four dimensional \\Ncal=2 gauge theories with SU(N) gauge\ngroup. Explicit formulae for 't Hooft and dyonic operators in \\Ncal=2^* and\n\\Ncal=2 conformal SQCD with SU(N) gauge group are presented. We also briefly\nspeculate on the Toda CFT realization of arbitrary loop operators in these\ngauge theories in terms of topological web operators in Toda CFT.\n", "  We discuss the case when a fermion occupies an excited non-zero frequency\nlevel in the field of domain wall. We demonstrate that a solution exists for\nthe coupling constant in the limited interval $1<g<g_{max}\\approx 1.65$. We\nshow that indeed there are different branches of stable solution for $g$ in\nthis interval. The first one corresponds to a fermion located on the domain\nwall ($1<g<\\sqrt[4]{2\\pi}$). The second branch, which belongs to the interval\n$\\sqrt[4]{2\\pi}\\le g\\le g_{max}$, describes a polarized fermion off the domain\nwall. The third branch with $1<g<g_{max}$ describes an excited antifermion in\nthe field of the domain wall.\n", "  We present an analysis of the stellar kinematics of the Large Magellanic\nCloud based on ~5900 new and existing velocities of massive red supergiants,\noxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and other giants. After correcting the\nline-of-sight velocities for the LMC's space motion and accounting for\nasymmetric drift in the AGB population, we derive a rotation curve that is\nconsistent with all of the tracers used, as well as that of published HI data.\nThe amplitude of the rotation curve is v_0=87+/-5 km s^-1 beyond a radius\nR_0=2.4+/-0.1 kpc, and has a position angle of the kinematic line of nodes of\ntheta=142 degrees +/-5 degrees. By examining the outliers from our fits, we\nidentify a population of 376 stars, or >~5% of our sample, that have\nline-of-sight velocities that apparently oppose the sense of rotation of the\nLMC disk. We find that these kinematically distinct stars are either\ncounter-rotating in a plane closely aligned with the LMC disk, or rotating in\nthe same sense as the LMC disk, but in a plane that is inclined by 54 degrees\n+/- 2 degrees to the LMC. Their kinematics clearly link them to two known HI\narms, which have previously been interpreted as being pulled out from the LMC.\nWe measure metallicities from the Ca triplet lines of ~1000 LMC field stars and\n30 stars in the kinematically distinct population. For the LMC field, we find a\nmedian [Fe/H]=-0.56 +/- 0.02 with dispersion of 0.5 dex, while for the\nkinematically distinct stars the median [Fe/H] is -1.25 +/- 0.13 with a\ndispersion of 0.7 dex. The metallicity differences provide strong evidence that\nthe kinematically distinct population originated in the SMC. This\ninterpretation has the consequence that the HI arms kinematically associated\nwith the stars are likely falling into the LMC, instead of being pulled out.\n", "  We compute exactly the partition function of two dimensional N=(2,2) gauge\ntheories on S^2 and show that it admits two dual descriptions: either as an\nintegral over the Coulomb branch or as a sum over vortex and anti-vortex\nexcitations on the Higgs branches of the theory. We further demonstrate that\ncorrelation functions in two dimensional Liouville/Toda CFT compute the S^2\npartition function for a class of N=(2,2) gauge theories, thereby uncovering\nnovel modular properties in two dimensional gauge theories. Some of these gauge\ntheories flow in the infrared to Calabi-Yau sigma models - such as the conifold\n- and the topology changing flop transition is realized as crossing symmetry in\nLiouville/Toda CFT. Evidence for Seiberg duality in two dimensions is exhibited\nby demonstrating that the partition function of conjectured Seiberg dual pairs\nare the same.\n", "  Direct detection experiments, which are designed to detect the scattering of\ndark matter off nuclei in detectors, are a critical component in the search for\nthe Universe's missing matter. The count rate in these experiments should\nexperience an annual modulation due to the relative motion of the Earth around\nthe Sun. This modulation, not present for most known background sources, is\ncritical for solidifying the origin of a potential signal as dark matter. In\nthis article, we review the physics of annual modulation, discussing the\npractical formulae needed to interpret a modulating signal. We focus on how the\nmodulation spectrum changes depending on the particle and astrophysics models\nfor the dark matter. For standard assumptions, the count rate has a cosine\ndependence with time, with a maximum in June and a minimum in December.\nWell-motivated generalizations of these models, however, can affect both the\nphase and amplitude of the modulation. We show how a measurement of an annually\nmodulating signal could teach us about the presence of substructure in the\nGalactic halo or about the interactions between dark and baryonic matter.\nAlthough primarily a theoretical review, we briefly discuss the current\nexperimental situation for annual modulation and future experimental\ndirections.\n", "  Circumbinary planetary systems recently discovered by Kepler represent an\nimportant testbed for planet formation theories. Planetesimal growth in disks\naround binaries has been expected to be inhibited interior to ~10 AU by secular\nexcitation of high relative velocities between planetesimals, leading to their\ncollisional destruction (rather than agglomeration). Here we show that gravity\nof the gaseous circumbinary disk in which planets form drives fast precession\nof both the planetesimal and binary orbits, resulting in strong suppression of\nplanetesimal eccentricities beyond 2-3 AU and making possible growth of 1-100\nkm objects in this region. The precise location of the boundary of\naccretion-friendly region depends on the size of the inner disk cavity cleared\nby the binary torques and on the disk mass (even 0.01 M_Sun disk strongly\nsuppresses planetesimal excitation), among other things. Precession of the\norbit of the central binary, enhanced by the mass concentration naturally\npresent at the inner edge of a circumbinary disk, plays key role in this\nsuppression, which is a feature specific to the circumbinary planet formation.\n", "  Energy of a black hole is usually quantized by invoking some area\nquantization scheme after expressing the energy in terms of the horizon area.\nHowever, in this approach one has to quantize the local and asymptotic energy\nof the black hole separately and the two results do not manifest any physical\ncorrespondence with each other. Here, as opposed to this practice, we find the\nunique energy spectrum of black holes by adopting a top-down approach. The\nphysical links among the underlying quantum theory, statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics of the black hole horizon play the central role in determining\nthe energy spectrum. The energy spectrum that we obtain, explicitly reveals the\ncorrespondence between asymptotic and local observations through the presence\nof the surface gravity of the horizon as a parameter in the spectrum, rather\nthan being expressed as a function of area and consequently getting quantized\nin the usual approach. Thus, our result presents a new view as far as black\nhole energy quantization is concerned. The calculations are performed using the\nquantum geometric description of black hole horizons as laid down by loop\nquantum gravity.\n", "  The general boundary formulation of quantum field theory is applied to a\nmassive scalar field in two dimensional Rindler space. The field is quantized\naccording to both the Schr\\\"odinger-Feynman quantization prescription and the\nholomorphic one in two different spacetime regions: a region bounded by two\nCauchy surfaces and a region bounded by one timelike curve. An isomorphism is\nconstructed between the Hilbert spaces associated with these two boundaries.\nThis isomorphism preserves the probabilities that can be extracted from the\nfree and the interacting quantum field theories, proving the equivalence of the\nS-matrices defined in the two settings, when both apply.\n", "  Flavor violating Higgs signals, such as the top FCNC decay $t\\to ch^0$ and\nthe LFV Higgs decay $h^0\\to \\tau\\mu$, have been studied at the LHC. These\nsignals can arise within the general Two-Higgs doublet model (THDM), where each\nHiggs doublet couples to all fermions types through Yukawa matrices $Y^f_1$ and\n$Y^f_2$. The Yukawa matrices can be assumed to have the same form or they could\nhave different structures. In this paper we study the case when both $Y^f_1$\nand $Y^f_2$ have completely different forms, but in such a way that they\ncomplement to produce a specific hermitian mass matrix. We find that for\nspecific four-zero textures, the Flavor Violating Higgs couplings depend only\non the free parameters $\\tan \\beta$, $\\gamma_f$ and the fermion masses. We use\nthe current bounds on the low energy processes, to derive constraints on the\nHeavy Higgs boson mass, $\\tan \\beta$ and $\\gamma_f$. Then, we use these\nconstraints to evaluate the LFV Higgs decays, which reach Branching ratios that\ncould be tested at the LHC.\n", "  Via a Bayesian likelihood analysis using 219 recent cosmic ray spectral data\npoints we extract the anomalous part of the cosmic $e^\\pm$ flux. First we show\nthat a significant tension exists between the $e^\\pm$ related and the rest of\nthe fluxes. Interpreting this tension as the presence of an anomalous component\nin the $e^\\pm$ related data, we then infer the values of selected cosmic ray\npropagation parameters excluding the anomalous data sample from the analysis.\nBased on these values we calculate background predictions with theoretical\nuncertainties for PAMELA and Fermi-LAT. We find a statistically significant\ndeviation between the Fermi-LAT $e^-+e^+$ data and the predicted background\neven when (systematic) uncertainties are taken into account. Identifying this\ndeviation as an anomalous $e^\\pm$ contribution, we make an attempt to\ndistinguish between various sources that may be responsible for the anomalous\n$e^\\pm$ flux.\n", "  We report fast computation of computer-generated holograms (CGHs) using Xeon\nPhi coprocessors, which have massively x86-based processors on one chip,\nrecently released by Intel. CGHs can generate arbitrary light wavefronts, and\ntherefore, are promising technology for many applications: for example,\nthree-dimensional displays, diffractive optical elements, and the generation of\narbitrary beams. CGHs incur enormous computational cost. In this paper, we\ndescribe the implementations of several CGH generating algorithms on the Xeon\nPhi, and the comparisons in terms of the performance and the ease of\nprogramming between the Xeon Phi, a CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU).\n", "  A recent proof-of-principle study proposes a nonlinear electrostatic implicit\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm in one dimension (Chen, Chacon, Barnes, J.\nComput. Phys. 230 (2011) 7018). The algorithm employs a kinetically enslaved\nJacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method, and conserves energy and charge to\nnumerical round-off. In this study, we generalize the method to electromagnetic\nsimulations in 1D using the Darwin approximation of Maxwell's equations, which\navoids radiative aliasing noise issues by ordering out the light wave. An\nimplicit, orbit-averaged time-space-centered finite difference scheme is\napplied to both the 1D Darwin field equations (in potential form) and the 1D-3V\nparticle orbit equations to produce a discrete system that remains exactly\ncharge- and energy-conserving. Furthermore, enabled by the implicit Darwin\nequations, exact conservation of the canonical momentum per particle in any\nignorable direction is enforced via a suitable scattering rule for the magnetic\nfield. Several 1D numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and the\nconservation properties of the algorithm.\n", "  In this work, we present three groups of microcavities: based on selenium\ncompounds only, based on tellurium compounds only, and structures based on\nmixed selenium and tellurium compounds. We focus on their possible applications\nin the field of optoelectronic devices and fundamental physics (VCSELs, narrow\nrange light sources, studies of cavity-polariton electrodynamics) in a range of\nwavelength from 540 to 760 nm.\n", "  The metallicity of exoplanet systems serves as a critical diagnostic of\nplanet formation mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated the\nplanet-metallicity correlation for large planets ($R_P\\ \\geq\\ 4\\ R_E$);\nhowever, a correlation has not been found for smaller planets. With a sample of\n406 $Kepler$ Objects of Interest whose stellar properties are determined\nspectroscopically, we reveal a universal planet-metallicity correlation: not\nonly gas-giant planets ($3.9\\ R_E\\ < R_P\\ \\leq\\ 22.0\\ R_E$) but also gas-dwarf\n($1.7\\ R_E\\ < R_P\\ \\leq\\ 3.9\\ R_E$) and terrestrial planets ($R_P\\ \\leq\\ 1.7\\\nR_E$) occur more frequently in metal-rich stars. The planet occurrence rates of\ngas-giant planets, gas-dwarf planets, and terrestrial planets are\n$9.30^{+5.62}_{-3.04}$, $2.03^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, and $1.72^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$\ntimes higher for metal-rich stars than for metal-poor stars, respectively.\n", "  A new data format for Monte Carlo (MC) events, or any structural data,\nincluding experimental data, is discussed. The format is designed to store data\nin a compact binary form using variable-size integer encoding as implemented in\nthe Google's Protocol Buffers package. This approach is implemented in the\nProMC library which produces smaller file sizes for MC records compared to the\nexisting input-output libraries used in high-energy physics (HEP). Other\nimportant features of the proposed format are a separation of abstract data\nlayouts from concrete programming implementations, self-description and random\naccess. Data stored in ProMC files can be written, read and manipulated in a\nnumber of programming languages, such C++, JAVA, FORTRAN and PYTHON.\n", "  We study profiles of mass density, velocity dispersion (VD), and their\ncombination using $\\sim 2000$ nearly spherical and rotation-free SDSS galaxies.\nFor observational stellar mass density $\\rho_{\\star}(r)$ we consider a range of\ndark matter (DM) distribution $\\rho_{\\rm{DM}}(r)$ and VD anisotropy $\\beta(r)$\nto investigate radial stellar VD $\\sigma_{\\rm\\star r}(r)$ using the spherical\nJeans equation. While mass and VD profiles vary appreciably depending on DM\ndistribution and anisotropy, the pseudo-phase-space density-like combination\n$\\rho(r)/\\sigma_{\\rm\\star r}^3(r)$ with total density $\\rho(r)=\n\\rho_{\\star}(r)+\\rho_{\\rm{DM}}(r)$ is nearly universal. In the optical region\nthe minus of its logarithmic slope has a mean value of\n$\\langle\\chi\\rangle\\approx 1.86$--$1.90$ with a galaxy-to-galaxy rms scatter of\n$\\approx 0.04$--$0.06$, which is a few times smaller than that of $\\rho(r)$\nprofiles. The scatter of $\\chi$ can be increased by invoking wildly varying\nanisotropies that are, however, less likely because they would produce too\nlarge a scatter of line-of-sight VD profiles. As an independent check of this\nuniversality we analyze stellar orbit-based dynamical models of 15 ETGs of Coma\ncluster provided by J. Thomas. Coma ETGs, with $\\sigma_{\\star\\rm{r}}(r)$\nreplaced by the rms velocity of stars $v_{\\star\\rm{rms}}(r)$ including net\nrotation, exhibit a similar universality with a slope of $\\chi= 1.93\\pm 0.06$.\nRemarkably, the inferred values of $\\chi$ for ETGs match well the slope\n$\\approx 1.9$ predicted by N-body simulations of DM halos. We argue that the\ninferred universal nature of $\\rho(r)/\\sigma_{\\rm\\star r}^3(r)$ cannot be fully\nexplained by equilibrium alone, implying that some astrophysical factors\nconspire and/or it reflects a fundamental principle in collisionless formation\nprocesses.\n", "  We present photometry in U, B, V, R and I continuum bands and in H$\\alpha$\nand H$\\beta$ emission lines for a sample of 336 circumnuclear star forming\nregions (CNSFR) located in early type spiral galaxies with different levels of\nactivity in their nuclei. They are nearby galaxies, with distances less than\n100 Mpc, 60\\% of which are considered as interacting objects.\n  This survey of 20 nuclear rings aims to provide insight into their star\nformation properties as age, stellar population and star formation rate.\nExtinction corrected H$\\alpha$ luminosities range from $1.3\\times 10^{38}$ to\n$4\\times 10^{41} erg s^{-1}$, with most of the regions showing values between\n39.5 $\\leq log L(H\\alpha) \\leq$ 40, which implies masses for the ionizing\nclusters higher than $2\\times 10^{5} M_\\odot $.\n  H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ images have allowed us to obtain an accurate measure\nof extinction. We have found an average value of A$_V$ = 1.85 magnitudes. (U-B)\ncolour follows a two maximum distribution around (U-B)$ \\simeq$ -0.7, and -0.3;\n(R-I) also presents a bimodal behaviour, with maximum values of 0.6 and 0.9.\nReddest (U-B) and (R-I) regions appear in non-interacting galaxies. Reddest\n(R-I) regions lie in strongly barred galaxies.\n  For a significant number of HII regions the observed colours and equivalent\nwidths are not well reproduced by single burst evolutionary theoretical models.\n", "  Among the large class of Heusler compounds, Co2CrAl is predicted to be 100 %\nspin polarized and is hence, a potential candidate for application in\nspintronics. So far, the predicted properties have not been experimentally\nrealized which may be attributed to the phase segregated nature of samples.\nThis phase segregation is avoided using floating zone growth. However, the\ngrown sample was found to have undergone phase transformation via spinodal\ndecomposition at low temperatures. In the present work, thermal annealing has\nbeen done on the spinodally decomposed samples and its effect on\nmicrostructure, crystallographic structure and magnetic properties has been\nstudied. Annealing experiments were done and analyzed in order to understand\nthe extent of the solid state miscibility gap. With regards to the phase\ndiagram, the two-phase regime was found to extend till 1000 {\\deg}C. Even at\n1250 {\\deg}C, we are still inside the immiscibility region. The thermodynamic\nmiscibility gap was thus found to exist until high temperatures and alternate\nroutes might be required to obtain a single phase sample with the desired high\nspin polarization and Curie temperature in the Co-Cr-Al system.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model play an important role in the\nfield of computational statistical physics, and they have revealed many\nproperties of the model over the past few decades. However, the effect of\nfrustration due to random disorder, in particular the possible spin glass\nphase, remains a crucial but poorly understood problem. One of the obstacles in\nthe Monte Carlo simulation of random frustrated systems is their long\nrelaxation time making an efficient parallel implementation on state-of-the-art\ncomputation platforms highly desirable. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is\nsuch a platform that provides an opportunity to significantly enhance the\ncomputational performance and thus gain new insight into this problem. In this\npaper, we present optimization and tuning approaches for the CUDA\nimplementation of the spin glass simulation on GPUs. We discuss the integration\nof various design alternatives, such as GPU kernel construction with minimal\ncommunication, memory tiling, and look-up tables. We present a binary data\nformat, Compact Asynchronous Multispin Coding (CAMSC), which provides an\nadditional $28.4\\%$ speedup compared with the traditionally used Asynchronous\nMultispin Coding (AMSC). Our overall design sustains a performance of 33.5\npicoseconds per spin flip attempt for simulating the three-dimensional\nEdwards-Anderson model with parallel tempering, which significantly improves\nthe performance over existing GPU implementations.\n", "  We consider the relationship between the masses of the central objects in\ndisky galaxies - supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and nuclear star clusters\n(NCs) - and various parameters of parent galaxies: velocity of rotation\n$V_{(2)}$ at $R= 2$ kpc, maximal velocity of rotation $V_{\\textrm{max}}$, the\nindicative dynamical mass $M_{25}$, the total mass of the stellar population\n$M_{*}$, and the total color index ($B{-}V$). The mass of nuclear clusters\n$M_{\\rm nc}$ correlates more closely with the kinematic parameters and total\nmass of galaxies than the mass of central black holes $M_{\\rm bh}$, including\ncorrelation with the velocity $V_{\\textrm{max}}$, which characterizes the\nvirial mass of the dark halo. On average, lenticular galaxies are distinguished\nby higher masses $M_{\\rm bh}$ compared to other types of galaxies with similar\ncharacteristics. The dependence of masses of central objects on the color index\nis bimodal: galaxies of the red group (red-sequence), which have ($B{-}V) >\n0.6{-}0.7$, being mostly early-type galaxies, differ from bluer galaxies, by\nhigher values of $M_{\\rm nc}$ and $M_{\\rm bh}$. The red-group galaxies have\nsystematically higher $M_{\\rm bh}$ values, even when the host-galaxy parameters\nare similar. In contrast, in the case of nuclear stellar clusters, the \"blue\"\nand \"red\" galaxies form unified sequences at the diagrams. The results agree\nwith scenarios in which most red-group galaxies form as a result of the partial\nor complete loss of interstellar gas in a stage of high nuclear activity in\ngalaxies whose central black-hole mass exceeds $10^6 {-} 10^7 M_{\\odot}$\n(depending on the total mass of a galaxy). Most of galaxies with $M_{\\rm bh}>\n10^7 M_{\\odot}$ are lenticular galaxies (types S0, E/S0), whose disks are\nusually devoid of gas.\n", "  In the crystal growth of transition metal dichalcogenides by the Chemical\nVapor Transport method (CVT), the choice of the transport agent plays a key\nrole. We have investigated the effect of various chemical elements and\ncompounds on the growth of TiSe2, MoSe2, TaS2 and TaSe2 and found that pure I2\nis the most suitable for growing TiSe2, whereas transition metal chlorides\nperform best with Mo- and Ta- chalcogenides. The use of TaCl5 as a transport\nagent in the CVT process allows to selectively growth either polymorph of TaS2\nand TaSe2 and the optimum growth conditions are reported. Moreover, by using\nTaCl5 and tuning the temperature and the halogen starting ratio, it was\npossible to grow whiskers of the compounds TaS2, TaSe2, TaTe2, TaS3 and TaSe3.\n", "  The kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is used in many scientific fields in\napplications involving rare-event transitions. Due to its discrete stochastic\nnature, efforts to parallelize kMC approaches often produce unbalanced time\nevolutions requiring complex implementations to ensure correct statistics. In\nthe context of parallel kMC, the sequential update technique has shown promise\nby generating high quality distributions with high relative efficiencies for\nshort-range systems. In this work, we provide an extension of the sequential\nupdate method in a parallel context that rigorously obeys detailed balance,\nwhich guarantees exact equilibrium statistics for all parallelization settings.\nOur approach also preserves nonequilibrium dynamics with minimal error for many\nparallelization settings, and can be used to achieve highly precise sampling.\n", "  We present results from an extensive spectroscopic survey of field stars in\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). 3037 sources, predominantly first-ascent red\ngiants, spread across roughly 37.5 sq. deg, are analysed. The line of sight\nvelocity field is dominated by the projection of the orbital motion of the SMC\naround the LMC/Milky Way. The residuals are inconsistent with both a\nnon-rotating spheroid and a nearly face on disk system. The current sample and\nprevious stellar and HI kinematics can be reconciled by rotating disk models\nwith line of nodes position angle, theta, ~ 120-130 deg., moderate inclination\n(i ~ 25-70 deg.), and rotation curves rising at 20-40 km/s/kpc. The metal-poor\nstars exhibit a lower velocity gradient and higher velocity dispersion than the\nmetal-rich stars. If our interpretation of the velocity patterns as bulk\nrotation is appropriate, then some revision to simulations of the SMC orbit is\nrequired since these are generally tuned to the SMC disk line-of-nodes lying in\na NE-SW direction. Residuals show strong spatial structure indicative of\nnon-circular motions that increase in importance with increasing distance from\nthe SMC centre. Kinematic substructure in the north-west part of our survey\narea is associated with the tidal tail or Counter-Bridge predicted by\nsimulations. Lower line-of-sight velocities towards the Wing and the larger\nvelocities just beyond the SW end of the SMC Bar are probably associated with\nstellar components of the Magellanic Bridge and Counter-Bridge, respectively.\nOur results reinforce the notion that the intermediate-age stellar population\nof the SMC is subject to substantial stripping by external forces.\n", "  This paper derives a prediction for the variation of the amplitude of the\ndielectric loss from isomorph theory, and presents an experimental test of the\nprediction performed by measuring the dielectric-relaxation behavior of the van\nder Waals liquid 5-phenyl-4-ether (5PPE). The liquid is studied at isochronal\nstates in the temperature range $266-333$ K and pressure range $0.1-300$ MPa,\nfor relaxation times around $10^{-3}$ s and $10^{-4}$ s. From the isomorph\nstatement that there is structural and dynamic invariance of isomorph states in\nreduced units for Roskilde simple liquids we derive four equivalent\nisomorph-invariant terms, one of which is used in analyzing our data. It is the\nfrequency-dependent term $\\chi_{e}(f) \\rho^{\\gamma-1}$, with electric\nsusceptibility $\\chi_{e}$, density $\\rho$, and density-scaling factor $\\gamma$.\nDue to the unique design of our experimental setup, we obtain dielectric loss\ndata where the amplitude is reproducible $\\pm 0.1 \\%$. We moreover find that\nthe empty capacitance of the capacitor cell is stable within $\\pm 0.3 \\%$ in\nour measuring range and can be assumed to be constant. Using this we predict\nfor two isomorph states there is $-C_{2}\"(f)= -C_{1}\"(f) \\left(\\rho_1 / \\rho_2\n\\right)^{\\gamma-1}$ to scale the negative imaginary capacitance, where $C_{1}$\nis the capacitance measurement at ambient pressure and $C_{2}$ is the predicted\ncapacitance at elevated pressure. We visually compare the predicted and\nmeasured plots and there is good match between the two plots among the 42 pairs\nof isochronal states from the measurement.\n", "  A unified framework to derive discrete time-marching schemes for coupling of\nimmersed solid and elastic objects to the lattice Boltzmann method is\npresented. Based on operator splitting for the discrete Boltzmann equation,\nsecond-order time-accurate schemes for the immersed boundary method, viscous\nforce coupling and external boundary force are derived. Furthermore, a modified\nformulation of the external boundary force is introduced that leads to a more\naccurate no-slip boundary condition. The derivation also reveals that the\ncoupling methods can be cast into a unified form, and that the immersed\nboundary method can be interpreted as the limit of force coupling for vanishing\nparticle mass. In practice, the ratio between fluid and particle mass\ndetermines the strength of the force transfer in the coupling. The integration\nschemes formally improve the accuracy of first-order algorithms that are\ncommonly employed when coupling immersed objects to a lattice Boltzmann fluid.\nIt is anticipated that they will also lead to superior long-time stability in\nsimulations of complex fluids with multiple scales.\n", "  The theory of isomorphs is reformulated by defining Roskilde-simple systems\n(those with isomorphs) by the property that the order of the potential energies\nof configurations at one density is maintained when these are scaled uniformly\nto a different density. Isomorphs remain curves in the thermodynamic phase\ndiagram along which structure, dynamics, and excess entropy are invariant,\nimplying that the phase diagram is effectively one-dimensional with respect to\nmany reduced-unit properties. In contrast to the original formulation of the\nisomorph theory, however, the density-scaling exponent is not exclusively a\nfunction of density and the isochoric heat capacity is not an exact isomorph\ninvariant. A prediction is given for the latter quantity's variation along the\nisomorphs. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Lennard-Jones and\nLennard-Jones Gaussian systems validate the new approach.\n", "  Asphaltene and smaller aromatic molecules tend to form linear nanoaggregates\nin bitumen.Over the years bitumen undergoes chemical aging and during this\nprocess, the size of the nanoaggregate increases. This increase is associated\nwith an increase in viscosity and brittleness of the bitumen, eventually\nleading to road deterioration. This paper focuses on understanding the\nmechanisms behind nanoaggregate size and stability. We used molecular dynamics\nsimulations to quantify the probability of having a nanoaggregate of a given\nsize in the stationary regime. To model this complicated behavior, we chose\nfirst to consider the simple case where only asphaltene molecules are counted\nin a nanoaggregate. We used a master equation approach and a related\nstatistical mechanics model. The linear asphaltene nanoaggregates behave as a\nrigid linear chain. The most complicated case where all aromatic molecules are\ncounted in a nanoaggregate is then discussed. The linear aggregates where all\naromatic molecules are counted seem to behave as a flexible linear chain.\n", "  We give a microscopic two dimensional ${\\cal N}=(2,2)$ gauge theory\ndescription of arbitrary M2-branes ending on $N_f$ M5-branes wrapping a\npunctured Riemann surface. These realize surface operators in four dimensional\n${\\cal N}=2$ field theories. We show that the expectation value of these\nsurface operators on the sphere is captured by a Toda CFT correlation function\nin the presence of an additional degenerate vertex operator labelled by a\nrepresentation ${\\cal R}$ of $SU(N_f)$, which also labels M2-branes ending on\nM5-branes. We prove that symmetries of Toda CFT correlators provide a geometric\nrealization of dualities between two dimensional gauge theories, including\n${\\cal N}=(2,2)$ analogues of Seiberg and Kutasov--Schwimmer dualities. As a\nbonus, we find new explicit conformal blocks, braiding matrices, and fusion\nrules in Toda CFT.\n", "  Using the first-principles density functional approach, we investigate\nCa$_2$FeOsO$_6$, a material of double perovskite structure synthesized\nrecently. According to the calculations, Ca$_2$FeOsO$_6$ is a ferrimagnetic\nMott-insulator influenced by the cooperative effect of spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) and Coulomb interactions of Fe-3$d$ and Os-5$d$ electrons, as well as the\ncrystal field. When Fe is replaced with Ni, the system exhibits half metallic\n(HM) states desirable for spintronic applications. In\n[Ca$_2$Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$OsO$_6$]$_2$, HM ferrimagnetism is observed with\n$\\mu_{\\rm tot}=2\\mu_{\\rm B}$ per unit cell for doping rate $x=0.5$, whereas HM\nantiferromagnetism (HMAFM) with nearly zero spin magnetization in the unit cell\nfor $x=1$, respectively. It is emphasized that half metallicity is retained\neven with SOC effect due to the large exchange-splitting between spin-up and\nspin-down bands close to the Fermi level.\n", "  Without any knowledge of the symmetry existing in the system, we derive the\nexact forms of the order parameters which show long-range correlation in the\nground state of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model using a quantum\ninformation approach. Our work demonstrates that the quantum information\napproach can help us to find the explicit form of the order parameter, which\ncannot be derived systematically via traditional methods in the condensed\nmatter theory.\n", "  Stellar kinematic groups are kinematical coherent groups of stars which might\nshare a common origin.These groups spread through the Galaxy over time due to\ntidal effects caused by Galactic rotation and disc heating.However, the\nchemical information survives these processes. The information provided by the\nanalysis of chemical elements can reveal the origin of these kinematic groups.\nHere we investigate the origin of the stars that belong to the Ursa Major\nMoving Group. We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained\nfrom three different spectrographs of kinematically selected FGK stars of the\nUrsa Major moving group. Stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), xi, and\n[Fe/H]) were determined using our own automatic code (StePar) which makes use\nof the sensitivity of iron equivalent widths measured in the spectra. We\ncritically compare the StePar results with other methods (Teff values derived\nusing the infrared flux method and log(g) values based on Hipparcos\nparallaxes). We derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements, and their\n[X/Fe] ratios of all stars in the sample. We perform a differential abundance\nanalysis with respect to a reference star of the UMa MG (HD115043). We have\nalso carried out a systematic comparison of the abundance pattern of the Ursa\nMajor MG and the Hyades SC with the thin disc stellar abundances. Our chemical\ntagging analysis indicates that the Ursa Major MG is less affected by field\nstar contamination than other moving groups (such as the Hyades SC). We find a\nroughly solar iron composition for the finally selected stars, whereas the\n[X/Fe] ratios are roughly sub-solar except for super-solar Barium abundance.We\nconclude that 29 out of 44 (i.e. 66 %) candidate stars share a similar chemical\ncomposition. In addition, we find that the abundance pattern of the Ursa Major\nMG might be marginally different from that of the Hyades SC.\n", "  The interplay between spontaneously broken gauge symmetries and Bose-Einstein\ncondensation has long been controversially discussed in science, since the\nequation of motions are invariant under phase transformations. Within the\npresent model it is illustrated that spontaneous symmetry breaking appears as a\nnon-local process in position space, but within disjoint subspaces of the\nunderlying Hilbert space. Numerical simulations show that it is the symmetry of\nthe relative phase distribution between condensate and non-condensate quantum\nfields which is spontaneously broken when passing the critical temperature for\nBose-Einstein condensation. Since the total number of gas particles remains\nconstant over time, the global U(1)-gauge symmetry of the system is preserved.\n", "  We consider a charged particle moving in a two dimensional plane in the\npresence of a background magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, i.e. the\nLandau system in a phase-space where the coordinates and momenta both follow\ncanonical noncommutative algebra. A set of generalized transformations is\nderived in this paper which maps the NC problem to an equivalent commutative\nproblem. In this set up, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Landau\nlevels. For the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the phase-shift is found to contain\ncorrections due to phase-space noncommutativity and also depends on the scaling\nparameter appearing in the generalized transformations. The result agrees with\nthose in the literature upto first order in the noncommutative parameters when\nproper choice of the scaling parameter is taken. We then obtain the magnetic\nlength and degeneracy of the Landau levels, both are seen to admit NC\ncorrections. The Landau levels are seen to get altered due to phase-space\nnoncommutativity as well. This energy spectrum of the Landau system is computed\nfrom two different perspectives, namely the explicit NC variable approach and\nthe commutative-equivalent approach. The results match exactly, solidifying the\nevidence in favour of the equivalence of the two approaches.\n", "  Thermodynamic entropy, as defined by Clausius, characterizes macroscopic\nobservations of a system based on phenomenological quantities such as\ntemperature and heat. In contrast, information-theoretic entropy, introduced by\nShannon, is a measure of uncertainty. In this Letter, we connect these two\nnotions of entropy, using an axiomatic framework for thermodynamics [Lieb,\nYngvason, Proc. Roy. Soc.(2013)]. In particular, we obtain a direct relation\nbetween the Clausius entropy and the Shannon entropy, or its generalisation to\nquantum systems, the von Neumann entropy. More generally, we find that entropy\nmeasures relevant in non-equilibrium thermodynamics correspond to entropies\nused in one-shot information theory.\n", "  Motivated by realistic scattering processes of composite systems, we study\nthe dynamics of a two-particle bound system which is scattered at a mirror. The\nphysics of the scattering process will be discussed in the cases when only one\nparticle interacts directly with the mirror and when both particles are\nscattered directly. It is shown that the coherence between the transmitted and\nthe reflected wave-packet becomes reduced due to the scattering process. When\nboth particles interact directly with the mirror, the system exhibits\nlong-lived resonances. The results should be of interest for interference\nexperiments with composite systems.\n", "  Carbon is conventionally not associated with magnetism, and much of the\ndiscussion of its nanotechnology perspectives appears to be centered on its\nelectron transport properties. Among the few existing examples of magnetic\ncarbon production, none has found a direct applicability in scalable micro and\nnano fabrication, Here we introduce a paramagnetic form of carbon whose\nprecursor polymers can be lithographically patterned into micro and nano\nstructures prior to pyrolysis. This unreactive and thermally robust material\nfeatures strong room-temperature paramagnetism owing to a large number of\nunpaired electrons with restricted mobility, which is achieved by controlling\nthe progression of bond dissociation and formation during pyrolysis. The\nmanufacture of this magnetic carbon, having (3.97 x 0.8) 10^17 spins/ mg, can\nimmediately benefit a number of spintronic and magnetic MEMS applications, and\nalso shed light on the controversial theories concerning the existence and\nmechanisms of magnetism in carbon.\n", "  Understanding the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been crucial to\ncontrolling magnetic anisotropy in magnetic multilayer films. It has been shown\nthat electronic structure can be altered via interface SOC by varying the\nsuperlattice structure, resulting in spontaneous magnetization perpendicular or\nparallel to the plane. In lieu of magnetic thin films, we study the similarly\nanisotropic helimagnet Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, where the spin polarization\ndirection, controlled by the applied magnetic field, can modify the electronic\nstructure. As a result, the direction of spin polarization can modulate the\ndensity of states, and in turn affect the in-plane electrical conductivity. In\nCr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, we found an enhancement of in-plane conductivity when the\nspin polarization is out-of-plane, as compared to in-plane spin polarization.\nThis is consistent with the increase of density of states near the Fermi energy\nat the same spin configuration, found from first principles calculations. We\nalso observe unusual field dependence of the Hall signal in the same\ntemperature range. This is unlikely to originate from the non-collinear spin\ntexture, but rather further indicates strong dependence of electronic structure\non spin orientation relative to the plane.\n", "  The Bochkov-Kuzovlev nonlinear fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to\nderive Narayanaswamy's phenomenological theory of physical aging, in which this\nhighly nonlinear phenomenon is described by a linear material-time convolution\nintegral. A characteristic property of the Narayanaswamy aging description is\nmaterial-time translational invariance, which is here taken as the basic\nassumption of the derivation. It is shown that only one possible definition of\nthe material time obeys this invariance, namely the square of the distance\ntravelled from a configuration of the system far back in time. The paper\nconcludes with suggestions for computer simulations that test for consequences\nof material-time translational invariance. One of these is the\n\"unique-triangles property\" according to which any three points on the system's\npath form a triangle such that two side lengths determine the third; this is\nequivalent to the well-known triangular relation for time-autocorrelation\nfunctions of aging spin glasses [L. F. Cugliandolo and J. Kurchan, J. Phys. A:\nMath. Gen. 27, 5749 (1994)]. The unique-triangles property implies a simple\ngeometric interpretation of out-of-equilibrium time-autocorrelation functions,\nwhich extends to aging a previously proposed framework for such functions in\nequilibrium [J. C. Dyre, cond-mat/9712222].\n", "  It has been known for a long time that many simple liquids have surprisingly\nsimilar structure as quantified, e.g., by the radial distribution function. A\nmuch more recent realization is that the dynamics are also very similar for a\nnumber of systems with quite different pair potentials. Systems with such\nnon-trivial similarities are generally referred to as \"quasi-universal\". From\nthe fact that the exponentially repulsive pair potential has strong virial\npotential-energy correlations in the low-temperature part of its thermodynamic\nphase diagram, we here show that a liquid is quasi-universal if its pair\npotential can be written approximately as a sum of exponential terms with\nnumerically large prefactors. Based on evidence from the literature we moreover\nconjecture the converse, i.e., that quasi-universality only applies for systems\nwith this property.\n", "  Evolution of a particle in an inverse square potential is studied. We derive\nan equation of motion for $\\left<r^2\\right>$ and solve it exactly. It gives us\na possibility to identify the conditions under which a falling of a quantum\nparticle into an attractive centre is possible. We get the time of falling of a\nparticle from an initial state into the centre. An example of a\nquasi-stationary state which evolves with $\\left<r^2\\right>$ being constant in\ntime is given. We demonstrate the existence of quantum limit of falling,\nnamely, a particle does not fall into the attractive centre, when coupling\nconstant is smaller then some critical value. Our results are compared with\nexperimental measurements of neutral atoms falling in the electric field of a\ncharged wire. Moreover, we propose modifications of the experiment, which allow\nto observe quantum limit of falling.\n", "  The optoelectronic properties of single- and double-wall carbon nanotubes\n(CNTs) noncovalently functionalized with tetraphenylporphyrins (TPPs) are\naddressed by dispersion-corrected ab initio calculations. Five CNT species with\ndifferent chiralities were considered. We find that the most stable\nconfigurations are those where the CNTs are fully covered by TPPs, exhibiting\nbinding energy of about 2~eV/TPP. The semiconducting CNT-TPP compounds show\noptical response characterized by a strong absorption associated to the TPP\nbands, with increasing intensity with the TPP concentration. In addition,\nmolecular dynamic simulations show that the compounds would be stable at\ntemperatures as high as 100$^{\\circ}$C.\n", "  This paper introduces the fundamental continuum theory governing momentum\ntransport in isotropic nanofluidic flows. The theory is an extension to the\nclassical Navier-Stokes equation, which includes coupling between translational\nand rotational degrees of freedom, as well as non-local response functions that\nincorporates spatial correlations. The continuum theory is compared with\nmolecular dynamics simulation data for both relaxation processes and fluid\nflows showing excellent agreement on the nanometer length scale. We also\npresent practical tools to estimate when the extended theory should be used.\n", "  This paper presents accurate data for the physical aging of organic glasses\njust below the glass transition probed by monitoring the following quantities\nafter temperature up and down jumps: the shear-mechanical resonance frequency\n(around 360 kHz), the dielectric loss at 1 Hz, the real part of the dielectric\nconstant at 10 kHz, and the loss-peak frequency of the dielectric beta process\n(around 10 kHz). The setup used allows for keeping temperature constant within\n100 micro Kelvin and for thermal equilibration within a few seconds after a\ntemperature jump. The data conform to a new simplified version of the classical\nTool-Narayanaswamy aging formalism, which makes it possible to calculate one\nrelaxation curve directly from another without any fitting to analytical\nfunctions.\n", "  Since the experimental observation of quantum mechanical scattering phase\nshift in mesoscopic systems, several aspects of it has not yet been understood.\nThe experimental observations has also accentuated many theoretical problems\nrelated to Friedel sum rule and negativity of partial density of states. We\naddress these problems using the concepts of Argand diagram and Burgers\ncircuit. We can prove the possibility of negative partial density of states in\nmesoscopic systems. Such a conclusive and general evidence cannot be given in\none, two or three dimensions. We can show a general connection between phase\ndrops and exactness of semi classical Friedel sum rule. We also show Argand\ndiagram for a scattering matrix element can be of few classes based on their\ntopology and all observations can be classified accordingly.\n", "  In this paper, we deal with quantum theories on presheaves and sheaves on\ncontext categories consisting of commutative von Neumann algebras of bounded\noperators on a Hilbert space, from two viewpoints. One is to reduce\npresheaf-based topos quantum theory via sheafification, and the other is to\nimport quantum probabilities to the reduced sheaf quantum theory. The first is\ndone by means of a functor that selects some expedient contexts. It defines a\nGrothendieck topology on the category consisting of all contexts, hence,\ninduces a sheaf topos on which we construct a downsized quantum theory. Also,\nwe show that the sheaf quantum theory can be replaced by an equivalent, more\nmanageable presheaf quantum theory. Quantum probabilities are imported by means\nof a Grothendieck topology that is defined on a category consisting of\nprobabilities and enables to regard them as intuitionistic truth-values. From\nthese topologies, we construct another Grothendieck topology that is defined on\nthe product of the context category and the probability category and reflects\nthe selection of contexts and the identification of probabilities with\ntruth-values. We construct a quantum theory equipped with quantum probabilities\nas truth-values on the sheaf topos induced by the Grothendieck topology.\n", "  We present first-principles calculations of elastic properties of\nmultilayered two-dimensional crystals such as graphene, h-BN and 2H-MoS2 which\nshows that their Poisson's ratios along out-of-plane direction are negative,\nnear zero and positive, respectively, spanning all possibilities for sign of\nthe ratios. While the in-plane Poisson's ratios are all positive regardless of\ntheir disparate electronic and structural properties, the characteristic\ninterlayer interactions as well as layer stacking structures are shown to\ndetermine the sign of their out-of-plane ratios. Thorough investigation of\nelastic properties as a function of the number of layers for each system is\nalso provided, highlighting their intertwined nature between elastic and\nelectronic properties.\n", "  We report the plausibility of using quantum mechanical transitions, induced\nby the combined effect of Gravitational wave (GW) and noncommutative (NC)\nstructure of space, among the states of a 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator, to\nprobe the spatial NC geometry. The phonon modes excited by the passing GW\nwithin the resonant bar-detector are formally identical to forced harmonic\noscillator and they represent a length variation of roughly the same order of\nmagnitude as the characteristic length-scale of spatial noncommutativity\nestimated from the phenomenological upper bound of the NC parameter. This\nmotivates our present work. We employ various GW wave-forms that are typically\nexpected from possible astronomical sources. We find that the transition\nprobablities are quite sensitive to the nature of polarization of the GW. We\nalso elaborate on the particular type of sources of GW, radiation from which\ncan induce transitions that can be used as effective probe of the spatial\nnoncommutative structure.\n", "  The previous paper [Veldhorst et al., J. Chem. Phys. 141, 054904 (2014)]\ndemonstrated that the isomorph theory explains the scaling properties of a\nliquid of flexible chains consisting of ten Lennard-Jones particles connected\nby rigid bonds. We here investigate the same model with harmonic bonds. The\nintroduction of harmonic bonds almost completely destroys the correlations in\nthe equilibrium fluctuations of the potential energy and the virial. According\nto the isomorph theory, if these correlations are strong a system has\nisomorphs, curves in the phase diagram along which structure, dynamics and the\nexcess entropy are invariant. The Lennard-Jones chain liquid with harmonic\nbonds does have curves in the phase diagram along which the structure and\ndynamics are invariant. The excess entropy is not invariant on these curves,\nwhich we refer to as \"pseudoisomorphs\". In particular this means that\nRosenfeld's excess-entropy scaling (the dynamics being a function of excess\nentropy only) does not apply for the Lennard-Jones chain with harmonic bonds.\n", "  Despite many nice properties and numerous achievements, general relativity is\nnot a complete theory. One of actual approaches towards more complete theory of\ngravity is its nonlocal modification. We present here a brief review of\nnonlocal gravity with its cosmological solutions. In particular, we pay special\nattention to two nonlocal models and their nonsingular bounce solutions for the\ncosmic scale factor.\n", "  We present an improved determination of the up- and down-quark distributions\nin the proton using recent data on charged lepton asymmetries from $W^\\pm$\ngauge-boson production at the LHC and Tevatron. The analysis is performed in\nthe framework of a global fit of parton distribution functions. The fit results\nare consistent with a non-zero iso-spin asymmetry of the sea, $x(\\bar d - \\bar\nu)$, at small values of Bjorken $x\\sim 10^{-4}$ indicating a delayed onset of\nthe Regge asymptotics of a vanishing $(\\bar d - \\bar u)$-asymmetry at\nsmall-$x$. We compare with up- and down-quark distributions available in the\nliterature and provide accurate predictions for the production of single\ntop-quarks at the LHC, a process which can serve as a standard candle for the\nlight quark flavor content of the proton.\n", "  Extra-large deformations in ultra-soft elastic materials are ubiquitous, yet\nsystematic studies and methods to understand the mechanics of such huge strains\nare lacking. Here we investigate this complex problem systematically with a\nsimple experiment: by introducing a heavy bead of radius $a$ in an\nincompressible ultra-soft elastic medium. We find a scaling law for the\npenetration depth ($\\delta$) of the bead inside the softest gels as $\\delta\n\\sim a^{3/2}$. While this result is inconsistent with an ideal neo-Hookean\nmodel of elastic deformation, according to which the displacement fields must\ndiverge, it is vindicated by an original asymptotic analytic model developed in\nthis article. This model demonstrates that the observed relationship is\nprecisely at the demarcating boundary of what would be required for the field\nvariables to either diverge or converge. This correspondence between a unique\nmathematical prediction and the experimental observation ushers in new insights\ninto the behavior of the deformations of strongly non-linear materials.\n", "  In this paper, we study the three-body decays $B^0/B^0_s \\to \\eta_c f_0(X)\\to\n\\eta_c \\pi^+\\pi^-$ by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization\napproach. We evaluate the $S$-wave resonance contributions by using the\ntwo-pion distribution amplitude $\\Phi_{\\pi\\pi}^{\\rm S}$. The Breit-Wigner\nformula for the $f_0(500)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1790)$ resonances and the\nFlatt\\'e model for the $f_0(980)$ resonance are adopted to parameterize the\ntime-like scalar form factors $F_{s}(\\omega^2)$. We also use the D.~V.~Bugg\nmodel to parameterize the $f_0(500)$ and compare the relevant theoretical\npredictions from different models. We found the following results: (a) the PQCD\npredictions for the branching ratios are ${\\cal B}(B^0\\to \\eta_c\nf_0(500)[\\pi^+\\pi^-])= \\left ( 1.53 ^{+0.76}_{-0.35} \\right ) \\times 10^{-6}$\nfor Breit-Wigner model and ${\\cal B}(B^0\\to \\eta_c f_0(500)[\\pi^+\\pi^-])= \\left\n( 2.31 ^{+0.96}_{-0.48} \\right ) \\times 10^{-6}$ for D.~V.~Bugg model; (b) $\n{\\cal B}(B_s\\to \\eta_c f_0(X)[\\pi^+\\pi^-] ) =\\left ( 5.02^{+1.49}_{-1.08}\n\\right )\\times 10^{-5}$ when the contributions from\n$f_0(X)=(f_0(980),f_0(1500),f_0(1790))$ are all taken into account; and (c) The\nconsidered decays could be measured at the ongoing LHCb experiment,\nconsequently, the formalism of two-hadron distribution amplitudes could also be\ntested by such experiments.\n", "  Relaxational processes in ordered phases of one-dimensional Ising models with\nlong-range interactions are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. Three\ntypes of spin model, the pure ferromagnetic, the diluted ferromagnetic, and the\nspin glass models, are examined. The effective dimension of the one-dimensional\nsystems are controlled by a parameter $\\sigma$, which tunes the rate of\ninteraction decay. Systematical investigations of droplet dynamics, from the\nlower to the upper critical dimension, are conducted by changing the value of\n$\\sigma$. Comparing numerical data with the droplet theory, it is found that\nthe surface dimension of droplets is distributed around the effective\ndimension. The distribution in the surface dimension makes the droplet dynamics\ncomplex and extremely enhances dynamical crossover.\n", "  The quantum Fisher information represents the continuous family of metrics on\nthe space of quantum states and places the fundamental limit on the accuracy of\nquantum state estimation. We show that the entire family of the quantum Fisher\ninformation can be determined from linear response theory through generalized\ncovariances. We derive the generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem that\nrelates the linear response function to generalized covariances and hence\nallows us to determine the quantum Fisher information from linear response\nfunctions, which is experimentally measurable quantities. As an application, we\nexamine the skew information, which is one of the quantum Fisher information,\nof a harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium, and show that the equality of\nthe skew information-based uncertainty relation holds.\n", "  The fermionic fields constructed from Elko have several unexpected\nproperties. They satisfy the Klein-Gordon but not the Dirac equation and are of\nmass dimension one instead of three-half. Starting with the Klein-Gordon\nLagrangian, we initiate a careful study of the symmetries and interactions of\nthese fermions and their higher-spin generalisations. We find, although the\nfermions are of mass dimension one, the four-point fermionic self-interaction\nviolates unitarity at high-energy. Therefore, it cannot be a fundamental\ninteraction of the theory. It follows that for the spin-half fermions, the\ndemand of renormalisability and unitarity forbids four-point interactions and\nonly allows for the Yukawa interaction. For fermions with spin j>1/2, they have\nno renormalisable or unitary interactions. Since the theory is described by a\nKlein-Gordon Lagrangian, the interaction generated by the local $U(1)$ gauge\nsymmetry which contains a four-point interaction, is excluded by the demand of\nrenormalisability. In the context of the Standard Model, these properties make\nthe spin-half fermions natural dark matter candidates.\n", "  Recent progress in theory, experiment and observation challenges the mean\nfield models using the conventional Skyrme interaction, suggesting that the\nextension of the conventional Skyrme interaction is necessary. In this work, by\nfitting the experimental data of a number of finite nuclei together with a few\nadditional constraints on nuclear matter using the simulated annealing method,\nwe construct three Skyrme interaction parameter sets, namely, eMSL07, eMSL08\nand eMSL09, based on an extended Skyrme interaction which includes additional\nmomentum and density dependent two-body forces to effectively simulate the\nmomentum dependence of the three-body force. The three new interactions can\nreasonably describe the ground-state properties and the isoscalar giant\nmonopole resonance energies of various spherical nuclei used in the fit as well\nas the ground-state properties of many other spherical nuclei, nicely conform\nto the current knowledge on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter,\neliminate the notorious unphysical instabilities of symmetric nuclear matter\nand pure neutron matter up to a very high density of $1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, and\nsimultaneously support heavier neutron stars with mass larger than two times\nsolar mass. One important difference of the three new interactions is about the\nprediction of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities, and these new\ninteractions are thus potentially useful for the determination of the largely\nuncertain high-density symmetry energy in future. In addition, a comparison is\nmade for the predictions of nuclear matter, finite nuclei and neutron stars\nwith the three new interactions versus those with three typical interactions\nBSk22, BSk24 and BSk26 from Brussels group.\n", "  The (super) Schottky uniformization of compact (super) Riemann surfaces is\nbriefly reviewed. Deformations of super Riemann surface by gravitinos and\nBeltrami parameters are recast in terms of super Schottky group cohomology. It\nis checked that the super Schottky group formula for the period matrix of a\nnon-split surface matches its expression in terms of a gravitino and Beltrami\nparameter on a split surface. The relationship between (super) Schottky groups\nand the construction of surfaces by gluing pairs of punctures is discussed in\nan appendix.\n", "  The gravitational field of a laser pulse of finite lifetime, is investigated\nin the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small,\nthey may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the\ngravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the\nnorm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise\nfor circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent\nof the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are\nconfined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these\nshells are associated with the emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby\ntest particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the\ngravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled\nfrom the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption.\nExamples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that\nmassless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are\nco-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test\nparticles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger\nthan for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational\neffect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed\nout. The spacetime curvature close to the pulse is compared to that induced by\ngravitational waves from astronomical sources.\n", "  The differential cross section for gravitational photon-photon scattering\ncalculated in Perturbative Quantum Gravity is shown to depend on the degree of\npolarization entanglement of the two photons. The interaction between photons\nin the symmetric Bell state is stronger than between not entangled photons. In\ncontrast, the interaction between photons in the anti-symmetric Bell state is\nweaker than between not entangled photons. The results are interpreted in terms\nof quantum interference, and it is shown how they fit into the idea of\ndistance-dependent forces.\n", "  We perform experiments and numerical simulations to investigate spatial\ndistribution of pressure in a sheared dilatant fluid of the Taylor-Couette flow\nunder a constant external shear stress. In a certain range of shear stress, the\nflow undergoes the shear thickening oscillation around 20 Hz. We find that,\nduring the oscillation, a localized thickened band rotates around the axis with\nthe flow. {Based upon experiments and numerical simulations, we show that a\nmajor part of the thickened band is under negative pressure even in the case of\ndiscontinuous shear thickening}, which indicates that the thickening is caused\nby Reynolds dilatancy; the dilatancy causes the negative pressure in\ninterstitial fluid, which generates contact structure in the granular medium.,\nthen frictional resistance hinders rearrangement of the structure and\nsolidifies the medium.\n", "  We calculate the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative\ncorrections to $P$-wave quarkonia annihilation decay to two photons, in the\nframework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. The order-$\\alpha_s^2$\nshort-distance coefficients associated with each helicity amplitude are\npresented in a semi-analytic form, including the \"light-by-light\"\ncontributions. With substantial NNLO corrections, we find disquieting\ndiscrepancy when confronting our state-of-the-art predictions with the latest\n\\textsf{BESIII} measurements, especially fail to account for the measured\n$\\chi_{c2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ width. Incorporating the effects of spin-dependent\nforces would even exacerbate the situation, since it lifts the degeneracy\nbetween the nonperturbative NRQCD matrix elements of $\\chi_{c0}$ and\n$\\chi_{c2}$ toward the wrong direction. We also present the order-$\\alpha_s^2$\npredictions to $\\chi_{b0,2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, which await the future\nexperimental test.\n", "  We present a combined theoretical and experimental study, investigating the\norigin of the enhanced non-adiabaticity of magnetic vortex cores. Scanning\ntransmission X-ray microscopy is used to image the vortex core gyration\ndynamically to measure the non-adiabaticity with high precision, including a\nhigh confidence upper bound. Using both numerical computations and analytical\nderivations, we show that the large non-adiabaticity parameter observed\nexperimentally can be explained by the presence of local spin currents arising\nfrom a texture-induced emergent Hall effect. This enhanced non-adiabaticity is\nonly present in two- and three-dimensional magnetic textures such as vortices\nand skyrmions and absent in one-dimensional domain walls, in agreement with\nexperimental observations.\n", "  We study the scalar, vector and tensor two-gluon and trigluon glueball\nspectra in the framework of 5-dimension dynamical holographic QCD model, where\nthe metric structure is deformed self-consistently by the dilaton field. For\ncomparison, the glueball spectra are also calculated in the hard-wall and\nsoft-wall holographic QCD models. In order to distinguish glueballs with even\nand odd parities, we introduce the positive and negative coupling between the\ndilaton field and glueballs, and for higher spin glueballs, we introduce a\ndeformed 5-dimension mass. With this set-up, there is only one free parameter\nfrom the quadratic dilaton profile in the dynamical holographic QCD model,\nwhich is fixed by the scalar glueball spectra. It is found that the two-gluon\nglueball spectra produced in the dynamical holographic QCD model are in good\nagreement with lattice data. Among six trigluon glueballs, the produced masses\nfor $1^{\\pm -}$ and $2^{--}$ are in good agreement with lattice data, and the\nproduced masses for $0^{--}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ are around 1.5 {\\rm GeV}\nlighter than lattice results. This result might indicate that the three\ntrigluon glueballs of $0^{--}$, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ are dominated by\nthree-gluon condensate contribution.\n", "  The design, construction and test of a charged particle detector made of\nscintillation counters read by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) is described.\nThe detector, which operates in vacuum and is used as a veto counter in the\nNA62 experiment at CERN, has a single channel time resolution of 1.14 ns, a\nspatial resolution of ~2.5 mm and an efficiency very close to 1 for penetrating\ncharged particles.\n", "  The electronic structure of La2NiO4+d, where additional oxygen interstitials\nare forming stripes along (1,1,0), are presented. Spin-polarized calculations\nshow that ferromagnetism on Ni sites is reduced near the stripes and enhanced\nfar from the stripes. Totally the magnetic moment becomes reduced because of\noxygen interstitials. It is suggested that the oxygen interstitial\nconcentration in oxygen rich domains in nickelates suppress magnetism and give\nmultiband metallic domains.\n", "  While it was known that High Temperature Superconductivity appears in\ncuprates showing complex multiscale phase separation due to inhomogeneous\ncharge density wave (CDW) order, the spatial distribution of CDW domains\nremained an open question for a long time, because of the lack of experimental\nprobes able to visualize their spatial distribution at mesoscale, between\natomic and macroscopic scale. Recently scanning micro X-ray Diffraction (SmXRD)\nrevealed CDW crystalline electronic puddles with a complex fat-tailed spatial\ndistribution of their size. In this work we have determined and mapped the\nanisotropy of the Charge Density Waves (CDW) puddles in HgBa2CuO4+y (Hg1201)\nsingle crystal. We discuss the emergence of high temperature superconductivity\nin the interstitial space with hyperbolic geometry, that opens a new paradigm\nfor quantum coherence at high temperature where negative dielectric function\nand interference between different pathways can help to raise the critical\ntemperature.\n", "  After the Higgs boson discovery, it is established that the Higgs mechanism\nexplains electroweak symmetry breaking and generates the masses of all\nparticles in the Standard Model, with the possible exception of neutrino\nmasses. The hierarchies among fermion masses and mixing angles remain however\nunexplained. We propose a new class of two Higgs doublet models in which a\nflavor symmetry broken at the electroweak scale addresses this problem. The\nmodels are strongly constrained by electroweak precision tests and the fact\nthat they produce modifications to Higgs couplings and flavor changing neutral\ncurrents; they are also constrained by collider searches for extra scalar\nbosons. The surviving models are very predictive, implying unavoidable new\nphysics signals at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, e.g. extra Higgs Bosons with\nmasses $M < 700$ GeV.\n", "  Despite decades of intense study, the mechanisms underlying the extraordinary\ndynamics of supercooled liquids as they approach the glass transition remain,\nat best, mis-characterized, and at worst, misunderstood. A long standing\nendeavor is to understand the remarkable increase of the viscosity with\nsupercooling. Recently, a new theory of supercooled liquids has been proposed\nthat starts from first principles, using elementary statistical mechanics\narguments, to derive a form for the viscosity that contains only a single\nfitting parameter in its simplest form. In this we demonstrate that this exact\nsame form may be derived from a different starting point, and then critically\nexamine its performance. In the process we find that functional form proposed\nfits the viscosity data of a diverse group of 45 liquids exceptionally well\nover a wide temperature range, and uncover a number of interesting correlations\nof the single parameter with various thermodynamic quantities, ultimately\nallowing for the prediction of low temperature viscosity from high temperature\ndata. Additionally, we find that similar physical reasoning can be used to\nderive a similar, single parameter form for the viscosity of hard-sphere/jammed\nliquids. We demonstrate that this form accurately reproduces the viscosity of\nhard-spheres, suggesting an underlying universality in metastable dynamics.\n", "  In the context of extended phase space thermodynamics and the AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence, we consider the chemical potential ($\\mu$) dual to the number\nof colours ($N$) of the boundary gauge theory, in the grand canonical ensemble.\nBy appropriately defining $\\mu$ via densities of thermodynamic quantities, we\nshow that it changes sign precisely at the Hawking-Page transition for\nAdS-Schwarzschild and RN-AdS black holes in five dimensions, signalling the\nonset of quantum effects at the transition point. Such behaviour is absent for\nnon-rotating black holes in four dimensions. For Kerr-AdS black holes in four\nand five dimensions, our analysis points to the fact that $\\mu$ can change sign\nin the stable black hole region, i.e above the Hawking-Page transition\ntemperature, for a range of angular frequencies. We also analyse AdS black\nholes in five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and find similar features for\n$\\mu$ as in the Kerr-AdS case.\n", "  We address the technical challenges when performing quantum information\nexperiments with ultracold Rydberg atoms in lattice geometries. We discuss the\nfollowing key aspects: (i) The coherent manipulation of atomic ground states,\n(ii) the coherent excitation of Rydberg states, and (iii) spatial addressing of\nindividual lattice sites. We briefly review methods and solutions which have\nbeen successfully implemented, and give examples based on our experimental\napparatus. This includes an optical phase-locked loop, an intensity and\nfrequency stabilization setup for lasers, and a nematic liquid-crystal spatial\nlight modulator.\n", "  These are notes from my lectures on quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver\nvarieties and K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas theory of threefolds given at\nColumbia and Park City Mathematics Institute. They contain an introduction to\nthe subject and a number of new results. In particular, we prove the main\nconjecture of arXiv:hep-th/0412021 and the conjecture of arXiv:1404.2323 in the\nsimplest case of reduced smooth curves. We also prove the the absence of\nquantum corrections to the capped vertex with descendents for sufficiently\nlarge framing (and polarization), which is a property we call large framing\nvanishing. The shift operators for minuscule shift are shown to be given by qKZ\noperators, which is a K-theoretic analog of the result of arXiv:1211.1287.\n", "  As an extension of the previous work [arXiv: 1512.02411], we have\ninvestigated the role of circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses while keeping\nother conditions the same. It is found that in the presence of large scale\npre-formed plasmas, super-high energetic electrons can be generated at\nrelativistic CP laser-solid interactions. For laser of intensity $10^{20}\\\n\\text{W}/\\text{cm}^2$ and pre-plasma scale-length $10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, the\ncut-off energy of electron by CP laser is $120\\ \\text{MeV}$ compared with $100\\\n\\text{MeV}$ in the case of linearly polarized (LP) laser. The unexpected\nsuper-high energetic electron acceleration can also be explained by the\ntwo-stage acceleration model, {by taking into account the envelop modulation\neffects of the reflected CP laser pulse.} The underlying physics of this\nenvelop modulation is figured out, and a modified first-stage electron\nacceleration scaling law in the presence of the modulated-CP laser is also\nobtained.\n", "  The presence of two components in the electron fluid of high temperature\nsuperconductors and the complex charge and lattice inhomogeneity have been the\nhot topics of the international conference of the superstripes series,\nSuperstripes 2015, held in Ischia in 2015. The debate on the mechanisms for\nreaching room temperature superconductivity has been boosted by the discovery\nof superconductivity with the highest critical temperature in pressurized\nsulfur hydride. Different complex electronic and structural landscapes showing\nup in superconductors which resist to the decoherence effects of high\ntemperature has been discussed. While low temperature superconductors described\nby the BCS approximation are made of a single condensate in the weak coupling\nthe high temperature superconductors are made of coexisting multiple\ncondensates, in different spots of the k-space and the real space, some in the\nBCS-BEC crossover regime and others in the BCS regime. The role of shape\nresonance in the exchange interaction between these different condensates, like\nthe Fano-Feshbach Resonance in ultracold gasses, is emerging as a key term for\nhigh temperature superconductivity.\n", "  We show that the limiting ground state energy of the spherical mixed p-spin\nmodel can be identified as the infimum of certain variational problem. This\ncomplements the well-known Parisi formula for the limiting free energy in the\nspherical model. As an application, we obtain explicit formulas for the\nlimiting ground state energy in the replica symmetry, one level of replica\nsymmetry breaking and full replica symmetry breaking phases at zero\ntemperature. In addition, our approach leads to new results on disorder chaos\nin spherical mixed even p-spin models. In particular, we prove that when there\nis no external field, the location of the ground state energy is chaotic under\nsmall perturbations of the disorder. We also establish that in the spherical\nmixed even p-spin model, the ground state energy superconcentrates in the\nabsence of external field, while it obeys a central limit theorem if the\nexternal field is present.\n", "  In this article, we study the speed of convergence of the supercell reduced\nHartree-Fock~(rHF) model towards the whole space rHF model in the case where\nthe crystal contains a local defect. We prove that, when the defect is charged,\nthe defect energy in a supercell model converges to the full rHF defect energy\nwith speed $L^{-1}$, where $L^3$ is the volume of the supercell. The\nconvergence constant is identified as the Makov-Payne correction term when the\ncrystal is isotropic cubic. The result is extended to the non-isotropic case.\n", "  Weyl fermions are massless chiral particles first predicted in 1929 and once\nthought to describe neutrinos. Although never observed as elementary particles,\nquasiparticles with Weyl dispersion have recently been experimentally\ndiscovered in solid-state systems causing a furore in the research community.\nSystems with Weyl excitations can display a plethora of fascinating phenomena\nand offer great potential for improved quantum technologies. Here we show that\nWeyl excitations generically exist in three-dimensional systems of dipolar\nparticles with weakly broken time-reversal symmetry (for example, by a magnetic\nfield). They emerge as a result of dipolar-interaction-induced transfer of\nangular momentum between the $J=0$ and $J=1$ internal particle levels. We also\ndiscuss momentum-resolved Ramsey spectroscopy methods for observing Weyl\nquasiparticles in cold alkaline-earth-atom systems. Our results provide a\npathway for a feasible experimental realisation of Weyl quasiparticles and\nrelated phenomena in clean and controllable atomic systems.\n", "  Chiral symmetry restoration high in the hadron spectra is expected but it\nremains to be confirmed both in lattice QCD computations and in experiments.\nRecently, a theorem was derived, relating chiral symmetry restoration high in\nthe hadron spectra to the spontaneous generation of the dynamical quark mass in\nQCD. We refine the theorem in the case of static-light mesons. Utilizing chiral\nquark model computations and lattice QCD results for the spectrum of mesons\ncomposed by a static antiquark and a light quark, we explore chiral symmetry\nrestoration in the spectrum and the quark running mass m(k).\n", "  We optomechanically measure the vibrations of a nanomechanical system made of\na graphene membrane suspended on a silicon nitride nanoresonator. When probing\nthe thermal noise of the coupled nanomechanical device, we observe a\nsignificant deviation from the normal mode expansion. It originates from the\nheterogeneous character of mechanical dissipation over the spatial extension of\ncoupled eigenmodes, which violates one of the fundamental prerequisite for\nemploying this commonly used description of the nanoresonators' thermal noise.\nWe subsequently measure the local mechanical susceptibility and demonstrate\nthat the fluctuation-dissipation theorem still holds and permits a proper\nevaluation of the thermal noise of the nanomechanical system. Since it\nnaturally becomes delicate to ensure a good spatial homogeneity at the\nnanoscale, this approach is fundamental to correctly describe the thermal noise\nof nanomechanical systems which ultimately impact their sensing capacity.\n", "  We show that the minimum Renyi entropy output of a quantum channel is locally\nadditive for Renyi parameter alpha>1. While our work extends the results of\n[10] (in which local additivity was proven for alpha=1), it is based on several\nnew techniques that incorporate the multiplicative nature of p-norms, in\ncontrast to the additivity property of the von-Neumann entropy. Our results\ndemonstrate that the counterexamples to the Renyi additivity conjectures\nexhibit global effects of quantum channels. Interestingly, the approach\npresented here can not be extended to Renyi entropies with parameter alpha<1.\n", "  Polycrystalline samples of the quarter-doped manganites\n$R_{0.75}$Ca$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ ($R$ = Y, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er) were studied by\nX-ray diffraction and AC/DC susceptibility measurements. All five samples are\northorhombic and exhibit similar magnetic properties: enhanced ferromagnetism\nbelow $T_1$ ($\\sim80$ K) and a spin glass (SG) state below $T_{SG}$ ($\\sim30$\nK). With increasing $R^{3+}$ ionic size, both $T_1$ and $T_{SG}$ generally\nincrease. The single crystal neutron diffraction results on\nTb$_{0.75}$Ca$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ revealed that the SG state is mainly composed of\na short-range ordered version of a novel canted (i.e. noncollinear)\nantiferromagnetic spin state. Furthermore, calculations based on the double\nexchange model for quarter-doped manganites reveal that this new magnetic phase\nprovides a transition state between the ferromagnetic state and the\ntheoretically predicted spin-orthogonal stripe phase.\n", "  This paper presents a new finite element (FE) formulation for liquid shells\nthat is based on an explicit, 3D surface discretization using $C^1$-continuous\nfinite elements constructed from NURBS interpolation. Both displacement-based\nand mixed FE formulations are proposed. The latter is needed for\narea-incompressible material behavior, where penalty-type regularizations can\nlead to misleading results. In order to obtain quasi-static solutions, several\nnumerical stabilization schemes are proposed based on either stiffness,\nviscosity or projection. Several numerical examples are considered in order to\nillustrate the accuracy and the capabilities of the proposed formulation, and\nto compare the different stabilization schemes. The presented formulation is\ncapable of simulating non-trivial surface shapes associated with tube formation\nand protein-induced budding of lipid bilayers. In the latter case, the\npresented formulation yields non-axisymmetric solutions, which have not been\nobserved in previous simulations. It is shown that those non-axisymmetric\nshapes are preferred over axisymmetric ones.\n", "  We construct the six-point NMHV one-loop amplitude in ${\\cal N}=4$\nsupergravity using unitarity and recursion. The use of recursion requires the\nintroduction of rational descendants of the cut-constructible pieces of the\namplitude and the computation of the non-standard factorisation terms arising\nfrom the loop integrals.\n", "  Glycans play a central role as mediators in most biological processes, but\ntheir structures are complicated by isomerism. Epimers and anomers,\nregioisomers, and branched sequences contribute to a structural variability\nthat dwarfs those of nucleic acids and proteins, challenging even the most\nsophisticated analytical tools, such as NMR and mass spectrometry. Here, we\nintroduce an electron tunneling technique that is label-free and can identify\ncarbohydrates at the single-molecule level, offering significant benefits over\nexisting technology. It is capable of analyzing sub-picomole quantities of\nsample, counting the number of individual molecules in each subset in a\npopulation of coexisting isomers, and is quantitative over more than four\norders of magnitude of concentration. It resolves epimers not well separated by\nion-mobility and can be implemented on a silicon chip. It also provides a\nreadout mechanism for direct single-molecule sequencing of linear\noligosaccharides.\n", "  The year 2015 was the International Year of Light. It marked, however, also\nthe 20th anniversary of the first observation of Bose-Einstein condensation in\natomic vapors by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle. This\ndiscovery can be considered as one of the greatest achievements of quantum\noptics that has triggered an avalanche of further seminal discoveries and\nachievements. For this reason we devote this essay for focus issue on \"Quantum\nOptics in the International Year of Light\" to the recent revolutionary\ndevelopments in quantum optics at the frontiers of all physics: atomic physics,\nmolecular physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum\ninformation science. We follow here the lines of the introduction to our book\n\"Ultracold atoms in optical lattices: Simulating quantum many-body systems\"\n[1]. The book, however, was published in 2012, and many things has happened\nsince then -- the present essay is therefore upgraded to include the latest\ndevelopments.\n", "  In the present work we study possible time signatures Axion Dark Matter\nsearches employing resonant cavities for various halo models. We study in\nparticular the time dependence of the resonance width (modulation) and possible\nasymmetries in directional experiments.\n", "  We examine how the properties of dark matter, parameterised by an equation of\nstate parameter $w$ and two perturbative Generalised Dark Matter (GDM)\nparameters $c^2_s$ (the sound speed) and $c^2_\\text{vis}$ (the viscosity), are\nconstrained by existing cosmological data, particularly the Planck 2015 data\nrelease. We find that the GDM parameters are consistent with zero, and are\nstrongly constrained, showing no evidence for extending the dark matter model\nbeyond the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm. The dark matter equation of state\nis constrained to be within $-0.000896<w<0.00238$ at the $99.7\\%$ confidence\nlevel, which is several times stronger than constraints found previously using\nWMAP data. The parameters $c^2_s$ and $c^2_\\text{vis}$ are constrained to be\nless than $3.21\\times10^{-6}$ and $6.06\\times10^{-6}$ respectively at the\n$99.7\\%$ confidence level. The inclusion of the GDM parameters does\nsignificantly affect the error bars on several $\\Lambda$CDM parameters, notably\nthe dimensionless dark matter density $\\omega_g$ and the derived parameters\n$\\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. This can be partially alleviated with the inclusion of\ndata constraining the expansion history of the universe.\n", "  We present the results and methodology of a search for neutrinos produced in\nthe decay of charged pions created in interactions between protons and\ngamma-rays during the prompt emission of 807 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) over the\nentire sky. This three-year search is the first in IceCube for shower-like\nCherenkov light patterns from electron, muon, and tau neutrinos correlated with\nGRBs. We detect five low-significance events correlated with five GRBs. These\nevents are consistent with the background expectation from atmospheric muons\nand neutrinos. The results of this search in combination with those of\nIceCube's four years of searches for track-like Cherenkov light patterns from\nmuon neutrinos correlated with Northern-Hemisphere GRBs produce limits that\ntightly constrain current models of neutrino and ultra high energy cosmic ray\nproduction in GRB fireballs.\n", "  We present a relaxation scheme for approximating the entropy dissipating weak\nsolutions of the Baer-Nunziato two-phase flow model. This relaxation scheme is\nstraightforwardly obtained as an extension of the relaxation scheme designed in\n[16] for the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model and consequently inherits its main\nproperties. To our knowledge, this is the only existing scheme for which the\napproximated phase fractions, phase densities and phase internal energies are\nproven to remain positive without any restrictive condition other than a\nclassical fully computable CFL condition. For ideal gas and stiffened gas\nequations of state, real values of the phasic speeds of sound are also proven\nto be maintained by the numerical scheme. It is also the only scheme for which\na discrete entropy inequality is proven, under a CFL condition derived from the\nnatural sub-characteristic condition associated with the relaxation\napproximation. This last property, which ensures the non-linear stability of\nthe numerical method, is satisfied for any admissible equation of state. We\nprovide a numerical study for the convergence of the approximate solutions\ntowards some exact Riemann solutions. The numerical simulations show that the\nrelaxation scheme compares well with two of the most popular existing schemes\navailable for the Baer-Nunziato model, namely Schwendeman-Wahle-Kapila's\nGodunov-type scheme [39] and Toro-Tokareva's HLLC scheme [42]. The relaxation\nscheme also shows a higher precision and a lower computational cost (for\ncomparable accuracy) than a standard numerical scheme used in the nuclear\nindustry, namely Rusanov's scheme. Finally, we assess the good behavior of the\nscheme when approximating vanishing phase solutions.\n", "  Friction is a complicated phenomenon involving nonlinear dynamics at\ndifferent length and time scales[1, 2]. The microscopic origin of friction is\npoorly understood, due in part to a lack of methods for measuring the force on\na nanometer-scale asperity sliding at velocity of the order of cm/s.[3, 4]\nDespite enormous advance in experimental techniques[5], this combination of\nsmall length scale and high velocity remained illusive. Here we present a\ntechnique for rapidly measuring the frictional forces on a single asperity (an\nAFM tip) over a velocity range from zero to several cm/s. At each image pixel\nwe obtain the velocity dependence of both conservative and dissipative forces,\nrevealing the transition from stick-slip to a smooth sliding friction[1, 6]. We\nexplain measurements on graphite using a modified Prandtl-Tomlinson model that\ntakes into account the damped elastic deformation of the asperity. With its\ngreatly improved force sensitivity and very small sliding amplitude, our method\nenables rapid and detailed surface mapping of the full velocity-dependence of\nfrictional forces with less than 10~nm spatial resolution.\n", "  We study the number and the distribution of low mass Pop III stars in the\nMilky Way. In our numerical model, hierarchical formation of dark matter\nminihalos and Milky Way sized halos are followed by a high resolution\ncosmological simulation. We model the Pop III formation in H2 cooling minihalos\nwithout metal under UV radiation of the Lyman-Werner bands. Assuming a Kroupa\nIMF from 0.15 to 1.0 Msun for low mass Pop III stars, as a working hypothesis,\nwe try to constrain the theoretical models in reverse by current and future\nobservations. We find that the survivors tend to concentrate on the center of\nhalo and subhalos. We also evaluate the observability of Pop III survivors in\nthe Milky Way and dwarf galaxies, and constraints on the number of Pop III\nsurvivors per minihalo. The higher latitude fields require lower sample sizes\nbecause of the high number density of stars in the galactic disk, the required\nsample sizes are comparable in the high and middle latitude fields by\nphotometrically selecting low metallicity stars with optimized narrow band\nfilters, and the required number of dwarf galaxies to find one Pop III survivor\nis less than ten at <100 kpc for the tip of redgiant stars. Provided that\navailable observations have not detected any survivors, the formation models of\nlow mass Pop III stars with more than ten stars per minihalo are already\nexcluded. Furthermore, we discuss the way to constrain the IMF of Pop III star\nat a high mass range of > 10 Msun.\n", "  We will define two ways to assign cohomology groups to effect algebras, which\noccur in the algebraic study of quantum logic. The first way is based on\nConnes' cyclic cohomology. The resulting cohomology groups are related to the\nstate space of the effect algebra, and can be computed using variations on the\nKunneth and Mayer-Vietoris sequences. The second way involves a chain complex\nof ordered abelian groups, and gives rise to a cohomological characterization\nof state extensions on effect algebras. This has applications to no-go theorems\nin quantum foundations, such as Bell's theorem.\n", "  Holography inspired stringy hadrons (HISH) is a set of models that describe\nhadrons: mesons, baryons and glueballs as strings in four dimensional space\ntime. The models are based on a \"map\" from stringy hadrons of holographic\nconfining backgrounds. In this note we review the \"derivation\" of the models.\nWe start with a brief reminder of the passage from the AdS5xS5 string theory to\ncertain flavored confining holographic models. We then describe the string\nconfigurations in holographic backgrounds that correspond to a Wilson line,a\nmeson,a baryon and a glueball. The key ingredients of the four dimensional\npicture of hadrons are the \"string endpoint mass\" and the \"baryonic string\nvertex\". We determine the classical trajectories of the HISH. We review the\ncurrent understanding of the quantization of the hadronic strings. We end with\na summary of the comparison of the outcome of the HISH models with the PDG data\nabout mesons and baryons. We extract the values of the tension, masses and\nintercepts from best fits, write down certain predictions for higher excited\nhadrons and present attempts to identify glueballs\n", "  We develop a purely hydrodynamic formalism to describe collisional,\nanisotropic instabilities in a relativistic plasma, that are usually described\nwith kinetic theory tools. Our main motivation is the fact that coarse-grained\nmodels of high particle number systems give more clear and comprehensive\nphysical descriptions of those systems than purely kinetic approaches, and can\nbe more easily tested experimentally as well as numerically. In particular, we\naim at developing a theory that describes both a background non-equilibrium\nfluid configurations and its perturbations, to be able to account for the\nbackreaction of the latter on the former. Our system of equations includes the\nusual conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and for the electric\ncurrent, and the equations for two new tensors that encode the information\nabout dissipation. To make contact with kinetic theory, we write the different\ntensors as the moments of a non-equilibrium one-particle distribution function\n(1pdf) which, for illustrative purposes, we take in the form of a Grad-like\nansatz. Although this choice limits the applicability of the formalism to\nstates not far from equilibrium, it retains the main features of the underlying\nkinetic theory. We assume the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation, with a\ncollision integral given by the Anderson-Witting prescription, which is more\nsuitable for highly relativistic systems than Marle's (or Bhatnagar, Gross and\nKrook) form, and derive the conservation laws by taking its corresponding\nmoments. We apply our developments to study the emergence of instabilities in\nan anisotropic, but axially symmetric background. For small departures of\nisotropy we find the dispersion relation for normal modes, which admit unstable\nsolutions for a wide range of values of the parameter space.\n", "  We discuss the photon production in the $pA$ collision in a framework of the\ncolor glass condensate (CGC) with expansion in terms of the proton color source\n$\\rho_p$. We work in a regime where the color density $\\rho_A$ of the nucleus\nis large enough to justify the CGC treatment, while soft gluons in the proton\ncould be dominant over quark components but do not yet belong to the CGC\nregime, so that we can still expand the amplitude in powers of $\\rho_p$. The\nzeroth-order contribution to the photon production is known to appear from the\nBremsstrahlung process and the first-order corrections consist of the\nBremsstrahlung diagrams with pair produced quarks and the annihilation diagrams\nof quarks involving a gluon sourced by $\\rho_p$. Because the final states are\ndifferent there is no interference between these two processes. In this work we\nelucidate calculation procedures in details focusing on the annihilation\ndiagrams only. Using the McLerran-Venugopalan model for the color average we\nnumerically calculate the photon production rate and discuss functional forms\nthat fit the numerical results.\n", "  The Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is applied to model the low-temperature\ncrystallographic C$\\alpha$ backbone structure of sperm whale myoglobin. The\nGlauber protocol is employed to simulate its response to an increase in ambient\ntemperature. The myoglobin is found to unfold from its native state by a\nsuccession of $\\alpha$-helical intermediates, fully in line with the observed\nfolding and unfolding patterns in denaturation experiments. In particular, a\nmolten globule intermediate is identified with experimentally correct\nattributes. A detailed, experimentally testable contact map is constructed to\ncharacterise the specifics of the unfolding pathway, including the formation of\nlong range interactions. The results reveal how the unfolding process of a\nprotein is driven by the interplay between, and a successive melting of, its\nmodular secondary structure components.\n", "  We discuss exotic Higgs decays in an effective field theory where the\nStandard Model is extended by dimension-6 operators. We review and update the\nstatus of 2-body lepton- and quark-flavor violating decays involving the Higgs\nboson. We also comment on the possibility of observing 3-body flavor-violating\nHiggs decays in this context.\n", "  A simple model of Bose-Einstein condensation of interacting particles is\nproposed. It is shown that in the condensate state the dependence of\nthermodynamic quantities on the interaction constant does not allow an\nexpansion in powers of the coupling constant. Therefore it is impossible to\npass to the Einstein model of condensation in an ideal Bose gas by means of a\nlimiting passage, setting the interaction constant to zero. The account for the\ninteraction between particles eliminates difficulties in the description of\ncondensation available in the model of an ideal gas, which are connected with\nfulfillment of thermodynamic relations and an infinite value of the particle\nnumber fluctuation in the condensate phase.\n", "  The pseudospin quantum degree of freedom is one of the most remarkable\nproperties of graphene that distinguishes it from ordinary two-dimensional\nmetals and semiconductors. Pseudospin quantum interference leads to weak\nantilocalization (WAL) and is influenced strongly by point defects and thermal\nperturbations that break chirality and destroy phase coherence. Preserving and\nmanipulating quantum transport properties up to room temperature is key to\nrealizing practical pseudospin-based graphene devices. Here we report\nfabrication and transport characterization of graphene field-effect devices on\na complex-oxide heterostructure, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Signatures of WAL, a\nconsequence of pseudospin quantum interference, persist up to room temperature.\nThe LaAlO3/SrTiO3 substrate plays a critical role in suppressing short-range\nimpurity scattering and electron-phonon coupling. The observation of quantum\ntransport signatures at room temperature is unique to this system and presents\nnew opportunities for the development of pseudospin-based devices and novel\nmultifunctional devices that couple to the complex-oxide interface.\n", "  The invariance of several structural and dynamical properties of the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) system along the freezing and melting lines is interpreted\nin terms of the isomorph theory. First the freezing/melting lines for LJ system\nare shown to be approximated by isomorphs. Then we show that the invariants\nobserved along the freezing and melting isomorphs are also observed on other\nisomorphs in the liquid and crystalline phase. Structure is probed by the\nradial distribution function and the structure factor and dynamics is probed by\nthe mean-square displacement, the intermediate scattering function, and the\nshear viscosity. Studying these properties by reference to the isomorph theory\nexplains why known single-phase melting criteria holds, e.g., the Hansen-Verlet\nand the Lindemann criterion, and why the Andrade equation for the viscosity at\nfreezing applies, e.g., for most liquid metals. Our conclusion is that these\nempirical rules and invariants can all be understood from the isomorph theory\nand that the invariants are not peculiar to the freezing and melting lines, but\nhold along all isomorphs.\n", "  I propose a two component analytic formula $F(s,t)=F^{(1)}(s,t)+F^{(2)}(s,t)$\nfor $(ab\\rightarrow ab) +(a\\bar{b}\\rightarrow a\\bar{b})$ scattering at energies\n$\\ge 100 GeV$ ,where $s,t$ denote squares of c.m. energy and momentum\ntransfer.It saturates the Froissart-Martin bound and obeys\nAuberson-Kinoshita-Martin (AKM) \\cite{AKM1971} scaling. I choose $Im\nF^{(1)}(s,0)+Im F^{(2)}(s,0)$ as given by Particle Data Group (PDG) fits to\ntotal cross sections. The PDG formula is extended to non-zero momentum\ntransfers using partial waves of $Im F^{(1)}$ and $Im F^{(2)}$ motivated by\nPomeron pole and 'grey disk' amplitudes . $Re F(s,t)$ is deduced from real\nanalyticity: I prove that $Re F(s,t)/ImF(s,0) \\rightarrow (\\pi/\\ln{s}) d/d\\tau\n(\\tau Im F(s,t)/ImF(s,0) )$ for $s\\rightarrow \\infty$ with $\\tau=t (ln s)^2$\nfixed, and apply it to $F^{(2)}$.Using also the forward slope fit by\nSchegelsky-Ryskin , the model gives real parts,differential cross sections for\n$(-t)<.3 GeV^2$, and inelastic cross sections in good agreement with data at\n$546 GeV, 1.8 TeV,7 TeV$ and $ 8 TeV $. It predicts for inelastic cross\nsections for $pp$ or $\\bar{p} p$, $\\sigma_{inel}=72.7\\pm 1.0 mb$ at $7TeV$ and\n$74.2 \\pm 1.0mb$ at $8 TeV$ in agreement with $pp$ Totem experimental values\n$73.1\\pm 1.3 mb $ and $74.7\\pm 1.7 mb$ respectively, and with Atlas values\n$71.3\\pm 0.9 mb$ and $71.7\\pm 0.7mb$ respectively. The predictions at $546 GeV$\nand $1800 GeV$ also agree with $\\bar{p} p$ experimental results of Abe et al\n\\cite{Abe} at $546 GeV$ and $1800 GeV$.\n  The model yields for $\\sqrt{s}> 0.5 TeV$, with PDG2013 total cross sections ,\nand Schegelsky-Ryskin slopes as input, $\\sigma_{inel} (s) =22.6 + .034 ln s +\n.158 (ln s)^2 mb , and \\sigma_{inel} / \\sigma_{tot} \\rightarrow 0.56,\ns\\rightarrow \\infty ,$ where $s$ is in $GeV^2$\n", "  We have reanalyzed reaction cross sections of 16N on 12C target. The nucleon\ndensity distribution of 16N, especially surface density distribution, was\nextracted using the modified Glauber model. On the basis of dilute surface\ndensities, the discussion of 15N(n, {\\gamma})16N reaction was performed within\nthe framework of the direct capture reaction mechanism. The calculations agreed\nquite well with the experimental data.\n", "  The threshold dynamics method developed by Merriman, Bence and Osher (MBO) is\nan efficient method for simulating the motion by mean curvature flow when the\ninterface is away from the solid boundary. Direct generalization of MBO-type\nmethods to the wetting problem with interfaces intersecting the solid boundary\nis not easy because solving the heat equation in a general domain with a\nwetting boundary condition is not as efficient as it is with the original MBO\nmethod. The dynamics of the contact point also follows a different law compared\nwith the dynamics of the interface away from the boundary. In this paper, we\ndevelop an efficient volume preserving threshold dynamics method for simulating\nwetting on rough surfaces. This method is based on minimization of the weighted\nsurface area functional over an extended domain that includes the solid phase.\nThe method is simple, stable with $O(N \\log N)$ complexity per time step and is\nnot sensitive to the inhomogeneity or roughness of the solid boundary.\n", "  The stabilizer ZX-calculus is a rigorous graphical language for reasoning\nabout quantum mechanics.The language is sound and complete: a stabilizer\nZX-diagram can be transformed into another one if and only if these two\ndiagrams represent the same quantum evolution or quantum state. We show that\nthe stabilizer ZX-calculus can be simplified, removing unnecessary equations\nwhile keeping only the essential axioms which potentially capture fundamental\nstructures of quantum mechanics. We thus give a significantly smaller set of\naxioms and prove that meta-rules like 'colour symmetry' and 'upside-down\nsymmetry', which were considered as axioms in previous versions of the\nlanguage, can in fact be derived. In particular, we show that the additional\nsymbol and one of the rules which had been recently introduced to keep track of\nscalars (diagrams with no inputs or outputs) are not necessary.\n", "  One of the most important problems in complex networks is how to detect\nmetadata groups accurately. The main challenge lies in the fact that\ntraditional structural communities do not always capture the intrinsic features\nof metadata groups. Motivated by the observation that metadata groups in PPI\nnetworks tend to consist of an abundance of interacting triad motifs, we define\na 2-club substructure with diameter 2 which possessing triad-rich property to\ndescribe a metadata group. Based on the triad-rich substructure, we design a\nDIVision Algorithm using our proposed edge Niche Centrality DIVANC to detect\nmetadata groups effectively in complex networks. We also extend DIVANC to\ndetect overlapping metadata groups by proposing a simple 2-hop overlapping\nstrategy. To verify the effectiveness of triad-rich substructures, we compare\nDIVANC with existing algorithms on PPI networks, LFR synthetic networks and\nfootball networks. The experimental results show that DIVANC outperforms most\nother algorithms significantly and, in particular, can detect sparse metadata\ngroups.\n", "  We present a novel platform for the large-scale simulation of fibrous\nstructures immersed in a Stokesian fluid and evolving under confinement or in\nfree-space. One of the main motivations for this work is to study the dynamics\nof fiber assemblies within biological cells. For this, we also incorporate the\nkey biophysical elements that determine the dynamics of these assemblies, which\ninclude the polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of fibers, their\ninteractions with molecular motors and other objects, their flexibility, and\nhydrodynamic coupling.\n  This work, to our knowledge, is the first technique to include many-body\nhydrodynamic interactions (HIs), and the resulting fluid flows, in cellular\nfiber assemblies. We use the non-local slender body theory to compute the\nfluid-structure interactions of the fibers and a second-kind boundary integral\nformulation for other rigid bodies and the confining boundary. A\nkernel-independent implementation of the fast multiple method is utilized for\nefficient evaluation of HIs. The deformation of the fibers is described by the\nnonlinear Euler--Bernoulli beam theory and their polymerization is modeled by\nthe reparametrization of the dynamic equations in the appropriate\nnon-Lagrangian frame. We use a pseudo-spectral representation of fiber\npositions and implicit HIs in the time-stepping to resolve large fiber\ndeformations, and to allow time-steps not constrained by temporal stiffness or\nfiber-fiber interactions. The entire computational scheme is parallelized,\nwhich enables simulating assemblies of thousands of fibers. We use our method\nto investigate two important questions in the mechanics of cell division: (i)\nthe effect of confinement on the hydrodynamic mobility of microtubule asters;\nand (ii) the dynamics of the positioning of mitotic spindle in complex cell\ngeometries.\n", "  Employing theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate discontinuous\nforce thinning due to the motion of an external probe in a host medium, which\nwe approximate as structureless. When the driving of the probe exceeds a\ncritical force, the microviscosity of the medium drops abruptly by about an\norder of magnitude. This phenomenon occurs for strong attractive interactions\nbetween probe and a sufficiently dense host medium.\n", "  We study the collective dynamics of repulsive self-propelled particles. The\nparticles are governed by coupled equations of motion that include polar\nself-propulsion, damping of velocity and of polarity, repulsive\nparticle-particle interaction, and deterministic dynamics. Particle dynamics\nsimulations show that the collective coherent motion with large density\nfluctuations spontaneously emerges from a disordered, isotropic state. In the\nparameter region where the rotational damping of polarity is strong, the\nsystems undergoes an abrupt shift to the absorbing ordered state after a\nwaiting period in the metastable disordered state. In order to obtain a simple\nunderstanding of the mechanism underlying the collective behavior, we analyze\nbinary particle scattering process. We show that this approach correctly\npredicts the order-disorder transition at dilute limit. The same approach is\nexpanded for finite densities, although it disagrees with the result from\nmany-particle simulations due to many-body correlations and density\nfluctuations.\n", "  We point out that, in the context of the SM, $|V^2_{13}| + | V^2_{23}|$ is\nexpected to be large, of order one. The fact that $|V^2_{13}| + |V^2_{23}|\n\\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ motivates the introduction of a symmetry S which\nleads to $V_{CKM} ={1\\>\\!\\!\\!\\mathrm{I}} $, with only the third generation of\nquarks acquiring mass. We consider two scenarios for generating the mass of the\nfirst two quark generations and full quark mixing. One consists of the\nintroduction of a second Higgs doublet which is neutral under S. The second\nscenario consists of assuming New Physics at a high energy scale , contributing\nto the masses of light quark generations, in an effective field theory\napproach. This last scenario leads to couplings of the Higgs particle to\n$s\\overline s$ and $c \\overline c$ which are significantly enhanced with\nrespect to those of the SM. In both schemes, one has scalar-mediated flavour-\nchanging neutral currents which are naturally suppressed. Flavour violating top\ndecays are predicted in the second scenario at the level $ \\mbox{Br} (t\n\\rightarrow h c ) \\geq 5\\times 10^{-5}$.\n", "  The 'Discussion & Debate' issue of this Euro. Phys. J. Special Topic volume\nis: 'Can economics be a Physical Science?' I would rather address a more\ngeneral question: 'Can economics or sociology avoid joining Natural Science?'\nand argue that mainstream or core economics or sociology can not escape joining\nnatural science.\n", "  Progress in understanding the coupling between plasma instabilities in the\nequatorial electrojet based on a unified fluid model is reported. A deeper\nunderstanding of the linear and nonlinear evolution and the coupling of the\ngradient-drift and Farley-Buneman instabilities is achieved by studying the\neffect of different combinations of the density-gradient scale-lengths (Ln) and\ncross-field (E?B) drifts on the plasma turbulence. Mechanisms and channels of\nenergy transfer are illucidated for these multiscale instabilities. Energy for\nthe unified model is examined, including the injected, conservative\nredistribution (between fields and scales), and ultimate dissipation. Various\nphysical mechanisms involved in the energetics are categorized as sources,\nsinks, nonlinear transfer, and coupling to show that the system satisfies the\nfundamental law of energy Oonservation. The physics of the nonlinear transfer\nterms is studied to identify their roles in producing energy cascades { the\ntransference of energy from the dominant unstable wavenumbers and driving\nirregularities of different scale-lengths. The theory of two-step energy\ncascading to generate the 3-meter plasma irregularities in the equatorial\nelectrojet is verified. In addition, the nonlinearity of the system allows the\npossibility for a reverse energy cascading, responsible for generating\nlarge-scale plasma structures at the top of the electrojet.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is a canonical example of\nelectron-electron interactions producing new ground states in many-body\nsystems. Most FQH studies have focused on the lowest Landau level (LL), whose\nfractional states are successfully explained by the composite fermion (CF)\nmodel, in which an even number of magnetic flux quanta are attached to an\nelectron and where states form the sequence of filling factors $\\nu = p/(2mp\n\\pm 1)$, with $m$ and $p$ positive integers. In the widely-studied GaAs-based\nsystem, the CF picture is thought to become unstable for the $N \\geq 2$ LL,\nwhere larger residual interactions between CFs are predicted and competing\nmany-body phases have been observed. Here we report transport measurements of\nFQH states in the $N=2$ LL (filling factors $4 < \\nu < 8$) in bilayer graphene,\na system with spin and valley degrees of freedom in all LLs, and an additional\norbital degeneracy in the 8-fold degenerate $N=0$/$N=1$ LLs. In contrast with\nrecent observations of particle-hole asymmetry in the $N=0$/$N=1$ LLs of\nbilayer graphene, the FQH states we observe in the $N=2$ LL are consistent with\nthe CF model: within a LL, they form a complete sequence of particle-hole\nsymmetric states whose relative strength is dependent on their denominators.\nThe FQH states in the $N=2$ LL display energy gaps of a few Kelvin, comparable\nto and in some cases larger than those of fractional states in the $N=0$/$N=1$\nLLs. The FQH states we observe form, to the best of our knowledge, the highest\nset of particle-hole symmetric pairs seen in any material system.\n", "  In this paper, we study the evolution of a vortex filament in an\nincompressible ideal fluid. Under the assumption that the vorticity is\nconcentrated along a smooth curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we prove that the curve\nevolves to leading order by binormal curvature flow. Our approach combines new\nestimates on the distance of the corresponding Hamiltonian-Possion structures\nwith stability estimates recently developed in Ref. 15.\n", "  We study the Langevin dynamics of the adaptive immune system, modelled by a\nlymphocyte network in which the B cells are interacting with the T cells and\nantigen. We assume that B clones and T clones are evolving in different thermal\nnoise environments and on different timescales. We derive stationary\ndistributions and use statistical mechanics to study clonal expansion of B\nclones in this model when the B and T clone sizes are assumed to be the slow\nand fast variables respectively and vice versa. We derive distributions of B\nclone sizes and use general properties of ferromagnetic systems to predict\ncharacteristics of these distributions, such as the average B cell\nconcentration, in some regimes where T cells can be modelled as binary\nvariables. This analysis is independent of network topologies and its results\nare qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. In order to obtain\nfull distributions we assume that the network topologies are random and locally\nequivalent to trees. The latter allows us to employ the Bethe-Peierls approach\nand to develop a theoretical framework which can be used to predict the\ndistributions of B clone sizes. As an example we use this theory to compute\ndistributions for the models of immune system defined on random regular\nnetworks.\n", "  We discuss the dynamical D$p$-brane solutions describing any number of\nD$p$-branes whose relative orientations are given by certain SU(2) rotations.\nThese are the generalization of the static angled D$p$-brane solutions. We\nstudy the collision of dynamical D3-brane with angles in type II string theory,\nand show that the particular orientation of the smeared D3-brane configuration\ncan provide an example of colliding branes if they have the same charges.\nOtherwise a singularity appears before D3-branes collide.\n", "  It is possible to reproduce the quantum features of quantum states, starting\nfrom a classical statistical theory and then limiting the amount of knowledge\nthat an agent can have about an individual system [5, 18].These are so called\nepistemic restrictions. Such restrictions have been recently formulated in\nterms of the symplectic geometry of the corresponding classical theory [19].\nThe purpose of this note is to describe, using this symplectic framework, how\nto obtain a C*-algebraic formulation for the epistemically restricted theories.\nIn the case of continuous variables, following the groupoid quantization recipe\nof E. Hawkins, we obtain a twisted group C*-algebra which is the usual Moyal\nquantization of a Poisson vector space [12].\n", "  Theoretical studies on the early-time dynamics in the ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions are reviewed including pedagogical introductions on the\ninitial condition with small-x gluons treated as a color glass condensate, the\nbottom-up thermalization scenario, plasma/glasma instabilities, basics of some\nformulations such as the kinetic equations and the classical statistical\nsimulation. More detailed discussions follow to make an overview of recent\ndevelopments on the fast isotropization, the onset of hydrodynamics, and the\ntransient behavior of momentum spectral cascades.\n", "  We consider dynamics of a flat anisotropic Universe filled by a perfect fluid\nnear a cosmological singularity in quadratic gravity. Two possible regimes are\ndescribed -- the Kasner anisotropic solution and an isotropic \"vacuum\nradiation\" solution which has three sub cases depending on whether the equation\nof state parameter $w$ is bigger, smaller or equals to $1/3$. Initial\nconditions for numerical integrations have been chosen near General Relativity\nanisotropic solution with matter (Jacobs solution). We have found that for such\ninitial conditions there is a range of values of coupling constants so that the\nresulting cosmological singularity is isotropic.\n", "  The gravitationally-lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 is one of the most distant\nspectroscopically confirmed sources ($z=7.5$). It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of\nA1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components\nwith sizes about $0.4-1.7$\\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial\nmorphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\\it HST}\nand points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger\nor a disc in early formation. The ALMA photometry is used to constrain the\nfar-infrared spectral energy distribution, yielding a dust temperature ($T_{\\rm\ndust} \\sim 35$--$45$\\,K for $\\beta = 1.5-2$). We do not detect the CO(3-2) line\nin the GBT data with a 95\\% upper limit of 0.3\\,mJy observed. We find a slight\nexcess emission in ALMA band~6 at 220.9\\,GHz. If this excess is real, it is\nlikely due to emission from the [CII] 158.8\\,$\\mu$m line at $z_{\\rm [CII]} =\n7.603$. The stringent upper limits on the [CII]/$L_{\\rm FIR}$ luminosity ratio\nsuggest a [CII] deficit similar to several bright quasars and massive\nstarbursts.\n", "  As the first component of SPARC (Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space\nCalculations), we present an accurate and efficient finite-difference\nformulation and parallel implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for\nisolated clusters. Specifically, utilizing a local reformulation of the\nelectrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field\niteration, and a reformulation of the non-local component of the force, we\ndevelop a framework using the finite-difference representation that enables the\nefficient evaluation of energies and atomic forces to within the desired\naccuracies in DFT. Through selected examples consisting of a variety of\nelements, we demonstrate that SPARC obtains exponential convergence in energy\nand forces with domain size; systematic convergence in the energy and forces\nwith mesh-size to reference plane-wave result at comparably high rates; forces\nthat are consistent with the energy, both free from any noticeable `egg-box'\neffect; and accurate ground-state properties including equilibrium geometries\nand vibrational spectra. In addition, for systems consisting up to thousands of\nelectrons, SPARC displays weak and strong parallel scaling behavior that is\nsimilar to well-established and optimized plane-wave implementations, but with\na significantly reduced prefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive\nalternative to plane-wave codes for practical DFT simulations of isolated\nclusters.\n", "  We introduce a generalization of conventional lattice gauge theory to\ndescribe fracton topological phases, which are characterized by immobile,\npoint-like topological excitations, and sub-extensive topological degeneracy.\nWe demonstrate a duality between fracton topological order and interacting spin\nsystems with symmetries along extensive, lower-dimensional subsystems, which\nmay be used to systematically search for and characterize fracton topological\nphases. Commutative algebra and elementary algebraic geometry provide an\neffective mathematical toolset for our results. Our work paves the way for\nidentifying possible material realizations of fracton topological phases.\n", "  Recent studies have revealed that the symmetry of interparticle potential\nplays an important role in one-dimensional heat conduction problem. Here we\ndemonstrate that by stretching or compressing the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-\\b{eta}\nlattice, one can control the symmetry of the potential, and thus manipulate the\ndecaying behavior of the heat current autocorrelation function (HCAF). In fact,\nstretching or compressing induces a fast decaying stage (FDS) during which the\nHCAF decays faster than power-law manners or in a power law manner but faster\nthan ~t -1. The time range as well as the decay amplitude of the HCAF over the\nFDS increase as the stretching or compressing ratio increase, or as the\ntemperature decreases. As a consequence, the thermal conductivity calculated\nfollowing the Green-Kubo formula shows a truncation-time independent window,\nimplying a system-size independent conductivity. Stretching or compressing also\nchanges the exponent of the power-law tail of the HCAF. The complicated heat\nconduction behavior induced by stretching or compressing can be connected to\nthe change of the symmetry of the interparticle potential.\n", "  We consider a gravitating system consisting of a scalar field minimally\ncoupled to gravity with a self-interacting potential and a U(1) nonlinear\nelectromagnetic field. Solving analytically and numerically the coupled system\nfor both power-law and Born-Infeld type electrodynamics, we find charged hairy\nblack hole solutions. Then, we study the thermodynamics of these solutions and\nwe find that at a low temperature the topological charged black hole with\nscalar hair is thermodynamically preferred, whereas the topological charged\nblack hole without scalar hair is thermodynamically preferred at a high\ntemperature for power-law electrodynamics. Interestingly enough, these phase\ntransitions occur at a fixed critical temperature and do not depend on the\nexponent $p$ of the nonlinearity electrodynamics.\n", "  The spectral function of the $\\Lambda$ hyperon in finite nuclei is calculated\nfrom the corresponding $\\Lambda$ self-energy, which is constructed within a\nperturbative many-body approach using some of the hyperon-nucleon interactions\nof the J\\\"{u}lich and Nijmegen groups. Binding energies, wave functions and\ndisoccupation numbers of different single-particle states are obtained for\nvarious hypernuclei from $^5_{\\Lambda}$He to $^{209}_{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\Lambda}$Pb.\nThe agreement between the calculated binding energies and experimental data is\nqualitatively good. The small spin-orbit splitting of the $p-, d-, f-$ and\n$g-$wave states is confirmed. The discrete and the continuum contributions of\nthe single-$\\Lambda$ spectral function are computed. Their appearance is\nqualitatively similar to that of the nucleons. The $Z$-factor, that measures\nthe importance of correlations, is also calculated. Our results show that its\nvalue is relatively large, indicating that the $\\Lambda$ hyperon is less\ncorrelated than nucleons. This is in agreement with the results obtained by\nother authors for the correlations of the $\\Lambda$ in infinite nuclear matter.\nThe disoccupation numbers are obtained by integrating the spectral function\nover the energy. Our results show that the discrete contribution to the\ndisoccupation number decreases when increasing the momentum of the $\\Lambda$.\nThis indicates that, in the production reactions of hypernuclei, the $\\Lambda$\nhyperon is mostly formed in a quasi-free state.\n", "  We make use of the Open Quantum Random Walk setting due to S. Attal, F.\nPetruccione, C. Sabot and I. Sinayskiy [J. Stat. Phys. (2012) 147:832-852] in\norder to discuss hitting times and a quantum version of the Mean Hitting Time\nFormula from classical probability theory. We study an open quantum notion of\nhitting probability on a finite collection of sites and with this we are able\nto describe the problem in terms of linear maps and its matrix representations.\nAfter setting an open quantum version of the fundamental matrix for ergodic\nMarkov chains we are able to prove our main result and as consequence a version\nof the Random Target Lemma. We also study a mean hitting time formula in terms\nof the minimal polynomial associated to the matrix representation of the\nquantum walk. We discuss applications of the results to open quantum dynamics\non graphs together with open questions.\n", "  We develop and thoroughly test a stress-controlled, parallel plates shear\ncell that can be coupled to an optical microscope or a small angle light\nscattering setup, for simultaneous investigation of the rheological properties\nand the microscopic structure of soft materials under an imposed shear stress.\nIn order to minimize friction, the cell is based on an air bearing linear\nstage, the stress is applied through a contactless magnetic actuator, and the\nstrain is measured through optical sensors. We discuss the contributions of\ninertia and of the small residual friction to the measured signal and\ndemonstrate the performance of our device in both oscillating and step stress\nexperiments on a variety of viscoelastic materials.\n", "  In order to improve the quality and stability of synchrotron light, Hefei\nLight Source has a major upgrade. Higher accuracy is necessary for installation\nand alignment of the storage ring magnets. It is not necessarily essential that\nthe magnets are positioned exactly. In fact, the aim is to adjust neighboring\nmagnets with a high accuracy to one another; in other words, these neighboring\nmagnets are positioned on a smoothing curve. The paper presents an attempt to\ndevelop a reliable smoothing method based on curve fitting of least squares and\niteration according to the structure characteristics of HLSII. The method\nsignificantly reduces the adjusting amount and range of the storage ring\nmagnets. It improves productivity by a factor of one times.\n", "  We derive an exact, simple relation between the average number of clusters\nand the wrapping probabilities for two-dimensional percolation. The relation\nholds for periodic lattices of any size. It generalizes a classical result of\nSykes and Essam and it can be used to find exact or very accurate\napproximations of the critical density. The criterion that follows is related\nto the criterion Scullard and Jacobsen use to find precise approximate\nthresholds, and our work provides a new perspective on their approach.\n", "  Free electrons can screen out long-range Coulomb interaction and destroy the\npolar distortion in some ferroelectric materials, whereas the coexistence of\npolar distortion and metallicity were found in several non-central-symmetric\nmetals (NCSMs). Therefore, the mechanisms and designing of NCSMs have attracted\ngreat interests. In this work, by first-principles calculation, we found the\npolar distortion in the lone-pair driven ferroelectric material PbTiO$_3$ can\nnot only persist, but also increase with electron doping. We further analyzed\nthe mechanisms of the persisting of the polar distortion. We found that the Ti\nsite polar instability is suppressed but the Pb site polar instability is\nintact with the electron doping. The Pb-site instability is due to the\nlone-pair mechanism which can be viewed as a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect, a mix\nof the ground state and the excited state by ion displacement from the central\nsymmetric position. The lone-pair mechanism is not strongly affected by the\nelectron doping because neither the ground state or the excited state involved\nis at the Fermi energy. The enhancement of the polar distortion is related to\nthe increasing of the Ti ion size by doping. These results show the lone-pair\nstereoactive ions can be used in designing NCSMs.\n", "  Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical\nobject. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a\nmeasurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need\nto forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting\nthe detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased\nforecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned\non a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code,\nForecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties\nand the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By\nconditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars,\nForecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for\nobjects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally\nperformed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds,\nNeptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf\nplanets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely\nhigh-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius\nrelation at $2.0_{-0.6}^{+0.7} M_\\oplus$, which we associate with the divide\nbetween solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis\nadds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent\na narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively,\nthen, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.\n", "  We give a tight scheme for teleporting a quantum state between two parties\nwhose reference frames are misaligned by an action of a finite symmetry group.\nUnlike previously proposed schemes, ours requires no additional tokens or data\nto be passed between the participants; the same amount of classical information\nis transferred as for ordinary quantum teleportation, and the Hilbert space of\nthe entangled resource is of the same size. In the terminology of Peres and\nScudo, our protocol relies on classical communication of unspeakable\ninformation.\n", "  We give further evidence that genus-one fibers with multi-sections are mirror\ndual to fibers with Mordell-Weil torsion. In the physics of F-theory\ncompactifications this implies a relation between models with a non-simply\nconnected gauge group and those with discrete symmetries. We provide a\ncombinatorial explanation of this phenomenon for toric hypersurfaces. In\nparticular this leads to a criterion to deduce Mordell-Weil torsion directly\nfrom the polytope. For all 3134 complete intersection genus-one curves in\nthree-dimensional toric ambient spaces we confirm the conjecture by explicit\ncalculation. We comment on several new features of these models: The\nWeierstrass forms of many models can be identified by relabeling the\ncoefficient sections. This reduces the number of models to 1024 inequivalent\nones. We give an example of a fiber which contains only non-toric sections one\nof which becomes toric when the fiber is realized in a different ambient space.\nSimilarly a singularity in codimension one can have a toric resolution in one\nrepresentation while it is non-toric in another. Finally we give a list of 24\ninequivalent genus-one fibers that simultaneously exhibit multi-sections and\nMordell-Weil torsion in the Jacobian. We discuss a self-mirror example from\nthis list in detail.\n", "  We develop a theoretical background to treat exciton states of semiconductor\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in presence of a periodic potential\ninduced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagating along semiconducting\nSWCNT. The formalism naturally accounts for the electronic bands splitting into\nthe Floquet sub-bands brought about by the Bragg scattering on the SAW\npotential. Optically induced transitions within the Floquet states and\nformation of correlated electron-hole pairs, i.e., exciton states, are examined\nnumerically. We discuss dynamical formation of new van Hove singularities\nwithin electron-hole continuum and associated reduction of the exciton\noscillator strengths and its effect on the photoluminescence quenching in\npresence of the SAW. We argue that SAW induced dynamical gaps in the single\nparticle dispersion leads to redistribution of the oscillator strength from\nexcitons to the Floquet edge states. The simulations also confirm exciton\nenergy Stark red shift as well as reduction in the binding energy. Comparison\nof our results with previous theoretical and experimental studies is provided.\n", "  We construct a differential calculus over the noncommutative 4-sphere in the\nframework of pseudo-Riemannian calculi, and show that for every metric in a\nconformal class of perturbations of the round metric, there exists a unique\nmetric and torsion-free connection. Furthermore, we find a localization of the\nprojective module corresponding to the space of vector fields, which allows us\nto formulate a Gauss-Chern-Bonnet type theorem for the noncommutative 4-sphere.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a band-inverted, topological semimetal in\ntwo-dimensional nonsymmorphic crystals. This notion is materialized in the\nmonolayers of MTe$_2$ (M $=$ W, Mo) if spin-orbit coupling is neglected. We\ncharacterize the Dirac band touching topologically by the Wilson loop of the\nnon-Abelian Berry gauge field. An additional feature of the Dirac cone in\nmonolayer MTe$_2$ is that it tilts over in a Lifshitz transition to produce\nelectron and hole pockets, a type-II Dirac cone. These pockets, together with\nthe pseudospin structure of the Dirac electrons, suggest a unified, topological\nexplanation for the recently-reported, non-saturating magnetoresistance in\nWTe$_2$, as well as its circular dichroism in photoemission. We complement our\nanalysis and first-principle bandstructure calculations with an\n$\\textit{ab-initio}$-derived-derived tight-binding model for the WTe$_2$\nmonolayer.\n", "  Lorentz symmetry violations can be described by an effective field theory\nframework that contains both General Relativity and the Standard Model of\nparticle physics called the Standard-Model extension (SME). Recently, post-fit\nanalysis of Gravity Probe B and binary pulsars lead to an upper limit at the\n$10^{-4}$ level on the time-time coefficient $\\bar s^{TT}$ of the pure-gravity\nsector of the minimal SME. In this work, we derive the observable of Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) in SME and then we implement it into a real data\nanalysis code of geodetic VLBI observations. Analyzing all available\nobservations recorded since 1979, we compare estimates of $\\bar s^{TT}$ and\nerrors obtained with various analysis schemes, including global estimations\nover several time spans and with various Sun elongation cut-off angles, and\nwith analysis of radio source coordinate time series. We obtain a constraint on\n$\\bar s^{TT}=(-5\\pm 8)\\times 10^{-5}$, directly fitted to the observations and\nimproving by a factor 5 previous post-fit analysis estimates.\n", "  A new parallel, computationally efficient immersed boundary method for\nsolving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains\nis presented. Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the\ninterpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta\nfunction approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike\nPeskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are\nused to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are\nsolved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function\ntechniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural\nfree-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive\ngrid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting\noperations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the\nimmersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical\ndiscrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with\nspecialized half-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently\nsolve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum\nequation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems\nof equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved\nusing an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic\nproperties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to\nsimple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are\ncompatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference\nequations. Numerical experiments on low-aspect-ratio flat plates and spheres at\nReynolds numbers up to 3,700 are used to verify the accuracy and physical\nfidelity of the formulation.\n", "  The continuous time random walk model plays an important role in modeling of\nso called anomalous diffusion behaviour. One of the specific property of such\nmodel are constant time periods visible in trajectory. In the continuous time\nrandom walk approach they are realizations of the sequence called waiting\ntimes. The main attention of the paper is paid on the analysis of waiting times\ndistribution. We introduce here novel methods of estimation and statistical\ninvestigation of such distribution. The methods are based on the modified\ncumulative distribution function. In this paper we consider three special cases\nof waiting time distributions, namely $\\alpha$-stable, tempered stable and\ngamma. However the proposed methodology can be applied to broad set of\ndistributions - in general it may serve as a method of fitting any distribution\nfunction if the observations are rounded. The new statistical techniques we\napply to the simulated data as well as to the real data describing $CO_2$\nconcentration in indoor air.\n", "  The interaction of a short, few-cycle light pulse and an atom which is\nprepared initially in a superposition of two stationary states is shown to\nexhibit strong signatures of atomic coherence. For a given waveform of the\nlaser pulse, appropriate quantum mechanical relative phase between the\nconstituents of the initial superposition can increase the ionization\nprobability by a factor of three. A similarly strong effect can be observed\nwhen the waveform of the ionizing pulse is changed. These results allow for\nintuitive explanations, which are in agreement with the numerical integration\nof the time dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  The study of PT-symmetric physical systems began in 1998 as a complex\ngeneralization of conventional quantum mechanics, but beginning in 2007\nexperiments began to be published in which the predicted PT phase transition\nwas clearly observed in classical rather than in quantum-mechanical systems.\nThis paper examines the PT phase transition in mathematical models of\nantigen-antibody systems. A surprising conclusion that can be drawn from these\nmodels is that a possible way to treat a serious disease in which the antigen\nconcentration is growing out of bounds (and the host will die) is to inject a\nsmall dose of a second (different) antigen. In this case there are two possible\nfavorable outcomes. In the unbroken-PT-symmetric phase the disease becomes\nchronic and is no longer lethal while in the appropriate broken-PT-symmetric\nphase the concentration of lethal antigen goes to zero and the disease is\ncompletely cured.\n", "  In this paper we explore the different mechanisms that affect the thermopower\nof a band insulating perovskite (in this case, SrTiO$_3$) when subject to\nstrain (both compressive or tensile). We analyze the high temperature, entropy\ndominated limit and the lower temperature, energy-transport regime. We observe\nthat the effect of strain in the high-temperature Seebeck coefficient is small\nat the concentration levels of interest for thermoelectric applications.\nHowever, the effective mass changes substantially with strain, which produces\nan opposite effect to that of the degeneracy-breakups produced by strain. In\nparticular, we find that the thermopower can be enhanced by applying tensile\nstrain in the adequate regime. We conclude that the detrimental effect of\nstrain in thermopower due to band splitting is a minor effect that will not\nhamper the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of oxides with\nt$_{2g}$-active bands by applying strain.\n", "  With advances in accelerator science and technology in the recent decades,\nthe accelerator community has focused on the development of next-generation\nlight sources, for example the diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs), which\nrequires precision control of the electron beam energy and betatron tunes. This\nwork is aimed at understanding magnet hysteresis effects on the electron beam\nenergy and lattice focusing in the circular accelerators, and developing new\nmethods to gain better control of these effects. In this paper, we will report\nour recent experimental study of the magnetic hysteresis effects and their\nimpacts on the Duke storage ring lattice using the transverse feedback based\nprecision tune measurement system. The major magnet hysteresis effects\nassociated with magnet normalization and lattice ramping are carefully studied\nto determine an effective procedure for lattice preparation while maintaining a\nhigh degree of reproducibility of lattice focusing. The local hysteresis\neffects are also studied by measuring the betatron tune shifts resulted from\nadjusting the setting of a quadrupole. A new technique has been developed to\nprecisely recover the focusing strength of the quadrupole by returning it to a\nproper setting to overcome the local hysteresis effect.\n", "  For a particle moves on a 2D surface f(x)=0 embedded in 3D Euclidean space,\nthe geometric momentum and potential are simultaneously admissible within the\nDirac canonical quantization scheme for constrained motion. In our approach,\nnot the full scheme but the symmetries indicated by classical brackets\n[x,H]_{D} and [p,H]_{D} in addition to the fundamental ones [x,x]_{D},\n[x,p]_{D} and [p,p]_{D} are utilized, where the subscript D stands for the\nDirac bracket. The generalized centripetal force law p=[p,H]_{D} for particle\non the 2D surface play the key role, and there is no simple relationship\nbetween the force on a point of the surface and its curvatures of the point, in\nsharp contrast to the motion on a curve.\n", "  We study the propagation of Rydberg slow light polaritons through an atomic\nmedium for intermediate interactions. Then, the dispersion relation for the\npolaritons is well described by the slow light velocity alone, which allows for\nan analytical solution for arbitrary shape of the atomic cloud. We demonstrate\nthe connection of Rydberg polaritons to the behavior of a conventional Kerr\nnonlinearity for weak interactions, and determine the leading quantum\ncorrections for increasing interactions. We propose an experimental setup which\nallows one to measure the effective two-body interaction potential between slow\nlight polaritons as well as higher body interactions.\n", "  The standard perturbative weak-coupling expansions in lattice models are\nasymptotic. The reason for this is hidden in the incorrect interchange of the\nsummation and integration. However, substituting the Gaussian initial\napproximation of the perturbative expansions by a certain interacting model or\nregularizing original lattice integrals, one can construct desired convergent\nseries. In this paper we develop methods, which are based on the joint and\nseparate utilization of the regularization and new initial approximation. We\nprove, that the convergent series exist and can be expressed as the re-summed\nstandard perturbation theory for any model on the finite lattice with the\npolynomial interaction of even degree. We discuss properties of such series and\nmake them applicable to practical computations. The workability of the methods\nis demonstrated on the example of the lattice $\\phi^4$-model. We calculate the\noperator $\\langle\\phi_n^2\\rangle$ using the convergent series, the comparison\nof the results with the Borel re-summation and Monte Carlo simulations shows a\ngood agreement between all these methods.\n", "  We revisit certain aspects of thermalization in 2D CFT. In particular, we\nconsider similarities and differences between the time dependence of\ncorrelation functions in various states in rational and non-rational CFTs. We\nalso consider the distinction between global and local thermalization and\nexplain how states obtained by acting with a diffeomorphism on the ground state\ncan appear locally thermal, and we review why the time-dependent expectation\nvalue of the energy-momentum tensor is generally a poor diagnostic of global\nthermalization. Since all 2D CFTs have an infinite set of commuting conserved\ncharges, generic initial states might be expected to give rise to a generalized\nGibbs ensemble rather than a pure thermal ensemble at late times. We construct\nthe holographic dual of the generalized Gibbs ensemble and show that, to\nleading order, it is still described by a BTZ black hole. The extra conserved\ncharges, while rendering $c < 1$ theories essentially integrable, therefore\nseem to have little effect on large-$c$ conformal field theories.\n", "  Live cell imaging of focal adhesions requires a sufficiently high temporal\nresolution, which remains a challenging task for super-resolution microscopy.\nWe have addressed this important issue by combining photo-activated\nlocalization microscopy (PALM) with super-resolution optical fluctuation\nimaging (SOFI). Using simulations and fixed cell focal adhesion images, we\ninvestigated the complementarity between PALM and SOFI in terms of spatial and\ntemporal resolution. This PALM-SOFI framework was used to image focal adhesions\nin living cells, while obtaining a temporal resolution below 10 s. We\nvisualized the dynamics of focal adhesions, and revealed local mean velocities\naround 190 nm per minute. The complementarity of PALM and SOFI was assessed in\ndetail with a methodology that integrates a quantitative resolution and\nsignal-to-noise metric. This PALM and SOFI concept provides an enlarged\nquantitative imaging framework, allowing unprecedented functional exploration\nof focal adhesions through the estimation of molecular parameters such as the\nfluorophore density and the photo-activation and photo-switching rates.\n", "  In complex transition metal oxides (TMO) an arrested electronic phase\nseparation (PS) appears by tuning the system near a Lifshitz transition in\nmultiband Hubbard models. The PS in La2CuO4+y near insulator to metal\ntransition (IMT) is made of short range Charge Density Wave (CDW) order\ninhomogeneity coexisting with quenched lattice disorder. While at high doping\ny=0.1 percolation gives a single superconducting phase, near the IMT at y=0.06\ntwo coexisting superconducting phases appear: the first one with a critical\ntemperature Tc1=16 K and the second one with Tc2=29K. It is known that the two\nsuperconducting phases are characterized by two different space geometry\nbecause of two different spatial distributions of both CDW order and dopants\nself-organization. Here we show that these two phases show different flux\ndynamic regimes using alternating current (AC) multi-harmonic susceptibility\nexperiments. This is a unique technique capable to investigate multi-phase\nsuperconductors and characterize their transport properties in a percolative\nscenario. Results point out that the low critical temperature phase is well\ndescribed by a bulk-like flux pinning with a 2D geometry while the phase with\nhigher critical temperature shows a barrier pinning mechanism providing direct\nevidence of two different superconducting vortex dynamics in different complex\ngeometrical spaces.\n", "  Transverse thermoelectric devices produce electric fields perpendicular to an\nincident heat flux. Classically, this process is driven by the Nernst effect in\nbulk solids, wherein a magnetic field generates a Lorentz force on thermally\nexcited electrons. The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) also produces\nmagnetization-dependent transverse electric fields. SSE is traditionally\nobserved in thin metallic films deposited on electrically insulating\nferromagnets, but the films' high resistance limits thermoelectric conversion\nefficiency. Combining Nernst and SSE in bulk materials would enable devices\nwith simultaneously large transverse thermopower and low electrical resistance.\nHere we demonstrate experimentally this is possible in composites of conducting\nferromagnets (Ni or MnBi) containing metallic nanoparticles with strong\nspin-orbit interactions (Pt or Au). These materials display positive shifts in\ntransverse thermopower attributable to inverse spin Hall electric fields in the\nnanoparticles. This more than doubles the power output of the Ni-Pt materials,\nestablishing proof-of-principle that SSE persists in bulk nanocomposites.\n", "  Valleytronics rooted in the valley degree of freedom is of both theoretical\nand technological importance as it offers additional opportunities for\ninformation storage and electronic, magnetic and optical switches. In analogy\nto ferroelectric materials with spontaneous charge polarization in electronics,\nas well as ferromagnetic materials with spontaneous spin polarization in\nspintronics, here we introduce a new member of ferroic-family, i.e. a\nferrovalley material with spontaneous valley polarization. Combining a two-band\nkp model with first-principles calculations, we show that 2H-VSe2 monolayer,\nwhere the spin-orbit coupling coexists with the intrinsic exchange interaction\nof transition-metal-d electrons, is such a room-temperature ferrovalley\nmaterial. We further predict that such system could demonstrate many\ndistinctive properties, for example, chirality-dependent optical band gap and\nmore interestingly, anomalous valley Hall effect. On account of the latter, a\nseries of functional devices based on ferrovalley materials, such as\nvalley-based nonvolatile random access memory, valley filter, are contemplated\nfor valleytronic applications.\n", "  We report on a theoretical study of the hidden charm $N^*_{c \\bar{c}}$ states\nin the $\\gamma p \\to \\bar{D}^{*0} \\Lambda^+_c$ reaction near threshold within\nan effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the contributions from the\n$s$-channel nucleon pole, the $t$-channel $D^0$ exchange, the $u$-channel\n$\\Lambda^+_c$ exchange and the contact term, we study the contributions from\nthe $N^*_{c \\bar{c}}$ states with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. The\ntotal and differential cross sections of the $\\gamma p \\to \\bar{D}^{*0}\nLambda^+_c$ reaction are predicted. It is found that the contributions of these\n$N^*_{c \\bar{c}}$ states give clear peak structures in the total cross\nsections. Thus, this reaction is another new platform to study the hidden-charm\nstates. It is expected that our model calculation may be tested by the future\nexperiments.\n", "  We notice that one of the Diophantine equations, $knm=2kn+2km+2nm$, arising\nin the universality originated Diophantine classification of simple Lie\nalgebras, has interesting interpretations for two different sets of signs of\nvariables. In both cases it describes \"regular polyhedrons\" with $k$ edges in\neach vertex, $n$ edges of each face, with total number of edges $|m|$, and\nEuler characteristics $\\chi=\\pm 2$. In the case of negative $m$ this equation\ncorresponds to $\\chi=2$ and describes true regular polyhedrons, Platonic\nsolids. The case with positive $m$ corresponds to Euler characteristic\n$\\chi=-2$ and describes the so called equivelar maps (charts) on the surface of\ngenus $2$. In the former case there are two routes from Platonic solids to\nsimple Lie algebras - abovementioned Diophantine classification and McKay\ncorrespondence. We compare them for all solutions of this type, and find\ncoincidence in the case of icosahedron (dodecahedron), corresponding to $E_8$\nalgebra. In the case of positive $k$, $n$ and $m$ we obtain in this way the\ninterpretation of (some of) the mysterious solutions (Y-objects), appearing in\nthe Diophantine classification and having some similarities with simple Lie\nalgebras.\n", "  We present the library Collier for the numerical evaluation of one-loop\nscalar and tensor integrals in perturbative relativistic quantum field\ntheories. The code provides numerical results for arbitrary tensor and scalar\nintegrals for scattering processes in general quantum field theories. For\ntensor integrals either the coefficients in a covariant decomposition or the\ntensor components themselves are provided. Collier supports complex masses,\nwhich are needed in calculations involving unstable particles. Ultraviolet and\ninfrared singularities are treated in dimensional regularization. For soft and\ncollinear singularities mass regularization is available as an alternative.\n", "  This paper studies a mathematical formalism of nonequilibrium thermodynamics\nfor chemical reaction models with $N$ species, $M$ reactions, and general rate\nlaw. We establish a mathematical basis for J. W. Gibbs' macroscopic chemical\nthermodynamics under G. N. Lewis' kinetic law of entire equilibrium (detailed\nbalance in nonlinear chemistry kinetics). In doing so, the equilibrium\nthermodynamics is then naturally generalized to nonequilibrium settings without\ndetailed balance. The kinetic models are represented by a Markovian jumping\nprocess. A generalized macroscopic chemical free energy function and its\nassociated balance equation with nonnegative source and sink are the major\ndiscoveries. The proof is based on the large deviation principle of this type\nof Markov processes. A general fluctuation dissipation theorem for stochastic\nreaction kinetics is also proved. The mathematical theory illustrates how a\nnovel macroscopic dynamic law can emerges from the mesoscopic kinetics in a\nmulti-scale system.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze spontaneous parametric down conversion in a 2D\nslant strip type periodically poled planar waveguide and show that such a\nconfiguration has efficiencies higher than in the case of bulk crystals with\nthe possibility of ease of collection like in channel waveguides with the\nadditional feature of wavelength tunability. The proposed design should find\napplications in quantum processing using integrated quantum optics.\n", "  We present simple derivations of nuclear $\\beta$-decay correlations with an\nemphasis on the special role of helicity. This provides a good opportunity to\nteach students about helicity and chirality in particle physics through\nexercises using simple aspects of quantum mechanics. In addition, this paper\nserves as an introduction to nuclear $\\beta$-decay correlations from both a\ntheoretical and experimental vantage. This article can be used to introduce\nstudents to ongoing experiments searching for hints of new physics in the\nlow-energy precision frontier.\n", "  In this work, we study the radiative leptonic decays of $B^-$ and $D^-$\nmesons using factorization approach. Factorization is proved to be valid\nexplicitly at 1-loop level at any order of $O(\\Lambda_{\\rm\nQCD}\\left/m_Q\\right.)$. We consider the contribution in the soft photon region\nthat $E_{\\gamma} \\sim \\left. \\Lambda^2_{\\rm QCD} /\\right. m_Q$. The numerical\nresults shows that, the soft photon region is very important for both the $B$\nand $D$ mesons. The branching ratios of $B\\to \\gamma e\\nu_e$ is $5.21\\times\n10^{-6}$, which is about $3$ times of the result obtained by only considering\nthe hard photon region $E_{\\gamma}\\sim m_Q$. And for the case of $D\\to \\gamma\ne\\nu_e$, the result of the branching ratio is $1.92\\times 10^{-5}$.\n", "  Many real time-series exhibit behavior adequate to long range dependent data.\nAdditionally very often these time-series have constant time periods and also\nhave characteristics similar to Gaussian processes although they are not\nGaussian. Therefore there is need to consider new classes of systems to model\nthese kind of empirical behavior. Motivated by this fact in this paper we\nanalyze two processes which exhibit long range dependence property and have\nadditional interesting characteristics which may be observed in real phenomena.\nBoth of them are constructed as the superposition of fractional Brownian motion\n(FBM) and other process. In the first case the internal process, which plays\nrole of the time, is the gamma process while in the second case the internal\nprocess is its inverse. We present in detail their main properties paying main\nattention to the long range dependence property. Moreover, we show how to\nsimulate these processes and estimate their parameters. We propose to use a\nnovel method based on rescaled modified cumulative distribution function for\nestimation of parameters of the second considered process. This method is very\nuseful in description of rounded data, like waiting times of subordinated\nprocesses delayed by inverse subordinators. By using the Monte Carlo method we\nshow the effectiveness of proposed estimation procedures.\n", "  Cupric oxide single crystal thin films were grown by plasma-assisted\nmolecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum and in situ\nreflection high-energy electron diffraction show that the thin films are 2x2\nreconstructed with an in-plane compression and out-of-plane stretching. Thermal\nstimulated current measurement indicates that the electric polarization\nresponse presents in the special 2D cupric oxide single crystal thin film over\na wide temperature range from 130 K to near-room temperature. We infer that the\nabnormal electric response involves the changing of phase transition\ntemperature induced by structure distortion, the spin frustration and magnetic\nfluctuation effect of short-range magnetic order, or the combined action of\nboth two factors mentioned above. This work suggests a promising clue for\nfinding new room temperature single phase multiferroics or tuning phase\ntransition temperature.\n", "  We study the flavor structure in $SO(32)$ heterotic string theory on\nsix-dimensional torus with magnetic fluxes. In particular, we focus on models\nwith the flavor symmetries $SU(3)_f$ and $\\Delta(27)$. In both models, we can\nrealize the realistic quark masses and mixing angles.\n", "  This contribution discusses in what respect Econophysics may be able to\ncontribute to the rebuilding of economics theory. It focuses on aggregation,\nindividual vs collective learning and functional wisdom of the crowds.\n", "  The \"separant\" of the evolution equation u_t=F, where F is some\ndifferentiable function of the derivatives of u up to order m is the partial\nderivative \\partial F}/{\\partial u_m} where u_m={\\partial^m u}/{\\partial x}^m.\nWe apply the formal symmetry method proposed in [MSS (1991)] to the\nclassification of scalar evolution equations of orders m\\le 15, with\nnon-trivial \\rho^{(-1)}=\\left[\\partial F/\\partial u_m\\right]^{-1/m} and\nrho^{(1). We obtain the \"top level\" parts of these equations and their \"top\ndependencies\" with respect to the \"level grading\" defined in [Mizrahi, Bilge\n(2013)]. We show that if rho^{(-1)} depends on u,u_1,\\dots,u_b, where b is the\nbase level, then, these equations are level homogeneous polynomials in\nu_{b+i},\\dots ,u_m, i\\ge 1 and the coefficient functions are determined up to\ntheir dependencies on u,u_1,\\dots,u_{b-1}. We prove that if \\rho^{(3)} is\nnon-trivial, then \\rho^{(-1)}=(\\alpha u_b^2+\\beta u_b+\\gamma)^{1/2}, with b\\le\n3 while if \\rho^{(3)} is trivial, then rho^{(-1)}=(\\lambda u_b+\\mu)^{1/3},\nwhere b\\le 5 and alpha, beta, gamma, lambda and mu are functions of\nu,\\dots,u_{b-1}. We show that these equations form commuting flows and we\nconstruct their recursion operators that are respectively of orders 2 and 6 for\nnon-trivial and trivial rho^(3) respectively. Omitting lower order\ndependencies, we show that equations with non-trivial rho^(3) and b=3 are\nsymmetries of the \"essentially non-linear third order equation\". For trivial\nrho^(3), the equations with b=5 are symmetries of a non-quasilinear fifth order\nequation obtained in [Bilge,(2005)] while for b=3,4 they are symmetries of\nquasilinear fifth order equations and we outline the transformations to\npolynomial equations where $u$ has zero scaling weight, suggesting that the\nhierarchies that we obtain could be transformable to known equations possibly\nby introducing non-locality.\n", "  The kagome lattice -- a two-dimensional (2D) arrangement of corner-sharing\ntriangles -- is at the forefront of the search for exotic states generated by\nmagnetic frustration. Such states have been observed experimentally for\nHeisenberg and planar spins. In contrast, frustration of Ising spins on the\nkagome lattice has previously been restricted to nano-fabricated systems and\nspin-ice materials under applied magnetic field. Here, we show that the layered\nIsing magnet Dy3Mg2Sb3O14 hosts an emergent order predicted theoretically for\nindividual kagome layers of in-plane Ising spins. Neutron-scattering and bulk\nthermomagnetic measurements, supported by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal a\nphase transition at T* = 0.3 K from a disordered spin-ice like regime to an\n\"emergent charge ordered\" state in which emergent charge degrees of freedom\nexhibit three-dimensional order while spins remain partially disordered. Our\nresults establish Dy3Mg2Sb3O14 as a tuneable system to study interacting\nemergent charges arising from kagome Ising frustration.\n", "  One of the most highly debated questions in the field of animal swarming and\nsocial behaviour, is the collective random patterns and chaotic behaviour\nformed by some animal species, in particular if there is a danger. Is such a\nbehaviour beneficial or unfavourable for survival? Here we report on one of the\nmost remarkable forms of animal swarming and social behaviour - fish schooling\n- from a hydrodynamic point of view. We found that some fish species do not\nhave preferred orientation and they swarm in a random pattern mode, despite the\nexcess of energy consumed. Our analyses, which includes calculations of the\nhydrodynamic forces between slender bodies, show that such a behaviour enhances\nthe transfer of hydrodynamic information, and thus enhances the survivability\nof the school. These findings support the general hypothesis that a disordered\nand non-trivial collective behaviour of individuals within a nonlinear\ndynamical system is essential for optimising transfer of information - an\noptimisation that might be crucial for survival.\n", "  We explore a version of black hole complementarity, where an approximate\nsemiclassical effective field theory for interior infalling degrees of freedom\nemerges holographically from an exact evolution of exterior degrees of freedom.\nThe infalling degrees of freedom have a complementary description in terms of\noutgoing Hawking radiation and must eventually decohere with respect to the\nexterior Hamiltonian, leading to a breakdown of the semiclassical description\nfor an infaller. Trace distance is used to quantify the difference between the\ncomplementary time evolutions, and to define a decoherence time. We propose a\ndictionary where the evolution with respect to the bulk effective Hamiltonian\ncorresponds to mean field evolution in the holographic theory. In a particular\nmodel for the holographic theory, which exhibits fast scrambling, the\ndecoherence time coincides with the scrambling time. The results support the\nhypothesis that decoherence of the infalling holographic state and disruptive\nbulk effects near the curvature singularity are complementary descriptions of\nthe same physics, which is an important step toward resolving the black hole\ninformation paradox.\n", "  We present a new software package designed to reduce the computational burden\nof hadron collider measurements in Parton Distribution Function (PDF) fits. The\nAPFELgrid package converts interpolated weight tables provided by APPLgrid\nfiles into a more efficient format for PDF fitting by the combination with PDF\nand $\\alpha_s$ evolution factors provided by APFEL. This combination\nsignificantly reduces the number of operations required to perform the\ncalculation of hadronic observables in PDF fits and simplifies the structure of\nthe calculation into a readily optimised scalar product. We demonstrate that\nour technique can lead to a substantial speed improvement when compared to\nexisting methods without any reduction in numerical accuracy.\n", "  Optical frequency combs provide the clockwork to relate optical frequencies\nto radio frequencies. Hence, combs allow to measure optical frequencies with\nrespect to a radio frequency where the accuracy is limited only by the\nreference signal. In order to provide a stable link between the radio and\noptical frequencies, the two parameters of the frequency comb must be fixed:\nthe carrier envelope offset frequency $f_{\\rm ceo}$ and the pulse\nrepetition-rate $f_{\\rm rep}$. We have developed the first optical frequency\ncomb based on difference frequency generation (DFG) that eliminates $f_{\\rm\nceo}$ by design - specifically tailored for applications in cold atom physics.\nAn $f_{\\rm ceo}$-free spectrum at 1550 nm is generated from a super continuum\nspanning more than an optical octave. Established amplification and frequency\nconversion techniques based on reliable telecom fiber technology allow\ngeneration of multiple wavelength outputs. In this paper we discuss the\nfrequency comb design, characterization, and optical frequency measurement of\nSr Rydberg states. The DFG technique allows for a compact and robust, passively\n$f_{\\rm ceo}$ stable frequency comb significantly improving reliability in\npractical applications.\n", "  Neutral long-lived particles (LLPs) are highly motivated by many BSM\nscenarios, such as theories of supersymmetry, baryogenesis, and neutral\nnaturalness, and present both tremendous discovery opportunities and\nexperimental challenges for the LHC. A major bottleneck for current LLP\nsearches is the prediction of SM backgrounds, which are often impossible to\nsimulate accurately. In this paper, we propose a general strategy for obtaining\ndifferential, data-driven background estimates in LLP searches, thereby notably\nextending the range of LLP masses and lifetimes that can be discovered at the\nLHC. We focus on LLPs decaying in the ATLAS Muon System, where triggers\nproviding both signal and control samples are available at the LHC Run-2. While\nmany existing searches require two displaced decays, a detailed knowledge of\nbackgrounds will allow for very inclusive searches that require just one\ndetected LLP decay. As we demonstrate for the $h \\to X X$ signal model of LLP\npair production in exotic Higgs decays, this results in dramatic sensitivity\nimprovements for proper lifetimes $\\gtrsim 10$ m. In theories of Neutral\nNaturalness, this extends reach to glueball masses far below the $\\bar b b$\nthreshold. Our strategy readily generalizes to other signal models, and other\ndetector subsystems. This framework therefore lends itself to the development\nof a systematic, model-independent LLP search program, in analogy to the highly\nsuccessful simplified-model framework of prompt searches.\n", "  Substituting noble metals for high-index dielectrics has recently been\nproposed as an alternative strategy in nanophotonics to design broadband\noptical resonators and circumvent the ohmic losses of plasmonic materials. In\nthis report, we demonstrate that subwavelength silicon nanoantennas can\nmanipulate the photon emission dynamics of fluorescent molecules. In practice,\nit is showed that dielectric nanoantennas can both increase and decrease the\nlocal density of optical states (LDOS) at room temperature, a process that is\ninaccessible with noble metals at the nanoscale. Using scanning probe\nmicroscopy, we analyze quantitatively, in three dimensions, the near-field\ninteraction between a 100 nm fluorescent nanosphere and silicon nanoantennas\nwith diameters ranging between 170 nm and 250 nm. Associated to numerical\nsimulations, these measurements indicate increased or decreased total\nspontaneous decay rates by up to 15 % and a gain in the collection efficiency\nof emitted photons by up to 85 %. Our study demonstrates the potential of\nsilicon-based nanoantennas for the low-loss manipulation of solid-state\nemitters at the nanoscale and at room temperature.\n", "  We use non-standard analysis to define a category\n$^\\star\\!\\operatorname{Hilb}$ suitable for categorical quantum mechanics in\narbitrary separable Hilbert spaces, and we show that standard bounded operators\ncan be suitably embedded in it. We show the existence of unital special\ncommutative $\\dagger$-Frobenius algebras, and we conclude\n$^\\star\\!\\operatorname{Hilb}$ to be compact closed, with partial traces and a\nHilbert-Schmidt inner product on morphisms. We exemplify our techniques on the\ntextbook case of 1-dimensional wavefunctions with periodic boundary conditions:\nwe show the momentum and position observables to be well defined, and to give\nrise to a strongly complementary pair of unital commutative $\\dagger$-Frobenius\nalgebras.\n", "  The results obtained in laboratory tests, using scintillator bars read by\nsilicon photomultipliers are reported. The present approach is the first step\nfor designing a precision tracking system to be placed inside a free magnetized\nvolume for the charge identification of low energy crossing particles. The\ndevised system is demonstrated able to provide a spatial resolution better than\n2 mm.\n", "  Large Scale Shell Model calculations (SM-CI) predict that the region of\ndeformation which comprises the heaviest Chromium and Iron isotopes at and\nbeyond N=40 will merge with a new one at N=50 in an astonishing parallel to the\nN=20 and N=28 case in the Neon and Magnesium isotopes. We propose a valence\nspace including the full pf-shell for the protons and the full sdg shell for\nthe neutrons; which represents a comeback of the the harmonic oscillator shells\nin the very neutron rich regime. The onset of deformation is understood in the\nframework of the algebraic SU3-like structures linked to quadrupole dominance.\nOur calculations preserve the doubly magic nature of the ground state of 78 Ni,\nwhich, however, exhibits a well deformed prolate band at low excitation energy,\nproviding a striking example of shape coexistence far from stability.\n", "  Unique optical properties of semiconductor nanoparticles (SN) make them very\npromising in the multitude of applications including lasing, light emission and\nphotovoltaics. In many of these applications it is imperative to understand the\nphysics of interaction of electrons in a SN with external electromagnetic\nfields on the quantitative level. In particular, the strength of\nelectron-photon coupling determines such important SN parameters as the\nradiative lifetime and absorption cross section. This strength is often assumed\nto be fully encoded by the so called Kane momentum matrix element. This\nparameter, however, pertains to a bulk semiconductor material and, as such, is\nnot sensitive to the quantum confinement effects in SNs. In this work we\ndemonstrate that the quantum confinement, via the so called band mixing, can\nresult in a significant suppression of the strength of electron interaction\nwith electromagnetic field. Within the envelope function formalism we show how\nthis suppression can be described by introducing an effective energy-dependent\nKane momentum. Then, the effect of band mixing on the efficiencies of various\nphotoinduced processes can be fully captured by the conventional formulae\n(e.g., spontaneous emission rate), once the conventional Kane momentum is\nsubstituted with the renormalized energy-dependent Kane momentum introduced in\nhere. As an example, we evaluate the energy-dependent Kane momentum for\nspherical $\\rm{PbSe}$ and $\\rm{PbS}$ SNs (i.e., quantum dots) and show that\nneglecting band mixing in these systems can result in the overestimation of\nabsorption cross sections and emission rates by a factor of $\\sim$2.\n", "  We investigate spectral behavior of phonon spectral functions in an\ninteracting multi-component hot carrier plasma. Dielectric polarization\nfunctions are formulated so that they satisfy Dyson equations of the effective\ninteractions among plasma components. We find a useful sum rule giving simple\nrelation between plasma-species resolved dielectric functions. Spectral\nanalysis of various phonon spectral functions is performed considering\ncarrier-phonon channels of polar and nonpolar optical phonons, acoustic\ndeformation-potential, and piezoelectric Coulomb couplings. Effects of phonon\nself-energy corrections are examined at finite temperature within a random\nphase approximation extended to include the effects of dynamic screening,\nplasmon--phonon coupling, and local-field corrections of the plasma species. We\nprovide numerical data for the case of a photo-generated electron-hole plasma\nformed in a wurtzite GaN. Our result shows clear significance of the\nmultiplicity of the plasma species in the dielectric response and phonon\nspectral functions of a multi-component plasma.\n", "  The Einstein Equivalence Principle~(EEP) can be verified by the measurement\nof the spectral distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The\nexistence of energy-dependency in the cosmological redshift effect means the\nEEP violation. Introducing the energy-dependent Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric motivated by rainbow gravity, we show that the energy-dependent redshift\neffect causes the CMB spectral distortions. Assuming the simple\nenergy-dependent form of the metric, we evaluate the distortions. From the\nCOBE/FIRAS bound, we find that the deviation degree from the EEP, which is\ncomparable to the difference of the parameterized-post-Newtonian parameter\n\"gamma\" in energy, is less than 10^{-9} at the CMB energy scale.\n", "  The recent theoretical prediction by Maimbourg and Kurchan [arXiv:1603.05023]\nthat for regular pair-potential systems the virial potential-energy correlation\ncoefficient increases towards unity as the dimension $d$ goes to infinity is\ninvestigated for the standard 12-6 Lennard-Jones fluid. This is done by\ncomputer simulations for $d=2,3,4$ going from the critical point along the\ncritical isotherm/isochore to higher density/temperature. In all cases the\nvirial potential-energy correlation coefficient increases significantly. For a\ngiven density and temperature relative to the critical point, with increasing\nnumber of dimension the Lennard-Jones system conforms better to the\nhidden-scale-invariance property characterized by high virial potential-energy\ncorrelations (a property that leads to the existence of isomorphs in the\nthermodynamic phase diagram, implying that it becomes effectively\none-dimensional in regard to structure and dynamics). The present paper also\ngives the first numerical demonstration of isomorph invariance of structure and\ndynamics in four dimensions. Our findings emphasize the need for a universally\napplicable $1/d$ expansion in liquid-state theory; we conjecture that the\nsystems known to obey hidden scale invariance in three dimensions are those for\nwhich the yet-to-be-developed $1/d$ expansion converges rapidly.\n", "  A study of the gas pressure effect in the position resolution of an\ninteracting X- or gamma-ray photon in a gas medium is performed. The intrinsic\nposition resolution for pure noble gases (Argon and Xenon) and their mixtures\nwith CO2 and CH4 were calculated for several gas pressures (1-10bar) and for\nphoton energies between 5.4 and 60.0 keV, being possible to establish a linear\nmatch between the intrinsic position resolution and the inverse of the gas\npressure in that energy range. In order to evaluate the quality of the method\nhere described, a comparison between the available experimental data and the\ncalculated one in this work, is done and discussed. In the majority of the\ncases, a strong agreement is observed.\n", "  The orbital element distribution of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with large\npericenters has been suggested to be influenced by the presence of an\nundetected, large planet at >200 AU from the Sun. To find additional\nobservables caused by this scenario, we here present the first detailed\nemplacement simulation in the presence of a massive ninth planet on the distant\nKuiper Belt. We perform 4 Gyr N-body simulations with the currently known Solar\nSystem planetary architecture, plus a 10 Earth mass planet with similar orbital\nparameters to those suggested by Trujillo & Sheppard (2014) or Batygin & Brown\n(2016), and 10^5 test particles in an initial planetesimal disk. We find that\nincluding a distant superearth-mass planet produces a substantially different\norbital distribution for the scattering and detached TNOs, raising the\npericenters and inclinations of moderate semimajor axis (50<a<500 AU) objects.\nWe test whether this signature is detectable via a simulator with the\nobservational characteristics of four precisely characterized TNO surveys. We\nfind that the qualitatively very distinct Solar System models that include a\nninth planet are essentially observationally indistinguishable from an outer\nSolar System produced solely by the four giant planets. We also find that the\nmass of the Kuiper Belt's current scattering and detached populations is\nrequired to be 3-10 times larger in the presence of an additional planet. We do\nnot find any evidence for clustering of orbital angles in our simulated TNO\npopulation. Wide-field, deep surveys targeting inclined high-pericenter objects\nwill be required to distinguish between these different scenarios.\n", "  We revisit the hypothesis of a possible line structure in the Hawking\nevaporation spectrum of black holes. Because of nonperturbative quantum gravity\neffects, this would take place arbitrarily far away from the Planck mass. We\nshow, based on a speculative but consistent hypothesis, that this naive\nprediction might in fact hold in the specific context of loop quantum gravity.\nA small departure from the ideal case is expected for some low-spin transitions\nand could allow us to distinguish several quantum gravity models. We also show\nthat the effect is not washed out by the dynamics of the process, by existence\nof a mass spectrum up to a given width, or by the secondary component induced\nby the decay of neutral pions emitted during the time-integrated evaporation.\n", "  Effect algebras are one of the generalizations of Boolean algebras proposed\nin the quest for a quantum logic. Frobenius algebras are a tool of categorical\nquantum mechanics, used to present various families of observables in abstract,\noften nonstandard frameworks. Both effect algebras and Frobenius algebras\ncapture their respective fragments of quantum mechanics by elegant and succinct\naxioms; and both come with their conceptual mysteries. A particularly elegant\nand mysterious constraint, imposed on Frobenius algebras to characterize a\nclass of tripartite entangled states, is the antispecial law. A particularly\ncontentious issue on the quantum logic side is the modularity law, proposed by\nvon Neumann to mitigate the failure of distributivity of quantum logical\nconnectives. We show that, if quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics\nare formalized in the same framework, then the antispecial law of categorical\nquantum mechanics corresponds to the natural requirement of effect algebras\nthat the units are each other's unique complements; and that the modularity law\ncorresponds to the Frobenius condition. These correspondences lead to the\nequivalence announced in the title. Aligning the two formalisms, at the very\nleast, sheds new light on the concepts that are more clearly displayed on one\nside than on the other (such as e.g. the orthogonality). Beyond that, it may\nalso open up new approaches to deep and important problems of quantum mechanics\n(such as the classification of complementary observables).\n", "  Understanding the general principles underlying strongly interacting quantum\nstates out of equilibrium is one of the most important tasks of current\ntheoretical physics. With experiments accessing the intricate dynamics of\nmany-body quantum systems, it is paramount to develop powerful methods that\nencode the emergent physics. Up to now, the strong dichotomy observed between\nintegrable and non-integrable evolutions made an overarching theory difficult\nto build, especially for transport phenomena where space-time profiles are\ndrastically different. We present a novel framework for studying transport in\nintegrable systems: hydrodynamics with infinitely-many conservation laws. This\nbridges the conceptual gap between integrable and non-integrable quantum\ndynamics, and gives powerful tools for accurate studies of space-time profiles.\nWe apply it to the description of energy transport between heat baths, and\nprovide a full description of the current-carrying non-equilibrium steady state\nand the transition regions in a family of models including the Lieb-Liniger\nmodel of interacting Bose gases, realized in experiments.\n", "  Analytical functions for the propagators of QCD, including a set of chiral\nquarks, are derived by a one-loop massive expansion in the Landau gauge, deep\nin the infrared. By analytic continuation, the spectral functions are studied\nin Minkowski space, yielding a direct proof of positivity violation and\nconfinement from first principles.The dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry is\ndescribed on the same footing of gluon mass generation, providing a unified\npicture. While dealing with the exact Lagrangian, the expansion is based on\nmassive free-particle propagators, is safe in the infrared and is equivalent to\nthe standard perturbation theory in the UV. By dimensional regularization, all\ndiverging mass terms cancel exactly without including mass counterterms that\nwould spoil the gauge and chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian. Universal scaling\nproperties are predicted for the inverse dressing functions and shown to be\nsatisfied by the lattice data. Complex conjugated poles are found for the gluon\npropagator, in agreement with the i-particle scenario.\n", "  We show explicitly that the full structure of IIB string theory is needed to\nremove the non-localities that arise in boundary conformal theories that border\nhyperbolic spaces on AdS$_5$. Specifically, using the\nCaffarelli/Silvestri\\cite{caffarelli}, Graham/Zworski\\cite{graham}, and\nChang/Gonzalez\\cite{chang:2010} extension theorems, we prove that the boundary\noperator conjugate to bulk p-forms with negative mass in geodesically complete\nmetrics is inherently a non-local operator, specifically the fractional\nconformal Laplacian. The non-locality, which arises even in compact spaces,\napplies to any degree p-form such as a gauge field. We show that the boundary\ntheory contains fractional derivatives of the longitudinal components of the\ngauge field if the gauge field in the bulk along the holographic direction\nacquires a mass via the Higgs mechanism. The non-locality is shown to vanish\nonce the metric becomes incomplete, for example, either 1) asymptotically by\nadding N transversely stacked Dd-branes or 2) exactly by giving the boundary a\nbrane structure and including a single transverse Dd-brane in the bulk. The\noriginal Maldacena conjecture within IIB string theory corresponds to the\nformer. In either of these proposals, the location of the Dd-branes places an\nupper bound on the entanglement entropy because the minimal bulk surface in the\nAdS reduction is ill-defined at a brane interface. Since the brane\nsingularities can be circumvented in the full 10-dimensional spacetime, we\nconjecture that the true entanglement entropy must be computed from the minimal\nsurface in 10-dimensions, which is of course not minimal in the AdS$_5$\nreduction.\n", "  We consider the Beta polymer, an exactly solvable model of directed polymer\non the square lattice, introduced by Barraquand and Corwin. We study the\nstatistical properties of its point to point partition sum. The problem is\nequivalent to a model of a random walk in a time-dependent (and in general\nbiased) 1D random environment. In this formulation, we study the sample to\nsample fluctuations of the transition probability distribution function (PDF)\nof the random walk. Using the Bethe ansatz we obtain exact formulas for the\ninteger moments, and Fredholm determinant formulas for the Laplace transform of\nthe directed polymer partition sum/random walk transition probability. The\nasymptotic analysis of these formulas at large time $t$ is performed both (i)\nin a diffusive vicinity, $x \\sim t^{1/2}$, of the optimal direction (in\nspace-time) chosen by the random walk, where the fluctuations of the PDF are\nfound to be Gamma distributed; (ii) in the large deviations regime, $x \\sim t$,\nof the random walk, where the fluctuations of the logarithm of the PDF are\nfound to grow with time as $t^{1/3}$ and to be distributed according to the\nTracy-Widom GUE distribution. Our exact results complement those of BC for the\ncumulative distribution function of the random walk in regime (ii), and in\nregime (i) they unveil a novel fluctuation behavior. We also discuss the\ncrossover regime between (i) and (ii), identified as $x \\sim t^{3/4}$. Our\nresults are confronted to extensive numerical simulations of the model.\n", "  We derive the free energy for fermions and bosons from fragmentation data.\nInspired by the symmetry and pairing energy of the Weizsacker mass formula we\nobtain the free energy of fermions (nucleons) and bosons (alphas and deuterons)\nusing Landau's free energy approach. We confirm previously obtained results for\nfermions and show that the free energy for alpha particles is negative and very\nclose to the free energy for ideal Bose gases. Deuterons behave more similarly\nto fermions (positive free energy) rather than bosons. This is due to their low\nbinding energy, which makes them very 'fragile', i.e., easily formed and\ndestroyed. We show that the {\\alpha}-particle fraction is dominant at all\ntemperatures and densities explored in this work. This is consistent with their\nnegative free energy, which favors clusterization of nuclear matter into\n{\\alpha}-particles at subsaturation densities and finite temperatures. The role\nof finite open systems and Coulomb repulsion is addressed.\n", "  A new method of probing mechanical losses and comparing the corresponding\ndeposition processes of metallic and dielectric coatings in 1-100 MHz frequency\nrange and cryogenic temperatures is presented. The method is based on the use\nof extremely high-quality quartz acoustic cavities whose internal losses are\norders of magnitude lower than any available coatings nowadays. The approach is\ndemonstrated for Chromium, Chromium/Gold and a multilayer tantala/silica\ncoatings. The ${\\rm Ta}_2{\\rm O}_5/{\\rm Si}{\\rm O}_2$ coating has been found to\nexhibit a loss angle lower than $1.6\\times10^{-5}$ near 30 {\\rm MHz} at 4 {\\rm\nK}. The results are compared to the previous measurements.\n", "  This paper presents a simple model that mimics quantum mechanics (QM) results\nwithout using complex wavefunctions or non-localities. The proposed model only\nuses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic operations, in particular\nassuming a discrete spacetime under the form of a Euclidean lattice. The\nproposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks.\nTransition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are\neither randomly associated to the particles during their preparation, or stored\nin the lattice nodes they visit during the walk. Non-relativistic QM\npredictions are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly-prepared\nensembles of particles. The scenarios considered to assess the model comprise\nof free particle, constant external force, harmonic oscillator, particle in a\nbox, and the Delta potential.\n", "  While much is known about isoelectronic materials related to carbon\nnanostructures, such as boron nitride layers and nanotubes, rather less is\nknown about equivalent silicon based materials. Following the recent discovery\nof phosphorene, we herein discuss isoelectronic silicon monosulfide monolayers.\nWe describe a set of anisotropic ground state structures that clearly have a\nhigh stability with respect to the near isotropic silicon monosulfide\nmonolayers. The source of the layer anisotropy is related to the presence of\nSi-S double chains linked by some Si-Si covalent bonds, which lye at the core\nof the increased stability, together with a remarkable spd hybridization on Si.\nThe involvement of d orbitals brings more variety to silicon-sulfide based\nnanostructures that are isoelectronic to phosphorene, which could be relevant\nfor future applications, adding extra degrees of freedom.\n", "  We introduce a classical potentiostatic feedback mechanism that attenuates\nthe dissipation in a quantum system arising from coupling to the surrounding\nthermodynamic bath, preserving the inter-state interference in an electronic\nexcitation transfer (EET) process. A three-terminal potentiostat device applies\na low-noise voltage bias to the terminals of the EET system and reduces the\nphysical coupling between the quantum system and its environment. We introduce\na classical equivalent circuit to model the environment-coupled excitation\ntransfer in an elementary two-state system. This model provides qualitative\ninsight into how classical feedback action affects the transition probabilities\nbetween the states and selectively reduces the dissipative coupling for one of\nthe vibronic energy levels of the transfer system. Furthermore, we show that\nnegative feedback results in persistent spectral coherence between the energy\nlevel of the decoupled state and the vibronic levels of the complementary\nstate, making the decoupled vibronic channel a probe for characterizing the\nvibronic structure of the complementary channel of the EET system.\n", "  Earlier Monte-Carlo calculations on the dissipative two-dimensional XY model\nare extended in several directions. We study the phase diagram and the\ncorrelation functions when dissipation is very small, where it has properties\nof the classical 3D-XY transition, i.e. one with a dynamical critical exponent\n$z=1$. The transition changes from $z=1$ to the class of criticality with $z\n\\to \\infty$ driven by topological defects, discovered earlier, beyond a\ncritical dissipation. We also find that the critical correlations have\npower-law singularities as a function of tuning the ratio of the kinetic energy\nto the potential energy for fixed large dissipation, as opposed to essential\nsingularities on tuning dissipation keeping the former fixed. A phase with\ntemporal disorder but spatial order of the Kosterlitz-Thouless form is also\nfurther investigated. We also present results for the transition when the\nallowed Caldeira-Leggett form of dissipation and the allowed form of\ndissipation coupling to the compact rotor variables are both included. The\nnature of the transition is then determined by the Caldeira-Leggett form.\n", "  In the present work we study the Fermi--Pasta--Ulam (FPU) $\\beta $--model\ninvolving long--range interactions (LRI) in both the quadratic and quartic\npotentials, by introducing two independent exponents $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$\nrespectively, which make the {forces decay} with distance $r$. Our results\ndemonstrate that weak chaos, in the sense of decreasing Lyapunov exponents, and\n$q$--Gaussian probability density functions (pdfs) of sums of the momenta,\noccurs only when long--range interactions are included in the quartic part.\nMore importantly, for $0\\leq \\alpha_2<1$, we obtain extrapolated values for $q\n\\equiv q_\\infty >1$, as $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, suggesting that these pdfs\npersist in that limit. On the other hand, when long--range interactions are\nimposed only on the quadratic part, strong chaos and purely Gaussian pdfs are\nalways obtained for the momenta. We have also focused on similar pdfs for the\nparticle energies and have obtained $q_E$-exponentials (with $q_E>1$) when the\nquartic-term interactions are long--ranged, otherwise we get the standard\nBoltzmann-Gibbs weight, with $q=1$. The values of $q_E$ coincide, within small\ndiscrepancies, with the values of $q$ obtained by the momentum distributions.\n", "  Considering the Cornell potential $V(r)=-\\frac{4\\alpha_s}{3r}+br+c$, we have\nrevisited the Dalgarno's method of perturbation by incorporating two scales\n$r^{short}$ and $r^{long}$ as integration limit so that the perturbative\nprocedure can be improved in a potential model. With the improved version of\nthe wave function the ground state masses of the heavy-light mesons $ D, D_s,\nB, B_s$ and $B_c $ are computed. The slopes and curvatures of the form factors\nof semi-leptonic decays of heavy-light mesons in both HQET limit and finite\nmass limit are calculated and compared with the available data.\n", "  We introduce orthogonal quantum Latin squares, which restrict to traditional\northogonal Latin squares, and investigate their application in quantum\ninformation science. We use quantum Latin squares to build maximally entangled\nbases, and show how a pair of mutually unbiased maximally entangled bases can\nbe constructed in square dimension from orthogonal quantum Latin squares. We\nalso compare our construction to an existing construction due to Beth and\nWocjan and show that ours is strictly more general.\n", "  The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis implies that for a thermodynamically\nlarge system in one of its eigenstates, the reduced density matrix describing\nany finite subsystem is determined solely by a set of {\\it relevant} conserved\nquantities. In a generic system, only the energy plays that role and hence\neigenstates appear locally thermal. Integrable systems, on the other hand,\npossess an extensive number of such conserved quantities and hence the reduced\ndensity matrix requires specification of an infinite number of parameters\n(Generalized Gibbs Ensemble). However, here we show by unbiased statistical\nsampling of the individual eigenstates with a given finite energy density, that\nthe local description of an overwhelming majority of these states of even such\nan integrable system is actually Gibbs-like, i.e. requires only the energy\ndensity of the eigenstate. Rare eigenstates that cannot be represented by the\nGibbs ensemble can also be sampled efficiently by our method and their local\nproperties are then shown to be described by appropriately {\\it truncated}\nGeneralized Gibbs Ensembles. We further show that the presence of these rare\neigenstates differentiates the model from the generic (non-integrable) case and\nleads to the system being described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble at long\ntime under a unitary dynamics following a sudden quench, even when the initial\nstate is a Gibbs-like eigenstate of the pre-quench Hamiltonian.\n", "  A composite model of quarks and bosons is proposed in which a spin $1/2$\nisospin doublet $\\psi$ is the basic building block of quarks, $W^\\pm$, $Z^0$\nand Higgs boson $H^0$ in the standard model. The $\\psi$ has two components\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with charges $Q_\\alpha=\\frac{2}{3}e$ and\n$Q_\\beta=-\\frac{1}{3}e$, respectively. The two constituent flavors $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ combine to form the three generations of colored standard model quark\nflavors. A triplet of massless hypergluons binds the constituents called\ngeminis. The strong confining non-Abelian $SU(2)_C$ constituent color dynamics\nhas a confining energy scale $\\Lambda_{CD}$. The leptons, the massless photon,\ngluons and triplet of hypergluons are treated as point particles. The\nnon-Abelian $SU(2)_C$ color dynamics satisfies asymptotic freedom, and,\ntogether with the compositeness of the Higgs boson $H^0$, resolve the Higgs\nmass and gauge hierarchy fine-tuning problems.\n", "  Electromagnetic resonance properties are uniquely defined at the pole and do\nnot depend on the separation of the resonance from background or the decay\nchannel. Photon-nucleon branching ratios are nowadays often quoted at the pole,\nand we generalize the considerations to the case of virtual photons. We derive\nand compare relations for nucleon to baryon transition form factors both for\nthe Breit-Wigner and the pole positions. Using the MAID2007 and SAID SM08\npartial wave analyses of pion electroproduction data, we compare the $G_M$,\n$G_E$, and $G_C$ form factors for the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance excitation at\nthe Breit-Wigner resonance and pole positions up to $Q^2=5$ GeV$^2$. We also\nexplore the $E/M$ and $S/M$ ratios as functions of $Q^2$. For pole and residue\nextraction, we apply the Laurent + Pietarinen method.\n", "  Ionic migration has been proposed as a possible cause of photovoltaic\ncurrent-voltage hysteresis in hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, a major\nobjection to this hypothesis is that hysteresis can be reduced by changing the\ninterfacial contact materials, which are unlikely to significantly influence\nthe behaviour of ionic defects within the perovskite phase. Here we use\ntransient optoelectronic measurements, combined with device simulations, to\nshow that the primary effects of ionic migration can in fact be observed both\nin devices with hysteresis, and with hysteresis free type contact materials.\nThe data indicate that electric-field screening, consistent with ionic\nmigration, is similar or identical in both high and low hysteresis CH3NH3PbI3\ncells. Simulation of the transients shows that hysteresis requires the\ncombination of both mobile ionic charge and recombination near the contacts.\nPassivating contact recombination results in higher photogenerated charge\nconcentrations at forward bias which screen the ionic charge, reducing\nhysteresis.\n", "  One of the most interesting puzzles in particle physics today is that new\nphysics is expected at the TeV energy scale to solve the hierarchy problem, and\nstabilise the Higgs mass, but so far no unambiguous signal of new physics has\nbeen found. Strong constraints on the energy scale of new physics can be\nderived from precision tests of the electroweak theory and from\nflavour-changing or CP-violating processes in strange, charm and beauty hadron\ndecays. Decays that proceed via flavour-changing-neutral-current processes are\nforbidden at the lowest perturbative order in the Standard Model and are,\ntherefore, rare. Rare $b$ hadron decays are playing a central role in the\nunderstanding of the underlying patterns of Standard Model physics and in\nsetting up new directions in model building for new physics contributions. In\nthis article the status and prospects of this field are reviewed.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that non-collinear intrinsic spin-orbit\nmagnetic fields can be realized in a curved carbon nanotube two-segment device.\nEach segment, analyzed in the quantum dot regime, shows near four-fold\ndegenerate shell structure allowing for identification of the spin-orbit\ncoupling and the angle between the two segments. Furthermore, we determine the\nfour unique spin directions of the quantum states for specific shells and\nmagnetic fields. This class of quantum dot systems is particularly interesting\nwhen combined with induced superconducting correlations as it may facilitate\nunconventional superconductivity and detection of Cooper pair entanglement. Our\ndevice comprises the necessary elements.\n", "  We present a lattice simulation study of large $N_c$ regularities of meson\nand baryon spectroscopy in $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with two flavors of dynamical\nfundamental representation fermions. Systems investigated include $N_c=2$, 3,\n4, and 5, over a range of fermion masses parametrized by a squared pseudoscalar\nto vector meson mass ratio between about 0.2 to 0.7. Good agreement with large\n$N_c$ scaling is observed in the static potential, in meson masses and decay\nconstants, and in baryon spectroscopy. This is an update of the published\nversion of the paper (Phys. Rev. D94 (2016) 034506).\n", "  We report a theoretical description and experimental implementation of a\nnovel two-dimensional coherent excitation spectroscopy based on\nquasi-steady-state photoinduced absorption measurement of a long-lived\nnonlinear population. We have studied a\nsemiconductor-polymer:fullerene-derivative distributed heterostructure by\nmeasuring the 2D excitation spectrum by means of photoluminescence,\nphotocurrent and photoinduced absorption from metastable polaronic products. We\nconclude that the photoinduced absorption probe is a viable and valuable probe\nin this family of 2D coherent spectroscopies.\n", "  We propose a space-based gravitational wave detector consisting of two\nspatially separated, drag-free satellites sharing ultra-stable optical laser\nlight over a single baseline. Each satellite contains an optical lattice atomic\nclock, which serves as a sensitive, narrowband detector of the local frequency\nof the shared laser light. A synchronized two-clock comparison between the\nsatellites will be sensitive to the effective Doppler shifts induced by\nincident gravitational waves (GWs) at a level competitive with other proposed\nspace-based GW detectors, while providing complementary features. The detected\nsignal is a differential frequency shift of the shared laser light due to the\nrelative velocity of the satellites, and the detection window can be tuned\nthrough the control sequence applied to the atoms' internal states. This scheme\nenables the detection of GWs from continuous, spectrally narrow sources, such\nas compact binary inspirals, with frequencies ranging from ~3 mHz - 10 Hz\nwithout loss of sensitivity, thereby bridging the detection gap between\nspace-based and terrestrial optical interferometric GW detectors. Our proposed\nGW detector employs just two satellites, is compatible with integration with an\noptical interferometric detector, and requires only realistic improvements to\nexisting ground-based clock and laser technologies.\n", "  The swimming of a two-sphere system and of a three-sphere chain in an\nincompressible viscous fluid is studied on the basis of simplified equations of\nmotion which take account of both Stokes friction and added mass effects. The\nanalysis is based on an explicit expression for the asymptotic periodic\nswimming velocity and a corresponding evaluation of the mean rate of\ndissipation. The mean swimming velocity of the two-sphere system is found to be\nnon-vanishing provided that the two spheres are not identical. The swimming of\na comparable chain of three identical spheres is much more efficient.\n", "  Despite extensive search for about a decade, specular Andreev reflection is\nonly recently realized in bilayer graphene-superconductor interface. However,\nthe evolution from the typical retro type Andreev reflection to the unique\nspecular Andreev reflection in single layer graphene has not yet been observed.\nWe investigate this transition by measuring the differential conductance at the\nvan der Walls interface of single layer graphene and NbSe2 superconductor. We\nfind that the normalized conductance becomes suppressed as we pass through the\nDirac cone via tuning the Fermi level and bias energy, which manifests the\ntransition from retro to non-retro type Andreev reflection. The suppression\nindicates the blockage of Andreev reflection beyond a critical angle of the\nincident electron with respect to the normal between the single layer graphene\nand the superconductor junction. The results are compared with a theoretical\nmodel of the corresponding setup.\n", "  In the present work a Cartan mechanics version for Routh reduction is\nconsidered, as an intermediate step toward Routh reduction in field theory.\nMotivation for this generalization comes from an scheme for integrable systems\n[12], used for understanding the occurrence of Toda field theories in so called\nHamiltonian reduction of WZNW field theories [11]. As a way to accomplish with\nthis intermediate aim, this article also contains a formulation of the\nLagrangian Adler-Kostant-Symes systems discussed in [12] in terms of Routh\nreduction.\n", "  The accuracy of the noninteracting electron approximation is examined for a\nmodel of vibrationally coupled electron transport in single molecule junction.\nIn the absence of electronic-vibrational coupling, steady state transport in\nthis model is described exactly by Landauer theory. Including coupling, both\nelectronic-vibrational and vibrationally induced electron-electron correlation\neffects may contribute to the real time quantum dynamics. Using the multilayer\nmulticonfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) theory to describe nuclear\ndynamics exactly while maintaining the noninteracting electron approximation\nfor the electronic dynamics, the correlation effects are analyzed in different\nphysical regimes. It is shown that although the noninteracting electron\napproximation may be reasonable for describing short time dynamics, it does not\ngive the correct long time limit for certain initial conditions.\n", "  Tensions between several cosmic observations were found recently, such as the\ninconsistent values of $H_{0}$ (or $\\sigma_{8}$) were indicated by the\ndifferent cosmic observations. Introducing the massive neutrinos in\n$\\Lambda$CDM could potentially solve the tensions. Viable $f(R)$ gravity\nproducing $\\Lambda$CDM background expansion with massive neutrinos is\ninvestigated in this paper. We fit the current observational data: Planck-2015\nCMB, RSD, BAO and SNIa to constrain the mass of neutrinos in viable $f(R)$\ntheory. The constraint results at 95\\% confidence level are: $\\Sigma\nm_\\nu<0.202$ eV for the active neutrino case, $m_{\\nu, sterile}^{eff}<0.757$ eV\nwith $N_{eff}<3.22$ for the sterile neutrino case. For the effects by the mass\nof neutrinos, the constraint results on model parameter at 95\\% confidence\nlevel become $f_{R0}\\times 10^{-6}> -1.89$ and $f_{R0}\\times 10^{-6}> -2.02$\nfor two cases, respectively. It is also shown that the fitting values of\nseveral parameters much depend on the neutrino properties, such as the cold\ndark matter density, the cosmological quantities at matter-radiation equality,\nthe neutrino density and the fraction of baryonic mass in helium. At last, the\nconstraint result shows that the tension between direct and CMB measurements of\n$H_0$ gets slightly weaker in the viable $f(R)$ model than that in the base\n$\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  We propose an alternative framework for quantifying coherence. The framework\nis based on a natural property of coherence, the additivity of coherence for\nsubspace-independent states, which is described by an operation-independent\nequality rather than operation-dependent inequalities and therefore applicable\nto various physical contexts. Our framework is compatible with all the known\nresults on coherence measures but much more flexible and convenient for\napplications, and by using it many open questions can be resolved.\n", "  Manipulation of spin and valley degrees of freedom is a key step towards\nrealizing novel quantum technologies, for which atomically thin transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been established as promising candidates. In\nmonolayer TMDCs, the lack of inversion symmetry gives rise to a spin-valley\ncorrelation of the band structure allowing for valley-selective electronic\nexcitation with circularly polarized light. Here we show that, even in\ncentrosymmetric samples of 2H-WSe2, circularly polarized light can generate\nspin-, valley- and layer-polarized excited states in the conduction band.\nEmploying time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with\nspin-selective excitation, the dynamics of valley and layer pseudospins of the\nexcited carriers are investigated. Complementary time-dependent density\nfunctional theory (TDDFT) calculations of the excited state populations reveal\na strong circular dichroism of the spin-, valley- and layer-polarizations and a\npronounced 2D character of the excited states in the K valleys. We observe\nscattering of carriers towards the global minimum of the conduction band on a\nsub-100 femtosecond timescale to states with three-dimensional character\nfacilitating inter-layer charge transfer. Our results establish the optical\ncontrol of coupled spin-, valley- and layer-polarized states in centrosymmetric\nmaterials and suggest the suitability of TMDC multilayer materials for\nvalleytronic and spintronic device concepts.\n", "  We present an experiment based on a fibered Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The\naim is to familiarize students with fibered optics and interferometry, and to\nimprove their understanding of optical amplification. The laboratory project\nhas two parts: in a first part, the students modulate the optical path of the\ninterferometer to study the spectra of light sources via Fourier Transform\nSpectroscopy. In a second part, an optical amplifier is placed in one or both\narms of the interferometer. The set-up uses monomode, polarization-maintaining\nfibers that propagate light of 1.5 $\\mu$m wavelength. In this article, we\ndescribe the set-up and the analysis of the measurements, and we present\nresults from student reports. All components are part of standard optical\ncatalogues. Even though the experiment is based on fibered optics, it is robust\nto manipulation (it is however relatively expensive $\\sim \\pounds 15\\,000$): We\ndescribe our efforts to protect the components from damage.\n  This experiment is now offered as a 2-week project for third-year Physics\nstudents. The experiment may likewise be of value in early graduate level\nlaboratory courses.\n", "  The energy-momentum tensor in chiral QCD, $T_{\\mu\\nu}$, exhibits an anomaly,\nviz. $\\Theta_0 :=T_{\\mu\\mu} \\neq 0$. Measured in the proton, this anomaly\nyields $m_p^2$, where $m_p$ is the proton's mass; but, at the same time, when\ncomputed in the pion, the answer is $m_\\pi^2=0$. Any attempt to understand the\norigin and nature of mass, and identify observable expressions thereof, must\nexplain and unify these two apparently contradictory results, which are\nfundamental to the nature of our Universe. Given the importance of\nPoincar\\'e-invariance in modern physics, the utility of a frame-dependent\napproach to this problem seems limited. That is especially true of any approach\ntied to a rest-frame decomposition of $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ because a massless particle\ndoes not possess a rest-frame. On the other hand, the dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking (DCSB) paradigm, connected with a Poincar\\'e-covariant treatment of\nthe continuum bound-state problem, provides a straightforward, simultaneous\nexplanation of both these identities, and also a diverse array of predictions,\ntestable at existing and proposed facilities. From this perspective, $\\langle\n\\pi| \\Theta_0 |\\pi \\rangle =0$ owing to exact, symmetry-driven cancellations\nwhich occur between one-body dressing effects and two-body-irreducible binding\ninteractions in any well-defined computation of the forward scattering\namplitude that defines this expectation value in the pseudoscalar meson. The\ncancellation is incomplete in any other hadronic bound state, with a remainder\nwhose scale is set by the size of one-body dressing effects.\n", "  In this paper we study the near horizon symmetry algebra of the non-extremal\nblack hole solutions of the Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity, which are\nstationary but are not necessarily spherically symmetric. We define the\nextended off-shell ADT current which is an extension of the generalized ADT\ncurrent. We use the extended off-shell ADT current to define quasi-local\nconserved charges such that they are conserved for Killing vectors and\nasymptotically Killing vectors which depend on dynamical fields of the\nconsidered theory. We apply this formalism to the Generalized Minimal Massive\nGravity( GMMG) and obtain conserved charges of a spacetime which describes near\nhorizon geometry of non-extremal black holes. Eventually, we find the algebra\nof conserved charges in Fourier modes. It is interesting that, similar to the\nEinstein gravity in the presence of negative cosmological constant, for the\nGMMG model also we obtain the Heisenberg algebra as the near horizon symmetry\nalgebra of the black flower solutions. Also the vacuum state and all\ndescendants of the vacuum have the same energy. Thus these zero energy\nexcitations on the horizon appear as soft hairs on the black hole.\n", "  The pulsed-field-ionization zero-kinetic-energy photoelectron spectrum of\nH$_2$ has been recorded in the vicinity of the dissociative-ionization\nthreshold following three-photon excitation via selected rotational levels of\nthe B $^1\\Sigma_u^+$ ($v=19$) and $\\bar{\\rm H}$ $^1\\Sigma_g^+$ ($v=11$)\nintermediate states. The spectra consist of transitions to bound levels of the\nX$^+$ $^2\\Sigma_g^+$ state of H$_2^+$ with $v^+$ in the range 14-19 and $N^+$\nin the range 0-9, of the A$^+$ $^2\\Sigma_u^+$ state with $v^+=0$ and $N^+=0-2$,\nand of shape resonances corresponding to the X$^+\\ (v^+=17,N^+=7)$ and X$^+\\\n(v^+=18,N^+=4)$ quasibound levels. Calculations of the level structure of\nH$_2^+$ have been carried out and the influence of adiabatic, nonadiabatic,\nrelativistic and radiative corrections on the positions of these levels, and in\nthe case of the shape resonances also on their widths, has been investigated.\nDifferent methods of calculating the widths and profiles of the shape\nresonances have been tested for comparison with the experimental observations.\nSlow oscillations of the dissociative-ionization yield have been observed and\nreflect, in first approximation, the Franck-Condon factors of the $\\bar{\\text\nH}$ $\\rightarrow$ X$^+$, A$^+$ bound - free transitions.\n", "  We study the geometry of the AGN obscurer in IRAS 09104+4109, an IR-luminous,\nradio-intermediate FR-I source at $z=0.442$, using infrared data from Spitzer\nand Herschel, X-ray data from Nustar, Swift, Suzaku, and Chandra, and an\noptical spectrum from Palomar. The infrared data imply a total rest-frame\n1-1000$\\mu$m luminosity of $5.5\\times10^{46}$erg s$^{-1}$ and require both an\nAGN torus and starburst model. The AGN torus has an anisotropy-corrected IR\nluminosity of $4.9\\times10^{46}$erg s$^{-1}$, and a viewing angle and half\nopening angle both of approximately $36$ degrees from pole-on. The starburst\nhas a star formation rate of $(110\\pm34)$M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and an age of\n$<50$Myr. These results are consistent with two epochs of luminous activity in\n09104: one approximately $150$Myr ago, and one ongoing. The X-ray data suggest\na photon index of $\\Gamma \\simeq 1.8$ and a line-of-sight column of $N_{\\rm H}\n\\simeq 5\\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. This argues against a reflection-dominated\nhard X-ray spectrum, which would have implied a much higher $N_{\\rm H}$ and\nluminosity. The X-ray and infrared data are consistent with a bolometric AGN\nluminosity of $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim(0.5-2.5)\\times10^{47}$erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray\nand infrared data are further consistent with coaligned AGN obscurers in which\nthe line of sight \"skims\" the torus. This is also consistent with the optical\nspectra, which show both coronal iron lines and broad lines in polarized but\nnot direct light. Combining constraints from the X-ray, optical, and infrared\ndata suggests that the AGN obscurer is within a vertical height of $20$pc, and\na radius of $125$pc, of the nucleus.\n", "  Wannier-Mott excitons in a semiconductor layered superlattice (SL) of period\nmuch smaller than the 2D exciton Bohr radius in the presence of a longitudinal\nexternal dc electric field directed parallel to the SL axis are investigated\nanalytically. The exciton states and the optical absorption coefficient are\nderived in the tight-binding and adiabatic approximations. Strong and weak\nelectric fields providing spatially localized and extended electron and hole\nstates, respectively, are studied. The dependencies of the exciton states and\nthe exciton absorption spectrum on the SL parameters and the electric field\nstrength are presented in an explicit form. We focus on the fine structure of\nthe ground quasi-2D exciton level formed by the series of closely spaced energy\nlevels adjacent for higher frequencies. These levels are related to the\nadiabatically slow relative exciton longitudinal motion governed by the\npotential formed by the in-plane exciton state. It is shown that the external\nelectric fields compress the fine structure energy levels, decrease the\nintensities of the corresponding optical peaks and increase the exciton binding\nenergy. A possible experimental study of the fine structure of the exciton\nelectroabsorption is discussed.\n", "  In vitro reconstituted active systems, such as the ATP-driven microtubule\nbundle suspension developed by the Dogic group, provide a fertile testing\nground for elucidating the phenomenology of active liquid crystalline states.\nControlling such novel phases of matter crucially depends on our knowledge of\ntheir material and physical properties. In this letter, we show that the\nrheological properties of an active nematic film can be probed by varying its\nhydrodynamic coupling to a bounding oil layer. Using the motion of\ndisclinations as intrinsic tracers of the flow field and a hydrodynamic model,\nwe obtain an estimate for the as of now unknown shear viscosity of the nematic\nfilm. Knowing this now provides us with an additional handle for robust and\nprecision tunable control of the emergent dynamics of active fluids.\n", "  A generalized scheme for the construction of coherent states in the context\nof position-dependent effective mass systems has been presented. This formalism\nis based on the ladder operators and associated algebra of the system which are\nobtained using the concepts of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the\nproperty of shape-invariance. In order to exemplify the general results and to\nanalyzed the properties of the coherent states, several examples have been\nconsidered.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric and spin thermoelectric\nproperties of a T-shaped double quantum dot strongly coupled to two\nferromagnetic leads, focusing on transport regime where the system exhibits the\ntwo-stage Kondo effect. We study the dependence of the (spin) Seebeck\ncoefficient, the corresponding power factor and the figure of merit on\ntemperature, leads' spin polarization and dot level position. We show that the\nthermal conductance fulfills a modified Wiedemann-Franz law. We also\ndemonstrate that the spin thermopower is enhanced at temperatures corresponding\nto the second stage of Kondo screening. Very interestingly, the\nspin-thermoelectric response of the system is found to be highly sensitive to\nthe spin polarization of the leads. In some cases spin polarization of the\norder of 1% is sufficient for a strong spin Seebeck effect to occur. This is\nexplained as a consequence of the interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect\nand the exchange field induced in the double quantum dot. All calculations are\nperformed with the aid of numerical renormalization group technique.\n", "  High-index Bi2Se3(221) film has been grown on In2Se3-buffered GaAs(001), in\nwhich a much retarded strain relaxation dynamics is recorded. The slow\nstrain-relaxation process of in epitaxial Bi2Se3(221) can be attributed to the\nlayered structure of Bi2Se3 crystal, where the epifilm grown along [221] is\nlike a pile of weakly-coupled quintuple layer slabs stacked side-by-side on\nsubstrate. Finally, we have revealed the strong chemical bonding at the\ninterface of Bi2Se3 and In2Se3 by plotting differential charge contour\ncalculated by first-principle method. This study points to the feasibility of\nachieving strained TIs for manipulating the properties of topological systems.\n", "  We propose a method to efficiently determine the optimal coarse-grained force\nfield in mesoscopic stochastic simulations of Newtonian fluid and polymer melt\nsystems modeled by dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and energy conserving\ndissipative particle dynamics (eDPD). The response surfaces of various target\nproperties (viscosity, diffusivity, pressure, etc.) with respect to model\nparameters are constructed based on the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)\nexpansion using simulation results on sampling points (e.g., individual\nparameter sets). To alleviate the computational cost to evaluate the target\nproperties, we employ the compressive sensing method to compute the\ncoefficients of the dominant gPC terms given the prior knowledge that the\ncoefficients are sparse. The proposed method shows comparable accuracy with the\nstandard probabilistic collocation method (PCM) while it imposes a much weaker\nrestriction on the number of the simulation samples especially for systems with\nhigh dimensional parametric space. Fully access to the response surfaces within\nthe confidence range enables us to infer the optimal force parameters given the\ndesirable values of target properties at the macroscopic scale. Moreover, it\nenables us to investigate the intrinsic relationship between the model\nparameters, identify possible degeneracies in the parameter space, and optimize\nthe model by eliminating model redundancies. The proposed method provides an\nefficient alternative approach for constructing mesoscopic models by inferring\nmodel parameters to recover target properties of the physics systems (e.g.,\nfrom experimental measurements), where those force field parameters and\nformulation cannot be derived from the microscopic level in a straight forward\nway.\n", "  We study the prisoner's dilemma model with a noisy imitation evolutionary\ndynamics on directed out-homogeneous and uncorrelated directed random networks.\nAn heterogeneous pair mean-field approximation is presented showing good\nagreement with Monte Carlo simulations in the limit of weak selection (high\nnoise) where we obtain analytical predictions for the critical temptations. We\ndiscuss the phase diagram as a function of temptation, intensity of noise and\ncoordination number of the networks and we consider both the model with and\nwithout self-interaction. We compare our results with available results for\nnon-directed lattices and networks.\n", "  We measure the full distribution of current fluctuations in a single-electron\ntransistor with a controllable bistability. The conductance switches randomly\nbetween two levels due to the tunneling of single electrons in a separate\nsingle-electron box. The electrical fluctuations are detected over a wide range\nof time scales and excellent agreement with theoretical predictions is found.\nFor long integration times, the distribution of the time-averaged current obeys\nthe large-deviation principle. We formulate and verify a fluctuation relation\nfor the bistable region of the current distribution.\n", "  Electron beam induced deposition (EBID) currently provides the only direct\nwriting technique for truly three-dimensional nanostructures with geometrical\nfeatures below 50 nm. Unfortunately, the depositions from metal-organic\nprecursors suffer from a substantial carbon content. This hinders many\napplications, especially in plasmonics where the metallic nature of the\ngeometric surfaces is mandatory. To overcome this problem a post-deposition\ntreatment with oxygen plasma at room temperature was investigated for the\npurification of gold containing EBID structures. Upon plasma treatment, the\nstructures experience a shrinkage in diameter of about 18 nm but entirely keep\ntheir initial shape. The proposed purification step results in a core-shell\nstructure with the core consisting of mainly unaffected EBID material and a\ngold shell of about 20 nm in thickness. These purified structures are\nplasmonically active in the visible wavelength range as shown by dark field\noptical microscopy on helical nanostructures. Most notably, electromagnetic\nmodeling of the corresponding scattering spectra verified that the thickness\nand quality of the resulting gold shell ensures an optical response equal to\nthat of pure gold nanostructures.\n", "  The complex Langevin method is a promising approach to the complex-action\nproblem based on a fictitious time evolution of complexified dynamical\nvariables under the influence of a Gaussian noise. Although it is known to have\na restricted range of applicability, the use of gauge cooling made it\napplicable to various interesting cases including finite density QCD in certain\nparameter regions. In this paper, we revisit the argument for justification of\nthe method. In particular, we point out a subtlety in the use of time-evolved\nobservables, which play a crucial role in the previous argument. This requires\nthat the probability of the drift term should fall off exponentially or faster\nat large magnitude. We argue that this is actually a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the method to be justified. Using two simple examples, we show\nthat our condition tells us clearly whether the results obtained by the method\nare trustable or not. We also discuss a new possibility for the gauge cooling,\nwhich can reduce the magnitude of the drift term directly.\n", "  Results are presented from searches for R-parity-violating supersymmetry in\nevents produced in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV at the LHC. Final states\nwith 0, 1, 2, or multiple leptons are considered independently. The analysis is\nperformed on data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse femtobarns. No excesses of events above\nthe standard model expectations are observed, and 95% confidence level limits\nare set on supersymmetric particle masses and production cross sections. The\nresults are interpreted in models featuring R-parity-violating decays of the\nlightest supersymmetric particle, which in the studied scenarios can be either\nthe gluino, a bottom squark, or a neutralino. In a gluino pair production model\nwith baryon number violation, gluinos with a mass less than 0.98 and 1.03 TeV\nare excluded, by analyses in a fully hadronic and one-lepton final state,\nrespectively. An analysis in a dilepton final state is used to exclude bottom\nsquarks with masses less than 307 GeV in a model considering bottom squark pair\nproduction. Multilepton final states are considered in the context of either\nstrong or electroweak production of superpartners, and are used to set limits\non the masses of the lightest supersymmetric particles. These limits range from\n300 to 900 GeV in models with leptonic and up to approximately 700 GeV in\nmodels with semileptonic R-parity-violating couplings.\n", "  We propose a complete theoretical description of the tennis racket effect,\nwhich occurs in the free rotation of a three-dimensional rigid body. This\neffect is characterized by a flip ($\\pi$- rotation) of the head of the racket\nwhen a full ($2\\pi$) rotation around the unstable inertia axis is considered.\nWe describe the asymptotics of the phenomenon and conclude about the robustness\nof this effect with respect to the values of the moments of inertia and the\ninitial conditions of the dynamics. This shows the generality of this geometric\nproperty which can be found in a variety of rigid bodies. A simple analytical\nformula is derived to estimate the twisting effect in the general case.\nDifferent examples are discussed.\n", "  Recently the lifetime of the excited $^{2}P_{1/2}$-state of S$^-$ was\nmeasured to be $503\\pm 54$ s (B\\\"ackstr\\\"om et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 143003\n(2015)). The earlier theoretical lifetime of $436$ s was clearly outside the\nexperimental error bars. To investigate this discrepancy we have performed\nsystematic and large-scale multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations\nfor this system. After including a careful treatment of correlation and\nrelativistic effects, we predict a well-converged value of $492$ s for this\nlifetime, with an uncertainty considerably less than 1%, thereby removing the\napparent conflict between theory and experiment. We also show that this result\ncorresponds to the non-relativistic limit in the $LS$-approximation for the M1\ntransition within this $^2P$ term. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the\nlatter approach for $^2P$ transitions in O$^-$, Se$^-$ and Te$^-$, as well as\nfor analogous M1 transitions within $^2D$ terms in Ni$^-$ and Pt$^-$ ions.\n", "  In the problem of matrix compressed sensing we aim to recover a low-rank\nmatrix from few of its element-wise linear projections. In this contribution we\nanalyze the asymptotic performance of a Bayes-optimal inference procedure for a\nmodel where the matrix to be recovered is a product of random matrices. The\nresults that we obtain using the replica method describe the state evolution of\nthe recently introduced P-BiG-AMP algorithm. We show the existence of different\ntypes of phase transitions, their implications for the solvability of the\nproblem, and we compare the results of the theoretical analysis to the\nperformance reached by P-BiG-AMP. Remarkably the asymptotic replica equations\nfor matrix compressed sensing are the same as those for a related but formally\ndifferent problem of matrix factorization.\n", "  In this work we use the quasinormal frequencies of a massless scalar\nperturbation to probe the phase transition of the high dimension charged-AdS\nblack hole. The signature of the critical behavior of this black hole solution\nis detected in the isobaric as well as in isothermal process. This paper is a\nnatural generalization of \\cite{base} to higher dimensional spacetime. More\nprecisely our study shows a clear signal for any dimension $d$ in the isobaric\nprocess. As to the isothermal case, we find out that this signature can be\naffected by other parameters like the pressure and the horizon radius. We\nconclude that the quasinormal modes can be an efficient tool to investigate the\nfirst order phase transition, but fail to disclose the signature of the second\norder phase transition.\n", "  The narrow power decay-length ($\\lambda_q$), recently found in the scrape-off\nlayer (SOL) of inner-wall limited (IWL) discharges in tokamaks, is studied\nusing 3D, flux-driven, global two-fluid turbulence simulations. The formation\nof the steep plasma profiles measured is found to arise due to radially sheared\n$\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ poloidal flows. A complex interaction between sheared\nflows and outflowing plasma currents regulates the turbulent saturation,\ndetermining the transport levels. We quantify the effects of sheared flows,\nobtaining theoretical estimates in agreement with our non-linear simulations.\nAnalytical calculations suggest that the IWL $\\lambda_q$ is roughly equal to\nthe turbulent correlation length.\n", "  We consider the problem of mean-variance portfolio optimization for a generic\ncovariance matrix subject to the budget constraint and the constraint for the\nexpected return, with the application of the replica method borrowed from the\nstatistical physics of disordered systems. We find that the replica symmetry of\nthe solution does not need to be assumed, but emerges as the unique solution of\nthe optimization problem. We also check the stability of this solution and find\nthat the eigenvalues of the Hessian are positive for $r=N/T<1$, where $N$ is\nthe dimension of the portfolio and $T$ the length of the time series used to\nestimate the covariance matrix. At the critical point $r=1$ a phase transition\nis taking place. The out of sample estimation error blows up at this point as\n$1/(1-r)$, independently of the covariance matrix or the expected return,\ndisplaying the universality not only of the critical index, but also the\ncritical point. As a conspicuous illustration of the dangers of in-sample\nestimates, the optimal in-sample variance is found to vanish at the critical\npoint inversely proportional to the divergent estimation error.\n", "  We measure spectrally and spatially resolved high-order harmonics generated\nin argon using chirped multi-cycle laser pulses. Using a stable,\nhigh-repetition rate laser we observe detailed interference structures in the\nfar-field. The structures are of two kinds; off-axis interference from the long\ntrajectory only and on-axis interference including the short and long\ntrajectories. The former is readily visible in the far-field spectrum,\nmodulating both the spectral and spatial profile. To access the latter, we vary\nthe chirp of the fundamental, imparting different phases on the different\ntrajectories, thereby changing their relative phase. Using this method together\nwith an analytical model, we are able to explain the on-axis behaviour and\naccess the dipole phase parameters for the short (\\(\\alpha_s\\)) and long\n(\\(\\alpha_l\\)) trajectories. The extracted results compare very well with phase\nparameters calculated by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nGoing beyond the analytical model, we are also able to successfully reproduce\nthe off-axis interference structure.\n", "  Mirror dark matter, where dark matter resides in a hidden sector exactly\nisomorphic to the standard model, can be probed via direct detection\nexperiments by both nuclear and electron recoils if the kinetic mixing\ninteraction exists. In fact, the kinetic mixing interaction appears to be a\nprerequisite for consistent small scale structure: Mirror dark matter halos\naround spiral galaxies are dissipative - losing energy via dark photon\nemission. This ongoing energy loss requires a substantial energy input, which\ncan be sourced from ordinary supernovae via kinetic mixing induced processes in\nthe supernova's core. Astrophysical considerations thereby give a lower limit\non the kinetic mixing strength, and indeed lower limits on both nuclear and\nelectron recoil rates in direct detection experiments can be estimated. We show\nhere that potentially all of the viable parameter space will be probed in\nforthcoming XENON experiments including LUX and XENON1T. Thus, we anticipate\nthat these experiments will provide a definitive test of the mirror dark matter\nhypothesis.\n", "  The electronic band structure of crystals is generally influenced by the\nperiodic arrangement of their constituent atoms. Specifically, the emerging\ntwo-dimensional (2D) layered structures have shown different band structures\nwith respect to their stacking configurations. Here, based on first-principles\ndensity-functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the band structure\nof the recently synthesized 2D Ca$_2$N electride changes little for the\nstacking sequence as well as the lateral interlayer shift. This intriguing\ninvariance of band structure with respect to geometrical variations can be\nattributed to a complete screening of [Ca$_2$N]$^{+}$ cationic layers by\nanionic excess electrons delocalized between the cationic layers. The resulting\nweak interactions between 2D dressed cationic layers give rise to not only a\nshallow potential barrier for bilayer sliding but also an electron-doping\nfacilitated shear exfoliation. Our findings open a route for exploration of the\npeculiar geometry-insensitive electronic properties in 2D electride materials,\nwhich will be useful for future thermally stable electronic applications.\n", "  Nanomechanical systems made from phononic crystals can act as highly coherent\nmicrowave-frequency circuits at cryogenic temperatures. However, generating\nsufficient coupling between these devices and microwave superconducting quantum\ncircuits is challenging due to the vastly different length scales of acoustic\nand electrical excitations. Here we demonstrate a general recipe for\ncalculating these interactions and show that large piezoelectric coupling rates\nbetween microwave superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions and\nnanoscale phononic resonances are possible, suggesting a route to phononic\ncrystal circuits and systems that are nonlinear at the single-phonon level.\n", "  Hybrid quantum systems can often be described in terms of polaritons. These\nare quasiparticles formed of superpositions of their constituents, with\nrelative weights depending on some control parameter in their interaction. In\nmany cases, these constituents are coupled to reservoirs at different\ntemperatures. This suggests a general approach to the realization of\npolaritonic heat engines where a thermodynamic cycle is realized by tuning this\ncontrol parameter. Here we discuss what is arguably the simplest such engine, a\nsingle qubit coupled to a single photon. We show that this system can extract\nwork from feeble thermal microwave fields. We also propose a quantum\nmeasurement scheme of the work and evaluate its back-action on the operation of\nthe engine.\n", "  Two-particle correlation measurements and analysis are an important component\nof the relativistic heavy-ion physics program. In particular, particle\npair-number correlations on two-dimensional transverse momentum ($p_t$) allow\nunique access to soft, semi-hard and hard-scattering processes in these\ncollisions. Precise measurements of this type of correlation are essential for\nunderstanding the dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. However, transverse\nmomentum correlation measurements are especially vulnerable to statistical and\nsystematic biases. In this paper the origins of these large bias effects are\nexplained and mathematical correlation forms are derived from mean-$p_t$\nfluctuation quantities in the literature. Monte Carlo simulations are then used\nto determine the conditions, e.g. multiplicity and collision centrality bin\nwidths, where each correlation form is minimally biased. The ranges of\napplicability for each correlation quantity are compared. Several are found to\nreproduce the assumed input correlations with reasonable fidelity over a wide\nrange of conditions encountered in practical analysis of data.\n", "  Several experiments on tagged molecules or particles in living systems\nsuggest that they move anomalously slow - their mean squared displacement (MSD)\nincrease slower than linearly with time. Leading models aimed at understanding\nthese experiments predict that the MSD grows as a power law with a growth\nexponent that is smaller than unity. However, in some experiments the exponent\nis so small $(\\sim 0.1-0.2)$ that they hint towards other mechanisms at play.\nIn this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how in-plane collective modes\nexcited by thermal fluctuations in a two dimensional membrane lead to\nlogarithmic time dependence for the mean square displacement of a tracer\nparticle.\n", "  Recent experiments on Mn doped multiferroic $CoCr_{2}O_{4}$ indicate that a\npossible distribution of Mn atoms among tetrahedrally and octahedrally\ncoordinated sites in the spinel lattice give rise to different variations in\nthe structural parameters and saturation magnetisations in different\nconcentration regimes of Mn atoms substituting the Cr. A composition dependent\nmagnetic compensation behaviour points to the role conversions of the magnetic\nconstituents. In this work, we have investigated the thermodynamics of cation\ndisorder in $Co\\left(Cr_{1-x}Mn_{x}\\right)_{2}O_{4}$ system and it's\nconsequences on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties, using\nresults from first-principles electronic structure calculations. We have\ncomputed the variations in the cation-disorder as a function of Mn\nconcentration and the temperature and found that at the annealing temperature\nof the experiment many of the systems exhibit cation disorder. Our results\nsupport the interpretations of the experimental results regarding the\nqualitative variations in the sub-lattice occupancies and the associated\nmagnetisation behaviour, with composition. We have analysed the variations in\nstructural, magnetic and electronic properties of this system with variations\nin the compositions and the degree of cation disorder from the variations in\ntheir electronic structures and by using the ideas from crystal field theory.\nOur study provides a complete microscopic picture of the effects that are\nresponsible for composition dependent behavioural differences of the properties\nof this system. This work lays down a general framework, based upon results\nfrom first-principles calculations, to understand and analyse the\nsubstitutional magnetic spinel oxides $A\\left(B_{1-x}C_{x} \\right)_{2}O_{4}$ in\npresence of cation disorder.\n", "  A calculation of the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in $\\alpha$-quartz using\nthe time-dependent density functional theory is reported. The inter-band\nprocess is attributed to the dominant in HHG above the band gap. The photon\nenergy is set to 1.55 eV, and the cutoff energy of the plateau region is found\nto be limited at the 19th harmonic (30 eV). The dependence of the HHG\nefficiency at the cutoff energy region on laser intensity is consistent with\nthat of the hole density in the lowest-lying valence band. Numerical results\nindicate that electron-hole recombination plays a crucial role in HHG in\n$\\alpha$-quartz. It is found that a 200 attosecond pulse train is produced\nusing HHG around the plateau cutoff energy.\n", "  Integrability is believed to underlie the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence with\nsixteen supercharges. We elucidate the role of massless modes within this\nintegrable framework. Firstly, we find the dressing factors that enter the\nmassless and mixed-mass worldsheet S matrix. Secondly, we derive a set of\nall-loop Bethe Equations for the closed strings, determine their symmetries and\nweak-coupling limit. Thirdly, we investigate the underlying Yangian symmetry in\nthe massless sector and show that it fits into the general framework of Yangian\nintegrability. In addition, we compare our S matrix in the near-relativistic\nlimit with recent perturbative worldsheet calculations of Sundin and Wulff.\n", "  Contributions of a spin 0 axion-like particle (ALP) to lepton dipole moments,\ng-2 and EDMs, are examined. Barr-Zee and light-by-light loop effects from a\nlight pseudoscalar ALP are found to be capable of resolving the long-standing\nmuon g-2 discrepancy at the expense of relatively large ALP-gammagamma\ncouplings. The compatibility of such large couplings with direct experimental\nconstraints and perturbative unitarity bounds is discussed. Future tests of\nsuch a scenario are described. For CP violating ALP couplings, the electron EDM\nis found to probe much smaller, theoretically more easily accommodated ALP\ninteractions. Future planned improvement in electron EDM searches is advocated\nas a way to not only significantly constrain ALP parameters but also, to\npotentially unveil a new source of CP violation which could have far reaching\nramifications.\n", "  We present a highly-parallel multi-frequency hybrid radiation hydrodynamics\nalgorithm that combines a spatially-adaptive long characteristics method for\nthe radiation field from point sources with a moment method that handles the\ndiffuse radiation field produced by a volume-filling fluid. Our Hybrid Adaptive\nRay-Moment Method (HARM$^2$) operates on patch-based adaptive grids, is\ncompatible with asynchronous time stepping, and works with any moment method.\nIn comparison to previous long characteristics methods, we have greatly\nimproved the parallel performance of the adaptive long-characteristics method\nby developing a new completely asynchronous and non-blocking communication\nalgorithm. As a result of this improvement, our implementation achieves\nnear-perfect scaling up to $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ processors on distributed memory\nmachines. We present a series of tests to demonstrate the accuracy and\nperformance of the method.\n", "  In the ionic Hubbard model, the onsite repulsion $U$, which drives a Mott\ninsulator and the ionic potential $V$, which drives a band insulator, compete\nwith each other to open up a window of charge fluctuations when $U \\sim V$. We\nstudy this model on square and cubic lattices in the limit of large $U$ and\n$V$, with $V\\sim U$. Using an effective Hamiltonian and a slave boson approach\nwith both doublons and holes, we find that the system undergoes a phase\ntransition as a function of $V$ from an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator to a\nparamagnetic insulator with strong singlet correlations, which is driven by a\ncondensate of \"neutral\" doublon-hole pairs. On further increasing $V$, the\nsystem undergoes another phase transition to a superconducting phase driven by\ncondensate of \"charged\" doublons and holes. The superfluid phase, characterized\nby presence of coherent (but gapped) fermionic quasiparticle, and $hc/e$ flux\nquantization, has a high $T_c \\sim t $ which shows a dome shaped behaviour as a\nfunction of $V$. The paramagnetic insulator phase has a deconfined U(1) gauge\nfield and associated gapless photon excitations. We also discuss how these\nphases can be detected in the ultracold atom context.\n", "  Mechanical properties of engineering alloys are strongly correlated to their\nmicrostructural length scale. Diffusive insta- bilities of the Mullins-Sekerka\ntype is one of the principal mechanisms through which the scale of the\nmicrostructural features are determined during solidification. In contrast to\nbinary systems, in multicomponent alloys with arbitrary interdiffusivities, the\ngrowth rate as well as the maximally growing wavelengths characterizing these\ninstabilities depend on the the dynamically selected equilibrium tie-lines and\nthe steady state growth velocity. In this study, we derive analytical\nexpressions to characterize the dispersion behavior in isothermally solidified\nmulticomponent (quaternary) alloys for different choices of the\ninter-diffusivity matrices and confirm our calculations using phase-field\nsimulations. Thereafter, we perform controlled studies to capture and isolate\nthe dependence of instability length scales on solute diffusivities and steady\nstate planar front velocities, which leads to an understanding of the process\nof length scale selection during the onset of instability for any alloy\ncomposition with arbitrary diffusivities, comprising of both independent and\ncoupled diffusion of solutes.\n", "  We demonstrate that all gauge instantons in a $d=3+1$ Yang-Mills theory, with\ngeneric topological vacuum charge K, correspond to soliton solutions and kink\nscalar fields in $d=4+1$ space-time.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the decay of Higgs boson to $J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)$\nplus a photon based on NRQCD factorization. For the direct process, we\ncalculate the decay width up to QCD NLO. We find that the decay width for\nprocess $H \\to J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)+ \\gamma$ direct production at the LO is\nsignificantly reduced by the NLO QCD corrections. For the indirect process, we\ncalculate the $H \\to \\gamma^\\ast\\gamma$ with virtual $\\gamma$ substantially\ndecaying to $J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)$, including all the SM Feynman diagrams. The\ndecay width of indirect production is much larger than the direct decay width.\nSince it is very clean in experiment, the $H \\to J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)+ \\gamma$\ndecay could be observable at a 14 TeV LHC and it also offers a new way to probe\nthe Yukawa coupling and New Physics at the LHC.\n", "  Unprecedentedly massive electrorheology has been reported for dilute graphene\nnanoflakes based ER fluids that have been engineered as novel, readily\nsynthesizable polymeric gels. Polyethylene glycol based graphene gels have been\nsynthesized and very high ER response, 25,000 percent enhancement in viscosity\nunder influence of electric field, has been observed for low concentration\nsystems 2 wt. percent. The gels overcome several drawbacks innate to ER fluids.\nThe gels exhibit long term stability, high graphene packing ratio which ensures\nvery high ER response and the microstructure of the gels ensure that\nfibrillation of the graphene nanoflakes under field is undisturbed by thermal\nfluctuations, further leading to mega ER. The gels exhibit large yield stress\nhandling caliber with yield stress observed as high as 13 kPa at 2 wt. perc.\ngraphene. Detailed investigations on the effects of graphene concentration,\nelectric field strength, imposed shear resistance and transients of electric\nfield actuation on the ER response of the gels have been performed. The gels\nshow nearly negligible hysteresis with respect to electro viscous effects which\nspeak of the stability and responsiveness required in transient situations.\nIndepth analyses with explanations have been provided for the observations and\neffects, such as sheet over-crowding induced loss of structural integrity at\nhigh concentrations and inter flake lubrication or slip induced augmented ER\nresponse. The present gels show great promise as potential ER gels for variant\nsmart applications, such as damping and vibration control in active aircraft\nand vehicle structures, micronanoscale electroactuation, in suspensions or\nbraking clutching in high performance specialized vehicular systems, etc.\n", "  We generalize the multiband typical medium dynamical cluster approximation\nand the formalism introduced by Blackman, Esterling and Berk so that it can\ndeal with localization in multiband disordered systems with both diagonal and\noff-diagonal disorder with complicated potentials. We also introduce a new\nansatz for the angle resolved typical density of states that greatly improves\nthe numerical stability of the method while preserving the independence of\nscattering events at different frequencies. Starting from the first-principles\neffective Hamiltonian, we apply this method to the diluted magnetic\nsemiconductor Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N, and find the impurity band is completely\nlocalized for Mn concentrations $x<0.03$ while for $0.03 <x<0.10$ the impurity\nband has delocalized states but the chemical potential resides at or above the\nmobility edge. So, the system is always insulating within the experimental\ncompositional limit ($x\\approx 0.10$) due to Anderson localization. However,\nfor $0.03 <x<0.10$ hole doping could make the system metallic allowing double\nexchange mediated, or enhanced, ferromagnetism. The developed method is\nexpected to have a large impact on first-principles studies of Anderson\nlocalization.\n", "  Self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has proven to be a powerful tool for\nmodeling equilibrium microstructures of soft materials, particularly for\nmultiblock polymers. A very successful approach to numerically solving the SCFT\nset of equations is based on using a spectral approach. While widely\nsuccessful, this approach has limitations especially in the context of current\ntechnologically relevant applications. These limitations include non-trivial\napproaches for modeling complex geometries, difficulties in extending to\nnon-periodic domains, as well as non-trivial extensions for spatial adaptivity.\nAs a viable alternative to spectral schemes, we develop a finite element\nformulation of the SCFT paradigm for calculating equilibrium polymer\nmorphologies. We discuss the formulation and address implementation challenges\nthat ensure accuracy and efficiency. We explore higher order chain contour\nsteppers that are efficiently implemented with Richardson Extrapolation. This\napproach is highly scalable and suitable for systems with arbitrary shapes. We\nshow spatial and temporal convergence and illustrate scaling on up to 2048\ncores. Finally, we illustrate confinement effects for selected complex\ngeometries. This has implications for materials design for nanoscale\napplications where dimensions are such that equilibrium morphologies\ndramatically differ from the bulk phases.\n", "  Uncertainties of fission fraction is an important uncertainty source for the\nantineutrino flux prediction in a reactor antineutrino experiment. A new\nMC-based method of evaluating the covariance coefficients between isotopes was\nproposed. It was found that the covariance coefficients will varying with\nreactor burnup and which may change from positive to negative because of\nfissioning balance effect, for example, the covariance coefficient between\n$^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu changes from 0.15 to -0.13. Using the equation between\nfission fraction and atomic density, the consistent of uncertainty of fission\nfraction and the covariance matrix were obtained. The antineutrino flux\nuncertainty is 0.55\\% which does not vary with reactor burnup, and the new\nvalue is about 8.3\\% smaller.\n", "  Nematic liquid crystals exhibit both crystal-like and fluid-like features. In\nparticular, the propagation of an acoustic wave shows an unexpected occurrence\nof some of the solid-like features at the hydrodynamic level, namely, the\nfrequency-dependent anisotropy of sound velocity and acoustic attenuation. The\nnon-Newtonian behavior of nematics also emerges from the frequency-dependent\nviscosity coefficients. To account for these phenomena, we put forward a\nviscoelastic model of nematic liquid crystals, and we extend our previous\ntheory to fully include the combined effects of compressibility, anisotropic\nelasticity and dynamic relaxation, at any shear rate. The low-frequency limit\nagrees with the compressible Ericksen-Leslie theory, while at intermediate\nfrequencies the model correctly captures the relaxation mechanisms underlying\nfinite shear and bulk elastic moduli. We show that there are only four\nrelaxation times allowed by the uniaxial symmetry.\n", "  Molecular Dynamic and Monte Carlo studies are performed in a family of\ncore-softened (CS) potential, composed by two length scales: a repulsive\nshoulder at short distances and the another a variable scale, that can be\nrepulsive or strongly attractive depending on the parameters used. The density,\ndiffusion and structural anomalous regions in the pressure versus temperature\nphase diagram shrink in pressure as the system becomes more attractive. The\nliquid-liquid transition appears as a consequence of the non monotonic behavior\nof the density versus pressure isotherms with the increase of the attraction\nwell. We found that the liquid-gas phase transition is Ising-like for all the\nCS potentials and its critical temperature increases with the increase of the\nattraction. No Ising-like behavior for the liquid-liquid phase transition was\ndetected in the Monte Carlo simulations what might be due to the presence of\nstable solid phases.\n", "  We study the production of forward di-jets in proton-lead and proton-proton\ncollisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Such configurations, with both jets\nproduced in the forward direction, impose a dilute-dense asymmetry which allows\nto probe the gluon density of the lead or proton target at small longitudinal\nmomentum fractions. Even though the jet momenta are always much bigger than the\nsaturation scale of the target, $Q_s$, the transverse momentum imbalance of the\ndi-jet system may be either also much larger than $Q_s$, or of the order $Q_s$,\nimplying that the small-$x$ QCD dynamics involved is either linear or\nnon-linear, respectively. The small-$x$ improved TMD factorization framework\ndeals with both situation in the same formalism. In the latter case, which\ncorresponds to nearly back-to-back jets, we find that saturation effects induce\na significant suppression of the forward di-jet azimuthal correlations in\nproton-lead versus proton-proton collisions.\n", "  The Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi (SRJ) method is an extension of the classical\nJacobi iterative method to solve linear systems of equations ($Au=b$)\nassociated with elliptic problems. It inherits its robustness and accelerates\nits convergence rate computing a set of $P$ relaxation factors that result from\na minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is\nemployed in cycles of $M$ consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance\nis reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation\nfactors for the case in which all of them are different, and find that the\nresulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's\nmethod. Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit\ncomputation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ is\nreplaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum\nfrequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis. This set of weights is also\noptimal for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all\npossible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure. We also show that with the set\nof weights computed for the optimal SRJ scheme for a fixed cycle size it is\npossible to estimate numerically the optimal value of the parameter $\\omega$ in\nthe Successive Overtaxation (SOR) method in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate\nwith practical examples that our method also works very well for Poisson-like\nproblems in which a high-order discretization of the Laplacian operator is\nemployed. This is of interest since the former discretizations do not yield\nconsistently ordered $A$ matrices. Furthermore, the optimal SRJ schemes here\ndeduced, are advantageous over existing SOR implementations for high-order\ndiscretizations of the Laplacian operator in as much as they do not need to\nresort to multi-coloring schemes for their parallel implementation. (abridged)\n", "  We present a derivation of the adiabatic energy relations as well as the\nlarge momentum distribution of a polarized Fermi gas near p-wave Feshbach\nresonances. The leading asymptotic behavior ($k^{-2}$) and subleading behavior\n($k^{-4}$) of the large momentum distribution have recently been predicted by\nYu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 135304 (2015)] and by He et al. [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 116, 045301 (2016)] using two different approaches. Here, we show that\nthe subleading asymptotic behavior ($\\sim k^{-4}$) can not fully be captured by\nthe contact defined from the adiabatic energy relation related to the p-wave\neffective range, and there should be an extra term resulted from the\ncenter-of-mass motion of the pairs. The omission of this extra term is perhaps\na reasonable approximation at zero temperature. However, it should be taken\ninto account at finite temperature and should be of significant importance to\nunderstand the recently measured momentum distribution in a resonant p-wave\nFermi gas of ultracold $^{40}$K atoms [Luciuk et al., Nature Phys. 12, 599\n(2016)].\n", "  We study the production of $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda \\text{n}}$\nexotic states in central Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV at LHC\nvia both hadron and quark coalescence within a covariant coalescence model with\na blast-wave-like parametrization for the phase-space configurations of\nconstituent particles at freezeout. In the hadron coalescence, the two states\nare considered as molecular states while they are considered as six-quark\nstates in the quark coalescence.For $\\overline{\\Lambda \\text{n}}$, we find that\nthe yields of both molecular and six-quark states are much larger than the\nexperimental upper-limits. For $\\Lambda\\Lambda$, while the molecule-state yield\nis much larger than the experimental upper-limits, the six-quark-state yield\ncould be lower than the upper-limits. The higher molecule-state yields are\nmainly due to the large contribution of short-lived strong resonance decays\ninto (anti-)nucleons and (anti-)$\\Lambda$ which can significantly enhance the\nmolecule-state yields of $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda \\text{n}}$ via\nhadron coalescence. Our results suggest that the current experimental\nmeasurement at LHC cannot exclude the existence of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ as an\nexotic six-quark state, and if $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ is a six-quark state, it is\nthen on the brink of being discovered.\n", "  By cross-correlating both the Parkes Catalogue and the Second Planck\nCatalogue of Compact Sources with the arrival direction of the track-type\nneutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we find the\nflat-spectrum blazar PKS 0723-008 as a good candidate for the high-energy\nneutrino event 5 (ID5). Apart from its coordinates matching those of ID5, PKS\n0723-008 exhibits further interesting radio properties. Its spectrum is flat up\nto high Planck frequencies, and it produced a fivefold-increased radio flux\ndensity through the last decade. Based upon these radio properties we propose a\nscenario of binary black hole evolution leading to the observed high-energy\nneutrino emission. The main contributing events are the spin-flip of the\ndominant black hole, the formation of a new jet with significant particle\nacceleration and interaction with the surrounding material, with the\ncorresponding increased radio flux. Doppler boosting from the underlying jet\npointing to the Earth makes it possible to identify the origin of the\nneutrinos, so the merger itself is the form of an extended flat-spectrum radio\nemission, a key selection criterion to find traces of this complex process.\n", "  We study the quark mass dependence of the H-dibaryon in the strangeness\n$S=-2$ baryon-baryon scattering. A low-energy effective field theory is used to\ndescribe the coupled-channel scattering, in which the quark mass dependence is\nincorporated so as to reproduce the lattice QCD data by the HAL QCD\ncollaboration in the SU(3) limit. We point out the existence of the\nCastillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole in the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ scattering amplitude\nbelow the threshold in the SU(3) limit, which may cause the Ramsauer-Townsend\neffect near the $N\\Xi$ threshold at the physical point. The H-dibaryon is\nunbound at the physical point, and a resonance appears just below the $N\\Xi$\nthreshold. As a consequence of the coupled-channel dynamics, the pole\nassociated with the resonance is not continuously connected to the bound state\nin the SU(3) limit. Through the extrapolation in quark masses, we show that the\nunitary limit of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ scattering is achieved between the\nphysical point and the SU(3) limit. We discuss the possible realization of the\n\"H-matter\" in the unphysical quark mass region.\n", "  In this article we perform a critical assessment of different known methods\nfor the analytical continuation of bosonic functions, namely the maximum\nentropy method, the non-negative least-square method, the non-negative Tikhonov\nmethod, the Pad\\'e approximant method, and a stochastic sampling method. Three\nfunctions of different shape are investigated, corresponding to three\nphysically relevant scenarios. They include a simple two-pole model function\nand two flavours of the non-interacting Hubbard model on a square lattice, i.e.\na single-orbital metallic system and a two-orbitals insulating system. The\neffect of numerical noise in the input data on the analytical continuation is\ndiscussed in detail. Overall, the stochastic method by Mishchenko et al. [Phys.\nRev. B \\textbf{62}, 6317 (2000)] is shown to be the most reliable tool for\ninput data whose numerical precision is not known. For high precision input\ndata, this approach is slightly outperformed by the Pad\\'e approximant method,\nwhich combines a good resolution power with a good numerical stability.\nAlthough none of the methods retrieves all features in the spectra in the\npresence of noise, our analysis provides a useful guideline for obtaining\nreliable information of the spectral function in cases of practical interest.\n", "  Reliably predicting bit-error rates in realistic heat-assisted magnetic\nrecording simulations is a challenging task. Integrating the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation can reduce the computational effort to\ndetermine the magnetization dynamics in the vicinity of the Curie temperature.\nIf one aims that these dynamics coincide with trajectories calculated from the\natomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, one has to carefully model required\ntemperature dependent material functions such as the zero-field equilibrium\nmagnetization as well as the parallel and normal susceptibilities. We present\nan extensive study on how these functions depend on grain size and exchange\ninteractions. We show that, if the size or the exchange constant of a reference\ngrain is modified, the material functions can be scaled, according to the\nchanged Curie temperature, yielding negligible errors. This is shown to be\nvalid for volume changes of up to $\\pm 40$ % and variations of the exchange\nconstant of up to $\\pm10$ %. Besides the temperature dependent material curves,\ncomputed switching probabilities also agree well with probabilities separately\ndetermined for each system. Our study suggest that there is no need to\nrecalculate the required LLB input functions for each particle. Within the\npresented limits it is sufficient to scale them to the Curie temperature of the\naltered system.\n", "  When the collective coupling of the rovibrational states in organic molecules\nand confined electromagnetic modes is sufficiently strong, the system enters\ninto vibrational strong coupling, leading to the formation of hybrid\nlight-matter quasiparticles. In this work we demonstrate theoretically how this\nhybridization in combination with stimulated Raman scattering can be utilized\nto widen the capabilities of Raman laser devices. We explore the conditions\nunder which the lasing threshold can be diminished and the system can be\ntransformed into an optical parametric oscillator. Finally, we show how the\ndramatic reduction of the many final molecular states into two collective\nexcitations can be used to create an all-optical switch with output in the\nmid-infrared.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the spin-dipole (SD) polarizability and of\nthe frequency of the SD oscillation of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate\nof sodium atoms occupying the $|3^2S_{1/2}, F=1, m_F=\\pm1\\rangle$ hyperfine\nstates. This binary spin-mixture presents the important properties of being, at\nthe same time, fully miscible and rid of the limit set by buoyancy. It is also\ncharacterized by a huge enhancement of the SD polarizability and by the\nconsequent softening of the frequency of the SD oscillation, due to the\nvicinity to the transition to the immiscible phase. The experimental data are\nsuccessfully compared with the predictions of theory.\n", "  We study discrete breathers in prototypical nonlinear oscillator networks\nsubjected to non-harmonic zero-mean periodic excitations. We show how the\ngeneration of stationary and moving discrete breathers are optimally controlled\nby solely varying the impulse transmitted by the periodic excitations, while\nkeeping constant the excitation's amplitude and period. Our theoretical and\nnumerical results show that the enhancer effect of increasing values of the\nexcitation's impulse, in the sense of facilitating the generation of stationary\nand moving breathers, is due to a correlative increase of the breather's action\nand energy.\n", "  We revisit models where a heavy chiral 4th generation doublet of fermions is\nembedded in a class of two Higgs doublets models (2HDM) with a discrete $Z_2$\nsymmetry, which couples the \"heavy\" scalar doublet only to the 4th generation\nfermions and the \"light\" one to the Standard Model (SM) fermions - the\nso-called 4G2HDM introduced by us several years ago. We study the constraints\nimposed on the 4G2HDM from direct searches of heavy fermions, from precision\nelectroweak data (PEWD) and from the measured production and decay signals of\nthe 125 GeV scalar, which in the 4G2HDM corresponds to the lightest CP-even\nscalar h. We then show that the recently reported excess in the $\\gamma\\gamma$\nspectrum around 750 GeV can be accommodated by the heavy CP-even scalar of the\n4G2HDM, H, resulting in a unique choice of parameter space: negligible mixing\n(sin\\alpha ~ O(0.001)) between the two CP-even scalars h,H and heavy 4th\ngeneration quark and lepton masses m_t',m_b' < 400 GeV and $m_{\\nu'},m_{\\tau'}$\n> 900 GeV, respectively. Whether or not the 750 GeV \\gamma \\gamma resonance is\nconfirmed, interesting phenomenology emerges in q' - Higgs systems (q'=t',b'),\nthat can be searched for at the LHC. For example, the heavy scalar states of\nthe model, S=H,A,H^+, may have BR(S -> q'q') ~ O(1), giving rise to observable\nq'q' signals on resonance, followed by the flavor changing q' decays t'->uh\n(u=u,c) and/or b'->dh (d=d,s,b). This leads to distinct high jet-multiplicity\nsignatures, with or without charged leptons, of the form q'q' -> (nj + mb +\nlW)_S (j and b being light and b-quark jets, respectively), with n+m+l =6-8 and\nunique kinematic features. It is also shown that the 4G2HDM can easily\naccommodate the interesting recent indications of a percent-level branching\nratio in the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) decay $h \\to \\tau \\mu$ of the 125\nGeV Higgs, if confirmed.\n", "  We propose a new method to search for hypothetical scalar particles that have\nfeeble interactions with Standard-Model particles. In the presence of massive\nbodies, these interactions produce a non-zero Yukawa-type scalar-field\nmagnitude. Using radio-frequency spectroscopy data of atomic dysprosium, as\nwell as atomic clock spectroscopy data, we constrain the Yukawa-type\ninteractions of a scalar field with the photon, electron, and nucleons for a\nrange of scalar-particle masses corresponding to length scales $ > 10$ cm. In\nthe limit as the scalar-particle mass $m_\\phi \\to 0$, our derived limits on the\nYukawa-type interaction parameters are: $\\Lambda_\\gamma \\gtrsim 8 \\times\n10^{19}$ GeV, $\\Lambda_e \\gtrsim 1.3 \\times 10^{19}$ GeV, and $\\Lambda_N\n\\gtrsim 6 \\times 10^{20}$ GeV. Our measurements also constrain combinations of\ninteraction parameters, which cannot otherwise be probed with traditional\nanomalous-force measurements. We suggest further measurements to improve on the\ncurrent level of sensitivity.\n", "  We construct the string duals of the defect theories generated when N_f\nflavor D5-branes intersect N_c color D3-branes along a 2+1 dimensional\nsubspace. We work in the Veneziano limit in which N_c and N_f are large and\nN_f/N_c is fixed. By smearing the D5-branes, we find supergravity solutions\nthat take into account the backreaction of the flavor branes and preserve two\nsupercharges. When the flavors are massless the resulting metric displays an\nanisotropic Lifshitz-like scale invariance. The case of massive quarks is also\nconsidered.\n", "  We present a new scheme for controlling the quantum state of a harmonic\noscillator by coupling it to an anharmonic multilevel system (MLS) with first\nto second excited state transition frequency on-resonance with the oscillator.\nIn this scheme that we call \"ef-resonant\", the spurious oscillator Kerr\nnon-linearity inherited from the MLS is very small, while its Fock states can\nstill be selectively addressed via an MLS transition at a frequency that\ndepends on the number of photons. We implement this concept in a circuit-QED\nsetup with a microwave 3D cavity (the oscillator, with frequency 6.4 GHz and\nquality factor QO=2E-6) embedding a frequency tunable transmon qubit (the MLS).\nWe characterize the system spectroscopically and demonstrate selective\naddressing of Fock states and a Kerr non-linearity below 350 Hz. At times much\nlonger than the transmon coherence times, a non-linear cavity response with\ndriving power is also observed and explained.\n", "  Recently, Tao and Mo (TM) derived a meta-generalized gradient approximation\nfunctional based on a model exchange-correlation hole. In this work, the\nperformance of this functional is assessed on standard test sets, using the\n6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set. These test sets include 223 G3/99 enthalpies of\nformation, 99 atomization energies, 76 barrier heights, 58 electron affinities,\n8 proton affinities, 96 bond lengths, 82 harmonic vibrational frequencies, 10\nhydrogen-bonded molecular complexes, and 22 atomic excitation energies. Our\ncalculations show that the TM functional can achieve high accuracy for most\nproperties considered, relative to the LSDA, PBE, and TPSS functionals. In\nparticular, it yields the best accuracy for proton affinities, harmonic\nvibrational frequencies, hydrogen-bonded dissociation energies and bond\nlengths, and atomic excitation energies.\n", "  We calculated the phase diagram of the Kondo-Heisenberg model on\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb lattice with both nearest-neighbor and\nnext-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic spin exchanges, to investigate the\ninterplay between RKKY and Kondo interactions at presence of magnetic\nfrustration. Within a mean-field decoupling technology in slave-fermion\nrepresentation, we derived the zero-temperature phase diagram as a function of\nKondo coupling $J_k$ and frustration strength $Q$. The geometrical frustration\ncan destroy the magnetic order, driving the original antiferromagnetic (AF)\nphase to non-magnetic valence bond state (VBS). In addition, we found two\ndistinct VBS. As $J_k$ is increased, a phase transition from AF to Kondo\nparamagnetic (KP) phase occurs, without the intermediate phase coexisting AF\norder with Kondo screening found in square lattice systems. In the KP phase,\nthe enhancement of frustration weakens the Kondo screening effect, resulting in\na phase transition from KP to VBS. We also found a process to recover the AF\norder from VBS by increasing $J_k$ in a wide range of frustration strength. Our\nwork may provide deeper understanding for the phase transitions in\nheavy-fermion materials, particularly for those exhibiting triangular\nfrustration.\n", "  We experimentally squeeze the thermal motional state of an optically\nlevitated nanosphere, by fast switching between two trapping frequencies. The\nmeasured phase space distribution of our particle shows the typical shape of a\nsqueezed thermal state, from which we infer up to 2.7dB of squeezing along one\nmotional direction. The experiment features a large number of thermal\nexcitations, therefore remaining in the classical regime. Nevertheless, we\nargue that the manipulation scheme described here could be used to achieve\nsqueezing below the zero-point level, if preceded by ground state cooling of\nthe levitated mechanical oscillator. Additionally, a higher degree of squeezing\ncould in principle be achieved by repeating the frequency-switching protocol\nmultiple times.\n", "  We study torsional rigidity for graph and quantum graph analogs of well-known\npairs of isospectral non-isometric planar domains. We prove that such\nisospectral pairs are distinguished by torsional rigidity.\n", "  The results of accurate quantum reactive scattering calculations for the D +\nHD($v=4$, $j=0$) $\\to$ D + HD($v'$, $j'$), D + HD($v=4$, $j=0$) $\\to$ H +\nD$_2$($v'$, $j'$) and H + D$_2$($v=4$, $j=0$) $\\to$ D + HD($v'$,$j'$) reactions\nare presented for collision energies between $1\\,\\mu{\\rm K}$ and $100\\,{\\rm\nK}$. The ${\\it ab\\ initio}$ BKMP2 PES for the ground electronic state of H$_3$\nis used and all values of total angular momentum between $J=0-4$ are included.\nThe general vector potential approach is used to include the geometric phase.\nThe rotationally resolved, vibrationally resolved, and total reaction rate\ncoefficients are reported as a function of collision energy. Rotationally\nresolved differential cross sections are also reported as a function of\ncollision energy and scattering angle. Large geometric phase effects appear in\nthe ultracold reaction rate coefficients which result in a significant\nenhancement or suppression of the rate coefficient (up to $3$ orders of\nmagnitude) relative to calculations which ignore the geometric phase. The\nresults are interpreted using a new quantum interference mechanism which is\nunique to ultracold collisions. Significant effects of the geometric phase also\nappear in the rotationally resolved differential cross sections which lead to a\nvery different oscillatory structure in both energy and scattering angle.\nSeveral shape resonances occur in the $1$ - $10\\,{\\rm K}$ energy range and the\ngeometric phase is shown to significantly alter the predicted resonance\nspectrum. The geometric phase effects depend sensitively on the nuclear spin\nwhich may provide experimentalists with the ability to control the reaction by\nthe selection of a particular nuclear spin state.\n", "  Dissipative quantum systems are frequently described within the framework of\nthe so-called \"system-plus-reservoir\" approach. In this work we assign their\ndescription to the Maximum Entropy Formalism and compare the resulting\nthermodynamic properties with those of the well - established approaches. Due\nto the non-negligible coupling to the heat reservoir, these systems are\nnon-extensive by nature, and the former task may require the use of\nnon-extensive parameter dependent informational entropies. In doing so, we\naddress the problem of choosing appropriate forms of those entropies in order\nto describe a consistent thermodynamics for dissipative quantum systems.\nNevertheless, even having chosen the most successful and popular forms of those\nentropies, we have proven our model to be a counterexample where this sort of\napproach leads us to wrong results.\n", "  The chiral anomaly is based on a non-conserved chiral charge and can happen\nin Dirac fermion systems under the influence of external electromagnetic\nfields. In this case, the spectral flow leads to a transfer of right- to\nleft-moving excitations or vice versa. The corresponding transfer of chiral\nparticles happens in momentum space. We here describe an intriguing way to\nintroduce the chiral anomaly into real space. Our system consists of two\nquantum dots that are formed at the helical edge of a quantum spin Hall\ninsulator on the basis of three magnetic impurities. Such a setup gives rise to\nfractional charges which we show to be sharp quantum numbers for large barrier\nstrength. Interestingly, it is possible to map the system onto a quantum spin\nHall ring in the presence of a flux pierced through the ring where the relative\nangle between the magnetization directions of the impurities takes the role of\nthe flux. The chiral anomaly in this system is then directly related to the\nexcess occupation of particles in the two quantum dots. This analogy allows us\nto predict an observable consequence of the chiral anomaly in real space.\n", "  For generic Hamiltonian systems we derive predictions for dynamical tunneling\nfrom regular to chaotic phase-space regions. In contrast to previous\napproaches, we account for the resonance-assisted enhancement of\nregular-to-chaotic tunneling in a non-perturbative way. This provides the\nfoundation for future semiclassical complex-path evaluations of\nresonance-assisted regular-to-chaotic tunneling. Our approach is based on a new\nclass of integrable approximations which mimic the regular phase-space region\nand its dominant nonlinear resonance chain in a mixed regular--chaotic system.\nWe illustrate the method for the standard map.\n", "  In the context of a U(1) gauge theory non-minimally coupled to scalar-tensor\ngravity, we find a cosmological attractor solution that represents a de Sitter\nuniverse with a homogeneous magnetic field. The solution fully takes into\naccount backreaction of the magnetic field to the geometry and the scalar\nfield. Such a solution is made possible by scaling-type global symmetry and\nfine-tuning of two parameters of the theory. If the fine-tuning is relaxed then\nthe solution is deformed to an axisymmetric Bianchi type-I universe with\nconstant curvature invariants, a homogeneous magnetic field and a homogeneous\nelectric field. Implications to inflationary magnetogenesis are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Within the framework of the dinuclear system (DNS) model, the fusion\nreactions leading to the compound nuclei 274Hs and 286Cn are investigated. The\nfusion probability as a function of DNS excitation energy is studied. The\ncalculated results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.\nThe obtained results show that the fusion probabilities are obviously enhanced\nfor the reactions located at high place in potential energy surface, although\nthese reactions may have small values of mass asymmetry. It is found that the\nenhancement is due to the large potential energy of the initial DNS.\n", "  In this work we study the issue of gauge anomalies in Lorentz-violating QED.\nTo do so, we opt to use the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin formalism within the\nalgebraic renormalization approach, reducing our study to a cohomology problem.\nSince this approach is independent of the renormalization scheme, the results\nobtained here are expected to be general. We find that the Lorentz-violating\nQED is free of gauge anomalies to all orders in perturbation theory.\n", "  Binary neutron star mergers are promising sources of gravitational waves for\nground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO. Neutron-rich material ejected by\nthese mergers may also be the main source of r-process elements in the\nUniverse, while radioactive decays in the ejecta can power bright\nelectromagnetic post-merger signals. Neutrino-matter interactions play a\ncritical role in the evolution of the composition of the ejected material,\nwhich significantly impacts the outcome of nucleosynthesis and the properties\nof the associated electromagnetic signal. In this work, we present a simulation\nof a binary neutron star merger using an improved method for estimating the\naverage neutrino energies in our energy-integrated neutrino transport scheme.\nThese energy estimates are obtained by evolving the neutrino number density in\naddition to the neutrino energy and flux densities. We show that significant\nchanges are observed in the composition of the polar ejecta when comparing our\nnew results with earlier simulations in which the neutrino spectrum was assumed\nto be the same everywhere in optically thin regions. In particular, we find\nthat material ejected in the polar regions is less neutron rich than previously\nestimated. Our new estimates of the composition of the polar ejecta make it\nmore likely that the color and timescale of the electromagnetic signal depend\non the orientation of the binary with respect to an observer's line-of-sight.\nThese results also indicate that important observable properties of neutron\nstar mergers are sensitive to the neutrino energy spectrum, and may need to be\nstudied through simulations including a more accurate, energy-dependent\nneutrino transport scheme.\n", "  Metastable CP-odd domains of the hot QCD matter are coupled to QED via the\nchiral anomaly. The topology of electromagnetic field in these domains is\ncharacterized by magnetic helicity. It is argued, using the\nMaxwell-Chern-Simons model, that spatial inhomogeneity of the domains induces\nspontaneous transitions of electromagnetic field between the opposite magnetic\nhelicity states.\n", "  We revisit the thermodynamic behavior of the random-anisotropy O($N$) model\nby investigating its large-$N$ limit. We focus on the system at zero\ntemperature where the mean-field-like artifacts of the large-$N$ limit are less\nsevere. We analyze the connection between the description in terms of\nself-consistent Schwinger-Dyson equations and the functional renormalization\ngroup. We provide a unified description of the phase diagram and critical\nbehavior of the model and clarify the nature of the possible \"glassy\" phases.\nFinally we discuss the implications of our findings for the finite-$N$ and\nfinite-temperature systems.\n", "  This review provides an introduction to the radio emission by particle\ncascades, an overview on the various experiments, and explains methods for the\nradio measurement of air-shower properties. Furthermore, potential applications\nof the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed. Due\nto the successful operation of digital radio experiments and due to the\nimproved quantitative understanding of the emission, radio detection is back on\nthe list of promising techniques for extensive air showers. With a threshold of\nabout 100 PeV radio detectors are particularly useful to study the\nhighest-energy galactic cosmic rays and ultra-high-energy extragalactic\nparticles of all types. Various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA,\nLOFAR, and Tunka-Rex have shown that radio measurements can compete in\nprecision with other techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the\nenergy, and the position of the shower maximum. The scientific potential of the\nradio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors,\nwhich increases the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This is crucial\nfor a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons,\nneutrinos, or different types of nuclei. In addition to air-showers the radio\ntechnique can be used for particle cascades in dense media. Several pioneering\nexperiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for cascades\ninduced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos in ice. Moreover, several future\nprojects aim at both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search\nfor neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and\nprovide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Finally, radio\ndetectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD, or EVA are being considered to\nstudy the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos.\n", "  The scattering equations give striking formulae for massless scattering\namplitudes at tree level and, as shown recently, at one loop. The progress at\nloop level was based on ambitwistor string theory, which naturally yields the\nscattering equations. We proposed that, for ambitwistor strings, the standard\nloop expansion in terms of the genus of the worldsheet is equivalent to an\nexpansion in terms of nodes of a Riemann sphere, with the nodes carrying the\nloop momenta. In this paper, we show how to obtain two-loop scattering\nequations with the correct factorization properties. We adapt genus-two\nintegrands from the ambitwistor string to the nodal Riemann sphere and show\nthat these yield correct answers, by matching standard results for the\nfour-point two-loop amplitudes of maximal supergravity and super-Yang-Mills\ntheory. In the Yang-Mills case, this requires the loop analogue of the\nParke-Taylor factor carrying the colour dependence, which includes non-planar\ncontributions.\n", "  It is well known that diverse pieces of models and physical ideas coming from\ndifferent areas of physics converged in the BCS theory of superconductivity. On\nthe contrary it is little known that the formalism developed in the Tomonaga\nquantum field theory of the pion-nucleon system was an important ingredient for\nthe development of BCS theory. We discuss the evolution of these ideas in\nquantum field theory providing an unconventional historical perspective.\n", "  We present semi-analytic techniques for finding bubble wall profiles during\nfirst order phase transitions with multiple scalar fields. Our method involves\nreducing the problem to an equation with a single field, finding an analytic\nsolution and perturbing around it. The perturbations can be written in a\nsemi-analytic form. We argue that our technique lacks convergence problems and\ndemonstrate the speed of convergence on an example potential.\n", "  We investigate valley dynamics associated with trions in monolayer tungsten\ndiselenide (WSe2) using polarization resolved two-color pump-probe\nspectroscopy. When tuning the pump and probe energy across the trion resonance,\ndistinct trion valley polarization dynamics are observed as a function of\nenergy and attributed to the intra-valley and inter-valley trions in monolayer\nWSe2. We observe no decay of a near-unity valley polarization associated with\nthe intra-valley trions during ~ 25 ps, while the valley polarization of the\ninter-valley trions exhibits a fast decay of ~ 4 ps. Furthermore, we show that\nresonant excitation is a prerequisite for observing the long-lived valley\npolarization associated with the intra-valley trion. The exceptionally robust\nvalley polarization associated with resonantly created intra-valley trions\ndiscovered here may be explored for future valleytronic applications such as\nvalley Hall effects.\n", "  We consider higher derivative gravity and obtain universal relations for the\nshape coefficients $(f_a, f_b, f_c)$ of the shape dependent universal part of\nthe R\\'enyi entropy for four dimensional CFTs in terms of the parameters $(c,\nt_2, t_4)$ of two-point and three-point functions of stress tensors. As a\nconsistency check, these shape coefficients $f_a$ and $f_c$ satisfy the\ndifferential relation as derived previously for the R\\'enyi entropy.\nInterestingly, these holographic relations also apply to weakly coupled\nconformal field theories such as theories of free fermions and vectors but are\nviolated by theories of free scalars. The mismatch of $f_a$ for scalars has\nbeen observed in the literature and is due to certain delicate boundary\ncontributions to the modular Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we find a combination\nof our holographic relations which are satisfied by all free CFTs including\nscalars. We conjecture that this combined relation is universal for general\nCFTs in four dimensional spacetime. Finally, we find there are similar\nuniversal laws for holographic R\\'enyi entropy in general dimensions.\n", "  We derive the phonon damping rate due to the four-phonon Landau-Khalatnikov\nprocess in low temperature strongly interacting Fermi gases using quantum\nhydrodynamics, correcting and extending the original calculation of Landau and\nKhalatnikov [ZhETF, 19 (1949) 637]. Our predictions can be tested in\nstate-of-the-art experiments with cold atomic gases in the collisionless\nregime.\n", "  Avalanche photodiode (APD) has been intensively investigated as a promising\ncandidate to replace photomultiplier tubes (PMT) for weak light detection.\nHowever, in conventional APDs, a large portion of carrier energy drawn from the\nelectric field is thermalized, and the multiplication efficiencies of electron\nand hole are low and close. In order to achieve high gain, the device should\nwork under breakdown bias, where carrier multiplication proceeds\nbi-directionally to form a positive feedback multiplication circle. However,\nbreakdown is hard to control, in practice, APDs should work under Geiger mode\nas a compromise between sustainable detection and high gain. The complexity of\nsystem seriously restricts the application. Here, we demonstrate an avalanche\nphotodiode holding high gain without breakdown, which means no quenching\ncircuit is needed for sustainable detection. The device is based on a GaN/AlN\nperiodically-stacked-structure (PSS), wherein electron holds much higher\nefficiency than hole to draw energy from the electric field, and avalanche\nhappens uni-directionally with high efficiency. and a recorded high gain (10^4)\ntested under constant bias is obtained in a prototype device, wherein the\nstable gain can be determined by the periodicity of the GaN/AlN PSS. This work\nnot only brings a new light into avalanche multiplication mechanism, but also\npaves a technological path with high commercial value to realize highly\nsensitive avalanche devices working under constant bias like PMT.\n", "  We demonstrate that the condition of vacuum stability severely restricts\nscenarios with fermionic WIMP dark matter in the scotogenic model. The sizable\nYukawa couplings that are required to satisfy the dark matter constraint via\nthermal freeze-out in these scenarios tend to destabilise the vacuum at scales\nbelow that of the heaviest singlet fermion, rendering the model inconsistent\nfrom a theoretical point of view. By means of a scan over the parameter space,\nwe study the impact of these renormalisation group effects on the viable\nregions of this model. Our analysis shows that a fraction of more than 90% of\nthe points compatible with all known experimental constraints - including\nneutrino masses, the dark matter density, and lepton flavour violation - is\nactually inconsistent.\n", "  We derive the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model from the basic circuit equations\ngoverning two coupled Wien-bridge oscillators. A Wien-bridge oscillator is a\nparticular realization of a tunable autonomous oscillator that makes use of\nfrequency filtering (via a RC band-pass filter) and positive feedback (via an\nOp-Amp). In the last few years, such oscillators have started to be utilized in\nsynchronization studies. We first show that the Wien-bridge circuit equations\ncan be cast in the form of a coupled pair of Duffing - Van der Pol equations.\nSubsequently, by applying the method of multiple time scales, we derive the\ndifferential equations that govern the slow evolution of the oscillator phases\nand amplitudes. These equations are directly reminiscent of the\nKuramoto-Sakaguchi type models for the study of synchronization. We analyze the\nresulting system in terms of existence and stability of various coupled\noscillator solutions and explain on that basis how their synchronization\nemerges. The phase-amplitude equations are also compared numerically to the\noriginal circuit equations, and good agreement is found. Finally, we report on\nexperimental measurements on two coupled Wien-bridge oscillators and relate the\nresults back to the theoretical predictions.\n", "  The instability of a monoenergetic electron beam in a collisional\none-dimensional plasma bounded between grounded walls is considered both\nanalytically and numerically. Collisions between electrons and neutrals are\naccounted for the plasma electrons only. Solution of a dispersion equation\nshows that the temporal growth rate of the instability is a decreasing linear\nfunction of the collision frequency which becomes zero when the collision\nfrequency is two times the collisionless growth rate. This result is confirmed\nby fluid simulations. Practical formulas are given for the estimate of the\nthreshold beam current which is required for the two-stream instability to\ndevelop for a given system length, neutral gas pressure, plasma density, and\nbeam energy. Particle-in-cell simulations carried out with different neutral\ndensities and beam currents demonstrate good agreement with the fluid theory\npredictions for both the growth rate and the threshold beam current.\n", "  We propose a one-parameter family of noninteracting lattice models for Weyl\nsemimetals with 4 Weyl nodes and tunable Fermi arcs. These 2-band model\nHamiltonians are time-reversal symmetric with $\\mathrm{T}^2 = + 1$, and tuning\nthe parameter changes the connectivity of the Fermi arcs continuously without\naffecting the location and chiralities of the Weyl nodes in the bulk Brillouin\nzone. The bulk polarization and magnetization are shown to vary with this\nparameter, a dependence inaccessible to the low energy effective field theory.\n", "  In twin Higgs model, the Higgs boson mass is protected by a $Z_2$ symmetry.\nThe $Z_2$ symmetry needs to be broken either explicitly or spontaneously to\nobtain misalignment between electroweak and new physics vacua. We propose a\nnovel $Z_2$ breaking mechanism, in which the $Z_2$ is spontaneously broken by\nradiative corrections to the Higgs potential. Two twin Higgses with different\nvacua are needed, and vacuum misalignment is realized by opposite but\ncomparable contributions from gauge and Yukawa interactions to the potential.\nDue to fully radiative symmetry breaking, the Higgs sector is completely\ndetermined by twin Higgs vacuum, Yukawa and gauge couplings. There are eight\npseudo-Goldstone bosons: the Higgs boson, inert doublet Higgs, and three twin\nscalars. We show the 125 GeV Higgs mass and constraints from Higgs coupling\nmeasurements could be satisfied.\n", "  Using analytical approach and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, we study the\nelastic behaviour of the intrinsically twisted elastic ribbons with bending\nanisotropy, such as double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), in two-dimensional (2D)\nconfinement. We show that, due to the bending anisotropy, the persistence\nlength of dsDNA in 2D conformations is always greater than 3D conformations.\nThis result is in consistence with the measured values for DNA persistence\nlength in 2D and 3D in equal biological conditions. We also show that in 2D, an\nanisotropic, intrinsically twisted polymer exhibits an implicit twist-bend\ncoupling, which leads to the kink formations with a half helical turn\nperiodicity along the bent polymer.\n", "  Gauge symmetries emerge from a redundant description of the effective action\nfor light degrees of freedom after the decoupling of heavy modes. This\nredundant description avoids the use of explicit constraints in configuration\nspace. For non-linear constraints the gauge symmetries are non-linear. In a\nquantum field theory setting the gauge symmetries are local and can describe\nYang-Mills theories or quantum gravity. We formulate gauge invariant fields\nthat correspond to the non-linear light degrees of freedom. In the context of\nfunctional renormalization gauge symmetries can emerge if the flow generates or\npreserves large mass-like terms for the heavy degrees of freedom. They\ncorrespond to a particular form of gauge fixing terms in quantum field\ntheories.\n", "  The damping ($\\Gamma_a$) of the transverse acoustic (TA) phonon in single\ncrystals of the relaxor $KTa_{1-x}Nb_xO_3$ with x=0.15-0.17 was studied by\nmeans of high resolution inelastic cold neutron scattering near the (200) B.Z.\npoint where diffuse scattering is absent, although it is present near (110). In\na wide range of temperatures centered on the phase transition, T=195K-108K, the\nTA phonon width (damping) exhibits a step increase around momentum q=0.07, goes\nthrough a shallow maximum at q=0.09-0.12 and remains high up to the highest\nmomentum studied of q=0.16. These experimental results are explained in terms\nof a resonant interaction between the TA phonon and the collective or\ncorrelated reorientation through tunneling of the off-center Nb+5 ions. The\nobserved TA damping is successfully reproduced in a simple model that includes\nan interaction between the TA phonon and a dispersionless localized mode (LM)\nwith frequency $\\omega_L$ and damping $\\Gamma_L$ ($\\Gamma_L < \\omega_L$),\nitself coupled to the transverse optic (TO) mode. Maximum damping of the TA\nphonon occurs when its frequency $\\omega_a \\approx{\\omega_L}$. $\\omega_L$ and\n$\\Gamma_L$ are moderately dependent on temperature but the oscillator strength,\n$M_2$, of the resonant damping exhibits a strong maximum in the range\n$T\\sim{150 K-120 K}$ in which neutron diffuse scattering near the (110) B.Z.\npoint is also maximum and the dielectric susceptibility exhibits the relaxor\nbehavior. The maximum value of M appears to be due to the increasing number of\npolar nanodomains. In support of the proposed model, the observed value of\n$\\omega_L$ is found to be similar to the estimate previously obtained by\nGirshberg and Yacoby. Alternatively, the TA phonon damping can be successfully\nfitted in the framework of an empirical Havriliak - Negami (HN) relaxation\nmodel that includes a strong resonance-like transient contribution.\n", "  We present an extension of our recent paper [Bienias et al., Phys. Rev. A 90,\n053804 (2014)] in which we demonstrated the scattering properties and\nbound-state structure of two Rydberg polaritons, as well as the derivation of\nthe effective low-energy many-body Hamiltonian. Here, we derive a microscopic\nHamiltonian describing the propagation of Rydberg slow light polaritons in one\ndimension. We describe possible decoherence processes within a Master equation\napproach, and derive equations of motion in a Schroedinger picture by using an\neffective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate diagrammatic methods on two\nexamples: First, we show the solution for a single polariton in an external\npotential by exact summation of Feynman diagrams. Secondly, we solve the two\nbody problem in a weakly interacting regime exactly.\n", "  We consider the canonical problem of an array of rods, which act as\nresonators, placed on an elastic substrate; the substrate being either a thin\nelastic plate or an elastic half-space. In both cases the flexural plate, or\nRayleigh surface, waves in the substrate interact with the resonators to create\ninteresting effects such as effective band-gaps for surface waves or filters\nthat transform surface waves into bulk waves; these effects have parallels in\nthe field of optics where such sub-wavelength resonators create metamaterials,\nand metasurfaces, in the bulk and at the surface respectively.\n  Here we carefully analyse this canonical problem by extracting the dispersion\nrelations analytically thereby examining the influence of both the flexural and\ncompressional resonances on the propagating wave. For an array of resonators\natop an elastic half-space we augment the analysis with numerical simulations.\nAmongst other effects, we demonstrate the striking effect of a dispersion curve\nthat transitions from Rayleigh wave-like to shear wave-like behaviour and the\nresultant change in displacement from surface to bulk waves.\n", "  We present a coupled Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation and\nHauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) model for calculating delayed particle emission. This\napproach uses microscopic nuclear structure information which starts with\nGamow-Teller strength distributions in the daughter nucleus, and then follows\nthe statistical decay until the initial available excitation energy is\nexhausted. Explicitly included at each particle emission stage is $\\gamma$-ray\ncompetition. We explore this model in the context of neutron emission of\nneutron-rich nuclei and find that neutron-gamma competition can lead to both\nincreases and decreases in neutron emission probabilities, depending on the\nsystem considered. A second consequence of this formalism is a prediction of\nmore neutrons on average being emitted after $\\beta$-decay for nuclei near the\nneutron dripline compared to models that do not consider the statistical decay.\n", "  The sensitivity of kilometer-scale terrestrial gravitational wave\ninterferometers is limited by mirror coating thermal noise. We explore the\neffect of folding the arm cavities of such interferometers. While simple\nfolding alone does not reduce the mirror coating thermal noise, it makes the\nfolding mirror the critical mirror, opening up a variety of design and upgrade\noptions.\n", "  We have studied the differential cross section as well as the longitudinal\nand perpendicular components of polarization of final\nhyperon($\\Lambda$,$\\Sigma$) produced in the antineutrino induced quasielastic\ncharged current reactions on nucleon and nuclear targets. The nucleon-hyperon\ntransition form factors are determined from the experimental data on\nquasielastic $(\\Delta S =0)$ charged current (anti)neutrino--nucleon scattering\nand the semileptonic decay of neutron and hyperons assuming G--invariance,\nT--invariance and SU(3) symmetry. The vector transition form factors are\nobtained in terms of nucleon electromagnetic form factors for which various\nparameterizations available in literature have been used. A dipole\nparameterization for the axial vector form factor and the pseudoscalar\ntransition form factor derived in terms of axial vector form factor assuming\nPCAC and GT relation extended to strangeness sector have been used in numerical\nevaluations. The flux averaged cross section and polarization observables\ncorresponding to CERN Gargamelle experiment have been calculated for\nquasielastic hyperon production and found to be in reasonable agreement with\nthe experimental observations. The numerical results for the flux averaged\ndifferential cross section$\\frac{d\\sigma}{dQ^2}$ and\nlongitudinal(perpendicular) polarization $P_L(Q^2)(P_P(Q^2))$ relevant for the\nantineutrino fluxes of MINER$\\nu$A, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments have been\npresented. This will be useful in interpreting future experimental results on\nproduction cross sections and polarization observables from the experiments on\nthe quasielastic production of hyperons induced by antineutrinos and explore\nthe possibility of determining the axial vector and pseudoscalar form factors\nin the strangeness sector.\n", "  In this paper, we report an experiment about the device-independent tests of\nclassical and quantum entropy based on a recent proposal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,\n110501 (2015)], in which the states are encoded on the polarization of a\nbiphoton system and measured by the state tomography technology. We also\ntheoretically obtained the minimal quantum entropy for three widely used linear\ndimension witnesses. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical\nanalysis, demonstrating that lower entropy is needed in quantum systems than\nthat in classical systems under given values of the dimension witness.\n", "  We investigate Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) effects (beyond the usual\nmass scaling) for the electronic ground states of a series of homonuclear and\nheteronuclear alkali-metal diatoms, together with the Sr$_2$ and Yb$_2$\ndiatomics. Several widely available electronic structure software packages are\nused to calculate the leading contributions to the total isotope shift for\ncommonly occurring isotopologs of each species. Computed quantities include\ndiagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (mass shifts) and isotopic field shifts.\nMass shifts dominate for light nuclei up to and including K, but field shifts\ncontribute significantly for Rb and Sr and are dominant for Yb. We compare the\n{\\em ab initio} mass-shift functions for Li$_2$, LiK and LiRb with\nspectroscopically derived ground-state BOB functions from the literature. We\nfind good agreement in the values of the functions for LiK and LiRb at their\nequilibrium geometries, but significant disagreement with the shapes of the\nfunctions for all 3 systems. The differences may be due to contributions of\nnonadiabatic terms to the empirical BOB functions. We present a semiclassical\nmodel for the effect of BOB corrections on the binding energies of\nnear-threshold states and the positions of zero-energy Feshbach resonances.\n", "  We use Planck data released in 2015 to constrain the abundance of primordial\nblack holes (PBHs) in dark matter in two different reionization models (one is\nthe instantaneous reionization and the other is the asymmetric reionization),\nand significantly improve the upper limits on the abundance of PBHs from WMAP\n3-year data by around two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, these new limits\nimply that the event rates of mergers of PBH binaries (Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$)\nare less than $0.002$ for $M_\\text{pbh}=30M_\\odot$, $5$ for\n$M_\\text{pbh}=10M_\\odot$ and $2000$ for $M_\\text{pbh}=2M_\\odot$ at $95\\%$\nconfidence level (C.L.), and thus GW150914 seems very unlikely produced by the\nmerger of a PBH binary.\n", "  In this article, we assign the higher charmed mesons $D^*_1(2680)$,\n$D_3^*(2760)$ and $D_2^*(3000)$ to be the 2S $1^-$, 1D $3^-$ and 1F $2^+$\nstates, respectively, and study the two-body strong decays to the ground state\ncharmed mesons and light pseudoscalar mesons with the heavy meson effective\ntheory. We obtain the ratios among the strong decays, which can be confronted\nto the experimental data in the future and shed light on the nature of those\nhigher charmed mesons.\n", "  Stepwise changes of the photospheric magnetic field, which often becomes more\nhorizontal, have been observed during many flares. Previous interpretations\ninclude coronal loops that contract and it has been speculated that such jerks\ncould be responsible for sunquakes. Here we report the detection of stepwise\nchromospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B$_{\\rm LOS}$) changes obtained\nthrough spectropolarimetry of Ca II 8542 \\AA\\ with DST/IBIS during the X1-flare\nSOL20140329T17:48. They are stronger ($<$640 Mx cm$^{-2}$) and appear in larger\nareas than their photospheric counterparts ($<$320 Mx cm$^{-2}$). The absolute\nvalue of B$_{\\rm LOS}$ more often decreases than increases. Photospheric\nchanges are predominantly located near a polarity inversion line, chromospheric\nchanges near footpoints of loops. The locations of changes are near, but not\nexactly co-spatial to hard X-ray (HXR) emission and neither to enhanced\ncontinuum emission, nor a small sunquake. Enhanced chromospheric and coronal\nemission is observed in nearly all locations that exhibit changes of B$_{\\rm\nLOS}$, but the emission also occurs in many locations without any B$_{\\rm LOS}$\nchanges. Photospheric and chromospheric changes of B$_{\\rm LOS}$ show\ndifferences in timing, sign, and size and seem independent of each other. A\nsimple model of contracting loops yields changes of opposite sign to those\nobserved. An explanation for this discrepancy could be increasing loop sizes or\nloops that untwist in a certain direction during the flare. It is yet unclear\nwhich processes are responsible for the observed changes, their timing, size\nand locations, especially considering the incoherence between photosphere and\nchromosphere.\n", "  I propose an archtitecture for the realization of dissipative quantum\nmany-body spin models. The dissipative processes are mediated by interactions\nwith auxiliary particles and lead to a widely tunable class of correlated\nquantum jump operators. These findings enable the investigation of purely\ndissipative spin models, where coherent dynamics is entirely absent. I provide\na detailed review of a recently introduced variational method to analyze such\ndissipative quantum many-body systems, and I discuss a specific example in\nterms of a purely dissipative Heisenberg model, for which I find an additional\ndisordered phase that is not present in the corresponding ground state phase\ndiagram.\n", "  The $U_q(A^{(1)}_n)$-zero range processes introduced recently by Mangazeev,\nMaruyama and the authors are integrable discrete and continuous time Markov\nprocesses associated with the stochastic $R$ matrix derived from the well-known\n$U_q(A_n^{(1)})$ quantum $R$ matrix. By constructing a representation of the\nrelevant Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra, we present, for $n=2$, a matrix product\nformula for the steady state probabilities in terms of $q$-boson operators.\n", "  We demonstrated a simple and reliable technique of coupling diamond\nnanocrystal containing NV center to tapered optical fiber. We carefully studied\nfluorescence of the fiber itself and were able to suppress it to the level\nlower than single photon emission from the NV center. Single photon statistics\nwas demonstrated at the fiber end as well as up to 3 times improvement in\ncollection efficiency with respect to our confocal microscope\n", "  The Universality of Free Fall and the Weak Equivalence Principle, which are\nat the basis of General Relativity, have been confirmed to 1 part in 10^13.\nSpace experiments with macroscopic test masses of different composition\norbiting the Earth inside a low altitude satellite aim at improving this\nprecision by two orders of magnitude (with the Microscope satellite, launched\non 25 April 2016) and up to four orders of magnitude (with the 'Galileo\nGalilei' - GG satellite). At such a high precision many tiny effects must be\ntaken into account in order to be ruled out as the source of a spurious\nviolation signal. In this work we investigate the general relativistic effects,\nincluding those which involve the rotation of both the source body and the test\nmasses, and show that they are by far too small to be considered even in the\nmost challenging experiment. (Paper to appear on Physical Review D)\n", "  The extrapolation of nucleon axial charge $g_A$ is investigated within the\nframework of heavy baryon chiral effective field theory. The intermediate octet\nand decuplet baryons are included in the one loop calculation. Finite range\nregularization is applied to improve the convergence in the quark-mass\nexpansion. The lattice data from three different groups are used for the\nextrapolation. At physical pion mass, the extrapolated $g_A$ are all smaller\nthan the experimental value.\n", "  A master equation approach is applied to a reversible and conservative\ncellular automata model (Q2R). The Q2R model is a dynamical variation of the\nIsing model for ferromagnetism that possesses quite a rich and complex\ndynamics. The configurational space is composed by a huge number of cycles with\nexponentially long periods. Following Nicolis and Nicolis [Phys. Rev. A 38,\n427-433 (1988)], a coarse-graining approach is applied to the time series of\nthe total magnetization leading to a master equation that governs the\nmacroscopic irreversible dynamics of the Q2R automata. The methodology is\nreplicated for various lattice sizes. In the case of small systems, it is shown\nthat the master equation leads to a tractable probability transfer matrix of\nmoderate size which provides a master equation for a coarse-grained probability\ndistribution. The method is validated and some explicit examples are discussed.\n", "  One of the fundamental structural properties of many networks is triangle\nclosure. Whereas the influence of this transitivity on a variety of contagion\ndynamics has been previously explored, existing models of coevolving or\nadaptive network systems use rewiring rules that randomize away this important\nproperty. In contrast, we study here a modified coevolving voter model dynamics\nthat explicitly reinforces and maintains such clustering. Employing extensive\nnumerical simulations, we establish that the transitions and dynamical states\nobserved in coevolving voter model networks without clustering are altered by\nreinforcing transitivity in the model. We then use a semi-analytical framework\nin terms of approximate master equations to predict the dynamical behaviors of\nthe model for a variety of parameter settings.\n", "  The onset of dark energy domination depends on the particular gravitational\ntheory driving the cosmic evolution. Model independent techniques are crucial\nto test both the present $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm and alternative\ntheories, making the least possible number of assumptions about the Universe.\nIn this paper we investigate whether cosmography is able to distinguish between\ndifferent gravitational theories, by determining bounds on model parameters for\nthree different extensions of General Relativity, i.e. $k-$essence, $F(T)$ and\n$f(R)$ theories. We expand each class of theories in powers of redshift $z$\naround the present time, making no additional assumptions. This procedure is an\nextension of previous work and can be seen as the most general approach for\ntesting extended theories of gravity with cosmography. In the case of $F(T)$\nand $f(R)$ theories, we show that some assumptions on model parameters often\nmade in previous works are superfluous or unjustified. We use data from the\nUnion2.1 SN catalogue, BAO data and $H(z)$ differential age compilations, which\nprobe cosmology on different scales. We perform a Monte Carlo analysis using a\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion,\nreporting 1-$\\sigma$ and 2-$\\sigma$ confidence levels. We perform two distinct\nfits, first taking only data at $z<1$ and then for all $z$. We obtain the\ncorresponding parameter intervals, and find that the data is compatible the\n$\\Lambda$CDM limit of all three theories at the 1-$\\sigma$ level, while still\ncompatible with quite a large portion of parameter space. We compare our\nresults to the truncated $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, showing that the permitted\nregions of coefficients are significantly modified and in general widened\ncompared to values reported in the existing literature. Finally, we test the\nextended theories through the Bayesian selection criteria AIC and BIC.\n", "  Evolution formulas of the density operator, the photon number distribution,\nand the Wigner function are derived for the problem on the optical fields\npropagation in realistic environments. The method of deriving these formulas is\nnovel and the results are very useful for quantum optics and quantum\nstatistics.\n", "  We investigate which among the reactor antineutrino fluxes from the decays of\nthe fission products of $^{235}\\text{U}$, $^{238}\\text{U}$, $^{239}\\text{Pu}$,\nand $^{241}\\text{Pu}$ may be responsible for the reactor antineutrino anomaly\nif the anomaly is due to a miscalculation of the antineutrino fluxes. We find\nthat it is very likely that at least the calculation of the $^{235}\\text{U}$\nflux must be revised. From the fit of the data we obtain the precise\ndetermination $\\sigma_{f,235} = ( 6.33 \\pm 0.08 ) \\times 10^{-43} \\,\n\\text{cm}^2 / \\text{fission}$ of the $^{235}\\text{U}$ cross section per\nfission, which is more precise than the calculated value and differs from it by\n$2.2\\sigma$. The cross sections per fission of the other fluxes have large\nuncertainties and in practice their values are undetermined by the fit.\n", "  Critical systems have always intrigued physicists and precipitated the\ndevelopment of new techniques. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the\ninformation contained in their classical configurations, whose computation do\nnot require full knowledge of the wavefunction. Inspired by holographic\nduality, we investigated the entanglement properties of the classical\nconfigurations (snapshots) of the Potts model by introducing an ansatz ensemble\nof random fractal images. By virtue of the central limit theorem, our ansatz\naccurately reproduces the entanglement spectra of actual Potts snapshots\nwithout any fine-tuning of parameters or artificial restrictions on ensemble\nchoice. It provides a microscopic interpretation of the results of previous\nstudies, which established a relation between the scaling behavior of snapshot\nentropy and the critical exponent. More importantly, it elucidates the role of\nensemble disorder in restoring conformal invariance, an aspect previously\nignored. Away from criticality, the breakdown of scale invariance leads to a\nrenormalization of the parameter $\\Sigma$ in the random fractal ansatz, whose\nvariation can be used as an alternative determination of the critical exponent.\nWe conclude by providing a recipe for the explicit construction of fractal unit\ncells consistent with a given scaling exponent.\n", "  We investigate baryon number fluctuations for finite temperature and density\nin two-flavor QCD. This is done within a QCD-improved low-energy effective\ntheory in an extension of the approach put forward in [1,2]. In the present\nwork we aim at improving the predictive power of this approach for large\ntemperatures and density, that is, for small collision energies. This is\nachieved by taking into account the full frequency dependence of the quark\ndispersion. This ensures the necessary Silver Blaze property of finite density\nQCD for the first time, which so far was only implemented approximately.\nMoreover, we show that Polyakov loop fluctuations have a sizeable impact at\nlarge temperatures and density. The results for the kurtosis of baryon number\nfluctuations are compared to previous effective theory results, lattice results\nand recent experimental data from STAR.\n", "  Automating the radiotherapy treatment planning process is a technically\nchallenging problem. The majority of automated approaches have focused on\ncustomizing and inferring dose volume objectives to used in plan optimization.\nIn this work we outline a multi-patient atlas-based dose prediction approach\nthat learns to predict the dose-per-voxel for a novel patient directly from the\ncomputed tomography (CT) planning scan without the requirement of specifying\nany objectives. Our method learns to automatically select the most effective\natlases for a novel patient, and then map the dose from those atlases onto the\nnovel patient. We extend our previous work to include a conditional random\nfield for the optimization of a joint distribution prior that matches the\ncomplementary goals of an accurately spatially distributed dose distribution\nwhile still adhering to the desired dose volume histograms. The resulting\ndistribution can then be used for inverse-planning with a new spatial dose\nobjective, or to create typical dose volume objectives for the canonical\noptimization pipeline. We investigated six treatment sites (633 patients for\ntraining and 113 patients for testing) and evaluated the mean absolute\ndifference (MAD) in all DVHs for the clinical and predicted dose distribution.\nThe results on average are favorable in comparison to our previous approach\n(1.91 vs 2.57). Comparing our method with and without atlas-selection further\nvalidates that atlas-selection improved dose prediction on average in Whole\nBreast (0.64 vs 1.59), Prostate (2.13 vs 4.07), and Rectum (1.46 vs 3.29) while\nit is less important in Breast Cavity (0.79 vs 0.92) and Lung (1.33 vs 1.27)\nfor which there is high conformity and minimal dose shaping. In CNS Brain,\natlas-selection has the potential to be impactful (3.65 vs 5.09), but selecting\nthe ideal atlas is the most challenging.\n", "  We study the ground-state magnetism of the half-filled Hubbard model on the\nanisotropic triangular lattice, where two out of three bonds have hopping $t$\nand the third one has $t^\\prime$ in a unit triangle. Working in a spin-rotating\nframe and using the density matrix renormalization group method as an impurity\nsolver, we provide a proper description of incommensurate magnetizations at\nzero temperature in the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). It\nis shown that the incommensurate spiral magnetic order for $t^\\prime/t\\gtrsim\n0.7$ survives the dynamical fluctuations of itinerant electrons in the Hubbard\ninteraction range from the strong-coupling (localized-spin) limit down to the\ninsulator-to-metal transition. We also find that the magnetic moment reduction\nfrom the localized-spin limit is pronounced in the vicinity of the transition\nbetween the commensurate N\\'eel and incommensurate spiral phases at\n$t^\\prime/t\\sim 0.7$. When the anisotropy parameter $t^\\prime/t$ increases from\nthe N\\'eel-to-spiral transition, the magnitude of the magnetic moment\nimmediately reaches a maximum and then rapidly decreases in the range of larger\n$t^\\prime/t$ including the isotropic triangular lattice point $t^\\prime/t=1$.\nThis work gives a solid foundation for further extension of the study including\nnonlocal correlation effects neglected at the standard DMFT level.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the design, fabrication, and experimental\ncharacterization of a 3D single-port labyrinthine acoustic metamaterial. By\nusing curled perforations with one end closed and with appropriate loss inside,\nthe proposed metamaterial can perfectly absorb airborne sounds in a low\nfrequency band. Both the position and width of the band can be tuned flexibly.\nA tradeoff is uncovered between the relative absorption bandwidth and thickness\nof the metamaterial. When the relative absorption bandwidth is as high as 51%,\nthe requirement of deep subwavelength thickness (0.07{\\lambda}) can still be\nsatisfied.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamic limit of the su(n)-invariant spin chain\nmodels with unparallel boundary fields. It is found that the contribution of\nthe inhomogeneous term in the associated T-Q relation to the ground state\nenergy does vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This fact allows us to calculate\nthe boundary energy of the system. Taking the su(2) (or the XXX) spin chain and\nthe su(3) spin chain as concrete examples, we have studied the corresponding\nboundary energies of the models. The method used in this paper can be\ngeneralized to study the thermodynamic properties and boundary energy of other\nhigh rank models with non-diagonal boundary fields.\n", "  Studying the Milky Way disk structure using stars in narrow bins of [Fe/H]\nand [alpha/Fe] has recently been proposed as a powerful method to understand\nthe Galactic thick and thin disk formation. It has been assumed so far that\nthese mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also coeval, or mono-age,\npopulations. Here we study this relationship for a Milky Way chemo-dynamical\nmodel and show that equivalence between MAPs and mono-age populations exists\nonly for the high-[alpha/Fe] tail, where the chemical evolution curves of\ndifferent Galactic radii are far apart. At lower [alpha/Fe]-values a MAP is\ncomposed of stars with a range in ages, even for small observational\nuncertainties and a small MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation,\nfor these MAPs younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which\nresults in negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr/kpc.\nPositive radial age gradients can result for MAPs at the lowest [alpha/Fe] and\nhighest [Fe/H] end. Such variations with age prevent the simple interpretation\nof observations for which accurate ages are not available. Studying the\nvariation with radius of the stellar surface density and scale-height in our\nmodel, we find good agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC)\nsample when 1-4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results\nsuggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for which\nmono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational tests for the\nvalidity of our predictions and argue that using accurate age measurements,\nsuch as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting constraints on the\nGalactic formation and evolution.\n", "  We propose a scheme of loss-resilient entanglement swapping between two\ndistant parties via an imperfect optical channel. In this scheme, two copies of\nhybrid entangled states are prepared and the continuous-variable parts\npropagate through lossy media. In order to perform successful entanglement\nswapping, several different measurement schemes are considered for the\ncontinuousvariable parts such as single-photon detection for ideal cases and a\nhomodyne detection for practical cases. We find that the entanglement swapping\nusing hybrid states with small amplitudes offers larger entanglement than the\ndiscrete-variable entanglement swapping in the presence of large losses.\nRemarkably, this hybrid scheme still offers excellent robustness of\nentanglement to the detection inefficiency. Thus, the proposed scheme could be\nused for the practical quantum key distribution in hybrid optical states under\nphoton losses.\n", "  In order to identify diagnostics distinguishing between pre- and\npost-mass-transfer systems, the mass-ratio distribution and period -\neccentricity (P - e) diagram of barium and S stars are compared to those of the\nsample of binary red giants in open clusters from Mermilliod et al. (2007).\n  From the analysis of the mass-ratio distribution for the cluster binary\ngiants, we find an excess of systems with companion masses between 0.58 and\n0.87 Msun, typical for white dwarfs. They represent 22% of the sample, which\nare thus candidate post-mass-transfer systems. Among these candidates which\noccupy the same locus as the barium and S stars in the (P-e) diagram, only 33%\n(= 4/12) show a chemical signature of mass transfer in the form of s-process\noverabundances (from rather moderate -- about 0.3 dex -- to more extreme --\nabout 1 dex). These s-process-enriched cluster stars show a clear tendency to\nbe in the clusters with the lowest metallicity in the sample, confirming the\nclassical prediction that the s-process nucleosynthesis is more efficient at\nlow metallicities (the only strong barium star in our sample is found in the\ncluster with the lowest metallicity, i.e., star 173 in NGC 2420, with [Fe/H] =\n-0.26). The s-process overabundance is not clearly correlated with the cluster\nturnoff (TO) mass (such a correlation would instead hint at the importance of\nthe dilution factor). We find as well a mild barium star in NGC 2335, a cluster\nwith a large TO mass of 4.3 Msun, which implies that intermediate-mass AGB\nstars still operate the s-process and the third dredge-up.\n", "  The high efficiency of lead organo-metal-halide perovskite solar cells has\nraised many questions about the role of the methylammonium (MA) molecules in\nthe Pb-I framework. Experiments indicate that the MA molecules are able to\n'freely' spin around at room temperature even though they carry an intrinsic\ndipole moment. We have performed large supercell (2592 atoms) finite\ntemperature ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations to study the correlation\nbetween the molecules in the framework. An underlying long range\nanti-ferroelectric ordering of the molecular dipoles is observed. The dynamical\ncorrelation between neighboring molecules shows a maximum around room\ntemperature in the mid-temperature phase. In this phase, the rotations are slow\nenough to (partially) couple to neighbors via the Pb-I cage. This results in a\ncollective motion of neighboring molecules in which the cage acts as the\nmediator. At lower and higher temperatures the motions are less correlated.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is thought to be the dynamical mechanism underlying\nmany explosive phenomena observed both in space and in the laboratory, though\nthe question of how fast magnetic reconnection is triggered in such high\nLundquist ($S$) number plasmas has remained elusive. It has been well\nestablished that reconnection can develop over timescales faster than those\npredicted traditionally once kinetic scales are reached. It has also been shown\nthat, within the framework of resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), fast\nreconnection is achieved for thin enough sheets via the onset of the so-called\nplasmoid instability. The latter was discovered in studies specifically devoted\nto the Sweet-Parker current sheet, either as an initial condition or an\napparent transient state developing in nonlinear studies. On the other hand, a\nfast tearing instability can grow on an ideal, i.e., $S$-independent, timescale\n(dubbed \"ideal\" tearing) within current sheets whose aspect ratio scales with\nthe macroscopic Lundquist number as $L/a\\sim S^{1/3}$ -- much smaller than the\nSweet-Parker one -- suggesting a new way to approach to the initiation of fast\nreconnection in collapsing current configurations. Here we present an overview\nof what we have called \"ideal\" tearing in resistive MHD, and discuss how the\nsame reasoning can be extended to other plasma models commonly used that\ninclude electron inertia and kinetic effects. We then discuss a scenario for\nthe onset of \"ideal\" fast reconnection via collapsing current sheets and\ndescribe a quantitative model for the interpretation of the nonlinear evolution\nof \"ideally\" unstable sheets in two dimensions.\n", "  We demonstrate a new technique in velocity map imaging (VMI) that allows\nspatial gating of the laser focal overlap region in time resolved pump-probe\nexperiments. This significantly enhances signal-to-noise ratio by eliminating\nbackground signal arising outside the region of spatial overlap of pump and\nprobe beams. This enhancement is achieved by tilting the laser beams with\nrespect to the surface of the VMI electrodes which creates a gradient in flight\ntime for particles born at different points along the beam. By suitably pulsing\nour microchannel plate detector, we can select particles born only where the\nlaser beams overlap. This spatial gating in velocity map imaging can benefit\nnearly all photoion pump-probe VMI experiments especially when\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV) light or X-rays are involved which produce large\nbackground signals on their own.\n", "  We obtain numerical solutions for rotating topological solitons of the\nnonlinear $\\sigma$-model in three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. Two types\nof solutions, $i)$ and $ii)$, are found. The $\\sigma$-model fields are\neverywhere well defined for both types of solutions, but they differ in their\nspace-time domains. Any time slice of the space-time for the type $i)$ solution\nhas a causal singularity, despite the fact that all scalars constructed the\ncurvature tensor are bounded functions. No evidence of a horizon is seen for\nany of the solutions, and therefore the type $i)$ solutions have naked\nsingularities.\n  On the other hand, the space-time domain, along with the fields, for the type\n$ii)$ solutions are singularity free. Multiple families of solutions exhibiting\nbifurcation phenomena are found for this case.\n", "  We predict very large changes in the room-temperature electroluminescence of\nthermally-activated delayed fluorescence organic light emitting diodes near\npatterned ferromagnetic films. These effects exceed the changes in a uniform\nmagnetic field by as much as a factor of two. We describe optimal ferromagnetic\nfilm patterns for enhancing the electroluminescence. A full theory of the\nspin-mixing processes in exciplex recombination, and how they are affected by\nhyperfine fields, spin-orbit effects, and ferromagnetic fringe field effects is\nintroduced, and is used to describe the effect of magnetic domain structures on\nthe luminescence in various regimes. This provides a method of enhancing light\nemission rates from exciplexes and also a means of efficiently coupling\ninformation encoded in magnetic domains to organic light emitting diode\nemission.\n", "  The stability of a collisionless, magnetised plasma to local convective\ndisturbances is examined, with a focus on kinetic and finite-Larmor-radius\neffects. Specific application is made to the outskirts of galaxy clusters,\nwhich contain hot and tenuous plasma whose temperature increases in the\ndirection of gravity. At long wavelengths (the \"drift-kinetic\" limit), we\nobtain the kinetic version of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and its\nAlfv\\'enic counterpart (Alfv\\'enic MTI), which were previously discovered and\nanalysed using a magnetofluid (i.e. Braginskii) description. At sub-ion-Larmor\nscales, we discover an overstability driven by the electron temperature\ngradient of kinetic-Alfv\\'en drift waves -- the electron MTI (eMTI) -- whose\ngrowth rate is even larger than the standard MTI. At intermediate scales, we\nfind that ion finite-Larmor-radius effects tend to stabilise the plasma. We\ndiscuss the physical interpretation of these instabilities in detail, and\ncompare them both with previous work on magnetised convection in a collisional\nplasma and with temperature-gradient-driven drift-wave instabilities well-known\nto the magnetic-confinement-fusion community. The implications of having both\nfluid and kinetic scales simultaneously driven unstable by the same temperature\ngradient are briefly discussed.\n", "  We present a unified variational treatment of evolving configurations in\ncrystalline solids with microstructure. The crux of our treatment lies in the\nintroduction of a vector configurational field. This field lies in the\nmaterial, or configurational, manifold, in contrast with the traditional\ndisplacement field, which we regard as lying in the spatial manifold. We\nidentify two distinct cases which describe (a) problems in which the\nconfigurational field's evolution is localized to a mathematically sharp\ninterface, and (b) those in which the configurational field's evolution can\nextend throughout the volume. The first case is suitable for describing\nincoherent phase interfaces in polycrystalline solids, and the latter is useful\nfor describing smooth changes in crystal structure and naturally incorporates\ncoherent (diffuse) phase interfaces. For sharp interfaces that are\nout-of-equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics furnishes restrictions on\nthe kinetic law for the interface velocity. The class of problems in which the\nmaterial undergoes configurational changes between distinct, stable crystal\nstructures are characterized by free energy density functions that are\nnon-convex with respect to configurational strain. For physically meaningful\nsolutions and mathematical well-posedness, it becomes necessary to incorporate\ninterfacial energy. This we have done by introducing a configurational strain\ngradient dependence in the free energy density function following ideas laid\nout by Toupin (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 11, 1962, 385-414). The variational\ntreatment leads to a system of partial differential equations governing the\nconfiguration that is coupled with the traditional equations of nonlinear\nelasticity. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate interface motion as\nwell as evolving microstructures of crystal structures.\n", "  We investigate the late-time tail of the retarded Green function for the\ndynamics of a linear field perturbation of Kerr spacetime. We develop an\nanalytical formalism for obtaining the late-time tail up to arbitrary order for\ngeneral integer spin of the field. We then apply this formalism to obtain the\ndetails of the first five orders in the late-time tail of the Green function\nfor the case of a scalar field: to leading order we recover the known power law\ntail $t^{-2\\ell-3}$, and at third order we obtain a logarithmic correction,\n$t^{-2\\ell-5}\\ln t$, where $\\ell$ is the field multipole.\n", "  In V-T theory the atomic motion is harmonic vibrations in a liquid-specific\npotential energy valley, plus transits, which move the system rapidly among the\nmultitude of such valleys. In its first application to the self intermediate\nscattering function (SISF), V-T theory produced an accurate account of\nmolecular dynamics (MD) data at all wave numbers q and time t. Recently,\nanalysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior\nthat was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more\naccurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results. We derive and\ndiscuss the theoretical equations for vibrational and transit contributions to\nthe SISF. The time evolution is divided into three successive intervals: the\nvibrational interval when the vibrational contribution alone accurately\naccounts for the MD data; the crossover when the vibrational contribution\nsaturates and the transit contribution becomes resolved; and the diffusive\ninterval when the transit contribution alone accurately accounts for the MD\ndata. The resulting theoretical error is extremely small at all q and t.\nComparison of V-T and mode-coupling theories for the MSD and SISF reveals that,\nwhile their formulations differ substantially, their underlying atomic motions\nare in logical correspondence.\n", "  Dynamic behaviour of an isotropic Ashkin-Teller model in the presence of a\nperiodically oscillating magnetic field has been analysed by means of the mean\nfield approximation. The dynamic equation of motion has been constructed with\nthe help of a Glauber type stochastic process and solved for a square lattice.\n  After defining the possible dynamical phases of the system, phase diagrams\nhave been given and the behaviour of the hysteresis loops has been investigated\nin detail. The hysteresis loop for specific order parameter of isotropic\nAshkin-Teller model has been defined and characteristics of this loop in\ndifferent dynamical phases have been given.\n", "  A common numerical task is to represent functions which are highly spatially\nanisotropic, and to solve differential equations related to these functions.\nOne way such anisotropy arises is that information transfer along one spatial\ndirection is much faster than in others. In this situation, the derivative of\nthe function is small in the local direction of a vector field $\\mathbf{b}$. In\norder to define a discrete representation, a set of surfaces $M_i$ indexed by\nan integer $i$ are chosen such that mapping along the field $\\mathbf{b}$\ninduces a one-to-one relation between the points on surface $M_i$ to those on\n$M_{i+1}$. For simple cases $M_i$ may be surfaces of constant coordinate value.\nOn each surface $M_i$, a function description is constructed using basis\nfunctions defined on a regular structured mesh. The definition of each basis\nfunction is extended from the surface $M$ along the lines of the field\n$\\mathbf{b}$ by multiplying it by a smooth compact support function whose\nargument increases with distance along $\\mathbf{b}$. Function values are\nevaluated by summing contributions associated with each surface $M_i$. This\ndoes not require any special connectivity of the meshes used in the\nneighbouring surfaces $M$, which substantially simplifies the meshing problem\ncompared to attempting to find a space filling anisotropic mesh. We explore the\nnumerical properties of the scheme, and show that it can be used to efficiently\nsolve differential equations for certain anisotropic problems.\n", "  We propose a technically natural scenario whereby an initially large\ncosmological constant (c.c.) is relaxed down to the observed value due to the\ndynamics of a scalar evolving on a very shallow potential. The model crucially\nrelies on a sector that violates the null energy condition (NEC) and gets\nactivated only when the Hubble rate becomes sufficiently small --- of the order\nof the present one. As a result of NEC violation, this low-energy universe\nevolves into inflation, followed by reheating and the standard Big Bang\ncosmology. The symmetries of the theory force the c.c. to be the same before\nand after the NEC-violating phase, so that a late-time observer sees an\neffective c.c. of the correct magnitude. Importantly, our model allows neither\nfor eternal inflation nor for a set of possible values of dark energy, the\nlatter fixed by the parameters of the theory.\n", "  It was suggested that a tension between the mass-squared differences obtained\nfrom the solar neutrino and KamLAND experiments can be solved by introducing\nthe non-standard flavor-dependent interaction in neutrino propagation. In this\npaper we discuss the possibility to test such a hypothesis by atmospheric\nneutrino observations at the future Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Assuming that\nthe mass hierarchy is known, we find that the best-fit value from the solar\nneutrino and KamLAND data can be tested at more than 8 $\\sigma$, while the one\nfrom the global analysis can be examined at 5.0 $\\sigma$ (1.4 $\\sigma$) for the\nnormal (inverted) mass hierarchy.\n", "  Recent data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at\nCERN give a hint of possible violation of flavor in the leptonic decays of the\nHiggs boson. In this work we analyze the flavor violating leptonic decays\n$H^0_1\\to l_i \\bar l_j$ ($i\\neq j$) within the framework of an MSSM extension\nwith a vectorlike leptonic generation. Specifically we focus on the decay mode\n$H^0_1\\to \\mu\\tau$. The analysis is done including tree and loop contributions\ninvolving exchange of $W, Z$, charge and neutral higgs and leptons and mirror\nleptons, charginos and neutralinos and sleptons and mirror sleptons. It is\nfound that a substantial branching ratio of $H^0_1\\to \\mu\\tau$, i.e., of as\nmuch a ${\\cal{O}}(1)\\%$, can be achieved in this model, the size hinted by the\nATLAS and CMS data. The flavor violating decays $H^0_1\\to e\\mu, e\\tau$ are also\nanalyzed and found to be consistent with the current experimental limits. An\nanalysis of the dependence of flavor violating decays on CP phases is given.\nThe analysis is extended to include flavor decays of the heavier Higgs bosons.\nA confirmation of the flavor violation in Higgs boson decays with more data\nthat is expected from LHC at $\\sqrt s=13$ TeV will be evidence of new physics\nbeyond the standard model.\n", "  We show that avoiding bends in a current-carrying superconducting nanowire\nenhances the probability for low energy photons to be detected and that this\nenhancement is entirely due to the increase in the experimentally achievable\ncritical current. We studied nanowires shaped as either meander or spiral. The\nspirals had different layouts, a double-spiral layout with an S-turn in the\nmiddle and a single-spiral layout without such turn. Nanowires were prepared\nfrom films of niobium nitride with a thickness of 5 nm. For specimens with each\nlayout we measured the spectra of the single-photon response in the wavelength\nrange from 400 nm to 1600 nm and defined the cut-off wavelength ${\\lambda}c$\nbeyond which the response rolls off. The largest and the smallest ${\\lambda}c$\nwere found for the single-spiral layout and for the meander, respectively. For\nall three layouts the relationship between ${\\lambda}c$ and the relative bias\ncurrent falls onto a universal curve which has been predicted earlier in the\nframework of the modified hot-spot model. For the single-spiral layout, the\nefficiency of photon detection at wavelengths smaller than ${\\lambda}c$ reaches\nthe expected absorbance of the spiral structure and the timing jitter per unit\nlength of the nanowire has the smallest value.\n", "  The paper contains a review of the exact or accurate results achieved in the\nfield of the three-body antikaon-nucleon physics. Different states and\nprocesses in $\\bar{K}NN$ and $\\bar{K}\\bar{K}N$ systems are considered. In\nparticular, quasi-bound states in $K^- pp$ and $K^- K^- p$ systems were\ninvestigated together with antikaonic deuterium atom. Near-threshold scattering\nof antikaons on deuteron, including the $K^- d$ scattering length, and\napplications of the scattering amplitudes are also discussed.\n  All exact three-body results were calculated using some form of Faddeev\nequations. Different versions of $\\bar{K}N$, $\\Sigma N$, $\\bar{K}\\bar{K}$, and\n$NN$ potentials, specially constructed for the calculations, allowed\ninvestigation of the dependence of the three-body results on the two-body\ninput. Special attention is paid to the antikaon-nucleon interaction, being the\nmost important for the three-body systems. Approximate calculations, performed\nadditionally to the exact ones, demonstrate accuracy of the commonly used\napproaches.\n", "  We present the results of a comprehensive magneto-optical characterization of\nsingle CdTe quantum dots containing a few Mn2+ ions. We find that some quantum\ndots exhibit an unexpected evolution of excitonic photoluminescence spectrum\nwith the magnetic field. At a certain value of the magnetic field, specific for\nevery quantum dot, each of the broad spectral lines related to the\nrecombination of various excitonic complexes confined inside the dot transforms\ninto a pair of narrow lines split by several meV. We interpret this abrupt\nchange in the character of excitonic emission spectrum as a consequence of a\ntransition from a non-polarized state of the Mn2+ spins in a low field regime\nto a highly (almost fully) polarized state above the critical magnetic field.\nVarious optical experiments, including polarization-resolved studies,\ninvestigation of different excitation regimes and time-resolved measurements\ncorroborate this scenario. However, these measurements indicate also that the\nobserved effect is not related or influenced by the photo-created charge\ncarriers, but it is rather originating from unusual spin configuration in the\ncluster of Mn2+ ions.\n", "  We develop a new fermionic path-integral formalism to analyze the phase\ndiagram of open nonequilibrium systems. The formalism is applied to analyze an\nensemble of two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode optical cavity,\ndescribed by the Dicke model. While this model is often used as the\nparadigmatic example of a phase transition in driven-dissipative systems,\nearlier theoretical studies were limited to the special case when the total\nspin of the atomic ensemble is conserved. This assumption is not justified in\nmost experimental realizations. Our new approach allows us to analyze the\nproblem in a more general case, including the experimentally relevant case of\ndissipative processes that act on each atom individually and do not conserve\nthe total spin. We obtain a general expression for the position of the\ntransition, which contains as special cases the two previously known regimes:\ni) non-equilibrium systems with losses and conserved spin and ii) closed\nsystems in thermal equilibrium and with the Gibbs ensemble averaging over the\nvalues of the total spin. We perform a detailed study of different types of\nbaths and point out the possibility of a surprising non-monotonous dependence\nof the transition on the baths' parameters.\n", "  Negative differential resistance remains an attractive but elusive\nfunctionality, so far only finding niche applications. Atom scale entities have\nshown promising properties, but viability of device fabrication requires fuller\nunderstanding of electron dynamics than has been possible to date. Using an\nall-electronic time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy technique and a\nGreen's function transport model, we study an isolated dangling bond on a\nhydrogen terminated silicon surface. A robust negative differential resistance\nfeature is identified as a many body phenomenon related to occupation dependent\nelectron capture by a single atomic level. We measure all the time constants\ninvolved in this process and present atomically resolved, nanosecond timescale\nimages to simultaneously capture the spatial and temporal variation of the\nobserved feature.\n", "  The paradoxical aspect of integration of a social group has been highlighted\nby Peter Blau (Exchange and Power in Social Life, Wiley and Sons, 1964). During\nthe integration process, the group members simultaneously compete for social\nstatus and play the role of the audience. Here we show that when the\ncompetition prevails over the desire of approval, a sharp transition breaks all\nfriendly relations. However, as was described by Blau, people with high status\nare inclined to bother more with acceptance of others; this is achieved by\npraising others and revealing her/his own weak points. In our model, this\naction smooths the transition and improves interpersonal relations.\n", "  We explore the trap profiles of a two-dimensional atomic Fermi gas in the\npresence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and under an adiabatic rotation. We\nfirst consider a non-interacting gas and show that the competition between the\neffects of Rashba coupling on the local density of single-particle states and\nthe Coriolis effects caused by rotation gives rise to a characteristic\nring-shaped density profile that survives at experimentally-accessible\ntemperatures. Furthermore, Rashba splitting of the Landau levels takes the\ndensity profiles on a ziggurat shape in the rapid-rotation limit. We then\nconsider an interacting gas under the BCS mean-field approximation for local\npairing, and study the pair-breaking mechanism that is induced by the Coriolis\neffects on superfluidity, where we calculate the critical rotation frequencies\nboth for the onset of pair breaking and for the complete destruction of\nsuperfluidity in the system. In particular, by comparing the results of\nfully-quantum-mechanical Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach with those of\nsemi-classical local-density approximation, we construct extensive phase\ndiagrams for a wide-range of parameter regimes in the trap where the\naforementioned competition may, e.g., favor an outer normal edge that is\ncompletely phase separated from the central superfluid core by vacuum.\n", "  We address the electromagnetic properties of two-dimensional electron gas\nconfined by a dielectric environment in the presence of both Rashba and\nDresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. It is demonstrated that off-diagonal\ncomponents of the conductivity tensor resulting from a delicate interplay\nbetween Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings lead to the hybridization of\ntransverse electric and transverse magnetic surface electromagnetic modes\nlocalized at the interface. We show that the characteristics of these hybrid\nsurface waves can be controlled by additional intense external off-resonant\ncoherent pumping.\n", "  Graviton loop corrections to observables in de Sitter space often lead to\ninfrared divergences. We show that these infrared divergences are resolved by\nthe spontaneous breaking of de Sitter invariance.\n", "  The results of this study are continuation of the research of Poincar\\'e\nchaos initiated in papers (Akhmet M, Fen MO. Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simulat\n2016;40:1-5; Akhmet M, Fen MO. Turk J Math, doi:10.3906/mat-1603-51, accepted).\nWe focus on the construction of an unpredictable function, continuous on the\nreal axis. As auxiliary results, unpredictable orbits for the symbolic dynamics\nand the logistic map are obtained. By shaping the unpredictable function as\nwell as Poisson function we have performed the first step in the development of\nthe theory of unpredictable solutions for differential and discrete equations.\nThe results are preliminary ones for deep analysis of chaos existence in\ndifferential and hybrid systems. Illustrative examples concerning unpredictable\nsolutions of differential equations are provided.\n", "  Using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations and an analytical approach we\ninvestigate the shear-induced, nonequilibrium dynamics of dense colloidal\nsuspensions confined to a narrow slit-pore. Focusing on situations where the\ncolloids arrange in well-defined layers with solidlike in-plane structure, the\nconfined films display complex, nonlinear behavior such as collective depinning\nand local transport via density excitations. These phenomena are reminiscent of\ncolloidal monolayers driven over a periodic substrate potential. In order to\ndeepen this connection, we present an effective model which maps the dynamics\nof the shear-driven colloidal layers to the motion of a single particle driven\nover an effective substrate potential. This model allows to estimate the\ncritical shear rate of the depinning transition based on the equilibrium\nconfiguration, revealing the impact of important parameters such as the\nslit-pore width and the interaction strength. We then turn to heterogeneous\nsystems where a layer of small colloids is sheared with respect to bottom\nlayers of large particles. For these incommensurate systems we find that the\nparticle transport is dominated by density excitations resembling the so-called\n\"kink\" solutions of the Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model. In contrast to the FK\nmodel, however, the corresponding \"antikinks\" do not move.\n", "  We measured the isotope shift in the $^2$S$_{1/2}$-$^2$P$_{3/2}$ (D2)\ntransition in singly-ionized calcium ions using photon recoil spectroscopy. The\nhigh accuracy of the technique enables us to resolve the difference between the\nisotope shifts of this transition to the previously measured isotopic shifts of\nthe $^2$S$_{1/2}$-$^2$P$_{1/2}$ (D1) line. This so-called splitting isotope\nshift is extracted and exhibits a clear signature of field shift contributions.\nFrom the data we were able to extract the small difference of the field shift\ncoefficient and mass shifts between the two transitions with high accuracy.\nThis J-dependence is of relativistic origin and can be used to benchmark atomic\nstructure calculations. As a first step, we use several ab initio atomic\nstructure calculation methods to provide more accurate values for the field\nshift constants and their ratio. Remarkably, the high-accuracy value for the\nratio of the field shift constants extracted from the experimental data is\nlarger than all available theoretical predictions.\n", "  We have studied the magnetic properties of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, which\nfeatures a honeycomb lattice of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions, through macroscopic\ncharacterization and neutron diffraction on a powder sample. We have shown that\nthis material orders in a zig-zag antiferromagnetic structure. In addition to\nallowing a linear magnetoelectric coupling, this magnetic arrangement displays\nvery peculiar spatial magnetic correlations, larger in the honeycomb planes\nthan between the planes, which do not evolve with the temperature. We have\ninvestigated this behavior by Monte Carlo calculations using the\n$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ model on a honeycomb lattice with a small interplane\ninteraction. Our model reproduces the experimental neutron structure factor,\nalthough its absence of temperature evolution must be due to additional\ningredients, such as chemical disorder or quantum fluctuations enhanced by the\nproximity to a phase boundary.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the phase structure of a (1+1)-dimensional\nschematic quark model with four-quark interaction and in the presence of baryon\n($\\mu_B$), isospin ($\\mu_I$) and chiral isospin ($\\mu_{I5}$) chemical\npotentials. It is established that in the large-$N_c$ limit ($N_c$ is the\nnumber of colored quarks) there exists a duality correspondence between the\nchiral symmetry breaking phase and the charged pion condensation (PC) one. The\nrole and influence of this property on the phase structure of the model are\nstudied. Moreover, it is shown that the chemical potential $\\mu_{I5}$ promotes\nthe appearance of the charged PC phase with nonzero baryon density.\n", "  Multicomponent quantum Hall systems with internal degrees of freedom provide\na fertile ground for the emergence of exotic quantum liquids. Here we\ninvestigate the possibility of non-Abelian topological order in the half-filled\nfractional quantum Hall (FQH) bilayer system driven by the tunneling effect\nbetween two layers. By means of the state-of-the-art density-matrix\nrenormalization group, we unveil \"finger print\" evidence of the non-Abelian\nMoore-Read Pfaffian state emerging in the intermediate-tunneling regime,\nincluding the ground-state degeneracy on the torus geometry and the topological\nentanglement spectroscopy (entanglement spectrum and topological entanglement\nentropy) on the spherical geometry, respectively. Remarkably, the phase\ntransition from the previously identified Abelian $(331)$ Halperin state to the\nnon-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state is determined to be continuous, which is\nsignaled by the continuous evolution of the universal part of the entanglement\nspectrum, and discontinuities in the excitation gap and the derivative of the\nground-state energy. Our results not only provide a \"proof-of-principle\"\ndemonstration of realizing a non-Abelian state through coupling different\ndegrees of freedom, but also open up a possibility in FQH bilayer systems for\ndetecting different chiral $p-$wave pairing states.\n", "  Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how the model output\ndepends on uncertainties (variances) in inputs and then identifies which inputs\nare important in contributing to the prediction imprecision. Uncertainty\ndetermination in output is the most crucial step in sensitivity analysis. In\nthe present paper, an analytic expression, which can exactly evaluate the\nuncertainty in output as a function of the output's derivatives and inputs'\ncentral moments, is firstly deduced for general multivariate models with given\nrelationship between output and inputs in terms of Taylor series expansion. A\n$\\gamma$-order relative uncertainty for output, denoted by\n$\\mathrm{R^{\\gamma}_v}$, is introduced to quantify the contributions of input\nuncertainty of different orders. On this basis, it is shown that the widely\nused approximation considering the first order contribution from the variance\nof input variable can satisfactorily express the output uncertainty only when\nthe input variance is very small or the input-output function is almost linear.\nTwo applications of the analytic formula are performed to the power grid and\neconomic systems where the sensitivity of both actual power output and Economic\nOrder Quantity models are analyzed. The importance of each input variable in\nresponse to the model outputs is quantified by the analytic formula.\n", "  We report the experimental results of temperature dependent polarized As\nK-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of LaFe1-xCoxAsO (x=0.0\nand 0.11) single-crystals. By aligning the Fe-As bond direction in the\ndirection of the x-ray beam polarization we have been able to identify an\nanomaly in the Fe-As bond correlations at the tetragonal to orthorhombic\ntransition at 150K, while previous investigations with standard unpolarized\nEXAFS of undoped LaFeAsO powder samples were not able to detect any such\nanomaly. Using our approach we have been able to identify in the\nsuperconducting doped sample, LaFe0.89Co0.11AsO, a broad anomaly around 60 K.\nThe low temperature anomaly has good correlations with the temperature\ndependence of several properties like resistivity, magnetic susceptibility,\nlinear thermal expansion, etc indicating the emergence of the dynamical\noscillations of the Fe - As pairs\n", "  Ratchet effect in a driven underdamped periodic potential system is studied.\nThe presence of a space dependent and periodic friction coefficient, but with a\nphase difference with the symmetric periodic potential is shown to generate\nsubstantial ratchet current.The ratchet performance is characterised in terms\nof the various parameters of transport. The performance of this ratchet is\ncompared with a ratchet with an underlying periodic and asymmetric potential.\nIt is shown that an optimum combination of inhomogeneity in the system and\nasymmetry of the potential can substantially enhance the performance of an\nunderdamped ratchet.\n", "  With the chiral quark model, we have calculated the axial charges of the\npentaquark states with $(I,I_3)=(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$ and\n$J^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}^{\\pm},\\frac{3}{2}^{\\pm},\\frac{5}{2}^{\\pm}$. The $P_c$ states\nwith the same $J^P$ quantum numbers but different color-spin-flavor\nconfigurations have very different axial charges, which encode important\ninformation on their underlying structures. For some of the\n$J^{P}=\\frac{3}{2}^{\\pm}$ or $\\frac{5}{2}^{\\pm}$ pentaquark states, their axial\ncharges are much smaller than that of the proton.\n", "  The effect of plasma environment on the atomic energy levels of He-like and\nLi-like Mg and Fe ions have been studied using Debye model. The\nequation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) and Fock-space coupled-cluster\n(FSCC) formalisms in the relativistic frame work have been adopted to describe\nthe atomic states and the energy levels of the above plasma embedded ions.\nSalient features of these methods have been described to account the two\nelectron screening effects through the Debye potentials. The two-body screening\npotential has been derived in the multipole expansion form to evaluate the\nreduced matrix elements in solving the equation of motion. Using this extended\nmodel, we have also predicted that quasi-degeneracy among the energy states\nhaving same principal quantum number ($n$) but different angular momentum ($l$)\nis slacken, whereas fine structure splitting is unaffected with increasing\nplasma strength. These knowledge are useful in estimatingradiative opacity,\nphotoionization cross sections, line intensities, etc of the aforementioned\nastrophysical plasmas.\n", "  The Covariant Spectator Theory (CST) is used to calculate the mass spectrum\nand vertex functions of heavy-light and heavy mesons in Minkowski space. The\ncovariant kernel contains Lorentz scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector\ncontributions. The numerical calculations are performed in momentum space,\nwhere special care is taken to treat the strong singularities present in the\nconfining kernel. The observed meson spectrum is very well reproduced after\nfitting a small number of model parameters. Remarkably, a fit to a few\npseudoscalar meson states only, which are insensitive to spin-orbit and tensor\nforces and do not allow to separate the spin-spin from the central interaction,\nleads to essentially the same model parameters as a more general fit. This\ndemonstrates that the covariance of the chosen interaction kernel is\nresponsible for the very accurate prediction of the spin-dependent\nquark-antiquark interactions.\n", "  We report on a novel dynamic phase in electrical networks, in which current\nchannels perpetually change in time. This occurs when the individual elements\nof the network are fuse-antifuse devices, namely, become insulators within a\ncertain finite interval of local applied voltages. As a consequence, the\nmacroscopic current exhibits temporal fluctuations which increase with system\nsize. We determine the conditions under which this exotic situation appears by\nestablishing a phase diagram as a function of the applied field and the size of\nthe insulating window. Besides its obvious application as a versatile\nelectronic device, due to its rich variety of behaviors, this network model\nprovides a possible description for particle-laden flow through porous media\nleading to dynamical clogging and reopening of the local channels in the pore\nspace.\n", "  We prove that abelian Yang-Baxter deformations of superstring coset sigma\nmodels are equivalent to sequences of commuting TsT transformations, meaning T\ndualities and coordinate shifts. Our results extend also to fermionic\ndeformations and fermionic T duality, and naturally lead to a TsT subgroup of\nthe superduality group OSp(d_b,d_b|2d_f). In cases like AdS_5 x S^5, fermionic\ndeformations necessarily lead to complex models. As an illustration of\ninequivalent deformations, we give all six abelian deformations of AdS_3. We\ncomment on the possible dual field theory interpretation of these (super-)TsT\nmodels.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the energetic\nstability and the electronic properties of (i) a single layer phosphorene (SLP)\nadsorbed on the amorphous sio2 surface (SLP/a-sio2), and (ii) the further\nincorporation of water molecules at the phosphorene/a-sio2 interface. In (i),\nwe find that the phosphorene sheet bonds to a-sio2 through van der Waals\ninteractions, even upon the presence of oxygen vacancy on the surface. The\n\\slp/a-\\sio\\ system presents a type-I band alignment, with the valence\n(conduction) band maximum (minimum) of the phosphorene lying within the energy\ngap of the a-\\sio\\ substrate. The structural, and the surface-potential\ncorrugations promote the formation of electron-rich and -poor regions on the\nphosphorene sheet and at the SLP/a-sio2 interface. Such charge density puddles\nhave been strengthened by the presence of oxygen vacancies in a-sio2. In (ii),\ndue to the amorphous structure of the surface, we have considered a number of\nplausible geometries of water embedded in the SLP/a-sio2 interface. There is an\nenergetic preference to the formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups on the a-sio2\nsurface. Meanwhile, upon the presence of oxygenated water or interstitial\noxygen in the phosphorene sheet, we find the formation of metastable OH bonded\nto the phosphorene, and the formation of energetically stable P--O--Si chemical\nbonds at the SLP/a-sio2 interface. Further x-ray absorption spectra (XAS)\nsimulations have been done, aiming to provide additional structural/electronic\ninformations of the oxygen atoms forming hydroxyl groups or P--O--Si chemical\nbonds at the interface region.\n", "  We derive an equation for the current of particles in energy space; particles\nare subject to a mean field effective potential that may represent quantum\neffects. From the assumption that non-interacting particles imply a free\ndiffusion coefficient in energy space we derive Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac\nand Bose-Einstein statistics. Other new statistics are associated to a free\ndiffusion coefficient; their thermodynamic properties are analyzed using the\ngrand partition function. A negative relation between pressure and energy\ndensity for low temperatures can be derived, suggesting a possible connection\nwith cosmological dark energy models.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy (EE) for pure gauge theories in 1+1\ndimensions with the lattice regularization. Using the definition of the EE for\nlattice gauge theories proposed in a previous paper [1] (S. Aoki, T. Iritani,\nM. Nozaki, T. Numasawa, N. Shiba and H. Tasaki, JHEP 1506 (2015) 187), we\ncalculate the EE for arbitrary pure as well as mixed states in terms of\neigenstates of the transfer matrix in 1+1 dimensional lattice gauge theory. We\nfind that the EE of an arbitrary pure state does not depend on the lattice\nspacing, thus giving the EE in the continuum limit, and show that the EE for an\narbitrary pure state is independent of the real (Minkowski) time evolution. We\nalso explicitly demonstrate the dependence of EE on the gauge fixing at the\nboundaries between two subspaces, which was pointed out for general cases in\nthe paper [1]. In addition, we calculate the EE at zero as well as finite\ntemperature by the replica method, and show that our result in the continuum\nlimit corresponds to the result obtained before in the continuum theory, with a\nspecific value of the counter term, which is otherwise arbitrary in the\ncontinuum calculation. We confirm the gauge dependence of the EE also for the\nreplica method.\n", "  We construct and classify chiral topological phases in driven (Floquet)\nsystems of strongly interacting bosons, with finite-dimensional site Hilbert\nspaces, in two spatial dimensions. The construction proceeds by introducing\nexactly soluble models with chiral edges, which in the presence of many-body\nlocalization (MBL) in the bulk are argued to lead to stable chiral phases.\nThese chiral phases do not require any symmetry, and in fact owe their\nexistence to the absence of energy conservation in driven systems.\nSurprisingly, we show that they are classified by a quantized many-body index,\nwhich is well defined for any MBL Floquet system. The value of this index,\nwhich is always the logarithm of a positive rational number, can be interpreted\nas the entropy per Floquet cycle pumped along the edge, formalizing the notion\nof quantum-information flow. We explicitly compute this index for specific\nmodels, and show that the nontrivial topology leads to edge thermalization,\nwhich provides an interesting link between bulk topology and chaos at the edge.\nWe also discuss chiral Floquet phases in interacting fermionic systems and\ntheir relation to chiral bosonic phases.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the problem of a nematic liquid crystal in contact\nwith patterned substrates. The substrate is modelled as a periodic array of\nparallel infinite grooves of well-defined cross section sculpted on a\nchemically homogeneous substrate which favors local homeotropic anchoring of\nthe nematic. We consider three cases: a sawtooth, a crenellated and a\nsinusoidal substrate. We analyse this problem within the modified Frank-Oseen\nformalism. We argue that, for substrate periodicities much larger than the\nextrapolation length, the existence of different nematic textures with distinct\nfar-field orientations, as well as the anchoring transitions between them, are\nassociated with the presence of topological defects either on or close to the\nsubstrate. For the sawtooth and sinusoidal case, we observe a homeotropic to\nplanar anchoring transition as the substrate roughness is increased. On the\nother hand, a homeotropic to oblique anchoring transition is observed for\ncrenellated substrates. In this case, the anchoring phase diagram shows a\ncomplex dependence on the substrate roughness and substrate anchoring strength.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves originated from strongly\nfirst order electroweak phase transition in the extended Higgs model with a\nreal singlet field. In order to calculate the bubble nucleation rate, we\nperform a two-field analysis to evaluate bounce solutions connecting the true\nand the false vacua using the one-loop effective potential at finite\ntemperatures. Imposing the Sakharov condition of the departure from thermal\nequilibrium for baryogenesis, we survey allowed regions of parameters of the\nmodel. We then investigate the gravitational waves produced at electroweak\nbubble collisions in the early Universe, such as the sound wave, the bubble\nwall collision and the plasma turbulence. We find that the strength at the peak\nfrequency can be large enough to be detected at future space-based\ngravitational interferometers such as eLISA, DECIGO and BBO. Predicted\ndeviations in the various Higgs boson couplings are also evaluated at the zero\ntemperature, and are shown to be large enough too. Therefore, in this model\nstrongly first order electroweak phase transition can be tested by the\ncombination of the precision study of various Higgs boson couplings at LHC, the\nmeasurement of the triple Higgs boson coupling at future lepton colliders and\nthe shape of the spectrum of gravitational wave detectable at future\ngravitational interferometers.\n", "  Driven Langevin processes have appeared in a variety of fields due to the\nrelevance of natural phenomena having both deterministic and stochastic\neffects. The stochastic currents and fluxes in these systems provide a\nconvenient set of observables to describe their non-equilibrium steady states.\nHere we consider stochastic motion of a (k - 1)-dimensional object, which\nsweeps out a k-dimensional trajectory, and gives rise to a higher k-dimensional\ncurrent. By employing the low-temperature (low-noise) limit, we reduce the\nproblem to a discrete Markov chain model on a CW complex, a topological\nconstruction which generalizes the notion of a graph. This reduction allows the\nmean fluxes and currents of the process to be expressed in terms of solutions\nto the discrete Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck (SFP) equation. Taking the\nadiabatic limit, we show that generic driving leads to rational quantization of\nthe generated higher dimensional current. The latter is achieved by\nimplementing the recently developed tools, coined the higher-dimensional\nKirchhoff tree and co-tree theorems. This extends the study of motion of\nextended objects in the continuous setting performed in the prequel to this\nmanuscript.\n", "  The probability distributions, as well as the mean values of stochastic\ncurrents and fluxes, associated with a driven Langevin process, provide a good\nand topologically protected measure of how far a stochastic system is driven\nout of equilibrium. By viewing a Langevin process on a compact oriented\nmanifold of arbitrary dimension m as a theory of a random vector field\nassociated with the environment, we are able to consider stochastic motion of\nhigher-dimensional objects, which allow new observables, called\nhigher-dimensional currents, to be introduced. These higher dimensional\ncurrents arise by counting intersections of a k-dimensional trajectory,\nproduced by a evolving (k-1)-dimensional cycle, with a reference cross section,\nrepresented by a cycle of complimentary dimension (m - k). We further express\nthe mean fluxes in terms of the solutions of the Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck\n(SFP), thus generalizing the corresponding well-known expressions for the\nconventional currents.\n", "  We report on a theoretical study of the $\\pi^- p \\to a^-_1(1260) p$ and\n$\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^- \\rho^0 p$ reactions near threshold within an effective\nLagrangian approach. The production process is described by $t$-channel\n$\\rho^0$ meson exchange. For the $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^- \\rho^0 p$ reaction, the\nfinal $\\pi^- \\rho^0$ results from the decay of the $a_1(1260)$ resonance which\nis assumed as a dynamically generated state from the $K^* \\bar K$ and $\\rho\n\\pi$ coupled channel interactions. We calculate the total cross section of the\n$\\pi^- p \\to a^-_1(1260) p$ reaction. It is shown that, with the coupling\nconstant of the $a_1(1260)$ to $\\rho \\pi$ channel obtained from the chiral\nunitary theory and a cut off parameter $\\Lambda_\\rho \\sim 1.5$ GeV in the form\nfactors, the experimental measurement can be reproduced. Furthermore, the total\nand differential cross sections of $\\pi^- p \\to a^-_1(1260) p \\to \\pi^- \\rho^0\np$ reaction are evaluated, and it is expected that our model calculations can\nbe tested by future experiments. These reactions are important for the study of\nthe $a_1(1260)$ resonance and would provide further clue for the nature of\n$a_1(1260)$ state.\n", "  We present a new measurement-based scheme for performing braiding operations\non Majorana zero modes and for detecting their non-Abelian statistics without\nmoving or hybridizing them. In our scheme, the topological qubit encoded in any\npair of well-separated Majorana zero modes in a mesoscopic superconductor\nisland is read out from the transmission phase shift in electron teleportation\nthrough the island in the Coulomb blockade regime. We propose experimental\nsetups to measure the teleportation phase shift via conductance in an electron\ninterferometer or persistent current in a closed loop.\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model predict the existence of\nnon-topological solitons, $Q$-balls. Assuming the standard cosmological history\npreceded by inflation, $Q$-balls can form in the early universe and can make up\nthe dark matter. The relatively large masses of such dark-matter particles\nimply a low number density, making direct detection very challenging. The\nstrongest limits come from the existence of neutron stars because, if a\nbaryonic $Q$-ball is captured by a neutron star, the $Q$-ball can absorb the\nbaryon number releasing energy and eventually destroying a neutron star.\nHowever, in the presence of baryon number violating higher-dimension operators,\nthe growth of a $Q$-ball inside a neutron star is hampered once the $Q$-ball\nreaches a certain size. We re-examine the limits and identify some classes of\nhigher-dimensional operators for which supersymmetric $Q$-balls can account for\ndark matter. The present limits leave a wide range of parameters available for\ndark matter in the form of supersymmetric $Q$-balls.\n", "  We consider the $\\Omega$-deformed $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory in\nfour dimensions with $N_{f}=4$ massive fundamental hypermultiplets. The low\nenergy effective action depends on the deformation parameters $\\varepsilon_{1},\n\\varepsilon_{2}$, the scalar field expectation value $a$, and the\nhypermultiplet masses ${\\bf m}=(m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}, m_{4})$. Motivated by\nrecent findings in the $\\mathcal{N}=2^{*}$ theory, we explore the theories that\nare characterized by special fixed ratios $\\varepsilon_{2}/\\varepsilon_{1}$ and\n${\\bf m}/\\varepsilon_{1}$ and propose a simple condition on the structure of\nthe multi-instanton contributions to the prepotential determining the effective\naction. This condition determines a finite set $\\Pi_{N}$ of special points such\nthat the prepotential has $N$ poles at fixed positions independent on the\ninstanton number. In analogy with what happens in the $\\mathcal{N}=2^{*}$ gauge\ntheory, the full prepotential of the $\\Pi_{N}$ theories may be given in closed\nform as an explicit function of $a$ and the modular parameter $q$ appearing in\nspecial combinations of Eisenstein series and Jacobi theta functions with well\ndefined modular properties. The resulting finite pole partition functions are\nrelated by AGT correspondence to special 4-point spherical conformal blocks of\nthe Virasoro algebra. We examine in full details special cases where the closed\nexpression of the block is known and confirms our Ansatz. We systematically\nstudy the special features of Zamolodchikov's recursion for the $\\Pi_{N}$\nconformal blocks. As a result, we provide a novel effective recursion relation\nthat can be exactly solved and allows to prove the conjectured closed\nexpressions analytically in the case of the $\\Pi_{1}$ and $\\Pi_{2}$ conformal\nblocks.\n", "  We propose a new method for creating far-field optical barrier potentials for\nultracold atoms with widths that are narrower than the diffraction limit and\ncan approach tens of nanometers. The reduced widths stem from the nonlinear\natomic response to control fields that create spatially varying dark\nresonances. The subwavelenth barrier is the result of the geometric scalar\npotential experienced by an atom prepared in such a spatially varying dark\nstate. The performance of this technique, as well as its applications to the\nstudy of many-body physics and to the implementation of quantum information\nprotocols with ultracold atoms, are discussed, with a focus on the\nimplementation of tunnel junctions.\n", "  Large spin splitting in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of\nferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs), predicted by the influential mean-field\nZener model[1,2] and assumed in many spintronic device proposals[3-8], has\nnever been observed in the mainstream p-type Mn-doped FMSs[9-15]. Here using\ntunnelling spectroscopy in Esaki-diode structures, we report the observation of\nsuch a large spontaneous spin-splitting energy ({\\Delta}E = 31.7 - 50 meV) in\nthe CB bottom of n-type FMS (In,Fe)As, which is surprising considering the very\nweak s-d exchange interaction reported in several zinc-blende (ZB) type\nsemiconductors[16,17]. The mean-field Zener model also fails to explain\nconsistently the ferromagnetism and the spin splitting energy {\\Delta}E of\n(In,Fe)As, because we found that the Curie temperature (TC) values calculated\nusing the observed {\\Delta}E are much lower than the experimental TC by a\nfactor of 400. These results urge the need for a more sophisticated theory of\nFMSs. Furthermore, bias-dependent tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(TAMR) reveals the magnetic anisotropy of each component of the (In,Fe)As band\nstructure [CB, VB, and impurity band (IB)]. The results suggest that the energy\nrange of IB overlaps with the CB bottom or VB top, which may be important to\nunderstand the strong s-d exchange interaction in (In,Fe)As[18,19].\n", "  We use a DEM simulation and analytical considerations to study the dynamics\nof a self-energised object, modelled as a disc, oscillating horizontally within\na two-dimesional bed of denser and smaller particles. We find that, for given\nmaterial parameters, the immersed object (IO) may rise, sink or not change\ndepth, depending on the oscillation amplitude and frequency, as well as on the\ninitial depth. With time, the IO settles at a specific depth that depends on\nthe oscillation parameters. We construct a phase diagram of this behaviour in\nthe oscillation frequency and velocity amplitude variable space. We explain the\nobserved rich behaviour by two competing effects: climbing on particles, which\nfill voids opening under the disc, and sinking due to bed fluidisation. We\npresent a cavity model that allows us to derive analytically general results,\nwhich agree very well with the observations and explain quantitatively the\nphase diagram. Our specific analytical results are the following. (i)\nDerivation of a critical frequency, $f_c$, above which the IO cannot float up\nagainst gravity. We show that this frequency depends only on the gravitational\nacceleration and the IO size. (ii) Derivation of a minimal amplitude,\n$A_{min}$, below which the IO cannot rise even if the frequency is below $f_c$.\nWe show that this amplitude also depends only on the gravitational acceleration\nand the IO size. (iii) Derivation of a critical value, $g_c$, of the IO's\nacceleration amplitude, below which the IO cannot sink. We show that the value\nof $g_c$ depends on the characteristics of both the IO and the granular bed,as\nwell as on the initial IO's depth.\n", "  We study a model of continuous opinion dynamics with both positive and\nnegative mutual interaction. The model shows a continuous phase transition\nbetween a phase with consensus (order) and a phase having no consensus\n(disorder). The mean field version of the model was already studied. Using\nextensive numerical simulations, we study the same model in $2$ and $3$\ndimensions. The critical points of the phase transitions for various cases and\nthe associated critical exponents have been estimated. The universality class\nof the phase transitions in the model is found to be same as Ising model in the\nrespective dimensions.\n", "  Here we report the successful growth of MoSe2 on single layer hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) on Ru(0001) substrate by using molecular beam epitaxy. We\ninvestigated the electronic structures of MoSe2 using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we found that the quasi-particle gap\nof the MoSe2 on hBN/Ru is about 0.25 eV smaller than those on graphene or\ngraphite substrates. We attribute this result to the strong interaction between\nhBN/Ru which causes residual metallic screening from the substrate. The surface\nof MoSe2 exhibits Moir\\'e pattern that replicates the Moir\\'e pattern of\nhBN/Ru. In addition, the electronic structure and the work function of MoSe2\nare modulated electrostatically with an amplitude of ~ 0.13 eV. Most\ninterestingly, this electrostatic modulation is spatially in phase with the\nMoir\\'e pattern of hBN on Ru(0001) whose surface also exhibits a work function\nmodulation of the same amplitude.\n", "  The model of neutrino mass matrix with minimal texture is now tightly\nconstrained by experiment so that it can yield a prediction for the phase of CP\nviolation. This phase is predicted to lie in the range $\\delta_{CP}=0.77\\pi -\n1.24\\pi$. If neutrino oscillation experiment would find the CP violation phase\noutside this range, this means that the minimal-texture neutrino mass matrix,\nthe element of which is all real, fails and the neutrino mass matrix must be\ncomplex, i.e., the phase must be present that is responsible for leptogenesis.\n", "  Recently, several experiments have illustrated that metal surface electrons\ncan be manipulated to form a two dimensional (2D) lattice by depositing a\ndesigner molecule lattice on metal surface. This offers a promising new\ntechnique to construct artificial 2D electron lattices. Here we theoretically\npropose a molecule lattice pattern to realize an artificial Lieb lattice on\nmetal surface, which shows a flat electronic band due to the lattice geometry.\nWe show that the localization of electrons in the flat band may be understood\nfrom the viewpoint of electron interference, which may be probed by measuring\nthe local density of states with the scanning tunnelling microscopy. Our\nproposal may be readily implemented in experiment and may offer an ideal solid\nstate platform to investigate the novel flat band physics of the Lieb lattice.\n", "  We present a high-temperature series expansion code for spin-1/2 Heisenberg\nmodels on arbitrary lattices. As an example we demonstrate how to use the\napplication for an anisotropic triangular lattice with two independent\ncouplings J1 and J2 and calculate the high-temperature series of the magnetic\nsusceptibility and the static structure factor up to 12th and 10th order,\nrespectively. We show how to extract effective coupling constants for the\ntriangular Heisenberg model from experimental data on Cs2CuBr4.\n", "  We extend the continuous-time interaction-expansion quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod with respect to measuring observables for fermion-boson lattice models.\nUsing generating functionals, we express expectation values involving boson\noperators, which are not directly accessible because simulations are done in\nterms of a purely fermionic action, as integrals over fermionic correlation\nfunctions. We also demonstrate that certain observables can be inferred\ndirectly from the vertex distribution, and present efficient estimators for the\ntotal energy and the phonon propagator of the Holstein model. Furthermore, we\ngeneralize the covariance estimator of the fidelity susceptibility, an unbiased\ndiagnostic for phase transitions, to the case of retarded interactions. The new\nestimators are applied to half-filled spinless and spinful Holstein models in\none dimension. The observed renormalization of the phonon mode across the\nPeierls transition in the spinless model suggests a soft-mode transition in the\nadiabatic regime. The critical point is associated with a minimum in the phonon\nkinetic energy and a maximum in the fidelity susceptibility.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the equilibrium properties and stochastic\ndynamic evolution of the U(1)-invariant relativistic complex field theory in\nthree dimensions. This model has been used to describe, in various limits,\nproperties of relativistic bosons at finite chemical potential, type II su-\nperconductors, magnetic materials and aspects of cosmology. We characterise the\nthermodynamic second-order phase transition in different ways. We study the\nequilibrium vortex configurations and their statistical and geometrical\nproperties in equilibrium at all temperatures. We show that at very high\ntemperature the statistics of the filaments is the one of fully-packed loop\nmodels. We identify the temperature, within the ordered phase, at which the\nnumber density of vortex lengths falls-off algebraically and we associate it to\na geometric percolation transition that we characterise in various ways. We\nmeasure the fractal properties of the vortex tangle at this threshold. Next, we\nperform infinite rate quenches from equilibrium in the disordered phase, across\nthe thermo- dynamic critical point, and deep into the ordered phase. We show\nthat three time regimes can be distinguished: a first approach towards a state\nthat, within numerical accuracy, shares many features with the one at the\npercolation threshold, a later coarsening process that does not alter, at\nsufficiently low temperature, the fractal properties of the long vortex loops,\nand a final approach to equilibrium. These features are independent of the\nreconnection rule used to build the vortex lines. In each of these regimes we\nidentify the various length-scales of the vortices in the system. We also study\nthe scaling properties of the ordering process and the progressive annihilation\nof topological defects and we prove that the time-dependence of the\ntime-evolving vortex tangle can be described within the dynamic scaling\nframework.\n", "  Stress is calculated routinely in atomistic simulations. The widely used\nmicroscopic stress formulas derived from classical or quantum mechanics,\nhowever, are distinct from the concept of Cauchy stress, i.e., the true\nmechanical tress. This work examines various atomistic stress formulations and\ntheir inconsistencies. Using standard mathematic theorems and the law of\nmechanics, we show that Cauchy stress results unambiguously from the definition\nof internal force density, thereby removing the long-standing confusion about\nthe atomistic basis of the fundamental property of Cauchy stress, and leading\nto a new atomistic formula for stress that has clear physical meaning and\nwell-defined values, satisfies conservation law, and is fully consistent with\nthe concept of Cauchy stress.\n", "  We demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator that is operated\nby a single atom and that relies on the chiral interaction between emitters and\ntransversally confined light. Like its counterparts in classical optics, our\ncirculator exhibits an inherent asymmetry between light propagation in the\nforward and the backward direction. However, rather than a magnetic field or a\ntemporal modulation, it is the internal quantum state of the atom that controls\nthe operation direction of the circulator. This working principle is compatible\nwith preparing the circulator in a coherent superposition of its operational\nstates. Such a quantum circulator may thus become a key element for routing and\nprocessing quantum information in scalable integrated optical circuits.\nMoreover, it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level,\nthereby enabling, e.g., photon number-dependent routing and novel quantum\nsimulation protocols.\n", "  If neutrinos are truly Dirac fermions, the smallness of their masses may\nstill be natural if certain symmetries exist beyond those of the standard model\nof quarks and leptons. We perform a systematic study of how this may occur at\ntree level and in one loop. We also propose a scotogenic version of the\nleft-right gauge model with naturally small Dirac neutrino masses in one loop.\n", "  The transfer of conserved charges through insulating matter via smooth\ndeformations of the Hamiltonian is known as quantum adiabatic, or Thouless,\npumping. Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum\npumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,\npumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of\nHamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved\nsymmetries. As such, we distinguish the scenarios of closed/open paths of\nHamiltonian evolution, finding that different closed cycles can lead to the\npumping of different quantum numbers, and that different open paths may point\nto distinct scenarios for surface physics. As explicit examples, we consider\nmodels similar to simple models used to describe topological insulators, but\nwith doubled degrees of freedom compared to a minimal topological insulator\nmodel. The extra fermionic flavors from doubling allow for extra gapping\nterms/adiabatic parameters - besides the usual topological mass which preserves\nthe topology-protecting discrete symmetries - generating an enlarged adiabatic\nparameter-space. We consider cases in one and three \\emph{spatial} dimensions,\nand our results in three dimensions may be realized in the context of\ncrystalline topological insulators, as we briefly discuss.\n", "  Using the two-loop analysis and the background field method we demonstrate\nthat the local pure scaling operators without derivatives in the Finkel'stein\nnonlinear sigma model can be constructed by straightforward generalization of\nthe corresponding operators for the noninteracting case. These pure scaling\noperators demonstrate multifractal behavior and describe mesoscopic\nfluctuations of the single-particle Green's function. We determine anomalous\ndimensions of all such pure scaling operators in the interacting theory within\nthe two-loop approximation.\n", "  Fibroblast-myocyte coupling can modulate electrical-wave dynamics in cardiac\ntissue. In diseased hearts, the distribution of fibroblasts is heterogeneous,\nso there can be gradients in the fibroblast density (henceforth we call this\nGFD) especially from highly injured regions, like infarcted or ischemic zones,\nto less-wounded regions of the tissue. Fibrotic hearts are known to be prone to\narrhythmias, so it is important to understand the effects of GFD in the\nformation and sustenance of arrhythmic re- entrant waves, like spiral or scroll\nwaves. Therefore, we investigate the effects of GFD on the stability of spiral\nand scroll waves of electrical activation in a state-of-the- art mathematical\nmodel for cardiac tissue in which we also include fibroblasts. By introducing\nGFD in controlled ways, we show that spiral and scroll waves can be unstable in\nthe presence of GFDs because of regions with varying spiral or scroll-wave\nfrequency {\\omega}, induced by the GFD. We examine the effects of the resting\nmembrane potential of the fibroblast and the number of fibroblasts attached to\nthe myocytes on the stability of these waves. Finally, we show that the\npresence of GFDs can lead to the formation of spiral waves at high-frequency\npacing.\n", "  Single crystals of the new compound CeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58 have been grown by\nhigh-temperature solution growth method using a eutectic Al-Si mixture as flux.\nThis compound is derived from the binary CeSi2 (tetragonal ThSi2-type, Pearson\nsymbol tI12, space group I41/amd) obtained by partial substitution of Si by Cu\nand Al atoms but showing full occupation of the Si crystal site (8e). While\nCeSi2 is a well-known valence-fluctuating paramagnetic compound, the\nCeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58 phase orders ferromagnetically at TC = 9.3 K. At low\ntemperatures the easy-axis of magnetization is along the a-axis, which\nre-orients itself along the c-axis above 30 K. The presence of hysteresis in\nthe magnetization curve, negative temperature coefficient of resistivity at\nhigh temperatures, reduced jump in the heat capacity and a relatively lower\nentropy released up to the ordering temperature, and enhanced Sommerfeld\ncoefficient (~100 mJ/mol K2) show that CeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58 is a Kondo lattice\nferromagnetic, moderate heavy fermion compound. Analysis of the high\ntemperature heat capacity data in the paramagnetic region lets us infer that\nthe crystal electric field split doublet levels are located at 178 and 357 K,\nrespectively, and Kondo temperature (8.4 K) is of the order of TC in\nCeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58.\n", "  Control of thin film stoichiometry is of primary relevance to achieve desired\nfunctionality. Pulsed laser deposition ablating from binary-oxide targets\n(sequential deposition) can be applied to precisely control the film\ncomposition, offsetting the importance of growth conditions on the film\nstoichiometry. In this work, we demonstrate that the cation stoichiometry of\nSrTiO$_3$ thin films can be finely tuned by sequential deposition from SrO and\nTiO$_2$ targets. Homoepitaxial SrTiO$_3$ films were deposited at different\nsubstrate temperatures and Ti/Sr pulse ratios, allowing the establishment of a\ngrowth window for stoichiometric SrTiO$_3$. The growth kinetics and nucleation\nprocesses were studied by reflection high-energy electron diffraction and\natomic force microscopy, providing information about the growth mode and the\ndegree of off-stoichiometry. At the optimal (stoichiometric) growth conditions,\nfilms exhibit atomically flat surfaces, whereas off-stoichiometry is\naccommodated by crystal defects, 3D islands and/or surface precipitates\ndepending on the substrate temperature and the excess cation. This technique\nopens the way to precisely control stoichiometry and doping of oxide thin\nfilms.\n", "  The effect of gain and loss of esteem is introduced into the equations of\ntime evolution of social relations, hostile or friendly, in a group of actors.\nThe equations allow for asymmetric relations. We prove that in the presence of\nthis asymmetry, the majority of stable solutions are jammed states, i.e. the\nHeider balance is not attained there. A phase diagram is constructed with three\nphases: the jammed phase, the balanced phase with two mutually hostile groups,\nand the phase of so-called paradise, where all relations are friendly.\n", "  We consider eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ perturbed by a generic\nperturbation $V$ modelled by a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble\n(GUE). Using the supersymmetry approach we derive analytical results for the\nstatistics of the eigenvectors, which are non-perturbative in $V$ and valid for\nan arbitrary deterministic $H_0$. Further we generalise them to the case of a\nrandom $H_0$, focusing, in particular, on the Rosenzweig-Porter model. Our\nanalytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  We propose a new method to probe the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM)\nbeyond the virial radius (R_200) of a cluster of galaxies, where X-ray\nobservations are not easily achievable. In this method, we use dispersion\nmeasures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) that appear behind the cluster and\nthe Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect towards the cluster. The DMs reflect the\ndensity of the intracluster medium (ICM) including the WHIM. If we observe a\nsufficient number of FRBs in the direction of the cluster, we can derive the\ndensity profile from the DMs. Similarly, we can derive the pressure profile\nfrom the SZ effect. By combining the density and the pressure profiles, the\ntemperature profile can be obtained. Based on mock observations of nearby\nclusters, we find that the density of the WHIM can be determined even at > 2\nR_200 from the cluster center when FRB observations with the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) become available. The temperature can be derived out to r~ 1.5\nR_200, and the radius is limited by the current sensitivity of SZ observations.\n", "  The LHCb experiment is designed to study properties and decays of heavy\nflavored hadrons produced from $pp$ collisions at the LHC. During Run~1, it has\nrecorded the world's largest data sample of beauty and charm hadrons, enabling\nprecision spectroscopy studies of such particles. Several important results\nobtained by LHCb, such as the discovery of the first pentaquark states and the\nfirst unambiguous determination of the $Z_c(4430)^-$ as an exotic state, have\ndramatically increased the interest on spectroscopy of heavy hadrons. An\noverview of the latest LHCb results on the subject, including the discovery of\nfour strange exotic states decaying as $X \\to J/\\psi \\phi$, is presented. LHCb\nhas also made significant contributions to the field of $B_c^+$ physics, the\nlowest bound state of the heavy flavor $\\bar{b}$ and $c$ quarks. A synopsis of\nthe the latest results is given.\n", "  We demonstrate that the so-called pancake bounce of millimetric water\ndroplets on surfaces patterned with hydrophobic posts [Nat. Phys. 10, 515\n(2014)] can be reproduced on larger scales. In our experiment, a bed of nails\nplays the role of the structured surface and a water balloon models the water\ndroplet. The macroscopic version largely reproduces the features of the\nmicroscopic experiment, including the Weber number dependence and the reduced\ncontact time for pancake bouncing. The scalability of the experiment confirms\nthe mechanisms of pancake bouncing, and allows us to measure the force exerted\non the surface during the bounce. The experiment is simple and inexpensive and\nis an example where front-line research is accessible to student projects.\n", "  A microlensing survey by Sumi et al. (2011) exhibits an overabundance of\nshort-timescale events (STEs; t_E<2 days) relative to what is expected from\nknown stellar populations and a smooth power-law extrapolation down to the\nbrown dwarf regime. This excess has been interpreted as a population of\n~Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars by nearly twofold;\nhowever the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to\nwide-separation (a>~10 AU) and free-floating planets. Assuming these STEs are\nindeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these\nevents that can be explained by bound but wide-separation planets. We fit the\nobserved timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown\ndwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, finding and thus\ncorroborating the initial identification of an excess of STEs. We then include\na population of bound planets that are expected not to show signatures of the\nprimary lens (host) in their microlensing light curves and that are also\nconsistent with results from representative microlensing, radial velocity, and\ndirect imaging surveys. We find that bound planets alone cannot explain the\nentire STE excess without violating the constraints from the surveys we\nconsider and thus some fraction of these events must be due to free-floating\nplanets, if our model for bound planets holds. We estimate a median fraction of\nSTEs due to free-floating planets to be f=0.67 (0.23-0.85 at 95% confidence)\nwhen assuming \"hot-start\" planet evolutionary models and f=0.58 (0.14-0.83 at\n95% confidence) for \"cold-start\" models. Assuming a delta-function distribution\nof free-floating planets of mass m_p=2 M_Jup yields a number of free-floating\nplanets per main-sequence star of N=1.4 (0.48-1.8 at 95% confidence) in the\n\"hot-start\" case and N=1.2 (0.29-1.8 at 95% confidence) in the \"cold-start\"\ncase.\n", "  As a promising candidate system to realize topological superconductivity, the\nsystem of a 3D topological insulator (TI) grown on top of the s-wave\nsuperconductor has been extensively studied. To access the topological\nsuperconductivity experimentally, the 3D TI sample must be thin enough to allow\nfor Cooper pair tunneling to the exposed surface of TI. The use of magnetically\nordered dopants to break time-reversal symmetry may allow the surface of a TI\nto host Majorana fermion, which are believed to be a signature of topological\nsuperconductivity. In this work, we study a magnetically-doped thin film\nTI-superconductor hybrid systems. Considering the proximity induced order\nparameter in thin film of TI, we analyze the gap closing points of the\nHamiltonian and draw the phase diagram as a function of relevant parameters:\nthe hybridization gap, Zeeman energy, and chemical potential of the TI system.\nOur findings provide a useful guide in choosing relevant parameters to\nfacilitate the observation of topological superconductivity in thin film\nTI-superconductor hybrid systems. In addition, we further perform numerical\nanalysis on a TI proximity coupled to a s-wave superconductor and find that,\ndue to the spin-momentum locked nature of the surface states in TI, the induced\ns-wave order parameter of the surface states persists even at large magnitude\nof the Zeeman energy.\n", "  Two of the most striking experimental findings when investigating exciton\nspectra in cuprous oxide using high-resolution spectroscopy are the\nobservability and the fine structure splitting of $F$ excitons reported by J.\nThewes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 027402 (2015)]. These findings show that\nit is indispensable to account for the complex valence band structure and the\ncubic symmetry of the solid in the theory of excitons. This is all the more\nimportant for magnetoexcitons, where the external magnetic field reduces the\nsymmetry of the system even further. We present the theory of excitons in\n$\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$ in an external magnetic field and especially discuss the\ndependence of the spectra on the direction of the external magnetic field,\nwhich cannot be understood from a simple hydrogen-like model. Using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, we also present the corresponding experimental\nspectra for cuprous oxide in Faraday configuration. The theoretical results and\nexperimental spectra are in excellent agreement as regards not only the\nenergies but also the relative oscillator strengths. Furthermore, this\ncomparison allows for the determination of the fourth Luttinger parameter\n$\\kappa$ of this semiconductor.\n", "  We discuss the prospects of performing high-order perturbative calculations\nin systems characterized by a vanishing temperature but finite density. In\nparticular, we show that the determination of generic Feynman integrals\ncontaining fermionic chemical potentials can be reduced to the evaluation of\nthree-dimensional phase space integrals over vacuum on-shell amplitudes - a\nresult reminiscent of a previously proposed \"naive real-time formalism\" for\nvacuum diagrams. Applications of these rules are discussed in the context of\nthe thermodynamics of cold and dense QCD, where it is argued that they\nfacilitate an extension of the Equation of State of cold quark matter to higher\nperturbative orders.\n", "  Electronic structure properties of nanowires (NW) with diameters of 1.5 nm\nand 3 nm based on semimetallic $\\alpha$-Sn are investigated by employing\ndensity functional theory and perturbative $GW$ methods. We explore the\ndependence of electron affinity, band structure and band gap values with\ncrystallographic orientation, NW cross-sectional size and surface passivants of\nvarying electronegativity. We consider four chemical terminations in our study:\nmethyl ($\\rm{CH_3}$), hydrogen ($\\rm{H}$), hydroxyl ($\\rm{OH}$), and fluorine\n($\\rm{F}$). Results suggest a high degree of elasticity of Sn-Sn bonds within\nthe SnNWs' cores with no significant structural variations for nanowires with\ndifferent surface passivants. Direct band gaps at Brillouin zone centers are\nfound for most studied structures with quasi-particle corrected band gap\nmagnitudes ranging from 0.25 eV to 3.54 eV in 1.5 nm diameter structures\nindicating an exceptional range of properties for semimetal NWs below the\nsemimetal-to-semiconductor transition. Band gap variations induced by changes\nin surface passivants indicate the possibility of realizing\nsemimetal-semiconductor interfaces in NWs with constant cross-section and\ncrystallographic orientation allowing the design of novel dopant-free NW-based\nelectronic devices.\n", "  In many interesting physical systems, the determinant which appears from\nintegrating out fermions becomes complex, and its phase plays a crucial role in\nthe determination of the vacuum. An example of this is QCD at low temperature\nand high density, where various exotic fermion condensates are conjectured to\nform. Another example is the Euclidean version of the type IIB matrix model for\n10d superstring theory, where spontaneous breaking of the SO(10) rotational\nsymmetry down to SO(4) is expected to occur. When one applies the complex\nLangevin method to these systems, one encounters the singular-drift problem\nassociated with the appearance of nearly zero eigenvalues of the Dirac\noperator. Here we propose to avoid this problem by deforming the action with a\nfermion bilinear term. The results for the original system are obtained by\nextrapolations with respect to the deformation parameter. We demonstrate the\npower of this approach by applying it to a simple matrix model, in which\nspontaneous symmetry breaking from SO(4) to SO(2) is expected to occur due to\nthe phase of the complex fermion determinant. Unlike previous work based on a\nreweighting-type method, we are able to determine the true vacuum by\ncalculating the order parameters, which agree with the prediction by the\nGaussian expansion method.\n", "  Many lyotropic liquid crystals are composed of mesogens that display a\nconsiderable spread in size or shape affecting their material properties and\nthermodynamics via various demixing and multi-phase coexistence scenarios.\nStarting from a generalized Onsager theory we formulate a generic framework\nthat enables locating spinodal polydispersities as well as identifying the\nnature of incipient size fractionation for arbitrary model potentials and size\ndistributions. We apply our theory to nematic phases of both hard rods and\ndisks whose main particle dimension is described by a unimodal log-normal\ndistribution. We find that both rod-based and discotic nematics become unstable\nat a critical polydispersity of about 20 %. We also investigate the effect of\ndoping nematic assemblies with a small fraction of large species and highlight\ntheir effect on the stability of the uniform nematic fluid. We find that while\nrod-based are only weakly affected by the presence of large species, doping\ndiscotic nematics with very large platelets leads to a remarkable suppression\nof the spinodal instabilities. This could open up routes towards controlling\nthe mechanical properties of nematic materials by manipulating the local\nstability of nematic fluid and its tendency to undergo fractionation-driven\nmicrophase separation.\n", "  Type III bursts and hard X-rays are both produced by flare energetic electron\nbeams. The link between both emissions has been investigated in many previous\nstudies, but no statistical studies have compared both coronal and\ninterplanetary type III bursts with X-ray flares. Using coronal radio events\nabove 100 MHz exclusively from type III bursts, we revisited long-standing\nquestions: Do all coronal type III bursts have X-ray counterparts. What\ncorrelation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities. What X-ray and\nradio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary type III\nbursts below 14 MHz. We analysed data from 2002 to 2011 starting with coronal\ntype III bursts above 100 MHz. We used RHESSI X-ray data greater than 6 keV to\nmake a list of 321 events that have associated type III bursts and X-ray\nflares, encompassing at least 28 percent of the initial sample of type III\nevents. We examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and any\ninterplanetary radio signature. For our 321 events, the X-ray emission at 6 keV\nusually lasted longer than type III burst groups at frequencies greater than\n100 MHz. A weak correlation was found between the type III radio flux at\nfrequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25-50 keV, with an absence\nof events at high X-ray intensity and low type III radio flux. Interplanetary\ntype III bursts less than 14 MHz were observed for 54 percent of the events,\nincreasing when events were observed with 25-50 keV X-rays. A stronger\ninterplanetary association was present when 25-50 keV count rates were above\n250 counts per second or 170 MHz fluxes were greater than 1000 SFU, relating to\nmore energetic electrons above 25 keV and events where magnetic flux tubes\nextend into the high corona. On average type III bursts increase in flux with\ndecreasing frequency, the rate varies from event to event.\n", "  Phase-field simulation (PFS) have revolutionized the understanding of domain\nstructure and switching behavior in ferroelectric thin films and ceramics.\nGenerally, PFS is based on solution of a (set) of Ginzburg-Landau equations for\na defined order parameter field(s) under physical boundary conditions (BCs) of\nfixed potential or charge. While well-matched to the interfaces in bulk\nmaterials and devices, these BCs are generally not applicable to free\nferroelectric surfaces. Here, we developed a self-consistent phase-field model\nwith boundary conditions based on electrochemical equilibria. We chose\nPb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 ultrathin film consisting of (001) oriented single tetragonal\ndomain (Pz) as a model system, and systematically studied the effects of oxygen\npartial pressure, temperature and surface ion on the ferroelectric state, and\ncompared it with the case of complete screening. We have further explored the\npolarization switching induced by the oxygen partial pressure and observed\npronounced size effect induced by chemical screening. Our work thus helps to\nunderstand the emergent phenomena in ferroelectric thin films brought about by\nthe electrochemical ionic surface compensations.\n", "  Considering the interband correlation, we present a generalized\nmultiple-scattering approach of Green's function to investigate the effects of\nelectron-impurity scattering on the density of states in silicene. The\nreduction of energy gaps in the case of relatively high chemical potential and\nthe transformation of split-off impurity bands into band tails for low chemical\npotential are found. The dependency of optical conductivity on the impurity\nconcentration is also discussed for frequency within the terahertz regime.\n", "  While for a long time iron based superconductors have been investigated\nlooking at the average crystalline structure there is now growing interest on\nthe divergence of local from the average structure. Here we use advanced data\nanalysis of EXAFS, a fast and local probe, which has key advantages compared to\ncrystallographic measurements, in unveiling the dynamics of the local\nstructure. The results show that the Fe-As pair oscillates in the double-well\npotential both in undoped and in cobalt doped LaFeAsO crystals. The parameters\nand the characteristics of the double-well potential are determined by curve\nfits of the polarized EXAFS data. Temperature dependent Fe-As pair distribution\nand tunneling frequency are derived from selected model of two potential wells.\nWe observe the softening of the Fe-As oscillations at the tetragonal to\northorhombic structural phase transition at 150 K in LaFeAsO. A weak broad\nsoftening is observed while decreasing the temperature from 70 to 40 K in\nsuperconducting LaFe0.89Co0.11AsO which could be correlated with the onset of\nshort range charge density wave order.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a bipartite quantum system in a way such that its\nformal description keeps holding even if one of its parts becomes macroscopic:\nthe problem is related with the analysis of the quantum-to-classical crossover,\nbut our approach implies that the whole system stays genuinely quantum. Aim of\nthe work is to understand 1) if, 2) to what extent, and possibly 3) how, the\nevolution of a macroscopic environment testifies to the coupling with its\nmicroscopic quantum companion. To this purpose we consider a magnetic\nenvironment made of a large number of spin-1/2 particles, coupled with a\nquantum mechanical oscillator, possibly in the presence of an external magnetic\nfield. We take the value of the total environmental-spin S constant and large,\nwhich allows us to consider the environment as one single macroscopic system,\nand further deal with the hurdles of the spin-algebra via approximations that\nare valid in the large-S limit. We find an insightful expression for the\npropagator of the whole system, where we identify an effective \"back-action\"\nterm, i.e. an operator acting on the magnetic environment only, and yet missing\nin the absence of the quantum principal system. This operator emerges as a\ntime-dependent magnetic anisotropy whose character, whether uniaxial or planar,\nalso depends on the detuning between the level-splitting in the spectrum of the\nfree magnetic system, induced by the possible presence of the external field,\nand the frequency of the oscillator. The time-dependence of the anisotropy is\nanalysed, and its effects on the dynamics of the magnet, as well as its\nrelation with the entangling evolution of the overall system, are discussed.\n", "  We examine the surface term for the BRST transformation of the open pure\nspinor superstring in an AdS_5 x S^5 background. We find that the boundary\ncondition to eliminate the surface term leads to a classification of possible\nconfigurations of 1/2 supersymmetric D-branes.\n", "  We investigate measurement-based quantum communication with noisy resource\nstates that are generated by entanglement purification. We consider the\ntransmission of encoded information via noisy quantum channels using a\nmeasurement-based implementation of encoding, error correction and decoding. We\nshow that such an approach offers advantages over direct transmission,\ngate-based error correction and measurement-based schemes with direct\ngeneration of resource states. We analyze the noise structure of resource\nstates generated by entanglement purification and show that a local error\nmodel, i.e. noise acting independently on all qubits of the resource state, is\na good approximation in general, and provides an exact description for\n$GHZ$-states. The latter are resources for a measurement-based implementation\nof error correction codes for bit-flip or phase flip errors. This provides a\nfirst link between the recently found very high thresholds for fault-tolerant\nmeasurement-based quantum information processing based on local error models\nfor resource states, to error thresholds for gate based computational models.\n", "  We analyze limit cycle oscillators under perturbation constructed as a\nproduct of two signals, namely, an envelope with a period close to natural\nperiod of an oscillator and a high-frequency carrier signal. A theory for\nobtaining an envelope waveform that achieves the maximal frequency interval of\nentrained oscillators is presented. The optimization problem for fixed power\nand maximal allowed amplitude is solved by employing the phase reduction method\nand the Pontryagin's maximum principle. We have shown that the optimal envelope\nwaveform is a bang-bang-type solution. Also, we have found \"inversion\" symmetry\nthat relates two signals with different powers, but the same interval of\nentrained frequencies. The theoretical results are confirmed numerically on\nFitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators.\n", "  Structures and electronic properties of rhombohedral [111] and [110] bismuth\nnanowires are calculated with the use of density functional theory. The\nformation of an energy band gap from quantum confinement is studied and to\nimprove estimates for the band gap the GW approximation is applied. The [111]\noriented nanowires require surface bonds to be chemically saturated to avoid\nformation of metallic surface states whereas the surface of the [110] nanowires\ndo not support metallic surface states. It is found that the onset of quantum\nconfinement in the surface passivated [111] nanowires occurs at larger critical\ndimensions than for the [110] nanowires. For the [111] oriented nanowires it is\npredicted that a band gap of approximately 0.5 eV can be formed at a diameter\nof approximately 6 nm, whereas for the [110] oriented nanowires a diameter of\napproximately 3 nm is required to achieve a similar band gap energy. The GW\ncorrection is also applied to estimates of the electron affinity, ionisation\npotentials and work functions for both orientations of the nanowires for\nvarious diameters below 5 nm. The magnitude of the energy band gaps that arise\nin bismuth at critical dimensions of a few nanometers are of the same order as\nfor conventional bulk semiconductors.\n", "  We extend a recently introduced free-energy formalism for homogeneous\nFokker-Planck equations to a wide, and physically appealing, class of\ninhomogeneous nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations. In our approach, the\nfree-energy functional is expressed in terms of an entropic functional and an\nauxiliary potential, both derived from the coefficients of the equation. With\nreference to the introduced entropic functional, we discuss the entropy\nproduction in a relaxation process towards equilibrium. The properties of the\nstationary solutions of the considered Fokker-Planck equations are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Hamiltonian constraint operator in Loop Quantum Gravity acts\nultralocally. Smolin has argued that this ultralocality seems incompatible with\nthe existence of a quantum dynamics which propagates perturbations between\nmacroscopically seperated regions of quantum geometry. We present evidence to\nthe contrary within an LQG type `polymer' quantization of two dimensional\nParameterised Field Theory (PFT). PFT is a generally covariant reformulation of\nfree field propagation on flat spacetime. We show explicitly that while, as in\nLQG, the Hamiltonian constraint operator in PFT acts ultralocally, states in\nthe joint kernel of the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints of PFT\nnecessarily describe propagation effects. The particular structure of the\nfinite triangulation Hamiltonian constraint operator plays a crucial role, as\ndoes the necessity of imposing (the continuum limit of) its kinematic adjoint\nas a constraint. Propagation is seen as a property encoded by physical states\nin the kernel of the constraints rather than that of repeated actions of the\nfinite triangulation Hamiltonian constraint on kinematic states. The analysis\nyields robust structural lessons for putative constructions of the Hamiltonian\nconstraint in LQG for which ultralocal action co-exists with a description of\npropagation effects by physical states.\n", "  We study the efficiency of nonspinning waveform templates in gravitational\nwave searches for aligned-spin binary black holes (BBHs). We use PhenomD, which\nis the most recent phenomenological waveform model designed to generate the\nfull inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms emitted from BBHs with the spins\naligned with the orbital angular momentum. Here, we treat the effect of\naligned-spins with a single spin parameter $\\chi$. We consider the BBH signals\nwith moderately small spins in the range of $-0.4\\leq \\chi \\leq 0.4$. Using\nnonspinning templates, we calculate fitting factors of the aligned-spin signals\nin a wide mass range up to $\\sim 100 M_{\\odot}$. We find that the signals with\nnegative spins can have higher fitting factors than those with positive spins.\nIf $\\chi = 0.3$, only the highly asymmetric-mass signals can have the fitting\nfactors exceeding the threshold of 0.965, while the fitting factors for all of\nthe signals can be larger than the threshold if $\\chi = -0.3$. We demonstrate\nthat the discrepancy between the regions of a positive and a negative spins is\ndue to the physical boundary ($\\eta \\leq 0.25$) of the template parameter\nspace. We also show that the recovered mass parameters can be significantly\nbiased from the true parameters. We examine the impact of the systematic bias\non the parameter estimation by comparing the bias with the statistical error.\n", "  We propose an improved version of the color evaporation model to describe\nheavy quarkonium production. In contrast to the traditional color evaporation\nmodel, we impose the constraint that the invariant mass of the intermediate\nheavy quark-antiquark pair to be larger than the mass of produced quarkonium.\nWe also introduce a momentum shift between heavy quark-antiquark pair and the\nquarkonium. Numerical calculations show that our model can describe the\ncharmonium yields as well as ratio of $\\psi^\\prime$ over $J/\\psi$ better than\nthe traditional color evaporation model.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the exclusive Higgs decays $h\\to MZ$ and $h\\to\nMW$, where $M$ is a pseudoscalar or vector meson, using the QCD factorization\napproach. We allow for the presence of new-physics effects in the form of\nmodified Higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions, including the\npossibility of flavor-changing Higgs couplings. We show that the decays $h\\to\nVZ$ exhibit a strong sensitivity to the effective CP-even and CP-odd $h\\gamma\nZ$ couplings. When combined with a measurement of the $h\\to\\gamma Z$ decay\nrate, this can be used to extract these couplings up to a sign ambiguity in the\nCP-odd coefficient. Some of the $h\\to MW$ decay modes can be used to probe for\nflavor-violating Higgs couplings involving the top quark.\n", "  The Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment leads indistinguishable photons simultaneously\nreaching a 50:50 beam splitter to emerge on the same port through two-photon\ninterference. Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider numerical experiments\nof the same flavor for classical, {\\it wave} objects in the setting of\nrepulsive condensates. We examine dark solitons interacting with a repulsive\nbarrier, a case in which we find no significant asymmetries in the emerging\nwaves after the collision, presumably due to their topological nature. We also\nconsider case examples of two-component systems, where the dark solitons trap a\nbright structure in the second-component (dark-bright solitary waves). For\nthese, pronounced asymmetries upon collision {\\it are} possible for the\nnon-topological bright component. We also show an example of a similar\nphenomenology for ring dark-bright structures in two dimensions.\n", "  We consider stationary, axially symmetric toroids rotating around spinless\nblack holes, assuming the general-relativistic Keplerian rotation law, in the\nfirst post-Newtonian approximation. Numerical investigation shows that the\nangular momentum accumulates almost exclusively within toroids. It appears that\nvarious types of dragging (anti-dragging) effects are positively correlated\nwith the ratio $M_\\mathrm{D}/m$ ($M_\\mathrm{D}$ is the mass of a toroid and $m$\nis the mass of the black hole) - moreover, their maxima are proportional to\n$M_\\mathrm{D}/m$. The horizontal sizes of investigated toroids range from c. 50\nto c. 450 of Schwarzschild radii $R_\\mathrm{S}$ of the central black hole;\ntheir mass $M_\\mathrm{D} \\in (10^{-4}m, 40m)$ and the radial size of the system\nis c. 500 $R_\\mathrm{S}$. We found that the relative strength of various\ndragging (anti-dragging) effects does not change with the mass ratio, but it\ndepends on the size of toroids. Several isoperimetric inequalities involving\nangular momentum are shown to hold true.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength temporal analysis of the blazar 3C 454.3 during\nthe high $\\gamma$-ray active period from May-December, 2014. Except for X-rays,\nthe period is well sampled at near-infrared (NIR)-optical by the \\emph{SMARTS}\nfacility and the source is detected continuously on daily timescale in the\n\\emph{Fermi}-LAT $\\gamma$-ray band. The source exhibits diverse levels of\nvariability with many flaring/active states in the continuously sampled\n$\\gamma$-ray light curve which are also reflected in the NIR-optical light\ncurves and the sparsely sampled X-ray light curve by the \\emph{Swift}-XRT.\nMulti-band correlation analysis of this continuous segment during different\nactivity periods shows a change of state from no lags between IR and\n$\\gamma$-ray, optical and $\\gamma$-ray, and IR and optical to a state where\n$\\gamma$-ray lags the IR/optical by $\\sim$3 days. The results are consistent\nwith the previous studies of the same during various $\\gamma$-ray flaring and\nactive episodes of the source. This consistency, in turn, suggests an extended\nlocalized emission region with almost similar conditions during various\n$\\gamma$-ray activity states. On the other hand, the delay of $\\gamma$-ray with\nrespect to IR/optical and a trend similar to IR/optical in X-rays along with\nstrong broadband correlations favor magnetic field related origin with X-ray\nand $\\gamma$-ray being inverse Comptonized of IR/optical photons and external\nradiation field, respectively.\n", "  Vertex operators for photo- and electro-production of baryon states with\narbitrary spin-parity, $ \\gamma + N\\to B(J^P)$, are constructed. The operators\nobey gauge invariance and analyticity constraints. Analyticity is realized as a\nrequirement of the generalized Siegert theorem for vertex form factors.\n", "  Recent experiments involving tilted graphene samples have shown evidence of a\ncontinuous phase transition in the $\\nu=0$ quantum Hall bulk state. We present\nhere a simple model that supports such a transition. In addition to a long\nrange SU(4) symmetric Coulomb interaction, we include Hubbard on-site and\nnearest neighbor interactions with tunable coupling strengths, and perform a\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis. A large sea of negative energy Landau\nlevels is retained, and is shown to have important qualitative and quantitative\neffects. Phase diagrams are constructed within the space of physically relevant\nparameters, yielding results consistent with experimental observation.\n", "  Multiple chiral doublet bands (M$\\chi$D) in the $80$, 130 and $190$ mass\nregions are studied by the model of $\\gamma$=90$^{\\circ}$ triaxial rotor\ncoupled with identical symmetric proton-neutron configurations. By selecting\nthe suitable basis, the calculated wave functions are explicitly exhibited to\nbe symmetric under the operator $\\hat{A}$, which is defined as rotation by\n$90^{\\circ}$ about 3-axis with the exchange of valance proton and neutron. We\nfound that both $M1$ and $E2$ transitions are allowed between the levels with\ndifferent values of $A$, while are forbidden between the levels with same\nvalues of $A$. Such a selection rule holds true for M$\\chi$D in different mass\nregions.\n", "  We propose a new type of traveling wave pattern, one that can adapt to the\nsize of physical system in which it is embedded. Such a system arises when the\ninitial state has an instability that extends down to zero wavevector,\nconnecting at that point to two symmetry modes of the underlying dynamical\nsystem. The Min system of proteins in E. coli is such as system with the\nsymmetry emerging from the global conservation of two proteins, MinD and MinE.\nFor this and related systems, traveling waves can adiabatically deform as the\nsystem is increased in size without the increase in node number that would be\nexpected for an oscillatory version of a Turing instability containing an\nallowed wavenumber band with a finite minimum.\n", "  Radiative neutrino mass generation within supersymmetric (SUSY) construction\nis studied. The mechanism is considered where the lepton number violation is\noriginating from the soft SUSY breaking terms. This requires MSSM extensions\nwith states around the TeV scale. We present several explicit realizations\nbased on extensions either by MSSM singlet or SU(2)_w triplet states. Besides\nsome novelties of the proposed scenarios, various phenomenological implications\nare also discussed.\n", "  While it has been pointed out that the chiral symmetry, which is important\nfor the Dirac fermions in graphene, can be generalized to tilted Dirac fermions\nas in organic metals, such a generalized symmetry was so far defined only for a\ncontinuous low-energy Hamiltonian. Here we show that the generalized chiral\nsymmetry can be rigorously defined for lattice fermions as well. A key concept\nis a continuous \"algebraic deformation\" of Hamiltonians, which generates\nlattice models with the generalized chiral symmetry from those with the\nconventional chiral symmetry. This enables us to explicitly express zero modes\nof the deformed Hamiltonian in terms of that of the original Hamiltonian.\nAnother virtue is that the deformation can be extended to non-uniform systems,\nsuch as fermion-vortex systems and disordered systems. Application to fermion\nvortices in a deformed system shows how the zero modes for the conventional\nDirac fermions with vortices can be extended to the tilted case.\n", "  A search for dark matter line-like signals was performed in the vicinity of\nthe Galactic Centre by the H.E.S.S. experiment on observational data taken in\n2014. An unbinned likelihood analysis was developed to improve the sensitivity\nto line-like signals. The upgraded analysis along with newer data extend the\nenergy coverage of the previous measurement down to 100 GeV. The 18 h of data\ncollected with the H.E.S.S. array allow one to rule out at 95% CL the presence\nof a 130 GeV line (at $l = -1.5^{\\circ}, b = 0^{\\circ}$ and for a dark matter\nprofile centered at this location) previously reported in Fermi-LAT data. This\nnew analysis overlaps significantly in energy with previous Fermi-LAT and\nH.E.S.S. results. No significant excess associated with dark matter\nannihilations was found in the energy range 100 GeV to 2 TeV and upper limits\non the gamma-ray flux and the velocity weighted annihilation cross-section are\nderived adopting an Einasto dark matter halo profile. Expected limits for\npresent and future large statistics H.E.S.S. observations are also given.\n", "  Recent developments showed that hadron light-cone parton distributions could\nbe directly extracted from spacelike correlators, known as quasi parton\ndistributions, in the large hadron momentum limit. Unlike the normal light-cone\nparton distribution, a quasi parton distribution contains ultraviolet (UV)\npower divergence associated with the Wilson line self energy. We show that to\nall orders in the coupling expansion, the power divergence can be removed by a\n\"mass\" counterterm in the auxiliary $z$-field formalism, in the same way as the\nrenormalization of power divergence for an open Wilson line. After adding this\ncounterterm, the quasi quark distribution is improved such that it contains at\nmost logarithmic divergences. Based on a simple version of discretized gauge\naction, we present the one-loop matching kernel between the improved\nnon-singlet quasi quark distribution with a lattice regulator and the\ncorresponding quark distribution in dimensional regularization.\n", "  We consider a scalar particle in a background formed by two\ncounter-propagating plane waves. Two cases are studied: i) dynamics at a\nmagnetic node and ii) zero initial transverse canonical momentum. The Lorentz\nand Klein-Gordon equations are solved for these cases and approximations\nanalysed. For the magnetic node solution (homogeneous, time-dependent electric\nfield), the modified Volkov wavefunction which arises from a high-energy\napproximation is found to be inaccurate for all energies and the solution\nitself unstable when photon emission (nonlinear Compton scattering) is\nincluded. For the zero initial transverse canonical momentum case, in both\nquantum and classical cases, forbidden parameter regimes, absent in the plane\nwave model, are identified.\n", "  We present a new mode-sum regularization prescription for computing the\nvacuum polarization of a scalar field in static spherically-symmetric black\nhole spacetimes in odd dimensions. This is the first general and systematic\napproach to regularized vacuum polarization in higher dimensions. Remarkably,\nthe regularization parameters can be computed in closed form in arbitrary\ndimensions and for arbitrary metric function $f(r)$. In fact, we show that in\nspite of the increasing severity and number of the divergences to be\nregularized, the method presented is mostly agnostic to the number of\ndimensions. Finally, as an explicit example of our method, we show plots for\nvacuum polarization in the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetime for odd\n$d=5,...,11$.\n", "  We report systematic measurements of anomalous Hall effect(AHE) and spin\norbit torques(SOT) in MnGa/IrMn films,, in which a single MnGa epitaxial layer\nreveals obvious orbital two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect. As increasing the\nthickness of the antiferromagnet IrMn, the strong spin Hall effect(SHE)has\ngradually suppressed the orbital 2CK effect and modified the AHE of MnGa.A\nscaling involving multiple competing scattering mechanisms has been used to\ndistinguish different contributions to the modified AHE. Finally, the sizeable\nSOT in the MnGa/IrMn films induced by the strong SHE of IrMn have been\ninvestigated.The IrMn layer also supplies an in-plane exchange bias field and\nenables nearly field-free magnetization reversal.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dispersive interaction of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) trapped inside an optomechanical cavity with a moving end\nmirror in the presence of the laser phase noise (LPN) as well as the atomic\ncollisions. We assume that the effective frequency of the optical mode is much\ngreater than those of the mechanical and the Bogoliubov modes of the movable\nmirror and the BEC . In the adiabatic approximation where the damping rate of\nthe cavity is faster than those of the other modes, the system behaves as an\neffective two-mode model in which the atomic and mechanical modes are coupled\nto each other through the mediation of the optical field by an effective\ncoupling parameter. We show that in the effective two-mode model, the LPN\nappears as a classical stochastic pump term which drives the amplitude\nquadratures of the mechanical and the Bogoliubov modes. It is also shown that a\nstrong stationary mirror-atom entanglement can be established just in the\ndispersive and Doppler regimes where the two modes come into resonance with\neach other and the effect of the LPN gets very low.\n", "  Flavor symmetries that explain masses and mixings of the standard model\nfermions dictate flavor patterns for the couplings of scalar and vector\nleptoquarks to the standard model fermions. A generic feature is that couplings\nto $SU(2)$-doublet leptons are suppressed at least by one spurion of the\ndiscrete non-abelian symmetry breaking, responsible for neutrino mixing, while\ncouplings to charged lepton singlets can be order one. We obtain testable\npatterns including those that predominantly couple to a single lepton flavor,\nor two, or in a skewed way. They induce lepton non-universality, which we\ncontrast to current anomalies in $B$-decays. We find maximal effects in $R_{D}$\nand $R_{D^*}$ at the level of $\\sim$10 percent and few percent, respectively,\nwhile leptoquark effects in $R_{K^{(*)}}$ can reach order few$\\times 10$\npercent. Predictions for charm and kaon decays and $\\mu-e$ conversion are\nworked out.\n", "  We present near-infrared and optical emission-line and stellar kinematics of\nthe Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 573 using the Near-Infrared Field Spectrograph (NIFS)\nat Gemini North and Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) at Apache Point\nObservatory, respectively. By obtaining full kinematic maps of the infrared\nionized and molecular gas and stellar kinematics in a 700 x 2100 pc^2\ncircumnuclear region of Mrk 573, we find that kinematics within the Narrow-Line\nRegion (NLR) are largely due to a combination of both rotation and in situ\nacceleration of material originating in the host disk. Combining these\nobservations with large-scale, optical long-slit spectroscopy that traces\nionized gas emission out to several kpcs, we find that rotation kinematics\ndominate the majority of the gas. We find that outflowing gas extends to\ndistances less than 1 kpc, suggesting that outflows in Seyfert galaxies may not\nbe powerful enough to evacuate their entire bulges.\n", "  We present a $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}$ theory of photonic crystals\ncontaining gain and loss in which the gain and loss are added to separate\nprimitive cells of the underlying Hermitian system, thereby creating a\nsupercell photonic crystal. We show that the supercell bands of this system can\nmerge outward from the degenerate contour formed from folding the bands of the\nunderlying Hermitian system into the supercell Brillouin zone, but that other\naccidental degeneracies in the band structure of the underlying Hermitian\nsystem do not yield band merging behavior. Finally, we show that the modal\ncoupling matrix in PhCs with balanced gain and loss is trace-less, and thus the\nimaginary components of the eigenvalues can only move relative to one another\nas the strength of the gain and loss is varied, without any collective motion.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the behavior of the Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ)\ncoefficient $k^{\\mu}$ arising due to integration over massive fermions, and the\nmodification suffered by its topological structure in the finite temperature\ncase. Our study is based on the imaginary time formalism and summation over the\nMatsubara frequencies. We demonstrate that the self-energy of photon is\nnon-analytic for the small $k^{\\mu}$ limit, i.e., the static limit $(k_0=0,\\vec\nk\\rightarrow 0)$ and the long wavelength limit $(k_0\\rightarrow 0,\\vec k= 0)$\ndo not commute, while the tensorial structure of the CFJ term holds in both\nlimits.\n", "  The thermonuclear rate of the 50Fe(p,gamma)51Co reaction in the Type I X-ray\nbursts (XRBs) temperature range has been reevaluated based on a recent precise\nmass measurement at CSRe lanzhou, where the proton separation energy\nSp=142+/-77 keV has been determined firstly for the 51Co nucleus. Comparing to\nthe previous theoretical predictions, the experimental Sp value has much\nsmaller uncertainty. Based on the nuclear shell model and mirror nuclear\nstructure information, we have calculated two sets of thermonuclear rates for\nthe 50Fe(p,gamma)51Co reaction by utilizing the experimental Sp value. It shows\nthat the statistical-model calculations are not ideally applicable for this\nreaction primarily because of the low density of low-lying excited states in\n51Co. In this work, we recommend that a set of new reaction rate based on the\nmirror structure of 51Cr should be incorporated in the future astrophysical\nnetwork calculations.\n", "  The influence of the proton irradiation on the thermally fluctuation-induced\nconductivity in Ca8.5La1.5(pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 single crystal was investigatyed.\nThe in-plane magnetoconductivity was measured up to H=13T. It is observed that\nthe Tc was suppressed up to 30.3 from 32.5 K when the proton is irradiated\nwhereas the amplitude of the fluctuation effect is the almost same in both\nsamples. The results were analyzed by the Ullah and Dorsey scaling functions\nbased on the Hartree approximation to the Ginzburg-Landau free energy,\nincluding the critical-fluctuation regime. In the pristine sample, the 3D-2D\ncrossover in the fluctuation effect was observed near the Tc. When the 3D-2D\noccurs, it is newly found that there is a regime simultaneously described by 2D\nand 3D fluctuation behaviors. Meanwhile, the proton-irradiated sample showed\nthe 3D fluctuation.\n", "  We apply the new constraints from atom-interferometry searches for screening\nmechanisms to the symmetron model, finding that these experiments exclude a\npreviously unexplored region of parameter space. We discuss the possibility of\nnetworks of domain walls forming in the vacuum chamber, and how this could be\nused to discriminate between models of screening.\n", "  In the probe limit, we investigate the nonlinear electrodynamical effects of\nthe both exponential form and the logarithmic form on the holographic\nparamagnetism-ferromagnetism phase transition in the background of a\nSchwarzschild-AdS black hole spacetime. Moreover, by comparing the exponential\nform of nonlinear electrodynamics with the logarithmic form of nonlinear\nelectrodynamics and the Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics which has been\npresented in Ref.~\\cite{Wu:2016uyj}, we find that the higher nonlinear\nelectrodynamics correction makes the critical temperature smaller and the\nmagnetic moment harder form in the case without external field. Furthermore,\nthe increase of nonlinear parameter b will result in extending the period of\nthe external magnetic field. Especially, the effect of the exponential form of\nnonlinear electrodynamics on the periodicity of hysteresis loop is more\nnoticeable.\n", "  Pre-stellar cores within molecular clouds provide the very initial conditions\nin which stars are formed. We use the IRAM 30m telescope and the PdBI to study\nthe chemical and physical properties of the starless core FeSt 1-457 (Core\n109), in the Pipe nebula. We fit the hyperfine structure of the N2H+(1-0) IRAM\n30m data. This allow us to measure with high precision the velocity field, line\nwidths and opacity and derive the excitation temperature and column density in\nthe core. We use a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere model adding a temperature\ngradient towards the center to fit the 1.2 mm continuum emission and visual\nextinction maps. Using this model, we estimate the abundances of the N2H+ and\nthe rest of molecular lines detected in the 30 GHz wide line survey performed\nat 3 mm with IRAM 30m using ARTIST software. The core presents a rich chemistry\nwith emission from early (C3H2, HCN, CS) and late-time molecules (e.g., N2H+),\nwith a clear chemical spatial differentiation for nitrogen, oxygen and\nsulphurated molecules. For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO+, CH3OH,\nCS, SO, 13CO and C18O), abundances are best fitted with three values,\npresenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude\ntowards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is\ngravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid\nthe collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the\ninterior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also\noccurs. This suggests that these properties may be related. On the other hand,\nsome molecules exhibit asymmetries in their integrated emission maps, which\nappear to be correlated with a previously reported submillimetre polarization\nasymmetry. These asymmetries could be due to a stronger interstellar radiation\nfield in the western side of the core.\n", "  We show that the pumping current is a convenient parameter for manipulating\nthe temporal Localized Structures (LSs), also called localized pulses, found in\npassively mode-locked Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers. While short\nelectrical pulses can be used for writing and erasing individual LSs, we\ndemonstrate that a current modulation introduces a temporally evolving\nparameter landscape allowing to control the position and the dynamics of LSs.\nWe show that the localized pulses drifting speed in this landscape depends\nalmost exclusively on the local parameter value instead of depending on the\nlandscape gradient, as shown in quasi-instantaneous media. This experimental\nobservation is theoretically explained by the causal response time of the\nsemiconductor carriers that occurs on an finite timescale and breaks the parity\ninvariance along the cavity, thus leading to a new paradigm for temporal\ntweezing of localized pulses. Different modulation waveforms are applied for\ndescribing exhaustively this paradigm. Starting from a generic model of passive\nmode-locking based upon delay differential equations, we deduce the effective\nequations of motion for these LSs in a time-dependent current landscape.\n", "  Bulk phase separation is responsible for the occurrence of stacks of\ndifferent layers in sedimentation of colloidal mixtures. A recently proposed\ntheory (de las Heras and Schmidt 2013 Soft Matter 9 8636) establishes a unique\nconnection between the bulk phase behaviour and\nsedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium. The theory constructs a stacking diagram\nof all possible sequences of stacks under gravity in the limit of very high\n(infinite) sample heights. Here, we study the stacking diagrams of colloidal\nmixtures at finite sample height, h. We demonstrate that h plays a vital role\nin sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of colloidal mixtures. The region of the\nstacking diagram occupied by a given sequence of stacks depends on h. Hence,\ntwo samples with different heights but identical colloidal concentrations can\ndevelop different stacking sequences. In addition, the stacking diagrams for\ndifferent heights can be qualitatively different since some stacking sequences\noccur only in a given interval of sample heights. We use the theory to\ninvestigate the stacking diagrams of both model bulk systems and mixtures of\npatchy particles that differ either by the number or by the types of patches.\n", "  In this work we discuss the measurement protocols for indirect determination\nof the isothermal entropy change associated with first order phase transitions\nin caloric materials. The magneto- structural phase transitions giving rise to\ngiant magnetocaloric effects in Cu-doped MnAs and FeRh are used as case studies\nto exemplify how badly designed protocols may affect isothermal measure- ments\nand lead to incorrect entropy change estimations. Isothermal measurement\nprotocols which allow correct assessment of the entropy change around first\norder phase transitions in both direct and inverse cases are presented.\n", "  We report on a surface-electrode trap with SmCo magnets arranged in a\nquadrupole configuration underneath the trap electrode. Because the distance\nbetween the magnets and the trapped ions can be as little as several hundred\nmicrometers, a large magnetic field is produced without any heat management.\nThe magnetic-field gradient was measured using the Zeeman splitting of a single\ntrapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion at several positions, and a field gradient of 36 T/m\nwas obtained. Such a field gradient is useful for the generation of a\nstate-dependent force, which is important for quantum simulation and/or quantum\ngate operation using radio-frequency or microwave radiation.\n", "  We report on the charged particle identification (PID) systems for the\nupcoming Belle II experiment. The time of propagation counter in the central\nregion and the proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov counters with aerogel\nradiator in the forward region will be used as the PID devices. They are\nexpected to provide a kaon identification efficiency of more than 94% at a low\npion misidentification probability of 4%. The motivation for the upgrade,\nmethod, and status of both systems are discussed.\n", "  We present theoretical analysis of paired $B_c$ mesons production in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at different energy scales taking into account full\nnext-to-leading order QCD corrections. Both possible electroweak channels are\nconsidered: production via virtual photon and via virtual $Z$-boson. We study\nin detail the role of radiative QCD corrections, which were found to be\nsignificant especially at low energies. It is shown that the contribution from\n$Z$-boson is significant at high energies ($\\sqrt{s} > M_Z/2$) especially in\nthe case of paired production of pseudo-scalar and vector ($B_c + B_c^*$)\nmesons. Azimuthal asymmetry induced by a $P$-violating weak interaction with\n$Z$-boson is also analyzed.\n", "  Majorization provides a rather powerful partial-order classification of\nprobability distributions depending only on the spread of the statistics, and\nnot on the actual numerical values of the variable being described. We propose\nto apply majorization as a meta-measure of quantum polarization fluctuations,\nthis is to say of the degree of polarization. We compare the polarization\nfluctuations of the most relevant classes of quantum and classical-like states.\nIn particular we test Lieb's conjecture regarding classical-like states as the\nmost polarized and a complementary conjecture that the most unpolarized pure\nstates are the most nonclassical.\n", "  In order to search for evidence of hydration on M-type asteroid (16) Psyche,\nwe observed this object in the 3 micron spectral region using the\nlong-wavelength cross-dispersed (LXD: 1.9-4.2 micron) mode of the SpeX\nspectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Our\nobservations show that Psyche exhibits a 3 micron absorption feature,\nattributed to water or hydroxyl. The 3 micron absorption feature is consistent\nwith the hydration features found on the surfaces of water-rich asteroids,\nattributed to OH- and/or H2O-bearing phases (phyllosilicates). The detection of\na 3 micron hydration absorption band on Psyche suggests that this asteroid may\nnot be metallic core, or it could be a metallic core that has been impacted by\ncarbonaceous material over the past 4.5 Gyr. Our results also indicate\nrotational spectral variations, which we suggest reflect heterogeneity in the\nmetal/silicate ratio on the surface of Psyche.\n", "  When applying two counter-propagating laser beams to a cold cloud of Rubidium\natoms, we observe the spontaneous formation of intensity patterns associated\nwith a spatial structuration of the atomic spins. We study the average number\nof defects in these patterns as a function of the sweep time employed to cross\nthe transition threshold. We observe a power-law decrease of the number of\ndefects with increasing sweep time, typical of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The\nmeasured exponent is consistent with the prediction for a supercritical\nbifurcation.\n", "  We consider Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in the regime where the parties\ncan perform collective measurements on many copies of a given shared entangled\nstate. We derive a simple and efficient condition for guaranteeing that an\nentangled state is $k$-copy steerable. In particular we show that any two-qubit\nand qubit-qutrit entangled states is $k$-copy steerable. This allows us to\ndiscuss the effect of super-activation of steering, whereby an entangled state\nthat is unsteerable (i.e., admits a local hidden state model) in the one-copy\nregime becomes $k$-copy steerable. We provide examples with few copies and low\ndimensions. Our results give evidence that entanglement and steering could\nbecome equivalent in the multi-copy regime.\n", "  We demonstrate that criticality in a driven-dissipative system is strongly\ninfluenced by the spectral properties of the reservoir. We study the\nopen-system realization of the Dicke model, where a bosonic cavity mode couples\nto a large spin formed by two motional modes of an atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. The cavity mode is driven by a high frequency laser and it decays\nto a Markovian bath, while the atomic mode interacts with a colored reservoir.\nWe reveal that the soft mode fails to describe the characteristics of the\ncriticality. We calculate the critical exponent of the superradiant phase\ntransition and identify an inherent relation to the low-frequency spectral\ndensity function of the colored bath. We show that a finite temperature of the\ncolored reservoir does not modify qualitatively this dependence on the spectral\ndensity function.\n", "  Artificial spin ice systems have been introduced as a possible mean to\ninvestigate frustration effects in a well-controlled manner by fabricating\nlithographically-patterned two-dimensional arrangements of interacting magnetic\nnanostructures. This approach offers the opportunity to visualize\nunconventional states of matter, directly in real space, and triggered a wealth\nof studies at the frontier between nanomagnetism, statistical thermodynamics\nand condensed matter physics. Despite the strong efforts made these last ten\nyears to provide an artificial realization of the celebrated square ice model,\nno simple geometry based on arrays of nanomagnets succeeded to capture the\nmacroscopically degenerate ground state manifold of the corresponding model.\nInstead, in all works reported so far, square lattices of nanomagnets are\ncharacterized by a magnetically ordered ground state consisting of local\nflux-closure configurations with alternating chirality. Here, we show\nexperimentally and theoretically, that all the characteristics of the square\nice model can be observed if the artificial square lattice is properly\ndesigned. The spin configurations we image after demagnetizing our arrays\nreveal unambiguous signatures of an algebraic spin liquid state characterized\nby the presence of pinch points in the associated magnetic structure factor.\nLocal excitations, i.e. classical analogues of magnetic monopoles, are found to\nbe free to evolve in a massively degenerated, divergence-free vacuum. We thus\nprovide the first lab-on-chip platform allowing the investigation of collective\nphenomena, including Coulomb phases and ice-like physics.\n", "  We renormalize the chiral effective field theory (EFT) potential in\nharmonic-oscillator (HO) model space. The low energy constants (LECs) are\nutilized to absorb not just the ultra-violet part of the physics due to the\ncutoff, but also the infrared part due to the truncation of model space. We use\nthe inverse J-matrix method to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering\nphase shifts in the given model space. We demonstrate that by including the NLO\ncorrection, the nucleon-nucleon scattering in the continuum could be well\nreproduced in the truncated HO trap space up to laboratory energy $T_{lab}=100$\nMeV with number of HO basis $n_{max}$ as small as 10. A perturbative power\ncounting starts at subleading order is adopted in this work, and how to extract\nthe perturbative contribution is demonstrated. Our work serves as the input to\nperform ab-initio calculations.\n", "  Percolation and synchronization are two phase transitions that have been\nextensively studied since already long ago. A classic result is that, in the\nvast majority of cases, these transitions are of the second-order type, i.e.\ncontinuous and reversible. Recently, however, explosive phenomena have been\nreported in com- plex networks' structure and dynamics, which rather remind\nfirst-order (discontinuous and irreversible) transitions. Explosive\npercolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in\nthe network's structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned,\ninstead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks'\ndynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase\noscillators were taken into consideration. The two phenomena have stimulated\ninvestigations and de- bates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So\nfar, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental\nverifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural\nand dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations,\nas well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in\nnetworked systems. Our intention is to offer here a monographic review on the\nmain-stream literature, with the twofold aim of summarizing the existing\nresults and pointing out possible directions for future research.\n", "  We have designed and tested a robust 20 $\\times$ 20 cm$^2$ thin metal film\ninternal anode capacitively coupled to an external array of signal pads or\nmicro-strips for use in fast microchannel plate photodetectors. The internal\nanode, in this case a 10nm-thick NiCr film deposited on a 96% pure Al$_2$O$_3$\n3mm-thick ceramic plate and connected to HV ground, provides the return path\nfor the electron cascade charge. The multi-channel pickup array consists of a\nprinted-circuit card or glass plate with metal signal pickups on one side and\nthe signal ground plane on the other. The pickup can be put in close proximity\nto the bottom outer surface of the sealed photodetector, with no electrical\nconnections through the photodetector hermetic vacuum package other than a\nsingle ground connection to the internal anode. Two pickup patterns were tested\nusing a small commercial MCP-PMT as the signal source: 1) parallel 50$\\Omega$\n25-cm-long micro-strips with an analog bandwidth of 1.5 GHz, and 2) a 20\n$\\times$ 20 cm$^2$ array of 2-dimensional square `pads' with sides of 1.27 cm\nor 2.54 cm. The rise-time of the fast input pulse is maintained for both pickup\npatterns. For the pad pattern, we observe 80% of the directly coupled\namplitude. For the strip pattern we measure 34% of the directly coupled\namplitude on the central strip of a broadened signal. The physical decoupling\nof the photodetector from the pickup pattern allows easy customization for\ndifferent applications while maintaining high analog bandwidth.\n", "  We explore 7.5 billion years of evolution in the star formation activity of\nmassive ($M_{\\star}>10^{10.1}\\,M_{\\odot}$) cluster galaxies using a sample of\n25 clusters over $0.15<z<1$ from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with\nHubble and 11 clusters over $1<z<1.5$ from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey.\nGalaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space\nTelescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code CIGALE,\nwe measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 \\AA\\ break strengths.\nThe latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs).\nFrom $z\\sim1.3$ to $z\\sim0.2$, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of\ncluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four,\nrespectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster\npopulation declines by a factor of 11, from $0.48\\pm0.06\\;\\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$ to\n$0.043\\pm0.009\\;\\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. This strong overall sSFR evolution is\ndriven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of\nquiescent cluster galaxies increases from $28^{+8}_{-19}\\%$ to $88^{+5}_{-4}\\%$\nover $z\\sim1.3\\rightarrow0.2$. The majority of the growth occurs at\n$z\\gtrsim0.9$, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR\nof the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field,\na small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity,\nsuggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of\nquiescent galaxies above $z\\sim0.9$, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of\ncluster SFGs, suggests that higher redshift cluster galaxies are likely being\nquenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar\npopulation ages and star formation histories.\n", "  Gravitational wave astronomy using a pulsar timing array requires\nhigh-quality millisecond pulsars, correctable interstellar propagation delays,\nand high-precision measurements of pulse times of arrival. Here we identify\nnoise in timing residuals that exceeds that predicted for arrival time\nestimation for millisecond pulsars observed by the North American Nanohertz\nObservatory for Gravitational Waves. We characterize the excess noise using\nvariance and structure function analyses. We find that 26 out of 37 pulsars\nshow inconsistencies with a white-noise-only model based on the short timescale\nanalysis of each pulsar and we demonstrate that the excess noise has a red\npower spectrum for 15 pulsars. We also decompose the excess noise into\nchromatic (radio-frequency-dependent) and achromatic components. Associating\nthe achromatic red-noise component with spin noise and including additional\npower-spectrum-based estimates from the literature, we estimate a scaling law\nin terms of spin parameters (frequency and frequency derivative) and data-span\nlength and compare it to the scaling law of Shannon \\& Cordes (2010). We\nbriefly discuss our results in terms of detection of gravitational waves at\nnanohertz frequencies.\n", "  We discuss charm quark/antiquark and charmed meson production in association\nwith one extra jet (gluon, quark, antiquark) at the LHC. The calculations are\nperformed both in collinear and $k_T$-factorization approaches. Different\nunintegrated gluon distribution functions are used in the $k_T$-factorization\napproach. Several predictions for the LHC are presented. We show distributions\nin rapidity and transverse momenta of $c$/$\\bar c$ (or charmed mesons) and the\nassociated jet as well as some two-dimensional observables. Interesting\ncorrelation effects are predicted, \\textit{e.g.} in azimuthal angles\n$\\varphi_{c\\bar{c}}$ and $\\varphi_{c\\mathrm{\\textit{-jet}}}$. We have also\ndiscussed a relation of the $2 \\to 2$ and $2 \\to 3$ partonic calculations in\nthe region of large transverse momenta of charm quarks/antiquarks as well as\nthe similarity of the next-to-leading order collinear approach and the\n$k_T$-factorization approach with the KMR unintegrated parton distribution\nfunctions. Integrated cross sections for $D^{0}$ + jet production for ATLAS\ndetector acceptance and for different cuts on jet transverse momenta are also\npresented.\n", "  We present a consistent optimal estimation retrieval analysis of ten hot\nJupiter exoplanets, each with transmission spectral data spanning the visible\nto near-infrared wavelength range. Using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and\nretrieval tool, we calculate a range of possible atmospheric states for\nWASP-6b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, WASP-31b, WASP-39b, HD 189733b, HD\n209458b, HAT-P-1b and HAT-P-12b. We find that the spectra of all ten planets\nare consistent with the presence of some atmospheric aerosol; WASP-6b,\nWASP-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, HD 189733b and HAT-P-12b are all fit best by\nRayleigh scattering aerosols, whereas WASP-31b, WASP-39b and HD 209458b are\nbetter represented by a grey cloud model. HAT-P-1b has solutions that fall into\nboth categories. WASP-6b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b and WASP-12b must have aerosol\nextending to low atmospheric pressures (below 0.1 mbar). In general, planets\nwith equilibrium temperatures between 1300 and 1700 K are best represented by\ndeeper, grey cloud layers, whereas cooler or hotter planets are better fit\nusing high Rayleigh scattering aerosol. We find little evidence for the\npresence of molecular absorbers other than H$_2$O. Retrieval methods can\nprovide a consistent picture across a range of hot Jupiter atmospheres with\nexisting data, and will be a powerful tool for the interpretation of James Webb\nSpace Telescope observations.\n", "  Simon's problem is one of the most important problems demonstrating the power\nof quantum computers, which achieves a large separation between quantum and\nclassical query complexities. However, Simon's discussion on his problem was\nlimited to bounded-error setting, which means his algorithm can not always get\nthe correct answer. Exact quantum algorithms for Simon's problem have also been\nproposed, which deterministically solve the problem with O(n) queries. Also the\nquantum lower bound \\Omega(n) for Simon's problem is known. Although these\nalgorithms are either complicated or specialized, their results give an O(n)\nversus \\Omega(\\sqrt{2^{n}}) separation in exact query complexities for Simon's\nproblem (\\Omega(\\sqrt{2^{n}}) is the lower bound for classical probabilistic\nalgorithms), but it has not been proved whether this separation is optimal. In\nthis paper, we propose another exact quantum algorithm for solving Simon's\nproblem with O(n) queries, which is simple, concrete and does not rely on\nspecial query oracles. Our algorithm combines Simon's algorithm with the\nquantum amplitude amplification technique to ensure its determinism. In\nparticular, we show that Simon's problem can be solved by a classical\ndeterministic algorithm with O(\\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries (as we are aware, there\nwere no classical deterministic algorithms for solving Simon's problem with\nO(\\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries). Combining some previous results, we obtain the\noptimal separation in exact query complexities for Simon's problem: \\Theta({n})\nversus \\Theta({\\sqrt{2^{n}}}).\n", "  Among crystal structures of N-component metal alloys, far fewer examples are\nknown with N>=4 than with N=2 or 3, in apparent contradiction to the\nexponentially growing number of possible combinations of elements. Two effects\ncontribute to this shortfall. Since the N-component composition space resides\nwithin a d-dimensional simplex with d=N-1, the vanishing volume in high\ndimensions reduces the distinct N-component compositions. Additionally, the\nincreasing surface area makes it more probable that stable structures reside on\nthe surface of the simplex (containing fewer than N components) as opposed to\nits interior. Despite their rarity, we propose that the actual number of N=4-\nand 5-component alloys greatly exceeds the number that are currently known.\nSpecific estimates are developed through application of the empirical Miedema\nenthalpy model.\n", "  By means of Quantum Monte Carlo methods we calculate the binding energy of an\nimpurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate at T = 0. The focus is on the\nattractive branch of the Bose polaron and on the role played by the mass\nimbalance between the impurity and the surrounding particles. For an impurity\nresonantly coupled to the bath, we investigate the dependence of the binding\nenergy on the mass ratio and on the interaction strength within the medium. In\nparticular, we determine the equation of state in the case of a static\n(infinite mass) impurity, where three-body correlations are irrelevant and the\nresult is expected to be a universal function of the gas parameter. For the\nmass ratio corresponding to $^{40}$K impurities in a gas of $^{87}$Rb atoms we\nprovide an explicit comparison with the experimental findings of a recent study\ncarried out at JILA.\n", "  The organization of dopants in high temperature superconductors provides\ncomplex topological geometries that controls superconducting properties. This\nmakes the study of dopants spatial distribution of fundamental importance. The\nmobile oxygen ions, y, in the CuO2 plane of YBa2Cu3O6+y (0.33<y<0.67) form\nordered chains which greatly affect the transport properties of the material.\nHere we visualize and characterize the 2D spatial organization of these oxygen\nchains using scanning micro X-ray diffraction measurements in transmission mode\non a thin single crystal slab with y=0.33 (Tc=7 K) near the critical doping for\nthe insulator-to-metal transition. We show the typical landscape of percolation\nmade of a granular spatial pattern due the oxygen chains segregating in\nquasi-one-dimensional needles of Ortho II (O-II) phase embedded in an\ninsulating matrix with low density of disordered oxygen interstitials\n", "  We report simultaneous quasi-dc magnetotransport and high frequency surface\nacoustic wave measurements on bilayer two-dimensional electron systems in GaAs.\nNear strong integer quantized Hall states a strong magnetic field sweep\nhysteresis in the velocity of the acoustic waves is observed at low\ntemperatures. This hysteresis indicates the presence of a metastable state with\nanomalously high conductivity in the interior of the sample. This\nnon-equilibrium state is not revealed by conventional low frequency transport\nmeasurements which are dominated by dissipationless transport at the edge of\nthe 2D system. We find that a field-cooling technique allows the equilibrium\ncharge configuration within the interior of the sample to be established. A\nsimple model for this behavior is discussed.\n", "  Using color-kinematics duality, we construct for the first time the full\nintegrand of the five-loop Sudakov form factor in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory,\nincluding non-planar contributions. This result also provides a first\nmanifestation of the color-kinematics duality at five loops. The integrand is\nexplicitly ultraviolet finite when D<26/5, coincident with the known finiteness\nbound for amplitudes. If the double-copy method could be applied to the form\nfactor, this would indicate an interesting ultraviolet finiteness bound for N=8\nsupergravity at five loops. The result is also expected to provide an essential\ninput for computing the five-loop non-planar cusp anomalous dimension.\n", "  Detailed studies of the resolution of a EUDET-type beam telescope are carried\nout using the DATURA beam telescope as an example. The EUDET-type beam\ntelescopes make use of CMOS MIMOSA 26 pixel detectors for particle tracking\nallowing for precise characterisation of particle sensing devices. A profound\nunderstanding of the performance of the beam telescope as a whole is obtained\nby a detailed characterisation of the sensors themselves. The differential\nintrinsic resolution as measured in a MIMOSA 26 sensor is extracted using an\niterative pull method and various quantities that depend on the size of the\ncluster are discussed: the residual distribution, the intra-pixel\nresidual-width distribution and the intra-pixel density distribution of track\nincident positions.\n", "  We study numerically the transport and localization properties of waves in\nordered and disordered ladder-shaped lattices with local $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetry. Using a transfer matrix method, we calculate the transmittance and\nthe reflectance for the individual channels and the Lyapunov exponent for the\nwhole system. In the absence of disorder, we find that when the gain/loss\nparameter $\\rho$ is smaller than the interchain coupling parameter $t_{v}$, the\ntransmittance and the reflectance are periodic functions of the system size,\nwhereas when $\\rho$ is larger than $t_{v}$, the transmittance is found to be an\nexponentially-decaying function while the reflectance attains a saturation\nvalue in the thermodynamic limit. For a fixed system size, there appear perfect\ntransmission resonances in each individual channel at several values of the\ngain/loss strength smaller than $t_{v}$. A singular behavior of the\ntransmittance is also found to appear at various values of $\\rho$ for a given\nsystem size. When disorder is inserted into the on-site potentials, these\nbehaviors are changed substantially due to the interplay between disorder and\nthe gain/loss effect. When $\\rho$ is smaller than $t_{v}$, we find that the\npresence of locally $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potentials suppresses Anderson\nlocalization, as compared to the localization in the corresponding Hermitian\nsystem. When $\\rho$ is larger than $t_{v}$, we find that localization becomes\nmore pronounced at higher gain/loss strengths. We also find that the phenomenon\nof anomalous localization occurs in disordered locally $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\nsystems precisely at the spectral positions $E=0$ and\n$E=\\pm\\sqrt{t_{v}^2-\\rho^2}$. The anomaly at the band center manifests as a\nsharp peak contrary to the conventional cases, whereas the anomalies at\n$E=\\pm\\sqrt{t_{v}^2-\\rho^2}$ manifest as sharp dips.\n", "  The phenomenon of CP violation in the standard model (SM) framework and the\ndecay dynamics have been established from the data obtained from the B\nfactories and so far we have not seen anything new. Nevertheless, there have\nbeen instances of deviations in many measured observables in the flavor sector,\nas far as the data and predictions are concerned. Here we will mention some\ndeviations obtained in measurements related to lepton universality, as seen\nfrom the data, and try to understand their implications. To accommodate the\nobserved data we will consider a leptoquark model, which seems to be one\ninteresting model beyond the SM.\n", "  The structures of epitaxial ultrathin Co2FeAl/MgO(001) heterostructures\nrelating to the interface-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) were\ninvestigated using scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive\nx-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. We found that Al\natoms from the Co2FeAl layer significantly interdiffuse into MgO, forming an\nAl-deficient Co-Fe-Al/Mg-Al-O structure near the Co2FeAl/MgO interface. This\natomic replacement may play an additional role for enhancing PMA, which is\nconsistent with the observed large perpendicular orbital magnetic moments of Fe\natoms at the interface. This work suggests that control of interdiffusion at\nferromanget/barrier interfaces is critical for designing an interface-induced\nPMA system.\n", "  We use numerical simulations to analyze the evolution and properties of\nsuperbubbles (SBs), driven by multiple supernovae (SNe), that propagate into\nthe two-phase (warm/cold), cloudy interstellar medium (ISM). We consider a\nrange of mean background densities n_avg=0.1-10 cm^{-3} and intervals between\nSNe dt_sn=0.01-1 Myr, and follow each SB until the radius reaches (1-2)H, where\nH is the characteristic ISM disk thickness. Except for embedded dense clouds,\neach SB is hot until a time t_sf,m when the shocked warm gas at the outer front\ncools and forms an overdense shell. Subsequently, diffuse gas in the SB\ninterior remains at T_h 10^6-10^7K with expansion velocity v_h~10^2-10^3km/s\n(both highest for low dt_sn). At late times, the warm shell gas velocities are\nseveral 10's to ~100km/s. While shell velocities are too low to escape from a\nmassive galaxy, they are high enough to remove substantial mass from dwarfs.\nDense clouds are also accelerated, reaching a few to 10's of km/s. We measure\nthe mass in hot gas per SN, M_h/N_SN, and the total radial momentum of the\nbubble per SN, p_b/N_SN. After t_sf,m, M_h/N_SN 10-100M_sun (highest for low\nn_avg), while p_b/N_SN 0.7-3x10^5M_sun km/s (highest for high dt_sn). If\ngalactic winds in massive galaxies are loaded by the hot gas in SBs, we\nconclude that the mass-loss rates would generally be lower than star formation\nrates. Only if the SN cadence is much higher than typical in galactic disks, as\nmay occur for nuclear starbursts, SBs can break out while hot and expel up to\n10 times the mass locked up in stars. The momentum injection values, p_b/N_SN,\nare consistent with requirements to control star formation rates in galaxies at\nobserved levels.\n", "  The dispersive magnetic excitations in Sr2IrO4 have previously been well\ndescribed within an isospin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice that\nrevealed parallels with La2CuO4. Here we investigate the inelastic spectra of\nSr2Ir0.8Ru0.2O4 with resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ir\nL3-edge. The results are well described using linear spin-wave theory within a\nsimilar Heisenberg model applicable to Sr2IrO4, however the disorder induced by\nthe substitution of 20% Ir4+ ions for Ru4+ removes longer range exchange\ninteractions. A large spin-gap (40 meV) is measured indicating strong\nanisotropy from spin-orbit coupling that is manifest due to the altered\nmagnetic structure in Sr2Ir0.8Ru0.2O4 with c-axis aligned moments compared to\nthe basal plane moments in the parent. Collectively the results indicate the\nrobustness of a Heisenberg model description even when the magnetic structure\nis altered and the J=1/2 moments diluted.\n", "  We consider the tree-level scattering amplitudes in the NS-NS (Neveu-Schwarz)\nmassless sector of closed superstrings in the case where one external state\nbecomes soft. We compute the amplitudes generically for any number of\ndimensions and any number and kind of the massless closed states through the\nsubsubleading order in the soft expansion. We show that, when the soft state is\na graviton or a dilaton, the full result can be expressed as a soft theorem\nfactorizing the amplitude in a soft and a hard part. This behavior is similar\nto what has previously been observed in field theory and in the bosonic string.\nDifferently from the bosonic string, the supersymmetric soft theorem for the\ngraviton has no string corrections at subsubleading order. The dilaton soft\ntheorem, on the other hand, is found to be universally free of string\ncorrections in any string theory.\n", "  We investigate whether the six-loop beta function of the $\\lambda \\phi^4_4$\ntheory exhibits evidence for an ultraviolet zero. As part of our analysis, we\ncalculate and analyze Pad\\'e approximants to this beta function. Extending our\nearlier results at the five-loop level, we find that in the range of $\\lambda$\nwhere the perturbative calculation of the six-loop beta function is reliable,\nthe theory does not exhibit robust evidence for an ultraviolet zero.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission to study the three dimensional (3D)\nelectronic structure of Co pnictides ACo2As2 with A=Ba, Sr, Ca or a mixture of\nSr and Ca. These compounds are isostructural to Fe based superconductors, but\nhave one more electron in the Co $3d$ orbitals. Going from Ba to Ca, they\nbecome more and more 3D, eventually forming a 'collapsed' tetragonal phase,\nwhere the distance between CoAs layers is markedly reduced. The observed\nperiodicity of the 3D electronic structure matches in each case that expected\nfrom the distance between the planes in the bulk. However, the electronic\nstructure is better fitted by a calculation corresponding to a slab with 2 CoAs\nlayers than to the bulk structure. We attribute this to subtle modifications of\nthe 2D electronic structure induced by the truncation of the 3D dispersion at\nthe surface in the ARPES measurement. We further study how this affects the\nelectronic properties. We show that, despite this distortion, the electronic\nstructure of CaCo2As2 is essentially that expected for a collapsed phase.\nElectronic correlations produce a renormalization of the electronic structure\nby a factor 1.4, which is not affected by the transition to the collapsed\nstate. On the other hand, a small shift of the Fermi level reduces the density\nof states in the eg bands and suppresses the magnetic transition expected in\nCaCo2As2. Our study evidences that observing the bulk periodicity is not\nsufficient to ensure bulk sensitivity. It further gives direct information on\nthe role of 3D interactions, mostly governed by Co-As hybridization, among eg\nand t2g orbitals. It is also useful to better understand the electronic\nstructure of Fe superconductors and the range of validity of ARPES\nmeasurements.\n", "  Spacetime is foliated by spatial hypersurfaces in the 3+1 split of General\nRelativity. The initial value problem then consists of specifying initial data\nfor all relevant fields on one such a spatial hypersurface. These fields are\nthe 3-metric and extrinsic curvature together with matter fields such as fluid\nvelocity, energy density and rest mass density. There is a lot of freedom in\nchoosing such initial data. This freedom corresponds to the physical state of\nthe system at the initial time. At the same time the initial data have to\nsatisfy the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations of General Relativity\nand can thus not be chosen completely freely. We discuss the conformal\ntransverse traceless and conformal thin sandwich decompositions that are\ncommonly used in the construction of constraint satisfying initial data. These\ndecompositions allow us to specify certain free data that describe the physical\nnature of the system. The remaining metric fields are then determined by\nsolving elliptic equations derived from the constraint equations. We describe\ninitial data for single black holes and single neutron stars, and how we can\nuse conformal decompositions to construct initial data for binaries made up of\nblack holes or neutron stars. Orbiting binaries will emit gravitational\nradiation and thus lose energy. Since the emitted radiation tends to\ncircularize the orbits over time, one can thus expect that the objects in a\ntypical binary move on almost circular orbits with slowly shrinking radii. This\nleads us to the concept of quasi-equilibrium which essentially assumes that\ntime derivatives are negligible in corotating coordinates, for binaries on\nalmost circular orbits. We review how quasi-equilibrium assumptions can be used\nto make physically well motivated approximations that simplify the elliptic\nequations we have to solve.\n", "  A dual-channel AlN/GaN/AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)\narchitecture is proposed, simulated, and demonstrated that suppresses gate lag\ndue to surface-originated trapped charge. Dual two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) channels are utilized such that the top 2DEG serves as an equipotential\nthat screens potential fluctuations resulting from surface trapped charge. The\nbottom channel serves as the transistor's modulated channel. Two device\nmodeling approaches have been performed as a means to guide the device design\nand to elucidate the relationship between the design and performance metrics.\nThe modeling efforts include a self-consistent Poisson-Schrodinger solution for\nelectrostatic simulation as well as hydrodynamic three-dimensional device\nmodeling for three-dimensional electrostatics, steady-state, and transient\nsimulations. Experimental results validated the HEMT design whereby\nhomo-epitaxial growth on free-standing GaN substrates and fabrication of\nsame-wafer dual-channel and recessed-gate AlN/GaN HEMTs have been demonstrated.\nNotable pulsed-gate performance has been achieved by the fabricated HEMTs\nthrough a gate lag ratio of 0.86 with minimal drain current collapse while\nmaintaining high levels of dc and rf performance.\n", "  Oscillatory double-diffusive convection (ODDC, more traditionally called\nsemiconvection) is a form of linear double-diffusive instability that occurs in\nfluids that are unstably stratified in temperature (Schwarzschild unstable),\nbut stably stratified in chemical composition (Ledoux stable). This scenario is\nthought to be quite common in the interiors of stars and giant planets, and\nunderstanding the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC is of great\nimportance to stellar and planetary evolution models. Fluids unstable to ODDC\nhave a tendency to form convective thermo-compositional layers which\nsignificantly enhance the fluxes of temperature and chemical composition\ncompared with microscopic diffusion. Although a number of recent studies have\nfocused on studying properties of both layered and non-layered ODDC, few have\naddressed how additional physical processes such as global rotation affect its\ndynamics. In this work we study first how rotation affects the linear stability\nproperties of rotating ODDC. Using direct numerical simulations we then analyze\nthe effect of rotation on properties of layered and non-layered ODDC, and study\nhow the angle of the rotation axis with respect to the direction of gravity\naffects layering. We find that rotating systems can be broadly grouped into two\ncategories, based on the strength of rotation. Qualitative behavior in the more\nweakly rotating group is similar to non-rotating ODDC, but strongly rotating\nsystems become dominated by vortices that are invariant in the direction of the\nrotation vector and strongly influence transport. We find that whenever layers\nform, rotation always acts to reduce thermal and compositional transport.\n", "  We consider a long-range model of coupled phase-only oscillators subject to a\nlocal potential and evolving in presence of thermal noise. The model is a\nnon-trivial generalization of the celebrated Kuramoto model of collective\nsynchronization. We demonstrate by exact results and numerics a surprisingly\nrich long-time behavior, in which the system settles into either a stationary\nstate that could be in or out of equilibrium and supports either global\nsynchrony or absence of it, or, in a time-periodic synchronized state. The\nsystem shows both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, as well as an\ninteresting reentrant transition in which the system successively loses and\ngains synchrony on steady increase of the relevant tuning parameter.\n", "  Cosmological alpha-attractor models in \\cN=1 supergravity are based on\nhyperbolic geometry of a Poincar\\'e disk with the radius square {\\cal\nR}^2=3\\alpha. The predictions for the B-modes, r\\approx 3\\alpha {4\\over N^2},\ndepend on moduli space geometry and are robust for a rather general class of\npotentials. Here we notice that starting with M-theory compactified on a\n7-manifold with G_2 holonomy, with a special choice of Betti numbers, one can\nobtain d=4 \\cN=1 supergravity with rank 7 scalar coset \\Big[{SL(2)\\over\nSO(2)}\\Big]^7. In a model where these 7 unit size Poincar\\'e disks have\nidentified moduli one finds that 3 alpha =7. Assuming that the moduli space\ngeometry of the phenomenological models is inherited from this version of\nM-theory, one would predict r \\approx 10^{-2} for 53 e-foldings. We also\ndescribe the related maximal supergravity and M/string theory models leading to\npreferred values 3 alpha =1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n", "  We show that all tree-level amplitudes in $\\varphi^p$ scalar field theory can\nbe represented as the $\\alpha'\\to0$ limit of an $SL(2,R)$-invariant,\nstring-theory-like dual model integral. These dual models are constructed\naccording to constraints that admit families of solutions. We derive these dual\nmodels, and give closed formulae for all tree-level amplitudes of any\n$\\varphi^p$ scalar field theory.\n", "  Motivated by the fact that the (inverse) temperature might be a function of\nthe energy levels in the Planck distribution\n$n_\\epsilon=\\frac1{\\zeta^{-1}e^{\\beta(\\epsilon)\\epsilon}-1}$ for the occupation\nnumber $n_\\epsilon$ of the level $\\epsilon$, we show that it can be naturally\nachieved by imposing the constraint concerning the conservation of a weighted\nsum $\\sum_{\\epsilon}f(\\epsilon)\\epsilon n_\\epsilon$, with a fixed positive\nweight function $f$, of the contributions of the single energy levels\noccupation in the Microcanonical Ensemble scheme, obtaining\n$\\beta(\\epsilon)\\propto f(\\epsilon)$. This immediately addresses the\npossibility that also a weighted sum $\\sum_{\\epsilon}g(\\epsilon)n_\\epsilon$ of\nthe particles occupation number is conserved, having as a consequence that the\nchemical potential might be a function of the energy levels of the system as\nwell. This scheme leads to a thermodynamics of open systems in the following\nway: the equilibrium is reached when the entropy function is maximised under\nthe constraints that some weighed sums of occupation of the energy levels and\nthe occupation numbers are conserved.\n  The standard case of isolated systems corresponds to the weight functions\nbeing trivial (i.e. $f, g$ are identically 1). For such open systems, new and\nunexpected phenomena which might happen in nature can appear, like the Bose\nEinstein Condensation in excited levels. The ideas outlined in the present\npaper may provide a new approach for the treatment of the irreversible\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Turbulent magnetic diffusivity plays an important role for accretion disks\nand the launching of disk winds. We have implemented magnetic diffusivity,\nrespective resistivity in the general relativistic MHD code HARM. This paper\ndescribes the theoretical background of our implementation, its numerical\nrealization, our numerical tests and preliminary applications. The test\nsimulations of the new code rHARM are compared with an analytic solution of the\ndiffusion equation and a classical shock tube problem. We have further\ninvestigated the evolution of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in tori\naround black holes for a range of magnetic diffusivities. We find indication\nfor a critical magnetic diffusivity (for our setup) beyond which no MRI\ndevelops in the linear regime and for which accretion of torus material to the\nblack hole is delayed. Preliminary simulations of magnetically diffusive thin\naccretion disks around Schwarzschild black holes that are threaded by a\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field show the launching of disk winds with mass\nfluxes of about 50% of the accretion rate. The disk magnetic diffusivity allows\nfor efficient disk accretion that replenishes the mass reservoir of the inner\ndisk area and thus allows for long-term simulations of wind launching for more\nthan 5000 time units.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of\nvoltage-controlled standing spin waves resonance (SSWR) in PMN-PT/NiFe\nmultiferroic heterostructures patterned into microstrips. A spin-diode\ntechnique was used to observe ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) mode and SSWR in\nNiFe strip mechanically coupled with a piezoelectric substrate. Application of\nan electric field to a PMNPT creates a strain in permalloy and thus shifts the\nFMR and SSWR fields due to the magnetostriction effect. The experimental\nresults are compared with micromagnetic simulations and a good agreement\nbetween them is found for dynamics of FMR and SSWR with and without electric\nfield. Moreover, micromagnetic simulations enable us to discuss the amplitude\nand phase spatial distributions of FMR and SSWR modes, which are not directly\nobservable by means of spin diode detection technique.\n", "  The 2-years MESE IceCube events show a slightly excess in the energy range\n10-100 TeV with a maximum local statistical significance of 2.3$\\sigma$, once a\nhard astrophysical power-law is assumed. A spectral index smaller than 2.2 is\nindeed suggested by multi-messenger studies related to $p$-$p$ sources and by\nthe recent IceCube analysis regarding 6-years up-going muon neutrinos. In the\npresent paper, we propose a two-components scenario where the extraterrestrial\nneutrinos are explained in terms of an astrophysical power-law and a Dark\nMatter signal. We consider both decaying and annihilating Dark Matter\ncandidates with different final states (quarks and leptons) and different halo\ndensity profiles. We perform a likelihood-ratio analysis that provides a\nstatistical significance up to 3.9$\\sigma$ for a Dark Matter interpretation of\nthe IceCube low energy excess.\n", "  The fast neutron rate is measured at the site of NEOS experiment, a short\nbaseline neutrino experiment located in a tendon gallery of a commercial\nnuclear power plant, using a 0.78-liter liquid scintillator detector. A pulse\nshape discrimination technique is used to identify neutron signals. The\nmeasurements are performed during the nuclear reactor-on and off periods and\nfound to be ~20 per day for both periods. The fast neutron rate is also\nmeasured at an overground site with a negligible overburden and is found to be\n~100 times higher than that at the NEOS experiment site.\n", "  As a long GRB jet propagates within the surrounding stellar atmosphere it\ncreates a cocoon composed of an outer Newtonian shocked stellar material and an\ninner (possibly relativistic) shocked jet material. The jet deposits\n$10^{51}-10^{52}$ erg into this cocoon. This energy is comparable to the GRB's\nenergy and to the energy of the accompanying supernova, yet its signature has\nbeen largely neglected so far. A fraction of the cocoon energy is released\nduring its expansion following the breakout from the star and later as it\ninteracts with the surrounding matter. We explore here the possible signatures\nof the cocoon emission and outline a framework to calculate them from the\nconditions of the cocoon at the time of the jet breakout. We show that the\ncocoon signature depends strongly on the level of mixing between the shocked\njet and shocked stellar material that fills it, which is currently unknown. We\nfind that if there is no mixing at all then the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the\ncocoon is so bright that it should have been already detected, and the lack of\nsuch detections indicates that mixing at some level must take place. We\ncalculate also the expected signal for partial and full mixing. While the\ntypical signals are weaker than GRBs' afterglows, the latter are highly beamed\nwhile the former have wide angles. We predict that future optical, UV and X-ray\ntransient searches, like LSST, ZTF, ULTRASAT, ISS-Lobster and others will most\nlikely detect such signals, providing a wealth of information on the\nprogenitors and jets of GRBs. While we focus on long GRBs, we note that\nanalogous (but weaker) cocoons may arise in short GRBs as well. Their\nsignatures might be the most promising electromagnetic counterparts for\ngravitational waves merger's signals.\n", "  Our first-principles calculations show that an energy gap around 0.12-0.25 eV\ncan be engineered in epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) through the non-covalent\nintercalation of transition- or alkali-metals, yet originated from the distinct\nmechanisms. The former is attributed to the combined effects of metal induced\nperpendicular electric field and interaction while the latter is solely\nattributed to the built-in electric field. A great advantage of this scheme is\nthat the gap size is almost independent of the gate voltage up to 1 V/nm, thus\nreserving the electric means to tune the Fermi level of graphene when\nconfigured as field-effect transistors. Given the recent progress in\nexperimental techniques on the intercalated graphene, our findings provide a\npractical way to incorporate the graphene with the current semiconductor\nindustry.\n", "  We propose new methods to numerically approximate non-attracting sets\ngoverning transiently-chaotic systems. Trajectories starting in a vicinity\n$\\Omega$ of these sets escape $\\Omega$ in a finite time $\\tau$ and the problem\nis to find initial conditions ${\\bf x} \\in \\Omega$ with increasingly large\n$\\tau= \\tau({\\bf x})$. We search points ${\\bf x}'$ with $\\tau({\\bf\nx}')>\\tau({\\bf x})$ in a {\\it search domain} in $\\Omega$. Our first method\nconsiders a search domain with size that decreases exponentially in $\\tau$,\nwith an exponent proportional to the largest Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_1$. Our\nsecond method considers anisotropic search domains in the {\\it tangent}\nunstable manifold, where each direction scale as the inverse of the\ncorresponding {\\it expanding} singular value of the Jacobian matrix of the\niterated map. We show that both methods outperform the state-of-the-art {\\it\nStagger-and-Step} method (Sweet, Nusse, and York, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 86},\n2261, 2001) but that only the anisotropic method achieves an efficiency\nindependent of $\\tau$ for the case of high-dimensional systems with multiple\npositive Lyapunov exponents. We perform simulations in a chain of coupled\nH\\'enon maps in up to 24 dimensions ($12$ positive Lyapunov exponents). This\nsuggests the possibility of characterizing also non-attracting sets in\nspatio-temporal systems.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering allows Alice to remotely prepare a\nstate in some specific bases for Bob through her choice of measurements. The\ntemporal analogue of EPR steering, temporal steering, also reveals the\nsteerability of a single system between different times. Focusing on a\nfour-dimensional system, here we investigate the dynamics of the temporal\nsteering measures, the temporal steering robustness, using 5 mutually unbiased\nbases. As an example of an application, we use these measures to examine the\ntemporal correlations in a radical pair model of magnetoreception. We find\nthat, due to interactions with a static nuclear spin, the radical pair model\nexhibits strong non-Markovianity.\n", "  A detection of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) gravitational-wave (GW)\nsignal with an Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector network may allow us to measure\nastrophysical parameters of the dying massive star. GWs are emitted from deep\ninside the core and, as such, they are direct probes of the CCSN explosion\nmechanism. In this study we show how we can determine the CCSN explosion\nmechanism from a GW supernova detection using a combination of principal\ncomponent analysis and Bayesian model selection. We use simulations of GW\nsignals from CCSN exploding via neutrino-driven convection and rapidly-rotating\ncore collapse. Previous studies have shown that the explosion mechanism can be\ndetermined using one LIGO detector and simulated Gaussian noise. As real GW\ndetector noise is both non-stationary and non-Gaussian we use real detector\nnoise from a network of detectors with a sensitivity altered to match the\nadvanced detectors design sensitivity. For the first time we carry out a\ncareful selection of the number of principal components to enhance our model\nselection capabilities. We show that with an advanced detector network we can\ndetermine if the CCSN explosion mechanism is neutrino-driven convection for\nsources in our Galaxy and rapidly-rotating core collapse for sources out to the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud.\n", "  We study asymptotically Lifshitz solutions with critical exponent $z \\neq 1$\nin Horava gravity in three and four spacetime dimensions. For $z=2$ and\n$z=3/2$, we find a novel class of numerical solutions with regular universal\nhorizon, but are characterized by non-analytic behavior near infinity. In the\ninterior, inside the universal horizon, the unit timelike vector field\nassociated with the preferred time foliation exhibits oscillatory behavior,\nqualitatively similar to that found earlier in asymptotically flat solutions.\nFor $z>2$ no solutions of this type appear to exist. We comment on potential\napplications to holographic Lifshitz dualities.\n", "  In this paper we investigate how the dynamics of a two-level atom is affected\nby its interaction with the quantized near field of a plasmonic slab in\nrelative motion. We demonstrate that for small separation distances and a\nrelative velocity greater than a certain threshold, this interaction can lead\nto a population inversion, such that the probability of the excited state\nexceeds the probability of the ground state, corresponding to a negative\nspontaneous emission rate. It is shown that the developed theory is intimately\nrelated to a classical problem. The problem of quantum friction is analyzed and\nthe differences with respect to the corresponding classical effect are\nhighlighted.\n", "  In two- and three-dimensional structures, topologically-protected chiral edge\nmodes offer a powerful mean to realize robust light transport. However, little\nattention has been paid so far to robust one-way transport in one-dimensional\nsystems. Here it is shown that unidirectional transport, which is immune to\ndisorder and backscattering, can occur in certain one-dimensional metacrystals\nwith long-range hopping without resorting to topological protection. Such\nmetacrystals are described by an effective Hermitian Hamiltonian with broken\ntime reversal symmetry, and transport does not require adiabatic (Thouless)\npumping. A simple implementation in optics of such one-dimensional\nmetacrystals, based on transverse light dynamics in a self-imaging optical\ncavity with phase gratings, is suggested\n", "  It is a well-known fact that a cluster of nucleons can be formed in the\ninterior of an atomic nucleus, and such clusters may occupy molecular-like\norbitals, showing characteristics similar to normal molecules consisting of\natoms. Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in\nnature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear\nclusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied\nsince the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence\ndemonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an\nexcess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing\ninterest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence\nin neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation\nof {\\alpha}-cluster states in the radioactive 14C nucleus. Using the\n10Be+{\\alpha} resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a\nseries of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels\nhaving an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the\nfirst strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus.\n", "  We set up a mesoscopic theory for interacting Brownian particles embedded in\na nonequilibrium environment, starting from the microscopic interacting\nmany-body theory. Using nonequilibrium linear response theory, we characterize\nthe effective dynamical interactions on the mesoscopic scale and the statistics\nof the nonequilibrium environmental noise, arising upon integrating out the\nfast degrees of freedom. As hallmarks of nonequilibrium, the breakdown of the\nfluctuation-dissipation and action-reaction relations for Brownian degrees of\nfreedom are exemplified with two prototypical models for the environment,\nnamely, active Brownian particles and stirred colloids.\n", "  In this work, we develop a model for Higgs-like composites based on two\ngenerations of right handed neutrinos which condense. We analyze the\nSpontaneous Symmetry Breaking of the theory with two explicit breakings,\nsetting the different scales of the model and obtaining massive bosons as a\nresult. Finally, we calculate the gravitational wave imprint left by the phase\ntransition associated to the symmetry breaking of a generic potential dictated\nby the symmetries of the composites.\n", "  We report here the magneto-transport properties of the newly synthesized\nHeusler compound Cr2NiGa which crystallizes in a disordered cubic B2 structure\nbelonging to Pm-3m space group. The sample is found to be paramagnetic down to\n2 K with metallic character. On application of magnetic field, a significantly\nlarge increase in resistivity is observed which corresponds to\nmagnetoresistance as high as 112% at 150 kOe of field at the lowest\ntemperature. Most remarkably, the sample shows negative temperature coefficient\nof resistivity below about 50 K under the application of field gretare than or\nequal to 80 kOe, signifying a field-induced metal to `insulating' transition.\nThe observed magnetoresistance follows Kohler's rule below 20 K indicating the\nvalidity of the semiclassical model of electronic transport in metal with a\nsingle relaxation time. A multi-band model for electronic transport, originally\nproposed for semimetals, is found to be appropriate to describe the\nmagneto-transport behavior of the sample.\n", "  As part of the Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP), we present VLBI maps of\nnuclear water masers toward five galaxies. The masers originate in sub-parsec\ncircumnuclear disks. For three of the galaxies, we fit Keplerian rotation\ncurves to estimate their supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, and determine\n(2.9 $\\pm$ 0.3) $\\times~10^{6}M_\\odot$ for J0437+2456, (1.7 $\\pm$ 0.1)\n$\\times~10^{7}M_\\odot$ for ESO 558$-$G009, and (1.1 $\\pm$ 0.2)\n$\\times~10^{7}M_\\odot$ for NGC 5495. In the other two galaxies, Mrk 1029 and\nNGC 1320, the geometry and dynamics are more complicated and preclude robust\nblack hole mass estimates. Including our new results, we compiled a list of 15\nVLBI-confirmed disk maser galaxies with robust SMBH mass measurements. With\nthis sample, we confirm the empirical relation of $R_{out} \\propto 0.3\nM_{SMBH}$ reported in Wardle & Yusef-Zadeh (2012). We also find a tentative\ncorrelation between maser disk outer radii and WISE luminosity. We find no\ncorrelations of maser disk size with X-ray 2-10 keV luminosity or [O III]\nluminosity.\n", "  Aims: PSR J0855-4644 is a fast-spinning, energetic pulsar discovered at radio\nwavelengths near the south-eastern rim of the supernova remnant RX\nJ0852.0-4622. A follow-up observation revealed the pulsar's X-ray counterpart\nand a slightly asymmetric PWN suggesting possible jet structures. PSR\nJ0855-4644 is a pulsar with one of the highest \\dot{E}/d^{2} from which no GeV\n\\gamma-ray pulsations have been detected. Methods: With a dedicated Chandra\nobservation, we perform detailed spatial modelling to constrain the geometry of\nthe PWN, in particular the pulsar's line of sight \\zeta_{\\rm PSR}. We also\nperform geometric radio and \\gamma-ray light curve modelling to further\nconstrain \\zeta_{\\rm PSR} and the magnetic obliquity \\alpha. Results: The\nobservation reveals that the compact XMM source, thought to be the X-ray\npulsar, can be further resolved into a point source surrounded by an elongated\naxisymmetric nebula with a longitudinal extent of 10\". The pulsar flux\nrepresents only \\sim 1\\% of the XMM compact source and its spectrum is well\ndescribed by a blackbody of temperature kT=0.2 keV while the surrounding nebula\nhas a much harder spectrum (\\Gamma=1.1 for a power-law model). Assuming the\norigin of the extended emission is from a double torus yields \\zeta_{\\rm\nPSR}=32.5\\dg \\pm 4.3\\dg. Independent constraints from geometric light curve\nmodelling yield \\alpha\\lesssim55\\dg and \\zeta\\lesssim55\\dg, and\n10\\dg\\lesssim|\\zeta-\\alpha|\\lesssim30\\dg. A \\chi^2 fit to the radio light curve\nyields a best fit at (\\alpha,\\zeta_{\\rm PSR}) = (22\\dg, 8\\dg), with an\nalternative fit at (\\alpha,\\zeta_{\\rm PSR}) = (9\\dg, 25\\dg) within 3\\sigma.\nSuch a geometry would explain, in the standard caustic pulsar model picture,\nthe radio-loud and \\gamma-ray-quiet behaviour of this high \\dot{E}/d^{2}\npulsar.\n", "  A possible role of quantum effects, such as tunneling and zero-point energy,\nin the structural dynamics of supercooled liquids is studied by dielectric\nspectroscopy. Presented results demonstrate that the liquids, bulk\n3-methylpentane 3MP and confined normal and deuterated water have low glass\ntransition temperature and unusually low for their class of materials steepness\nof the temperature dependence of structural relaxation, or fragility. Although\nwe do not find any signs of tunneling in structural relaxation of these\nliquids, their unusually low fragility can be well described by the influence\nof the quantum fluctuations. Confined water presents especially interesting\ncase in comparison to the earlier data on bulk low-density amorphous and vapor\ndeposited water. Confined water exhibits much weaker isotope effect than bulk\nwater, although the effect is still significant. We show that it can be\nascribed to the change of the energy barrier for relaxation due to a decrease\nin the zero-point energy upon D-H substitution. The observed difference in the\nbehavior of confined and bulk water demonstrates high sensitivity of quantum\neffects to the barrier heights and structure of water. Moreover, these results\ndemonstrate that extrapolation of confined water properties to the bulk water\nbehavior is questionable.\n", "  An analysis of the energy spectra of cosmic rays and particularly the precise\ndata from the AMS-02 experiment support the view about the important role of\nthe Local Bubble in the nearby interstellar medium. It is suggested that the\nbulk of cosmic rays below about 200 GV of rigidity (momentum/charge ratio)\ncomes from the modest number of supernova remnants in the Local Bubble which\nappear to have occurred some $10^6$ years ago and contributed to its formation.\nAt higher rigidities the contribution from a 'Local Source', a single supernova\nremnant generated some $10^5$ years ago seems to dominate up to, at least 1000\nGV.\n", "  Recently it was noted that different IceCube datasets are not consistent with\nthe same power law spectrum of the cosmic neutrinos: this is the IceCube\nspectral anomaly, that suggests that they observe a multicomponent spectrum. In\nthis work, the main possibilities to enhance the description in terms of a\nsingle extragalactic neutrino component are examined. The hypothesis of a\nsizable contribution of Galactic high-energy neutrino events distributed as\n$E^{-2.7}$ [ApJ 826, 185 (2016)] is critically analyzed and its natural\ngeneralization is considered. The stability of the expectations is studied by\nintroducing free parameters, motivated by theoretical considerations and\nobservational facts. The upgraded model here examined has 1)~a Galactic\ncomponent with different normalization and shape $E^{- 2.4}$; 2)~an\nextragalactic neutrino spectrum based on new data; 3)~a non-zero prompt\ncomponent of atmospheric neutrinos. The two key predictions of the model\nconcern the `high-energy starting events' collected from the Southern sky. The\nGalactic component produces a softer spectrum and a testable angular\nanisotropy. A second, radically different class of models, where the second\ncomponent is instead isotropic, plausibly extragalactic and with a relatively\nsoft spectrum, is disfavored instead by existing observations of muon neutrinos\nfrom the Northern sky and below few 100 TeV.\n", "  The optical absorption spectrums of nanomotors made from double-wall carbon\nnanotubes have been calculated with the time-dependent density functional based\ntight binding method. When the outer short tube of the nanomotor moves along or\nrotates around the inner long tube, the peaks in the spectrum will gradually\nevolve and may shift periodically, the amplitude of which can be as large as\nhundreds of meV. We show that the features and behaviors of the optical\nabsorption spectrum could be used to monitor the mechanical motions of the\ndouble-wall carbon nanotube based nanomotor.\n", "  {Following a successfully quantization scheme previously }{{% developed {\\ in\nRef. \\cite{GUPTAEVEN} for a}} parity-even {gauge sector} {of the SME, we}} have\nestablished the Gupta-Bleuler {% quantization {of a} {\\ parity-odd} and\nCPT-even }electrodynamics of {the }standard model extension (SME) {without\nrecoursing to a small photon mass regulator}. {Keeping the photons massless,}\n{% {we have adopted the gauge fixing condition:}} $G(A_{\\mu })=(\\partial\n_{0}+\\kappa^{0j}\\partial _{j}) (A_{0}+\\kappa ^{0k}A_{k})+\\partial _{i}A^{i}$% .\nThe{\\ four} polarization vectors of the gauge field are {% exactly} determined\nby solving an eigenvalue problem,{\\ exhibiting birefringent second order\ncontributions in the Lorentz-violating parameters}% . They allow to express the\nHamiltonian in terms of annihilation and creation operators whose positivity is\nguaranteed by imposing a weak Gupta-Bleuler constraint, defining the physical\nstates. Consequently, we compute the field commutation relation which has been\nexpressed in terms of Pauli-Jordan functions modified by Lorentz violation\nwhose light-cone structures have allowed to analyze the microcausality issue.\n", "  Macrospicules are relatively large spicule-like formations found mainly over\nthe polar coronal holes when observing in the transition region spectral lines.\nIn this study, we took advantage of the two short series of observations in the\nHe II 304 \\r{A} line obtained by the TESIS solar observatory with a cadence of\nup to 3.5 s to study the dynamics of macrospicules in unprecedented detail. We\nused a one-dimensional hydrodynamic method based on the assumption of their\naxial symmetry and on a simple radiative transfer model to reconstruct the\nevolution of the internal velocity field of 18 macrospicules from this dataset.\nBesides the internal dynamics, we studied the motion of the apparent end points\nof the same 18 macrospicules and found 15 of them to follow parabolic\ntrajectories with high precision which correspond closely to the obtained\nvelocity fields. We found that in a clear, unperturbed case these macrospicules\nmove with a constant deceleration inconsistent with a purely ballistic motion\nand have roughly the same velocity along their entire axis, with the obtained\ndecelerations typically ranging from 160 to 230 m/s^2, and initial velocities\nfrom 80 to 130 km/s. We also found a propagating acoustic wave for one of the\nmacrospicules and a clear linear correlation between the initial velocities of\nthe macrospicules and their decelerations, which indicates that they may be\ndriven by magneto-acoustic shocks. Finally, we inverted our previous method by\ntaking velocities from the parabolic fits to give rough estimates of the\npercentage of mass lost by 12 of the macrospicules. We found that typically\nfrom 10 to 30% of their observed mass fades out of the line (presumably being\nheated to higher coronal temperatures) with three exceptions of 50% and one of\n80%.\n", "  Surface asymmetries of accreting neutron stars are investigated for their\nmass quadrupole moment content. Though the amplitude of the gravitational waves\nfrom such asymmetries seem to be beyond the limit of detectability of the\npresent generation of detectors, it appears that rapidly rotating neutron stars\nwith strong magnetic fields residing in HMXBs would be worth considering for\ntargeted search for continuous gravitational waves with the next generation of\ninstruments.\n", "  It is an exceptionally opportune time for Astrophysics when a number of\nnext-generation mega-instruments are poised to observe the universe across the\nentire electromagnetic spectrum with unprecedented data quality. The Square\nKilometre Array (SKA) is undoubtedly one of the major components of this\nscenario. In particular, the SKA is expected to discover tens of thousands of\nnew neutron stars giving a major fillip to a wide range of scientific\ninvestigations. India has a sizeable community of scientists working on\ndifferent aspects of neutron star physics with immediate access to both the\nuGMRT (an SKA pathfinder) and the recently launched X-ray observatory Astrosat.\nThe current interests of the community largely centre around studies of - a)\nthe generation of neutron stars and the SNe connection}, b) the neutron star\npopulation and evolutionary pathways}, c) the evolution of neutron stars in\nbinaries and the magnetic fields}, d) the neutron star equation of state}, e)\nthe radio pulsar emission mechanism}, and, f) the radio pulsars as probes of\ngravitational physics}. Most of these studies are the main goals of the SKA\nfirst phase, which is likely to be operational in the next four years. This\narticle summarises the science goals of the Indian neutron star community in\nthe SKA era, with significant focus on coordinated efforts among the SKA and\nother existing/upcoming instruments.\n", "  Hadronic decays of radially excited $2D$ $D(2^3D_1)$, $D(2^3D_3)$, $D(2D_2)$\nand $D(2D^\\prime_2)$ have been studied in a $^3P_0$ model. All OZI-allowed\ndecay channels of these $2D$ $D$ resonances have been given, and relevant decay\nwidths have been calculated. $D(2550)$, $D^*(2600)$, $D(2750)$, $D^*_1(2760)$\nand $D^*_3(2760)$ can be produced in hadronic decays of $D(2^3D_1)$,\n$D(2^3D_3)$, $D(2D_2)$ and $D(2D^\\prime_2)$. In different assignments, hadronic\ndecay widths and some relevant ratios from the $2D$ $D$ resonances to\n$D(2550)$, $D^*(2600)$, $D(2750)$, $D^*_1(2760)$ or $D^*_3(2760)$ final states\nhave been predicted, which may provide some more information to identify these\nresonances in forthcoming experiments.\n", "  The applicability of the density functional based tight binding (DFTB) method\nto the description of hydrogen bond dynamics and infrared spectroscopy is\naddressed for the exemplary protic ionic liquid triethylammonium nitrate.\nPotential energy curves for proton transfer in gas and liquid phase are shown\nto be comparable to high level coupled cluster theory in the thermally\naccessible range of bond lengths. Geometric correlations in the hydrogen bond\ndynamics are analyzed for a cluster of six ion pairs. Comparing DFTB and\nregular DFT data lends further support for the reliability of the DFTB method.\nTherefore, DFTB bulk simulations are performed to quantify the extent of\ngeometric correlations in terms of Pauling's bond order model. Further,\ninfrared (IR) absorption spectra are obtained and analyzed putting emphasis on\nthe signatures of hydrogen bonding in the NH-stretching and far IR hydrogen\nbond range.\n", "  We demonstrate a new way to extend the coherence time of separated\nBose-Einstein condensates that involves immersion into a superfluid bath. When\nboth the system and the bath have similar scattering lengths, immersion in a\nsuperfluid bath cancels out inhomogeneous potentials either imposed by external\nfields or inherent in density fluctuations due to atomic shot noise. This\neffect, which we call superfluid shielding, allows for coherence lifetimes\nbeyond the projection noise limit. We probe the coherence between separated\ncondensates in different sites of an optical lattice by monitoring the contrast\nand decay of Bloch oscillations. Our technique demonstrates a new way that\ninteractions can improve the performance of quantum devices.\n", "  We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of observations from X-ray,\nnear-infrared to centimeter wavelengths to probe the star formation processes\nin the S237 region. Multi-wavelength images trace an almost sphere-like shell\nmorphology of the region, which is filled with the 0.5--2 keV X-ray emission.\nThe region contains two distinct environments - a bell-shaped cavity-like\nstructure containing the peak of 1.4 GHz emission at center, and elongated\nfilamentary features without any radio detection at edges of the sphere-like\nshell - where {\\it Herschel} clumps are detected. Using the 1.4 GHz continuum\nand $^{12}$CO line data, the S237 region is found to be excited by a radio\nspectral type of B0.5V star and is associated with an expanding H{\\sc ii}\nregion. The photoionized gas appears to be responsible for the origin of the\nbell-shaped structure. The majority of molecular gas is distributed toward a\nmassive {\\it Herschel} clump (M$_{clump}$ $\\sim$260 M$_{\\odot}$), which\ncontains the filamentary features and has a noticeable velocity gradient. The\nphotometric analysis traces the clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) mainly\ntoward the bell-shaped structure and the filamentary features. Considering the\nlower dynamical age of the H\\,{\\sc ii} region (i.e. 0.2-0.8 Myr), these\nclusters are unlikely to be formed by the expansion of the H\\,{\\sc ii} region.\nOur results also show the existence of a cluster of YSOs and a massive clump at\nthe intersection of filamentary features, indicating that the collisions of\nthese features may have triggered cluster formation, similar to those found in\nSerpens South region.\n", "  An Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) with center-of-mass energies sqrt(s_{eN}) ~\n20-100 GeV and luminosity L ~ 10^{34} cm^{-2} s^{-1} would offer new\nopportunities to study heavy quark production in high-energy electron or photon\nscattering on protons and nuclei. We report about an R&D project exploring the\nfeasibility of direct measurements of nuclear gluon densities at large x\n(gluonic EMC effect, antishadowing) using open charm production at EIC. We\ndescribe the charm production rates and angle-momentum distributions at large x\nand discuss methods of charm reconstruction using next-generation detector\ncapabilities (pi/K identification, vertex reconstruction). The results can be\nused also for other physics applications of heavy quark production at EIC\n(fragmentation functions, jets, heavy quark propagation in nuclei).\n", "  We present a measurement of the charged particle reconstruction inefficiency\ninside of jet cores, using data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 of\n$pp$ collisions produced at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The\ndetermination of this inefficiency is important for jet energy scale and mass\ncalibration, as well as multiple other performance studies and analyses. A data\ndriven method is used, where the fraction of lost particle tracks is determined\nfrom energy deposition $dE/dx$ in the pixel detector. The fraction of lost\ntracks is found to be less than 5%, which is an improvement since the previous\nstudy, and agrees well within systematic uncertainties with a Monte Carlo\nsimulation.\n", "  We express the Einstein-Vlasov system in spherical symmetry in terms of a\ndimensionless momentum variable $z$ (radial over angular momentum). This\nregularises the limit of massless particles, and in that limit allows us to\nobtain a reduced system in independent variables $(t,r,z)$ only. Similarly, in\nthis limit the Vlasov density function $f$ for static solutions depends on a\nsingle variable $Q$ (energy over angular momentum). This reduction allows us to\nshow that any given static metric which has vanishing Ricci scalar, is vacuum\nat the centre and for $r>3M$ and obeys certain energy conditions uniquely\ndetermines a consistent $f=\\bar k(Q)$ (in closed form). Vice versa, any $\\bar\nk(Q)$ within a certain class uniquely determines a static metric (as the\nsolution of a system of two first-order quasilinear ODEs). Hence the space of\nstatic spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein-Vlasov is locally a space of\nfunctions of one variable. For a simple 2-parameter family of functions $\\bar\nk(Q)$, we construct the corresponding static spherically symmetric solutions,\nfinding that their compactness is in the interval $0.7\\lesssim \\rm\nmax_r(2M/r)\\le 8/9$. This class of static solutions includes one that agrees\nwith the approximately universal type-I critical solution recently found by\nAkbarian and Choptuik (AC) in numerical time evolutions. We speculate on what\nsingles it out as the critical solution found by fine-tuning generic data to\nthe collapse threshold, given that AC also found that {\\em all} static\nsolutions are one-parameter unstable and sit on the threshold of collapse.\n", "  We study the domain walls which form when Bose condensates acquire a\ndouble-well dispersion. Experiments have observed such domain walls in\ncondensates driven across a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking phase transition\nin a shaken optical lattice. We derive a generic model to describe the\ndispersion and to compute the wavefunctions and energies of the domain walls.\nWe find two distinct regimes which demand different physical pictures. In the\nweak coupling regime, where interactions are weak compared to the kinetic\nenergy barrier, \"density wave domain walls\" form that support an extended\ndensity wave and a series of phase steps. These features can be understood as\nthe quantum interference between domains with distinct momenta. In the strong\ncoupling regime where interaction dominates, the system forms \"phase domain\nwalls\" which have the minimum width allowed by the uncertainty principle and\nsuppressed density modulation. Analytic results for the domain wall\nwavefunctions are obtained in the two regimes. The energy of domain walls\nbehaves similarly to that of topological defects in paradigmatic field\ntheories.\n", "  Neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries exhibit oscillations during\nthermonuclear bursts, attributed to asymmetric brightness patterns on the\nburning surfaces. All models that have been proposed to explain the origin of\nthese asymmetries (spreading hotspots, surface waves, and cooling wakes) depend\non the accretion rate. By analysis of archival RXTE data of six oscillation\nsources, we investigate the accretion rate dependence of the amplitude of burst\noscillations. This more than doubles the size of the sample analysed previously\nby Muno et al. (2004), who found indications for a relationship between\naccretion rate and oscillation amplitudes. We find that burst oscillation\nsignals can be detected at all observed accretion rates. Moreover, oscillations\nat low accretion rates are found to have relatively small amplitudes\n($A_\\text{rms}\\leq0.10$) while oscillations detected in bursts observed at high\naccretion rates cover a broad spread in amplitudes ($0.05\\leq\nA_\\text{rms}\\leq0.20$). In this paper we present the results of our analysis\nand discuss these in the light of current burst oscillation models.\nAdditionally, we investigate the bursts of two sources without previously\ndetected oscillations. Despite that these sources have been observed at\naccretion rates where burst oscillations might be expected, we find their\nbehaviour to be not anomalous compared to oscillation sources.\n", "  Pulsed spin-torque switching has been studied using single-shot time-resolved\nelectrical measurements in perpendicularly magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions\nas a function of pulse amplitude and junction size in 50 to 100 nm diameter\ncircular junctions. The mean switching time depends inversely on pulse\namplitude for all junctions studied. However, the switching dynamics is found\nto be strongly dependent on junction size and pulse amplitude. In 50 nm\ndiameter junctions the switching onset is stochastic but the switching once\nstarted, is fast; after being initiated it takes less than 2 ns to switch. In\nlarger diameter junctions the time needed for complete switching is strongly\ndependent on the pulse amplitude, reaching times less than 2 ns at large pulse\namplitudes. Anomalies in the switching rate versus pulse amplitude are shown to\nbe associated with the long lived (> 2 ns) intermediate junction resistance\nstates.\n", "  Spectrum of bosonic scalar-mode excitations in a normal Fermi liquid with a\nlocal scalar interaction is investigated for various values and momentum\ndependence of the scalar Landau parameter $f_0$ in the particle-hole channel.\nFor $f_0 >0$ the conditions are found when the phase velocity on the spectrum\nof the zero sound acquires a minimum at a non-zero momentum. For $-1<f_0 <0$\nthere are only damped excitations, and for $f_0<-1$ the spectrum becomes\nunstable against a growth of scalar-mode excitations. An effective Lagrangian\nfor the scalar excitation modes is derived after performing a bosonization\nprocedure. We demonstrate that the instability may be tamed by the formation of\na static Bose condensate of the scalar modes. The condensation may occur in a\nhomogeneous or inhomogeneous state relying on the momentum dependence of the\nscalar Landau parameter. We show that in the isospin-symmetric nuclear matter\nthere may appear a metastable state at a subsaturation nuclear density owing to\nthe condensate. Then we consider a possibility of the condensation of the\nzero-sound-like excitations in a state with a non-zero momentum in Fermi\nliquids moving with overcritical velocities, provided an appropriate momentum\ndependence of the Landau parameter $f_0 (k)>0$. We also argue that in\nperipheral heavy-ion collisions the Pomeranchuk instability may occur already\nfor $f_0 >-1$.\n", "  Hydrodynamical interaction of spherical ejecta freely expanding at mildly\nrelativistic speeds into an ambient cold medium is studied in semi-analytical\nand numerical ways to investigate how ejecta produced in energetic stellar\nexplosions dissipate their kinetic energy through the interaction with the\nsurrounding medium. We especially focus on the case in which the circumstellar\nmedium is well represented by a steady wind at a constant mass-loss rate having\nbeen ejected from the stellar surface prior to the explosion. As a result of\nthe hydrodynamical interaction, the ejecta and circumstellar medium are swept\nby the reverse and forward shocks, leading to the formation of a geometrically\nthin shell. We present a semi-analytical model describing the dynamical\nevolution of the shell and compare the results with numerical simulations. The\nshell can give rise to bright emission as it gradually becomes transparent to\nphotons. while it is optically thick. We develop an emission model for the\nexpected emission from the optically thick shell, in which photons in the shell\ngradually diffuse out to the interstellar space. Then, we investigate the\npossibility that radiation powered by the hydrodynamical interaction is the\norigin of an underluminous class of gamma-ray bursts.\n", "  Mid-IR water lines from protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars have a\ndetection rate of 50\\%. Models have identified multiple physical properties of\ndisks such as dust-to-gas mass ratio, dust size power law distribution, disk\ngas mass, disk inner radius, and disk scale height as potential explanation for\nthe current detection rate. We search for a connection between mid-IR water\nline fluxes and the strength of the 10~$\\mu$m silicate feature. We analyse\nobserved water line fluxes from three blends and compute the 10~$\\mu$m silicate\nfeature strength from Spitzer spectra. We use a series of published models,\nexploring disk dust and gas properties, and the effects of different stars. The\nmodels also show that the increasing stellar luminosity enhance simultaneously\nthe strength of this dust feature and the water lines fluxes. No correlation is\nfound between the observed mid-IR water lines and the 10~$\\mu$m silicate. Our\nsample shows the same difference in the peak strength between amorphous and\ncrystalline silicates that was noted in earlier studies, but our models do not\nsupport this intrinsic difference in silicate peak strength. Individual\nproperties of our model series are not able to reproduce the most extreme\nobservations, suggesting that more complex dust properties are required. A\nparametrized settling prescription is able to boost the peak strength by a\nfactor 2 for the standard model. Water line fluxes are unrelated to the\ncomposition of the dust. The pronounced regular trends seen in the model\nresults are washed out in the data due to the larger diversity in stellar and\ndisk properties compared to our model series. The disks with with weaker mid-IR\nwater line fluxes are depleted in gas or enhanced in dust in the inner 10~au.\nIn the case of gas depleted disks, settling produces very strong 10~$\\mu$m\nsilicate features, with strong peak strength.\n", "  We derive the gauge covariance requirement imposed on the QED fermion-photon\nthree-point function within the framework of a spectral representation for\nfermion propagators. When satisfied, such requirement ensures solutions to the\nfermion propagator Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) in any covariant gauge with\narbitrary numbers of spacetime dimensions to be consistent with the\nLandau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation (LKFT). The general result has been\nverified by the special cases of three and four dimensions. Additionally, we\npresent the condition that ensures the vacuum polarization is independent of\nthe gauge parameter. As an illustration, we show how the Gauge Technique\ndimensionally regularized in 4D does not satisfy the covariance requirement.\n", "  The Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab will measure the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon to a precision of 140 parts per billion, which is a factor\nof four improvement over the previous E821 measurement at Brookhaven. The\nexperiment will also extend the search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of\nthe muon by approximately two orders of magnitude, with a sensitivity down to\n$10^{-21}$ e.cm. Both of these measurements are made by combining a precise\nmeasurement of the 1.45T storage ring magnetic field with an analysis of the\nmodulation of the decay rate of higher-energy positrons (from anti-muons),\nrecorded by 24 calorimeters and 3 straw tracking detectors. The recent progress\nin the alignment of the electrostatic quadrapole plates and the trolley rails\ninside the vacuum chambers, and in establishing the uniform storage ring\nmagnetic field will be described.\n", "  We make use of new subgrid model of turbulent mixing to accurately follow the\ncosmological evolution of the first stars, the mixing of their supernova\nejecta, and the impact on the chemical composition of the Galactic Halo. Using\nthe cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, we implement a model for\nthe pollution of pristine gas as described in Pan et al. Tracking the\nmetallicity of Pop III stars with metallicities below a critical value allows\nus to account for the fraction of Z < Zcrit stars formed even in regions in\nwhich the gas' average metallicity is well above Zcrit. We demonstrate that\nsuch partially-mixed regions account for 0.5 to 0.7 of all Pop III stars formed\nup to z = 5. Additionally, we track the creation and transport of \"primordial\nmetals\" (PM) generated by Pop III supernovae (SNe). These neutron-capture\ndeficient metals are taken up by second-generation stars and likely lead to\nunique abundance signatures characteristic of carbon-enhanced, metal-poor\n(CEMP-no) stars. As an illustrative example, we associate primordial metals\nwith abundance ratios used by Keller et al. to explain the source of metals in\nthe star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, finding good agreement with the observed\n[Fe/H], [C/H], [O/H], and [Mg/Ca] ratios in CEMP-no Milky Way halo stars.\nSimilar future simulations will aid in further constraining the properties of\nPop III stars using CEMP observations, as well as improve predictions of the\nspatial distribution of Pop III stars, as will be explored by the next\ngeneration of ground- and space-based telescopes.\n", "  We use high-resolution Herschel-PACS data of 2 nearby elliptical galaxies,\nIC1459 & NGC2768 to characterize their dust and stellar content. IC1459 &\nNGC2768 have an unusually large amount of dust for elliptical galaxies (1-3 x\n10^5 Msun), this dust is also not distributed along the stellar content. Using\ndata from GALEX (ultraviolet) to PACS (far-infrared), we analyze the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of these galaxies with CIGALEMC as a function of the\nprojected position, binning images in 7.2\" pixels. From this analysis, we\nderive maps of SED parameters, such as the metallicity, the stellar mass, the\nfraction of young star and the dust mass. The larger amount of dust in FIR maps\nseems related in our model to a larger fraction of young stars which can reach\nup to 4% in the dustier area. The young stellar population is fitted as a\nrecent (~ 0.5 Gyr) short burst of star formation for both galaxies. The\nmetallicities, which are fairly large at the center of both galaxies, decrease\nwith the radial distance with fairly steep gradient for elliptical galaxies.\n", "  We report on wide-field optically detected magnetic resonance imaging of\nnitrogen-vacancy centers (NVs) in type IIa polycrystalline diamond. These\nstudies reveal a heterogeneous crystalline environment that produces a varied\ndensity of NV centers, including preferential orientation within some\nindividual crystal grains, but preserves long spin coherence times. Using the\nnative NVs as nanoscale sensors, we introduce a 3-dimensional strain imaging\ntechnique with high sensitivity ( $< 10^{-5}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$) and\ndiffraction-limited resolution across a wide field of view.\n", "  The actin cytoskeleton is a key component in the machinery of eukaryotic\ncells, and it selfassembles out of equilibrium into a wide variety of\nbiologically crucial structures. While the molecular mechanisms involved are\nwell characterized, the physical principles governing the spatial arrangement\nof actin filaments are not understood. Here we propose that the dynamics of\nactin network assembly from growing filaments results from a competition\nbetween diffusion, bundling, and steric hindrance, and is responsible for the\nrange of observed morphologies. Our model and simulations thus predict an\nabrupt dynamical transition between homogeneous and strongly bundled networks\nas a function of the actin polymerization rate. This suggests that cells may\neffect dramatic changes to their internal architecture through minute\nmodifications of their nonequilibrium dynamics. Our results are consistent with\navailable experimental data.\n", "  The specific property of a planar tunnel junction with thin-film diffusive\nplates and long enough leads is an essential enhancement of its transmission\ncoefficient compared to the bare transparency of the tunnel barrier [1,2]. In\nvoltage-biased junctions, this creates favourable conditions for strong\nnonequilibrium of quasiparticles in the junction plates and leads, produced by\nmultiparticle tunneling. We study theoretically the interplay between the\nnonequilibrium and relaxation processes in such junctions and found that\nnonequilibrium in the leads noticeably modifies the current-voltage\ncharacteristic at $eV > 2\\Delta$, especially the excess current, whereas strong\ndiffusive relaxation restores the result of the classical tunnel model. At $eV\n\\leq 2\\Delta$, the diffusive relaxation decreases the peaks of the\nmultiparticle currents. The inelastic relaxation in the junction plates\nessentially suppresses the $n$-particle currents ($n>2$) by the factor $n$ for\nodd and $n/2$ for even $n$. The results may be important for the problem of\ndecoherence in Josephson-junction based superconducting qubits.\n", "  Since quantum coherence is an undoubted characteristic trait of quantum\nphysics, the quantification and application of quantum coherence has been one\nof the long-standing central topics in quantum information science. Within the\nframework of a resource theory of quantum coherence proposed recently, a\n\\textit{fiducial basis} should be pre-selected for characterizing the quantum\ncoherence in specific circumstances, namely, the quantum coherence is a\n\\textit{basis-dependent} quantity. Therefore, a natural question is raised:\nwhat are the maximum and minimum coherences contained in a certain quantum\nstate with respect to a generic basis? While the minimum case is trivial, it is\nnot so intuitive to verify in which basis the quantum coherence is maximal.\nBased on the coherence measure of relative entropy, we indicate the particular\nbasis in which the quantum coherence is maximal for a given state, where the\nFourier matrix (or more generally, \\textit{complex Hadamard matrices}) plays a\ncritical role in determining the basis. Intriguingly, though we can prove that\nthe basis associated with the Fourier matrix is a stationary point for\noptimizing the $l_1$ norm of coherence, numerical simulation shows that it is\nnot a global optimal choice.\n", "  Interesting nonlinear generalization of both Schr\\\"odinger's and\nKlein-Gordon's equations have been recently advanced by Tsallis, Rego-Monteiro,\nand Tsallis (NRT) in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 106}, 140601 (2011)]. There is much\ncurrent activity going on in this area. The non-linearity is governed by a real\nparameter $q$. It is a fact that the ensuing non linear q-Schr\\\"odinger and\nq-Klein-Gordon equations are natural manifestations of very high energy\nphenomena, as verified by LHC-experiments. This happens for $q-$values close to\nunity [Nucl. Phys. A {\\bf 955}, 16 (2016), Nucl. Phys. A {\\bf 948}, 19 (2016)].\nIt is also well known that q-exponential behavior is found in quite different\nsettings. An explanation for such phenomenon was given in [Physica A {\\bf 388},\n601 (2009)] with reference to empirical scenarios in which data are collected\nvia set-ups that effect a normalization plus data's pre-processing. Precisely,\nthe ensuing normalized output was there shown to be q-exponentially distributed\nif the input data display elliptical symmetry, generalization of spherical\nsymmetry, a frequent situation. This makes it difficult, for q-values close to\nunity, to ascertain whether one is dealing with solutions to the ordinary\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (whose free particle solutions are exponentials, and for\nwhich $q=1$) or with its NRT nonlinear q-generalizations, whose free particle\nsolutions are q-exponentials. In this work we provide a careful analysis of the\n$q \\sim 1$ instance via a perturbative analysis of the NRT equations.\n", "  We extend some two Higgs doublet models, where the Yukawa couplings for the\ncharged fermion mass generation only involve one Higgs doublet, by two singlet\nscalars respectively carrying a singly electric charge and a doubly electric\ncharge. The doublet and singlet scalars together can mediate a two-loop diagram\nto generate a tiny Majorana mass matrix of the standard model neutrinos.\nRemarkably, the structure of the neutrino mass matrix is fully determined by\nthe symmetric Yukawa couplings of the doubly charged scalar to the right-handed\nleptons. Meanwhile, a one-loop induced neutrinoless double beta decay can\narrive at a testable level even if the electron neutrino has an extremely small\nMajorana mass. We also study other experimental constraints and implications\nincluding some rare processes and Higgs phenomenology.\n", "  Observations indicate that magnetic fields in rapidly rotating stars are very\nstrong, on both small and large scales. What is the nature of the resulting\ncorona? Here we seek to shed some light on this question. We use the results of\nan anelastic dynamo simulation of a rapidly rotating fully-convective M-star to\ndrive a physics-based model for the stellar corona. We find that due to the\nseveral kilo Gauss large-scale magnetic fields at high latitudes, the corona\nand its X-ray emission are dominated by star-size large hot loops, while the\nsmaller, underlying colder loops are not visible much in the X-ray. Based on\nthis result we propose that, in rapidly rotating stars, emission from such\ncoronal structures dominates the quiescent, cooler but saturated X-ray\nemission.\n", "  Aims: We present a study of the Galactic supernova remnant SNR G15.9+0.2 with\narchival XMM-Newton observations. Methods: EPIC data are used to investigate\nthe morphological and spectral properties of the remnant, searching in\nparticular for supernova ejecta and Fe K line emission. By comparing the SNR's\nX-ray absorption column density with the atomic and molecular gas distribution\nalong the line of sight, we attempt to constrain the distance to the SNR.\nResults: Prominent line features reveal the presence of ejecta. Abundance\nratios of Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca strongly suggest that the progenitor of SNR\nG15.9+0.2 was a massive star with a main sequence mass likely in the range\n20-25 $M_{\\odot}$, strengthening the physical association with a candidate\ncentral compact object detected with Chandra. Using EPIC's collective power, Fe\nK line emission from SNR G15.9+0.2 is detected for the first time. We measure\nthe line properties and find evidence for spatial variations. We discuss how\nthe source fits within the sample of SNRs with detected Fe K emission and find\nthat it is the core-collapse SNR with the lowest Fe K centroid energy. We also\npresent some caveats regarding the use of Fe K line centroid energy as a typing\ntool for SNRs. Only a lower limit of 5 kpc is placed on the distance to SNR\nG15.9+0.2, constraining its age to $t_{SNR} \\gtrsim 2$ kyr.\n", "  The streaming instability is a mechanism to concentrate solid particles into\noverdense filaments that undergo gravitational collapse and form planetesimals.\nHowever, it remains unclear how the initial mass function of these\nplanetesimals depends on the box dimensions of numerical simulations. To\nresolve this, we perform simulations of planetesimal formation with the largest\nbox dimensions to date, allowing planetesimals to form simultaneously in\nmultiple filaments that can only emerge within such large simulation boxes. In\nour simulations, planetesimals with sizes between 80 km and several hundred\nkilometers form. We find that a power law with a rather shallow exponential\ncutoff at the high-mass end represents the cumulative birth mass function\nbetter than an integrated power law. The steepness of the exponential cutoff is\nlargely independent of box dimensions and resolution, while the exponent of the\npower law is not constrained at the resolutions we employ. Moreover, we find\nthat the characteristic mass scale of the exponential cutoff correlates with\nthe mass budget in each filament. Together with previous studies of\nhigh-resolution simulations with small box domains, our results therefore imply\nthat the cumulative birth mass function of planetesimals is consistent with an\nexponentially tapered power law with a power-law exponent of approximately -1.6\nand a steepness of the exponential cutoff in the range of 0.3-0.4.\n", "  We combine observational data on a dozen independent cosmic properties at\nhigh-$z$ with the information on reionization drawn from the spectra of distant\nluminous sources and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to constrain the\ninterconnected evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium since the\ndark ages. The only acceptable solutions are concentrated in two narrow sets.\nIn one of them reionization proceeds in two phases: a first one driven by\nPopulation III stars, completed at $z\\sim 10$, and after a short recombination\nperiod a second one driven by normal galaxies, completed at $z\\sim 6$. In the\nother set both kinds of sources work in parallel until full reionization at\n$z\\sim 6$. The best solution with double reionization gives excellent fits to\nall the observed cosmic histories, but the CMB optical depth is 3-$\\sigma$\nlarger than the recent estimate from the Planck data. Alternatively, the best\nsolution with single reionization gives less good fits to the observed star\nformation rate density and cold gas mass density histories, but the CMB optical\ndepth is consistent with that estimate. We make several predictions, testable\nwith future observations, that should discriminate between the two reionization\nscenarios. As a byproduct our models provide a natural explanation to some\ncharacteristic features of the cosmic properties at high-$z$, as well as to the\norigin of globular clusters.\n", "  The transitional and well-developed regimes of turbulent shear flows exhibit\na variety of remarkable scaling laws that are only now beginning to be\nsystematically studied and understood. In the first part of this article, we\nsummarize recent progress in understanding the friction factor of turbulent\nflows in rough pipes and quasi-two-dimensional soap films, showing how the data\nobey a two-parameter scaling law known as roughness-induced criticality, and\nexhibit power-law scaling of friction factor with Reynolds number that depends\non the precise form of the nature of the turbulent cascade. These results hint\nat a non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that applies to turbulent\nflows. The second part of this article concerns the lifetime statistics in\nsmooth pipes around the transition, showing how the remarkable\nsuper-exponential scaling with Reynolds number reflects deep connections\nbetween large deviation theory, extreme value statistics, directed percolation\nand the onset of coexistence in predator-prey ecosystems. Both these phenomena\nreflect the way in which turbulence can be fruitfully approached as a problem\nin non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\n", "  The recent discovery that Cu contamination of Si combined with light exposure\nhas a significant detrimental impact on carrier life-time has drawn much\nconcern within the solar-Si community. The effect, known as the copper-related\nlight-induced degradation (Cu-LID) of Si solar cells, has been connected to the\nrelease of Cu interstitials within the bulk [Solar Energy Materials & Solar\nCells, 147:115-126, 2016]. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive analysis\nof the formation/dissociation process of the CuB pair in Si by means of\nfirst-principles modelling, as well as the interaction of CuB defects with\nphoto-excited minority carriers. We confirm that the long-range interaction\nbetween the Cu cation and the B anion has a Coulomb-like behaviour, in line\nwith the trapping-limited diffusivity of Cu observed by transient ion drift\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the short-range interaction between the\nd-electrons of Cu and the excess of negative charge on B produces a repulsive\neffect, thereby decreasing the binding energy of the pair when compared to the\nideal point-charge Coulomb model. We also find that metastable CuB pairs\nproduce acceptor states just below the conduction band minimum, which arise\nfrom the Cu level emptied by the B acceptor. Based on these results, we argue\nthat photo-generated minority carriers trapped by the metastable pairs can\nswitch off the Coulomb interaction that holds the pairs together, enhancing the\nrelease of Cu interstitials, and acting as a catalyst for Cu-LID.\n", "  We present, for the first time, the local [CII] 158 um emission line\nluminosity function measured using a sample of more than 500 galaxies from the\nRevised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). [CII] luminosities are measured from the\nHerschel PACS observations of the Luminous Infrared Galaxies in the Great\nObservatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) and estimated for the rest of the\nsample based on the far-IR luminosity and color. The sample covers 91.3% of the\nsky and is complete at S_60 um > 5.24 Jy. We calculated the completeness as a\nfunction of [CII] line luminosity and distance, based on the far-IR color and\nflux densities. The [CII] luminosity function is constrained in the range\n~10^(7-9) (Lo) from both the 1/V_max and a maximum likelihood methods. The\nshape of our derived [CII] emission line luminosity function agrees well with\nthe IR luminosity function. For the CO(1-0) and [CII] luminosity functions to\nagree, we propose a varying ratio of [CII]/CO(1-0) as a function of CO\nluminosity, with larger ratios for fainter CO luminosities. Limited [CII] high\nredshift observations as well as estimates based on the IR and UV luminosity\nfunctions are suggestive of an evolution in the [CII] luminosity function\nsimilar to the evolution trend of the cosmic star formation rate density. Deep\nsurveys using ALMA with full capability will be able to confirm this\nprediction.\n", "  The Superstripes 2016 conference, held on June 23-29, 2016 in the island of\nIschia in Italy celebrated the 20th anniversary of this series of conferences.\nFor 20 years structural, electronic, and magnetic phase inhomogeneities in\nquantum matter have been the scientific focus for a growing physics community\ninterested in complexity in quantum matter. It has been the meeting point for\ndifferent scientific communities facing the challenging project to unveil the\ncomplex space and time landscapes in quantum matter. The interesting spatial\ninhomogeneity length scale of multiple coexisting phase ranges from atomic to\nmesoscopic and the time fluctuations are spread over multiple time scales. The\nresponse of these materials changes using different experimental techniques\nwith different spatial and time resolution probing different aspects of the\nquantum complexity.\n", "  We identify and explore a high orbital angular momentum (OAM) harmonics\ngeneration and amplification mechanism that manipulates the OAM independently\nof any other laser property, by preserving the initial laser wavelength,\nthrough stimulated Raman backscattering in a plasma. The high OAM harmonics\nspectra can extend at least up to the limiting value imposed by the paraxial\napproximation. We show with theory and particle-in-cell simulations that the\norders of the OAM harmonics can be tuned according to a selection rule that\ndepends on the initial OAM of the interacting waves. We illustrate the high OAM\nharmonics generation in a plasma using several examples including the\ngeneration of prime OAM harmonics. The process can also be realised in any\nnonlinear optical Kerr media supporting three-wave interactions.\n", "  The moduli space of spiked instantons that arises in the context of the\nBPS/CFT correspondence is realised as the moduli space of classical vacua, i.e.\nlow-energy open string field configurations, of a certain stack of intersecting\nD1-branes and D5-branes in Type IIB string theory. The presence of a constant\nB-field induces an interesting dynamics involving the tachyon condensation.\n", "  We present X-ray source catalogs for the $\\approx7$ Ms exposure of the\nChandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S), which covers a total area of 484.2\narcmin$^2$. Utilizing WAVDETECT for initial source detection and ACIS Extract\nfor photometric extraction and significance assessment, we create a main source\ncatalog containing 1008 sources that are detected in up to three X-ray bands:\n0.5-7.0 keV, 0.5-2.0 keV, and 2-7 keV. A supplementary source catalog is also\nprovided including 47 lower-significance sources that have bright ($K_s\\le23$)\nnear-infrared counterparts. We identify multiwavelength counterparts for 992\n(98.4%) of the main-catalog sources, and we collect redshifts for 986 of these\nsources, including 653 spectroscopic redshifts and 333 photometric redshifts.\nBased on the X-ray and multiwavelength properties, we identify 711 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) from the main-catalog sources. Compared to the previous\n$\\approx4$ Ms CDF-S catalogs, 291 of the main-catalog sources are new\ndetections. We have achieved unprecedented X-ray sensitivity with average flux\nlimits over the central $\\approx1$ arcmin$^2$ region of\n$\\approx1.9\\times10^{-17}$, $6.4\\times10^{-18}$, and $2.7\\times10^{-17}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the three X-ray bands, respectively. We provide\ncumulative number-count measurements observing, for the first time, that normal\ngalaxies start to dominate the X-ray source population at the faintest 0.5-2.0\nkeV flux levels. The highest X-ray source density reaches $\\approx50\\,500$\ndeg$^{-2}$, and $47\\%\\pm4\\%$ of these sources are AGNs ($\\approx23\\,900$\ndeg$^{-2}$).\n", "  A simplistic design of a self-powered UV-photodetector device based on hybrid\nr-GO/GaN is demonstrated. Under zero bias, the fabricated hybrid photodetector\nshows a photosensivity of ~ 85% while ohmic contact GaN photodetector with\nidentical device structure exhibits only ~ 5.3% photosensivity at 350 nm\nillumination (18 microWatt/cm^2). The responsivity and detectivity of the\nhybrid device were found to be 1.54 mA/W and 1.45x10^10 Jones (cm Hz^(1/2)\nW^(-1)), respectively at zero bias under 350 nm illumination (18\nmicroWatt/cm^2) with fast response (60 ms), recovery time (267 ms) and\nexcellent repeatability. Power density-dependent responsivity & detectivity\nrevealed ultrasensitive behaviour under low light conditions. The source of\nobserved self-powered effect in hybrid photodetector is attributed to the\ndepletion region formed at the r-GO and GaN quasi-ohmic interface.\n", "  Motivated by the recently observed hypernucleus (Kiso event) $^{15}_{\\Xi}$C\n($^{14}$N$+\\Xi^-$), we identify the state of this system theoretically within\nthe framework of the relativistic-mean-field and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock models.\nThe $\\Xi N$ interactions are constructed to reproduce the two possibly observed\n$\\Xi^-$ removal energies, $4.38\\pm 0.25$ MeV or $1.11\\pm 0.25$ MeV. The present\nresult is preferable to be $^{14}{\\rm N}({\\rm g.s.})+\\Xi^-(1p)$, corresponding\nto the latter value.\n", "  Determining redshifts for BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects using the traditional\nspectroscopic method is challenging due to the absence of strong emission lines\nin their optical spectra. We employ the photometric dropout technique to\ndetermine redshifts for this class of blazars using the combined 13 broad-band\nfilters from Swift-UVOT and the multi-channel imager GROND at the MPG 2.2 m\ntelescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory. The wavelength range covered by these\n13 filters extends from far ultraviolet to the near-Infrared. We report results\non 40 new Fermi detected BL Lacs with the photometric redshifts determinations\nfor 5 sources, with 3FGL J1918.2-4110 being the most distant in our sample at\nz=2.16. Reliable upper limits are provided for 20 sources in this sample. Using\nthe highest energy photons for these Fermi-LAT sources, we evaluate the\nconsistency with the Gamma-ray horizon due to the extragalactic background\nlight.\n", "  Previous work on calculating energy spectra from Compton scattering events\nhas either neglected considering the pulsed structure of the incident laser\nbeam, or has calculated these effects in an approximate way subject to\ncriticism. In this paper, this problem has been reconsidered within a linear\nplane wave model for the incident laser beam. By performing the proper Lorentz\ntransformation of the Klein-Nishina scattering cross section, a spectrum\ncalculation can be created which allows the electron beam energy spread and\nemittance effects on the spectrum to be accurately calculated, essentially by\nsumming over the emission of each individual electron. Such an approach has the\nobvious advantage that it is easily integrated with a particle distribution\ngenerated by particle tracking, allowing precise calculations of spectra for\nrealistic particle distributions in collision. The method is used to predict\nthe energy spectrum of radiation passing through an aperture for the proposed\nOld Dominion University inverse Compton source. Many of the results allow easy\nscaling estimates to be made of the expected spectrum.\n", "  We developed a countermeasure against blinding attacks on low-noise detectors\nwith a background noise cancellation scheme in quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems. Background noise cancellation includes self-differencing and balanced\navalanche photon diode (APD) schemes and is considered a promising solution for\nlow-noise APDs, which are critical components in high-performance QKD systems.\nHowever, its vulnerability to blinding attacks has been recently reported. In\nthis work, we propose a new countermeasure that prevents this potential\nsecurity loophole from being used in detector blinding attacks. An experimental\nQKD setup is implemented and various tests are conducted to verify the\nfeasibility and performance of the proposed method. The obtained measurement\nresults show that the proposed scheme successfully detects occurring\nblinding-attack-based hacking attempts.\n", "  We consider the sharp interface limit of a coupled Stokes/Allen-Cahn system,\nwhen a parameter $\\varepsilon>0$ that is proportional to the thickness of the\ndiffuse interface tends to zero, in a two dimensional bounded domain. For\nsufficiently small times we prove convergence of the solutions of the\nStokes/Allen-Cahn system to solutions of a sharp interface model, where the\ninterface evolution is given by the mean curvature equation with an additional\nconvection term coupled to a two-phase Stokes system with an additional\ncontribution to the stress tensor, which describes the capillary stress. To\nthis end we construct a suitable approximation of the solution of the\nStokes/Allen-Cahn system, using three levels of the terms in the formally\nmatched asymptotic calculations, and estimate the difference with the aid of a\nsuitable refinement of a spectral estimate of the linearized Allen-Cahn\noperator. Moreover, a careful treatment of the coupling terms is needed.\n", "  We present a deep imaging survey of the Virgo Cluster, designed to study the\nconnection between cluster galaxies and Virgo's diffuse intracluster light\n(ICL). Our observations span roughly 16 square degrees and reach a 3-sigma\ndepth of mu(B)=29.5 and mu(V)=28.5 mag/arcsec^2. At these depths, the limiting\nsystematic uncertainties are astrophysical: scattered starlight from foreground\nGalactic dust, and variations in faint background sources. The dust-scattered\nstarlight is well-traced by deep far-infrared imaging, making it\ndistinguishable from true Virgo diffuse light. Our imaging maps the Virgo core\naround M87 and the adjacent M86/M84 region, in subcluster B around M49, and in\nthe more distant W' cloud around NGC 4365. Most of the detected ICL is found in\nthe Virgo core and within the W' cloud, with little evidence for extensive ICL\nin subcluster B. The large amount of diffuse light seen in the infalling W'\ncloud likely illustrates the importance of the group environment for generating\nICL. The bulk of the detected ICL is fairly red (B-V=0.7-0.9), indicative of\nold stellar populations. We estimate a total Virgo ICL fraction of 7-15%,\nsomewhat smaller than expected for massive, evolved clusters, suggesting that\nVirgo is still growing its ICL component. We trace M87's extremely boxy halo\nout to ~ 150 kpc, and show that the current stripping rate of low luminosity\ngalaxies is insufficient to have built M87's outer halo over a Hubble time.\nFinally, we identify another large ultra-diffuse galaxy in Virgo, likely in the\nprocess of being shredded by the cluster tidal field.\n", "  In unconventional superconductors, understanding the form of the pairing\ninteraction is the primary goal. In this regard, Raman spectroscopy is a very\nuseful tool, as it identifies the ground state and also the subleading pairing\nchannels by probing collective modes. Here we propose a general theory for\nmultiband Raman response and identify new features in the spectrum that can\nprovide a robust test for a pairing theory. We identify multiple\nBardasis-Schrieffer type collective modes and connect the weights of these\nmodes to the sub-leading gap structures within a microscopic pairing theory.\nThe conclusions are completely general, and we apply our approach to interpret\nthe B1g Raman scattering in hole-doped BaFe2As2.\n", "  The seesaw mechanism to derive the light masses of left-handed neutrinos\nusing heavy masses of right-handed neutrinos gives rise to a connection between\nlow-energy measurables and GUT-scale mechanism. We expresses the neutrino\nmixing angles in terms of a single variable $\\sin\\theta_{13}$, whose size was\nmeasured recently. The lepton asymmetry from heavy neutrinos via Yukawa\ncoupling is described by CP phases in both Dirac and Majorana type. It is shown\nthat the seesaw scale relevant to the lepton asymmetry can be constrained by CP\nphase in this minimal model.\n", "  We report on the tornado-like evolution of a quiescent prominence on 2014\nNovember 1. The eastern section of the prominence first rose slowly\ntransforming into an arch-shaped structure as high as ~150 Mm above the limb;\nthe arch then writhed moderately in a left-handed sense, while the originally\ndark prominence material became in emission in the Fe IX 171~{\\AA} passband,\nand a braided structure appeared at the eastern edge of the warped arch. The\nunraveling of the braided structure was associated with a transient brightening\nin EUV and apparently contributed to the formation of a curtain-like structure\n(CLS). The CLS consisted of myriads of thread-like loops rotating\ncounterclockwise about the vertical if viewed from above. Heated prominence\nmaterial was observed to slide along these loops and land outside the filament\nchannel. The tornado was eventually disintegrated and the remaining material\nflew along a left-handed helical path of approximately a full turn, as\ncorroborated through stereoscopic reconstruction, into the cavity of the\nstable, western section of the prominence. We suggest that the tornado-like\nevolution of the prominence was governed by the helical kink instability, and\nthat the CLS formed through magnetic reconnections between the prominence field\nand the overlying coronal field.\n", "  Observationally, a massive disk galaxy can harbor a bulge component that is\ncomparably inactive as a quiescent galaxy (QG). It has been speculated that the\nquenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why\nthe star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In\nthis paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of\nSFGs ($f_{\\rm Q}$) at fixed stellar mass ($M_{\\ast}$) and to reconcile the MS\nslopes both in the low and the high mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is\ncomposed by a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the\nstar-forming component ($M_{\\rm SF}$) correlates with the star formation rate\n(SFR) following a relation SFR $\\propto M_{\\rm SF}^{\\alpha_{\\rm SF}}$, where\n$\\alpha_{\\rm SF}\\sim 1.0$ . The quenched component contributes to the stellar\nmass but does not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify $f_{\\rm Q}$ based\non the departure of the observed MS slope $\\alpha$ from $\\alpha_{\\rm SF}$.\nAdopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by \\citet{Whitaker 2014}, we\nexplore the evolution of the $f_{\\rm Q}-M_{\\ast}$ relations over $z=[0.5,2.5]$.\nWe find that Milky-Way mass SFGs (with $M_{\\ast}\\approx 10^{10.7}M_{\\odot}$)\ntypically have a $f_{\\rm Q}=30\\%-40\\%$ at $z\\sim 2.25$, whereas this value\nrapidly rises up to $70\\%-80\\%$ at $z\\sim 0.75$. The origin of an $\\alpha\\sim\n1.0$ MS slope seen in the low mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a\nscenario in which the majority of low mass SFGs stay in a \"steady-stage\" star\nformation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback\nand not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus keeping\nroughly constant over cosmic time. This scenario successfully produces an\n$\\alpha \\sim 1.0$ MS slope, as well as the observed MS evolution from $z=2.5$\nto $z=0$ at low masses.\n", "  We report a magnetotransport study of an ultra-high mobility\n($\\bar{\\mu}\\approx 25\\times 10^6$\\,cm$^2$\\,V$^{-1}$\\,s$^{-1}$) $n$-type GaAs\nquantum well up to 33 T. A strong linear magnetoresistance (LMR) of the order\nof 10$^5$ % is observed in a wide temperature range between 0.3 K and 60 K. The\nsimplicity of our material system with a single sub-band occupation and free\nelectron dispersion rules out most complicated mechanisms that could give rise\nto the observed LMR. At low temperature, quantum oscillations are superimposed\nonto the LMR. Both, the featureless LMR at high $T$ and the quantum\noscillations at low $T$ follow the empirical resistance rule which states that\nthe longitudinal conductance is directly related to the derivative of the\ntransversal (Hall) conductance multiplied by the magnetic field and a constant\nfactor $\\alpha$ that remains unchanged over the entire temperature range. Only\nat low temperatures, small deviations from this resistance rule are observed\nbeyond $\\nu=1$ that likely originate from a different transport mechanism for\nthe composite fermions.\n", "  We study pore nucleation in a model membrane system, a freestanding polymer\nfilm. Nucleated pores smaller than a critical size close, while pores larger\nthan the critical size grow. Holes of varying size were purposefully prepared\nin liquid polymer films, and their evolution in time was monitored using\noptical and atomic force microscopy to extract a critical radius. The critical\nradius scales linearly with film thickness for a homopolymer film. The results\nagree with a simple model which takes into account the energy cost due to\nsurface area at the edge of the pore. The energy cost at the edge of the pore\nis experimentally varied by using a lamellar-forming diblock copolymer\nmembrane. The underlying molecular architecture causes increased frustration at\nthe pore edge resulting in an enhanced cost of pore formation.\n", "  DXL (Diffuse X-rays from the Local Galaxy) is a sounding rocket mission\ndesigned to quantify and characterize the contribution of Solar Wind Charge\neXchange (SWCX) to the Diffuse X-ray Background and study the properties of the\nLocal Hot Bubble (LHB). Based on the results from the DXL mission, we\nquantified and removed the contribution of SWCX to the diffuse X-ray background\nmeasured by the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS). The \"cleaned\" maps were used to\ninvestigate the physical properties of the LHB. Assuming thermal ionization\nequilibrium, we measured a highly uniform temperature distributed around\nkT=0.097 keV+/-0.013 keV (FWHM)+/-0.006 keV (systematic). We also generated a\nthermal emission measure map and used it to characterize the three-dimensional\n(3D) structure of the LHB which we found to be in good agreement with the\nstructure of the local cavity measured from dust and gas.\n", "  The quasilinear intrinsic parallel flow drive including parallel residual\nstress, kinetic stress, cross Maxwell stress and parallel turbulent\nacceleration by electromagnetic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence is\ncalculated analytically using electromagnetic gyrokinetic theory. Both the\nkinetic stress and cross Maxwell stress also enter the mean parallel flow\nvelocity equation via their divergence, as for the usual residual stress. The\nturbulent acceleration driven by ion pressure gradient along the total magnetic\nfield (including equilibrium magnetic field and fluctuating radial magnetic\nfield) cannot be written as a divergence of stress, and so should be treated as\na local source/sink. All these terms can provide intrinsic parallel rotation\ndrive. Electromagnetic effects reduce the non-resonant electrostatic stress\nforce and even reverse it, but enhance the resonant stress force. Both the\nnon-resonant and resonant turbulent acceleration terms are also enhanced by\nelectromagnetic effects. The possible implications of our results for\nexperimental observations are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the stochastic dynamics of an active particle moving at a\nconstant speed under the influence of a fluctuating torque. In our model the\nangular velocity is generated by a constant torque and random fluctuations\ndescribed as a L\\'evy-stable noise. Two situations are investigated. First, we\nstudy white L\\'evy noise where the constant speed and the angular noise\ngenerate a persistent motion characterized by the persistence time $\\tau_D$. At\nthis time scale the crossover from ballistic to normal diffusive behavior is\nobserved. The corresponding diffusion coefficient can be obtained analytically\nfor the whole class of symmetric $\\alpha$-stable noises. As typical for models\nwith noise-driven angular dynamics, the diffusion coefficient depends\nnon-monotonously on the angular noise intensity. As second example, we study\nangular noise as described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with correlation\ntime $\\tau_c$ driven by the Cauchy white noise. We discuss the asymptotic\ndiffusive properties of this model and obtain the same analytical expression\nfor the diffusion coefficient as in the first case which is thus independent on\n$\\tau_c$. Remarkably, for $\\tau_c>\\tau_D$ the crossover from a non-Gaussian to\na Gaussian distribution of displacements takes place at a time $\\tau_G$ which\ncan be considerably larger than the persistence time $\\tau_D$.\n", "  Obtaining a reduced description with particle and momentum flux densities\noutgoing from the microscopic equations of motion of the particles requires\napproximations. The usual method, we refer to as truncation method, is to zero\nFourier modes of the orientation distribution starting from a given number.\nHere we propose another method to derive continuum equations for interacting\nself-propelled particles. The derivation is based on a Gaussian approximation\n(GA) of the distribution of the direction of particles. First, by means of\nsimulation of the microscopic model we justify that the distribution of\nindividual directions fits well to a wrapped Gaussian distribution. Second, we\nnumerically integrate the continuum equations derived in the GA in order to\ncompare with results of simulations. We obtain that the global polarization in\nthe GA exhibits a hysteresis in dependence on the noise intensity. It shows\nqualitatively the same behavior as we find in particles simulations. Moreover,\nboth global polarizations agree perfectly for low noise intensities. The\nspatio-temporal structures of the GA are also in agreement with simulations. We\nconclude that the GA shows qualitative agreement for a wide range of noise\nintensities. In particular, for low noise intensities the agreement with\nsimulations is better as other approximations, making the GA to an acceptable\ncandidates of describing spatially distributed self-propelled particles.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional Kasteleyn transition in both nearest\nneighbours and dipolar spin ice models using an algorithm that conserves the\nnumber of excitations. We first limit the interactions range to nearest\nneighbours to test the method in the presence of a field applied along $[100]$,\nand then focus on the dipolar spin ice model. The effect of dipolar\ninteractions, which is known to be greatly self screened at zero field, is\nparticularly strong near full polarization. It shifts the Kasteleyn transition\nto lower temperatures, which decreases $\\approx 0.4 K$ for the parameters\ncorresponding to the best known spin ice materials, $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$ and\n$Ho_2Ti_2O_7$. This shift implies effective dipolar fields as big as $0.05$\ntesla opposing the applied field, and thus favoring the creation of \"strings\"\nof reversed spins. We compare the reduction in the transition temperature with\nresults in previous experiments, and study the phenomenon quantitatively using\na simple molecular field approach. Finally, we relate the presence of the\neffective residual field to the appearance of string-ordered phases at low\nfields and temperatures, and we check numerically that for fields applied along\n$[100]$ there are only three different stable phases at zero temperature.\n", "  The existence of higher than pairwise quantum interference in the set-up, in\nwhich there are more than two slits, is currently under experimental\ninvestigation. However, it is still unclear what the confirmation of existence\nof such interference would mean for quantum theory -- whether that usual\nquantum mechanics is merely a limiting case of some more general theory or\nwhether that some assumption of quantum theory taken as a fundamental one does\nnot actually hold true. The present paper tries to understand why quantum\ntheory is limited only to a certain kind of interference.\n", "  Galaxies of rare morphology are of paramount scientific interest, as they\ncarry important information about the past, present, and future universe. Once\na rare galaxy is identified, studying it more effectively requires a set of\ngalaxies of similar morphology, allowing generalization and statistical\nanalysis that cannot be done when $N=1$. Databases generated by digital sky\nsurveys can contain a very large number of galaxy images, and therefore once a\nrare galaxy of interest is identified it is possible that more instances of the\nsame morphology are also present in the database. However, when a researcher\nidentifies a certain galaxy of rare morphology in the database, it is virtually\nimpossible to mine the database manually in the search for galaxies of similar\nmorphology. Here we propose a computer method that can automatically search\ndatabases of galaxy images and identify galaxies that are morphologically\nsimilar to a certain user-defined query galaxy. That is, the researcher\nprovides an image of a galaxy of interest, and the pattern recognition system\nautomatically returns a list of galaxies that are visually similar to the\ntarget galaxy. The algorithm uses a comprehensive set of descriptors, allowing\nit to support different types of galaxies, and it is not limited to a finite\nset of known morphology. While the list of returned galaxies is neither clean\nnor complete, it contains a far higher frequency of galaxies of the morphology\nof interest, providing a substantial reduction of the data. Such algorithms can\nbe integrated into data management systems of autonomous digital sky surveys\nsuch as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), where the number of\ngalaxies in the database is extremely large. The source code of the method is\navailable at http://vfacstaff.ltu.edu/lshamir/downloads/udat.\n", "  We present a self-consistent theory for odd nuclei with exact blocking and\nparticle number and angular momentum projection. The demanding treatment of the\npairing correlations in a variation-after-projection approach as well as the\nexplicit consideration of the triaxial deformation parameters in a projection\nafter variation method, together with the use of the finite-range\ndensity-dependent Gogny force, provides an excellent tool for the description\nof odd-even and even-even nuclei. We apply the theory to the Magnesium isotopic\nchain and obtain an outstanding description of the ground-state properties, in\nparticular binding energies, odd-even mass differences, mass radii and\nelectromagnetic moments among others.\n", "  We present the results of high-resolution valence-band photoemission\nspectroscopic study of SmB6 which shows evidence for a V-shaped density of\nstates of surface origin within the bulk gap. The spectroscopy data is\ninterpreted in terms of the existence of heavy 4f surface states, which may be\nuseful in resolving the controversy concerning the disparate surface\nFermi-surface velocities observed in experiments. Most importantly, we find\nthat the temperature dependence of the valence-band spectrum indicates that a\nsmall feature appears at a binding energy of about -9 meV at low temperatures.\nWe attribute this feature to a resonance caused by the spin-exciton scattering\nin SmB6 which destroys the protection of surface states due to time-reversal\ninvariance and spin-momentum locking. The existence of a low-energy\nspin-exciton may be responsible for the scattering which suppresses the\nformation of coherent surface quasi-particles and the appearance of the\nsaturation of the resistivity to temperatures much lower than the coherence\ntemperature associated with the opening of the bulk gap.\n", "  Superconducting flux qubits are a promising candidate for realizing quantum\ninformation processing and quantum simulations. Such devices behave like\nartificial atoms, with the advantage that one can easily tune the \"atoms\"\ninternal properties. Here, by harnessing this flexibility, we propose a\ntechnique to minimize the inhomogeneous broadening of a large ensemble of flux\nqubits by tuning only the external flux. In addition, as an example of\nmany-body physics in such an ensemble, we show how to observe superradiance,\nand its quadratic scaling with ensemble size, using a tailored microwave\ncontrol pulse that takes advantage of the inhomogeneous broadening itself to\nexcite only a sub-ensemble of the qubits. Our scheme opens up an approach to\nusing superconducting circuits to explore the properties of quantum many-body\nsystems.\n", "  The coherent interaction of light with matter imprints the phase information\nof the light field on the wavefunction of the photon-dressed electronic state.\nDriving electric field, together with a stable phase that is associated with\nthe optical probe pulses, enables the role of the dressed state in the optical\nresponse to be investigated. We observed optical absorption strengths modulated\non a sub-cycle timescale in a GaAs quantum well in the presence of a\nmulti-cycle terahertz driving pulse using a near-infrared probe pulse. The\nmeasurements were in good agreement with the analytical formula that accounts\nfor the optical susceptibilities caused by the dressed state of excitons, which\nindicates that the output probe intensity was coherently reshaped by the\nexcitonic sideband emissions.\n", "  Recently it has been found that models of massive stars reach the Eddington\nlimit in their interior, which leads to dilute extended envelopes. We perform a\ncomparative study of the envelope properties of massive stars at different\nmetallicities, with the aim to establish the impact of the stellar metallicity\non the effect of envelope inflation. We analyse published grids of\ncore-hydrogen burning massive star models computed with metallicities\nappropriate for massive stars in the Milky Way, the LMC and the SMC, the very\nmetal poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, and for metal-free chemical composition.\nStellar models of all the investigated metallicities reach and exceed the\nEddington limit in their interior, aided by the opacity peaks of iron, helium\nand hydrogen, and consequently develop inflated envelopes. Envelope inflation\nleads to a redward bending of the zero-age main sequence and a broadening of\nthe main sequence band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We\nderive the limiting L/M-values as function of the stellar surface temperature\nabove which inflation occurs, and find them to be larger for lower metallicity.\nWhile Galactic models show inflation above ~29 Msun, the corresponding mass\nlimit for Population III stars is ~150 Msun. While the masses of the inflated\nenvelopes are generally small, we find that they can reach 1-100 Msun in models\nwith effective temperatures below ~8000 K, with higher masses reached by models\nof lower metallicity. Envelope inflation is expected to occur in sufficiently\nmassive stars at all metallicities, and is expected to lead to rapidly growing\npulsations, high macroturbulent velocities, and might well be related to the\nunexplained variability observed in Luminous Blue Variables like S Doradus and\nEta Carina.\n", "  We present recent optical photometric observations of the blazar OJ 287 taken\nduring September 2015 -- May 2016. Our intense observations of the blazar\nstarted in November 2015 and continued until May 2016 and included detection of\nthe large optical outburst in December 2016 that was predicted using the binary\nblack hole model for OJ 287. For our observing campaign, we used a total of 9\nground based optical telescopes of which one is in Japan, one is in India,\nthree are in Bulgaria, one is in Serbia, one is in Georgia, and two are in the\nUSA. These observations were carried out in 102 nights with a total of ~ 1000\nimage frames in BVRI bands, though the majority were in the R band. We detected\na second comparably strong flare in March 2016. In addition, we investigated\nmulti-band flux variations, colour variations, and spectral changes in the\nblazar on diverse timescales as they are useful in understanding the emission\nmechanisms. We briefly discuss the possible physical mechanisms most likely\nresponsible for the observed flux, colour and spectral variability.\n", "  We study superdense coding with uniformly accelerated particle in single mode\napproximation and beyond single mode approximation. We use four different\nfunctions, the capacity of superdense coding, negativity, discord and the\nprobability of success for evaluating the final results. In single mode\napproximation, all the four functions behave as expected, however in beyond\nsingle mode approximation, except the probability of success, the other three\nfunctions represent peculiar behaviors at least for special ranges where the\nbeyond single mode approximation is strong.\n", "  b to s transitions are flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes that\nplay an important role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model\n(SM). Contributions from virtual particles in the loop are predicted to deviate\nobservables, such as the branching fraction, from their SM expectations. Using\ndata from the BaBar experiment, we present the first search for the rare decay\nB to K tau tau. The BABAR results on the measurement of the angular asymmetries\nof B to Kstar l l, where l is an electron or muon, are also reported. In\naddition, using a time-dependent analysis of B to KS0 pi pi gamma, the mixing\ninduced CP-asymmetry for the radiative FCNC decay, B to KS0 rho gamma, is\nmeasured, along with an amplitude analysis of the m (K pi) and m (K pi pi)\nspectrum.\n", "  Recent theoretical work has shown that spin $1/2$ particles moving through\nunpolarized matter which sources torsion fields experience a new type of\nparity-even and time-reversal-odd optical potential if the matter is spinning\nin the lab frame. This new type of optical potential can be sought\nexperimentally using the helicity dependence of the total cross sections for\nlongitudinally polarized neutrons moving through a rotating cylindrical target.\nIn combination with recent experimental constraints on short-range P--odd,\nT--even torsion interactions derived from polarized neutron spin rotation in\nmatter one can derive separate constraints on the time components of scalar and\npseudoscalar torsion fields in matter. We estimate the sensitivity achievable\nin such an experiment and briefly outline some of the potential sources of\nsystematic error to be considered in any future experimental search for this\neffect.\n", "  IGR J00291+5934 is the fastest-known accretion-powered X-ray pulsar,\ndiscovered during a transient outburst in 2004. In this paper, we report on\nIntegral and Swift observations during the 2015 outburst, which lasts for\n$\\sim25$ d. The source has not been observed in outburst since 2008, suggesting\nthat the long-term accretion rate has decreased by a factor of two since\ndiscovery. The averaged broad-band (0.1 - 250 keV) persistent spectrum in 2015\nis well described by a thermal Comptonization model with a column density of\n$N_{\\rm H} \\approx4\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a plasma temperature of $kT_{\\rm\ne} \\approx50$ keV, and a Thomson optical depth of $\\tau_{\\rm T}\\approx1$.\nPulsations at the known spin period of the source are detected in the Integral\ndata up to the $\\sim150$ keV energy band. We also report on the discovery of\nthe first thermonuclear burst observed from IGR J00291+5934, which lasts around\n7 min and occurs at a persistent emission level corresponding to roughly\n$1.6\\%$ of the Eddington accretion rate. The properties of the burst suggest it\nis powered primarily by helium ignited at a depth of $y_{\\rm\nign}\\approx1.5\\times10^9$ g cm$^{-2}$ following the exhaustion by steady\nburning of the accreted hydrogen. The Swift/BAT data from the first $\\sim20$ s\nof the burst provide indications of a photospheric radius expansion phase.\nAssuming this is the case, we infer a source distance of $d = 4.2 \\pm 0.3$ kpc.\n", "  Recent work on the revised Gratton-Vargas model has demonstrated that there\nare some aspects of Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) which are not sensitive to details\nof plasma dynamics and are well captured in an oversimplified model assumption\nwhich contains very little plasma physics. A hyperbolic conservation law\nformulation of DPF physics reveals the existence of a velocity threshold\nrelated to specific energy of dissociation and ionization, above which, the\nwork done during shock propagation is adequate to ensure dissociation and\nionization of the gas being ingested. These developments are utilized to\nformulate an algorithmic definition of DPF optimization that is valid in a wide\nrange of applications, not limited to neutron emission. A universal scaling\ntheory of DPF design optimization is proposed and illustrated for designing\ndevices working at one or two orders higher pressure of deuterium than the\ncurrent practice of designs optimized at pressures less than 10 mbar of\ndeuterium. These examples show that the upper limit for operating pressure is\nof technological (and not physical) origin.\n", "  Whether in the thermodynamic limit, vanishing magnetic field $h\\rightarrow\n0$, and nonzero temperature the spin stiffness of the spin-$1/2$ $XXX$\nHeisenberg chain is finite or vanishes within the grand-canonical ensemble\nremains an unsolved and controversial issue, as different approaches yield\ncontradictory results. Here we provide an upper bound on the stiffness and show\nthat within that ensemble it vanishes for $h\\rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic\nlimit of chain length $L\\to\\infty$, at high temperatures $T\\rightarrow\\infty$.\nOur approach uses a representation in terms of the $L$ physical spins $1/2$.\nFor all configurations that generate the exact spin-$S$ energy and momentum\neigenstates such a configuration involves a number $2S$ of unpaired spins $1/2$\nin multiplet configurations and $L-2S$ spins $1/2$ that are paired within\n$M_{\\rm sp}=L/2-S$ spin-singlet pairs. The Bethe-ansatz strings of length $n=1$\nand $n>1$ describe a single unbound spin-singlet pair and a configuration\nwithin which $n$ pairs are bound, respectively. In the case of $n>1$ pairs this\nholds both for ideal and deformed strings associated with $n$ complex\nrapidities with the same real part. The use of such a spin $1/2$ representation\nprovides useful physical information on the problem under investigation in\ncontrast to often less controllable numerical studies. Our results provide\nstrong evidence for the absence of ballistic transport in the spin-$1/2$ $XXX$\nHeisenberg chain in the thermodynamic limit, for high temperatures\n$T\\to\\infty$, vanishing magnetic field $h\\rightarrow 0$ and within the\ngrand-canonical ensemble.\n", "  We revisit the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation of low- and\nhigh-redshift galaxies by using a sample of local analogs of high-redshift\ngalaxies. These analogs share the same location of the UV-selected star-forming\ngalaxies at $z\\sim2$ on the [OIII]/H$\\beta$ versus [NII]/H$\\alpha$ nebular\nemission-line diagnostic (or BPT) diagram. Their physical properties closely\nresemble those in $z\\sim2$ UV-selected star-forming galaxies being\ncharacterized in particular by high ionization parameters ($\\log q\\approx7.9$)\nand high electron densities ($n_e\\approx100~\\rm{cm}^{-3}$). With the full set\nof well-detected rest-frame optical diagnostic lines, we measure the gas-phase\noxygen abundance in the SDSS galaxies and these local analogs using the\nempirical relations and the photoionization models. We find that the\nmetallicity difference between the SDSS galaxies and our local analogs in the\n$8.5<log(M_*/M_{\\odot})<9.0$ stellar mass bin varies from -0.09 to 0.39 dex,\ndepending on strong-line metallicity measurement methods. Due to this\ndiscrepancy the evolution of mass-metallicity should be used to compare with\nthe cosmological simulations with caution. We use the [SII]/H$\\alpha$ and\n[OI]/H$\\alpha$ BPT diagram to reduce the potential AGN and shock contamination\nin our local analogs. We find that the AGN/shock influences are negligible on\nthe metallicity estimation.\n", "  Recent observations of the microwave sky, by the space telescopes such as\nWMAP and Planck, have opened a new window into the analysis of continuum\nemission from supernova remnants (SNRs). In this paper, different emission\nmodels that can explain the characteristic shape of presently known integrated\nradio/microwave continuum spectrum of the Galactic SNR IC 443 are tested and\ndiscussed. In particular, the possibility that the slight bump in the\nintegrated continuum of this remnant around 20 -- 70~GHz is genuine and that\ncan be explained by the contribution of additional emission mechanism such as\nof spinning dust is emphasized. We find that adding a spinning dust component\nto the emission model improves the fit of the integrated spectrum of this SNR\nwhile, at the same time preserves the physically probable parameter values.\nFinally, models that include the high-frequency synchrotron bending of the IC\n443 radio to microwave continuum are favored.\n", "  The role of defects in van der Waals heterostructures made of graphene and\nhexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is studied by a combination of ab initio and\nmodel calculations. Despite the weak van der Waals interaction between layers,\ndefects residing in h-BN, such as carbon impurities and antisite defects,\nreveal a hybridization with graphene p$_{\\rm z}$ states, leading to midgap\nstate formation. The induced midgap states modify the transport properties of\ngraphene and can be reproduced by means of a simple effective tight-binding\nmodel. In contrast to carbon defects, it is found that oxygen defects do not\nstrongly hybridize with graphene's low-energy states. Instead, oxygen\ndrastically modifies the band gap of graphene, which emerges in a commensurate\nstacking on h-BN lattices.\n", "  Pattern-forming processes, such as electrodeposition, dielectric breakdown or\nviscous fingering are often driven by instabilities. Accordingly, the resulting\ngrowth patterns are usually highly branched, fractal structures. However, in\nsome of the unstable growth processes the envelope of the structure grows in a\nhighly regular manner, with the perturbations smoothed out over the course of\ntime. In this paper, we show that the regularity of the envelope growth can be\nconnected to small-scale instabilities leading to the tip splitting of the\nfingers at the advancing front of the structure. Whenever the growth velocity\nbecomes too large, the finger splits into two branches. In this way it can\nabsorb an increased flux and thus damp the instability. Hence, somewhat\ncounterintuitively, the instability at a small scale results in a stability at\na larger scale. The quantitative analysis of these effects is provided by means\nof the Loewner equation, which one can use to reduce the problem of the\ninterface motion to that of the evolution of the conformal mapping onto the\ncomplex plane. This allows an effective analysis of the multifingered growth in\na variety of different geometries. We show how the geometry impacts the shape\nof the envelope of the growing pattern and compare the results with those\nobserved in natural systems.\n", "  The carrier emission efficiency of light emitting diodes is of fundamental\nimportance for many technological applications, including the performance of\nGaN and other semiconductor photocathodes. We have measured the evolution of\nthe emitted carriers and the associated transient electric field after\nfemtosecond laser excitation of n-type GaN single crystals. These processes\nwere studied using subpicosecond, ultrashort, electron pulses and explained by\nmeans of a three-layer analytical model. We find that for pump laser\nintensities on the order of 10^11 W/cm^2, the electrons that escaped from the\ncrystal surface have a charge of about 2.7 pc and a velocity of about 1.8\num/ps. The associated transient electrical field evolves at intervals ranging\nfrom picoseconds to nanoseconds. These results provide a dynamic perspective on\nthe photoemission properties of semiconductor photocathodes.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that are multiply imaged by gravitational lensing\ncan extend the SN Ia Hubble diagram to very high redshifts $(z\\gtrsim 2)$,\nprobe potential SN Ia evolution, and deliver high-precision constraints on\n$H_0$, $w$, and $\\Omega_m$ via time delays. However, only one, iPTF16geu, has\nbeen found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To\nincrease the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple\nalgorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced,\nwide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae\nthat appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute\nmagnitudes implied by the apparent hosts' photometric redshifts that are far\nbrighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal SNe Ia (the brightest type of\nsupernovae found in elliptical galaxies). Importantly, this purely photometric\nmethod does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images for discovery.\nAGN, the primary sources of contamination that affect the method, can be\ncontrolled using catalog cross-matches and color cuts. Highly magnified\ncore-collapse supernovae will also be discovered as a byproduct of the method.\nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast that LSST can discover up to 500\nmultiply imaged SNe Ia using this technique in a 10-year $z$-band search, more\nthan an order of magnitude improvement over previous estimates (Oguri &\nMarshall 2010). We also predict that ZTF should find up to 10 multiply imaged\nSNe Ia using this technique in a 3-year $R$-band search---despite the fact that\nthis survey will not resolve a single system.\n", "  We perform a study of domain walls in Co/Ir$_n$/Pt(111) (n = 0,1,...,6) films\nby a combined approach of first-principles calculations and spin dynamics\nsimulations. We determine the tensorial exchange interactions and the magnetic\nanisotropies for the Co overlayer in both FCC and HCP geometries, depending on\nthe number of Ir buffer layers. We find strong ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor\nisotropic exchange interactions between the Co atoms and an out-of-plane\nmagnetic anisotropy for the films in FCC geometry. Our simulations show that\nthe magnetic domain walls are of N\\'eel type, and their rotational sense\n(chirality) is changed upon the insertion of an Ir buffer layer as compared to\nthe pristine Co/Pt(111) system. Our spin dynamics simulations indicate a\ntwisting of the spins with respect to the planar domain wall profile on the\ntriangular lattice. We discuss this domain wall twisting using symmetry\narguments and in terms of an appropriate micromagnetic continuum model\nconsidering extra energy terms compared to the available literature.\n", "  We employ ptychography, a phase-retrieval imaging technique, to show\nexperimentally for the first time that a partially coherent high-energy matter\n(electron) wave emanating from an extended source can be decomposed into a set\nof mutually independent modes of minimal rank. Partial coherence significantly\ndetermines the optical transfer properties of an electron microscope and so\nthere has been much work on this subject. However, previous studies have\nemployed forms of interferometry to determine spatial coherence between\ndiscrete points in the wavefield. Here we use the density matrix to derive a\nformal quantum mechanical description of electron ptychography and use it to\nmeasure a full description of the spatial coherence of a propagating matter\nwavefield, at least to the within the fundamental uncertainties of the\nmeasurements we can obtain.\n", "  Neutron interferometry enables precision measurements that are typically\noperated within elaborate, multi-layered facilities which provide substantial\nshielding from environmental noise. These facilities are necessary to maintain\nthe coherence requirements in a perfect crystal neutron interferometer which is\nextremely sensitive to local environmental conditions such as temperature\ngradients across the interferometer, external vibrations, and acoustic waves.\nThe ease of operation and breadth of applications of perfect crystal neutron\ninterferometry would greatly benefit from a mode of operation which relaxes\nthese stringent isolation requirements. Here, the INDEX Collaboration and\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology demonstrates the functionality\nof a neutron interferometer in vacuum and characterize the use of a compact\nvacuum chamber enclosure as a means to isolate the interferometer from spatial\ntemperature gradients and time-dependent temperature fluctuations. The vacuum\nchamber is found to have no depreciable effect on the performance of the\ninterferometer (contrast) while improving system stability, thereby showing\nthat it is feasible to replace large temperature isolation and control systems\nwith a compact vacuum enclosure for perfect crystal neutron interferometry.\n", "  We report a Raman study of the effect of temperature on the self-energies of\noptical phonons in a number of transition metals with hexagonal-close-packed\nstructure. Anisotropic softening of phonon energies and narrowing of phonon\nlinewidths with increasing temperature are observed. These effects are\nreproduced in the calculations of phonon spectral functions based on \\textit{ab\ninitio} electronic structures and with carrier scattering by phonons taken into\naccount. The combined observations and results of simulations indicate a\nrelation between observed anomalies and the renormalization of the electron\nspectrum due to electron-phonon interaction. It is emphasized that the\ntemperature dependence of the phonon energies resembles anharmonic behavior but\nis actually an electron-induced effect.\n", "  We calculate and present an analytic form of the magneto-optical conductivity\nfor the gapped low-energy Kane model in two and three dimensions separately.\nThe two-dimensional case maps onto the $\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ model at a\nparticular value of $\\alpha=1/\\sqrt{3}$. In two dimensions, two chiral sectors\nexist, between which there are no optically activated transitions. In three\ndimensions, the extra dimension of dispersion mixes the two sectors so that\nintra- and inter-sector transitions can occur. The latter type of transition\ncan be separated out via circular polarizations of light and shows a distinct\nsignature in the transverse conductivity.\n", "  It has been recently claimed (Zolotova and Ponyavin, Solar Phys., 291, 2869,\n2016, ZP16 henceforth) that a mid-latitude optical phenomenon, which took place\nover the city of Astrakhan in July 1670, according to Russian chronicles, was a\nstrong aurora borealis. If this was true, it would imply a very strong or even\nsevere geomagnetic storm during the quietest part of the Maunder minimum.\nHowever, as we argue in this article, this conclusion is erroneous and caused\nby a misinterpretation of the chronicle record. As a result of a thorough\nanalysis of the chronicle text, we show that the described phenomenon occurred\nduring the daylight period of the day (\"the last morning hour\"), in the south\ndirection (\"towards noon\"), and its description does not match that of an\naurora. The date of the event was also incorrectly interpreted. We conclude\nthat this phenomenon was not a mid-latitude aurora but an atmospheric\nphenomenon, the so-called sundog (or parhelion) which is a particular type of\nsolar halo. Accordingly, the claim about a strong mid-latitude aurora during\nthe deep Maunder minimum is not correct and should be dismissed.\n", "  In this paper we study some classes of $\\alpha$-attractors models in the\nJordan frame and we find the corresponding $F(R)$ gravity theory. We study\nanalytically the problem at leading order and we investigate whether the\nattractor picture persists in the $F(R)$ gravity equivalent theory. As we show,\nif the slow-roll conditions are assumed in the Jordan frame, the spectral index\nof primordial curvature perturbations and the scalar-to-tensor ratio are\nidentical to the corresponding observational indices of the $R^2$ model, a\nresult which indicates that the attractor property is also found in the\ncorresponding $F(R)$ gravity theories of the $\\alpha$-attractors models.\nMoreover, implicit and approximate forms of the $F(R)$ gravity inflationary\nattractors are found.\n", "  We investigate numerically the Princeton magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nexperiment and the effect of conducting axial boundaries or endcaps. MRI is\nidentified and found to reach a much higher saturation than for insulating\nendcaps. This is probably due to stronger driving of the base flow by the\nmagnetically rather than viscously coupled boundaries. Although the\ncomputations are necessarily limited to lower Reynolds numbers ($\\Re$) than\ntheir experimental counterparts, it appears that the saturation level becomes\nindependent of $\\Re$ when $\\Re$ is sufficiently large, whereas it has been\nfound previously to decrease roughly as $\\Re^{-1/4}$ with insulating endcaps.\nThe much higher saturation levels will allow for the first positive detection\nof MRI beyond its theoretical and numerical predictions.\n", "  The last stage of evolution toward the stationary Kolmogorov spectrum of\nhydrodynamic turbulence is studied using the Leith model. This evolution is\nshown to manifest itself as a reflection wave in the wavenumber space\npropagating from the largest toward the smallest wavenumbers, and is described\nby a self-similar solution of a new (third) kind. This stage follows the\npreviously studied stage of an initial explosive propagation of the spectral\nfront from the smallest to the largest wavenumbers reaching arbitrarily large\nwavenumbers in a finite time, and which was described by a self-similar\nsolution of the second kind. Nonstationary solutions corresponding to\"warm\ncascades\" characterised by a thermalised spectrum at large wavenumbers are also\nobtained.\n", "  A tiny adiabatic-demagnetization refrigerator (T-ADR) has been developed for\na commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer [Magnetic\nProperty Measurement System (MPMS) from Quantum Design]. The whole T-ADR system\nis fit in a cylindrical space of the diameter $8.5$ mm and the length $250$ mm,\nand can be inserted into the narrow sample tube of MPMS. A sorption pump is\nself-contained in T-ADR, and hence no complex gas handling system is necessary.\nWith the single crystalline Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ garnet ($\\sim 2$ grams) used\nas a magnetic refrigerant, the routinely achievable lowest temperature is $\\sim\n0.56$ K. The lower detection limit for a magnetization anomaly is $\\sim 1\n\\times 10^{-7}$ emu, estimated from fluctuation of the measured magnetization.\nThe background level is $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-5}$ emu below 2 K at $H = 100$ Oe,\nwhich is largely attributable to a contaminating paramagnetic signal from the\nmagnetic refrigerant.\n", "  The origin and evolution of magnetism in OB stars is far from being well\nunderstood. With approximately 70 magnetic OB stars known, any new object with\nunusual characteristics may turn out to be a key piece of the puzzle. We report\nthe detection of an exceptionally strong magnetic field in the He-strong B2IV\nstar CPD-62 2124. Spectropolarimetric FORS2 and HARPSpol observations were\nanalysed by two independent teams and procedures, concluding on a strong\nlongitudinal magnetic field of approximately 5.2 kG. The quantitative\ncharacterisation of the stellar atmosphere yields an effective temperature of\n23650$\\pm$250 K, a surface gravity of 3.95$\\pm$0.10 dex and a surface helium\nfraction of 0.35$\\pm$0.02 by number. The metal composition is in agreement with\nthe cosmic abundance standard, except for Mg, Si and S, which are slightly\nnon-solar. The strong and broad ($\\sim$300 km/s) disc-like emission displayed\nby the H$\\alpha$ line suggests a centrifugal magnetosphere supported by the\nstrong magnetic field. Our results imply that CPD-62 2124 is an early B-type\nstar hosting one of the strongest magnetic fields discovered to date, and one\nof the most evolved He-strong stars known, with a fractional main-sequence\nlifetime of approximately 0.6.\n", "  The generalized entropy theory (GET) offers many insights into how molecular\nparameters influence polymer glass-formation. Given the fact that chain\nrigidity often plays a critical role in understanding the glass-formation of\npolymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of\nsemiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET\nconsidered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected\nresults from computer simulations of fully flexible polymer melts concerning\nthe dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive\ninteraction strength ($\\epsilon$), the present paper employs the GET to explore\nthe influence of $\\epsilon$ on glass-formation in models of polymer melts with\na vanishing bending rigidity, i.e., fully flexible polymer melts. In accord\nwith simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts predicts that basic\ndimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion\ncoefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the\ntemperature scaled by $\\epsilon$ in the regime of low pressures. Similar\nscaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the\nGET for fully flexible polymer melts. Moreover, we find that the characteristic\ntemperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with $\\epsilon$ and that the\nfragility is independent of $\\epsilon$ in fully flexible polymer melts,\npredictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming polymer\nmelts composed of fully flexible chains. Beyond an explanation of these general\ntrends observed in simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts\npredicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low\ntemperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low\ntemperature glassy state.\n", "  \"Diagonal\" spatially inhomogeneous (SI) models are introduced under the\nassumption of the existence of (proper) intrinsic symmetries and can be seen,\nin some sense, complementary to the Szekeres models. The structure of this\nclass of spacetimes can be regarded as a generalization of the (twist-free)\nLocally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) geometries without any global isometry\ncontaining, however, these models as special cases. We consider geometries\nwhere a six-dimensional algebra $\\mathcal{IC}$ of Intrinsic Conformal Vector\nFields (ICVFs) exists acting on a $2-$dimensional (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold.\nIts members $\\mathbf{X}_{\\alpha }$, constituted of 3 Intrinsic Killing Vector\nFields (IKVFs) and 3 \\emph{proper} and \\emph{gradient} ICVFs, as well as the\nspecific form of the gravitational field are given explicitly. An interesting\nconsequence, in contrast with the Szekeres models, is the immediate existence\nof \\emph{conserved quantities along null geodesics}. We check computationally\nthat the magnetic part $H_{ab}$ of the Weyl tensor vanishes whereas the shear\n$\\sigma_{ab}$ and the electric part $E_{ab}$ share a common eigenframe\nirrespective of the fluid interpretation of the models. A side result is the\nfact that the spacetimes are foliated by a set of \\emph{conformally flat }\n$3-$dimensional \\emph{timelike} slices when the anisotropy of the\n\\emph{flux-free} fluid is described only in terms of the 3 \\emph{principal\ninhomogeneous \"pressures\"} $p_{\\alpha}$ or equivalently when the Ricci tensor\nshares the same basis of eigenvectors with $\\sigma_{ab}$ and $E_{ab}$. The\nconformal flatness also indicates that a \\emph{10-dimensional algebra} of ICVFs\n$\\mathbf{\\Xi}$ acting on the $3-$dimensional timelike slices is highly possible\nto exist enriching in that way the set of conserved quantities admitted by the\nSI models found in the present paper.\n", "  Linear resonance (LR) absorption of an intense 800~nm laser light in a\nnano-cluster requires a long laser pulse > 100~fs when Mie-plasma frequency\n($\\omegaMie$) of electrons in the expanding cluster matches the laser\nfrequency~($\\omega$). For a short duration of the pulse the condition for LR is\nnot satisfied. In this case, it was shown by a model and particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 123401 (2006)] that electrons absorb laser\nenergy by anharmonic resonance (AHR) when the position-dependent frequency\n$\\Omega[r(t)]$ of an electron in the self-consistent anharmonic potential of\nthe cluster satisfies $\\Omega[r(t)]=\\omega$. However, AHR remains to be a\ndebate and still obscure in multi-particle plasma simulations. Here, we\nidentify AHR mechanism in a laser driven cluster using molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. By analyzing the trajectory of each MD electron and extracting its\n$\\Omega[r(t)]$ in the self-generated anharmonic plasma potential it is found\nthat electron is outer ionized {\\em only} when AHR is met. An anharmonic\noscillator model, introduced here, brings out most of the features of MD\nelectrons while passing the AHR. Thus, we not only bridge the gap between PIC\nsimulations, analytical models and MD calculations for the first time but also\nunequivocally prove that AHR processes is a universal dominant collisionless\nmechanism of absorption in the short pulse regime or in the early time of\nlonger pulses in clusters.\n", "  External potentials play a crucial role in modelling quantum systems, since,\nfor a given inter- particle interaction, they define the system Hamiltonian. We\nuse the metric space approach to quantum mechanics to derive, from the energy\nconservation law, two natural metrics for potentials. We show that these\nmetrics are well defined for physical potentials, regardless of whether the\nsystem is in an eigenstate or if the potential is bounded. In addition, we\ndiscuss the gauge freedom of potentials and how to ensure that the metrics\npreserve physical relevance. Our metrics for potentials, together with the\nmetrics for wavefunctions and densities from [I. D'Amico, J. P. Coe, V. V.\nFranca, and K. Capelle, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 050401 (2011)] paves the way for\na comprehensive study of the two fundamental theorems of Density Functional\nTheory. We explore these by analysing two many- body systems for which the\nrelated exact Kohn-Sham systems can be derived. First we consider the\ninformation provided by each of the metrics, and we find that the density\nmetric performs best in distinguishing two many-body systems. Next we study for\nthe systems at hand the one-to-one relationships among potentials, ground state\nwavefunctions, and ground state densities defined by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem\nas relationships in metric spaces. We find that, in metric space, these\nrelationships are monotonic and incorporate regions of linearity, at least for\nthe systems considered. Finally, we use the metrics for wavefunctions and\npotentials in order to assess quantitatively how close the many-body and\nKohn-Sham systems are: We show that, at least for the systems analysed, both\nmetrics provide a consistent picture, and for large regions of the parameter\nspace the error in approximating the many-body wavefunction with the Kohn-Sham\nwavefunction lies under a threshold of 10%.\n", "  Destructive quantum interference (DQI) in single molecule electronics is a\npurely quantum mechanical effect and entirely defined by inherent properties of\nthe molecule in the junction such as its structure and symmetry. This\ndefinition of DQI by molecular properties alone suggests its relation to other\nmore general concepts in chemistry as well as the possibility of deriving\nsimple models for its understanding and molecular device design. Recently, two\nsuch models have gained wide spread attention, where one was a graphical scheme\nbased on visually inspecting the connectivity of carbon sites in conjugated pi\nsystems in an atomic orbital (AO) basis and the other one put the emphasis on\nthe amplitudes and signs of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs). There have\nbeen discussions on the range of applicability for these schemes, but\nultimately conclusions from topological molecular Hamiltonians should not\ndepend on whether they are drawn from an AO or a MO representation, as long as\nall the orbitals are taken into account. In this article we clarify the\nrelation between both models in terms of the zeroth order Green's function and\ncompare their predictions for a variety of systems. From this comparison we\nconclude that for a correct description of DQI from a MO perspective it is\nnecessary to include the contributions from all MOs rather than just those from\nthe frontier orbitals. The cases where DQI effects can be successfully\npredicted within a frontier orbital approximation we show to be limited to\nalternant even-membered hydrocarbons, as a a direct consequence of the\nCoulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem in quantum chemistry.\n", "  A model-dependent method is proposed to determine the location of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emitting region for a given flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). In\nthe model, the extra-relativistic electrons are injected at the base of the jet\nand non-thermal photons are produced by both synchrotron radiation and\ninverse-Comtpon (IC) scattering in the energy dissipation region. The target\nphotons dominating inverse-Comtpon scattering originate from both synchrotron\nphotons and external ambient photon fields, and the energy density of external\nradiation field is a function of the distance between the position of\ndissipation region and a central super-massive black hole, and their spectra\nare seen in the comoving frame. Moreover, the energy dissipation region could\nbe determined by the model parameter through reproducing the $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra. Such a model is applied to reproduce the quasi-simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength observed data for 36 FSRQs. In order to define the width of\nthe broad-line region shell and dusty molecular torus shell, a simple numerical\nconstraint is used to determine the outer boundary of the broad-line region and\ndusty molecular torus. Our results show that 1) the $\\gamma$-ray emitting\nregions are located at the range from 0.1 pc to 10 pc; 2) the $\\gamma$-ray\nemitting regions are located outside the broad-line regions and within the\ndusty molecular tori; and 3) the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region are located\ncloser to the dusty molecular torus ranges than the broad-line regions.\nTherefore, it may concluded that a direct evidence for the \\emph{far site}\nscenario could be obtained on the basis of the model results.\n", "  The distribution of elements produced in the inner-most layers of a supernova\nexplosion is a key diagnostic for studying the collapse of massive stars. Here\nwe present the results of a 2.4 Ms \\textit{NuSTAR} observing campaign aimed at\nstudying the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We perform\nspatially-resolved spectroscopic analyses of the $^{44}$Ti ejecta which we use\nto determine the Doppler shift and thus the three-dimensional (3D) velocities\nof the $^{44}$Ti ejecta. We find an initial $^{44}$Ti mass of 1.54 $\\pm$ 0.21\n$\\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ which has a present day average momentum direction\nof 340$^{\\circ}$ $\\pm$ 15$^{\\circ}$ projected on to the plane of the sky\n(measured clockwise from Celestial North) and tilted by 58$^{\\circ}$ $\\pm$\n20$^{\\circ}$ into the plane of the sky away from the observer, roughly opposite\nto the inferred direction of motion of the central compact object. We find some\n$^{44}$Ti ejecta that are clearly interior to the reverse shock and some that\nare clearly exterior to the reverse shock. Where we observe $^{44}$Ti ejecta\nexterior to the reverse shock we also see shock-heated iron; however, there are\nregions where we see iron but do not observe $^{44}$Ti. This suggests that the\nlocal conditions of the supernova shock during explosive nucleosynthesis varied\nenough to suppress the production of $^{44}$Ti in some regions by at least a\nfactor of two, even in regions that are assumed to be the result of processes\nlike $\\alpha$-rich freezeout that should produce both iron and titanium.\n", "  We have carried out high frequency radio observations of the high magnetic\nfield pulsar PSR J1119-6127 following its recent X-ray outburst. While initial\nobservations showed no evidence of significant radio emission, subsequent\nobservations detected pulsed emission across a large frequency band. In this\nletter, we report on the initial disappearance of the pulsed emission and its\nprompt reactivation and dramatic evolution over several months of observation.\nThe periodic pulse profile at S-band (2.3 GHz) after reactivation exhibits a\nmulti-component emission structure, while the simultaneous X-band (8.4 GHz)\nprofile shows a single emission peak. Single pulses were also detected at\nS-band near the main emission peaks. We present measurements of the spectral\nindex across a wide frequency bandwidth, which captures the underlying changes\nin the radio emission profile of the neutron star. The high frequency radio\ndetection, unusual emission profile, and observed variability suggest\nsimilarities with magnetars, which may independently link the high energy\noutbursts to magnetar-like behavior.\n", "  Quantum Lyapunov control uses a feedback control methodology to determine\ncontrol fields which are applied to control quantum systems in an open-loop\nway. In this work, we adopt two Lyapunov control schemes to prepare an edge\nstate for a fermionic chain consisted of cold atoms loaded in an optical\nlattice. Such a chain can be described by the Harper model. Corresponding to\nthe two schemes, state distance and state error Lyapunov functions are\nconsidered. The results show that both the schemes are effective to prepare the\nedge state within a wide range of parameters. We found that the edge state can\nbe prepared with high fidelity even \\textbf{if} there are moderate fluctuations\nin on-site or hopping potentials. Both control schemes can be extended to\nsimilar chains (3$m+d$, $d$=2) of different lengths. Since regular amplitude\ncontrol field is easier to apply in practice, amplitude-modulated control\nfields are used to replace the unmodulated one to prepare the edge state. Such\ncontrol approaches provide tools to explore edge states for one dimensional\ntopological materials.\n", "  We study some statistical properties for the behavior of the average squared\nvelocity -- hence the temperature -- for an ensemble of classical particles\nmoving in a billiard whose boundary is time dependent. We assume the collisions\nof the particles with the boundary of the billiard are inelastic leading the\naverage squared velocity to reach a steady state dynamics for large enough\ntime. The description of the stationary state is made by using two different\napproaches: (i) heat transfer motivated by the Fourier law and, (ii) billiard\ndynamics using either numerical simulations and theoretical description.\n", "  We review recent results from the Belle experiment, which took data at the\nKEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider in Japan. The experiment recorded about\n1000 fb^{-1} of data running mainly at the \\Upsilon(4S) and \\Upsilon(5S)\nresonances. The results presented here are obtained from the full data set.\n", "  We summarize some highlights from experimental results presented at the XIIth\nInternational Conference on Beauty, Charm, and Hyperons in Hadronic\nInteractions, held at George Mason University June 12-18, 2016.\n", "  We aim to study the presence of both rotation and expansion in post-AGB\nnebulae, in particular around IW Car, a binary post-AGB star that was suspected\nto be surrounded by a Keplerian disk. We obtained high-quality ALMA\nobservations of 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 lines in IW Car. The maps were analyzed by\nmeans of a simplified model of CO emission, based on those used for similar\nobjects. Our observations clearly show the presence of gas components in\nrotation, in an equatorial disk, and expansion, which shows an hourglass-like\nstructure with a symmetry axis perpendicular to the rotation plane and is\nprobably formed of material extracted from the disk. Our modeling can reproduce\nthe observations and shows moderate uncertainties. The rotation velocity\ncorresponds to a central stellar mass of approximately 1 Mo. We also derive the\ntotal mass of the molecule-rich nebula, found to be of ~ 4 10e-3 Mo; the\noutflow is approximately eight times less massive than the disk. From the\nkinematical age of the outflow and the mass values derived for both components,\nwe infer a (future) lifetime of the disk of approximately 5000--10000 yr.\n", "  We present measurements of baryonic mass Mb and specific angular momentum\n(sAM) jb in 14 rotating dwarf Irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS\nsample. These measurements, based on 21cm kinematic data from the Very Large\nArray and stellar mass maps from the Spitzer Space Telescope, extend previous\nAM measurements by more than two orders of magnitude in Mb. The dwarf galaxies\nshow systematically higher jb values than expected from the jb~Mb^{2/3} scaling\nof spiral galaxies, representative of a scale-free galaxy formation scenario.\nThis offset can be explained by decreasing baryon mass fractions fM=Mb Mdyn\n(where Mdyn is the dynamical mass) with decreasing Mb (for Mb<10^{11}Msun). We\nfind that the sAM of neutral atomic hydrogen HI alone is about 2.5 times higher\nthan that of the stars. The M-j relation of HI is significantly steeper than\nthat of the stars, as a direct consequence of the systematic variation of the\nHI fraction with Mb.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor galaxies with metallicity below 10% of the solar value\nin the local universe are the best analogues to investigating the interstellar\nmedium at a quasi-primitive environment in the early universe. In spite of the\nongoing formation of stars in these galaxies, the presence of molecular gas\n(which is known to provide the material reservoir for star formation in\ngalaxies, such as our Milky Way) remains unclear. Here, we report the detection\nof carbon monoxide (CO), the primary tracer of molecular gas, in a galaxy with\n7% solar metallicity, with additional detections in two galaxies at higher\nmetallicities. Such detections offer direct evidence for the existence of\nmolecular gas in these galaxies that contain few metals. Using archived\ninfrared data, it is shown that the molecular gas mass per CO luminosity at\nextremely low metallicity is approximately one-thousand times the Milky Way\nvalue.\n", "  We establish a unified view to the polygamy of multi-party quantum\nentanglement in arbitrary dimensions. Using quantum Tsallis-$q$ entropy, we\nprovide a one-parameter class of polygamy inequalities of multi-party quantum\nentanglement. This class of polygamy inequalities reduces to the known polygamy\ninequalities based on tangle and entanglement of assistance for a selective\nchoice of the parameter $q$. We further provide one-parameter generalizations\nof various quantum correlations based on Tsallis-$q$ entropy. By investigating\nthe properties of the generalized quantum correlations, we provide a sufficient\ncondition, on which the Tsallis-$q$ polygamy inequalities hold in multi-party\nquantum systems of arbitrary dimensions.\n", "  A crucial result in quantum chaos, which has been established for a long\ntime, is that the spectral properties of classically integrable systems\ngenerically are described by Poisson statistics whereas those of time-reversal\nsymmetric, classically chaotic systems coincide with those of random matrices\nfrom the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). Does this result hold for\ntwo-dimensional Dirac material systems? To address this fundamen- tal question,\nwe investigate the spectral properties in a representative class of graphene\nbilliards with shapes of classically integrable circular-sector billiards.\nNaively one may expect to observe Poisson statistics, which is indeed true for\nenergies close to the band edges where the quasiparticle obeys the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. However, for energies near the Dirac point, where the\nquasiparticles behave like massless Dirac fermions, Pois- son statistics is\nextremely rare in the sense that it emerges only under quite strict symmetry\nconstraints on the straight boundary parts of the sector. An arbitrarily small\namount of imperfection of the boundary results in GOE statistics. This implies\nthat, for circular sector confinements with arbitrary angle, the spectral\nproperties will generically be GOE. These results are corroborated by extensive\nnumerical computation. Furthermore, we provide a physical understanding for our\nresults.\n", "  We mapped the ultra-high-velocity feature (the \"Bullet\") detected in the\nexpanding molecular shell associated with the W44 supernova remnant using the\nNobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m telescope and the ASTE 10-m telescope. The\nBullet clearly appears in the CO ${\\it J}$=1-0, CO ${\\it J}$=3-2, CO ${\\it\nJ}$=4-3, and HCO$^+$ ${\\it J}$=1-0 maps with a compact appearance ($0.5\\times\n0.8$ pc$^2$) and an extremely broad velocity width ($\\Delta V\\!\\simeq\\!100 \\\n\\rm km \\, s ^{-1}$). The line intensities indicate that the Bullet has a higher\ndensity and temperature than those in the expanding molecular shell. The\nkinetic energy of the Bullet amounts to $10^{48.0} \\ {\\rm erg}$ which is\napproximately 1.5 orders of magnitude greater than the kinetic energy shared to\nthe small solid angle of it. Two possible formation scenarios with an inactive\nisolated black hole (BH) are presented.\n", "  We report on the storage of light via the phenomenon of recoil-induced\nresonance in a pure two- level system of cold cesium atoms. We use a strong\ncoupling beam and a weak probe beam to couple different external momentum\nstates of the cesium atom via two-photon Raman interaction which leads to the\nstorage of the optical information of the probe beam. We have also measured the\nprobe transmission spectrum, as well as the light storage spectrum which\nreveals very narrow subnatural resonance features showing absorption and gain.\nWe have demonstrated that this memory presents the unique property of being\ninsensitive to the reading process, which does not destroy the stored\ninformation leading to a memory lifetime limited only by the atomic thermal\nmotion.\n", "  Symbiotic stars (SySt) are binaries composed of a star in the later stages of\nevolution and a stellar remnant. The enhanced mass-loss from the giant drives\ninteracting mass exchange and makes these systems laboratories for\nunderstanding binary evolution. Studies of the chemical compositions are\nparticularly useful since this parameter has strong impact on the evolutionary\npath. The previous paper in this series presented photospheric abundances for\n24 giants in S-type SySt enabling a first statistical analysis. Here we present\nresults for an additional sample of 13 giants. The aims are to improve\nstatistics of chemical composition involved in the evolution of SySt, to study\nevolutionary status, mass transfer and to interpret this in terms of Galactic\npopulations. High-resolution, near-IR spectra are used, employing the spectrum\nsynthesis method in a classical approach, to obtain abundances of CNO and\nelements around the iron peak (Fe, Ti, Ni). Low-resolution spectra in the\nregion around the Ca II triplet were used for spectral classification. The\nmetallicities obtained cover a wide range with a maximum around ~-0.2 dex. The\nenrichment in the 14N isotope indicates that these giants have experienced the\nfirst dredge-up. Relative O and Fe abundances indicate that most SySt belong to\nthe Galactic disc; however, in a few cases, the extended thick-disc/halo is\nsuggested. Difficult to explain, relatively high Ti abundances can indicate\nthat adopted microturbulent velocities were too small by ~0.2-0.3 km/s. The\nrevised spectral types for V2905 Sgr, and WRAY 17-89 are M3 and M6.5,\nrespectively.\n", "  We study the bond-alternating Heisenberg model using the finite-size\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique and analytical arguments\nbased on the matrix product state, where we pay particular attention to the\nboundary-condition dependence on the entanglement spectrum of the system. We\nshow that, in the antiperiodic boundary condition (APBC), the parity quantum\nnumbers are equivalent to the topological invariants characterizing the\ntopological phases protected by the bond-centered inversion and $\\pi$ rotation\nabout $z$ axis. We also show that the odd parity in the APBC, which\ncharacterizes topologically nontrivial phases, can be extracted as a two-fold\ndegeneracy in the entanglement spectrum even with finite system size. We then\ndetermine the phase diagram of the model with the uniaxial single-ion\nanisotropy using the level spectroscopy method in the DMRG technique. These\nresults not only suggest the detectability of the symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) phases via general twisted boundary conditions but also\nprovide a useful and precise numerical tool for discussing the SPT phases in\nthe exact diagonalization and DMRG techniques.\n", "  Van der Waals heterostructures formed by two different monolayer\nsemiconductors have emerged as a promising platform for new optoelectronic and\nspin/valleytronic applications. In addition to its atomically thin nature, a\ntwo-dimensional semiconductor heterostructure is distinct from its\nthree-dimensional counterparts due to the unique coupled spin-valley physics of\nits constituent monolayers. Here, we report the direct observation that an\noptically generated spin-valley polarization in one monolayer can be\ntransferred between layers of a two-dimensional MoSe2-WSe2 heterostructure.\nUsing nondegenerate optical circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that\ncharge transfer between two monolayers conserves spin-valley polarization and\nis only weakly dependent on the twist angle between layers. Our work points to\na new spin-valley pumping scheme in nanoscale devices, provides a fundamental\nunderstanding of spin-valley transfer across the two-dimensional interface, and\nshows the potential use of two-dimensional semiconductors as a spin-valley\ngenerator in 2D spin/valleytronic devices for storing and processing\ninformation.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of magnetic properties as a function of hydrogen\ndoping in iron based superconductor LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_x$ using the dynamical\nmean-field theory combined with the density-functional theory. We find that two\nindependent consequences of the doping, the increase of the electron occupation\nand the structural modification, have the opposite effects on the strength of\nelectron correlation and magnetism, resulting in the minimum of the calculated\nmagnetic moment around the intermediate doping level as a function of $x$. Our\nresult provides a natural explanation for the puzzling recent experimental\ndiscovery of the two separated antiferromagnetic phases at low and high doping\nlimits. Furthermore, the increase of orbital occupation and correlation\nstrength with the doping results in reduced orbital polarization of $d_{xz/yz}$\norbitals and the enhanced role of $d_{xy}$ orbital in the magnetism at high\ndoping levels, and their possible implications to the superconductivity are\ndiscussed in line with the essential role of the magnetism.\n", "  Improving the film quality in the synthesis of large-area hexagonal boron\nnitride films (h-BN) for two-dimensional material devices remains a great\nchallenge. The measurement of electrical breakdown dielectric strength (EBD) is\none of the most important methods to elucidate the insulating quality of h-BN.\nIn this work, the EBD of high quality exfoliated single-crystal h-BN was\ninvestigated using three different electrode structures under different\nenvironmental conditions to determine the ideal electrode structure and\nenvironment for EBD measurement. A systematic investigation revealed that EBD\nis not sensitive to contact force or electrode area but strongly depends on the\nrelative humidity during measurement. Once the measurement environment is\nproperly managed, it was found that the EBD values are consistent within\nexperimental error regardless of the electrode structure, which enables the\nevaluation of the crystallinity of synthesized h-BN at the microscopic and\nmacroscopic level by utilizing the three different electrode structures\nproperly for different purposes.\n", "  The ancient priest-astronomers constantly watched many heavenly bodies. The\nrecord about Halley's Comet of 1682 A.D. has been decoded completely. Good\nagreement between it and the results of European astronomers is seen. The\nrecords about Halley's Comet of 1835 A.D. as well as about the sun, the moon,\nMars and Saturn have been deciphered as well. The obtained information is the\nbasis in order to understand some aspects of the bird-man cult.\n", "  The effects of strain, induced by a Gaussian bump, on the magnetic field\ndependent transport properties of a graphene Hall bar are investigated. The\nnumerical simulations are performed using both classical and quantum mechanical\ntransport theory and we found that both approaches exhibit similar\ncharacteristic features. The effects of the Gaussian bump are manifested by a\ndecrease of the bend resistance, $R_B$, around zero-magnetic field and the\noccurrence of side-peaks in $R_B$. These features are explained as a\nconsequence of bump-assisted scattering of electrons towards different\nterminals of the Hall bar. Using these features we are able to give an estimate\nof the size of the bump. Additional oscillations in $R_B$ are found in the\nquantum description that are due to the population/depopulation of Landau\nlevels. The bump has a minor influence on the Hall resistance even for very\nhigh values of the pseudo-magnetic field. When the bump is placed outside the\ncenter of the Hall bar valley polarized electrons can be collected in the\nleads.\n", "  A kinetic Monte Carlo approach is developed for studying growth and\nevaporation of nanoparticles on/off nanotubes. This study has been motivated by\nrecent experimental advances in using nanoparticle evaporation (sublimation)\noff nanoparticle-decorated nanotubes for nanoscale \"thermometry.\" We\ndemonstrate that the considered kinetic Monte Carlo approach can reproduce\nfeatures of the process that are not included in phenomenological thermodynamic\nmodeling, as well as provide snapshots of the growth and evaporation process\nmorphology.\n", "  Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces has\nreceived increasing attention due to the merits of its high-speed\nimplementation and robustness against both control errors and decoherence.\nHowever, all the previous schemes in this direction have been based on the\nconventional geometric phases, of which the dynamical phases need to be\nremoved. In this paper, we put forward a scheme of nonadiabatic geometric\nquantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces based on unconventional\ngeometric phases, of which the dynamical phases do not need to be removed.\nSpecifically, by using three physical qubits undergoing collective dephasing to\nencode one logical qubit, we realize a universal set of geometric gates\nnonadiabatically and unconventionally. Our scheme not only maintains all the\nmerits of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation in decoherence-free\nsubspaces, but also avoids the additional operations required in the\nconventional schemes to cancel the dynamical phases.\n", "  We analyze the general model of a radiating star in general relativity. A\ngroup analysis of the under determined, nonlinear partial differential equation\ngoverning the model's gravitational potentials is performed. This analysis is\nan extension of previous group analyses carried out and produces new group\ninvariant solutions. We find that the gravitational potentials depend on\nexponential functions owing to the choice of the Lie symmetry generator. The\nfundamental boundary equation to be solved is in general a Riccati equation.\nSeveral new exact families of solutions to the boundary condition are\ngenerated. Earlier models of Euclidean stars and generalized Euclidean stellar\nmodels are regained as special cases. Linear equations of state can be found\nfor shear-free and shearing spacetimes.\n", "  We systematically analyze the nonlinear partial differential equation that\ndetermines the behaviour of a bounded radiating spherical mass in general\nrelativity. Four categories of solution are possible. These are identified in\nterms of restrictions on the gravitational potentials. One category of solution\ncan be related to the horizon function transformation which was recently\nintroduced. A Lie symmetry analysis of the resulting Riccati equation shows\nthat several new classes of exact solutions are possible. The relationship\nbetween the horizon function, Euclidean star models and other earlier\ninvestigations is clarified.\n", "  We find new exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations which are\nrelevant in the description of highly compact stellar objects. The relativistic\nstar is charged and anisotropic with a quark equation of state. Exact solutions\nof the field equations are found in terms of elementary functions. It is\ninteresting to note that we regain earlier quark models with uncharged and\ncharged matter distributions. A physical analysis indicates that the matter\ndistributions are well behaved and regular throughout the stellar structure. A\nrange of stellar masses are generated for particular parameter values in the\nelectric field. In particular the observed mass for a binary pulsar is\nregained.\n", "  We study a charged compact object with anisotropic pressures in a core\nenvelope setting. The equation of state is quadratic in the core and linear in\nthe envelope. There is smooth matching between the three regions: the core,\nenvelope and the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m exterior. We show that the presence of\nthe electric field affects the masses, radii and compactification factors of\nstellar objects with values which are in agreement with previous studies. We\ninvestigate in particular the effect of electric field on the physical features\nof the pulsar PSR J1614-2230 in the core envelope model. The gravitational\npotentials and the matter variables are well behaved within the stellar object.\nWe demonstrate that the radius of the core and the envelope can vary by\nchanging the parameters in the speed of sound.\n", "  The spectral and temporal evolution during X-ray outbursts give important\nclues on the accretion process and radiation mechanism in black-hole X-ray\nbinaries (BH XRBs). A set of Swift and RXTE observations were executed to\nmonitor the 2008 outburst of the black-hole candidate Swift J1842.5-1124. We\ninvestigate these data to explore the accretion physics in BH XRBs. We carry\nout a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis on all the available pointing\nobservations, including fitting both X-ray spectra and power density spectra,\nmeasuring the optical and near-ultraviolet flux density. We also search for\ncorrelations among the spectral and timing parameters. The observed properties\nof Swift J1842.5-1124 are similar to other BH XRBs in many respects, for\nexample the hardness-intensity diagram and hardness-rms diagram. The type-C\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were observed as the source started to\ntransit from the low-hard state to the high-soft state. The frequency of QPOs\ncorrelate with intensity and the hard component index, and anti-correlate with\nthe hardness and the total fractional rms. These relations are consistent with\nthe Lense-Thirring precession model. The estimated U-band flux changed with the\nX-ray flux, while the flux density at the V band remained 0.26 mJy. These\nresults imply that the X-ray reprocessing or the tail of thermal emission from\nthe outer disk contributes a significant fraction of the U-band radiation;\nalternatively, the companion star or the jet dominates the flux at longer\nwavelengths.\n", "  The atmospheres of exoplanets reveal all their properties beyond mass,\nradius, and orbit. Based on bulk densities, we know that exoplanets larger than\n1.5 Earth radii must have gaseous envelopes, hence atmospheres. We discuss\ncontemporary techniques for characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. The\nmeasurements are difficult, because - even in current favorable cases - the\nsignals can be as small as 0.001-percent of the host star's flux. Consequently,\nsome early results have been illusory, and not confirmed by subsequent\ninvestigations. Prominent illusions to date include polarized scattered light,\ntemperature inversions, and the existence of carbon planets. The field moves\nfrom the first tentative and often incorrect conclusions, converging to the\nreality of exoplanetary atmospheres. That reality is revealed using transits\nfor close-in exoplanets, and direct imaging for young or massive exoplanets in\ndistant orbits. Several atomic and molecular constituents have now been\nrobustly detected in exoplanets as small as Neptune. In our current\nobservations, the effects of clouds and haze appear ubiquitous. Topics at the\ncurrent frontier include the measurement of heavy element abundances in giant\nplanets, detection of carbon-based molecules, measurement of atmospheric\ntemperature profiles, definition of heat circulation efficiencies for tidally\nlocked planets, and the push to detect and characterize the atmospheres of\nsuper-Earths. Future observatories for this quest include the James Webb Space\nTelescope, and the new generation of Extremely Large Telescopes on the ground.\nOn a more distant horizon, NASA's concepts for the HabEx and LUVOIR missions\ncould extend the study of exoplanetary atmospheres to true twins of Earth.\n", "  We consider the local statistics of $H = V^* X V + U^* Y U$ where $V$ and $U$\nare independent Haar-distributed unitary matrices, and $X$ and $Y$ are\ndeterministic real diagonal matrices. In the bulk, we prove that the gap\nstatistics and correlation functions coincide with the GUE in the limit when\nthe matrix size $N \\to \\infty$ under mild assumptions on $X$ and $Y$. Our\nmethod relies on running a carefully chosen diffusion on the unitary group and\ncomparing the resulting eigenvalue process to Dyson Brownian motion. Our method\nalso applies to the case when $V$ and $U$ are drawn from the orthogonal group.\nOur proof relies on the local law for $H$ proved by [Bao-Erd\\H{o}s-Schnelli] as\nwell as the DBM convergence results of [L.-Sosoe-Yau].\n", "  From biofilm and colony formation in bacteria to wound healing and embryonic\ndevelopment in multicellular organisms, groups of living cells must often move\ncollectively. While considerable study has probed the biophysical mechanisms of\nhow eukaryotic cells generate forces during migration, little such study has\nbeen devoted to bacteria, in particular with regard to the question of how\nbacteria generate and coordinate forces during collective motion. This question\nis addressed here for the first time using traction force microscopy. We study\ntwo distinct motility mechanisms of Myxococcus xanthus, namely twitching and\ngliding. For twitching, powered by type-IV pilus retraction, we find that\nindividual cells exert local traction in small hotspots with forces on the\norder of 50 pN. Twitching of bacterial groups also produces traction hotspots,\nhowever with amplified forces around 100 pN. Although twitching groups migrate\nslowly as a whole, traction fluctuates rapidly on timescales <1.5 min. Gliding,\nthe second motility mechanism, is driven by lateral transport of substrate\nadhesions. When cells are isolated, gliding produces low average traction on\nthe order of 1 Pa. However, traction is amplified in groups by a factor of ~5.\nSince advancing protrusions of gliding cells push on average in the direction\nof motion, we infer a long-range compressive load sharing among sub-leading\ncells. Together, these results show that the forces generated during twitching\nand gliding have complementary characters and both forces are collectively\namplified in groups.\n", "  It is known that multidimensional complex potentials obeying\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry may possess all real spectra and continuous families of\nsolitons. Recently it was shown that for multi-dimensional systems these\nfeatures can persist when the parity symmetry condition is relaxed so that the\npotential is invariant under reflection in only a single spatial direction. We\nexamine the existence, stability and dynamical properties of localized modes\nwithin the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation in such a scenario of\npartially $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potential.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the corrections of exciton binding energy in\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to the exciton-optical\nphonon coupling in the Fr$\\ddot{o}$hlich interaction model by using the linear\noperator combined Lee-Low-Pines variational method. We not only consider the\nexcitons couple with the intrinsic longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes, but\nalso the surface optical phonon modes that induced by the polar substrates\nunderneath the TMDs. We find that exciton binding energies are corrected in a\nlarge scale due to these exciton-optical phonon couplings. We discuss the\ndependences of exciton binding energy on the cut-off wave vector of optical\nphonon modes, the polarization parameters of materials and the interlayer\ndistance between the polar substrates and TMDs. These results provide potential\nexplanations for the divergence of the exciton binding energy between\nexperiment and theory in TMDs.\n", "  Many technologies have been developed to help improve spatial resolution of\nobservational images for ground-based solar telescopes, such as adaptive optics\n(AO) systems and post-processing reconstruction. As any AO system correction is\nonly partial, it is indispensable to use post-processing reconstruction\ntechniques. In the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), speckle masking method is\nused to achieve the diffraction limited resolution of the telescope. Although\nthe method is very promising, the computation is quite intensive, and the\namount of data is tremendous, requiring several months to reconstruct\nobservational data of one day on a high-end computer. To accelerate image\nreconstruction, we parallelize the program package on a high performance\ncluster. We describe parallel implementation details for several reconstruction\nprocedures. The code is written in C language using Message Passing Interface\n(MPI) and optimized for parallel processing in a multi-processor environment.\nWe show the excellent performance of parallel implementation, and the whole\ndata processing speed is about 71 times faster than before. Finally, we analyze\nthe scalability of the code to find possible bottlenecks, and propose several\nways to further improve the parallel performance. We conclude that the\npresented program is capable of executing in real-time reconstruction\napplications at NVST.\n", "  We numerically investigate the electronic transport properties of graphene\nnanoribbons and carbon nanotubes with inter-valley coupling, e.g., in \\sqrt{3}N\n\\times \\sqrt{3}N and 3N \\times 3N superlattices. By taking the \\sqrt{3} \\times\n\\sqrt{3} graphene superlattice as an example, we show that tailoring the bulk\ngraphene superlattice results in rich structural configurations of nanoribbons\nand nanotubes. After studying the electronic characteristics of the\ncorresponding armchair and zigzag nanoribbon geometries, we find that the\nlinear bands of carbon nanotubes can lead to the Klein tunnelling-like\nphenomenon, i.e., electrons propagate along tubes without backscattering even\nin the presence of a barrier. Due to the coupling between K and K' valleys of\npristine graphene by \\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3} supercells,we propose a\nvalley-field-effect transistor based on the armchair carbon nanotube, where the\nvalley polarization of the current can be tuned by applying a gate voltage or\nvarying the length of the armchair carbon nanotubes.\n", "  An arxiv paper, ref. [1] by Cao et al., claimed that the tunable attraction\nreported in our ref. [2] could not be detected. Ref. [1] was submitted to\nNature in Apr. 2016 as a Comment on our ref. [2]. Our reply in May 2016\nresponded to ref. [1] and was reviewed by the editor of Nature and an external\nreferee. Ref. [1] was rejected by Nature in Aug. 2016. We provide our reply,\nwhich answers all of the criticisms in ref. [1], in Appendix I. The main text\ncontains a brief reply to the main criticisms.\n", "  The translocation time of a polymer chain through an interaction energy\ngradient nanopore was studied by Monte Carlo simulations and the Fokker-Planck\nequation with double-absorbing boundary conditions. Both the simulation and\ncalculation revealed three different behaviors for polymer translocation. These\nbehaviors can be explained qualitatively from free-energy landscapes obtained\nfor polymer translocation at different parameters. Results show that the\ntranslocation time of a polymer chain through a nanopore can be tuned by\nsuitably designing the interaction energy gradient.\n", "  In J.D. Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics textbook, the analysis of Dirac's\ncharge quantization condition in the presence of a magnetic monopole has a\nmathematical omission and an all too brief physical argument that might mislead\nsome students. This paper presents a detailed derivation of Jackson's main\nresult, explains the significance of the missing term, and highlights the close\nconnection between Jackson's findings and Dirac's original argument.\n", "  Critical infrastructures form a technological skeleton of our world by\nproviding us with water, food, electricity, gas, transportation, communication,\nbanking, and finance. Moreover, as urban population increases, the role of\ninfrastructures become more vital. In this paper, we adopt a network\nperspective and discuss the ever growing need for fundamental interdisciplinary\nstudy of critical infrastructure networks, efficient methods for estimating\ntheir reliability, and cost-effective strategies for enhancing their\nresiliency. We also highlight some of the main challenges arising on this way,\nincluding cascading failures, feedback loops, and cross-sector\ninterdependencies.\n", "  We present an approach for real-time change detection in the transient phases\nof complex dynamical systems based on tracking the local phase and amplitude\nsynchronization among the components of a univariate time series signal derived\nvia Intrinsic Time scale Decomposition (ITD)--a nonlinear, non-parametric\nanalysis method. We investigate the properties of ITD components and show that\nthe expected level of phase synchronization at a given change point may be\nenhanced by more than 4 folds when we employ multiple intrinsic components.\nNext, we introduce a concept of maximal mutual agreement to identify the set of\nITD components that are most likely to capture the information about dynamical\nchanges of interest, and define an InSync statistic to capture this local\ninformation. Extensive numerical as well as real-world case studies involving\nbenchmark neurophysiological processes and industrial machine sensor data\nsuggest that the present method can detect sharp change points and\nsecond/higher order moment shifts with average sensitivity of ~91% as compared\nto approximately 30% for other contemporary methods tested on the case studies\npresented.\n", "  Decades of astrophysical observations have convincingly shown that soft X-ray\n(SXR; ~0.1--10 keV) emission provides unique diagnostics for the high\ntemperature plasmas observed in solar flares and active regions. SXR\nobservations critical for constraining models of energy release in these\nphenomena can be provided using instruments that have already been flown on\nsounding rockets and CubeSats, including miniaturized high-resolution\nphoton-counting spectrometers and a novel diffractive spectral imager. These\ninstruments have relatively low cost and high TRL, and would complement a wide\nrange of mission concepts. In this white paper, we detail the scientific\nbackground and open questions motivating these instruments, the measurements\nrequired, and the instruments themselves that will make groundbreaking progress\nin answering these questions.\n", "  By considering distance-regular graphs as spin networks, we investigate the\nstate transfer fidelity in this class of networks. The effect of environment on\nthe dynamics of state transfer is modeled using Milburn's intrinsic decoherence\n[G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A 44, 5401 (1991)]. We consider a particular type of\nspin Hamiltonians which are extended version of those of Christandl et al\n[Phys. Rev. A 71, 032312 (2005)]. It is shown that decoherence destroys perfect\ncommunication channels. Using optimal coupling strengths derived by Jafarizadeh\nand Sufiani [Phys. Rev. A 77, 022315 (2008)], we show that destructive effect\nof environment on the communication channel increases by increasing the\ndecoherence rate, however the state transfer fidelity reaches a steady value as\ntime approaches infinity which is independent of the decoherence rate.\nMoreover, it is shown that for a given decoherence rate, the fidelity of\ntransfer decreases by increasing the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver.\n", "  TeV photons from extragalactic sources are absorbed in the intergalactic\nmedium and initiate electromagnetic cascades. These cascades offer a unique\ntool to probe the properties of the universe at cosmological scales. We present\na new Monte Carlo code dedicated to the physics of such cascades. This code has\nbeen tested against both published results and analytical approximations, and\nis made publicly available. Using this numerical tool, we investigate the main\ncascade properties (spectrum, halo extension, time delays), and study in detail\ntheir dependence on the physical parameters (extra-galactic magnetic field,\nextra-galactic background light, source redshift, source spectrum and beaming\nemission). The limitations of analytical solutions are emphasised. In\nparticular, analytical approximations account only for the first generation of\nphotons and higher branches of the cascade tree are neglected.\n", "  Recent work by Abramsky and Brandenburger used sheaf theory to give a\nmathematical formulation of non-locality and contextuality. By adopting this\nviewpoint, it has been possible to define cohomological obstructions to the\nexistence of global sections. In the present work, we illustrate new insights\ninto different aspects of this theory. We shed light on the power of detection\nof the cohomological obstruction by showing that it is not a complete invariant\nfor strong contextuality even under symmetry and connectedness restrictions on\nthe measurement cover, disproving a previous conjecture. We generalise\nobstructions to higher cohomology groups and show that they give rise to a\nrefinement of the notion of cohomological contextuality: different \"levels\" of\ncontextuality are organised in a hierarchy of logical implications. Finally, we\npresent an alternative description of the first cohomology group in terms of\ntorsors, resulting in a new interpretation of the cohomological obstructions.\n", "  In quantum logic there is well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary\noperation for conditional. Currently, we have at least three candidates, called\nthe Sasaki conditional, the contrapositive Sasaki conditional, and the\nrelevance conditional. A fundamental problem is to show how the form of the\nconditional follows from an analysis of operational concepts in quantum theory.\nHere, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory (QST). In this\npaper, we develop quantum set theory based on quantum logics with those three\nconditionals, each of which defines different quantum logical truth value\nassignment. We show that those three models satisfy the transfer principle of\nthe same form to determine the quantum logical truth values of theorems of the\nZFC set theory. We also show that the reals in the model and the truth values\nof their equality are the same for those models. Interestingly, however, the\norder relation between quantum reals significantly depends on the underlying\nconditionals. We characterize the operational meanings of those order relations\nin terms of joint probability obtained by the successive projective\nmeasurements of arbitrary two observables. Those characterizations clearly show\ntheir individual features and will play a fundamental role in future\napplications to quantum physics.\n", "  In this paper, W*-algebras are presented as canonical colimits of diagrams of\nmatrix algebras and completely positive maps. In other words, matrix algebras\nare dense in W*-algebras.\n", "  The propagation of wave disturbances over a vertically oscillating liquid may\nform standing waves, known as Faraday waves. Here we present an alternative\ndescription of the generation and evolution of Faraday waves by nonlinear\nresonant triad interactions, accounting for gravity surface effects and the\nslight compressibility of the liquid. To this end, we analyse a triad\ncomprising an infinitely long-crested compression mode and two oppositely\npropagating subharmonic surface waves.\n", "  We investigate the large time behavior of an agent based model describing\ntumor growth. The microscopic model combines short-range repulsion and cell\ndivision. As the number of cells increases exponentially in time, the\nmicroscopic model is challenging in terms of computational time. To overcome\nthis problem, we aim at deriving the associated macroscopic dynamics leading\nhere to a porous media type equation. As we are interested in the long time\nbehavior of the dynamics, the macroscopic equation obtained through usual\nderivation method fails at providing the correct qualitative behavior (e.g.\nstationary states differ from the microscopic dynamics). We propose a modified\nversion of the macroscopic equation introducing a density threshold for the\nrepulsion. We numerically validate the new formulation by comparing the\nsolutions of the micro- and macro- dynamics. Moreover, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of the dynamics as the repulsion between cells becomes singular\n(leading to non-overlapping constraints in the microscopic model). We manage to\nshow formally that such an asymptotic limit leads to a Hele-Shaw type problem\nfor the macroscopic dynamics.\n  The macroscopic model derived in this paper therefore enables to overcome the\nproblem of large computational time raised by the microscopic model and stays\nclosely linked to the microscopic dynamics.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations have long been used as an observable for\nmeasuring the initial-state partonic transverse momentum $k_T$. Sensitivity to\nthis small transverse momentum scale allows nonperturbative transverse momentum\ndependent effects to be probed in high $p_T$ dihadron and direct photon-hadron\ncorrelations. The observable $p_{out}$, the out-of-plane transverse momentum\ncomponent from a near-side $\\pi^0$ or direct photon, is sensitive to\ninitial-state $k_T$ and final-state fragmentation transverse momentum $j_T$ and\nthus can probe nonperturbative transverse-momentum-dependent effects. In the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent framework, nearly back-to-back particle\nproduction in $p$+$p$ collisions with a measured final-state hadron has been\npredicted to break factorization due to the possibility of gluon exchanges with\ncolored remnants in the initial and final states. For this reason, the\ninteracting partons are predicted to be correlated; however, there is so far no\nquantitative prediction for the magnitude of such effects. In this talk, recent\nmeasurements of dihadron and direct-photon hadron correlations in $p$+$p$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=510 GeV at the PHENIX experiment will be presented.\n", "  We present a new scheme of a moderate-resolution spectrograph based on a\ncascade of serial holographic gratings each of which produces an individual\nspectrum with a resolution of about 6000 and a bandwidth of 80 nm. The gratings\nensure centering of each part of the spectrum they produce so as to provide\nuniform coverage of the broadest possible wavelength interval. In this study we\nmanage to simultaneously cover the 430-680 nm interval without gaps using three\ngratings. Efficiency of the spectrograph optical system itself from the\nentrance slit to the CCD detector is typically of about 60 % with a maximum of\n75 %. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the new spectrograph scheme as\nwell as the astrophysical tasks for which the instrument can be used.\n", "  After coming to rest on the night side of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,\nthe ROLIS camera on-board Rosetta's Philae lander acquired five images of the\nsurface below the lander, four of which were with the aid of LED illumination\nof different colors. The images confirm that Philae was perched on a sloped\nsurface. A local horizon is visible in one corner of the image, beyond which we\ncan see the coma. Having spent a full day on the surface Philae was commanded\nto lift and rotate, after which a final, sixth, LED image was acquired. The\nchange in perspective allowed us to construct a shape model of the surface. The\ndistance to the foreground was about 80 cm, much larger than the nominal 30 cm.\nThis caused stray light, rather than directly reflected LED light, to dominate\nthe image signal, complicating the analysis. The images show a lumpy surface\nwith a roughness of apparently fractal nature. Its appearance is completely\ndifferent from that of the first landing site, which was characterized by\ncentimeter to meter-sized debris (Mottola et al., 2015). We recognize neither\nparticles nor pores at the image resolution of 0.8 mm per pixel and large color\nvariations are absent. The surface has a bi-modal brightness distribution that\ncan be interpreted in terms of the degree of consolidation, a hypothesis that\nwe support with experimental evidence. We propose the surface below the lander\nto consist of smooth, cracked plates with unconsolidated edges, similar to\nterrain seen in CIVA images.\n", "  In this conceptual design report the possible options for an upgrade of the\nREX/HIE-ISOLDE charge breeder are discussed. The performance requirements\nimposed by standard HIE-ISOLDE physics as well as injection into a possible\nfuture TSR@ISOLDE are discussed, and thereafter translated into machine\nparameters. Experimental results from tests of a high-current and high-density\nelectron gun performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory are presented, and\nalternative gun designs are discussed. Finally, a cost estimate is given\ntogether with possible beneficiaries of the on-going R&D, and potential\ncollaboration partners are identified.\n", "  We illustrate that $\\Lambda$MOND cosmology following from E. Verlinde's\nemergent gravity idea which contains only constant dark energy and baryonic\nmatters governed by linear inverse gravitation forces at and beyond galaxy\nscales fit with the luminosity distance v.s. redshift relationship, i.e.\n$d_\\ell(z)$ of type Ia supernovae equally well as the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology does. But in a rather broad and reasonable parameter space,\n$\\Lambda$MOND gives too strong baryon acoustic oscillation, i.e. BAO signals on\nthe matter power spectrum contradicting with observations from various galaxy\nsurvey and counting experiments.\n", "  We supply the first proof of Krein's Trace Theorem which does not use complex\nanalysis. Our proof holds for~$\\sigma$-finite von Neumann algebras\n$\\mathcal{M}$ of type II and unbounded perturbations from the predual\nof~$\\mathcal{M}$.\n", "  The sparsely spaced highly permeable fractures of the granitic rock aquifer\nat Stang-er-Brune (Brittany, France) form a well-connected fracture network of\nhigh permeability but unknown geometry. Previous work based on optical and\nacoustic logging together with single-hole and cross-hole flowmeter data\nacquired in 3 neighboring boreholes (70-100 m deep) have identified the most\nimportant permeable fractures crossing the boreholes and their hydraulic\nconnections. To constrain possible flow paths by estimating the geometries of\nknown and previously unknown fractures, we have acquired, processed and\ninterpreted multifold, single- and cross-hole GPR data using 100 and 250 MHz\nantennas. The GPR data processing scheme consisting of time-zero corrections,\nscaling, bandpass filtering and F-X deconvolution, eigenvector filtering,\nmuting, pre-stack Kirchhoff depth migration and stacking was used to\ndifferentiate fluid-filled fracture reflections from source-generated noise.\nThe final stacked and pre-stack depth-migrated GPR sections provide\nhigh-resolution images of individual fractures (dipping 30-90{\\deg}) in the\nsurroundings (2-20 m for the 100 MHz antennas; 2-12 m for the 250 MHz antennas)\nof each borehole in a 2D plane projection that are of superior quality to those\nobtained from single-offset sections. Most fractures previously identified from\nhydraulic testing can be correlated to reflections in the single-hole data.\nSeveral previously unknown major near vertical fractures have also been\nidentified away from the boreholes.\n", "  The Research Data Alliance is an international organization which aims at\nbuilding the technical and sociological bridges that enable the open sharing of\nscientific data. It is a remarkable forum to discuss all the aspects of\nscientific data sharing with colleagues from all around the world: in November\n2016, it has 4 500 members from 115 countries. The biannual Plenary meetings,\nwhich gather several hundred participants, are rotating between different\nregions. The March 2017 one will be held in Barcelona and the September 2017\none in Montreal, after Tokyo and Denver in 2016. The RDA work is organized\nbottom-up, with Working Groups which have 18 months to produce implementable\ndeliverables and Interest Groups which serve as platforms of communication and\ndiscussion and also produce important outputs such as surveys and\nrecommendations. There are currently 27 Working Groups and 45 Interest Groups,\ntackling a wide diversity of subjects, including community needs, reference for\nsharing, data stewardship and services, and topics related to the base\ninfrastructure of data sharing. Some scientific communities use the RDA as a\nneutral forum to define their own disciplinary data sharing framework, with\nmajor successes such as the Wheat Data Interoperability Working Group which\nworked in coordination with the International Wheat Initiative. Astronomy has\nthe IVOA to define its interoperability standards, and so we do not need to\ncreate a Group for that purpose in the RDA. But many topics discussed in the\nRDA have a strong interest for us, for instance on data citation or\ncertification of data repositories. We have a lot to share from what we have\nlearnt in building our disciplinary global data infrastructure; we also have a\nlot to learn from others. The paper discusses RDA current themes or results of\ninterest for astronomy data providers, and current liaisons with astronomy.\n", "  Identifying transport pathways in fractured rock is extremely challenging as\nflow is often organized in a few fractures that occupy a very small portion of\nthe rock volume. We demonstrate that saline tracer experiments combined with\nsingle-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) reflection imaging can be used to\nmonitor saline tracer movement within mm-aperture fractures. A dipole tracer\ntest was performed in a granitic aquifer by injecting a saline solution in a\nknown fracture, while repeatedly acquiring single-hole GPR sections in the\npumping borehole located 6 m away. The final depth-migrated difference sections\nmake it possible to identify consistent temporal changes over a 30 m depth\ninterval at locations corresponding to fractures previously imaged in GPR\nsections acquired under natural flow and tracer-free conditions. The experiment\nallows determining the dominant flow paths of the injected tracer and the\nvelocity (0.4-0.7 m/min) of the tracer front.\n", "  This is an introduction to: (1) the enumerative geometry of rational curves\nin equivariant symplectic resolutions, and (2) its relation to the structures\nof geometric representation theory.

Using a classical analysis, the Hamilton's\nequation are obtained, a threshold indicating a discontinuous phase transition\nis presented and the classical dynamics is computed. Then, the quantum dynamics\nis investigated using direct diagonalisation. We find well agreement in both\nthese analysis. Based on our results, the switching scheme for tunneling is\nshown and the experimental feasibility is discussed.\n", "  In preprint we consider and compare different definitions of generalized\nsolution of the Cauchy problem for 1d-scalar quasilinear equation (conservation\nlaw).

We discuss the conditions\nthat provide definitions to be equivalent.\n", "  No, in a rigorous sense specified below.\n", "  We investigate the Brillouin action in terms of its suitability as a kernel\nto the overlap procedure, with a view on both heavy and light quark physics. We\nuse the diagonal elements of the Kenney-Laub family of iterations for the\nsparse matrix sign function, since they grow monotonically and facilitate\ncascaded preconditioning strategies with different rational approximations to\nthe sign function. We find that the overlap action with the Brillouin kernel is\nsignificantly better localized than the version with the Wilson kernel.\n", "  The structure effects of the fission fragments on their yields are studied\nwithin the statical theory with the inputs, like, excitation energies and level\ndensity parameters for the fission fragments at a given temperature calculated\nusing the temperature dependent relativistic mean field formalism (TRMF). For\nthe comparison, the results are also obtained using the finite range droplet\nmodel. At temperatures $T =1-2$ MeV, the structural effects of the fission\nfragments influence their yields. It is also seen that at $T = $ 3 MeV, the\nfragments become spherical and the fragments distribution peaks at a close\nshell or near close shell nucleus.\n", "  Our search for magnetic fields in selected OBA stars using FOcal Reducer low\ndispersion Spectrographs FORS 1 and FORS 2 in spectropolarimetric mode revealed\nthe presence of strong line profile variations (LPV) in spectra of magnetic OBA\nstars. More specifically, we detected moderate line profile variations of\nselected lines on a time scale of minutes in FORS 2 spectra of the A0\nsupergiant HD 92207 (Hubrig et al. 2014). Recently, we investigated the\nvariability of line profiles of selected OBA stars with the multi-mode focal\nreducer SCORPIO at the 6-meter BTA telescope. We discovered regular variations\nof H and He lines in the spectra of the O-type star HD 93521 (O9.5III) with\nperiods ~4-5 and ~32-36 minutes. The possible origin of short time-scale\nspectral variations is discussed.\n", "  We review the measurements of magnetic fields of OB stars and compile a\ncatalog of magnetic OB stars. Based on available data we confirm that magnetic\nfield values are distributed according to a log--normal law with a mean\nlog(B)=2.53 and a standard deviation $\\sigma=0.54$. We also investigate the\nformation of the magnetic field of OBA stars before the Main Sequence (MS).\n", "  We present a very brief overview of some recent gamma-ray observations of\nselected blazars to reveal an indication for a considerable or even dominant\ncontribution of secondary gamma-rays from electromagnetic cascades to the\nobservable spectra in the 1-500 GeV energy range.\n", "  We present a novel experimental system that can be used to study the dynamics\nof picoliter droplet spreading over substrates with topographic variations. We\nconcentrate on spreading of a droplet within a recessed stadium-shaped pixel,\nwith applications to the manufacture of POLED displays, and find that the\nsloping side wall of the pixel can either locally enhance or hinder spreading\ndepending on whether the topography gradient ahead of the contact line is\npositive or negative. Locally enhanced spreading occurs via the formation of\nthin pointed rivulets along the side walls of the pixel through a mechanism\nsimilar to capillary rise in sharp corners. We demonstrate that a thin-film\nmodel combined with an experimentally measured spreading law, which relates the\nspeed of the contact line to the contact angle, provides excellent predictions\nof the evolving liquid morphologies. We also show that the spreading can be\nadequately described by a Cox-Voinov law for the majority of the evolution. The\nmodel does not include viscous effects and hence, the timescales for the\npropagation of the thin pointed rivulets are not captured. Nonetheless, this\nsimple model can be used very effectively to predict the areas covered by the\nliquid and may serve as a useful design tool for systems that require precise\ncontrol of liquid on substrates.\n", "  We present results of Monte Carlo simulation aiming at the estimate of the\nfrequency of semi-detached Algol-type binaries among the stars observed as\nsingle ones. When account is made for various detection biases (mostly due to\ninclination of orbits), the fraction of Algols among Galactic disk stars\nappears to be 0.1--0.2\\%. However, this number should be regarded as a lower\nlimit only, since there are still unaccounted selection effects and other types\nof photometrically unresolved binaries. Hidden binarity appears to be an\nimportant phenomenon that should be taken into account when considering stellar\nstatistics and construction of fundamental relations between stellar\nparameters.\n", "  In spite of the strong observational evidence suggesting a period of rapid\nexpansion in the early universe, the identity of the inflaton field that drove\nthis expansion remains elusive. Many inflaton candidate particles (both known\nand hypothesized) have been proposed to explain the early accelerated expansion\nof the universe. Other explanations for an era of rapid expansion in the early\nuniverse have been proposed via modifications of gravity in one form or\nanother.\n  In this paper, we consider the possibility of using a Van der Waals equation\nof state to describe the early-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We\ndo not attempt to explain why the early universe may be filled with such a\nfluid, but rather investigate what constraints may be placed on the parameters\nwhich describe a Van der Waals fluid that sources an accelerated expansion in\nthe early universe. We consider three different versions of the Van der Waals\nequation of state and constrain the parameters of each using CMB data. We find\nthat two of the models do not fit constraints from observation. A third model\nmay satisfy observational constraints, but only under very narrow\ncircumstances.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new group of double-periodic stars in the OGLE\nGalactic bulge photometry. In 38 stars identified as fundamental mode RR~Lyrae\nand 4 classified as the first-overtone RR~Lyrae, we detected additional shorter\nperiodicity. Periods of the dominant variability in the newly discovered group\nare $0.28<P_{\\rm D}<0.41$\\,days. Period ratios $(0.68 - 0.72)$ are smaller than\nthe period ratios of the Galactic bulge RRd stars. The typical amplitude ratio\n(of the additional to the dominant periodicity) is 20\\,\\% for the stars\nidentified as fundamental mode RR~Lyrae and 50\\,\\% for stars classified as the\nfirst-overtone RR~Lyrae. Ten stars from our sample exhibit equidistant peaks in\nthe frequency spectrum, that suggest the Blazhko-type modulation of the main\npulsation frequency and/or the additional periodicity. The Fourier coefficients\n$R_{\\mathrm{21}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{31}}$ are one of the lowest among fundamental\nmode RR Lyrae stars, but among the highest for the first-overtone pulsators.\nFor the phase Fourier coefficients $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{21}}$ and\n$\\varphi_{\\mathrm{31}}$, our stars lie in between RRab and RRc stars. Discussed\nstars were compared with the radial, linear pulsation models. Their position in\nthe Petersen diagram cannot be reproduced assuming that two radial modes are\nexcited and their physical parameters are similar to that characteristic for\nRR~Lyrae stars. The non-radial mode scenario also faces difficulties. We\nconclude that the dominant variability is most likely due to pulsation in the\nradial fundamental mode including stars classified as the first overtone mode\npulsators. At this point, we cannot explain the nature of the additional\nperiodicity. Even more, classification of the stars as RR~Lyrae should be\ntreated as tentative.\n", "  Controlling Chaos could be a big factor in getting great stable amounts of\nenergy out of small amounts of not necessarily stable resources. By definition,\nChaos is getting huge changes in the system's output due to unpredictable small\nchanges in initial conditions, and that means we could take advantage of this\nfact and select the proper control system to manipulate system's initial\nconditions and inputs in general and get a desirable output out of otherwise a\nChaotic system. That was accomplished by first building some known chaotic\ncircuit (Chua circuit) and the NI's MultiSim was used to simulate the ANN\ncontrol system. It was shown that this technique can also be used to stabilize\nsome hard to stabilize electronic systems.\n", "  We consider a tracer particle on a lattice in the presence of immobile\nobstacles. Starting from equilibrium, a force pulling on the particle is\nswitched on, driving the system to a new stationary state. We solve for the\ncomplete transient dynamics of the fluctuations of the tracer position along\nthe direction of the force. The analytic result, exact in first order of the\nobstacle density and for arbitrarily strong driving, is compared to stochastic\nsimulations. Upon strong driving, the fluctuations grow superdiffusively for\nintermediate times; however, they always become diffusive in the stationary\nstate. The diffusion constant is nonanalytic for small driving and is enhanced\nby orders of magnitude by increasing the force.\n", "  Highly doped Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) or PEDOT is a conductive\npolymer with a wide range of applications in energy conversion due to its ease\nof processing, optical properties and high conductivity. The latter is\ninfluenced by processing conditions, including formulation, annealing, and\nsolvent treatment of the polymer, which also affects the polymer arrangement.\nHere we show that the analysis of the optical spectra of PEDOT domains reveals\nthe nature and magnitude of the structural disorder in the material. In\nparticular, the optical spectra of objects on individual domains can be used\nfor the elucidation of the molecular disorder in oligomer arrangement which is\na key factor affecting the conductivity.\n", "  Starting from an isotropic configuration of intersecting, two-dimensional\ntoric codes, we construct a fracton topological phase introduced in Ref. [26],\nwhich is characterized by immobile, point- like topological excitations\n(\"fractons\"), and degenerate ground-states on the torus that are locally\nindistinguishable. Our proposal leads to a simple description of the fracton\nexcitations and of the ground-state as a \"loop\" condensate, and provides a\nbasis for building new 3D topological orders such as a natural, $Z_{N}$\ngeneralization of this fracton phase, which we introduce. We describe the rich\nphase structure of our layered $Z_{N}$ system. By invoking a lattice duality,\nwe demonstrate that when $N \\ge 5$, there is an intermediate phase that appears\nbetween the decoupled, layered system and the fracton topologically-ordered\nstate, which opens the possibility of a continuous transition into the fracton\ntopological phase. We conclude by presenting a solvable model, that\ninterpolates between the fracton phase and a confined phase in which the phase\ntransition is first-order.\n", "  We show for the first time in over 50 years how to correctly apply the\nKinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem diagrammatically in a next-to-leading order\nscattering process. We improve on previous works by including all initial and\nfinal state soft radiative processes, including absorption and an infinite sum\nof partially disconnected amplitudes. Crucially, we exploit the Monotone\nConvergence Theorem to prove that our delicate rearrangement of this formally\ndivergent series is correct. This rearrangement yields a factorization of the\ninfinite contribution from the initial state soft photons that then cancels in\nthe physically observable cross section. We derive the first complete\nnext-to-leading order, high-energy Rutherford elastic scattering cross section\nin the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme as an explicit example\nof our procedure.\n", "  Recurrent networks of dynamic elements frequently exhibit emergent collective\noscillations, which can display substantial regularity even when the individual\nelements are considerably noisy. How noise-induced dynamics at the local level\ncoexists with regular oscillations at the global level is still unclear. Here\nwe show that a combination of stochastic recurrence-based initiation with\ndeterministic refractoriness in an excitable network can reconcile these two\nfeatures, leading to maximum collective coherence for an intermediate noise\nlevel. We report this behavior in the slow oscillation regime exhibited by a\ncerebral cortex network under dynamical conditions resembling slow-wave sleep\nand anaesthesia. Computational analysis of a biologically realistic network\nmodel reveals that an intermediate level of background noise leads to\nquasi-regular dynamics. We verify this prediction experimentally in cortical\nslices subject to varying amounts of extracellular potassium, which modulates\nneuronal excitability and thus synaptic noise. The model also predicts that\nthis effectively regular state should exhibit noise-induced memory of the\nspatial propagation profile of the collective oscillations, which is also\nverified experimentally. Taken together, these results allow us to construe the\nenhanced regularity observed experimentally in the brain as an instance of\ncollective stochastic coherence.\n", "  The nature of Compact Groups (CGs) is investigated by comparing the\nluminosities and morphologies of CG galaxies, CG Neighbours and Isolated\ngalaxies. CGs turn out to include more early type galaxies than Isolated\ngalaxies and fewer low-luminosity galaxies. The 33 CGs with a dominant E/S0 and\nthe 30 CGs with a dominant spiral have similar LF parameters. Spiral dominated\nCGs have fewer galaxies at high and low luminosity in comparison with their\nNeighbours, while E-S0 dominated CGs seem to lack only faint galaxies when\ncompared to their Neighbours. Ellipticals which are the dominant galaxy of a CG\nare also brighter than all their Neighbours, while this holds true for only\nhalf of the dominant spirals and S0s. Relations linking the number of\nNeighbours of dominant E-S0s to the luminosity of E-S0s and to the difference\nbetween the first and the second ranked CG members do suggest a link between\nthe formation of bright early-type galaxies and the presence of a group-like\npotential. No similar relations are found for dominant spirals. These tentative\nresults are compatible with the assumption that CG dominant Ellipticals are\nanomalous galaxies whose formation might have been a secondary outcome during\nthe process of groups formation.\n", "  The neutralino, the lightest stable supersymmetric particle, is a strong\ntheoretical candidate for the missing astronomical ``dark matter''. A profusion\nof such neutralinos can accumulate near the Sun when they lose energy upon\nscattering and are gravitationally captured. Pair-annihilations of those\nneutralinos may produce very high energy (VHE, above $100 GeV$) gamma-rays.\n  Milagro is an air shower array which uses the water Cherenkov technique to\ndetect extensive air showers and is capable of observing VHE gamma-rays from\nthe direction of the Sun with an angular resolution of $0.75^{\\circ}$. Analysis\nof Milagro data with an exposure to the Sun of 1165 hours presents the first\nattempt to detect TeV gamma-rays produced by annihilating neutralinos captured\nby the Solar system and shows no statistically significant signal. Resulting\nlimits that can be set on gamma-ray flux due to near-Solar neutralino\nannihilations and on neutralino cross-section are presented.\n", "  We present a survey of the photometric and kinematic properties of 39 nearby,\nnearly face-on disk galaxies. Our approach exploits echelle-resolution\nintegral-field spectroscopy of the H-alpha regions, obtained with DensePak on\nthe WIYN 3.5m telescope Bench Spectrograph. This data is complemented by HI\nline-profiles observed with the Nancay radio telescope for 25 of these sample\ngalaxies. Twelve additional line-widths are available for sample galaxies from\nthe literature. In this paper, we introduce the goals of this survey, define\nthe sample selection algorithm, and amass the integral field spectroscopic data\nand HI line-widths. We establish spatially-integrated H-alpha line-widths for\nthe sample. We test the veracity of these spatially-integrated line profiles by\nconvolving narrow-band imaging data with velocity field information for one of\nthe sample galaxies, PGC 38268, and also by comparing to HI line profiles. We\nfind HI and H-alpha line profiles to be similar in width but different in\nshape, indicating we are observing different spatial distributions of ionized\nand neutral gas in largely axisymmetric systems with flat outer\nrotation-curves. We also find vertical velocity dispersions of the ionized disk\ngas within several disk scale-lengths have a median value of 18 km/s and an 80%\nrange of 12-26 km/s. This is only a factor of ~2 larger than what is observed\nfor neutral atomic and molecular gas. With standard assumptions for intrinsic\nand thermal broadening for H-alpha, this translates into a factor of three\nrange in turbulent velocities, between 8 and 25 km/s.\n", "  We have found that the bulge of the large, nearby Sb galaxy NGC 7331 rotates\nretrograde to its disk. Analysis of spectra in the region of the near-IR Ca II\ntriplet along the major axis shows that, in the radial range between 5'' and\n~20'', the line of sight velocity distribution of the absorption lines has two\ndistinct peaks, and can be decomposed into a fast-rotating component with\nv/sigma > 3, and a slower rotating, retrograde component with v/sigma between 1\n-- 1.5. The radial surface brightness profile of the counter-rotating component\nfollows that of the bulge, obtained from a 2-dimensional bulge-disk\ndecomposition of a near-infrared K-band image, while the fast rotating\ncomponent follows the disk. At the radius where the disk starts to dominate the\nisophotes change from being considerably boxy to very disky.\n  Although a number of spiral galaxies have been found that contain cold,\ncouter-rotating disks, this is the first galaxy known to have a boxy, probably\ntriaxial, fairly warm, counter-rotating component, which is dominating in the\ncentral regions. If it is a bar seen end-on, this bar has to be thicker than\nthe disk. We find that NGC 7331, even though it is a fairly early-type spiral,\ndoes not have a conventional, co-rotating bulge. The fact that the inner\ncomponent is retrograde makes us believe that it was formed from infalling\nmaterial, in either stellar or gaseous form (e.g. Balcells & Quinn 1990).\nAnother possibility however is that the structure has been there since the\nformation of the galaxy. In this case it will be a challenge to explain the\nlarge change in orientation of the angular momentum when going outward\nradially.\n", "  The distance to NGC 7331 has been derived from Cepheid variables observed\nwith HST/WFPC2, as part of the Extragalactic Distance Scale Key Project.\nMulti-epoch exposures in F555W (V) and F814W (I), with photometry derived\nindependently from DoPHOT and DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME programs, were used to detect a\ntotal of 13 reliable Cepheids, with periods between 11 and 42 days. The\nrelative distance moduli between NGC 7331 and the LMC, imply an extinction to\nNGC 7331 of A_V = 0.47+-0.15 mag, and an extinction-corrected distance modulus\nto NGC 7331 of 30.89+-0.14(random) mag, equivalent to a distance of 15.1 Mpc.\nThere are additional systematic uncertainties in the distance modulus of +-0.12\nmag due to the calibration of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, and a\nsystematic offset of +0.05+-0.04 mag if we applied the metallicity correction\ninferred from the M101 results of Kennicutt et al 1998.\n", "  The power-law disks are a family of infinitesimally thin, axisymmetric\nstellar disks of infinite extent. The rotation curve can be rising, falling or\nflat. The self-consistent power-law disks are scale-free, so that all physical\nquantities vary as a power of radius. They possess simple equilibrium\ndistribution functions depending on the two classical integrals, energy and\nangular momentum. While maintaining the scale-free equilibrium force law, the\npower-law disks can be transformed into cut-out disks by preventing stars close\nto the origin (and sometimes also at large radii) from participating in any\ndisturbance. This paper derives the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation for\nthe in-plane normal modes in the self-consistent and the cut-out power-law\ndisks. This is done by linearising the collisionless Boltzmann equation to find\nthe response density corresponding to any imposed density and potential. The\nnormal modes -- that is, the self-consistent modes of oscillation -- are found\nby requiring the imposed density to equal the response density. In practice,\nthis scheme is implemented in Fourier space, by decomposing both imposed and\nresponse densities in logarithmic spirals. The Fredholm integral equation then\nrelates the transform of the imposed density to the transform of the response\ndensity. Numerical strategies to solve the integral equation and to isolate the\ngrowth rates and the pattern speeds of the normal modes are discussed.\n", "  We have obtained optical CCD spectroscopy along the major axes of 22 nearby\nspiral galaxies of Sb and Sc types in order to analyze their rotation curves.\nBy subtracting the stellar continuum emission, we have obtained position\nvelocity (PV) diagrams of the H alpha and [NII] lines. We point out that the H\nalphaline is often superposed by a broad stellar absorption feature (Balmer\nwind) in the nuclear regions, and, therefore, the [NII] line is a better tracer\nof kinematics in the central a few hundred pc regions. By applying the\nenvelope-tracing technique to the H alpha and [NII] PV diagrams, we have\nderived nucleus-to-disk rotation curves of the observed galaxies. The rotation\ncurves rise steeply within the central a few hundred parsecs, indicating\nrapidly rotating nuclear disk and mass concentration near the nucleus. [For\nmore rotation curves : http://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/]\n", "  In order to test the reliability of determinations of the shapes of galaxies'\ndark matter halos, we have made such measurements for the Milky Way by two\nindependent methods, which make use of the stellar kinematics in the solar\nneighbourhood and the observed flaring of the Galactic HI layer to estimate the\nflattening of the Galactic dark halo. These techniques are found to produce a\nconsistent estimate for the halo shape, with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio\nof q ~ 0.8, but only if one adopts somewhat non-standard values for the\ndistance to the Galactic centre, R_0, and the local Galactic rotation speed,\nTheta_0. For consistency, one requires values of R_0 < 7.6 kpc and Theta_0 <\n190 km/s. Although differing significantly from the current IAU-sanctioned\nvalues, these upper limits are consistent with all existing observational\nconstraints. If future measurements confirm these lower values for the Galactic\nconstants, then the validity of the gas layer flaring method will be confirmed.\nFurther, dark matter candidates such as cold molecular gas and massive decaying\nneutrinos, which predict very flat dark halos with q < 0.2, will be ruled out.\nConversely, if the Galactic constants were found to be close to the more\nconventional values, then there would have to be some systematic error in the\nmethods for measuring dark halo shapes, so the existing modeling techniques\nwould have to be viewed with some scepticism.\n", "  We analyse the flat behaviour of the rotational curves in some galaxies in\nthe framework of a dilatonic, current-carrying string. We determine the\nexpression of the tangential velocity of test objects following a stable\ncircular equatorial orbit in this spacetime.\n", "  The time evolution of initially formed large amplitude bubble of disoriented\nchiral condensate (DCC) is studied. It is found that the evolution of this\nobject may have a relatively long pre-decay stage. Simple explanation of such\ndelay of the DCC bubble decay is given. This delay is related to the existence\nof the approximate solutions of multi-soliton type of the corresponding radial\nsine-Gordon equation in (3+1) dimensions at large bubble radius.\n", "  The process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetric\nmodel is studied both in effective Lagrangian approximation and by numerical\nsolving of the exact classical field problem. For small initial velocities we\nfind that the walls interaction looks like elastic reflection with some delay.\nIt is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall may\nbe considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable.\n", "  We study the time evolution of configurations in the form of two parallel\ndomain walls moving towards each other in a supersymmetric field model. The\nconfigurations involved are not BPS-saturated. It is found that for such\ncollisions there exists some critical value $v_{cr}\\approx0.9120$ of the\ninitial velocity v_i of the walls. At v_i<v_{cr} we observed reflection, that\nwas not followed by change of vacuum states sequence. In collisions with\nv_i>v_{cr} the sequence of vacuum states changes. The results of the numerical\nsimulations are in agreement with \"potential\" consideration.\n", "  We investigate the power of quantum computers when they are required to\nreturn an answer that is guaranteed to be correct after a time that is\nupper-bounded by a polynomial in the worst case. We show that a natural\ngeneralization of Simon's problem can be solved in this way, whereas previous\nalgorithms required quantum polynomial time in the expected sense only, without\nupper bounds on the worst-case running time. This is achieved by generalizing\nboth Simon's and Grover's algorithms and combining them in a novel way. It\nfollows that there is a decision problem that can be solved in exact quantum\npolynomial time, which would require expected exponential time on any classical\nbounded-error probabilistic computer if the data is supplied as a black box.\n"]}
