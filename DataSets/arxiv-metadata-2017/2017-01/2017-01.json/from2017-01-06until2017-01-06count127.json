But\nthe required $N$-photon detection usually renders these schemes impractical. To\novercome this limitation, recently, so-called optical centroid measurements\n(OCM) have been proposed which replace the multi-photon detectors by an array\nof single-photon detectors. Complementary to the existing approximate\nanalytical results, we explore the approach using numerical experiments by\nsampling and analyzing detection events from the initial state wave function.\nThis allows us to quantitatively study the approach also beyond the constraints\nset by the approximate analytical treatment, to compare different detection\nstrategies, and to analyze other classes of input states.\n", "  Entanglement generation in microcavity exciton-polaritons is an interesting\napplication of the peculiar properties of these half-light/half-matter\nquasiparticles. In this paper we theoretically investigate their luminescence\ndynamics and entanglement formation in single, double, and triple cavities. We\nderive general expressions and selection rules for polariton-polariton\nscattering. We evaluate a number of possible parametric scattering schemes in\nterms of entanglement, and identify the ones that are experimentally most\npromising.\n", "  We propose and theoretically analyze a new scheme for generating\nhyper-entangled photon pairs in a system of polaritons in coupled planar\nmicrocavities. Starting from a microscopic model, we evaluate the relevant\nparametric scattering processes and numerically simulate the phonon-induced\nnoise background under continuous-wave excitation. Our results show that,\ncompared to other polariton entanglement proposals, our scheme enables the\ngeneration of photon pairs that are entangled in both path and polarization\ndegrees of freedom, and simultaneously leads to a strong reduction of the\nphotoluminesence noise background. This can significantly improve the fidelity\nof the entangled photon pairs under realistic experimental conditions.\n", "  The current status of various thermal and statistical descriptions of\nparticle production in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions experiments\nis presented in detail. We discuss the formulation of various types of thermal\nmodels of a hot and dense hadron gas (HG) and the methods incorporated in\nimplementing the interactions between hadrons. We first obtain the\nparameterization of center-of-mass energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) in terms of\ntemperature ($T$) and baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) obtained by analyzing\nthe particle ratios at the freeze-out over a broad energy range from the lowest\nAlternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) energy to the highest Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies. The results of various thermal models\ntogether with the experimental results for the various ratios of yields of\nproduced hadrons are then compared. We have derived some new universal\nconditions emerging at the chemical freeze-out of HG fireball which demonstrate\nthe independence with respect to the energy as well as the structure of the\nnuclei used in the collision. Further, we perform the calculation of various\ntransport properties of HG such as shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio\n($\\eta/s$) etc. using thermal model and compare with the results of other\nmodels. We also present the calculation of the rapidity as well as transverse\nmass spectra of various hadrons in the thermal HG model. The purpose of this\nreview article is to organize and summarize the experimental data obtained in\nvarious experiments with heavy-ion collisions and then to examine and analyze\nthem using thermal models so that a firm conclusion regarding the formation of\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) can be obtained.\n", "  In this paper we consider a conservative discretization of the\ntwo-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. We propose an\nextension of Arakawa's classical finite difference scheme for fluid flow in the\nvorticity-stream function formulation to a high order discontinuous Galerkin\napproximation. In addition, we show numerical simulations that demonstrate the\naccuracy of the scheme and verify the conservation properties, which are\nessential for long time integration. Furthermore, we discuss the massively\nparallel implementation on graphic processing units.\n", "  A new splitting is proposed for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell system. This\nsplitting is based on a decomposition of the Hamiltonian of the Vlasov-Maxwell\nsystem and allows for the construction of arbitrary high order methods by\ncomposition (independent of the specific deterministic method used for the\ndiscretization of the phase space). Moreover, we show that for a spectral\nmethod in space this scheme satisfies Poisson's equation without explicitly\nsolving it. Finally, we present some examples in the context of the time\nevolution of an electromagnetic plasma instability which emphasizes the\nexcellent behavior of the new splitting compared to methods from the\nliterature.\n", "  In this paper we propose a strategy to suppress the recurrence effect present\nin grid-based Vlasov solvers. This method is formulated by introducing a cutoff\nfrequency in Fourier space. Since this cutoff only has to be performed after a\nnumber of time steps, the scheme can be implemented efficiently and can\nrelatively easily be incorporated into existing Vlasov solvers. Furthermore,\nthe scheme proposed retains the advantage of grid-based methods in that high\naccuracy can be achieved. This is due to the fact that in contrast to the\nscheme proposed by Abbasi et al. no statistical noise is introduced into the\nsimulation. We will illustrate the utility of the method proposed by performing\na number of numerical simulations, including the plasma echo phenomenon, using\na discontinuous Galerkin approximation in space and a Strang splitting based\ntime integration.\n", "  We show that it is possible for the so-called weak locking capacity of a\nquantum channel [Guha et al., PRX 4:011016, 2014] to be much larger than its\nprivate capacity. Both reflect different ways of capturing the notion of\nreliable communication via a quantum system while leaking almost no information\nto an eavesdropper; the difference is that the latter imposes an intrinsically\nquantum security criterion whereas the former requires only a weaker, classical\ncondition. The channels for which this separation is most straightforward to\nestablish are the complementary channels of classical-quantum (cq-)channels,\nand hence a subclass of Hadamard channels. We also prove that certain symmetric\nchannels (related to photon number splitting) have positive weak locking\ncapacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared secret, whereas\ntheir private capacity is zero.\n  These findings are powerful illustrations of the difference between two\napparently natural notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to\nquantum key distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible\ninformation, contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum\nnature of the eavesdropper's information.\n  Assuming an additivity conjecture for constrained minimum output Renyi\nentropies, the techniques of the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula\nfor the weak locking capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a\ngeneral upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels. Furthermore, still\nassuming this additivity conjecture, this upper bound is given an operational\ninterpretation for general channels as the maximum weak locking capacity of the\nchannel activated by a suitable noiseless channel.\n", "  We use a combination of dynamical mean-field model calculations and LDA+U\nmaterial specific calculations to investigate the low temperature phase\ntransition in the compounds from the (Pr$_{1-y}$R$_y$)$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$CoO$_3$\n(R=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Y) family (PCCO). The transition, marked by a sharp peak\nin the specific heat, leads to an exponential increase of dc resistivity and a\ndrop of the magnetic susceptibility, but no order parameter has been identified\nyet. We show that condensation of spin-triplet, atomic-size excitons provides a\nconsistent explanation of the observed physics. In particular, it explains the\nexchange splitting on the Pr sites and the simultaneous Pr valence transition.\nThe excitonic condensation in PCCO is an example of a general behavior expected\nin certain systems in the proximity of a spin-state transition.\n", "  We consider the Dirac equation with an external Yang-Mills gauge field in a\nhomogeneous space with an invariant metric. The Yang-Mills fields for which the\nmotion group of the space serves as the symmetry group for the Dirac equation\nare found by comparison of the Dirac equation with an invariant matrix\ndifferential operator of the first order. General constructions are illustrated\nby the example of de Sitter space. The eigenfunctions and the corresponding\neigenvalues for the Dirac equation are obtained in the space\n$\\mathbb{R}^2\\times \\mathbb{S}^2$ by a noncommutative integration method.\n", "  We present an efficient method for the characterization of two coupled\ndiscrete quantum systems, one of which can be controlled and measured. For two\nsystems with transition frequencies $\\omega_q$, $\\omega_r$, and coupling\nstrength $g$ we show how to obtain estimates of $g$ and $\\omega_r$ whose error\ndecreases exponentially in the number of measurement shots rather than as a\npower law expected in simple approaches. Our algorithm can thereby identify $g$\nand $\\omega_r$ simultaneously with high precision in a few hundred measurement\nshots. This is achieved by adapting measurement settings upon data as it is\ncollected. We also introduce a method to eliminate erroneous estimates with\nsmall overhead. Our algorithm is robust against the presence of relaxation and\ntypical noise. Our results are applicable to many candidate technologies for\nquantum computation, in particular, for the characterization of spurious\ntwo-level systems in superconducting qubits or stripline resonators.\n", "  Using the infinite density matrix renormalization group method on an infinite\ncylinder geometry, we characterize the $1/3$ fractional Chern insulator state\nin the Haldane honeycomb lattice model at $\\nu=1/3$ filling of the lowest band\nand check its stability. We investigate the chiral and topological properties\nof this state through (i) its Hall conductivity, (ii) the topological\nentanglement entropy, (iii) the $U(1)$ charge spectral flow of the many body\nentanglement spectrum, and (iv) the charge of the anyons. In contrast to\nnumerical methods restricted to small finite sizes, the infinite cylinder\ngeometry allows us to access and characterize directly the metal to fractional\nChern insulator transition. We find indications it is first order and no\nevidence of other competing phases. Since our approach does not rely on any\nband or subspace projection, we are able to prove the stability of the\nfractional state in the presence of interactions exceeding the band gap, as has\nbeen suggested in the literature. As a by-product we discuss the signatures of\nChern insulators within this technique.\n", "  We consider a splitting approach for the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation\nwith periodic boundary conditions and show that the necessary interpolation\nprocedure can be efficiently implemented. The error made by this numerical\nscheme is compared to exponential integrators which have been shown in Klein\nand Roidot (SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2011) to perform best for stiff solutions of\nthe Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation. Since many classic high order splitting\nmethods do not perform well, we propose a stable extrapolation method in order\nto construct an efficient numerical scheme of order four. In addition, the\nconservation properties and the possibility of order reduction for certain\ninitial values for the numerical schemes under consideration is investigated.\n", "  For diffusion-reaction equations employing a splitting procedure is\nattractive as it reduces the computational demand and facilitates a parallel\nimplementation. Moreover, it opens up the possibility to construct second-order\nintegrators that preserve positivity. However, for boundary conditions that are\nneither periodic nor of homogeneous Dirichlet type order reduction limits its\nusefulness. In the situation described the Strang splitting procedure is not\nmore accurate than Lie splitting. In this paper, we propose a splitting\nprocedure that, while retaining all the favorable properties of the original\nmethod, does not suffer from order reduction. We demonstrate our results by\nconducting numerical simulations in one and two space dimensions with\ninhomogeneous and time dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions. In addition, a\nmathematical rigorous convergence analysis is conducted that confirms the\nresults observed in the numerical simulations.\n", "  The recently developed semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin approach is\nused to discretize hyperbolic partial differential equations (usually first\norder equations). Since these methods are conservative, local in space, and\nable to limit numerical diffusion, they are considered a promising alternative\nto more traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes (which are usually based on\npolynomial or spline interpolation).\n  In this paper, we consider a parallel implementation of a semi-Lagrangian\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method for distributed memory systems (so-called\nclusters). Both strong and weak scaling studies are performed on the Vienna\nScientific Cluster 2 (VSC-2). In the case of weak scaling, up to 8192 cores, we\nobserve a parallel efficiency above 0.89 for both two and four dimensional\nproblems. Strong scaling results show good scalability to at least 1024 cores\n(we consider problems that can be run on a single processor in reasonable\ntime). In addition, we study the scaling of a two dimensional Vlasov--Poisson\nsolver that is implemented using the framework provided. All of the simulation\nare conducted in the context of worst case communication overhead; i.e., in a\nsetting where the CFL number increases linearly with the problem size.\n  The framework introduced in this paper facilitates a dimension independent\nimplementation (based on C++ templates) of scientific codes using both an MPI\nand a hybrid approach to parallelization. We describe the essential ingredients\nof our implementation.\n", "  The two Gamow-Teller (GT) branches connecting the double-beta decay partners\n(116Cd, 116Sn) and (150Nd, 150Sm) with the intermediate nuclei 116In and 150Pm\nare studied within a microscopic approach based on a deformed proton-neutron\nquasiparticle random-phase approximation built on a Skyrme selfconsistent mean\nfield with pairing correlations and spin-isospin residual forces. The results\nare compared with the experimental GT strength distributions extracted from\ncharge-exchange reactions. Combining the two branches, the nuclear matrix\nelements for the two-neutrino double-beta decay are evaluated and compared to\nexperimental values derived from the measured half-lives.\n", "  We show that for any graph $G$, by considering \"activation\" through the\nstrong product with another graph $H$, the relation $\\alpha(G) \\leq\n\\vartheta(G)$ between the independence number and the Lov\\'{a}sz number of $G$\ncan be made arbitrarily tight: Precisely, the inequality \\[\n  \\alpha(G \\times H) \\leq \\vartheta(G \\times H) = \\vartheta(G)\\,\\vartheta(H) \\]\nbecomes asymptotically an equality for a suitable sequence of ancillary graphs\n$H$.\n  This motivates us to look for other products of graph parameters of $G$ and\n$H$ on the right hand side of the above relation. For instance, a result of\nRosenfeld and Hales states that \\[\n  \\alpha(G \\times H) \\leq \\alpha^*(G)\\,\\alpha(H), \\] with the fractional\npacking number $\\alpha^*(G)$, and for every $G$ there exists $H$ that makes the\nabove an equality; conversely, for every graph $H$ there is a $G$ that attains\nequality.\n  These findings constitute some sort of duality of graph parameters, mediated\nthrough the independence number, under which $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha^*$ are dual\nto each other, and the Lov\\'{a}sz number $\\vartheta$ is self-dual. We also show\nduality of Schrijver's and Szegedy's variants $\\vartheta^-$ and $\\vartheta^+$\nof the Lov\\'{a}sz number, and explore analogous notions for the chromatic\nnumber under strong and disjunctive graph products.\n", "  Expectation values of powers of the radial coordinate in arbitrary hydrogen\nstates are given, in the quantum case, by an integral involving the associated\nLaguerre function. The method of brackets is used to evaluate the integral in\nclosed-form and to produce an expression for this average value as a finite\nsum.\n", "  High fidelity entanglement of an on-chip array of spin qubits poses many\nchallenges. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can ease some of these challenges by\nenabling long-ranged entanglement via electric dipole-dipole interactions,\nmicrowave photons, or phonons. However, SOC exposes conventional spin qubits to\ndecoherence from electrical noise. Here we propose an acceptor-based spin-orbit\nqubit in silicon offering long-range entanglement at a sweet spot where the\nqubit is protected from electrical noise. The qubit relies on quadrupolar SOC\nwith the interface and gate potentials. As required for surface codes, $10^5$\nelectrically mediated single-qubit and $10^4$ dipole-dipole mediated two-qubit\ngates are possible in the predicted spin lifetime. Moreover, circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics with single spins is feasible, including dispersive readout,\ncavity-mediated entanglement, and spin-photon entanglement. An industrially\nrelevant silicon-based platform is employed.\n", "  This brief report is an extension of our recent studies of $\\Psi$ and\n$\\Upsilon$ production cross sections in proton-proton collisions with\nE=$\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV to E=5 and E=14 TeV, using the mixed heavy quark hybrid\ntheory in which the $\\Psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ are 50\\% hybrid states. Also,\ncomparison with recent experiments at E=7 TeV are used to test the mixed heavy\nhybrid theory.\n", "  Integration of the Dirac equation with an external electromagnetic field is\nexplored in the framework of the method of separation of variables and of the\nmethod of noncommutative integration. We have found a new type of solutions\nthat are not obtained by separation of variables for several external\nelectromagnetic fields. We have considered an example of crossed electric and\nmagnetic fields of a special type for which the Dirac equation admits a\nnonlocal symmetry operator\n", "  We study asymptotically flat space-times in 3 dimensions for Einstein gravity\nnear future null infinity and show that the boundary is described by Carrollian\ngeometry. This is used to add sources to the BMS gauge corresponding to a\nnon-trivial boundary metric in the sense of Carrollian geometry. We then solve\nthe Einstein equations in a derivative expansion and derive a general set of\nequations that take the form of Ward identities. Next, it is shown that there\nis a well-posed variational problem at future null infinity without the need to\nadd any boundary term. By varying the on-shell action with respect to the\nmetric data of the boundary Carrollian geometry we are able to define a\nboundary energy-momentum tensor at future null infinity. We show that its\ndiffeomorphism Ward identity is compatible with Einstein's equations. There is\nanother Ward identity that states that the energy flux vanishes. It is this\nfact that is responsible for the enhancement of global symmetries to the full\nBMS$_3$ algebra when we are dealing with constant boundary sources. Using a\nnotion of generalized conformal boundary Killing vector we can construct all\nconserved BMS$_3$ currents from the boundary energy-momentum tensor.\n", "  We present an updated status of the EDGE project, which is a survey of 125\nlocal galaxies in the $^{12}$CO($1-0$) and $^{13}$CO($1-0$) lines. We combine\nthe molecular data of the EDGE survey with the stellar and ionized gas maps of\nthe CALIFA survey to give a comprehensive view of the dependence of the star\nformation efficiency, or equivalently, the molecular gas depletion time, on\nvarious local environments, such as the stellar surface density, metallicity,\nand radius from the galaxy center. This study will provide insight into the\nparameters that drive the star formation efficiency in galaxies at $z \\sim 0$.\n", "  Any quantum resource theory is based on free states and free operations,\ni.e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. We propose here the framework of genuine quantum coherence. This\napproach is based on a simple principle: we demand that a genuinely incoherent\noperation preserves all incoherent states. This framework captures coherence\nunder additional constrains such as energy preservation and all genuinely\nincoherent operations are incoherent regardless of their particular\nexperimental realization. We also introduce the full class of operations with\nthis property, which we call fully incoherent. We analyze in detail the\nmathematical structure of these classes and also study possible state\ntransformations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited,\neven in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does not have a\nunique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all other states\ncan be created deterministically with the free operations. This suggests that\nany reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free\noperations which can potentially create coherence in some experimental\nrealization.\n", "  We determine the accuracy of galaxy redshift distributions as estimated from\nphotometric redshift probability distributions $p(z)$. Our method utilises\nmeasurements of the angular cross-correlation between photometric galaxies and\nan overlapping sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We describe the\nredshift leakage from a galaxy photometric redshift bin $j$ into a\nspectroscopic redshift bin $i$ using the sum of the $p(z)$ for the galaxies\nresiding in bin $j$. We can then predict the angular cross-correlation between\nphotometric and spectroscopic galaxies due to intrinsic galaxy clustering when\n$i \\neq j$ as a function of the measured angular cross-correlation when $i=j$.\nWe also account for enhanced clustering arising from lensing magnification\nusing a halo model. The comparison of this prediction with the measured signal\nprovides a consistency check on the validity of using the summed $p(z)$ to\ndetermine galaxy redshift distributions in cosmological analyses, as advocated\nby the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We present an\nanalysis of the photometric redshifts measured by CFHTLenS, which overlaps the\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We also analyse the\nRed-sequence Cluster Lensing Survey (RCSLenS), which overlaps both BOSS and the\nWiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We find that the summed $p(z)$ from both surveys\nare generally biased with respect to the true underlying distributions. If\nunaccounted for, this bias would lead to errors in cosmological parameter\nestimation from CFHTLenS by less than $\\sim 4\\%$. For photometric redshift bins\nwhich spatially overlap in 3-D with our spectroscopic sample, we determine\nredshift bias corrections which can be used in future cosmological analyses\nthat rely on accurate galaxy redshift distributions.\n", "  Splitting methods constitute a well-established class of numerical schemes\nfor the time integration of partial differential equations. Their main\nadvantages over more traditional schemes are computational efficiency and\nsuperior geometric properties. In the presence of non-trivial boundary\nconditions, however, splitting methods usually suffer from order reduction and\nsome additional loss of accuracy. For diffusion-reaction equations with\ninhomogeneous oblique boundary conditions, a modification of the classic\nsecond-order Strang splitting is proposed that successfully resolves the\nproblem of order reduction. The same correction also improves the accuracy of\nthe classic first-order Lie splitting. The proposed modification only depends\non the available boundary data and, in the case of non Dirichlet boundary\nconditions, on the computed numerical solution. Consequently, this modification\ncan be implemented in an efficient way, which makes the modified splitting\nschemes superior to their classic versions. The framework employed in our error\nanalysis also allows us to explain the fractional orders of convergence that\nare often encountered for classic Strang splitting. Numerical experiments that\nillustrate the theory are provided.\n", "  Observables are believed that they must be Hermitian in quantum theory. Based\non the obviously physical fact that only eigenstates of observable and its\ncorresponding probabilities, i.e., spectrum distribution of observable are\nactually observed, we argue that observables need not necessarily to be\nHermitian. More generally, observables should be reformulated as normal\noperators including Hermitian operators as a subclass. This reformulation is\nconsistent with the quantum theory currently used and does not change any\nphysical results. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is taken as\nan example to show that our opinion does not conflict with conventional quantum\ntheory and gives the same physical results. Reformulation of observables as\nnormal operators not only coincides with the physical facts but also will\ndeepen our understanding of measurement in quantum theory.\n", "  The $n$-species totally asymmetric zero range process ($n$-TAZRP) on\none-dimensional periodic chain studied recently by the authors is a continuous\ntime Markov process where arbitrary number of particles can occupy the same\nsites and hop to the adjacent sites only in one direction with a priority\nconstraint according to their species. In this paper we introduce an\n$n$-parameter generalization of the $n$-TAZRP having inhomogeneous transition\nrate. The steady state probability is obtained in a matrix product form and\nalso by an algorithm related to combinatorial $R$.\n", "  Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk galaxies. It\nis the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full\ndistribution of stars from white dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components\nprovide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions\nof years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L-star) barred spiral with a central\nbox/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global\nproperties, it falls in the sparsely populated \"green valley\" region of the\ngalaxy colour-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural\nand kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as\ndirections for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a\nfundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can\nonly be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on\nsuch observations.\n", "  Single phase cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) nanoparticles of a controlled size\n(~ 6 nm) exhibiting superparamagnetic properties have been synthesized by\nhydrothermal technique using oleic acid (OA) as surfactant. The oleic acid\ncoated CFO nanoparticles are stable in non-polar organic media, such as hexane\nbut are not well dispersible in water. The surface of these snanoparticles has\nbeen further modified by citric acid using ligand exchange process, which makes\nCFO nanoparticles more stable colloidal solution in water. Citric acid coated\nCFO nanoparticles exhibits high dispersibility in water, high zeta potential,\nvery low coercivity and moderate saturation magnetization. Biocompatibility of\nthese CFO nanoparticles is demonstrated through cytotoxicity test in L929 cell\nline.\n", "  We consider the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell (RVM) equations in the limit\nwhen the light velocity $c$ goes to infinity. In this regime, the RVM system\nconverges towards the Vlasov--Poisson system and the aim of this paper is to\nconstruct asymptotic preserving numerical schemes that are robust with respect\nto this limit. Our approach relies on a time splitting approach for the RVM\nsystem employing an implicit time integrator for Maxwell's equations in order\nto damp the higher and higher frequencies present in the numerical solution. A\nnumber of numerical simulations are conducted in order to investigate the\nperformances of our numerical scheme both in the relativistic as well as in the\nclassical limit regime. In addition, we derive the dispersion relation of the\nWeibel instability for the continuous and the discretized problem.\n", "  We prove that the fixed points of the curved 3-body problem and their\nassociated relative equilibria are Lyapunov stable if the solutions are\nrestricted to $\\mathbb S^1$, but unstable if the bodies are considered in\n$\\mathbb S^2$.\n", "  It is a widely accepted fact that the computational capability of recurrent\nneural networks is maximized on the so-called \"edge of criticality\". Once the\nnetwork operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific\napplication both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term\nmemory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly\ninfluenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,\napplication-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still\nmissing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a\ntheoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for\ndetermining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven\nthat Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in\nsuch critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to\ncompute and either requires the probability density function or the conditional\ndependence of the system states with respect to the model parameters. The paper\ntakes advantage of a recently-developed non-parametric estimator of the Fisher\ninformation matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of\necho state networks, a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered\ncontrol parameters, which indirectly affect the echo state network performance,\nare explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality\nand, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance.\nExperimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "  With the large progress in searches for dark matter (DM) particles with\nindirect and direct methods, we develop a numerical tool that enables fast\ncalculations of the likelihoods of specified DM particle models given a number\nof observational data, such as charged cosmic rays from space-borne experiments\n(e.g., PAMELA, AMS-02), gamma-rays from the Fermi space telescope, and\nunderground direct detection experiments. The purpose of this tool --- LikeDM,\nlikelihood calculator for dark matter detection --- is to bridge the gap\nbetween a particle model of DM and the observational data. The intermediate\nsteps between these two, including the astrophysical backgrounds, the\npropagation of charged particles, the analysis of Fermi gamma-ray data, as well\nas the DM velocity distribution and the nuclear form factor, have been dealt\nwith in the code. We release the first version (v1.0) focusing on the\nconstraints from indirect detection of DM with charged cosmic and gamma rays.\nDirect detection will be implemented in the next version. This manual describes\nthe framework, usage, and related physics of the code. The code LikeDM can be\ndownload from https://likedm.hepforge.org/\n", "  Quantum steering refers to the non-classical correlations that can be\nobserved between the outcomes of measurements applied on half of an entangled\nstate and the resulting post-measured states that are left with the other\nparty. From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an\nentanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised\nmeasurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that\nlies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement.\nMoreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum\ninformation protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted.\nBecause of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an\noverview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite\nprogramming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to\naddress a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and\napplications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are\nnot directly related to semidefinite programming. Finally, we make available a\ncollection of semidefinite programming codes that can be used to study the\ntopics discussed in this article\n", "  The infrared dynamics of a light, minimally coupled scalar field in de Sitter\nspacetime with Ricci curvature $R=12H$, averaged over horizon sized regions of\nphysical volume $V_H=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{H}\\right)^3$, can be\ninterpreted as Brownian motion in a medium with de Sitter temperature\n$T_{DS}=\\frac{\\hbar H}{2\\pi}$. We demonstrate this by directly deriving the\neffective action of scalar field fluctuations with wavelengths larger than the\nde Sitter curvature radius and generalizing Starobinsky's seminal results on\nstochastic inflation. The effective action describes stochastic dynamics and\nthe fluctuating force drives the field to an equilibrium characterized by a\nthermal Gibbs distribution at temperature $T_{DS}$ which corresponds to a de\nSitter invariant state. Hence, approach towards this state can be interpreted\nas thermalization. We show that the stochastic kinetic energy of the\ncoarse-grained description corresponds to the norm of $\\partial_\\mu\\phi$ and\ntakes a well defined value per horizon volume $\\frac{1}{2}\\langle\n\\left(\\nabla\\phi\\right)^2\\rangle = - \\frac{1}{2}T_{DS}/V_H$. This approach\nallows for the non-perturbative computation of the de Sitter invariant stress\nenergy tensor $\\langle T_{\\mu\\nu} \\rangle$ for an arbitrary scalar potential.\n", "  Definitions of non-relativistic conformal transformations are considered both\nin the Newton-Cartan and in the Kaluza-Klein-type Eisenhart/Bargmann\ngeometrical frameworks. The symmetry groups that come into play are exemplified\nby the cosmological, and also the Newton-Hooke solutions of Newton's\ngravitational field equations. It is shown, in particular, that the maximal\nsymmetry group of the standard cosmological model is isomorphic to the\n13-dimensional conformal-Newton-Cartan group whose conformal-Bargmann extension\nis explicitly worked out. Attention is drawn to the appearance of independent\nspace and time dilations, in contrast with the Schr{\\\"o}dinger group or the\nConformal Galilei Algebra.\n", "  Transport measurements in inverted InAs/GaSb quantum wells reveal a giant\nspin-orbit splitting of the energy bands close to the hybridization gap. The\nsplitting results from the interplay of electron-hole mixing and spin-orbit\ncoupling, and can exceed the hybridization gap. We experimentally investigate\nthe band splitting as a function of top gate voltage for both electron-like and\nhole-like states. Unlike conventional, noninverted two-dimensional electron\ngases, the Fermi energy in InAs/GaSb can cross a single spin-resolved band,\nresulting in full spin-orbit polarization. In the fully polarized regime we\nobserve exotic transport phenomena such as quantum Hall plateaus evolving in\n$e^2/h$ steps and a non-trivial Berry phase.\n", "  We evaluate the Fermi and Gamow-Teller (GT) matrix elements in tritium\n$\\beta$-decay by including in the charge-changing weak current the corrections\nup to one loop recently derived in nuclear chiral effective field theory\n($\\chi$ EFT). The trinucleon wave functions are obtained from\nhyperspherical-harmonics solutions of the Schr\u007fodinger equation with two- and\nthree-nucleon potentials corresponding to either $\\chi$ EFT (the N3LO/N2LO\ncombination) or meson-exchange phenomenology (the AV18/UIX combination). We\nfind that contributions due to loop corrections in the axial current are, in\nrelative terms, as large as (and in some cases, dominate) those from one-pion\nexchange, which nominally occur at lower order in the power counting. We also\nprovide values for the low-energy constants multiplying the contact axial\ncurrent and three-nucleon potential, required to reproduce the experimental GT\nmatrix element and trinucleon binding energies in the N3LO/N2LO and AV18/UIX\ncalculations.\n", "  Symmetry breaking is an importance concept in nuclear physics and other\nfields of physics. Self-consistent coupling between the mean-field potential\nand the single-particle motion is a key ingredient in the unified model of Bohr\nand Mottelson, which could lead to a deformed nucleus as a consequence of\nspontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry. Some remarks on the\nfinite-size quantum effects are given. In finite nuclei, the deformation\ninevitably introduces the rotation as a symmetry-restoring collective motion\n(Anderson-Nambu-Goldstone mode), and the rotation affects the intrinsic motion.\nIn order to investigate the interplay between the rotational and intrinsic\nmotions in a variety of collective phenomena, we use the cranking prescription\ntogether with the quasiparticle random phase approximation. At low spin, the\ncoupling effect can be seen in the generalized intensity relation. A feasible\nquantization of the cranking model is presented, which provides a microscopic\napproach to the higher-order intensity relation. At high spin, the\nsemiclassical cranking prescription works well. We discuss properties of\ncollective vibrational motions under rapid rotation and/or large deformation.\nThe superdeformed shell structure plays a key role in emergence of a new soft\nmode which could lead to instability toward the $K^\\pi=1^-$ octupole shape. A\nwobbling mode of excitation, which is a clear signature of the triviality, is\ndiscussed in terms of a microscopic point of view. A crucial role played by the\nquasiparticle alignment is presented.\n", "  Weak-interaction rates, including beta-decay and electron capture, are\nstudied in several odd-A nuclei in the pf-shell region at various densities and\ntemperatures of astrophysical interest. Special attention is paid to the\nrelative contribution to these rates of thermally populated excited states in\nthe decaying nucleus. The nuclear structure involved in the weak processes is\nstudied within a quasiparticle random-phase approximation with residual\ninteractions in both particle-hole and particle-particle channels on top of a\ndeformed Skyrme Hartree-Fock mean field with pairing correlations. In the range\nof densities and temperatures considered, it is found that the total rates do\nnot differ much from the rates of the ground state fully populated. In any\ncase, the changes are not larger than the uncertainties due to the nuclear\nmodel dependence of the rates.\n", "  We report the double helicity asymmetry, $A_{LL}^{J/\\psi}$, in inclusive\n$J/\\psi$ production at forward rapidity as a function of transverse momentum\n$p_T$ and rapidity $|y|$. The data analyzed were taken during $\\sqrt{s}=510$\nGeV longitudinally polarized $p$$+$$p$ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC) in the 2013 run using the PHENIX detector. At this collision\nenergy, $J/\\psi$ particles are predominantly produced through gluon-gluon\nscatterings, thus $A_{LL}^{J/\\psi}$ is sensitive to the gluon polarization\ninside the proton. We measured $A_{LL}^{J/\\psi}$ by detecting the decay\ndaughter muon pairs $\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ within the PHENIX muon spectrometers in the\nrapidity range $1.2<|y|<2.2$. In this kinematic range, we measured the\n$A_{LL}^{J/\\psi}$ to be $0.012 \\pm 0.010$~(stat)~$\\pm$~$0.003$(syst). The\n$A_{LL}^{J/\\psi}$ can be expressed to be proportional to the product of the\ngluon polarization distributions at two distinct ranges of Bjorken $x$: one at\nmoderate range $x \\approx 0.05$ where recent RHIC data of jet and $\\pi^0$\ndouble helicity spin asymmetries have shown evidence for significant gluon\npolarization, and the other one covering the poorly known small-$x$ region $x\n\\approx 2\\times 10^{-3}$. Thus our new results could be used to further\nconstrain the gluon polarization for $x< 0.05$.\n", "  The physics of quantum mechanics is the inspiration for, and underlies,\nquantum computation. As such, one expects physical intuition to be highly\ninfluential in the understanding and design of many quantum algorithms,\nparticularly simulation of physical systems. Surprisingly, this has been\nchallenging, with current Hamiltonian simulation algorithms remaining abstract\nand often the result of sophisticated but unintuitive constructions. We contend\nthat physical intuition can lead to optimal simulation methods by showing that\na focus on simple single-qubit rotations elegantly furnishes an optimal\nalgorithm for Hamiltonian simulation, a universal problem that encapsulates all\nthe power of quantum computation. Specifically, we show that the query\ncomplexity of implementing time evolution by a $d$-sparse Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$\nfor time-interval $t$ with error $\\epsilon$ is\n$\\mathcal{O}(td\\|\\hat{H}\\|_{\\text{max}}+\\frac{\\log{(1/\\epsilon)}}{\\log{\\log{(1/\\epsilon)}}})$,\nwhich matches lower bounds in all parameters. This connection is made through\ngeneral three-step \"quantum signal processing\" methodology, comprised of (1)\ntransducing eigenvalues of $\\hat{H}$ into a single ancilla qubit, (2)\ntransforming these eigenvalues through an optimal-length sequence of\nsingle-qubit rotations, and (3) projecting this ancilla with near unity success\nprobability.\n", "  We describe a new high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector setup for\nlow-background {\\gamma}-ray spectrometry. The GeMSE facility (Germanium\nMaterial and meteorite Screening Experiment) is dedicated to material screening\nfor rare event searches in astroparticle physics as well as to the\ncharacterization of meteorites. It is installed in a medium depth (~620 m.w.e.)\nunderground laboratory in Switzerland in a multi-layer shielding and is\nequipped with an active muon veto. We have reached a very competitive integral\nbackground rate of (246$\\pm$2) counts/day (100-2700 keV) and measured a\nsensitivity of $\\sim$0.5-0.6 mBq/kg for long-lived isotopes from the\n$^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th chains in a $\\sim$1\\,kg sample screened for $\\sim$27 days.\nAn extrapolation to higher sample masses and measurement times suggests a\nmaximum sensitivity in the $\\mathcal{O}(50)$ \\mu Bq/kg range. We describe the\ndata analysis based on Bayesian statistics, background simulations, the\nefficiency calibration and first sample measurements.\n", "  In recent years, the use of integrated technologies for applications in the\nfield of quantum information processing and communications has made great\nprogress. The resulting devices feature valuable characteristics such as\nscalability, reproducibility, low cost and interconnectivity, and have the\npotential to revolutionize our computation and communication practices in the\nfuture, much in the way that electronic integrated circuits have drastically\ntransformed our information processing capacities since the last century. Among\nthe multiple applications of integrated quantum technologies, this review will\nfocus on typical components of quantum communication systems and on overall\nintegrated system operation characteristics. We are interested in particular in\nthe use of photonic integration platforms for developing devices necessary in\nquantum communications, including sources, detectors and both passive and\nactive optical elements. We also illustrate the challenges associated with\nperforming quantum communications on chip, by using the case study of quantum\nkey distribution - the most advanced application of quantum information\nscience. We conclude with promising perspectives in this field.\n", "  We study the suppression of qubit dephasing through Uhrig dynamical\ndecoupling (UDD) in nontrivial environments modeled within the spin-boson\nformalism. In particular, we address the case of (i) a qubit coupled to a\nbosonic bath with power-law spectral density, and (ii) a qubit coupled to a\nsingle harmonic oscillator that dissipates energy into a bosonic bath, which\nembodies an example of a structured bath for the qubit. We then model the\ninfluence of random time jitter in the UDD protocol by sorting\npulse-application times from Gaussian distributions centered at appropriate\nvalues dictated by the optimal protocol. In case (i) we find that, when few\npulses are applied and a sharp cutoff is considered, longer coherence times and\nrobust UDD performances (against random timing errors) are achieved for a\nsuper-Ohmic bath. On the other hand, when an exponential cutoff is considered a\nsuper-Ohmic bath is undesirable. In case (ii) the best scenario is obtained for\nan overdamped harmonic motion. Our study provides relevant information for the\nimplementation of optimized schemes for the protection of quantum states from\ndecoherence.\n", "  In view of real world applications of quantum information technologies, the\ncombination of miniature quantum resources with existing fibre networks is a\ncrucial issue. Among such resources, on-chip entangled photon sources play a\ncentral role for applications spanning quantum communications, computing and\nmetrology. Here, we use a semiconductor source of entangled photons operating\nat room temperature in conjunction with standard telecom components to\ndemonstrate multi-user quantum key distribution, a core protocol for securing\ncommunications in quantum networks. The source consists of an AlGaAs chip\nemitting polarization entangled photon pairs over a large bandwidth in the main\ntelecom band around 1550 nm without the use of any off-chip compensation or\ninterferometric scheme; the photon pairs are directly launched into a dense\nwavelength division multiplexer (DWDM) and secret keys are distributed between\nseveral pairs of users communicating through different channels. We achieve a\nvisibility measured after the DWDM of 87% and show long-distance key\ndistribution using a 50-km standard telecom fibre link between two network\nusers. These results illustrate a promising route to practical,\nresource-efficient implementations adapted to quantum network infrastructures.\n", "  It is usually considered that the spectrum of an optical cavity coupled to an\natomic medium does not exhibit a normal-mode splitting unless the system\nsatisfies the strong coupling condition, meaning the Rabi frequency of the\ncoherent coupling exceeds the decay rates of atom and cavity excitations. Here\nwe show that this need not be the case, but depends on the way in which the\ncoupled system is probed. Measurements of the reflection of a probe laser from\nthe input mirror of an overdamped cavity reveal an avoided crossing in the\nspectrum which is not observed when driving the atoms directly and measuring\nthe Purcell-enhanced cavity emission. We understand these observations by\nnoting a formal correspondence with electromagnetically-induced transparency of\na three-level atom in free space, where our cavity acts as the absorbing medium\nand the coupled atoms play the role of the control field.\n", "  We study the 2HDM contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and\npresent the complete two-loop result, particularly for the bosonic\ncontribution. We focus on the Aligned 2HDM, which has general Yukawa couplings\nand contains the type I, II, X, Y models as special cases. The result is\nexpressed with physical parameters: three Higgs boson masses, Yukawa couplings,\ntwo mixing angles, and one quartic potential parameter. We show that the result\ncan be split into several parts, each of which has a simple parameter\ndependence, and we document their general behavior. Taking into account\nconstraints on parameters, we find that the full 2HDM contribution to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment can accommodate the current experimental value, and\nthe complete two-loop bosonic contribution can amount to (2...4)x10^{-10}, more\nthan the future experimental uncertainty.\n", "  Polymer gels behave as soft viscoelastic solids and exhibit a generic\nnonlinear mechanical response characterized by pronounced stiffening prior to\nirreversible failure, most often through macroscopic fractures. Here, we aim at\ncapturing the latter scenario for a protein gel using a nonlinear integral\nconstitutive equation built upon ($i$) the linear viscoelastic response of the\ngel, here well described by a power-law relaxation modulus, and ($ii$) the\nnonlinear viscoelastic properties of the gel, encoded into a \"damping\nfunction\". Such formalism predicts quantitatively the gel mechanical response\nto a shear start-up experiment, up to the onset of macroscopic failure.\nMoreover, as the gel failure involves the irreversible growth of macroscopic\ncracks, we couple the latter stress response with Bailey's durability criterion\nfor brittle solids in order to predict the critical values of the stress\n$\\sigma_c$ and strain $\\gamma_c$ at the failure point, and how they scale with\nthe applied shear rate. The excellent agreement between theory and experiments\nsuggests that the crack growth in this soft viscoelastic gel is a Markovian\nprocess, and that Baileys' criterion extends well beyond hard materials such as\nmetals, glasses, or minerals.\n", "  With infrared and terahertz ellipsometry we investigated the anisotropy of\nthe infrared active phonon modes in SrTiO3 (110) single crystals in the\ntetragonal state below the so-called antiferrodistortive transition at T* = 105\nK. In particular, we show that the anisotropy of the oscillator strength of the\nso-called R-mode, which becomes weakly infrared active below T*, is a valuable\nindicator for the orientation of the structural domains. Our results reveal\nthat a mono-domain state with the tetragonal axis (c-axis) parallel to the\n[001] direction can be created by applying a moderate uniaxial stress of about\n2.3 MPa along the [1-10] direction (with a mechanical clamp). The resulting,\nintrinsic splitting of the infrared-active phonon modes is reported.\n", "  A supersymmetric extension of the Skyrme model was obtained recently, which\nconsists of only the Skyrme term in the Nambu-Goldstone (pion) sector\ncomplemented by the same number of quasi-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Scherk-Schwarz\ndimensional reduction yields a kinetic term in three or lower dimensions and a\npotential term in two dimensions, preserving supersymmetry. Euclidean solitons\n(instantons) are constructed in the supersymmetric Skyrme model. In four\ndimensions, the soliton is an instanton first found by Speight. Scherk-Schwarz\ndimensional reduction is then performed once to get a 3-dimensional theory in\nwhich a 3d Skyrmion-instanton is found and then once more to get a 2d theory in\nwhich a 2d vortex-instanton is obtained. Although the last one is a global\nvortex it has finite action in contrast to conventional theory. All of them are\nnon-BPS states breaking all supersymmetries.\n", "  We report on a new class of mechanically tunable planar metamaterials\ncomprising resonating units formed by crossed metallic strip gratings. We\nobserve a resonant response in transmission spectra of a linearly polarized\nwave passing through the system of crossed gratings. Each grating consists of\nan array of parallel metallic strips located on the top of a dielectric\nsubstrate. It is revealed that the resonant position appears to be dependent on\nthe angle of gratings crossing. It is found out both theoretically and\nexperimentally that the resonant shift on the frequency scale appears as a\nresult of increasing in the length of the resonating portion of the\nparallelogram periodic cell formed by the crossed metallic strips with\ndecreasing crossing angle and the proposed design can be used in new types of\nplanar metamaterials and filters.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamic structure factor of a strongly\ninteracting Fermi gas at the crossover from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\nsuperfluids to Bose-Einstein condensates, by developing an improved random\nphase approximation within the framework of a density functional theory - the\nso-called superfluid local density approximation. Compared with the previous\nrandom-phase-approximation studies based on the standard Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nequations, the use of the density functional theory greatly improves the\naccuracy of the equation of state at the crossover, and leads to a better\ndescription of both collective Bogoliubov-Anderson-Goldstone phonon mode and\nsingle-particle fermionic excitations at small transferred momentum. Near\nunitarity, where the s-wave scattering length diverges, we show that the\nsingle-particle excitations start to significantly contribute to the spectrum\nof dynamic structure factor once the frequency is above a threshold of the\nenergy gap at $2\\Delta$. The sharp rise in the spectrum at this threshold can\nbe utilized to measure the pairing gap $\\Delta$. Together with the sound\nvelocity determined from the phonon branch, the dynamic structure factor\nprovides us some key information of the crossover Fermi superfluid. Our\npredictions could be examined in experiments with $^{6}$Li or $^{40}$K atoms\nusing Bragg spectroscopy.\n", "  We fit the next-to-leading order unitarity conditions to the\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet model with a softly broken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In doing\nso, we alleviate the existing uncertainty on how to treat higher order\ncorrections to quartic couplings of its Higgs potential. A simplified approach\nto implementing the next-to-leading order unitarity conditions is presented.\nThese new bounds are then combined with all other relevant constraints,\nincluding the complete set of LHC Run I data. The upper $95\\%$ bounds we find\nare $4.2$ on the absolute values of the quartic couplings, and $235$ GeV ($100$\nGeV) for the mass degeneracies between the heavy Higgs particles in the type I\n(type II) scenario. In type II, we exclude an unbroken $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry\nwith a probability of $95\\%$. All fits are performed using the open-source code\nHEPfit.\n", "  Simplicity constraints play a crucial role in the construction of spin foam\nmodels, yet their effective behaviour on larger scales is scarcely explored. In\nthis article we introduce intertwiner and spin net models for the quantum group\n$\\text{SU}(2)_k \\times \\text{SU}(2)_k$, which implement the simplicity\nconstraints analogous to 4D Euclidean spin foam models, namely the\nBarrett-Crane (BC) and the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine/Freidel-Krasnov\n(EPRL/FK) model. These models are numerically coarse grained via tensor network\nrenormalization, allowing us to trace the flow of simplicity constraints to\nlarger scales. In order to perform these simulations we have substantially\nadapted tensor network algorithms, which we discuss in detail.\n  The BC and the EPRL/FK model behave very differently under coarse graining:\nWhile the unique BC intertwiner model is a fixed point and therefore\nconstitutes a 2D topological phase, BC spin net models flow away from the\ninitial simplicity constraints and converge to several different topological\nphases. Most of these phases correspond to decoupling spin foam vertices,\nhowever we find also a new phase in which this is not the case, and in which a\nnon-trivial version of the simplicity constraints holds. The coarse graining\nflow of the BC spin net models indicates furthermore that the phase transitions\nare not of second order. The EPRL/FK model by contrast reveals a far more\nintricate and complex dynamics. We observe an immediate flow away from the\noriginal simplicity constraints, however, with the truncation employed here,\nthe models generically do not converge to a fixed point.\n  The results show that the imposition of simplicity constraints can indeed\nlead to interesting and complex dynamics. Thus we will need to further develop\ncoarse graining tools to efficiently study the large scale behaviour of spin\nfoam models, in particular for the EPRL/FK model.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of many-body and band structure effects of\ninteracting Weyl semimetals (WSM). Attractive and repulsive Hubbard\ninteractions are studied within a model for a time-reversal-breaking WSM with\ntetragonal symmetry, where we can approach the limit of weakly coupled planes\nand coupled chains by varying the hopping amplitudes. Using a slab geometry, we\nemploy the variational cluster approach to describe the evolution of WSM Fermi\narc surface states as a function of interaction strength. We find spin and\ncharge density wave instabilities which can gap out Weyl nodes. We identify\nscenarios where the bulk Weyl nodes are gapped while the Fermi arcs still\npersist, hence realizing a quantum anomalous Hall state.\n", "  Potassium intercalated FeSe has been reported as a superconductor with\nsuperconducting transition temperatures ($T_{\\rm c}$'s) of 30-48 K. However,\nthere is no clear answer to identify the relationship between the surface\nmorphology, compositional ratio and its crystal structure. This report directly\nreveals the correspondence among these three characteristics in single crystals\nwith a $T_{\\rm c}$ onset of around 44 K using a micro-sampling technique.\nIsland-like parts on the surface of the crystals clearly have the\nK$_x$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ structure with perfect FeSe layers, which is formed in\nconjunction with the K$_2$Fe$_4$Se$_5$ phase. This results in the appearance of\nthe $T_{\\rm c}$ onset of 44 K.\n", "  We present a scheme, based on Gilbert's algorithm for quadratic minimization\n[SIAM J. Contrl., vol. 4, pp. 61-80, 1966], to prove separation between a point\nand an arbitrary convex set $S\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ via calls to an oracle\nable to perform linear optimizations over $S$. Compared to other methods, our\nscheme has almost negligible memory requirements and the number of calls to the\noptimization oracle does not depend on the dimensionality $n$ of the underlying\nspace. We study the speed of convergence of the scheme under different promises\non the shape of the set $S$ and/or the location of the point, validating the\naccuracy of our theoretical bounds with numerical examples. Finally, we present\nsome applications of the scheme in quantum information theory. There we find\nthat our algorithm out-performs existing linear programming methods for certain\nlarge scale problems, allowing us to certify nonlocality in bipartite scenarios\nwith upto $42$ measurement settings. We apply the algorithm to upper bound the\nvisibility of two-qubit Werner states, hence improving known lower bounds on\nGrothendieck's constant $K_G(3)$. Similarly, we compute new upper bounds on the\nvisibility of GHZ states and on the steerability limit of Werner states for a\nfixed number of measurement settings.\n", "  We study the two-neutrino double-beta decay in 76Ge, 116Cd, 128Te, 130Te, and\n150Nd, as well as the two Gamow-Teller branches that connect the double-beta\ndecay partners with the states in the intermediate nuclei. We use a theoretical\nmicroscopic approach based on a deformed selfconsistent mean field with Skyrme\ninteractions including pairing and spin-isospin residual forces, which are\ntreated in a proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We\ncompare our results for Gamow-Teller strength distributions with experimental\ninformation obtained from charge-exchange reactions. We also compare our\nresults for the two-neutrino double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements with\nthose extracted from the measured half-lives. Both single-state and\nlow-lying-state dominance hypotheses are analyzed theoretically and\nexperimentally making use of recent data from charge-exchange reactions and\nbeta decay of the intermediate nuclei.\n", "  NGC 7793 P13 is a variable (luminosity range ~100) ultraluminous X-ray source\n(ULX) proposed to host a stellar-mass black hole of less than 15 M$_{\\odot}$ in\na binary system with orbital period of 64 d and a 18-23 M$_{\\odot}$ B9Ia\ncompanion. Within the EXTraS project we discovered pulsations at a period of\n~0.42 s in two XMM-Newton observations of NGC 7793 P13, during which the source\nwas detected at $L_{\\mathrm{X}}\\sim2.1\\times10^{39}$ and $5\\times10^{39}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ (0.3-10 keV band). These findings unambiguously demonstrate that the\ncompact object in NGC 7793 P13 is a neutron star accreting at super-Eddington\nrates. While standard accretion models face difficulties accounting for the\npulsar X-ray luminosity, the presence of a multipolar magnetic field with $B$ ~\nfew $\\times$ 10$^{13}$ G close to the base of the accretion column appears to\nbe in agreement with the properties of the system.\n", "  I review the theoretical and phenomenological status of two- and three-body\ncharmless non-leptonic B decays, with an emphasis on factorization approaches.\nMost of the material presented here is based on talks given by the participants\nof the workshop \"Future Challenges in Non-Leptonic B Decays: Theory and\nExperiment\", held at Bad Honnef in February 2016.\n", "  An exact solution is obtained for the gravitational bending of light in\nstatic, spherically symmetric metrics which includes the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter spacetime and also the Mannheim-Kazanas metric of conformal Weyl\ngravity. From the exact solution, we obtain a small bending-angle-approximation\nfor a lens system where the source, lens and observer are co-aligned. This\nexpansion improves previous calculations where we systematically avoid\nparameter ranges that correspond to non-existent null trajectories. The linear\ncoefficient $\\gamma$ characteristic to conformal gravity is shown to contribute\nenhanced deflection compared to the angle predicted by General Relativity for\nsmall $\\gamma$.\n", "  In order to explain the reason that all the sythesised \\ce{AX2MQ6}\nchalcogenides compounds are phase-matching while isomorphic chalcogenides\ncompounds \\ce{AX4M5Q12} are not phase-matched materials. The linear optical\nproperty birefringence and non-linear optical property of $R3$ space group\ncrystals \\ce{AX2MQ6} have been calculated to compare with \\ce{AX4M5Q12}. Their\nElectron Localization Function(ELF) was calculated to show that the acentricity\nof the bonds on $sp^3$ hybridization \\ce{Q^2-} ions is the main origin of\noptical anisotropy. To quantificat the acentricity, a geometric parameter\ndihedral angle between tetrahedral undersides and xy-planes was defined. We\nfind theoretically the birefringence depend on the defined geometric parameter\nand ion radius. This relation between birefringence and structure resonalbly\nexplain the abnormal difference of birefringence of isostructural \\ce{AX2MQ6}\nand \\ce{AX4M5Q12} and useful for exploring new phase-matching IR-NLO crystals.\n", "  Results are presented of a search for heavy stable charged particles produced\nin proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV using a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 inverse femtobarns collected\nin 2015 with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The search is conducted using\nsignatures of anomalously high energy deposits in the silicon tracker and long\ntime of flight measurements by the muon system. The data are consistent with\nthe expected background, and upper limits are set on the cross sections for\nproduction of long-lived gluinos, top squarks, tau sleptons, and leptonlike\nlong-lived fermions. These upper limits are equivalently expressed as lower\nlimits on the masses of new states; the limits for gluinos, ranging up to 1610\nGeV, are the most stringent to date. Limits on the cross sections for direct\npair production of long-lived tau sleptons are also determined.\n", "  In this thesis we use various effective QCD models to investigate hot and\ndense nuclear matter created in heavy ion collisions. To characterize such\nmatter, we mainly exploit correlation functions and some of the associated\nspectral properties. We explore the vector meson current-current correlation\nfunction with and without the influence of vector interaction in\nNambu\\textendash Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and also in its Polyakov loop\nextended version (PNJL). As a spectral property we have computed the dilepton\nrate which is found to be enhanced in strongly interacting QGP (sQGP) as\ncompared to the Born rate in a weakly coupled QGP. We further consider the idea\nof entanglement between the chiral and confinement dynamics through the\nentangled PNJL (EPNJL) model and re-explore the vector spectral function and\nthe spectral property such as the dilepton production rate studied in our\nearlier effort. Because of the strong entanglement, the coupling strengths run\nwith the temperature and chemical potential. The implications of such running\non the dilepton rate have been discussed in details. The Euclidean vector\ncorrelator and the response of the conserved density fluctuations related with\nthe temporal vector correlator have also been investigated. We have considered\nboth the scenarios, i.e. presence and absence of the vector interaction. The\ninclusion of the vector interaction also brings forth some intriguing issues in\nthe fluctuation of conserved density, namely the QNS. It has been discussed in\ndetails and we try to address it using EPNJL model. We also assume the QGP to\nbe made of a non-interacting quarks, antiquarks and gluons and construct a\npartition function which is restricted by the assumption of a color singlet\nprojection to conform with the $SU(3)_c$ symmetry. This type of simple quantum\nstatistical description exhibits very interesting features, which we have\ndiscussed in details.\n", "  We present highly-excited charmonium, $D_s$ and $D$ meson spectra from\ndynamical lattice QCD calculations with light quarks corresponding to $M_{\\pi}\n\\sim 240$ MeV and compare these to previous results with $M_{\\pi} \\sim 400$\nMeV. Utilising the distillation framework, large bases of carefully constructed\ninterpolating operators and a variational procedure, we extract and reliably\nidentify the continuum spin of an extensive set of excited mesons. These\ninclude states with exotic quantum numbers which, along with a number with\nnon-exotic quantum numbers, we identify as having excited gluonic degrees of\nfreedom and interpret as hybrid mesons. Comparing the spectra at the two\ndifferent $M_\\pi$, we find only a mild light-quark mass dependence and no\nchange in the overall pattern of states.\n", "  Despite their exceptional flexibility and popularity, the Monte Carlo methods\noften suffer from slow mixing times for challenging statistical physics\nproblems. We present a general strategy to overcome this difficulty by adopting\nideas and techniques from the machine learning community. We fit the\nunnormalized probability of the physical model to a feedforward neural network\nand reinterpret the architecture as a restricted Boltzmann machine. Then,\nexploiting its feature detection ability, we utilize the restricted Boltzmann\nmachine for efficient Monte Carlo updates and to speed up the simulation of the\noriginal physical system. We implement these ideas for the Falicov-Kimball\nmodel and demonstrate improved acceptance ratio and autocorrelation time near\nthe phase transition point.\n", "  We report on a direct search for sub-GeV dark photons (A') which might be\nproduced in the reaction e^- Z \\to e^- Z A' via kinetic mixing with photons by\n100 GeV electrons incident on an active target in the NA64 experiment at the\nCERN SPS. The A's would decay invisibly into dark matter particles resulting in\nevents with large missing energy. No evidence for such decays was found with\n2.75\\cdot 10^{9} electrons on target. We set new limits on the \\gamma-A' mixing\nstrength and exclude the invisible A' with a mass < 100 MeV as an explanation\nof the muon g_\\mu-2 anomaly.\n", "  The quantum entanglement and the probability of the dynamical Lamb effect for\ntwo qubits caused by non-adiabatic fast change of the boundary conditions are\nstudied. The conditional concurrence of the qubits for each fixed number of\ncreated photons in a nonstationary cavity is obtained as a measure of the\ndynamical quantum entanglement due to the dynamical Lamb effect. We discuss the\nphysical realization of the dynamical Lamb effect, based on superconducting\nqubits.\n", "  Coronal implosions - the convergence motion of plasmas and entrained magnetic\nfield in the corona due to a reduction in magnetic pressure - can help to\nlocate and track sites of magnetic energy release or redistribution during\nsolar flares and eruptions. We report here on the analysis of a well-observed\nimplosion in the form of an arcade contraction associated with a filament\neruption, during the C3.5 flare SOL2013-06-19T07:29. A sequence of events\nincluding magnetic flux-rope instability and distortion, followed by filament\neruption and arcade implosion, lead us to conclude that the implosion arises\nfrom the transfer of magnetic energy from beneath the arcade as part of the\nglobal magnetic instability, rather than due to local magnetic energy\ndissipation in the flare. The observed net contraction of the imploding loops,\nwhich is found also in nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, reflects a\npermanent reduction of magnetic energy underneath the arcade. This event shows\nthat, in addition to resulting in expansion or eruption of overlying field,\nflux-rope instability can also simultaneously implode unopened field due to\nmagnetic energy transfer. It demonstrates the \"partial opening of the field\"\nscenario, which is one of the ways in 3D to produce a magnetic eruption without\nviolating the Aly-Sturrock hypothesis. In the framework of this observation we\nalso propose a unification of three main concepts for active region magnetic\nevolution, namely the metastable eruption model, the implosion conjecture, and\nthe standard \"CSHKP\" flare model.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the out-of-equilibrium nonlinear q-voter model with\ntwo types of susceptible voters and zealots, introduced in [EPL 113, 48001\n(2016)]. In this model, each individual supports one of two parties and is\neither a susceptible voter of type $q_1$ or $q_2$, or is an inflexible zealot.\nAt each time step, a $q_i$-susceptible voter ($i = 1,2$) consults a group of\n$q_i$ neighbors and adopts their opinion if all group members agree, while\nzealots are inflexible and never change their opinion. This model violates\ndetailed balance whenever $q_1 \\neq q_2$ and is characterized by two distinct\nregimes of low and high density of zealotry. Here, by combining analytical and\nnumerical methods, we investigate the non-equilibrium stationary state of the\nsystem in terms of its probability distribution, non-vanishing currents and\nunequal-time two-point correlation functions. We also study the switching times\nproperties of the model by exploiting an approximate mapping onto the model of\n[Phys. Rev. E 92, 012803 (2015)] that satisfies the detailed balance, and also\noutline some properties of the model near criticality.\n", "  Form factors of composite operators in the SL(2) sector of N=4 SYM theory are\nstudied up to two loops via the on-shell unitarity method. The non-compactness\nof this subsector implies the novel feature and technical challenge of an\nunlimited number of loop momenta in the integrand's numerator. At one loop, we\nderive the full minimal form factor to all orders in the dimensional\nregularisation parameter. At two loops, we construct the complete integrand for\ncomposite operators with an arbitrary number of covariant derivatives, and we\nobtain the remainder functions as well as the dilatation operator for composite\noperators with up to three covariant derivatives. The remainder functions\nreveal curious patterns suggesting a hidden maximal uniform transcendentality\nfor the full form factor. Finally, we speculate about an extension of these\npatterns to QCD.\n", "  We identify a possible mechanism of the plasmon instabilities in periodically\ngated two-dimensional electron systems with a modulated electron density\n(plasmonic crystals) under direct current. The instability occurs due to the\namplified reflection of the small density perturbations from the gated/ungated\nboundaries under the proper phase matching conditions between the crystal unit\ncells. Based on the transfer-matrix formalism, we derive the generic dispersion\nequation for the travelling plasmons in these structures. Its solution in the\nhydrodynamic limit shows that the threshold drift velocity for the instability\ncan be tuned below the plasmon phase and carrier saturation velocities, and the\nplasmon increment can exceed the collisional damping rate typical to III-V\nsemiconductors at 77 K and graphene at room temperature.\n", "  The ab initio electronic structure calculations of the Ni$_{2}$MnGa The alloy\nindicate that the orthorhombic 4O structure exhibits the lowest energy compared\nto all known martensitic structures. The 4O structure is formed by nanotwin\ndouble layers, i.e., oppositely oriented nanotwins consisting of two (101)\nlattice planes of nonmodulated martensitic structure. It exhibits the lowest\noccupation of density of states at the Fermi level. The total energy 1.98\nmeV/atom below the energy of nonmodulated martensite is achieved within\nstructural relaxation by shifting Mn and Ga atoms at the nanotwin boundaries.\nThe same atomic shift can also be found in other martensitic nanotwinned or\nmodulated structures such as 10M and 14M, which indicates the importance of the\nnanotwin double layer for the stability of these structures. Our discovery\nshows that the nanotwinning or modulation is a natural property of\nlow-temperature martensitic phases in Ni-Mn-Ga alloys.\n", "  Multiphoton processes in dense atomic vapors such as four-wave mixing or\ncoherent blue light generation are typically viewed from single-atom\nperspective. Here we study the surprisingly important effect of phase matching\nnear two-photon resonances that arises due to spatial extent of the atomic\nmedium within which the multiphoton process occurs. The non-unit refractive\nindex of the atomic vapor may inhibit generation of light in nonlinear\nprocesses, significantly shift the efficiency maxima in frequencies and\nredirect emitted beam. We present these effects on an example of four-wave\nmixing in dense rubidium vapors in a double-ladder configuration. By deriving a\nsimple theory that takes into account essential spatial properties of the\nprocess, we give precise predictions and confirm their validity in the\nexperiment. The model allows us to improve on the geometry of the experiment\nand engineer more efficient four-wave mixing.\n", "  Diffusion-limited erosion is a distinct universality class of fluctuating\ninterfaces. Although its dynamical exponent $z=1$, none of the known variants\nof conformal invariance can act as its dynamical symmetry. In $d=1$ spatial\ndimensions, its infinite-dimensional dynamic symmetry is constructed and shown\nto be isomorphic to the direct sum of three loop-Virasoro algebras, with the\nmaximal finite-dimensional sub-algebra\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\oplus\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\oplus\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe infinitesimal generators are spatially non-local and use the Riesz-Feller\nfractional derivative. Co-variant two-time response functions are derived and\nreproduce the exact solution of diffusion-limited erosion. The relationship\nwith the terrace-step-kind model of vicinal surfaces and the integrable XXZ\nchain are discussed.\n", "  The collection of a few anomalies in semileptonic $B$-decays, especially in\n$b\\rightarrow c \\tau \\bar{\\nu}$, invites to speculate about the emergence of\nsome striking new phenomena, perhaps interpretable in terms of a weakly broken\n$U(2)^n$ flavor symmetry and of leptoquark mediators. Here we aim at a partial\nUV completion of this interpretation by generalizing the minimal composite\nHiggs model to include a composite vector leptoquark as well.\n", "  These notes describe some links between the group\n$\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$, the Heisenberg group and hypercomplex\nnumbers---complex, dual and double numbers. Relations between quantum and\nclassical mechanics are clarified in this framework. In particular, classical\nmechanics can be obtained as a theory with noncommutative observables and a\nnon-zero Planck constant if we replace complex numbers in quantum mechanics by\ndual numbers. Our consideration is based on induced representations which are\nbuild from complex-/dual-/double-valued characters. Dynamic equations, rules of\nadditions of probabilities, ladder operators and uncertainty relations are\ndiscussed. Finally, we prove a Calder\\'on--Vaillancourt-type norm estimation\nfor relative convolutions.\n", "  We present an efficient post-processing method for calculating the electronic\nstructure of nanosystems based on the divide-and-conquer approach to density\nfunctional theory (DC-DFT), in which a system is divided into subsystems whose\nelectronic structure is solved separately. In this post process, the Kohn-Sham\nHamiltonian of the total system is easily derived from the orbitals and orbital\nenergies of subsystems obtained by DC-DFT without time-consuming and redundant\ncomputation. The resultant orbitals spatially extended over the total system\nare described as linear combinations of the orbitals of the subsystems. The\nsize of the Hamiltonian matrix can be much reduced from that for conventional\ncalculation, so that our method is fast and applicable to general huge systems\nfor investigating the nature of electronic states.\n", "  We report the first search for the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ glueball in $\\Upsilon(1S)$\nand $\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays with data samples of $(102\\pm2)$ million and\n$(158\\pm4)$ million events, respectively, collected with the Belle detector. No\nsignificant signals are observed in any of the proposed production modes, and\nthe 90\\% credibility level upper limits on their branching fractions in\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays are obtained. The inclusive branching\nfractions of the $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays into final states\nwith a $\\chi_{c1}$ are measured to be $\\BR(\\Upsilon(1S)\\to \\chi_{c1}+ anything)\n= (1.90\\pm 0.43(stat.)\\pm 0.14(syst.))\\times 10^{-4}$ with an improved\nprecision over prior measurements and $\\BR(\\Upsilon(2S)\\to \\chi_{c1}+ anything)\n= (2.24\\pm 0.44(stat.)\\pm 0.20(syst.))\\times 10^{-4}$ for the first time.\n", "  We studied the Dynamical Symmetry Breaking (DSB) mechanism in a\nsupersymmetric Chern-Simons theory in $\\left(2+1\\right)$ dimensions coupled to\n$N$ matter superfields in the superfield formalism. For this purpose, we\ndeveloped a mechanism to calculate the effective superpotencial\n$K_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\left(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cl}},\\alpha\\right)$, where\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is a background superfield, and $\\alpha$ a gauge-fixing\nparameter that is introduced in the quantization process. The possible\ndependence of the effective potential on the gauge parameter have been studied\nin the context of quantum field theory. We developed the formalism of the\nNielsen identities in the superfield language, which is the appropriate\nformalism to study DSB when the effective potential is gauge dependent. We also\ndiscuss how to calculate the effective superpotential via the Renormalization\nGroup Equation (RGE) from the knowledge of the renormalization group functions\nof the theory, i.e., $\\beta$ functions and anomalous dimensions $\\gamma$. We\nperform a detailed calculation of these functions at two loops, finding that\nthese do not depend on $\\alpha$, and therefore, by using the RGE, we calculate\nthe effective superpotencial $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, showing that it is also\nindependent of $\\alpha$. Then we discuss the improvement of the calculation of\n$K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by summing up leading logarithms, and we compare this\nimprovement with the one obtained in the non supersymmetric version of the\nmodel. Finally, we study the DSB finding that it is operational for all\nreasonable values of the free parameters, while the improvement obtained from\nthe RGE in general only produces a small quantitative correction in the\nresults, instead of the more dramatic qualitative change found in non\nsupersymmetric models.\n", "  Taking advantage of the large electron escape depth of soft x-ray angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy we report electronic structure measurements\nof (111)-oriented [LaNiO3/LaMnO3] superlattices and LaNiO3 epitaxial films. For\nthin films we observe a 3D Fermi surface with an electron pocket at the\nBrillouin zone center and hole pockets at the zone vertices. Superlattices with\nthick nickelate layers present a similar electronic structure. However, as the\nthickness of the LaNiO3 is reduced the superlattices become insulating. These\nheterostructures do not show a marked redistribution of spectral weight in\nmomentum space but exhibit a pseudogap of 50 meV.\n", "  A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modelling of finite-size zero\nthickness space-time modulated Huygens' metasurfaces based on Generalized Sheet\nTransition Conditions (GSTCs), is proposed and numerically demonstrated. A\ntypical all-dielectric Huygens' unit cell is taken as an example and its\nmaterial permittivity is modulated in both space and time, to emulate a\ntravelling-type spatio-temporal perturbation on the metasurface. By mapping the\npermittivity variation onto the parameters of the equivalent Lorentzian\nelectric and magnetic susceptibility densities, $\\tilde{\\chi}_\\text{ee}$ and\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_\\text{mm}$, the problem is formulated into a set of second-order\ndifferential equations in time with non-constant coefficients. The resulting\nfield solutions are then conveniently solved using an explicit\nfinite-difference technique and integrated with a Yee-cell based propagation\nregion to visualize the scattered fields taking into account the various\ndiffractive effects from the metasurface of finite size. Several examples are\nshown for both linear and space-time varying metasurfaces which are excited\nwith normally incident plane and Gaussian beams, showing detailed scattering\nfield solutions. While the time-modulated metasurface leads to the generation\nof new collinearly propagating temporal harmonics, these harmonics are\nangularly separated in space, when an additional space modulation is introduced\nin the metasurface.\n", "  Employing complementary torque magnetometry and electron spin resonance on\nsingle crystals of herbertsmithite, the closest realization to date of a\nquantum kagome antiferromagnet featuring a spin-liquid ground state, we provide\nnovel insight into different contributions to its magnetism. At low\ntemperatures, two distinct types of defects with different magnetic couplings\nto the kagome spins are found. Surprisingly, their magnetic response\ncontradicts the three-fold symmetry of the ideal kagome lattice, suggesting the\npresence of a global structural distortion that may be related to the\nestablishment of the spin-liquid ground state.\n", "  In this paper, beta-decay properties of even-even neutron-rich isotopes in\nthe rare-earth mass region are studied within a microscopic theoretical\napproach based on a proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation.\nThe underlying mean field is constructed selfconsistently from a deformed\nHartree-Fock calculation with Skyrme interactions and pairing correlations to\nwhich particle-hole and particle-particle residual interactions are added.\nNuclei in this mass region participate in the astrophysical rapid neutron\ncapture process and are directly involved in the generation of the rare-earth\npeak in the isotopic abundance pattern centered at A=160. The energy\ndistributions of the Gamow-Teller strength as well as the beta-decay half-lives\nand the beta-delayed neutron-emission probabilities are discussed and compared\nwith the available experimental information and with calculations based on\ndifferent approaches.\n", "  Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear\nwell suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states\n(MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing Andreev bound\nstates (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot\nat the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the\nnanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic\nfield, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain\nthere, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot\nbound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra\nprovide parameters that are useful for understanding topological\nsuperconductivity in this system.\n", "  Nearly all astrophysical and cosmological data point convincingly to a large\ncomponent of cold dark matter (CDM) in the Universe. The axion particle, first\ntheorized as a solution to the strong charge-parity problem of quantum\nchromodynamics, has been established as a prominent CDM candidate. Cosmic\nobservation and particle physics experiments have bracketed the unknown mass of\nCDM axions between approximately {\\mu}eV and meV. The Axion Dark Matter\neXperim8ent (ADMX) is a direct-detection CDM axion search which has set limits\nat the KSVZ coupling of the axion to two photons for axion masses between 1.9\nand 3.7 {\\mu}eV. The current upgrades will allow ADMX to detect axions with\neven the most pessimistic couplings in this mass range. In order to expand the\nmass reach of the detector, extensive research and development of microwave\ncavity technologies, tunable microwave SQUID amplifiers, and piezoelectric\ndrives is being conducted. ADMX is projected to explore more than one decade of\nthe allowable mass range with DFSZ coupling sensitivity in the near future.\nStatus of the experiment, current research and development, and projected\nresults are discussed.\n  Supported by DOE Grants DOE grant DE-SC00098000, DOE grant DE-SC0011665,\nDE-AC52-07NA27344, DE-AC03-76SF00098, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Fermilab and Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory LDRD programs. SQUID development was supported by DOE grant\nDE-AC02-05CH11231.\n", "  We investigate the discovery potential of the predicted neutral hidden beauty\n$N^*(11052)$ resonance through $\\pi^- p$ scattering within an effective\nLagrangian approach. Two reactions $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow K^-\\Sigma^+$ and\n$\\pi^-p\\rightarrow \\eta_bn$ are studied in this work, with nucleon pole\nexchange as the background. It is found that the contributions of the\n$N^*(11052)$ resonance give clear peak structures in the magnitude of 1 $\\mu b$\nnear the threshold of the $N^*(11052)$ in the total cross sections. The\nnumerical results indicate that the center of mass energy $W\\simeq$ 11-11.1 GeV\nwould be a best energy window for searching the $N^*(11052)$ resonance, where\nthe $N^*(11052)$ signal can be easily distinguished from the background. The\nCOMPASS experiment at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) with pion beam of\n$\\simeq$ 280 GeV will be an ideal platform for searching the super-heavy\nresonance with hidden beauty, which is hopeful to test the theoretical results.\n", "  Anomalous diffusion has been investigated in many systems. Pulsed field\ngradient (PFG) anomalous diffusion is much more complicated than PFG normal\ndiffusion. There have been many theoretical and experimental studies for PFG\nisotropic anomalous diffusion, but there are very few theoretical treatments\nreported for anisotropic anomalous diffusion. Currently, there is not a general\nPFG signal attenuation expression, which includes the finite gradient pulse\neffect and can treat all three types of anisotropic fractional diffusions:\ngeneral fractional diffusion, time fractional diffusion, and space-fractional\ndiffusion. In this paper, the recently developed instantaneous signal\nattenuation (ISA) method was applied to obtain PFG signal attenuation\nexpression for free and restricted anisotropic anomalous diffusion with two\nmodels: fractal derivative and fractional derivative models. The obtained PFG\nsignal attenuation expression for anisotropic anomalous diffusion can reduce to\nthe reported result for PFG anisotropic normal diffusion. The results can also\nreduce to reported PFG isotropic anomalous diffusion results obtained by\neffective phase shift diffusion equation method and instantaneous signal\nattenuation method. For anisotropic space-fractional diffusion, the obtained\nresult agrees with that obtained by the modified Bloch equation method.\nAdditionally, The PFG signal attenuation expressions for free and restricted\nanisotropic curvilinear diffusions were derived by the traditional method, the\nresults of which agree with the PFG anisotropic fractional diffusion results\nbased on the fractional derivative model. The powder pattern of PFG anisotropic\ndiffusion was also discussed. The results here improve our understanding of PFG\nanomalous diffusion, and provide new formalisms for PFG anisotropic anomalous\ndiffusion in NMR and MRI.\n", "  Testing whether a probability distribution is compatible with a given\nBayesian network is a fundamental task in the field of causal inference, where\nBayesian networks model causal relations. Here we consider the class of causal\nstructures where all correlations between observed quantities are solely due to\nthe influence from latent variables. We show that each model of this type\nimposes a certain signature on the observable covariance matrix in terms of a\nparticular decomposition into positive semidefinite components. This signature,\nand thus the underlying hypothetical latent structure, can be tested in a\ncomputationally efficient manner via semidefinite programming. This stands in\nstark contrast with the algebraic geometric tools required if the full\nobservable probability distribution is taken into account. The semidefinite\ntest is compared with tests based on entropic inequalities.\n", "  The MACE (Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment) is a 21 m diameter\ngamma-ray telescope which is presently being installed at Hanle in Ladakh,\nIndia (32^0 46^' 46^\" N, 78^0 58^' 35^\" E) at an altitude of 4270 m a.s.l. Once\noperational, it will become the highest altitude very high energy (VHE)\ngamma-ray telescope in the world based on Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\nTechnique (IACT). In the present work, we discuss the sensitivity estimate of\nthe MACE telescope by using a substantially large Monte Carlo simulation\ndatabase at 5^0 zenith angle. The sensitivity of MACE telescope is estimated by\ncarrying out the gamma-hadron segregation using the Random Forest method. It is\nestimated that the MACE telescope will have an analysis energy threshold of 38\nGeV for image intensities above 50 photoelectrons. The integral sensitivity for\npoint like sources with Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 38 GeV is ~2.7% of Crab\nNebula flux at 5 sigma statistical significance level in 50 hrs of observation.\n", "  We study S duality of four dimensional N=2 Argyres-Douglas (AD) theory\nengineered from 6d A_{N-1} (2,0) theory. We find a (p,q) sequence of SCFTs,\nhere (p,q) is co-prime and class S theory defined on sphere corresponds to\nclass (0,1) theory. We represent these theories by a sphere with marked points,\nand S duality is interpreted as different pants decompositions of the same\npunctured sphere. The weakly coupled gauge theory description involves gauging\nAD matter which is represented by three punctured sphere.\n", "  In this thesis we present few theoretical studies of the models of\nself-organized criticality. Following a brief introduction of self-organized\ncriticality, we discuss three main problems. The first problem is about growing\npatterns formed in the abelian sandpile model (ASM). The patterns exhibit\nproportionate growth where different parts of the pattern grow in same rate,\nkeeping the overall shape unchanged. This non-trivial property, often found in\nbiological growth, has received increasing attention in recent years. In this\nthesis, we present a mathematical characterization of a large class of such\npatterns in terms of discrete holomorphic functions. In the second problem, we\ndiscuss a well known model of self-organized criticality introduced by Zhang in\n1989. We present an exact analysis of the model and quantitatively explain an\nintriguing property known as the emergence of quasi-units. In the third\nproblem, we introduce an operator algebra to determine the steady state of a\nclass of stochastic sandpile models.\n", "  Ferroelectric materials have remained one of the foci of condensed matter\nphysics and materials science for over 50 years. In the last 20 years, the\ndevelopment of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques,\nexemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time and\nvoltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a\nsingle-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures, walls and\npolarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has\nallowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials\nranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the\nrecent Nobel prize in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid\ngrowth in interest in PFM as a method to probe their behavior on single device\nand device assembly levels. However, the broad introduction of PFM also\nresulted in a growing number of reports on nearly ubiquitous presence of\nferroelectric-like phenomena including remnant polar states and\nelectromechanical hysteresis loops in materials which are non-ferroelectric in\nthe bulk, or in cases where size effects are expected to suppress\nferroelectricity. While in certain cases plausible physical mechanisms can be\nsuggested, there is remarkable similarity in observed behaviors, irrespective\nof the materials system. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of\nPFM, briefly discuss the features of ferroelectric surfaces salient to PFM\nimaging and spectroscopy, and summarize existing reports on ferroelectric like\nresponses in non-classical ferroelectric materials. We further discuss possible\nmechanisms behind observed behaviors, and possible experimental strategies for\ntheir identification.\n", "  According to theoretical considerations, multiplicity of hierarchical stellar\nsystems can reach, depending on masses and orbital parameters, several hundred,\nwhile observational data confirm existence of at most septuple\n(seven-component) systems. In this study, we cross-match very high multiplicity\n(six and more components) stellar systems in modern catalogues of visual double\nand multiple stars, to find candidates to hierarchical systems among them.\nAfter cross-matching with catalogues of closer binaries (eclipsing,\nspectroscopic, etc.), some of their components were found to be binary/multiple\nthemselves, which increases the system's degree of multiplicity. Optical pairs,\nknown from literature or filtered by the authors, are flagged and excluded from\nthe statistics. We have compiled a list of potentially very high multiplicity\nhierarchical systems that contains 10~objects. Their multiplicity does not\nexceed 12, and we discuss a number of ways to explain the lack of extremely\nhigh multiplicity systems.\n", "  The boundary problem about behaviour (oscillations) of the electronic plasmas\nwith arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas in half-space with\ndiffusion boundary conditions is analytically solved. The kinetic equation of\nVlasov - Boltzmann with integral of collisions of type BGK (Bhatnagar, Gross,\nKrook) and Maxwell equation for electric field are applied. Distribution\nfunction for electrons and electric field in plasma in the form of expansion\nunder eigen solutions of the initial system of equations are received.\nCoefficients of these expansions are found by means of the boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the numerical stability of reduced order models for\nconvection-dominated stochastic systems in a relatively simple setting: a\nstochastic Burgers equation with linear multiplicative noise. Our preliminary\nresults suggest that, in a convection-dominated regime, standard reduced order\nmodels yield inaccurate results in the form of spurious numerical oscillations.\nTo alleviate these oscillations, we use the Leray reduced order model, which\nincreases the numerical stability of the standard model by smoothing\n(regularizing) the convective term with an explicit spatial filter. The Leray\nreduced order model yields significantly better results than the standard\nreduced order model and is more robust with respect to changes in the strength\nof the noise.\n", "  We investigate the level spacing distribution for the quantum spectrum of the\nsquare billiard. Extending work of Connors--Keating, and Smilansky, we\nformulate an analog of the Hardy--Littlewood prime $k$-tuple conjecture for\nsums of two squares, and show that it implies that the spectral gaps, after\nremoving degeneracies and rescaling, are Poisson distributed. Consequently, by\nwork of Rudnick and Uebersch\\\"ar, the level spacings of arithmetic toral point\nscatterers, in the weak coupling limit, are also Poisson distributed. We also\ngive numerical evidence for the conjecture and its implications.\n", "  We study noncommutative classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological\nmodels. The constant curvature of the spatial sections can be positive ($k=1$),\nnegative ($k=-1$) or zero ($k=0$). The matter is represented by a perfect fluid\nwith negative pressure, phantom fluid, which satisfies the equation of state $p\n=\\alpha \\rho$ , with $\\alpha < - 1$, where $p$ is the pressure and $\\rho$ is\nthe energy density. We use Schutz's formalism in order to write the perfect\nfluid Hamiltonian. The noncommutativity is introduced by nontrivial Poisson\nbrackets between few variables of the models. In order to recover a description\nin terms of commutative variables, we introduce variables transformations that\ndepend on a noncommutative parameter ($\\gamma$). The main motivation for the\nintroduction of the noncommutativity is trying to explain the present\naccelerated expansion of the universe. We obtain the dynamical equations for\nthese models and solve them. The solutions have four constants: $\\gamma$, a\nparameter associated with the fluid energy $C$, $k$, $\\alpha$ and the initial\nconditions of the models variables. For each value of $\\alpha$, we obtain\ndifferent equations of motion. Then, we compare the evolution of the universe\nbetween the present noncommutative models and the corresponding commutative\nones ($\\gamma \\to 0$). The results show that $\\gamma$ is very useful for\ndescribing an accelerating universe. We estimate the value of $\\gamma$, for the\npresent conditions of the Universe. Then, using that value of $\\gamma$, in one\nof the noncommutative cosmological models, we compute the amount of time this\nuniverse would take to reach the {\\it big rip}.\n", "  Multi-frequency, multi-epoch ATCA observations of a sample of AGN resulted in\nthe identification of 9 new candidate Giga-hertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources.\nHere we present Long Baseline Array observations at 4.8 GHz of the four\ncandidates with no previously published VLBI image, and consider these together\nwith previously published VLBI images of the other five sources. We find\ncore-jet or compact double morphologies dominate, with further observations\nrequired to distinguish between these two possibilities for some sources. One\nof the nine candidates, PKS 1831-711, displays appreciable variability,\nsuggesting its GPS spectrum is more ephemeral in nature. We focus in particular\non the apparent relationship between a narrow spectral width and \"compact\ndouble\" parsec-scale morphology, finding further examples, but also exceptions\nto this trend. An examination of the VLBI morphologies high-redshift (z>3)\nsub-class of GPS sources suggests that core-jet morphologies predominate in\nthis class.\n", "  The merger of a binary neutron star system is suggested as the central engine\nof short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). For the merger process, simulations predict\nthat magnetic field is amplified beyond magnetar field strength by\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. With the Large Area Telescope (LAT), bursts\nhave been detected that show a temporally extended component in coincidence\nwith a short-lasting peak at the end of the prompt phase. We show that the\npresence of these LAT components in a sGRB could provide evidence of magnetic\nfield amplification in the neutron star merger.\n", "  We discuss an investigation of student difficulties with degenerate\nperturbation theory (DPT) carried out in advanced quantum mechanics courses by\nadministering free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducting\nindividual interviews with students. We find that students share many common\ndifficulties related to this topic. We used the difficulties found via research\nas resources to develop and evaluate a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial\n(QuILT) which strives to help students develop a functional understanding of\nDPT. We discuss the development of the DPT QuILT and its preliminary evaluation\nin the undergraduate and graduate courses.\n", "  A modified lattice gas model is proposed to study pedestrian evacuation from\na single room. The payoff matrix in this model represents the complicated\ninteractions between selfish individuals, and the mean force imposed on an\nindividual is given by considering the impacts of neighborhood payoff, walls,\nand defector herding. Each passer-by moves to his selected location according\nto the Fermi function, and the average velocity of pedestrian flow is defined\nas a function of the motion rule. Two pedestrian types are included:\ncooperators, who adhere to the evacuation instructions; and defectors, who\nignore the rules and act individually. It is observed that the escape time\nincreases with the panic level, and the system remains smooth for a low panic\nlevel, but exhibits three stages for a high panic level. We prove that the\npanic level determines the dynamics of this system, and the initial density of\ncooperators has a negligible impact. The system experiences three phases, a\nsingle phase of cooperator, a mixed two-phase pedestrian, and a single phase of\ndefector sequentially as the panic level upgrades. The phase transition has\nbeen proven basically robust to the changes of empty site contribution, wall's\npressure, and noise amplitude in the motion rule. It is further shown that\npedestrians derive the greatest benefit from overall cooperation, but are\ntrapped in the worst situation if they are all defectors.\n", "  A method to calculate reactions in quantum mechanics is outlined. It is\nadvantageous, in particular, in problems with many open channels of various\nnature i.e. when energy is not low. In the method there is no need to specify\nreaction channels in a dynamics calculation. These channels come into play at\nmerely the kinematics level and only after a dynamics calculation is done. This\ncalculation is of the bound--state type while continuum spectrum states never\nenter the game.\n", "  $\\nu$ Eridani is a well known multiperiodic $\\beta$ Cephei pulsator which\nexhibits also the SPB (Slowly Pulsating B-type stars) type modes. Recent\nfrequency analysis of the BRITE photometry of $\\alpha$ Lupi showed that the\nstar is also a hybrid $\\beta$ Cep/SPB pulsator, in which both high and low\nfrequencies were detected.\n  We construct complex seismic models in order to account for the observed\nfrequency range, the values of the frequencies themselves and the non-adiabatic\nparameter $f$ for the dominant mode. Our studies suggest, that significant\nmodifications of the opacity profile at the temperature range $\\log{T}\\in\n(5.0-5.5)$ are necessary to fulfill all these requirements.\n", "  Preliminary work has been done in order to assess the perspectives of\nmetrology and fundamental physics atomic experiments at SYRTE and LKB in the\nsearch for physics beyond the Standard Model and General Relativity. The first\nstudies we identified are currently ongoing with the Microscope mission and\nwith a Cs fountain clock. The latter brings significant improvement on the\nproton-sector coefficient $\\bar{c}_{TT}$ down to the $10^{-17}$ GeV level.\n", "  We report on normal contact and friction measurements of model multicontact\ninterfaces formed between smooth surfaces and substrates textured with a\nstatistical distribution of spherical micro-asperities. Contacts are either\nformed between a rigid textured lens and a smooth rubber, or a flat textured\nrubber and a smooth rigid lens. Measurements of the real area of contact $A$\nversus normal load $P$ are performed by imaging the light transmitted at the\nmicrocontacts. For both interfaces, $A(P)$ is found to be sub-linear with a\npower law behavior. Comparison to two multi-asperity contact models, which\nextend Greenwood-Williamson (J. Greenwood, J. Williamson, \\textit{Proc. Royal\nSoc. London Ser. A} \\textbf{295}, 300 (1966)) model by taking into account the\nelastic interaction between asperities at different length scales, is\nperformed, and allows their validation for the first time. We find that long\nrange elastic interactions arising from the curvature of the nominal surfaces\nare the main source of the non-linearity of $A(P)$. At a shorter range, and\nexcept for very low pressures, the pressure dependence of both density and area\nof micro-contacts remains well described by Greenwood-Williamson's model, which\nneglects any interaction between asperities. In addition, in steady sliding,\nfriction measurements reveal that the mean shear stress at the scale of the\nasperities is systematically larger than that found for a macroscopic contact\nbetween a smooth lens and a rubber. This suggests that frictional stresses\nmeasured at macroscopic length scales may not be simply transposed to\nmicroscopic multicontact interfaces.\n", "  Measurements of the top--antitop quark pair production charge asymmetry in\nthe dilepton channel, characterized by two high-${p}_{\\rm{T}}$ leptons\n(electrons or muons), are presented using data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 20.3 $\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ from $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass\nenergy $\\sqrt{s} = 8$~TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider at CERN. Inclusive and differential measurements as a function of the\ninvariant mass, transverse momentum, and longitudinal boost of the $t\\bar{t}$\nsystem are performed both in the full phase space and in a fiducial phase space\nclosely matching the detector acceptance. Two observables are studied:\n$A_C^{\\ell \\ell}$ based on the selected leptons and $A_C^{t\\bar{t}}$ based on\nthe reconstructed $t\\bar{t}$ final state. No significant deviation from the\nStandard Model expectations is observed.\n", "  Basic issues of the time-dependent density-functional theory are discussed,\nespecially on the real-time calculation of the linear response functions. Some\nremarks on the derivation of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations and on the\nnumerical methods are given.\n", "  By analyzing the numerical representation of amplitude values in audio\nsignals and integrating the time component, a representation for audio signals\non quantum computers, FRQA, is proposed. The FRQA representation is a\nnormalized state that facilitates basic audio signal operations targeting these\nparameters. The preparation and retrieval for FRQA are discussed and, based on\nthe FRQA state, we realize the circuits to accomplish basic audio signal\noperations such as signal addition, signal inversion, signal delay, and signal\nreversal. These operations can be employed as the major components to build\nadvanced operations for particular applications in the quantum computing\ndomain.\n", "  Circular polarization spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool in\nphotosynthesis research and (bio)-molecular research in general. Oxygenic\nphotosystems typically display an asymmetric Cotton effect around the\nchlorophyll absorbance maximum with a signal $\\leq 1 \\%$. In vegetation, these\nsignals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular\naggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the\ncomposition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby\nlinked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a\nmolecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument,\nTreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through\nspectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a\nsensitivity of $\\sim 1*10^{-4}$ and is therefore suitable of non-destructively\nprobing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves. We have measured the\nchiroptical evolution of \\textit{Hedera helix} leaves for a period of 22 days.\nSpectrally resolved circular polarization measurements (450-900 nm) on whole\nleaves in transmission exhibit a strong decrease in the polarization signal\nover time after plucking, which we accredit to the deterioration of chiral\nmacro-aggregates. Chlorophyll \\textit{a} levels measured over the same period\nby means of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a much\nsmaller decrease. With these results we are able to distinguish healthy from\ndeteriorating leaves. Hereby we indicate the potency of circular polarization\nspectroscopy on whole and intact leaves as a nondestructive tool for structural\nand plant stress assessment. Additionally, we underline the establishment of\ncircular polarization signals as remotely accessible means of detecting the\npresence of extraterrestrial life.\n", "  We present the reweighted complex Langevin method, which enlarges the\napplicability range of the complex Langevin method by reweighting the complex\ntrajectories. In this reweighting procedure both the auxiliary and target\nensembles have a complex action. We validate the method by applying it to\ntwo-dimensional strong-coupling QCD at nonzero chemical potential, and observe\nthat it gives access to parameter regions that could otherwise not be reached\nwith the complex Langevin method.\n", "  In de novo drug design, computational strategies are used to generate novel\nmolecules with good affinity to the desired biological target. In this work, we\nshow that recurrent neural networks can be trained as generative models for\nmolecular structures, similar to statistical language models in natural\nlanguage processing. We demonstrate that the properties of the generated\nmolecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to\ntrain the model. In order to enrich libraries with molecules active towards a\ngiven biological target, we propose to fine-tune the model with small sets of\nmolecules, which are known to be active against that target.\n  Against Staphylococcus aureus, the model reproduced 14% of 6051 hold-out test\nmolecules that medicinal chemists designed, whereas against Plasmodium\nfalciparum (Malaria) it reproduced 28% of 1240 test molecules. When coupled\nwith a scoring function, our model can perform the complete de novo drug design\ncycle to generate large sets of novel molecules for drug discovery.\n", "  Measurements on magnetization and relaxation have been carried out on an\noptimally doped Ba$_{0.59}$K$_{0.47}$BiO$_{3+\\delta}$ single crystal with $T_c$\n= 31.3 K. Detailed analysis is undertaken on the data. Both the dynamical\nrelaxation and conventional relaxation have been measured leading to the\nself-consistent determination of the magnetization relaxation rate. It is found\nthat the data are well described by the collective pinning model leading to the\nglassy exponent of about $\\mu\\approx$ 1.64 to 1.68 with the magnetic fields of\n1 and 3 T. The analysis based on Maley's method combining with the conventional\nrelaxation data allows us to determine the current dependent activation energy\n$U$ which yields a $\\mu$ value of about 1.23 to 1.29 for the magnetic fields of\n1 and 3 T. The second magnetization peaks appear in wide temperature region\nfrom 2 K to 24 K. The separation between the second peak field and the\nirreversibility field becomes narrow when temperature is increased. When the\ntwo fields are close to each other, we find that the second peak evolves into a\nstep like transition of magnetization, suggesting a crossover from the second\norder to first order transition. Finally, we present a vortex phase diagram and\ndemonstrate that the vortex dynamics in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ can be used as a\nmodel system for studying the collective vortex pining.\n", "  The in situ characterization of transport processes in fractured media is\nparticularly challenging due to the considerable spatial uncertainty on tracer\npathways and dominant controlling processes, such as dispersion, channeling,\ntrapping, matrix diffusion, ambient and density driven flows. We attempted to\nreduce this uncertainty by coupling push-pull tracer experiments with\nsingle-hole ground penetrating radar (GPR) time-lapse imaging. The experiments\ninvolved different injection fractures, chaser volumes and resting times, and\nwere performed at the fractured rock research site of Ploemeur in France (H+\nnetwork, hplus.ore.fr/en). For the GPR acquisitions, we used both fixed and\nmoving antenna setups in a borehole that was isolated with a flexible liner.\nDuring the fixed-antenna experiment, time-varying GPR reflections allowed us to\ntrack the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tracer during the push-pull\nexperiment. During the moving antenna experiments, we clearly imaged the\ndominant fractures in which tracer transport took place, fractures in which the\ntracer was trapped for longer time periods, and the spatial extent of the\ntracer distribution (up to 8 m) at different times. This demonstrated the\nexistence of strongly channelized flow in the first few meters and radial flow\nat greater distances. By varying the resting time of a given experiment, we\nidentified regions affected by density-driven and ambient flow. These\nexperiments open up new perspectives for coupled hydrogeophysical inversion\naimed at understanding transport phenomena in fractured rock formations.\n", "  We propose a new approach to model ground penetrating radar signals that\npropagate through a homogeneous and isotropic medium, and are scattered at thin\nplanar fractures of arbitrary dip, azimuth, thickness and material filling. We\nuse analytical expressions for the Maxwell equations in a homogeneous space to\ndescribe the propagation of the signal in the rock matrix, and account for\nfrequency-dependent dispersion and attenuation through the empirical Jonscher\nformulation. We discretize fractures into elements that are linearly polarized\nby the incoming electric field that arrives from the source to each element,\nlocally, as a plane wave. To model the effective source wavelet we use a\ngeneralized Gamma distribution to define the antenna dipole moment. We combine\nmicroscopic and macroscopic Maxwell's equations to derive an analytic\nexpression for the response of each element, which describes the full electric\ndipole radiation patterns along with effective reflection coefficients of thin\nlayers. Our results compare favorably with finite-difference time-domain\nmodeling in the case of constant electrical parameters of the rock-matrix and\nfracture filling. Compared with traditional finite-difference time-domain\nmodeling, the proposed approach is faster and more flexible in terms of\nfracture orientations. A comparison with published laboratory results suggests\nthat the modeling approach can reproduce the main characteristics of the\nreflected wavelet.\n", "  The Europlanet 2020 Research Infrastructure will include new Planetary Space\nWeather Services (PSWS) that will extend the concepts of space weather and\nspace situational awareness to other planets in our Solar System and in\nparticular to spacecraft that voyage through it. PSWS will make five entirely\nnew toolkits accessible to the research community and to industrial partners\nplanning for space missions: a general planetary space weather toolkit, as well\nas three toolkits dedicated to the following key planetary environments: Mars,\ncomets, and outer planets. This will give the European planetary science\ncommunity new methods, interfaces, functionalities and/or plugins dedicated to\nplanetary space weather in the tools and models available within the partner\ninstitutes. It will also create a novel event-diary toolkit aiming at\npredicting and detecting planetary events like meteor showers and impacts. A\nvariety of tools are available for tracing propagation of planetary and/or\nsolar events through the Solar System and modelling the response of the\nplanetary environment (surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres)\nto those events. But these tools were not originally designed for planetary\nevent prediction and space weather applications. PSWS will provide the\nadditional research and tailoring required to apply them for these purposes.\nPSWS will be to review, test, improve and adapt methods and tools available\nwithin the partner institutes in order to make prototype planetary event and\nspace weather services operational in Europe at the end of the programme. To\nachieve its objectives PSWS will use a few tools and standards developed for\nthe Astronomy Virtual Observatory (VO). This paper gives an overview of the\nproject together with a few illustrations of prototype services based on VO\nstandards and protocols.\n", "  In groundwater hydrology, geophysical imaging holds considerable promise for\nimproving parameter estimation, due to the generally high resolution and\nspatial coverage of geophysical data. However, inversion of geophysical data\nalone cannot unveil the distribution of hydraulic conductivity. Jointly\ninverting geophysical and hydrological data allows us to benefit from the\nadvantages of geophysical imaging and, at the same time, recover the\nhydrological parameters of interest. We have applied a coupling strategy\nbetween geophysical and hydrological models that is based on structural\nsimilarity constraints. Model combinations, for which the spatial gradients of\nthe inferred parameter fields are not aligned in parallel, are penalized in the\ninversion. This structural coupling does not require introducing a potentially\nweak, unknown, and nonstationary petrophysical relation to link the models. The\nmethod was first tested on synthetic data sets and then applied to two\ncombinations of geophysical/hydrological data sets from a saturated gravel\naquifer in northern Switzerland. Crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR)\ntraveltimes were jointly inverted with hydraulic tomography data, as well as\nwith tracer mean arrival times, to retrieve the 2D distribution of GPR\nvelocities and hydraulic conductivities. In the synthetic case, incorporating\nthe GPR data through a joint inversion framework improved the resolution and\nlocalization properties of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field. For the\nfield study, recovered hydraulic conductivities were in general agreement with\nflowmeter data.\n", "  A strategy is presented to incorporate prior information from conceptual\ngeological models in probabilistic inversion of geophysical data. The\nconceptual geological models are represented by multiple-point statistics\ntraining images (TIs) featuring the expected lithological units and structural\npatterns. Information from an ensemble of TI realizations is used in two\ndifferent ways. First, dominant modes are identified by analysis of the\nfrequency content in the realizations, which drastically reduces the model\nparameter space in the frequency-amplitude domain. Second, the distributions of\nglobal, summary metrics (e.g. model roughness) are used to formulate a prior\nprobability density function. The inverse problem is formulated in a Bayesian\nframework and the posterior pdf is sampled using Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The usefulness and applicability of this method is demonstrated on\ntwo case studies in which synthetic crosshole ground-penetrating radar\ntraveltime data are inverted to recover 2-D porosity fields. The use of prior\ninformation from TIs significantly enhances the reliability of the posterior\nmodels by removing inversion artefacts and improving individual parameter\nestimates. The proposed methodology reduces the ambiguity inherent in the\ninversion of high-dimensional parameter spaces, accommodates a wide range of\nsummary statistics and geophysical forward problems.\n", "  The expectation value of an observable is an important concept in quantum\nmechanics. However, upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in physics\nhave both conceptual and procedural difficulties when determining the\nexpectation value of physical observables, especially when using Dirac\nnotation. To investigate these difficulties, we administered free-response and\nmultiple-choice questions and conducted individual interviews with students.\nHere, we discuss the analysis of data on student difficulties when determining\nthe expectation value.\n", "  Single phase, uniform size (~9 nm) Cobalt Ferrite (CFO) nanoparticles have\nbeen synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis using oleic acid as a surfactant.\nThe as synthesized oleic acid coated CFO (OA-CFO) nanoparticles were well\ndispersible in nonpolar solvents but not dispersible in water. The OA-CFO\nnanoparticles have been successfully transformed to highly water dispersible\ncitric acid coated CFO (CA-CFO) nanoparticles using a novel single step ligand\nexchange process by mechanochemical milling, in which small chain citric acid\nmolecules replace the original large chain oleic acid molecules available on\nCFO nanoparticles. The contact angle measurement shows that OA-CFO\nnanoparticles are hydrophobic whereas CA-CFO nanoparticles are superhydrophilic\nin nature. The potentiality of as synthesized OA-CFO and mechanochemically\ntransformed CA-CFO nanoparticles for the demulsification of highly stabilized\nwater-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions has been demonstrated.\n", "  Dirac notation is used commonly in quantum mechanics. However, many\nupper-level undergraduate and graduate students in physics have difficulties\nwith representations of quantum operators corresponding to observables\nespecially when using Dirac notation. To investigate these difficulties, we\nadministered free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducted\nindividual interviews with students in advanced quantum mechanics courses. We\ndiscuss the analysis of data on the common difficulties found.\n", "  Explication and reflection on expert vs. novice considerations within the\nproblem-solving process characterize a cognitive apprenticeship approach for\nthe development of expert-like problem solving practices. In the context of\ngrading, a cognitive apprenticeship approach requires that instructors place\nthe burden of proof on students, namely, that they require explanations of\nreasoning and explication of problem-solving processes. However, prior research\non instructors' considerations when grading revealed their reluctance to use\nsuch a grading approach, motivated by a perception of teaching that places the\nburden of proof on the instructor. This study focuses on physics graduate\nteaching assistants (TAs) who play a central role in grading. A short\nprofessional development activity was designed that involved eliciting TAs'\nperceptions regarding grading, presenting a cognitive apprenticeship-inspired\ngrading rubric, followed by a discussion of the dilemma between placing the\nburden of proof on the instructor vs. the student. In this context, we examined\nTAs' grading considerations and approaches towards grading and the effect of\nthe short professional development grading activity on them.\n", "  Physics graduate teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading.\nPhysics education research suggests that grading practices that place the\nburden of proof for explicating the problem solving process on students can\nhelp them develop problem solving skills and learn physics. However, TAs may\nnot have developed effective grading practices and may grade student solutions\nin introductory and advanced courses differently. In the context of a TA\nprofessional development course, we asked TAs to grade student solutions to\nintroductory physics and quantum mechanics problems and explain why their\ngrading approaches were different or similar in the two contexts. TAs expected\nand rewarded reasoning more frequently in the QM context. Our findings suggest\nthat these differences may at least partly be due to the TAs not realizing that\ngrading can serve as a formative assessment tool and also not thinking about\nthe difficulty of an introductory physics problem from an introductory physics\nstudent's perspective.\n", "  Ruan-Tian deformations of the Cauchy-Riemann operator enable a geometric\ndefinition of (standard) Gromov-Witten invariants of semi-positive symplectic\nmanifolds in arbitrary genera. We describe an analogue of these deformations\ncompatible with our recent construction of real Gromov-Witten invariants in\narbitrary genera. Our approach avoids the need for an embedding of the\nuniversal curve into a smooth manifold and systematizes the\ndeformation-obstruction setup behind constructions of Gromov-Witten invariants.\n", "  We compute the degree of the generalized Pl\\\"ucker embedding $\\kappa$ of a\nQuot scheme $X$ over $\\PP^1$. The space $X$ can also be considered as a\ncompactification of the space of algebraic maps of a fixed degree from $\\PP^1$\nto the Grassmanian $\\rm{Grass}(m,n)$. Then the degree of the embedded variety\n$\\kappa (X)$ can be interpreted as an intersection product of pullbacks of\ncohomology classes from $\\rm{Grass}(m,n)$ through the map $\\psi$ that evaluates\na map from $\\PP^1$ at a point $x\\in \\PP^1$. We show that our formula for the\ndegree verifies the formula for these intersection products predicted by\nphysicists through Quantum cohomology~\\cite{va92}~\\cite{in91}~\\cite{wi94}. We\narrive at the degree by proving a version of the classical Pieri's formula on\nthe variety $X$, using a cell decomposition of a space that lies in between $X$\nand $\\kappa (X)$.\n"]}
