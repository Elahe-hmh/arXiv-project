The proof essentially proceeds by\n\"perturbing\" the scaling limit of the critical model, using the pivotal\nmeasures studied in our earlier paper. Markovianity and conformal covariance of\nthese new limiting objects are also established.\n", "  We prove that the Minimal Spanning Tree and the Invasion Percolation Tree on\na version of the triangular lattice in the complex plane have unique scaling\nlimits, which are invariant under rotations, scalings, and, in the case of the\nMST, also under translations. However, they are not expected to be conformally\ninvariant. We also prove some geometric properties of the limiting MST. The\ntopology of convergence is the space of spanning trees introduced by Aizenman,\nBurchard, Newman & Wilson (1999), and the proof relies on the existence and\nconformal covariance of the scaling limit of the near-critical percolation\nensemble, established in our earlier works.\n", "  The most general large ${\\cal N}=4$ superconformal ${\\cal W}_{\\infty}$\nalgebra, containing in addition to the superconformal algebra one\nsupermultiplet for each integer spin, is analysed in detail. It is found that\nthe ${\\cal W}_{\\infty}$ algebra is uniquely determined by the levels of the two\n$\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebras, a conclusion that holds both for the linear and\nthe non-linear case. We also perform various cross-checks of our analysis, and\nexhibit two different types of truncations in some detail.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating the partition function of the\nferromagnetic Ising model in a consistent external magnetic field. The\nestimation is done via importance sampling in the dual of the Forney factor\ngraph representing the model. Emphasis is on models at low temperature\n(corresponding to models with strong couplings) and on models with a mixture of\nstrong and weak coupling parameters.\n", "  By using the renormalization group (RG) equation it has proved possible to\nsum logarithmic corrections to quantities that arise due to quantum effects in\nfield theories. In particular, the effective potential V in the Standard Model\nin the limit that there are no massive parameters in the classical action (the\n\"conformal limit\") has been subject to this analysis, as has the effective\npotential in a scalar theory with a quartic self coupling and in massless\nscalar electrodynamics. Having multiple coupling constants and/or mass\nparameters in the initial action complicates this analysis, as then several\nmass scales arise. We show how to address this problem by considering the\neffective potential in scalar electrodynamics when the scalar field has a tree\nlevel mass term. In addition to summing logarithmic corrections by using the RG\nequation, we also consider the consequences of the condition V'(v)=0 where v is\nthe vacuum expectation value of the scalar. If V is expanded in powers of the\nlogarithms that arise, then it proves possible to show that either v is zero or\nthat V is independent of the scalar. (That is, either there is no spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking or the vacuum expectation value is not determined by\nminimizing V as V is \"flat\".)\n", "  Internal physical structure can drastically modify the properties of\nwaveguides: photonic crystal fibers are able to confine light inside a hollow\nair core by Bragg scattering from a periodic array of holes, while metamaterial\nloaded waveguides for microwaves can support propagation at frequencies well\nbelow cutoff. Anisotropic metamaterials assembled into cylindrically symmetric\ngeometries constitute light-guiding structures that support new kinds of exotic\nmodes. A microtube of anodized nanoporous alumina, with nanopores radially\nemanating from the inner wall to the outer surface, is a manifestation of such\nan anisotropic metamaterial optical fiber. The nanopores, when filled with a\nplasmonic metal such as silver or gold, greatly increase the electromagnetic\nanisotropy. The modal solutions in anisotropic circular waveguides can be\nuncommon Bessel functions with imaginary orders.\n", "  We develop a theoretical model to describe the dissipative dynamics of\nsinglet-triplet (S-T_0) qubits in GaAs quantum dots. Using the concurrence\nexperimentally obtained as a guide, we show that each logical qubit is coupled\nto its own environment because the decoherence effect can be described by\nindependent dephasing channels. Given the correct description of the\nenvironment, we study the dynamics of concurrence as a function of the\ntemperature, the constant coupling between the system and the environment, the\npreparation time, and the exchange coupling. Although the reduction of the\nenvironment coupling constant modifies the entanglement dynamics, we\ndemonstrate that temperature emerges as a crucial variable and a variation of\nmillikelvins significantly modifies the generation of entangled states.\nFurthermore, we show that the exchange coupling together with the preparation\ntime strongly affects the entanglement dissipative dynamics.\n", "  We demonstrate levitation and three-dimensionally stable trapping of a wide\nvariety of particles in a vacuum chamber through the use of the thermophoretic\nforce in the presence of a strong temperature gradient. Typical sizes of the\ntrapped particles are between 10 microns and 1 mm at a pressure between 1 and\n10 Torr. The trapping stability is provided by the geometry of the temperature\nfield, as well as the transition between the free molecule and hydrodynamic\nregimes of the thermophoretic force. To quantitatively measure the\nthermophoretic force, we examine the levitation heights of spherical\npolyethylene spheres under various experimental conditions and determine the\ntemperature gradient needed to levitate the particles. A good agreement between\nour experimental observations and theoretical calculations is obtained. Our\nsystem offers a new platform to study thermophoretic phenomena and to simulate\ndynamics of interacting many-body systems in a microgravity environment.\n", "  We present a numerical approach to the solution of elastic phonon scattering\nproblems based on a frequency domain decomposition of the atomistic equations\nof motion and the use of perfectly matched layer or PML boundaries. Unlike MD\nwavepacket analysis, the current approach has the ability to simulate\nscattering from individual phonon modes, including wavevectors in highly\ndispersive regimes. Like the Atomistic Green's Function method, the technique\nreduces scattering problems to a system of linear algebraic equations via a\nsparse, banded matrix. However, the use of PML boundaries enables rapid\nabsorption of scattered wave energies at the boundaries, and provides a simple\nand inexpensive interpretation of the scattered phonon energy flux calculated\nfrom the energy dissipation rate in the PML. The accuracy of the method is\ndemonstrated on connected monoatomic chains, for which an analytic solution is\nknown. The parameters defining the PML are found to affect the performance and\nguidelines for selecting optimal parameters are given. The method is used to\nstudy the energy transmission coefficient for connected diatomic chains over\nall available wavevectors for both optical and longitudinal phonons; it is\nfound that when there is discontinuity between sublattices, even connected\nchains of equivalent acoustic impedence have near-zero transmission coefficient\nfor short wavelengths. The phonon scattering cross section of an embedded\nnanocylinder is calculated for a wide range of frequencies to demonstrate the\nextension of the method to high dimensions. The calculations match continuum\ntheory for long wavelength phonons and large cylinder radii, but otherwise show\ncomplex physics including Mie oscillations which terminate when incident phonon\nfrequencies exceeds the maximum available frequency in the embedded\nnanocylinder, and scattering efficiencies larger than two near the Brillouin\nzone edge.\n", "  We study the renormalization of a general field theory on the 2-sphere with\ntensorial interaction and gauge invariance under the diagonal action of SU(2).\nWe derive the power counting for arbitrary dimension d. For the case d=4, we\nprove perturbative renormalizability to all orders via multi-scale analysis,\nstudy both the renormalised and effective perturbation series, and establish\nthe asymptotic freedom of the model. We also outline a general power counting\nfor the homogeneous space SO(D)/SO(D-1), of direct interest for quantum gravity\nmodels in general dimensions, and point out the obstructions to the direct\ngeneralisation of our results to these cases.\n", "  Recommender systems are present in many web applications to guide our\nchoices. They increase sales and benefit sellers, but whether they benefit\ncustomers by providing relevant products is questionable. Here we introduce a\nmodel to examine the benefit of recommender systems for users, and found that\nrecommendations from the system can be equivalent to random draws if one relies\ntoo strongly on the system. Nevertheless, with sufficient information about\nuser preferences, recommendations become accurate and an abrupt transition to\nthis accurate regime is observed for some algorithms. On the other hand, we\nfound that a high accuracy evaluated by common accuracy metrics does not\nnecessarily correspond to a high real accuracy nor a benefit for users, which\nserves as an alarm for operators and researchers of recommender systems. We\ntested our model with a real dataset and observed similar behaviors. Finally, a\nrecommendation approach with improved accuracy is suggested. These results\nimply that recommender systems can benefit users, but relying too strongly on\nthe system may render the system ineffective.\n", "  We consider the many body quantum dynamics of systems of bosons interacting\nthrough a two-body potential $N^{3\\beta-1} V (N^\\beta x)$, scaling with the\nnumber of particles $N$. For $0< \\beta < 1$, we obtain a norm-approximation of\nthe evolution of an appropriate class of data on the Fock space. To this end,\nwe need to correct the evolution of the condensate described by the\none-particle nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation by means of a fluctuation\ndynamics, governed by a quadratic generator.\n", "  Quantum interference lies at the heart of several quantum computational\nspeed-ups and provides a striking example of a phenomenon with no classical\ncounterpart. An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three\nslit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in\nterms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.\nThis is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the\ninterference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who\nasked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit\nexperiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of\nquantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope\nof determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer\nfrom pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two\nproposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density\nCubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible\ninterference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of\nZyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage\nover quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a\nwell-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite\nthis, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient\nto uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is\nwell-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all\norders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,\nbut to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order\ninterference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference\ntherefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed.\n", "  We consider the remote state creation via the homogeneous spin-1/2 chain and\nshow that the significant extension of the creatable region can be achieved\nusing the local unitary transformation of the so-called extended receiver (i.e.\nreceiver joined with the nearest node(s)). This transformation is { most}\neffective in the models with all-node interactions. We consider the model with\nthe two-qubit sender, one-qubit receiver and two-qubit extended receiver.\n", "  Crystal dislocations govern the plastic mechanical properties of materials\nbut also affect the electrical and optical properties. However, a fundamental\nand quantitative quantum-mechanical theory of dislocation remains undiscovered\nfor decades. Here we present an exactly solvable quantum field theory of\ndislocation, for both edge and screw dislocations in an isotropic medium by\nintroducing a new quasiparticle \"dislon\". With this approach, the\nelectron-dislocation relaxation time is studied from electron self-energy which\ncan be reduced to classical results. Moreover, a fundamentally new type of\nelectron energy Friedel oscillation near dislocation core is predicted, which\ncan occur even with single electron at present. For the first time, the effect\nof dislocations on materials' non-mechanical properties can be studied at a\nfull quantum field theoretical level.\n", "  Integrated quantum optics has drastically reduced the size of table-top\noptical experiments to the chip-scale, allowing for demonstrations of\nlarge-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation. However,\ndespite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits\nremain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide\ninterferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale.\nIncreasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees\nof freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time,\nand frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by\nsimplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise\ntolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum\nphenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum\ninformation processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on\nthe transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode\nbeamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of\nspatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the\nwaveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes\n(per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum\ninterference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We\nalso cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within\na multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations\non more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a\nscalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.\n", "  We analyze the low temperature structure of a supersymmetric quiver quantum\nmechanics with randomized superpotential coefficients, treating them as\nquenched disorder. These theories describe features of the low energy dynamics\nof wrapped branes, which in large number backreact into extremal black holes.\nWe show that the low temperature theory, in the limit of a large number of\nbifundamentals, exhibits a time reparametrization symmetry as well as a\nspecific heat linear in the temperature. Both these features resemble the\nbehavior of black hole horizons in the zero temperature limit. We demonstrate\nsimilarities between the low temperature physics of the random quiver model and\na theory of large $N$ free fermions with random masses.\n", "  Combining atomically-thin van der Waals materials into heterostructures\nprovides a powerful path towards the creation of designer electronic devices.\nThe interaction strength between neighboring layers, most easily controlled\nthrough their interlayer separation, can have significant influence on the\nelectronic properties of these composite materials. Here, we demonstrate\nunprecedented control over interlayer interactions by locally modifying the\ninterlayer separation between graphene and boron nitride, which we achieve by\napplying pressure with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. For the special\ncase of aligned or nearly-aligned graphene on boron nitride, the graphene\nlattice can stretch and compress locally to compensate for the slight lattice\nmismatch between the two materials. We find that modifying the interlayer\nseparation directly tunes the lattice strain and induces commensurate stacking\nunderneath the tip. Our results motivate future studies tailoring the\nelectronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures by controlling the\ninterlayer separation of the entire device using hydrostatic pressure.\n", "  In this paper gradient based topology optimization (TO) is used to discover\n3-D phononic structures that exhibit ultra-wide normalized all-angle all-mode\nband gaps. The challenging computational task of repeated 3-D phononic\nband-structure evaluations is accomplished by a combination of a fast mixed\nvariational eigenvalue solver and distributed Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)\nparallel computations. The TO algorithm utilizes the material\ndistribution-based approach and a gradient-based optimizer. The design\nsensitivity for the mixed variational eigenvalue problem is derived using the\nadjoint method and is implemented through highly efficient vectorization\ntechniques. We present optimized results for two-material simple cubic (SC),\nbody centered cubic (BCC), and face centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures and\nshow that in each of these cases different initial designs converge to single\ninclusion network topologies within their corresponding primitive cells. The\noptimized results show that large phononic stop bands for bulk wave propagation\ncan be achieved at lower than close packed spherical configurations leading to\nlighter unit cells. For tungsten carbide - epoxy crystals we identify all angle\nall mode normalized stop bands exceeding 100%, which is larger than what is\npossible with only spherical inclusions.\n", "  We investigate photoproduction of charged $\\rho$ off the nucleon using\n$\\rho(770)+\\pi(140)$ Regge pole exchanges by considering the $\\rho$-meson\nelectromagnetic multipole moments. The significance of the Ward identity at the\n$\\gamma\\rho\\rho$ vertex is emphasized for current conservation in the process.\nGiven $\\pi$ exchange with the well-known coupling constants for $\\gamma\\pi\\rho$\nand $\\pi NN$, we analyze the role of the $\\rho$ exchange in the $\\gamma p\\to\n\\rho^+n$ and $\\gamma n\\to\\rho^-p$ processes without model-dependences except\nfor the magnetic moment $\\mu_{\\rho^\\pm}=\\pm2.01$ and electric quadrupole moment\n${\\cal Q}_{\\rho^\\pm}=\\pm0.027$ fm$^2$ taken from theoretical estimates. The\nnondiffractive feature of both cross sections is reproduced with a rapid\ndecrease beyond the resonance region by the dominance of $\\pi$ exchange over\nthe $\\rho$\\,. % Cross sections for differential and density matrix elements are\npresented to compare with existing data. The parity and photon polarization\nasymmetries are predicted to demonstrate the apparent roles of the $\\rho$-meson\nelectromagnetic multipole moments.\n", "  At low temperature T, the experimental gap of silicon decreases as\nE_g(T)=E_g(0)-AT^4. The main reason is electron-phonon renormalization. The\nphysics behind the T^4-power law is more complex than has been realized.\nRenormalization by intraband scattering requires a careful non-adiabatic\ntreatment in order to correctly include acoustic phonons and avoid divergences\nfrom piezoacoustic phonon interactions. The result is an unexpected low T term\nE_g(0)+A' T^p with positive coefficient A', and power p=4 for non-piezoelectric\nmaterials, and power p=2 for piezoelectric materials. The acoustic phonons in\npiezoelectric semiconductors generate a piezoelectric field, modifying the\nelectron-phonon coupling. However, at higher T, when thermal acoustic phonons\nof energy hbar v_s q acquire energies comparable to the electronic intermediate\nstate (higher than the band-edge state by hbar^2 q^2 /2m*), the low q and\nhigher q intraband contributions to T^p rapidly cancel, giving little thermal\neffect. But there is an additional T-dependence from interband effects of\nacoustic phonons. This turns out to have power law T^4 for both\nnon-piezoelectric and piezoelectric semiconductors. This term can have either\nsign, but usually reduces the size of gaps as T increases. It arises after\ncancellation of the T^2 terms that appear separately in Debye-Waller and Fan\nparts of the acoustic phonon interband renormalization. The cancellation occurs\nbecause of the acoustic sum rule.\n", "  We have investigated single crystals of two substitution series\nCe(Ru$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)PO and CeFe(As$_{1-y}$P$_{y}$)O in the vicinity to the\nquantum critical material CeFePO by means of magnetic-susceptibility and\nspecific-heat measurements. We observe an antiferromagnetic ground state in the\nvicinity of the quantum critical point, with pronounced metamagnetic\ntransitions for $H\\parallel c$, which is the magnetically hard direction. Our\nresults verify that a ferromagnetic quantum critical point is avoided in\nsubstituted CeFePO, because we clearly demonstrate that the ferromagnetic\nground state changes into an antiferromagnetic one, when approaching the\nquantum critical point.\n", "  We launched the VLBI Ecliptic Plane Survey program in 2015. The goal of this\nprogram is to find all compact sources within 7.5 degrees of the ecliptic plane\nwhich are suitable as phase calibrators for anticipated phase referencing\nobservations of spacecrafts. We planned to observe a complete sample of the\nsources brighter than 50 mJy at 5 GHz listed in the PMN and GB6 catalogues that\nhave not yet been observed with VLBI. By April 2016, eight 24-hour sessions\nhave been performed and processed. Among 2227 observed sources, 435 sources\nwere detected in three or more observations. We have also run three 8-hour\nsegments with VLBA for improving positions of 71 ecliptic sources.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of low temperature nonequilibrium transport\nthrough an interacting quantum dot in the presence of Zeeman magnetic field and\ncurrent injection into one of its leads. By using a self-consistent\nrenormalized equation of motion approach, we show that the injection of a\nspin-polarized current leads to a modulation of the Zeeman splitting of the\nKondo peak in the differential conductance. We find that an appropriate amount\nof spin accumulation in the lead can restore the Kondo peak by compensating the\nsplitting due to magnetic field. By contrast when the injected current is\nspin-unpolarized, we establish that both Zeeman-split Kondo peaks are equally\nshifted and the splitting remains unchanged. Our results quantitatively explain\nthe experimental findings reported in KOBAYASHI T. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n104, 036804 (2010). These features could be nicely exploited for the control\nand manipulation of spin in nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.\n", "  We consider the bulk, vertical surface, horizontal surface and corner free\nenergies $f_b, f_s, f'_s, f_c$ of the anisotropic self-dual $Q$-state Potts\nmodel for $Q > 4$. $f_b$ was calculated in 1973[1]. For $Q<4$, $f_s, f'_s$ were\ncalculated in 1989[2]. Here we extend this last calculation to $Q>4$ and find\nagreement with the conjectures made in 2012 by Vernier and Jacobsen (VJ)[3] for\nthe isotropic case. All these four free energies satisfy inversion and rotation\nrelations. Together with some plausible analyticity assumptions, these provide\na less rigorous, but much simpler, way of determining $f_b, f_s, f'_s$. They\nalso imply that $f_c$ is independent of the anisotropy, being a function only\nof $Q$, in which respect they resemble the order parameters of the associated\nsix-vertex model. Hence VJ's conjecture for $f_c$ should apply to the full\nanisotropic model.\n", "  Polarized light microscopy using path-entangled $N$-photon states (i.e., the\nN00N states) has been demonstrated to surpass the shot-noise limit at very low\nlight illumination. However, the microscopy images suffer from divergence of\nphase sensitivity, which inevitably reduces the image quality. Here, we show\nthat due to experimental imperfections, such a singularity also takes place in\nthe microscopy that uses twin-Fock states of light for illumination. We propose\ntwo schemes to completely eliminate this singularity: (i) locking the phase\nshift sensed by the beams at the optimal working point, by using a spatially\ndependent offset phase; (ii) a combination of two binary-outcome photon\ncounting measurements, one with a fixed offset phase and the other without any\noffset phase. Our observations remain valid for any kind of binary-outcome\nmeasurement and may open the way for quantum-enhanced microscopy with high $N$\nphoton states.\n", "  We report about the optical and electrical characterization of three high\nefficiency and blue sensitive Silicon photomultipliers from FBK, Hamamatsu, and\nSensL. Key features of the tested devices when operated at 90% breakdown\nprobability are peak photon detection efficiencies between 40% and 55%,\ntemperature dependencies of gain and PDE that are less than 1%/$^{\\circ}$C,\ndark rates of $\\sim$50\\,kHz/mm$^{2}$ at room temperature, afterpulsing of about\n2%, and direct optical crosstalk between 6% and 20%. The characteristics of all\nthree devices impressively demonstrate how the Silicon-photomultiplier\ntechnology has improved over the past ten years. It is further demonstrated how\nthe voltage and temperature characteristics of a number of quantities can be\nparameterized on the basis of physical models. The models provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the device characteristics over a wide bias and temperature\nrange. They also serve as examples how producers could provide the\ncharacteristics of their SiPMs to users. A standardized parameterization of\nSiPMs would enable users to find the optimal SiPM for their application and the\noperating point of SiPMs without having to perform measurements thus\nsignificantly reducing design and development cycles.\n", "  We consider classical message transmission under entanglement assistance for\ncompound memoryless and arbitrarily varying quantum channels. In both cases, we\nprove general coding theorems together with corresponding weak converse bounds.\nIn this way, we obtain single-letter characterizations of the\nentanglement-assisted classical capacities for both channel models. Moreover,\nwe show that the entanglement-assisted classical capacity does exhibit no\nstrong converse property for some compound quantum channels for the average as\nwell as the maximal error criterion. A strong converse to the\nentanglement-assisted classical capacities does hold for each arbitrarily\nvarying quantum channel.\n", "  We present deep near-infrared spectra for a sample of 24 quiescent galaxies\nin the redshift range 1.5 < z < 2.5 obtained with the MOSFIRE spectrograph at\nthe W. M. Keck Observatory. In conjunction with a similar dataset we obtained\nin the range 1 < z < 1.5 with the LRIS spectrograph, we analyze the kinematic\nand structural properties for 80 quiescent galaxies, the largest\nhomogeneously-selected sample to date spanning 3 Gyr of early cosmic history.\nAnalysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated\nHST images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller\nsizes to redshifts beyond z~2. By classifying our sample according to Sersic\nindices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher\ndynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we\ninterpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For\nthis subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the\ncircular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two\nlarger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity\ndispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical\nto stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size\ngrowth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a\nfaster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this\ntime-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the\nsystematic rotation.\n", "  Some general properties of the wave functions of complex-valued potentials\nwith real spectrum are studied. The main results are presented in a series of\nlemmas, corollaries and theorems that are satisfied by the zeros of the real\nand imaginary parts of the wave functions on the real line. In particular, it\nis shown that such zeros interlace so that the corresponding probability\ndensities $\\rho(x)$ are never null. We find that the profile of the imaginary\npart $V_I(x)$ of a given complex-valued potential determines the number and\ndistribution of the maxima and minima of the related probability densities. Our\nconjecture is that $V_I(x)$ must be continuous in $\\mathbb R$, and that its\nintegral over all the real line must be equal to zero in order to get control\non the distribution of the maxima and minima of $\\rho(x)$. The applicability of\nthese results is shown by solving the eigenvalue equation of different complex\npotentials, these last being either ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric or not invariant\nunder the ${\\cal PT}$-transformation.\n", "  We study the geometry of the space of Mermin pentagrams, objects that are\nused to rule out the existence of noncontextual hidden variable theories as\nalternatives to quantum theory. It is shown that this space of 12096 possible\npentagrams is organized into 1008 families, with each family containing a\n\"double six\" of pentagrams. The 1008 families are connected to a special set of\nVeldkamp lines in the Veldkamp space of three qubits an object well-known to\nfinite geometers but has only been introduced to physics recently. Due to the\ntransitive action of the symplectic group on this set of Veldkamp lines it is\nenough to study only one \"canonical\" double six configuration of pentagrams. We\nprove that the geometry of this double-six configuration is encapsulated in the\nweight diagram of the 20 dimensional irreducible representation of the group\n$SU(6)$. As an interesting by-product of our approach we show that Mermin\npentagrams and a class of Mermin squares labelled by three qubit Pauli\noperators are inherently related. We conjecture that by studying the\nrepresentation theoretic content of other Veldkamp lines of the Veldkamp space\nfor $N$-qubits makes it possible to find new contextual configurations in a\nsystematic manner.\n", "  Pragmatic ways of including lifetime broadening of collective modes in the\nelectron liquid are critically compared. Special focus lies on the impact of\nthe damping parameter onto the dispersion. It is quantitatively exemplified for\nthe two-dimensional case, for both, the charge (`sheet'-)plasmon and the\nspin-density plasmon. The predicted deviations fall within the resolution\nlimits of advanced techniques.\n", "  The method of QCD sum rules at finite temperature is reviewed, with emphasis\non recent results. These include predictions for the survival of charmonium and\nbottonium states, at and beyond the critical temperature for de-confinement, as\nlater confirmed by lattice QCD simulations. Also included are determinations in\nthe light-quark vector and axial-vector channels, allowing to analyse the\nWeinberg sum rules, and predict the dimuon spectrum in heavy ion collisions in\nthe region of the rho-meson. Also in this sector, the determination of the\ntemperature behaviour of the up-down quark mass, together with the pion decay\nconstant, will be described. Finally, an extension of the QCD sum rule method\nto incorporate finite baryon chemical potential is reviewed.\n", "  In this paper we outline a method for a compiler to translate any non fault\ntolerant quantum circuit to the geometric representation of the lattice surgery\nerror-correcting code using inherent merge and split operations. Since the\nefficiency of state distillation procedures has not yet been investigated in\nthe lattice surgery model, their translation is given as an example using the\nproposed method. The resource requirements seem comparable to the defect-based\nstate distillation process, but modularity and eventual implementability allow\nthe lattice surgery model to be an interesting alternative to braiding.\n", "  We apply the generalized Boltzmann theory to describe thermoelectric\ntransport properties of monolayer phosphorene in the presence of short- and\nlong-range charged impurity interactions. First, we propose a low-energy\nHamiltonian to explore the accurate electronic band structure of phosphorene in\ncomparison with those results obtained by density-functional simulations. We\nexplain the effect of the coupling between the conduction and valence bands on\nthe thermoelectric properties. We show that the electric conductivity of\nphosphorene is highly anisotropic, while the Seebeck coefficient and figure of\nmerit, without being influenced via either the presence or absence of the\ncoupling term, are nearly isotropic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nconductivity for the $n$ type of doping is more influenced by the coupling term\nthan that of the $p$ type. Along with thermopower sign change, profound\nthermoelectric effects can be achieved.\n", "  We study the mean first exit time $T_{\\ve}$ of a particle diffusing in a\ncircular or a spherical micro-domain with an impenetrable confining boundary\ncontaining a small escape window (EW) of an angular size $\\ve$. Focusing on the\neffects of an energy/entropy barrier at the EW, and of the long-range\ninteractions (LRI) with the boundary on the diffusive search for the EW, we\ndevelop a self-consistent approximation to derive for $T_{\\ve}$ a general\nexpression, akin to the celebrated Collins-Kimball relation in chemical\nkinetics and accounting for both rate-controlling factors in an explicit way.\nOur analysis reveals that the barrier-induced contribution to $T_{\\ve}$ is the\ndominant one in the limit $\\ve \\to 0$, implying that the narrow escape problem\nis not \"diffusion-limited\" but rather \"barrier-limited\". We present the\nsmall-$\\ve$ expansion for $T_{\\ve}$, in which the coefficients in front of the\nleading terms are expressed via some integrals and derivatives of the LRI\npotential. On example of a triangular-well potential, we show that $T_{\\ve}$ is\nnon-monotonic with respect to the extent of the attractive LRI, being minimal\nfor the ones having an intermediate extent, neither too concentrated on the\nboundary nor penetrating too deeply into the bulk. Our analytical predictions\nare in a good agreement with the numerical simulations.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the randomly pinned Fredrickson-Andersen model\non the Bethe lattice. We find a line of random pinning dynamical transitions\nwhose dynamical critical properties are in the same universality class of the\n$A_2$ and $A_3$ transitions of Mode Coupling Theory. The $A_3$ behavior appears\nat the terminal point, where the relaxation becomes logarithmic and the\nrelaxation time diverges exponentially. We explain the critical behavior in\nterms of self-induced disorder and avalanches, strengthening the relationship\ndiscussed in recent works between glassy dynamics and Random Field Ising Model.\n", "  We calculate the emission spectra, the Glauber $g^{(2)}$ function, and the\nentanglement of formation for a few two-level emitters coupled to a single\ncavity mode and subject to an external laser-excitation. To evaluate these\nquantities we couple the system to environmental degrees of freedom which leads\nto dissipative dynamics. Because of the periodic time-dependence of the system\nHamiltonian, the coefficients of the (Markovian) master equation are constant\nif Floquet states are used as the computational basis. Studying the emission\nspectra we show that the dynamic Stark effect, i.e., the shift of spectral\nlines, first appears in the second order of the laser intensity. For the\nGlauber function, we find clearly distinguished parameter regimes of super- and\nsub-Poissonian light emission and explain the additional features appearing for\nfinite laser intensity in terms of the quasienergy spectrum of the driven\nemitter-cavity system. Finally, we analyze the temperature and emitter-cavity\ncoupling regimes where entanglement among the emitters is generated, and show\nthat the laser-excitation leads to a decrease of entanglement.\n", "  We explore the effective degrees of freedom in the early universe, from\nbefore the electroweak scale at a few femtoseconds after the Big Bang, until\nthe last positrons disappeared a few minutes later. We first look at the\nestablished concepts of effective degrees of freedom for energy density,\npressure and entropy density, and introduce effective degrees of freedom for\nnumber density as well. We discuss what happens with particle species as their\ntemperature cools down from relativistic to semi- and non-relativistic\ntemperatures, and then annihilates completely. This will affect the pressure as\nwell as the entropy per particle. We also look at the transition from a\nquark-gluon plasma to a hadron gas. Using a list of known hadrons, we use a\n\"cross-over\" temperature of 214 MeV where the effective degrees of freedom for\na quark-gluon plasma equals that of a hadron gas.\n", "  Recently there has been a growing interest in quantum gravity theories with\nmore than four derivatives, including both their quantum and classical aspects.\nIn this work we extend the recent results concerning the non-singularity of the\nmodified Newtonian potential to the most relevant case in which the propagator\nhas complex poles. The model we consider is Einstein-Hilbert action augmented\nby curvature-squared higher-derivative terms which contain polynomials on the\nd'Alembert operator. We show that the classical potential of these theories is\na real quantity and it is regular at the origin disregard the (complex or real)\nnature or the multiplicity of the massive poles. The expression for the\npotential is explicitly derived for some interesting particular cases. Finally,\nthe issue of the mechanism behind the cancellation of the singularity is\ndiscussed; specifically we argue that the regularity of the potential can hold\neven if the number of massive tensor modes and scalar ones is not the same.\n", "  Strong electronic correlations related to a repulsive local interaction\nsuppress the electronic compressibility in a single-band model, and the\ncapacitance of a corresponding metallic film is directly related to its\nelectronic compressibility. Both statements may be altered significantly when\ntwo extensions to the system are implemented which we investigate here: (i) we\nintroduce an attractive nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ as antagonist to the\nrepulsive on-site repulsion $U$, and (ii) we consider nano-structured\nmultilayers (heterostructures) assembled from two-dimensional layers of these\nsystems. We determine the respective total compressibility $\\kappa$ and\ncapacitance $C$ of the heterostructures within a strong coupling evaluation,\nwhich builds on a Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson technique. Whereas the\ncapacitance $C(n)$ for electronic densities $n$ close to half-filling is\nsuppressed---illustrated by a correlation induced dip in $C(n)$---it may be\nappreciably enhanced close to a van Hove singularity. Moreover, we show that\nthe capacitance may be a non-monotonic function of $U$ close to half-filling\nfor both attractive and repulsive $V$. The compressibility $\\kappa$ can differ\nfrom $C$ substantially, as $\\kappa$ is very sensitive to internal electrostatic\nenergies which in turn depend on the specific set-up of the heterostructure. In\nparticular, we show that a capacitor with a polar dielectric has a smaller\nelectronic compressibility and is more stable against phase separation than a\nstandard non-polar capacitor with the same capacitance.\n", "  I analyze the low temperature limit of the BCS theory of s-wave single-band\nsuperconductors, when the attraction band may be asymmetric with respect to the\nchemical potential. I discuss equilibrium systems, taking consistently into\naccount the variation of the energy and of the total number of particles with\nthe populations of the quasiparticle energy levels. I show that the equation\nfor the energy gap has two solutions, one of which is stable and the other one\nis metastable. When the chemical potential is the center of the attraction band\n(the standard BCS assumption), the energy gap in the stable solution is\n$\\Delta_0$, whereas in the metastable one is $\\Delta_0/3$. If the chemical\npotential is not in the center of the attraction band, then a quasiparticle\nimbalance appears. If the absolute value of the difference between the chemical\npotential and center of the attraction band is bigger than $2\\Delta_0$, then\nthe superconducting energy gap cannot be formed. If the number of particles is\nconserved and the attraction band is asymmetric, then the stable solution is\nunphysical and only metastable solutions are realized.\n", "  The effects of wet chemical processing conventionally employed in device\nfabrication standards are systematically studied on molybdenum oxide (MoOx)\nultra-thin films. We have combined x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),\nangle resolved XPS and x-ray reflectivity techniques to provide deep insights\ninto the changes in composition, structure and electronic states upon treatment\nof films with different initial stoichiometry prepared by reactive sputtering.\nOur results show significant reduction effects associated with the development\nof gap states in MoOx, as well as changes in the composition, density and\nstructure of the films, systematically correlated with the initial oxidation\nstate of Mo.\n", "  We implement the method developed in [1] to construct the most general\nparametrised action for linear cosmological perturbations of bimetric theories\nof gravity. Specifically, we consider perturbations around a homogeneous and\nisotropic background, and identify the complete form of the action invariant\nunder diffeomorphism transformations, as well as the number of free parameters\ncharacterising this cosmological class of theories. We discuss, in detail, the\ncase without derivative interactions, and compare our results with those found\nin massive bigravity.\n", "  The histories-based framework of Quantum Measure Theory assigns a generalized\nprobability or measure $\\mu(E)$ to every (suitably regular) set $E$ of\nhistories. Even though $\\mu(E)$ cannot in general be interpreted as the\nexpectation value of a selfadjoint operator (or POVM), we describe an\narrangement which makes it possible to determine $\\mu(E)$ experimentally for\nany desired $E$. Taking, for simplicity, the system in question to be a\nparticle passing through a series of Stern-Gerlach devices or beam-splitters,\nwe show how to couple a set of ancillas to it, and then to perform on them a\nsuitable unitary transformation followed by a final measurement, such that the\nprobability of a final outcome of \"yes\" is related to $\\mu(E)$ by a known\nfactor of proportionality. Finally, we discuss in what sense a positive outcome\nof the final measurement should count as a minimally disturbing verification\nthat the microscopic event $E$ actually happened.\n", "  L. Vervoort [arxiv:1406.0901] claims to have found a model which \"can violate\nthe Bell inequality and reproduce the quantum statistics, even if it is based\non local dynamics only\". This claim is false. The proposed model contains\nglobal elements. The physics behind the model is local, but would not allow the\nexplanation of violations of Bell inequalities for space-like separated events,\nif superluminal causal influences are forbidden. To use it for this purpose,\none has to introduce a preferred frame where information can be send faster\nthan light.\n  As a cause of the misunderstanding we identify the unfortunate convention to\nuse \"local\" as a synonym for Einstein-local, so that theories which are local\nin every physically relevant sense have to be named \"non-local\", and argue that\nthis convention should be abandoned.\n", "  A discussion is given on the interpretation and physical importance of the\nMinkowski momentum in macroscopic electrodynamics (essential for the\nAbraham-Minkowski problem). We focus on the following two facets: (1) Adopting\na simple dielectric model where the refractive index $n$ is constant, we\ndemonstrate by means of a mapping procedure how the electromagnetic field in a\nmedium can be mapped into a corresponding field in vacuum. This mapping was\npresented many years ago [I. Brevik and B. Lautrup, Mat. Fys. Medd. Dan. Vid.\nSelsk {\\bf 38}(1), 1 (1970)], but is apparently not well known. A\ncharacteristic property of this procedure is that it shows how natural the\nMinkowski energy-momentum tensor fits into the canonical formalism. Especially\nthe spacelike character of the electromagnetic total four-momentum for a\nradiation field (implying negative electromagnetic energy in some inertial\nframes), so strikingly demonstrated in the Cherenkov effect, is worth\nattention. (2) Our second objective is to give a critical analysis of some\nrecent experiments on electromagnetic momentum. Care must here be taken in the\ninterpretations: it is easy to be misled and conclude that an experiment is\nimportant for the energy-momentum problem, while what is demonstrated\nexperimentally is merely the action of the Abraham-Minkowski force acting in\nsurface layers or inhomogeneous regions. The Abraham-Minkowski force is common\nfor the two energy-momentum tensors and carries no information about field\nmomentum. As a final item, we propose an experiment that might show the\nexistence of the Abraham force at high frequencies. This would eventually be a\nwelcome optical analogue to the classic low-frequency 1975 Lahoz-Walker\nexperiment.\n", "  From the analysis of the relaxation process of isolated lattice many-body\nquantum systems quenched far from equilibrium, we deduce a criterion for\npredicting when they are certain to thermalize. It is based on the algebraic\nbehavior $\\propto t^{-\\gamma}$ of the survival probability at long times. We\nshow that the value of the power-law exponent $\\gamma$ depends on the shape and\nfilling of the weighted energy distribution of the initial state. Two scenarios\nare explored in details: $\\gamma \\ge 2$ and $\\gamma <1$. Exponents $\\gamma \\ge\n2$ imply that the energy distribution of the initial state is ergodically\nfilled and the eigenstates are uncorrelated, so thermalization is guaranteed to\nhappen. In this case, the power-law behavior is caused by bounds in the energy\nspectrum. Decays with $\\gamma < 1$ emerge when the energy eigenstates are\ncorrelated and signal lack of ergodicity. They are typical of systems\nundergoing localization due to strong onsite disorder and are found also in\nclean integrable systems.\n", "  The advantage of particle Lagrangian methods in computational fluid dynamics\nis that advection is accurately modeled. However, this complicates the\ncalculation of space derivatives. If a mesh is employed, it must be updated at\neach time step. On the other hand, fixed mesh, Eulerian, formulations benefit\nfrom the mesh being defined at the beginning of the simulation, but feature\nnon-linear advection terms. It therefore seems natural to combine the two\napproaches, using a fixed mesh to perform calculations related to space\nderivatives, and using the particles to advect the information with time. The\nidea of combining Lagrangian particles and a fixed mesh goes back to\nParticle-in-Cell methods, and is here considered within the context of the\nfinite element method (FEM) for the fixed mesh, and the particle FEM (pFEM) for\nthe particles.\n  Our results, in agreement with recent works, show that interpolation\n(\"projection\") errors, especially from particles to mesh, are the culprits of\nslow convergence of the method if standard, linear, FEs, are employed. By\nincluding quadratically consistent shape functions for the particles, the rate\nof convergence is restored to values competitive with purely Lagrangian\nsimulations.\n  The procedure is validated on the Zalesak's disk problem, the Taylor-Green\nvortex sheet flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.\n", "  Nieuwenhuizen argued that there exists some \"contextuality loophole\" in\nBell's theorem. This claim is unjustified. In Bell's theorem non-contextuality\nis not presupposed but derived from Einstein causality using the EPR argument.\n", "  We present a gating scheme to separate even strong parallel conductance from\nthe magneto-transport signatures and properties of a two-dimensional electron\nsystem. By varying the electron density in the parallel conducting layer, we\ncan study the impact of mobile charge carriers in the vicinity of the dopant\nlayer on the properties of the two-dimensional electron system. It is found\nthat the parallel conducting layer is indeed capable to screen the remote\nionized impurity potential fluctuations responsible for the fragility of\nfractional quantum Hall states.\n", "  We present a class of general prolate and oblate spheroidal spacetimes for\nthe description of cosmic structures in the Universe. They are exact geometries\nwhich represent, in an appropriated way, the imbedding of spheroidal\nmatter-energy distributions within a standard cosmological scenario, and\ntherefore they allow for an improved description of a wider class of\nastrophysical systems from a more accurate point of view. These spacetimes can\nbe used to describe overdensity or underdensity regions; in this work we\nconsider the last case, that is, the description of cosmic voids. We introduce\nand study a model of void which is a generalization of a simpler one in\nspherical symmetry and we use it for the calculation of weak lensing optical\nscalars as a non-trivial and interesting application. In this particular\nexample we show the rich observable features that can be found in such models.\n", "  We perform combined density functional and dynamical mean-field calculations\nto study the pyrochlore iridates Lu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and\nEu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Both single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field\ncalculations are performed and spin-orbit coupling is included. Paramagnetic\nmetallic phases, antiferromagnetic metallic phases with tilted Weyl cones and\nantiferromagnetic insulating phases are found. The magnetic phases display\nall-in/all-out magnetic ordering, consistent with previous studies. Unusually\nfor electronically three dimensional materials, the single-site dynamical\nmean-field approximation fails to reproduce qualitative material trends,\npredicting in particular that the paramagnetic phase properties of\nY$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ are almost identical, although in\nexperiments the Y compound has a much higher resistance than the Eu compound.\nThis qualitative failure is attributed to the importance of intersite magnetic\ncorrelations in the physics of these materials.\n", "  In multiphase flow phenomena, bubbles and droplets are advected, deformed,\nbreak up into smaller ones, and coalesce with each other. A primary challenge\nof classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for such flows is to\neffectively describe a transition zone between phases across which physical\nproperties vary steeply but continuously. Based on the van der Waals theory,\nAllen-Cahn phase field method describes the face-to-face existence of two\nfluids with a free-energy functional of mass density or molar concentration,\nwithout imposing topological constraints on interface as phase boundary. In\nthis article, a CFD simulation methodology is described by solving the\nAllen-Cahn-Navier-Stokes equations using a wavelet collocation method. The\nsecond order temporal accuracy is verified by simulating a moving sharp\ninterface. The average terminal velocity of a rising gas bubble in a liquid\nthat is computed by the present method has agreed with that computed by a\nlaboratory experiment. The calculation of the surface tension force by the\npresent method also shows an excellent agreement with what was obtained by an\nexperiment. The up-welling and down-welling disturbances in a Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability are computed and compared with that from a reference numerical\nsimulation. These results show that the wavelet based phase-field method is an\nefficient CFD simulation technique for gas-liquid or liquid-liquid flows.\n", "  There is currently a big effort put into the operation and construction of\nworld class neutron scattering facilities (SNS and SNS-TS2 in the US, J-PARC in\nJapan, ESS in Europe, CSS in China, PIK in Russia). On the other hand, there\nexists a network of smaller neutron scattering facilities which play a key role\nin creating a large neutron scattering community who is able to efficiently use\nthe existing facilities. With the foreseen closure of the ageing nuclear\nresearch reactors, especially in Europe there is a risk of seeing a shrinking\nof the community who would then be able to use efficiently the world class\nfacilities. There is thus a reflection being conducted in several countries for\nthe replacement of smaller research reactors with low energy accelerator based\nsources. We consider here a reference design for a compact neutron source based\non existing accelerator components. We estimate the performances of various\ntypes of neutron scattering instruments built around such a source. The results\nsuggest that nowadays state of the art neutron scattering experiments could be\nsuccessfully performed on such a compact source and that it is thus a viable\nreplacement solution for neutron research reactors.\n", "  We aim at building an accelerator based compact neutron source which would\nprovide a thermal neutron flux on the order of 4E12 n.s-1.cm-2.sr-1. Such\nbrilliance would put compact neutron sources on par with existing medium flux\nneutron research reactors. We performed the first neutron production tests on\nthe IPHI proton accelerator at Saclay. The neutron fluxes were measured using\ngold foil activation and 3He detectors. The measured fluxes were compared with\nMCNP and GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations in which the whole experimental setup\nwas modelled. There is a good agreement between the experimental measurements\nand the Monte-Carlo simulations. The available modelling tools will allow us to\noptimize the whole Target Moderator Reflector assembly together with the\nneutron scattering spectrometer geometries.\n", "  The repetition rate stabilization of an optical frequency comb based on\ndiode-pumped solid-state laser technology is demonstrated using an intra-cavity\nelectro-optic modulator. The large feedback bandwidth of such modulators allows\ndisciplining the comb repetition rate on a cavity-stabilized continuous-wave\nlaser with a locking bandwidth up to 700 kHz. This surpasses what can be\nachieved with any other type of actuator reported so far. An in-loop integrated\nphase noise of 133 mrad has been measured and the PM-to-AM coupling of the\nelectro-optic modulator has been investigated as well.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a simplified model to understand the location of\nSaturn's F ring. The model is a planar restricted five-body problem defined by\nthe gravitational field of Saturn, including its second zonal harmonic $J_2$,\nthe shepherd moons Prometheus and Pandora, and Titan. We compute accurate\nlong-time numerical integrations of (about 2.5 million) non-interacting\ntest-particles initially located in the region between the orbits of Prometheus\nand Pandora, and address whether they escape or remain trapped in this region.\nWe obtain a wide region of initial conditions of the test particles that remain\nconfined. We consider a dynamical stability indicator for the test particles'\nmotion defined by computing the ratio of the standard deviation over the\naverage value of relevant dynamical quantities, in particular, for the\nmean-motion and the semi-major axis. This indicator separates clearly a subset\nof trapped initial conditions that appear as very localized stripes in the\ninitial semi-major axis and eccentricity space for the most stable orbits.\nRetaining only these test particles, we obtain a narrow eccentric ring which\ndisplays sharp edges and collective alignment. The semi-major axis of the\naccumulation stripes of the stable ring-particles can be associated with\nresonances, mostly involving Prometheus' outer Lindblad and co-rotation\nresonances, but not exclusively. Pandora's inner Lindblad and co-rotation\nresonances as well as low-order three-body resonances typically coincide with\ngaps, i.e., regions of instabilities. Comparison of our results with the\nnominal data for the F ring shows some correspondence.\n", "  To explore nontrivial photoinduced modulations of charge correlations, we\ntheoretically study photoinduced dynamics in quarter-filled extended Hubbard\nmodels with competing intersite repulsive interactions on triangular lattices\nwith trimers, where the end points are crystallographically equivalent. The\nexact diagonalization method is used and the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is numerically solved during and after photoexcitation. Time-averaged\ndouble occupancy and intersite density-density correlations can be interpreted\nas due to effective on-site and intersite repulsive interactions, respectively,\nrelative to transfer energies. In the case where the intersite repulsive\ninteractions compete with each other, the anisotropy of their effective\ninteractions can be enhanced with the help of the trimers, irrespective of\nwhether the trimers are linear or bent. In particular, in the case where the\narrangement of the trimers is close to that in\n$\\alpha$-(bis[ethylenedithio]-tetrathiafulvalene)$_2$I$_3$\n[$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$] in the metallic phase, the effective on-site\nrepulsion is enhanced relative to the transfer energies. The relevance of this\ntheoretical finding to the experimentally observed optical freezing of charge\nmotion is discussed.\n", "  In van der Waals multilayers of triangular lattice, trigonal warping occurs\nuniversally due to the interlayer hopping. We theoretically investigate the\neffect of trigonal warping upon distinctive topological phases, like the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and the quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE).\nTaking Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene as an example, we find that the trigonal\nwarping plays a crucial role in the formation of QAHE in large exchange field\nand/or interlayer potential difference by inducing extra band inversion points\nat momentum further away from high symmetric point. The presence of trigonal\nwarping shrinks the phase space of QAHE and QVHE, leading to the emergence of\nvalley-polarized QAHE with high Chern numbers ranging from $ \\mathcal{C}=-7 $\nto $ 7 $. These results suggest that the universal trigonal warping may play\nimportant role when the Bloch states at momentum away from high-symmetric\npoints are involved.\n", "  We point out that a primordial magnetic field can be generated in the\nelectroweak phase transition by a non-Abelian bootstrap, where the field is\ngenerated by currents of W's, which in turn are extracted from the vacuum by\nthe magnetic field. This magnetic field is produced as a vortex condensate at\nthe electroweak phase transition. It becomes stringy as a consequence of the\ndynamical evolution due to magnetohydrodynamics.\n", "  In this paper we suggest that in the framework of the Category Theory it is\npossible to demonstrate the mathematical and logical \\textit{dual equivalence}\nbetween the category of the $q$-deformed Hopf Coalgebras and the category of\nthe $q$-deformed Hopf Algebras in QFT, interpreted as a thermal field theory.\nEach pair algebra-coalgebra characterizes, indeed, a QFT system and its\nmirroring thermal bath, respectively, so to model dissipative quantum systems\npersistently in far-from-equilibrium conditions, with an evident significance\nalso for biological sciences. The $q$-deformed Hopf Coalgebras and the\n$q$-deformed Hopf Algebras constitute two dual categories because characterized\nby the same functor $T$, related with the Bogoliubov transform, and by its\ncontravariant application $T^{op}$, respectively. The \\textit{q}-deformation\nparameter, indeed, is related to the Bogoliubov angle, and it is effectively a\nthermal parameter. Therefore, the different values of $q$ identify univocally,\nand then label, the vacua appearing in the foliation process of the quantum\nvacuum. This means that, in the framework of Universal Coalgebra, as general\ntheory of dynamic and computing systems (\"labelled state-transition systems\"),\nthe so labelled infinitely many quantum vacua can be interpreted as the Final\nCoalgebra of an \"Infinite State Black-Box Machine\". All this opens the way to\nthe possibility of designing a new class of universal quantum computing\narchitectures based on this coalgebraic formulation of QFT, as its ability of\nnaturally generating a Fibonacci progression demonstrates.\n", "  Energy level splitting from the unitary limit of contact interactions to the\nnear unitary limit for a few identical atoms in an effectively one-dimensional\nwell can be understood as an example of symmetry breaking. At the unitary limit\nin addition to particle permutation symmetry there is a larger symmetry\ncorresponding to exchanging the $N!$ possible orderings of $N$ particles. In\nthe near unitary limit, this larger symmetry is broken, and different shapes of\ntraps break the symmetry to different degrees. This brief note exploits these\nsymmetries to present a useful, geometric analogy with graph theory and build\nan algebraic framework for calculating energy splitting in the near unitary\nlimit.\n", "  In this paper, a control approach called Artificial Neural Tissue (ANT) is\napplied to multirobot excavation for lunar base preparation tasks including\nclearing landing pads and burying of habitat modules. We show for the first\ntime, a team of autonomous robots excavating a terrain to match a given 3D\nblueprint. Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical\nshielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules\nunder 0.5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding\nand maintain temperatures of -25 $^{o}$C. This minimizes base life-support\ncomplexity and reduces launch mass. ANT is compelling for a lunar mission\nbecause it doesn't require a team of astronauts for excavation and it requires\nminimal supervision. The robot teams are shown to autonomously interpret\nblueprints, excavate and prepare sites for a lunar base. Because little\npre-programmed knowledge is provided, the controllers discover creative\ntechniques. ANT evolves techniques such as slot-dozing that would otherwise\nrequire excavation experts. This is critical in making an excavation mission\nfeasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers\nevolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters. These and\nother techniques such as concurrent evolution of the controller and team size\nare shown to tackle problem of antagonism, when too many robots interfere\nreducing the overall efficiency or worse, resulting in gridlock. While many\nchallenges remain with this technology our work shows a compelling pathway for\nfield testing this approach.\n", "  The miniaturization of electronics, sensors and actuators has enabled the\ngrowing use of CubeSats and sub-20 kg spacecraft. Their reduced mass and volume\nhas the potential to translate into significant reductions in required\npropellant and launch mass for interplanetary missions, earth observation and\nfor astrophysics applications. There is an important need to optimize the\ndesign of these spacecraft to better ascertain their maximal capabilities by\nfinding optimized solution, where mass, volume and power is a premium. Current\nspacecraft design methods require a team of experts, who use their engineering\nexperience and judgement to develop a spacecraft design. Such an approach can\nmiss innovative designs not thought of by a human design team. In this work we\npresent a compelling alternative approach that extends the capabilities of a\nspacecraft engineering design team to search for and identify near-optimal\nsolutions using machine learning. The approach enables automated design of a\nspacecraft that requires specifying quantitative goals, requiring reaching a\ntarget location or operating at a predetermined orbit for a required time. Next\na virtual warehouse of components is specified that be selected to produce a\ncandidate design. Candidate designs are produced using an artificial Darwinian\napproach, where fittest design survives and reproduce, while unfit individuals\nare culled off. Our past work in space robotic has produced systems designs and\ncontrollers that are human competitive. Finding a near-optimal solution\npresents vast improvements over a solution obtained through engineering\njudgment and point design alone. The approach shows a credible pathway to\nidentify and evaluate many more candidate designs than it would be otherwise\npossible with a human design team alone.\n", "  The optical properties of dielectric plates coated with gapped graphene are\ninvestigated on the basis of first principles of quantum electrodynamics. The\nreflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene-coated plates are\nexpressed in terms of the polarization tensor of gapped graphene and the\ndielectric permittivity of plate material. Simple approximate expressions for\nthe required combinations of components of the polarization tensor applicable\nin the wide frequency region, where the presence of a gap influences the\noptical properties, are found. Numerical computations of the reflectivities of\ngraphene-coated SiO${}_2$ plates are performed for different values of the\nmass-gap parameter at different temperatures. It is shown that with an\nincreasing gap width the reflectivity of a graphene-coated plate at the normal\nincidence decreases by up to a factor of 8 depending on the values of frequency\nand mass-gap parameter. The angle dependences of reflectivities for both\npolarizations of the incident electromagnetic waves have been computed for Si\nand SiO${}_2$ plates coated with gapped graphene. We demonstrate that the TM\nreflectivity has a minimum value at some angle of incidence depending on the\nmass-gap parameter, frequency and temperature, whereas the TE reflectivity\ndepends on the angle of incidence monotonously. However, for the graphene\ncoatings with a nonzero mass-gap parameter the reflected light cannot be fully\npolarized. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.\n", "  Source detection in counting type experiments such as Cherenkov telescopes\noften involves the application of the classical Eq. 17 from the paper of Li &\nMa (1983) to discrete on- and off-source regions. The on- source region is\ntypically a circular area with radius {\\theta} in which the signal is expected\nto appear with the shape of the instrument point spread function (PSF). This\npaper addresses the question of what is the {\\theta} that maximises the\nprobability of detection for a given PSF width and background event density. In\nthe high count number limit and assuming a Gaussian PSF profile, the optimum is\nfound to be at $\\zeta_\\infty^2 \\approx 2.51$ times the squared PSF width\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{PSF39}^2$. While this number is shown to be a good choice in\nmany cases, a dynamic formula for cases of lower count numbers, which favour\nlarger on-source regions, is given. The recipe to get to this parametrisation\ncan also be applied to cases with a non-Gaussian PSF. This result can\nstandardise and simplify analysis procedures, reduce trials and eliminate the\nneed for experience-based ad hoc cut definitions or expensive case-by-case\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Many aquatic organisms exhibit remarkable abilities to detect and track\nchemical signals when foraging, mating and escaping. For example, the male\ncopepod { \\em T. longicornis} identifies the female in the open ocean by\nfollowing its chemically-flavored trail. Here, we develop a mathematical\nframework in which a local sensory system is able to detect the local\nconcentration field and adjust its orientation accordingly. We show that this\nsystem is able to detect and track chemical trails without knowing the trail's\nglobal or relative position.\n", "  Nanoporous carbon has been extensively used in a wide range of applications\nranging from water treatment to electrochemical applications, such as in energy\nstorage devices. An effort to relate structural to thermodynamical properties\nhas not been explored from an atomistic approach. In this work we present\nnumerical strategies to produce and study nanoporous carbon structures, using\nmolecular dynamics simulations and a many-body potential. We designed a\nheating-quenching procedure in a thermodynamic region bounded by the critical,\nand triple point densities of carbon to study an ensemble of 1750 atomic\narrangements produced at different densities, quench rates, and using graphite\nand diamond unit cells as precursor structures. All these samples were\nnumerically characterized through the calculation of the free volumes, surface\nareas, radial distribution functions, and structure factors. We found\nparticularly useful the potential energy dependence with $sp^3$ hybridization\ncontent, to determine structural phases through clustering methods. Three\nphases were related to graphite-like, sponge-like, and unstable states. We\nshowed that our results are compatible with available experiments and different\ntheoretical schemes, concluding that the use of Tersoff potential is a reliable\nchoice to produce nanoporous structures with low computational cost.\n", "  The Dirac's method for constrained systems is applied to the analysis of\ntime-dependent Hamiltonians in the extended phase space. Our analysis provides\na conceptually complete description and offers a different point of view of\nearlier works. We show that the Lewis invariant is a Dirac's observable and in\nconsequence, it is invariant under time-reparametrizations. We compute the\nFeynman propagator using the extended phase space description and show that the\nquantum phase of the Feynman propagator is given by the boundary term of the\ncanonical transformation of the extended phase space. We also give a new light\nto the physical character of this phase.\n", "  We have investigated the diffuse reflection probabilities of Replica guides\nfor ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) using the so-called helium method. For the first\ntime we could establish a consistent description of the diffuse reflection\nmechanism for different lengths of the guide system. The transmission of the\nguides is measured depending on the helium pressure inside of the guides. A\nseries of simulations was done to reproduce the experimental data. These\nsimulations showed that a diffuse reflection probability of $d = (3.0 \\pm 0.5)\n\\cdot 10^{-2}$ sufficiently describes the experimental data.\n", "  We consider a curved Sitnikov problem, in which an infinitesimal particle\nmoves on a circle under the gravitational influence of two equal masses in\nKeplerian motion within a plane perpendicular to that circle. There are two\nequilibrium points, whose stability we are studying. We show that one of the\nequilibrium points undergoes stability interchanges as the semi-major axis of\nthe Keplerian ellipses approaches the diameter of that circle. To derive this\nresult, we first formulate and prove a general theorem on stability\ninterchanges, and then we apply it to our model. The motivation for our model\nresides with the $n$-body problem in spaces of constant curvature.\n", "  In this paper, we will study some properties of oscillaton, spherically\nsymmetric object made of a real time-dependent scalar field, Using a self-\ninteraction quartic scalar potential instead of a quadratic or exponential ones\ndiscussed in previous works. Since the oscillatons can be regarded as models\nfor astrophysical objects which play the role of dark matter, there- fore\ninvestigation of their properties has more importance place in present time of\nphysics; research. Therefore we investigate the properties of these objects by\nSolving the system of differential equations obtained from the Einstein Klein\nGordon (EKG) equations and will show their importance as new candidates for the\nrole of dark matter in the galactic scales.\n", "  An important step in the efficient computation of multi-dimensional theta\nfunctions is the construction of appropriate symplectic transformations for a\ngiven Riemann matrix assuring a rapid convergence of the theta series. An\nalgorithm is presented to approximately map the Riemann matrix to the Siegel\nfundamental domain. The shortest vector of the lattice generated by the Riemann\nmatrix is identified exactly, and the algorithm ensures that its length is\nlarger than $\\sqrt{3}/2$. The approach is based on a previous algorithm by\nDeconinck et al. using the LLL algorithm for lattice reductions. Here, the LLL\nalgorithm is replaced by exact Minkowski reductions for small genus and an\nexact identification of the shortest lattice vector for larger values of the\ngenus.\n", "  Geometric analysis of steady pseudo-plane ideal flow reveals a fundamental\nrelation between vertical coherence and streamline topology. It shows vertical\nalignment only exists in straightline jet and circular vortex. A geometric\nstability theory is then developed as a structural stability in contrast to\ntraditional dynamical stability, suggesting all vertical-aligned pseudo-plane\nflows are geometrically stable and all non-aligned non-straightline flows are\nunstable. It provides a topological explanation for the tendency of\naxisymmetrization and vertical alignment observed in vortex experiments.\n", "  Protontherapy is hadrontherapy fastest-growing modality and a pillar in the\nbattle against cancer. Hadrontherapy superiority lies in its inverted\ndepth-dose profile, hence tumour-confined irradiation. Protons, however, lack\ndistinct radiobiological advantages over photons or electrons. Higher LET\n(Linear Energy Transfer) $^{12}$C ions can overcome cancer radioresistance: DNA\nlesion complexity increases with LET, resulting in efficient cell killing, i.e.\nhigher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). However, economic and\nradiobiological issues hamper $^{12}$C-ion clinical amenability. Thus,\nenhancing proton RBE is desirable. To this end, we exploited the p + $^{11}$B\n$\\rightarrow$3$\\alpha$ reaction to generate high-LET alpha particles with a\nclinical proton beam. To maximize the reaction rate, we used sodium borocaptate\n(BSH) with natural boron content. Boron-Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) uses\n$^{10}$B-enriched BSH for neutron irradiation-triggered alpha-particles. We\nrecorded significantly increased cellular lethality and chromosome aberration\ncomplexity. A strategy combining protontherapy ballistic precision with the\nhigher RBE promised by BNCT and $^{12}$C-ion therapy is thus demonstrated.\n", "  We applied the analysis of x-ray intensity angular correlation function to\ndilute ensembles of identical spinel crystals. Firstly, we show that the\nangular correlation from measured diffraction patterns with many crystals per\nshot converges to the correlation for single crystal. Secondly, we determined\nthe diffraction pattern from single crystal from diffraction patterns of many\ncrystals. Finally, we discussed the full 3D reciprocal space retrieval and its\npotential application in solving structure with dilute powder diffraction data,\nwhere the intensity fluctuation could be observed on each ring.\n", "  Synthesis of rationally designed nanostructured materials with optimized\nmechanical properties, e.g., high strength with considerable ductility,\nrequires rigorous control of diverse microstructural parameters including the\nmean size, size dispersion and spatial distribution of grains. However,\ncurrently available synthesis techniques can seldom satisfy these requirements.\nHere, we report a new methodology to synthesize thin films with unprecedented\nmicrostructural control via systematic, in-situ seeding of nanocrystals into\namorphous precursor films. When the amorphous films are subsequently\ncrystallized by thermal annealing, the nanocrystals serve as preferential grain\nnucleation sites and control their microstructure. We demonstrate the\ncapability of this approach by precisely tailoring the size, geometry and\nspatial distribution of nanostructured grains in structural (TiAl) as well as\nfunctional (TiNi) thin films. The approach, which is applicable to a broad\nclass of metallic alloys and ceramics, enables explicit microstructural control\nof thin film materials for a wide spectrum of applications.\n", "  A class of Actively Calibrated Line Mounted Capacitive Voltage Transducers\n(LMCVT) are introduced as a viable line mountable instrumentation option for\ndeploying large numbers of voltage transducers onto the medium and high voltage\nsystems. Active Calibration is shown to reduce the error of line mounted\nvoltage measurements by an order of magnitude from previously published\ntechniques. The instrument physics and sensing method is presented and the\nperformance is evaluated in a laboratory setting. Finally, a roadmap to a fully\ndeployable prototype is shown.\n", "  Autonomous control systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft benefit\nfrom having cognitive capabilities like learning so that they can adapt to\nunexpected situations in-situ. Q-learning is a form of reinforcement learning\nand it has been efficient in solving certain class of learning problems.\nHowever, embedded systems onboard planetary rovers and spacecraft rarely\nimplement learning algorithms due to the constraints faced in the field, like\nprocessing power, chip size, convergence rate and costs due to the need for\nradiation hardening. These challenges present a compelling need for a portable,\nlow-power, area efficient hardware accelerator to make learning algorithms\npractical onboard space hardware. This paper presents a FPGA implementation of\nQ-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This method matches the\nmassive parallelism inherent in neural network software with the fine-grain\nparallelism of an FPGA hardware thereby dramatically reducing processing time.\nMars Science Laboratory currently uses Xilinx-Space-grade Virtex FPGA devices\nfor image processing, pyrotechnic operation control and obstacle avoidance. We\nsimulate and program our architecture on a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA. The\narchitectural implementation for a single neuron Q-learning and a more complex\nMultilayer Perception (MLP) Q-learning accelerator has been demonstrated. The\nresults show up to a 43-fold speed up by Virtex 7 FPGAs compared to a\nconventional Intel i5 2.3 GHz CPU. Finally, we simulate the proposed\narchitecture using the Symphony simulator and compiler from Xilinx, and\nevaluate the performance and power consumption.\n", "  CubeSats and small satellites are emerging as low-cost tools to perform\nastronomy, exoplanet searches and earth observation. These satellites can be\ndedicated to pointing at targets for weeks or months at a time. This is\ntypically not possible on larger missions where usage is shared. Current\nsatellites use reaction wheels and where possible magneto-torquers to control\nattitude. However, these actuators can induce jitter due to various sources. In\nthis work, we introduce a new class of actuators that exploit radiometric\nforces induced by gasses on surface with a thermal gradient. Our work shows\nthat a CubeSat or small spacecraft mounted with radiometric actuators can\nachieve precise pointing of few arc-seconds or less and avoid the jitter\nproblem. The actuator is entirely solid-state, containing no moving mechanical\ncomponents. This ensures high-reliability and long-life in space. A preliminary\ndesign for these actuators is proposed, followed by feasibility analysis of the\nactuator performance.\n", "  Current spacecraft need to launch with all of their required fuel for travel.\nThis limits the system performance, payload capacity, and mission flexibility.\nOne compelling alternative is to perform In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) by\nextracting fuel from small bodies in local space such as asteroids or small\nsatellites. Compared to the Moon or Mars, the microgravity on an asteroid\ndemands a fraction of the energy for digging and accessing hydrated regolith\njust below the surface. Previous asteroid excavation efforts have focused on\ndiscrete capture events (an extension of sampling technology) or whole-asteroid\ncapture and processing. This paper proposes an optimized bucket wheel design\nfor surface excavation of an asteroid or small-body. Asteroid regolith is\nexcavated and water extracted for use as rocket propellant. Our initial study\nfocuses on system design, bucket wheel mechanisms, and capture dynamics applied\nto ponded materials known to exist on asteroids like Itokawa and Eros and small\nsatellites like Phobos and Deimos. For initial evaluation of\nmaterial-spacecraft dynamics and mechanics, we assume lunar-like regolith for\nbulk density, particle size and cohesion. We shall present our estimates for\nthe energy balance of excavation and processing versus fuel gained.\nConventional electrolysis of water is used to produce hydrogen and oxygen. It\nis compared with steam for propulsion and both show significant delta-v. We\nshow that a return trip from Deimos to Earth is possible for a 12 kg craft\nusing ISRU processed fuel.\n", "  Space systems such as communication satellites, earth observation satellites\nand space telescopes require precise pointing to observe fixed targets over\nprolonged time. These systems typically use reaction-wheels to slew the\nspacecraft and gimballing systems containing motors to achieve precise\npointing. Motor based actuators have limited life as they contain moving parts\nthat require lubrication in space. Alternate methods have utilized\npiezoelectric actuators. This paper presents Shape memory alloys (SMA)\nactuators for control of a deployable antenna placed on a satellite. The SMAs\nare operated as a series of distributed linear actuators. These distributed\nlinear actuators are not prone to single point failures and although each\nindividual actuator is imprecise due to hysteresis and temperature variation.\nThe system as a whole achieves reliable results. The SMAs can be programmed to\nperform a series of periodic motion and operate as a mechanical guidance system\nthat is not prone to damage from radiation or space weather. Efforts are\nfocused on developing a system that can achieve one degree pointing accuracy at\nfirst, with an ultimate goal of achieving a few arc seconds accuracy. Bench top\nmodels of the actuator system has been developed and working towards testing\nthe system under vacuum. A demonstration flight of the technology is planned\naboard a CubeSat.\n", "  CubeSats are emerging as low-cost tools to perform astronomy, exoplanet\nsearches and earth observation. These satellites can target an object for\nscience observation for weeks on end. This is typically not possible on larger\nmissions where usage time is shared. The problem of designing an attitude\ncontrol system for CubeSat telescopes is very challenging because current\nchoice of actuators such as reaction-wheels and magnetorquers can induce jitter\non the spacecraft due to moving mechanical parts and due to external\ndisturbances. These telescopes may contain cryo-pumps and servos that introduce\nadditional vibrations. A better solution is required. In our paper, we analyze\nthe feasibility of utilizing solar radiation pressure (SRP) and radiometric\nforce to achieve precise attitude control. Our studies show radiometric\nactuators to be a viable method to achieve precise pointing. The device uses 8\nthin vanes of different temperatures placed in a near-vacuum chamber. These\nchambers contain trace quantities of lightweight, inert gasses like argon. The\ntemperature gradient across the vanes causes the gas molecules to strike the\nvanes differently and thus inducing a force. By controlling these forces, it's\npossible to produce a torque to precisely point or spin a spacecraft. We\npresent a conceptual design of a CubeSat that is equipped with these actuators.\nWe then analyze the potential slew maneuver and slew rates possible with these\nactuators by simulating their performance. Our analytical and simulation\nresults point towards a promising pathway for laboratory testing of this\ntechnology and demonstration of this technology in space.\n", "  Kondo systems ranging from the single Kondo impurity to heavy fermion\nmaterials present us with a plethora of unconventional properties whose\ntheoretical understanding is still one of the major open problems in condensed\nmatter physics. Over the last few years, groundbreaking scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS) experiments have provided unprecedented new insight into the\nelectronic structure of Kondo systems. Interpreting the results of these\nexperiments -- the differential conductance and the quasi-particle interference\nspectrum -- however, has been complicated by the fact that electrons tunneling\nfrom the STS tip into the system can tunnel either into the heavy magnetic\nmoment or the light conduction band states. In this article, we briefly review\nthe theoretical progress made in understanding how quantum interference between\nthese two tunneling paths affects the experimental STS results. We show how\nthis theoretical insight has allowed us to interpret the results of STS\nexperiments on a series of heavy fermion materials providing detailed knowledge\nof their complex electronic structure. It is this knowledge that is a conditio\nsine qua non for developing a deeper understanding of the fascinating\nproperties exhibited by heavy fermion materials, ranging from unconventional\nsuperconductivity to non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the vicinity of quantum\ncritical points.\n", "  We studied in-plane bistable alignments of nematic liquid crystals confined\nby two frustrated surfaces by means of Monte Carlo simulations of the\nLebwohl-Lasher spin model. The surfaces are prepared with orientational\ncheckerboard patterns, on which the director field is locally anchored to be\nplanar yet orthogonal between the neighboring blocks. We found the director\nfield in the bulk tends to be aligned along the diagonal axes of the\ncheckerboard pattern, as reported experimentally [J.-H. Kim et al., Appl. Phys.\nLett. 78, 3055 (2001)]. The energy barrier between the two stable orientations\nis increased, when the system is brought to the isotropic-nematic transition\ntemperature. Based on an elastic theory, we found that the bistability is\nattributed to the spatial modulation of the director field near the frustrated\nsurfaces. As the block size is increased and/or the elastic modulus is reduced,\nthe degree of the director inhomogeneity is increased, enlarging the energy\nbarrier. We also found that the switching rate between the stable states is\ndecreased when the block size is comparable to the cell thickness.\n", "  We study non-Markovian dynamics of a two level atom using pseudomode method.\nBecause of the memory effect of non-Markovian dynamics, the atom receives back\ninformation and excited energy from the reservoir at a later time, which causes\nmore complicated behaviors than Markovian dynamics. With pseudomode method,\nnon-Markovian dynamics of the atom can be mapped into Markovian dynamics of the\natom and pseudomode. We show that by using pseudomode method and quantum jump\napproach for Markovian dynamics, we get a physically intuitive insight into the\nmemory effect of non-Markovian dynamics. It suggests a simple physical meaning\nof the memory time of a non-Markovian reservoir.\n", "  Using dynamic cantilever magnetometry and experimentally determining the\ncantilever's vibrational mode shape, we precisely measured the magnetic moment\nof a lithographically defined micron-sized superconducting Nb ring, a key\nelement for the previously proposed subpiconewton force standard. The magnetic\nmoments due to individual magnetic fluxoids and a diamagnetic response were\nindependently determined at T = 4.3 K, with a subfemtoampere-square-meter\nresolution. The results show good agreement with the theoretical estimation\nyielded by the Brandt and Clem model within the spring constant determination\naccuracy.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the dispersion of capillary waves with\nfinite amplitude, based on direct numerical simulations. The presented results\nshow an increase of viscous attenuation and, consequently, a smaller frequency\nof capillary waves with increasing initial wave amplitude. Interestingly,\nhowever, the critical wavenumber as well as the wavenumber at which the maximum\nfrequency is observed remain the same for a given two-phase system,\nirrespective of the wave amplitude. By devising an empirical correlation that\ndescribes the effect of the wave amplitude on the viscous attenuation, the\ndispersion of capillary waves with finite initial amplitude is shown to be, in\nvery good approximation, self-similar throughout the entire underdamped regime\nand independent of the fluid properties. The results also shown that analytical\nsolutions for capillary waves with infinitesimal amplitude are applicable with\nreasonable accuracy for capillary waves with moderate amplitude.\n", "  We review some of the major progress in the accurate calculation of the cross\nsection for the production of a charged Higgs boson in a generic two-Higgs\ndouble model, by focussing on the high-mass region, for which new calculations\nhave been made available in the past few years, both at the level of total and\nof differential cross sections. Furthermore, we illustrate some recent progress\nin the calculation of the total cross section for a charged Higgs boson with\nmass in the intermediate range m_{H^\\pm} \\sim m_{t}, including top-resonant\ncontributions.\n", "  We consider a relativistic quantum heat engine that goes through a\nthermodynamical cycle consisting of stages involving laser-assisted cooling of\nelectrons and the generation of Xray radiation. Quantum treatment of the\nprocesses makes it possible to obtain the necessary condition and the amount of\nwork extracted from the interaction ingredients, as well as the efficiency of\nthe heat engine. We have also found that the efficiency of the relativistic\nengine is less than the one for the nonrelativistic case for the same momenta.\nThe obtained results set the limits to the cooling, as well as the intensity of\nX-ray radiation, in the quantum regime of the interaction of electrons with\nlaser fields.\n", "  The quasicontinuum (QC) method, originally proposed by Tadmor, Ortiz and\nPhillips in 1996, is a computational technique that can efficiently handle\nregular atomistic lattices by combining continuum and atomistic approaches. In\nthe present work, the QC method is extended to irregular systems of particles\nthat represent a heterogeneous material. The paper introduces five QC-inspired\napproaches that approximate a discrete model consisting of particles connected\nby elastic links with axial interactions. Accuracy is first checked on simple\nexamples in two and three spatial dimensions. Computational efficiency is then\nassessed by performing three-dimensional simulations of an L-shaped specimen\nwith elastic-brittle links. It is shown that the QC-inspired approaches\nsubstantially reduce the computational cost and lead to macroscopic crack\ntrajectories and global load-displacement curves that are very similar to those\nobtained by a fully resolved particle model.\n", "  Oxides with $4d$/$5d$ transition metal ions are physically interesting for\ntheir particular crystalline structures as well as the spin-orbit coupled\nelectronic structures. Recent experiments revealed a series of $4d$/$5d$\ntransition metal oxides $R_3M$O$_7$ ($R$: rare earth; $M$: $4d$/$5d$ transition\nmetal) with unique quasi-one-dimensional $M$ chains. Here first-principles\ncalculations have been performed to study the electronic structures of\nLa$_3$OsO$_7$ and La$_3$RuO$_7$. Our study confirm both of them to be Mott\ninsulating antiferromagnets with identical magnetic order. The reduced magnetic\nmoments, which are much smaller than the expected value for ideal high-spin\nstate ($3$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals occupied), are attributed to the strong $p-d$\nhybridization with oxygen ions, instead of the spin-orbit coupling. The\nCa-doping to La$_3$OsO$_7$ and La$_3$RuO$_7$ can not only modulate the nominal\ncarrier density but also affect the orbital order as well as the local\ndistortions. The Coulombic attraction and particular orbital order would prefer\nto form polarons, which might explain the puzzling insulating behavior of doped\n$5d$ transition metal oxides. In addition, our calculation predict that the\nCa-doping can trigger ferromagnetism in La$_3$RuO$_7$ but not in La$_3$OsO$_7$.\n", "  The dark matter spike induced by the adiabatic growth of a massive black hole\nin a cuspy environment, may explain the thermal dark matter density required to\nfit the cut-off in the HESSJ1745-290 gamma-ray spectra as TeV dark matter\nsignal with a background component. The spike extension appears comparable with\nthe HESS angular resolution.\n", "  Kinetically constrained lattice gases (KCLG) are interacting particle systems\non the integer lattice $\\mathbb Z^d$ with hard core exclusion and\n  Kawasaki type dynamics. Their peculiarity is that jumps are allowed only if\nthe configuration satisfies a constraint which asks for enough empty sites in a\ncertain local neighborhood. KCLG have been introduced and extensively studied\nin physics literature as models of glassy dynamics. We focus on the most\nstudied class of KCLG, the Kob Andersen (KA) models. We analyze the behavior of\na tracer (i.e. a tagged particle) at equilibrium. We prove that for all\ndimensions $d\\geq 2$ and for any equilibrium particle density, under diffusive\nrescaling the motion of the tracer converges to a $d$-dimensional Brownian\nmotion with non-degenerate diffusion matrix. Therefore we disprove the\noccurrence of a diffusive/non diffusive transition which had been conjectured\nin physics literature. Our technique is flexible enough and can be extended to\nanalyse the tracer behavior for other choices of constraints.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, the structural, elastic and electronic\nproperties of MoAlB have been investigated for the first time. The optimized\nlattice constants exhibit fair agreement with the experimental values. The\ncomputed elastic constants satisfy the mechanical stability conditions for the\nMoAlB. The Mo-based boride MoAlB is elastically anisotropic and can be\nclassified as brittle material. This boride is expected to show reasonable\nthermal conductivity due to its high Debye temperature of 693 K. The metallic\nelectrical conductivity of this compound is predicted from the electronic band\nstructure calculations. The chemical bonding in MoAlB is basically covalent in\nnature which is supported by the calculated electronic density of states (DOS),\nMulliken population, and charge density distribution. The estimated hardness\nvalue of 11.6 GPa for MoAlB suggests that it is softer compared to many other\nborides. The Fermi surface is formed due to low dispersive Mo 4d-like bands,\nwhich makes the compound a conductive one.\n", "  We explore a method to extract energy eigenstates, called Athens Model\nIndependent Analysis Scheme (AMIAS), which is an alternative to solving\nstandard Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEVP). The method is based on\nstatistically sampling the space of fit parameters according to the $\\chi^2$\nvalue of the fit function. The method is particularly suited for correlators or\ncorrelation matrices with strong contributions from several energy eigenstates\nand for rather noisy data, e.g. for correlators with disconnected and partly\ndisconnected diagrams. We apply the method to the analysis of the $J^P = 0^+$\nchannel in the context of our investigation of the $a_0(980)$ meson and point\nout advantages compared to the GEVP.\n", "  Coherent Diffractive Imaging is a lensless technique that allows imaging of\nmatter at a spatial resolution not limited by lens aberrations. This technique\nexploits the measured diffraction pattern of a coherent beam scattered by\nperiodic and non-periodic objects to retrieve spatial information. The\ndiffracted intensity, for weak-scattering objects, is proportional to the\nmodulus of the Fourier Transform of the object scattering function. Any phase\ninformation, needed to retrieve its scattering function, has to be retrieved by\nmeans of suitable algorithms. Here we present a new approach, based on a\nmemetic algorithm, i.e. a hybrid genetic algorithm, to face the phase problem,\nwhich exploits the synergy of deterministic and stochastic optimization\nmethods. The new approach has been tested on simulated data and applied to the\nphasing of transmission electron microscopy coherent electron diffraction data\nof a $\\text{SrTiO}_\\text{3}$ sample. We have been able to quantitatively\nretrieve the projected atomic potential, and also image the oxygen columns,\nwhich are not directly visible in the relevant high-resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy images. Our approach proves to be a new powerful tool for\nthe study of matter at atomic resolution and opens new perspectives in those\napplications in which effective phase retrieval is necessary.\n", "  The interaction of escaping upper atmosphere of a hydrogen rich\nnon-magnetized analog of HD209458b with a stellar wind of its host G-type star\nat different orbital distances is simulated with a 2D axisymmetric multi-fluid\nhydrodynamic model. A realistic sun-like spectrum of XUV radiation which\nionizes and heats the planetary atmosphere, hydrogen photo-chemistry, as well\nas stellar-planetary tidal interaction are taken into account to generate\nself-consistently an atmospheric hydrodynamic outflow. Two different regimes of\nthe planetary and stellar winds interaction have been modelled. These are: 1)\nthe \"captured by the star\" regime, when the tidal force and pressure gradient\ndrive the planetary material beyond the Roche lobe towards the star, and 2) the\n\"blown by the wind\" regime, when sufficiently strong stellar wind confines the\nescaping planetary atmosphere and channels it into the tail. The model\nsimulates in details the hydrodynamic interaction between the planetary atoms,\nprotons and the stellar wind, as well as the production of energetic neutral\natoms (ENAs) around the planet due to charge-exchange between planetary atoms\nand stellar protons. The revealed location and shape of the ENA cloud either as\na paraboloid shell between ionopause and bowshock (for the \"blown by the wind\"\nregime), or a turbulent layer at the contact boundary between the planetary\nstream and stellar wind (for the \"captured by the star\" regime) are of\nimportance for the interpretation of Ly{\\alpha} absorption features in\nexoplanetary transit spectra and characterization of the plasma environments.\n", "  The TurLab facility is a laboratory, equipped with a 5 m diameter and 1 m\ndepth rotating tank, located in the Physics Department of the University of\nTurin. The tank has been built mainly to study problems where system rotation\nplays a key role in the fluid behaviour such as in atmospheric and oceanic\nflows at different scales. The tank can be filled with different fluids of\nvariable density, which enables studies in layered conditions such as sea\nwaves. The tank can be also used to simulate the terrestrial surface with the\noptical characteristics of different environments such as snow, grass, ocean,\nland with soil, stones etc., fogs and clouds. As it is located in an extremely\ndark place, the light intensity can be controlled artificially. Such\ncapabilities of the TurLab facility are applied to perform experiments related\nto the observation of Extreme Energy Cosmic Rays (EECRs) from space using the\nfluorescence technique, as in the case of the JEM-EUSO mission, where the\ndiffuse night brightness and artificial light sources can vary significantly in\ntime and space inside the Field of View (FoV) of the telescope. Here we will\nreport the currently ongoing activity at the TurLab facility in the framework\nof the JEM-EUSO mission (EUSO@TurLab).\n", "  This paper describes a novel activity to model the dynamics of a\nJupiter-mass, trans-Neptunian planet of a highly eccentric orbit. Despite a\nhistory rooted in modern astronomy, \"Planet X\", a hypothesised hidden planet\nlurking in our outer Solar System, has often been touted by conspiracy\ntheorists as the cause of past mass extinction events on Earth, as well as\nother modern-day doomsday scenarios. Frequently dismissed as pseudoscience by\nastronomers, these stories continue to draw the attention of the public by\nprovoking mass media coverage. Targeted at junior undergraduate levels, this\nactivity allows students to debunk some of the myths surrounding Planet X by\nusing simulation software to demonstrate that such a large-mass planet with\nextreme eccentricity would be unable to enter our Solar System unnoticed, let\nalone maintain a stable orbit.\n", "  [Co/Ni] multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) have been\nresearched and applied in various spintronic applications. Typically the seed\nlayer material is studied to provide the desired face-centered cubic\n(\\textit{fcc}) texture to the [Co/Ni] to obtain PMA. The integration of [Co/Ni]\nin back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes also requires the PMA to survive\npost-annealing. In this paper, the impact of NiCr, Pt, Ru, and Ta seed layers\non the structural and magnetic properties of [Co(0.3 nm)/Ni(0.6 nm)]\nmultilayers is investigated before and after annealing. The multilayers were\ndeposited \\textit{in-situ} on different seeds via physical vapor deposition at\nroom temperature. The as-deposited [Co/Ni] films show the required\n\\textit{fcc}(111) texture on all seeds, but PMA is only observed on Pt and Ru.\nIn-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) is obtained on NiCr and Ta seeds, which is\nattributed to strain-induced PMA loss. PMA is maintained on all seeds after\npost-annealing up to 400$^{\\circ}$C. The largest effective perpendicular\nanisotropy energy ($K_U^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\approx 2\\times10^5$J/m$^3$) after\nannealing is achieved on NiCr seed. The evolution of PMA upon annealing cannot\nbe explained by further crystallization during annealing or strain-induced PMA,\nnor can the observed magnetization loss and the increased damping after\nannealing. Here we identify the diffusion of the non-magnetic materials from\nthe seed into [Co/Ni] as the major driver of the changes in the magnetic\nproperties. By selecting the seed and post-annealing temperature, the [Co/Ni]\ncan be tuned in a broad range for both PMA and damping.\n", "  We explore the relationship between human migration and OECD's foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) using a gravity equation enriched with variables that account\nfor complex-network effects. Based on a panel data analysis, we find a strong\npositive correlation between the migration network and the FDI network, which\ncan be mostly explained by countries' economic/demographic sizes and\ngeographical distance. We highlight the existence of a stronger positive FDI\nrelationship in pairs of countries that are more central in the migration\nnetwork. Both intensive and extensive forms of centrality are FDI enhancing.\nIlluminating this result, we show that bilateral FDI between any two countries\nis further affected positively by the complex web of \"third party\"\ncorridors/migration stocks of the international migration network (IMN). Our\nfindings are consistent whether we consider bilateral FDI and bilateral\nmigration figures, or we focus on the outward FDI and the respective inward\nmigration of the OECD countries.\n", "  This paper reports the investigations done to adapt the Characteristic\nBoundary Conditions (CBC) to the Lattice-Boltzmann formalism for high Reynolds\nnumber applications. Three CBC formalisms are implemented and tested in an open\nsource LBM code: the baseline local one-dimension inviscid (BL-LODI) approach,\nits extension including the effects of the transverse terms (CBC-2D) and a\nlocal streamline approach in which the problem is reformulated in the incident\nwave framework (LS-LODI). Then all implementations of the CBC methods are\ntested for a variety of test cases, ranging from canonical problems (such as 2D\nplane and spherical waves and 2D vortices) to a 2D NACA profile at high\nReynolds number ($Re = 10^5$), representative of aeronautic applications. The\nLS-LODI approach provides the best results for pure acoustics waves (plane and\nspherical waves). However, it is not well suited to the outflow of a convected\nvortex for which the CBC-2D associated with a relaxation on density and\ntransverse waves provides the best results. As regards numerical stability, a\nregularized adaptation is necessary to simulate high Reynolds number flows. The\nso-called regularized FD (Finite Difference) adaptation, a modified regularized\napproach where the off-equilibrium part of the stress tensor is computed thanks\nto a finite difference scheme, is the only tested adaptation that can handle\nthe high Reynolds computation.\n", "  We formulate a Born rule for families of quantum systems parametrized by a\nnoncommutative space of control parameters. The resulting formalism may be\nviewed as a generalization of quantum mechanics where overlaps take values in a\nnoncommutative algebra, rather than in the complex numbers.\n", "  We study the structure and evolution of the hyperaccreting disks and outflows\nin the gamma ray bursts central engines. The torus around a stellar mass black\nhole is composed of free nucleons, Helium, electron-positron pairs, and is\ncooled by neutrino emission. Accretion of matter powers the relativistic jets,\nresponsible for the gamma ray prompt emission. The significant number density\nof neutrons in the disk and outflowing material will cause subsequent formation\nof heavier nuclei. We study the process of nucleosynthesis and its possible\nobservational consequences. We also apply our scenario to the recent\nobservation of the gravitational wave signal, detected on September 14th, 2015\nby the two Advanced LIGO detectors, and related to an inspiral and merger of a\nbinary black hole system. A gamma ray burst that could possibly be related with\nthe GW150914 event was observed by the Fermi satellite. It had a duration of\nabout 1 second and appeared about 0.4 seconds after the gravitational-wave\nsignal. We propose that a collapsing massive star and a black hole in a close\nbinary could lead to the event. The gamma ray burst was powered by a weak\nneutrino flux produced in the star remnant's matter. Low spin and kick velocity\nof the merged black hole are reproduced in our simulations. Coincident\ngravitational-wave emission originates from the merger of the collapsed core\nand the companion black hole.\n", "  A nice and interesting property of any pure tensor-product state is that each\nsuch state has distillable entangled states at an arbitrarily small distance\n$\\epsilon$ in its neighborhood. We say that such nearby states are\n$\\epsilon$-entangled, and we call the tensor product state in that case, a\n\"boundary separable state\", as there is entanglement at any distance from this\n\"boundary\". Here we find a huge class of separable states that also share that\nproperty mentioned above -- they all have $\\epsilon$-entangled states at any\nsmall distance in their neighborhood. Furthermore, the entanglement they have\nis proven to be distillable. We then extend this result to the\ndiscordant/classical cut and show that all classical states (correlated and\nuncorrelated) have discordant states at distance $\\epsilon$, and provide a\nconstructive method for finding $\\epsilon$-discordant states.\n", "  We present observations of the occulted active region AR12222 during the\nthird {\\em NuSTAR} solar campaign on 2014 December 11, with concurrent {\\em\nSDO/}AIA and {\\em FOXSI-2} sounding rocket observations. The active region\nproduced a medium size solar flare one day before the observations, at\n$\\sim18$UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at the\ntime of {\\em NuSTAR} observations. The time evolution of the source emission in\nthe {\\em SDO/}AIA $335\\textrm{\\AA}$ channel reveals the characteristics of an\nextreme-ultraviolet late phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new\npost-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral\nfitting of {\\em NuSTAR} observations yields an isothermal source, with\ntemperature $3.8-4.6$ MK, emission measure $0.3-1.8 \\times 10^{46}\\textrm{\ncm}^{-3}$, and density estimated at $2.5-6.0 \\times 10^8 \\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$.\nThe observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived {\\em NuSTAR}\ntemperature range, favoring temperature values in the range $4.0-4.3$ MK. By\nexamining the post-flare loops' cooling times and energy content, we estimate\nthat at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled\nbetween the onset of the flare and {\\em NuSTAR} observations, with their total\nthermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at\nflare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the\nflare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead\nto a large underestimation of its value.\n", "  The Fermilab Tevatron collider's data-taking run ended in September 2011,\nyielding a dataset with rich scientific potential. The CDF and D0 experiments\neach have approximately 9 PB of collider and simulated data stored on tape. A\nlarge computing infrastructure consisting of tape storage, disk cache, and\ndistributed grid computing for physics analysis with the Tevatron data is\npresent at Fermilab. The Fermilab Run II data preservation project intends to\nkeep this analysis capability sustained through the year 2020 and beyond. To\nachieve this goal, we have implemented a system that utilizes virtualization,\nautomated validation, and migration to new standards in both software and data\nstorage technology and leverages resources available from currently-running\nexperiments at Fermilab. These efforts have also provided useful lessons in\nensuring long-term data access for numerous experiments, and enable\nhigh-quality scientific output for years to come.\n", "  Modified second order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian was employed to\ndescribe the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic films with three to twenty\nspin layers for the first time. Previously, the solution of second order\nperturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian was found for ferromagnetic films with two to\nfive layers under some assumptions by us. In this report, the exact solution is\npresented without any assumptions by calculating the pseudo inverse of matrix\nC. All eight magnetic parameters such as spin exchange interaction, second\norder magnetic anisotropy, fourth order magnetic anisotropy, stress induced\nmagnetic anisotropy, demagnetization factor, in plane magnetic field, out of\nplane magnetic field and magnetic dipole interaction were taken into account.\nThe easy and hard directions were found using 3-D and 2-D plots of total\nmagnetic energy versus these magnetic parameters. Angle between easy and hard\ndirections was nearly 107 degrees in many cases. The magnetic easy axis\ngradually rotates from out of plane to in plane direction by indicating a\npreferred in plane orientation of magnetic easy axis for films with higher\nnumber of spin layers. These theoretical results agree with some experimental\nresearch data of ferromagnetic thin films.\n", "  After the discovery of the Higgs boson, the primary objective of the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) experiments is to identify new physics beyond the\nStandard Model (SM). One of the most intriguing possibilities would be the\ndiscovery of non-perturbative phenomena in electroweak physics. In fact both\nATLAS and CMS are providing crucial precision tests of the Higgs sector. Most\nstrikingly, there is no conclusive evidence yet on whether the Higgs boson is\nelementary or composite. Lattice simulations can play a key role in advancing\nour theoretical understanding of strongly coupled gauge theories relevant for\nextensions of the SM and the LHC program. In this talk I will review the state\nof beyond the SM (BSM) lattice studies aimed to chart the phase diagram and to\nuncover the properties of strongly coupled gauge theories.\n", "  Wheeled ground robots are limited from exploring extreme environments such as\ncaves, lava tubes and skylights. Small robots that utilize unconventional\nmobility through hopping, flying and rolling can overcome many roughness\nlimitations and thus extend exploration sites of interest on Moon and Mars. In\nthis paper we introduce a network of 3 kg, 0.30 m diameter ball robots\n(pit-bots) that can fly, hop and roll using an onboard miniature propulsion\nsystem. These pit-bots can be deployed from a lander or large rover. Each robot\nis equipped with a smartphone sized computer, stereo camera and laser\nrangefinder to per-form navigation and mapping. The ball robot can carry a\npayload of 1 kg or perform sample return. Our studies show a range of 5 km and\n0.7 hours flight time on the Moon.\n"]}
