This facilitates an exact map from\nthe interacting to the non-interacting system, both with and without a harmonic\ntrap, and explains the short-distance scaling behavior of the wave-function.\nTaking advantage of the phenomenological Calogero-Sutherland-type interaction,\nmotivated by the density functional approach, we connect the ground-state\nenergy shift, to many-body correlation effect. For the excited states, modes at\nintegral values of the harmonic frequency $\\omega$, are predicted in one\ndimension, in contrast to the breathing modes with frequency $2\\omega$ in two\ndimensions.\n", "  We consider methods with which to answer the question \"is any observed galaxy\ncluster too unusual for Lambda-CDM?\" After emphasising that many previous\nattempts to answer this question will overestimate the confidence level at\nwhich Lambda-CDM can be ruled out, we outline a consistent approach to these\nrare clusters, which allows the question to be answered. We define three\nstatistical measures, each of which are sensitive to changes in cluster\npopulations arising from different modifications to the cosmological model. We\nalso use these properties to define the 'equivalent mass at redshift zero' for\na cluster --- the mass of an equally unusual cluster today. This quantity is\nindependent of the observational survey in which the cluster was found, which\nmakes it an ideal proxy for ranking the relative unusualness of clusters\ndetected by different surveys. These methods are then used on a comprehensive\nsample of observed galaxy clusters and we confirm that all are less than\n2-sigma deviations from the Lambda-CDM expectation. Whereas we have only\napplied our method to galaxy clusters, it is applicable to any isolated,\ncollapsed, halo. As motivation for future surveys, we also calculate where in\nthe mass redshift plane the rarest halo is most likely to be found, giving\ninformation as to which objects might be the most fruitful in the search for\nnew physics.\n", "  This paper discusses applications of a particular control technique that can\nbe used to very efficiently stabilize a chaotic system onto a large subset of\nthe unstable periodic orbits that are typically embedded in the system. The\ncontrol method is adapted from one developed by Hayes, Grebogi, and Ott, and\nthe resulting (stabilized) orbits are known as cupolets (Chaotic, Unstable,\nPeriodic, Orbit-LETS). Cupolets exhibit the interesting property that a given\nset of controls will uniquely identify a cupolet, independent of its initial\ncondition. Practical applications of cupolets already include data compression,\nsecure communication, and image processing. We demonstrate how cupolets from\ntwo interacting chaotic systems may be induced into a state of mutual and\nself-sustaining stabilization, in a manner that may be an analog of quantum\nentanglement.\n", "  A typical experiment in high energy physics is considered. The result of the\nexperiment is assumed to be a histogram consisting of bins or channels with\nnumbers of corresponding registered events. The expected background and\nexpected signal shape or acceptance are measured in separate auxiliary\nexperiments, or calculated by the Monte Carlo method with finite sample size,\nand hence with finite precision. An especially complex situation occurs when\nthe expected background in some of the channels happens to be zero due to\neither a fluctuation of the auxiliary measurement (or simulation) or because it\nis truly zero. Different statistical methods give different confidence\nintervals for the full signal rate and different significances of the\nsignal+background hypothesis versus the pure background hypothesis. Detailed\nanalysis and numerical tests are presented.\n", "  In this paper a new form of the Hossz\\'u-Gluskin theorem is presented in\nterms of polyadic powers and using the language of diagrams. It is shown that\nthe Hossz\\'u-Gluskin chain formula is not unique and can be generalized\n(\"deformed\") using a parameter q which takes special integer values. A version\nof the \"q-deformed\" analog of the Hossz\\'u-Gluskin theorem in the form of an\ninvariance is formulated, and some examples are considered. The \"q-deformed\"\nhomomorphism theorem is also given.\n", "  We propose a method of multi-regulator functional renormalization group\n(MR-FRG) which is a novel formulation of functional renormalization group with\nmultiple infrared regulators. It is applied to a two-component fermionic system\nwith an attractive contact interaction to study crossover phenomena between the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)\nphase. To control both the fermionic one-particle excitations and the bosonic\ncollective excitations,IR regulators are introduced, one for the fermionic\ntwo-point function and another for the four-fermion vertex. It is shown that\nthe Nozi\\`eres-Schmitt-Rink (NSR) theory, which is successful to capture\nqualitative features of the BCS-BEC crossover, can be derived from MR-FRG. Some\naspects of MR-FRG to go beyond the NSR theory are also discussed.\n", "  The identification of urban mobility patterns is very important for\npredicting and controlling spatial events. In this study, we analyzed millions\nof geographical check-ins crawled from a leading Chinese location-based social\nnetworking service (Jiepang.com), which contains demographic information that\nfacilitates group-specific studies. We determined the distinct mobility\npatterns of natives and non-natives in all five large cities that we\nconsidered. We used a mixed method to assign different algorithms to natives\nand non-natives, which greatly improved the accuracy of location prediction\ncompared with the basic algorithms. We also propose so-called indigenization\ncoefficients to quantify the extent to which an individual behaves like a\nnative, which depends only on their check-in behavior, rather than requiring\ndemographic information. Surprisingly, the hybrid algorithm weighted using the\nindigenization coefficients outperformed a mixed algorithm that used additional\ndemographic information, suggesting the advantage of behavioral data in\ncharacterizing individual mobility compared with the demographic information.\nThe present location prediction algorithms can find applications in urban\nplanning, traffic forecasting, mobile recommendation, and so on.\n", "  We revisit a fundamental open problem in quantum information theory, namely\nwhether it is possible to transmit quantum information at a rate exceeding the\nchannel capacity if we allow for a non-vanishing probability of decoding error.\nHere we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong\nconverse rate for quantum communication: For any sequence of codes with rate\nexceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity\nvanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This\nremains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing\non the transmitted quantum data. As an application of this result, for\ngeneralized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also\nachievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum\ncommunication over such channels. Thus we conclusively settle the strong\nconverse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial\nquantum capacity.\n", "  The quantum propagator and characteristic equation in the presence of a chain\nof $\\delta$-potentials are obtained in the rectangular, cylindrical and\nspherical coordinate systems. The simplicity and efficiency of the method is\nillustrated via examples. As an application, the characteristic equation of a\nquantum harmonic oscillator confined to an infinite box is obtained. The roots\nof the characteristic equation, determining the energy eigenvalues of the\nrestricted oscillator, are calculated approximately and compared with the\nexisting numerical data.\n", "  The exact form of quantum propagator of a quantum oscillator interacting with\na bosonic bath consisting of $N$ distinguished quantum oscillators with\ndifferent frequencies is obtained in the Heisenberg picture. Reduced density\nmatrix for oscillator is obtained. The kernel or Green's function connecting\nthe initial density matrix of the oscillator to the density matrix in an\narbitrary time is obtained and its connection to Feynman-Vernon influence\nfunctional is discussed. Weak coupling regime and squared mean values for\nposition, momentum and energy of the oscillator are obtained in equilibrium.\n", "  The T2K experiment has provided the first hint for the best-fit value for the\nleptonic CP phase $\\delta_{CP} \\sim -90^\\circ$ from neutrino data. This is now\ncorroborated by the NO$\\nu$A neutrino runs. We study the implications for\nneutrino mass hierarchy and octant of $\\theta_{23}$ in the context of this data\nassuming that the true value of $\\delta_{CP}$ in nature is $-90^\\circ$. Based\non simple arguments on degeneracies in the probabilities we show that a clear\nsignal of $\\delta_{CP}=-90^\\circ$ coming from T2K neutrino (antineutrino) data\nis only possible if the true hierarchy is normal and the true octant is higher\n(lower). Thus if the T2K neutrino and antineutrino data are fitted separately\nand both give the true value of $\\delta_{CP}=-90^\\circ$, this will imply that\nnature has chosen the true hierarchy to be normal and $\\theta_{23} \\approx\n45^\\circ$. However we find that the combined fit of neutrino and antineutrino\ndata will still point to true hierarchy as normal but the octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$ will remain undetermined. We do our analysis for both, the\ncurrent projected exposure ($7.8 \\times 10^{21}$ pot) and planned extended\nexposure ($20 \\times 10^{21}$ pot). We also present the CP discovery potential\nof T2K emphasizing on the role of antineutrinos. We find that one of the main\ncontribution of the antineutrino data is to remove the degenerate solutions\nwith the wrong octant. Thus the antineutrino run plays a more significant role\nfor those hierarchy-octant combinations for which this degeneracy is present.\nIf this degeneracy is absent, then only neutrino run gives a better result for\nfixed $\\theta_{13}$. However if we marginalize over $\\theta_{13}$ then,\nsensitivity corresponding to mixed run can be better than pure neutrino run.\n", "  Glansdorff and Prigogine (1970) proposed a decomposition of the entropy\nproduction rate, which today is mostly known for Markov processes as the\nHatano-Sasa approach. Their context was irreversible thermodynamics which,\nwhile ignoring fluctuations, still allows a somewhat broader treatment than the\none based on the Master or Fokker-Planck equation. Glansdorff and Prigogine\nwere the first to introduce a notion of excess entropy production rate\n$\\delta^2$EP and they suggested as sufficient stability criterion for a\nnonequilibrium macroscopic condition that $\\delta^2$EP be positive. We find for\nnonlinear diffusions that their excess entropy production rate is itself the\ntime-derivative of a local free energy which is the close-to-equilibrium\nfunctional governing macroscopic fluctuations. The positivity of the excess\n$\\delta^2$EP, for which we state a simple sufficient condition, is therefore\nequivalent with the monotonicity in time of that functional in the relaxation\nto steady nonequilibrium. There also appears a relation with recent extensions\nof the Clausius heat theorem close-to-equilibrium. The positivity of\n$\\delta^2$EP immediately implies a Clausius (in)equality for the excess heat. A\nfinal and related question concerns the operational meaning of fluctuation\nfunctionals, nonequilibrium free energies, and how they make their entr\\'ee in\nirreversible thermodynamics.\n", "  We investigate the fluctuation dynamics of a probe around a deterministic\nmotion induced by interactions with driven particles. The latter constitute the\nnonequilibrium medium in which the probe is immersed and is modelled as\noverdamped Langevin particle dynamics driven by nonconservative forces. The\nexpansion that yields the friction and noise expressions for the reduced probe\ndynamics is based on linear response around a time dependent nonequilibrium\ncondition of the medium. The result contains an extension of the second\nfluctuation dissipation relation between friction and noise for probe motion in\na nonequilibrium fluid\n", "  For the simulation of equilibrium states and finite-temperature response\nfunctions of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems, we compare the\nefficiencies of two different approaches in the framework of the density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG). The first is based on matrix product\npurifications. The second, more recent one, is based on so-called minimally\nentangled typical thermal states (METTS). For the latter, we highlight the\ninterplay of statistical and DMRG truncation errors, discuss the use of\nself-averaging effects, and describe schemes for the computation of response\nfunctions. For critical as well as gapped phases of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and\nthe one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, we assess the computation costs and\naccuracies of the two methods at different temperatures. For almost all\nconsidered cases, we find that, for the same computation cost, purifications\nyield more accurate results than METTS -- often by orders of magnitude. The\nMETTS algorithm becomes more efficient only for temperatures well below the\nsystem's energy gap. The exponential growth of the computation cost in the\nevaluation of response functions limits the attainable timescales in both\nmethods and we find that in this regard, METTS do not outperform purifications.\n", "  We consider the critical behaviors and phase transitions of Gauss Bonnet-Born\nInfeld-AdS black holes (GB-BI-AdS) for $d=5,6$ and the extended phase space. We\nassume the cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, the coupling coefficient $\\alpha$,\nand the BI parameter $\\beta$ to be thermodynamic pressures of the system.\nHaving made these assumptions, the critical behaviors are then studied in the\ntwo canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We find \"reentrant and triple\npoint phase transitions\" (RPT-TP) and \"multiple reentrant phase transitions\"\n(multiple RPT) with increasing pressure of the system for specific values of\nthe coupling coefficient $\\alpha$ in the canonical ensemble. Also, we observe a\nreentrant phase transition (RPT) of GB-BI-AdS black holes in the grand\ncanonical ensemble and for $d=6$. These calculations are then expanded to the\ncritical behavior of Born-Infeld-AdS (BI-AdS) black holes in the third order of\nLovelock gravity and in the grand canonical ensemble to find a Van der Waals\nbehavior for $d=7$ and a reentrant phase transition for $d=8$ for specific\nvalues of potential $\\phi$ in the grand canonical ensemble. Furthermore, we\nobtain a similar behavior for the limit of $\\beta \\to \\infty$, i.e charged-AdS\nblack holes in the third order of the Lovelock gravity. Thus, it is shown that\nthe critical behaviors of these black holes are independent of the parameter\n$\\beta$ in the grand canonical ensemble.\n", "  We compute the 't Hooft coupling correction to the infinite coupling\nexpression for the second order transport coefficient $\\lambda_2$ in ${\\cal\nN}=4$ $SU(N_c)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature in the\nlimit of infinite $N_c$, which originates from the $R^4$ terms in the low\nenergy effective action of the dual type IIB string theory. Using this result,\nwe show that the identity involving the three second order transport\ncoefficients, $2 \\eta \\tau_\\Pi - 4 \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 =0$, previously shown\nby Haack and Yarom to hold universally in relativistic conformal field theories\nwith string dual descriptions to leading order in supergravity approximation,\nholds also at next to leading order in this theory. We also compute corrections\nto transport coefficients in a (hypothetical) strongly interacting conformal\nfluid arising from the generic curvature squared terms in the corresponding\ndual gravity action (in particular, Gauss-Bonnet action), and show that the\nidentity holds to linear order in the higher-derivative couplings. We discuss\npotential implications of these results for the near-equilibrium entropy\nproduction rate at strong coupling.\n", "  A unitary 2-design can be viewed as a quantum analogue of a 2-universal hash\nfunction: it is indistinguishable from a truly random unitary by any procedure\nthat queries it twice. We show that exact unitary 2-designs on n qubits can be\nimplemented by quantum circuits consisting of ~O(n) elementary gates in\nlogarithmic depth. This is essentially a quadratic improvement in size (and in\nwidth times depth) over all previous implementations that are exact or\napproximate (for sufficiently strong approximations).\n", "  Online social networks have transformed the way in which humans communicate\nand interact, leading to a new information ecosystem where people send and\nreceive information through multiple channels, including traditional\ncommunication media. Despite many attempts to characterize the structure and\ndynamics of these techno-social systems, little is known about fundamental\naspects such as how collective attention arises and what determines the\ninformation life-cycle. Current approaches to these problems either focus on\nhuman temporal dynamics or on semiotic dynamics. In addition, as recently\nshown, information ecosystems are highly competitive, with humans and memes\nstriving for scarce resources -visibility and attention, respectively. Inspired\nby similar problems in ecology, here we develop a methodology that allows to\ncast all the previous aspects into a compact framework and to characterize,\nusing microblogging data, information-driven systems as mutualistic networks.\nOur results show that collective attention around a topic is reached when the\nuser-meme network self-adapts from a modular to a nested structure, which\nultimately allows minimizing competition and attaining consensus. Beyond a\nsociological interpretation, we explore such resemblance to natural mutualistic\ncommunities via well-known dynamics of ecological systems.\n", "  We present a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment aimed to scan the\nevolution of a spin system, in liquid crystals, during the transient to a\nquasi-equilibrium state. New evidence is presented in favor of irreversible\ndecoherence as the mechanism which leads an initial out-of-equilibrium state to\nquasi-equilibrium. The experiment combines the Jeener-Broekaert sequence with\nreversal of the dipolar evolution, and decoding of multiple quantum coherences,\nto allow visualizing the evolution of the spectra of the different coherences\nduring the formation of the quasi-equilibrium states. We vary the reversion\nstrategies and the preparation of initial states, and observe that the\namplitude of the spectra attenuate with the reversion time, and notably, that\nthe decay is frequency selective in all the samples. We interpret this effect\nas an evidence of 'eigen-selection', a signature of the occurrence of\nirreversible decoherence, which indicates that the spin system in liquid\ncrystal NMR experiments conforms an actual open quantum system, where\nquasi-equilibrium can be rigorously described as a stage of the dynamics which\ndevelops in a time-scale far earlier than thermal equilibrium. This explanation\nis supported by a derivation of the observed signals and spectra in terms of\nthe coherences of the spin-system of a single molecule, within the theoretical\nframework of open quantum systems.\n", "  We study the maximally supersymmetric BFSS model at finite temperature and\nits bosonic relative. For the bosonic model in $p+1$ dimensions, we find that\nit effectively reduces to a system of gauged Gaussian matrix models. The\neffective model captures the low temperature regime of the model including one\nof its two phase transitions. The mass becomes $p^{1/3}\\lambda^{1/3}$ for large\n$p$, with $\\lambda$ the 'tHooft coupling. Simulations of the bosonic-BFSS model\nwith $p=9$ give $m=(1.965\\pm .007)\\lambda^{1/3}$, which is also the mass gap of\nthe Hamiltonian. We argue that there is no `sign' problem in the maximally\nsupersymmetric BFSS model and perform detailed simulations of several\nobservables finding excellent agreement with AdS/CFT predictions when\n$1/\\alpha'$ corrections are included.\n", "  We have initiated the High-Altitude Ballooning programme at Indian Institute\nof Astrophysics, Bangalore, in the year 2011 with the primary purpose of\ndeveloping and flying low-cost scientific payloads on a balloon-borne platform.\nThe main aim is the observations of extended nearby objects (e.g. comets) and\nof diffuse sources (e.g. zodiacal light or airglow) with wide field of view\n(FOV) UV instruments from near space (20 to 30 km). A brief summary and the\nresults of the tethered flights carried out at IIA CREST campus are given in\nRef.~1. Here we present an overview of the nine free-flying balloon experiments\nconducted from March 2013 to November 2014. We describe the launch procedures,\npayloads, methods of tracking and recovery. Since we fall in the light balloon\ncategory --- payload weight is limited to less than 6 kg --- we use the 3-D\nprinter to fabricate lightweight boxes and structures for our experiments. We\ndiscuss the flight and scientific data obtained from different launches and the\ndevelopment of the in-house lightweight sensors and controllers, as well as a\nfully-fledged 2-axis pointing and stabilization system, for the flights.\n", "  We involve simultaneously the theory of matched pairs of groups and the\ntheory of braces to study set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation\n(YBE). We show the intimate relation between the notions of a symmetric group\n(a braided involutive group) and a left brace, and find new results on\nsymmetric groups of finite multipermutation level and the corresponding braces.\nWe introduce a new invariant of a symmetric group $(G,r)$, \\emph{the derived\nchain of ideals of} $G$, which gives a precise information about the recursive\nprocess of retraction of $G$. We prove that every symmetric group $(G,r)$ of\nfinite multipermutation level $m$ is a solvable group of solvable length at\nmost $m$. To each set-theoretic solution $(X,r)$ of YBE we associate two\ninvariant sequences of symmetric groups: (i) the sequence of its derived\nsymmetric groups; (ii) the sequence of its derived permutation groups and\nexplore these for explicit descriptions of the recursive process of retraction.\nWe find new criteria necessary and sufficient to claim that $(X, r)$ is a\nmultipermutation solution.\n", "  We present two deterministic schemes for constructing a CNOT gate and a\nToffoli gate on photon-atom and photon-atom-atom hybrid quantum systems\nassisted by bad cavities, respectively. They are achieved by cavity-assisted\nphoton scattering and work in the intermediate coupling region with bad\ncavities, which relaxes the difficulty of their implementation in experiment.\nAlso, bad cavities are feasible for fast quantum operations and reading out\ninformation. Compared with previous works, our schemes do not need any\nauxiliary qubits and measurements. Moreover, the schematic setups for these\ngates are simple, especially that for our Toffoli gate as only a quarter wave\npacket is used to interact the photon with each of the atoms every time. These\natom-cavity systems can be used as the quantum nodes in long-distance quantum\ncommunication as their relatively long coherence time is suitable for\nmulti-time operations between the photon and the system. Our calculations show\nthat the average fidelities and efficiencies of our two universal hybrid\nquantum gates are high with current experimental technology.\n", "  We study the possible difference between the quantum and the private\ncapacities of a quantum channel in the zero-error setting. For a family of\nchannels introduced by arXiv:1312.4989, we demonstrate an extreme difference:\nthe zero-error quantum capacity is zero, whereas the zero-error private\ncapacity is maximum given the quantum output dimension.\n", "  We report on a computational parameter space study of mixing protocols for a\nhalf-full bi-axial spherical granular tumbler. The quality of mixing is\nquantified via the intensity of segregation (concentration variance) and\ncomputed as a function of three system parameters: angles of rotation about\neach tumbler axis and the flowing layer depth. Only the symmetric case is\nconsidered in which the flowing layer depth is the same for each rotation. We\nalso consider the dependence on $\\bar{R}$, which parametrizes the concentric\nspheroids (\"shells\") that comprise the volume of the tumbler. The intensity of\nsegregation is computed over 100 periods of the mixing protocol for each choice\nof parameters. Each curve is classified via a time constant, $\\tau$, and an\nasymptotic mixing value, $bias$. We find that most choices of angles and most\nshells throughout the tumbler volume mix well, with mixing near the center of\nthe tumbler being consistently faster (small $\\tau$) and more complete (small\n$bias$). We conclude with examples and discussion of the pathological mixing\nbehaviors of the outliers in the so-called $\\tau$-$bias$ scatterplots.\n", "  This paper sets out to establish a comparative study between classes of spin-\nand velocity-dependent potentials for spin-1/2 and spin-1 matter\ncurrents/sources in the non-relativistic regime. Both (neutral massive) scalar\nand vector particles are considered to mediate the interactions between\n(pseudo-)scalar sources or (pseudo-)vector currents. Though our discussion is\nmore general, we contemplate specific cases in which our results may describe\nthe electromagnetic interaction with a massive (Proca-type) photon exchanged\nbetween two spin-1/2 or two spin-1 carriers. We highlight the similarities and\npeculiarities of the potentials for the two different types of charged matter\nand also focus our attention on the comparison between the particular aspects\nof two different field representations for spin-1 matter particles. We believe\nthat our results may contribute to a further discussion of the relation between\ncharge, spin and extensibility of elementary particles.\n", "  We present an efficient proposal for error-rejecting quantum computing with\nquantum dots (QD) embedded in single-sided optical microcavities based on the\ninterface between the circularly polarized photon and QDs. An almost unity\nfidelity of the quantum entangling gate (EG) can be implemented with a\ndetectable error that leads to a recycling EG procedure, which improves further\nthe efficiency of our proposal along with the robustness to the errors involved\nin imperfect input-output processes. Meanwhile, we discuss the performance of\nour proposal for the EG on two solid-state spins with currently achieved\nexperiment parameters, showing that it is feasible with current experimental\ntechnology. It provides a promising building block for solid-state quantum\ncomputing and quantum networks.\n", "  Undulatory locomotion is ubiquitous in nature and observed in different\nmedia, from the swimming of flagellated microorganisms in biological fluids, to\nthe slithering of snakes on land, or the locomotion of sandfish lizards in\nsand. Despite the similarity in the undulating pattern, the swimming\ncharacteristics depend on the rheological properties of different media.\nAnalysis of locomotion in granular materials is relatively less developed\ncompared with fluids partially due to a lack of validated force models but\nrecently a resistive force theory in granular media has been proposed and shown\nuseful in studying the locomotion of a sand-swimming lizard. Here we employ the\nproposed model to investigate the swimming characteristics of a slender\nfilament, of both finite and infinite length, undulating in a granular medium\nand compare the results with swimming in viscous fluids. In particular, we\ncharacterize the effects of drifting and pitching in terms of propulsion speed\nand efficiency for a finite sinusoidal swimmer. We also find that, similar to\nLighthill's results using resistive force theory in viscous fluids, the\nsawtooth swimmer is the optimal waveform for propulsion speed at a given power\nconsumption in granular media. The results complement our understanding of\nundulatory locomotion and provide insights into the effective design of\nlocomotive systems in granular media.\n", "  We perform computer simulations of the Berkooz-Douglas (BD) matrix model,\nholographically dual to the D0/D4-brane intersection. We generate the\nfundamental condensate versus bare mass curve of the theory both\nholographically and from simulations of the BD model. Our studies show\nexcellent agreement of the two approaches in the deconfined phase of the theory\nand significant deviations in the confined phase. We argue the discrepancy in\nthe confined phase is explained by the embedding of the D4-brane which yields\nstronger $\\alpha'$ corrections to the condensate in this phase.\n", "  We formulate an irreversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the\nself-avoiding walk (SAW), which violates the detailed balance condition and\nsatisfies the balance condition. Its performance improves significantly\ncompared to that of the Berretti-Sokal algorithm, which is a variant of the\nMetropolis-Hastings method. The gained efficiency increases with the spatial\ndimension (D), from approximately $10$ times in 2D to approximately $40$ times\nin 5D. We simulate the SAW on a 5D hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions, for a system with a linear size up to $L=128$, and confirm that as\nfor the 5D Ising model, the finite-size scaling of the SAW is governed by\nrenormalized exponents $\\nu^*=2/d$ and $\\gamma/\\nu^*=d/2$. The critical point\nis determined, which is approximately $8$ times more precise than the best\navailable estimate.\n", "  We reconstruct the geometrical $f(T)$ actions in the framework of unimodular\n$f(T)$ gravity. The unimodular $f(T)$ gravity yields stunning properties\nrelated to the generalized Friedmann equations. Indeed, it has been found that\ndepending on the form of the Friedmann equations, the Lagrange multipliers may\nor not depend on the time parameter $\\tau$. Moreover we find that the\nreconstruction of $f(T)$ functions can be easily performed in general, not\ndepending on a given scale factor, or can determine a particular way, depending\non a given scale factor, in the vacuum. It is noted that the reconstruction of\na general action joins is consistent to the unimodular gravity for the constant\n$\\Lambda$\n", "  We explore the evolution of stellar mass black hole binaries (BHBs) which are\nformed in the self-gravitating disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Hardening\ndue to three-body scattering and gaseous drag are effective mechanisms that\nreduce the semi-major axis of a BHB to radii where gravitational waves take\nover, on timescales shorter than the typical lifetime of the AGN disk. Taking\nobservationally-motivated assumptions for the rate of star formation in AGN\ndisks, we find a rate of disk-induced BHB mergers ($\\mathcal{R} \\sim 3~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}~{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}$, but with large uncertainties) that is comparable with\nexisting estimates of the field rate of BHB mergers, and the approximate BHB\nmerger rate implied by the recent Advanced LIGO detection of GW150914. BHBs\nformed thorough this channel will frequently be associated with luminous AGN,\nwhich are relatively rare within the sky error regions of future gravitational\nwave detector arrays. This channel could also possess a (potentially transient)\nelectromagnetic counterpart due to super-Eddington accretion onto the stellar\nmass black hole following the merger.\n", "  We propose a method for recovering the structure of a sparse undirected\ngraphical model when very few samples are available. The method decides about\nthe presence or absence of bonds between pairs of variable by considering one\npair at a time and using a closed form formula, analytically derived by\ncalculating the posterior probability for every possible model explaining a two\nbody system using Jeffreys prior. The approach does not rely on the\noptimisation of any cost functions and consequently is much faster than\nexisting algorithms. Despite this time and computational advantage, numerical\nresults show that for several sparse topologies the algorithm is comparable to\nthe best existing algorithms, and is more accurate in the presence of hidden\nvariables. We apply this approach to the analysis of US stock market data and\nto neural data, in order to show its efficiency in recovering robust\nstatistical dependencies in real data with non stationary correlations in time\nand space.\n", "  Here we report a robust thermal anemometer which can be easily built. It was\nconceived to measure outdoor wind speeds, and for airspeed monitoring in wind\ntunnels and other indoor uses. It works at a constant, low temperature of\napproximately 90$^\\circ$C, so that an independent measurement of the air\ntemperature is required to give a correct speed reading. Despite the size and\nhigh thermal inertia of the probe, the test results show that this anemometer\nis capable of measuring turbulent fluctuations up to ~100 Hz in winds of ~14\nm/s, which corresponds to a scale similar to the length of the probe.\n", "  We study an optomechanical system consisting of an optical cavity and movable\nmirror coupled through dispersive linear optomechanical coupling (LOC) and\nquadratic optomechanical coupling(QOC). We work in the resolved side band limit\nwith a high quality factor mechanical oscillator in a strong coupling regime.\nWe show that the presence of QOC in the conventional optomechanical system\n(with LOC alone) modifies the mechanical oscillator's frequency and reduces the\nback-action effects on mechanical oscillator. As a result of this the\nfluctuations in mechanical oscillator can be suppressed below standard quantum\nlimit thereby squeeze the mechanical motion of resonator. We also show that\neither of the quadratures can be squeezed depending on the sign of the QOC.\nWith detailed numerical calculations and analytical approximation we show that\nin such systems, the 3 dB limit can be beaten.\n", "  We consider cosmological dynamics of nonminimally coupled scalar field in the\nscalar-torsion gravity in the presence of a hydrodynamical matter. Potential of\nthe scalar field have been chosen as power-law with negative index, this type\nof potentials is usually used in quintessence scenarios. We identify several\nasymptotic regimes, including de Sitter, kinetic dominance, kinetic tracker and\ntracker solution and study conditions for their existence and stability. We\nshow that for each combination of coupling constant and potential power index\none of regimes studied in the present paper is stable to the future.\n", "  It is recognised now that a variety of real-life phenomena ranging from\ndiffuson of cold atoms to motion of humans exhibit dispersal faster than normal\ndiffusion. L\\'evy walks is a model that excelled in describing such\nsuperdiffusive behaviors albeit in one dimension. Here we show that, in\ncontrast to standard random walks, the microscopic geometry of planar\nsuperdiffusive L\\'evy walks is imprinted in the asymptotic distribution of the\nwalkers. The geometry of the underlying walk can be inferred from trajectories\nof the walkers by calculating the analogue of the Pearson coefficient.\n", "  A general study of relations between the parameters of two\ncentrally-symmetric Levy distributions, often used for one-dimensional\ninvestigation of Bose - Einstein correlations, is given for the first time.\nThese relations of the strength of correlations and of the radius of the\nemission region take into account possible various finite ranges of the Lorentz\ninvariant four-momentum difference for two centrally-symmetric Levy\ndistributions. In particular, special cases of the relations are investigated\nfor Cauchy and normal (Gaussian) distributions. The mathematical formalism is\nverified using the recent measurements given a generalized centrally-symmetric\nLevy distribution is used. The reasonable agreement is observed between\nestimations and experimental results for all available types of strong\ninteraction processes and collision energies.\n", "  Based on the recently updated Isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck\n(IBUU) transport model, we studied the effects of symmetry energy on the\nneutron to proton n/p ratio and the $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio in central\n$^{132}\\rm {Sn}+^{124}\\rm {Sn}$ reaction at 300 MeV/nucleon. It is found that\nthe n/p ratio and the $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio in central $^{132}\\rm\n{Sn}+^{124}\\rm {Sn}$ reaction at 300 MeV/nucleon mainly probe the symmetry\nenergy in the density region 1-1.5 times saturation density. However, the\n$\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio may be able to probe the density-dependent symmetry\nenergy above 1.5 times saturation density by making some kinematic restrictions\nsuch as the azimuthal angle and kinetic energy cuts of emitting pions.\n", "  An exact, plane wave solution of the gravitational field equations is\ninvestigated. The source stress tensor is represented by an anisotropic null\nfluid with energy flux to which the energy density $\\rho$ and all pressures are\nfinite throughout the spacetime. They depend on a constant length (taken of the\norder of the Planck length) and acquire Planck values close to the null surface\n$t - z = 0$, the $z$-axis being the direction of propagation. The timelike\ngeodesics of a test particle are contained in a plane whose normal has constant\ndirection and the null trajectories are comoving with a plane of fixed\ndirection.\n", "  Usually, the reflection probability $R(E)$ of a particle of zero energy\nincident on a potential which converges to zero asymptotically is found to be\n1: $R(0)=1$. But earlier, a paradoxical phenomenon of zero reflection at zero\nenergy ($R(0)=0$) has been revealed as a threshold anomaly. Extending the\nconcept of Half Bound State (HBS) of 3D, here we show that in 1D when a\nsymmetric (asymmetric) attractive potential well possesses a zero-energy HBS,\n$R(0)=0$ $(R(0)<<1)$. This can happen only at some critical values $q_c$ of an\neffective parameter $q$ of the potential well in the limit $E \\rightarrow 0^+$.\nWe demonstrate this critical phenomenon in two simple analytically solvable\nmodels which are square and exponential wells. However, in numerical\ncalculations even for these two models $R(0)=0$ is observed only as\nextrapolation to zero energy from low energies, close to a precise critical\nvalue $q_c$. By numerical investigation of a variety of potential wells, we\nconclude that for a given potential well (symmetric or asymmetric), we can\nadjust the effective parameter $q$ to have a low reflection at a low energy.\n", "  In the light of contemporary discussions of inter and transdisciplinarity,\nthis paper approaches econophysics and sociophysics to seek a response to the\nquestion -- whether these interdisciplinary fields could contribute to physics\nand economics. Drawing upon the literature on history and philosophy of\nscience, the paper argues that the two way traffic between physics and\neconomics has a long history and this is likely to continue in the future.\n", "  We study the star formation process at galactic scales and the role of\nrotation through numerical simulations of spiral and starburst galaxies using\nthe adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo. We focus on the study of three\nintegrated star formation laws found in the literature: the Kennicutt-Schmidt\n(KS) and Silk-Elmegreen (SE) laws, and the dimensionally homogeneous equation\nproposed by Escala (2015) $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} \\propto \\sqrt{G/L}\\Sigma_{\\rm\ngas}^{1.5}$. We show that using the last we take into account the effects of\nthe integration along the line of sight and find a unique regime of star\nformation for both types of galaxies, suppressing the observed bi-modality of\nthe KS law. We find that the efficiencies displayed by our simulations are\nanti-correlated with the angular velocity of the disk $\\Omega$ for the three\nlaws studied in this work. Finally, we show that the dimensionless efficiency\nof star formation is well represented by an exponentially decreasing function\nof $-1.9\\Omega t_{\\rm ff}^{\\rm ini}$, where $t_{\\rm ff}^{\\rm ini}$ is the\ninitial free-fall time. This leads to a unique galactic star formation relation\nwhich reduces the scatter of the bi-modal KS, SE, and Escala (2015) relations\nby 43%, 43%, and 35% respectively.\n", "  Using three-dimensional simulations, we study the dynamics and final\nstructure of merging solitonic cores predicted to form in ultra-light axion\ndark matter halos. The classical, Newtonian equations of motion of a\nself-gravitating scalar field are described by the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson\nequations. We investigate mergers of ground state (boson star) configurations\nwith varying mass ratios, relative phases, orbital angular momenta and initial\nseparation with the primary goal to understand the mass loss of the emerging\ncore by gravitational cooling. Previous results showing that the final density\nprofiles have solitonic cores and NFW-like tails are confirmed. In binary\nmergers, the final core mass does not depend on initial phase difference or\nangular momentum and only depends on mass ratio, total initial mass, and total\nenergy of the system. For non-zero angular momenta, the otherwise spherical\ncores become rotating ellipsoids. The results for mergers of multiple cores are\nqualitatively identical.\n", "  The extension of the Standard Model by heavy right-handed neutrinos can\nsimultaneously explain the observed neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism\nand the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. If the mass of the\nheavy neutrinos is below the electroweak scale, they may be found at LHCb,\nBELLE II, the proposed SHiP experiment or a future high-energy collider. In\nthis mass range, the baryon asymmetry is generated via $CP$-violating\noscillations of the heavy neutrinos during their production. We study the\ngeneration of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in this scenario from first\nprinciples of non-equilibrium quantum field theory, including spectator\nprocesses and feedback effects. We eliminate several uncertainties from\nprevious calculations and find that the baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be\nexplained with larger heavy neutrino mixing angles, increasing the chance for\nan experimental discovery. For the limiting cases of fast and strongly\noverdamped oscillations of right-handed neutrinos, the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry can be calculated analytically up to corrections of order one.\n", "  To understand the finite-size-scaling properties of phases transitions in\nclassical and quantum models in the presence of quenched disorder, it has\nproven to be fruitful to introduce the notion of a finite-size-pseudo-critical\npoint in each disordered sample and to analyze its sample-to-sample\nfluctuations as a function of the size. For the Many-Body-Localization\ntransition, where very strong eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations have been\nnumerically reported even within a given disordered sample at a given energy\ndensity [X. Yu, D. J. Luitz, B. K. Clark, arxiv:1606.01260 and V. Khemani, S.\nP. Lim, D. N. Sheng, D. A. Huse,arxiv:1607.05756], it seems thus useful to\nintroduce the notion of a finite-size-pseudo-critical point for each individual\neigenstate and to study its eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations governed by\nthe correlation length exponent $\\nu$. The scaling properties of critical\neigenstates are also expected to appear much more clearly if one considers each\neigenstate at its finite-size-pseudo-critical point, where it is 'truly\ncritical', while standard averages over eigenstates and samples in the critical\nregion actually see a mixture of states that are effectively either localized\nor delocalized.\n", "  We study universal bosonic few-body systems within the framework of effective\nfield theory at leading order (LO). We calculate binding energies of systems of\nup to six particles and the atom-dimer scattering length. Convergence to the\nlimit of zero-range two- and three-body interactions is shown, indicating that\nno additional few-body interactions need to be introduced at LO.\nGeneralizations of the Tjon line are constructed, showing correlations between\nfew-body binding energies and the binding energy of the trimer, for a given\ndimer energy. As a specific example, we implement our theory for 4He atomic\nsystems, and show that the results are in surprisingly good agreement with\nthose of sophisticated 4He-4He potentials. Potential implications for the\nconvergence of the EFT expansion are discussed.\n", "  We study the Anti-Unruh effect in general stationary scenarios. We find that,\nfor accelerated trajectories, a particle detector coupled to a KMS state of a\nquantum field can cool down (click less often) as the KMS temperature\nincreases. Remarkably, this is so even when the detector is switched on\nadiabatically for infinitely long times. We also show that the Anti-Unruh\neffect is characteristic of accelerated detectors, and cannot appear for\ninertially moving detectors (e.g., in a thermal bath).\n", "  In a previous paper we introduced and developed a recursive construction of\njoint eigenfunctions $J_N(a_+,a_-,b;x,y)$ for the Hamiltonians of the\nhyperbolic relativistic Calogero-Moser system with arbitrary particle number\n$N$. In this paper we focus on the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$, and establish a\nnumber of conjectured features of the corresponding joint eigenfunctions. More\nspecifically, choosing $a_+,a_-$ positive, we prove that $J_2(b;x,y)$ and\n$J_3(b;x,y)$ extend to globally meromorphic functions that satisfy various\ninvariance properties as well as a duality relation. We also obtain detailed\ninformation on the asymptotic behavior of similarity transformed functions\nE$_2(b;x,y)$ and E$_3(b;x,y)$. In particular, we determine the dominant\nasymptotics for $y_1-y_2\\to\\infty$ and $y_1-y_2,y_2-y_3\\to\\infty$, resp., from\nwhich the conjectured factorized scattering can be read off.\n", "  We investigate the measurement-only topological quantum computation (MOTQC)\napproach proposed by Bonderson et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 010501 (2008)]\nwhere the braiding operation is shown to be equivalent to a series of\ntopological charge \"forced measurements\" of anyons. In a forced measurement,\nthe charge measurement is forced to yield the desired outcome (e.g. charge 0)\nvia repeatedly measuring charges in different bases. This is a probabilistical\nprocess with a certain success probability for each trial. In practice, the\nnumber of measurements needed will vary from run to run. We show that such an\nuncertainty associated with forced measurements can be removed by simulating\nthe braiding operation using a fixed number of three measurements supplemented\nby a correction operator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in practice we can\navoid applying the correction operator in hardware by implementing it in\nsoftware. Our findings greatly simplify the MOTQC proposal and only require the\ncapability of performing charge measurements to implement topologically\nprotected transformations generated by braiding exchanges without physically\nmoving anyons.\n", "  To explore whether a flat-band system can accommodate superconductivity, we\nconsider repulsively interacting fermions on the diamond chain, a simplest\nquasi-one-dimensional system that contains a flat band. Exact diagonalization\nand the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) are used to show that we\nhave a significant binding energy of a Cooper pair with a long-tailed pair-pair\ncorrelation in real space when the total band filling is slightly below $1/3$,\nwhere the dispersive band interacts with the flat band that is empty but close\nto $E_F$. Pairs selectively formed across the outer sites of the diamond chain\nare responsible for the pairing correlation. At exactly $1/3$-filling an\ninsulating phase emerges, where the entanglement spectrum indicates the\nparticles on the outer sites are highly entangled and topological. These come\nfrom a peculiarity of the flat band in which \"Wannier orbits\" are not\northogonalizable.\n", "  This paper concerns constructing topological sigma models governing maps from\nsemirigid super Riemann surfaces to general target supermanifolds. We define\nboth the A model and B model in this general setup by defining suitable BRST\noperators and physical observables. Using supersymmetric localization, we\nexpress correlation functions in these theories as integrals over suitable\nsupermanifolds. In the case of the A model, we obtain an integral over the\nsupermoduli space of \"superinstantons\". The language of supergeometry is used\nextensively throughout this paper.\n", "  We study cosmological structure formation with ultralight axion dark matter,\nor \"fuzzy dark matter (FDM), using a particle-mesh scheme to account for the\nquantum pressure arising in the Madelung formulation of the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations. Subpercent-level energy conservation and\ncorrect linear behavior are demonstrated. Whereas the code gives rise to the\nsame core-halo profiles as direct simulations of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, it\ndoes not reproduce the detailed interference patterns. In cosmological\nsimulations with FDM initial conditions, we find a maximum relative difference\nof O($10\\%$) in the power spectrum near the quantum Jeans length compared to\nusing a standard N-body code with identical initial conditions. This shows that\nthe effect of quantum pressure during nonlinear structure formation cannot be\nneglected for precision constraints on a dark matter component consisting of\nultralight axions.\n", "  By spectrally hole burning an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of ions\nwhile applying a controlled perturbation, one can obtain spectral holes that\nare functionalized for maximum sensitivity to different perturbations. We\npropose to use such hole burnt structures for the dispersive optical\ninteraction with rare-earth ion dopants whose frequencies are sensitive to\ncrystal strain due to the bending motion of a crystal cantilever. A\nquantitative analysis shows that good optical sensitivity to the bending motion\nis obtained if a magnetic field gradient is applied across the crystal during\nhole burning, and that the resulting opto-mechanical coupling strength is\nsufficient for observing quantum features such as zero point vibrations.\n", "  In this paper, firstly, we consider bipartite entanglement between each part\nof an optomechanical cavity composed of one dimensional Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC). we investigate atomic collision on the behavior of the BEC in\nthe week photon-atom coupling constant, and use Bogoliubov approximation for\nthe BEC. Secondly under above condition, we propose a scheme for entanglement\nswapping protocol wich involves tripartite systems. In our investigation, we\nconsider a scenario where BECs, moving mirrors, and optical cavity modes are\ngiven in a Gaussian state with a covariance matrix (CM). By applying the Bell\nmeasurment to the output optical field modes, we show how the remote\nentanglement between two BECs, two moving mirrors, and BEC-mirror modes in\ndifferent optomechanical cavity can be generated.\n", "  Recently, $\\alpha$-$\\textrm{RuCl}_3$ has attracted much attention as a\npossible material realization of the honeycomb Kitaev model, which may\nstabilize a quantum-spin-liquid state. Compared to extensive studies on its\nmagnetic properties, there is still a lack of understanding on its electronic\nstructure, which is strongly related with its Kitaev physics. Here, the\nelectronic structure of $\\alpha$-$\\textrm{RuCl}_3$ is investigated by\nphotoemission (PE) and inverse photoemission (IPE) spectroscopies. The band\ngap, directly measured from PE/IPE spectra, is found to be 1.9 eV, much larger\nthan previous estimations. The LDA calculations show that the on-site Coulomb\ninteraction $\\textit{U}$ can open the band gap without spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). However, the SOC should also be incorporated to reproduce the proper gap\nsize, indicating that the interplay between $\\textit{U}$ and SOC plays an\nessential role in the physics of $\\alpha$-$\\textrm{RuCl}_3$. There exist some\nspectral features in PE/IPE spectra which cannot be explained by the LDA\ncalculations. To explain such discrepancies, we perform the\nconfiguration-interaction calculations for a ${\\textrm{RuCl}}_6^{3-}$ cluster.\nThe experimental data and calculations demonstrate that the 4$\\textit{d}$\ncompound $\\alpha$-$\\textrm{RuCl}_3$ is a $J_{\\textrm{eff}}$ = 1/2 Mott\ninsulator rather than a quasimolecular-orbital insulator. Our study also\nprovides important physical parameters, required in verifying the proposed\nKitaev physics in $\\alpha$-$\\textrm{RuCl}_3$.\n", "  We prove an inequality with applications to solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. There is a universal constant $c>0$, such that if $\\Omega \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^2$ is simply connected, $u:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ vanishes\non the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$, and $|u|$ assumes a maximum in $x_0 \\in\n\\Omega$, then $$ \\inf_{y \\in \\partial \\Omega}{ \\| x_0 - y\\|} \\geq c \\left\\|\n\\frac{\\Delta u}{u} \\right\\|^{-1/2}_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}.$$ It was conjectured\nby P\\'olya \\& Szeg\\H{o} (and proven, independently, by Makai and Hayman) that a\nmembrane vibrating at frequency $\\lambda$ contains a disk of size $\\sim\n\\lambda^{-1/2}$. Our inequality implies a refined result: the point on the\nmembrane that achieves the maximal amplitude is at distance $\\sim\n\\lambda^{-1/2}$ from the boundary. We also give an extension to higher\ndimensions (generalizing results of Lieb and Georgiev \\& Mukherjee): if $u$\nsolves $-\\Delta u = Vu$ on $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ with Dirichlet\nboundary conditions, then the ball $B$ with radius $\\sim\n\\|V\\|_{L^{\\infty}(\\Omega)}^{-1/2}$ centered at the point in which $|u|$ assumes\na maximum is almost fully contained in $\\Omega$ in the sense that $|B \\cap\n\\Omega| \\geq 0.99 |B|.$\n", "  The coalescence in dense arrays of spontaneously formed GaN nanowires\nproceeds by bundling: adjacent nanowires bend and merge at their top, thus\nreducing their surface energy at the expense of the elastic energy of bending.\nWe give a theoretical description of the energetics of this bundling process.\nThe bending energy is shown to be substantially reduced by the creation of\ndislocations at the coalescence joints. A comparison of experimental and\ncalculated x-ray diffraction profiles from ensembles of bundled nanowires\ndemonstrates that a large part of the bending energy is indeed relaxed by\nplastic deformation. The residual bending manifests itself by extended tails of\nthe diffraction profiles.\n", "  Amorphous Si (a-Si) nanostructures are ubiquitous in numerous electronic and\noptoelectronic devices. Amorphous materials are considered to possess the lower\nlimit to the thermal conductivity (k), which is ~1 W/m-K for a-Si. However,\nrecent work suggested that k of micro-thick a-Si films can be greater than 3\nW/m-K, which is contributed by propagating vibrational modes, referred to as\n\"propagons\". However, precise determination of k in a-Si has been elusive.\nHere, we used novel structures of a-Si nanotubes and suspended a-Si films that\nenabled precise in-plane k measurement within a wide thickness range of 5 nm to\n1.7 um. We showed unexpectedly high in plane k in a-Si nanostructures, reaching\n~3.0 and 5.3 W/m-K at 100 nm and 1.7 um, respectively. Furthermore, the\nmeasured in plane k is significantly higher than the cross-plane k on the same\nfilms. This usually high and anisotropic k in the amorphous Si nanostructures\nmanifests the surprising broad propaganda mean free path distribution, which is\nfound to range from 10 nm to 10 um, in the disordered and atomically isotropic\nstructure. This result provides an unambiguous answer to the century-old\nproblem regarding the mean free path distribution of propagons and also shed\nlight on the design and performance of numerous a-Si based electronic and\noptoelectronics devices.\n", "  We report on the production of 39 K matter-wave bright solitons, i.e., 1D\nmatter-waves that propagate without dispersion thanks to attractive\ninteractions. The volume of the soliton is studied as a function of the\nscattering length through three-body losses, revealing peak densities as high\nas $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{20} m^{-3}$. Our solitons, close to the collapse\nthreshold, are strongly bound and will find applications in fundamental physics\nand atom interferometry.\n", "  We present a novel theoretical approach to simulate spin, time and\nangular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) from first principles that\nis applicable to surfaces, thin films, few layer systems, and low-dimensional\nnanostructures. The method is based on a general formulation in the framework\nof time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to describe the real\ntime-evolution of electrons escaping from a surface under the effect of any\nexternal (arbitrary) laser field. By extending the so called t-SURFF method to\nperiodic systems one can calculate the final photoelectron spectrum by\ncollecting the flux of the ionization current trough an analysing surface. The\nresulting approach, that we named t-SURFFP, allows to describe a wide range of\nirradiation conditions without any assumption on the dynamics of the ionization\nprocess allowing for pump-probe simulations on an equal footing. To illustrate\nthe wide scope of applicability of the method we present applications to\ngraphene, mono- and bi-layer WSe$_2$, and hexagonal BN under different laser\nconfigurations.\n", "  We present predictions for $t \\bar t$ and $t \\bar t H$ production and decay\nat future lepton colliders including non-resonant and interference\ncontributions up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD. The\nobtained precision predictions are necessary for a future precise determination\nof the top-quark Yukawa coupling, and allow for top-quark phenomenology in the\ncontinuum at an unprecedented level of accuracy. Simulations are performed with\nthe automated NLO Monte-Carlo framework WHIZARD interfaced to the OpenLoops\nmatrix element generator.\n", "  Non-diffusive thermal transport has gained extensive research interest\nrecently due to its important implications on fundamental understanding of\nmaterial phonon mean free path distributions and many nanoscale energy\napplications. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of boundary\nscattering and nanowire length on the nondiffusive thermal transport in thin\nsilicon nanowires by rigorously solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation\nusing a variance reduced Monte Carlo technique across a range of temperatures.\nThe simulations use the complete phonon dispersion and spectral lifetime data\nobtained from first-principle density function theory calculations as input\nwithout any adjustable parameters. Our BTE simulation results show that the\nnanowire length plays an important role in determining the thermal conductivity\nof silicon nanowires. In addition, our simulation results suggest significant\nphonon confinement effect for the previously measured silicon nanowires. These\nfindings are important for a comprehensive understanding of microscopic\nnon-diffusive thermal transport in silicon nanowires.\n", "  Quantum steering, also called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, is the\nintriguing phenomenon associated with the ability of spatially separated\nobservers to steer---by means of local measurements---the set of conditional\nquantum states accessible by a distant party. In the light of quantum\ninformation, all steerable quantum states are known to be resources for quantum\ninformation processing tasks. Here, via a quantity dubbed steering fraction, we\nderive a simple, but general criterion that allows one to identify quantum\nstates that can exhibit quantum steering, thus making an important step towards\nthe characterization of steerable quantum states. The criterion, in turn, also\nprovides upper bounds on the largest steering-inequality violation achievable\nby arbitrary finite-dimensional maximally entangled states. For the\nquantification of steerability, we prove that a strengthened version of the\nsteering fraction is a convex steering monotone and demonstrate how it is\nrelated to two others, namely, steerable weight and steering robustness. Using\nthese tools, we further demonstrate the superactivation of steerability, i.e.,\nwe show how the steerability of certain entangled, but unsteerable quantum\nstates can be recovered by allowing joint measurements on multiple copies of\nthe same state. In particular, our approach allows one to explicitly construct\na steering inequality to manifest this phenomenon. Finally, we prove that there\nexist quantum states (including some unsteerable under projective measurements)\nwhose steering-inequality violation can be arbitrarily amplified by allowing\njoint measurements on three copies of the same state. For completeness, we also\ndemonstrate how the largest steering-inequality violation can be used to bound\nthe largest Bell-inequality violation and derive, analogously, a simple\nsufficient condition for Bell-nonlocality from the latter.\n", "  After establishing stochastic thermodynamics for underdamped Langevin systems\nin contact with multiple reservoirs, we derive its overdamped limit using\ntimescale separation techniques. The overdamped theory is different from the\nnaive theory that one obtains when starting from overdamped Langevin or\nFokker-Planck dynamics and only coincide with it in presence of a single\nreservoir. The reason is that the coarse-grained fast momenta dynamics reaches\na nonequilibrium state which conducts heat in presence of multiple reservoirs.\nThe underdamped and overdamped theory are both shown to satisfy fundamental\nfluctuation theorems. Their predictions for the heat statistics are derived\nanalytically for a Brownian particle on a ring in contact with two reservoirs\nand subjected to a non-conservative force and are shown to coincide in the\nlong-time limit.\n", "  In this paper we investigate a particular ghost-free bimetric theory that\nexhibits the partially massless (PM) symmetry at quadratic order. At this order\nthe global SO(1,4) symmetry of the theory is enhanced to SO(1,5). We show that\nthis global symmetry becomes inconsistent at cubic order, in agreement with a\nprevious calculation. Furthermore, we find that the PM symmetry of this theory\ncannot be extended beyond cubic order in the PM field. More importantly, it is\nshown that the PM symmetry cannot be extended to quartic order in any theory\nwith one massless and one massive spin-2 fields.\n", "  The growth index of matter fluctuations is computed for ten distinct\naccelerating cosmological models and confronted to the latest growth rate data\nvia a two-step process. First, we implement a joint statistical analysis in\norder to place constraints on the free parameters of all models using solely\nbackground data. Second, using the observed growth rate of clustering from\nvarious galaxy surveys we test the performance of the current cosmological\nmodels at the perturbation level while either marginalizing over $\\sigma_8$ or\nhaving it as a free parameter. As a result, we find that at a statistical\nlevel, i.e. after considering the best-fit $\\chi^2$ or the value of the Akaike\ninformation criterion, most models are in very good agreement with the growth\nrate data and are practically indistinguishable from $\\Lambda$CDM. However,\nwhen we also consider the internal consistency of the models by comparing the\ntheoretically predicted values of $(\\gamma_0, \\gamma_1)$, i.e. the value of the\ngrowth index $\\gamma(z)$ and its derivative today, with the best-fit ones, we\nfind that the predictions of three out of ten dark energy models are in mild\ntension with the best-fit ones when $\\sigma_8$ is marginalized over. When\n$\\sigma_8$ is free we find that most models are not only in mild tension, but\nalso predict low values for $\\sigma_8$. This could be attributed to either a\nsystematic problem with the growth-rate data or the emergence of new physics at\nlow redshifts, with the latter possibly being related to the well-known issue\nof the lack of power at small scales. Finally, by utilizing mock data based on\nan LSST-like survey we show that with future surveys and by using the growth\nindex parameterization, it will be possible to resolve the issue of the low\n$\\sigma_8$ but also the tension between the fitted and theoretically predicted\nvalues of $(\\gamma_0, \\gamma_1)$.\n", "  Since the discovery of iron-based superconductors, a number of theories have\nbeen put forward to explain the qualitative origin of pairing, but there have\nbeen few attempts to make quantitative, material-specific comparisons to\nexperimental results. The spin-fluctuation theory of electronic pairing, based\non first-principles electronic structure calculations, makes predictions for\nthe superconducting gap. Within the same framework, the surface wave functions\nmay also be calculated, allowing, e.g., for detailed comparisons between\ntheoretical results and measured scanning tunneling topographs and spectra.\nHere we present such a comparison between theory and experiment on the Fe-based\nsuperconductor LiFeAs. Results for the homogeneous surface as well as impurity\nstates are presented as a benchmark test of the theory. For the homogeneous\nsystem, we argue that the maxima of topographic image intensity may be located\nat positions above either the As or Li atoms, depending on tip height and the\nsetpoint current of the measurement. We further report the experimental\nobservation of transitions between As and Li-registered lattices as functions\nof both tip height and setpoint bias, in agreement with this prediction. Next,\nwe give a detailed comparison between the simulated scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy images of transition-metal defects with experiment. Finally, we\ndiscuss possible extensions of the current framework to obtain a theory with\ntrue predictive power for scanning tunneling microscopy in Fe-based systems.\n", "  We examine the low energy phenomenology of the relaxion solution to the weak\nscale hierarchy problem. Assuming that the Hubble friction is responsible for a\ndissipation of the relaxion energy, we identify the cosmological relaxion\nwindow which corresponds to the parameter region compatible with a given value\nof the acceptable number of inflationary $e$-foldings. We then discuss a\nvariety of observational constraints on the relaxion window, including those\nfrom astrophysical and cosmological considerations. We find that majority of\nthe parameter space with a relaxion mass $m_\\phi\\gtrsim 100$ eV or a relaxion\ndecay constant $f\\lesssim 10^7$ GeV is excluded by existing constraints. There\nis an interesting parameter region with $m_\\phi\\sim \\,0.2-10$ GeV and $f\\sim\\,\n{\\rm few}-200$ TeV, which is allowed by existing constraints, but can be probed\nsoon by future beam dump experiments such as the SHiP experiment, or by\nimproved EDM experiments.\n", "  We study the relaxation dynamics of a compressible bilayer vesicle with an\nasymmetry in the viscosity of the inner and outer fluid medium. First we\nexplore the stability of the vesicle free energy which includes a coupling\nbetween the membrane curvature and the local density difference between the two\nmonolayers. Two types of instabilities are identified: a small wavelength\ninstability and a larger wavelength instability. Considering the bulk fluid\nviscosity and the inter-monolayer friction as the dissipation sources, we next\nemploy Onsager's variational principle to derive the coupled equations both for\nthe membrane and the bulk fluid. The three relaxation modes are coupled to each\nother due to the bilayer and the spherical structure of the vesicle. Most\nimportantly, a higher fluid viscosity inside the vesicle shifts the cross-over\nmode between the bending and the slipping to a larger value. As the vesicle\nparameters approach toward the unstable regions, the relaxation dynamics is\ndramatically slowed down, and the corresponding mode structure changes\nsignificantly. In some limiting cases, our general result reduces to the\npreviously obtained relaxation rates.\n", "  It is now widely believed that research should be an essential and integral\npart of under-graduate studies. In recent years there has been a conscious\neffort to bring research opportunities to the physics under-graduates in India.\nWe argue that the need for the hour is a methodical evaluation of the existing\nunder-graduate research programs for their effectiveness in preparing the\nstudents for a career in physics.\n", "  We present high-resolution (0\".4) mid-infrared (mid-IR) polarimetric images\nand spectra of WL 16, a Herbig Ae star at a distance of 125 pc. WL 16 is\nsurrounded by a protoplanetary disk of $\\sim$ 900 AU in diameter, making it one\nof the most extended Herbig Ae/Be disks as seen in the mid-IR. The star is\nbehind, or embedded in, the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud, and obscured by\n28 magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths by the foreground cloud.\nMid-IR polarization of WL 16, mainly arises from aligned elongated dust grains\npresent along the line of sight, suggesting a uniform morphology of\npolarization vectors with an orientation of 33\\degr (East from North) and a\npolarization fraction of $\\sim$ 2.0\\%. This orientation is consistent with\nprevious polarimetric surveys in the optical and near-IR bands to probe\nlarge-scale magnetic fields in the Ophiuchus star formation region, indicating\nthat the observed mid-IR polarization toward WL 16 is produced by the dichroic\nabsorption of magnetically aligned foreground dust grains by a uniform magnetic\nfield. Using polarizations of WL 16 and Elias 29, a nearby polarization\nstandard star, we constrain the polarization efficiency,\n\\textit{$p_{10.3}/A_{10.3}$}, for the dust grains in the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus\nmolecular cloud to be $\\sim$ 1.0\\% mag$^{-1}$. WL 16 has polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission features detected at 8.6, 11.2, 12.0, and 12.7\n$\\mu$m by our spectroscopic data, and we find an anti-correlation between the\nPAH surface brightness and the PAH ionization fraction between the NW and SW\nsides of the disk.\n", "  Many atmospheres (cool stars, brown dwarfs, giant planets, extrasolar\nplanets) are predominately composed of molecular hydrogen and helium.\nH$_2{}^{16}$O is one of the best measured molecules in extrasolar planetary\natmospheres to date and a major compound in the atmospheres of brown-dwarfs and\noxygen-rich cool stars, yet the scope of experimental and theoretical studies\non the pressure broadening of water vapour lines by collision with hydrogen and\nhelium remains limited.\n  Theoretical H$_2$- and He-broadening parameters of water vapour lines\n(rotational quantum number $J$ up to 50) are obtained for temperatures in the\nrange 300 - 2000 K. Two approaches for calculation of line widths were used:\n(i) the averaged energy difference method and (ii) the empirical expression for\n$J$\\p $J$\\pp-dependence.\n  Voigt profiles based on these widths and the BT2 line list are used to\ngenerate high resolution ($\\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}$ = 0.01 \\cm) pressure broadened\ncross sections for a fixed range of temperatures and pressures between 300 -\n2000 K and 0.001 - 10 bar. An interpolation procedure which can be used to\ndetermine cross sections at intermediate temperature and pressure is described.\nPressure broadening parameters and cross sections are presented in new ExoMol\nformat.\n", "  Hyperentanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing\nwith its high capacity character, defined as the entanglement in multiple\ndegrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, such as polarization,\nspatial-mode, orbit-angular-momentum, time-bin and frequency DOFs of photons.\nRecently, hyperentanglement attracts much attention as all the multiple DOFs\ncan be used to carry information in quantum information processing fully. In\nthis review, we present an overview of the progress achieved so far in the\nfield of hyperentanglement in photon systems and some of its important\napplications in quantum information processing, including hyperentanglement\ngeneration, complete hyperentangled-Bell-state analysis, hyperentanglement\nconcentration, and hyperentanglement purification for high-capacity\nlong-distance quantum communication. Also, a scheme for hyper-controlled-not\ngate is introduced for hyperparallel photonic quantum computation, which can\nperform two controlled-not gate operations on both the polarization and\nspatial-mode DOFs and depress the resources consumed and the photonic\ndissipation.\n", "  $Q_{\\rm int}$($T$), of the H$_2$$^{16}$O molecule is reported for\ntemperatures between 0 and 6000 K. Determination of $Q_{\\rm int}$($T$) is\nprincipally based on the direct summation technique involving all accurate\nexperimental energy levels known for H$_2$$^{16}$O (almost 20~000 rovibrational\nenergies including an almost complete list up to a relative energy of 7500\n\\cm), augmented with a less accurate but complete list of first-principles\ncomputed rovibrational energy levels up to the first dissociation limit, about\n41~000 \\cm\\ (the latter list includes close to one million bound rovibrational\nenergy levels up to $J = 69$, where $J$ is the rotational quantum number).\nPartition functions are developed for {\\it ortho}- and {\\it para}-H$_2$$^{16}$O\nas well as for their equilibrium mixture. Unbound rovibrational states above\nthe first dissociation limit are considered using an approximate model\ntreatment. The effect of the excited electronic states on the thermochemical\nfunctions is neglected, as their contribution to the thermochemical functions\nis negligible even at the highest temperatures considered. Based on the\nhigh-accuracy $Q_{\\rm int}$($T$) and its first two moments, definitive results,\nin 1~K increments, are obtained for the following thermochemical functions:\nGibbs energy, standardized enthalpy, entropy, and isobaric heat capacity.\nReliable approximately two standard deviation uncertainties, as a function of\ntemperature, are estimated for each quantity determined. These uncertainties\nemphasize that the present results are the most accurate ideal-gas\nthermochemical functions ever produced for H$_2$$^{16}$O. It is recommended\nthat the new value determined for the standard molar enthalpy increment at\n298.15~K, $9.90404 \\pm 0.00001$ kJ~mol$^{-1}$, should replace the old CODATA\ndatum, $9.905 \\pm 0.005$ kJ~mol$^{-1}$.\n", "  Prototype scintilator+WLS strips with SiPM readout for large muon detection\nsystems were tested in the muon beam of the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. Light\nyield of up to 137 photoelectrons per muon per strip has been observed, as well\nas time resolution of 330 ps and position resolution along the strip of 5.4 cm.\n", "  We construct an error-detected block, assisted by the quantum-dot spins in\ndouble-sided optical microcavities. With this block, we propose three\nerror-detected schemes for the deterministic generation, the complete analysis,\nand the complete nondestructive analysis of hyperentangled Bell states in both\nthe polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom of two-photon systems. In\nthese schemes, the errors can be detected, which can improve their fidelities\nlargely, far different from other previous schemes assisted by the interaction\nbetween the photon and the quantum-dot-cavity system. Our scheme for the\ndeterministic generation of hyperentangled two-photon systems can be performed\nby repeat until success. These features make our schemes more useful in\nhigh-capacity quantum communication with hyperentanglement in the future.\n", "  We report the controllable growth and the intriguing transport behavior of\nhigh-spin-polarization epitaxial L21-Co2MnAl films, which exhibit a\nlow-temperature (T) resistivity upturn with pronounced T1/2 dependence, close\nrelevance to structural disorder, and robust independence of magnetic fields.\nThe resistivity upturn turns out to be qualitatively contradictory to weak\nlocalization, particle-particle channel electron-electron interaction (EEI),\nand orbital two-channel Kondo effect, leaving a three-dimensional particle-hole\nchannel EEI the most likely physical source. Our result highlights a\nconsiderable tunability of the structural and electronic disorder of magnetic\nfilms by varying growth temperature, affording unprecedented insights into the\nspin polarization and the resistivity upturn.\n", "  The forward Drell--Yan process in $pp$ scattering at the LHC at $\\sqrt{S}=14$\nTeV is considered. We analyze the Drell--Yan structure functions assuming the\ndominance of a Compton-like emission of a virtual photon from a fast quark\nscattering off the small $x$ gluons. The color dipole framework is applied to\nperform quantitatively the twist decomposition of all the Drell--Yan structure\nfunctions. Two models of the color dipole scattering are applied: the\nGolec-Biernat--W\\\"{u}sthoff model and the dipole cross section obtained from\nthe Balitsky--Fadin--Kuraev--Lipatov evolution equation. The two models have\nessentially different higher twist content and the gluon transverse momentum\ndistribution and lead to different significant effects beyond the collinear\nleading twist description. It is found that the gluon transverse momentum\neffects are significant in the Drell--Yan structure functions for all\nDrell--Yan pair masses $M$, and the higher twist effects become important for\n$M \\lesssim 10$ GeV. It is found that the structure function $W_{TT}$ related\nto the $A_2$ angular coefficient and the Lam--Tung observable $A_0 -A_2$ are\nparticularly sensitive to the gluon $k_T$ effects and to the higher twist\neffects. A procedure is suggested how to disentangle the higher twist effects\nfrom the gluon transverse momentum effects.\n", "  We develop a novel formulation of the hadron-resonance gas model which,\nbesides a hard-core repulsion, explicitly accounts for the surface tension\ninduced by the interaction between the particles. Such an equation of state\nallows us to go beyond the Van der Waals approximation for any number of\ndifferent hard-core radii. A comparison with the Carnahan-Starling equation of\nstate shows that the new model is valid for packing fractions 0.2-0.22, while\nthe usual Van der Waals model is inapplicable at packing fractions above\n0.1-0.11. Moreover, it is shown that the equation of state with induced surface\ntension is softer than the one of hard spheres and remains causal at higher\nparticle densities. The great advantage of our model is that there are only two\nequations to be solved and it does not depend on the various values of the\nhard-core radii used for different hadronic resonances. Using this novel\nequation of state we obtain a high-quality fit of the ALICE hadron\nmultiplicities measured at center-of-mass energies of 2.76 TeV per nucleon.\nFurthermore, using the traditional hadron-resonance gas model with\nmulti-component hard-core repulsion and the novel one we investigate the\nrecently suggested model in which the proper volume of a hadron is proportional\nto its mass. We find that the high-temperature maximum of $\\chi^2/ndf$ observed\nin the latter model always appears in the region located far above the limit of\nits applicability.\n", "  The liquid droplet formula is applied to an analysis of the properties of\ngeometrical (anti)clusters formed in SU(2) gluodynamics by the Polyakov loops\nof the same sign. Using this approach, we explain the phase transition in SU(2)\ngluodynamics as a transition between two liquids during which one of the liquid\ndroplets (the largest cluster of a certain Polyakov loop sign) experiences a\ncondensation, while another droplet (the next to the largest cluster of the\nopposite sign of Polyakov loop) evaporates. The clusters of smaller sizes form\ntwo accompanying gases, which behave oppositely to their liquids. The liquid\ndroplet formula is used to analyze the size distributions of the gas\n(anti)clusters. The fit of these distributions allows us to extract the\ntemperature dependence of surface tension and the value of Fisher topological\nexponent $\\tau$ for both kinds of gaseous clusters. It is shown that the\nsurface tension coeficient of gaseous (anti)clusters can serve as an order\nparameter of the deconfinement phase transition in SU(2) gluodynamics. The\nFisher topological exponent $\\tau$ of (anti)clusters is found to have the same\nvalue $1.806 \\pm 0.008$. This value disagrees with the famous Fisher droplet\nmodel, but it agrees well with an exactly solvable model of nuclear liquid-gas\nphase transition. This finding may evidence for the fact that the SU(2)\ngluodynamics and this exactly solvable model of nuclear liquid-gas phase\ntransition are in the same universality class.\n", "  Searchers for various irregularities in the behavior of thermodynamic\nquantities at chemical freeze-out (CFO) are rather important in a view of\nexperimental studies of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Using the multicomponent\nhadron resonance gas model (HRGM), developed in (Sagun, 2014; Bugaev et al.,\n2015), we performed a high-quality fit of 111 hadronic ratios measured for 14\nvalues of the center of mass collision energies between 2.7 GeV and 200 GeV\nwith the overall fit quality $\\chi^2/dof \\simeq 0.95$. In addition to\npreviously reported singularities (Bugaev et al., 2015) at CFO we found that\nthe hadron yield ratios $\\frac{\\Lambda}{p}$, $\\frac{K^{+}}{p}$,\n$\\frac{K^{+}}{\\Lambda}$, $\\frac{\\Omega^{-}}{p}$ and $\\frac{\\Xi^{-}}{p}$\nmeasured in central nuclear collisions demonstrate a significant change of\nslope in the same range of center of mass collision energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =\n4.3-4.9$ GeV (Bugaev et al., 2015). This change of slopes is accompanied by a\ndramatic increase of resonance decays at CFO.\n  Also at CFO the trace anomaly and baryonic density demonstrate the pronounced\npeaks at the collision energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 4.9 $ GeV. We argue that all\nthese and previously found irregularities provide an evidence for the QGP\nformation in nuclear collisions at about $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 4.9 $ GeV.\n", "  Applying the effective Hamilton for $b\\rightarrow sl^+l^-,\\;(l=e,\\;\\mu)$ in\nthe framework of minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model with\nlocal $B-L$ gauge symmetry, we investigate branching ratios and\nforward-backward asymmetries of rare decay $B\\rightarrow X_{_S}l^+l^-$ in low\nand high $q^2$ regions, respectively. In addition we also study the $CP$\nasymmetries depending on new $CP$ phases from soft breaking terms in low and\nhigh $q^2$ regions. With some assumptions on parameter space of the model, the\nnumerical analyses of the supersymmetric contributions to the branching ratios,\nforward-backward and $CP$ asymmetries of $B\\rightarrow X_{_S}l^+l^-$ are\npresented in low and high $q^2$ regions, respectively.\n", "  Effects of a uniform magnetic field on homoclinic bifurcations in\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection in a fluid of Prandtl number $Pr = 0.01$ are\ninvestigated using direct numerical simulations (DNS). A uniform magnetic field\nis applied either in the vertical or in the horizontal direction. For a weak\nvertical magnetic field, the possibilities of both forward and backward\nhomoclinic bifurcations are observed leading to a spontaneous merging of two\nlimit cycles into one as well as a spontaneous breaking of a limit cycle into\ntwo for lower values of the Chandrasekhar's number ($Q\\leq 5$). A slightly\nstronger magnetic field makes the convective flow time independent giving the\npossibility of stationary patterns at the secondary instability. For horizontal\nmagnetic field, the $x\\leftrightharpoons y$ symmetry is destroyed and neither a\nhomoclinic gluing nor a homoclinic breaking is observed. Two low-dimensional\nmodels are also constructed: one for a weak vertical magnetic field and another\nfor a weak horizontal magnetic field. The models qualitatively capture the\nfeatures observed in DNS and help understanding the unfolding of bifurcations\nclose to the onset of magnetoconvection.\n", "  This paper presents the development of an in situ measurement system known as\nthe Debris Resistive Acoustic Grid Orbital Navy/NASA Sensor (DRAGONS). The\nDRAGONS system is designed to detect impacts caused by particles ranging from\n50 micrometers to 1 mm at both low-earth and geostationary orbits. DRAGONS\nutilizes a combination of low-cost sensor technologies to facilitate accurate\nmeasurements and approximations of the size, velocity, and angle of impacting\nmicrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). Two thin layers of kapton sheets\nwith resistive traces are used to detect the changes in resistance that are\ndirectly proportional to the impacting force caused by the fast traveling\nparticles. Four polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensors are positioned in the\nback of each kapton sheet to measure acoustic strain caused by an impact. The\nelectronic hardware module that controls all operations employs a low-power,\nmodular, and compact design that enables it to be installed as a low-resource\nload on a host satellite. Laboratory results demonstrate that in addition to\nhaving the ability to detect an impact event, the DRAGONS system can determine\nimpact location, speed, and angle of impact with a mean error of 1.4 cm, 0.2\nkm/s, and 5{\\deg}. The DRAGONS system could be deployed as an add-on subsystem\nof a payload to enable a real-time, in-depth study of the properties of MMOD.\n", "  In the previous works harmonic, phase-mixed, Alfven wave dynamics was\nconsidered both in the kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic regimes. Up today only\nmagnetohydrodynamic, phase-mixed, Gaussian Alfven pulses were investigated. In\nthe present work we extend this into kinetic regime. Here phase-mixed, Gaussian\nAlfven pulses are studied, which are more appropriate for solar flares, than\nharmonic waves, as the flares are impulsive in nature. Collisionless,\nphase-mixed, dispersive, Gaussian Alfven pulse in transversely inhomogeneous\nplasma is investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and by an\nanalytical model. The pulse is in inertial regime with plasma beta less than\nelectron-to-ion mass ratio and has a spatial width of 12 ion inertial length.\nThe linear analytical model predicts that the pulse amplitude decrease is\ndescribed by the linear Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation. The numerical and\nanalytical solution of the linear KdV equation produces the pulse amplitude\ndecrease in time as $t^{-1}$. The latter scaling law is corroborated by full\nPIC simulations. It is shown that the pulse amplitude decrease is due to\ndispersive effects, while electron acceleration is due to Landau damping of the\nphase-mixed waves. The established amplitude decrease in time as $t^{-1}$ is\ndifferent from the MHD scaling of $t^{-3/2}$. This can be attributed to the\ndispersive effects resulting in the different scaling compared to MHD, where\nthe resistive effects cause the damping, in turn, enhanced by the\ninhomogeneity. Reducing background plasma temperature and increase in ion mass\nyields more efficient particle acceleration.\n", "  The ferromagnetic semiconductor Ba2NiOsO6 (Tmag ~100 K) was synthesized at 6\nGPa and 1500 {\\deg}C. It crystallizes into a double perovskite structure\n[Fm-3m; a = 8.0428(1) {\\AA}], where the Ni2+ and Os6+ ions are perfectly\nordered at the perovskite B-site. We show that the spin-orbit coupling of Os6+\nplays an essential role in opening the charge gap. The magnetic state was\ninvestigated by density functional theory calculations and powder neutron\ndiffraction. The latter revealed a collinear ferromagnetic order in a >21 kOe\nmagnetic field at 5 K. The ferromagnetic gapped state is fundamentally\ndifferent from that of known dilute magnetic semiconductors such as (Ga,Mn)As\nand (Cd,Mn)Te (Tmag < 180 K), the spin-gapless semiconductor Mn2CoAl (Tmag ~720\nK), and the ferromagnetic insulators EuO (Tmag ~70 K) and Bi3Cr3O11 (Tmag ~220\nK). It is also qualitatively different from known ferrimagnetic\ninsulator/semiconductors, which are characterized by an antiparallel spin\narrangement. Our finding of the ferromagnetic semiconductivity of Ba2NiOsO6\nshould increase interest in the platinum group oxides, because this new class\nof materials should be useful in the development of spintronic, quantum\nmagnetic, and related devices.\n", "  High-resolution absorption spectra of \\NH\\ in the region 2100 - 5500 \\cm\\ at\n1027 $^{\\circ}$C and atmospheric pressure (1045 $\\pm$ 3 mbar) are measured. An\n\\NH\\ concentration of 10\\% in volume fraction is used in the measurements.\nSpectra are recorded in a high-temperature gas-flow cell using a Fourier\nTransform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer at a nominal resolution of 0.09 \\cm. The\nspectra are analysed by comparison to a variational line list, BYTe, and\nexperimental energy levels determined using the MARVEL procedure. 2308 lines\nhave been assigned to 45 different bands, of which 1755 and 15 have been\nassigned or observed for the first time in this work.\n", "  Voltage and charge distributions in cellular microdomains regulate\ncommunications, excitability, and signal transduction. We report here new\nelectrical laws in a cell, which follow from a nonlinear electro-diffusion\nmodel. These newly discovered relations derive from the geometrical\ncell-membrane properties, such as membrane curvature, volume, and surface area.\nThese electro-diffusion laws can now be used to predict and interpret voltage\ndistribution in cellular microdomains.\n", "  This paper reviews the status of women in science, physics in particular, in\nCyprus. We describe the development of physics in the country, focusing on the\ncontributions and participation of women. We present statistical data for the\nlast several years, reviewing the percentage of women who are pursuing physics\nas a subject of study or as a profession. We report the gender ratios at\ndifferent career stages and find that while women are well represented in\nundergraduate studies, female physicists are underrepresented in senior\npositions. We discuss factors that might affect the career evolution of women\nin physics in Cyprus.\n", "  Here we study naturalness problem in a type II seesaw model, and show that\nthe Veltman condition modified (mVC) by virtue of the additional scalar charged\nstates is satisfied at one loop within a region of the allowed parameter space\nof the model. The latter is severely constrained by unitarity and boundedness\nfrom below as well as by consistency with the diphoton Higgs decay data of the\nLHC run 1. In this context, our analysis of the naturalness condition affects\ndramatically the masses of heavy Higgs bosons $H^0$, $A^0$, $H^\\pm$ and\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}$, reducing the ranges of variation of $m_{H^\\pm}$ and\n$m_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}$ with an upper bounds at 288 and 351 GeV, respectively, while\nthe neutral Higgs bosons $H^0$, $A^0$ are found to be almost degenerate at\nabout 207 GeV.\n", "  Interactions in electron systems can lead to viscous flows in which\ncorrelations allow electrons to avoid disorder scattering, reducing momentum\nloss and dissipation. We illustrate this behavior in a viscous pinball model,\ndescribing electrons moving in the presence of dilute point-like defects.\nConductivity is found to obey an additive relation\n$\\sigma=\\sigma_0+\\Delta\\sigma$, with a non-interacting Drude contribution\n$\\sigma_0$ and a contribution $\\Delta\\sigma>0$ describing conductivity\nenhancement due to interactions. The quantity $\\Delta\\sigma$ is enhanced by a\nlogarithmically large factor originating from the Stokes paradox at the\nhydrodynamic lengthscales and, in addition, from an effect of repeated returns\nto the same scatterer due to backreflection in the carrier-carrier collisions\noccurring at the ballistic lengthscales. The interplay between these effects is\nessential at the ballistic-to-viscous crossover.\n", "  Recently, the phenomenon of quantum-classical correspondence breakdown was\nuncovered in optomechanics, where in the classical regime the system exhibits\nchaos but in the corresponding quantum regime the motion is regular - there\nappears to be no signature of classical chaos whatsoever in the corresponding\nquantum system, generating a paradox. We find that transient chaos, besides\nbeing a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself, provides a resolution.\nUsing the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics\nsubject to continuous homodyne detection, we uncover transient chaos associated\nwith quantum trajectories. The transient behavior is consistent with chaos in\nthe classical limit, while the long term evolution of the quantum system is\nregular. Transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum-classical\ntransition (QCT). Strikingly, as the system transitions from the quantum to the\nclassical regime, the average chaotic transient lifetime increases dramatically\n(faster than the Ehrenfest time characterizing the QCT for isolated quantum\nsystems). We develop a physical theory to explain the scaling law.\n", "  We consider two cases of interaction between a planar shock and a cylindrical\ndensity interface. In the first case (planar normal shock), the axis of the gas\ncylinder is parallel to the shock front, and baroclinic vorticity deposited by\nthe shock is predominantly two-dimensional (directed along the axis of the\ncylinder). In the second case, the cylinder is tilted, resulting in an oblique\nshock interaction, and a fully three-dimensional shock-induced vorticity field.\nThe statistical properties of the flow for both cases are analyzed based on\nimages from two orthogonal visualization planes, using structure functions of\nthe intensity maps of fluorescent tracer pre-mixed with the heavy gas. At later\ntimes, these structure functions exhibit power-law-like behavior over a\nconsiderable range of scales. Manifestation of this behavior is remarkably\nconsistent in terms of dimensionless time defined based on Richtmyer's linear\ntheory within the range of Mach numbers from 1.1 to 2.0 and the range of gas\ncylinder tilt angles with respect to the plane of the shock front (0 to 30\ndegrees).\n", "  Active elastomeric liquid crystal particles with initial cylindrical shapes\nare obtained by means of soft lithography and polymerization in a strong\nmagnetic field. Gold nanocrystals infiltrated into these particles mediate\nenergy transfer from laser light to heat, so that the inherent coupling between\nthe temperature-dependent order and shape allows for dynamic morphing of these\nparticles and well-controlled stable shapes. Continuous changes of particle\nshapes are followed by their spontaneous realignment and transformations of\ndirector structures in the surrounding cholesteric host, as well as locomotion\nin the case of a nonreciprocal shape morphing. These findings bridge the fields\nof liquid crystal solids and active colloids, may enable shape-controlled\nself-assembly of adaptive composites and light-driven micromachines, and can be\nunderstood by employing simple symmetry considerations along with electrostatic\nanalogies.\n", "  Characterizing and controlling nonlinear, multi-scale phenomena play\nimportant roles in science and engineering. Cluster-based reduced-order\nmodeling (CROM) was introduced to exploit the underlying low-dimensional\ndynamics of complex systems. CROM builds a data-driven discretization of the\nPerron-Frobenius operator, resulting in a probabilistic model for ensembles of\ntrajectories. A key advantage of CROM is that it embeds nonlinear dynamics in a\nlinear framework, and uncertainty can be managed with data assimilation. CROM\nis typically computed on high-dimensional data, however, access to and\ncomputations on this full-state data limit the online implementation of CROM\nfor prediction and control. Here, we address this key challenge by identifying\na small subset of critical measurements to learn an efficient CROM, referred to\nas sparsity-enabled CROM. In particular, we leverage compressive measurements\nto faithfully embed the cluster geometry and preserve the probabilistic\ndynamics. Further, we show how to identify fewer optimized sensor locations\ntailored to a specific problem that outperform random measurements. Both of\nthese sparsity-enabled sensing strategies significantly reduce the burden of\ndata acquisition and processing for low-latency in-time estimation and control.\nWe illustrate this unsupervised learning approach on three different\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems from fluids with increasing\ncomplexity, with one application in flow control. Sparsity-enabled CROM is a\ncritical facilitator for real-time implementation on high-dimensional systems\nwhere full-state information may be inaccessible.\n", "  Two dimensional systems offer a unique platform to study light matter\ninteraction at the nanoscale. In this work we report on robust quantum emitters\nfabricated by thermal oxidation of tungsten disulphide multilayers. The\nemitters show robust, optically stable, linearly polarized luminescence at room\ntemperature, can be modeled using a three level system, and exhibit moderate\nbunching. Overall, our results provide important insights into understanding of\ndefect formation and quantum emitter activation in 2D materials.\n", "  Recently, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and its voltage control\n(VC) was demonstrated for Cr/Fe/MgO (Physical Review Applied 5, 044006 (2016)).\nIn this study, we shed a light on the origin of large voltage-induced\nanisotropy change in Cr/Fe/MgO. Analysis of the chemical structure of Cr/Fe/MgO\nrevealed the existence of Cr atoms in the proximity of the Fe/MgO interface,\nwhich can affect both magnetic anisotropy (MA) and its VC. We showed that PMA\nand its VC can be enhanced by controlled Cr doping at the Fe/MgO interface. For\nCr/Fe (5.9 {\\AA})/Cr (0.7 {\\AA})/MgO with an effective PMA of 0.8 MJ/m3, a\nmaximum value of the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect of\n370 fJ/Vm was demonstrated.\n", "  The heated debate on the importance of stellar rotation and age spreads in\nmassive star clusters has just become hotter by throwing stellar variability\ninto the mix.\n", "  We devise a new high order local absorbing boundary condition (ABC) for\nradiating problems and scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves from\nobstacles of arbitrary shape. By introducing an artificial boundary $S$\nenclosing the scatterer, the original unbounded domain $\\Omega$ is decomposed\ninto a bounded computational domain $\\Omega^{-}$ and an exterior unbounded\ndomain $\\Omega^{+}$. Then, we define interface conditions at the artificial\nboundary $S$, from truncated versions of the well-known Wilcox and Karp\nfarfield expansion representations of the exact solution in the exterior region\n$\\Omega^{+}$. As a result, we obtain a new local absorbing boundary condition\n(ABC) for a bounded problem on $\\Omega^{-}$, which effectively accounts for the\noutgoing behavior of the scattered field. Contrary to the low order absorbing\nconditions previously defined, the order of the error induced by this ABC can\neasily match the order of the numerical method in $\\Omega^{-}$. We accomplish\nthis by simply adding as many terms as needed to the truncated farfield\nexpansions of Wilcox or Karp. The convergence of these expansions guarantees\nthat the order of approximation of the new ABC can be increased arbitrarily\nwithout having to enlarge the radius of the artificial boundary. We include\nnumerical results in two and three dimensions which demonstrate the improved\naccuracy and simplicity of this new formulation when compared to other\nabsorbing boundary conditions.\n", "  According to CACTus catalog, during periods of a high solar activity every\nday up to tens of coronal mass ejections are observed. Such ejections have an\nimpact on the flux of cosmic rays that permeate the space around us. Unlike\nmost ground cosmic ray detectors, muon hodoscope URAGAN (MEPhI) allows to\ninvestigate not only the integrated counting rate of registered particles, but\nalso the spatial and angular characteristics of the muon flux at ground level.\nThis approach to particle detection allows fixing changes in the flux of cosmic\nrays not only for geoeffective CMEs, but also for the ejections, the front of\nwhich is directed to the opposite side of the Sun. The results of the study of\ndifferent types of CMEs at different stages of the solar activity from 2008 to\n2015 are presented.\n", "  Considering the complex reflection amplitude R=|R|exp(i{\\theta}) of a light\nwave, real delay time {\\tau}_r (i.e., sojourn or Wigner delay time), which is\nthe energy derivative of the real phase ({\\tau}_r =d{\\theta}/cdk), and complex\ndelay time {\\tau}_i , which is the energy derivative of the reflection\ncoefficient ({\\tau}_i=d{\\theta}_i/cdk, |R|=r^1/2=exp(-{\\theta}_i)), have the\nsame statistical form and a mirror image with a shift in time in weak disorder\nand short length regime. Real delay time statistics obtained from the\nreflection coefficient can be attributed to the strong correlation between the\nreflection coefficient and its phase in this regime.\n", "  We develop the heat kernel method in the context of finite temperature\nquantum field theory. We compute the heat kernel expansion in the presence of\ngeneral gauge and scalar fields which may be non Abelian and non stationary.\nThe Polyakov loop appears at finite temperature as a new gauge covariant\noperator. We apply this method in the computation of the fully gauge invariant\neffective action of QCD in the regime of high temperature. It is obtained the\ndimensionally reduced effective action of QCD as well. In the context of chiral\nquark models, in particular the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and the spectral quark\nmodel, we apply this method to compute the low-energy chiral Lagrangian at\nfinite temperature. The coupling of the Polyakov loop with these models allows\nto solve some inconsistencies appearing in the standard treatment at finite\ntemperature: generation of multi-quark states, large $N_c$ counting, etc. On\nthe other hand, we show that recent available lattice data for the renormalized\nPolyakov loop above the deconfinement phase transition exhibit unequivocal\ninverse power temperature corrections driven by a dimension 2 gluon condensate.\nThis simple ansatz provides a good overall description of the data throughout\nthe deconfinement phase until near the critical temperature with just two\nparameters. Finally, we study several chiral quark models in the light of\nchiral perturbation theory in curved space-time. The low energy structure of\nthe energy momentum tensor in these models with SU(3) flavor symmetry is\nanalyzed in the presence of external gravitational fields.\n", "  A lattice model with soft repulsion followed by attraction is developed for a\nmonolayer of hybrid core-shell particles self-assembling at an interface. The\nmodel is solved exactly in one dimension. One, two or three periodic structures\nand variety of shapes of the pressure-density isotherms may occur in different\nversions of the model. For strong interactions the isotherm consists of\nvertical segments separated by plateaus. The range of order depends strongly on\nthe strength of attraction and on the density. Our results agree with\nexperimental observations.\n", "  I had the marvelous good fortune to be Ken Wilson's graduate student at the\nPhysics Department, Cornell University, from 1972 to 1976. In this article, I\npresent some recollections of how this came about, my interactions with Ken,\nand Cornell during this period; and acknowledge my debt to Ken, and to John\nWilkins and Michael Fisher, who I was privileged to have as my main mentors at\nCornell. I end with some thoughts on the challenges of reforming education, a\nsubject that was one of Ken's major preoccupations in the second half of his\nprofessional life.\n", "  This article explains phase noise, jitter, and some slower phenomena in\ndigital integrated circuits, focusing on high-demanding, noise-critical\napplications. We introduce the concept of phase type and time type phase noise.\nThe rules for scaling the noise with frequency are chiefly determined by the\nspectral properties of these two basic types, by the aliasing phenomenon, and\nby the input and output circuits. Then, we discuss the parameter extraction\nfrom experimental data and we report on the measured phase noise in some\nselected devices of different node size and complexity. We observed flicker\nnoise between -80 and -130 dBrad^2/Hz at 1 Hz offset, and white noise down to\n-165 dBrad^2/Hz in some fortunate cases and using the appropriate tricks. It\nturns out that flicker noise is proportional to the reciprocal of the volume of\nthe transistor. This unpleasant conclusion is supported by a gedanken\nexperiment. Further experiments provide understanding on: (i) the interplay\nbetween noise sources in the internal PLL, often present in FPGAs; (ii) the\nchattering phenomenon, which consists in multiple bouncing at transitions; and\n(iii) thermal time constants, and their effect on phase wander and on the Allan\nvariance.\n", "  Thunderstorms produce strong electric fields over regions on the order of\nkilometer. The corresponding electric potential differences are on the order of\n100 MV. Secondary cosmic rays reaching these regions may be significantly\naccelerated and even amplified in relativistic runaway avalanche processes.\nThese phenomena lead to enhancements of the high-energy background radiation\nobserved by detectors on the ground and on board aircraft. Moreover, intense\nsubmillisecond gamma-ray bursts named terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs)\nproduced in thunderstorms are detected from low Earth orbit satellites. When\npassing through the atmosphere, these gamma-rays are recognized to produce\nsecondary relativistic electrons and positrons rapidly trapped in the\ngeomagnetic field and injected into the near-Earth space environment. In the\npresent work, we attempt to give an overview of the current state of research\non high-energy phenomena associated with thunderstorms.\n", "  We report the results of a study of the dynamics of a two-state system\ncoupled to an environment with peaked spectral density. An exact analytical\nexpression for the bath correlation function is obtained. Validity range of\nvarious approximations to the correlation function for calculating the\npopulation difference of the system are discussed as function of tunneling\nsplitting, oscillator frequency, coupling constant, damping rate and the\ntemperature of the bath. An exact expression for the population difference for\na limited range of parameters, is derived.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the stability of the flat FLRW metric in $f(T)$\ngravity. This is achieved by analysing the small perturbations, $\\delta$ about\nthe Hubble parameter and the matter energy density, $\\delta_\\text{m}$. We find\nthat $\\delta \\propto \\dot{H}/H$ and $\\delta_{\\text{m}} \\propto H$. Since the\nHubble parameter depends on the function $f(T)$, two models were considered (A)\nthe power-law model $f(T) = \\alpha (-T)^n$, and (B) the exponential model $f(T)\n= \\alpha T_0 \\left(1 - \\exp \\left[-p \\sqrt{\\dfrac{T}{T_0}}\\right]\\right)$,\nwhere the parameters $n$ and $p$ were chosen to give comparable physical\nresults. For the parameters considered, it was found that the solutions are\nstable with vanishing $\\delta$ and decaying then constant $\\delta_{\\text{m}}$,\nmeaning that the matter perturbations persist during late times.\n", "  This study presents the development of large-area (18 $\\times $ 18 $\\times $\n2 cm$^3$), high refractive index ($n \\sim $1.05) hydrophobic silica aerogel\ntiles for use as Cherenkov radiators. These transparent aerogel tiles will be\ninstalled in a Cherenkov detector for the next-generation accelerator-based\nparticle physics experiment Belle II, to be performed at the High Energy\nAccelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. Cracking has been eliminated\nfrom the prototype aerogel tiles by improving the supercritical carbon dioxide\n(scCO$_2$) extraction procedure when drying the wet gel tiles. Finally, a\nmethod of mass-producing aerogel tiles for the actual detector was established.\nIt was confirmed that the experimentally manufactured aerogel tiles meet the\nrequired optical and hydrophobic characteristics and have a uniform tile\ndensity.\n", "  We have determined new relations between $UBV$ colors and mass-to-light\nratios ($M/L$) for dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, as well as for transformed\n$g^\\prime - r^\\prime$. These $M/L$ to color relations (MLCRs) are based on\nstellar mass density profiles determined for 34 LITTLE THINGS dwarfs from\nspectral energy distribution fitting to multi-wavelength surface photometry in\npassbands from the FUV to the NIR. These relations can be used to determine\nstellar masses in dIrr galaxies for situations where other determinations of\nstellar mass are not possible. Our MLCRs are shallower than comparable MLCRs in\nthe literature determined for spiral galaxies. We divided our dwarf data into\nfour metallicity bins and found indications of a steepening of the MLCR with\nincreased oxygen abundance, perhaps due to more line blanketing occurring at\nhigher metallicity.\n", "  We study the spin vortices and skyrmions coherently imprinted into an\nexciton-polariton condensate on a planar semiconductor microcavity. We\ndemonstrate that the presence of a polarization anisotropy can induce a complex\ndynamics of these structured topologies, leading to the twist of their\ncircuitation on the Poincar\\'e sphere of polarizations. The theoretical\ndescription of the results carries the concept of generalized quantum vortices\nin two-component superfluids, which are conformal with polarization loops\naround an arbitrary axis in the pseudospin space.\n", "  Ghost imaging allows to image an object without directly seeing this object.\nOrigi- nally demonstrated in the spatial domain using classical or\nentangled-photon sources, it was recently shown that ghost imaging can be\ntransposed into the time domain to detect ultrafast signals with high temporal\nresolution. Here, using an incoherent supercontinuum light source whose\nspectral fluctuations are imaged using spectrum- to-time transformation in a\ndispersive fiber, we experimentally demonstrate magnified ghost imaging in the\ntime domain. Our approach is scalable and allows to overcome the resolution\nlimitation of time-domain ghost imaging.\n", "  In Low Background Laboratory at Institute of Physics Belgrade, plastic\nscintillators are used to continuously monitor flux of the muon component of\nsecondary cosmic rays. Measurements are performed on the surface as well as\nunderground (25 m.w.e depth). Temperature effect on muon component of secondary\ncosmic rays is well known and several methods to correct for it are already\ndeveloped and widely used. Here, we apply integral method to calculate\ncorrection coefficients and use GFS (Global Forecast System) model to obtain\natmospheric temperature profiles. Atmospheric corrections reduce variance of\nmuon flux and lead to improved sensitivity to transient cosmic ray variations.\nInfluence of corrections on correlation with neutron monitor data is discussed.\n", "  We compute effective equations of the quantum FRW flat universe in the\nradiation dominated era at $\\hbar$ order, described in terms of Ashtekar\nvariables employing a new method for the geometrical formulation of quantum\nmechanics. Additional terms of quantum nature correct the classical equations\nof motion. As a consequence, the initial singularity of the classical model is\nremoved and a Big Bouncing scenario takes its place. We also obtain an\nexpression for the effective action of the model in terms of higher curvature\ninvariants, leading us to corrected Einstein equations for more general\ncontexts.\n", "  In this work we investigate the dynamics of the nonlinear DDE\n(delay-differential equation)\n  x''(t)+x(t-T)+x(t)^3=0\n  where T is the delay. For T=0 this system is conservative and exhibits no\nlimit cycles. For T>0, no matter how small, an infinite number of limit cycles\nexist, their amplitudes going to infinity in the limit as T approaches zero.\n  We investigate this situation in three ways: 1) Harmonic Balance, 2)\nMelnikov's integral, and 3) Adding damping to regularize the singularity.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a scheme in which backward coherent anti-Stokes\nRaman scattering (CARS) is significantly enhanced by using slow light.\nSpecifically, we reduce the group velocity of the Stokes excitation pulse by\nintroducing a coupling laser that causes electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT). When the Stokes pulse has a spatial length shorter than the\nCARS wavelength, the backward CARS emission is significantly enhanced. We also\ninvestigated the possibility of applying this scheme as a CARS lidar with O2 or\nN2 as the EIT medium. We found that if nanosecond laser with large pulse energy\n(>1 J) and a telescope with large aperture (~10 m) are equipped in the lidar\nsystem, a CARS lidar could become much more sensitive than a spontaneous Raman\nlidar.\n", "  We prove a new uniqueness theorem for an inverse scattering problem without\nthe phase information for the 3-D Helmholtz equation. The spatially distributed\ndielectric constant is the subject of the interest in this problem. We consider\nthe case when the modulus of the scattered wave field |u_{sc}| is measured. The\nphase is not measured.\n", "  Evaluating theories in physics used to be easy. Our theories provided very\ndistinct predictions. Experimental accuracy was so small that worrying about\nepistemological problems was not necessary. That is no longer the case. The\nunderdeterminacy problem between string theory and the standard model for\ncurrent possible experimental energies is one example. We need modern inductive\nmethods for this problem, Bayesian methods or the equivalent Solomonoff\ninduction. To illustrate the proper way to work with induction problems I will\nuse the concepts of Solomoff induction to study the status of string theory.\nPrevious attempts have focused on the Bayesian solution. And they run into the\nquestion of why string theory is widely accepted with no data backing it.\nLogically unsupported additions to the Bayesian method were proposed. I will\nshow here that, by studying the problem from the point of view of the\nSolomonoff induction those additions can be understood much better. They are\nnot ways to update probabilities. Instead, they are considerations about the\npriors as well as heuristics to attempt to deal with our finite resources. For\nthe general problem, Solomonoff induction also makes it clear that there is no\ndemarcation problem. Every possible idea can be part of a proper scientific\ntheory. It is just the case that data makes some ideas extremely improbable.\nTheories where that does not happen must not be discarded. Rejecting ideas is\njust wrong.\n", "  Towards the full-fledged quantum computing, what do we need? Obviously, the\nfirst thing we need is a (many-body) quantum system, which is reasonably\nisolated from its environment in order to reduce the unwanted effect of noise,\nand the second might be a good technique to fully control it. Although we would\nalso need a well-designed quantum code for information processing for\nfault-tolerant computation, from a physical point of view, the primary\nrequisites are a system and a full control for it. Designing and fabricating a\ncontrollable quantum system is a hard work in the first place, however, we\nshall focus on the subsequent steps that cannot be skipped and are highly\nnontrivial.\n", "  We provide cross sections and Maxwell rate coefficients for reactive\ncollisions of slow electrons with BeH$^+$ ions on all the eighteen vibrational\nlevels ($X{^{1}\\Sigma^{+}},v_{i}^{+}=0,1,2,\\dots,17$) using a Multichannel\nQuantum Defect Theory (MQDT) - type approach. These data on dissociative\nrecombination, vibrational excitation and vibrational de-excitation are\nrelevant for magnetic confinement fusion edge plasma modelling and\nspectroscopy, in devices with beryllium based main chamber materials, such as\nthe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the Joint\nEuropean Torus (JET). Our results are presented in graphical form and as fitted\nanalytical functions, the parameters of which are organized in tables.\n", "  This volume contains the proceedings of the 13th International Conference on\nQuantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2016), which was held June 6-10, 2016 at the\nUniversity of Strathclyde. QPL is a conference that brings together researchers\nworking on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and\nrelated areas, with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical\ntools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,\nsemantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to the study\nof physical behaviour in general.\n", "  We set up Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) to reproduce the Long Range\nIsing (LRI) models of the Ohmic type in one dimension. The RBM parameters are\ntuned by using the standard machine learning procedure with an additional\nmethod of Configuration with Probability (CwP). The quality of resultant RBM\nare evaluated through the susceptibility with respect to the magnetic external\nfield. We compare the results with those by Block Decimation Renormalization\nGroup (BDRG) method, and our RBM clear the test with satisfactory precision.\n", "  Saturn's geometric magnitude and albedo were determined by Mallama et al.\n(2017, Icarus 282, 19-33). That analysis depended largely on photometric data\nobtained when the ring system interfered with observations of the globe. In\nthis study the magnitude and albedo are re-evaluated based on spectrophotometry\nobtained during a ring-plane crossing (Karkoschka, 1998, Icarus, 133, 134-146).\nA better correction for the illumination phase angle of Saturn's globe is also\nderived and it is applied to the spectroscopy. The resulting values for most of\nthe 12 Johnson-Cousins and Sloan wavelength bands agree reasonably well with\nthose reported by Mallama et al. but some significant differences are noted.\nThe revised albedo value for the Rc band reduces the discrepancy with that\ninferred from the work of Dyudina et al. (2005, ApJ 618, 973-986).\n", "  (2+1) dimensional diffusion equation is considered within the framework of\nequivalence transformations. Generators for the group are obtained and\nadmissible transformations between linear and nonlinear equations are examined.\nIt is shown that transformations between linear and nonlinear equations are\npossible provided that the generators of independent variables depend on the\ndependent variable. Exact solutions for some nonlinear equations are obtained.\nDifferential invariants related to the transformation groups are investigated\nand the results are compared with the direct integration method.\n", "  Derivation of the Lorentz transformation without the use of Einstein's Second\nPostulate is provided along the lines of Ignatowsky, Terletskii, and others.\nThis is a write-up of the lecture first delivered in PHYS 4202 E&M class during\nthe Spring semester of 2014 at the University of Georgia. The main motivation\nfor pursuing this approach was to develop a better understanding of why the\nfaster-than-light neutrino controversy (OPERA experiment, 2011) was much ado\nabout nothing.\n", "  Often a surface sensitive analytical technique in combination with sample\nerosion by inert ion sputtering is used for compositional in-depth analysis of\nsolid state samples. Layer by layer the sample gets eroded and then the\ncomposition of the actual surface is estimated. The elemental detection limits\ncan be increased by spending more time for the measurement in each sputter\ndepth of the profile measurement. But during this time a significant sample\nsurface recontamination with the element under investigation via adsorption\nform the vacuum has to be avoided. Commonly the vacuum quality of an analytical\ninstrument is monitored using the base pressure of the UHV system. This article\npresents a novel method, which improves this crude approach. The\nrecontamination of a sputtered Ti surface by adsorbed residual gas particles\nwas used to monitor the sputter depth profile specific vacuum condition of an\nXPS microprobe Quantum 2000 over a 4 years period. This new method is suitable\nto monitor the condition of every sputter depth profiling instrument.\n", "  Starting with a review of the thermal fluctuations in superconductors, the\nGaussian Effective Potential is shown to be a powerful variational tool for the\nstudy of the breaking of symmetry in gauge theories. A novel re-derivation of\nthe massive expansion for QCD is presented, showing its variational nature and\nits origin from the Gaussian potential that also provides a variational proof\nfor chiral symmetry breaking and dynamical generation of a gluon mass.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to investigate possibility of utilizing a shallow\nunderground laboratory for the study of energy dependent solar modulation\nprocess and to find an optimum detector configuration sensitive to primaries of\nwidest possible energy range for a given site. The laboratory ought to be\nequipped with single muon detectors at ground level and underground as well as\nthe underground detector array for registration of multi-muon events of\ndifferent multiplicities. The response function of these detectors to primary\ncosmic-rays is determined from Monte Carlo simulation of muon generation and\npropagation through the atmosphere and soil, based on Corsika and GEANT4\nsimulation packages. The simulation predictions in terms of flux ratio, lateral\ndistribution, response functions and energy dependencies are tested\nexperimentally and feasibility of proposed setup in Belgrade underground\nlaboratory is discussed.\n", "  A facility based on a next-generation, high-flux D-D neutron generator has\nbeen commissioned and it is now operational at the University of California,\nBerkeley. The current generator design produces near monoenergetic 2.45 MeV\nneutrons at outputs of 10^8 n/s. Calculations provided show that future\nconditioning at higher currents and voltages will allow for a production rate\nover 10^10 n/s. A significant problem encountered was beam-induced electron\nbackstreaming, that needed to be resolved to achieve meaningful beam currents.\nTwo methods of suppressing secondary electrons resulting from the deuterium\nbeam striking the target were tested: the application of static electric and\nmagnetic fields. Computational simulations of both techniques were done using a\nfinite element analysis in COMSOL Multiphysics. Experimental tests verified\nthese simulation results. The most reliable suppression was achieved via the\nimplementation of an electrostatic shroud with a voltage offset of -800 V\nrelative to the target.\n", "  The group IV-VI compound SnSe, with an orthorhombic lattice structure, has\nrecently attracted particular interest due to its unexpectedly low thermal\nconductivity and high power factor, showing great promise for thermoelectric\napplications. SnSe displays intriguing anisotropic properties due to the\npuckered low-symmetry in-plane lattice structure. Low-dimensional materials\nhave potential advantages in improving the efficiency of thermoelectric\nconversion, due to the increased power factor and decreased thermal\nconductivity. A complete study of the optical and electrical anisotropies of\nSnSe nanostructures is a necessary prerequisite in taking advantage of the\nmaterial properties for high performance devices. Here, we synthesize the\nsingle crystal SnSe nanoplates (NPs) by chemical vapor deposition. The angular\ndependence of the polarized Raman spectra of SnSe NPs shows anomalous\nanisotropic light-mater interaction. The angle-resolved charge transport of the\nSnSe NPs expresses a strong anisotropic conductivity behavior. These studies\nelucidate the anisotropic interactions which will be of use for future\nultrathin SnSe in electronic, thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices.\n", "  In this work, we extend the solid harmonics derivation, which was used by\nAckroyd et al to derive the steady-state SP$_N$ equations, to transient\nproblems. The derivation expands the angular flux in ordinary surface harmonics\nbut uses harmonic polynomials to generate additional surface spherical harmonic\nterms to be used in Galerkin projection. The derivation shows the equivalence\nbetween the SP$_N$ and the P$_N$ approximation. Also, we use the line source\nproblem and McClarren's \"box\" problem to demonstrate such equivalence\nnumerically. Both problems were initially proposed for isotropic scattering,\nbut here we add higher-order scattering moments to them. Results show that the\ndifference between the SP$_N$ and P$_N$ scalar flux solution is at the roundoff\nlevel.\n", "  Deep learning is having a profound impact in many fields, especially those\nthat involve some form of image processing. Deep neural networks excel in\nturning an input image into a set of high-level features. On the other hand,\ntomography deals with the inverse problem of recreating an image from a number\nof projections. In plasma diagnostics, tomography aims at reconstructing the\ncross-section of the plasma from radiation measurements. This reconstruction\ncan be computed with neural networks. However, previous attempts have focused\non learning a parametric model of the plasma profile. In this work, we use a\ndeep neural network to produce a full, pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of the\nplasma profile. For this purpose, we use the overview bolometer system at JET,\nand we introduce an up-convolutional network that has been trained and tested\non a large set of sample tomograms. We show that this network is able to\nreproduce existing reconstructions with a high level of accuracy, as measured\nby several metrics.\n", "  We present the study of accessing unpolarized and linearly polarized gluon\nTMDs in J/{\\psi} and {\\Upsilon}(1S) production in unpolarized proton-proton\ncollision at LHC, RHIC and AFTER energies. Non- relativistic QCD based color\noctet model (COM) is used for estimating quarkonium production rates within\ntransverse momentum dependent factorization formalism. A comparison is drawn\nbetween the experimental data and the transverse momentum distribution of\nquarkonium obtained in COM and color evaporation model.\n", "  In many social systems, groups of individuals can find remarkably efficient\nsolutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single\nexpert. The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the\njudgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer.\nA large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the\nliterature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the\nmajority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a\nnovel approach for aggregating judgments - the transmission chain - which has\nnot yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence.\nIn a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective\nsolution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the\ncollective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members.\nWe address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster\ncollective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical\nsimulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the\ntransmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the\nstructure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to\nthose of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we\nrely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary\ndecisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods\nempirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has\nthe best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the\ntransmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those\nthat have cumulative properties.\n", "  Features and applications of quasi-spherical settling accretion onto rotating\nmagnetized neutron stars in high-mass X-ray binaries are discussed. The\nsettling accretion occurs in wind-fed HMXBs when the plasma cooling time is\nlonger than the free-fall time from the gravitational capture radius, which can\ntake place in low-luminosity HMXBs with $L_x\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{36}$ erg/s. We\nbriefly review the implications of the settling accretion, focusing on the SFXT\nphenomenon, which can be related to instability of the quasi-spherical\nconvective shell above the neutron star magnetosphere due to magnetic\nreconnection from fast temporarily magnetized winds from OB-supergiant. If a\nyoung neutron star in a wind-fed HMXB is rapidly rotating, the propeller regime\nin a quasi-spherical hot shell occurs. We show that X-ray spectral and temporal\nproperties of enigmatic $\\gamma$ Cas Be-stars are consistent with failed\nsettling accretion regime onto a propelling neutron star. The subsequent\nevolutionary stage of $\\gamma$ Cas and its analogs should be the X Per-type\nbinaries comprising low-luminosity slowly rotating X-ray pulsars.\n", "  We will demonstrate that the generalized uncertainty principle exists because\nof the derivative expansion in the effective field theories. This is because,\nin the framework of the effective field theories, the minimum measurable length\nscale has to be integrated away to obtain the low energy effective action. We\nwill analyze the deformation of a massive free scalar field theory by the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle, and demonstrate that the minimum measurable\nlength scale corresponds to a second more massive scale in the theory, which\nhas been integrated away. We will also analyze CFT operators dual to this\ndeformed scalar field theory, and observe that scaling of the new CFT operators\nindicates that they are dual to this more massive scale in the theory. We will\nuse holographic renormalization to explicitly calculate the renormalized\nboundary action with counterterms for this scalar field theory deformed by the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle and show that the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple contributes to the matter conformal anomaly.\n", "  We study small-scale and high-frequency turbulent fluctuations in\nthree-dimensional flows under Fourier-mode reduction. The Navier-Stokes\nequations are evolved on a restricted set of modes, obtained as a projection on\na fractal or homogeneous Fourier set. We find a strong sensitivity (reduction)\nof the high-frequency variability of the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations on\nthe degree of mode decimation, similarly to what is already reported for\nEulerian statistics. This is quantified by a tendency towards a quasi-Gaussian\nstatistics, i.e., to a reduction of intermittency, at all scales and\nfrequencies. This can be attributed to a strong depletion of vortex filaments\nand of the vortex stretching mechanism. Nevertheless, we found that Eulerian\nand Lagrangian ensembles are still connected by a dimensional bridge-relation\nwhich is independent of the degree of Fourier-mode decimation.\n", "  The high cost of platinum-based catalysts has hampered the commercialization\nof polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Hence, the electronic\nstructure and oxygen reduction ability of [Ti(IV)Pc]2+, Ti(II)Pc\ntitanyl-phthalocyanines, and their tailored peripheral and axial ligand\ncomplexes were theoretically investigated to determine non-precious cathode\ncatalysts. Our results revealed that the peripherally substituted and\nunsubstituted Ti(II)Pc triplet complexes can spontaneously reduce peroxide. The\nsinglet [Ti(IV)Pc]2+ parent complex has a 6.45 eV barrier. However, fluorine\nsubstitution at peripheral positions reduced the energy barrier up to 0.45 eV.\nIn addition, chlorine substitution has shown spontaneous peroxide reduction as\nin the case of triplets. The high catalytic activity of Ti(II)Pc complexes and\nsinglet chlorine substituted complex is attributed to the optimal charge\ntransfer between dioxygen molecule and the novel catalyst complexes. As a\nresult, Ti(II)Pcs and chlorine substituted singlet complexes are considered as\npotential substitutions for the noble Pt-based catalyst for the PEMFCs.\n", "  We present some recent measurements of rare flavor-changing neutral current B\ndecays, using data collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e-\ncollider at SLAC. First, we search for the rare process B+ -> K+ tau- tau+ and\nwe do not find evidence for signal. The measured branching fraction is\n(1.31+0.66-0.61(stat.)+0.35-0.25(sys.)) x 10-3 with an upper limit, at the 90%\nconfidence level, of B(B+ -> K+ tau+ tau-) < 2.25 x 10-3. We then study the\nlepton forward-backward asymmetry AFB and the longitudinal K* polarization FL\nin the rare decays B -> K* l+ l-, where l+ l- is either e+ e- or mu+ mu-. We\nreport results for both the K*(892)0l+l- and K*(892)+l+l- final states, as well\nas their combination K*l+l-, in five disjoint dilepton mass-squared bins.\nFinally, we measure the time-dependent CP asymmetry in the radiative-penguin\ndecay B0 -> KS0 pi- pi+ gamma. The Kpipi resonant structure is extracted by an\namplitude analysis of the m_Kpipi and m_Kpi spectra in B+ -> K+ pi- pi+ gamma\ndecays. We use these results to extract the mixing-induced CP parameters of the\nprocess B0 -> KS rho gamma from the time-dependent analysis of B0 -> KS0 pi+\npi- gamma decays and obtain S = -0.18 pm 0.32(stat.) +0.06 -0.05(syst.).\n", "  Simultaneous Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of stratified\nturbulent air/water flow in a horizontal pipe have been performed using water\ndroplets as tracers in the gas-phase. The use of water droplets as tracers\nensures that the water surface tension remains unaffected and thus allows\nsmall-scale interfacial structures, such as capillary waves to occur naturally.\nExperiments have been conducted in a 31 m long, 100 mm diameter PVC pipe using\nair and water as test fluids. For the purpose of validation of the experimental\nset-up and the suggested seeding technique, single-phase measurements of both\nair and water were compared to each other and to DNS results from literature,\nshowing very good agreement. The two-phase measurements are presented in terms\nof mean- and rms-profiles. These measurements offer a qualitative demonstration\nof the behavior of the interfacial turbulence and its correlation with the\nvarious interfacial flow patterns. The observations made in this paper are in\nagreement with the conclusions drawn from the DNS study of Lakehal et al.\n(2003). The present results may eventually provide a better explanation to many\nimportant phenomena related to the physical characteristics of stratified\ntwo-phase flow such as scalar mixing between phases, and to challenges related\nto its modeling.\n", "  Thermoelectric (TE) measurements have been performed on the workhorses of\ntoday's data storage devices, exhibiting either the giant or the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance effect (GMR and AMR). The temperature-dependent (50-300 K)\nand magnetic field-dependent (up to 1 T) TE power factor (PF) has been\ndetermined for several Co-Ni alloy nanowires with varying Co:Ni ratios as well\nas for Co-Ni/Cu multilayered nanowires with various Cu layer thicknesses, which\nwere all synthesized via a template-assisted electrodeposition process. A\nsystematic investigation of the resistivity, as well as the Seebeck\ncoefficient, is performed for Co-Ni alloy nanowires and Co-Ni/Cu multilayered\nnanowires. At room temperature, measured values of TE PFs up to 3.6 mWK-2m-1\nfor AMR samples and 2.0 mWK-2m-1 for GMR nanowires are obtained. Furthermore,\nthe TE PF is found to increase by up to 13.1 % for AMR Co-Ni alloy nanowires\nand by up to 52 % for GMR Co-Ni/Cu samples in an external applied magnetic\nfield. The magnetic nanowires exhibit TE PFs that are of the same order of\nmagnitude as TE PFs of Bi-Sb-Se-Te based thermoelectric materials and,\nadditionally, give the opportunity to adjust the TE power output to changing\nloads and hotspots through external magnetic fields.\n", "  We analyze the fine-grained connections between the average degree and the\npower-law degree distribution exponent in growing information networks. Our\nstarting observation is a power-law degree distribution with a decreasing\nexponent and increasing average degree as a function of the network size. Our\nexperiments are based on three Twitter at-mention networks and three more from\nthe Koblenz Network Collection. We observe that popular network models cannot\nexplain decreasing power-law degree distribution exponent and increasing\naverage degree at the same time.\n  We propose a model that is the combination of exponential growth, and a\npower-law developing network, in which new \"homophily\" edges are continuously\nadded to nodes proportional to their current homophily degree. Parameters of\nthe average degree growth and the power-law degree distribution exponent\nfunctions depend on the ratio of the network growth exponent parameters.\nSpecifically, we connect the growth of the average degree to the decreasing\nexponent of the power-law degree distribution. Prior to our work, only one of\nthe two cases were handled. Existing models and even their combinations can\nonly reproduce some of our key new observations in growing information\nnetworks.\n", "  Properties of the probability distribution generated by a discrete-time\nquantum walk, such as the number of peaks it contains, depend strongly on the\nchoice of the initial condition. In the present paper we discuss from this\npoint of view the model of the two-dimensional quantum walk analyzed in K.\nWatabe et al., Phys. Rev. A 77, 062331, (2008). We show that the limit density\ncan be altered in such a way that it vanishes on the boundary or some line.\nUsing this result one can suppress certain peaks in the probability\ndistribution. The analysis is simplified considerably by choosing a more\nsuitable basis of the coin space, namely the one formed by the eigenvectors of\nthe coin operator.\n", "  Statistics of orbital parameters of binary stars as well as statistics of\ntheir physical characteristics bear traces of star formation history. However,\nstatistical investigations of binaries are complicated by lacking or incomplete\nobservational data and by a number of observational selection effects.\n  Visual binaries are the most numerous observed binaries, the number of pairs\nexceeds 130000. The most complete list of presently known visual binary stars\nwas compiled by cross-matching objects and combining data of the three largest\ncatalogues of visual binaries. It was supplemented by the data on parallaxes,\nmulticolor photometry, spectral characteristics of the stars of this list taken\nfrom other catalogues. This allowed us to compensate partly for the lack of\nobservational data for these objects. Combined data allowed us to check\nvalidity of observational values and to investigate statistics of the orbital\nand physical parameters of visual binaries. Corrections for incompleteness of\nobservational data are discussed. Obtained datasets and modern distributions of\nbinary parameters will be used to reconstruct the initial distributions and\nparameters of the function of star formation for binary systems.\n", "  In this work the effects of coherent radiation (Laser) and incoherent\nradiation (Halogen lamp) during the electrochemical etching process on the\nstructural characteristics of n-type PSi samples were investigated. The\nporosity values were measured by depending on the microstructure analyses and\nGravimetric measurements. Surface morphology, layer thickness, pore diameter,\npore shape, wall thickness and etching rate were studied by depending on\nScanning electron-microscopic (SEM) images\n", "  Quantum diagrams are the best language for Quantum Mechanics since they show\nnot only a final result but also the physical process which leads to the\nresult. The quantum correlation at a distance better known as the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox may be easily understood being depicted in the\ntime-ordered quantum diagrams. In the diagrams one can clearly see what the\nso-called entangled quantum states really are and how they contribute to the\nviolation of Bell inequality. The wave function phase relations that are the\nactual physical \"common cause in the past\" for the observed correlation become\nalso visual and evident. Thus the diagram analysis shows that the phenomenon of\ndistant quantum correlation has simple causal and local explanation and there\nis no need to invent various extravagant constructions contradicting the\nestablished physical principles as well as usual common sense considerations.\n", "  In classical mechanics, a light particle bound by a strong elastic force just\noscillates at high frequency in the region allowed by its initial position and\nvelocity. In quantum mechanics, instead, the ground state of the particle\nbecomes completely de-localized in the limit $m \\to 0$. The harmonic oscillator\nthus ceases to be a useful microscopic physical model in the limit $m \\to 0$,\nbut its Feynman path integral has interesting singularities which make it a\nprototype of other systems exhibiting a \"quantum runaway\" from the classical\nconfigurations near the minimum of the action. The probability density of the\ncoherent runaway modes can be obtained as the solution of a Fokker-Planck\nequation associated to the condition $S=S_{min}$. This technique can be applied\nalso to other systems, notably to a dimensional reduction of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action.\n", "  Cylindrical Couette flow is a subject where the main focus has long been on\nthe onset of turbulence or, more precisely, the limit of stability of the\nsimplest laminar flow. The theoretical framework of this paper is a recently\ndeveloped action principle for hydrodynamics. It incorporates Euler-Lagrange\nequations that are in essential agreement with the Navier-Stokes equation, but\napplicable to the general case of a compressible fluid. The variational\nprinciple incorporates the equation of continuity, a canonical structure and a\nconserved Hamiltonian. The density is compressible, characterized by a general\n(non-polar) equation of state, and homogeneous. The onset of instability is\noften accompanied by bubble formation. It is proposed that the limit of\nstability of laminar Couette flow may some times be related to cavitation. In\ncontrast to traditional stability theory we are not looking for mathematical\ninstabilities of a system of differential equations, but instead for the\npossibility that the system is driven to a metastable or unstable\nconfiguration. The application of this idea to cylindrical Couette flow\nreported here turns out to account rather well for the observations. The\nfailure of a famous criterion due to Rayleigh is well known. It is here shown\nthat it may be due to the use of methods that are appropriate only in the case\nthat the equations of motion are derived from an action principle.\n", "  By extending local U(1) gauge symmetry to discontinuous case, we find that\nunder one special discontinuous U(1) gauge transformation the symmetric and\nantisymmetric wave functions can transform into each other in one dimensional\nquantum mechanics. The free spinless fermionic system and bosonic system with\n$\\delta$-type vector gauge potential are proved to be equivalent. The relation\nalso holds in higher space-time dimensions.\n", "  We prove new bounds on the quantum communication complexity of the\ndisjointness and equality problems. For the case of exact and non-deterministic\nprotocols we show that these complexities are all equal to n+1, the previous\nbest lower bound being n/2. We show this by improving a general bound for\nnon-deterministic protocols of de Wolf. We also give an O(sqrt{n}c^{log^*\nn})-qubit bounded-error protocol for disjointness, modifying and improving the\nearlier O(sqrt{n}log n) protocol of Buhrman, Cleve, and Wigderson, and prove an\nOmega(sqrt{n}) lower bound for a large class of protocols that includes the\nBCW-protocol as well as our new protocol.\n", "  Suppose we have n algorithms, quantum or classical, each computing some\nbit-value with bounded error probability. We describe a quantum algorithm that\nuses O(sqrt{n}) repetitions of the base algorithms and with high probability\nfinds the index of a 1-bit among these n bits (if there is such an index). This\nshows that it is not necessary to first significantly reduce the error\nprobability in the base algorithms to O(1/poly(n)) (which would require\nO(sqrt{n}log n) repetitions in total). Our technique is a recursive\ninterleaving of amplitude amplification and error-reduction, and may be of more\ngeneral interest. Essentially, it shows that quantum amplitude amplification\ncan be made to work also with a bounded-error verifier. As a corollary we\nobtain optimal quantum upper bounds of O(sqrt{N}) queries for all\nconstant-depth AND-OR trees on N variables, improving upon earlier upper bounds\nof O(sqrt{N}polylog(N)).\n", "  We study some extensions of Grover's quantum searching algorithm. First, we\ngeneralize the Grover iteration in the light of a concept called amplitude\namplification. Then, we show that the quadratic speedup obtained by the quantum\nsearching algorithm over classical brute force can still be obtained for a\nlarge family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist.\nFinally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum\nalgorithms to perform approximate counting, which can be seen as an amplitude\nestimation process.\n"]}
