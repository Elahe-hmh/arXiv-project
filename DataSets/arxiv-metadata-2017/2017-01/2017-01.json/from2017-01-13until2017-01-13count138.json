Photometric and hydrodynamic conditions are given\nto find the phases of pulsation when the quasi-static atmosphere approximation\n(QSAA) can be applied. The QSAA is generalized to a non-uniformly moving\nspherical atmosphere, and the distance $d$, mass ${\\cal M}$, and atmospheric\nmotion are derived from the laws of mass and momentum conservation. To\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the method, the $UBV(RI)_C$ photometry of SU Dra\nwas used to derive the following parameters: $[M]=-1.60\\pm .10$ dex,\n$E(B-V)=0.015\\pm .010$, $d=663\\pm 67$ pc, ${\\cal M}=(0.68\\pm .03){\\cal\nM}_\\odot$, equilibrium luminosity, $L_{\\rm eq}=45.9\\pm 9.3L_\\odot$, $T_{\\rm\neq}=6813\\pm 20$ K.\n", "  We study the construction of the classical Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)\ncharge and observables for arbitrary reducible gauge theory. Using a special\ncoordinate system in the extended phase space, we obtain an explicit expression\nfor the Koszul-Tate differential operator and show that the BRST charge can be\nfound by a simple iterative method. We also give a formula for the classical\nBRST observables.\n", "  The paper formalizes and extends the idea of local structure approximation\nfor cellular automata originally proposed by Gutowitz et. al. We start with a\nreview of the construction of a probability measure on the set of bi-infinite\nstrings over a finite alphabet of $N$ symbols. We then demonstrate that for a\nshift-invariant probability measure, probabilities of all blocks of length up\nto $k$ can be expressed by $(N-1)N^{k-1}$ linearly independent block\nprobabilities. Two choices of these independent blocks are discussed in detail,\none in which we choose the longest possible blocks (\"long form\") and one in\nwhich we choose the shortest possible blocks (\"short form\"). We then proceed to\nreview the method which allows to approximate probabilities of blocks longer\nthan $k$ by blocks of length $k$ or less. This approximation, known as Bayesian\nextension or Markov measure, is then used to construct approximate orbits of\nshift-invariant probability measures under the action of probabilistic or\ndeterministic cellular automaton. We show that the aforementioned approximate\norbit is completely determined by an $(N-1)N^{k-1}$-dimensional map. When the\nshort form of block probabilities is used, this map takes particularly simple\nform, often revealing important features of a particular cellular automaton.\n", "  Stoquastic Hamiltonians are characterized by the property that their\noff-diagonal matrix elements in the standard product basis are real and\nnon-positive. Many interesting quantum models fall into this class including\nthe Transverse field Ising Model (TIM), the Heisenberg model on bipartite\ngraphs, and the bosonic Hubbard model. Here we consider the problem of\nestimating the ground state energy of a local stoquastic Hamiltonian $H$ with a\npromise that the ground state of $H$ has a non-negligible correlation with some\n`guiding' state that admits a concise classical description. A formalized\nversion of this problem called Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonian is shown to be\ncomplete for the complexity class MA (a probabilistic analogue of NP). To prove\nthis result we employ the Projection Monte Carlo algorithm with a variable\nnumber of walkers. Secondly, we show that the ground state and thermal\nequilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic TIM can be simulated in polynomial\ntime on a classical probabilistic computer. This result is based on the\napproximation algorithm for the classical ferromagnetic Ising model due to\nJerrrum and Sinclair (1993).\n", "  We consider the activated random walk (ARW) model on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, which\nundergoes a transition from an absorbing regime to a regime of sustained\nactivity. In any dimension we prove that the system is in the active regime\nwhen the particle density is less than one, provided that the jump distribution\nis biased and that the sleeping rate is small enough. This answers a question\nfrom Rolla and Sidoravicius (2012) and Dickman, Rolla and Sidoravicius (2010)\nin the case of biased jump distribution. Furthermore, we prove that the\ncritical density depends on the jump distribution.\n", "  The aim of the project is to find the stars nearest to the Sun and to\ncontribute to the completion of the stellar and substellar census of the solar\nneighbourhood. We identified a new late-M dwarf within 5 pc, looking for high\nproper motion sources in the 2MASS-WISE cross-match. We collected astrometric\nand photometric data available from public large-scale surveys. We complemented\nthis information with low-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy\nwith instrumentation on the ESO NTT to confirm the nature of our candidate. We\nalso present a high-quality medium-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectrum covering\nthe 400 to 2500 nm wavelength range. We classify this new neighbour as an\nM7.0$\\pm$0.5 dwarf using spectral templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nand spectral indices. Lithium absorption at 670.8 nm is not detected in the\nX-shooter spectrum, indicating that the M7 dwarf is older than 600 Myr and more\nmassive than 0.06 M$_{\\odot}$. We also derive a trigonometric distance of 4.4\npc, in agreement with the spectroscopic distance estimate, making\n2MASS\\,J154043.42$-$510135.7 the nearest M7 dwarf to the Sun. This\ntrigonometric distance is somewhat closer than the $\\sim$6 pc distance reported\nby the ALLWISE team, who independently identified this object recently. This\ndiscovery represents an increase of 25\\% in the number of M7--M8 dwarfs already\nknown at distances closer than 8\\,pc from our Sun. We derive a density of\n$\\rho$\\,=\\,1.9$\\pm$0.9$\\times$10$^{-3}$\\,pc$^{-3}$ for M7 dwarfs in the 8 pc\nvolume, a value similar to those quoted in the literature. This new ultracool\ndwarf is among the 50 nearest systems to the Sun, demonstrating that our\ncurrent knowledge of the stellar census within the 5 pc sample remains\nincomplete. 2M1540 represents a unique opportunity to search for extrasolar\nplanets around ultracool dwarfs due to its proximity and brightness.\n", "  We present a necessary and sufficient condition for a spinor $\\omega$ to be\nof nullity zero, i.e. such that for any null vector $v$, $v \\omega \\ne 0$. This\ndives deeply in the subtle relations between a spinor $\\omega$ and $\\omega_c$,\nthe (complex) conjugate of $\\omega$ belonging to the same spinor space.\n", "  We study differential cohomology on categories of globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian manifolds. The Lorentzian metric allows us to define a natural\ntransformation whose kernel generalizes Maxwell's equations and fits into a\nrestriction of the fundamental exact sequences of differential cohomology. We\nconsider smooth Pontryagin duals of differential cohomology groups, which are\nsubgroups of the character groups. We prove that these groups fit into smooth\nduals of the fundamental exact sequences of differential cohomology and equip\nthem with a natural presymplectic structure derived from a generalized Maxwell\nLagrangian. The resulting presymplectic Abelian groups are quantized using the\nCCR-functor, which yields a covariant functor from our categories of globally\nhyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds to the category of C*-algebras. We prove that\nthis functor satisfies the causality and time-slice axioms of locally covariant\nquantum field theory, but that it violates the locality axiom. We show that\nthis violation is precisely due to the fact that our functor has topological\nsubfunctors describing the Pontryagin duals of certain singular cohomology\ngroups. As a byproduct, we develop a Fr\\'echet-Lie group structure on\ndifferential cohomology groups.\n", "  We construct a family of subalgebras of the Gerstenhaber algebra of\ndifferential operators. The subalgebras are labeled by subsets of the additive\ngroup ${\\mathbb Z}^n$ that are closed under addition. Each subalgebra is\ninvariant under the Hochschild coboundary operator.\n", "  This article details the computation of the two-point correlators of the\nconvergence, $E$- and $B$-modes of the cosmic shear induced by the weak-lensing\nby large scale structure assuming that the background spacetime is spatially\nhomogeneous and anisotropic. After detailing the perturbation equations and the\ngeneral theory of weak-lensing in an anisotropic universe, it develops a weak\nshear approximation scheme in which one can compute analytically the evolution\nof the Jacobi matrix. It allows one to compute the angular power spectrum of\nthe $E$- and $B$-modes. In the linear regime, the existence of $B$-modes is a\ndirect tracer of a late time anisotropy and their angular power spectrum scales\nas the square of the shear. It is then demonstrated that there must also exist\noff-diagonal correlations between the $E$-modes, $B$-modes and convergence that\nare linear in the geometrical shear and allow one to reconstruct the\neigendirections of expansion. These spectra can be measured in future large\nscale surveys, such as Euclid and SKA, and offer a new tool to test the\nisotropy of the expansion of the universe at low redshift.\n", "  We compute the angular power spectrum of the $B$-modes of the weak-lensing\nshear in a spatially anisotropic spacetime. We find that there must also exist\noff-diagonal correlations between the $E$-modes, $B$-modes, and convergence\nthat allow one to reconstruct the eigendirections of expansion. Focusing on\nfuture surveys such as Euclid and SKA, we show that observations can constrain\nthe geometrical shear in units of the Hubble rate at the percent level, or even\nbetter, offering a new and powerful method to probe our cosmological model.\n", "  Many-body correlations govern a variety of important quantum phenomena such\nas the emergence of superconductivity and magnetism. Understanding quantum\nmany-body systems is thus one of the central goals of modern sciences. Here we\ndemonstrate an experimental approach towards this goal by utilizing an\nultracold Rydberg gas generated with a broadband picosecond laser pulse. We\nfollow the ultrafast evolution of its electronic coherence by time-domain\nRamsey interferometry with attosecond precision. The observed electronic\ncoherence shows an ultrafast oscillation with a period of 1 femtosecond, whose\nphase shift on the attosecond timescale is consistent with many-body\ncorrelations among Rydberg atoms beyond mean-field approximations. This\ncoherent and ultrafast many-body dynamics is actively controlled by tuning the\norbital size and population of the Rydberg state, as well as the mean atomic\ndistance. Our approach will offer a versatile platform to observe and\nmanipulate non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems on the\nultrafast timescale.\n", "  A new construction for gauge invariant functionals in the nonlinear\nhigher-spin theory is proposed. Being supported by differential forms closed by\nvirtue of the higher-spin equations, invariant functionals are associated with\ncentral elements of the higher-spin algebra. In the on-shell $AdS_4$\nhigher-spin theory we identify a four-form conjectured to represent the\ngenerating functional for $3d$ boundary correlators and a two-form argued to\nsupport charges for black hole solutions. Two actions for $3d$ boundary\nconformal higher-spin theory are associated with the two parity-invariant\nhigher-spin models in $AdS_4$. The peculiarity of the spinorial formulation of\nthe on-shell $AdS_3$ higher-spin theory, where the invariant functional is\nsupported by a two-form, is conjectured to be related to the holomorphic\nfactorization at the boundary. The nonlinear part of the star-product function\n$F_*(B(x))$ in the higher-spin equations is argued to lead to divergencies in\nthe boundary limit representing singularities at coinciding boundary space-time\npoints of the factors of $B(x)$, which can be regularized by the point\nsplitting. An interpretation of the RG flow in terms of proposed construction\nis briefly discussed.\n", "  Entanglement is widely considered the cornerstone of quantum information and\nan essential resource for relevant quantum effects, such as quantum\nteleportation, quantum cryptography, or the speed-up of quantum computing, as\nin Shor's algorithm. However, up to now, there is no general characterization\nof entanglement for many-body systems. In this sense, it is encouraging that\nquantum states connected by stochastic local operations assisted with classical\ncommunication (SLOCC), which perform probabilistically the same quantum tasks,\ncan be collected into entanglement classes. Nevertheless, there is an infinite\nnumber of classes for four or more parties that may be gathered, in turn, into\na finite number of entanglement families. Unfortunately, we have not been able\nto relate all classes and families to specific properties or quantum\ninformation tasks, although a few of them have certainly raised experimental\ninterest. Here, we present a novel entanglement classification for quantum\nstates according to their matrix-product-state structure, exemplified for the\nsymmetric subspace. The proposed classification relates entanglement families\nto the interaction length of Hamiltonians, establishing the first connection\nbetween entanglement classification and condensed matter. Additionally, we\nfound a natural nesting property in which the families for $N$ parties carry\nover to the $N+1$ case. We anticipate our proposal to be a starting point for\nthe exploration of the connection between entanglement classification\nproperties and condensed-matter models.\n", "  Parameterless stopping criteria for recursive polynomial expansions to\nconstruct the density matrix in electronic structure calculations are proposed.\nBased on convergence order estimation the new stopping criteria automatically\nand accurately detect when the calculation is dominated by numerical errors and\ncontinued iteration does not improve the result. Difficulties in selecting a\nstopping tolerance and appropriately balancing it in relation to parameters\ncontrolling the numerical accuracy are avoided. Thus, our parameterless\nstopping criteria stands in contrast to the standard approach to stop as soon\nas some error measure goes below a user-defined parameter or tolerance. We\ndemonstrate that the stopping criteria work well both in dense and sparse\nmatrix calculations and in large-scale self-consistent field calculations with\nthe quantum chemistry program Ergo (www.ergoscf.org).\n", "  We formulate the problem of determining the volume of the set of Gaussian\nphysical states in the framework of information geometry. That is, by\nconsidering phase space probability distributions parametrized by the\ncovariances and supplying this resulting statistical manifold with the\nFisher-Rao metric. We then evaluate the volume of classical, quantum and\nquantum entangled states for two-mode systems showing chains of strict\ninclusion.\n", "  We enlarge the classes of inflaton and quintessence fields by generalizing\nthe pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson potential by means of elliptic Jacobian\nfunctions, which are characterized by a parameter $k$. We use such a\ngeneralization to implement an inflationary era and a late acceleration of the\nuniverse. As an inflationary model the Jacobian generalization leads us to a\nnumber of e-foldings and a primordial spectrum of perturbations compatible with\nthe {\\it Planck collaboration} 2015. As a quintessence model, a study of the\nevolution of its equation of state (EoS) and its $w'$--$w$ plane helps us to\nclassify it as a thawing model. This allows us to consider analytical\napproximations for the EoS recently discovered for thawing quintessence. By\nusing JLA Supernovae Ia and Hubble parameter $H(z)$ data sets, we perform an\nobservational analysis of the viability of the model as quintessence.\n", "  A general explanation for postselected weak measurement is given and quantum\ninterference is most important.\n", "  Weather forecasts are typically given in the form of forecast ensembles\nobtained from multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models with varying\ninitial conditions and physics parameterizations. Such ensemble predictions\ntend to be biased and underdispersive and thus require statistical\npostprocessing. In the ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) approach, a\nprobabilistic forecast is given by a single parametric distribution with\nparameters depending on the ensemble members. This article proposes two\nsemi-local methods for estimating the EMOS coefficients where the training data\nfor a specific observation station are augmented with corresponding forecast\ncases from stations with similar characteristics. Similarities between stations\nare determined using either distance functions or clustering based on various\nfeatures of the climatology, forecast errors, ensemble predictions and\nlocations of the observation stations. In a case study on wind speed over\nEurope with forecasts from the Grand Limited Area Model Ensemble Prediction\nSystem, the proposed similarity-based semi-local models show significant\nimprovement in predictive performance compared to standard regional and local\nestimation methods. They further allow for estimating complex models without\nnumerical stability issues and are computationally more efficient than local\nparameter estimation.\n", "  Non-manifest symmetries are an important feature of quantum field theories\n(QFTs), and yet their characteristics are not fully understood. In particular,\nthe construction of the charge operators associated with these symmetries is\nambiguous. In this paper we adopt a rigorous axiomatic approach in order to\naddress this issue. It turns out that charge operators of non-manifest\nsymmetries are not unique, and that although this does not affect their\nproperty as generators of the corresponding symmetry transformations,\nadditional physical input is required in order to determine how they act on\nstates. Applying these results to the examples of spacetime translation and\nLorentz symmetry, it follows that the assumption that the vacuum is the unique\ntranslationally invariant state is sufficient to uniquely define the charges\nassociated with these symmetries. In the case of supersymmetry though there\nexists no such physical requirement, and this therefore implies that the\nsupersymmetric charge, and hence the supersymmetric space of states, is not\nuniquely defined.\n", "  A method is discussed to analyze the dynamics of a dissipative quantum\nsystem. The method hinges upon the definition of an alternative\n(time-dependent) product among the observables of the system. In the long time\nlimit this yields a contracted algebra. This contraction irreversibly affects\nsome of the quantum features of the dissipative system.\n", "  We argue that the Kovtun--Son--Starinets (KSS) lower bound on the viscosity\nto entropy density ratio holds in fluid systems but is violated in solid\nmaterials with a non-zero shear elastic modulus. We construct explicit examples\nof this by applying the standard gauge/gravity duality methods to massive\ngravity and show that the KSS bound is clearly violated in black brane\nsolutions whenever the massive gravity theories are of solid type. We argue\nthat the physical reason for the bound violation relies on the viscoelastic\nnature of the mechanical response in these materials. We speculate on whether\nany real-world materials can violate the bound and discuss a possible\ngeneralization of the bound that involves the ratio of the shear elastic\nmodulus to the pressure.\n", "  Certain tight binding lattices host macroscopically degenerate flat spectral\nbands. Their origin is rooted in local symmetries of the lattice, with\ndestructive interference leading to the existence of compact localized\neigenstates. We study the robustness of this localization to disorder in\ndifferent classes of flat band lattices in one and two dimensions. Depending on\nthe flat band class, the flat band states can either be robust, preserving\ntheir strong localization for weak disorder W, or they are destroyed and\nacquire large localization lengths $\\xi$ that diverge with a variety of\nunconventional exponents $\\nu$, $\\xi \\sim 1/W^{\\nu}$.\n", "  The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a future Higgs factory\nproposed by the Chinese high energy physics community. It will operate at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 240-250 GeV. The CEPC will accumulate an integrated\nluminosity of 5 ab$^{\\rm{-1}}$ in ten years' operation, producing one million\nHiggs bosons via the Higgsstrahlung and vector boson fusion processes. This\nsample allows a percent or even sub-percent level determination of the Higgs\nboson couplings. With GEANT4-based full simulation and dedicated fast\nsimulation tool, we evaluated the statistical precisions of the Higgstrahlung\ncross section $\\sigma_{ZH}$ and the Higgs mass $m_{H}$ measurement at the CEPC\nin the $Z\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ channel. The statistical precision of\n$\\sigma_{ZH}$ ($m_{H}$) measurement could reach 0.97\\% (6.9 MeV) in the\nmodel-independent analysis which uses only the information of Z boson decay.\nFor the standard model Higgs boson, the $m_{H}$ precision could be improved to\n5.4 MeV by including the information of Higgs decays. Impact of the TPC size to\nthese measurements is investigated. In addition, we studied the prospect of\nmeasuring the Higgs boson decaying into invisible final states at the CEPC.\nWith the standard model $ZH$ production rate, the upper limit of ${\\cal\nB}(H\\rightarrow \\rm{inv.})$ could reach 1.2\\% at 95\\% confidence level.\n", "  Superconductivity in two-dimensional compounds is widely concerned, not only\ndue to its application in constructing nano-superconducting devices, but also\nfor the general scientific interests. Very recently, borophene (two-dimensional\nboron sheet) has been successfully grown on the Ag(111) surface, through direct\nevaporation of a pure boron source. The experiment unveiled two types of\nborophene structures, namely $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$. Herein, we employed\ndensity-functional first-principles calculations to investigate the\nelectron-phonon coupling and superconductivity in both structures of borophene.\nThe band structures of $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ borophenes exhibit inherent\nmetallicity. We found electron-phonon coupling constants in the two compounds\nare larger than that in MgB$_2$. The superconducting transition temperatures\nwere determined to be 18.7 K and 24.7 K through McMillian-Allen-Dynes formula.\nThese temperatures are much higher than theoretically predicted 8.1 K and\nexperimentally observed 7.4 K superconductivity in graphene. Our findings will\nenrich the nano-superconducting device applications and boron-related material\nscience.\n", "  The primary source of emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the accretion\ndisk, is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty structure\n(\"the so-called dusty torus\"). The infrared radiation emitted by the dust is\nnothing but a reprocessed fraction of the accretion disk emission, so the ratio\nof the torus to the AGN luminosity ($L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$) should\ncorrespond to the fraction of the sky obscured by dust, i.e. the covering\nfactor. We undertook a critical investigation of the\n$L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ as the dust covering factor proxy. Using\nstate-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we calculated a grid\nof spectral energy distributions (SEDs) emitted by the clumpy two-phase dusty\nstructure. With this grid of SEDs, we studied the relation between\n$L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ and the dust covering factor for different\nparameters of the torus. We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus\nanisotropy makes $L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ underestimate low covering\nfactors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs\n$L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ always underestimates covering factors. Our\nresults provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain\ncorrect covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we\ndemonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN\nfraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the\ndust covering factors show very weak dependence on $L_{\\text{AGN}}$, with\nvalues in the range of $\\approx0.6-0.7$. Our results also suggest a higher\nfraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray\nsurveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population\npredicted by population synthesis models.\n", "  We build a rigorous nonequilibrium thermodynamic description for open\nchemical reaction networks of elementary reactions. Their dynamics is described\nby deterministic rate equations satisfying mass action law. Our most general\nframework considers open networks driven by time-dependent chemostats. The\nenergy and entropy balances are established and a nonequilibrium Gibbs free\nenergy is introduced. The difference between this latter and its equilibrium\nform represents the minimal work done by the chemostats to bring the network in\nits nonequilibrium state. It is minimized in nondriven detailed-balanced\nnetworks (i.e. networks which relax to equilibrium states) and has an\ninteresting information-theoretic interpretation. We further show that the\nentropy production of complex balanced networks (i.e. networks which relax to\nspecial kinds of nonequilibrium steady states) splits into two non-negative\ncontributions. One charaterizing the dissipation of the nonequilibrium steady\nstate and the other the transients due to relaxation and driving. Our theory\nlays the path to study time-dependent energy and information transduction in\nbiochemical networks.\n", "  A cyclotron resonance maser source using low-effective-mass conduction\nelectrons in graphene, if successful, would allow for generation of Far\nInfrared (FIR) and Terahertz (THz) radiation without requiring magnetic fields\nrunning into the tens of Tesla. In order to investigate this possibility, we\nconsider a situation in which electrons are effectively injected via pumping\nfrom the valence band to the conduction band using an infrared (IR) laser\nsource, subsequently gyrate in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the\nplane of the graphene, and give rise to gain for a FIR/THz wave crossing the\nplane of the graphene. The treatment is classical, and includes on equal\nfooting the electron interation with the radiation field and the decay in\nelectron energy due to collisional processes. A set of integral expressions is\nderived by assuming that the non-radiative energy loss processes of the\nelectrons can be adequately represented by a damping force proportional and\nantiparallel to their momentum. Gain is found even though there is no inversion\nof the energy distribution function. Gain can occur for electron damping times\nas short as hundreds of femtoseconds.\n", "  We provide a constructive proof of exponentially localized Wannier functions\nand related Bloch frames in 1- and 2-dimensional time-reversal symmetric (TRS)\ntopological insulators. The construction is formulated in terms of periodic TRS\nfamilies of projectors (corresponding, in applications, to the eigenprojectors\non an arbitrary number of relevant energy bands), and is thus\nmodel-independent. The possibility to enforce also a TRS constraint on the\nframe is investigated. This leads to a topological obstruction in dimension 2,\nrelated to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phases.\n  We review several proposals for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices that distinguish these\ntopological phases, including the ones by Fu--Kane [Phys. Rev. B 74 (2006),\n195312], Prodan [Phys. Rev. B 83 (2011), 235115], Graf--Porta [Commun. Math.\nPhys. 324 (2013), 851] and Fiorenza--Monaco--Panati [Commun. Math. Phys., in\npress]. We show that all these formulations are equivalent. In particular, this\nallows to prove a geometric formula for the the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of\n2-dimensional TRS topological insulators, originally indicated in [Phys. Rev. B\n74 (2006), 195312], which expresses it in terms of the Berry connection and the\nBerry curvature.\n", "  Bialgebroids (resp. Hopf algebroids) are bialgebras (Hopf algebras) over\nnoncommutative rings. Drinfeld twist techniques are particularly useful in the\n(deformation) quantization of Lie algebras as well as underlying module\nalgebras (=quantum spaces). Smash product construction combines these two into\nthe new algebra which, in fact, does not depend on the twist. However, we can\nturn it into bialgebroid in the twist dependent way. Alternatively, one can use\nDrinfeld twist techniques in a category of bialgebroids. We show that both\ntechniques indicated in the title: twisting of a bialgebroid or constructing a\nbialgebroid from the twisted bialgebra give rise to the same result in the case\nof normalized cocycle twist. This can be useful for better description of a\nquantum deformed phase space. We argue that within this bialgebroid framework\none can justify the use of deformed coordinates (i.e. spacetime\nnoncommutativity) which are frequently postulated in order to explain quantum\ngravity effects.\n", "  Analog quantum simulators (AQS) will likely be the first nontrivial\napplication of quantum technology for predictive simulation. However, there\nremain questions regarding the degree of confidence that can be placed in the\nresults of AQS since they do not naturally incorporate error correction.\nSpecifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model\nwill produce predictions that agree with the ideal model in the presence of\ninevitable imperfections? At the same time, there is a widely held expectation\nthat certain quantum simulation questions will be robust to errors and\nperturbations in the underlying hardware. Resolving these two points of view is\na critical step in making the most of this promising technology. In this work\nwe formalize the notion of AQS reliability by determining sensitivity of AQS\noutputs to underlying parameters, and formulate conditions for robust\nsimulation. Our approach naturally reveals the importance of model symmetries\nin dictating the robust properties. To demonstrate the approach, we\ncharacterize the robust features of a variety of quantum many-body models.\n", "  We analyze the congestion data collected by a GPS device company (TomTom) for\nalmost 300 urban areas in the world. Using simple scaling arguments and data\nfitting we show that congestion during peak hours in large cities grows\nessentially as the square root of the population density. This result, at odds\nwith previous publications showing that gasoline consumption decreases with\ndensity, confirms that density is indeed an important determinant of\ncongestion, but also that we need urgently a better theoretical understanding\nof this phenomena. This incomplete view at the urban level leads thus to the\nidea that thinking about density by itself could be very misleading in\ncongestion studies, and that it is probably more useful to focus on the spatial\nredistribution of activities and residences.\n", "  We consider the effects of entanglement in the initial quantum state of\nscalar and tensor fluctuations during inflation. We allow the gauge-invariant\nscalar and tensor fluctuations to be entangled in the initial state and compute\nmodifications to the various cosmological power spectra. We compute the angular\npower spectra ($C_l$'s) for some specific cases of our entangled state and\ndiscuss what signals one might expect to find in CMB data. This entanglement\nalso can break rotational invariance, allowing for the possibility that some of\nthe large scale anomalies in the CMB power spectrum might be explained by this\nmechanism.\n", "  Correlation is a fundamental statistical measure of order in interacting\nquantum systems. In solids, electron correlations govern a diverse array of\nmaterial classes and phenomena such as heavy fermion compounds, Hunds metals,\nhigh-Tc superconductors, and the Kondo effect. Spin-spin correlations, notably\ninvestigated by Kaufman and Onsager in the 1940s 6, are at the foundation of\nnumerous theoretical models but are challenging to measure experimentally.\nReciprocal space methods can map correlations, but at the single atom limit new\nexperimental probes are needed. Here, we determine the correlations between a\nstrongly hybridized spin impurity and its electron bath by varying the coupling\nto a second magnetic impurity in the junction of a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope. Electronic transport through these coupled spins reveals an\nasymmetry in the differential conductance reminiscent of spin-polarized\ntransport in a magnetic field. We show that at zero field, this asymmetry can\nbe controlled by the coupling strength and is directly related to either\nferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations.\n", "  Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are direct-gap\nsemiconductors with strong light-matter and Coulomb interaction. The latter\naccounts for tightly bound excitons, which dominate the optical properties of\nthese technologically promising materials. Besides the optically accessible\nbright excitons, these systems exhibit a variety of dark excitonic states. They\nare not visible in optical spectra, but can strongly influence the coherence\nlifetime and the linewidth of the emission from bright exciton states. In a\nrecent study, an experimental evidence for the existence of such dark states\nhas been demonstrated, as well as their strong impact on the quantum efficiency\nof light emission in TMDs. Here, we reveal the microscopic origin of the\nexcitonic coherence lifetime in two representative TMD materials (WS$_2$ and\nMoSe$_2$) within a joint study combining microscopic theory with optical\nexperiments. We show that the excitonic coherence lifetime is determined by\nphonon-induced intra- and intervalley scattering into dark excitonic states.\nRemarkably, and in accordance with the theoretical prediction, we find an\nefficient exciton relaxation in WS$_2$ through phonon emission at all\ntemperatures.\n", "  Synchronization is central to many complex systems in engineering physics\n(e.g., the power-grid, Josephson junction circuits, and electro-chemical\noscillators) and biology (e.g., neuronal, circadian, and cardiac rhythms).\nDespite these widespread applications---for which proper functionality depends\nsensitively on the extent of synchronization---there remains a lack of\nunderstanding for how systems evolve and adapt to enhance or inhibit\nsynchronization. We study how network modifications affect the synchronization\nproperties of network-coupled dynamical systems that have heterogeneous node\ndynamics (e.g., phase oscillators with non-identical frequencies), which is\noften the case for real-world systems. Our approach relies on a synchrony\nalignment function (SAF) that quantifies the interplay between heterogeneity of\nthe network and of the oscillators and provides an objective measure for a\nsystem's ability to synchronize. We conduct a spectral perturbation analysis of\nthe SAF for structural network modifications including the addition and removal\nof edges, which subsequently ranks the edges according to their importance to\nsynchronization. Based on this analysis, we develop gradient-descent algorithms\nto efficiently solve optimization problems that aim to maximize phase\nsynchronization via network modifications. We support these and other results\nwith numerical experiments.\n", "  We numerically study the finite-size droplet condensation-evaporation\ntransition in two dimensions. We consider and compare two orthogonal\napproaches, namely at fixed temperature and at fixed density, making use of\nparallel multicanonical simulations. The equivalence between Ising model and\nlattice gas allows us to compare to analytical predictions. We recover the\nknown background density (at fixed temperature) and transition temperature (at\nfixed density) in the thermodynamic limit and compare our finite-size\ndeviations to the predicted leading-order finite-size corrections.\n", "  We reaccess the droplet condensation-evaporation transition of a\nthree-dimensional Lennard-Jones system upon a temperature change. With the help\nof parallel multicanonical simulations we obtain precise estimates of the\ntransition temperature and the width of the transition for systems with up to\n2048 particles. This allows us to supplement previous observations of\nfinite-size scaling regimes with a clearer picture also for the case of a\ncontinuous particle model.\n", "  We present a microscopic study on higher excitonic states in transition metal\ndichalcogenides in the presence of disorder. We show that the geometric phase\ncancels the degeneration of 2s and 2p states and that a significant\ndisorder-induced coupling of bright and dark states offers a strategy to\ncircumvent optical selection rules. As a prove, we show a direct fingerprint of\ndark 2p states in absorption spectra of WS$_2$. The predicted softening of\noptical selection rules through exciton-disorder coupling is of general nature\nand therefore applicable to related two-dimensional semiconductors.\n", "  We show that the binary representation of the integers has a role to play in\nmany aspects of Clifford algebras.\n", "  We investigate the determination of a Hamiltonian parameter in a quantum\nsystem undergoing continuous measurement. We demonstrate a computationally\nrapid yet statistically optimal method to estimate an unknown and possibly\ntime-dependent parameter, where we maximize the likelihood of the observed\nstochastic readout. By dealing directly with the raw measurement record rather\nthan the quantum state trajectories, the estimation can be performed while the\ndata is being acquired, permitting continuous tracking of the parameter during\nslow drifts in real time. Furthermore, we incorporate realistic nonidealities,\nsuch as decoherence processes and measurement inefficiency. As an example, we\nfocus on estimating the value of the Rabi frequency of a continuously measured\nqubit, and compare maximum likelihood estimation to a simpler fast Fourier\ntransform. Using this example, we discuss how the quality of the estimation\ndepends on both the strength and duration of the measurement; we also discuss\nthe trade-off between the accuracy of the estimate and the sensitivity to drift\nas the estimation duration is varied.\n", "  We consider a novel mechanism to account for the observed distance-redshift\nrelation. This is done by presenting a toy model for the large-scale matter\ndistribution in a static Universe. Our model mainly concerns particles with\nmasses far below those in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The model is\nfounded on three main assumptions: (1) a mass spectrum dN$_{\\rm i}$/dm$_{\\rm\ni}$ $=$ $\\beta$m$_{\\rm i}^{-\\alpha}$ (where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are both\npositive constants) for low-mass particles with m$_{\\rm i}$ $\\ll$ 10$^{-22}$ eV\n$\\ll$ M$_{\\rm P}$, where M$_{\\rm P}$ is the Planck mass; (2) a particle\nmass-wavelength relation of the form $\\lambda_{\\rm i} =$ $\\hbar$/$\\delta_{\\rm\ni}$m$_{\\rm i}$c, where $\\delta_{\\rm i} =$ $\\eta$m$_{\\rm i}^{\\gamma}$ and $\\eta$\nand $\\gamma$ are both constants; and (3) For such low-mass particles, locality\ncan only be defined on large spatial scales, comparable to or exceeding the\nparticle wavelengths.\n  We use our model to derive the cosmological redshift characteristic of the\nStandard Model of Cosmology, which becomes a gravitational redshift in our\nmodel. We compare the results of our model to empirical data and show that, in\norder to reproduce the sub-linear form of the observed distance-redshift\nrelation, our model requires $\\alpha$ + $\\gamma$ $<$ 0. We further place our\ntoy model in the context of the Friedmann Universe via a superposition of\nEinstein Universes, each with its own scale factor a$_{\\rm i}$. Given the\noverwhelming evidence supporting an expanding Universe, we then address\npossible modifications to our base model that would be required to account for\nthe available empirical constraints, including the addition of some initial\nexpansion. Finally, we consider potentially observable distinctions between the\ncosmological redshift and our proposed mechanism to account for the observed\ndistance-redshift relation.\n", "  We report new IRAM/PdBI, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and VLA observations of the\nultraluminous quasar SDSSJ010013.02+280225.8 (hereafter, J0100+2802) at z=6.3,\nwhich hosts the most massive supermassive black hole (SMBH) of 1.24x10^10 Msun\nknown at z>6. We detect the [C II] 158 $\\mu$m fine structure line and molecular\nCO(6-5) line and continuum emission at 353 GHz, 260 GHz, and 3 GHz from this\nquasar. The CO(2-1) line and the underlying continuum at 32 GHz are also\nmarginally detected. The [C II] and CO detections suggest active star formation\nand highly excited molecular gas in the quasar host galaxy. The redshift\ndetermined with the [C II] and CO lines shows a velocity offset of ~1000 km/s\nfrom that measured with the quasar Mg II line. The CO (2-1) line luminosity\nprovides direct constraint on the molecular gas mass which is about\n(1.0+/-0.3)x10^10 Msun. We estimate the FIR luminosity to be (3.5+/-0.7)x10^12\nLsun, and the UV-to-FIR spectral energy distribution of J0100+2802 is\nconsistent with the templates of the local optically luminous quasars. The\nderived [C II]-to-FIR luminosity ratio of J0100+2802 is 0.0010+/-0.0002, which\nis slightly higher than the values of the most FIR luminous quasars at z~6. We\ninvestigate the constraint on the host galaxy dynamical mass of J0100+2802\nbased on the [C II] line spectrum. It is likely that this ultraluminous quasar\nlies above the local SMBH-galaxy mass relationship, unless we are viewing the\nsystem at a small inclination angle.\n", "  The transverse momentum ($p_T$) and pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) spectra of\ncharged particles produced in proton-proton ($pp$) and lead-lead (Pb-Pb)\ncollisions at the large hadron collider (LHC) are described by a hybrid model.\nIn the model, the $p_T$ spectrum is described by a two-component distribution\nwhich contains an inverse power-law suggested by the QCD (Quantum\nChromodynamic) calculus and an Erlang distribution resulted from a multisource\nthermal model. The $\\eta$ spectrum is described by a Gaussian rapidity ($y$)\ndistribution resulted from the Landau hydrodynamic model and the two-component\n$p_T$ distribution, where the conversion between $y$ and $\\eta$ is accurately\nconsidered. The modelling results are in agreement with the experimental data\nmeasured by the ATLAS Collaboration in $pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Based on the parameter values extracted\nfrom $p_T$ and $\\eta$ or $y$ spectra, the event patterns or particle scatter\nplots in three-dimensional velocity and momentum spaces are obtained.\n", "  Discovery of exotic phases of matter from the topologically non-trivial\nsystems not only makes the research on topological materials more interesting\nbut also enriches our understanding of the fascinating physics of such\nmaterials. Pb$_{0.6}$Sn$_{0.4}$Te was recently shown to be a topological\ncrystalline insulator. Here we show that by forming a mesoscopic point-contact\nusing a normal non-superconducting elemental metal on the surface of\nPb$_{0.6}$Sn$_{0.4}$Te a novel superconducting phase is created locally in a\nconfined region under the point-contact. This happens while the bulk of the\nsample remains to be non-superconducting and the superconducting phase emerges\nas a nano-droplet under the point-contact. The superconducting phase shows a\nhigh transition temperature $T_c$ that varies for different point-contacts and\nfalls in a range between 3.7 K and 6.5 K. Therefore, this Letter presents the\ndiscovery of a new superconducting phase on the surface of a topological\ncrystalline insulator and the discovery is expected to shed light on the\nmechanism of induced superconductivity in topologically non-trivial systems in\ngeneral.\n", "  Reversible part of evolution equations of physical systems is often generated\nby a Poisson bracket. We discuss geometric means of construction of Poisson\nbrackets and their mutual coupling (direct, semidirect and matched-pair\nproducts) as well as projections of Poisson brackets to less detailed Poisson\nbrackets. This way the Hamiltonian coupling between transport of mixtures and\nelectrodynamics is elucidated.\n", "  We study Coulomb interacting electrons confined in polygonal quantum rings.\nWe focus on the interplay of localization at the polygon corners and Coulomb\nrepulsion. Remarkably, the Coulomb repulsion allows the formation of in-gap\nstates, i.e. corner-localized states of electron pairs or clusters shifted to\nenergies that were forbidden for uncoupled electrons, but below the energies of\nside-localized states. We also specify conditions allowing optical excitation\nof those states.\n", "  The polarization of a material and its response to applied electric and\nmagnetic fields are key solid-state properties with a long history in\ninsulators, although a satisfactory theory required new concepts such as\nBerry-phase gauge fields. In metals, quantities such as static polarization and\nmagnetoelectric $\\theta$-term cease to be well-defined. In polar metals there\ncan be analogous dynamical current responses, which we study in a common\ntheoretical framework. We find that current responses to dynamical strain in\npolar metals depend on both the first and second Chern forms, related to\npolarization and magnetoelectricity in insulators, as well as the orbital\nmagnetization on the Fermi surface. We provide realistic estimates that predict\nthat the latter contribution will dominate and investigate the feasibility of\nexperimental detection of this effect.\n", "  The Sandage-Loeb (SL) test is a promising method for probing dark energy\nbecause it measures the redshift drift in the spectra of Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\nof distant quasars, covering the \"redshift desert\" of $2\\lesssim z\\lesssim5$,\nwhich is not covered by existing cosmological observations. Therefore, it could\nprovide an important supplement to current cosmological observations. In this\npaper, we explore the impact of SL test on the precision of cosmological\nconstraints for two typical holographic dark energy models, i.e., the original\nholographic dark energy (HDE) model and the Ricci holographic dark energy (RDE)\nmodel. To avoid data inconsistency, we use the best-fit models based on current\ncombined observational data as the fiducial models to simulate 30 mock SL test\ndata. The results show that SL test can effectively break the existing strong\ndegeneracy between the present-day matter density $\\Omega_{m0}$ and the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ in other cosmological observations. For the considered two\ntypical dark energy models, not only can a 30-year observation of SL test\nimprove the constraint precision of $\\Omega_{m0}$ and $h$ dramatically, but can\nalso enhance the constraint precision of the model parameters $c$ and $\\alpha$\nsignificantly.\n", "  Given a Calabi-Yau manifold and considering the $B$-branes on it as objects\nin the derived category of coherent sheaves, we identify the vertex operators\nfor strings between two branes with elements of the cohomology groups of Ext\nsheaves. We define the correlation functions for these general vertex\noperators. Strings stretching between two coherent sheaves are studied as\nhomological extensions of the corresponding branes. In this context, we relate\nstrings between different pairs of branes when there are maps between these\nbranes. We also interpret some strings with ghost number $k$ as obstructions\nfor lifts or extensions of strings with ghost number $k-1$.\n", "  Previous measurements of heat redistribution efficiency (the ability to\ntransport energy from a planet's highly irradiated dayside to its eternally\ndark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical\nmodels predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency\nand temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b\nspectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.\nUsing the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve\nobservations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6\nmicron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking\nunphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other\nvisits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST\ndata. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would\nneed to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal\nemission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly\nretrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high\naltitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating\n($\\lesssim1$ day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting\nmeasured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current\nSpitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission\nmeasurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O\nabundance ($2.5\\times 10^{-5} - 1.1\\times 10^{-4}$ at 1$\\sigma$ confidence)\nand, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we\nderive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar\n(0.4 -- 1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same\nassumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3 - 1.7$\\times$ solar.\n(Abridged)\n", "  We demonstrate that a purposefully normalised NNLO top pair invariant mass\ndifferential spectrum can have very small theoretical uncertainty and, in\nparticular, a small sensitivity to the top quark mass. Such observable can thus\nbe a very effective bump-hunting tool for resonances decaying to top pair\nevents during LHC Run II and beyond. To illustrate how the approach works, we\nconcentrate on one specific example of current interest, namely, the possible\n750 GeV di-gamma excess resonance Phi. Considering only theoretical\nuncertainties, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish pp -> Phi ->\ntt signals studied in the recent literature [Hespel, Maltoni and Vryonidou,\narXiv:1606.04149] from the pure SM background with very high significance.\nAlternatively, in case of non-observation, a strong upper limit on the decay\nrate Phi -> tt can be placed.\n", "  We compute the logarithmic corrections to black hole (BH) entropy product of\n${\\cal H}^{\\pm}$ \\footnote{ ${\\cal H}^{+}$ and ${\\cal H}^{-}$ denote outer\n(event) horizon and inner (Cauchy) horizons} by using \\emph{Cardy\nprescription}. We particularly apply this formula for \\emph{BTZ BH}. We\nspeculate that the logarithmic corrections to entropy product of ${\\cal\nH}^{\\pm}$ when computed \\emph{via Cardy formula} the product should be neither\n\\emph{mass-independent (universal)} nor be \\emph{quantized}.\n", "  The RMPCDMD software package performs hybrid Molecular Dynamics simulations,\ncoupling Multiparticle Collision Dynamics to model the solvent and Molecular\nDynamics to model suspended colloids, including hydrodynamics, thermal\nfluctuations, and chemically active solvent particles and catalytic colloids.\nThe main usage of RMPCDMD is the simulation of chemically powered nanomotors,\nbut other setups are considered: colloids in the presence of a thermal\ngradients or forced flows. RMPCDMD is developed in Fortran 2008 with OpenMP for\nmultithreaded operation and uses the HDF5-based H5MD file format for storing\ndata. RMPCDMD comes with documentation and a tutorial for the simulation of\nchemically powered nanomotors.\n", "  We use the coupled cluster method (CCM) to study the ground-state properties\nand lowest-lying triplet excited state of the spin-half {\\it XXZ}\nantiferromagnet on the square lattice. The CCM is applied to it to high orders\nof approximation by using an efficient computer code that has been written by\nus and which has been implemented to run on massively parallelized computer\nplatforms. We are able therefore to present precise data for the basic\nquantities of this model over a wide range of values for the anisotropy\nparameter $\\Delta$ in the range $-1 \\leq \\Delta < \\infty$ of interest,\nincluding both the easy-plane $(-1 < \\Delta < 1)$ and easy-axis $(\\Delta > 1)$\nregimes, where $\\Delta \\rightarrow \\infty$ represents the Ising limit. We\npresent results for the ground-state energy, the sublattice magnetization, the\nzero-field transverse magnetic susceptibility, the spin stiffness, and the\ntriplet spin gap. Our results provide a useful yardstick against which other\napproximate methods and/or experimental studies of relevant antiferromagnetic\nsquare-lattice compounds may now compare their own results. We also focus\nparticular attention on the behaviour of these parameters for the easy-axis\nsystem in the vicinity of the isotropic Heisenberg point ($\\Delta = 1$), where\nthe model undergoes a phase transition from a gapped state (for $\\Delta > 1$)\nto a gapless state (for $\\Delta \\leq 1$), and compare our results there with\nthose from spin-wave theory (SWT). Interestingly, the nature of the criticality\nat $\\Delta=1$ for the present model with spins of spin quantum number\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ that is revealed by our CCM results seems to differ\nqualitatively from that predicted by SWT, which becomes exact only for its\nnear-classical large-$s$ counterpart.\n", "  Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological\nsystems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in\nliving cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks\nwhose dynamics are governed by the Chemical Master Equation. Despite its simple\nstructure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for\nmost systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive,\nmaking systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.\nConsequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the\ndevelopment of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article\ngives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of\nstate of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and\nstochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of\nsimulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation\nmethods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion,\nmoment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid\nmethods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and\nremaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of\nthese methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of\ninference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent\nmethods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a\nself-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods\nfor stochastic chemical kinetics.\n", "  The $CP$ violation observables $S$ and $C$ in the decay channel $B^0\n\\!\\rightarrow D^+ D^-$ are determined from a sample of proton-proton collisions\nat center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The observable $S$\ndescribes $CP$ violation in the interference between mixing and the decay\namplitude, and $C$ parametrizes direct $CP$ violation in the decay. The\nfollowing values are obtained from a flavor-tagged, decay-time-dependent\nanalysis: \\begin{align*}\n  S &= -0.54 \\, ^{+0.17}_{-0.16} \\, \\text{(stat)} \\pm 0.05 \\,\n\\text{(syst)}\\,,\\newline\n  C &= \\phantom{-}0.26 \\, ^{+0.18}_{-0.17} \\, \\text{(stat)} \\pm 0.02 \\,\n\\text{(syst)}\\,. \\end{align*} These values provide evidence for $CP$ violation\nat a significance level of 4.0 standard deviations. The phase shift due to\nhigher-order Standard Model corrections is constrained to a small value of\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\Delta\\phi = -0.16\\,^{+0.19}_{-0.21}\\,\\text{rad}\\,. \\end{align*}\n", "  The inspiral of stellar-mass compact objects, like neutron stars or\nstellar-mass black holes, into supermassive black holes provides a wealth of\ninformation about the strong gravitational-field regime via the emission of\ngravitational waves. In order to detect and analyse these signals, accurate\nwaveform templates which include the effects of the compact object's\ngravitational self-force are required. For computational efficiency, adiabatic\ntemplates are often used. These accurately reproduce orbit-averaged\ntrajectories arising from the first-order self-force, but neglect other\neffects, such as transient resonances, where the radial and poloidal\nfundamental frequencies become commensurate. During such resonances the flux of\ngravitational waves can be diminished or enhanced, leading to a shift in the\ncompact object's trajectory and the phase of the waveform. We present an\nevolution scheme for studying the effects of transient resonances and apply\nthis to an astrophysically motivated population. We find that a large\nproportion of systems encounter a low-order resonance in the later stages of\ninspiral; however, the resulting effect on signal-to-noise recovery is small as\na consequence of the low eccentricity of the inspirals. Neglecting the effects\nof transient resonances leads to a loss of 4% of detectable signals.\n", "  We study the eigenvalues of Schr\\\"odinger operators on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with\nrapidly oscillatory potential $V(x) = W(x,x/\\varepsilon)$, where $W(x,y) \\in\nC^\\infty_0(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{T}^2)$ satisfies $\\int_{\\mathbb{T}^2}\nW(x,y) dy =0$. We show that for $\\varepsilon$ small enough, such operators have\na unique negative eigenvalue, that is exponentially close to $0$.\n", "  The observation of a protophobic 16.7 MeV vector boson has been reported by a\n$^8$Be nuclear transition experiment. Such a new particle could mediate between\nthe Standard Model and a dark sector, which includes the dark matter. In this\npaper, we show some simple models of the dark matter which satisfy the thermal\nrelic abundance under the current experimental bounds from the direct and the\nindirect detections. In a model, it is found that an appropriate\nself-scattering cross section to solve the small scale structure puzzles can be\nachieved.\n", "  Presently, deterioration of glass beads is a significant problem in\nconservation and restoration of beaded exhibits in museums. Glass corrosion\naffects nearly all kinds of beads but cloudy blue-green ones are more than\nothers subjected to disastrous destruction. However, physical and chemical\nmechanisms of this phenomenon have not been understood thus far. This article\npresents results of a study of elemental and phase composition of glass of the\nblue-green beads of the 19th century obtained from exhibits kept in Russian\nmuseums. Using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and X-ray\npowder analysis we have detected and investigated Sb-rich microinclusions in\nthe glass matrix of these beads and found them to be micro crystallites of\nKSbSiO$_5$. These crystallites were not detected in other kinds of beads which\nare much less subjected to corrosion than the blue-green ones and deteriorate\nin a different way. We belive that individual precipitates of KSbSiO$_5$ and\nespecially their clusters play a major role in the blue-green bead\ndeterioration giving rise to slow internal corrosion of the bead glass.\n", "  We consider the use of directionality in the search for monoenergetic sub-GeV\nneutrinos arising from the decay of stopped kaons, which can be produced by\ndark matter annihilation in the core of the Sun. When these neutrinos undergo\ncharged-current interactions with a nucleus at a neutrino detector, they often\neject a proton which is highly peaked in the forward direction. The direction\nof this track can be measured at DUNE, allowing one to distinguish signal from\nbackground by comparing on-source and off-source event rates. We find that\ndirectional information can enhance the signal to background ratio by up to a\nfactor of 5.\n", "  We investigate the existence of an optimal interplay between the natural\nfrequencies of a group chaotic oscillators and the topological properties of\nthe network they are embedded in. We identify the conditions for achieving\nphase synchronization in the most effective way, i.e., with the lowest possible\ncoupling strength. Specifically, we show by means of numerical and experimental\nresults that it is possible to define a synchrony alignment function linking\nthe natural frequencies of a set of non-identical phase-coherent chaotic\noscillators with the topology of the Laplacian matrix $L$, the latter\naccounting for the specific organization of the network of interactions between\noscillators. We use the classical R\\\"ossler system to show that the synchrony\nalignment function obtained for phase oscillators can be extended to\nphase-coherent chaotic systems. Finally, we carry out a series of experiments\nwith nonlinear electronic circuits to show the robustness of the theoretical\npredictions despite the intrinsic noise and parameter mismatch of the\nelectronic components.\n", "  Spaceborne gravity gradients are proposed in this paper to provide autonomous\norbit determination capabilities for near Earth satellites. The gravity\ngradients contain useful position information which can be extracted by\nmatching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman\nfilter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of\norbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are\ndiscussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to\ndeal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to\nanalyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights,\nattitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show\nthat the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors.\nDegraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented\nstate filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are used to test the\nalgorithm. Radial and cross-track position errors of less than 100 m have been\nachieved.\n", "  We report on WIMP search results of the XENON100 experiment, combining three\nruns summing up to 477 live days from January 2010 to January 2014. Data from\nthe first two runs were already published. A blind analysis was applied to the\nlast run recorded between April 2013 and January 2014 prior to combining the\nresults. The ultra-low electromagnetic background of the experiment, ~$5 \\times\n10^{-3}$ events/(keV$_{\\mathrm{ee}}\\times$kg$\\times$day) before electronic\nrecoil rejection, together with the increased exposure of 48 kg $\\times$ yr\nimproves the sensitivity. A profile likelihood analysis using an energy range\nof (6.6 - 43.3) keV$_{\\mathrm{nr}}$ sets a limit on the elastic,\nspin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for WIMP masses above 8\nGeV/$c^2$, with a minimum of 1.1 $\\times 10^{-45}$ cm$^2$ at 50 GeV/$c^2$ and\n90% confidence level. We also report updated constraints on the elastic,\nspin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections obtained with the same data. We set\nupper limits on the WIMP-neutron (proton) cross section with a minimum of 2.0\n$\\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ (52$\\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$) at a WIMP mass of 50\nGeV/$c^2$, at 90% confidence level.\n", "  By means of a finite elements technique we solve numerically the dynamics of\nan amorphous solid under deformation in the quasistatic driving limit. We study\nthe noise statistics of the stress-strain signal in the steady state plastic\nflow, focusing on systems with low internal dissipation. We analyze the\ndistributions of avalanche sizes and durations and the density of shear\ntransformations when varying the damping strength. In contrast to avalanches in\nthe overdamped case, dominated by the yielding point universal exponents,\ninertial avalanches are controlled by a non-universal damping dependent\nfeedback mechanism; eventually turning negligible the role of correlations.\nStill, some general properties of avalanches persist and new scaling relations\ncan be proposed.\n", "  There is currently intensive research into creating a large-scale quantum\ncomputer with trapped ions. It is well known that for a linear ion crystal in a\nharmonic potential, the ions near the center are more closely spaced compared\nto the ions near the ends. This is problematic as the number of ions increases.\nHere, we consider a linear ion crystal in an anharmonic potential that is\npurely quartic in position. We find that the ions are more evenly spaced\ncompared to the harmonic case. We develop a variational approach to calculate\nthe properties of the ground state. We also characterize the zigzag transition\nin an anharmonic potential.\n", "  We report on the temperature and field dependence of resistance of\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films over a wide temperature range and in pulsed magnetic\nfields up to 60 T. The epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films were deposited by\nlaser molecular beam epitaxy. High magnetic field magnetoresistance curves were\nfitted by the Brillouin function, which indicated the existence of magnetically\npolarized regions and the underlying hopping mechanism. The unsaturated\nmagnetoconductance was the most striking finding observed in pulsed magnetic\nfields up to 60 T. These observations can deepen the fundamental understanding\nof the colossal magnetoresistance in manganites with strong correlation of\ntransport properties and magnetic ordering.\n", "  ZnGeN2 and other heterovalent ternary semiconductors have important potential\napplications in optoelectronics, but ordering of the cation sublattice, which\ncan affect the band gap, lattice parameters, and phonons, is not yet well\nunderstood. Here the effects of growth and processing conditions on the\nordering of the ZnGeN2 cation sublattice were investigated using x-ray\ndiffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Polycrystalline ZnGeN2 was grown by\nexposing solid Ge to Zn and NH3 vapors at temperatures between 758 degree C and\n914 degree C. Crystallites tended to be rod-shaped, with growth rates higher\nalong the c-axis. The degree of ordering, from disordered, wurtzite-like x-ray\ndiffraction spectra to orthorhombic, with space group Pna21, increased with\nincreasing growth temperature, as evidenced by the appearance of superstructure\npeaks and peak splittings in the diffraction patterns. Annealing disordered,\nlow-temperature-grown ZnGeN2 at 850 degree C resulted in increased cation\nordering. Growth of ZnGeN2 on a liquid Sn-Ge-Zn alloy at 758 degree C showed an\nincrease in the tendency for cation ordering at a lower growth temperature, and\nresulted in hexagonal platelet-shaped crystals. The trends shown here may help\nto guide understanding of the synthesis and characterization of other\nheterovalent ternary nitride semiconductors as well as ZnGeN2.\n", "  Six widely different subthreshold $K^- N$ scattering amplitudes obtained in\nSU(3) chiral-model EFT approaches by fitting to low-energy and threshold data\nare employed in optical-potential studies of kaonic atoms. Phenomenological\nterms representing $K^-$ multinucleon interactions are added to the EFT\ninspired single-nucleon part of the $K^-$-nucleus optical potential in order to\nobtain good fits to kaonic-atom strong-interaction level shifts and widths\nacross the periodic table. Introducing as a further constraint the fractions of\nsingle-nucleon $K^-$ absorption at rest from old bubble-chamber experiments, it\nis found that only two of the models considered here reproduce these absorption\nfractions. Within these two models, the interplay between single-nucleon and\nmultinucleon $K^-$ interactions explains features observed previously with\nfully phenomenological optical potentials. Radial sensitivities of kaonic atom\nobservables are also re-examined, and remarks are made on the role of\n`subthreshold kinematics' in absorption at rest calculations.\n", "  Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) improves resolution by\ndown-modulating high-frequency information of an object to fit within the\npassband of the optical system. Generally, the reconstruction process requires\nprior knowledge of the illumination patterns, which implies a well-calibrated\nand aberration-free system. Here, we propose a new \\textit{algorithmic\nself-calibration} strategy for SIM that does not need to know the exact\npatterns {\\it a priori}, but only their covariance. The algorithm, termed\nPE-SIMS, includes a Pattern-Estimation (PE) step requiring the uniformity of\nthe sum of the illumination patterns and a SIM reconstruction procedure using a\nStatistical prior (SIMS). Additionally, we perform a pixel reassignment process\n(SIMS-PR) to enhance the reconstruction quality. We achieve 2$\\times$ better\nresolution than a conventional widefield microscope, while remaining\ninsensitive to aberration-induced pattern distortion and robust against\nparameter tuning.\n", "  Within the twistorial parametrization of Loop Quantum Gravity we investigate\nthe consequences of choosing a spacelike normal vector in the linear simplicity\nconstraints. The amplitudes for the $SU(2)$ boundary states of Loop Quantum\nGravity, given by most of the current spinfoam models, are constructed in such\na way that even in the bulk only spacelike building blocks occur. Using a\nspacelike normal vector in the linear simplicity constraints allows us to\ndistinguish spacelike from timelike 2-surfaces. We propose in this paper a\nquantum theory that includes both spatial and temporal building blocks and\nhence a more complete picture of quantum spacetime. At the classical level we\nshow how we can describe $T^{\\ast}SU(1,1)$ as a symplectic quotient of\n2-twistor space $\\mathbb{T}^2$ by area matching and simplicity constraints.\nThis provides us with the underlying classical phase space for $SU(1,1)$ spin\nnetworks describing timelike boundaries and their extension into the bulk.\nApplying a Dirac quantization we show that the reduced Hilbert space is spanned\nby $SU(1,1)$ spin networks and hence are able to give a quantum description of\nboth spacelike and timelike faces. We discuss in particular the spectrum of the\narea operator and argue that for spacelike and timelike 2-surfaces it is\ndiscrete.\n", "  We introduce a family of many-body quantum states that describe interacting\nspin one-half hard-core particles with bosonic or fermionic statistics on\narbitrary one- and two-dimensional lattices. The wave functions at lattice\nfilling fraction $\\nu=2/(2m+1)$ are derived from deformations of the\nWess-Zumino-Witten model $\\mathfrak{su}(3)_1$ and are related to the\n$(m+1,m+1,m)$ Halperin fractional quantum Hall states. We derive long-range\nSU(2) invariant parent Hamiltonians for these states which in two dimensions\nare chiral $t$-$J$-$V$ models with additional three-body interaction terms. In\none dimension we obtain a generalisation to open chains of a periodic\ninverse-square $t$-$J$-$V$ model proposed in [Z. N. C. Ha and F. D. M. Haldane,\nPhys. Rev. B $\\mathbf{46}$, 9359 (1992)]. We observe that the gapless\nlow-energy spectrum of this model and its open-boundary generalisation can be\ndescribed by rapidity sets with the same generalised Pauli exclusion principle.\nA two-component compactified free boson conformal field theory is identified\nthat has the same central charge and scaling dimensions as the periodic bosonic\ninverse-square $t$-$J$-$V$ model.\n", "  Magnetic fields in extragalactic space between galaxy clusters may induce\nconversions between photons and axion-like particles (ALPs), thereby shielding\nthe photons from absorption on the extragalactic background light. For TeV\ngamma rays, the oscillation length ($l_{\\rm osc}$) of the photon-ALP system\nbecomes inevitably of the same order as the coherence length of the magnetic\nfield ($l$) and the length over which the field changes significantly\n(transition length $l_{\\rm t}$) due to refraction on background photons. We\nderive exact statistical evolution equations for the mean and variance of the\nphoton and ALP transfer functions in the non-adiabatic regime ($l_{\\rm osc}\n\\sim l \\gg l_{\\rm t}$). We also make analytical predictions for the transfer\nfunctions in the quasi-adiabatic regime ($l_{\\rm osc} \\ll l, l_{\\rm t}$). Our\nresults are important in light of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA),\nand may also be applied to models with non-zero ALP masses.\n", "  Due to their low cost and low power consumption, single-frequency GPS\nreceivers are considered suitable for low-cost space applications such as small\nsatellite missions. Recently, requirements have emerged for real-time accurate\norbit determination at sub-meter level in order to carry out onboard geocoding\nof high-resolution imagery, open-loop operation of altimeters and radio\noccultation. This study proposes an improved real-time kinematic positioning\nmethod for LEO satellites using single-frequency receivers. The C/A code and L1\nphase are combined to eliminate ionospheric effects. The epoch-differenced\ncarrier phase measurements are utilized to acquire receiver position changes\nwhich are further used to smooth the absolute positions. A kinematic Kalman\nfilter is developed to implement kinematic orbit determination. Actual flight\ndata from China small satellite SJ-9A are used to test the navigation\nperformance. Results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional\nkinematic positioning method in terms of accuracy. A 3D position accuracy of\n0.72 m and 0.79 m has been achieved using the predicted portion of IGS\nultra-rapid products and broadcast ephemerides, respectively.\n", "  Direct detection experiments search for the interactions of Dark Matter (DM)\nparticles with nuclei in terrestrial detectors. But if these interactions are\nsufficiently strong, DM particles may scatter in the Earth, affecting their\ndistribution in the lab. We present a new analytic calculation of this\n`Earth-scattering' effect in the regime where DM particles scatter at most once\nbefore reaching the detector. We perform the calculation self-consistently,\ntaking into account not only those particles which are scattered away from the\ndetector, but also those particles which are deflected towards the detector.\nTaking into account a realistic model of the Earth and allowing for a range of\nDM-nucleon interactions, we present the EarthShadow code, which we make\npublicly available, for calculating the DM velocity distribution after\nEarth-scattering. Focusing on low-mass DM, we find that Earth-scattering\nreduces the direct detection rate at certain detector locations while\nincreasing the rate in others. The Earth's rotation induces a daily modulation\nin the rate, which we find to be highly sensitive to the detector latitude and\nto the form of the DM-nucleon interaction. These distinctive signatures would\nallow us to unambiguously detect DM and perhaps even identify its interactions\nin regions of the parameter space within the reach of current and future\nexperiments.\n", "  After more than a decade, direct observation of the odd frequency triplet\npairing state in super- conducting hybrid structures remains elusive. We\npropose an experimentally feasible setup that can unambiguously reveal the zero\nenergy peak due to proximity-induced equal spin superconducting triplet\ncorrelations. We theoretically investigate a two dimensional Josephson junction\nin the diffu- sive regime. The nanostructure consists of a normal metal\nsandwiched between two ferromagnetic layers with spiral magnetization patterns.\nBy applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the junction plane,\nvortices nucleate in the normal metal. The calculated energy and spatially\nresolved density of states, along with the pair potential, reveal that\nremarkably, only triplet Cooper pairs survive in the vortex cores. These\nisolated odd frequency triplet correlations result in well defined zero energy\npeaks in the local density of states that can be identified through tunneling\nspectroscopy experiments. Moreover, the diffusive regime considered here rules\nout the possibility of Andreev bound states in the vortex core as contributors\nto the zero energy peaks.\n", "  Ci\\^ensa\\c{c}\\~ao, an open online repository for hands-on experiments, has\nbeen developed to convince teachers in Latin America that science is best\nexperienced first hand. Permitting students to experiment autonomously in small\ngroups can be a challenging endeavour for educators in these countries. We\nanalyse the reasons that make teachers hesitate to apply hands-on experiments\nin class, and discuss how Ci\\^ensa\\c{c}\\~ao was implemented to overcome these\nobstacles. The resulting student research activities are specifically designed\nto be easily integrated in formal science education at school, to foster\nresearch skills and, most importantly, to let young people get to know science\nas an engaging creative activity.\n  ----------\n  Ciensaci\\'on es un compilado abierto y en l\\'inea de experimentos pr\\'acticos\nque ha sido creado para convencer a los docentes latinoamericanos de que la\nmejor forma de vivir la ciencia es en primera persona. Permitir que los alumnos\nrealicen experimentos de forma aut\\'onoma y en peque\\~nos grupos es una tarea\ndesafiante para los educadores de estos pa\\'ises. Analizamos los motivos por\nlos cuales los docentes se resisten a utilizar experimentos pr\\'acticos en\nclase y debatimos c\\'omo se implement\\'o Ciensaci\\'on para sortear esos\nobst\\'aculos. El resultado fue la creaci\\'on de actividades de investigaci\\'on\npara los alumnos, que pueden integrarse f\\'acilmente a la educaci\\'on\ncient\\'ifica formal de las escuelas, con el objetivo de desarrollar habilidades\ncient\\'ificas y, m\\'as importante a\\'un, para que los j\\'ovenes puedan ver la\nciencia como una actividad creativa e interesante.\n  ----------\n  Ci\\^ensa\\c{c}\\~ao, uma cole\\c{c}\\~ao aberta de experimentos pr\\'aticos, foi\ndesenvolvida para convencer a professores da Am\\'erica Latina que ci\\^encia \\'e\nmelhor entendida quando manuseada.\n", "  We present Spitzer IRAC $3.6-8 \\mu$m and MIPS $24 \\mu$m point-source catalogs\nfor M $31$ and $15$ other mostly large, star forming galaxies at distances\n$\\sim3.5-14$ Mpc including M $51$, M $83$, M $101$ and NGC $6946$. These\ncatalogs contain $\\sim1$ million sources including $\\sim859,000$ in M 31 and\n$\\sim116,000$ in the other galaxies. They were created following the procedures\ndescribed in Khan et al. (2015) through a combination of point spread function\n(PSF) fitting and aperture photometry. These data products constitute a\nresource to improve our understanding of the IR-bright ($3.6-24 \\mu$m)\npoint-source populations in crowded extragalactic stellar fields and to plan\nobservations with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  The 5d-transition metal pyrochlore oxide Cd2Re2O7, which was recently\nsuggested to be a prototype of the spin-orbit-coupled metal [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n115, 026401 (2015)], exhibits an inversion-symmetry breaking (ISB) transition\nat 200 K and a subsequent superconductivity below 1 K at ambient pressure. We\nstudy the crystal structure at high pressures up to 5 GPa by means of\nsynchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. A rich structural phase diagram is\nobtained, which contains at least seven phases and is almost consistent with\nthe electronic phase diagram determined by previous resistivity measurements.\nInterestingly, the ISB transition vanishes at ~4 GPa, where the enhancement of\nthe upper critical field was observed in resistivity. Moreover, it is shown\nthat the point groups at 8 K, probably kept in the superconducting phases,\nsequentially transform into piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and centrosymmetric\nstructures on the application of pressure.\n", "  We used Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) to observe stars in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) selected from the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) Point\nSource Catalog. We concentrate on the dust properties of oxygen-rich evolved\nstars, which show less alumina than Galactic stars. This difference may arise\nfrom the SMC's lower metallicity, but it could be a selection effect: the SMC\nsample includes more stars which are brighter and thus more massive. The\ndistribution of SMC stars along the silicate sequence looks more like that of\nGalactic red supergiants than asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs). While many\nare definitively AGBs, several SMC stars show evidence of hot bottom burning.\nOther sources show mixed chemistry (oxygen-rich and carbon-rich features),\nincluding supergiants with PAH emission. MSX SMC 134 may be the first confirmed\nsilicate/carbon star in the SMC, and MSX SMC 049 is a post-AGB candidate. MSX\nSMC 145, previously a candidate OH/IR star, is actually an AGB star with a\nbackground galaxy at z=0.16 along the same line-of-sight. We consider the\noverall characteristics of all the {\\em MSX} sources, the most infrared-bright\nobjects in the SMC, in light of {\\em Spitzer}'s higher sensitivity and\nresolution, and compare them with the object types expected from the original\nselection criteria. This population represents what will be seen in more\ndistant galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Color-color diagrams\nusing the IRS spectra and JWST mid-infrared filters show how one can separate\nevolved stars from young stellar objects (YSOs) and distinguish among different\nYSO classes.\n", "  The scalar scattering cross section is computed for Schwarzschild-Tangherlini\nblack holes on the brane. The cross sections are computed numerically via the\npartial-wave method. The phase shifts are found numerically and also via the\nBorn approximation. It is shown that spacetimes with more than six dimensions\npresent a finite scattering cross section in all directions.\n", "  For field theories in one time and one space dimensions we propose an\nefficient method to compute the vacuum polarization energy of static field\nconfigurations that do not allow a decomposition into symmetric and\nanti--symmetric channels. The method also applies to scenarios in which the\nmasses of the quantum fluctuations at positive and negative spatial infinity\nare different. As an example we compute the vacuum polarization energy of the\nkink soliton in the $\\phi^6$ model. We link the dependence of this energy on\nthe position of the soliton to the different masses.\n", "  Estimates of galaxy distances based on indicators that are independent of\ncosmological redshift are fundamental to astrophysics. Researchers use them to\nestablish the extragalactic distance scale, to underpin estimates of the Hubble\nconstant, and to study peculiar velocities induced by gravitational attractions\nthat perturb the motions of galaxies with respect to the Hubble flow of\nuniversal expansion. In 2006 the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) began\nmaking available a comprehensive compilation of redshift-independent\nextragalactic distance estimates. A decade later, this compendium of distances\n(NED-D) now contains more than 100,000 individual estimates based on primary\nand secondary indicators, available for more than 28,000 galaxies, and compiled\nfrom over 2,000 references in the refereed astronomical literature. This\narticle describes the methodology, content, and use of NED-D, and addresses\nchallenges to be overcome in compiling such distances. Currently, 75 different\ndistance indicators are in use. We include a figure that facilitates comparison\nof the indicators with significant numbers of estimates in terms of the\nminimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum distances\nspanned. Brief descriptions of the indicators, including examples of their use\nin the database, are given in an Appendix.\n", "  Jet charge characterizes the electric charge distribution inside a jet. In\nthis talk we make the first theoretical study of jet charge in high-energy\nnuclear collisions and calculate numerically the medium alternations of jet\ncharge due to parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma. The parton multiple\nscattering in hot/dense QCD medium is simulated by a modified version of PYQUEN\nMonte Carlo model with 3+1D ideal hydrodynamical evolution of the fireball. Our\npreliminary results show that the averaged jet charge is significant modified\nin A+A collisions relative to that in p+p. The different features of quark jet\ncharge and gluon jet charge in heavy-ion collisions, and the sensitivity of jet\ncharge modifications to flavour dependence of energy loss are observed, which\ncould then be used to discriminate quark and gluon jet as well as their energy\nloss patterns in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We have established a quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg-Ising model on a\nspin-1/2 pyrochlore edge-shared ladder with Heisenberg intra-rung and Ising\ninter-rung interactions as a perspicuous candidate to exhibit magnetization mid\nand zero plateaus, characteristic peaks of magnetic susceptibility, and thermal\nentanglement mid plateau. The model is exactly solvable and thus, all the\nessential properties such as the thermal entanglement and the magnetic\nproperties of the system can be exactly calculated. The calculations are done\nboth through the transfer matrix technique and through the reduced density\nmatrix. The magnetization plateaus are observed at zero and half the saturation\nvalue and the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a clear demonstration of the\nassociated characteristic peaks. The model also displays the mid plateau of the\nthermal entanglement as a function of the external magnetic field at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  Obtaining accurate band structures of correlated solids has been one of the\nmost important and challenging problems in first-principles electronic\nstructure calculation. There have been promising recent active developments of\nwave function theory for condensed matter, but its application to\nband-structure calculation remains computationally expensive. In this Letter,\nwe report the first application of the biorthogonal transcorrelated (BiTC)\nmethod: self-consistent, free from adjustable parameters, and systematically\nimprovable many-body wave function theory, to solid-state calculations with d\nelectrons: wurtzite ZnO. We find that the BiTC band structure better reproduces\nthe experimental values of the gaps between the bands with different characters\nthan several other conventional methods. This study paves the way for reliable\nfirst-principles calculations of the properties of strongly correlated\nmaterials.\n", "  The problem of construction a quantum mechanical evolution for the\nSchrodinger equation with a degenerate Hamiltonian which is a symmetric\noperator that does not have self-adjoint extensions is considered. Self-adjoint\nregularization of the Hamiltonian does not lead to a preserving probability\nlimiting evolution for vectors from the Hilbert space but it is used to\nconstruct a limiting evolution of states on a C*-algebra of compact operators\nand on an abelian subalgebra of operators in the Hilbert space. The limiting\nevolution of the states on the abelian algebra can be presented by the Kraus\ndecomposition with two terms. Both of this terms are corresponded to the\nunitary and shift components of Wold's decomposition of isometric semigroup\ngenerated by the degenerate Hamiltonian. Properties of the limiting evolution\nof the states on the C*-algebras are investigated and it is shown that pure\nstates could evolve into mixed states.\n", "  We present results by the ALPHA collaboration for the $\\Lambda$-parameter in\n3-flavour QCD and the strong coupling constant at the electroweak scale,\n$\\alpha_s(m_Z)$, in terms of hadronic quantities computed on the CLS gauge\nconfigurations. The first part of this proceedings contribution contains a\nreview of published material \\cite{Brida:2016flw,DallaBrida:2016kgh} and yields\nthe $\\Lambda$-parameter in units of a low energy scale, $1/L_{\\rm had}$. We\nthen discuss how to determine this scale in physical units from experimental\ndata for the pion and kaon decay constants. We obtain $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\rm\nMS}}^{(3)} = 332(14)$ MeV which translates to $\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1179(10)(2)$\nusing perturbation theory to match between 3-, 4- and 5-flavour QCD.\n", "  We report the discovery and analysis of the most metal-poor damped\nLyman-alpha (DLA) system currently known, based on observations made with the\nKeck HIRES spectrograph. The metal paucity of this system has only permitted\nthe determination of three element abundances: [C/H] = -3.43 +/- 0.06, [O/H] =\n-3.05 +/- 0.05, and [Si/H] = -3.21 +/- 0.05, as well as an upper limit on the\nabundance of iron: [Fe/H] < -2.81. This DLA is among the most carbon-poor\nenvironment currently known with detectable metals. By comparing the abundance\npattern of this DLA to detailed models of metal-free nucleosynthesis, we find\nthat the chemistry of the gas is consistent with the yields of a 20.5 M_sun\nmetal-free star that ended its life as a core-collapse supernova; the\nabundances we measure are inconsistent with the yields of pair-instability\nsupernovae. Such a tight constraint on the mass of the progenitor Population\nIII star is afforded by the well-determined C/O ratio, which we show depends\nalmost monotonically on the progenitor mass when the kinetic energy of the\nsupernova explosion is E_exp > 1.5x10^51 erg. We find that the DLA presented\nhere has just crossed the critical 'transition discriminant' threshold,\nrendering the DLA gas now suitable for low mass star formation. We also discuss\nthe chemistry of this system in the context of recent models that suggest some\nof the most metal-poor DLAs are the precursors of the 'first galaxies', and are\nthe antecedents of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We present a collection of 450 598 eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems\ndetected in the OGLE fields toward the Galactic bulge. The collection consists\nof binary systems of all types: detached, semi-detached, and contact eclipsing\nbinaries, RS CVn stars, cataclysmic variables, HW Vir binaries, double periodic\nvariables, and even planetary transits. For all stars we provide the I- and\nV-band time-series photometry obtained during the OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and\nOGLE-IV surveys. We discuss methods used to identify binary systems in the OGLE\ndata and present several objects of particular interest.\n", "  We study minimal co-dimension-2 surfaces in the asymptotically flat\nbackground of extremal 3-brane solutions in ten-dimensional type IIB\nsupergravity. A conjectured open-closed string duality combined with the\nRyu-Takayanagi prescription implies that the area of the surfaces we consider\ncould be interpreted as the entanglement entropy of a dual (3+1)-dimensional\nlarge-N, strongly-coupled open string field theory on D3-branes. As the size of\nthe surface is varied we observe a transition from a volume law to an area law\nin agreement with expectations from non-locality in an open string field\ntheory. Some of the specifics of this transition bear a qualitative resemblance\nwith the behaviour of holographic entanglement entropy in non-commutative\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  Metasurfaces are promising tools towards novel designs for flat optics\napplications. As such their quality and tolerance to fabrication imperfections\nneed to be evaluated with specific tools. However, most such tools rely on the\ngeometrical optics approximation and are not straightforwardly applicable to\nmetasurfaces. In this Letter, we introduce and evaluate, for metasurfaces,\nparameters such as the intercept factor and the slope error usually defined for\nsolar concentrators in the realm of ray-optics. After proposing definitions\nvalid in physical optics, we put forward an approach to calculate them. As\nexamples, we design three different concentrators based on three specific unit\ncells and assess them numerically. The concept allows for the comparison of the\nefficiency of the metasurfaces, their sensitivities to fabrication\nimperfections and will be critical for practical systems.\n", "  In this work we review a class of deterministic nonlinear models for the\npropagation of infectious diseases over contact networks with\nstrongly-connected topologies. We consider network models for\nsusceptible-infected (SI), susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) settings. In each setting, we provide a\ncomprehensive nonlinear analysis of equilibria, stability properties,\nconvergence, monotonicity, positivity, and threshold conditions. For the\nnetwork SI setting, specific contributions include establishing its equilibria,\nstability, and positivity properties. For the network SIS setting, we review a\nwell-known deterministic model, provide novel results on the computation and\ncharacterization of the endemic state (when the system is above the epidemic\nthreshold), and present alternative proofs for some of its properties. Finally,\nfor the network SIR setting, we propose novel results for transient behavior,\nthreshold conditions, stability properties, and asymptotic convergence. These\nresults are analogous to those well-known for the scalar case. In addition, we\nprovide a novel iterative algorithm to compute the asymptotic state of the\nnetwork SIR system.\n", "  We report an accurate measurement of the phase noise of a thermally limited\nelectronic oscillator at 300 K. By thermally limited we mean that the white\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the oscillator is at or near the level generated by\nthe thermal noise of the 50 ohm source resistor. The measurement is devoid of\nthe anti-correlation effect that originates from the common mode power splitter\nin a cross-spectrum technique. The anti-correlation effect is mitigated by\ncooling the power splitter to a liquid helium temperature (4 K). The\nmeasurements in this paper are the first proof of theoretical claims that\nadditive thermal noise from the splitter can be reduced significantly with\ncryogenic cooling and this can eliminate any anti-correlated noise introduced\nby use of the two-channel cross-spectrum technique. We also confirm\nmeasurements of partial anti-correlation error of (-1.3 +/- 0.6) dB that agree\nwith theory when the splitter is at liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K.\n", "  The model of a protoplanetary disk of a star with a low-mass companion\n($M_2:M_1 \\le 0.1$), moving on a circular orbit, which slightly inclined to the\ndisk plane ($\\le 10^{\\circ}$), is considered. The SPH-method is used to\ncalculate gas-dynamic ows. The motion of the companion on the orbit leads to\nthe inhomogeneous distribution of the matter in the disk: there are a cleared\ngap, density waves and streams of matter. Because of the disturbances the inner\npart of the disk is tilted to its periphery and also do not coincides with the\norbit plane of the companion. It leads to anisotropic illumination of the disk\nby the star and, as a consequence, to the appearance of large-scale\ninhomogeneity on the disk image: it has a bright area in the form of a\n\\horseshoe\" and a small shadow zone located asymmetric with respect to the line\nof nodes. The asymmetry of the disk image is clearly visible even if it is\nobserved pole-on. The motion of the companion on the orbit does not lead to the\nsynchronous movement of the shadow and bright areas: they only make small\noscillations relative to the some direction. By using the proposed model we an\nfairly accurately reproduce the asymmetric image of the disk of star\nLkH$\\alpha$ 101, observed almost pole-on. The study of such asymmetric disks\nopens up new opportunity for searching massive bodies around young stars.\n", "  We report on a versatile mini ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber which is\ndesigned to be used on the MAgnetic Reflectometer with high Incident Angle of\nthe J\\\"ulich Centre for Neutron Science at Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in\nGarching, Germany. Samples are prepared in the adjacent thin film laboratory by\nmolecular beam epitaxy and moved into the compact chamber for transfer without\nexposure to ambient air. The chamber is based on DN 40 CF flanges and equipped\nwith sapphire view ports, a small getter pump, and a wobble stick, which serves\nalso as sample holder. Here, we present polarized neutron reflectivity\nmeasurements which have been performed on Co thin films at room temperature in\nUHV and in ambient air in a magnetic field of 200 mT and in the Q-range of 0.18\n\\AA$^{-1}$. The results confirm that the Co film is not contaminated during the\npolarized neutron reflectivity measurement. Herewith it is demonstrated that\nthe mini UHV transport chamber also works as a measurement chamber which opens\nnew possibilities for polarized neutron measurements under UHV conditions.\n", "  We develop a theoretical model to describe the dissipative dynamics of\nsinglet-triplet qubits in GaAs quantum dots. Using the concurrence\nexperimentally obtained [M. D. Shulman et al., Science 336, 202 (2012)] as a\nguide, we found that each logical qubit fluctuates under the action of a random\ntelegraph noise (RTN) that simulates the $1/f^\\alpha$ noise. We also study the\ndynamics of concurrence as a function of the amplitude of the RTN, the\ncorrelation time of the RTN, the preparation time of states, and the two-qubit\ncoupling. Furthermore, we show that the two-qubit coupling together with the\npreparation time strongly affect the entanglement dissipative dynamics and both\nphysical quantities can be employed to enhance the entanglement between\nsinglet-triplet qubits.\n", "  Existing urban boundaries are usually defined by government agencies for\nadministrative, economic, and political purposes. Defining urban boundaries\nthat consider socio-economic relationships and citizen commute patterns is\nimportant for many aspects of urban and regional planning. In this paper, we\ndescribe a method to delineate urban boundaries based upon human interactions\nwith physical space inferred from social media. Specifically, we depicted the\nurban boundaries of Great Britain using a mobility network of Twitter user\nspatial interactions, which was inferred from over 69 million geo-located\ntweets. We define the non-administrative anthropographic boundaries in a\nhierarchical fashion based on different physical movement ranges of users\nderived from the collective mobility patterns of Twitter users in Great\nBritain. The results of strongly connected urban regions in the form of\ncommunities in the network space yield geographically cohesive, non-overlapping\nurban areas, which provide a clear delineation of the non-administrative\nanthropographic urban boundaries of Great Britain. The method was applied to\nboth national (Great Britain) and municipal scales (the London metropolis).\nWhile our results corresponded well with the administrative boundaries, many\nunexpected and interesting boundaries were identified. Importantly, as the\ndepicted urban boundaries exhibited a strong instance of spatial proximity, we\nemployed a gravity model to understand the distance decay effects in shaping\nthe delineated urban boundaries. The model explains how geographical distances\nfound in the mobility patterns affect the interaction intensity among different\nnon-administrative anthropographic urban areas, which provides new insights\ninto human spatial interactions with urban space.\n", "  A Density Functional study predicting a heterogeneous-catalyzed reaction\ngiving rise to biodiesel, was performed. Triacetin was used as a model of\ntriglyceride in the presence of an Au(111) surface as the heterogeneous\ncatalyst substrate. Explicit methoxy molecules were implemented as an alcohol\nsolvent to understand the reaction trajectory along the well known three-step\ntransesterification process. It was found that the reactants and products in\nthe three-step processes are adsorbed to the Au substrate through non-covalent\ninteractions of the electrostatic-type, which are also mediated by a van der\nWaals attraction. The density of states indicate that the electronic structure\nnature of Au is preserved after the interaction with the organic moieties. This\nmay be addressed to an enhanced stability of the Au(111) catalyst through the\noverall reaction. A charge transfer analysis also reveals that the Au surface\noxidation is also responsible for the transesterification of triacetin and\nevidences that molecular gold plays an important role in this catalytic\nprocess. Such results may provide fundamental insights into the design of\nheterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production.\n", "  In a recent paper (MNRAS 458, 4122 (2016)) K. Horne examined the effect of a\nconformally coupled scalar field (referred to as Higgs field) on the\nMannheim-Kazanas metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, i.e. the static spherically symmetric\nmetric within the context of conformal gravity (CG), and studied its effect on\nthe rotation curves of galaxies. He showed that for a Higgs field of the form\n$S(r) = S_0 a/(r + a)$, where $a$ is a radial length scale, the equivalent\nHiggs-frame Mannheim-Kazanas metric $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Omega^2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$,\nwith $\\Omega = S(r)/S_{0}$, lacks the linear $\\gamma r$ term, which has been\nemployed in the fitting of the galactic rotation curves without the need to\ninvoke dark matter. In this brief note we point out that the representation of\nthe Mannheim-Kazanas metric in a gauge where it lacks the linear term has\nalready been presented by others, including Mannheim and Kazanas themselves,\nwithout the need to introduce a conformally coupled Higgs field. Furthermore,\nHorne argues that the absence of the linear term resolves the issue of light\nbending in the wrong direction, i.e. away from the gravitating mass, if $\\gamma\nr > 0$ in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, a condition necessary to resolve the\ngalactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter. In this case we also point out\nthat the elimination of the linear term is not even required because the sign\nof the $\\gamma r$ term in the metric can be easily reversed by a simple gauge\ntransformation, and also that the effects of this term are indeed too small to\nbe observed.\n", "  Free electrons with a helical phase front, referred to as \"twisted\"\nelectrons, possess an orbital angular momentum (OAM) and, hence, a quantized\nmagnetic dipole moment along their propagation direction. This intrinsic\nmagnetic moment can be used to probe material properties. Twisted electrons\nthus have numerous potential applications in materials science. Measuring this\nquantity often relies on a series of projective measurements that subsequently\nchange the OAM carried by the electrons. In this Letter, we propose a\nnondestructive way of measuring an electron beam's OAM through the interaction\nof this associated magnetic dipole with a conductive loop. Such an interaction\nresults in the generation of induced currents within the loop, which are found\nto be directly proportional to the electron's OAM value. Moreover, the electron\nexperiences no OAM variations and only minimal energy losses upon the\nmeasurement, and, hence, the nondestructive nature of the proposed technique.\n", "  We present the carrier transport properties in the vicinity of a\ndoping-driven Mott transition observed at a field-effect transistor (FET)\nchannel using a single crystal of the typical two-dimensional organic Mott\ninsulator $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$CuN(CN)$_2$Cl ($\\kappa$-Cl).The FET shows a\ncontinuous metal$-$insulator transition (MIT) as electrostatic doping proceeds.\nThe phase transition appears to involve two-step crossovers, one in Hall\nmeasurement and the other in conductivity measurement. The crossover in\nconductivity occurs around the conductance quantum $e^2/h$ , and hence is not\nassociated with \"bad metal\" behavior, which is in stark contrast to the MIT in\nhalf-filled organic Mott insulators or that in doped inorganic Mott insulators.\nThrough in-depth scaling analysis of the conductivity, it is found that the\nabove carrier transport properties in the vicinity of the MIT can be described\nby a high-temperature Mott quantum critical crossover, which is theoretically\nargued to be a ubiquitous feature of various types of Mott transitions.

All these\nare made in the background of three-dimensional (3D) general relativity. In\nthis paper, we extend such interpretation into general 3D gravity models. It is\nfound that the direct extension is unfeasible and some extra conditions are\nrequired to preserve both the Smarr formula and the first law of black hole\nthermodynamics. Thus, BTZ black hole thermodynamics enforces some constraints\nfor general 3D gravity models, and these constraints are consistent with all\nprevious discussions.\n", "  Using lattice QCD, we reveal a fundamental connection between centre vortices\nand several key features associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and\nquark confinement. Calculations are performed in pure SU(3) gauge theory using\nthe chiral overlap fermion action. Starting from the original Monte Carlo gauge\nfields, a vortex identification procedure yields vortex-removed and vortex-only\nbackgrounds. We examine the static quark potential, the quark mass function,\nthe hadron spectrum, the local topological charge density, and the distribution\nof instanton-like objects on the original, vortex-removed and vortex-only\nensembles. The removal of vortices consistently results in the removal of the\ncorresponding feature associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.\nRemarkably, we observe that after some smoothing, in each of these cases, the\nvortex-only degrees of freedom are able to encapsulate the pertinent features\nof the original gauge fields.\n", "  This paper proposes a novel multifunctional sensing platform based on\nmultimode planar photonic crystals (PPCs). We analytically and numerically\ndemonstrate that the reflection spectrum of PPCs exhibits multiple high-Q\nresonant modes, and the fundamental and higher-order modes respond\ndistinctively to external mechanical and thermal perturbations, rendering the\nPPCs superior capability for detection and discrimination of multiple\nparameters. We further demonstrate simultaneous pressure and temperature\nsensing with a PPC sensor. Other advantages of PPC sensors include on-chip\nintegration and wafer-scale fabrications.\n", "  The use of eco-friendly materials for the environment has been addressed as a\ncritical issue in the development of systems for renewable energy applications.\nIn this regard, the investigation of organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules for\nthe implementation in solar cells, has become a subject of intense research in\nthe last years. The present work is a systematic study at the B3LYP level of\ntheory performed for a series of 50 OPV materials. Full geometry optimizations\nrevealed that those systems with a twisted geometry are the most energetically\nstable. Nuclear independent Chemical shifts (NICS) values show a strong\naromatic character along the series, indicating a possible polymerization in\nsolid-state, via a {\\pi}-{\\pi} stacking, which may be relevant in the design of\na solar cell device. The absorption spectra in the series was also computed\nusing Time Dependent DFT at the same level of theory, indicating that all\nspectra are red-shifted along the series. This is a promissory property that\nmay be directly implemented in a photovoltaic material, since it is possible to\nabsorb a larger range of visible light. The computed HOMO-LUMO gaps as a\nmeasurement of the band gap in semiconductors, show a reasonable agreement with\nthose found in experiment, predicting candidate materials that may be directly\nused in photovoltaic applications. Non-linear optical (NLO) properties were\nalso estimated with the aid of a PCBM molecule as a model of an acceptor, and a\nfinal set of optimal systems was identified as potential candidates to be\nimplemented as photovoltaic materials. The methodological approach presented in\nthis work may aid in the in silico assisted-design of OPV materials.\n", "  We propose theoretical approach based on combination of graph theory and\ngeneralized Ising model (GIM), which enables systematic determination of\nextremal structures for crystalline solids without any information about\ninteractions or constituent elements. The conventional approach to find such\nset of structure typically employs configurational polyhedra (CP) on\nconfiguration space based on GIM description, whose vertices can always be\ncandidates to exhibit maximum or minimum physical quantities. We demonstrate\nthat the present approach can construct extended CP whose vertices not only\ninclude those found in conventional CP, but also include other topologically\nand/or configurationally characteristic structures on the same dimensional\nconfiguration space with the same set of figures composed of underlying lattice\npoints, which therefore has significant advantage over the conventional\napproach.\n", "  The magnetic properties of iron pnictide superconductors with magnetic\nrare-earth ions under strong magnetic field are investigated based on the\ncluster self-consistent field method. Starting from an effective Heisenberg\nmodel, we present the evolution of magnetic structures on magnetic field in\nRFeAsO (R=Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Tb) and RFe2As2 (R=Eu) compounds. It is found\nthat spin-flop transition occurs in both rare-earth and iron layers under\nmagnetic field, in good agreement with the experimental results. The interplay\nbetween rare-earth and iron spins plays a key role in the magnetic-field-driven\nmagnetic phase transition, which suggests that the rare-earth layers can\nmodulate the magnetic behaviors of iron layers. In addition, the factors that\naffect the critical magnetic field for spin-flop transition are also discussed.\n", "  Based on the luminosity-distance diagram, we propose a method to quickly\nestimate the luminosity function for any certain astrophysical objects. Giving\nthe mean distance between any two objects at a given luminosity range, we can\nfind the relation between the mean distance and the luminosity, and\nconsequently can obtain the luminosity function. Not like the straightforward\ncounting method, this method does not need a complete sample. The only\nrequirement is that the object distributes uniformly in space. We apply this\nmethod to a simulated sample, and find it can produce the luminosity function\nproperly. This method can also be used for energy function.\n", "  We propose a modified expectation-maximization algorithm by introducing the\nconcept of quantum annealing, which we call the deterministic quantum annealing\nexpectation-maximization (DQAEM) algorithm. The expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm is an established algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates\nand applied to many practical applications. However, it is known that EM\nheavily depends on initial values and its estimates are sometimes trapped by\nlocal optima. To solve such a problem, quantum annealing (QA) was proposed as a\nnovel optimization approach motivated by quantum mechanics. By employing QA, we\nthen formulate DQAEM and present a theorem that supports its stability.\nFinally, we demonstrate numerical simulations to confirm its efficiency.\n", "  Social graph construction from various sources has been of interest to\nresearchers due to its application potential and the broad range of technical\nchallenges involved. The World Wide Web provides a huge amount of continuously\nupdated data and information on a wide range of topics created by a variety of\ncontent providers, and makes the study of extracted people networks and their\ntemporal evolution valuable for social as well as computer scientists. In this\npaper we present SocGraph - an extraction and exploration system for social\nrelations from the content of around 2 billion web pages collected by the\nInternet Archive over the 17 years time period between 1996 and 2013. We\ndescribe methods for constructing large social graphs from extracted relations\nand introduce an interface to study their temporal evolution.\n", "  The paper describes the design of band selective excitation and rotation\npulses in high resolution NMR by method of double sweep. We first show the\ndesign of a pulse sequence that produces band selective excitation to the\nequator of Bloch sphere with phase linearly dispersed as frequency. We show how\nthis linear dispersion can then be refocused by nesting free evolution between\ntwo adiabatic inversions (sweeps). We then show how this construction can be\ngeneralized to give a band selective $x$ rotation over desired frequency band.\nExperimental excitation profiles for the residual HDO signal in a sample of\n$99.5\\%$ D$_2$O are obtained as a function of resonance offset.\n", "  We report on specific heat and magnetotransport measurements performed on\nsuperconducting Cu$_{10\\%}$TiSe$_2$ single crystals. We show that\nsuperconductivity persists in transport measurements up to magnetic fields\n$H_R$ well above the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ deduced from the\ncalorimetric measurements. Surprisingly this \"surface\" superconductivity is\npresent for all magnetic field orientations, either parallel or perpendicular\nto the layers. For $H\\|ab$, the temperature dependence of the $H_R/H_{c2}$\nratio can be well reproduced by solving the Ginzburg-Landau equations in\npresence of a surface layer with reduced superconducting properties.\nUnexpectedly this temperature dependence does not depend on the field\norientation.\n", "  The computation of the form factors for the $B_s \\to K \\ell \\nu$ decay is\npresented. The b quark is treated by means of Heavy Quark Effective Theory,\ncurrently in the static approximation. In these proceedings we discuss the\nextraction of the bare matrix elements from lattice data through a combined fit\nto two- and three-point correlation functions, as well as by considering\nsuitable ratios. The different methods agree concerning the extracted form\nfactors and approximately 2% accuracy is reached. The non-perturbative\nrenormalization and matching to QCD is described in accompanying proceedings\nPoS(LATTICE2016)292.\n", "  The pilot system development in metre-scale negative laboratory discharges is\nstudied with ns-fast photography. The systems appear as bipolar structures in\nthe vicinity of the negative high-voltage electrode. They appear as a result of\na single negative streamer propagation and determine further discharge\ndevelopment. Such systems possess features like glowing beads, bipolarity,\ndifferent brightness of the top and bottom parts, and mutual reconnection. A 1D\nmodel of the ionization evolution in the spark gap is proposed. In the process\nof the nonlinear development of ionization growth, the model shows features\nsimilar to those observed. The visual similarities between high-altitude\nsprites and laboratory pilots are striking and may indicate that they are two\nmanifestations of the same natural phenomenon.\n", "  Within a TMD approach we discuss the impact of quasi-real\n(Weizs\\\"acker-Williams) photon contribution to the transverse single-spin\nasymmetry, $A_N$, for the inclusive process $\\ell p^\\uparrow \\to \\pi\\, X$. This\nstudy extends a previous one where only the leading-order contribution was\ntaken into account. Predictions are obtained adopting the Sivers and\ntransversity distributions and the Collins fragmentation functions as extracted\nfrom fits to the azimuthal asymmetries measured in semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering and $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes. The description of\nthe available data is very good, showing a clear general improvement with\nrespect to the previous analysis (already quite promising). This result\nrepresents a further step towards a unified TMD treatment of SSAs in\n$\\ell\\,p^\\uparrow \\to\\ell'\\, h\\, X$ and $\\ell \\,p^\\uparrow \\to h\\, X$\nprocesses.\n", "  With the appearance of superpower laser sources of\nrelativistic/ultrarelativistic intensities in the last decade, the\nlaser-QED-vacuum-matter interaction physics has entered a new phase that makes\nreal the observation of many nonlinear quantum electrodynamic (QED) and\nclassical-quantum- mechanical phenomena revealed more than fore-five decades\nago, serious advance in new generation of laser-plasma accelerators of\nultrahigh energies, nuclear fusion etc. Hence, the present review article will\nhelp explorers-experimentalists in this field to attract attention on the\nfundamental properties and peculiarities of the dynamics of induced free-free\ntransitions at high and superhigh intensities of stimulated radiation fields.\nIn this connection it is of special interest the induced Cherenkov, Compton,\nundulator/wiggler coherent processes, as well as cyclotron resonance in a\nmedium -- possessing with nonlinear resonances of threshold nature and leading\nto many important nonlinear effects or applications, which are considered in\nthis review.\n", "  RZ Psc is an isolated high-latitude post-T Tauri star that demonstrates a UX\nOri-type photometric activity. The star shows very weak spectroscopic\nsignatures of accretion, but at the same time possesses the unusual footprints\nof the wind in Na I D lines. In the present work we investigate new\nspectroscopic observations of RZ Psc obtained in 2014 during two observation\nruns. We found variable blueshifted absorption components (BACs) in lines of\nthe other alcali metals, K I 7699 \\AA\\ and Ca II IR triplet. We also confirmed\nthe presence of a weak emission component in the H$\\alpha$ line, which allowed\nus to estimate the mass accretion rate on the star as $\\dot{M}\\leq$ $7 \\cdot\n10^{-12}$Msun yr$^{-1}$. We could not reveal any clear periodicity in the\nappearance of BACs in sodium lines. Nevertheless, the exact coincidence of the\nstructure and velocities of the Na I D absorptions observed with the interval\nof about one year suggests that such a periodicity should exist.\n", "  The effect of primordial massive gravitational waves on the BB-mode\ncorrelation angular power spectrum of CMB is studied for several inflation\nmodels. The angular power spectrum with the BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck joint\ndata suggests further constraint on the lower and upper bounds on the mass of\nprimordial gravitons\n", "  We investigate the effect of inertia on barrierless electronic reactions in\nsolution by suggesting and examining different probability distribution\nfunctions (PDF) of relevant Brownian functionals associated with the lifetime\nand reactivity of the process. Activationless electronic reaction in solution\ncan be modeled as a free Brownian motion with inertial term in the underdamped\nregime. In this context we suggest several important distribution functions\nthat can characterize the reaction kinetics. Most of the studies on Brownian\nfunctional which has vast potential application in diverse fields, are confined\nin the overdamped regime. To the best of our knowledge, we are attempting first\ntime to incorporate the much important inertial effects on the study of\ndifferent PDFs related with Brownian functionals of an underdamped Brownian\nmotion with time dependent drift and diffusion coefficients using celebrated\nbackward Fokker-Planck and path decomposition methods. We have explored\nnontrivial scaling behaviour of different PDFs and calculated explicitly the\ncritical exponents related with the asymptotic limits in time.\n", "  Bacterial conglomerates such as biofilms and microcolonies are ubiquitous in\nnature and play an important role in industry and medicine. In contrast to\nwell-mixed, diluted cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in\na microcolony interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to\nwhich they are attached. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the role\nof such mechanical interactions on growth and biological evolution of microbial\npopulations. Here we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped\ncells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their\nmotion in the colony, this affects biological evolution. We show that the\nprobability that a faster-growing mutant \"surfs\" at the colony's frontier and\ncreates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape,\nelasticity, friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing\nprobability in seemingly different ways, they all ultimately exhibit their\neffects by altering the roughness of the expanding frontier of the colony and\nthe orientation of cells. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which\nwe measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness.\nOur results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an\nimportant role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these\ninteraction may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of\nantibiotic resistance.\n", "  The multiple colliding laser pulse concept formulated in Ref. [1] is\nbeneficial for achieving an extremely high amplitude of coherent\nelectromagnetic field. Since the topology of electric and magnetic fields\noscillating in time of multiple colliding laser pulses is far from trivial and\nthe radiation friction effects are significant in the high field limit, the\ndynamics of charged particles interacting with the multiple colliding laser\npulses demonstrates remarkable features corresponding to random walk\ntrajectories, limit circles, attractors, regular patterns and Levy flights.\nUnder extremely high intensity conditions the nonlinear dissipation mechanism\nstabilizes the particle motion resulting in the charged particle trajectory\nbeing located within narrow regions and in the occurrence of a new class of\nregular patterns made by the particle ensembles.\n", "  The problem of cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions of Brans-Dicke scalar\nfields has been studied. Exact solutions have been obtained for the vacuum B-D\nfield equations for the cylindrically symmetric Einstein-Rosen metric. The\nsolutions obtained in the present work are generalized solutions of the problem\nwhich has been studied by Rao et al. (Annals of Physics, Vol. 87, 1974).The\nphysical and kinematical behaviors of the solutions relevant to conformal space\nis also discussed in details, these solutions will be beneficial in solving the\nproblems for investigating the different model of our universe.\n", "  The synthesis, physical, photocatalytic, and antibacterial properties of MgO\nand graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanocomposites are reported. The\ncrystallinity, phase, morphology, chemical bonding, and vibrational modes of\nprepared nanomaterials are studied. The conductive nature of GNPs is tailored\nvia photocatalysis and enhanced antibacterial activity. It is interestingly\nobserved that the MgO/GNPs nanocomposite with optimized GNPs content show a\nsignificant photocatalytic activity (97.23% degradation) as compared to bare\nMgO (43%) which makes it the potential photocatalyst for purification of\nindustrial waste water. In addition, the effect of increased amount of GNPs on\nantibacterial performance of nanocomposites against pathogenic micro-organisms\nis researched, suggesting them toxic. MgO/GNPs 25% nanocomposite may have\npotential applications in waste water treatment and nanomedicine due its\nmultifunctionality.\n", "  Detailed information on decay channel probabilities is absent for many high\nmass resonances, which are typically included in thermal models. In these\ncases, the sum over all known decay branching probabilities is smaller than 1.\nDue to this systematic uncertainty of the model, the exact charge conservation\nmay appear to be violated. We estimate the corresponding number of missing\ncharge states in the canonical ensemble formulation of the hadron resonance gas\nfor p+p reactions at the SPS energy $E_{\\rm lab}=158$ GeV: $\\Delta B \\simeq\n0.16$ for baryon charge, $\\Delta Q\\simeq 0.12$ for electric charge, and $\\Delta\nS=-0.01$ for strangeness. The value of the considered effect is 5-8%, which\nseems to be important enough to include it as a systematic error in the\ncalculations within a hadron gas.\n", "  This study proposes a multi-field asymptotic homogenization for the analysis\nof thermo-piezoelectric materials with periodic microstructures. The effect of\nthe microstructural heterogeneity is taken into account by means of periodic\nperturbation functions, which derive from the solution of non homogeneous\nrecursive cell problems defined over the unit periodic cell. A strong coupling\nis present between the micro displacement field and the micro electric\npotential field, since the mechanical and the electric problems are fully\ncoupled in the asymptotically expanded microscale field equations. The micro\ndisplacement, the electric potential, and the relative temperature fields have\nbeen related to the macroscopic quantities and to their gradients in the\nderived down-scaling relations. Average field equations of infinite order have\nbeen obtained and the closed form of the overall constitutive tensors has been\ndetermined for the equivalent first-order homogenized continuum. A formal\nsolution of such equations has been derived by means of an asymptotic expansion\nof the macro fields. The accuracy of the proposed formulation is assessed in\nrelation to illustrative examples of a bi-material periodic microstructure\nsubjected to harmonic body forces, free charge densities, and heat sources,\nwhose periodicity is much greater than the characteristic microstructural size.\nThe good agreement obtained between the solution of the homogenized model and\nthe finite element solution of the original heterogeneous material problem\nconfirms the validity of the proposed formulation.\n", "  We revisit the Massey's method for rating and ranking in sports and\ncontextualize it as a general centrality measure in network science.\n", "  We investigate the transverse profile of the chromoelectric field generated\nby a quark-antiquark pair in the vacuum of (2+1) flavor QCD. Monte Carlo\nsimulations are performed adopting the HISQ/tree action discretization, as\nimplemented in the publicly available MILC code, suitably modified to measure\nthe chromoelectric field. We work on the line of constant physics, with\nphysical strange quark mass $m_s$ and light to strange mass ratio $m_l/m_s =\n1/20$.\n", "  Numerical simulations of the G.O. Roberts dynamo are presented. Dynamos both\nwith and without a significant mean field are obtained. Exact bounds are\nderived for the total energy which conform with the Kolmogorov phenomenology of\nturbulence. Best fits to numerical data show the same functional dependences as\nthe inequalities obtained from optimum theory.\n", "  XUV and X-ray Free Electron Lasers (FELs) produce short wavelength pulses\nwith high intensity, ultrashort duration, well-defined polarization and\ntransverse coherence, and have been utilised for many experiments previously\npossible at long wavelengths only: multiphoton ionization, pumping an atomic\nlaser, and four-wave mixing spectroscopy. However one important optical\ntechnique, coherent control, has not yet been demonstrated, because Self-\nAmplified Spontaneous Emission FELs have limited longitudinal coherence.\nSingle-colour pulses from the FERMI seeded FEL are longitudinally coherent, and\ntwo-colour emission is predicted to be coherent. Here we demonstrate the phase\ncorrelation of two colours, and manipulate it to control an experiment. Light\nof wavelengths 63.0 and 31.5 nm ionized neon, and the asymmetry of the\nphotoelectron angular distribution was controlled by adjusting the phase, with\ntemporal resolution 3 attoseconds. This opens the door to new shortwavelength\ncoherent control experiments with ultrahigh time resolution and chemical\nsensitivity.\n", "  In this paper, we study transverse linear stability of line solitary waves to\nthe $2$-dimensional Benney-Luke equation which arises in the study of small\namplitude long water waves in $3$D. In the case where the surface tension is\nweak or negligible, we find a curve of resonant continuous eigenvalues near\n$0$. Time evolution of these resonant continuous eigenmodes is described by a\n$1$D damped wave equation in the transverse variable and it gives a linear\napproximation of the local phase shifts of modulating line solitary waves. In\nexponentially weighted space whose weight function increases in the direction\nof the motion of the line solitary wave, the other part of solutions to the\nlinearized equation decays exponentially as $t\\to\\infty$.\n", "  We calculate non-perturbatively the coefficient c_sw required for O(a)\nimprovement of the SU(3) gauge theory with Nf = 2 fermions in the two-index\nsymmetric (sextet) representation. For the calculations we impose the standard\nimprovement condition in the Schr\\\"odinger functional framework, using two\ndifferent discretisations for the gauge field i.e. the Wilson plaquette action\nand the tree-level improved Symanzik (L\\\"uscher-Weisz) action.\n", "  Photonic crystals use periodic structures to create forbidden frequency\nregions for optical wave propagation, that allow for the creation and\nintegration of complex optical functions in small footprint devices. Such\nstrategy has also been successfully applied to confine mechanical waves and to\nexplore their interaction with light in the so-called optomechanical cavities.\nBecause of their challenging design, these cavities are traditionally\nfabricated using dedicated high-resolution electron-beam lithography tools that\nare inherently slow, limiting this solution to small-scale applications or\nresearch. Here we show how to overcome this problem by using a deep-UV\nphotolithography process to fabricate optomechanical crystals on a commercial\nCMOS foundry. We show that a careful design of the photonic crystals can\nwithstand the limitations of the photolithography process, producing cavities\nwith measured intrinsic optical quality factors as high as\n$Q_{i}=(1.21\\pm0.02)\\times10^{6}$. Optomechanical crystals are also created\nusing phononic crystals to tightly confine the sound waves within the optical\ncavity that results in a measured vacuum optomechanical coupling rate of\n$g_{0}=2\\pi\\times(91\\pm4)$ kHz. Efficient sideband cooling and amplification\nare also demonstrated since these cavities are in the resolved sideband regime.\nFurther improvement in the design and fabrication process suggest that\ncommercial foundry-based optomechanical cavities could be used for quantum\nground-state cooling.\n", "  Trapping nanoscopic objects to observe their dynamic behaviour for extended\nperiods of time is an ongoing quest. Particularly, sub-100nm transparent\nobjects are hard to catch and most techniques rely on immobilisation or\ntransient diffusion through a confocal laser focus. We present an Anti-Brownian\nELectrokinetic trap (pioneered by A. E. Cohen and W. E. Moerner) to hold\nnanoparticles and individual FoF1-ATP synthase proteins in solution. We are\ninterested in the conformational dynamics of this membrane-bound rotary motor\nprotein that we monitor using single-molecule FRET. The ABELtrap is an active\nfeedback system cancelling the nano-object's Brownian motion by applying an\nelectric field. We show how the induced electrokinetic forces confine the\nmotion of nanoparticles and proteoliposomes to the centre of the trap.\n", "  The Debye model of the specific heat of solid at low temperatures is\nincorporate in the Entropic Gravity Theory (EGT). Rather of a smooth surface,\nthe holographic screen is considered as an oscillating elastic membrane, with a\ncontinuous range of frequencies, that cuts off at a maximum (Debye)\ntemperature, $T_D$. We show that at low temperatures $T < T_D$, the\nconservation of the equivalence principle in EGT requires a modification of the\nDavies-Unruh effect. While the maintenance of Davies-Unruh effect requires a\nviolation of the equivalence principle. These two possibilities are\nequivalents, because both can emulate the same quantity of dark matter.\nHowever, in both cases, the central mechanism is the Davies-Unruh effect, this\nseems to indicate that the modification of the Davies-Unruh effect emulates\ndark matter which in turn can be see as a violation of the equivalence\nprinciple. This scenario is promising to explain why MOND theory works at very\nlow temperatures (accelerations) regime, i. e., the galaxies sector. We also\nshow that in the intermediate region, for temperatures slightly lower or\nslightly higher than Debye temperature, EGT predicts the mass-temperature\nrelation of hot X-ray galaxy clusters.\n", "  Feynman, in 1982, proposed the idea of using a quantum simulator to perform\nquantum simulations. A quantum simulator is basically a controllable quantum\nsystem that can mimic the dynamics of other quantum systems we wish to study.\nIn this thesis we investigate some aspects of quantum simulation using both\nunitary and nonunitary controls. In the unitary part, we experimentally\nsimulated the phenomenon of quantum many-body freezing, and also developed a\ngeneral protocol to decompose an arbitrary unitary operator. In the nonunitary\npart, we studied phase decoherence by artificially inducing it. We\ncharacterized it by noise spectroscopy and quantum process tomography, and also\nsuppressed it by using standard dynamical decoupling techniques. While we use\nnuclear spin systems in an NMR setup as our quantum testbed, most of the\nconcepts are general and are applicable elsewhere.\n", "  We argue that the NICA fixed target experiment will be able to provide very\nimportant new experimental data on dilepton and $\\phi$ meson production in the\nbasically undiscovered energy domain between the SIS and SPS energies.\nExperimental information about elementary cross sections in this energy region\nis an essential ingredient of models of nuclear collisions in the same energy\nrange.\n"]}
