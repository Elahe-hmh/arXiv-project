We show\nthat such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two\nvertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also\nhighlight a phenomenon of \"back forcing\" as a property of each function. Such a\nphenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already\nused at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually\nperformed at a later stage. Finally, we point out that zero forcing can be also\nused to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a\npotentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular\nattention to monotonicity.\n", "  Local state transformation is the problem of transforming an arbitrary number\nof copies of a bipartite resource state to a bipartite target state under local\noperations. That is, given two bipartite states, is it possible to transform an\narbitrary number of copies of one of them to one copy of the other state under\nlocal operations only? This problem is a hard one in general since we assume\nthat the number of copies of the resource state is arbitrarily large. In this\npaper we prove some bounds on this problem using the hypercontractivity\nproperties of some super-operators corresponding to bipartite states. We\nmeasure hypercontractivity in terms of both the usual super-operator norms as\nwell as completely bounded norms.\n", "  We propose an order parameter for the Symmetry-Protected Topological (SPT)\nphases which are protected by Abelian on-site symmetries. This order parameter,\ncalled the \"SPT-entanglement\", is defined as the entanglement between A and B,\ntwo distant regions of the system, given that the total charge (associated with\nthe symmetry) in a third region C is measured and known, where C is a connected\nregion surrounded by A, B and the boundaries of the system. In the case of\n1-dimensional systems we prove that in the limit where A and B are large and\nfar from each other compared to the correlation length, the SPT-entanglement\nremains constant throughout a SPT phase, and furthermore, it is zero for the\ntrivial phase while it is nonzero for all the non-trivial phases. Moreover, we\nshow that the SPT-entanglement is invariant under the low-depth quantum\ncircuits which respect the symmetry, and hence it remains constant throughout a\nSPT phase in the higher dimensions as well. Also, we show that there is an\nintriguing connection between SPT-entanglement and the Fourier transform of the\nstring order parameters, which are the traditional tool for detecting SPT\nphases. This leads to a new algorithm for extracting the relevant information\nabout the SPT phase of the system from the string order parameters. Finally, we\ndiscuss implications of our results in the context of measurement-based quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We discuss the quantization of an unstable field through the construction of\na \"one-particle Hilbert space.\" The system considered here is a neutral scalar\nfield evolving over a globally hyperbolic static spacetime and subject to a\nstationary external scalar potential. In order to prove our results we assume\nspacetimes without horizons and that the theory possess a \"mass gap.\" Our\nstrategy consists in building a complex structure, which arises from a suitable\npositive bilinear form defined over the space of classical solutions of the\nfield equation. Once the space of states of the quantum field has been set, it\nis possible to study the effect of the time translation symmetry on it. From\nthe time translation operator we obtain an expression for the Hamiltonian\noperator associated with the unstable sector of the field. This last result\ncoincides with findings from long ago showing that the unstable degrees of\nfreedom of the field behave as non-relativistic particles in a parabolic\npotential barrier.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a simple framework for deriving one-shot achievable\nbounds for some problems in quantum information theory. Our framework is based\non the joint convexity of the exponential of the collision relative entropy,\nand is a (partial) quantum generalization of the technique of Yassaee et al.\n(2013) from classical information theory. Based on this framework, we derive\none-shot achievable bounds for the problems of communication over\nclassical-quantum channels, quantum hypothesis testing, and classical data\ncompression with quantum side information. We argue that our one-shot\nachievable bounds are strong enough to give the asymptotic achievable rates of\nthese problems even up to the second order.\n", "  Maximal correlation is a measure of correlation for bipartite distributions.\nThis measure has two intriguing features: (1) it is monotone under local\nstochastic maps; (2) it gives the same number when computed on i.i.d. copies of\na pair of random variables. This measure of correlation has recently been\ngeneralized for bipartite quantum states, for which the same properties have\nbeen proved. In this paper, based on maximal correlation, we define a new\nmeasure of entanglement which we call maximal entanglement. We show that this\nmeasure of entanglement is faithful (is zero on separable states and positive\non entangled states), is monotone under local quantum operations, and gives the\nsame number when computed on tensor powers of a bipartite state.\n", "  The dynamics of Dirac-Weyl spin-polarized wavepackets driven by periodic\nelectric field is considered for the electrons in a mesoscopic quantum dot\nformed at the edge of two-dimensional HgTe/CdTe topological insulator with\nDirac-Weyl massless energy spectra, where the motion of carriers is less\nsensitive to disorder and impurity potentials. It was observed that the\ninterplay of strongly coupled spin and charge degrees of freedom creates the\nregimes of irregular dynamics both in coordinate and spin channels. The border\nbetween the regular and irregular regimes determined by the strength and\nfrequency of the driving field is found analytically within the quasiclassical\napproach by means of the Ince-Strutt diagram for Mathieu equation, and is\nsupported by full quantum mechanical simulations of the driven dynamics. The\ninvestigation of quasienergy spectrum by Floquet approach reveals the presence\nof non-Poissonian level statistics which indicates the possibility of chaotic\nquantum dynamics and corresponds to the areas of parameters for irregular\nregimes within the quasiclassical approach. We found that the influence of weak\ndisorder leads to partial suppression of the dynamical chaos. Our findings are\nof interest both for progress in a fundamental field of quantum chaotic\ndynamics and for further experimental and technological applications of\nspin-dependent phenomena in nanostructures based on topological insulators.\n", "  We consider the propagation of two photonic qubits, initially maximally\nentangled in their orbital angular momenta (OAM), across a turbulent\natmosphere. By introducing the {\\it phase correlation length} of an OAM beam,\nwe show that the entanglement of OAM photons exhibits a universal exponential\ndecay under turbulence.\n", "  Non-locality is the phenomenon of observing strong correlations among the\noutcomes of local measurements of a multipartite physical system. No-signaling\nboxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and wirings are local\noperations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means that, no matter how\nnon-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be\nclosed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature\nis to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial\nexamples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way\nto study wirings. In particular, given a set of no-signaling boxes, we do not\nknow a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings. In this paper,\nwe propose the first general method to construct such closed sets of non-local\ncorrelations. We show that a well-known measure of correlation, called maximal\ncorrelation, when appropriately defined for non-local correlations, is\nmonotonically decreasing under wirings.\n  This establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic\nboxes from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of\nnon-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some\nmathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of\nmaximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and\nprovide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity\nribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.\n", "  State redistribution is the protocol in which, given an arbitrary tripartite\nquantum state, with two of the subsystems initially being with Alice and one\nbeing with Bob, the goal is for Alice to send one of her subsystems to Bob,\npossibly with the help of prior shared entanglement. We derive an upper bound\non the second order asymptotic expansion for the quantum communication cost of\nachieving state redistribution with a given finite accuracy. In proving our\nresult, we also obtain an upper bound on the quantum communication cost of this\nprotocol in the one-shot setting, by using the protocol of coherent state\nmerging as a primitive.\n", "  We study complexity of several problems related to the Transverse field Ising\nModel (TIM). First, we consider the problem of estimating the ground state\nenergy known as the Local Hamiltonian Problem (LHP). It is shown that the LHP\nfor TIM on degree-3 graphs is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the\nLHP for general k-local `stoquastic' Hamiltonians with any constant $k\\ge 2$.\nThis result implies that estimating the ground state energy of TIM on degree-3\ngraphs is a complete problem for the complexity class StoqMA - an extension of\nthe classical class MA. As a corollary, we complete the complexity\nclassification of 2-local Hamiltonians with a fixed set of interactions\nproposed recently by Cubitt and Montanaro. Secondly, we study quantum annealing\nalgorithms for finding ground states of classical spin Hamiltonians associated\nwith hard optimization problems. We prove that the quantum annealing with TIM\nHamiltonians is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the quantum\nannealing with a certain subclass of k-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. This\nsubclass includes all Hamiltonians representable as a sum of a k-local diagonal\nHamiltonian and a 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonian.\n", "  We present high angular resolution observations of the HCN(1-0) emission (at\n~1\" or ~34 pc), together with CO J = 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 observations, toward the\nSeyfert 2 nucleus of M51 (NGC 5194). The overall HCN(1-0) distribution and\nkinematics are very similar to that of the CO lines, which have been indicated\nas the jet-entrained molecular gas in our past observations. In addition, high\nHCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) brightness temperature ratio of about unity is observed along\nthe jets, similar to that observed at the shocked molecular gas in our Galaxy.\nThese results strongly indicate that both diffuse and dense gases are entrained\nby the jets and outflowing from the AGN. The channel map of HCN(1-0) at the\nsystemic velocity shows a strong emission right at the nucleus, where no\nobvious emission has been detected in the CO lines. The HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0)\nbrightness temperature ratio at this region reaches >2, a value that cannot be\nexplained considering standard physical/chemical conditions. Based on our\ncalculations, we suggest infrared pumping and possibly weak HCN masing, but\nstill requiring an enhanced HCN abundance for the cause of this high ratio.\nThis suggests the presence of a compact dense obscuring molecular gas in front\nof the nucleus of M51, which remains unresolved at our ~1\" (~34 pc) resolution,\nand consistent with the Seyfert 2 classification picture.\n", "  We study classical source coding with quantum side-information where the\nquantum side-information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a\nclassical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable\nrate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the\nmeasurement compression theory by Winter. Our result reveals that a helper's\nscheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal,\nand the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal\nrate region.\n", "  A variation of the Domain Wall operator with an additional parameter alpha\nwill be introduced. The conditioning of the new Domain Wall operator depends on\nalpha, whereas the corresponding 4D propagator does not. The new and the\nconventional Domain Wall operator agree for alpha = 1. By tuning alpha, speed\nups of the linear system solvers of around 20% could be achieved.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of extracting secret key from an\neavesdropped source $p_{XYZ}$ at a rate given by the conditional mutual\ninformation. We investigate this question under three different scenarios: (i)\nAlice ($X$) and Bob ($Y$) are unable to communicate but share common randomness\nwith the eavesdropper Eve ($Z$), (ii) Alice and Bob are allowed one-way public\ncommunication, and (iii) Alice and Bob are allowed two-way public\ncommunication. Distributions having a key rate of the conditional mutual\ninformation are precisely those in which a \"helping\" Eve offers Alice and Bob\nno greater advantage for obtaining secret key than a fully adversarial one. For\neach of the above scenarios, strong necessary conditions are derived on the\nstructure of distributions attaining a secret key rate of $I(X:Y|Z)$. In\nobtaining our results, we completely solve the problem of secret key\ndistillation under scenario (i) and identify $H(S|Z)$ to be the optimal key\nrate using shared randomness, where $S$ is the G\\'acs-K\\\"orner Common\nInformation. We thus provide an operational interpretation of the conditional\nG\\'acs-K\\\"orner Common Information. Additionally, we introduce simple example\ndistributions in which the rate $I(X:Y|Z)$ is achievable if and only if two-way\ncommunication is allowed.\n", "  We study source compression with a helper in the fully quantum regime,\nextending our earlier result on classical source compression with a quantum\nhelper [arXiv:1501.04366, 2015]. We characterise the quantum resources involved\nin this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate\nregion when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is\nbased on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state\nmerging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem (QRST). This result\ndemonstrates an unexpected connection between distributed source compression\nwith the QRST protocol, a quantum protocol that consumes noiseless resources to\nsimulate a noisy quantum channel.\n", "  This paper deals with a Boltzmann-type kinetic model describing the interplay\nbetween vehicle dynamics and safety aspects in vehicular traffic. Sticking to\nthe idea that the macroscopic characteristics of traffic flow, including the\ndistribution of the driving risk along a road, are ultimately generated by\none-to-one interactions among drivers, the model links the personal (i.e.,\nindividual) risk to the changes of speeds of single vehicles and implements a\nprobabilistic description of such microscopic interactions in a Boltzmann-type\ncollisional operator. By means of suitable statistical moments of the kinetic\ndistribution function, it is finally possible to recover macroscopic\nrelationships between the average risk and the road congestion, which show an\ninteresting and reasonable correlation with the well-known free and congested\nphases of the flow of vehicles.\n", "  The Born approximation (Born 1926 Z.Phys.38.802) is a fundamental result in\nphysics, it allows the calculation of weak scattering via the Fourier transform\nof the scattering potential. As was done by previous authors (Ge et al 2014 New\nJ. Phys. 16 113048) the Born approximation is extended by including in the\nformula the resonant-states (RSs) of the scatterer. However in this study\nunlike previous studies the included eigen-modes are correctly normalised with\ndramatic positive consequences for the accuracy of the method. The\nnormalisation of the RSs used in the previous RSE Born approximation or\nresonant-state-expansion Born approximation made in Ge et al (2014 New J. Phys.\n16 113048) has been shown to be numerically unstable in Muljarov et al (2014\narXiv:1409.6877) and by analytics here. The RSs of the system can be calculated\nusing my recently discovered RSE perturbation theory for dispersive\nelectrodynamic scatterers (Muljarov et al 2010 Europhys. Lett. 92 50010; Doost\net al 2012 Phys, Rev. A 89; Doost et al 2014 Phys. Rev. A 90 013834) and\nnormalised correctly to appear in the spectral Green's functions and hence the\nRSE Born approximation via the flux-volume normalisation which I recently\nrigorously derived in Armitage et al (2014 Phys. Rev. A 89), Doost et al (2014\nPhys. Rev. A 90 013834)(2016 Phys. Rev. A 93 023835). In the case of\neffectively one-dimensional systems I find an RSE Born approximation\nalternative to the scattering matrix method.\n", "  We introduce a new Baxterisation for R-matrices that depend separately on two\nspectral parameters. The Baxterisation is based on a new algebra, close to but\ndifferent from the braid group. This allows us to recover the R-matrix of the\nmulti-species generalization of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process\nwith different hopping rates.\n", "  We propose an efficient grassmannian formalism for solution of bi-linear\nfinite-difference Hirota equation (T-system) on T-shaped lattices related to\nthe space of highest weight representations of $gl(K_1,K_2|M)$ superalgebra.\nThe formalism is inspired by the quantum fusion procedure known from the\nintegrable spin chains and is based on exterior forms of Baxter-like\nQ-functions. We find a few new interesting relations among the exterior forms\nof Q-functions and reproduce, using our new formalism, the Wronskian\ndeterminant solutions of Hirota equations known in the literature. Then we\ngeneralize this construction to the twisted Q-functions and demonstrate the\nsubtleties of untwisting procedure on the examples of rational quantum spin\nchains with twisted boundary conditions. Using these observations, we\ngeneralize the recently discovered, in our paper with N. Gromov, AdS/CFT\nQuantum Spectral Curve for exact planar spectrum of AdS/CFT duality to the case\nof arbitrary Cartan twisting of AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ string sigma model. Finally,\nwe successfully probe this formalism by reproducing the energy of gamma-twisted\nBMN vacuum at single-wrapping orders of weak coupling expansion.\n", "  In addition to the implementation of parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric\noptical systems by carefully and actively controlling the gain and loss, we\nshow that a $2\\times 2$ $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian has a unitarily\nequivalent representation without complex optical potentials in the resulting\noptical coupler. Through the Naimark dilation in operator algebra, passive\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric couplers can thus be implemented with a refractive\nindex of real values and asymmetric coupling coefficients. This opens up the\npossibility to implement general $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with\nstate-of-the-art asymmetric slab waveguides, dissimilar optical fibers, or\ncavities with chiral mirrors.\n", "  The model for the generation of magnetic fields in a neutron star, based on\nthe magnetic field instability caused by the electroweak interaction between\nelectrons and nucleons, is developed. Using the methods of the quantum field\ntheory, the helicity flip rate of electrons in their scattering off protons in\ndense matter of a neutron star is calculated. The influence of the electroweak\ninteraction between electrons and background nucleons on the process of the\nhelicity flip is studied. The kinetic equation for the evolution of the chital\nimbalance is derived. The obtained results are applied for the description of\nthe magnetic fields evolution in magnetars.\n", "  We study generalized electric/magnetic duality in Abelian gauge theory by\ncombining techniques from locally covariant quantum field theory and\nCheeger-Simons differential cohomology on the category of globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian manifolds. Our approach generalizes previous treatments using the\nHamiltonian formalism in a manifestly covariant way and without the assumption\nof compact Cauchy surfaces. We construct semi-classical configuration spaces\nand corresponding presymplectic Abelian groups of observables, which are\nquantized by the CCR-functor to the category of $C^*$-algebras. We demonstrate\nexplicitly how duality is implemented as a natural isomorphism between quantum\nfield theories. We apply this formalism to develop a fully covariant quantum\ntheory of self-dual fields.\n", "  We derive the first law of black hole mechanics for physical theories based\non a local, covariant and gauge-invariant Lagrangian where the dynamical fields\ntransform non-trivially under the action of internal gauge transformations. The\ntheories of interest include General Relativity formulated in terms of tetrads,\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory and Einstein-Dirac theory. Since the dynamical\nfields of these theories have gauge freedom, we argue that there is no group\naction of diffeomorphisms of spacetime on such dynamical fields. In general,\nsuch fields cannot even be represented as smooth, globally well-defined tensor\nfields on spacetime. Consequently the derivation of the first law by Iyer-Wald\ncannot be used directly. We show how such theories can be formulated on a\nprincipal bundle and that there is a natural action of automorphisms of the\nbundle on the fields. These bundle automorphisms encode both spacetime\ndiffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. Using this reformulation we define\nthe Noether charge associated to an infinitesimal automorphism and the\ncorresponding notion of stationarity and axisymmetry of the dynamical fields.\nWe define certain potentials and charges at the horizon of a black hole so that\nthe potentials are constant on the bifurcate Killing horizon, giving a\ngeneralised zeroth law for bifurcate Killing horizons. We identify the\ngravitational potential and perturbed charge as the temperature and perturbed\nentropy of the black hole which gives an explicit formula for the perturbed\nentropy analogous to the Wald entropy formula. We obtain a general first law of\nblack hole mechanics for such theories. The first law relates the perturbed\nHamiltonians at spatial infinity and the horizon, and the horizon contributions\ntake the form of a potential times perturbed charge term. We also comment on\nthe ambiguities in defining a prescription for the total entropy for black\nholes.\n", "  Technology based on memristors, resistors with memory whose resistance\ndepends on the history of the crossing charges, has lately enhanced the\nclassical paradigm of computation with neuromorphic architectures. However, in\ncontrast to the known quantized models of passive circuit elements, such as\ninductors, capacitors or resistors, the design and realization of a quantum\nmemristor is still missing. Here, we introduce the concept of a quantum\nmemristor as a quantum dissipative device, whose decoherence mechanism is\ncontrolled by a continuous-measurement feedback scheme, which accounts for the\nmemory. Indeed, we provide numerical simulations showing that memory effects\nactually persist in the quantum regime. Our quantization method, specifically\ndesigned for superconducting circuits, may be extended to other quantum\nplatforms, allowing for memristor-type constructions in different quantum\ntechnologies. The proposed quantum memristor is then a building block for\nneuromorphic quantum computation and quantum simulations of non-Markovian\nsystems.\n", "  Characterizing the interaction between water and microscopic defects is one\nof the long-standing challenges in understanding a broad range of cracking\nprocesses. Different physical aspects of microscopic events, driven or\ninfluenced by water, have been extensively discussed in atomistic calculations\nbut have not been accessible in microscale experiments. Through the analysis of\nthe emitted noises during the evolution of individual, dynamic microcracking\nevents, we show that the onset of a secondary instability known as hybrid\nevents occurs during the fast healing phase of microcracking, which leads to\n(local) sudden increase of pore water pressure in the process zone, inducing a\nsecondary instability, which is followed by a fast-locking phase on the\nmicroscopic faults (pulse-like rupture).\n", "  We present SAURON integral-field observations of a sample of 12 mid to\nhigh-inclination disk galaxies, to unveil hidden bars on the basis of their\nkinematics, i.e., the correlation between velocity and h3 profiles, and to\nestablish their degree of cylindrical rotation. For the latter, we introduce a\nmethod to quantify cylindrical rotation that is robust against inner disk\ncomponents. We confirm high-levels of cylindrical rotation in boxy/peanut\nbulges, but also observe this feature in a few galaxies with rounder bulges. We\nsuggest that these are also barred galaxies with end-on orientations.\nRe-analysing published data for our own Galaxy using this new method, we\ndetermine that the Milky Way bulge is cylindrically rotating at the same level\nas the strongest barred galaxy in our sample. Finally, we use self-consistent\nthree-dimensional N-body simulations of bar-unstable disks to study the\ndependence of cylindrical rotation on the bar's orientation and host galaxy\ninclination.\n", "  We shall discuss the general relativistic generation of spikes in a massless\nscalar field or stiff perfect fluid model. We first investigate orthogonally\ntransitive (OT) $G_2$ stiff fluid spike models both heuristically and\nnumerically, and give a new exact OT $G_2$ stiff fluid spike solution. We then\npresent a new two-parameter family of non-OT $G_2$ stiff fluid spike solutions,\nobtained by the generalization of non-OT $G_2$ vacuum spike solutions to the\nstiff fluid case by applying Geroch's transformation on a Jacobs seed. The\ndynamics of these new stiff fluid spike solutions is qualitatively different\nfrom that of the vacuum spike solutions, in that the matter (stiff fluid) feels\nthe spike directly and the stiff fluid spike solution can end up with a\npermanent spike. We then derive the evolution equations of non-OT $G_2$ stiff\nfluid models, including a second perfect fluid, in full generality, and briefly\ndiscuss some of their qualitative properties and their potential numerical\nanalysis. Finally, we discuss how a fluid, and especially a stiff fluid or\nmassless scalar field, affects the physics of the generation of spikes.\n", "  We use the Illustris simulation to study the relative contributions of in\nsitu star formation and stellar accretion to the build-up of galaxies over an\nunprecedentedly wide range of masses ($M_{\\ast} = 10^9-10^{12} \\, {\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$), galaxy types, environments, and assembly histories. We find that\nthe `two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good\napproximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation -- namely,\nthe stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times $10^{11} \\, {\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The\nfraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at $z=0$ contributed by accreted\nstars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10\nper cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for $M_{\\ast} \\approx\n10^{12} \\, {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy\nvariation. At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the\ncentres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than\ndisc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. On average, $\\sim$50 per\ncent of the ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio\n$\\mu > 1/4$), $\\sim$20 per cent from minor mergers ($1/10 < \\mu < 1/4$),\n$\\sim$20 per cent from very minor mergers ($\\mu < 1/10$), and $\\sim$10 per cent\nfrom stars that were stripped from surviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing\nmergers). These components are spatially segregated, with in situ stars\ndominating the innermost regions of galaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited\nat larger galactocentric distances in order of decreasing merger mass ratio.\n", "  Recently, the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have reported direct searches for\nthe 125 GeV Higgs decay with lepton flavor violation, $h\\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$.\nIn this work, we analyze the signal of the lepton flavour violating (LFV) Higgs\ndecay $h\\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$ in the $\\mu$ from $\\nu$ Supersymmetric Standard\nModel ($\\mu\\nu$SSM) with slepton flavor mixing. Simultaneously, we consider the\nconstraints from the LFV decay $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma$, the muon\nanomalous magnetic dipole moment and the lightest Higgs mass around 125 GeV.\n", "  We study eigenvectors in the deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble of random\nmatrices $H=W\\tilde{H}W$, where $\\tilde{H}$ is a random matrix from Gaussian\nunitary ensemble and $W$ is a deterministic diagonal matrix with positive\nentries. Using the supersymmetry approach we calculate analytically the moments\nand the distribution function of the eigenvectors components for a generic\nmatrix $W$. We show that specific choices of $W$ can modify significantly the\nnature of the eigenvectors changing them from extended to critical to\nlocalized. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.\n", "  Some aspects of Aomoto's generalized hypergeometric functions on Grassmannian\nspaces $Gr(k+1,n+1)$ are reviewed. Particularly, their integral representations\nin terms of twisted homology and cohomology are clarified with an example of\nthe $Gr(2,4)$ case which corresponds to Gauss' hypergeometric functions. The\ncases of $Gr(2, n+1)$ in general lead to $(n+1)$-point solutions of the\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation. We further analyze the\nSchechtman-Varchenko integral representations of the KZ solutions in relation\nto the $Gr(k+1, n+1)$ cases. We show that holonomy operators of the so-called\nKZ connections can be interpreted as hypergeometric-type integrals. This result\nleads to an improved description of a recently proposed holonomy formalism for\ngluon amplitudes. We also present a (co)homology interpretation of Grassmannian\nformulations for scattering amplitudes in ${\\cal N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n", "  Positive energy ray representations of the Poincar\\'e group are naturally\nsubdivided into three classes according to their mass and spin content: m>0,\nm=0 finite helicity and m=0 infinite helicity. For a long time the localization\nproperties of the massless infinite spin class remained unknown before it\nbecame clear that such matter does not permit compact spactime localization and\nits generating covariant fields are localized on semi-infinite spacelike\nstrings. Using a new perturbation theory for higher spin fields we show that\ninfinite spin matter cannot interact with normal matter and we formulate\ncondition under which this also could happen for finite spin s>1 fields. This\nraises the question of a possible connection between inert matter and dark\nmatter.\n", "  The main objective of the present work is to correlate quarter-point angle\nand nuclear radius or nuclear matter distribution. Various phenomenological\nformulae with parameters for strong absorption radius Rs are obtained and\ncompared by fitting the experimental data of quarter point angle extracted from\nnuclear elastic scattering reaction systems. The parameterized formula of Rs\nrelated to the isospin and binding energy is recommended, that gives a good\nreproduction of nuclear matter radii of halo nuclei.\n", "  The Hilbert space formulation of interacting $s=1$ vector-potentials stands\nin an interesting contrast with the point-local Krein space setting of gauge\ntheory. Already in the absence of interactions the Wilson loop in a Hilbert\nspace setting has a \"topological property\" which is missing in the gauge\ntheoretic description (Haag duality, Aharonov-Bohm effect); the conceptual\ndifferences increase in the presence of interactions. The Hilbert space\npositivity weakens the causal localization properties if interacting fields\nwhich results in the replacement of the gauge-variant point-local matter fields\nin Krein space by string-local physical fields in Hilbert space. The gauge\ninvariance of the perturbative S-matrix corresponds to its independence of the\nspacelike string direction of its interpolating.fields. In contrast to gauge\ntheory, whose physical range is limited to gauge invariant perturbative\nS-matrix and local observables, its Hilbert space string-local counterpart in\nis a full-fledged quantum field theory. The new setting reveals that the\nLie-structure of self-coupled vector mesons results from perturbative\nimplementation of the causal localization principles of QFT.\n", "  Microlensing events provide a unique capacity to study the stellar remnant\npopulation of the Galaxy. Optical microlensing suffers from a near complete\ndegeneracy between the mass, the velocity and the distance. However, a\nsubpopulation of lensed stars, Mira variable stars, are also radio bright,\nexhibiting strong SiO masers. These are sufficiently bright and compact to\npermit direct imaging using existing very long baseline interferometers such as\nthe Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We show that these events are relatively\ncommon, occurring at a rate of $\\approx 2~{\\rm yr^{\\ -1}}$ of which $0.1~{\\rm\nyr^{-1}}$ are associated with Galactic black holes. Features in the associated\nimages, e.g., the Einstein ring, are sufficiently well resolved to fully\nreconstruct the lens properties, enabling the measurement of mass, distance,\nand tangential velocity of the lensing object to a precision better than 15%.\nFuture radio microlensing surveys conducted with upcoming radio telescopes\ncombined with modest improvements in the VLBA could increase the rate of\nGalactic black hole events to roughly 10~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, sufficient to double\nthe number of known stellar mass black holes in a couple years, and permitting\nthe construction of distribution functions of stellar mass black hole\nproperties.\n", "  We study how useful random states are for quantum metrology, i.e., surpass\nthe classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase estimation\nscenario. First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space\nof distinguishable particles typically do not lead to super-classical scaling\nof precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we\nshow that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the\noptimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization.\nSurprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low\npurity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for\nsuch states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to\ntypically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values\nof the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically\nuseful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from\nthree types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation.\n", "  Possibilities of turning intrinsically n-type oxide semiconductors like ZnO\nand Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O into p-type materials are investigated. Motivated by\nrecent experiments on Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O doped with nitrogen we analyze the\nelectronic defect levels of point defects N$_{{\\rm O}}$, v$_{{\\rm Zn}}$, and\nN$_{{\\rm O}}$-v$_{{\\rm Zn}}$ pairs in ZnO and Zn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O by means of\nself-interaction-corrected density functional theory calculations. We show how\nthe interplay of defects can lead to shallow acceptor defect levels, although\nthe levels of individual point defects N$_{{\\rm O}}$ are too deep in the band\ngap for being responsible for p-type conduction. We relate our results to\np-type conduction paths at grain boundaries seen in polycrystalline ZnO and\ndevelop an understanding of a p-type mechanism which is common to ZnO,\nZn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O, and related materials.\n", "  The concept of quantum correlation matrix for observables leads to the\napplication of the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) also for quantum system\nin Hilbert space. It is shown that, in the case of a 2x2 spin system where the\nobservables are the Pauli matrices and a polarization vector is acting on the\ndensity matrix, meaningful results can be obtained by the PCA in terms of qubit\nproperties. In particular, it is shown that by choosing, for example, the (x,z)\nspinors, the axes of the principal components (PC) coincide with the circular\npolarization basis on the Block Sphere.\n", "  We have investigated the anomalous quartic couplings defined by the\ndimension-8 operators in semileptonic decay channel of the\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow \\nu_{e} W^{-} W^{+} \\bar{\\nu}_{e}$ process for\nunpolarized and polarized electron (positron) beam at the Compact Linear\nCollider. We give the $95\\%$ confidence level bounds on anomalous\n$\\frac{f_{S0}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$, $\\frac{f_{S1}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$ and\n$\\frac{f_{T0}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$ couplings for various values of the integrated\nluminosities and center-of-mass energies. The best sensitivities obtained on\nanomalous $\\frac{f_{S0}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$, $\\frac{f_{S1}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$ and\n$\\frac{f_{T0}}{\\Lambda^{4}}$ couplings through the process\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow \\nu_{e} W^{-} W^{+} \\bar{\\nu}_{e}$ with beam\npolarization at $\\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV and an integrated luminosity of $L_{int}=2000$\nfb$^{-1}$ are $[-4.05;\\, 3.67]\\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-4}$, $[-3.08; \\,\n2.12]\\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-4}$, $[-1.98; \\, 0.64]\\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-4}$,\nwhich show improvement over the current bounds.\n", "  We begin showing that for even dimensional vector spaces $V$ all\nautomorphisms of their Clifford algebras are inner. So all orthogonal\ntransformations of $V$ are restrictions to $V$ of inner automorphisms of the\nalgebra. Thus under orthogonal transformations $P$ and $T$ - space and time\nreversal - all algebra elements, including vectors $v$ and spinors $\\varphi$,\ntransform as $v \\to x v x^{-1}$ and $\\varphi \\to x \\varphi x^{-1}$ for some\nalgebra element $x$. We show that while under combined $PT$ spinor $\\varphi \\to\nx \\varphi x^{-1}$ remain in its spinor space, under $P$ or $T$ separately\n$\\varphi$ goes to a 'different' spinor space and may have opposite chirality.\nWe conclude with a preliminary characterization of inner automorphisms with\nrespect to their property to change, or not, spinor spaces.\n", "  By imaging single-shot realizations of an organic polariton quantum fluid, we\nobserve the long-sought dynamical instability of non-equilibrium condensates.\nWithout any free parameters, we find an excellent agreement between the\nexperimental data and a numerical simulation of the open-dissipative\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, which allows us to draw several important\nconclusions about the physics of the system. We find that the reservoir\ndynamics are in the strongly nonadiabatic regime, which renders the complex\nGinzburg-Landau description invalid. The observed transition from stable to\nunstable fluid can only be explained by taking into account the specific form\nof reservoir-mediated instability as well as particle currents induced by the\nfinite extent of the pump spot.\n", "  Equidistant and non-equidistant single pulse \"bang-bang\" dynamical controls\nare investigated in the context of mean ergodic theorems. We show the\nrequirements in which the limit of infinite pulse control for both the\nequidistant and the non-equidistant dynamical control converges to the same\nunitary evolution. It is demonstrated that the generator of this evolution can\nbe obtained by projecting the generator of the free evolution onto the\ncommutant of the unitary operator representing the pulse. Inequalities are\nderived to prove this statement and in the case of non-equidistant approach\nthese inequalities are optimised as a function of the time intervals.\n", "  Interest in the black hole information paradox has recently been catalyzed by\nthe newer \"firewall\" argument. The crux of the updated argument is that\nprevious solutions which relied on observer complementarity are in violation of\nthe quantum condition of monogamy of entanglement; with the prescribed remedy\nbeing to discard the equivalence principle in favor of an energy barrier (or\nfirewall) at the black hole horizon. Differing points of view have been put\nforward, including the \"ER=EPR\" counterargument and the final-state solution,\nboth of which can be viewed as potential resolutions to the apparent conflict\nbetween quantum monogamy and Einstein equivalence. After reviewing these recent\ndevelopments, this paper argues that the ER=EPR and final-state solutions can\n-- thanks to observer complementarity -- be seen as the same resolution of the\nparadox but from two different perspectives: inside and outside the black hole.\n", "  High Voltage CMOS sensors are a promising technology for tracking detectors\nin collider experiments. Extensive R&D studies are being carried out by the\nATLAS Collaboration for a possible use of HV-CMOS in the High Luminosity LHC\nupgrade of the Inner Tracker detector. CaRIBOu (Control and Readout Itk BOard)\nis a modular test system developed to test Silicon based detectors. It\ncurrently includes five custom designed boards, a Xilinx ZC706 development\nboard, FELIX (Front-End LInk eXchange) PCIe card and a host computer. A\nsoftware program has been developed in Python to control the CaRIBOu hardware.\nCaRIBOu has been used in the testbeam of the HV-CMOS sensor CCPDv4 at CERN.\nPreliminary results have shown that the test system is very versatile. Further\ndevelopment is ongoing to adapt to different sensors, and to make it available\nto various lab test stands.\n", "  Determining the precise value of the tangential component of the velocity of\nM31 is a non trivial astrophysical issue, that relies on complicated modeling.\nThis has recently lead to con- flicting estimates, obtained by several groups\nthat used different methodologies and assump- tions. This letter addresses the\nissue by computing a Bayesian posterior distribution function of this quantity,\nin order to measure the compatibility of those estimates with LambdaCDM. This\nis achieved using an ensemble of local group (LG) look-alikes collected from a\nset of Con- strained Simulations (CSs) of the local Universe, and a standard\nunconstrained LambdaCDM. The latter allows us to build a control sample of\nLG-like pairs and to single out the influence of the environment in our\nresults. We find that neither estimate is at odds with LambdaCDM; how- ever,\nwhereas CSs favour higher values of vtan , the reverse is true for estimates\nbased on LG samples gathered from unconstrained simulations, overlooking the\nenvironmental element\n", "  It is highlighted by Prigogine that there are two additional universal\nbehaviors associated with the entropy production rate besides the four laws of\nthermodynamics. One is that the entropy production rate decreases when the\nsystem approaches the steady state, and the other is that the entropy\nproduction rate reaches its minimal value at the steady state. Motivated by the\nblack hole thermodynamics and AdS/CFT correspondence, we resort to Raychaudhuri\nequation to prove that these two universal behaviors are also obeyed by the\nblack hole entropy. In particular, our result together with the four laws of\nblack hole thermodynamics further indicates that the holographic gravity should\nbe universal, not restricted only within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.\n", "  Based on accurate representation of the He+-He angular differential\nscattering cross sections consisting of both elastic and charge exchange\ncollisions, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the ion velocity\ndistribution functions (IVDF) by Monte Carlo collision method (MCC). The\nresults of simulations are validated by comparison with the experimental data\nof the ion mobility and the transverse diffusion. The IVDF simulation study\nshows that due to significant effect of scattering in elastic collisions IVDF\ncannot be separated into product of two independent IVDFs in the transverse and\nparallel to the electric field directions.\n", "  A number of papers attempt to explain the positron anomaly in cosmic rays,\nobserved by PAMELA and AMS-02, in terms of dark matter (DM) decays or\nannihilations. However, the recent progress in cosmic gamma-ray studies\nchallenges these attempts. Indeed, as we show, any rational DM model explaining\nthe positron anomaly abundantly produces final state radiation and Inverse\nCompton gamma rays, which inevitably leads to a contradiction with Fermi-LAT\nisotropic diffuse gamma-ray background measurements. Furthermore, the Fermi-LAT\nobservation of Milky Way dwarf satellites, supposed to be rich in DM, revealed\nno significant signal in gamma rays. We propose a generic approach in which the\nmajor contribution to cosmic rays comes from the dark matter disc and prove\nthat the tension between the DM origin of the positron anomaly and the cosmic\ngamma-ray observations can be relieved. We consider both a simple model, in\nwhich DM decay/annihilate into charged leptons, and a model-independent minimal\ncase of particle production, and we estimate the optimal thickness of DM disk.\nPossible mechanisms of formation and its properties are briefly discussed.\n", "  We consider a minimal model to investigate the metal-insulator transition in\nVO$_2$. We adopt a Hubbard model with two orbital per unit cell, which captures\nthe competition between Mott and singlet-dimer localization. We solve the model\nwithin Dynamical Mean Field Theory, characterizing in detail the\nmetal-insulator transition and finding new features in the electronic states.\nWe compare our results with available experimental data obtaining good\nagreement in the relevant model parameter range. Crucially, we can account for\npuzzling optical conductivity data obtained within the hysteresis region, which\nwe associate to a novel metallic state characterized by a split heavy\nquasiparticle band. Our results show that the thermal-driven insulator-to-metal\ntransition in VO$_2$ is compatible with a Mott electronic mechanism, providing\nfresh insight to a long standing \"chicken-and-egg\" debate and calling for\nfurther research of \"Mottronics\" applications of this system.\n", "  Astrophysical sources outside the Milky Way, such as active galactic nuclei\nand star-forming galaxies, leave their imprint on the gamma-ray sky as nearly\nisotropic emission referred to as the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background (EGB).\nWhile the brightest of these sources may be individually resolved, their\nfainter counterparts contribute diffusely. In this work, we use a\nrecently-developed analysis method, called the Non-Poissonian Template Fit, on\nup to 93 months of publicly-available data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope\nto determine the properties of the point sources that comprise the EGB. This\nanalysis takes advantage of photon-count statistics to probe the aggregate\nproperties of these source populations below the sensitivity threshold of\npublished catalogs. We measure the source-count distributions and point-source\nintensities, as a function of energy, from 2 GeV to 2 TeV. We find that the EGB\nis dominated by point sources, likely blazars, in all seven energy sub-bins\nconsidered. These results have implications for the interpretation of IceCube's\nPeV neutrinos, which may originate from sources that contribute to the\nnon-blazar component of the EGB. Additionally, we comment on implications for\nfuture TeV observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array. We provide sky\nmaps showing locations most likely to contain these new sources at both low (<\n50 GeV) and high (> 50 GeV) energies for use in future observations and\ncross-correlation studies.\n", "  We analytically study the properties of a $(2+1)$-dimensional $s$-wave\nholographic superconductor in the presence of exponential nonlinear\nelectrodynamics. We consider the case in which the scalar and gauge fields back\nreact on the background metric. Employing the analytical Sturm-Liouville\nmethod, we find that in the black hole background, the nonlinear\nelectrodynamics correction will affect the properties of the holographic\nsuperconductors. We find that with increasing both backreaction and nonlinear\nparameters, the scalar hair condensation on the boundary will develop more\ndifficult. We obtain the relation connecting the critical temperature with the\ncharge density. Our analytical results support that, even in the presence of\nthe nonlinear electrodynamics and backreaction, the phase transition for the\nholographic superconductor still belongs to the second order and the critical\nexponent of the system always takes the mean-field value $1/2$.\n", "  Wave function collapse models postulate a fundamental breakdown of the\nquantum superposition principle at the macroscale. Therefore, experimental\ntests of collapse models are also fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. Here,\nwe compute the upper bounds on the collapse parameters, which can be inferred\nby the gravitational wave detectors LIGO, LISA Pathfinder, and AURIGA. We\nconsider the most widely used collapse model, the continuous spontaneous\nlocalization (CSL) model. We show that these experiments exclude a huge portion\nof the CSL parameter space, the strongest bound being set by the recently\nlaunched space mission LISA Pathfinder. We also rule out a proposal for\nquantum-gravity-induced decoherence.\n", "  Using measurements of $H(z)$ and $d_\\mathrm{A}(z)$ from the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12 and luminosity distances from the\nJoint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) compilation of supernovae (SN), we measure $H_0\nr_\\mathrm{d}$ without any model assumption. Our measurement of $H_0\nr_\\mathrm{d} = $($10033.20^{+333.10}_{-371.81}$ (SN) $\\pm$ 128.19 (BAO)) km\ns$^{-1}$ is consistent with Planck constrains for the flat {\\Lambda}CDM model.\nWe also report that higher expansion history rates $h(z)$ (among the\npossibilities) as well as lower-bound values of $H_0 r\\mathrm{d}$ result in\nbetter internal consistency among the independent data (H(z)rd and\n$d_\\mathrm{A}(z)/r_\\mathrm{d}$ from BAO at $z=0.32$ and z=0.57 and\n$d_\\mathrm{L}$ from JLA) we used in this work. This can be interpreted as an\ninteresting and independent support of Planck cosmology without using any\ncosmic microwave background data. We then combine these observables to test the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and the flatness of the\nUniverse in a model-independent way at two redshifts, namely 0.32 and 0.57, by\nintroducing a new diagnostic for flat-FLRW, $\\Theta(z)$, which only depends on\nobservables of BAO and SN data. Our results are consistent with a flat-FLRW\nUniverse within $2{\\sigma}$.\n", "  We consider a collection of distributed units that interact with one another\nthrough the sending of messages. Each message carries a positive ($+1$) or\nnegative ($-1$) tag and causes the receiving unit to send out messages as a\nfunction of the tags it has received and a threshold. This simple model\nabstracts some of the essential characteristics of several systems used in the\nfield of artificial intelligence, and also of biological systems epitomized by\nthe brain. We study the integration of information inside a temporal window as\nthe model's dynamics unfolds. We quantify information integration by the total\ncorrelation, relative to the window's duration ($w$), of a set of random\nvariables valued as a function of message arrival. Total correlation refers to\nthe rise of information gain above and beyond that which the units already\nachieve individually, being therefore related to consciousness studies in some\nmodels. We report on extensive computational experiments that explore the\ninterrelations of the model's parameters (two probabilities and the threshold),\nhighlighting relevant scenarios of message traffic and how they impact the\nbehavior of total correlation as a function of $w$. We find that total\ncorrelation can occur at significant fractions of the maximum possible value\nand provide semi-analytical results on the message-traffic characteristics\nassociated with values of $w$ for which it peaks. We then reinterpret the\nmodel's parameters in terms of the current best estimates of some quantities\npertaining to cortical structure and dynamics. We find the resulting\npossibilities for best values of $w$ to be well aligned with the time frames\nwithin which percepts are thought to be processed and eventually rendered\nconscious.\n", "  Subdivergences constitute a major obstacle to the evaluation of Feynman\nintegrals and an expression in terms of finite quantities can be a considerable\nadvantage for both analytic and numeric calculations. We report on our\nimplementation of the suggestion by F. Brown and D. Kreimer, who proposed to\nuse a modified BPHZ scheme where all counterterms are single-scale integrals.\nPaired with parametric integration via hyperlogarithms, this method is\nparticularly well suited for the computation of renormalization group functions\nand easily automated. As an application of this approach we compute the 6-loop\nbeta function and anomalous dimensions of the $\\phi^4$ model.\n", "  We compute the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ in the case of\na static point source for multiscalar-tensor gravity with completely general\nnonderivative couplings and potential in the Jordan frame. Similarly to the\nsingle massive field case $\\gamma$ depends exponentially on the distance from\nthe source and is determined by the length of a vector of non-minimal coupling\nin the space of scalar fields and its orientation relative to the mass\neigenvectors. Using data from the Cassini tracking experiment, we estimate\nbounds on a general theory with two scalar fields. Our formalism can be\nutilized for a wide range of models, which we illustrate by applying it to\nnonminimally coupled Higgs SU(2) doublet, general hybrid metric-Palatini\ngravity, linear ($\\Box^{-1}$) and quadratic ($\\Box^{-2}$) nonlocal gravity.\n", "  We apply a recently advocated simulation scheme that employs a local\norder-parameter pinning field to study quantum critical phenomena in the\ntwo-dimensional square-lattice bilayer quantum Heisenberg model. Using a\nworld-line quantum Monte Carlo approach, we show that for this model, the\npinning-field approach allows to locate the quantum critical point over a wide\nrange of pinning-field strengths. However, the identification of the quantum\ncritical scaling behavior is found to be hard since the pinning field\nintroduces strong corrections to scaling. In order to further elucidate the\nscaling behavior in this situation, we also study an improved classical lattice\nmodel in the three-dimensional Ising universality class by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations on large lattice sizes, which allow us to employ refined\nfinite-size scaling considerations. A renormalization group analysis exhibits\nthe presence of an important crossover effect from the zero pinning-field to a\ncritical adsorption fixed point. In line with field-theoretical results, we\nfind that at the critical adsorption fixed point the short-distance expansion\nof the order-parameter profile exhibits a new universal critical exponent. This\nresult also implies the presence of slowly decaying scaling corrections, which\nwe analyze in detail.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal is a topologically non-trivial phase of matter that hosts\nmass-less Weyl fermions, the particles that remained elusive for more than 80\nyears since their theoretical discovery. The Weyl semimetals exhibit unique\ntransport and magneto-transport properties and remarkably high surface spin\npolarization. Here we show that a unique mesoscopic superconducting phase with\na critical temperature up to 7 K can be realized by forming metallic point\ncontacts with silver (Ag) on single crystals of TaAs, while neither Ag nor TaAs\nare superconductors. The Andreev reflection spectra obtained from such point\ncontacts are fitted well within a modified Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model\nwith a superconducting energy gap up to 1.2 meV. The analysis within this model\nalso reveals high transport spin polarization up to 60\\% indicating a spin\npolarized supercurrent flowing through the point contacts on TaAs. Such point\ncontacts also show a large anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) originating from\nthe spin polarized current. Therefore, apart from the discovery of a novel\nmesoscopic superconducting phase and it's coexistence with a large spin\npolarization, our results also show that the point contacts on Weyl semimetals\nare potentially important for applications in spintronics.\n", "  We study static properties and the dynamical structure factor of\nzero-temperature dilute bosons interacting via a soft-shoulder potential in one\ndimension. Our approach is fully microscopic and employs state-of-the-art\nquantum Monte Carlo and analytic continuation techniques. By increasing the\ninteraction strength, our model reproduces the Lieb-Liniger gas, the\nTonks-Girardeau and the Hard-Rods models.\n", "  We show how to transform a Dirac equation in curved spacetime into a Dirac\nequation in flat spacetime. In particular, we show that any solution of the\nfree massless Dirac equation in a 1+1 dimensional flat spacetime can be\ntransformed via a local phase transformation into a solution of the\ncorresponding Dirac equation in a curved background, where the spacetime metric\nis encoded into the phase. In this way, the existing quantum simulators of the\nDirac equation can naturally incorporate curved spacetimes. As a first example\nwe use our technique to obtain solutions of the Dirac equation in a particular\nfamily of interesting spacetimes in 1+1 dimensions.\n", "  A novel soliton-like solution in quantum electrodynamics is obtained via a\nself-consistent field method. By writing the Hamiltonian of quantum\nelectrodynamics in the Coulomb gauge, we separate out a classical component in\nthe density operator of the electron-positron field. Then, by modeling the\nstate vector in analogy with the theory of superconductivity, we minimize the\nfunctional for the energy of the system. This results in the equations of the\nself-consistent field, where the solutions are associated with the collective\nexcitation of the electron-positron field---the soliton-like solution. In\naddition, the canonical transformation of the variables allowed us to separate\nout the total momentum of the system and, consequently, to find the\nrelativistic energy dispersion relation for the moving soliton.\n", "  Existence and growth of amorphous order in supercooled liquids approaching\nglass transition is a subject of intense research. Even after decades of work,\nthere is still no clear consensus on the molecular mechanisms that lead to a\nrapid slowing down of liquid dynamics approaching this putative transition. The\nexistence of a correlation length associated with amorphous order has recently\nbeen postulated and also been estimated using multi-point correlation functions\nwhich cannot be calculated easily in experiments. Thus the study of growing\namorphous order remains mostly restricted to systems like colloidal glasses and\nsimulations of model glass-forming liquids. In this Letter, we propose an\nexperimentally realizable yet simple correlation function to study the growth\nof amorphous order. We then demonstrate the validity of this approach for a few\nwell-studied model supercooled liquids and obtain results which are consistent\nwith other conventional methods.\n", "  This letter presents a phenomenological analysis for the lepton ($l_i^{}$)\ndecaying into $ l_j^{} l_k^{} \\bar{l}_k^{}, l_j^{} \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ considering\nfamily non-universal couplings as source of the lepton flavor-violating (LFV)\ncurrents and a new neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) as mediator in the\nflavor-changing. The most viable $g_{V}^{f_if_J}$ and $g_{A}^{f_if_j}$\ncouplings are reported as long as derive new bounds for the $M_{Z'}^{}$ by\nusing current results from LHC and a phenomenological analysis.\n", "  The Distributional Exact Diagonalization (DED) scheme is applied to the\ndescription of Kondo physics in the Anderson impurity model. DED maps\nAnderson's problem of an interacting impurity level coupled to an infinite bath\nonto an ensemble of finite Anderson models, each of which can be solved by\nexact diagonalization. An approximation to the self-energy of the original\ninfinite model is then obtained from the ensemble averaged self-energy. Using\nFriedel's sum rule, we show that the particle number constraint, a central\ningredient of the DED scheme, ultimately imposes Fermi liquid behavior on the\nensemble averaged self-energy, and thus is essential for the description of\nKondo physics within DED. Using the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)\nmethod as a benchmark, we show that DED yields excellent spectra, both inside\nand outside the Kondo regime for a moderate number of bath sites. Only for very\nstrong correlations ($U/\\Gamma\\gg10$) does the number of bath sites needed to\nachieve good quantitative agreement become too large to be computationally\nfeasible.\n", "  We study the problem of deterministic transformations of an \\textit{initial}\npure entangled quantum state, $|\\psi\\rangle$, into a \\textit{target} pure\nentangled quantum state, $|\\phi\\rangle$, by using \\textit{local operations and\nclassical communication} (LOCC). A celebrated result of Nielsen [Phys. Rev.\nLett. \\textbf{83}, 436 (1999)] gives the necessary and sufficient condition\nthat makes this entanglement transformation process possible. Indeed, this\nprocess can be achieved if and only if the majorization relation $\\psi \\prec\n\\phi$ holds, where $\\psi$ and $\\phi$ are probability vectors obtained by taking\nthe squares of the Schmidt coefficients of the initial and target states,\nrespectively. In general, this condition is not fulfilled. However, one can\nlook for an \\textit{approximate} entanglement transformation. Vidal \\textit{et.\nal} [Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{62}, 012304 (2000)] have proposed a deterministic\ntransformation using LOCC in order to obtain a target state\n$|\\chi^\\mathrm{opt}\\rangle$ most approximate to $|\\phi\\rangle$ in terms of\nmaximal fidelity between them. Here, we show a strategy to deal with\napproximate entanglement transformations based on the properties of the\n\\textit{majorization lattice}. More precisely, we propose as approximate target\nstate one whose Schmidt coefficients are given by the supremum between $\\psi$\nand $\\phi$. Our proposal is inspired on the observation that fidelity does not\nrespect the majorization relation in general. Remarkably enough, we find that\nfor some particular interesting cases, like two-qubit pure states or the\nentanglement concentration protocol, both proposals are coincident.\n", "  We study localization of five-dimensional supersymmetric $U(1)$ gauge theory\non $\\mathbb{S}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}_{\\theta}^{2}$ where\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\theta}^{2}$ is a noncommutative (NC) plane. The theory can be\nisomorphically mapped to three-dimensional supersymmetric $U(N \\to \\infty)$\ngauge theory on $\\mathbb{S}^3$ using the matrix representation on a separable\nHilbert space on which NC fields linearly act. Therefore the NC space\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\theta}^{2}$ allows for a flexible path to derive matrix models\nvia localization from a higher-dimensional supersymmetric NC $U(1)$ gauge\ntheory. The result shows a rich duality between NC $U(1)$ gauge theories and\nlarge $N$ matrix models in various dimensions.\n", "  This paper describes a semiclassical field-theory approach to the topological\nproperties of spatially featureless Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki type valence\nbond solid ground states of antiferromagnets in spatial dimensions one to\nthree. Using nonlinear sigma models set in the appropriate target manifold and\naugmented with topological terms, we argue that the path integral\nrepresentation of the ground-state wave functional can correctly distinguish\nsymmetry-protected topological ground states from topologically trivial ones.\nThe symmetry-protection feature is demonstrated explicitly in terms of a dual\nfield theory, where we take into account the nontrivial spatial structure of\ntopological excitations, which are caused by competition among the relevant\nordering tendencies. A temporal surface contribution to the action originating\nfrom the bulk topological term plays a central role in our study. We discuss\nhow the same term governs the behavior of the so-called strange correlator. In\nparticular, we find that the path integral expression for the strange\ncorrelator in two dimensions reduces to the well-known Haldane expression for\nthe two point spin correlator of antiferromagnetic spin chains.\n", "  Marine stratocumulus cloud decks are regarded as the reflectors of the\nclimate system, returning back to space a significant part of the income solar\nradiation, thus cooling the atmosphere. Such clouds can exist in two stable\nmodes, open and closed cells, for a wide range of environmental conditions.\nThis emergent behavior of the system, and its sensitivity to aerosol and\nenvironmental properties, is captured by a set of nonlinear equations. Here,\nusing linear stability analysis, we express the transition from steady to a\nlimit-cycle state analytically, showing how it depends on the model parameters.\nWe show that the control of the droplet concentration (N) the environmental\ncarrying-capacity (H0) and the cloud recovery parameter (tau) can be linked by\na single nondimensional parameter mu=N/(alfa*tau*H0), suggesting that for\ndeeper clouds the transition from open (oscillating) to closed (stable fixed\npoint) cells will occur for higher droplet concentration (i.e. higher aerosol\nloading). The analytical calculations of the possible states, and how they are\naffected by changes in aerosol and the environmental variables, provide an\nenhanced understanding of the complex interactions of clouds and rain.\n", "  We present an improved version of the ECHO-QGP numerical code, which\nself-consistently includes for the first time the effects of electromagnetic\nfields within the framework of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We\ndiscuss results of its application in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the\nlimit of infinite electrical conductivity of the plasma. After reviewing the\nrelevant covariant $3\\!+\\!1$ formalisms, we illustrate the implementation of\nthe evolution equations in the code and show the results of several tests aimed\nat assessing the accuracy and robustness of the implementation. After providing\nsome estimates of the magnetic fields arising in non-central high-energy\nnuclear collisions, we perform full RMHD simulations of the evolution of the\nQuark-Gluon Plasma in the presence of electromagnetic fields and discuss the\nresults. In our ideal RMHD setup we find that the magnetic field developing in\nnon-central collisions does not significantly modify the elliptic-flow of the\nfinal hadrons. However, since there are uncertainties in the description of the\npre-equilibrium phase and also in the properties of the medium, a more\nextensive survey of the possible initial conditions as well as the inclusion of\ndissipative effects are indeed necessary to validate this preliminary result.\n", "  We study asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP) on a nonuniform\none-dimensional ring consisting of two segments having unequal hopping rates,\nor {\\em defects}. We allow weak particle nonconservation via Langmuir kinetics\n(LK), that are parameterised by generic unequal attachment and detachment\nrates. For an extended defect, in the thermodynamic limit the system\ngenerically displays inhomogeneous density profiles in the steady state - the\nfaster segment is either in a phase with spatially varying density having no\ndensity discontinuity, or a phase with a discontinuous density changes.\nNonequilibrium phase transitions between them are controlled by the\ninhomogeneity and LK. The slower segment displays only macroscopically uniform\nbulk density profiles in the steady states, reminiscent of the maximal current\nphase of TASEP but with a bulk density generally different from half. With a\npoint defect, there are low and high density spatially uniform phases as well,\nin addition to the inhomogeneous density profiles observed for an extended\ndefect. In all the cases, it is argued that the the mean particle density in\nthe steady state is controlled only by the ratio of the LK attachment and\ndetachment rates.\n", "  We study a setup where a single negatively-charged silicon-vacancy center in\ndiamond is magnetically coupled to a low-frequency mechanical bending mode and\nvia strain to the high-frequency phonon continuum of a semi-clamped diamond\nbeam. We show that under appropriate microwave driving conditions, this setup\ncan be used to induce a laser cooling like effect for the low-frequency\nmechanical vibrations, where the high-frequency longitudinal compression modes\nof the beam serve as an intrinsic low-temperature reservoir. We evaluate the\nexperimental conditions under which cooling close to the quantum ground state\ncan be achieved and describe an extended scheme for the preparation of a\nstationary entangled state between two mechanical modes. By relying on\nintrinsic properties of the mechanical beam only, this approach offers an\ninteresting alternative for quantum manipulation schemes of mechanical systems,\nwhere otherwise efficient optomechanical interactions are not available.\n", "  We study the mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) boron, borophenes,\nby first-principles calculations. The recently synthesized borophene with 1/6\nconcentration of hollow hexagons (HH) is shown to have in-plane modulus C up to\n210 N/m and bending stiffness as low as D = 0.39 eV. Thus, its Foppl-von Karman\nnumber per unit area, defined as C/D, reaches 568 nm-2, over twofold higher\nthan graphene's value, establishing the borophene as one of the most flexible\nmaterials. Yet, the borophene has a specific modulus of 346 m2/s2 and ideal\nstrengths of 16 N/m, rivaling those (453 m2/s2 and 34 N/m) of graphene. In\nparticular, its structural fluxionality enabled by delocalized multi-center\nchemical bonding favors structural phase transitions under tension, which\nresult in exceptionally small breaking strains yet highly ductile breaking\nbehavior. These mechanical properties can be further tailored by varying the HH\nconcentration, and the boron sheet without HHs can even be stiffer than\ngraphene against tension. The record high flexibility combined with excellent\nelasticity in boron sheets can be utilized for designing composites and\nflexible systems.\n", "  Collective pair conversion $\\nu_e\\bar\\nu_e\\leftrightarrow \\nu_{x}\\bar\\nu_{x}$\nby forward scattering, where $x=\\mu$ or $\\tau$, may be generic for supernova\nneutrino transport. Depending on the local angular intensity of the electron\nlepton number carried by neutrinos, the conversion rate is \"fast,\" i.e., of the\norder of $\\sqrt{2}G_{\\rm{F}}(n_{\\nu_e}{-}\\,n_{\\bar\\nu_e})\\gg\\Delta m^2_{\\rm\natm}/2E$. We present a novel approach to understand these phenomena: A\ndispersion relation for the frequency and wave number $(\\Omega,\\bf{K})$ of\ndisturbances in the mean field of $\\nu_e\\nu_x$ flavor coherence. Run-away\nsolutions occur in \"dispersion gaps,\" i.e., in \"forbidden\" intervals of\n$\\Omega$ and/or $\\bf{K}$ where propagating plane waves do not exist. We stress\nthat the actual solutions also depend on the initial and/or boundary conditions\nwhich need to be further investigated.\n", "  Hi'iaka is the larger outer satellite of the dwarf planet Haumea. Using\nrelative photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope and Magellan and a phase\ndispersion minimization analysis, we have identified the rotation period of\nHi'iaka to be ~9.8 hrs (double-peaked). This is ~120 times faster than its\norbital period, creating new questions about the formation of this system and\npossible tidal evolution. The rapid rotation suggests that Hi'iaka could have a\nsignificant obliquity and spin precession that could be visible in light curves\nwithin a few years. We then turn to an investigation of what we learn about the\n(presently unclear) formation of the Haumea system and family based on this\nunexpectedly rapid rotation rate. We explore the importance of the initial\nsemi-major axis and rotation period in tidal evolution theory and find they\nstrongly influence the time required to despin to synchronous rotation,\nrelevant to understanding a wide variety of satellite and binary systems. We\nfind that despinning tides do not necessarily lead to synchronous spin periods\nfor Hi'iaka, even if it formed near the Roche limit. Therefore the short\nrotation period of Hi'iaka does not rule out significant tidal evolution.\nHi'iaka's spin period is also consistent with formation near its current\nlocation and spin up due to Haumea-centric impactors.\n", "  The present work deals with a kinematic approach to the modelling the late\ntime dynamics of the universe. This approach is based upon the assumption of\nconstant value of cosmological jerk parameter, which is the dimensionless\nrepresentation of the 3rd order time derivative of the scale factor. For the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, the value of jerk parameter is -1 throughout the evolution\nhistory. Now any model dependent estimation of the value of the jerk parameter\nwould indicate the deviation of the model from the cosmological constant. In\nthe present work, it has also been shown that for a constant jerk parameter\nmodel, any deviation of its value from -1 would not allow the dark matter to\nhave an independent conservation, thus indicating towards an interaction\nbetween dark matter and dark energy. Statistical analysis with different\nobservational data sets (namely the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD),\nthe type Ia supernova data (SNe), and the baryon acoustic oscillation data\n(BAO)) lead to a well constrained values of the jerk parameter and the model\nremains at a very close proximity of the $\\Lambda$CDM. The possibility of\ninteraction is found to be more likely at high redshift rather than at present\nepoch.\n", "  We present the group-thoretical classification of gap functions in\nsuperconductors coexisting with some magnetic order in non-symmorphic magnetic\nspace groups. Based on the weak-coupling BCS theory, we show that UCoGe-type\nferromagnetic superconductors must have horizontal line nodes on either $k_z=0$\nor $\\pm\\pi/c$ plane. Moreover, it is likely that additional Weyl point nodes\nexist at the axial point. On the other hand, in UPd$_2$Al$_3$-type\nantiferromagnetic superconductors, gap functions with $A_g$ symmetry possess\nhorizontal line nodes in antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone boundary\nperpendicular to $c$-axis. In other words, the conventional fully-gapped\n$s$-wave superconductivity is forbidden in this type of antiferromagnetic\nsuperconductors, irrelevant to the pairing mechanism, as long as the Fermi\nsurface crosses a zone boundary. UCoGe and UPd$_2$Al$_3$ are candidates for\nunconventional superconductors possessing hidden symmetry-protected line nodes,\npeculiar to non-symmorphic magnetic space groups.\n", "  We consider the problem of designing a variety of \"system guided\" basis sets\nfor quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillators. Using ideas based on\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics, we design canonical transformations of the\nusual position and momentum to generate generalized \"Cartesian-like positions,\nW and momenta, p_W\" with unit Poisson brackets. These are quantized following\nDirac, leading to an infinite family of potential \"operator observables\". The\nfundamental issue is that all but one of the operators are not Hermitian\n(formally self-adjoint) in the original position representation. We show that\nthe resulting operators are \"quasi-Hermitian\" relative to the x-representation\nand that all are Hermitian in the W-representation. Depending on how one treats\nthe Jacobian of the canonical transformation in the expression for the\nclassical momentum, p_W, quantization yields a) continuous mutually unbiased\nbases (MUB) b) orthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) c)\nbiorthogonal bases (with Dirac delta normalization) d) new W-harmonic\noscillators yielding standard orthonormal bases (as functions of W) and\nassociated coherent states. The MUB include W-generalized Fourier transform\nkernels whose eigenvectors are the W-harmonic oscillator eigenstates, with the\nspectrum (p/m i, p/m i). The W, p_W satisfy the uncertainty product relation:\nDelta-W * Delta-p_W gte 1/2.\n", "  We study the Ising Hamiltonian with a transverse field term to simulate the\nquantum annealing. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design the time\ndependence of the Hamiltonian. The dynamical invariant is obtained by the\nmean-field ansatz, and the Hamiltonian is designed by the inverse engineering.\nWe show that the time dependence of physical quantities such as the\nmagnetization is independent of the speed of the Hamiltonian variation in the\ninfinite-range model. We also show that rotating transverse magnetic fields are\nuseful to achieve the ideal time evolution.\n", "  We consider strings living in $AdS_3\\times S^3\\times S^3\\times S^1$ with\nnonzero $B$-field. By using specific ansatz for the string embedding, we obtain\na class of solutions corresponding to strings moving in the whole ten\ndimensional space-time. For the $AdS_3$ subspace, these solutions are given in\nterms of incomplete elliptic integrals. For the two three-spheres, they are\nexpressed in terms of Lauricella hypergeometric functions of many variables.\nThe conserved charges, i.e. the string energy, spin and angular momenta, are\nalso found.\n", "  We present the 3.5-yr monitoring results of 225 GHz opacity at the summit of\nthe Greenland ice sheet (Greenland Summit Camp) at an altitude of 3200 m using\na tipping radiometer. We chose this site as our submillimeter telescope\n(Greenland Telescope; GLT) site, because its location offers favorable\nbaselines to existing submillimeter telescopes for global-scale VLBI. The site\nshows a clear seasonal variation with the average opacity lower by a factor of\ntwo during winter. For the winter quartiles of 25% and 50%, the Greenland site\nis about 10%-30% worse than the ALMA or the South Pole sites. Estimated\natmospheric transmission spectra in winter season are similar to the ALMA site\nat lower frequencies (<450 GHz), which are transparent enough to perform\nastronomical observations almost all of the winter time with opacities <0.5,\nbut 10%-25% higher opacities at higher frequencies (>450 GHz) than those at the\nALMA site. This is due to the lower altitude of the Greenland site.\nNevertheless, half of the winter time at the Greenland site can be used for\nastronomical observations at frequencies between 450 GHz and 1000 GHz with\nopacities <1.2, and 10% of the time show >10% transmittance in the THz (1035\nGHz, 1350 GHz, and 1500 GHz) windows. One major advantage of the Greenland site\nin winter is that there is no diurnal variation due to the polar night\ncondition, and therefore the durations of low-opacity conditions are\nsignificantly longer than at the ALMA site. Opacities lower than 0.05 or 0.04\ncan continue for more than 100 hours. Such long stable opacity conditions do\nnot occur as often even at the South Pole; it happens only for the opacity\nlower than 0.05. Since the opacity variation is directly related to the sky\ntemperature (background) variation, the Greenland site is suitable for\nastronomical observations that need unusually stable sky background.\n", "  Domain walls are the topological defects that mediate polarization reversal\nin ferroelectrics, and they may exhibit quite different geometric and\nelectronic structures compared to the bulk. Therefore, a detailed atomic-scale\nunderstanding of the static and dynamic properties of domain walls is of\npressing interest. In this work, we use first-principles methods to study the\nstructures of $180^{\\circ}$ domain walls, both in their relaxed state and along\nthe ferroelectric reversal pathway, in ferroelectrics belonging to the family\nof corundum derivatives. Our calculations predict their orientation, formation\nenergy, and migration energy, and also identify important couplings between\npolarization, magnetization, and chirality at the domain walls. Finally, we\npoint out a strong empirical correlation between the height of the domain-wall\nmediated polarization reversal barrier and the local bonding environment of the\nmobile $A$ cations as measured by bond valence sums. Our results thus provide\nboth theoretical and empirical guidance to future searches for ferroelectric\ncandidates in materials of the corundum derivative family.\n", "  The UV photon escape fraction from molecular clouds is a key parameter for\nunderstanding the ionization of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), and\nextragalactic processes, such as cosmic reionization. We present the ionizing\nphoton flux and the corresponding photon escape fraction (f$_{esc}$) arising as\na consequence of star cluster formation in a turbulent, 10$^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ GMC,\nsimulated using the code FLASH. We make use of sink particles to represent\nyoung, star-forming clusters coupled with a radiative transfer scheme to\ncalculate the emergent UV flux. We find that the ionizing photon flux across\nthe cloud boundary is highly variable in time and space due to the turbulent\nnature of the intervening gas. The escaping photon fraction remains at $\\sim$5%\nfor the first 2.5 Myr, followed by two pronounced peaks at 3.25 and 3.8 Myr\nwith a maximum f$_{esc}$ of 30% and 37%, respectively. These peaks are due to\nthe formation of large HII regions, that expand into regions of lower density\nand some of which reach the cloud surface. However, these phases are short\nlived and f$_{esc}$ drops sharply as the HII regions are quenched by the\ncentral cluster passing through high-density material due to the turbulent\nnature of the cloud. We find an average f$_{esc}$ of 15% with factor of two\nvariations over 1 Myr timescales. Our results suggest that assuming a single\nvalue for f$_{esc}$ from a molecular cloud is in general a poor approximation,\nand that the dynamical evolution of the system leads to large temporal\nvariation.\n", "  We employ the process of non-degenerate four-wave mixing Bragg scattering\n(FWM-BS) to demonstrate all-optical control in a silicon platform. In our\nconfiguration, a strong, non-information-carrying pump is mixed with a weak\ncontrol pump and an input signal in a silicon-on-insulator waveguide. Through\nthe optical nonlinearity of this highly-confining waveguide, the weak pump\ncontrols the wavelength conversion process from the signal to an idler, leading\nto a controlled depletion of the signal. The strong pump, on the other hand,\nplays the role of a constant bias. In this work, we show experimentally that it\nis possible to implement this low-power switching technique as a first step\ntowards universal optical logic gates, and test the performance with random\nbinary data. Even at very low powers, where the signal and control pump levels\nare almost equal, the eye-diagrams remain open, indicating a successful\noperation of the logic gates.\n", "  The dependence of the test function on the phenomenological parameters used\nin the \"NAV\" (\"New Algol Variable\") algorithm (Andronov, 2012Ap.....55..536A)\nis studied. Due to a presence of local minima, the method of minimization\ncontains two steps: the \"brute force\" minimization at a grid in the 4D\nparameter space, and further iterations using the differential corrections.\nThis method represents an effective approximation of the light curve using the\nspecial pattern (shape) separately for the primary and secondary minima. The\napplication of the method to concrete stars is briefly reviewed.\n", "  We review a large body of predictions obtained within the framework of\nrelativistic meson theory together with the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\napproach to nuclear matter and finite nuclei. The success of this method has\nbeen largely related to its ability to take into account important three-body\neffects. Therefore, the overarching theme of this article is the interpretation\nof the so-called \"Dirac effects\" as an effective three-nucleon force. We\naddress the equation of state of isospin symmetric and asymmetric nucleonic\nmatter and related issues, ranging from proton and neutron density\ndistributions to momentum distributions and short-range correlations. A central\npart of the discussion is devoted to the optical model potential for\nnucleon-nucleus scattering. We also take the opportunity to explore\nsimilarities and differences with predictions based on the increasingly popular\nchiral effective field theory.\n", "  In this paper, a charged black hole in de Sitter space considered and\nlogarithmic corrected entropy used to study thermodynamics. Logarithmic\ncorrections of entropy comes from thermal fluctuations which play role of\nquantum loop corrections. In that case we are able to study the effect of\nquantum loop on the black hole thermodynamics and statistics. As black hole is\na gravitational object, so it helps to obtain some information about the\nquantum gravity. The first and second laws of thermodynamics investigated for\nlogarithmic corrected case and find that is only valid for the charged dS black\nhole. We show that the black hole phase transition disappear in presence of\nlogarithmic correction.\n", "  The mass of the Local Group (LG) is a crucial parameter for galaxy formation\ntheories. However, its observational determination is challenging - its mass\nbudget is dominated by dark matter which cannot be directly observed. To meet\nthis end the posterior distributions of the LG and its massive constituents\nhave been constructed by means of constrained and random cosmological\nsimulations. Two priors are assumed - the LCDM model that is used to set up the\nsimulations and a LG model,which encodes the observational knowledge of the LG\nand is used to select LG-like objects from the simulations. The constrained\nsimulations are designed to reproduce the local cosmography as it is imprinted\nonto the Cosmicflows-2 database of velocities. Several prescriptions are used\nto define the LG model, focusing in particular on different recent estimates of\nthe tangential velocity of M31. It is found that (a) different $v_{tan}$\nchoices affect the peak mass values up to a factor of 2, and change mass ratios\nof $M_{M31}$ to $M_{MW}$ by up to 20%; (b) constrained simulations yield more\nsharply peaked posterior distributions compared with the random ones; (c) LG\nmass estimates are found to be smaller than those found using the timing\nargument; (d) preferred MW masses lie in the range of $(0.6 - 0.8)\\times10^{12}\nM_{\\odot}$ whereas (e) $M_{M31}$ is found to vary between $(1.0 -\n2.0)\\times10^{12} M_{\\odot}$, with a strong dependence on the $v_{tan}$ values\nused.\n", "  We present here our observations and analysis of the dayside emission\nspectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-103b. We observed WASP-103b during secondary\neclipse using two visits of the Hubble Space Telescope with the G141 grism on\nWide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. We generated secondary eclipse light\ncurves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned\nwavechannels from 1.1-1.7 micron and corrected the light curves for flux\ncontamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics\nand secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that\nthe near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed\nnear-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope\ntowards the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T_B =\n2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is\nindistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically\nisothermal system, i.e. pseudo-isothermal. A Solar-metallicity profile with a\nthermal inversion layer at 10^-2 bar fits WASP-103b's spectrum with high\nconfidence, as do an isothermal profile with Solar metallicity and a\nmonotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O>1. The data rule out a\nmonotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with Solar composition, and we\nrule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as non-physical for this system.\nThe pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer\njust above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the\nupper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to\nbetter differentiate between potential atmospheric models.\n", "  We consider electronic transport through a single-electron quantum dot that\nis tunnel-coupled to an electronic lead and a metallic island. A background\nreservoir keeps the metallic island at a thermal state with the ambient\ntemperature, while the charge accumulated on the island is reflected in a\ntime-dependent chemical potential. Without feedback, a current would flow\nthrough the system until the chemical potentials of island and lead are\nequilibrated. A feedback loop can be implemented by a quantum point contact\ndetecting the dot state, classical processing of the result and appropriate\nfeedback actions on the electronic tunneling rates taken, with the objective to\ndirect the current in a preferred direction. Since we directly take the\ndetector counting statistics into account, this automatically includes\nmeasurement errors in the description. When mainly the rates are modified but\nhardly any energy is exchanged with the system, this feedback loop effectively\nimplements a Maxwell demon, capable of transporting electrons against an\nelectric bias and thereby charging the metallic island. Once the feedback\nprotocol is stopped, the metallic island simply discharges. We find that a\nquantitative detector model may be useful for a realistic statistical\ndescription of feedback loops.\n", "  We study the dynamic pressure in an irrotational solitary wave propagating at\nthe surface of water over a flat bed, under the influence of gravity. We\nconsider the nonlinear regime, that is, the case of waves of moderate to large\namplitude. We prove that, independently of the wave amplitude, the maximum of\nthe dynamic pressure is attained at the wave crest, while its minimum is\nattained at infinity.\n", "  Enhanced colloidal transport beyond the limit imposed by diffusion is usually\nachieved through external fields. Here, we demonstrate the ballistic transport\nof a colloidal sphere using internal sources of energy provided by an attached\nactive filament. The latter is modeled as a chain of chemo-mechanically active\nbeads connected by potentials that enforce semi-flexibility and self-avoidance.\nThe fluid flow produced by the active beads and the forces they mediate are\nexplicitly taken into account in the overdamped equations of motion describing\nthe colloid-filament assembly. The speed and efficiency of transport depend on\nthe dynamical conformational states of the filament. We characterize these\nstates using filament writhe as an order parameter and identify ones yielding\nmaxima in speed and efficiency of transport. The transport mechanism reported\nhere has a remarkable resemblance to the flagellar propulsion of microorganisms\nwhich suggests its utility in biomimetic systems.\n", "  Directed transport of self-propelled particles is numerically investigated in\na three-dimensional asymmetric potential. Beside the steric repulsive forces,\nhydrodynamic interactions between particles have been taken into account in an\napproximate way. From numerical simulations, we find that hydrodynamic\ninteractions can strongly affect the rectified transport of self-propelled\nparticles. Hydrodynamic interactions enhance the performance of the rectified\ntransport when particles can easily pass across the barrier of the potential,\nand reduce the rectified transport when particles are mainly trapped in the\npotential well.\n", "  Over the last 23 years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has\nrequired over 34,000 companies to file over 165,000 annual reports. These\nreports, the so-called \"Form 10-Ks,\" contain a characterization of a company's\nfinancial performance and its risks, including the regulatory environment in\nwhich a company operates. In this paper, we analyze over 4.5 million references\nto U.S. Federal Acts and Agencies contained within these reports to build a\nmean-field measurement of temperature and diversity in this regulatory\necosystem, where companies are organisms inhabiting the regulatory environment.\nWhile individuals across the political, economic, and academic world frequently\nrefer to trends in this regulatory ecosystem, far less attention has been paid\nto supporting such claims with large-scale, longitudinal data. In this paper,\nwe document an increase in the regulatory energy per filing, i.e., a warming\n\"temperature.\" We also find that the diversity of the regulatory ecosystem has\nbeen increasing over the past two decades, as measured by the dimensionality of\nthe regulatory space and distance between the \"regulatory bitstrings\" of\ncompanies. These findings support the claim that regulatory activity and\ncomplexity are increasing, and this measurement framework contributes an\nimportant step towards improving academic and policy discussions around legal\ncomplexity and regulation.\n", "  Individual Kekule valence structures of biphenylene and related hydrocarbons\nare treated perturbatively by modelling them as sets of weakly-interacting\nuniform double bonds. Total pi-electron energies of these structures are then\nexpressed in the form of power series with respect to the resonance parameter\nof uniform single bonds. On this basis, the Kekule structures concerned are\nordered according to their relative stabilities and thereby importances when\nbuilding up the actual electronic structures. To rationalize the results,\ninterrelations are sought between separate members of the power series, on the\none hand, and presence of definite substructures in the given Kekule structure,\non the other hand. It is shown that monocycles containing two and four\nexocyclic methylene groups participate in the formation of energy corrections\nof the relevant Kekule valence structures along with the usual rings consisting\nof uniform double and single bonds alternately and known as conjugated\ncircuits. An extension of the empirical Fries rule to the case of\nbiphenylene-like hydrocarbons is consequently formulated that embraces\nmonocycles of the above-specified types. The reasons are also discussed why the\nresults of the usual theory of conjugated circuits are less satisfactory for\nphenylenes as compared to benzenoids.\n", "  For various species of biological cells, experimental observations indicate\nthe existence of universal distributions of the cellular size, scaling\nrelations between the cell-size moments and simple rules for the cell-size\ncontrol. We address a class of models for the control of cell division, and\npresent the steady state distributions. By introducing concepts such as\neffective force and potential, we are able to address the appearance of scaling\ncollapse of different distributions and the connection between various moments\nof the cell-size. Our approach allows us to derive strict bounds which a\npotential cell-size control scenario must meet in order to yield a steady state\ndistribution. The so-called \"adder\" model for cell-size control exhibits the\nweakest control that still enables the existence of stable size distribution, a\nfact that might explain the relative \"popularity\" of this scenario for\ndifferent cells.\n", "  We report on electrical transport properties of epitaxial Ba(Fe1-xNix)2As2\nthin films grown by pulsed laser deposition in static magnetic fields up to 35\nT. The thin film shows a critical temperature of 17.2 K and a critical current\ndensity of 5.7x10^5 A/cm^2 in self field at 4.2 K while the pinning is\ndominated by elastic pinning at two-dimensional nonmagnetic defects. Compared\nto single-crystal data, we find a higher slope of the upper critical field for\nthe thin film at a similar doping level and a small anisotropy. Also an unusual\nsmall vortex liquid phase was observed at low temperatures, which is a striking\ndifference to Co-doped BaFe2As2 thin films.\n", "  Deuteride phases in the zirconium-deuterium system in the temperature range\n25-286$\\celsius$ have been studied in-situ by high resolution neutron\ndiffraction. The study primarily focused on observations of $\\delta \\rightarrow\n\\gamma$ transformation at 180$\\celsius$, and the peritectoid reaction $\\alpha +\n\\delta \\leftrightarrow \\gamma$ at 255$\\celsius$ in commercial grade Zr powder\nthat was deuterated to a deuterium/Zr ratio of one to one. A detailed\ndescription of the zirconium deuteride preparation route by high temperature\ngas loading is also described. The lattice parameters of $\\alpha$-Zr,\n$\\delta$-ZrD$_x$ and $\\epsilon$-ZrD$_x$ were determined by whole pattern\ncrystal structure analysis, using Rietveld and Pawley refinements, and are in\ngood agreement with values reported in the literature. The controversial\n$\\gamma$-hydride phase was observed both in-situ and ex-situ in deuterated Zr\npowder after a heat treatment at 286$\\celsius$ and slow cooling.\n", "  The objective of the present work is to construct a sound mathematical,\nnumerical and computational framework relevant to blood flow simulations and to\nassess it through a careful validation against experimental data. We perform\nsimulations of a benchmark proposed by the FDA for fluid flow in an idealized\nmedical device, under different flow regimes. The results are evaluated using\nmetrics proposed in the literature and the findings are in very good agreement\nwith the validation experiment.\n", "  The short coherence lengths characteristic of low-dimensional superconductors\nare associated with usefully high critical fields or temperatures.\nUnfortunately, such materials are often sensitive to disorder and suffer from\nphase fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter which diverge with\ntemperature $T$, magnetic field $H$ or current $I$. We propose an approach to\novercome synthesis and fluctuation problems: building superconductors from\ninhomogeneous composites of nanofilaments. Macroscopic crystals of\nquasi-one-dimensional Na$_{2-\\delta}$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ featuring Na vacancy disorder\n($\\delta\\approx$~0.2) are shown to behave as percolative networks of\nsuperconducting nanowires. Long range order is established via transverse\ncoupling between individual one-dimensional filaments, yet phase coherence\nremains unstable to fluctuations and localization in the zero-($T$,$H$,$I$)\nlimit. However, a region of reentrant phase coherence develops upon raising\n($T$,$H$,$I$). We attribute this phenomenon to an enhancement of the transverse\ncoupling due to electron delocalization. Our observations of reentrant phase\ncoherence coincide with a peak in the Josephson energy $E_J$ at non-zero\n($T$,$H$,$I$), which we estimate using a simple analytical model for a\ndisordered anisotropic superconductor. Na$_{2-\\delta}$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ is therefore\na blueprint for a future generation of nanofilamentary superconductors with\ninbuilt resilience to phase fluctuations at elevated ($T$,$H$,$I$).\n", "  In this paper, granular segregation in a two-compartment cell in zero gravity\nis studied numerically by DEM simulation. In the simulation using a virtual\nwindow method we find a non-monotonic flux, a function which governs the\nsegregation. A parameter is used to quantify the segregation. The effect of\nthree parameters: the total number of particles N, the excitation strength\n{\\Gamma}, and the position of the window coupling the two compartments, on the\nsegregation {\\epsilon} and the waiting time {\\tau} are investigated. It is\nfound that the segregation observed in zero gravity exists and does not depend\non the excitation strength {\\Gamma}. The waiting time {\\tau}, however, depends\nstrongly on {\\Gamma}: Higher the {\\Gamma}, lower the waiting time {\\tau}. The\nsimulation results are important in guiding the SJ-10 satellite microgravity\nexperiments.\n", "  Relativistic rigid motion suggests a new version for the so-called `twin\nparadox', comparing the ages of two astronauts on a very long spaceship.\nAlthough there is always an instantaneous inertial frame in which the whole\nspaceship, being rigid, is simultaneously at rest, the twins' ages, measured as\nthe proper-times along their individual world lines, are different when they\nare located at remote parts of the spaceship. The age, or proper-time,\ndifference depends on the distance at rest between the astronauts and the\nrapidity difference between start to end. The relation of the age difference\nwith the relative Doppler shift of light signals transmitted between the\nastronauts, and implications for the possibility to assign common age\n(proper-time) to complex, spatially extended, relativistic systems, are also\ndiscussed. The condition for simultaneous arrival of light signals emitted\nsimultaneously from the opposite ends of a rigidly accelerating spaceship is\nresolved.\n", "  We report on multilayer high efficiency antireflection coating (ARC) design\nand development for use at UV wavelengths on CCDs and other Si-based detectors.\nWe have previously demonstrated a set of single-layer coatings, which achieve\n>50% quantum efficiency (QE) in four bands from 130 to 300 nm. We now present\nmultilayer coating designs that significantly outperform our previous work\nbetween 195 and 215 nm. Using up to 11 layers, we present several model designs\nto reach QE above 80%. We also demonstrate the successful performance of 5 and\n11 layer ARCs on silicon and fused silica substrates. Finally, we present a\nfive-layer coat- ing deposited onto a thinned, delta-doped CCD and demonstrate\nexternal QE greater than 60% between 202 and 208 nm, with a peak of 67.6% at\n206 nm.\n", "  The asteroid (16) Psyche is of scientific interest because it contains ~ 1%\nof the total mass of the asteroid belt and is thought to be the remnant\nmetallic core of a protoplanet. Radar observations have indicated the\nsignificant presence of metal on the surface with a small percentage of\nsilicates. Prior ground-based observations showed rotational variations in the\nnear-infrared (NIR) spectra and radar albedo of this asteroid. However, no\ncomprehensive study that combines multi-wavelength data has been conducted so\nfar. Here we present rotationally resolved NIR spectra (0.7-2.5 microns) of\n(16) Psyche obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. These data have\nbeen combined with shape models of the asteroid for each rotation phase.\nSpectral band parameters extracted from the NIR spectra show that the pyroxene\nband center varies from ~ 0.92 to 0.94 microns. Band center values were used to\ncalculate the pyroxene chemistry of the asteroid, whose average value was found\nto be Fs30En65Wo5. Variations in the band depth were also observed, with values\nranging from 1.0 to 1.5%. Using a new laboratory spectral calibration we\nestimated an average orthopyroxene content of 6+/-1%. The mass-deficit region\nof Psyche, which exhibits the highest radar albedo, also shows the highest\nvalue for spectral slope and the minimum band depth. The spectral\ncharacteristics of Psyche suggest that its parent body did not have the typical\nstructure expected for a differentiated body or that the sequence of events\nthat led to its current state was more complex than previously thought.\n", "  Inspired by a recently proposed GUT model based on the trinification\n($\\mathrm{SU}(3)^3$) gauge group with a global family ($\\mathrm{SU}(3)_F$)\nsymmetry, we consider an effective low-energy three Higgs doublet model that\nmay shed light on what underlies the observed fermion mass hierarchies and CKM\nmixing. We discuss possibilities for charged scalars coming from this model to\nshow in collider experiments and show some interesting benchmark points.\n", "  We present a catalogue of candidate H{\\alpha} emission and absorption line\nsources and blue objects in the Galactic Bulge Survey (GBS) region. We use a\npoint source catalogue of the GBS fields (two strips of (l x b) = (6 x 1)\ndegrees centred at b = 1.5 above and below the Galactic centre), covering the\nmagnitude range 16 < r' < 22.5. We utilize (r'-i', r'-H{\\alpha}) colour-colour\ndiagrams to select H{\\alpha} emission and absorption line candidates, and also\nidentify blue objects (compared to field stars) using the r'-i' colour index.\nWe identify 1337 H{\\alpha} emission line candidates and 336 H{\\alpha}\nabsorption line candidates. These catalogues likely contain a plethora of\nsources, ranging from active (binary) stars, early-type emission line objects,\ncataclysmic variables (CVs) and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to background\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). The 389 blue objects we identify are likely\nsystems containing a compact object, such as CVs, planetary nebulae and LMXBs.\nHot subluminous dwarfs (sdO/B stars) are also expected to be found as blue\noutliers. Crossmatching our outliers with the GBS X-ray catalogue yields\nsixteen sources, including seven (magnetic) CVs and one qLMXB candidate among\nthe emission line candidates, and one background AGN for the absorption line\ncandidates. One of the blue outliers is a high state AM CVn system.\nSpectroscopic observations combined with the multi-wavelength coverage of this\narea, including X-ray, ultraviolet and (time-resolved) optical and infrared\nobservations, can be used to further constrain the nature of individual\nsources.\n", "  The Asteroid Belt is characterized by the radial mixing of bodies with\ndifferent physical properties, a very low mass compared to Minimum Mass Solar\nNebula expectations and has an excited orbital distribution. Models of the\nevolution of the Asteroid Belt show that the origin of its structure is\nstrongly linked to the process of terrestrial planet formation. The Grand Tack\nmodel presents a possible solution to the conundrum of reconciling the small\nmass of Mars with the properties of the Asteroid Belt, including the mass\ndepletion, radial mixing and orbital excitation. However, while the inclination\ndistribution produced in the Grand Tack model is in good agreement with the one\nobserved, the eccentricity distribution is skewed towards values larger than\nthose found today. Here, we evaluate the evolution of the orbital properties of\nthe Asteroid Belt from the end of the Grand Tack model (at the end of the gas\nnebula phase when planets emerge from the dispersing gas disk), throughout the\nsubsequent evolution of the Solar System including an instability of the Giant\nPlanets approximately 400 My later. Before the instability, the terrestrial\nplanets were modeled on dynamically cold orbits with Jupiter and Saturn locked\nin a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The model continues for an additional 4.1 Gy\nafter the giant planet instability. Our results show that the eccentricity\ndistribution obtained in the Grand Tack model evolves towards one very similar\nto that currently observed, and the semimajor axis distribution does the same.\nThe inclination distribution remains nearly unchanged with a slight preference\nfor depletion at low inclination; this leads to the conclusion that the\ninclination distribution at the end of the Grand Tack is a bit over-excited.\n", "  We investigate, using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, the fragmentation of\npressure-confined, vertically stratified, self-gravitating gaseous layers. The\nconfining pressure is either thermal pressure acting on both surfaces, or\nthermal pressure acting on one surface and ram-pressure on the other. In the\nlinear regime of fragmentation, the dispersion relation we obtain agrees well\nwith that derived by Elmegreen & Elmegreen (1978), and consequently deviates\nfrom the dispersion relations based on the thin shell approximation (Vishniac\n1983) or pressure assisted gravitational instability (W\\\"unsch et al. 2010). In\nthe non-linear regime, the relative importance of the confining pressure to the\nself-gravity is a crucial parameter controlling the qualitative course of\nfragmentation. When confinement of the layer is dominated by external pressure,\nself- gravitating condensations are delivered by a two-stage process: first the\nlayer fragments into gravitationally bound but stable clumps, and then these\nclumps coalesce until they assemble enough mass to collapse. In contrast, when\nexternal pressure makes a small contribution to confinement of the layer, the\nlayer fragments monolithically into gravitationally unstable clumps and there\nis no coalescence. This dichotomy persists whether the external pressure is\nthermal or ram. We apply these results to fragments forming in a shell swept up\nby an expanding H II region, and find that, unless the swept up gas is quite\nhot or the surrounding medium has low density, the fragments have low-mass ( ~<\n3 M_Sun ), and therefore they are unlikely to spawn stars that are sufficiently\nmassive to promote sequential self-propagating star formation.\n", "  Measurements of parity-violating asymmetries in DIS region using the SoLID\nspectrometer at Jefferson Lab (JLab) Hall A in the 12 GeV era are presented. A\nproposal with a polarized electron beam on unpolarized deuteron and proton\ntargets has been approved with an A rating by the JLab PAC. The deuteron\nmeasurement aims to measure the weak mixing angle $\\sin^2 \\theta_W $ with a\nprecision of $\\pm$ 0.0006 as well as to access the fundamental coupling\nconstants $C_{2q}$ with a high precision. This measurement is ideally suited\nfor testing the Standard Model with the potential to probe charge symmetry\nviolation and resolve the quark-quark correlations in the DIS region. The\nproton experiment provides a clean measurement of $d/u$ ratio in the high-$x$\nregion free of nuclear corrections. To achieve these goals, the SoLID\nspectrometer was proposed and designed to handle a high luminosity with a large\nacceptance. In this article, the details of the approved measurements are\ndiscussed, along with new ideas with PVDIS using a polarized $^3$He target to\naccess new $\\gamma-Z$ interference polarized structure functions and a\nunpolarized $^{48}$Ca target to study the EMC effect.\n", "  By formally invoking the Wiener-Hopf method, we explicitly solve a\none-dimensional, singular integral equation for the excitation of a slowly\ndecaying electromagnetic wave, called surface plasmon-polariton (SPP), of small\nwavelength on a semi-infinite, flat conducting sheet irradiated by a plane wave\nin two spatial dimensions. This setting is germane to wave diffraction by edges\nof large sheets of single-layer graphene. Our analytical approach includes: (i)\nformulation of a functional equation in the Fourier domain; (ii) evaluation of\na split function, which is expressed by a contour integral and is a key\ningredient of the Wiener-Hopf factorization; and (iii) extraction of the SPP as\na simple-pole residue of a Fourier integral. Our analytical solution is in good\nagreement with a finite-element numerical computation.\n", "  Permalloy nanoparticles containing bacterial cellulose hydrogel obtained\nafter reduction was compressed into a xerogel flexible sheet by hot pressing at\n60 C at different pressures. The permalloy nanoparticles with an ordered\nstructure have a bimodal size distribution centered around 25 nm and 190 nm.\nThe smaller nanoparticles are superparamagnetic while the larger particles are\nferromagnetic at room temperature. The sheets have a room temperature\nmagnetisation of 20 emu/g and a coercivity of 32 Oe. The electrical\nconductivity of the flexible sheets increases with hot pressing pressure from 7\nS/cm to 40 S/cm at room temperature.\n", "  Human activities from hunting to emailing are performed in a fractal-like\nscale invariant pattern. These patterns are considered efficient for hunting or\nforaging, but are they efficient for gathering information? Here we link the\nscale invariant pattern of inter-touch intervals on the smartphone to optimal\nstrategies for information gathering. We recorded touchscreen touches in 65\nindividuals for a month and categorized the activity into checking for\ninformation vs. sharing content. For both categories, the inter-touch intervals\nwere well described by power-law fits spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 1 s\nto several hours. The power-law exponent typically found for checking was 1.5\nand for generating it was 1.3. Next, by using computer simulations we addressed\nwhether the checking pattern was efficient - in terms of minimizing futile\nattempts yielding no new information. We find that the best performing power\nlaw exponent depends on the duration of the assessment and the exponent of 1.5\nwas the most efficient in the short-term i.e. in the few minutes range.\nFinally, we addressed whether how people generated and shared content was in\ntune with the checking pattern. We assumed that the unchecked posts must be\nminimized for maximal efficiency and according to our analysis the most\nefficient temporal pattern to share content was the exponent of 1.3 - which was\nalso the pattern displayed by the smartphone users. The behavioral organization\nfor content generation is different from content consumption across time\nscales. We propose that this difference is a signature of optimal behavior and\nthe short-term assessments used in modern human actions.\n", "  Anions of the molecules ZnO, O2 and atomic Zn and O constitute mass spectra\nof the species sputtered from pellets of molecular solid of ZnO under Cs+\nirradiation. Their normalized yields are independent of energy of the\nirradiating Cs+. Collision cascades cannot explain the simultaneous sputtering\nof atoms and molecules. We propose that the origin of the molecular\nsublimation, dissociation and subsequent emission is the result of localized\nthermal spikes induced by individual Cs+ ions. The fractal dimension of binary\ncollision cascades of atomic recoils in the irradiated ZnO solid increases with\nreduction in the energy of recoils. Upon reaching the collision diameters of\natomic dimensions, the space-filling fractal-like transition occurs where\ncascades transform into thermal spikes. These localized thermal spikes induce\nsublimation, dissociation and sputtering from the region. The calculated rates\nof the subliming and dissociating species due to localized thermal spikes agree\nwell with the experimental results.\n", "  In these proceedings we discuss recent progress in nucleon structure using\nlattice QCD simulations at or near the physical value of the pion mass. Main\nfocus will be given in observables such as the nucleon axial charge and the\nfirst moments of parton distributions, for both the valence and sea quark\ncontributions, and discuss their implications on the spin content of the\nnucleon. We will will also report developments on the evaluation of the gluon\nmomentum fraction, which contributes significantly to the nucleon spin.\n", "  We review the treatment of conservation laws in spacetimes that are glued\ntogether in various ways, thus adding a boundary term to the usual conservation\nlaws. Several examples of such spacetimes will be described, including the\njoining of Schwarzschild spacetimes of different masses, and the possibility of\njoining regions of different signatures. The opportunity will also be taken to\nexplore some of the less obvious properties of Lorentzian vector calculus.\n", "  We theoretically investigate mechanisms of higher-order harmonic generation\nin solid-state materials under a high-intensity ac electric field. A new\ntheoretical framework presented in this Letter holds the legitimacy of Bloch\ntheorem even under the influence of the high-intensity electric field and\nprovides an exact treatment of the diabatic processes of Bloch electrons.\nUtilizing this framework, we first discovered that the diabatic processes,\nnamely, ac Zener tunneling and semimetallization of semiconductors, are key\nfactors for nonperturbative mechanisms of HHG. These mechanisms are classified\nby the field intensity and could be understood by an extended simple man model\nbased on an analogy between tunnel ionization in gaseous media and Zener\ntunneling in semiconductors. These conclusions would stimulate the universal\nunderstanding of HHG mechanisms in both atomic and solid cases.\n", "  We present a Submillimeter Array (SMA) observation towards the young massive\ndouble-core system G350.69-0.49. This system consists of a northeast (NE)\ndiffuse gas Bubble and a southwest (SW) massive young stellar object (MYSO),\nboth clearly seen in the Spitzer images. The SMA observations reveal a gas flow\nbetween the NE Bubble and the SW MYSO in a broad velocity range from 5 to 30\nkm/s with respect to the system velocity. The gas flow is well confined within\nthe interval between the two objects, and traces a significant mass transfer\nfrom the NE gas Bubble to the SW massive core. The transfer flow can supply the\nmaterial accreted onto the SW MYSO at a rate of $4.2\\times10^{-4} year^{-1}$.\nThe whole system therefore suggests a mode for the mass growth in MYSO from a\ngas transfer flow launched from its companion gas clump, despite that the\ndriving mechanism of the transfer flow is not yet fully determined from the\ncurrent data.\n", "  We review the status of the theory of dRGT massive gravity, and some of its\nextensions, as applied to cosmology and the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  We apply thermodynamics method to generate exact solution with maximum\nsymmetric surface for Einstein equation without solving it. The exact solutions\nare identified with which people have solved before. The horizons structure of\nsolutions are discussed in different situation. These results suggest that\nplane,spherical,pseudo-spherical symmetric spacetime form a family of\nsolutions, and this relationship can also be extended to Kerr spacetime and\nTaub-NUT spacetime. It sheds light on exploring more general definition of\nMisner-Sharp mass.\n", "  The paper reports potassium diffusion measurements performed on gem-quality\nsingle-crystal alkali feldspar in the temperature range from $1169$ to $1021 \\,\n\\mbox{K}$. Natural sanidine from Volkesfeld, Germany was implanted with\n$\\mbox{}^{43}\\mbox{K}$ at the ISOLDE/CERN radioactive ion-beam facility normal\nto the (001) crystallographic plane. Diffusion coefficients are well described\nby the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy of $2.4 \\, \\mbox{eV}$ and a\npre-exponential factor of $5\\times10^{-6} \\, \\mbox{m}^{2}/\\mbox{s}$, which is\nmore than three orders of magnitude lower than the $\\mbox{}^{22}\\mbox{Na}$\ndiffusivity in the same feldspar and the same crystallographic direction.\nState-of-the-art considerations including ionic conductivity data on the same\ncrystal and Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in random binary alloy\nstructures point to a correlated motion of K and Na through the interstitialcy\nmechanism.\n", "  Some non linear, second order QED processes in the presence of intense plane\nelectromagnetic waves are investigated. Analytic expressions with general\nkinematics are derived for Compton scattering and $e^+e^-$ pair production in a\ncircularly polarised external electromagnetic field. The differential cross\nsections were investigated numerically for photon energies up to 50 MeV,\nexternal field intensity parameter $\\nu^2$ to value 2, and all scattering\nangles. The variation of full cross sections with respect to external field\nintensity was also established. The presence of the external field led to\nresonances in the Compton scattering and pair production differential cross\nsections. These resonances were investigated by calculating the electron self\nenergy in the presence of the external field. At resonance the differential\ncross sections were enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The resonances\noccurred for values of external field intensity parameter $\\nu^2 <1$, lowering\nthe limit of $\\nu^2 \\sim 1$ at which point non linear effects in first order\nexternal field QED processes become important. Generally, full cross sections\nincreased with increasing external field intensity, though peaking sharply for\nCompton scattering and levelling off for pair production. An application was\nmade to non linear background studies at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders. The pair\nproduction process and electron self energy were studied for the case of a\nconstant crossed electromagnetic field. It was found that previous analytic\nexpressions required the external field to be azimuthally symmetric. New\nanalytic expressions for the more general non azimuthally symmetric case were\ndeveloped and a numerical parameter range equivalent to that proposed for\nfuture linear collider designs was considered.\n", "  Strongly coupled plasmon-exciton systems offer promising applications in\nnanooptics. The classification of the coupling regime is currently debated both\nfrom experimental and theoretical perspectives. We present a method to\nunambiguously identify strong coupling in plasmon-exciton core-shell\nnanoparticles by measuring true absorption spectra of the system. We\ninvestigate the coupling of excitons in J-aggregates to the localized surface\nplasmon polaritons on gold nanospheres and nanorods by fine-tuning the plasmon\nresonance via layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. While both\nstructures show a characteristic anticrossing in extinction and scattering\nexperiments, the careful assessment of the systems' light absorption reveals\nthat strong coupling of the plasmon to the exciton is only present in the\nnanorod system. In a phenomenological model of two classical coupled\noscillators, intermediate coupling strengths split up only the resonance\nfrequency of the light-driven oscillator, while the other one still dissipates\nenergy at its original frequency. Only in the strong-coupling limit, both\noscillators split up the frequencies at which they dissipate energy,\nqualitatively explaining our experimental finding.\n", "  We investigate theoretically how sheath radio-frequency (RF) oscillations\nrelate to the spatial structure of the near RF parallel electric field E//\nemitted by Ion Cyclotron (IC) wave launchers. We use a simple model of Slow\nWave (SW) evanescence coupled with Direct Current (DC) plasma biasing via\nsheath boundary conditions in a 3D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold\nmagnetized plasma. Within a \"wide sheaths\" asymptotic regime, valid for\nlarge-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF+DC model becomes\nlinear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be\nre-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every\nemitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual\ncontributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to\nthe sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal\ndistance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial\nprotrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the\nemitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW\nevanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field\nlines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs\nover a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for |VRF| are found\nsmaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC\nantenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E// emission by active\nor passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent\nexperimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why\nsheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite\nthe parallel anti-symmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally\njustify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes\nto attenuate sheath oscillations in their vicinity.\n", "  Recently, there have been increasing interests in phonon thermal transport in\nlow dimensional materials, due to the crucial importance for dissipating and\nmanaging heat in micro and nano electronic devices. Significant progresses have\nbeen achieved for one-dimensional (1D) systems both theoretically and\nexperimentally. However, the study of heat conduction in two-dimensional (2D)\nsystems is still in its infancy due to the limited availability of 2D materials\nand the technical challenges in fabricating suspended samples suitable for\nthermal measurements. In this review, we outline different experimental\ntechniques and theoretical approaches for phonon thermal transport in 2D\nmaterials, discuss the problems and challenges in phonon thermal transport\nmeasurements and provide comparison between existing experimental data. Special\nfocus will be given to the effects of the size, dimensionality, anisotropy and\nmode contributions in the novel 2D systems including graphene, boron nitride,\nMoS2, black phosphorous, silicene etc.\n", "  We performed geometric pulsar light curve modeling using static, retarded\nvacuum, and offset polar cap (PC) dipole $B$-fields (the latter is\ncharacterized by a parameter $\\epsilon$), in conjunction with standard two-pole\ncaustic (TPC) and outer gap (OG) emission geometries. The offset-PC dipole\n$B$-field mimics deviations from the static dipole (which corresponds to\n$\\epsilon=0$). In addition to constant-emissivity geometric models, we also\nconsidered a slot gap (SG) $E$-field associated with the offset-PC dipole\n$B$-field and found that its inclusion leads to qualitatively different light\ncurves. Solving the particle transport equation shows that the particle energy\nonly becomes large enough to yield significant curvature radiation at large\naltitudes above the stellar surface, given this relatively low $E$-field.\nTherefore, particles do not always attain the radiation-reaction limit. Our\noverall optimal light curve fit is for the retarded vacuum dipole field and OG\nmodel, at an inclination angle $\\alpha=78{_{-1}^{+1}}^{\\circ}$ and observer\nangle $\\zeta=69{_{-1}^{+2}}^{\\circ}$. For this $B$-field, the TPC model is\nstatistically disfavored compared to the OG model. For the static dipole field,\nneither model is significantly preferred. We found that smaller values of\n$\\epsilon$ are favored for the offset-PC dipole field when assuming constant\nemissivity, and larger $\\epsilon$ values favored for variable emissivity, but\nnot significantly so. When multiplying the SG $E$-field by a factor of 100, we\nfound improved light curve fits, with $\\alpha$ and $\\zeta$ being closer to best\nfits from independent studies, as well as curvature radiation reaction at lower\naltitudes.\n", "  Strong light-matter interaction and high-efficiency optical collection of\nfluorescence from quantum emitters are crucial topics in quantum and\nnanophotonic fields. High-quality cavities, dispersive photonic crystal\nwaveguides and even plasmonic structures have been used to enhance the\ninteraction with quantum emitters, thus realize efficient collection of the\nfluorescence. In this work, a new method is proposed to collect the\nfluorescence of quantum dots (QDs) with a fiber-integrated multimode silver\nnanowire (AgNW) waveguide. Fluorescence lifetime measurement is performed to\ninvestigate the coupling between QDs and different plasmonic modes. Compared\nwith far-field collection method, the AgNW-fiber probe can realize near-unity\ncollection efficiency theoretically. This fiber-integrated plasmonic probe may\nbe useful in the area of nanophotonics and also promising for quantum\ninformation devices.\n", "  Topological insulators give rise to exquisite electronic properties due to\ntheir spin-momentum locked Dirac-cone-like band structure. Recently, it has\nbeen suggested that the required opposite parities between valence and\nconduction band along with strong spin-orbit coupling can be realized in\ncorrelated materials. Particularly, SmB$_6$ has been proposed as candidate\nmaterial for a topological Kondo insulator. By utilizing scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy measurements down to 0.35 K, we observed several\nstates within the hybridization gap of about $\\pm$20 meV on well characterized\n(001) surfaces of SmB$_6$. The spectroscopic response to impurities and\nmagnetic fields allows to distinguish between dominating bulk and surface\ncontributions to these states. The surface contributions develop particularly\nstrongly below about 7 K which can be understood in terms of a breakdown of the\nKondo effect at the surface. Our high-resolution data provide detailed insight\ninto the electronic structure of SmB$_6$, which will reconcile many current\ndiscrepancies on this compound.\n", "  We reduce measurements made by the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary\nElectrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) to give the total Birkeland\n(field-aligned) current flowing in both hemispheres in monthly and hourly bins.\nWe analyze these totals using 6 years of data (2010-2015) to examine solar\nzenith angle-driven variations in the total Birkeland current flowing in both\nhemispheres, simultaneously, for the first time. A diurnal variation is\nidentified in the total Birkeland current flowing, consistent with variations\nin the solar zenith angle. A seasonal variation is also identified, with more\ncurrent flowing in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere during Bartels rotations\nin northern (southern) summer. For months close to equinox, more current is\nfound to flow in the Northern Hemisphere, contrary to our expectations. We also\nconduct the first test of the Milan (2013) model for estimating Birkeland\ncurrent magnitudes, with modifications made to account for solar contributions\nto ionospheric conductance based on the observed variation of the Birkeland\ncurrents with season and time of day. The modified model, using the value of\n$\\Phi_D$ averaged by Bartels rotation (scaled by 1.7), is found to agree with\nthe observed AMPERE currents, with a correlation of 0.87 in the Northern\nHemisphere and 0.86 in the Southern Hemisphere. The improvement over the\ncorrelation with dayside reconnection rate is demonstrated to be a significant\nimprovement to the model. The correlation of the residuals is found to be\nconsistent with more current flowing in the Northern Hemisphere. This new\nobservation of systematically larger current flowing in the Northern Hemisphere\nis discussed in the context of previous results which suggest that the Northern\nHemisphere may react more strongly to dayside reconnection than the Southern\nHemisphere.\n", "  Inspired by possible connections between gravity and foundational question in\nquantum theory, we consider an approach for the adaptation of objective\ncollapse models to a general relativistic context. We apply these ideas to a\nlist of open problems in cosmology and quantum gravity, such as the emergence\nof seeds of cosmic structure, the black hole information issue, the problem of\ntime in quantum gravity and, in a more speculative manner, to the nature of\ndark energy and the origin of the very special initial state of the universe.\nWe conclude that objective collapse models offer a rather promising path to\ndeal with all of these issues.\n", "  We present an adaptation of Stein's method of normal approximation to the\nstudy of both discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems. We obtain new\ncorrelation-decay conditions on dynamical systems for a multivariate central\nlimit theorem augmented by a rate of convergence. We then present a scheme for\nchecking these conditions in actual examples. The principal contribution of our\npaper is the method, which yields a convergence rate essentially with the same\namount of work as the central limit theorem, together with a multiplicative\nconstant that can be computed directly from the assumptions.\n", "  Mini arrays are commonly used for infrasonic and seismic studies. Here we\nreport for the first time the detection and mapping of distant lightning\ndischarges in the sky with a mini array. The array has a baseline to wavelength\nratio $\\sim$4.2 ${ \\cdot}$ $10^{-2}$ to record very low frequency\nelectromagnetic waves from 2 to 18 kHz. It is found that the mini array detects\n$\\sim$69 lightning pulses per second from cloud-to-ground and in-cloud\ndischarges, even though the parent thunderstorms are $\\sim$900-1100 km away and\na rigorous selection criterion based on the quality of the wavefront across the\narray is used. In particular, lightning pulses that exhibit a clockwise phase\nprogression are found at larger elevation angles in the sky as the result of a\nbirefringent subionospheric wave propagation attributed to ordinary and\nextraordinary waves. These results imply that long range lightning detection\nnetworks might benefit from an exploration of the wave propagation conditions\nwith mini arrays.\n", "  We investigate charge transport in C$_{60}$-based single-molecule junctions\nwith graphene electrodes employing a combination of density functional theory\n(DFT) electronic structure calculations and Landauer transport theory. In\nparticular, the dependence of the transport properties on the conformation of\nthe molecular bridge and the type of termination of the graphene electrodes is\ninvestigated. Furthermore, electron pathways through the junctions are analyzed\nusing the theory of local currents. The results reveal, in agreement with\nprevious experiments, a pronounced dependence of the transport properties on\nthe bias polarity, which is rationalized in terms of the electronic structure\nof the molecule. It is also shown that the edge states of zigzag-terminated\ngraphene induce additional transport channels, which dominate transport at\nsmall voltages. The importance of the edge states for transport depends\nprofoundly on the interface geometry of the junctions.\n", "  Radio detection of extensive air showers initiated in the Earth's atmosphere\nhas made tremendous progress in the last decade. Today, radio detection is\nroutinely used in several cosmic-ray observatories. The physics of the radio\nemission in air showers is well-understood, and analysis techniques have been\ndeveloped to determine the arrival direction, the energy and an estimate for\nthe mass of the primary particle from the radio measurements. The achieved\nresolutions are competitive with those of more traditional techniques. In this\narticle, I shortly review the most important achievements and discuss the\npotential for future applications.\n", "  Considering a spherically-symmetric non-static cosmological flat model of\nRobertson-Walker universe we have investigated the problem of perfect fluid\ndistribution interacting with the gravitational field in presence of massive\nscalar field and electromagnetic field in B-D theory. Exact solutions have been\nobtained by using a general approach of solving the partial differential\nequations and it has been observed that the electromagnetic field cannot\nsurvive for the cosmological flat model due to the influence caused by the\npresence of massive scalar field.\n", "  The treatment of crowded fields in Gaia data will only be a reality in a few\nyears from now. In particular, for globular clusters, only the end-of-mission\ndata (public in 2022-2023) will have the necessary full crowding treatment and\nwill reach sufficient quality for the faintest stars. As a consequence, the\nwork on the deblending and decontamination pipelines is still ongoing. We\ndescribe the present status of the pipelines for different Gaia instruments,\nand we model the end-of-mission crowding errors on the basis of available\ninformation. We then apply the nominal post-launch Gaia performances,\nappropriately worsened by the estimated crowding errors, to a set of 18\nsimulated globular clusters with different concentration, distance, and field\ncontamination. We conclude that there will be 103-104 stars with astrometric\nperformances virtually untouched by crowding (contaminated by <1 mmag) in the\nmajority of clusters. The most limiting factor will be field crowding, not\ncluster crowding: the most contaminated clusters will only contain 10-100 clean\nstars. We also conclude that: (i) the systemic proper motions and parallaxes\nwill be determined to 1% or better up to 15 kpc, and the nearby clusters will\nhave radial velocities to a few km/s ; (ii) internal kinematics will be of\nunprecendented quality, cluster masses will be determined to 10% up to 15 kpc\nand beyond, and it will be possible to identify differences of a few km/s or\nless in the kinematics (if any) of cluster sub-populations up to 10 kpc and\nbeyond; (iii) the brightest stars (V<17 mag) will have space-quality,\nwide-field photometry (mmag errors), and all Gaia photometry will have 1-3%\nerrors on the absolute photometric calibration.\n", "  In the Majorana equation for particles with arbitrary spin, wave packets\noccur due to not only the uncertainty that affects position and momentum but\nalso due to infinite components with decreasing mass that form the Majorana\nspinor. In this paper, we prove that such components contribute to increase the\nspreading of wave packets. Moreover, Zitterbewegung takes place in both the\ntime propagation of Dirac wave packets and in Majorana wave packets. However,\nit shows a peculiar fine structure. Finally, group velocity always remains\nsubluminal and contributions due to infinite components decrease progressively\nas spin increases.\n", "  We obtain structure formulas for the intertwining wave operators of a\nSchroedinger operator with potential V in R^3. The difference from our previous\nsubmission arXiv:1612.07304 lies with the fact that here we impose a scaling\ninvariant condition on the potential, albeit with a smallness requirement.\n", "  In this report, we applied expectation and maximization (EM) method described\nby Philips et al [1] to recover two-dimensional (2D) structure from multiple\nsparse signal images in random orientation. The detailed derivation of EM\nalgorithm for 2D image reconstruction was evaluated. Data sets with average 40\nphotons per frame were successfully classified by orientation. And the 2D mask\nstructure is reconstructed by merging all frames with the appropriate rotations\napplied to each one. It provides us an alternative approach in data set\nclassification and structural information recovery from extremely weak signal\nwith incomplete information.\n", "  Tensor models provide a way to access the path-integral for discretized\nquantum gravity in d dimensions. As in the case of matrix models for\ntwo-dimensional quantum gravity, the continuum limit can be related to a\nRenormalization Group fixed point in a setup where the tensor size N serves as\nthe Renormalization Group scale. We develop functional Renormalization Group\ntools for tensor models with a main focus on a rank-3 model for\nthree-dimensional quantum gravity. We rediscover the double-scaling limit and\nprovide an estimate for the scaling exponent. Moreover, we identify two\nadditional fixed points with a second relevant direction in a truncation of the\nRenormalization Group flow. The new relevant direction might hint at the\npresence of additional degrees of freedom in the corresponding continuum limit.\n", "  Through the combination of transmission electron microscopy analysis of the\ndeformed microstructure and molecular dynamics computer simulations of the\ndeformation processes, the mechanisms of plastic strain recovery in bulk AgCu\neutectic with either incoherent twin or cube-on-cube interfaces between the Ag\nand Cu layers and a bilayer thickness of 500 nm have been revealed. The\ncharacter of the incoherent twin interfaces changed uniquely after dynamic\ncompressive loading for samples that exhibited plastic strain recovery and was\nfound to drive the recovery, which is due to dislocation retraction and\nrearrangement of the interfaces. The magnitude of the recovery decreased with\nincreasing strain as dislocation tangles and dislocation cell structures\nformed. No change in the orientation relationship was found at cube-on-cube\ninterfaces and these exhibited a lesser amount of plastic strain recovery in\nthe simulations and none experimentally in samples with larger layer\nthicknesses with predominantly cube-on-cube interfaces. Molecular dynamics\ncomputer simulations verified the importance of the change in the incoherent\ntwin interface structure as the driving force for dislocation annihilation at\nthe interfaces and the plastic strain recovery.\n", "  The problem of the search for the satellites of the exoplanets (exomoons) is\ndiscussed recently. There are very many satellites in our Solar System. But in\ncontrary of our Solar system, exoplanets have significant eccentricity. In\nprocess of planetary migration, exoplanets can cross some resonances with\nfollowing growth of their orbital eccentricity. The stability of exomoons\ndecreases, and many of satellites were lost. Here we give a simple example of\nloss satellite when eccentricity increased. Finally, we can conclude that\nexomoons must be rare due to observed large eccentricities of exoplanets.\n", "  This proceeding presents searches for Dark Matter particles produced in\nassociation with top quarks at the LHC. The searches are performed by the ATLAS\nand CMS collaborations and various models and topologies are investigated. They\nare exploiting tt and single top experimental signatures by searching for an\nexcess of missing transverse energy. No signs of Dark Matter particles haven\nbeen observed and limits on the models are set.\n", "  Classical plasma with arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas is\nconsidered. In plasma N (N>2) collinear electromagnatic waves are propagated.\nIt is required to find the response of plasma to these waves. Distribution\nfunction in square-law approximation on quantities of two small parameters from\nVlasov equation is received. The formula for electric current calculation is\ndeduced. It is demonstrated that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence\nof the longitudinal electric current directed along a wave vector. This\nlongitudinal current is orthogonal to the known transversal current received at\nthe linear analysis. The case of small values of wave number is considered.\n", "  We explore the dynamics of strongly localized periodic solutions (discrete\nsolitons, or discrete breathers) in a finite one-dimensional chain of\nasymmetric vibro-impact oscillators. The model involves a parabolic on-site\npotential with asymmetric rigid constraints (the displacement domain of each\nparticle is finite), and a linear nearest-neighbor coupling. When the particle\napproaches the constraint, it undergoes an impact (not necessarily elastic),\nthat satisfies Newton impact law. Nonlinearity of the system stems from the\nimpacts; their possible non-elasticity is the sole source of damping in the\nsystem. We demonstrate that this vibro-impact model allows derivation of exact\nanalytic solutions for the asymmetric discrete breathers, both in conservative\nand forced-damped settings. The asymmetry makes two types of breathers\npossible: breathers that impact both or only one constraint. Transition between\nthese two types of the breathers corresponds to a grazing bifurcation. Special\ncharacter of the nonlinearity permits explicit derivation of a monodromy\nmatrix. Therefore, the stability of the obtained breather solutions can be\nexactly studied in the framework of simple methods of linear algebra, and with\nrather moderate computational efforts. All three generic scenarios of the loss\nof stability (pitchfork, Neimark-Sacker and period doubling bifurcations) are\nobserved.\n", "  The D meson yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and in p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV are presented. The measurement of the yields\nof electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays as a function of charged-particle\nmultiplicity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV are shown\nas well. The measurement of azimuthal correlations of prompt D mesons and\ncharged hadrons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and in p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV are also presented. The results are compared\nwith expectations from models.\n", "  The Kapustin-Witten equations on R^4 are equations for a pair of connection\non the product principle SU(2) bundle and 1-form with values in the product Lie\nalgebra bundle. The 1-form is the Higgs field. A dichotomy is proved to the\neffect that either the averaged norm of the Higgs field on large radius spheres\ngrows faster than a power of the radius, or its 1-form components everywhere\npairwise commute.\n", "  In this paper, we present a coherent state-vector method which can explain\nthe results of a nested linear Mach-Zehnder Interferometric experiment. Such\ninterferometers are used widely in Quantum Information and Quantum Optics\nexperiments and also in designing quantum circuits. We have specifically\nconsidered the case of an experiment by Danan \\emph{et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{111}, 240402 (2013)) where the outcome of the experiment was spooky by\nour intuitive guesses. However we have been able to show by our method that the\nresults of this experiment is indeed expected within the standard formalism of\nQuantum Mechanics using any classical state of a single-mode radiation field as\nthe input into the nested interferometric set-up of the aforesaid experiment\nand thereby looking into the power spectrum of the output beam.\n", "  The european CanSat competition is a funny way to understand physics. My\nstudents used low budget sensors and data analysis testing a model for\ntemperature and humidity in low troposphere.\n", "  Shear banding is widely observed in natural fault zones as well as in gouge\nlayers in laboratory experiments. Understanding the dynamics of strain\nlocalization under different loading conditions is essential for quantifying\nstrength evolution of fault gouge, energy partitioning during earthquakes and\ncharacterizing rheological transitions and fault zone structure changes. To\nthat end, we develop a physics-based continuum model for strain localization in\nsheared granular materials. The grain-scale dynamics is described by the Shear\nTransformation Zone (STZ) theory, a non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamic\nframework for viscoplastic deformation in amorphous materials. Using a finite\nstrain computational framework, we investigate the initiation and growth of\ncomplex shear bands under a variety of loading conditions and identify\nimplication for strength evolution and ductile to brittle transition. Our\nnumerical results show similar localization patterns to field and lab\nobservations and suggest that shear zones show more ductile response at higher\nconfining pressures, lower dilatancy and loose initial conditions. Lower\npressures, higher loading rates and higher dilatancy favor a brittle response\nand larger strength drops. These findings shed light on a range of mechanisms\nfor strength evolution in dry sheared gouge and provide a critical input to\nphysics-based multiscale models of fault zone instabilities.\n"]}
