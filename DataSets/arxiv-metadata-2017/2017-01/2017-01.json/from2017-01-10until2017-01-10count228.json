identical measurement results. We show this to be\nimpossible in the quantum domain. We prove that after the same quantum\nmeasurement two different quantum systems cannot yield always identical\nresults, provided the possible measurement results belong to a non orthogonal\nset. This is interpreted as quantum uniqueness - a quantum feature which has no\nclassical analog. Its tight relation with objective randomness of quantum\nmeasurements is discussed.\n", "  We consider some aspects of nonlocal modified gravity, where nonlocality is\nof the type $R \\mathcal{F}(\\Box) R$. In particular, using ansatz of the form\n$\\Box R = c R^\\gamma,$ we find a few $R(t)$ solutions for the spatially flat\nFLRW metric. There are singular and nonsingular bounce solutions. For late\ncosmic time, scalar curvature R(t) is in low regime and scale factor a(t) is\ndecelerated. R (t) = 0 satisfies all equations when k = -1.\n", "  Starting from p-adic string theory with tachyons, we introduce a new kind of\nnon-tachyonic matter which may play an important role in evolution of the\nUniverse. This matter retains nonlocal and nonlinear p-adic string dynamics,\nbut does not suffer of negative square mass. In space-time dimensions D = 2 +\n4k, what includes D = 6, 10, ..., 26, the kinetic energy term also maintains\ncorrect sign. In these spaces this p-adic matter provides negative cosmological\nconstant and time-dependent scalar field solution with negative potential.\nTheir possible cosmological role is discussed. We have also connected\nnon-locality with string world-sheet in effective Lagrangian for p-adic string.\n", "  I report on the discovery and analysis of the first transient X-ray pulsar\ndetected in the Local Group galaxy M33. The 2010 July-August deep XMM-Newton\nobservations of M33 fields revealed a new bright X-ray source XMMU\nJ013359.5+303634 exhibiting pulsations with a period P~285.4 s and pulsed\nfraction ~47 per cent in the 0.3-10 keV energy range. The pulse phase averaged\nspectrum of XMMU J013359.5+303634 is typical of X-ray pulsars and can be fit\nwith an absorbed simple power law model of photon index Gamma~1.2 in the 0.3-10\nkeV energy band. The search for an optical counterpart did not yield any\nstellar object brighter than 20 mag, suggesting that XMMU J013359.5+303634 is\nnot a Galactic foreground object and almost certainly belongs to M33. Assuming\nthe distance of 817 kpc, the maximum observed luminosity of the source in the\n0.3-10 keV energy range is ~1.4e37 ergs/s, at least 20 times higher than\nquiescent luminosity. The brightest optical object inside the error circle of\nXMMU J013359.5+303634 has a visual magnitude of 20.9 and properties consistent\nwith being an early B V star when placed at a distance of M33. Based on the\nX-ray pulsations and spectrum, transient behavior and possible early B class\noptical counterpart, XMMU J013359.5+303634 can be classified as another\nextragalactic Be/X-ray binary candidate.\n", "  In this paper, we mainly review recent results on mathematical theory and\nnumerical methods for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), based on the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Starting from the simplest case with\none-component BEC of the weakly interacting bosons, we study the reduction of\nGPE to lower dimensions, the ground states of BEC including the existence and\nuniqueness as well as nonexistence results, and the dynamics of GPE including\ndynamical laws, well-posedness of the Cauchy problem as well as the finite time\nblow-up. To compute the ground state, the gradient flow with discrete\nnormalization (or imaginary time) method is reviewed and various full\ndiscretization methods are presented and compared. To simulate the dynamics,\nboth finite difference methods and time splitting spectral methods are\nreviewed, and their error estimates are briefly outlined. When the GPE has\nsymmetric properties, we show how to simplify the numerical methods. Then we\ncompare two widely used scalings, i.e. physical scaling (commonly used) and\nsemiclassical scaling, for BEC in strong repulsive interaction regime\n(Thomas-Fermi regime), and discuss semiclassical limits of the GPE. Extensions\nof these results for one-component BEC are then carried out for rotating BEC by\nGPE with an angular momentum rotation, dipolar BEC by GPE with long range\ndipole-dipole interaction, and two-component BEC by coupled GPEs. Finally, as a\nperspective, we show briefly the mathematical models for spin-1 BEC, Bogoliubov\nexcitation and BEC at finite temperature.\n", "  It is shown that non-negative Legendrian isotopy defines a partial order on\nthe universal cover of the Legendrian isotopy class of the fibre of the\nspherical cotangent bundle of any manifold. This result is applied to Lorentz\ngeometry in the spirit of the authors' earlier work on the Legendrian Low\nconjecture.\n", "  A parameterization of Grassmann-algebraic relations corresponding to the\nPachner move 3--3 is proposed. In these relations, each 4-simplex is assigned a\nGrassmann weight depending on five anticommuting variables associated with its\n3-faces. The weights are chosen to have the \"simplest\" form - a\nGrassmann--Gaussian exponent or its analogue (satisfying a similar system of\ndifferential equations). Our parameterization works for a Zariski open set of\nsuch relations, looks relevant from the algebraic-topological viewpoint, and\nreveals intriguing nonlinear relations between objects associated with\nsimplices of different dimensions.\n", "  We carry out a statistically meaningful study on self-affine rough surfaces\nin elastic frictionless non-adhesive contact. We study the evolution of the\ntrue contact area under increasing squeezing pressure. Rough surfaces are\nsqueezed from zero up to full contact, which enables us to compare the\nnumerical results both with asperity based models at light pressures and with\nPersson's contact model for the entire range of pressures. Through the contact\nperimeter we estimate the error bounds inherent to contact area calculation in\ndiscrete problems.\n  A large number of roughness realizations enables us to compute reliably the\nderivative of the contact area with respect to the pressure. In contrast to\nPersson's model and in agreement with asperity based models, we demonstrate\nthat at light pressures it is a decreasing convex function. The nonlinearity of\nthe contact area evolution, preserved for the entire range of pressures, is\nespecially strong close to infinitesimal contact. This fact makes difficult an\naccurate investigation of contact at light pressure and prevents the evaluation\nof the proportionality coefficient, which is predicted by analytical models. A\ngood agreement of numerical results with Persson's model is obtained for the\nshape of the area-pressure curve especially near full contact. We investigate\nthe effects of the cutoff wavenumbers in surface spectrum onto the contact area\nevolution. Nayak's parameter is one of the central characteristics of\nroughness, it also plays an important role in rough contact mechanics, but its\neffect is significantly weaker than predicted by asperity based models. We give\na detailed derivation of a new phenomenological contact evolution law; also we\nderive formulae that link Nayak's parameter and density of asperities with\nHurst exponent and cutoffs wavenumbers.\n", "  We present a 2+1--flavor lattice QCD calculation of the electromagnetic Dirac\nand Pauli form factors of the octet baryons. The magnetic Sachs form factor is\nextrapolated at six fixed values of $Q^2$ to the physical pseudoscalar masses\nand infinite volume using a formulation based on heavy baryon chiral\nperturbation theory with finite-range regularization. We properly account for\nomitted disconnected quark contractions using a partially-quenched effective\nfield theory formalism. The results compare well with the experimental form\nfactors of the nucleon and the magnetic moments of the octet baryons.\n", "  We present a pedagogical introduction to the notions underlying the\nconnection formulation of General Relativity - Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) -\nwith an emphasis on the physical aspects of the framework. We begin by\nreviewing General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory, to emphasise the\nsimilarities between them which establish a foundation upon which to build a\ntheory of quantum gravity. We then explain, in a concise and clear manner, the\nsteps leading from the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity to the construction\nof the quantum states of geometry, known as \\emph{spin-networks}, which provide\nthe basis for the kinematical Hilbert space of quantum general relativity.\nAlong the way we introduce the various associated concepts of \\emph{tetrads},\n\\emph{spin-connection} and \\emph{holonomies} which are a pre-requisite for\nunderstanding the LQG formalism. Having provided a minimal introduction to the\nLQG framework, we discuss its applications to the problems of black hole\nentropy and of quantum cosmology. A list of the most common criticisms of LQG\nis presented, which are then tackled one by one in order to convince the reader\nof the physical viability of the theory.\n  An extensive set of appendices provide accessible introductions to several\nkey notions such as the \\emph{Peter-Weyl theorem}, \\emph{duality} of\ndifferential forms and \\emph{Regge calculus}, among others. The presentation is\naimed at graduate students and researchers who have some familiarity with the\ntools of quantum mechanics and field theory and/or General Relativity, but are\nintimidated by the seeming technical prowess required to browse through the\nexisting LQG literature. Our hope is to make the formalism appear a little less\nbewildering to the un-initiated and to help lower the barrier for entry into\nthe field.\n", "  In this work we analyze the problem of phase retrieval from Fourier\nmeasurements with random diffraction patterns. To this end, we consider the\nrecently introduced PhaseLift algorithm, which expresses the problem in the\nlanguage of convex optimization. We provide recovery guarantees which require\nO(log^2 d) different diffraction patterns, thus improving on recent results by\nCandes et al. [arXiv:1310.3240], which require O(log^4 d) different patterns.\n", "  We apply a formalism inspired by heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory with\nfinite-range regularization to dynamical $2+1-$flavor CSSM/QCDSF/UKQCD\nCollaboration lattice QCD simulation results for the electric form factors of\nthe octet baryons. The electric form factor of each octet baryon is\nextrapolated to the physical pseudoscalar masses, after finite-volume\ncorrections have been applied, at six fixed values of $Q^2$ in the range\n0.2-1.3 GeV$^2$. The extrapolated lattice results accurately reproduce the\nexperimental form factors of the nucleon at the physical point, indicating that\nomitted disconnected quark loop contributions are small. Furthermore, using the\nresults of a recent lattice study of the magnetic form factors, we determine\nthe ratio $\\mu_p G^p_E/G^p_M$. This quantity decreases with $Q^2$ in a way\nqualitatively consistent with recent experimental results.\n", "  One of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics is the principle\nimpossibility of deterministic errorless discrimination of nonorthogonal\nsignals, such as coherent states. On the one hand, it prevents perfect cloning\nof quantum states and enables secure communication. On the other hand, it makes\na grand challenge to reach the ultimate measurement precision. Although the\nminimum possible error rate (the Helstrom bound) has been known for almost five\ndecades, there is no practical way to achieve it. Developing the realistic\noptimal measurement strategies to attain the Helstrom bound is of utmost\nimportance for high-precision applications, long-distance free-space and\noptical fiber communication, gravitational wave detection, optical sensing in\nbiology and medicine, to name a few. In this work, we show an optimal receiver\nfor coherent states which admits a relatively simple technological\nimplementation. The receiver is based on multichannel splitting of the signal,\nfollowed by feed-forward signal displacement and photon detection.\n", "  The generic non-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes are holographically dual to\nhidden conformal field theories in two different pictures. The two pictures can\nbe merged together to the CFT duals in general picture that are generated by\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ modular group. We find some extensions of the conformal\nsymmetry generators that yield an extended local family of $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})_L\n\\times SL(2,\\mathbb{R})_R$ hidden conformal symmetries for the Kerr-Newman\nblack holes parameterized by one deformation parameter. The family of deformed\nhidden conformal symmetry for Kerr-Newman black holes also provides a set of\ndeformed hidden conformal generators for the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black\nholes. The set of deformed hidden conformal generators reduce to the hidden\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ conformal generators for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole\nfor specific value of deformation parameter. We also find agreement between the\nmacroscopic and microscopic entropy and absorption cross section of scalars for\nthe Kerr-Newman black hole by considering the appropriate temperatures and\ncentral charges for the deformed CFTs.\n", "  We study the behavior of very thin liquid films wetting homogeneous planar\nand spherical substrates. In order to describe a simple fluid at very small\nscales, we employ a classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we model a\nfluid with a local density approximation (LDA) for its hard-sphere contribution\nand assume that the intermolecular attractive forces are long-range. In\nparticular, we first introduce the basic concept of DFT, and then present\ncomputations for fluid films on planar and spherically symmetric walls. We\npresent equilibrium density profiles and adsorption isotherms. We also compare\nour results to predictions from a sharp-interface approximation (SIA) and\nsuggest a piecewise function approximation (PFA), which assumes that the\ndensity profile at the wall-liquid and the liquid-vapor interfaces varies\nsmoothly.\n", "  The main aim of this interdisciplinary paper is to characterize all maps on\nfinite Minkowski space of arbitrary dimension $n$ that map pairs of distinct\nlight-like events into pairs of distinct light-like events. Neither bijectivity\nof maps nor preservation of light-likeness in the opposite direction, i.e. from\ncodomain to domain, is assumed. We succeed in in many cases, which include the\none with $n$ divisible by 4 and the one with $n$ odd and $\\geq 9$, by showing\nthat both bijectivity of maps and the preservation of light-likeness in the\nopposite direction is obtained automatically. In general, the problem of\nwhether there exist non-bijective mappings that map pairs od distinct\nlight-like events into pairs of distinct light-like events is shown to be\nrelated to one of the central problems in finite geometry, namely to existence\nof ovoids in orthogonal polar space. This problem is still unsolved in general\ndespite a huge amount of research done in this area in the last few decades.\n  The proofs are based on the study of a core of an affine polar graph, which\nyields results that are closely related to the ones obtained previously by\nCameron and Kazanidis for the point graph of a polar space.\n", "  We study separatively the quasinormal modes (QNM) of electromagnetic\nperturbations around three-dimensional anti-de Sitter(AdS) black holes in\nJordan and Einstein frames, which are related by the conformal transformations\nand a redefinition of a scalar field. We find that, in the Jordan frame, the\nimaginary parts of QNM frequencies can reflect the thermodynamical stabilities\nof hairy black holes, including the possible phase transition between the hairy\nblack hole and BTZ black hole, disclosed by examining the corresponding free\nenergies. Similar results are also uncovered in the Einstein frame. The\nobtained results further support that the QNM can be a dynamic probe of the\nthermodynamic properties in black holes.\n", "  Silicene, analogous to graphene, is a one-atom-thick two-dimensional crystal\nof silicon which is expected to share many of the remarkable properties of\ngraphene. The buckled honeycomb structure of silicene, along with its enhanced\nspin-orbit coupling, endows silicene with considerable advantages over graphene\nin that the spin-split states in silicene are tunable with external fields.\nAlthough the low-energy Dirac cone states lie at the heart of all novel quantum\nphenomena in a pristine sheet of silicene, the question of whether or not these\nkey states can survive when silicene is grown or supported on a substrate\nremains hotly debated. Here we report our direct observation of Dirac cones in\nmonolayer silicene grown on a Ag(111) substrate. By performing angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on silicene(3x3)/Ag(111), we reveal the presence of\nsix pairs of Dirac cones on the edges of the first Brillouin zone of Ag(111),\nother than expected six Dirac cones at the K points of the primary\nsilicene(1x1) Brillouin zone. Our result shows clearly that the unusual Dirac\ncone structure originates not from the pristine silicene alone but from the\ncombined effect of silicene(3x3) and the Ag(111) substrate. This study\nidentifies the first case of a new type of Dirac Fermion generated through the\ninteraction of two different constituents. Our observation of Dirac cones in\nsilicene/Ag(111) opens a new materials platform for investigating unusual\nquantum phenomena and novel applications based on two-dimensional silicon\nsystems.\n", "  A Monte Carlo simulation of chemotactic bacteria is developed on the basis of\nthe kinetic model and is applied to a one-dimensional traveling population wave\nin a microchannel. In this simulation, the Monte Carlo method, which calculates\nthe run-and-tumble motions of bacteria, is coupled with a finite volume method\nto calculate the macroscopic transport of the chemical cues in the environment.\nThe simulation method can successfully reproduce the traveling population wave\nof bacteria that was observed experimentally and reveal the microscopic\ndynamics of bacterium coupled with the macroscopic transports of the chemical\ncues and bacteria population density. The results obtained by the Monte Carlo\nmethod are also compared with the asymptotic solution derived from the kinetic\nchemotaxis equation in the continuum limit, where the Knudsen number, which is\ndefined by the ratio of the mean free path of bacterium to the characteristic\nlength of the system, vanishes. The validity of the Monte Carlo method in the\nasymptotic behaviors for small Knudsen numbers is numerically verified.\n", "  We obtain a lower bound on the maximum number of qubits, $Q^{n,\n\\varepsilon}({\\mathcal{N}})$, which can be transmitted over $n$ uses of a\nquantum channel $\\mathcal{N}$, for a given non-zero error threshold\n$\\varepsilon$. To obtain our result, we first derive a bound on the one-shot\nentanglement transmission capacity of the channel, and then compute its\nasymptotic expansion up to the second order. In our method to prove this\nachievability bound, the decoding map, used by the receiver on the output of\nthe channel, is chosen to be the {\\em{Petz recovery map}} (also known as the\n{\\em{transpose channel}}). Our result, in particular, shows that this choice of\nthe decoder can be used to establish the coherent information as an achievable\nrate for quantum information transmission. Applying our achievability bound to\nthe 50-50 erasure channel (which has zero quantum capacity), we find that there\nis a sharp error threshold above which $Q^{n, \\varepsilon}({\\mathcal{N}})$\nscales as $\\sqrt{n}$.\n", "  We present and utilize a simple formalism for the smooth creation of boundary\nconditions within relativistic quantum field theory. We consider a massless\nscalar field in $(1+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime and imagine smoothly\ntransitioning from there being no boundary condition to there being a two-sided\nDirichlet mirror. The act of doing this, expectantly, generates a flux of real\nquanta that emanates from the mirror as it is being created. We show that the\nlocal stress-energy tensor of the flux is finite only if an infrared cutoff is\nintroduced, no matter how slowly the mirror is created, in agreement with the\nperturbative results of Obadia and Parentani. In the limit of instantaneous\nmirror creation the total energy injected into the field becomes ultraviolet\ndivergent, but the response of an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector passing\nthrough the infinite burst of energy nevertheless remains finite. Implications\nfor vacuum entanglement extraction and for black hole firewalls are discussed.\n", "  Scale-dependent halo bias due to local primordial non-Gaussianity provides a\nstrong test of single-field inflation. While it is universally understood that\nsingle-field inflation predicts negligible scale-dependent bias compared to\ncurrent observational uncertainties, there is still disagreement on the exact\nlevel of scale-dependent bias at a level that could strongly impact inferences\nmade from future surveys. In this paper, we clarify this confusion and derive\nin various ways that there is exactly zero scale-dependent bias in single-field\ninflation. Much of the current confusion follows from the fact that\nsingle-field inflation does predict a mode coupling of matter perturbations at\nthe level of $f_{NL}^{loc} \\approx -5/3$, which naively would lead to\nscale-dependent bias. However, we show explicitly that this mode coupling\ncancels out when perturbations are evaluated at a fixed physical scale rather\nthan fixed coordinate scale. Furthermore, we show how the absence of\nscale-dependent bias can be derived easily in any gauge. This result can then\nbe incorporated into a complete description of the observed galaxy clustering,\nincluding the previously studied general relativistic terms, which are\nimportant at the same level as scale-dependent bias of order $f_{NL}^{loc} \\sim\n1$. This description will allow us to draw unbiased conclusions about inflation\nfrom future galaxy clustering data.\n", "  We have gone through a comparative study on two different kind of bulk\nviscosity expressions by using a common dynamical model. The\nPolyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model in the realm of mean-field\napproximation, including up to eight quark interactions for 2+1 flavor quark\nmatter, is treated for this common dynamics. We have probed the numerical\nequivalence as well as discrepancy of two different expressions for bulk\nviscosity at vanishing quark chemical potential. Our estimation of bulk\nviscosity to entropy density ratio follows a decreasing trend with temperature,\nwhich is observed in most of the earlier investigations. We have also extended\nour estimation for finite values of quark chemical potential.\n", "  We are concerned with the non-normal Schr\\\"odinger operator $$\n  H=-\\Delta+V $$ on $ L^2(\\mathbb R^n)$, where $V\\in\nW^{1,\\infty}_{\\text{loc}}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\\operatorname{Re} (V(x))\\ge\nc|x|^2-d$ for some $c,d>0$. The spectrum of this operator is discrete and\ncontained in the positive half plane. In general, the\n$\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of $H$ will have an unbounded component for any\n$\\varepsilon>0$ and thus will not approximate the spectrum in a global sense.\nBy exploiting the fact that the semigroup $e^{-tH}$ is immediately compact, we\nshow a complementary result, namely that for every $\\delta>0$, $R>0$ there\nexists an $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the $\\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum $$\n  \\sigma_\\varepsilon(H)\\subset \\{z:\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\geq\nR\\}\\cup\\bigcup_{\\lambda\\in\\sigma(H)}\\{z:|z-\\lambda|<\\delta \\}. $$ In\nparticular, the unbounded part of the pseudospectrum escapes towards $+\\infty$\nas $\\varepsilon$ decreases. Additionally, we give two examples of\nnon-selfadjoint Schr\\\"odinger operators outside of our class and study their\npseudospectra in more detail.\n", "  We substantially update the capabilities of the open-source software\ninstrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now\nsimultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars\nundergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing\nthe prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully\ncoupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow\nMESA to accurately simulate advanced burning stages needed to construct\nsupernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be\ntreated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from\npre-main sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis\nfrom the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation\ninstrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for\nmassive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology\ndata. We improve treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust\nnear-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates\n\"on-the-fly\" from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion\ninduced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We\ndiscuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled\nplasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the\nsimulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by\nnoting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency\nfor all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling\ncapability for accelerating MESA's development.\n", "  Data re-sampling methods such as the delete-one jackknife are a common tool\nfor estimating the covariance of large scale structure probes. In this paper we\ninvestigate the concepts of internal covariance estimation in the context of\ncosmic shear two-point statistics. We demonstrate how to use log-normal\nsimulations of the convergence field and the corresponding shear field to carry\nout realistic tests of internal covariance estimators and find that most\nestimators such as jackknife or sub-sample covariance can reach a satisfactory\ncompromise between bias and variance of the estimated covariance.\n  In a forecast for the complete, 5-year DES survey we show that internally\nestimated covariance matrices can provide a large fraction of the true\nuncertainties on cosmological parameters in a 2D cosmic shear analysis. The\nvolume inside contours of constant likelihood in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$\nplane as measured with internally estimated covariance matrices is on average\n$\\gtrsim 85\\%$ of the volume derived from the true covariance matrix. The\nuncertainty on the parameter combination $\\Sigma_8 \\sim \\sigma_8\n\\Omega_m^{0.5}$ derived from internally estimated covariances is $\\sim 90\\%$ of\nthe true uncertainty.\n", "  We consider Ising models in two and three dimensions, with short range\nferromagnetic and long range, power-law decaying, antiferromagnetic\ninteractions. We let $J$ be the ratio between the strength of the ferromagnetic\nto antiferromagnetic interactions. The competition between these two kinds of\ninteractions induces the system to form domains of minus spins in a background\nof plus spins, or vice versa. If the decay exponent $p$ of the long range\ninteraction is larger than $d+1$, with $d$ the space dimension, this happens\nfor all values of $J$ smaller than a critical value $J_c(p)$, beyond which the\nground state is homogeneous. In this paper, we give a characterization of the\ninfinite volume ground states of the system, for $p>2d$ and $J$ in a left\nneighborhood of $J_c(p)$. In particular, we prove that the\nquasi-one-dimensional states consisting of infinite stripes ($d=2$) or slabs\n($d=3$), all of the same optimal width and orientation, and alternating\nmagnetization, are infinite volume ground states. Our proof is based on\nlocalization bounds combined with reflection positivity.\n", "  We establish a pointwise stability estimate for the Thomas-Fermi-von\nWeizs\\\"acker (TFW) model, which demonstrates that a local perturbation of a\nnuclear arrangement results also in a local response in the electron density\nand electrostatic potential. The proof adapts the arguments for existence and\nuniqueness of solutions to the TFW equations in the thermodynamic limit by\nCatto et al. (1998).\n  To demonstrate the utility of this combined locality and stability result we\nderive several consequences, including an exponential convergence rate for the\nthermodynamic limit, partition of total energy into exponentially localised\nsite energies (and consequently, exponential locality of forces), and\ngeneralised and strengthened results on the charge neutrality of local defects.\n", "  We propose a sharp-interface continuum model based on a thermodynamic\nvariational approach to investigate the strong anisotropic effect on\nsolid-state dewetting including contact line dynamics. For sufficiently strong\nsurface energy anisotropy, we show that multiple equilibrium shapes may appear\nthat can not be described by the widely employed Winterbottom construction,\ni.e., the modified Wulff construction for an island on a substrate. We repair\nthe Winterbottom construction to include multiple equilibrium shapes and employ\nour evolution model to demonstrate that all such shapes are dynamically\naccessible.\n", "  The Polyakov linear sigma model (PLSM) is used to investigate the respective\ninfluence of a finite volume and a magnetic field on the quark-hadron phase\nboundary in the plane of baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_{B}$) vs. temperature\n($T$) of the QCD phase diagram. The calculated results indicate sizable shifts\nof the quark-hadron phase boundary to lower values of $(\\mu_{B}~\\text{and}~T)$\nfor increasing magnetic field strength, and an opposite shift to higher values\nof $(\\mu_{B}~\\text{and}~T)$ for decreasing system volume. Such shifts could\nhave important implications for extraction of the thermodynamic properties of\nthe QCD phase diagram from heavy ion data.\n", "  We give strong evidence that divisibility of qubit quantum processes implies\ntemporal Tsirelson's bound. We also give strong evidence that the classical\nbound of the temporal Bell's inequality holds for dynamics that can be\ndescribed by entanglement-breaking channels---a more general class of dynamics\nthan that allowed by classical physics.\n", "  We show that the spreading of the center-of-mass density of ultracold\nattractively interacting bosons can become superballistic in the presence of\ndecoherence, via single-, two- and/or three-body losses. In the limit of weak\ndecoherence, we analytically solve the numerical model introduced in [Phys.\nRev. A 91, 063616 (2015)]. The analytical predictions allow us to identify\nexperimentally accessible parameter regimes for which we predict superballistic\nspreading of the center-of-mass density. Ultracold attractive Bose gases form\nweakly bound molecules; quantum matter-wave bright solitons. Our\ncomputer-simulations combine ideas from classical field methods (\"truncated\nWigner\") and piecewise deterministic stochastic processes. While the truncated\nWigner approach to use an average over classical paths as a substitute for a\nquantum superposition is often an uncontrolled approximation, here it predicts\nthe exact root-mean-square width when modeling an expanding Gaussian wave\npacket. In the superballistic regime, the leading-order of the spreading of the\ncenter-of-mass density can thus be modeled as a quantum superposition of\nclassical Gaussian random walks in velocity space.\n", "  We find the explicit form of two-point function for the conformal spin-2\nenergy momentum operators on the near horizon of a near extremal Kerr black\nhole by variation of a proper boundary action. In this regard, we consider an\nappropriate boundary action for the gravitational perturbation of the Kerr\nblack hole. We show that the variation of the boundary action with respect to\nthe boundary fields yields the two-point function for the energy momentum\ntensor of a conformal field theory. We find agreement between the two-point\nfunction and the correlators of the dual conformal field theory to the Kerr\nblack hole.\n", "  We consider disordered systems of directed polymer type, for which disorder\nis so-called marginally relevant. These include the usual (short-range)\ndirected polymer model in dimension (2+1), the long-range directed polymer\nmodel with Cauchy tails in dimension (1+1) and the disordered pinning model\nwith tail exponent 1/2. We show that in a suitable weak disorder and continuum\nlimit, the partition functions of these different models converge to a\nuniversal limit: a log-normal random field with a multi-scale correlation\nstructure, which undergoes a phase transition as the disorder strength varies.\nAs a by-product, we show that the solution of the two-dimensional Stochastic\nHeat Equation, suitably regularized, converges to the same limit. The proof,\nwhich uses the celebrated Fourth Moment Theorem, reveals an interesting chaos\nstructure shared by all models in the above class.\n", "  We derive rigorously one- and two-dimensional mean-field equations for cigar-\nand pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with higher order\ninteractions (HOI). We show how the higher order interaction modifies the\ncontact interaction of the strongly confined particles. Surprisingly, we find\nthat the usual Gaussian profile assumption for the strongly confining direction\nis inappropriate for the cigar-shaped BEC case, and a Thomas-Fermi type profile\nshould be adopted instead. Based on the derived mean field equations, the\nThomas-Fermi densities are analyzed in presence of the contact interaction and\nHOI. For both box and harmonic traps in one, two and three dimensions, we\nidentify the analytical Thomas-Fermi densities, which depend on the competition\nbetween the contact interaction and the HOI.\n", "  Shape dynamics is a theory first proposed by Julian Barbour which states that\nphysics happen uniquely in the reduced configuration space of a theory. So far,\nstudies in the area have focused on gravitational systems. Here we first\ncontemplate on the implications of this idea on quantum mechanics. We summarize\nthe idea of shape dynamics and then give physical configurations of multi qubit\nsystems. It is observed that inclusion of the spacetime curvature introduces a\nnew qubit degree of freedom. This is a novel effect of general relativity on a\nquantum system. Our aim in the grand picture, is to initiate a research program\ntranslating classical shape dynamics to quantum realm.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) has attracted significant interest as a monolayer or\nfew-layer material with extraordinary electrical and optoelectronic properties.\nHowever, degradation in air and other environments is an unresolved issue that\nmay limit future applications. In particular the role of different ambient\nspecies has remained controversial. Here, we report systematic experiments\ncombined with ab-initio calculations that address the effects of oxygen and\nwater in the degradation of BP. Our results show that BP rapidly degrades\nwhenever oxygen is present, but is unaffected by deaerated (i.e., O2 depleted)\nwater. This behavior is rationalized by oxidation involving a facile\ndissociative chemisorption of O2, whereas H2O molecules are weakly physisorbed\nand do not dissociate on the BP surface. Oxidation (by O2) turns the\nhydrophobic pristine BP surface progressively hydrophilic. Our results have\nimplications on the development of encapsulation strategies for BP, and open\nnew avenues for exploration of phenomena in aqueous solutions including\nsolution-gating, electrochemistry, and solution-phase approaches for\nexfoliation, dispersion, and delivery of BP.\n", "  Artificial membranes that are sensitive to temperature are needed in robotics\nto augment interactions with humans and the environment and in bioengineering\nto improve prosthetic limbs. Existing flexible sensors achieved sensitivities\nof <100 mK and large responsivity albeit within narrow (<5 K) temperature\nranges. Other flexible devices, working in wider temperature ranges, exhibit\norders of magnitude poorer responses. However, much more versatile and\ntemperature sensitive membranes are present in animals such as pit vipers,\nwhose pit membranes have the highest sensitivity and responsivity in nature and\nare used to locate warm-blooded preys at distance. Here, we show that pectin\nfilms mimic the sensing mechanism of pit membranes and parallel their record\nperformances. These films map temperature on surfaces with a sensitivity of at\nleast 10 mK in a wide temperature range (45 K), have very high responsivity,\nand detect warm bodies at distance. The produced material can be integrated as\na layer in artificial skins platforms and boost their temperature sensitivity\nto reach the best biological performance.\n", "  Riemann surfaces are geometric constructions in complex analysis that may\nrepresent multi-valued holomorphic functions using multiple sheets of the\ncomplex plane. We show that the energy dispersion of surface states in\ntopological semimetals can be represented by Riemann surfaces generated by\nholomorphic functions in the two-dimensional momentum space, whose constant\nheight contours correspond to Fermi arcs. This correspondence is demonstrated\nin the recently discovered Weyl semimetals and leads us to predict new types of\ntopological semimetals, whose surface states are represented by double- and\nquad-helicoid Riemann surfaces. The intersection of multiple helicoids, or the\nbranch cut of the generating function, appears on high-symmetry lines in the\nsurface Brillouin zone, where surface states are guaranteed to be doubly\ndegenerate by a glide reflection symmetry. We predict the heterostructure\nsuperlattice [(SrIrO$_3$)$_2$(CaIrO$_3$)$_2$] to be a topological semimetal\nwith double-helicoid Riemann surface states.\n", "  Fluctuation effects at first order phase transitions driven by changes of\nother-than-temperature factors like pressure, concentration, or external fields\nare investigated by perturbation theory. The results for the fluctuation\ncontributions to the order parameter, the internal energy and the free energy\nat pre-transitional states near spinodal points of first order phase\ntransitions are presented to the first-non-vanishing order of the expansion\nparameters of the theory.\n", "  We consider the problem of predicting the time evolution of influence, the\nexpected number of activated nodes, given a set of initially active nodes on a\npropagation network. To address the significant computational challenges of\nthis problem on large-scale heterogeneous networks, we establish a system of\ndifferential equations governing the dynamics of probability mass functions on\nthe state graph where the nodes each lumps a number of activation states of the\nnetwork, which can be considered as an analogue to the Fokker-Planck equation\nin continuous space. We provides several methods to estimate the system\nparameters which depend on the identities of the initially active nodes,\nnetwork topology, and activation rates etc. The influence is then estimated by\nthe solution of such a system of differential equations. This approach gives\nrise to a class of novel and scalable algorithms that work effectively for\nlarge-scale and dense networks. Numerical results are provided to show the very\npromising performance in terms of prediction accuracy and computational\nefficiency of this approach.\n", "  A new parallel solver for the volumetric integral equations (IE) of\nelectrodynamics is presented. The solver is based on the Galerkin method which\nensures the convergent numerical solution. The main features include: (i) the\nmemory usage is 8 times lower, compared to analogous IE based algorithms,\nwithout additional restriction on the background media; (ii) accurate and\nstable method to compute matrix coefficients corresponding to the IE; (iii)\nhigh degree of parallelism. The solver's computational efficiency is shown on a\nproblem of magnetotelluric sounding of the high conductivity contrast media. A\ngood agreement with the results obtained with the second order finite element\nmethod is demonstrated. Due to effective approach to parallelization and\ndistributed data storage the program exhibits perfect scalability on different\nhardware platforms.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are extremely interesting. Although the first Weyl semimetal\nwas recently discovered in TaAs, research progress is still significantly\nhindered due to the lack of robust and ideal materials candidates. In order to\nobserve the many predicted exotic phenomena that arise from Weyl fermions, it\nis of critical importance to find robust and ideal Weyl semimetals, which have\nfewer Weyl nodes and more importantly whose Weyl nodes are well separated in\nmomentum space and are located close to the chemical potential in energy. In\nthis paper, we propose by far the most robust and ideal Weyl semimetal\ncandidate in the inversion breaking, single crystalline compound tantalum\nsulfide Ta$_3$S$_2$ with new and novel properties beyond TaAs. We find that\nTa$_3$S$_2$ has only 8 Weyl nodes, all of which have the same energy that is\nmerely 10 meV below the chemical potential. Crucially, our results show that\nTa$_3$S$_2$ has the largest $k$-space separation between Weyl nodes among known\nWeyl semimetal candidates, which is about twice larger than TaAs and twenty\ntimes larger than the predicted value in WTe$_2$. Moreover, we predict that\nincreasing the lattice by $<4\\%$ can annihilate all Weyl nodes, driving a novel\ntopological metal-to-insulator transition from a Weyl semimetal state to a\ntopological insulator state. We further discover that changing the lattice\nconstant can move the Weyl nodes and the van Hove singularities with enhanced\ndensity of states to the chemical potential. Our prediction provides a\ncritically needed robust candidate for this rapidly developing field. The well\nseparated Weyl nodes, the topological metal-to-insulator transition and the\nremarkable tunabilities suggest Ta$_3$S$_2$'s potential as the ideal platform\nin future device-applications based on Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Teleporation with partially entangled quantum channel cannot achieve unit\nfidelity and unit probability. We show that the conditions for faithful\nteleportation of a pure state or a mixed state can be described by the same\ngeneral relation $\\rho_{q}\\rho_{m} = pI$, where $\\rho_{q}$ is the reduced\ndensity matrix of the quantum channel, $\\rho_{m}$ is the reduced density matrix\nof the measurement basis, and $p$ is the probability of faithful teleportaion.\nWe investigate the invariance of faithful teleportation conditions under\nunitary transformation. These results not only bring new insights to the\nprobabilistic quantum teleportation theory, but also offer operational\nsignificance in that a simple procedure is provided to find out the faithful\nteleportaiton probability and the matching measurement basis for any partially\nentangled quantum channel.\n", "  This theoretical study investigates the nonlinear ionic current-voltage\ncharacteristics of nano-channels that have weakly overlapping electrical double\nlayers. Numerical simulations as well as a 1-D mathematical model are developed\nto reveal that the electro-osmotic flow (EOF) interplays with the\nconcentration-polarization process and depletes the ion concentration inside\nthe channels, thus significantly suppressing the channel conductance. The\nconductance may be restored at high electrical biases in the presence of\nrecirculating vortices within the channels. As a result of the EOF-driven ion\ndepletion, a limiting-conductance behavior is identified, which is\nintrinsically different from the classical limiting-current behavior.\n", "  Understanding the emergence and subsequent behavior of heavy electrons in\nKondo lattice materials is one of the grand challenges in condensed matter\nphysics. In this perspective we review the progress that has been made during\nthe past decade and suggest some directions for future research. Our focus will\nbe on developing a new microscopic framework that incorporates the basic\nconcepts that emerge from a phenomenological description of the key\nexperimental findings.\n", "  We consider a J-self-adjoint 2x2 block operator matrix L in the Feshbach\nspectral case, that is, in the case where the spectrum of one main-diagonal\nentry is embedded into the absolutely continuous spectrum of the other\nmain-diagonal entry. We work with the analytic continuation of one of the Schur\ncomplements of L to the unphysical sheets of the spectral parameter plane. We\npresent the conditions under which the continued Schur complement has operator\nroots, in the sense of Markus-Matsaev. The operator roots reproduce (parts of)\nthe spectrum of the Schur complement, including the resonances. We then discuss\nthe case where there are no resonances and the associated Riccati equations\nhave bounded solutions allowing the graph representations for the corresponding\nJ-orthogonal invariant subspaces of L. The presentation ends with an explicitly\nsolvable example.\n", "  Understanding the network structure, and finding out the influential nodes is\na challenging issue in the large networks. Identifying the most influential\nnodes in the network can be useful in many applications like immunization of\nnodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex\nnetworks. A lot of research is done to devise centrality measures which could\nefficiently identify the most influential nodes in the network. There are two\nmajor approaches to the problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that\nexploit knowledge about the overall network topology in order to find the\ninfluential nodes, while on the other end, random strategies are completely\nagnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a\nlimited knowledge of the network structure are required. Indeed, in practice,\ninformation about the global structure of the overall network is rarely\navailable or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network\nmight be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate\nglobal centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed that\nrequires information only at the community level to identify the influential\nnodes in the network. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a\ncommunity structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the\ninfluential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global\ndeterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies with an available\nand the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of\nnodes for epidemic control.\n", "  We demonstrate electrical control of the A-exciton interband transition in\nmono- and few-layer $MoS_{2}$ crystals embedded into photocapacitor devices via\nthe DC Stark effect. Electric field dependent low-temperature photoluminescence\nspectroscopy reveals a significant tuneability of the A-exciton transition\nenergy, up to $\\sim 16 meV$, from which we extract the mean DC exciton\npolarisability $<\\bar{\\beta}>_{N} = (0.58 \\pm 0.25) \\cdot 10^{-8} DmV^{-1}$.\nThe exciton polarisability is shown to be layer-independent, indicating a\nstrong localisation of both electron and hole wave functions in each individual\nlayer.\n", "  A number of papers have suggested that it is inappropriate to combine data\nfrom different experiments when undertaking experimental tests of Bell's\ninequalities. It has been suggested that a correct analysis, using a single\nprobability space, leads to inequalities which are not violated by experiment.\nIf correct, this would be contrary to the normal interpretation of such\nexperimental data.\n  However, in this note, a generalised Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)\ninequality is derived for a system of four experiments constructed on a single\nprobability space which combines the data from the four experiments. It is\nshown that this leads to the standard CHSH inequality which is normally used to\ninterpret experimental data. Thus the commonly accepted conclusion that\nexperimental violations of Bell's inequality imply that local realistic models\nare inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics has not been\nchallenged.\n", "  The Interaction Enhanced Imaging technique allows to detect the spatial\ndistribution of strongly interacting impurities embedded within a gas of\nbackground atoms used as a contrast medium. Here we present a detailed study of\nthis technique, applied to detect Rydberg $P$ states. We experimentally realize\nfast and efficient three-photon excitation of $P$ states, optimized according\nto the results of a theoretical effective two-level model. Few Rydberg\n$P$-state atoms, prepared in a small cloud with dimensions comparable to the\nblockade radius, are detected with a good sensitivity by averaging over 50\nshots. The main aspects of the technique are described with a hard-sphere\nmodel, finding good agreement with experimental data. This work paves the way\nto a non-destructive optical detection of single Rydberg atoms with high\nspatial and temporal resolution.\n", "  Quantum correlations between imprecision and back-action are a hallmark of\ncontinuous linear measurements. Here we study how measurement-based feedback\ncan be used to improve the visibility of quantum correlations due to the\ninteraction of a laser field with a nano-optomechanical system. Back-action\nimparted by the meter laser, due to radiation pressure quantum fluctuations,\ngives rise to correlations between its phase and amplitude quadratures. These\nquantum correlations are observed in the experiment both as squeezing of the\nmeter field fluctuations below the vacuum level in a homodyne measurement, and\nas sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne measurement, demonstrating the common\norigin of both phenomena. We show that quantum feedback, i.e. feedback that\nsuppresses measurement back-action, can be used to increase the visibility of\nthe sideband asymmetry ratio. In contrast, by operating the feedback loop in\nthe regime of noise squashing, where the in-loop photocurrent variance is\nreduced below the vacuum level, the visibility of the sideband asymmetry is\nreduced. This is due to feedback back-action arising from vacuum noise in the\nhomodyne detector. These experiments demonstrate the possibility, as well as\nthe fundamental limits of measurement-based feedback as a tool to manipulate\nquantum correlations.\n", "  We study, using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, the ground state\nproperties of a one dimensional Rabi-Hubbard model. The model consists of a\nlattice of Rabi systems coupled by a photon hopping term between near neighbor\nsites. For large enough coupling between photons and atoms, the phase diagram\ngenerally consists of only two phases: a coherent phase and a compressible\nincoherent one separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We show that, as\none goes deeper in the coherent phase, the system becomes unstable exhibiting a\ndivergence of the number of photons. The Mott phases which are present in the\nJaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model are not observed in these cases due to the\npresence of non-negligible counter-rotating terms. We show that these two\nmodels become equivalent only when the detuning is negative and large enough,\nor if the counter-rotating terms are small enough.\n", "  Topological semimetals (TSMs) including Weyl semimetals and nodal-line\nsemimetals are expected to open the next frontier of condensed matter and\nmaterials science. Although the first inversion breaking Weyl semimetal was\nrecently discovered in TaAs, its magnetic counterparts, i.e., the time-reversal\nbreaking Weyl and nodal line semimetals, remain elusive. They are predicted to\nexhibit exotic properties distinct from the inversion breaking TSMs including\nTaAs. In this paper, we identify the magnetic topological semimetal state in\nthe ferromagnetic half-metal compounds Co$_2$TiX (X=Si, Ge, or Sn) with Curie\ntemperatures higher than 350 K. Our first-principles band structure\ncalculations show that, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, Co$_2$TiX\nfeatures three topological nodal lines. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling\ngives rise to Weyl nodes, whose momentum space locations can be controlled as a\nfunction of the magnetization direction. Our results not only open the door for\nthe experimental realization of topological semimetal states in magnetic\nmaterials at room temperatures, but also suggest potential applications such as\nunusual anomalous Hall effects in engineered monolayers of the Co$_2$TiX\ncompounds at high temperatures.\n", "  We investigate the action of local and global noise on monogamy of quantum\ncorrelations, when monogamy scores are considered as observables, and\nthree-qubit systems are subjected to global noise and various local noisy\nchannels, namely, amplitude-damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels.\nWe show that the dynamics of monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and\nquantum discord, in the case of generalized W states, as inputs to the noisy\nchannels, can exhibit non-monotonic dynamics with respect to increasing noise\nparameter, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay of monogamy scores when\ngeneralized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are exposed to noise. We\nquantify the persistence of monogamy against noise via a characteristic value\nof the noise parameter, and show that depolarizing noise destroys monogamy of\nquantum correlation faster compared to other noisy channels. We demonstrate\nthat the negativity monogamy score is more robust than the quantum discord\nmonogamy score, when the noise is of the phase-damping type. We also\ninvestigate the variation of monogamy with increasing noise for arbitrary\nthree-qubit pure states as inputs. Finally, depending on these results, we\npropose a two-step protocol, which can conclusively identify the type of noise\napplied to the quantum system, by using generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nand generalized W states as resource states. We discuss a possible\ngeneralization of the results to higher number of parties.\n", "  Although, the long-standing debate on the resistivity anomaly in ZrTe$_{5}$\nsomewhat comes to an end, the exact topological nature of the electronic band\nstructure remains elusive till today. Theoretical calculations predicted that\nbulk ZrTe$_{5}$ to be either a weak or a strong three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulator. However, the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nand transport measurements clearly demonstrate 3D Dirac cone state with a small\nmass gap between the valence band and conduction band in the bulk. From the\nmagnetization and magneto-transport measurements on ZrTe$_{5}$ single crystal,\nwe have detected both the signature of helical spin texture from topological\nsurface state and chiral anomaly associated with the 3D Dirac cone state in the\nbulk. This implies that ZrTe$_{5}$ is a novel 3D topological insulator having\nmassless Dirac fermionic excitation in its bulk gap state. Whereas, no 3D\ntopological insulator known in material science holds linear band dispersion in\nits insulating bulk. Apart from the band topology, it is also apparent from the\nresistivity and Hall measurements that the anomalous peak in the resistivity\ncan be shifted to a much lower temperature ($T$$<$2 K) by controlling impurity\nand defects.\n", "  Deterministically integrating semiconductor quantum emitters with plasmonic\nnano-devices paves the way towards chip-scale integrable, true nanoscale\nquantum photonics technologies. For this purpose, stable and bright\nsemiconductor emitters are needed, which moreover allow for CMOS-compatibility\nand optical activity in the telecommunication band. Here, we demonstrate\nstrongly enhanced light-matter coupling of single near-surface ($<10\\,nm$) InAs\nquantum dots monolithically integrated into electromagnetic hot-spots of\nsub-wavelength sized metal nanoantennas. The antenna strongly enhances the\nemission intensity of single quantum dots by up to $\\sim16\\times$, an effect\naccompanied by an up to $3.4\\times$ Purcell-enhanced spontaneous emission rate.\nMoreover, the emission is strongly polarised along the antenna axis with\ndegrees of linear polarisation up to $\\sim85\\,\\%$. The results unambiguously\ndemonstrate the efficient coupling of individual quantum dots to\nstate-of-the-art nanoantennas. Our work provides new perspectives for the\nrealisation of quantum plasmonic sensors, step-changing photovoltaic devices,\nbright and ultrafast quantum light sources and efficent nano-lasers.\n", "  The dynamical backaction from a periodically driven optical or microwave\ncavity can reduce the damping of a mechanical resonator, leading to parametric\ninstability accompanied by self-sustained oscillations. Fundamentally, the\ndriving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and replaces it with\nthe symmetry with respect to time translation by the driving period. This\ndiscrete symmetry should be reflected in the character of the oscillations.\nHere, we perform experimental and theoretical study of new aspects of the\nbackaction and the discrete time-translation symmetry using a micromechanical\nresonator designed to have two nonlinearly coupled vibrational modes with\nstrongly differing frequencies and decay rates. We find that self-sustained\noscillations are induced not only in the low frequency mode as measured in\nprevious experiments, but also in the high frequency mode. The vibration\nfrequencies and amplitudes are determined by the system nonlinearity, which\nalso leads to bistability and hysteresis. A remarkable consequence of the\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry is revealed by studying the vibration\nphases. We find that the phase fluctuations of the two modes are nearly\nperfectly anti-correlated. At the same time, in each mode the phase undergoes\nanomalous diffusion, where the time dependence of the phase variance follows a\nsuperlinear rather than the standard linear power law. Our analysis shows that\nthe exponent of the power law is determined by the exponent of the 1/f-type\nintrinsic frequency noise of the resonator. We demonstrate the possibility of\ncompensating for these fluctuations using a feedback scheme to generate stable\noscillations that could prove useful in frequency standards and resonant\ndetection.\n", "  Device concepts in semiconductor spintronics make long spin lifetimes\ndesirable, and the requirements put on spin control by schemes of quantum\ninformation processing are even more demanding. Unfortunately, due to\nspin-orbit coupling electron spins in semiconductors are generically subject to\nrather fast decoherence. In two-dimensional quantum wells made of zinc-blende\nsemiconductors, however, the spin-orbit interaction can be engineered in such a\nway that persistent spin structures with extraordinarily long spin lifetimes\narise even in the presence of disorder and imperfections. We review\nexperimental and theoretical developments on this subject both for $n$-doped\nand $p$-doped structures, and we discuss possible device applications.\n", "  A novel method was recently proposed and experimentally realized for\ncharacterizing a quantum state by directly measuring its complex probability\namplitudes in a particular basis using so-called weak values. Recently Vallone\nand Dequal showed theoretically that weak measurements are not a necessary\ncondition to determine the weak value [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 040502 (2016)].\nHere we report a measurement scheme used in a matter-wave interferometric\nexperiment in which the neutron path system's quantum state was characterized\nvia direct measurements using both strong and weak interactions. Experimental\nevidence is given that strong interactions outperform weak ones. Our results\nare not limited to neutron interferometry, but can be used in a wide range of\nquantum systems.\n", "  We systematically generate a large set of random micro-particle packings over\na wide range of adhesion and friction by means of adhesive contact dynamics\nsimulation. The ensemble of generated packings covers a range of volume\nfraction $\\phi$ from $0.135 \\pm 0.007$ to $0.639 \\pm 0.004$, and of\ncoordination number $Z$ from $2.11 \\pm 0.03$ to $6.40 \\pm 0.06$. We determine\n$\\phi$ and $Z$ at four limits (random close packing, random loose packing,\nadhesive close packing, and adhesive loose packing), and find a universal\nequation of state $\\phi(Z)$ to describe packings with arbitrary adhesion and\nfriction. From a mechanical equilibrium analysis, we determine a critical\nfriction coefficient $\\mu_{\\rm f, c}$: when the friction coefficient $\\mu_{\\rm\nf}$ is below $\\mu_{\\rm f, c}$, particles' rearrangements are dominated by\nsliding, otherwise, they are dominated by rolling. Because of this reason, both\n$\\phi(\\mu_{\\rm f})$ and $Z(\\mu_{\\rm f})$ change sharply across $\\mu_{\\rm f,\nc}$. Finally, we generalize the Maxwell counting argument to micro-particle\npackings, and show that the loosest packing, i.e., adhesive loose packing,\nsatisfies the isostatic condition at $Z=2$.\n", "  We show how extended topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) can be used\nto obtain a kinematical setup for quantum gravity, i.e. a kinematical Hilbert\nspace together with a representation of the observable algebra including\noperators of quantum geometry. In particular, we consider the holonomy-flux\nalgebra of (2+1)-dimensional Euclidean loop quantum gravity, and construct a\nnew representation of this algebra that incorporates a positive cosmological\nconstant. The vacuum state underlying our representation is defined by the\nTuraev-Viro TQFT. We therefore construct here a generalization, or more\nprecisely a quantum deformation at root of unity, of the previously-introduced\nSU(2) BF representation. The extended Turaev-Viro TQFT provides a description\nof the excitations on top of the vacuum, which are essential to allow for a\nrepresentation of the holonomies and fluxes. These excitations agree with the\nones induced by massive and spinning particles, and therefore the framework\npresented here allows automatically for a description of the coupling of such\nmatter to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant. The new\nrepresentation presents a number of advantages over the representations which\nexist so far. It possesses a very useful finiteness property which guarantees\nthe discreteness of spectra for a wide class of quantum (intrinsic and\nextrinsic) geometrical operators. The notion of basic excitations leads to a\nfusion basis which offers exciting possibilities for constructing states with\ninteresting global properties. The work presented here showcases how the\nframework of extended TQFTs can help design new representations and understand\nthe associated notion of basic excitations. This is essential for the\nconstruction of the dynamics of quantum gravity, and will enable the study of\npossible phases of spin foam models and group field theories from a new\nperspective.\n", "  The exploration of the Pluto-Charon system by the New Horizons spacecraft\nrepresents the first opportunity to understand the distribution of albedo and\nother photometric properties of the surfaces of objects in the Solar System's\n\"Third Zone\" of distant ice-rich bodies. Images of the entire illuminated\nsurface of Pluto and Charon obtained by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager\n(LORRI) camera provide a global map of Pluto that reveals surface albedo\nvariegations larger than any other Solar System world except for Saturn's moon\nIapetus. Normal reflectances on Pluto range from 0.08-1.0, and the low-albedo\nareas of Pluto are darker than any region of Charon. Charon exhibits a much\nblander surface with normal reflectances ranging from 0.20-0.73. Pluto's albedo\nfeatures are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous\nlow-albedo dust may be responsible for features seen to the west of the area\ninformally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon\nare latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker\nregions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole The\nphase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune\nbelieved to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar\nto that of the Moon. Preliminary Bond albedos are 0.25+/-0.03 for Charon and\n0.72+/-0.07 for Pluto. Maps of an approximation to the Bond albedo for both\nPluto and Charon are presented for the first time. Our work shows a connection\nbetween very high albedo (near unity) and planetary activity, a result that\nsuggests the KBO Eris may be currently active.\n", "  In the present work, we consider the cosmological constant model\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$, which is well motivated from three independent\napproaches. As is well known, the hint of varying fine structure constant\n$\\alpha$ was found in 1998. If $\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$ is right, it means\nthat the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ should also be varying. Here, we try\nto develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$, in which we view it from an interacting vacuum\nenergy perspective. Then, we consider the observational constraints on these\nmodels by using the 293 $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ data from the absorption systems\nin the spectra of distant quasars. We find that the model parameters can be\ntightly constrained to the very narrow ranges of ${\\cal O}(10^{-5})$ typically.\nOn the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$ from another perspective, namely it can be\nequivalent to a model containing \"dark energy\" and \"warm dark matter\", but\nthere is no interaction between them. We find that this is also fully\nconsistent with the observational constraints on warm dark matter.\n", "  Mach-Zehnder interferometry has been proposed as a probe for detecting the\nstatistics of anyonic quasiparticles in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states.\nHere we focus on interferometers made of multimode edge states with upstream\nmodes. We find that the interference visibility is suppressed due to\ndownstream-upstream mode entanglement; the latter serves as a \"which path\"\ndetector to the downstream interfering trajectories. Our analysis tackles a\nconcrete realization of filling factor 2/3, but its applicability goes beyond\nthat specific case, and encompasses the recent observation of ubiquitous\nemergence of upstream neutral modes in FQH states. The latter, according to our\nanalysis, goes hand in hand with the failure to observe Mach-Zehnder anyonic\ninterference in fractional states. We point out how charge-neutral mode\ndisentanglement will resuscitate the interference signal.\n", "  We investigate the static and dynamical patterns of entanglement in an\nanisotropic XY model with an alternating transverse magnetic field, which is\nequivalent to a two-component one-dimensional Fermi gas on a lattice, a system\nrealizable with current technology. Apart from the antiferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic phases, the model possesses a dimer phase which is not present in\nthe transverse XY model. At zero temperature, we find that the first derivative\nof bipartite entanglement can detect all the three phases. We analytically show\nthat the model has a \"factorization line\" on the plane of system parameters, in\nwhich the zero temperature state is separable. Along with investigating the\neffect of temperature on entanglement in a phase plane, we also report a\nnon-monotonic behavior of entanglement with respect to temperature in the\nanti-ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which is surprisingly absent in the\ndimer phase. Since the time dynamics of entanglement in a realizable physical\nsystem plays an important role in quantum information processing tasks, the\nevolutions of entanglement at small as well as large time are examined.\nConsideration of large time behavior of entanglement helps us to prove that in\nthis model, entanglement is always ergodic. We observe that other quantum\ncorrelation measures can qualitatively show similar features in zero and finite\ntemperatures. However, unlike nearest-neighbor entanglement, the\nnearest-neighbor information theoretic measures can be both ergodic as well as\nnon-ergodic, depending on the system parameters.\n", "  Using Hubble data, including new grism spectra, Oesch et al. recently\nidentified GN-z11, an $M_\\textrm{UV}$=-21.1 galaxy at $z$=11.1 (just 400Myr\nafter the big bang). With an estimated stellar mass of $\\sim$10$^9$M$_{\\odot}$,\nthis galaxy is surprisingly bright and massive, raising questions as to how\nsuch an extreme object could form so early in the Universe. Using \\Meraxes{}, a\nsemi-analytic galaxy-formation model developed as part of the Dark-ages\nReionization And Galaxy-formation Observables from Numerical Simulations\n(DRAGONS) programme, we investigate the potential formation mechanisms and\neventual fate of GN-z11. The volume of our simulation is comparable to that of\nthe discovery observations and possesses two analogue galaxies of similar\nluminosity to this remarkably bright system. Existing in the two most massive\nsubhaloes at $z$=11.1 ($M_\\textrm{vir}$=1.4$\\times 10^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$ and\n6.7$\\times 10^{10}$M$_{\\odot}$), our model analogues show excellent agreement\nwith all available observationally derived properties of GN-z11. Although they\nare relatively rare outliers from the full galaxy population at high-$z$, they\nare no longer the most massive or brightest systems by $z$=5. Furthermore, we\nfind that both objects possess relatively smooth, but extremely rapid mass\ngrowth histories with consistently high star formation rates and UV\nluminosities at $z{>}11$, indicating that their brightness is not a transient,\nmerger-driven feature. Our model results suggest that future wide-field surveys\nwith the \\textit{James Webb Space Telescope} may be able to detect the\nprogenitors of GN-z11 analogues out to $z{\\sim}$13--14, pushing the frontiers\nof galaxy-formation observations to the early phases of cosmic reionization and\nproviding a valuable glimpse of the first galaxies to reionize the Universe on\nlarge scales.\n", "  Using Monte Carlo Collisions (MCC) method, we have performed simulations of\nion velocity distribution functions (IVDF) taking into account both elastic\ncollisions and charge exchange collisions of ions with atoms in uniform\nelectric fields for argon and helium background gases. The simulation results\nare verified by comparison with the experiment data of the ion drift velocities\nand the ion transverse diffusion coefficients in argon and helium. The recently\npublished experimental data for the first seven coefficients of the Legendre\npolynomial expansion of the ion energy and angular distribution functions are\nused to validate simulation results for IVDF. Good agreements between measured\nand simulated IVDFs show that the developed simulation model can be used for\naccurate calculations of IVDFs.\n", "  We show that the system of Gaudin's equations for quasimomenta k_{j}, which\ndescribes a one-dimensional system of spinless point bosons with zero boundary\nconditions, has the unique real solution for each set of quantum numbers n_{j}.\n", "  A switch capable of routing microwave signals at cryogenic temperatures is a\ndesirable component for state-of-the-art experiments in many fields of applied\nphysics, including but not limited to quantum information processing,\ncommunication and basic research in engineered quantum systems. Conventional\nmechanical switches provide low insertion loss but disturb operation of\ndilution cryostats and the associated experiments by heat dissipation. Switches\nbased on semiconductors or microelectromechanical systems have a lower thermal\nbudget but are not readily integrated with current superconducting circuits.\nHere we design and test an on-chip switch built by combining tunable\ntransmission-line resonators with microwave beam-splitters. The device is\nsuperconducting and as such dissipates a negligible amount of heat. It is\ncompatible with current superconducting circuit fabrication techniques,\noperates with a bandwidth exceeding $100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, is capable of handling\nphoton fluxes on the order of $10^{5}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, equivalent to\npowers exceeding $-90\\,\\mathrm{dBm}$, and can be switched within approximately\n$6-8\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. We successfully demonstrate operation of the device in the\nquantum regime by integrating it on a chip with a single-photon source and\nusing it to route non-classical itinerant microwave fields at the single-photon\nlevel.\n", "  We study asymptotically AdS Brans-Dicke (BD) backgrounds, where the Ricci\ntensor R is coupled to a scalar in the radial dimension, as effective models of\nmetals with a varying coupling constant. We show that, for translational\ninvariant backgrounds, the regular part of the dc conductivity $\\sigma_Q$\ndeviates from the universal result of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) models.\nHowever, the shear viscosity to entropy ratio saturates the\nKovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound. Similar results apply to more general f(R)\ngravity models. In four bulk dimensions we study momentum relaxation induced by\ngravitational and electromagnetic axion-dependent couplings. For sufficiently\nstrong momentum dissipation induced by the former, a recently proposed bound on\nthe dc conductivity $\\sigma$ is violated for any finite electromagnetic axion\ncoupling. Interestingly, in more than four bulk dimensions, the dc conductivity\nfor strong momentum relaxation decreases with temperature in the low\ntemperature limit. In line with other gravity backgrounds with momentum\nrelaxation, the shear viscosity to entropy ratio is always lower than the KSS\nbound. The numerical computation of the optical conductivity reveals a linear\ngrowth with the frequency in the limit of low temperature, low frequency and\nlarge momentum relaxation. We have also shown that the module and argument of\nthe optical conductivity for intermediate frequencies are not consistent with\ncuprates experimental results, even assuming several channel of momentum\nrelaxation.\n", "  Microwave magnetodynamics in ferromagnets are often studied in the\nsmall-amplitude or weakly nonlinear regime corresponding to modulations of a\nwell-defined magnetic state. However, strongly nonlinear regimes, where the\naforementioned approximations are not applicable, have become experimentally\naccessible. By re-interpreting the governing Landau-Lifshitz equation of\nmotion, we derive an exact set of equations of dispersive hydrodynamic form\nthat are amenable to analytical study even when full nonlinearity and exchange\ndispersion are included. The resulting equations are shown to, in general,\nbreak Galilean invariance. A magnetic Mach number is obtained as a function of\nstatic and moving reference frames. The simplest class of solutions are termed\nuniform hydrodynamic states (UHSs), which exhibit fluid-like behavior including\nlaminar flow at subsonic speeds and the formation of a Mach cone and\nwave-fronts at supersonic speeds. A regime of modulational instability is also\npossible, where the UHS is violently unstable. The hydrodynamic interpr\n", "  We briefly review the recently developed, Markov process based isothermal\nchemical thermodynamics for nonlinear, driven mesoscopic kinetic systems. Both\nthe instantaneous Shannon entropy {\\boldmath $S[p_{\\alpha}(t)]$} and relative\nentropy {\\boldmath $F[p_{\\alpha}(t)]$}, defined based on probability\ndistribution {\\boldmath $\\{p_{\\alpha}(t)\\}$}, play prominent roles. The theory\nis general; and as a special case when a chemical reaction system is situated\nin an equilibrium environment, it agrees perfectly with Gibbsian chemical\nthermodynamics: {\\boldmath $k_BS$} and {\\boldmath $k_BTF$} become thermodynamic\nentropy and free energy, respectively. We apply this theory to a fully\nreversible autocatalytic reaction kinetics, represented by a\nDelbr\\\"{u}ck-Gillespie process, in a chemostatic nonequilibrium environment.\nThe open, driven chemical system serves as an archetype for biochemical\nself-replication. The significance of {\\em thermodynamically consistent}\nkinetic coarse-graining is emphasized. In a kinetic system where death of a\nbiological organism is treated as the reversal of its birth, the meaning of\nmathematically emergent \"dissipation\", which is not related to the heat\nmeasured in terms of {\\boldmath $k_BT$}, remains to be further investigated.\n", "  We study \\textit{ab initio} a pyrochlore compound, CsW$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which\nexhibits a yet unexplained metal-insulator transition. We find that (1) the\nreported low-$T$ structure is likely inaccurate and the correct structure has a\ntwice larger cell; (2) the insulating phase is not of a Mott or dimer-singlet\nnature, but a rare example of a 3D Peierls transition, with a simultaneous\ncondensation of three density waves; (3) spin-orbit interaction plays a crucial\nrole, forming well-nested bands. The high-$T$ (HT) phase, if stabilized, could\nharbor a unique $e_{g}+ie_{g}$ superconducting state that breaks the time\nreversal symmetry, but is not chiral. This state was predicted in 1999, but\nnever observed. We speculate about possible ways to stabilize the HT phase\nwhile keeping the conditions for superconductivity.\n", "  Photoisomerization, i.e., a change of molecular structure after absorption of\na photon, is one of the most fundamental photochemical processes. It can\nperform desirable functionality, e.g., as the primary photochemical event in\nhuman vision, where it stores electronic energy in the molecular structure, or\nfor possible applications in solar energy storage and as memories, switches,\nand actuators; but it can also have detrimental effects, for example as an\nimportant damage pathway under solar irradiation of DNA, or as a limiting\nfactor for the efficiency of organic solar cells. While photoisomerization can\nbe avoided by shielding the system from light, this is of course not a viable\npathway for approaches that rely on the interaction with external light (such\nas solar cells or solar energy storage). Here, we show that strong coupling of\norganic molecules to a confined light mode can be used to strongly suppress\nphotoisomerization, and thus convert molecules that normally show fast\nphotodegradation into photostable forms.\n", "  Generally making the cosmological scale factor $R$ be a function of the\ncoordinate of the extra dimension $\\sigma $ that is also a function of time\n$t$, we achieve a new kind of cosmic acceleration mechanism depending on extra\ndimension. We give the constraints on $\\sigma $ under four different prospects\nof the universe, and indicate that dark energy is not required for both the\nsmall extra dimension and the accelerating expansion of our universe. This\nresults in this paper show that the accelerating expansion of our universe may\ncome from both dark energy and the achieved new mechanism here, or the latter\nalone.\n", "  Solar UV variability is extremely relevant for the stratospheric ozone. It\nhas an impact on Earth's atmospheric structure and dynamics through radiative\nheating and ozone photochemistry. Our goal is to study the slope of the solar\nUV spectrum in two UV bands important for the stratospheric ozone production.\nIn order to investigate the solar spectral variability, we use SOLSTICE (the\nSolar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment) data onboard Solar Radiation\nand Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite. Data sets used are far UV (115-180nm)\nand middle UV (180-310nm), as well as the Mg II index (the Bremen composite).\nWe introduce the SOLSTICE [FUV - MUV] colour to study the solar spectral\ncharacteristics, as well as analysis of the colour versus Mg II index. To\nisolate the 11-year scale variation, we used the Empirical Mode decomposition\n(EMD) on the data sets. The [FUV - MUV] colour strongly correlates with the Mg\nII index. More in detail, the [FUV - MUV] colour shows a time dependent\nbehavior when plotted versus Mg II index. To explain this dependence we\nhypothesize an efficiency reduction of SOLSTICE FUV irradiance using an\nexponential aging law.\n", "  Deep inelastic scattering in $^{154}$Sm+$^{160}$Gd at energies above the Bass\nbarrier is for the first time investigated with two different microscopic\ndynamics approaches: improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD) model and time\ndependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. No fusion is observed from both models.\nThe capture pocket disappears for this reaction due to strong Coulomb repulsion\nand the contact time of the di-nuclear system formed in head-on collisions is\nabout 700 fm/c at an incident energy of 440 MeV. The isotope distribution of\nfragments in the deep inelastic scattering process is predicted with the\nsimulations of the latest ImQMD-v2.2 model together with a statistical code\n(GEMINI) for describing the secondary decay of fragments. More than 40\nextremely neutron-rich unmeasured nuclei with $58 \\le Z\\le 76$ are observed and\nthe production cross sections are at the order of ${\\rm \\mu b}$ to mb. The\nmulti-nucleon transfer reaction of Sm+Gd could be an alternative way to\nsynthesize new neutron-rich lanthanides which are difficult to be produced with\ntraditional fusion reactions or fission of actinides.\n", "  Pumping a finite energy density into a quantum system typically leads to\n`melted' states characterized by exponentially-decaying correlations, as is the\ncase for finite-temperature equilibrium situations. An important exception to\nthis rule are states which, while being at high energy, maintain a low entropy.\nSuch states can interestingly still display features of quantum criticality,\nespecially in one dimension. Here, we consider high-energy states in\nanisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chains obtained by splitting the ground\nstate's magnon Fermi sea into separate pieces. Using methods based on\nintegrability, we provide a detailed study of static and dynamical spin-spin\ncorrelations. These carry distinctive signatures of the Fermi sea splittings,\nwhich would be observable in eventual experimental realizations. Going further,\nwe employ a multi-component Tomonaga-Luttinger model in order to predict the\nasymptotics of static correlations. For this effective field theory, we fix all\nuniversal exponents from energetics, and all non-universal correlation\nprefactors using finite-size scaling of matrix elements. The correlations\nobtained directly from integrability and those emerging from the Luttinger\nfield theory description are shown to be in extremely good correspondence, as\nexpected, for the large distance asymptotics, but surprisingly also for the\nshort distance behavior. Finally, we discuss the description of dynamical\ncorrelations from a mobile impurity model, and clarify the relation of the\neffective field theory parameters to the Bethe Ansatz solution.\n", "  We show that density spikes begin to form from dark matter particles around\nprimordial black holes immediately after their formation at the\nradiation-dominated cosmological stage. This follows from the fact that in the\nthermal velocity distribution of particles there are particles with low\nvelocities that remain in finite orbits around black holes and are not involved\nin the cosmological expansion. The accumulation of such particles near black\nholes gives rise to density spikes. These spikes are considerably denser than\nthose that are formed later by the mechanism of secondary accretion. The\ndensity spikes must be bright gamma-ray sources. Comparison of the calculated\nsignal from particle annihilation with the Fermi-LAT data constrains the\npresent-day cosmological density parameter for primordial black holes with\nmasses $M_{\\rm BH}\\geq10^{-8}M_\\odot$ from above by values from $\\Omega_{\\rm\nBH}\\leq1$ to $\\Omega_{\\rm BH}\\leq10^{-8}$, depending on $M_{\\rm BH}$. These\nconstraints are several orders of magnitude more stringent than other known\nconstraints.\n", "  We report Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations measurements revealing experimental\nsignatures of an annular Fermi sea that develops near the energy band edge of\nthe excited subband of two-dimensional holes confined in a wide GaAs quantum\nwell. As we increase the hole density, when the Fermi level reaches the excited\nsubband edge, the low-field magnetoresistance traces show a sudden emergence of\nnew oscillations at an unexpectedly large frequency whose value does\n$\\textit{not}$ correspond to the (negligible) density of holes in the excited\nsubband. There is also a sharp and significant increase in zero-field\nresistance near this onset of subband occupation. Guided by numerical energy\ndispersion calculations, we associate these observations with the unusual shape\nof the excited subband dispersion which results in a \"ring of extrema\" at\nfinite wavevectors and an annular Fermi sea. Such a dispersion and Fermi sea\nhave long been expected from energy band calculations in systems with strong\nspin-orbit interaction but their experimental signatures have been elusive.\n", "  We theoretically explore quantum correlation properties of a dissipative\nBose-Hubbard dimer in presence of a coherent drive. In particular, we focus on\nthe regime where the semiclassical theory predicts a bifurcation with a\nspontaneous spatial symmetry breaking. The critical behavior in a well defined\nthermodynamical limit of large excitation numbers is considered and analyzed\nwithin a Gaussian approach. The case of a finite boson density is also examined\nby numerically integrating the Lindblad master equation for the density matrix.\nWe predict the critical behavior around the bifurcation points accompanied with\nlarge quantum correlations of the mixed steady-state, in particular exhibiting\na peak in the logarithmic entanglement negativity.\n", "  We describe a detection system designed for precise measurements of angular\ncorrelations in neutron $\\beta$ decay. The system is based on thick, large\narea, highly segmented silicon detectors developed in collaboration with Micron\nSemiconductor, Ltd. The prototype system meets specifications for $\\beta$\nelectron detection with energy thresholds below 10 keV, energy resolution of\n$\\sim$3 keV FWHM, and rise time of $\\sim$50 ns with 19 of the 127 detector\npixels instrumented. Using ultracold neutrons at the Los Alamos Neutron Science\nCenter, we have demonstrated the coincident detection of $\\beta$ particles and\nrecoil protons from neutron $\\beta$ decay. The fully instrumented detection\nsystem will be implemented in the UCNB and Nab experiments, to determine the\nneutron $\\beta$ decay parameters $B$, $a$, and $b$.\n", "  We describe a method for calculating the probability with which the wall of a\nplasma absorbs an electron at low energy. The method, based on an invariant\nembedding principle, expresses the electron absorption probability as the\nprobability for transmission through the wall's long-range surface potential\ntimes the probability to stay inside the wall despite of internal\nbackscattering. To illustrate the approach we apply it to a \\SiOTwo\\ surface.\nBesides emission of optical phonons inside the wall we take elastic scattering\nat imperfections of the plasma-wall interface into account and obtain\nabsorption probabilities significantly less than unity in accordance with\navailable electron-beam scattering data but in disagreement with the widely\nused perfect absorber model.\n", "  We report mid-infrared spectroscopy measurements of an electrostatically\ngated topological insulator, in which we observe several percent modulation of\ntransmittance and reflectance of (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 films as gating shifts the\nFermi level. Infrared transmittance measurements of gated (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 films\nwere enabled by use of an epitaxial lift-off method for large-area transfer of\ntopological insulator films from infrared-absorbing SrTiO3 growth substrates to\nthermal oxidized silicon substrates. We combine these optical experiments with\ntransport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to\nidentify the observed spectral modulation as a gate-driven transfer of spectral\nweight between both bulk and topological surface channels and interband and\nintraband channels. We develop a model for the complex permittivity of gated\n(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3, and find a good match to our experimental data. These results\nopen the path for layered topological insulator materials as a new candidate\nfor tunable infrared optics and highlight the possibility of switching\ntopological optoelectronic phenomena between bulk and spin-polarized surface\nregimes.\n", "  The identification of orbital angular momentum (OAM) as a fundamental\nproperty of a beam of light nearly twenty-five years ago has led to an\nextensive body of research around this topic. The possibility that single\nphotons can carry OAM has made this degree of freedom an ideal candidate for\nthe investigation of complex quantum phenomena and their applications. Research\nin this direction has ranged from experiments on complex forms of quantum\nentanglement to the interaction between light and quantum states of matter.\nFurthermore, the use of OAM in quantum information has generated a lot of\nexcitement, as it allows for encoding large amounts of information on a single\nphoton. Here we explain the intuition that led to the first quantum experiment\nwith OAM fifteen years ago. We continue by reviewing some key experiments\ninvestigating fundamental questions on photonic OAM and the first steps into\napplying these properties in novel quantum protocols. In the end, we identify\nseveral interesting open questions that could form the subject of future\ninvestigations with OAM.\n", "  We investigate the possible existence of the bound state in the system of\nthree bosons interacting with each other via zero-radius potentials in two\ndimensions (it can be atoms confined in two dimensions or tri-exciton states in\nheterostructures or dihalogenated materials). The bosons are classified in two\nspecies (a,b) such that a-a and b-b pairs repel each other and a-b attract each\nother, forming the two-particle bound state with binding energy\n$\\epsilon_b^{(2)}$ (such as bi-exciton). We developed an efficient routine\nbased on the proper choice of basis for analytic and numerical calculations.\nFor zero-angular momentum we found the energies of the three-particle bound\nstates $\\epsilon^{(3)}_b$ for wide ranges of the scattering lengths, and found\na universal curve of $\\epsilon^{(3)}_b/\\epsilon^{(2)}_b$ which depends only on\nthe scattering lengths but not the microscopic details of the interactions,\nthis is in contrast to the three-dimensional Efimov effect, where a\nnon-universal three-body parameter is needed.\n", "  A new measurement of the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum by the\nDaya Bay reactor neutrino experiment is reported. The antineutrinos were\ngenerated by six 2.9~GW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$ nuclear reactors and detected by eight\nantineutrino detectors deployed in two near (560~m and 600~m flux-weighted\nbaselines) and one far (1640~m flux-weighted baseline) underground experimental\nhalls. With 621 days of data, more than 1.2 million inverse beta decay (IBD)\ncandidates were detected. The IBD yield in the eight detectors was measured,\nand the ratio of measured to predicted flux was found to be $0.946\\pm0.020$\n($0.992\\pm0.021$) for the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) model. A 2.9~$\\sigma$\ndeviation was found in the measured IBD positron energy spectrum compared to\nthe predictions. In particular, an excess of events in the region of 4-6~MeV\nwas found in the measured spectrum, with a local significance of 4.4~$\\sigma$.\nA reactor antineutrino spectrum weighted by the IBD cross section is extracted\nfor model-independent predictions.\n", "  This work reveals a counter-intuitive but basic process of ionic screening in\nnano-fluidic channels. Steady-state numerical simulations and mathematical\nanalysis show that, under significant longitudinal ionic transport, the\nscreening ionic charges can be locally inverted in the channels: their charge\nsign becomes the same as that of the channel surface charges. The process is\nidentified to originate from the coupling of ionic electro-diffusion transport\nand junction 2-D electrostatics. This finding may expand our understanding on\nionic screening and electrical double layers in nano-channels. Furthermore, the\ncharge inversion process results in a body-force torque on channel fluids,\nwhich is a possible mechanism for vortex generation in the channels and their\nnonlinear current-voltage characteristics.\n", "  The IceCube Collaboration has previously discovered a high-energy\nastrophysical neutrino flux using neutrino events with interaction vertices\ncontained within the instrumented volume of the IceCube detector. We present a\ncomplementary measurement using charged current muon neutrino events where the\ninteraction vertex can be outside this volume. As a consequence of the large\nmuon range the effective area is significantly larger but the field of view is\nrestricted to the Northern Hemisphere. IceCube data from 2009 through 2015 have\nbeen analyzed using a likelihood approach based on the reconstructed muon\nenergy and zenith angle. At the highest neutrino energies between 191 TeV and\n8.3 PeV a significant astrophysical contribution is observed, excluding a\npurely atmospheric origin of these events at $5.6\\,\\sigma$ significance. The\ndata are well described by an isotropic, unbroken power law flux with a\nnormalization at 100 TeV neutrino energy of\n$\\left(0.90^{+0.30}_{-0.27}\\right)\\times10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{GeV^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,sr^{-1}}$\nand a hard spectral index of $\\gamma=2.13\\pm0.13$. The observed spectrum is\nharder in comparison to previous IceCube analyses with lower energy thresholds\nwhich may indicate a break in the astrophysical neutrino spectrum of unknown\norigin. The highest energy event observed has a reconstructed muon energy of\n$(4.5\\pm1.2)\\,\\mathrm{PeV}$ which implies a probability of less than 0.005% for\nthis event to be of atmospheric origin. Analyzing the arrival directions of all\nevents with reconstructed muon energies above 200 TeV no correlation with known\n$\\gamma$-ray sources was found. Using the high statistics of atmospheric\nneutrinos we report the currently best constraints on a prompt atmospheric muon\nneutrino flux originating from charmed meson decays which is below $1.06$ in\nunits of the flux normalization of the model in Enberg et al. (2008).\n", "  Tokamak turbulence, driven by the ion-temperature gradient and occurring in\nthe presence of flow shear, is investigated by means of local, ion-scale,\nelectrostatic gyrokinetic simulations (with both kinetic ions and electrons) of\nthe conditions in the outer core of the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). A\nparameter scan in the local values of the ion-temperature gradient and flow\nshear is performed. It is demonstrated that the experimentally observed state\nis near the stability threshold and that this stability threshold is nonlinear:\nsheared turbulence is subcritical, i.e. the system is formally stable to small\nperturbations, but, given a large enough initial perturbation, it transitions\nto a turbulent state. A scenario for such a transition is proposed and\nsupported by numerical results: close to threshold, the nonlinear saturated\nstate and the associated anomalous heat transport are dominated by long-lived\ncoherent structures, which drift across the domain, have finite amplitudes, but\nare not volume filling; as the system is taken away from the threshold into the\nmore unstable regime, the number of these structures increases until they\noverlap and a more conventional chaotic state emerges. Whereas this appears to\nrepresent a new scenario for transition to turbulence in tokamak plasmas, it is\nreminiscent of the behaviour of other subcritically turbulent systems, e.g.\npipe flows and Keplerian magnetorotational accretion flows.\n", "  We study the instanton partition functions of 5d maximal super Yang-Mills\ntheories with all classical gauge groups. They are computed from the ADHM\nquantum mechanics of the D0-D4-O4 systems. Our partition functions respect\nS-dualities of the circle compactified Yang-Mills theories and various\norientifold backgrounds. We also compute and study the $S^5$ partition\nfunctions that correspond to the 6d (2,0) superconformal indices. Our SO(2N)\nindex takes the form of the vacuum character of $\\mathcal{W}_D$ algebra in a\nspecial limit, supporting the $\\mathcal{W}$ algebra conjecture. We propose new\nindices for (2,0) theories with outer automorphism twists along the temporal\ncircle, obtained from non-simply-laced SYMs on $S^5$.\n", "  When the motion of a probe strongly disturbs the thermal equilibrium of the\nsolvent or bath, the nonlinear response of the latter must enter the probe's\neffective evolution equation. We derive that induced stochastic dynamics using\nsecond order response around the bath thermal equilibrium. We discuss the\nnature of the new term in the evolution equation which is not longer purely\ndissipative, and the appearance of a novel time-scale for the probe related to\nchanges in the dynamical activity of the bath. A major application for the\nobtained nonlinear generalized Langevin equation is in the study of colloid\nmotion in a visco-elastic medium.\n", "  The extended Higgs sector, such as by a second Higgs doublet of type-II,\nprovides portals to dark sector which contains missing particles at the LHC,\ne.g., dark matter (DM) particles. In this paper, working in the simplified\nmodel and taking into consideration the wide decay width effect of the\nmediator, we analyze the characteristic signatures of mono-$b$+MET and 2$b$+MET\nat the LHC. The latter signature was believed to be ineffective, while we found\nthat, with the aid of razor shape analysis, it should be as important as the\nmono-$b$ signature. In the region of relatively low mediator mass (below a few\nhundred GeV), by requiring the signal to background ratio greater than a few\npercent, the 2$b$-tagged razor analysis has comparable sensitivity to the\nmono-$b$ search; it is even better for mediator lighter than $\\sim 200$ GeV.\n", "  The paper presents a novel analysis of Floquet-Bloch flexural waves in a\nperiodic lattice-like structure consisting of flexural beam ligaments. A\nspecial feature of this structure is in the presence of the rotational inertia,\nwhich is commonly neglected in conventional models of the Euler-Bernoulli type.\nThe dispersion properties of the Rayleigh beam structure with rotational\ninertia include degeneracies linked to Dirac cones on the dispersion diagrams\nas well as directional anisotropy and special refraction properties. Steering\nof Dirac cones is described for rectangular flexural structures with a\nrotational inertia. Numerical examples for a forced network of Rayleigh and\nEuler-Bernoulli beams illustrate directional localisation, negative refraction,\nlocalisation at an interface and neutrality for propagating plane waves across\na structured interface for a frequency range corresponding to a Dirac cone.\n", "  We demonstrate the use of several code implementations of the Mellin-Barnes\nmethod available in the public domain to derive analytic expressions for the\nsunset diagrams that arise in the two-loop contribution to the pion mass and\ndecay constant in three-flavoured chiral perturbation theory. We also provide\nresults for all possible two-mass configurations of the sunset integral, and\nderive a new one-dimensional integral representation for the one mass sunset\nintegral with arbitrary external momentum. Thoroughly annotated Mathematica\nnotebooks are provided as ancillary files, which may serve as pedagogical\nsupplements to the methods described in this paper.\n", "  We present the first analysis of the p19MSSM with neutralino dark matter, in\nlight of 13 TeV LHC data with an integrated luminosity of ~14/fb. We recast\ntwelve experimental analyses performed by the ATLAS collaboration and derive\nexclusion bounds on the parameter space of the model. We find that 25% of the\nmodel points can be excluded at 95% C.L. by a combination of the implemented\nsearches. The spectrum allowed after the 13 TeV results are taken into account\npresents stops heavier than at least 400 GeV, gluinos heavier than at least 790\nGeV, and squarks of the first and second generation heavier than at least 440\nGeV.\n", "  Particle acceleration in plasma creates a possibility of exceptionally high\naccelerating gradients and appears as a very attractive option for future\nlinear electron-positron and/or photon-photon colliders. These high\naccelerating gradients were already demonstrated in a number of experiments.\nHowever, a linear collider requires exceptionally high beam brightness which\nstill needs to be demonstrated. In this article we discuss major phenomena\nwhich limit the beam brightness of accelerated beam and, consequently, the\ncollider luminosity.\n", "  We report measurements of the infrared optical response of thin black\nphosphorus under field-effect modulation. We interpret the observed spectral\nchanges as a combination of an ambipolar Burstein-Moss (BM) shift of the\nabsorption edge due to band-filling under gate control, and a quantum confined\nFranz-Keldysh (QCFK) effect, phenomena which have been proposed theoretically\nto occur for black phosphorus under an applied electric field. Distinct optical\nresponses are observed depending on the flake thickness and starting carrier\nconcentration. Transmission extinction modulation amplitudes of more than two\npercent are observed, suggesting the potential for use of black phosphorus as\nan active material in mid-infrared optoelectronic modulator applications.\n", "  Transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) gluon distributions have different\noperator definitions, depending on the process under consideration. We study\nthat aspect of TMD factorization in the small-x limit, for the various\nunpolarized TMD gluon distributions encountered in the literature. To do this,\nwe consider di-jet production in hadronic collisions, since this process allows\nto be exhaustive with respect to the possible operator definitions, and is\nsuitable to be investigated at small x. Indeed, for forward and nearly\nback-to-back jets, one can apply both the TMD factorization and Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) approaches to compute the di-jet cross-section, and compare\nthe results. Doing so, we show that both descriptions coincide, and we show how\nto express the various TMD gluon distributions in terms of CGC correlators of\nWilson lines, while keeping Nc finite. We then proceed to evaluate them by\nsolving the JIMWLK equation numerically. We obtain that at large transverse\nmomentum, the process dependence essentially disappears, while at small\ntransverse momentum, non-linear saturation effects impact the various TMD gluon\ndistributions in very different ways. We notice the presence of a geometric\nscaling regime for all the TMD gluon distributions studied: the \"dipole\" one,\nthe Weizs\\\"acker-Williams one, and the six others involved in forward di-jet\nproduction.\n", "  A hallmark of Weyl semimetal is the existence of surface Fermi arcs\nconnecting two surface-projected Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities. An\nintriguing question is what determines the connectivity of surface Fermi arcs,\nwhen multiple pairs of Weyl nodes are present. To answer this question, we\nfirst show that the locations of surface Fermi arcs are predominantly\ndetermined by the condition that the Zak phase integrated along the normal\ndirection to the surface is $\\pi$. More importantly, the Zak phase can reveal\nthe peculiar topological structure of Weyl semimetal directly in the bulk.\nHere, we show that the non-trivial winding of the Zak phase around each\nprojected Weyl node manifests itself as a topological defect of the\nWannier-Stark ladder, the energy eigenstates emerging under an electric field.\nRemarkably, this structure leads to \"bulk Fermi arcs,\" i.e., open line segments\nin the bulk momentum spectra. It is argued that bulk Fermi arcs should exist in\nconjunction with the surface counterparts to conserve the Weyl fermion number\nunder an electric field, which is supported by explicit numerical evidence.\n", "  We study hard diffractive scattering in hadron-hadron collisions including,\non top of the standard Pomeron-initiated processes, contributions due to the\nexchange of Reggeons. Using a simple model to describe the parton content of\nthe Reggeon, we compute di-jet production in single diffractive and central\ndiffractive events. We show that Reggeon contributions can be sizable at the\nLHC, and even sometimes dominant, and we identify kinematic windows in which\nthey could be experimentally studied. We argue that suitable measurements must\nbe performed in order to properly constrain the model, and be able to correctly\naccount for Reggeon exchanges in the analysis of the many hard diffractive\nobservables to be measured at the LHC.\n", "  The 2nd and 3rd order nonlinear microwave response of a superconducting\nYBa2Cu3O7 thin film resonator was synchronously measured using three input\ntones. This technique permits the local measurement, and hence mapping, of\nintermodulation distortion (IMD) inside the resonator. 2nd and 3rd order IMD\nmeasured with a fixed probe relaxed in remarkably different ways after the\nremoval of a static magnetic field. The 2nd order IMD relaxed by two different\nmagnetic processes, a fast process that appears related to bulk remanent\nmagnetization, and a slow process that fits the description of Bean and\nLivingston. The 3rd order IMD relaxes by only one process which is distinct\nfrom the two processes controlling 2nd order relaxation.\n", "  Volumetric sediment concentrations computed by phase-resolving swash\nmorphodynamic models are shown to exceed unity minus porosity (i.e. the maximal\nphysically possible concentration value) by up to factor of $10^5$ when using\nstandard expressions to compute the sediment transport rate. An ad hoc limit of\nsediment concentration is introduced as a means to evaluate consequences of\nexceeding physically realistic concentration by standard expressions. We find\nthat implementation of this ad hoc limit strongly changes the quantitative and\nqualitative predictions of phase-resolving swash morphodynamic models,\nsuggesting that existing swash predictions are unreliable. This is because\nstandard expressions inappropriately consider or ignore the fact that the\nshallow swash water depth limits the storage capacity of transported sediment.\n", "  We consider two interacting bosons in a dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nlattice. We identify a rich variety of two-body states. In particular, for open\nboundary conditions and moderate interactions, edge bound states (EBS) are\npresent even for the dimerization that does not sustain single-particle edge\nstates. Moreover, for large values of the interactions, we find a breaking of\nthe standard bulk-boundary correspondence. Based on the mapping of two\ninteracting particles in one dimension onto a single particle in two\ndimensions, we propose an experimentally realistic coupled optical fibers setup\nas quantum simulator of the two-body SSH model. This setup is able to highlight\nthe localization properties of the states as well as the presence of a resonant\nscattering mechanism provided by a bound state that crosses the scattering\ncontinuum, revealing the closed-channel population in real time and real space.\n", "  We present a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the lifetime\nof weakly bound dimers formed near narrow interspecies Feshbach resonances in\nmass-imbalanced Fermi-Fermi systems, considering the specific example of a\nmixture of $^6$Li and $^{40}$K atoms. Our work addresses the central question\nof the increase in the stability of the dimers resulting from Pauli suppression\nof collisional losses, which is a well-known effect in mass-balanced fermionic\nsystems near broad resonances. We present measurements of the spontaneous\ndissociation of dimers in dilute samples, and of the collisional losses in\ndense samples arising from both dimer-dimer processes and from atom-dimer\nprocesses. We find that all loss processes are suppressed close to the Feshbach\nresonance. Our general theoretical approach for fermionic mixtures near narrow\nFeshbach resonances provides predictions for the suppression of collisional\ndecay as a function of the detuning from resonance, and we find excellent\nagreement with the experimental benchmarks provided by our $^6$Li-$^{40}$K\nsystem. We finally present model calculations for other Feshbach-resonant\nFermi-Fermi systems, which are of interest for experiments in the near future.\n", "  The study of photoexcited strongly correlated materials is attracting growing\ninterest since their rich phase diagram often translates into an equally rich\nout-of-equilibrium behavior, including non-thermal phases and photoinduced\nphase transitions. With femtosecond optical pulses, electronic and lattice\ndegrees of freedom can be transiently decoupled, giving the opportunity of\nstabilizing new states of matter inaccessible by quasi-adiabatic pathways. Here\nwe present a study of the ultrafast non-equilibrium evolution of the prototype\nMott-Hubbard material V2O3, which presents a transient non-thermal phase\ndeveloping immediately after photoexcitation and lasting few picoseconds. For\nboth the insulating and the metallic phase, the formation of the transient\nconfiguration is triggered by the excitation of electrons into the bonding a1g\norbital, and is then stabilized by a lattice distortion characterized by a\nmarked hardening of the A1g coherent phonon. This configuration is in stark\ncontrast with the thermally accessible ones - the A1g phonon frequency actually\nsoftens when heating the material. Our results show the importance of selective\nelectron-lattice interplay for the ultrafast control of material parameters,\nand are of particular relevance for the optical manipulation of strongly\ncorrelated systems, whose electronic and structural properties are often\nstrongly intertwinned.\n", "  This work addresses the dynamical quantum problem of a driven discrete energy\nlevel coupled to a semi-infinite continuum whose density of states has a\nsquare-root-type singularity, such as states of a free particle in one\ndimension or quasiparticle states in a BCS superconductor. The system dynamics\nis strongly affected by the quantum-mechanical repulsion between the discrete\nlevel and the singularity, which gives rise to a bound state, suppresses the\ndecay into the continuum, and can produce Stueckelberg oscillations. This\nquantum coherence effect may limit the performance of mesoscopic\nsuperconducting devices, such as quantum electron turnstile.\n", "  We compare the time evolution of entanglement measures after local operator\nexcitation in the critical Ising model with predictions from conformal field\ntheory. For the spin operator and its descendants we find that Renyi entropies\nof a block of spins increase by a constant that matches the logarithm of the\nquantum dimension of the conformal family. However, for the energy operator we\nfind a small constant contribution that differs from the conformal field theory\nanswer equal to zero. We argue that the mismatch is caused by the subtleties in\nthe identification between the local operators in conformal field theory and\ntheir lattice counterpart. Our results indicate that evolution of entanglement\nmeasures in locally excited states not only constraints this identification,\nbut also can be used to extract non-trivial data about the conformal field\ntheory that governs the critical point. We generalize our analysis to the Ising\nmodel away from the critical point, states with multiple local excitations, as\nwell as the evolution of the relative entropy after local operator excitation\nand discuss universal features that emerge from numerics.\n", "  Knowledge of the material in the ATLAS inner tracking detector is crucial in\nunderstanding the reconstruction of charged-particle tracks, the performance of\nalgorithms that identify jets containing b-hadrons and is also essential to\nreduce background in searches for exotic particles that can decay within the\ninner detector volume. Interactions of primary hadrons produced in pp\ncollisions with the material in the inner detector are used to map the location\nand amount of this material. The hadronic interactions of primary particles may\nresult in secondary vertices, which in this analysis are reconstructed by an\ninclusive vertex-finding algorithm. Data were collected using minimum-bias\ntriggers by the ATLAS detector operating at the LHC during 2010 at\ncentre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of $19$ nb$^{-1}$. Kinematic properties of these secondary vertices\nare used to study the validity of the modelling of hadronic interactions in\nsimulation. Secondary-vertex yields are compared between data and simulation\nover a volume of about 0.7 m$^3$ around the interaction point, and agreement is\nfound within overall uncertainties.\n", "  A search for dark matter pair production in association with a Higgs boson\ndecaying to a pair of bottom quarks is presented, using 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of $pp$\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector\nat the LHC. The decay of the Higgs boson is reconstructed as a high-momentum\n$b\\bar{b}$ system with either a pair of small-radius jets, or a single\nlarge-radius jet with substructure. The observed data are found to be\nconsistent with the expected backgrounds. Results are interpreted using a\nsimplified model with a $Z'$ gauge boson mediating the interaction between dark\nmatter and the Standard Model as well as a two-Higgs-doublet model containing\nan additional $Z'$ boson which decays to a Standard Model Higgs boson and a new\npseudoscalar Higgs boson, the latter decaying into a pair of dark matter\nparticles.\n", "  We review the recent, mainly theoretical, progress in the study of\ntopological nodal line semimetals in three dimensions. In these semimetals, the\nconduction and the valence bands cross each other along a one-dimensional curve\nin the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, and any perturbation that preserves a\ncertain symmetry group (generated by either spatial symmetries or time-reversal\nsymmetry) cannot remove this crossing line and open a full direct gap between\nthe two bands. The nodal line(s) is hence topologically protected by the\nsymmetry group, and can be associated with a topological invariant. In this\nReview, (i) we enumerate the symmetry groups that may protect a topological\nnodal line; (ii) we write down the explicit form of the topological invariant\nfor each of these symmetry groups in terms of the wave functions on the Fermi\nsurface, establishing a topological classification; (iii) for certain classes,\nwe review the proposals for the realization of these semimetals in real\nmaterials and (iv) we discuss different scenarios that when the protecting\nsymmetry is broken, how a topological nodal line semimetal becomes Weyl\nsemimetals, Dirac semimetals and other topological phases and (v) we discuss\nthe possible physical effects accessible to experimental probes in these\nmaterials.\n", "  We study the ground-state behavior of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) in a\nRaman-laser-assisted one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice potential forming a\nmultilayer system. We find that, such system can be described by an effective\nmodel with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of pseudospin $(N-1)/2$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of layers. Due to the intricate interplay between atomic interactions,\nSOC and laser-assisted tunnelings, the ground-state phase diagrams generally\nconsist of three phases -- a stripe, a plane wave and a normal phase with\nzero-momentum, touching at a quantum tricritical point. More important, even\nthough the single-particle states only minimize at zero-momentum for odd $N$,\nthe many-body ground states may still develop finite momenta. The underlying\nmechanisms are elucidated. Our results provide an alternative way to realize an\neffective spin-orbit coupling of Bose gas with the Raman-laser-assisted optical\nlattice, and would also be beneficial to the studies on SOC effects in spinor\nBose systems with large spin.\n", "  Anisotropic nanomaterials possess interesting thermal transport properties\nbecause they allow orientation of heat fluxes along preferential directions due\nto a high ratio (up to three orders of magnitude) between their in-plane and\ncross-plane thermal conductivities. Among different techniques allowing thermal\nconductivity evaluation, micro-Raman scattering is known to be one of the most\nefficient contactless measurement approaches. In this letter, a new\nexperimental approach based on Raman scattering measurements with variable\nlaser spot sizes is reported. Correlation between experimental and calculated\nthermal resistances of one-dimensional nanocrystalline solids allows\nsimultaneous estimation of their in-plane and cross-plane thermal\nconductivities. In particular, our measurement approach is illustrated to be\nsuccessfully applied for anisotropic thermal conductivity evaluation of silicon\nnanowire arrays.\n", "  Momentum and energy conservation are fundamental tenets of physics, that\nvalid physical theories have to satisfy. In the reversible transformation\nbetween superconducting and normal phases in the presence of a magnetic field,\nthe mechanical momentum of the supercurrent has to be transferred to the body\nas a whole and vice versa, the kinetic energy of the supercurrent stays in the\nelectronic degrees of freedom, and no energy is dissipated nor entropy is\ngenerated in the process. We argue on general grounds that to explain these\nprocesses it is necessary that the electromagnetic field mediates the transfer\nof momentum between electrons and the body as a whole, and this requires that\nwhen the phase boundary between normal and superconducting phases is displaced,\na flow and counterflow of charge occurs in direction perpendicular to the phase\nboundary. This flow and counterflow does not occur according to the\nconventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity, therefore we argue that\nwithin BCS-London theory the Meissner transition is a `forbidden transition'.\nFurthermore, to explain the phase transformation in a way that is consistent\nwith the experimental observations requires that (i) the wavefunction $and$\ncharge distribution of superconducting electrons near the phase boundary extend\ninto the normal phase, and (ii) that the charge carriers in the normal state\nhave hole-like character. The conventional theory of superconductivity does not\nhave these physical elements, the theory of hole superconductivity does.\n", "  Directionally sensitive dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments present\nthe only way to observe the full three-dimensional velocity distribution of the\nMilky Way halo local to Earth. In this work we compare methods for extracting\ninformation about the local DM velocity distribution from a set of recoil\ndirections and energies in a range of hypothetical directional and\nnon-directional experiments. We compare a model independent empirical\nparameterisation of the velocity distribution based on an angular\ndiscretisation with a model dependent approach which assumes knowledge of the\nfunctional form of the distribution. The methods are tested under three\ndistinct halo models which cover a range of possible phase space structures for\nthe local velocity distribution: a smooth Maxwellian halo, a tidal stream and a\ndebris flow. In each case we use simulated directional data to attempt to\nreconstruct the shape and parameters describing each model as well as the DM\nparticle properties. We find that the empirical parametrisation is able to make\naccurate unbiased reconstructions of the DM mass and cross section as well as\ncapture features in the underlying velocity distribution in certain directions\nwithout any assumptions about its true functional form. We also find that by\nextracting directionally averaged velocity parameters with this method one can\ndiscriminate between halo models with different classes of substructure.\n", "  $R_K$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ are two $B$-decay measurements that presently exhibit\ndiscrepancies with the SM. Recently, using an effective field theory approach,\nit was demonstrated that a new-physics model can simultaneously explain both\nthe $R_K$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ puzzles. There are two UV completions that can give\nrise to the effective Lagrangian: (i) $VB$: a vector boson that transforms as\nan $SU(2)_L$ triplet, as in the SM, (ii) $U_1$: an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector\nleptoquark. In this paper, we examine these models individually. A key point is\nthat $VB$ contributes to $B^0_s$-${\\bar B}^0_s$ mixing and $\\tau \\to 3\\mu$,\nwhile $U_1$ does not. We show that, when constraints from these processes are\ntaken into account, the $VB$ model is just barely viable. It predicts ${\\cal B}\n(\\tau^-\\to\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-) \\simeq 2.1 \\times 10^{-8}$. This is measurable at\nBelle II and LHCb, and therefore constitutes a smoking-gun signal of $VB$. For\n$U_1$, there are several observables that may point to this model. Perhaps the\nmost interesting is the lepton-flavor-violating decay $\\Upsilon(3S) \\to \\mu\n\\tau$, which has previously been overlooked in the literature. $U_1$ predicts\n${\\cal B}(\\Upsilon(3S) \\to \\mu \\tau)|_{\\rm max} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-7}$. Thus, if\na large value of ${\\cal B}(\\Upsilon(3S) \\to \\mu \\tau)$ is observed -- and this\nshould be measurable at Belle II -- the $U_1$ model would be indicated.\n", "  In the present paper, the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) with the nearest-neighbor\n(NN) repulsions is studied from the view point of possible bosonic analogs of\nthe fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state in the vicinity of the Mott insulator\n(MI). First, by means of the Gutzwiller approximation, we obtain the phase\ndiagram of the BHM in a magnetic field. Then, we introduce an effective\nHamiltonian describing excess particles on a MI and calculate the vortex\ndensity, momentum distribution and the energy gap. These calculations indicate\nthat the vortex solid forms for small NN repulsions, but a homogeneous\nfeatureless `Bose-metal' takes the place of it as the NN repulsion increases.\nWe consider particular filling factors at which the bosonic FQH state is\nexpected to form. Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory to the excess particle is\nintroduced, and a modified Gutzwiller wave function, which describes bosons\nwith attached flux quanta, is introduced. The energy of the excess particles in\nthe bosonic FQH state is calculated using that wave function, and it is\ncompared with the energy of the vortex solid and Bose-metal. We found that the\nenergy of the bosonic FQH state is lower than that of the Bose-metal and\ncomparable with the vortex solid. Finally, we clarify the condition that the\ncomposite fermion appears by using CS theory on the lattice that we previously\nproposed for studying the electron FQH effect.\n", "  In the course of the past several years holography has emerged as an ab\ninitio tool in exploring strongly-time-dependent phenomena in gauge theories.\nThese lecture notes overview recent developments in this area driven by\nphenomenological questions concerning applicability of hydrodynamics\n(hydrodynamization) under extreme conditions occurring in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The topics include hydrodynamization time\nscale, holographic collisions, as well as hydrodynamization from the point of\nview of the asymptotic character of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion. The\nemphasis is put on concepts rather than calculational techniques and a\nparticular attention is devoted to present these developments in the context of\nthe most recent advances and some of the open problems.\n", "  We study how properties of discrete dark matter halos depend on halo\nenvironment, characterized by the mass density around the halos on scales from\n0.5 to 16 $h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$. We find that low mass halos (those less massive\nthan the characteristic mass $M_{\\rm C}$ of halos collapsing at a given epoch)\nin high-density environments have lower accretion rates, lower spins, higher\nconcentrations, and rounder shapes than halos in median density environments.\nHalos in median and low-density environments have similar accretion rates and\nconcentrations, but halos in low density environments have lower spins and are\nmore elongated. Halos of a given mass in high-density regions accrete material\nearlier than halos of the same mass in lower-density regions. All but the most\nmassive halos in high-density regions are losing mass (i.e., being stripped) at\nlow redshifts, which causes artificially lowered NFW scale radii and increased\nconcentrations. Tidal effects are also responsible for the decreasing spins of\nlow mass halos in high density regions at low redshifts $z < 1$, by\npreferentially removing higher angular momentum material from halos. Halos in\nlow-density regions have lower than average spins because they lack nearby\nhalos whose tidal fields can spin them up. We also show that the simulation\ndensity distribution is well fit by an Extreme Value Distribution, and that the\ndensity distribution becomes broader with cosmic time.\n", "  We analyse a quantum Otto refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit\ncoupled to two LC-resonators each including a resistor acting as a reservoir.\nWe find various operation regimes: nearly adiabatic (low driving frequency),\nideal Otto cycle (intermediate frequency), and non-adiabatic coherent regime\n(high frequency). In the nearly adiabatic regime, the cooling power is\nquadratic in frequency, and we find substantially enhanced coefficient of\nperformance $\\epsilon$, as compared to that of an ideal Otto cycle. Quantum\ncoherent effects lead invariably to decrease in both cooling power and\n$\\epsilon$ as compared to purely classical dynamics. In the non-adiabatic\nregime we observe strong coherent oscillations of the cooling power as a\nfunction of frequency. We investigate various driving waveforms: compared to\nthe standard sinusoidal drive, truncated trapezoidal drive with optimized rise\nand dwell times yields higher cooling power and efficiency.\n", "  We study spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions\n($t$-$V$ model) on the two-dimensional three-band Lieb lattice. At\nhalf-filling, the free electronic band structure consists of a flat band at\nzero energy and a single cone with linear dispersion. The flat band is expected\nto be unstable upon inclusion of electronic correlations, and a natural channel\nis charge order. However, due to the three-orbital unit cell, commensurate\ncharge order implies an imbalance of electron and hole densities and therefore\ndoping away from half-filling. Our numerical results show that below a\nfinite-temperature Ising transition a charge density wave with one electron and\ntwo holes per unit cell and its partner under particle-hole transformation are\nspontaneously generated. Our calculations are based on recent advances in\nauxiliary-field and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations that allow\nsign-free simulations of spinless fermions at half-filling. It is argued that\nparticle-hole symmetry breaking provides a route to access levels of finite\ndoping, without introducing a sign problem.\n", "  We present a new class of solutions to the Einstein field equations for an\nanisotropic matter distribution in which the interior space-time obeys the\nKarmarkar condition. The necessary and sufficient condition required for a\nspherically symmetric space-time to be of class one reduces the gravitational\nbehavior of the model to a single metric function. By assuming a physically\nviable form for the $g_{rr}$ metric potential we obtain an exact solution of\nthe Einstein field equations which is free from any singularities and satisfies\nall the physical criteria. We utilize this solution to predict the masses and\nradii of well-known compact objects such as Cen X-3, PSR J0348+0432,\nPSRB0943+10 and XTE J1739-285.\n  To be publish in Chinese Physics C (Accepted)\n", "  Electric charge detection by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with single-\nelectron resolution (e-EFM) is a promising way to investigate the electronic\nlevel structure of individual quantum dots (QD). The oscillating AFM tip\nmodulates the energy of the QDs, causing single electrons to tunnel between QDs\nand an electrode. The resulting oscillating electrostatic force changes the\nresonant frequency and damping of the AFM cantilever, enabling electrometry\nwith a single-electron sensitivity. Quantitative electronic level spectroscopy\nis possible by sweeping the bias voltage. Charge stability diagram can be\nobtained by scanning the AFM tip around the QD. e-EFM technique enables to\ninvestigate individual colloidal nanoparticles and self- assembled QDs without\nnanoscale electrodes. e-EFM is a quantum electromechanical system where the\nback-action of a tunneling electron is detected by AFM; it can also be\nconsidered as a mechanical analog of admittance spectroscopy with a radio\nfrequency resonator, which is emerging as a promising tool for quantum state\nreadout for quantum computing. In combination with the topography imaging\ncapability of the AFM, e-EFM is a powerful tool for investigating new nanoscale\nmaterial systems which can be used as quantum bits.\n", "  The covariant spectator quark model, tested before in a variety of\nelectromagnetic baryon excitations, is applied here to the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to\nN^\\ast(1520)$ reaction in the timelike regime. The transition form factors are\nfirst parametrized in the spacelike region in terms of a valence quark core\nmodel together with a parametrization of the meson cloud contribution. The form\nfactor behavior in the timelike region is then predicted, as well as the\n$N^\\ast(1520) \\to \\gamma N$ decay width and the $N^\\ast (1520)$ Dalitz decay,\n$N^\\ast (1520) \\to e^+ e^- N$. Our results may help in the interpretation of\ndielectron production from elementary $pp$ collisions and from the new\ngeneration of HADES results using a pion beam. In the $q^2=0$--1 GeV$^2$ range\nwe conclude that the {\\it QED approximation} (a $q^2$ independent form factor\nmodel) underestimates the electromagnetic coupling of the $N^\\ast(1520)$ from 1\nup to 2 orders of magnitude. We conclude also that the $N^\\ast (1520)$ and the\n$\\Delta(1232)$ Dalitz decay widths are comparable.\n", "  A one dimensional stochastic exclusion process with two species of particles,\n$+$ and $-$, is studied where density of each species can fluctuate but the\ntotal particle density is conserved. From the exact stationary state weights we\nshow that, in the limiting case where density of negative particles vanishes,\nthe system undergoes a phase separation transition where a macroscopic domain\nof vacancies form in front of a single surviving negative particle. We also\nshow that the phase separated state is associated with a diverging correlation\nlength for any density and the critical exponents characterizing the behaviour\nin this region are different from those at the transition line. The static and\nthe dynamical critical exponents are obtained from the exact solution and\nnumerical simulations, respectively.\n", "  The coupling of spins to long-wavelength bosonic modes is a prominent means\nto engineer long-range spin-spin interactions, and has been realized in a\nvariety of platforms, such as atoms in optical cavities and trapped ions. To\ndate, much of the experimental focus has been on the realization of long-range\nIsing models, but generalizations to other spin models are highly desirable. In\nthis work, we explore a previously unappreciated connection between the\nrealization of an XY model by off-resonant driving of single sideband of boson\nexcitation (i.e.~a single-beam M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen scheme) and a\nboson-mediated Ising simulator in the presence of a transverse field. In\nparticular, we show that these two schemes have the same effective Hamiltonian\nin suitably defined rotating frames, and analyze the emergent effective XY spin\nmodel through truncated Magnus series and numerical simulations. In addition to\nXY spin-spin interactions that can be non-perturbatively renormalized from the\nnaive Ising spin-spin coupling constants, we find an effective transverse field\nthat is dependent on the thermal energy of the bosons, as well as other\nspin-boson couplings that cause spin-boson entanglement not to vanish at any\ntime. In the case of a boson-mediated Ising simulator with transverse field, we\ndiscuss the crossover from transverse-field Ising-like to XY-like spin behavior\nas a function of field strength.\n", "  The discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect in the early eighties of the\nlast century, with highly precise quantization values for the Hall conductance\nin multiples of $e^2/h$, has been the first fascinating manifestation of the\ntopological state of matter driven by magnetic field and disorder, and related\nto the formation of non-dissipative current flow. In 2005, several new\nphenomena such as the spin Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect were\npredicted in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and vanishing external\nmagnetic field. More recently, the Zeeman spin Hall effect and the formation of\nvalley Hall topological currents have been introduced for graphene-based\nsystems, under time-reversal or inversion symmetry-breaking conditions,\nrespectively. This review presents a comprehensive coverage of all these Hall\neffects in disordered graphene from the perspective of numerical simulations of\nquantum transport in two-dimensional bulk systems (by means of the Kubo\nformalism) and multiterminal nanostructures (by means of the\nLandauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker scattering and nonequilibrium Green function approaches).\nIn contrast to usual two-dimensional electron gases, the presence of defects in\ngraphene generates more complex electronic features such as electron-hole\nasymmetry, defect resonances or percolation effect between localized impurity\nstates, which, together with extra degrees of freedom (sublattice pseudospin,\nvalley isospin), bring a higher degree of complexity and enlarge the transport\nphase diagram.\n", "  We obtain a new solution of the TOV-equation for an anisotropic fluid\ndistribution by imposing the Karmarkar condition. In order to close the system\nof equations we postulate an interesting form for the grr gravitational\npotential which allows us to solve for gtt metric component via the Karmarkar\ncondition. We demonstrate that the new interior solution has well-behaved\nphysical attributes and can be utilized to model relativistic static fluid\nspheres. By using observational data sets for the radii and mass-to-radius\nrelations for compact stars such as 4U 1538-52, LMC X-4 and PSR J1614- 2230 we\nshow that our solution describes these objects to a very good degree of\naccuracy. The physical plausibility of the solution depends on a parameter $c$\nfor a particular star. For 4U 1538-52 the solution behaves well for $0.1574 \\le\nc \\le 0.46$ which corresponds to $1 \\ge v^2_{r0} \\ge 0:13$, $0.91 \\ge\nv^2_{t0}\\ge 0.04$ and $17.8 \\ge \\Gamma_0 \\ge 3.8$. For LMC X-4 the solution\nbehaves well for $0.1235 \\le c \\le 0.35$ which corresponds to $0.99 \\ge\nv^2_{r0} \\ge 0.15$, $0.91 \\ge v^2_{t0}\\ge 0.06$ and $15.35 \\ge \\Gamma_0 \\ge\n3.35$. Our model approximates the pulsar PSR J1614-2230 for $0.05 \\le c \\le\n0.13$ which corresponds to $1 \\ge v^2_{r0}\\ge 0.21$, $0.94 \\ge v^2_{t0} \\ge\n0.13$ and $8.34 \\ge \\Gamma_0 \\ge 2.34$. Our observations of the behavior of the\nthermodynamical and physical variables of these compact objects lead us to\nconclude that the parameter c plays an important role in determining the\nequation of state of the stellar material. It is apparent that smaller values\nof c lead to stiffer equation of states and vice-versa.\n", "  Instantaneous quantum polynomial time (IQP) is a model of (probably)\nnon-universal quantum computation. Since it has been proven that IQP circuits\nare unlikely to be simulated classically up to a multiplicative error and an\nerror in the $l_1$ norm, IQP is considered as one of the promising classes that\ndemonstrates quantum supremacy. Although IQP circuits can be realized more\neasily than a universal quantum computer, demonstrating quantum supremacy is\nstill difficult. It is therefore desired to find subclasses of IQP that are\neasy to implement. In this paper, by imposing some restrictions on IQP, we\npropose ancilla-driven IQP (ADIQP) as the subclass of commuting quantum\ncomputation suitable for many experimental settings. We show that even though\nADIQP circuits are strictly weaker than IQP circuits in a sense, they are also\nhard to simulate classically up to a multiplicative error and an error in the\n$l_1$ norm. Moreover, the properties of ADIQP make it easy to investigate the\nverifiability of ADIQP circuits and the difficulties in realizing ADIQP\ncircuits.\n", "  We report on the results of a recent blind search survey for gamma-ray\npulsars in Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data being carried out on the\ndistributed volunteer computing system, Einstein@Home. The survey has searched\nfor pulsations in 118 unidentified pulsar-like sources, requiring about 10,000\nyears of CPU core time. In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of\n17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an\naccompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with\ncharacteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between\n$10^{34}$ and $4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s. Two of these are the slowest spinning\ngamma-ray pulsars yet known. One pulsar experienced a very large glitch $\\Delta\nf/f \\approx 3.5\\times10^{-6}$ during the Fermi mission. In this, the first of\ntwo associated papers, we describe the search scheme used in this survey, and\nestimate the sensitivity of our search to pulsations in unidentified Fermi-LAT\nsources. One such estimate results in an upper limit of 57% for the fraction of\npulsed emission from the gamma-ray source associated with the Cas A supernova\nremnant, constraining the pulsed gamma-ray photon flux that can be produced by\nthe neutron star at its center. We also present the results of precise timing\nanalyses for each of the newly detected pulsars.\n", "  Adaptive measurements were recently shown to significantly improve the\nperformance of quantum state tomography. Utilizing information about the system\nfor the on-line choice of optimal measurements allows to reach the ultimate\nbounds of precision for state reconstruction. In this article we generalize an\nadaptive Bayesian approach to the case of process tomography and experimentally\nshow its superiority in the task of learning unknown quantum operations. Our\nexperiments with photonic polarization qubits cover all types of single-qubit\nchannels. We also discuss instrumental errors and the criteria for evaluation\nof the ultimate achievable precision in an experiment. It turns out, that\nadaptive tomography provides a lower noise floor in the presence of strong\ntechnical noise.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the manipulation of the motional states of\ntrapped ground-state atoms using Rydberg dressing via nonresonant laser fields.\nThe forces resulting from Rydberg-state interaction between dressed neighboring\natoms in an array of microtraps or an optical lattice can strongly couple their\nmotion. We show that intensity modulation of the dressing field allows to\nsqueeze the relative motion of a pair of atoms and generate non-classical\nmechanical states. Extending this pairwise scheme to one-dimensional chains\nprovides flexible control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of the whole\nsystem. We illustrate our findings with protocols to manipulate all motional\ndegrees of freedom of a pair of atoms and create entangled states. We also\npresent a method to transfer non-classical correlations along an atomic chain\nof nontrivial length. The long-lived nature of motional states, together with\nthe high tunability of Rydberg dressing, makes our proposal feasible for\ncurrent experimental setups.\n", "  This work shows that notable acceleration of the speed of calculating\nChandrasekhar's H-functions for general laws of scattering with an iterative\nmethod can be realized by supplying a starting pproximation produced by the\nfollowing procedure: (i) in the cases of azimuth-angle independent Fourier\ncomponents, values of the isotropic scattering H-function given by an accurate\nyet simple-to-apply formula, in particular, the one by Kawabata and Limaye\n(Astrophys. and Space Sci.

In this work we explore the effect of\nphotophoresis on the settling of large dust grains in the inner regions of\nactively accreting protoplanetary disks. Photophoretic forces on dust grains\nresult from the collision of gas molecules with differentially heated grains.\nWe undertake one dimensional dust settling calculations to determine the\nequilibrium vertical distribution of dust grains in each column of the disk. In\nthe process we introduce a new treatment of the photophoresis force which is\nconsistent at all optical depths with the representation of the radiative\nintensity field in a two-stream radiative transfer approximation. The\nlevitation of large dust grains creates a photophoretic dust trap several scale\nheights above the mid-plane in the inner regions of the disk where the\ndissipation of accretion energy is significant. We find that differential\nsettling of dust grains is radically altered in these regions of the disk, with\nlarge dust grains trapped in a layer below the stellar irradiation surface in\nwhere the dust to gas mass ratio can be enhanced by a factor of a hundred for\nthe relevant particles. The photophoretic trapping effect has a strong\ndependence on particle size and porosity.\n", "  We compute the Weyl symbol of the resolvent of the harmonic oscillator and\nstudy its properties.\n", "  In this paper we have studied the extended phase space thermodynamics in the\ncanonical ensemble of black holes in massive gravity in AdS space. The black\nholes considered here belong to a theory of massive gravity where the graviton\ngain a mass due to Lorentz symmetry breaking. We have computed various\nthermodynamical quantities such as temperature, pressure, Gibbs free energy and\nspecific heat capacity. The local and the global thermodynamical stability of\nthe black holes are studied in detail. For a specific value of the parameter in\nthe theory, the black holes undergo a first order phase transition similar to\nthe Van der Waals phase transitions between gas and liquid under constant\ntemperature. This transition is between the small and the large black hole. The\ncritical exponents are computed at the critical values and shown to be the same\nas for the Van der Waals critical exponents.\n", "  An accurate description of nonadiabatic dynamics of molecular species on\nmetallic surfaces poses a serious computational challenge associated with a\nmultitude of closely-spaced electronic states. We propose a mixed\nquantum-classical scheme that addresses this challenge by introducing\ncollective electronic variables. These variables are defined through analytic\nblock-diagonalization applied to the time-dependent Hamiltonian matrix\ngoverning the electronic dynamics. We compare our scheme with the Ehrenfest\napproach and with a full-memory electronic friction model on a one-dimensional\n\"adatom + atomic chain\" model. Our simulations demonstrate that collective-mode\ndynamics with only few (2-3) electronic variables is robust and can describe a\nvariety of situations: from a chemisorbed atom on an insulator to an atom on a\nmetallic surface. Our molecular model also reveals that the friction approach\nis prone to unpredictable and catastrophic failures.\n", "  The energy gap of superconducting $PbTe-PbS$ semiconductor superlattices has\nbeen analyzed with the help of point contacts for the first time below the\ncritical temperature, $T_{c}=3.9~K$, and in the fluctuation region $T>T_{c}$.\nThe size of the gap and its dependence on the temperature and field are\ndetermined by the position of the point contact inside the superlattice.\n\\pacs{73.40.Jn, 74.25.Kc, 74.45.+c, 74.50.+r., 73.40.-c, 74.78.-w, 74.78.Fk,\n74.20.Mn, 74.40.+k.-n, 74.45.+c, 74.62.Dn, 74.70.Ad\n", "  Superconducting (SC) superlattices (SL) of the epitaxial semiconductor\n$PbTe-PbS$/(001) $KCl$ with two-dimensional ordered misfit dislocation (MD)\nnetworks across heteroboundaries (HB) are studied, and the obtained results are\ncompared with the corresponding data for $YBaCuO$. An analysis of the\nfluctuational region showed that the pairing of electrons in SL takes place at\nthe sites of dislocation networks. In the region of SC fluctuations, the IVC\nderivatives of point-contacts (PC) based on SL and HTS display a\nmetal-insulator transition associated with delocalization of carriers from the\nvicinity of the structural elements responsible for the emergence of SC. The\ncritical current density in a superlattice is determined, and a mechanism is\nproposed for formation of excess current on the IVC of PC based on SL and HTS.\nThe values of the energy gap $\\Delta_0$ at low temperatures in units of $kT_c$\nare found to be anomalously large for SL and HTS. For anisotropic\nthree-dimensional SL with a strong bond between two-dimensional SC planes, two\ngaps emerge from the MD. For quasi-two-dimensional SL with a weak bond between\ntwo-dimensional SC planes, the $\\Delta(T)$ dependence is nonmonotonic, and the\nfluctuation region for these SL and for HTS reveals a gap that is practically\nindependent of temperature. The IVC derivatives of a $Cu$-SL PC reveal an\noscillating structure which is restricted to an energy of $90\\ meV$ and is\napparently associated with the electron-phonon interaction.

The combination of the two filters decreases the\ntransmission width, while increasing the edge steepness without a significant\nreduction in peak transmittance. Due to the broad spectral transmission of such\ninterference filters compared to the internal mode spacing of blue laser\ndiodes, an additional locking scheme, based on H\\\"ansch-Couillaud locking to a\ncavity, has been added to improve the stability. The laser is stabilized to a\nline in the tellurium spectrum via saturation spectroscopy, and\nsingle-frequency operation for a duration of two days is demonstrated by\nmonitoring the error signal of the lock and the piezo drive compensating the\nlength change of the external resonator due to air pressure variations.\nAdditionally, transmission curves of the filters and the spectra of a sample of\ndiodes are given.\n", "  Studies on the role of fluctuations in signal propagation and on gene\nregulation in monoclonal bacterial population have been extensively pursued\nbased on the machinery of two-component system. The bacterial two-component\nsystem shows noise utilisation through its inherent plasticity. The\nfluctuations propagation takes place using the phosphotransfer module and the\nfeedback mechanism during gene regulation. To delicately observe the noisy\nkinetics the generic cascade needs stochastic investigation at the mRNA and\nprotein levels. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework to investigate\nthe noisy signal transduction in a generic two-component system. The model\nshows reliability in information transmission through quantification of several\nstatistical measures. We further extend our analysis to observe the protein\ndistribution in a population of cells. Through numerical simulation, we\nidentify the regime of the kinetic parameter set that generates a stability\nswitch in the steady state distribution of proteins. The results of our\ntheoretical analysis show key features of the network. The noise permeation and\ninformation propagation in the autoregulation module is feeble. However, the\nphosphotransfer module compensates such weakness and plays a significant role\nin information transmission. The bimodality due to fluctuations pampers the\nemergence of persistence in an isogenic bacterial pool.\n", "  A quaternionic field is a pair $p=\\{\\alpha,u\\}$ of function $\\alpha$ and\nvector field $u$ given on a 3d Riemannian maifold $\\Omega$ with the boundary.\nThe field is said to be harmonic if $\\nabla \\alpha={\\rm rot\\,}u$\\, in $\\Omega$.\nThe linear space of harmonic fields is not an algebra w.r.t. quaternion\nmultiplication.

Possible application of these algebras to the impedance\ntomography problem is touched on.\n", "  The connection between Poincar\\'e spheres for polariz-ation and Gaussian\nbeams is explored, focusing on the interpretation of elliptic polarization in\nterms of the isotropic 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator in Hamiltonian\nmechanics, its canonical quantization and semiclassical interpretation. This\nleads to the interpretation of structured Gaussian modes, the Hermite-Gaussian,\nLaguerre-Gaussian and Generalized Hermite-Laguerre Gaussian modes as\neigenfunctions of operators corresponding to the classical constants of motion\nof the 2-dimensional oscillator, which acquire an extra significance as\nfamilies of classical ellipses upon semiclassical quantization.\n", "  We present a structural study of 182 obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)\nat z<=1.5, selected in the COSMOS field from their extreme infrared to X-ray\nluminosity ratio and their negligible emission at optical wavelengths. We fit\noptical to far-infrared spectral energy distributions and analyze deep HST\nimaging to derive the physical and morphological properties of their host\ngalaxies. We find that such galaxies are more compact than normal star-forming\nsources at similar redshift and stellar mass, and we show that it is not an\nobservational bias related to the emission of the AGN. Based on the\ndistribution of their UVJ colors, we also argue that this increased compactness\nis not due to the additional contribution of a passive bulge. We thus postulate\nthat a vast majority of obscured AGNs reside in galaxies undergoing dynamical\ncompaction, similar to processes recently invoked to explain the formation of\ncompact star-forming sources at high redshift.\n", "  In complex systems, it is often the case that the region of interest forms\nonly one part of a much larger system. The idea of joining two different\nquantum simulations - a high level calculation on the active region of\ninterest, and a low level calculation on its environment - formally defines a\nquantum embedding. While any combination of techniques constitutes an\nembedding, several rigorous formalisms have emerged that provide for exact\nfeedback between the embedded system and its environment. These three\nformulations: it density functional embedding, Green's function embedding, and\ndensity matrix embedding, respectively use the single-particle density,\nsingle-particle Green's function, and single-particle density matrix as the\nquantum variables of interest. Many excellent reviews exist covering these\nmethods individually. However, a unified presentation of the different\nformalisms is so far lacking. Indeed, the various languages commonly used:\nfunctional equations for density functional embedding; diagrammatics for\nGreen's function embedding; and entanglement arguments for density matrix\nembedding, make the three formulations appear vastly different. In this\naccount, we introduce the basic equations of all three formulations in such a\nway as to highlight their many common intellectual strands. While we focus\nprimarily on a straightforward theoretical perspective, we also give a brief\noverview of recent applications, and possible future developments.\n", "  Experimental study of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) spectra of\nzirconium was carried out using Yanson's point-contact (PC) spectroscopy.

No\ncontribution by copper, silver or gold to the heterocontact spectra was\ndetected. The positions of five phonon features of the EPI function were\nobserved at energies 5-6, 9-11, 13-15, 18-20, and 27-29 $meV$.

The solution of reverse task of magnetic force\nmicroscopy is obtained for surface points of samples. Superposition of fields,\nwhich are generated by a system of magnetic moments in the selected point in\nspace, causes a linear dependence of the force gradient of the dipole-dipole\ninteraction between the components of the vectors.\n", "  Plasmons in graphene nanostructures show great promise for mid-infrared\napplications ranging from a few to tens of microns. However, mid-infrared\nplasmonic resonances in graphene nanostructures are usually weak and\nnarrow-banded, limiting their potential in light manipulation and detection.\nHere we investigate the coupling among graphene plasmonic nanostructures and\nfurther show that by engineering the coupling, enhancement of light-graphene\ninteraction strength and broadening of spectral width can be achieved\nsimultaneously. Leveraging the concept of coupling, we demonstrate a hybrid\n2-layer graphene nanoribbon array which shows 5 to 7% extinction within the\nentire 8 to 14 {\\mu}m (~700 to 1250 cm-1) wavelength range, covering one of the\nimportant atmosphere \"infrared transmission windows\". Such coupled hybrid\ngraphene plasmonic nanostructures may find applications in infrared sensing and\nfree-space communications.\n", "  We initiate a systematic investigation of F-theory on elliptic fibrations\nwith singularities which cannot be resolved without breaking the Calabi-Yau\ncondition, corresponding to $\\mathbb Q$-factorial terminal singularities. It is\nthe purpose of this paper to elucidate the physical origin of such non-crepant\nsingularities in codimension two and to systematically analyse F-theory\ncompactifications containing such singularities. The singularities reflect the\npresence of localised matter states from wrapped M2-branes which are not\ncharged under any massless gauge potential. We identify a class of $\\mathbb\nQ$-factorial terminal singularities on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds for which we can compute the number of uncharged localised\nhypermultiplets in terms of their associated Milnor numbers. These count the\nlocal complex deformations of the singularities. The resulting six-dimensional\nspectra are shown to be anomaly-free. We exemplify this in a variety of cases,\nincluding models with non-perturbative gauge groups with both charged and\nuncharged localised matter. The underlying mathematics will be discussed\nfurther in a forthcoming publication.\n", "  In the framework of the Hamiltonian of mean force, internal energy, free\nenergy and entropy of a dissipative scalar field are obtained.\n", "  We study the curvature of the chiral transition/crossover line between the\nlow-temperature hadronic phase and the high-temperature quark-gluon-plasma\nphase at low densities, performing simulations of two-flavor QCD with improved\nWilson quarks. After confirming that the chiral order parameter defined by a\nWard-Takahashi identity is consistent with the scaling of the O(4) universality\nclass at zero chemical potential, we extend the scaling analysis to finite\nchemical potential to determine the curvature of the chiral\ntransition/crossover line at low densities assuming the O(4) universality. To\nconvert the curvature in lattice units to that of the $T_c(\\mu_B)$ in physical\nunits, we evaluate the lattice scale applying a gradient flow method. We find\n$\\kappa=0.0006(1)$ in the chiral limit, which is much smaller than that\nobtained in (2+1)-flavor QCD with improved staggered quarks.\n", "  The phenomenon of molecular optical activity manifests itself as the rotation\nof the plane of linear polarization when light passes through chiral media.\nMeasurements of optical activity and its wavelength dependence, optical\nrotatory dispersion, can reveal information about intricate properties of\nmolecules, such as the 3D arrangement of atoms comprising a molecule. Given a\nlimited probe power, quantum metrology offers the possibility to outperform\nclassical measurements. This holds particular appeal when samples may be\ndamaged by high powers, a potential concern for chiroptical studies. Here we\nshow the first experiment in which multi-wavelength polarization-entangled\nphoton pairs are used to measure the optical activity and optical rotatory\ndispersion exhibited by a solution of chiral molecules. Our work paves the way\nfor quantum-enhanced measurements of chirality, with potential applications in\nchemistry, biology, materials science, and the pharmaceutical industry. The\nscheme we employ for probing the wavelength dependence allows to surpass the\ninformation extracted per photon in a classical measurement, and can also be\nused for more general differential measurements.\n", "  We report the results of an extended spectropolarimetric and photometric\nmonitoring of the weak-line T Tauri star TAP 26, carried out within the MaTYSSE\nprogramme with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the 3.6 m\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Applying Zeeman-Doppler Imaging to our\nobservations, concentrating in 2015 November and 2016 January and spanning 72 d\nin total, 16 d in 2015 November and 13 d in 2016 January, we reconstruct\nsurface brightness and magnetic field maps for both epochs and demonstrate that\nboth distributions exhibit temporal evolution not explained by differential\nrotation alone. We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26\nusing three different methods, two using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and one\nGaussian-Process Regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than\n6.10^-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window,\nthe orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with\nhighest likelihood is 10.79 +/- 0.14 d followed by 8.99 +/- 0.09 d. Assuming\nthe most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial\nplane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass M.sin(i) of 1.66 +/- 0.31\nM_Jup and orbits at 0.0968 +/- 0.0032 au from its host star. This new detection\nsuggests that disc type II migration is efficient at generating newborn hJs,\nand that hJs may be more frequent around young T Tauri stars than around mature\nstars (or that the MaTYSSE sample is biased towards hJ-hosting stars).\n", "  Since 2003 many charmonium-like states were observed experimentally.\nEspecially those charged charmonium-like $Z_c$ states and bottomonium-like\n$Z_b$ states cannot be accommodated within the naive quark model, which are\ngood candidates of either the hidden-charm tetraquark states or molecules\ncomposed of a pair of charmed mesons. In 2015, the LHCb Collaboration\ndiscovered two hidden-charm pentaquark states, which are also beyond the quark\nmodel. In this talk, we review the current experimental progress and\ninvestigate various theoretical interpretations of these candidates of the\nmultiquark states. We list the puzzles and theoretical challenges of these\nmodels when confronted with the experimental data. We also discuss possible\nfuture measurements which may distinguish the theoretical schemes on the\nunderlying structures of the hidden-charm multiquark states.\n", "  The demographics of dwarf galaxy populations have long been in tension with\npredictions from the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm. If primordial density\nfluctuations were scale-free as predicted, dwarf galaxies should themselves\nhost dark matter subhaloes, the most massive of which may have undergone star\nformation resulting in dwarf galaxy groups. Ensembles of dwarf galaxies are\nobserved as satellites of more massive galaxies, and there is observational and\ntheoretical evidence to suggest that these satellites at z=0 were captured by\nthe massive host halo as a group. However, the evolution of dwarf galaxies is\nhighly susceptible to environment making these satellite groups imperfect\nprobes of CDM in the low mass regime. We have identified one of the clearest\nexamples to date of hierarchical structure formation at low masses: seven\nisolated, spectroscopically confirmed groups with only dwarf galaxies as\nmembers. Each group hosts 3-5 known members, has a baryonic mass of ~4.4 x 10^9\nto 2 x 10^10 Msun, and requires a mass-to-light ratio of <100 to be\ngravitationally bound. Such groups are predicted to be rare theoretically and\nfound to be rare observationally at the current epoch and thus provide a unique\nwindow into the possible formation mechanism of more massive, isolated\ngalaxies.\n", "  Hot Jupiters (HJs) are Jupiter-like planets orbiting their host star in tight\norbits of a few days. They are commonly believed not to have formed in situ,\nrequiring inwards migration towards the host star. One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this\npossibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in\ntwo hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ\nformation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at\nmost a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the\nsimulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly\nto studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters. HJs\nare only formed in our simulations for triples with specific orbital\nconfigurations, and our constraints are approximately consistent with current\nobservations. In future, this allows to rule out high-$e$ migration in stellar\ntriples if a HJ is detected in a triple grossly violating these constraints.\n", "  The underpotential deposition of transition metal ions is a critical step in\nmany electrosynthetic approaches. While underpotential deposition has been\nintensively studied at the atomic level, first-principles calculations in\nvacuum can strongly underestimate the stability of underpotentially deposited\nmetals. It has been shown recently that the consideration of co-adsorbed anions\ncan deliver more reliable descriptions of underpotential deposition reactions;\nhowever, the influence of additional key environmental factors such as the\nelectrification of the interface under applied voltage and the activities of\nthe ions in solution have yet to be investigated. In this work, copper\nunderpotential deposition on gold is studied under realistic electrochemical\nconditions using a quantum-continuum model of the electrochemical interface. We\nreport here on the influence of surface electrification, concentration effects,\nand anion co-adsorption on the stability of the copper underpotential\ndeposition layer on the gold (100) surface.\n", "  We investigate the susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on configuration\nmodel networks. In an effort for the unification of current approaches, we\nconsider a network whose edges are constantly being rearranged, with a tunable\nrewiring rate $\\omega$. We perform a detailed stationary state analysis of the\nprocess, leading to a closed form expression of the absorbing-state threshold\nfor an arbitrary rewiring rate. In both extreme regimes (annealed and\nquasi-static), we recover and further improve the results of current\napproaches, as well as providing a natural interpolation for the intermediate\nregimes. For any finite $\\omega$, our analysis predicts a vanishing threshold\nwhen the maximal degree $k_\\mathrm{max} \\to \\infty$, a generalization of the\nresult obtained with quenched mean-field theory for static networks.\n", "  We report on changes in the Raman spectrum of live Escherichi coli (E.coli)\nthat result from exposure to lethal fluences of 300 nm (UV-B) and 405 nm\n(violet) photons. In the first instance, the energy per photon of 4.13 eV is\nsufficient to break most of the inter-atomic bonds in the bacterium and major\nchange in the Raman spectrum, particularly in the RNA/DNA regions is observed.\nThis energy is in near resonance with the C-H, N-H, and P-O bond binding\nenergies that interconnect phosphate backbone sections and may initiate the\nRaman modifications. By contrast, the 3.06 eV violet photon energy is\ninsufficient to cleave the stronger system bonds. The much larger lethal\nfluence required in this case produces a significant change in the resonant C-N\nand C-P bond connected amino acid/protein groups and lipid peak signal but much\nless so in the nucleotide-DNA/RNA signature.\n", "  We report searches for a new muonic dark force mediated by a gauge boson\n($Z'$) coupling only to the second and third lepton families. The existence of\nthe $Z'$ boson is probed in $e^+e^- \\to \\mu^+\\mu^- Z'$, $Z' \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$\nevents, with an analysis based on the full data sample collected with the BABAR\ndetector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ collider. No significant signal is observed.\nLimits on dark-sector coupling constants are derived; these improve upon\ncurrent bounds, and further constrain the allowed parameter space.\n", "  The spectral series of the Schr\\\"odinger operator with a delta-potential on a\nthree-dimensional compact spherically symmetric manifold in the semiclassical\nlimit as $h\\to0$ are described.\n", "  The development of large-scale platforms for quantum information requires new\nmethods for verification and validation of quantum behavior. Quantum tomography\n(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout\ndevices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is\nexpensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy\nclassical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new\nmethods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and\nerrors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information\nexperiments.\n  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods\npossible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information\nis prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which\nrequire pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,\nmost experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that\nwhen this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer\nresources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.\nMoreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the\nprocess is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such\ncompelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on\nquantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature\nof quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.\n  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new\nmethods in an experimental setting. The physical system is an ensemble of\nlaser-cooled cesium atoms in the laboratory of Prof. Poul Jessen. Experiments\nwere conducted by Hector Sosa-Martinez et al. to demonstrate different QT\nprotocols. We compare the results, and conclude that the new methods are\neffective.\n", "  The development of quantum computers and quantum simulators promises to\nprovide solutions to problems, which can currently not be solved on classical\ncomputers. Finding the best physical implementation for such technologies is an\nimportant research topic and using optical effects is a promising route towards\nthis goal. It was theoretically shown that optical quantum computing is\npossible using only single-photon sources and detectors, and linear optical\ncircuits. An experimental implementation of such quantum optical circuits\nrequires a stable, robust and scalable architecture. This can be achieved via\nminiaturization of the optical devices in the form of photonic integrated\ncircuits (PICs). The development of a suitable material platform for such PICs\ncould therefore have a large impact on future technologies. Diamond is a\nparticularly attractive material here, as it naturally offers a range of\noptically active defects, which can act as single-photon sources, quantum\nmemories, or sensor elements. Besides its excellent optical properties, diamond\nalso has a very high Young's modulus, which is important for optomechanics, and\ncan be employed for potentially fast and low-loss tuning of PICs after\nfabrication. In this work, components for future quantum optical circuits are\ndeveloped. This includes the first diamond optomechanical elements, as well as\nthe first integrated single-photon detectors on a diamond material platform.\nDiamond micromechanical resonators with high quality factors are realized and\ntheir actuation via optical gradient forces and electrostatic forces is\ndemonstrated. The accomplished superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors\nshow excellent performance in terms of low timing jitter, high detection\nefficiency, and low noise-equivalent power. Moreover, a novel scalable method\nfor PIC fabrication from high quality single crystal diamond is presented.\n", "  Measurements of Ra-226 activity from eight HPGe gamma ray detectors at the NC\nState University PULSTAR Reactor were analyzed for evidence of periodic\nvariations, with particular attention to annual variations. All measurements\nwere made using the same reference source, and data sets were of varying length\ntaken over the time period from September 1996 through August 2014. Clear\nevidence of annual variations was observed in data from four of the detectors.\nShort time periodograms from the data sets suggest temporal variability of both\nthe amplitude and frequency of these variations. The annual variations in two\nof the data sets show peak values near the first of February, while\nsurprisingly, the annual variations in the other two are roughly out of phase\nwith the first two. Three of the four detectors exhibited annual variations\nover approximately the same time period. A joint statistic constructed by\ncombining spectra from these three shows peaks approximating the frequencies of\nsolar r-mode oscillations with $\\nu_R = 11.74$ cpy, $m=1$, and $l=3,5,6.$ The\nfact that similar variations were not present in all detectors covering similar\ntime periods rules out variations in activity as the cause, and points to\ndiffering sensitivities to unspecified environmental parameters instead. In\naddition to seasonal variations, the modulation of environmental parameters by\nsolar processes remains a possible explanation of periodogram features, but\nwithout requiring new physics.\n", "  We analyzed micrometer-scale titanium-niobium-oxide prototype memristors,\nwhich exhibited low write-power (<3 {\\mu}W) and energy (<200 fJ/bit/{\\mu}m2),\nlow read-power (~nW), and high endurance (>millions of cycles). To understand\ntheir physico-chemical operating mechanisms, we performed in-operando\nsynchrotron x-ray transmission nanoscale spectromicroscopy using an\nultra-sensitive time-multiplexed technique. We observed only spatially uniform\nmaterial changes during cell operation, in sharp contrast to the frequently\ndetected formation of a localized conduction channel in transition-metal-oxide\nmemristors. We also associated the response of assigned spectral features\ndistinctly to non-volatile storage (resistance change) and writing of\ninformation (application of voltage and Joule heating). These results provide\ncritical insights into high-performance memristors that will aid in device\ndesign, scaling and predictive circuit-modeling, all of which are essential for\nthe widespread deployment of successful memristor applications.\n", "  In the article, we will report on the recovery of a Melloni's optical bench\nbuilt at the end of 1800 by the \"macchinista\" Filippo Caliri in the \"belle\n\\'epoque\" of Palermo. A scientific instrument of particular historical and\ndidactic interest belonging to the collection of Liceo Classico Statale\n\"Umberto I\" of Palermo. In the article, we will discuss the technical aspects\nof the interventions carried out.\n  In questo articolo discuteremo del recupero di uno strumento scientifico di\nparticolare interesse storico-didattico appartenente alla Collezione del Liceo\nClassico Statale \"Umberto I\" di Palermo: un raro banco ottico del Melloni\ncostruito alla fine del 1800 nella Palermo della \"belle \\'epoque\" dal\n\"macchinista\" Filippo Caliri. Nell'articolo discuteremo gli aspetti tecnici\ndegli interventi conservativi effettuati.\n", "  It is investigated the formation of the phase composition and structure in\nthe nanoscaled CoSbx (30 nm) films deposited by the method of molecular-beam\nepitaxy on the substrates of the oxidated monocrystalline silicon at 200 C and\nfollowing thermal treatment in vacuum in temperature range of 300-700 C. It is\nestablished that the films after the deposition are polycrystalline without\ntexture. With increase in Sb content the formation of the phase composition in\nthe films takes place in such sequence as this is provided by phase diagram for\nthe bulky state of the Co-Sb system. At annealing in vacuum at temperature\nabove 450-500 C a sublimation not only of the crystalline Sb phase but from the\nantimonides occurs.\n", "  Mean king's problem is a kind of quantum state discrimination problems. In\nthe problem, we try to discriminate eigenstates of noncommutative observables\nwith the help of classical delayed information. The problem has been\ninvestigated from the viewpoint of error detection and correction. We construct\nhigher-dimensional quantum error-correcting codes against error corresponding\nto the noncommutative observables. Any code state of the codes provides a way\nto discriminate the eigenstates correctly with the classical delayed\ninformation.\n", "  The random equivalent sampling (RES) is a well-known sampling technique that\ncan be used to capture a high-speed repetitive waveform with low sampling rate.\nIn this paper, the feasibility of spectrum-blind multiband signal\nreconstruction for data sampled from RES is investigated. We propose a RES\nsampling pattern and its corresponding mathematical model that guarantees\nwell-conditioned reconstruction of multiband signal with unknown spectral\nsupport. We give the minimum number of RES acquisitions that hold overwhelming\nprobability to successfully reconstruct original signal. We demonstrate that\nfor signal with specific spectral occupation, the number of RES acquisitions\nand the minimum sampling rate could be approached. The signal reconstruction is\nstudied in the framework of compressive sampling (CS) theory. The\neigen-decomposition and minimum description length (MDL) criteria are adopted\nto adaptively estimate the dimension of signal, and the number of unknowns of\nreconstruction problem is reduced. Experimental results are reported to\nindicate that, for a spectrum-blind sparse multiband signal, the proposed\nreconstruction algorithm for RES is feasible and robust.\n", "  Magnetic heterostructures that combine large spin-orbit torque efficiency,\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low resistivity are key to develop\nelectrically-controlled memory and logic devices. Here we report on vector\nmeasurements of the current-induced spin orbit torques and magnetization\nswitching in perpendicularly magnetized Pd/Co/AlO$_x$ layers as a function of\nPd thickness. We find sizeable damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques,\nof the order of 1~mT per $10^7$~A/cm$^2$, which have different thickness and\nmagnetization angle dependence. The analysis of the DL torque efficiency per\nunit current density and electric field using drift-diffusion theory leads to\nan effective spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length of Pd larger than 0.03\nand 7~nm, respectively. The FL SOT includes a significant interface\ncontribution, is larger than estimated using drift-diffusion parameters, and is\nfurther strongly enhanced upon rotation of the magnetization from the\nout-of-plane to the in-plane direction. Finally, taking advantage of the large\nspin-orbit torques in this system, we demonstrate bipolar magnetization\nswitching of Pd/Co/AlO$_x$ layers with similar current density as used for\nPt/Co layers with comparable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.\n", "  Reliable generation and measurement of triphoton states has yet to be\nachieved in laboratory. We give an overview of the problems in generating and\nmeasuring triphoton quantum states and analyze several protocols of quantum\nmeasurements, which allow for high precision of reconstruction when sizes of\navailable statistical data samples are limited. The tomography procedure under\ninvestigation is based on root approach to state estimation. In particular, we\nuse the generalized Fisher information matrix to assess the accuracy of the\nquantum state parameters measurement. We use tomographic protocols, based on\nthe symmetry of the Platonic solids. We demonstrate the capability to\nreconstruct triphoton quantum states with precision close to the maximum\nachievable value allowed by quantum mechanics\n", "  A very promising recent trend in applied quantum physics is to combine the\nadvantageous features of different quantum systems into what is called \"hybrid\nquantum technology\". One of the key elements in this new field will have to be\na quantum memory enabling to store quanta over extended periods of time.\nSystems that may fulfill the demands of such applications are comb-shaped spin\nensembles coupled to a cavity. Due to the decoherence induced by the\ninhomogeneous ensemble broadening, the storage time of these quantum memories\nis, however, still rather limited. Here we demonstrate how to overcome this\nproblem by burning well-placed holes into the spectral spin density leading to\nspectacular performance in the multimode regime. Specifically, we show how an\ninitial excitation of the ensemble leads to the emission of more than a hundred\nwell-separated photon pulses with a decay rate significantly below the\nfundamental limit of the recently proposed \"cavity protection effect\".\n", "  We consider realistic measurement systems, where measurements are accompanied\nby decoherence processes. The aim of this work is the construction of methods\nand algorithms for precise quantum measurements with fidelity close to the\nfundamental limit. In the present work the notions of ideal and non-ideal\nquantum measurements are strictly formalized. It is shown that non-ideal\nquantum measurements could be represented as a mixture of ideal measurements.\nBased on root approach the quantum state reconstruction method is developed.\nInformational accuracy theory of non-ideal quantum measurements is proposed.\nThe monitoring of the amount of information about the quantum state parameters\nis examined, including the analysis of the information degradation under the\nnoise influence. The study of achievable fidelity in non-ideal quantum\nmeasurements is performed. The results of simulation of fidelity\ncharacteristics of a wide class of quantum protocols based on polyhedrons\ngeometry with high level of symmetry are presented. The impact of different\ndecoherence mechanisms, including qubit amplitude and phase relaxation,\nbit-flip and phase-flip, is considered.\n", "  High precison calibration is essential for a new generation of radio\ninterferometers looking for Epoch of Reionization and Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation signatures in neutral hydrogen. These arrays have so far been\ncalibrated by redundant calibration, which usually assumes baselines intended\nto be identical are perfectly so. We present a new calibration scheme that\nrelaxes the assumption of explicit redundancy by calculating the expected\ncovariance of baselines. The technique also allows one to take advantage of\npartial knowledge of the sky, such as point sources with known positions but\nunknown fluxes. We describe a 2-level sparse matrix inverse to make the\ncalibration tractable for 1,000-element class interferometers. We provide a\nreference implementation and use it to test the calibration of simulations of\nan array with imperfectly located antennas observing Euclidean-distributed\npoint sources. Including position information for a handful of the brightest\nsources, we find the amplitude/phase reconstruction improves by a factor of\n$\\sim$2/5 over redundant calibration for the noise levels/position errors\nadopted in the simulations. Inclusion of source positions also allows us to\nmeasure the overall phase gradient across the array, information which is lost\nin traditional redundant calibration.\n", "  Analysis of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in the region of\nthe supernova remnant G78.2+2.1 reveals an excess at the position of the TeV\nsource VER J2019+407. The GeV source is extended with a hard spectrum and it is\nlikely the counterpart of the TeV source. The spectrum of the LAT emission\nconnects smoothly with that of VER J2019+407, and the overall GeV--TeV spectrum\nis best described by a broken power-law with indices 1.8 and 2.5 below and\nabove a break energy of 71 GeV. Several scenarios are considered to explain the\nnature of this unidentified gamma ray source.\n", "  In this note, we model the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a four dimensional\nextremal black hole in terms of classifying particles moving in its near\nhorizon AdS_2 geometry. We use the framework of SLE curves in AdS_2 to classify\nthese particle trajectories in terms of their boundary conditions. These turn\nout to be related to singular vectors in two-dimensional conformal quantum\ngravity theory in AdS_2 and the dynamics of these particles are governed by the\nHamiltonians of the integrable Calogero-like models, for these boundary\nconditions. We use this classification to count the leading order\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole and arrive at a first principle\nmicroscopic computation of black hole degeneracy.\n", "  We present a computer simulation of entangled polymer solutions at\nequilibrium. The chains repel each other via a soft Gaussian potential,\nappropriate for semi-dilute solutions at the scale of a correlation blob. The\nkey innovation to suppress chain crossings is to use a pseudo-continuous model\nof a backbone which effectively leaves no gaps between consecutive points on\nthe chain, unlike the usual bead-and-spring model. Our algorithm is\nsufficiently fast to observe the entangled regime using a standard desktop\ncomputer. The simulated structural and mechanical correlations are in fair\nagreement with the expected predictions for a semi-dilute solution of entangled\nchains.\n", "  Investigations of solute transport in fractured rock aquifers often rely on\ntracer test data acquired at a limited number of observation points. Such data\ndo not, by themselves, allow detailed assessments of the spreading of the\ninjected tracer plume. To better understand the transport behavior in a\ngranitic aquifer, we combine tracer test data with single-hole\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) reflection monitoring data. Five successful\ntracer tests were performed under various experimental conditions between two\nboreholes 6 m apart. For each experiment, saline tracer was injected into a\npreviously identified packed-off transmissive fracture while repeatedly\nacquiring single-hole GPR reflection profiles together with electrical\nconductivity logs in the pumping borehole. By analyzing depth-migrated GPR\ndifference images together with tracer breakthrough curves and associated\nsimplified flow and transport modeling, we estimate (1) the number, the\nconnectivity, and the geometry of fractures that contribute to tracer\ntransport, (2) the velocity and the mass of tracer that was carried along each\nflow path, and (3) the effective transport parameters of the identified flow\npaths. We find a qualitative agreement when comparing the time evolution of GPR\nreflectivity strengths at strategic locations in the formation with those\narising from simulated transport. The discrepancies are on the same order as\nthose between observed and simulated breakthrough curves at the outflow\nlocations. The rather subtle and repeatable GPR signals provide useful and\ncomplementary information to tracer test data acquired at the outflow locations\nand may help us to characterize transport phenomena in fractured rock aquifers.\n", "  The geometry and connectivity of fractures exert a strong influence on the\nflow and transport properties of fracture networks. We present a novel approach\nto stochastically generate three-dimensional discrete networks of connected\nfractures that are conditioned to hydrological and geophysical data. A\nhierarchical rejection sampling algorithm is used to draw realizations from the\nposterior probability density function at different conditioning levels. The\nmethod is applied to a well-studied granitic formation using data acquired\nwithin two boreholes located 6 m apart. The prior models include 27 fractures\nwith their geometry (position and orientation) bounded by information derived\nfrom single-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired during saline\ntracer tests and optical televiewer logs. Eleven cross-hole hydraulic\nconnections between fractures in neighboring boreholes and the order in which\nthe tracer arrives at different fractures are used for conditioning.\nFurthermore, the networks are conditioned to the observed relative hydraulic\nimportance of the different hydraulic connections by numerically simulating the\nflow response. Among the conditioning data considered, constraints on the\nrelative flow contributions were the most effective in determining the\nvariability among the network realizations. Nevertheless, we find that the\nposterior model space is strongly determined by the imposed prior bounds.\nStrong prior bounds were derived from GPR measurements and helped to make the\napproach computationally feasible. We analyze a set of 230 posterior\nrealizations that reproduce all data given their uncertainties assuming the\nsame uniform transmissivity in all fractures. The posterior models provide\nvaluable statistics on length scales and density of connected fractures, as\nwell as their connectivity.\n", "  The new method of multivariate data analysis based on the complements of\nclassical probability distribution to quantum state and Schmidt decomposition\nis presented. We considered Schmidt formalism application to problems of\nstatistical correlation analysis. Correlation of photons in the beam splitter\noutput channels, when input photons statistics is given by compound Poisson\ndistribution is examined. The developed formalism allows us to analyze\nmultidimensional systems and we have obtained analytical formulas for Schmidt\ndecomposition of multivariate Gaussian states. It is shown that mathematical\ntools of quantum mechanics can significantly improve the classical statistical\nanalysis. The presented formalism is the natural approach for the analysis of\nboth classical and quantum multivariate systems and can be applied in various\ntasks associated with research of dependences.\n", "  The estimation of high order correlation function values is an important\nproblem in the field of quantum computation. We show that the problem can be\nreduced to preparation and measurement of optical quantum states resulting\nafter annihilation of a set number of quanta from the original beam. We apply\nthis approach to explore various photon bunching regimes in optical states with\ngamma-compounded Poisson photon number statistics. We prepare and perform\nmeasurement of the thermal quantum state as well as states produced by\nsubtracting one to ten photons from it. Maximum likelihood estimation is\nemployed for parameter estimation. The goal of this research is the development\nof highly accurate procedures for generation and quality control of optical\nquantum states.\n", "  There are two formulas for charged lepton mass relation: One is a formula\n(formula A) which was proposed based on a U(3) family model on 1982. The\nformula A will be satisfied only masses switched off all interactions except\nfor U(3) family interactions. Other one (formula B) is an empirical formula\nwhich we have recognized after a report of the precise measurement of tau\nlepton mass, 1992. The formula B is excellently satisfied by pole masses of the\ncharged leptons. However, this excellent agreement may be an accidental\ncoincidence. Nevertheless, 2009, Sumino has paid attention to the formula B. He\nhas proposed a family gauge boson model and thereby he has tried to understand\nwhy the formula B is so well satisfied with pole masses. In this talk, the\nfollowing views are given: (i) What direction of flavor physics research is\nsuggested by the formula A; (ii) How the Sumino model is misunderstood by\npeople and what we should learn from his model; (iii) What is strategy of my\nrecent work, U(3)$\\times$U(3)$'$ model.\n", "  We examine some of the theoretical and phenomenological implications of the\nHiggs boson discovery and discuss what these imply for future Higgs studies at\nthe LHC and future colliders. In particular, one of the outstanding unanswered\nquestions is whether additional scalars beyond the observed Higgs boson are\npresent in the spectrum of fundamental particles. Any theory of a non-minimal\nHiggs sector must possess a scalar state whose properties are approximately\nthose of the Standard Model Higgs boson. This can be achieved in the so-called\nalignment limit of the extended scalar sector. Examples of scalar sectors in\nwhich an approximate alignment limit is achieved are surveyed.\n", "  Following the decision to reduce the L* from 4.4 m to 4.1 m, the BeamCal had\nto be moved closer to the interaction point. Results of a study of how this\naffects the beamstrahlung and backward scattering backgrounds show that the\ne+e- pair background depositions from beamstrahlung at the BeamCal rises by\n20%. The background from backscattered electrons and positrons in the inner\npixel layers rises almost by a factor two, so does the number of photons in the\ntracker.\n", "  We aim to reveal the chemistry of carbon-chain molecules in high-mass\nstar-forming regions from molecular level to chemical evolution, applying the\nmethods established in low-mass star-forming regions. In this proceeding, we\nsummarize the topic about the main formation pathway of HC3N. We carried out\nobservations of three 13C isotopologues of HC3N toward a hot core G28.28-0.36\nwith the 45-m radio telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. From the\nobservational results, we propose that the main formation pathway of HC3N is\nthe neutral-neutral reaction between C2H2 and CN. We also compare the results\namong the different star-forming regions, from a low-mass starless core to a\nhigh-mass star-forming core.\n", "  The mass spectra of the $\\phi\\phi$ and $J/\\psi\\phi$ states in the decay\n$B^0_s\\to J/\\psi\\phi\\phi$ recently observed by LHCb are calculated in the model\nwhich takes into account the $J^P=0^+,0^-,2^+$ intermediate resonances $R_1$,\n$R_2$ in the $\\phi\\phi$ channel and the $J^P=1^+$ ones, $X_1$, $X_2$, in the\n$J/\\psi\\phi$ channel. When obtaining the expressions for the effective\namplitudes and mass spectra, the approximate threshold kinematics of the decay\nis used essentially. The $R_1-R_2$ and $X_1-X_2$ mixings arising due to the\ncommon decay modes $\\phi\\phi$ and $J/\\psi\\phi$, respectively, are also taken\ninto account. The obtained expressions for the mass spectra are applied for\nextracting the information about masses and coupling constants of the\nresonances in the $\\phi\\phi$ and $J/\\psi\\phi$ final states.\n", "  We study superconductors with $n$-fold rotational invariance both in the\npresence and in the absence of spin-orbit interactions. More specifically, we\nclassify the non-interacting Hamiltonians by defining a series of $Z$-numbers\nfor the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) symmetry classes of the Altland-Zimbauer\nclassification of random matrices in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D in the presence of\ndiscrete rotational invariance. Our analysis emphasizes the important role\nplayed by the angular momentum of the Cooper pairs in the system: for pairings\nof nonzero angular momentum, the rotation symmetry may be represented\nprojectively, and a projective representation of rotation symmetry may have\nanomalous properties, including the anti-commutation with the time-reversal\nsymmetry. In 1D and 3D, we show how an $n$-fold axis enhances the topological\nclassification and give additional topological numbers; in 2D, we establish a\nrelation between the Chern number (in class D and CI) and the eigenvalues of\nrotation symmetry at high-symmetry points. For each nontrivial class in 3D, we\nwrite down a minimal effective theory for the surface Majorana states.\n", "  (Abridged) We consider the scientific case for a large aperture (10-12m\nclass) optical spectroscopic survey telescope with a field of view comparable\nto that of LSST. Such a facility could enable transformational progress in\nseveral areas of astrophysics, and may constitute an unmatched capability for\ndecades. Deep imaging from LSST and Euclid will provide accurate photometry for\nspectroscopic targets beyond the reach of 4m class instruments. Such a facility\nwould revolutionise our understanding of the assembly and enrichment history of\nthe Milky Way and the role of dark matter through chemo-dynamical studies of\ntens of millions of stars in the Local Group. Emission and absorption line\nspectroscopy of redshift z=2-5 galaxies can be used to directly chart the\nevolution of the cosmic web and examine its connection with activity in\ngalaxies. The facility will also have synergistic impact, e.g. in following up\nlive and transpired transients found with LSST, as well as providing targets\nand the local environmental conditions for follow-up studies with E-ELT and\nfuture space missions. Although our study is exploratory, we highlight a\nspecific telescope design with a 5 square degree field of view and an\nadditional focus that could host a next-generation panoramic IFU. We discuss\nsome technical challenges and operational models and recommend a conceptual\ndesign study aimed at completing a more rigorous science case in the context of\na costed technical design.\n", "  The energy gap has been measured and the characteristic phonon energies\ndetermined for the superconducting compound $La_{1.8}Sr_{02}CuO_4$ from the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of point contacts with a copper\ncounterelectrode. The temperature dependence of the energy gap was determined.\npacs 73.40.Jn, 74.25.Kc, 74.45.+c, 73.40.-c, 74.20.Mn, 74.70.Ad, 74.72.-h, Dn\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have recently shown much promise as\nthin layer semiconductors in application to transistor technology. TMDCs\nprovide a unique vantage point for studying the properties of phosphorene, a\nhighly efficient and tunable super-material. Phosphorene-TMDC heterostructure\nnanodevices have remained largely unexplored due to the lack of air stability\nobserved in phosphorene under ambient conditions. This study investigates a\nnovel nanofabrication technique that effectively enhances the air stability and\npractical scalability of graphene-analogous phosphorene. A phosphorene-WS2\nheterostructure was first designed and synthesized via micromechanical\nexfoliation and dry transfer methods. A novel umbrella contact was fabricated\nusing electron beam lithography which extended the electrical anode over the\nphosphorene heterojunction region. SEM, Raman spectroscopy, gate transport, and\nphotocurrent response techniques were employed to characterize the device\nphysically and electronically. Devices fabricated with an extended anodic\ncontact remained functional for extended periods of time, suggesting that the\ncontact had prevented the phosphorene from degradation in ambient conditions.\nPreliminary results obtained via current response indicate a promising\nheterojunction with high speed transistor properties. This work suggests the\nunprecedented longevity and practical scalability of phosphorene utilizing a\nnovel contact nanofabrication technique. Potential applications of the\nnanodevice include next generation electronic devices, photodetectors, energy\nstorage devices, and photovoltaic cells.\n", "  In this paper we present a method for minimizing reversible quantum circuits\nusing the Quantum Operator Form (QOF); a new representation of quantum circuit\nand of quantum-realized reversible circuits based on the CNOT, CV and\nCV$^\\dagger$ quantum gates. The proposed form is a quantum extension to the\nwell known Reed-Muller but unlike the Reed-Muller form, the QOF allows the\nusage of different quantum gates. Therefore QOF permits minimization of quantum\ncircuits by using properties of different gates than only the multi-control\nToffoli gates. We introduce a set of minimization rules and a pseudo-algorithm\nthat can be used to design circuits with the CNOT, CV and CV$^\\dagger$ quantum\ngates. We show how the QOF can be used to minimize reversible quantum circuits\nand how the rules allow to obtain exact realizations using the above mentioned\nquantum gates.\n", "  We show that how to support propagation of spin degree in a spin-symmetric\nexciton-polariton condensates in a semiconductor microcavity. Due to the\nstimulated spin-dependent scattering between hot excitons and condensates,\nexciton polaritons form a circular polarized condensate with spontaneous\nbreaking the spin rotation symmetry. The spin antiferromagnetic state are\ndeveloped evidently from the density and spin flow pumped by localized laser\nsource. The low energy spin current is identified where the steady state is\ncharacterized by the oscillating spin pattern. We predict via simulation that\nit is very promising to dynamical creation of fractionalized half-quantum\nvortices induced by effective non-abelian gauge potential within currently\nexperiment procedure.\n", "  Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) have been grown by using molecular beam\nepitaxy on c-plane Al2O3 substrates. The MTJ stacks consist of two\nferromagnetic hcp-Co layers separated by a thin insulating h-BN barrier. The\nsamples have been grown in a single run revealing single crystalline epitaxial\nstructures with sharp interfaces as observed by applying transmission electron\nmicroscopy. The in-plane magnetization experiments have revealed separate\nmagnetization switching of a thin top Co (soft) layer and a thick bottom Co\n(hard) layer. At zero magnetic field the two Co layers are found in an\nantiparallel state.\n", "  We present a photometric study of the prototype merger remnant NGC 3610 and\nits globular cluster (GC) system, based on new GEMINI/GMOS and ACS/HST archival\nimages. Thanks to the large FOV of our GMOS data, larger than previous studies,\nwe are able to detect a `classical' bimodal GC colour distribution,\ncorresponding to metal-poor and metal-rich GCs, at intermediate radii and a\nsmall subsample of likely young clusters of intermediate colours, mainly\nlocated in the outskirts. The extent of the whole GC system is settled as about\n40 kpc. The GC population is quite poor, about 500 +/- 110 members, that\ncorresponds to a low total specific frequency S_N ~ 0.8. The effective radii of\na cluster sample are determined, including those of two spectroscopically\nconfirmed young and metal-rich clusters, that are in the limit between GC and\nUCD sizes and brightness. The large-scale galaxy surface-brightness profile can\nbe decomposed as an inner embedded disc and an outer spheroid, determining for\nboth larger extents than earlier research (10 kpc and 30 kpc, respectively). We\ndetect boxy isophotes, expected in merger remnants, and show a wealth of\nfine-structure in the surface-brightness distribution with unprecedented\ndetail, coincident with the outer spheroid. The lack of symmetry in the galaxy\ncolour map adds a new piece of evidence to the recent merger scenario of NGC\n3610.\n", "  In the context of two-party interactive quantum communication protocols, we\nstudy a recently defined notion of quantum information cost (QIC), which\npossesses most of the important properties of its classical analogue. Although\nthis definition has the advantage to be valid for fully quantum inputs and\ntasks, its interpretation for classical tasks remained rather obscure. Also,\nthe link between this new notion and other notions of information cost for\nquantum protocols that had previously appeared in the literature was not clear,\nif existent at all.\n  We settle both these issues: for quantum communication with classical inputs,\nwe provide an alternate characterization of QIC in terms of information about\nthe input registers, avoiding any reference to the notion of a purification of\nthe classical input state. We provide an exact operational interpretation of\nthis alternative characterization as the sum of the cost of transmitting\ninformation about the classical inputs and the cost of forgetting information\nabout these inputs. To obtain this characterization, we prove a general lemma,\nthe Information Flow Lemma, assessing exactly the transfer of information in\ngeneral interactive quantum processes. Furthermore, we clarify the link between\nQIC and IC of classical protocols by simulating quantumly classical protocols.\n  Finally, we apply these concepts to argue that any quantum protocol that does\nnot forget information solves Disjointness on n-bits in Omega (n)\ncommunication, completely losing the quadratic quantum speedup. This provides a\nspecific sense in which forgetting information is a necessary feature of\ninteractive quantum protocols. We also apply these concepts to prove that QIC\nat zero-error is exactly n for the Inner Product function, and n (1 - o(1)) for\na random Boolean function on n+n bits.\n", "  We analyze the relation between the emission radii of twin kilohertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) and the co-rotation radii of the 12\nneutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs) which are simultaneously\ndetected with the twin kHz QPOs and NS spins. We find that the average\nco-rotation radius of these sources is r_co about 32 km, and all the emission\npositions of twin kHz QPOs lie inside the corotation radii, indicating that the\ntwin kHz QPOs are formed in the spin-up process. It is noticed that the upper\nfrequency of twin kHz QPOs is higher than NS spin frequency by > 10%, which may\naccount for a critical velocity difference between the Keplerian motion of\naccretion matter and NS spin that is corresponding to the production of twin\nkHz QPOs. In addition, we also find that about 83% of twin kHz QPOs cluster\naround the radius range of 15-20 km, which may be affected by the hard surface\nor the local strong magnetic field of NS. As a special case, SAX J1808.4-3658\nshows the larger emission radii of twin kHz QPOs of r about 21-24 km, which may\nbe due to its low accretion rate or small measured NS mass (< 1.4 solar mass).\n", "  Red Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) Sources (RMSs) are regarded as excellent\ncandidates of massive starforming regions. In order to characterize the\nchemical properties of massive star formation, we made a systematic study of 87\nRMSs in the southern sky, using archival data taken from the Atacama Pathfinder\nExperiment Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL), the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array, and the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90\nGHz (MALT90). According to previous multiwavelength observations, our sample\ncould be divided into two groups: massive young stellar objects and H II\nregions. Combined with the MALT90 data, we calculated the column densities of\nN2H+, C2H, HC3N, and HNC and found that they are not much different from\nprevious studies made in other massive star-forming regions. However, their\nabundances are relatively low compared to infrared dark clouds (IRDCs). The\nabundances of N2H+ and HNC in our sample are at least 1 mag lower than those\nfound in IRDCs, indicating chemical depletions in the relatively hot gas.\nBesides, the fractional abundances of N2H+, C2H, and HC3N seem to decrease as a\nfunction of their Lyman continuum fluxes (NL), indicating that these molecules\ncould be destroyed by UV photons when H II regions have formed inside. We also\nfind that the C2H abundance decreases faster than HC3N with respect to NL. The\nabundance of HNC has a tight correlation with that of N2H+, indicating that it\nmay be also preferentially formed in cold gas. We regard our RMSs as being in a\nrelatively late evolutionary stage of massive star formation.\n", "  The blends and hybrid nanocomposites of polypropylene - cycloolefin copolymer\nwere prepared by a twin-screw extruder followed by microfibril formation using\na single screw extruder. The effects of shear rate and organoclay on the\nmorphology of polypropylene - cycloolefin copolymer (PP/COC - 80/20 wt. %)\nblends were studied by using a combination of rheological measurements, X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that\nalthough the viscosity ratio of PP/COC blend was unfavorable for COC droplet\ndeformation, the COC phase was converted to finely dispersed fibrils in PP\nmatrix. This could be asserted to the high elasticity of the COC droplets that\nsuppressed the droplet breakup in the favor of fibrillation process. The high\nglass transition temperature of COC (140 degree centigrade) could also assist\nrestoring the generated microfibril morphology upon cooling. The experimental\nresults also depicted that the droplet deformation and microfibril formation of\nPP/COC/organoclay nanocomposites mainly depend on the organoclay partitioning,\nwhich could be controlled predominantly by kinetic parameters. While the\nlocalization of organoclay in the PP matrix resulted in smaller COC droplets\nand fibrils with smaller diameter, the presence of organoclay inside COC\ndroplets reduced the droplet deformability, leading to fibrils with larger\ndiameter.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are important class of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) layered materials for electronic and optoelectronic\napplications, due to their ultimate body thickness, sizable and tunable\nbandgap, and decent theoretical room-temperature mobility of hundreds to\nthousands cm2/Vs. So far, however, all TMDCs show much lower mobility\nexperimentally because of the collective effects by foreign impurities, which\nhas become one of the most important limitations for their device applications.\nHere, taking MoS2 as an example, we review the key factors that bring down the\nmobility in TMDC transistors, including phonons, charged impurities, defects,\nand charge traps. We introduce a theoretical model that quantitatively captures\nthe scaling of mobility with temperature, carrier density and thickness. By\nfitting the available mobility data from literature over the past few years, we\nare able to obtain the density of impurities and traps for a wide range of\ntransistor structures. We show that interface engineering such as oxide surface\npassivation, high-k dielectrics and BN encapsulation could effectively reduce\nthe impurities, leading to improved device performances. For few-layer TMDCs,\nwe analytically model the lopsided carrier distribution to elucidate the\nexperimental increase of mobility with the number of layers. From our analysis,\nit is clear that the charge transport in TMDC samples is a very complex problem\nthat must be handled carefully. We hope that this Review can provide new\ninsights and serve as a starting point for further improving the performance of\nTMDC transistors.\n", "  In this paper for the first time we report the results of molecular dynamics\nsimulation of electrode/electrolyte interface of Li-O2 cathode under potential\nclose to experimental values in 1M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution of LiPF6\nsalt. Electric potential profiles, solvent structuring near the electrode\nsurface and salt ions distributions are presented and discussed here as well as\npotentials of mean force (PMF) of oxygen and its reduction products. The latter\nwould be of a great use for the future theoretical studies of reaction kinetics\nas PMF being essentially the work term is a required input for the reaction\nrate constant estimations. Electrode/electrolyte interface under the realistic\npotential effectively push oxygen anions out of the reaction layer that makes\nsecond reduction of superoxide anion hardly probable. Thus the main cause of\nthe passivation should be the lithium superoxide presence near the electrode\nsurface. The way to suppress the passivation is the shifting of equilibrium\nO_2^- + Li_+ <-> LiO_2 to the side of separately solvated ions, for example by\nusing solvents resulting in lower free energy of the ions. This conclusion is\nin agreement with the hypothesis stating that high donor number solvents lead\nto dominantly solution Li2O2 growth and significantly higher cell discharge\ncapacities.\n", "  During hundred years of General Relativity (GR), many significant\ngravitational phenomena have been predicted and discovered. General Relativity\nis still the best theory of gravity. Nevertheless, some (quantum) theoretical\nand (astrophysical and cosmological) phenomenological difficulties of modern\ngravity have been motivation to search more general theory of gravity than GR.\nAs a result, many modifications of GR have been considered. One of promising\nrecent investigations is Nonlocal Modified Gravity. In this article we present\na brief review of some nonlocal gravity models with their cosmological\nsolutions, in which nonlocality is expressed by an analytic function of the\nd'Alembert-Beltrami operator $\\Box$. Some new results are also presented.\n", "  A, recently presented, general procedure to find static and axially\nsymmetric, interior solutions to the Einstein equations, is extended to the\nstationary case, and applied to find an interior solution for the Kerr metric.\nThe solution, which is generated by an anisotropic fluid, verifies the energy\nconditions for a wide range of values of the parameters, and matches smoothly\nto the Kerr solution, thereby representing a globally regular model describing\na non spherical and rotating source of gravitational field. In the spherically\nsymmetric limit, our model converges to the well known incompressible perfect\nfluid solution.The key stone of our approach is based on an ansatz allowing to\ndefine the interior metric in terms of the exterior metric functions evaluated\nat the boundary source. The physical variables of the energy-momentum tensor\nare calculated explicitly, as well as the geometry of the source in terms of\nthe relativistic multipole moments.\n", "  Satellite formation is a natural by-product of planet formation. With the\ndiscovery of nu- merous extrasolar planets, it is likely that moons of\nextrasolar planets (exomoons) will soon be discovered. Some of the most\npromising techniques can yield both the mass and radius of the moon. Here, I\nreview recent ideas about the formation of moons in our Solar System, and\ndiscuss the prospects of extrapolating these theories to predict the sizes of\nmoons that may be discovered around extrasolar planets. It seems likely that\nplanet-planet collisions could create satellites around rocky or icy planets\nwhich are large enough to be detected by currently available techniques.\nDetectable exomoons around gas giants may be able to form by co-accretion or\ncapture, but determining the upper limit on likely moon masses at gas giant\nplanets requires more detailed, modern simulations of these processes.\n", "  We present a review of the problem of finding out whether a quantum state of\ntwo or more parties is entangled or separable. After a formal definition of\nentangled states, we present a few criteria for identifying entangled states\nand introduce some entanglement measures. We also provide a classification of\nentangled states with respect to their usefulness in quantum dense coding, and\npresent some aspects of multipartite entanglement.\n", "  Predicting the dynamics of a thermonuclear plasma during a magnetic\nconfinement experiment is fundamental in order to make nuclear fusion a\nreliable source of energy. The development of a set of equations describing the\nplasma evolution on a given time scale is the main requirement to reach this\ngoal. A limited amount of works have studied in a self-consistent way\ncollisional transport and fluctuation induced transport. The motivation of this\nwork stems from the fundamental importance of the self-consistency of the\nadopted description in order to understand transport processes on the energy\nconfinement (transport) time scale because of the mutual interaction between\ncollisions and turbulence. In turn, this is crucial in order to predict fluxes\nof particle and energy and, ultimately, the overall plasma evolution. Using\nflux coordinates and the drift ordering we derive a set of evolutions equations\nfor the number of particles and the energy density on the transport time scale.\nThese equations show the interplay between collisions and fluctuations and, in\nparticular, show that fluctuations may enhance collisional transport while the\ncollisions can damp long lived structures formed by saturated instabilities,\ni.e zonal structures. Fluctuation induced fluxes are described using\ngyrokinetic field theory, which makes a comparison with the theory of phase\nspace zonal structures possible, revealing that the fluctuations induced part\nof the transport equations can be obtained by taking the proper moment of the\nlong length scale limit of the equation governing the evolution of phase space\nzonal structures. Finally, we show that plasma nonlinear evolution can yield to\nstructures formation that are characterized by mesoscales, intermediate between\nthe typical ones of plasma turbulence and those of the reference plasma\nequilibrium.\n", "  In this thesis, various extensions of the scalar sector have been considered\ncomprising of different ${SU(2)_L}$ multiplets. If the extended scalar sector\nparticipates in the electroweak symmetry breaking then these extra scalars need\nto couple with the known standard model particles. In this work, it has been\nshown that the vector boson scattering involving scalar boson exchanges provide\na complimentary way to direct search methods to probe into the scalar sector.\nAs different extended scalar sectors have similar types of scalar fields, e.g.,\nan extra $CP$-even Higgs, charged Higgs etc., these new physics models can give\nrise to the similar types of experimental signatures. It is possible to\ndistinguish between such models at various vector boson scattering processes by\nlooking at the resonances. Also, the shapes of the resonances can provide\nfurther insight to the relevant parameter space of these models.\n  As in the SM, the electroweak vacuum is metastable, it is important to\nexplore if an extended scalar has an answer in its reserve. As the scalar\nweakly interacting massive scalar particles protected by $Z_2$ symmetry can\nserve as viable dark matter candidates, it is interesting to explore if they\nhelp prolong the lifetime of the Universe. The effective Higgs potential gets\nmodified in the presence of these new extra scalars, improving the stability of\nelectroweak vacuum. Such an exercise has been undertaken in various kinds of\nextended scalar sectors. In order to show the explicit dependence of the\nelectroweak stability on different parameters of these extended sectors,\nvarious kinds of phase diagrams have been presented. Graphical demonstrations\nhave been provided to illustrate how the confidence level, at which stability\nof electroweak vacuum is excluded, depends on such new physics parameters.\n", "  We investigate by thorough Molecular Dynamics simulations the thermodynamic\nscaling (TS) of a polymer melt. Two distinct models, with strong and weak\nvirial-energy correlations, are considered. Both evidence the joint TS with the\nsame characteristic exponent $\\gamma_{ts}$ of the fast mobility - the mean\nsquare amplitude of the picosecond rattling motion inside the cage -, and the\nmuch slower structural relaxation and chain reorientation. If the cage effect\nis appreciable, the TS master curves of the fast mobility are nearly linear,\ngrouping in a bundle of approximately concurrent lines for different\nfragilities. An expression of the TS master curve of the structural relaxation\nwith one adjustable parameter less than the available three-parameters\nalternatives is derived. The novel expression fits well with the experimental\nTS master curves of thirty-four glassformers and, in particular, their slope at\nthe glass transition, i.e. the isochoric fragility. For the glassformer OTP the\nisochoric fragility allows to satisfactorily predict the TS master curve of the\nfast mobility with no adjustments.\n", "  We present a precise measurement of the combined electron plus positron flux\nfrom 0.5 GeV to 1 TeV, based on the analysis of the data collected by the Alpha\nMagnetic Spectrometer during the first 30 months of operations aboard the\nInternational Space Station. The statistics and the high resolution of AMS-02\ndetector provide a precise measurement of the flux. The flux is smooth and\nreveals new and distinct information. Above 30.2 GeV, the combined electron\nplus positron flux can be described accurately by a single power law.\n", "  We consider the most general form of Bianchi types VIII and IX space-times\nfor studying proper affine symmetry by using holonomy and decomposability, the\nrank of the 6X6 Riemann matrix and direct integration techniques. Studying\nproper affine symmetry in the above space-times it is shown that there exists\nonly one possibilty when the above space-times admit proper affine vector\nfield.\n", "  Two-dimensional Yang-Mills models in a pseudo-euclidean space are considered\nfrom a point of view of a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon-Fock equations. It is\nshown that the Nahm reduction does not work, another choice is proposed and\ninvestigated. A quasiclassical quantization of the models is based on\nFeynmann-Maslov path integral construction and its zeta function representation\nin terms of a Green function diagonal for an auxiliary heat equation with an\nelliptic potential. The natural renormalization use a freedom in vacuum state\nchoice as well as the choice of the norm of an evolution operator eigenvectors.\nA nonzero mass appears via the quasiclassical correction.\n", "  Frequency-modulation (FM) spectroscopy has been extended to the\nvacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Coherent VUV\nlaser radiation is produced by resonance-enhanced sum-frequency mixing\n($\\nu_{\\mathrm{VUV}}=2\\nu_{\\mathrm{UV}}+\\nu_2$) in Kr and Xe using two\nnear-Fourier-transform-limited laser pulses of frequencies $\\nu_{\\mathrm{UV}}$\nand $\\nu_2$. Sidebands generated in the output of the second laser ($\\nu_2$)\nusing an electro-optical modulator operating at the frequency\n$\\nu_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ are directly transfered to the VUV and used to record FM\nspectra. Demodulation is demonstrated both at $\\nu_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ and\n$2\\nu_{\\mathrm{mod}}$. The main advantages of the method are that its\nsensitivity is not reduced by pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the VUV laser\nintensity, compared to VUV absorption spectroscopy is its background-free\nnature, the fact that its implementation using table-top laser equipment is\nstraightforward and that it can be used to record VUV absorption spectra of\ncold samples in skimmed supersonic beams simultaneously with\nlaser-induced-fluorescence and photoionization spectra. To illustrate these\nadvantages we present VUV FM spectra of Ar, Kr, and N$_2$ in selected regions\nbetween 105000cm$^{-1}$ and 122000cm$^{-1}$.\n", "  We present a new uncertainty relation by defining a measure of uncertainty\nbased on skew information. For bipartite systems, we establish uncertainty\nrelations with the existence of a quantum memory. A general relation between\nquantum correlations and tight bounds of uncertainty has been presented.\n", "  Results of investigations of the near-horizontal muons in the range of zenith\nangles of 85-95 degrees are presented. In this range, so-called \"albedo\" muons\n(atmospheric muons scattered in the ground into the upper hemisphere) are\ndetected. Albedo muons are one of the main sources of the background in\nneutrino experiments. Experimental data of two series of measurements conducted\nat the experimental complex NEVOD-DECOR with the duration of about 30 thousand\nhours \"live\" time are analyzed. The results of measurements of the muon flux\nintensity are compared with simulation results using Monte-Carlo on the basis\nof two multiple Coulomb scattering models: model of point-like nuclei and model\ntaking into account finite size of nuclei.\n", "  We analyze shot noise in a magnetic tunnel junction with a two-level quantum\ndot attached to the magnetic electrodes. The considerations are limited to the\ncase when some transport channels are suppressed at low temperatures. Coupling\nof the two dot's levels to the electrodes are assumed to be generally different\nand also spin-dependent. To calculate the shot noise we apply the approach\nbased on the full counting statistics. The approach is used to account for\nexperimental data obtained in magnetic tunnel junctions with organic barriers.\nThe experimentally observed Fano factors correspond to the super-Poissonian\nstatistics, and also depend on relative orientation of the electrodes' magnetic\nmoments. We have also calculated the corresponding spin shot noise, which is\nassociated with fluctuations of spin current.\n", "  The Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ data with the high\nluminosity to be provided by the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron\ncollider. The anticipated high statistics data enables us to perform studies of\n$B$ decays involving $\\tau$ leptons such as $B^+ \\to \\tau^+ \\nu_\\tau$ and $B\n\\to D^{(*)} \\tau^+ \\nu_\\tau$ modes. The precise measurements of branching\nfraction and of the $\\tau$ lepton polarization in these $B$ decays provide a\nvery sensitive indirect search for a charged Higgs boson. Belle II sensitivity\nfor the charged Higgs is complementary to direct searches at ATLAS and CMS.\nWith the large data sample and by using dedicated triggers the Belle II\nexperiment is expected to explore dark sector by searching for visible and\ninvisible decays of the dark photon and the dark Higgs boson, and by also\nsearching for low mass dark matter with unprecedented precision.\n", "  In many domains of physics, methods are needed to deal with non-perturbative\naspects. I want here to argue that a good approach is to work on the Borel\ntransforms of the quantities of interest, the singularities of which give\nnon-perturbative contributions. These singularities in many cases can be\nlargely determined by using the alien calculus developed by Jean \\'Ecalle. My\nmain example will be the two point function of a massless theory given as a\nsolution of a renormalization group equation.\n", "  By introducing a simplified transport model of outer layers of white dwarfs\nwe derive an analytical semi-empirical relation which constrains effective\ntemperature-mass-radius for white dwarfs. This relation is used to classify\nrecent data of white dwarfs according to their time evolution in non-accretion\nprocess of cooling. This formula permit us to study the population map of white\ndwarfs in the central temperature and mass plane, and discuss the relation with\nthe ignition temperature for C-O material. Our effective\ntemperature-mass-radius relation provide a quick method to estimate the mass of\nnewly observed white dwarfs from their spectral measurements of effective\ntemperature and superficial gravity.\n", "  The focus of the current research is to identify people of interest in social\nnetworks. We are especially interested in studying dark networks, which\nrepresent illegal or covert activity. In such networks, people are unlikely to\ndisclose accurate information when queried. We present REDLEARN, an algorithm\nfor sampling dark networks with the goal of identifying as many nodes of\ninterest as possible. We consider two realistic lying scenarios, which describe\nhow individuals in a dark network may attempt to conceal their connections. We\ntest and present our results on several real-world multilayered networks, and\nshow that REDLEARN achieves up to a 340% improvement over the next best\nstrategy.\n", "  In this paper, we prove the energy diminishing of a normalized gradient flow\nwhich provides a mathematical justification of the imaginary time method used\nin physical literatures to compute the ground state solution of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BEC). We also investigate the energy diminishing property for the\ndiscretization of the normalized gradient flow. Two numerical methods are\nproposed for such discretizations: one is the backward Euler centered finite\ndifference (BEFD), the other one is an explicit time-splitting sine-spectral\n(TSSP) method. Energy diminishing for BEFD and TSSP for linear case, and\nmonotonicity for BEFD for both linear and nonlinear cases are proven.\nComparison between the two methods and existing methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson\nfinite difference (CNFD) or forward Euler finite difference (FEFD), shows that\nBEFD and TSSP are much better in terms of preserving energy diminishing\nproperty of the normalized gradient flow. Numerical results in 1d, 2d and 3d\nwith magnetic trap confinement potential, as well as a potential of a stirrer\ncorresponding to a far-blue detuned Gaussian laser beam are reported to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BEFD and TSSP methods. Furthermore we observe\nthat the normalized gradient flow can also be applied directly to compute the\nfirst excited state solution in BEC when the initial data is chosen as an odd\nfunction.\n", "  We study numerically the time-independent vector Gross-Pitaevskii equations\n(VGPEs) for ground states and time-dependent VGPEs with (or without) an\nexternal driven field for dynamics describing a multi-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) at zero or very low temperature. In preparation for the\nnumerics, we scale the 3d VGPEs, approximately reduce it to lower dimensions,\npresent a normalized gradient flow (NGF) to compute ground states of\nmulti-component BEC, prove energy diminishing of the NGF which provides a\nmathematical justification, discretize it by the backward Euler finite\ndifference (BEFD) which is monotone in linear and nonlinear cases and preserves\nenergy diminishing property in linear case. Then we use a time-splitting\nsine-spectral method (TSSP) to discretize the time-dependent VGPEs with an\nexternal driven field for computing dynamics of multi-component BEC. The merit\nof the TSSP for VGPEs is that it is explicit, unconditionally stable, time\nreversible and time transverse invariant if the VGPEs is, `good' resolution in\nthe semiclassical regime, of spectral order accuracy in space and second order\naccuracy in time, and conserves the total particle number in the discretized\nlevel. Extensive numerical examples in 3d for ground states and dynamics of\nmulti-component BEC are presented to demonstrate the power of the numerical\nmethods and to discuss the physics of multi-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensates.\n", "  We numerically study the behavior of collapsing and exploding condensates\nusing the parameters of the experiments by E.A. Donley et al. [Nature,\n  412, 295, (2001)]. Our studies are based on a full three-dimensional\nnumerical solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) including three body\nloss. We determine the three body loss rate from the number of remnant\ncondensate atoms and collapse times and obtain only one possible value which\nfits with the experimental results. We then study the formation of jet atoms by\ninterrupting the collapse and find very good agreement with the experiment.\nFurthermore we investigate the sensitivity of the jets to the initial\nconditions. According to our analysis the dynamics of the burst atoms is not\ndescribed by the GPE with three body loss incorporated.\n", "  A fourth-order time-splitting Laguerre-Hermite pseudospectral method is\nintroduced for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in 3-D with cylindrical\nsymmetry.\n  The method is explicit, unconditionally stable, time reversible and time\ntransverse invariant. It conserves the position density, and is spectral\naccurate in space and fourth-order accurate in time. Moreover, the new method\nhas two other important advantages: (i) it reduces a 3-D problem with\ncylindrical symmetry to an effective 2-D problem; (ii) it solves the problem in\nthe whole space instead of in a truncated artificial computational domain. The\nmethod is applied to vector Gross-Pitaevskii equations (VGPEs) for\nmulti-component BECs. Extensive numerical tests are presented for 1-D GPE, 2-D\nGPE with radial symmetry, 3-D GPE with cylindrical symmetry as well as 3-D\nVGPEs for two-component BECs to show the efficiency and accuracy of the new\nnumerical method.\n", "  We perform numerical studies including Monte Carlo simulations of high\nrotational symmetry random tilings. For computational convenience, our tilings\nobey fixed boundary conditions in regular polygons. Such tilings are put in\ncorrespondence with algorithms for sorting lists in computer science. We obtain\nstatistics on path counting and vertex coordination which compare well with\npredictions of mean-field theory and allow estimation of the configurational\nentropy, which tends to the value 0.568 per vertex in the limit of continuous\nsymmetry. Tilings with phason strain appear to share the same entropy as\nunstrained tilings, as predicted by mean-field theory. We consider the\nthermodynamic limit and argue that the limiting fixed boundary entropy equals\nthe limiting free boundary entropy, although these differ for finite rotational\nsymmetry.\n", "  We present several applications of quantum amplitude amplification to finding\nclaws and collisions in ordered or unordered functions. Our algorithms\ngeneralize those of Brassard, Hoyer, and Tapp, and imply an O(N^{3/4} log N)\nquantum upper bound for the element distinctness problem in the comparison\ncomplexity model (contrasting with Theta(N log N) classical complexity). We\nalso prove a lower bound of Omega(N^{1/2}) comparisons for this problem and\nderive bounds for a number of related problems.\n", "  We demonstrate that the unbounded fan-out gate is very powerful.\nConstant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits with bounded fan-in and\nunbounded fan-out over a fixed basis (denoted by QNCf^0) can approximate with\npolynomially small error the following gates: parity, mod[q], And, Or,\nmajority, threshold[t], exact[q], and Counting. Classically, we need\nlogarithmic depth even if we can use unbounded fan-in gates. If we allow\narbitrary one-qubit gates instead of a fixed basis, then these circuits can\nalso be made exact in log-star depth. Sorting, arithmetical operations, phase\nestimation, and the quantum Fourier transform with arbitrary moduli can also be\napproximated in constant depth.\n", "  The quantum adversary method is one of the most successful techniques for\nproving lower bounds on quantum query complexity. It gives optimal lower bounds\nfor many problems, has application to classical complexity in formula size\nlower bounds, and is versatile with equivalent formulations in terms of weight\nschemes, eigenvalues, and Kolmogorov complexity. All these formulations rely on\nthe principle that if an algorithm successfully computes a function then, in\nparticular, it is able to distinguish between inputs which map to different\nvalues.\n  We present a stronger version of the adversary method which goes beyond this\nprinciple to make explicit use of the stronger condition that the algorithm\nactually computes the function. This new method, which we call ADV+-, has all\nthe advantages of the old: it is a lower bound on bounded-error quantum query\ncomplexity, its square is a lower bound on formula size, and it behaves well\nwith respect to function composition. Moreover ADV+- is always at least as\nlarge as the adversary method ADV, and we show an example of a monotone\nfunction for which ADV+-(f)=Omega(ADV(f)^1.098). We also give examples showing\nthat ADV+- does not face limitations of ADV like the certificate complexity\nbarrier and the property testing barrier.\n", "  In this note, we give a quantum algorithm that finds collisions in arbitrary\nr-to-one functions after only O((N/r)^(1/3)) expected evaluations of the\nfunction. Assuming the function is given by a black box, this is more efficient\nthan the best possible classical algorithm, even allowing probabilism. We also\ngive a similar algorithm for finding claws in pairs of functions. Furthermore,\nwe exhibit a space-time tradeoff for our technique. Our approach uses Grover's\nquantum searching algorithm in a novel way.\n"]}
