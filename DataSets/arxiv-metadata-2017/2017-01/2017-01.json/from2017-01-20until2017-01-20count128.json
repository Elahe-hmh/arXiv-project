Models specialize in nonlinear systems of possibly\ndegenerate parabolic equations, which include phenomenological terms related to\nspecific cell functions. The paper discusses general modeling guidelines for\nsuch terms, as well as for initial and boundary conditions, aiming at both\nbiological consistency and mathematical robustness of the resulting problems.\nParticularly, it addresses some qualitative properties such as a priori\nnonnegativity, boundedness, and uniqueness of the solutions. Existence of the\nsolutions is studied in the one-dimensional time-independent case.\n", "  We consider the cosmological horizons in the expanding universe from the\npoint of view of observer moving with respect to CMB frame. The deformation\n(non-sphericity) of cosmological horizons is demonstrated. Some principle\nconsequences are discussed.\n", "  We propose a simple model for a binary decision making process on a graph,\nmotivated by modeling social decision making with cooperative individuals. The\nmodel is similar to a random field Ising model or fiber bundle model, but with\nkey differences on heterogeneous networks. For many types of disorder and\ninteractions between the nodes, we predict discontinuous phase transitions with\nmean field theory which are largely independent of network structure. We show\nhow these phase transitions can also be understood by studying microscopic\navalanches, and describe how network structure enhances fluctuations in the\ndistribution of avalanches. We suggest theoretically the existence of a\n\"glassy\" spectrum of equilibria associated with a typical phase, even on\ninfinite graphs, so long as the first moment of the degree distribution is\nfinite. This behavior implies that the model is robust against noise below a\ncertain scale, and also that phase transitions can switch from discontinuous to\ncontinuous on networks with too few edges. Numerical simulations suggest that\nour theory is accurate.\n", "  A semiclassical method to determine if the classical limit of a quantum\nsystem is chaotic or not, based on Pesin theorem, is presented. The method is\napplied to a phenomenological Gamow--type model and it is concluded that its\nclassical limit is chaotic.\n", "  We present a new cycle flow based method for finding fuzzy partitions of\nweighted directed networks coming from time series data. We show that this\nmethod overcomes essential problems of most existing clustering approaches,\nwhich tend to ignore important directional information by considering only\none-step, one-directional node connections. Our method introduces a novel\nmeasure of communication between nodes using multi-step, bidirectional\ntransitions encoded by a cycle decomposition of the probability flow. Symmetric\nproperties of this measure enable us to construct an undirected graph that\ncaptures information flow of the original graph seen by the data and apply\nclustering methods designed for undirected graphs. Finally, we demonstrate our\nalgorithm by analyzing earthquake time series data, which naturally induce\n(time-)directed networks. This article has been published originally in EPL,\nDOI: 10.1209/0295-5075/108/68008. This version differs from the published\nversion by minor formatting details.\n", "  We provide a set of exact solutions of the classical Yang-Mills equations.\nThey have the property to satisfy a massive dispersion relation and hold in all\ngauges. These solutions can be used to describe the vacuum of the quantum\nYang-Mills theory and so, they provide a general framework to build a quantum\nfield theory. The components of the field become separated on a generic gauge\nbut are all equal just in the Lorenz (Landau) gauge.\n", "  Let $\\mathbf{g}$ be a pseudo--Riemanian metric of arbitrary signature on a\nmanifold $\\mathbf{V}$ with conventional $n+n$ dimensional splitting, $\\ n\\geq\n2,$ determined by a nonholonomic (non--integrable) distribution $\\mathcal{N}$\ndefining a generalized (nonlinear) connection and associated nonholonomic frame\nstructures. We shall work with a correspondingly adapted linear metric\ncompatible connection $\\hat{\\mathbf{D}}$ and its nonzero torsion\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}$, both completely determined by $\\mathbf{g}$. Our first goal\nis to prove that there are certain generalized frame and/or jet transforms and\nprolongations with $(\\mathbf{g},\\mathbf{V})\\rightarrow\n(\\hat{\\mathbf{g}},\\hat{\\mathbf{V}})$ into explicit classes of solutions of some\ngeneralized Einstein equations $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}\\mathit{ic}=\\Lambda\n\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}$, $\\Lambda =const$, encoding various types of nonholonomic)\nRicci soliton configurations and/or jet variables and symmetries. The second\ngoal is to solve additional constraint equations for zero torsion,\n$\\hat{\\mathcal{T}}=0$, on generalized solutions constructed in explicit forms\nwith jet variables and extract Levi-Civita configurations. This allows us to\nfind generic off-diagonal exact solutions depending on all space time\ncoordinates on $\\mathbf{V}$ via generating and integration functions and\nvarious classes of constant jet parameters and associated symmetries. We shall\nstudy (third goal) how such generalized metrics and connections can be related\nby so-called \"half-conformal\" and/ or jet deformations of certain sub-classes\nof solutions with one, or two, Killing symmetries. Finally, there are\nconsidered some examples when exact solutions are constructed as nonholonomic\njet prolongations of the Kerr metrics, with possible Ricci soliton\ndeformations, and characterized by nonholonomic jet structures and generalized\nconnections.\n", "  Estimates of the source sky location for gravitational wave signals are\nlikely span areas ranging up to hundreds of square degrees or more, making it\nvery challenging for most telescopes to search for counterpart signals in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. To boost the chance of successfully observing such\ncounterparts, we have developed an algorithm which optimizes the number of\nobserving fields and their corresponding time allocations by maximizing the\ndetection probability. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we optimize\nfollow-up observations targeting kilonovae using telescopes including CTIO-Dark\nEnergy Camera, Subaru-HyperSuprimeCam, Pan-STARRS and Palomar Transient\nFactory. We consider three simulated gravitational wave events with 90%\ncredible error regions spanning areas from ~30 deg^2 to ~300 deg^2. Assuming a\nsource at 200 Mpc, we demonstrate that to obtain a maximum detection\nprobability, there is an optimized number of fields for any particular event\nthat a telescope should observe. To inform future telescope design studies, we\npresent the maximum detection probability and corresponding number of observing\nfields for a combination of limiting magnitudes and fields-of-view over a range\nof parameters. We show that for large gravitational wave error regions,\ntelescope sensitivity rather than field-of-view, is the dominating factor in\nmaximizing the detection probability.\n", "  We study the impact of baryons on the distribution of dark matter in a Milky\nWay-size halo by comparing a high-resolution, moving-mesh cosmological\nsimulation with its dark matter-only counterpart. We identify three main\nprocesses related to baryons -- adiabatic contraction, tidal disruption and\nreionization -- which jointly shape the dark matter distribution in both the\nmain halo and its subhalos. The relative effect of each baryonic process\ndepends strongly on the subhalo mass. For massive subhalos with maximum\ncircular velocity $v_{\\rm max} > 35 km/s$, adiabatic contraction increases the\ndark matter concentration, making these halos less susceptible to tidal\ndisruption. For low-mass subhalos with $v_{\\rm max} < 20 km/s$, reionization\neffectively reduces their mass on average by $\\approx$ 30% and $v_{\\rm max}$ by\n$\\approx$ 20%. For intermediate subhalos with $20 km/s < v_{\\rm max} < 35\nkm/s$, which share a similar mass range as the classical dwarf spheroidals,\nstrong tidal truncation induced by the main galaxy reduces their $v_{\\rm max}$.\nMoreover, the stellar disk of the main galaxy effectively depletes subhalos\nnear the central region. As a combined result of reionization and increased\ntidal disruption, the total number of low-mass subhalos in the hydrodynamic\nsimulation is nearly halved compared to that of the $\\textit{N-}$body\nsimulation. We do not find dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies, unlike previous\nstudies that employed bursty feedback-driven outflows. The substantial impact\nof baryons on the abundance and internal structure of subhalos suggests that\ngalaxy formation and evolution models based on $\\textit{N}$-body simulations\nshould include these physical processes as major components.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally a precise realization of Coulomb Blockade\nThermometry (CBT) working at temperatures up to 60 K. Advances in nano\nfabrication methods using electron beam lithography allow us to fabricate a\nuniform arrays of sufficiently small tunnel junctions to guarantee an overall\ntemperature reading uncertainty of about 1\\%\n", "  This paper deals with the stochastic Ising model with a temperature shrinking\nto zero as time goes to infinity. A generalization of the Glauber dynamics is\nconsidered, on the basis of the existence of simultaneous flips of some spins.\nSuch dynamics act on a wide class of graphs which are periodic and embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. The interactions between couples of spins are assumed to be\nquenched i.i.d. random variables following a Bernoulli distribution with\nsupport $\\{-1,+1\\}$. The specific problem here analyzed concerns the assessment\nof how often (finitely or infinitely many times, almost surely) a given spin\nflips. Adopting the classification proposed in \\cite{GNS}, we present\nconditions in order to have models of type $\\mathcal{F}$ (any spin flips\nfinitely many times), $\\mathcal{I}$ (any spin flips infinitely many times) and\n$\\mathcal{M}$ (a mixed case). Several examples are provided in all dimensions\nand for different cases of graphs. The most part of the obtained results holds\ntrue for the case of zero-temperature and some of them for the cubic lattice\n$\\mathbb{L}_d=(\\mathbb{Z}^d, \\mathbb{E}_d)$ as well.\n", "  A simple system of two particles in a bidimensional configurational space $S$\nis studied. The possibility of breaking in $S$ the time independent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation of the system into two separated one-dimensional\none-body Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations is assumed. In this paper, we focus on how\nthe latter property is countered by imposing such boundary conditions as\nconfinement in a limited region of $S$ and/or restrictions on the joint\ncoordinate probability density stemming from the sign-invariance condition of\nthe relative coordinate (an impenetrability condition). Our investigation\ndemonstrates the reducibility of the problem under scrutiny into that of a\nsingle particle living in a limited domain of its bidimensional configurational\nspace. These general ideas are illustrated introducing the coordinates $X_c$\nand $x$ of the center of mass of two particles and of the associated relative\nmotion, respectively. The effects of the confinement and the impenetrability\nare then analyzed by studying with the help of an appropriate Green's function\nand the time evolution of the covariance of $X_c$ and $x$. Moreover, to\ncalculate the state of the single particle constrained within a square, a\nrhombus, a triangle and a rectangle the Green's function expression in terms of\nJacobi $\\theta_3$-function is applied. All the results are illustrated by\nexamples.\n", "  A quantum system interacting with its environment is subject to dephasing\nwhich ultimately destroys the information it holds. Using a superconducting\nqubit, we experimentally show that this dephasing has both dynamic and\ngeometric origins. It is found that geometric dephasing, which is present even\nin the adiabatic limit and when no geometric phase is acquired, can either\nreduce or restore coherence depending on the orientation of the path the qubit\ntraces out in its projective Hilbert space. It accompanies the evolution of any\nsystem in Hilbert space subjected to noise.\n", "  Modern radio telescopes are favouring densely packed array layouts with large\nnumbers of antennas ($N_\\textrm{A}\\gtrsim 1000$). Since the complexity of\ntraditional correlators scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N_\\textrm{A}^2)$, there will be\na steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful\ninstruments. Through our generic and efficient E-field Parallel Imaging\nCorrelator (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized\ndirect imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF)\nimager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to\n$\\mathcal{O}(N_\\textrm{A}\\log_2 N_\\textrm{A})$ but can also image from\nirregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular,\nparallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available.\nWe have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional\ntechniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also\nvalidated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array\n(LWA1). We provide a detailed framework for imaging with heterogeneous arrays\nand show that EPIC robustly estimates the input sky model for such arrays.\nAntenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting of a large number of\nantennas such as LWA, the Square Kilometre Array, Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array, and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment will\ngain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of\nEPIC. The algorithm is a strong candidate for instruments targeting transient\nsearches of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) as well as planetary and exoplanetary\nphenomena due to the availability of high-speed calibrated time-domain images\nand low output bandwidth relative to visibility-based systems.\n", "  A spin system on a lattice can usually be modelled at large scales by an\neffective quantum field theory. A key mathematical result relating the two\ndescriptions is the quantum central limit theorem, which shows that certain\nspin observables satisfy an algebra of bosonic fields under certain conditions.\nHere, we show that these particular observables and conditions are the relevant\nones for an observer with certain limited abilities to resolve spatial\nlocations as well as spin values. This is shown by computing the asymptotic\nbehaviour of a quantum Fisher information metric as function of the resolution\nparameters. The relevant observables characterise the state perturbations whose\ndistinguishability does not decay too fast as a function of spatial or spin\nresolution.\n", "  The classic composite fermion field theory (Ref. 1) builds up an excellent\nframework to uniformly study important physical objects and globally explain\nanomalous experimental phenomena in fractional quantum Hall physics while there\nare also inherent weaknesses. We present a nonperturbative emergent Dirac\nfermion theory from this strongly correlated composite fermion field theory,\nwhich overcomes these serious long-standing shortcomings. The particle-hole\nsymmetry of Dirac equation resolves this particle-hole symmetry enigma in the\ncomposite fermion field theory. With the help of presented numerical data, we\nshow that for main Jain's sequences of fractional quantum Hall effects, this\nemergent Dirac fermion theory is most likely nonperturbatively stable.\n", "  In the present paper we have developed a Non-Commutative (NC) generalization\nof perfect fluid model from first principles, in a Hamiltonian framework. The\nnoncommutativity is introduced at the Lagrangian (particle) coordinate space\nbrackets and the induced NC fluid bracket algebra for the Eulerian (fluid)\nfield variables is derived. Together with a Hamiltonian this NC algebra\ngenerates the generalized fluid dynamics that satisfies exact local\nconservation laws for mass and energy thereby maintaining mass and energy\nconservation. However, nontrivial NC correction terms appear in charge and\nenergy fluxes. Other non-relativistic spacetime symmetries of the NC fluid are\nalso discussed in detail. This constitutes the study of kinematics and dynamics\nof NC fluid.\n  In the second part we construct an extension of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) cosmological model based on the NC fluid dynamics presented here. We\noutline the way in which NC effects generate cosmological perturbations\nbringing in anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the model. We also derive a NC\nextended Friedmann equation.\n", "  We present experimental results in which the unexpected zero-two transition\nof a circuit composed of two inductively coupled transmons is observed. This\ntransition shows an unusual magnetic flux dependence with a clear disappearance\nat zero magnetic flux. In a transmon qubit the symmetry of the wave functions\nprevents this transition to occur due to selection rule. In our circuit the\nJosephson effect introduces strong couplings between the two normal modes of\nthe artificial atom. This leads to a coherent superposition of states from the\ntwo modes enabling such transitions to occur.\n", "  Recent ab initio calculations and experiments reported\ninsulating-semimetallic phase transitions in multilayer phosphorene under a\nperpendicular dc field, pressure or doping, as a possible route to realize\ntopological phases. In this work, we show that even a monolayer phosphorene may\nundergo Lifshitz transitions toward semimetallic and topological insulating\nphases, provided it is rapidly driven by in-plane time-periodic laser fields.\nBased on a four-orbital tight-binding description, we give an\ninversion-symmetry-based prescription in order to apprehend the topology of the\nphoton-renormalized band structure, up to the second order in the\nhigh-frequency limit. Apart from the initial band insulating behavior, two\nadditional phases are thus identified. A semimetallic phase with massless Dirac\nelectrons may be induced by linear polarized fields, whereas elliptic polarized\nfields are likely to drive the material into an anomalous quantum Hall phase.\n", "  The ground state subspace of a topological phase of matter forms a\nrepresentation of the mapping class group of the space on which the state is\ndefined. We show that elements of the mapping class group of a surface of genus\n$g$ can be obtained through a sequence of topological charge projections along\nat least three mutually intersecting non-contractible cycles. We demonstrate\nthis both through the algebraic theory of anyons and also through an analysis\nof the topology of the space-time manifold. We combine this result with two\nobservations: (i) that surfaces of genus $g$ can be effectively simulated in\nplanar geometries by using bilayer, or doubled, versions of the topological\nphase of interest, and inducing the appropriate types of gapped boundaries; and\n(ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as\nadiabatic unitary transformations by locally tuning microscopic parameters of\nthe system, such as the energy gap. These observations suggest a possible path\ntowards effectively implementing modular transformations in physical systems.\nIn particular, they also show how the $\\text{Ising} \\otimes\n\\overline{\\text{Ising}}$ state, in the presence of disconnected gapped\nboundaries, can support universal topological quantum computation.\n", "  Within this work, the kinetics of the growing stage of porous silicon (PS)\nduring the etching process was studied using the photoacoustic technique. A\np-type Si with low resistivity was used as a substrate. An extension of\nRosencwaig and Gersho model is proposed in order to analyze the temporary\nchanges that take place in the amplitude of the photoacoustic signal during the\nPS growth. The solution of the heat equation takes into account the modulated\nlaser beam, the changes in the reflectance of the PS-backing heterostructure,\nthe electrochemical reaction, and the Joule effect as thermal sources. The\nmodel includes the time-dependence of the sample thickness during the\nelectrochemical etching of PS. The changes in the reflectance are identified as\nthe laser reflections in the internal layers of the system. The reflectance is\nmodeled by an additional sinusoidal-monochromatic light source and its\nmodulated frequency is related to the velocity of the PS growth. The chemical\nreaction and the DC components of the heat sources are taken as an average\nvalue from the experimental data. The theoretical results are in agreement with\nthe experimental data and hence provided a method to determine variables of the\nPS growth, such as the etching velocity and the thickness of the porous layer\nduring the growing process.\n", "  We consider an extreme type-II superconducting wire with non-smooth cross\nsection, i.e., with one or more corners at the boundary, in the framework of\nthe Ginzburg-Landau theory. We prove the existence of an interval of values of\nthe applied field, where superconductivity is spread uniformly along the\nboundary of the sample. More precisely the energy is not affected to leading\norder by the presence of corners and the modulus of the Ginzburg-Landau\nminimizer is approximately constant along the transversal direction. The\ncritical fields delimiting this surface superconductivity regime coincide with\nthe ones in absence of boundary singularities.\n", "  We have studied the electronic excitation spectrum in periodically rippled\ngraphene on Ru(0001) and flat, commensurate graphene on Ni(111) by means of\nhigh-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and a combination of density\nfunctional theory and tight-binding approaches. We show that the periodic\nmoir\\'e superlattice originated by the lattice mismatch in graphene/Ru(0001)\ninduces the emergence of an extra mode, which is not present in\ngraphene/Ni(111). Contrary to the ordinary intra-band plasmon of doped\ngraphene, the extra mode is robust in charge-neutral graphene/metal contacts,\nhaving its origin in electron-hole inter-band transitions between van Hove\nsingularities that emerge in the reconstructed band structure, due to the\nmoir\\'e pattern superlattice.\n", "  We consider a homogeneous, balanced gas of strongly interacting fermions in\ntwo spin states interacting through a large scattering length. Finite range\ncorrections are needed for a quantitative description of data which experiments\nand numerical simulations have provided. We use a perturbative field\ntheoretical framework and a tool called the Operator Product Expansion (OPE),\nwhich together allow for the expression of finite range corrections to the\nuniversal relations and momentum distribution. Using the OPE, we derive the\n$1/k^6$ part of the momentum tail, which is related to the sum of the\nderivative of the energy with respect to the finite range and the averaged\nkinetic energy of opposite spin pairs. By comparing the $1/k^4$ term and the\n$1/k^6$ correction in the momentum distribution to provided Quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) data, we show that including the $1/k^6$ part offers marked improvements.\nOur field theoretical approach allows for a clear understanding of the role of\nthe scattering length and finite effective range in the universal relations and\nthe momentum distribution.\n", "  We consider decay of supercurrent via phase slips in a discrete\none-dimensional superconductor (a chain of nodes connected by superconducting\nlinks), aiming to explain the experimentally observed power-3/2 scaling of the\nactivation barrier in nanowires at currents close to the critical. We find\nthat, in this discrete model, the power-3/2 scaling holds for both long and\nshort wires even in the presence of bulk superconducting leads, despite the\nsuppression of thermal fluctuations at the ends. We also consider decay via\ntunneling (quantum phase slips), which becomes important at low temperatures.\nWe find numerically the relevant Euclidean solutions (periodic instantons) and\ndetermine the scaling of the tunneling exponent near the critical current. The\nscaling law is power-5/4, different from that of the thermal activation\nexponent.\n", "  We consider a symmetric gap plasmon guide (a folded Kretschmann\nconfiguration) supporting both symmeric and antisymmetric coupled surface\nplasmons. We calculate the transverse spin under illumination from both the\nsides like in coherent perfect absorption (CPA), whereby all the incident light\ncan be absorbed to excite one of the modes of the structure. Significant\nenhancement in the transverse spin is shown to be possible when the CPA dip and\nthe mode excitation are at the same frequency. The enhancement results from\nCPA-mediated total transfer of the incident light to either of the coupled\nmodes and the associated large local fields. The transverse spin is localized\nin the structure since in the ambient dielectric there are only incident plane\nwaves lacking any structure.\n", "  We present new accretion solutions of a polytropic perfect fluid onto an\nf(R)-gravity de Sitter-like black hole. We consider two f(R)-gravity models and\nobtain finite-period cyclic flows oscillating between the event and\ncosmological horizons as well as semi-cyclic critical flows executing a two-way\nmotion from and back to the same horizon. Besides the generalizations and new\nsolutions presented in this work, a corrigendum to Eur. Phys. J. C (2016)\n76:280 is provided.\n", "  Galileon radiation in the collapse of a thin spherical shell of matter is\nanalyzed. In the framework of a cubic Galileon theory, we compute the field\nprofile produced at large distances by a short collapse, finding that the\nradiated field has two peaks traveling ahead of light fronts. The total energy\nradiated during the collapse follows a power law scaling with the shell's\nphysical width and results from two competing effects: a Vainshtein suppression\nof the emission and an enhancement due to the thinness of the shell.\n", "  If an Unruh-DeWitt detector operates for an infinite proper time along the\ntrajectory of a uniformly accelerated observer in Fock space then induced\ntransition rate of the detector is proportional to Planck distribution. For a\nrealistic detector which operates only for a finite period, the instantaneous\ntransition rate contains both transient and non-transient terms. In particular,\nthe non-transient term contains a residue evaluated at the pole of the\ntwo-point function. We show here by considering a massless scalar field that\nunlike in Fock quantization, the short-distance two-point function contains no\npole in polymer quantization, the quantization techniques used in loop quantum\ngravity. Consequently, corresponding transition rate of the Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector contains only transient terms. Thus, the result presented here\nprovides an alternative evidence for absence of Unruh effect in polymer\nquantization which was shown earlier by the authors using methods of Bogoliubov\ntransformation and Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition.\n", "  We develop a theoretical framework to characterize the decoherence dynamics\ndue to multi-photon scattering in an all-optical switch based on Rydberg atom\ninduced nonlinearities. By incorporating the knowledge of this decoherence\nprocess into optimal photon storage and retrieval strategies, we establish\noptimised switching protocols for experimentally relevant conditions, and\nevaluate the corresponding limits in the achievable fidelities. Based on these\nresults we work out a simplified description that reproduces recent experiments\n[arXiv:1511.09445] and provides a new interpretation in terms of many-body\ndecoherence involving multiple incident photons and multiple gate excitations\nforming the switch. Aside from offering insights into the operational capacity\nof realistic photon switching capabilities, our work provides a complete\ndescription of spin wave decoherence in a Rydberg quantum optics setting, and\nhas immediate relevance to a number of further applications employing photon\nstorage in Rydberg media.\n", "  The recent emergence of detections of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect through cross-correlation techniques is encouraging for the prospects of\nfuture cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. Extracting information on\nthe large-scale velocity fields and constraining cosmological parameters from\nsuch kSZ measurements requires an understanding of the optical depth to CMB\nphotons through halos. Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we find that\nthere exists a low-scatter relation between the optical depth and thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal of halos within a physical aperture. We propose\nthat such a relation can be used to break the degeneracy between optical depth\nand line-of-sight velocity in kSZ measurements. The limiting factors in our\nproposal are systematic uncertainties associated with the sub-grid physics\nmodels in the simulations, which we calculate to be less than 10 percent. We\ndiscuss future observational measurements that could potentially be used to\nmitigate the systematic uncertainties in this scaling relation.\n", "  We study whether it is possible to design a \"classical\" spatially flat\nbouncing cosmology or a static, spherically symmetric asymptotically flat\nLorentzian wormhole in cubic Galileon theories interacting with an extra scalar\nfield. We show that bouncing models are always plagued with gradient\ninstabilities, while there are always ghosts in wormhole backgrounds.\n", "  We present a new fourth-order, finite-volume hydrodynamics code named Apsara.\nThe code employs a high-order, finite-volume method for mapped coordinates with\nextensions for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Apsara can handle\narbitrary structured curvilinear meshes in three spatial dimensions. The code\nhas successfully passed several hydrodynamic test problems, including the\nadvection of a Gaussian density profile and a nonlinear vortex and the\npropagation of linear acoustic waves. For these test problems, Apsara produces\nfourth-order accurate results in case of smooth grid mappings. The order of\naccuracy is reduced to first-order when using the nonsmooth circular grid\nmapping. When applying the high-order method to simulations of low-Mach number\nflows, for example, the Gresho vortex and the Taylor-Green vortex, we discover\nthat Apsara delivers superior results to codes based on the dimensionally\nsplit, piecewise parabolic method (PPM) widely used in astrophysics. Hence,\nApsara is a suitable tool for simulating highly subsonic flows in astrophysics.\nIn the first astrophysical application, we perform implicit large eddy\nsimulations (ILES) of anisotropic turbulence in the context of core collapse\nsupernova (CCSN) and obtain results similar to those previously reported.\n", "  We propose a scenario where only the Higgs multiplets have direct couplings\nto a supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking sector. The standard model matter multiplets\nas well as the gauge multiples are sequestered from the SUSY breaking sector;\ntherefore, their masses arise via anomaly mediation at the high energy scale\nwith a gravitino mass of $\\sim$100 TeV. Due to renormalization group running\neffects from the Higgs soft masses, the masses of the third generation\nsfermions become O(10) TeV at the low energy scale, while the first and second\ngeneration sfermion masses are O(0.1-1) TeV, avoiding the tachyonic slepton\nproblem and flavor changing neutral current problem. With the splitting mass\nspectrum, the muon g-2 anomaly is explained consistently with the observed\nHiggs boson mass of 125 GeV. Moreover, the third generation Yukawa couplings\nare expected to be unified in some regions.\n", "  We investigate the photo-doubleionization of $H_2$ molecules with 400 eV\nphotons. We find that the emitted electrons do not show any sign of two-center\ninterference fringes in their angular emission distributions if considered\nseparately. In contrast, the quasi-particle consisting of both electrons (i.e.\nthe \"dielectron\") does. The work highlights the fact that non-local effects are\nembedded everywhere in nature where many-particle processes are involved.\n", "  The main object of investigation in magnonics, spin waves (SWs) are promising\ninformation carriers. Presently the most commonly studied are plane wave-like\nSWs and SWs propagating in confined structures, such as waveguides. Here we\nconsider a Gaussian SW beam obliquely incident on an ultra-narrow interface\nbetween two identical ferromagnetic materials. We use an analytical model and\nmicromagnetic simulations for an in-depth analysis of the influence of the\ninterface properties, in particular the magnetic anisotropy, on the\ntransmission of the SW beam. We derive analytical formulas for the reflectance,\ntransmittance, phase shift and Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift for beams reflected and\nrefracted by an interface between two semi-infinite ferromagnetic media; the\nresults for the refracted beam are the first to be reported to date. The GH\nshifts in SW beam reflection and transmission are confirmed by micromagnetic\nsimulations in the thin-film geometry. We demonstrate the dependence of the\ncharacteristic properties on the magnetic anisotropy at the interface, the\nangle of incidence and the frequency of the SWs. We also propose a method for\nthe excitation of high-quality SW beams in micromagnetic simulations.\n", "  We experimentally study the transport prop- erties of dipolar and fundamental\nmodes on one di- mensional (1D) coupled waveguide arrays. By carefully\nmodulating a wide optical beam, we are able to effec- tively excite dipolar or\nfundamental modes to study discrete diffraction (single-site excitation) and\ngaussian beam propagation (multi-site excitation plus a phase gradient). We\nobserve that dipolar modes experience a larger spreading area due to an\neffective larger coupling constant, which is found to be more than two times\nlarger than the one for fundamental modes. Addition- ally, we study the effect\nof non-diagonal disorder and find that while fundamental modes are already\ntrapped on a weakly disorder array, dipoles are still able to prop- agate\nacross the system.\n", "  Pion valence distributions in nuclear medium and vacuum are studied in a\nlight-front constituent quark model. The in-medium input for studying the pion\nproperties is calculated by the quark-meson coupling model. We find that the\nin-medium pion valence distribution, as well as the in-medium pion valence wave\nfunction, are substantially modified at normal nuclear matter density, due to\nthe reduction in the pion decay constant.\n", "  We propose the mechanism to disentangle the decay constant of closed string\naxion from the string scale in the framework of type II string theory on\nCalabi-Yau manifold. We find that the quantum and geometrical corrections in\nthe prepotential that arise at some special points in the moduli space widen\nthe window of axion decay constant. In particular, around the small complex\nstructure points, the axion decay constant becomes significantly lower than the\nstring scale. We also discuss the moduli stabilization leading to the\nphenomenologically attractive low-scale axion decay constant.\n", "  Using {\\it ab initio} methods, we investigate the modification of the\nmagnetic properties of the $m=2$ member of the strontium iridates\nRuddlesden-Popper series Sr$_{m+1}$Ir$_{m}$O$_{3m+1}$, bilayer\nSr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, induced by epitaxial strain and oxygen vacancies. Unlike the\nsingle layer compound Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, which exhibits a robust in-plane magnetic\norder, the energy difference between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic\norderings in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is much smaller and it is expected that small\nexternal perturbations could induce magnetic transitions. Our results indicate\nthat epitaxial strain yields a spin-flop transition, that is driven by the\ncrossover between the intralayer $J_1$ and interlayer $J_2$ magnetic exchange\ninteractions upon compressive strain. While $J_1$ is essentially insensitive to\nstrain effects, the strength of $J_2$ changes by one order of magnitude for\ntensile strains $\\geq$ 3~\\%. In addition, our study clarifies that the unusual\nin-plane magnetic response observed in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ upon the application\nof an external magnetic field originates from the canting of the local magnetic\nmoments due to oxygen vacancies, which tilt the octahedral networks - thereby\nallowing for noncollinear spin configurations.\n", "  The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) diagnoses quantum chaos and the\nscrambling of quantum information via the spread of entanglement. The OTOC\nencodes forward and reverse evolutions and has deep connections with the flow\nof time. So do fluctuation relations such as Jarzynski's Equality, derived in\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics. I unite these two powerful, seemingly\ndisparate tools by deriving a Jarzynski-like equality for the OTOC. The\nequality's left-hand side equals the OTOC. The right-hand side suggests a\nprotocol for measuring the OTOC indirectly. The protocol is\nplatform-nonspecific and can be performed with weak measurement or with\ninterference. Time evolution need not be reversed in any interference trial.\nThe equality opens holography, condensed matter, and quantum information to new\ninsights from fluctuation relations and vice versa.\n", "  The efforts to pursue photo detection with extreme performance in terms of\nultrafast response time, broad detection wavelength range, and high sensitivity\nhave never been exhausted as driven by its wide range of optoelectronic and\nphotonic applications such as optical communications, interconnects, imaging\nand remote sensing1. 2D Dirac semimetal graphene has shown excellent potential\ntoward high performance photodetector with high operation speed, broadband\nresponse and efficient carrier multiplications benefiting from its linear\ndispersion band structure with high carrier mobility and zero bandgap2-4. As\nthe three dimensional analogues of graphene, Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 processes\nall advantages of graphene as a photosensitive material but potentially has\nstronger interaction with light as bulk material and thus enhanced\nresponsivity5,6, which promises great potential in improving the performance of\nphotodetector in various aspects . In this work, we report the realization of\nan ultrafast broadband photodetector based on Cd3As2. The prototype\nmetal-Cd3As2-metal photodetector exhibits a responsivity of 5.9 mA/W with\nresponse time of about 6.9 ps without any special device optimization.\nBroadband responses from 0.8 eV to 2.34 eV are measured with potential\ndetection range extendable to far infrared and terahertz. Systematical studies\nindicate that the photo-thermoelectric effect plays important roles in\nphotocurrent generation, similar to that in graphene. Our results suggest this\nemerging class of exotic quantum materials can be harnessed for photo detection\nwith high sensitivity and high speed (~145 GHz) in challenging\nmiddle/far-infrared and THz range.\n", "  Novel physical phenomena arising at the interface of complex oxide\nheterostructures offer exciting opportunities for the development of future\nelectronic devices. Using the prototypical LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a\nmodel system, we employ a single-step lithographic process to realize gate\ntunable Josephson junctions through a combination of lateral confinement and\nlocal side gating. The action of the side gates is found to be comparable to\nthat of a local back gate, constituting a robust and efficient way to control\nthe properties of the interface at the nanoscale. We demonstrate that the side\ngates enable reliable tuning of both the normal-state resistance and the\ncritical (Josephson) current of the constrictions. The conductance and\nJosephson current show mesoscopic fluctuations as a function of the applied\nside gate voltage, and the analysis of their amplitude enables the extraction\nof the phase coherence and thermal lengths. Finally, we realize a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device in which the critical currents of\neach of the constriction-type Josephson junctions can be controlled\nindependently via the side gates.\n", "  Observing how electronic states in solids react to a local symmetry breaking\nprovides insight into their microscopic nature. A striking example is the\nformation of bound states when quasiparticles are scattered off defects. This\nis known to occur, under specific circumstances, in some metals and\nsuperconductors but not, in general, in the charge-density-wave (CDW) state.\nHere, we report the unforeseen observation of bound states when a magnetic\nfield quenches superconductivity and induces long-range CDW order in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$. Bound states indeed produce an inhomogeneous pattern of the\nlocal density of states $N(E_F)$ that leads to a skewed distribution of Knight\nshifts which is detected here through an asymmetric profile of $^{17}$O NMR\nlines. We argue that the effect arises most likely from scattering off defects\nin the CDW state, which provides a novel case of disorder-induced bound states\nin a condensed-matter system and an insightful window into charge ordering in\nthe cuprates.\n", "  We consider both Otto and Diesel heat engine cycles running upon the working\nsubstances modeled by the van der Waals fluid as a simple non-ideal gas model.\nWe extensively perform the efficiency study in these model engines. Then we\nfind that this \"real\" engine model can go beyond its ideal-gas counterpart in\nefficiency, whereas as well-known, the maximum Carnot efficiency is the same\nfor both ideal and non-ideal gas engines. In fact, the higher the density of\nnon-ideality is, the higher efficiency tends to be found, especially in the\nlow-temperature regime, but with more shrinkage in the range of physically\nallowed compression ratio, determined by the Carnot upper bound, namely, the\nSecond Law of thermodynamics. Our findings imply that in addition to the engine\narchitectures and bath temperatures, the properties of working substances\nshould also be taken into consideration in the performance study of heat\nengines, the theoretical model aspects of which have not sufficiently been\ndiscussed so far. It is straightforward that our methodology may also apply for\nother non-ideal fluid models.\n", "  An ion-exchange-resin-based microfluidic pump is introduced that utilizes\ntrace amounts of ions to generate fluid flows. We show experimentally that our\npump operates in almost deionized water for periods exceeding 24h and induces\nfluid flows of um/s over hundreds of um. This flow displays a far-field,\npower-law decay which is characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) flow when the\nsystem is strongly confined and of three-dimensional (3D) flow when it is not.\nUsing theory and numerical calculations we demonstrate that our observations\nare consistent with electroosmotic pumping driven by umol/L ion concentrations\nin the sample cell that serve as 'fuel' to the pump. Our study thus reveals\nthat trace amounts of charge carriers can produce surprisingly strong fluid\nflows; an insight that should benefit the design of a new class of microfluidic\npumps that operate at very low fuel concentrations.\n", "  The well-known equation for hydrostatic equilibrium in a static spherically\nsymmetric spacetime supported by an isotropic perfect fluid is referred to as\nthe Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) equation or the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)\nequation in various General Relativity textbooks or research papers. We\nscrutinize the relevant original publications to argue that the former is the\nmore appropriate terminology.\n", "  One outstanding problem in the physics of glassy solids is understanding the\nstatistics and properties of the low-energy excitations that stem from the\ndisorder that characterizes these systems' microstructure. In this work we\nintroduce a family of algebraic equations whose solutions represent collective\ndisplacement directions (modes) in the multi-dimensional configuration space of\na structural glass. We explain why solutions of the algebraic equations, coined\nnonlinear glassy modes, are quasi-localized low-energy excitations. We present\nan iterative method to solve the algebraic equations, and use it to study the\nenergetic and structural properties of a selected subset of their solutions\nconstructed by starting from a normal mode analysis of the potential energy of\na model glass. Our key result is that the structure and energies associated\nwith harmonic glassy vibrational modes and their nonlinear counterparts\nconverge in the limit of very low frequencies. As nonlinear modes never suffer\nhybridizations, our result implies that the presented theoretical framework\nconstitutes a robust alternative definition of `soft glassy modes' in the\nthermodynamic limit, in which Goldstone modes overwhelm and destroy the\nidentity of low-frequency harmonic glassy modes.\n", "  We report on dual-gate reflectometry in a metal-oxide-semiconductor\ndouble-gate silicon transistor operating at low temperature as a double quantum\ndot device. The reflectometry setup consists of two radio-frequency resonators\nrespectively connected to the two gate electrodes. By simultaneously measuring\ntheir dispersive response, we obtain the complete charge stability diagram of\nthe device. Charge transitions between the two quantum dots and between each\nquantum dot and either the source or the drain contact are detected through\nphase shifts in the reflected radio-frequency signals. At finite bias,\nreflectometry allows probing charge transitions to excited quantum-dot states\nthereby enabling direct access to the energy level spectra of the quantum dots.\nInterestingly, we find that in the presence of charge transport across the two\ndots the reflectometry signatures of interdot transitions display a dip-peak\nstructure containing quantitative information on the charge relaxation rates in\nthe double quantum dot.\n", "  Topological phase imprinting is a well-established technique for\ndeterministic vortex creation in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of alkali\nmetal atoms. It was recently shown that counter-diabatic quantum control may\naccelerate vortex creation in comparison to the standard adiabatic protocol and\nsuppress the atom loss due to nonadiabatic transitions. Here we apply this\ntechnique, assisted by an optical plug, for vortex pumping to theoretically\nshow that sequential phase imprinting up to 20 cycles generates a vortex with a\nvery large winding number. Our method significantly increases the fidelity of\nthe pump for rapid pumping compared to the case without the counter-diabatic\ncontrol, leading to the highest angular momentum per particle reported to date\nfor the vortex pump. Our studies are based on numerical integration of the\nthree-dimensional multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation which conveniently\nyields the density profiles, phase profiles, angular momentum, and other\nphysically important quantities of the spin-1 system. Our results motivate the\nexperimental realization of the vortex pump and studies of the rich physics it\ninvolves.\n", "  We study the effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the charge and\nspin degrees of freedom of a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Wigner crystal.\nAs electrons in a quasi-1D Wigner crystal can move in the transverse direction,\nSOC cannot be gauged away in contrast to the pure 1D case. We show that for\nweak SOC, a partial gap in the spectrum opens at certain ratios between density\nof electrons and the inverse Rashba length. We present how the low-energy\nbranch of charge degrees of freedom deviates due to SOC from its usual linear\ndependence at small wave vectors. In the case of strong SOC, we show that spin\nsector of a Wigner crystal cannot be described by an isotropic\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian any more, and that instead the ground\nstate of neighboring electrons is mostly a triplet state. We present a new spin\nsector Hamiltonian and discuss the spectrum of Wigner crystal in this limit.\n", "  Brownian clocks are biomolecular networks that can count time. A paradigmatic\nexample are proteins that go through a cycle thus regulating some oscillatory\nbehaviour in a living system. Typically, such a cycle requires free energy\noften provided by ATP hydrolysis. We investigate the relation between the\nprecision of such a clock and its thermodynamic costs. For clocks driven by a\nconstant thermodynamic force, a given precision requires a minimal cost that\ndiverges as the uncertainty of the clock vanishes. In marked contrast, we show\nthat a clock driven by a periodic variation of an external protocol can achieve\narbitrary precision at arbitrarily low cost. This result constitutes a\nfundamental difference between processes driven by a fixed thermodynamic force\nand those driven periodically. As a main technical tool, we map a periodically\ndriven system with a deterministic protocol to one subject to an external\nprotocol that changes in stochastic time intervals, which simplifies\ncalculations significantly. In the non-equilibrium steady state of the\nresulting bipartite Markov process, the uncertainty of the clock can be deduced\nfrom the calculable dispersion of a corresponding current.\n", "  We calculate the dislocation glide mobility in solid $^4$He within a model\nthat assumes the existence of a superfluid field associated with dislocation\nlines. Prompted by the results of this mobility calculation, we study within\nthis model the role that such a superfluid field may play in the motion of the\ndislocation line when a stress is applied to the crystal. To do this, we relate\nthe damping of dislocation motion, calculated in the presence of the assumed\nsuperfluid field, to the shear modulus of the crystal. As the temperature\nincreases, we find that a sharp drop in the shear modulus will occur at the\ntemperature where the superfluid field disappears. We compare the drop in shear\nmodulus of the crystal arising from the temperature dependence of the damping\ncontribution due to the superfluid field, to the experimental observation of\nthe same phenomena in solid $^4$He and find quantitative agreement. Our results\nindicate that such a superfluid field plays an important role in dislocation\npinning in a clean solid $^4$He at low temperatures and in this regime may\nprovide an alternative source for the unusual elastic phenomena observed in\nsolid $^4$He.\n", "  Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) are at the heart of the second-generation\nDensity Matrix Renormalisation Group (DMRG) algorithm formulated in Matrix\nProduct State language. We first summarise the widely known facts on MPO\narithmetic and representations of single-site operators. Second, we introduce\nthree compression methods (Rescaled SVD, Deparallelisation and Delinearisation)\nfor MPOs and show that it is possible to construct efficient representations of\narbitrary operators using MPO arithmetic and compression. As examples, we\nconstruct powers of a short-ranged spin-chain Hamiltonian, a complicated\nHamiltonian of a two-dimensional system and, as proof of principle, the\nlong-range four-body Hamiltonian from quantum chemistry.\n", "  A gauge condition is presented here to quantize non-Abelian gauge theory on\nthe manifold $R\\otimes S^{1}\\otimes S^{1}\\otimes S^{1}$, which is free from the\nGribov ambiguity. Perturbative calculations in the new gauge behave like the\naxial gauge in ultraviolet region, while infrared behaviours of the\nperturbative series are quite nontrivial. The new gauge condition, which reads\n$n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot A=0$, may not satisfy the requirement that\n$A^{\\mu}(\\infty)=0$ in conventional perturbative calculations. However, such\ncontradiction is not harmful for gauge theories constructed on the manifold\n$R\\otimes S^{1}\\otimes S^{1}\\otimes S^{1}$.\n", "  We design a search strategy for the Standard Model $t\\bar t t \\bar t$\nproduction at the LHC in the same-sign dilepton and trilepton channels. We\nstudy different signal features and, given the small expected number of signal\nevents, we scrutinize in detail all reducible and irreducible backgrounds. Our\nanalysis shows that by imposing a set of basic jet and lepton selection\ncriteria, the SM $pp \\to t\\bar t t \\bar t$ process could be evidenced in the\nnear future, within Run-II, when combining both multi-lepton search channels.\nWe argue that this search strategy should also be used as a guideline to test\nNew Physics coupling predominantly to top-quarks. In particular, we show that a\nnon-resonant New Physics enhancement in the four-top final state would be\ndetectable through this search strategy. We study two {\\it top-philic}\nsimplified models of this kind, a neutral scalar boson and a $Z^\\prime$, and\npresent current and future exclusion limits on their mass and couplings.\n", "  We report the design and test results of a beam monitor developed for online\nmonitoring in hadron therapy. The beam monitor uses eight silicon pixel\nsensors, \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$}, as the anode array.\n\\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} is a charge sensor designed in a CMOS 0.35 $\\mu$m\ntechnology. Each \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} sensor has $72\\times72$ pixels and\nthe pixel size is $83\\times83$ $\\mu$m$^2$. In our design, the beam passes\nthrough the beam monitor without hitting the electrodes, making the beam\nmonitor especially suitable for monitoring heavy ion beams. This design also\nreduces radiation damage to the beam monitor itself. The beam monitor is tested\nwith a carbon ion beam at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL).\nResults indicate that the beam monitor can measure position, incidence angle\nand intensity of the beam with a position resolution better than 20 $\\mu$m,\nangular resolution about 0.5$^\\circ$ and intensity statistical accuracy better\nthan 2$\\%$.\n", "  We present a novel approach to the analysis of a full model of scalar\nmodulation instability (MI) by means of a simple geometrical description in the\npower vs. frequency plane. This formulation allows to relate the shape of the\nMI gain to any arbitrary dispersion profile of the medium. As a result, we\nderive a straightforward explanation of the non-trivial dependence of the\ncutoff power on high-order dispersion and obtain explicitly the power that\nmaximizes the gain. Our approach puts forth a powerful tool to synthesize a\ndesired MI gain with the potential application to a vast number of\nparametric-amplification and supercontinuum-generation devices whose\nfunctioning relies upon modulation instability.\n", "  Many young star clusters appear to be fractal, i.e. they appear to be\nconcentrated in a nested hierarchy of clusters within clusters. We present a\nnew algorithm for statistically analysing the distribution of stars to quantify\nthe level of sub-structure. We suggest that, even at the simplest level, the\ninternal structure of a fractal cluster requires the specification of three\nparameters. (i) The 3D fractal dimension, $\\mathcal{D}$, measures the extent to\nwhich the clusters on one level of the nested hierarchy fill the volume of\ntheir parent cluster. (ii) The number of levels, $\\mathcal{L}$, reflects the\nfinite ratio between the linear size of the large root-cluster at the top of\nthe hierarchy, and the smallest leaf-clusters at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n(iii) The volume-density scaling exponent, $\\mathcal{C}=-\\textrm{d}\\ln[\\delta\nn]/\\textrm{d}\\ln[L]$ measures the factor by which the excess density, $\\delta\nn$, in a structure of scale $L$, exceeds that of the background formed by\nlarger structures; it is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the exponent\nin Larson's scaling relation between density and size for molecular clouds. We\ndescribe an algorithm which can be used to constrain the values of $({\\cal\nD},{\\cal L},{\\cal C})$ and apply this method to artificial and observed\nclusters. We show that this algorithm is able to reliably describe the three\ndimensional structure of an artificial star cluster from the two dimensional\nprojection, and quantify the varied structures observed in real and simulated\nclusters.\n", "  Judging the significance and reproducibility of quantitative research\nrequires a good understanding of relevant uncertainties, but it is often\nunclear how well these have been evaluated and what they imply. Reported\nscientific uncertainties were studied by analysing 41000 measurements of 3200\nquantities from medicine, nuclear and particle physics, and interlaboratory\ncomparisons ranging from chemistry to toxicology. Outliers are common, with\n5{\\sigma} disagreements up to five orders of magnitude more frequent than\nnaively expected. Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple\nmeasurements of the same quantity are consistent with heavy-tailed Student-t\ndistributions that are often almost Cauchy, far from a Gaussian Normal bell\ncurve. Medical research uncertainties are generally as well evaluated as those\nin physics, but physics uncertainty improves more rapidly, making feasible\nsimple significance criteria such as the 5{\\sigma} discovery convention in\nparticle physics. Contributions to measurement uncertainty from mistakes and\nunknown problems are not completely unpredictable. Such errors appear to have\npower-law distributions consistent with how designed complex systems fail, and\nhow unknown systematic errors are constrained by researchers. This better\nunderstanding may help improve analysis and meta-analysis of data, and help\nscientists and the public have more realistic expectations of what scientific\nresults imply.\n", "  We study the matter effect caused by nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI)\nin the next generation long-baseline neutrino experiments, DUNE, T2HK and\nT2HKK. If multiple NSI parameters are nonzero, the potential of these\nexperiments to detect CP violation, determine the mass hierarchy and constrain\nNSI is severely impaired by degeneracies between the NSI parameters and by the\ngeneralized mass hierarchy degeneracy. In particular, a cancellation between\nleading order terms in the appearance channels when $\\epsilon_{e\\tau} =\n\\cot\\theta_{23} \\epsilon_{e\\mu}$, strongly affects the sensitivities to these\ntwo NSI parameters at T2HK and T2HKK. We also study the dependence of the\nsensitivities on the true CP phase $\\delta$ and the true mass hierarchy, and\nfind that overall DUNE has the best sensitivity to the magnitude of the NSI\nparameters, while T2HKK has the best sensitivity to CP violation whether or not\nthere are NSI. Furthermore, for T2HKK a smaller off-axis angle for the Korean\ndetector is better overall. We find that due to the structure of the leading\norder terms in the appearance channel probabilities, the NSI sensitivities in a\ngiven experiment are similar for both mass hierarchies, modulo the phase change\n$\\delta \\to \\delta + 180^\\circ$.\n", "  Recent technological advances in optical atomic clocks are opening new\nperspectives for the direct determination of geopotential differences between\nany two points at a centimeter-level accuracy in geoid height. However, so far\ndetailed quantitative estimates of the possible improvement in geoid\ndetermination when adding such clock measurements to existing data are lacking.\nWe present a first step in that direction with the aim and hope of triggering\nfurther work and efforts in this emerging field of chronometric geodesy and\ngeophysics. We specifically focus on evaluating the contribution of this new\nkind of direct measurements in determining the geopotential at high spatial\nresolution (~ 10 km). We studied two test areas, both located in France and\ncorresponding to a middle (Massif Central) and high (Alps) mountainous terrain.\nThese regions are interesting because the gravitational field strength varies\ngreatly from place to place at high spatial resolution due to the complex\ntopography. Our method consists in first generating a synthetic high resolution\ngeopotential map, then drawing synthetic measurement data (gravimetry and clock\ndata) from it, and finally reconstructing the geopotential map from that data\nusing least squares collocation. The quality of the reconstructed map is then\nassessed by comparing it to the original one used to generate the data. We show\nthat adding only a few clock data points (less than 1 % of the gravimetry data)\nreduces the bias significantly and improves the standard deviation by a factor\n3. The effect of the data coverage and data quality on the results is\ninvestigated, and the trade-off between the measurement noise level and the\nnumber of data points is discussed.\n", "  The first 1.1 mm continuum survey toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) was\nperformed using the AzTEC instrument installed on the ASTE 10-m telescope. This\nsurvey covered 4.5 deg$^2$ of the SMC with $1\\sigma$ noise levels of $5-12$ mJy\nbeam$^{-1}$, and 44 extended objects were identified. The 1.1 mm extended\nemission has good spatial correlation with $Herschel$ 160 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$,\nindicating that the origin of the 1.1 mm extended emission is thermal emission\nfrom a cold dust component. We estimated physical properties using the 1.1 mm\nand filtered $Herschel$ data (100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$).\nThe 1.1 mm objects show dust temperatures of $17-45$ K and gas masses of\n$4\\times10^3-3\\times10^5~M_\\odot$, assuming single-temperature thermal emission\nfrom the cold dust with an emissivity index, $\\beta$, of 1.2 and a gas-to-dust\nratio of 1000. These physical properties are very similar to those of giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) in our galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The 1.1\nmm objects also displayed good spatial correlation with the $Spitzer$ 24\n$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ and CO emission, suggesting that the 1.1 mm objects trace the\ndense gas regions as sites of massive star formation. The dust temperature of\nthe 1.1 mm objects also demonstrated good correlation with the 24 $\\mathrm{\\mu\nm}$ flux connected to massive star formation. This supports the hypothesis that\nthe heating source of the cold dust is mainly local star-formation activity in\nthe 1.1 mm objects. The classification of the 1.1 mm objects based on the\nexistence of star-formation activity reveals the differences in the dust\ntemperature, gas mass, and radius, which reflects the evolution sequence of\nGMCs.\n", "  We calculate the T-matrices of kaon-nucleon ($KN$) and antikaon-nucleon\n($\\overline{K}N$) scattering to one-loop order in SU(3) heavy baryon chiral\nperturbation theory (HB$\\chi$PT). The low-energy constants (LECs) and their\ncombinations are then determined by fitting the phase shifts of $KN$ scattering\nand the corresponding data. This leads to a good description of the phase\nshifts below 200 MeV kaon laboratory momentum. We obtain the LEC uncertainties\nthrough statistical regression analysis. We also determine the LECs through the\nuse of scattering lengths in order to check the consistency of the HB$\\chi$PT\nframework for different observables and obtain a consistent result. By using\nthese LECs, we predict the $\\overline{K}N$ elastic scattering phase shifts and\nobtain reasonable results. The scattering lengths are also predicted, which\nturn out to be in good agreement with the empirical values except for the\nisospin-0 $\\overline{K}N$ scattering length that is strongly affected by the\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ resonance. As most calculations in the chiral perturbation\ntheory, the convergence issue is discussed in detail. Our calculations provide\na possibility to investigate the baryon-baryon interaction in HB$\\chi$PT.\n", "  We benchmark various available event generators in Geant4 and EGS5 in the\nlight of ongoing projects for high angular-resolution pair-conversion\ntelescopes. We compare the distributions of key kinematic variables extracted\nfrom the geometry of the three final state particles. We validate and use as\nreference an exact generator using the full 5D differential cross-section of\nthe conversion process. We focus in particular on the effect of the unmeasured\nrecoiling nucleus on the angular resolution. We show that for high resolution\ntrackers, the choice of the generator affects the estimated resolution of the\ntelescope. We also show that the current available generator are unable to\ndescribe accurately a linearly polarised photon source.\n", "  The Skyrme model provides a novel unified approach to nuclear physics. In\nthis approach, single baryon, baryonic matter and medium-modified hadron\nproperties are treated on the same footing. Intrinsic density dependence (IDD)\nreflecting the change of vacuum by compressed baryonic matter figures naturally\nin the approach. In this article, we review the recent progress on accessing\ndense nuclear matter by putting baryons treated as solitons, namely, skyrmions,\non crystal lattice with accents on the implications in compact stars.\n", "  We establish quantitative estimates on the structure function arising in the\nrepresentation of the intertwining wave operators of a Schroedinger operator in\nthree dimensions. Regularity of zero energy is assumed throughout. This paper\nis related to, and corrects some inaccuracies in, the first author's work\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0502\n", "  This work addresses the one-dimensional problem of Bloch electrons when they\nare rapidly driven by a homogeneous time-periodic light and linearly coupled to\nvibrational modes. Starting from a generic time-periodic electron-phonon\nHamiltonian, we derive a time-independent effective Hamiltonian that describes\nthe stroboscopic dynamics up to the third order in the high-frequency limit.\nThis yields nonequilibrium corrections to the electron-phonon coupling that are\ncontrollable dynamically via the driving strength. This shows in particular\nthat local Holstein interactions in equilibrium are corrected by nonlocal\nPeierls interactions out of equilibrium, as well as by phonon-assisted hopping\nprocesses that make the dynamical Wannier-Stark localization of Bloch electrons\nimpossible. Subsequently, we revisit the Holstein polaron problem out of\nequilibrium in terms of effective Green functions, and specify explicitly how\nthe binding energy and effective mass of the polaron can be controlled\ndynamically. These tunable properties are reported within the weak- and\nstrong-coupling regimes since both can be visited within the same material when\nvarying the driving strength. This work provides some insight into controllable\nmicroscopic mechanisms that may be involved during the multicycle laser\nirradiations of organic molecular crystals in ultrafast pump-probe experiments,\nalthough it should also be suitable for realizations in shaken optical lattices\nof ultracold atoms.\n", "  Massive and diffuse haloes of hot gas (coronae) are important intermediaries\nbetween cosmology and galaxy evolution, storing mass and angular momentum\nacquired from the cosmic web until eventual accretion on to star-forming discs.\nWe introduce a method to reconstruct the rotation of a galactic corona, based\non its angular momentum distribution (AMD). This allows us to investigate in\nwhat conditions the angular momentum acquired from tidal torques can be\ntransferred to star forming discs and explain observed galaxy-scale processes,\nsuch as inside-out growth and the build-up of abundance gradients. We find that\na simple model of an isothermal corona with a temperature slightly smaller than\nvirial and a cosmologically motivated AMD is in good agreement with galaxy\nevolution requirements, supporting hot-mode accretion as a viable driver for\nthe evolution of spiral galaxies in a cosmological context. We predict\nmoderately sub-centrifugal rotation close to the disc and slow rotation close\nto the virial radius. Motivated by the observation that the Milky Way has a\nrelatively hot corona (T ~ 2 x 10^6 K), we also explore models with a\ntemperature larger than virial. To be able to drive inside-out growth, these\nmodels must be significantly affected by feedback, either mechanical (ejection\nof low angular momentum material) or thermal (heating of the central regions).\nHowever, the agreement with galaxy evolution constraints becomes, in these\ncases, only marginal, suggesting that our first and simpler model may apply to\na larger fraction of galaxy evolution history.\n", "  We report on calculations of harmonic generation by neon in a mixed (800-nm +\ntime-delayed 400-nm) laser pulse scheme. In contrast with previous studies we\nemploy a short (few-cycle) 400-nm pulse, finding that this affords control of\nthe interference between electron trajectories contributing to the cutoff\nharmonics. The inclusion of the 400-nm pulse enhances the yield and cutoff\nenergy, both of which exhibit a strong dependence on the time delay between the\ntwo pulses. Using a combination of time-dependent R-matrix theory and a\nclassical trajectory model, we assess the mechanisms leading to these effects.\n", "  A novel instantaneous GNSS ambiguity resolution approach which makes use of\nonly single-frequency carrier phase measurements for ultra-short baseline\nattitude determination is proposed. The Monte Carlo sampling method is employed\nto obtain the probability density function of ambiguities from a\nquaternion-based GNSS-attitude model and the LAMBDA method strengthened with a\nscreening mechanism is then utilized to fix the integer values. Experimental\nresults show that 100% success rate could be achieved for ultra-short\nbaselines.\n", "  We discuss the reception of Copernican astronomy by the Proven\\c{c}al\nhumanists of the XVIth-XVIIth centuries, beginning with Michel de Montaigne who\nwas the first to recognize the potential scientific and philosophical\nrevolution represented by heliocentrism. Then we describe how, after Kepler's\nAstronomia Nova of 1609 and the first telescopic observations by Galileo, it\nwas in the south of France that the New Astronomy found its main promotors with\nthe humanists and \"amateurs \\'eclair\\'es\", Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc and\nPierre Gassendi. The professional astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini, also from\nProvence, would later elevate the field to new heights in Paris.\n", "  Water electrolysis performed in microsystems with a fast change of voltage\npolarity produces optically invisible nanobubbles containing H2 and O2 gases.\nIn this form the gases are able to the reverse reaction of water formation.\nHere we report extreme phenomena observed in a millimeter-sized open system.\nUnder a frequency of driving pulses above 100 kHz the process is accompanied by\nclicking sounds repeated every 50 ms or so. Fast video reveals that\nsynchronously with the click a bubble is growing between the electrodes which\nreaches a size of 300 um in 50 us. Detailed dynamics of the system is monitored\nby means of a vibrometer by observing a piece of silicon floating above the\nelectrodes. The energy of a single event is estimated as 0.3 uJ and a\nsignificant part of this energy is transformed into mechanical work moving the\npiece. The observations are explained by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen\nmixture in the initial bubble with a diameter of about 40 um. Unusual\ncombustion mechanism supporting spontaneous ignition at room temperature is\nresponsible for the process. The observed effect demonstrates a principal\npossibility to build a microscopic internal combustion engine.\n", "  A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph is a matrix-valued function\n$\\exp(-\\mathtt{i} At)$ over the reals, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the\ngraph. Such a quantum walk has universal perfect state transfer if for all\nvertices $u,v$, there is a time where the $(v,u)$ entry of the matrix\nexponential has unit magnitude. We prove new characterizations of graphs with\nuniversal perfect state transfer. This extends results of Cameron et al.\n(Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 455:115-142, 2014). Also, we construct\nnon-circulant families of graphs with universal perfect state transfer. All\nprior known constructions were circulants. Moreover, we prove that if a\ncirculant, whose order is prime, prime squared, or a power of two, has\nuniversal perfect state transfer then its underlying graph must be complete.\nThis is nearly tight since there are universal perfect state transfer\ncirculants with non-prime-power order where some edges are missing.\n", "  One of the biggest puzzles concerning the cuprate high temperature\nsuperconductors is what determines the maximum transition temperature (Tc,max),\nwhich varies from less than 30 K to above 130 K in different compounds. Despite\nthis dramatic variation, a robust trend is that within each family, the\ndouble-layer compound always has higher Tc,max than the single-layer\ncounterpart. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the\nelectronic structure of four cuprate parent compounds belonging to two\ndifferent families. We find that within each family, the double layer compound\nhas a much smaller charge transfer gap size ($\\Delta_{CT}$), indicating a clear\nanticorrelation between $\\Delta_{CT}$ and Tc,max. These results suggest that\nthe charge transfer gap plays a key role in the superconducting physics of\ncuprates, which shed important new light on the high Tc mechanism from doped\nMott insulator perspective.\n", "  From the Schwarzschild metric we obtain the higher-order terms (up to 20-th\norder) for the deflection of light around a massive object using the\nLindstedt-Poincar\\'e method to solve the equation of motion of a photon around\nthe stellar object. Additionally, we obtain diagonal Pad\\'e approximants from\nthe perturbation expansion, and we show how these are a better fit for the\nnumerical data. Furthermore, we use these approximants in ray-tracing\nalgorithms to model the bending of light around the massive object.\n", "  [Abridged] We present spectroscopic observations in H$_{2}$O, CO and related\nspecies with \\textit{Herschel} HIFI and PACS, as well as ground-based follow-up\nwith the JCMT and APEX in CO, HCO$^{+}$ and isotopologues, of a sample of 49\nnearby ($d<$500\\,pc) candidate protostars. These data are used to study the\noutflow and envelope properties of these sources. We also compile their\ncontinuum SEDs in order to constrain their physical properties. Water emission\nis dominated by shocks associated with the outflow, rather than the cooler,\nslower entrained outflowing gas probed by ground-based CO observations. These\nshocks become less energetic as sources evolve from Class 0 to Class I. The\nfraction of mass in the outflow relative to the total envelope (i.e.\n$M_{\\mathrm{out}}/M_{\\mathrm{env}}$) remains broadly constant between Class 0\nand I. The median value ($\\sim$1$\\%$) is consistent with a core to star\nformation efficiency on the order of 50$\\%$ and an outflow duty cycle on the\norder of 5$\\%$. Entrainment efficiency, as probed by\n$F_{\\mathrm{CO}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, is also invariant with source\nproperties and evolutionary stage. The median value (6.3\\kms{}) suggests an\nentrainment efficiency of between 30 and 60$\\%$ if the wind is launched at\n$\\sim$1AU. $L$[O\\,{\\sc i}] is strongly correlated with $L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ but\nnot with $M_{\\mathrm{env}}$, while low-$J$ CO is more closely correlated with\nthe latter than the former. This suggests that [O\\,{\\sc i}] traces the\npresent-day accretion activity while CO traces time-averaged accretion over the\ndynamical timescale of the outflow. $L$[O\\,{\\sc i}] does not vary from Class 0\nto Class I, unlike CO and H$_{2}$O. This is likely due to the ratio of atomic\nto molecular gas in the wind increasing as the source evolves, balancing out\nthe decrease in mass accretion rate. Infall signatures are detected in\nHCO$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$O in a few sources.\n", "  The continuity of the gauge fixing condition $n\\cdot\\partial n\\cdot A=0$ for\n$SU(2)$ gauge theory on the manifold $R\\bigotimes S^{1}\\bigotimes\nS^{1}\\bigotimes S^{1}$ is studied here, where $n^{\\mu}$ stands for directional\nvector along $x_{i}$-axis($i=1,2,3$). It is proved that the gauge fixing\ncondition is continuous given that gauge potentials are differentiable with\ncontinuous derivatives on the manifold $R\\bigotimes S^{1}\\bigotimes\nS^{1}\\bigotimes S^{1}$ which is compact.\n", "  Various novel physical properties have emerged in Dirac electronic systems,\nespecially the topological characters protected by symmetry. Current studies on\nthese systems have been greatly promoted by the intuitive concepts of Berry\nphase and Berry curvature, which provide precise definitions of the topological\norders. In this topical review, transport properties of topological insulator\n(Bi2Se3), topological Dirac semimetal (Cd3As2) and topological\ninsulator-graphene heterojunction are presented and discussed. Perspectives\nabout transport properties of two-dimensional topological nontrivial systems,\nincluding topological edge transport, topological valley transport and\ntopological Weyl semimetals, are provided.\n", "  The Jefferson Lab facilities have undergone a substantial upgrade, both of\naccelerator, CEBAF, and of the experimental installations. We will discuss the\nprogress to completion of these facilities, the status of accelerator\ncommissioning, and the recent first operations for physics. We will then flesh\nout the anticipated exciting physics program of the next several years.\n", "  Radiative alpha-capture, ($\\alpha,\\gamma$), reactions play a critical role in\nnucleosynthesis and nuclear energy generation in a variety of astrophysical\nenvironments. The St. George recoil separator at the University of Notre Dame's\nNuclear Science Laboratory was developed to measure ($\\alpha,\\gamma$) reactions\nin inverse kinematics via recoil detection in order to obtain nuclear reaction\ncross sections at the low energies of astrophysical interest, while avoiding\nthe $\\gamma$-background that plagues traditional measurement techniques. Due to\nthe $\\gamma$-ray produced by the nuclear reaction at the target location,\nrecoil nuclei are produced with a variety of energies and angles, all of which\nmust be accepted by St. George in order to accurately determine the reaction\ncross section. We demonstrate the energy acceptance of the St. George recoil\nseparator using primary beams of helium, hydrogen, neon, and oxygen, spanning\nthe magnetic and electric rigidity phase space populated by recoils of\nanticipated ($\\alpha,\\gamma$) reaction measurements. We found the performance\nof St. George meets the design specifications, demonstrating its suitability\nfor ($\\alpha,\\gamma$) reaction measurements of astrophysical interest.\n", "  A five-dimensional coupled states (5D-CS) approximation is used to compute\ncross sections and rate coefficients for CO+H2 collisions. The 5D-CS\ncalculations are benchmarked against accurate six-dimensional close-coupling\n(6D-CC) calculations for transitions between low-lying rovibrational states.\nGood agreement between the two formulations is found for collision energies\ngreater than 10 cm-1. The 5D-CS approximation is then used to compute two\nseparate databases which include highly excited states of CO that are beyond\nthe practical limitations of the 6D-CC method. The first database assumes an\ninternally frozen H2 molecule and allows rovibrational transitions for v < 5\nand j < 30, where v and j are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of\nthe initial state of the CO molecule. The second database allows H2 rotational\ntransitions for initial CO states with v < 5 and j < 10. The two databases are\nin good agreement with each other for transitions that are common to both basis\nsets. Together they provide data for astrophysical models which were previously\nunavailable.\n", "  We theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate a procedure for\nconditional control and enhancement of an interferometric coupling between two\nqubits encoded into states of bosonic particles. Our procedure combines local\ncoupling of one of the particles to an auxiliary mode and single-qubit quantum\nfiltering. We experimentally verify the proposed procedure using a linear\noptical setup where qubits are encoded into quantum states of single photons\nand coupled at a beam splitter with a fixed transmittance. With our protocol,\nwe implement a range of different effective transmittances, demonstrate both\nenhancement and reduction of the coupling strength, and observe dependence of\ntwo-photon bunching on the effective transmittance. To make our analysis\ncomplete, we also theoretically investigate a more general scheme where each\nparticle is coupled to a separate auxiliary mode and show that this latter\nscheme enables to achieve higher implementation probability. We show that our\napproach can be extended also to other kinds of qubit-qubit interactions.\n", "  A refined equation for channe;ing particle diffusion in transverse energy\ntaking into consideration large-angle scattering by nuclei is suggested. This\nequation is reduced to the Sturm-Liouville problem allowing one to reveal both\nthe origin and the limitations of the dechanneling length notion. The values of\nthe latter is evaluated for both positively and negatively charged particles of\nvarious energies. It is also demonstrated that the dechanneling length notion\nis inapplicable for the nuclear dechanneling process of positively charged\nparticles, while the effective electron dechanneling length of the latter vary\nmore than twice converging to a constant assymptotic value at the depth\nexceeding the latter.\n", "  This work introduces a new concept of Chinese-Magic-Box. The general idea is\nto have a box such that the sender can store information in multiple drawers.\nThe receiver is free to open any drawer. However, once the receiver opens the\ndrawer, he can retrieve the information from that drawer only, that is, the\ninformation that was stored in the other drawers is lost. This property is\nachieved by storing the information using a set of non-orthogonal quantum\nstates. The different drawers are realized by different orthogonal set of basis\nfor the measurement. Once the measurement is performed, the information in this\nbasis is retrieved. At the same time, due to wave function collapse the\ninformation in the other basis is lost and cannot be retrieved. I show how to\nconstruct a set of states for a single qubit to implement a Box with two or\nthree drawers. Some applications are discussed. Among them is a new\nnon-symmetric Quantum Key Distribution with only single direction classical\ncommunication.\n", "  We introduce stochastic Interaction-Round-a-Face (IRF) models that are\nrelated to representations of the elliptic quantum group $E_{\\tau,\\eta}(sl_2)$.\nFor stochasic IRF models in a quadrant, we evaluate averages for a broad family\nof observables that can be viewed as higher analogs of $q$-moments of the\nheight function for the stochastic (higher spin) six vertex models.\n  In a certain limit, the stochastic IRF models degenerate to (1+1)d\ninteracting particle systems that we call dynamic ASEP and SSEP; their jump\nrates depend on local values of the height function. For the step initial\ncondition, we evaluate averages of observables for them as well, and use those\nto investigate one-point asymptotics of the dynamic SSEP.\n  The construction and proofs are based on remarkable properties (branching and\nPieri rules, Cauchy identities) of a (seemingly new) family of symmetric\nelliptic functions that arise as matrix elements in an infinite volume limit of\nthe algebraic Bethe ansatz for $E_{\\tau,\\eta}(sl_2)$.\n", "  We present a sample of cataclysmic variables (CVs) identified among the X-ray\nsources from the 400 square degree X-ray survey based on ROSAT pointing data\n(400d). The procedure of the CV selection among the X-ray sources using\nadditional optical and infrared data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and WISE\nsurvey is described. The results of the optical observations of the selected\nobjects carried out mainly with the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT-150)\nand the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian\nAcademy of Sciences (BTA) are presented. Some observations have also been\nperformed with the Sayan Observatory 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope. Currently we\nselected eight CVs, four of which were found for the first time in our work.\nBased on this sample, we have obtained preliminary constraints on the CV X-ray\nluminosity function in the solar neighborhood in the low luminosity range, L_X\n~ 10^29-10^30 erg s^-1 (0.5-2 keV). We show that the logarithmic slope of the\nCV X-ray luminosity function in this luminosity range is less steep than at L_X\n> 10^31 erg s^-1. From our CV X-ray luminosity function estimates it follows\nthat few thousand CVs will be detected in theSpectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)\nobservatory all-sky X-ray survey at high Galactic latitudes, which will allow\nto obtain much more accurate measurements of CV X-ray luminosity function in\nthe luminosity range L_X < 10^30-10^31 erg s^-1.\n", "  Within the framework of self-adjoint operator of time in non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics the equation describing change of the state of quantum system\nwith respect to energy is introduced. The operator of time appears to be the\ngenerator of the change of energy while the operator of energy, that is\nconjugate to the operator of time, generates time evolution in this proposal.\nTwo examples, one with discrete time and the other with continuous one, are\ngiven and the generalization of Schroedinger equation is proposed.\n", "  NGC 1313 is a bulgeless nearby galaxy, classified as SB(s)d. Its proximity\nallows high spatial resolution observations. We performed the first detailed\nanalysis of the emission-line properties in the nuclear region of NGC 1313,\nusing an optical data cube obtained with the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph.\nWe detected four main emitting areas, three of them (regions 1, 2 and 3) having\nspectra typical of H II regions. Region 1 is located very close to the stellar\nnucleus and shows broad spectral features characteristic of Wolf-Rayet stars.\nOur analysis revealed the presence of one or two WC4-5 stars in this region,\nwhich is compatible with results obtained by previous studies. Region 4 shows\nspectral features (as a strong H$\\alpha$ emission line, with a broad component)\ntypical of a massive emission-line star, such as a luminous blue variable, a\nB[e] supergiant or a B hypergiant. The radial velocity map of the ionized gas\nshows a pattern consistent with rotation. A significant drop in the values of\nthe gas velocity dispersion was detected very close to region 1, which suggests\nthat the young stars there were formed from this cold gas, possibly keeping low\nvalues of velocity dispersion. Therefore, although detailed measurements of the\nstellar kinematics were not possible (due to the weak stellar absorption\nspectrum of this galaxy), we predict that NGC 1313 may also show a drop in the\nvalues of the stellar velocity dispersion in its nuclear region.\n", "  We report transport mobility measurements for clean, two-dimensional (2D)\nelectron systems confined to GaAs quantum wells (QWs), grown via molecular beam\nepitaxy, in two families of structures, a standard, symmetrically-doped GaAs\nset of QWs with Al$_{0.32}$Ga$_{0.68}$As barriers, and one with additional AlAs\ncladding surrounding the QWs. Our results indicate that the mobility in narrow\nQWs with no cladding is consistent with existing theoretical calculations where\ninterface roughness effects are softened by the penetration of the electron\nwave function into the adjacent low barriers. In contrast, data from AlAs-clad\nwells show a number of samples where the 2D electron mobility is severely\nlimited by interface roughness. These measurements across three orders of\nmagnitude in mobility provide a road map of reachable mobilities in the growth\nof GaAs structures of different electron densities, well widths, and barrier\nheights.\n", "  According to Landauer's principle, erasure of information is the only part of\na computation process that unavoidably involves energy dissipation. If done\nreversibly, such an erasure generates the minimal heat of $k_BT\\ln 2$ per\nerased bit of information. The goal of this work is to discuss the actual\nreversal of the optimal erasure which can serve as the basis for the Maxwell's\ndemon operating with ultimate thermodynamic efficiency as dictated by the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. The demon extracts $k_BT\\ln 2$ of heat from an\nequilibrium reservoir at temperature $T$ per one bit of information obtained\nabout the measured system used by the demon. We have analyzed this Maxwell's\ndemon in the situation when it uses a general quantum system with a discrete\nspectrum of energy levels as its working body. In the case of the effectively\ntwo-level system, which has been realized experimentally based on tunneling of\nindividual electron in a single-electron box [J.V. Koski et al., PNAS 111,\n13786 (2014)], we also studied and minimized corrections to the ideal\nreversible operation of the demon. These corrections include, in particular,\nthe non-adiabatic terms which are described by a version of the classical\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem. The overall reversibility of the Maxwell's\ndemon requires, beside the reversibility of the intrinsic working body\ndynamics, the reversibility of the measurement and feedback processes. The\nsingle-electron demon can, in principle, be made fully reversible by developing\na thermodynamically reversible single-electron charge detector for measurements\nof the individual charge states of the single-electron box.\n", "  A rigorous Floquet mode analysis is proposed for a zero thickness space-time\nmodulated Huygens' metasurface to model and determine the strengths of the new\nharmonic components of the scattered fields. The proposed method is based on\nGeneralized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) treating a metasurface as a\nspatial discontinuity. The metasurface is described in terms of Lorentzian\nelectric and magnetic surface susceptibilities, $\\chi_\\text{ee}$ and\n$\\chi_\\text{mm}$, respectively, and its resonant frequencies are periodically\nmodulated in both space and time. The unknown scattered fields are then\nexpressed in terms of Floquet modes, which when used with the GSTCs, lead to a\nsystem of field matrix equations. The resulting set of linear equations are\nthen solved numerically to determine the total scattered fields. Using a\nfinite-difference time domain (FDTD) solver, the proposed method is validated\nand confirmed for several examples of modulation depths ($\\Delta_p$) and\nfrequencies ($\\omega_p$). Finally, the computed steady-state scattered fields\nare Fourier propagated analytically, for visualization of refracted harmonics.\nThe proposed method is simple and versatile and able to determine the\nsteady-state response of a space-time modulated Huygen's metasurface, for\narbitrary modulation frequencies and depths.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the invisibility cloaking in electromagnetic\nwave scattering from a new perspective. We are especially interested in\nachieving the invisibility cloaking by completely regular and isotropic\nmediums. Our study is based on an interior transmission eigenvalue problem. We\npropose a cloaking scheme that takes a three-layer structure including a\ncloaked region, a lossy layer and a cloaking shell. The target medium in the\ncloaked region can be arbitrary but regular, whereas the mediums in the lossy\nlayer and the cloaking shell are both regular and isotropic. We establish that\nthere exists an infinite set of incident waves such that the cloaking device is\nnearly-invisible under the corresponding wave interrogation. The set of waves\nis generated from the Maxwell-Herglotz approximation of the associated interior\ntransmission eigenfunctions. We provide the mathematical design of the cloaking\ndevice and sharply quantify the cloaking performance.\n", "  Topological matter is a popular topic in both condensed matter and cold atom\nresearch. In the past decades, a variety of models have been identified with\nfascinating topological features. Some, but not all, of the models can be found\nin materials. As a fully controllable system, cold atoms trapped in optical\nlattices provide an ideal platform to simulate and realize these topological\nmodels. Here we present a proposal for synthesizing topological models in cold\natoms based on a one-dimensional (1D) spin-dependent optical lattice potential.\nIn our system, features such as staggered tunneling, staggered Zeeman field,\nnearest-neighbor interaction, beyond-near-neighbor tunneling, etc. can be\nreadily realized. They underlie the emergence of various topological phases.\nOur proposal can be realized with current technology and hence has potential\napplications in quantum simulation of topological matter.\n", "  We have successfully synthesized single crystals of EuNi$_5$As$_3$ using a\nflux method and we present a comprehensive study of the physical properties\nusing magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity,\nthermoelectric power and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements.\nEuNi$_5$As$_3$ undergoes two close antiferromagnetic transitions at respective\ntemperatures of $T_{N1}$ = 7.2 K and $T_{N2}$ = 6.4 K, which are associated\nwith the Eu$^{2+}$ moments. Both transitions are suppressed upon applying a\nfield and we map the temperature-field phase diagrams for fields applied\nparallel and perpendicular to the easy $a$ axis. XAS measurements reveal that\nthe Eu is strongly divalent, with very little temperature dependence,\nindicating the localized Eu$^{2+}$ nature of EuNi$_5$As$_3$, with a lack of\nevidence for heavy fermion behavior.\n", "  Hydrogen storage by physisorption in carbon based materials is hindered by\nlow adsorption energies. In the last decade doping of carbon materials with\nalkali, earth alkali or other metal atoms was proposed as a means to enhance\nadsorption energies, and some experiments have shown promising results. We\ninvestigate the upper bounds of hydrogen storage capacities of $C_{60}Cs$\nclusters grown in ultracold helium nanodroplets by analyzing anomalies in the\nion abundance that indicate shell closure of hydrogen adsorption shells. On\nbare $C_{60}^{+}$, a commensurate phase with 32 $H_2$ molecules was identified\nin previous experiments. Doping $C_{60}$ with a single cesium atom leads to an\nincrease in relative ion abundance for the first 10 $H_2$ molecules, and the\nclosure of the commensurate phase is shifted from 32 to 42 $H_2$ molecules.\nDensity functional theory calculations indicate that thirteen energetically\nenhanced adsorption sites exist, where six of them fill the groove between Cs\nand $C_{60}$ and 7 are located at the cesium atom. We emphasize the large\neffect of the quantum nature of the hydrogen molecule on the adsorption\nenergies, i.e. the adsorption energies are decreased by around 50% for\n$(H_2)C_{60}Cs$ and up to 80% for $(H_2)C_{60}$ by harmonic zero-point\ncorrections, which represent an upper bound to corrections for dissociation\nenergies ($D_e$ to $D_0$) by the vibrational ground states. Five normal modes\nof libration and vibration of $H_2$ physisorbed on the substrate contribute\nprimarily to this large decrease in adsorption energies. A similar effect can\nbe found for H2 physisorbed on benzene and is expected to be found for any\nother weakly $H_2$-binding substrate.\n", "  We study the behavior of cooperative multiplayer quantum games [35,36] in the\npresence of decoherence using different quantum channels such as amplitude\ndamping, depolarizing and phase damping. It is seen that the outcomes of the\ngames for the two damping channels with maximum values of decoherence reduce to\nsame value. However, in comparison to phase damping channel, the payoffs of\ncooperators are strongly damped under the influence\\ amplitude damping channel\nfor\\ the lower values of decoherence parameter. In the case of depolarizing\nchannel, the game is a no-payoff game irrespective of the degree of\nentanglement in the initial state for the larger values of decoherence\nparameter. The decoherence gets the cooperators worse off.\n", "  In a wide class of physical systems, diffeomorphisms in the state space leave\nthe amount of entropy produced per unit time inside the bulk of the system\nunaffected [M. Polettini et al., 12th Joint European Thermodynamics Conference,\nBrescia, Italy, July 1-5, 2013]. This invariance implies that if relaxation\ntowards some final ('relaxed') state occurs, then the necessary condition for\nthe stability of the relaxed state against slowly evolving perturbations is the\nsame for all the systems of this class, regardless of both detailed dynamics of\nthe system, amplitude of fluctuations around mean values and possible\noccurrence of periodic oscillations in the relaxed state. Our discussion\ninvokes no Onsager symmetry, no detailed model of heat transport and\nproduction, and no approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium. This\nnecessary condition of stability is the constrained minimization of time- and\npath-ensemble-averaged amount of entropy produced per unit time inside the bulk\nof the system; for each system, constraints are provided by the equations of\nmotion. (Thermodynamic equilibrium corresponds to identically vanishing amount\nof entropy produced in the bulk, and satisfies trivially this condition). Our\nclass of physical systems includes both macroscopic and mesoscopic systems: the\nproblems of stability of these systems are dual to each other. As particular\ncases, we retrieve some necessary criteria for stability of relaxed states\navailable in the literature concerning current filaments and plasmoids in a\nDense Plasma Focus, flashing ratchets, Brownian motors and dynamo-affected,\nconvection-ruled shells of Sun-like rotating stars - in the latter case, for\nexample, we retrieve the scaling of the average magnetic field to the\nreciprocal of Rossby number. Finally, we argue that the validity of the popular\n\"maximum entropy production principle\" is questionable in these systems.\n", "  The issue of the equilibrium-range formation in the wind-wave spectrum is\nstudied by a direct numerical simulation. The evolution equation of wind-wave\nspectrum is numerically solved with using an exact calculation of the\nHasselmann kinetic integral and involving various modifications of known\nparametrizations for the wave-pumping mechanism due to wind and the\nwave-dissipation mechanism due viscosity of the upper layer. It is shown that\nthe balance of the last two mechanisms is responsible for a formation of\nstationary part of the wind-wave spectrum. This balance allows establishing any\nprescribed form of the equilibrium part of the spectrum, if the proper\nrepresentations of input and dissipation mechanisms are chosen.\n", "  The electronic states in isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have\nbeen considered as an ideal realization of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL).\nHowever, it remains unclear whether one-dimensional correlated states are\nrealized under local environmental effects such as the formation of a bundle\nstructure. Intertube effects originating from other adjacent SWCNTs within a\nbundle may drastically alter the one-dimensional correlated state. In order to\ntest the validity of the TLL model in bundled SWCNTs, low-energy spin\nexcitation is investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR\nrelaxation rate in bundled mixtures of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs shows\na power-law temperature dependence with a theoretically predicted exponent.\nThis demonstrates that a TLL state with the same strength as that for effective\nCoulomb interactions is realized in a bundled sample, as in isolated SWCNTs. In\nbundled metallic SWCNTs, we found a power-law temperature dependence of the\nrelaxation rate, but the magnitude of the relaxation rate is one order of\nmagnitude smaller than that predicted by theory. Furthermore, we found an\nalmost doubled magnitude of the Luttinger parameter. These results indicate\nsuppressed spin excitations with reduced Coulomb interactions in bundled\nmetallic SWCNTs, which are attributable to intertube interactions originating\nfrom adjacent metallic SWCNTs within a bundle. Our findings give direct\nevidence that bundling reduces the effective Coulomb interactions via intertube\ninteractions within bundled metallic SWCNTs.\n", "  The Atmospheric Drag, Occultation 'N' Ionospheric Scintillation mission\n(ADONIS) studies the dynamics of the terrestrial thermosphere and ionosphere in\ndependency of solar events over a full solar cycle in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).\nThe objectives are to investigate satellite drag with in-situ measurements and\nthe ionospheric electron density profiles with radio occultation and\nscintillation measurements. A constellation of two satellites provides the\npossibility to gain near real-time data (NRT) about ionospheric conditions over\nthe Arctic region where current coverage is insufficient. The mission shall\nalso provide global high-resolution data to improve assimilative ionospheric\nmodels. The low-cost constellation can be launched using a single Vega rocket\nand most of the instruments are already space-proven allowing for rapid\ndevelopment and good reliability. From July 16 to 25, 2013, the Alpbach Summer\nSchool 2013 was organised by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA), the International Space Science Institute (ISSI)\nand the association of Austrian space industries Austrospace in Alpbach,\nAustria. During the workshop, four teams of 15 students each independently\ndeveloped four different space mission proposals on the topic of \"Space\nWeather: Science, Missions and Systems\", supported by a team of tutors. The\npresent work is based on the mission proposal that resulted from one of these\nteams' efforts.\n", "  Recent years witnessed an extensive development of the theory of the critical\npoint in two-dimensional statistical systems, which allowed to prove {\\it\nexistence} and {\\it conformal invariance} of the {\\it scaling limit} for\ntwo-dimensional Ising model and dimers in planar graphs. Unfortunately, we are\nstill far from a full understanding of the subject: so far, exact solutions at\nthe lattice level, in particular determinant structure and exact discrete\nholomorphicity, play a cucial role in the rigorous control of the scaling\nlimit. The few results about not-integrable (interacting) systems at\ncriticality are still unable to deal with {\\it finite domains} and {\\it\nboundary corrections}, which are of course crucial for getting informations\nabout conformal covariance. In this thesis, we address the question of adapting\nconstructive Renormalization Group methods to non-integrable critical systems\nin $d= 1+1$ dimensions. We study a system of interacting spinless fermions on a\none-dimensional semi-infinite lattice, which can be considered as a prototype\nof the Luttinger universality class with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions. We\ndevelop a convergent renormalized expression for the thermodynamic observables\nin the presence of a quadratic {\\it boundary defect} counterterm, polynomially\nlocalized at the boundary. In particular, we get explicit bounds on the\nboundary corrections to the specific ground state energy.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality, i.e. the presence of strong correlations in spatially\nseperated systems which are forbidden by local realism, lies at the heart of\nquantum communications and quantum computing. Here, we use\npolarization-entangled photon pairs to demonstrate a nonlocal control of\nabsorption of light in a plasmonic structure. Through the detection of one\nphoton with a polarization-sensitive device, we can almost deterministically\nprevent or allow absorption of a second, remotely located photon. We\ndemonstrate this with pairs of photons, one of which is absorbed by coupling\ninto a plasmon of a thin metamaterial absorber in the path of a standing wave\nof an interferometer. Thus, energy dissipation of specific polarization states\non a heat-sink is remotely controlled, promising opportunities for\nprobabilistic quantum gating and controlling plasmon-photon conversion and\nentanglement.\n", "  In this paper, we present observations of cold (0-70 eV) plasma density in\nthe magnetotail lobes. The observations and results are based on 16 years of\nCluster observation of spacecraft potential measurements converted into local\nplasma densities. Measurements from all four Cluster spacecraft have been used,\nand the survey indicates a persistent asymmetry in lobe density, with\nconsistently higher cold plasma densities in the northern lobe. External\ninfluences, such as daily and seasonal variations in the Earth's tilt angle,\ncan introduce temporary north-south asymmetries through asymmetric ionization\nof the two hemispheres. Likewise, external drivers, such as the orientation of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field can set up additional spatial asymmetries in\noutflow and lobe filling. The persistent asymmetry reported in this paper is\nalso influenced by these external factors but is mainly caused by differences\nin magnetic field configuration in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere\nionospheres.\n", "  The effect of dipole-dipole interaction, the initial relative phase and the\ncoupling strength with the cavity on the dynamics of three two level atoms in\nthe good and the bad cavity regime are investigated. It is found that the\npresence of strong dipole-dipole interaction not only ensures avoiding\nentanglement sudden death but also retains entanglement for long time. The\nchoice of the phase in the initial state is crucial to the operational regime\nof the cavity. Under specific conditions, the entanglement can be frozen in\ntime to its initial values through strong dipole-dipole interaction. This trait\nof tripartite entanglement may prove helpful in engineering multiparticle\nentanglement for the practical realization of quantum technology.\n", "  We report on the electronic transport and the impact of spin-filtering in\nmesa-structures made of epitaxial thin films of cuprate superconductor\nYBa2Cu3Ox(YBCO) and the manganite LaMnO3 (LMO) interlayer with the Au/Nb\ncounterelectrode. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements of heterostructure\nAu/LMO/YBCO shows ferromagnetic state at temperatures below 150 K as in the\ncase of reference LMO film grown on the neodymium gallate substrate. The\nheights of the tunneling barrier evaluated from resistive characteristics of\nmesa-structures at different thickness of interlayer showed an exponential\ndecrease from 30 mV down to 5 mV with the increase of manganite interlayer\nthickness. Temperature dependence of the conductivity of mesa-structures could\nbe described taking into account the d-wave superconductivity in YBCO and a\nspin filtering of the electron transport. Spin filtering is supported also by\nmeasurements of magneto-resistance and the high sensitivity of mesa-structure\nconductivity to weak magnetic fields.\n", "  We show that the highly conductive polymer\npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) can\nsuccessfully be applied as a hole selective front contact in silicon\nheterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. In combination with a superior electron\nselective heterojunction back contact based on amorphous silicon (a-Si),\nmono-crystalline n-type silicon (c-Si) solar cells reach power conversion\nefficiencies up to 14.8% and high open-circuit voltages exceeding 660 mV. Since\nin the PEDOT:PSS/c-Si/a-Si solar cell the inferior hybrid junction is\ndetermining the electrical device performance we are capable of assessing the\nrecombination velocity v_I at the PEDOT:PSS/c-Si interface. An estimated v_I of\n~ 400 m/s demonstrates, that while PEDOT:PSS shows an excellent selectivity on\nn-type c-Si, the passivation quality provided by the formation of a native\noxide at the c-Si surface restricts the performance of the hybrid junction.\nFurthermore, by comparing the measured external quantum efficiency with optical\nsimulations, we quantify the losses due to parasitic absorption of PEDOT:PSS\nand reflection of the device layer stack. By pointing out ways to better\npassivate the hybrid interface and to increase the photocurrent we discuss the\nfull potential of PEDOT:PSS as a front contact in SHJ solar cells.\n", "  We demonstrate integrating a high quality factor lithium niobate microdisk\nresonator with a free-standing membrane waveguide. Our technique is based on\nfemtosecond laser direct writing which produces the pre-structure, followed by\nfocused ion beam milling which reduces the surface roughness of sidewall of the\nfabricated structure to nanometer scale. Efficient light coupling between the\nintegrated waveguide and microdisk was achieved, and the quality factor of the\nmicroresonator was measured as high as 1.67*10^5.\n", "  We demonstrate remote detection of rotating machinery, using an atomic\nmagnetometer at room temperature and in an unshielded environment. The system\nrelies on the coupling of the AC magnetic signature of the target with the\nspin-polarized, precessing atomic vapor of a radio-frequency optical atomic\nmagnetometer. The AC magnetic signatures of rotating equipment or electric\nmotors appear as sidebands in the power spectrum of the atomic sensor, which\ncan be tuned to avoid noisy bands that would otherwise hamper detection. A\nportable apparatus is implemented and experimentally tested. Proof-of-concept\ninvestigations are performed with test targets mimicking possible applications,\nand the operational conditions for optimum detection are determined. Our\ninstrument provides comparable or better performance than a commercial fluxgate\nand allows detection of rotating machinery behind a wall. These results\ndemonstrate the potential for ultrasensitive devices for remote industrial and\nusage monitoring, security, and surveillance.\n", "  The structural nature of high-density amorphous ice (HDA), which forms\nthrough low-temperature pressure-induced amorphization of the 'ordinary' ice I,\nis heavily debated. Clarifying this question is not only important for\nunderstanding the complex condensed states of H$_2$O but also in the wider\ncontext of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered\nacross the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride\n(NH$_4$F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes\na pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is\nnot amorphous but NH$_4$F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV.\nThis collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In\nthe case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a\ndeviation from this mechanism and we therefore classify HDA as a 'derailed'\nstate along the ice I to ice IV pathway.\n", "  Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is one of the devices for gas amplification and\navailable as an amplification part of detectors for many experiments. A GEM\nwith a 50 $\\mu m$ thick insulator is popular and widely used in many\nexperimental fields. However it is necessary to use several layers of them to\nget sufficient gas gain because gas gain which is provided with only one 50\n$\\mu m$ thick GEM is only several times ten. On the other hand, a thick GEM\nwhose amplification area is expanded from 50 to 100 $\\mu m$ to get higher gas\ngain which can be sufficient even with a double stack configuration. But the\nmeasurement of gas gain uniformity using a large area 100 $\\mu m$ thick GEM\nreported here observed sizable non-uniformity which reached more than 50\\%. We\ninvestigated gas gain uniformity which is derived from geometries of the GEM\nusing $\\rm{garfield^{++}}$ and considered an optimal geometry for the 100 $\\mu\nm$ thick GEM.\n", "  We report on a comprehensive study of the unique adhesive properties of mats\nof polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanofibers produced by electrospinning. Fibers\nare deposited on glass, varying the diameter and the relative orientation of\nthe polymer filaments (random vs aligned configuration). While no significant\nvariation is observed in the static contact angle (about 130{\\deg}) of\ndeposited water drops upon changing the average fiber diameter up to the\nmicrometer scale, fibers are found to exhibit unequalled water adhesion. Placed\nvertically, they can hold up water drops as large as 60 microL, more than twice\nthe values typically obtained with hairy surfaces prepared by different\nmethods. For aligned fibers with anisotropic wetting behavior, the maximum\nvolume measured in the direction perpendicular to the fibers goes up to 90\n{\\mu}L. This work suggests new routes to tailor the wetting behavior on\nextended areas by nanofiber coatings, with possible applications in adsorbing\nand catalytic surfaces, microfluidic devices, and filtration technologies.\n", "  The successive stages of a high-energy collision are conjectured to end up\nwith chemical and thermal freezeout of the produced particles. We utilize\ngeneric (non)extensive statistics which is believed to determine the degree of\n(non)extensivity through two critical exponents due to possible phase-space\nmodifications. This statistical approach likely manifests various types of\ncorrelations and fluctuations and also possible interactions among the\nfinal-state produced particles. We study the baryon-to-pion ratios at top RHIC\nand LHC energies including the so-called proton anomaly.\n", "  This paper is intended to be a further step through our Killing spinor\nprogramme started with Class. Quantum Grav. \\textbf{32}, 175007 (2015), and we\nwill advance our programme in accordance with the road map recently given in\narXiv:1611.04424v2. In the latter reference many open problems were declared,\none of which contained the uncovered relations between specific spinors in\nspacetime represented by an arrow diagram built upon them. This work deals with\none of the arrows with almost all of its details and ends up with an important\nphysical interpretation of this setup in terms of the quantum electrodynamical\npair annihilation process. This method will shed light on the classification of\npseudo-Riemannian manifolds admitting twistors in connection with the\nclassification problem related to Killing spinors. Many physical\ninterpretations are given during the text some of which include dynamics of\nbrane immersions, quantum field theoretical considerations and black hole\nevaporation.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor, high-ionizing starbursts in the local Universe provide\nunique laboratories for exploring in detail the physics of high-redshift\nsystems. Also, their ongoing star-formation and haphazard morphology make them\noutstanding proxies for primordial galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy,\nwe spatially resolved the ISM properties and massive stars of two first-class\nlow metallicity galaxies with Wolf-Rayet features and nebular HeII emission:\nMrk178 and IZw18. In this review, we summarize our main results for these two\nobjects.\n", "  We consider a finite-dimensional quantum system coupled to the bosonic\nradiation field and subject to a time-periodic control operator. Assuming the\nvalidity of a certain dynamic decoupling condition we approximate the system's\ntime evolution with respect to the non-interacting dynamics. For sufficiently\nsmall coupling constants $g$ and control periods $T$ we show that a certain\ndeviation of coupled and uncoupled propagator may be estimated by\n$\\mathcal{O}(gt \\, T)$. Our approach relies on the concept of Kato stability\nand general theory on non-autonomous linear evolution equations.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to construct a simple, efficient and accurate\nwell-balanced numerical scheme for one-dimensional (1D) blood flow in large\narteries with varying geometrical and mechanical properties. As the steady\nstates at rest are not relevant for blood flow, we construct two well-balanced\nhydrostatic reconstruction techniques designed to preserve low-Shapiro number\nsteady states that may occur in large network simulations. The Shapiro number S\nh = u/c is the equivalent of the Froude number for shallow water equations and\nthe Mach number for compressible Euler equations. The first is the low-Shapiro\nhydrostatic reconstruction (HR-LS), which is a simple and efficient method,\ninspired from the hydrostatic reconstruction technique (HR). The second is the\nsubsonic hydrostatic reconstruction (HR-S), adapted here to blood flow and\ndesigned to exactly preserve all subcritical steady states. We systematically\ncompare HR, HR-LS and HR-S in a series of single artery and arterial network\nnumerical tests designed to evaluate their well-balanced and wave-capturing\nproperties. The results indicate that HR is not adapted to compute blood flow\nin large arteries as it is unable to capture wave reflections and transmissions\nwhen large variations of the arteries' geometrical and mechanical properties\nare considered. On the contrary, HR-S is exactly well-balanced and is the most\naccurate hydrostatic reconstruction technique. However, HR-LS is able to\ncompute low-Shapiro number steady states as well as wave reflections and\ntransmissions with satisfying accuracy and is simpler and computationally less\nexpensive than HR-S. We therefore recommend using HR-LS for 1D blood flow\nsimulations in large arterial network simulations.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamics of cylindrical armoured bubbles excited\nby mechanical vibrations. A step by step transition from cylindrical to\nspherical shape is reported as the intensity of the vibration is increased,\nleading to a reduction of the bubble surface and a dissemination of the excess\nparticles. We demonstrate through energy balance that nonspherical armoured\nbubbles constitute a metastable state. The vibration instills the activation\nenergy necessary for the bubble to return to its least energetic stable state:\na spherical armoured bubble. At this point, particle desorption can only be\nachieved through higher amplitude of excitation required to overcome capillary\nretention forces. Nonspherical armoured bubbles open perspectives for tailored\nlocalized particle dissemination with limited excitation power.\n", "  Artifacts in quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are analyzed to\nestablish an optimal design criterion for QSM inversion algorithms. The\nmagnetic field data is decomposed into two parts, dipole compatible and\nincompatible parts. The dipole compatible part generates the desired\nnon-streaking solution. The dipole incompatible part, including noise,\ndiscretization error, and anisotropy sources, generates artifacts defined by a\nwave propagator with the B0 field direction as the time axis. Granular noise\ncauses streaking and contiguous error causes both streaking and shadow\nartifacts. As an example, truncation-based QSM algorithms are inherently prone\nto streaking artifacts because of the deviation of the dipole kernel during\ntruncation. Through numerical phantom and imaging experiments, several QSM\nmethods, including a Bayesian regularization method and the k-space truncation\nmethods, were compared to show that the Bayesian approach with a structural\nprior provides advantages in terms of both image quality and quantitative\nmeasures.\n", "  We consider a system of N particles interacting via a short-range smooth\npotential, in a intermediate regime between the weak-coupling and the\nlow-density. We provide a rigorous derivation of the Linear Landau equation\nfrom this particle system. The strategy of the proof consists in showing the\nasymptotic equivalence between the one-particle marginal and the solution of\nthe linear Boltzmann equation with vanishing mean free path.Then, following the\nideas of Landau, we prove the asympotic equivalence between the solutions of\nthe Boltzmann and Landau linear equation in the grazing collision limit.\n", "  We give a short review of processes of stochastic acceleration in the Galaxy.\nWe discuss: how to estimate correctly the number of accelerated particles, and\nat which condition the stochastic mechanism is able to generate power-law\nnonthermal spectra. We present an analysis of stochastic acceleration in the\nGalactic halo and discuss whether this mechanism can be responsible for\nproduction of high energy electrons there, which emit gamma-ray and microwave\nemission from the giant Fermi bubbles. Lastly, we discuss whether the effects\nof stochastic acceleration can explain the CR distribution in the Galactic disk\n(CR gradient).\n", "  The mass of the top quark is a fundamental parameter of the standard model\nand has to be determined experimentally. In these proceedings, I review recent\nmeasurements of the top quark mass in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt s=7,~8,$ and 13\nTeV recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC, and in $p\\bar p$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt s=1.96$ TeV recorded by the CDF and D0 experiments at the\nTevatron. The measurements are performed in final states containing two, one,\nand no charged leptons. A relative precision of down to 0.3% is attained. In\naddition, recent measurements aiming to determine the top quark mass in the\nwell-defined pole scheme using both inclusive $t\\bar t$ and $t\\bar t+1~{\\rm\njet}$ production are presented.\n", "  Detection of the mostly geomagnetically generated radio emission of\ncosmic-ray air showers provides an alternative to air-Cherenkov and\nair-fluorescence detection, since it is not limited to clear nights. Like these\nestablished methods, the radio signal is sensitive to the calorimetric energy\nand the position of the maximum of the electromagnetic shower component. This\nmakes antenna arrays an ideal extension for particle-detector arrays above a\nthreshold energy of about 100 PeV of the primary cosmic-ray particles. In the\nlast few years the digital radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers again\nmade significant progress, and there now is a consistent picture of the\nemission mechanisms confirmed by several measurements. Recent results by the\nantenna arrays AERA and Tunka-Rex confirm that the absolute accuracy for the\nshower energy is as good as the other detection techniques. Moreover, the\nsensitivity to the shower maximum of the radio signal has been confirmed in\ndirect comparison to air-Cherenkov measurements by Tunka-Rex. The dense antenna\narray LOFAR can already compete with the established techniques in accuracy for\ncosmic-ray mass-composition. In the future, a new generation of radio\nexperiments might drive the field: either by providing extremely large exposure\nfor inclined cosmic-ray or neutrino showers or, like the SKA core in Australia\nwith its several 10,000 antennas, by providing extremely detailed measurements.\n", "  We determine the masses and pseudoscalar decay constants of D and D_s mesons\nemploying lattice QCD with non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson quarks and a\ntree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Our analysis is based on the\nlarge-volume N_f=2+1 ensembles using open boundary conditions, generated within\nthe CLS effort. The status of results presented here covers two lattice\nspacings, a ~ 0.0854 fm and a ~ 0.0644 fm, and pion masses varied from 420 to\n200 MeV. We also report on our implementation of distance preconditioning for\nthe calculation of heavy quark propagators and discuss the impact of the\nresulting accuracy improvements on the extraction of charmed meson masses and\ndecay constants. This is part of a continuing analysis by the RQCD and ALPHA\nCollaborations, aiming at a stable continuum extrapolation using several\nlattice spacings. To extrapolate to the physical masses, we follow both, the\n(2*m_l+m_s)=const. and the m_s=const. line in parameter space.\n", "  Although the cusp-core controversy for dwarf galaxies is seen as a problem, I\nargue that the cored central profiles can be explained by flattened cusps\nbecause they suffer from conflicting measurements and poor statistics and\nbecause there is a large number of conventional processes that could have\nflattened them since their creation, none of which requires new physics. Other\nproblems, such as \"too big to fail\", are not discussed.\n", "  Here we study the nonlinear hyperbolic equations of the type of equations\nfrom theory of flows on networks, for which we prove the solvability theorem\nunder the appropriate conditions and also investigate the behaviour of the\nsolution.\n", "  Insulating Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ is a layered chloride consisting of two-dimensional\ntriangular layers of $S_{eff}$ = 1/2 Nb$_3$Cl$_{13}$ clusters at room\ntemperature. Magnetic susceptibility measurement show a sharp, hysteretic drop\nto a temperature independent value below $T = 90$ K. Specific heat measurements\nshow that the transition is first order, with $\\Delta S \\approx 5\\ \\mathrm{J\n\\cdot K^{-1} \\cdot mol\\ \\mathit{f.u.}^{-1}}$, and a low temperature $T$-linear\ncontribution originating from defect spins. Neutron and X-ray diffraction show\na lowering of symmetry from trigonal $P\\bar{3}m1$ to monoclinic $C2/m$\nsymmetry, with a change in layer stacking from -AB-AB- to\n-AB$^\\prime$-BC$^\\prime$-CA$^\\prime$- and no observed magnetic order. This\nlowering of symmetry and rearrangement of successive layers evades geometric\nmagnetic frustration to form a singlet ground state. It is the lowest\ntemperature at which a change in stacking sequence is known to occur in a\nVan-der-Waals solid, occurs in the absence of orbital degeneracies, and\nsuggests that designer 2-D heterostructures may be able to undergo similar\nphase transitions.\n", "  Localisation of gamma-ray interaction points in monolithic scintillator\ncrystals can simplify the design and improve the performance of a future\nCompton telescope for gamma-ray astronomy. In this paper we compare the\nposition resolution of three monolithic scintillators: a 28x28x20 mm3 (length x\nbreadth x thickness) LaBr3:Ce crystal, a 25x25x20 mm3 CeBr3 crystal and a\n25x25x10 mm3 CeBr3 crystal. Each crystal was encapsulated and coupled to an\narray of 4x4 silicon photomultipliers through an optical window. The\nmeasurements were conducted using 81 keV and 356 keV gamma-rays from a\ncollimated 133Ba source. The 3D position reconstruction of interaction points\nwas performed using artificial neural networks trained with experimental data.\nAlthough the position resolution was significantly better for the thinner\ncrystal, the 20 mm thick CeBr3 crystal showed an acceptable resolution of about\n5.4 mm FWHM for the x and y coordinates, and 7.8 mm FWHM for the z-coordinate\n(crystal depth) at 356 keV. These values were obtained from the full position\nscans of the crystal sides. The position resolution of the LaBr3:Ce crystal was\nfound to be considerably worse, presumably due to the highly diffusive optical\nin- terface between the crystal and the optical window of the enclosure. The\nenergy resolution (FWHM) measured for 662 keV gamma-rays was 4.0% for LaBr3:Ce\nand 5.5% for CeBr3. The same crystals equipped with a PMT (Hamamatsu R6322-100)\ngave an energy resolution of 3.0% and 4.7%, respectively.\n"]}
