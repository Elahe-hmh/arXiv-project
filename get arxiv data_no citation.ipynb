Two\\npopular board shapes are the 33-hole cross-shaped board, and the 15-hole\\ntriangle board---we use them as examples throughout. The basic game begins from\\na full board with one peg missing and the goal is to finish at a board position\\nwith one peg. First, we discuss ways to solve the basic game on a computer.\\nThen we consider the problem of quickly distinguishing board positions where\\nthe goal can still be reached (\"winning\" board positions) from those where it\\ncannot. This enables a computer to alert the player if a jump under\\nconsideration leads to a dead end. On the 15-hole triangle board, it is\\npossible to identify all winning board positions (from any single vacancy\\nstart) by storing a key set of 437 board positions. For the \"central game\" on\\nthe 33-hole cross-shaped board, we can identify all winning board positions by\\nstoring 839,536 board positions. By viewing a successful game as a traversal of\\na directed graph of winning board positions, we apply a simple algorithm to\\ncount the number of ways to traverse this graph, and calculate that the total\\nnumber of solutions to the central game is 40,861,647,040,079,968.

This\\nconstruction is similar to J. von Neumann self-reproducing automata; similar\\nideas were also used by P. Gacs in the context of error-correcting\\ncomputations. This construction it rather flexible, so it can be used in many\\nways: we show how it can be used to implement substitution rules, to construct\\nstrongly aperiodic tile sets (any tiling is far from any periodic tiling), to\\ngive a new proof for the undecidability of the domino problem and related\\nresults, characterize effectively closed 1D subshift it terms of 2D shifts of\\nfinite type (improvement of a result by M. Hochman), to construct a tile set\\nwhich has only complex tilings, and to construct a \"robust\" aperiodic tile set\\nthat does not have periodic (or close to periodic) tilings even if we allow\\nsome (sparse enough) tiling errors.

It is well known that there is a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence between such an entropy vector and a certain\\ngroup-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and $n$ of its\\nsubgroups [3]. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space\\nof entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention\\nto abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an\\nexplanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al [4] that linear network codes\\ncannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems. All abelian\\ngroup-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by\\nlinear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton\\ninequality. It is therefore of interest to identify groups that violate the\\nIngleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian\\nfinite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton\\ninequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group $S_5$\\nto be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study\\nof the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to\\nthe Ingleton-violating family $PGL(2,q)$ with a prime power $q \\\\geq 5$, i.e.,\\nthe projective group of $2\\\\times 2$ nonsingular matrices with entries in\\n$\\\\mathbb{F}_q$.

In the subset versions of\\nthis problems, we are given an additional subset $S$ of vertices (resp., edges)\\nand we want to hit all cycles passing through a vertex of $S$ (resp. an edge of\\n$S$). Recently, the Subset Feedback Vertex Set in undirected graphs was shown\\nto be FPT by Cygan et al. (ICALP '11) and independently by Kakimura et al.\\n(SODA '12).

Although Zipf's law is perhaps the most popular case, recently,\\nMenzerath's law has begun to be involved. Menzerath's law manifests in\\nlanguage, music and genomes as a tendency of the mean size of the parts to\\ndecrease as the number of parts increases in many situations. This statistical\\nregularity emerges also in the context of genomes, for instance, as a tendency\\nof species with more chromosomes to have a smaller mean chromosome size. It has\\nbeen argued that the instantiation of this law in genomes is not indicative of\\nany parallel between language and genomes because (a) the law is inevitable and\\n(b) non-coding DNA dominates genomes. Here mathematical, statistical and\\nconceptual challenges of these criticisms are discussed. Two major conclusions\\nare drawn: the law is not inevitable and languages also have a correlate of\\nnon-coding DNA. However, the wide range of manifestations of the law in and\\noutside genomes suggests that the striking similarities between non-coding DNA\\nand certain linguistics units could be anecdotal for understanding the\\nrecurrence of that statistical law.\",\n",

Our main example is \"majority dynamics\", in\\nwhich each voter adopts the most popular opinion among its friends.

In this paper, we propose algorithms for\\nintegrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases, with the goal of\\nallowing crowd-sourcing applications to scale, i.e., to handle larger datasets\\nat lower costs. The key observation is that, in many of the above tasks, humans\\nand machine learning algorithms can be complementary, as humans are often more\\naccurate but slow and expensive, while algorithms are usually less accurate,\\nbut faster and cheaper.\\n  Based on this observation, we present two new active learning algorithms to\\ncombine humans and algorithms together in a crowd-sourced database. Our\\nalgorithms are based on the theory of non-parametric bootstrap, which makes our\\nresults applicable to a broad class of machine learning models. Our results, on\\nthree real-life datasets collected with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and on 15\\nwell-known UCI data sets, show that our methods on average ask humans to label\\none to two orders of magnitude fewer items to achieve the same accuracy as a\\nbaseline that labels random images, and two to eight times fewer questions than\\nprevious active learning schemes.\",\n",

To improve the efficiency\\nof solving large-scale Lasso problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have\\nproposed the SAFE rules which are able to quickly identify the inactive\\npredictors, i.e., predictors that have $0$ components in the solution vector.\\nThen, the inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization\\nproblem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its dual\\nform, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set of inactive\\nconstraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we propose an\\nefficient and effective screening rule via Dual Polytope Projections (DPP),\\nwhich is mainly based on the uniqueness and nonexpansiveness of the optimal\\ndual solution due to the fact that the feasible set in the dual space is a\\nconvex and closed polytope. Moreover, we show that our screening rule can be\\nextended to identify inactive groups in group Lasso. To the best of our\\nknowledge, there is currently no \"exact\" screening rule for group Lasso.

We can estimate the clustering coefficient by degree\\nbin (e.g., we use exponential binning) and the number of triangles per bin, as\\nwell as the global clustering coefficient and total number of triangles, in an\\naverage of 0.33 seconds per million edges plus overhead (approximately 225\\nseconds total for our configuration). The technique can also be used to study\\ntriangle statistics such as the ratio of the highest and lowest degree, and we\\nhighlight differences between social and non-social networks.

       "  'abstract': 'In this paper we introduce and study a new property of infinite words: An\\ninfinite word $x\\\\in A^\\\\mathbb{N}$, with values in a finite set $A$, is said to\\nbe $k$-self-shuffling $(k\\\\geq 2)$ if $x$ admits factorizations:\\n$x=\\\\prod_{i=0}^\\\\infty U_i^{(1)}\\\\cdots U_i^{(k)}=\\\\prod_{i=0}^\\\\infty\\nU_i^{(1)}=\\\\cdots =\\\\prod_{i=0}^\\\\infty U_i^{(k)}$. In other words, there exists a\\nshuffle of $k$-copies of $x$ which produces $x$. We are particularly interested\\nin the case $k=2$, in which case we say $x$ is self-shuffling. This property of\\ninfinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its\\nlanguage (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non\\nself-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being\\nself-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising\\nin the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They\\ninclude for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept\\n$0<\\\\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\\\\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling). Our\\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words can be interpreted\\narithmetically in terms of a dynamical embedding and defines an arithmetic\\nprocess we call the {\\\\it stepping stone model}. One important feature of\\nself-shuffling words stems from its morphic invariance, which provides a useful\\ntool for showing that one word is not the morphic image of another. The notion\\nof self-shuffling has other unexpected applications particularly in the area of\\nsubstitutive dynamical systems. For example, as a consequence of our\\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words, we recover a number\\ntheoretic result, originally due to Yasutomi, on a classification of pure\\nmorphic Sturmian words in the orbit of the characteristic.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the field of face recognition, Sparse Representation (SR) has received\\nconsiderable attention during the past few years. Most of the relevant\\nliterature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification\\napplications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class\\nin the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace\\nspanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is\\neasily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an\\nalgorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not\\nbeen seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss\\nwhy previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems.\\nWe then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR.\\nSpecifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches\\nrather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via\\naveraging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to\\nform an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations\\nwithin each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to\\nmisalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we\\nevaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder\\nNeural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on\\nGaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and\\nChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains\\nconsiderably better and more robust performance than several previous\\nstate-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set\\nidentification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based\\nencoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but\\nleads to higher recognition rates.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Conceptual combination performs a fundamental role in creating the broad\\nrange of compound phrases utilized in everyday language. This article provides\\na novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of\\nconceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a\\nfunction of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the\\nsystematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor\\nof assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly\\nquestioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the\\nprinciple of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that\\nnotions of both \"strong\" and \"weak\" compositionality appear in the literature.\\nRather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the\\nframework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear\\ndividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In\\naddition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually\\nsensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite\\nsystems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of\\nconceptual combinations to be classified as \"compositional\" or\\n\"non-compositional\". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the\\njoint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the\\nfactorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary\\nand sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A\\nfailure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be\\nmodeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and\\nthe combination is thus deemed \"non-compositional\". The formal analysis methods\\nare demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four\\nnon-lexicalised conceptual combinations.',\n",

With so many different\\nmodels of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free\\nnetworks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular\\ngrowth or construction process. We propose a simple maximum entropy process\\nwhich provides the best representation of what are typical properties of\\nscale-free networks, and provides a standard against which real and\\nalgorithmically generated networks can be compared. As an example we consider\\npreferential attachment and find that this particular growth model does not\\nyield typical realizations of scale-free networks. In particular, the widely\\ndiscussed \"fragility\" of scale-free networks is actually found to be due to the\\npeculiar \"hub-centric\" structure of preferential attachment networks. We\\nprovide a method to generate or remove this latent hub-centric bias --- thereby\\ndemonstrating exactly which features of preferential attachment networks are\\natypical of the broader class of scale-free networks. We are also able to\\nstatistically demonstrate whether real networks are typical realizations of\\nscale-free networks, or networks with that particular degree distribution;\\nusing a new surrogate generation method for complex networks, exactly analogous\\nthe the widely used surrogate tests of nonlinear time series analysis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the dominance of the downlink traffic in Wireless Local Area Networks\\n(WLANs), a large number of previous research efforts have been put to enhance\\nthe transmission from the Access Point (AP) to stations (STAs). The downlink\\nMulti-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique, supported by the\\nlatest IEEE amendment-802.11ac, is considered as one of the key enhancements\\nleading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud uploading services,\\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) and telepresence applications get popular, the need for a\\nhigher uplink capacity becomes inevitable.\\n  In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol\\ncalled Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs\\nby exploring the multi-user spatial multiplexing technique. Specifically, in\\nthe downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission\\nscheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the\\nuplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two\\nrounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP\\nsimultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd), a parameter that makes\\nthe length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic\\ncondition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in\\nsaturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic\\nare present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to\\nvalidate the simulation results. By properly setting CW2nd and other\\nparameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme\\nin the literature. The results exhibit that Uni-MUMAC not only performs well in\\nthe downlink-dominant scenario, but it is also able to balance both the\\ndownlink and uplink throughput in the emerging uplink bandwidth-hungry\\nscenario.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent years have seen a growing interest in the modeling and simulation of\\nsocial networks to understand several social phenomena. Two important classes\\nof networks, small world and scale free networks have gained a lot of research\\ninterest. Another important characteristic of social networks is the presence\\nof community structures. Many social processes such as information diffusion\\nand disease epidemics depend on the presence of community structures making it\\nan important property for network generation models to be incorporated. In this\\npaper, we present a tunable and growing network generation model with small\\nworld and scale free properties as well as the presence of community\\nstructures. The major contribution of this model is that the communities thus\\ncreated satisfy three important structural properties: connectivity within each\\ncommunity follows power-law, communities have high clustering coefficient and\\nhierarchical community structures are present in the networks generated using\\nthe proposed model. Furthermore, the model is highly robust and capable of\\nproducing networks with a number of different topological characteristics\\nvarying clustering coefficient and inter-cluster edges. Our simulation results\\nshow that the model produces small world and scale free networks along with the\\npresence of communities depicting real world societies and social networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We consider several types of internal queries: questions about subwords of a\\ntext. As the main tool we develop an optimal data structure for the problem\\ncalled here internal pattern matching. This data structure provides\\nconstant-time answers to queries about occurrences of one subword $x$ in\\nanother subword $y$ of a given text, assuming that $|y|=\\\\mathcal{O}(|x|)$,\\nwhich allows for a constant-space representation of all occurrences. This\\nproblem can be viewed as a natural extension of the well-studied pattern\\nmatching problem. The data structure has linear size and admits a linear-time\\nconstruction algorithm.\\n  Using the solution to the internal pattern matching problem, we obtain very\\nefficient data structures answering queries about: primitivity of subwords,\\nperiods of subwords, general substring compression, and cyclic equivalence of\\ntwo subwords. All these results improve upon the best previously known\\ncounterparts. The linear construction time of our data structure also allows to\\nimprove the algorithm for finding $\\\\delta$-subrepetitions in a text (a more\\ngeneral version of maximal repetitions, also called runs).

       "  'abstract': 'This paper focuses on characterizing the fundamental performance limits that\\ncan be expected from an ideal decoder given a general model, ie, a general\\nsubset of \"simple\" vectors of interest. First, we extend the so-called notion\\nof instance optimality of a decoder to settings where one only wishes to\\nreconstruct some part of the original high dimensional vector from a\\nlow-dimensional observation. This covers practical settings such as medical\\nimaging of a region of interest, or audio source separation when one is only\\ninterested in estimating the contribution of a specific instrument to a musical\\nrecording. We define instance optimality relatively to a model much beyond the\\ntraditional framework of sparse recovery, and characterize the existence of an\\ninstance optimal decoder in terms of joint properties of the model and the\\nconsidered linear operator. Noiseless and noise-robust settings are both\\nconsidered. We show somewhat surprisingly that the existence of noise-aware\\ninstance optimal decoders for all noise levels implies the existence of a\\nnoise-blind decoder. A consequence of our results is that for models that are\\nrich enough to contain an orthonormal basis, the existence of an L2/L2 instance\\noptimal decoder is only possible when the linear operator is not substantially\\ndimension-reducing. This covers well-known cases (sparse vectors, low-rank\\nmatrices) as well as a number of seemingly new situations (structured sparsity\\nand sparse inverse covariance matrices for instance). We exhibit an\\noperator-dependent norm which, under a model-specific generalization of the\\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP), always yields a feasible instance\\noptimality property. This norm can be upper bounded by an atomic norm relative\\nto the considered model.',\n",

In\\nparticular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive\\ninformation, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient\\nradio frequency energy. We devise novel online scheduling schemes in which the\\ntradeoff between the users' ergodic rates and their average amount of harvested\\nenergy can be controlled. In particular, we modify the well-known maximum\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum normalized-SNR (N-SNR) schedulers by\\nscheduling the user whose SNR/N-SNR has a certain ascending order (selection\\norder) rather than the maximum one. We refer to these new schemes as\\norder-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling and show that the lower the selection order,\\nthe higher the average amount of harvested energy in the system at the expense\\nof a reduced ergodic sum rate. The order-based N-SNR scheduling scheme provides\\nproportional fairness among the users in terms of both the ergodic achievable\\nrate and the average harvested energy. Furthermore, we propose an order-based\\nequal throughput (ET) fair scheduler, which schedules the user having the\\nminimum moving average throughput out of the users whose N-SNR orders fall into\\na given set of allowed orders. We show that this scheme provides the users with\\nproportionally fair average harvested energies. In this context, we also derive\\nfeasibility conditions for achieving ET with the order-based ET scheduler.\\nUsing the theory of order statistics, the average per-user harvested energy and\\nergodic achievable rate of all proposed scheduling schemes are analyzed and\\nobtained in closed form for independent and non-identically distributed\\nRayleigh, Ricean, Nakagami-m, and Weibull fading channels.

In each case, scaling laws are developed\\nthat trade-off probability of robust identifiability with the complexity of the\\nrank two null space. An added appeal of our approach is that the rank two null\\nspace can be partly or fully characterized for many bilinear problems of\\ninterest (e.g. blind deconvolution). We present numerical experiments involving\\nvariations on the blind deconvolution problem that exploit a characterization\\nof the rank two null space and demonstrate that the scaling laws offer good\\nestimates of identifiability.',\n",

It is\\ntheoretically well known that the codebook size for CSI quantization should be\\nincreased as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, and 3GPP long term\\nevolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced codebooks also follow this trend. Thus, in\\nmassive MIMO, it is hard to apply the conventional approach of using\\npre-defined vector-quantized codebooks for CSI quantization mainly because of\\ncodeword search complexity. In this paper, we propose a trellis-extended\\ncodebook (TEC) that can be easily harmonized with current wireless standards\\nsuch as LTE or LTE-Advanced by extending standardized codebooks designed for 2,\\n4, or 8 antennas with trellis structures. TEC exploits a Viterbi decoder and\\nconvolutional encoder in channel coding as the CSI quantizer and the CSI\\nreconstructer, respectively. By quantizing multiple channel entries\\nsimultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of trellis\\nsearch, TEC can achieve fractional bits per channel entry quantization to have\\na practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the\\nfeedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems. We also\\ndevelop trellis-extended successive phase adjustment (TE-SPA) which works as a\\ndifferential codebook of TEC. This is similar to the dual codebook concept of\\nLTE-Advanced. TE-SPA can reduce CSI quantization error even with lower feedback\\noverhead in temporally correlated channels. Numerical results verify the\\neffectiveness of the proposed schemes in FDD massive MIMO systems.',\n",

Several applications such as finding\\npatient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in\\nrecommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from\\nco-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to\\ngenerate co-clusters for improved data analysis.\\n  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping\\nCo-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and\\nimproved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by\\nmaximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on\\nthe number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and\\nf-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.\\nResults of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques\\n- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,\\nInternet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Data assimilation combines information from models, measurements, and priors\\nto estimate the state of a dynamical system such as the atmosphere. The\\nEnsemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a family of ensemble-based data assimilation\\napproaches that has gained wide popularity due its simple formulation, ease of\\nimplementation, and good practical results. Most EnKF algorithms assume that\\nthe underlying probability distributions are Gaussian. Although this assumption\\nis well accepted, it is too restrictive when applied to large nonlinear models,\\nnonlinear observation operators, and large levels of uncertainty. Several\\napproaches have been proposed in order to avoid the Gaussianity assumption. One\\nof the most successful strategies is the maximum likelihood ensemble filter\\n(MLEF) which computes a maximum a posteriori estimate of the state assuming the\\nposterior distribution is Gaussian. MLEF is designed to work with nonlinear and\\neven non-differentiable observation operators, and shows good practical\\nperformance. However, there are limits to the degree of nonlinearity that MLEF\\ncan handle. This paper proposes a new ensemble-based data assimilation method,\\nnamed the \"sampling filter\", which obtains the analysis by sampling directly\\nfrom the posterior distribution. The sampling strategy is based on a Hybrid\\nMonte Carlo (HMC) approach that can handle non-Gaussian probability\\ndistributions. Numerical experiments are carried out using the Lorenz-96 model\\nand observation operators with different levels of non-linearity and\\ndifferentiability. The proposed filter is also tested with shallow water model\\non a sphere with linear observation operator. The results show that the\\nsampling filter can perform well even in highly nonlinear situations were EnKF\\nand MLEF filters diverge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Radio-frequency (RF) enabled wireless energy transfer (WET), as a promising\\nsolution to provide cost-effective and reliable power supplies for\\nenergy-constrained wireless networks, has drawn growing interests recently. To\\novercome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing\\nmulti-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct\\nwireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed \\\\emph{energy\\nbeamforming}, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the\\nachievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available\\nchannel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired\\npractically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel\\nacquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\\nWET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the\\nCSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited\\nenergy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully\\ndesigned so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet\\nwithout consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to\\nmaximize the \\\\emph{net} harvested energy at the ER, which is the average\\nharvested energy offset by that used for channel training. An optimization\\nproblem is formulated for the training design over MIMO Rician fading channels,\\nincluding the subset of ER antennas to be trained, as well as the training time\\nand power allocated. Closed-form solutions are obtained for some special\\nscenarios, based on which useful insights are drawn on when training should be\\nemployed to improve the net transferred energy in MIMO WET systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The benchmark for computation is typically given as Turing computability; the\\nability for a computation to be performed by a Turing Machine. Many languages\\nexploit (indirect) encodings of Turing Machines to demonstrate their ability to\\nsupport arbitrary computation. However, these encodings are usually by\\nsimulating the entire Turing Machine within the language, or by encoding a\\nlanguage that does an encoding or simulation itself. This second category is\\ntypical for process calculi that show an encoding of lambda-calculus (often\\nwith restrictions) that in turn simulates a Turing Machine. Such approaches\\nlead to indirect encodings of Turing Machines that are complex, unclear, and\\nonly weakly equivalent after computation.

       "  'abstract': 'With the advent of cloud computing, a number of cloud providers have arisen\\nto provide Storage-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings to both regular consumers and\\nbusiness organizations. SaaS (different than Software-as-a-Service in this\\ncontext) refers to an architectural model in which a cloud provider provides\\ndigital storage on their own infrastructure. Three models exist amongst SaaS\\nproviders for protecting the confidentiality data stored in the cloud: 1) no\\nencryption (data is stored in plain text), 2) server-side encryption (data is\\nencrypted once uploaded), and 3) client-side encryption (data is encrypted\\nprior to upload). This paper seeks to identify weaknesses in the third model,\\nas it claims to offer 100% user data confidentiality throughout all data\\ntransactions (e.g., upload, download, sharing) through a combination of Network\\nTraffic Analysis, Source Code Decompilation, and Source Code Disassembly. The\\nweaknesses we uncovered primarily center around the fact that the cloud\\nproviders we evaluated were each operating in a Certificate Authority capacity\\nto facilitate data sharing. In this capacity, they assume the role of both\\ncertificate issuer and certificate authorizer as denoted in a Public-Key\\nInfrastructure (PKI) scheme - which gives them the ability to view user data\\ncontradicting their claims of 100% data confidentiality. We have collated our\\nanalysis and findings in this paper and explore some potential solutions to\\naddress these weaknesses in these sharing methods. The solutions proposed are a\\ncombination of best practices associated with the use of PKI and other\\ncryptographic primitives generally accepted for protecting the confidentiality\\nof shared information.',\n",

Under this strategy, we first characterize the\\nachievable secrecy rates of communication and prove that the achievable secure\\ndegrees-of-freedom (SDoF) is given by $d_s = n_r - n_j$ in the perfect channel\\nstate information (CSI) case. Second, we consider quantized CSI feedback using\\nGrassmannian quantization of a function of the direct channel matrix and derive\\nsufficient conditions for the quantization bit rate scaling as a function of\\ntransmit power for maintaining the achievable SDoF $d_s$ with perfect CSI and\\nfor having asymptotically zero secrecy rate loss due to quantization. Numerical\\nsimulations are also provided to support the theory.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In multi-user information theory it is often assumed that every node in the\\nnetwork possesses all codebooks used in the network. This assumption may be\\nimpractical in distributed ad-hoc, cognitive or heterogeneous networks. This\\nwork considers the two-user Interference Channel with one Oblivious Receiver\\n(IC-OR), i.e., one receiver lacks knowledge of the interfering cookbook while\\nthe other receiver knows both codebooks. The paper asks whether, and if so how\\nmuch, the channel capacity of the IC-OR is reduced compared to that of the\\nclassical IC where both receivers know all codebooks. A novel outer bound is\\nderived and shown to be achievable to within a gap for the class of injective\\nsemi-deterministic IC-ORs; the gap is shown to be zero for injective fully\\ndeterministic IC-ORs. For the linear deterministic IC-OR that models the\\nGaussian noise channel at high SNR, non i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits are\\nshown to achieve points not achievable by i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits used\\nin the same achievability scheme. For the real-valued Gaussian IC-OR the gap is\\nshown to be at most 1/2 bit per channel use, even though the set of optimal\\ninput distributions for the derived outer bound could not be determined.\\nTowards understanding the Gaussian IC-OR, an achievability strategy is\\nevaluated in which the input alphabets at the non-oblivious transmitter are a\\nmixture of discrete and Gaussian random variables, where the cardinality of the\\ndiscrete part is appropriately chosen as a function of the channel parameters.\\nSurprisingly, as the oblivious receiver intuitively should not be able to\\n'jointly decode' the intended and interfering messages (whose codebook is\\nunavailable), it is shown that with this choice of input, the capacity region\\nof the symmetric Gaussian IC-OR is to within 3.34 bits (per channel use per\\nuser) of an outer bound for the classical Gaussian IC with full codebook\\nknowledge.\",\n",

In the past two decades, a large body of literature in\\nstatistics and computer science has focused on providing lower-bounds on the\\nscaling of $|p-q|$ to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp\\nthreshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if $\\\\alpha=pn/\\\\log(n)$ and\\n$\\\\beta=qn/\\\\log(n)$ are constant (with $\\\\alpha>\\\\beta$), recovering the\\ncommunities with high probability is possible if $\\\\frac{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}{2} -\\n\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}>1$ and impossible if $\\\\frac{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta}{2} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha\\n\\\\beta}<1$. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a\\nnew line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood\\n(ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst-case\\nNP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite\\nprogramming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the\\ncommunities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest it may\\nachieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm which succeeds all the way down\\nto the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined\\nwith a local improvement procedure.',\n",

In\\ncomparison, we show that learning n-tuple networks is significantly more\\neffective if they involve a large number of systematically placed, short,\\nstraight n-tuples. Moreover, we demonstrate that in order to obtain the best\\nperformance and the steepest learning curve for Othello it is enough to use\\nn-tuples of size just 2, yielding a network consisting of only 288 weights. The\\nbest such network evolved in this study has been evaluated in the online\\nOthello League, obtaining the performance of nearly 96% --- more than any other\\nplayer to date.',\n",

As mobile devices nowadays are equipped with\\nmultiple wireless interfaces (e.g., WiFi and 3G/4G), aggregating bandwidth for\\nhigh definition video streaming has become possible.\\n  We propose a client-based video streaming solution, MSPlayer, that takes\\nadvantage of multiple video sources as well as multiple network paths through\\ndifferent interfaces. MSPlayer reduces start-up latency and provides high\\nquality video streaming and robust data transport in mobile scenarios.

A now standard method\\nfor recovering the unknown signal is to solve a convex optimization problem\\nthat enforces some prior knowledge about its structure. This has proved\\nefficient in many problems routinely encountered in imaging sciences,\\nstatistics and machine learning. This chapter delivers a review of recent\\nadvances in the field where the regularization prior promotes solutions\\nconforming to some notion of simplicity/low-complexity. These priors encompass\\nas popular examples sparsity and group sparsity (to capture the compressibility\\nof natural signals and images), total variation and analysis sparsity (to\\npromote piecewise regularity), and low-rank (as natural extension of sparsity\\nto matrix-valued data). Our aim is to provide a unified treatment of all these\\nregularizations under a single umbrella, namely the theory of partial\\nsmoothness. This framework is very general and accommodates all low-complexity\\nregularizers just mentioned, as well as many others. Partial smoothness turns\\nout to be the canonical way to encode low-dimensional models that can be linear\\nspaces or more general smooth manifolds. This review is intended to serve as a\\none stop shop toward the understanding of the theoretical properties of the\\nso-regularized solutions.

Together with\\nthe use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology\\nNetwork (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that\\nsupports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and\\nsimulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes\\na manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file\\nadding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing\\nthe model.

       "  'abstract': 'The Multiple Depot Ring-Star Problem (MDRSP) is an important combinatorial\\noptimization problem that arises in the context of optical fiber network\\ndesign, and in applications pertaining to collecting data using stationary\\nsensing devices and autonomous vehicles. Given the locations of a set of\\ncustomers and a set of depots, the goal is to (i) find a set of simple cycles\\nsuch that each cycle (ring) passes through a subset of customers and exactly\\none depot, (ii) assign each non-visited customer to a visited customer or a\\ndepot, and (iii) minimize the sum of the routing costs, i.e., the cost of the\\ncycles and the assignment costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming\\nformulation for the MDRSP and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the\\nlinear programming relaxation. Furthermore, we present a polyhedral analysis\\nand derive facet-inducing results for the MDRSP. All these results are then\\nused to develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to obtain optimal solutions to the\\nMDRSP. The performance of the branch-and-cut algorithm is evaluated through\\nextensive computational experiments on several classes of test instances.',\n",

Although SCBSs consume much less\\npower than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number\\nof SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base\\nstations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power\\nconsumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, traffic load balancing\\nis critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize\\nharvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization\\nas a performance metric in traffic load balancing strategies.

In this paper, we propose a way to address\\nthis issue by automatically segmenting an input sentence into phrases that can\\nbe easily translated by the neural network translation model. Once each segment\\nhas been independently translated by the neural machine translation model, the\\ntranslated clauses are concatenated to form a final translation.

       "  'abstract': 'Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical\\nmachine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine\\ntranslation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder\\nextracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence,\\nand the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In\\nthis paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine\\ntranslation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated\\nrecursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine\\ntranslation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words,\\nbut its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the\\nnumber of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated\\nrecursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence\\nautomatically.',\n",

However, a\\nmajor open problem, formulated by Gromov, is whether bounded degree high\\ndimensional expanders exist for $d \\\\geq 2$.\\n  We present an explicit construction of bounded degree complexes of dimension\\n$d=2$ which are topological expanders, thus answering Gromov's question in the\\naffirmative. Conditional on a conjecture of Serre on the congruence subgroup\\nproperty, infinite sub-family of these give also a family of bounded degree\\ncoboundary expanders.\\n  The main technical tools are new isoperimetric inequalities for Ramanujan\\nComplexes.
