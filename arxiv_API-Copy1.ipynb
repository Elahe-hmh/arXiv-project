Relation to observations</title>\\n    <summary>  In the paper by B\\\\\\'arta et al. (arXive:astro-ph:/1011.4035, 2010) the authors\\naddressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of\\nhigh-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of\\nenergy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet\\n(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are\\nformed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\\nprocesses. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly\\nfragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective\\nenergy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether\\nthis mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation\\nby deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The\\nresults of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a\\nspecific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded\\nin the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of\\nenergetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission\\nregions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of\\ndiffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and\\ndynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the\\nresults of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of\\nribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled\\nbright kernels. Comparing the predicted emission and its properties with the\\nobserved ones we obtain a good agreement of the two.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Miroslav B\\xc3\\xa1rta</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>J\\xc3\\xb6rg B\\xc3\\xbcchner</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Marian Karlick\\xc3\\xbd</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Pavel Kotrc</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">10.1088/0004-637X/730/1/47</arxiv:doi>\\n    <link title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/730/1/47\" rel=\"related\"/>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">7 pages, 5 figures</arxiv:comment>\\n    <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 730, Issue 1, article id. 47\\n  (2011)</arxiv:journal_ref>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6069v2\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.6069v2\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"astro-ph.SR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"astro-ph.SR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4667v2</id>\\n    <updated>2010-08-09T01:24:01Z</updated>\\n    <published>2010-05-25T19:26:56Z</published>\\n    <title>Proper motion and Photometric Variability of the Candidate Propotoplanet\\n  TMR-1C</title>\\n    <summary>  In their HST/NICMOS observations, Terebey et al. 1998 detected a candidate\\nprotoplanet, TMR-1C, that lies at a separation of about 10\" (~1000 AU) from the\\nClass I protobinary TMR-1 (IRAS 04361+2547) located in the Taurus molecular\\ncloud.

      "addressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of\n",

      "energy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet\n",

      "formed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\n",
