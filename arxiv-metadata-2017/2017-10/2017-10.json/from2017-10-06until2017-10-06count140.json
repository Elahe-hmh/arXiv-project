Among the many dynamical processes\ninvolving networks, propagation processes -- in which final state can be\nobtained by studying the underlying network percolation properties -- have\nraised formidable interest. In this paper, we present a bond percolation model\nof multitype networks with an arbitrary joint degree distribution that allows\nheterogeneity in the edge occupation probability. As previously demonstrated,\nthe multitype approach allows many non-trivial mixing patterns such as\nassortativity and clustering between nodes. We derive a number of useful\nstatistical properties of multitype networks as well as a general phase\ntransition criterion. We also demonstrate that a number of previous models\nbased on probability generating functions are special cases of the proposed\nformalism. We further show that the multitype approach, by naturally allowing\nheterogeneity in the bond occupation probability, overcomes some of the\ncorrelation issues encountered by previous models. We illustrate this point in\nthe context of contact network epidemiology.\n", "  High energy scattering processes involving jets generically involve matrix\nelements of light- like Wilson lines, known as soft functions. These describe\nthe structure of soft contributions to observables and encode color and\nkinematic correlations between jets. We compute the dijet soft function to\nO({\\alpha}_s^2) as a function of the two jet invariant masses, focusing on\nterms not determined by its renormalization group evolution that have a\nnon-separable dependence on these masses. Our results include non-global single\nand double logarithms, and analytic results for the full set of non-logarithmic\ncontributions as well. Using a recent result for the thrust constant, we\npresent the complete O({\\alpha}_s^2) soft function for dijet production in both\nposition and momentum space.\n", "  Empirically determining the averaged variations of the orbital parameters of\nthe stars orbiting the Supermassive Black Hole (SBH) hosted by the Galactic\nCentre (GC) in Sgr A* is, in principle, a valuable tool to put on the test the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity (GTR), in regimes far stronger than those tested\nso far, and certain key predictions of it like the no-hair theorems. We\nanalytically work out the long-term variations of all the six osculating\nKeplerian orbital elements of a test particle orbiting a non-spherical,\nrotating body with quadrupole moment Q_2 and angular momentum S for a generic\nspatial orientation of its spin axis k. This choice is motivated by the fact\nthat, basically, we do not know the position in the sky of the spin axis of the\nSBH in Sgr A* with sufficient accuracy. We apply our results to S2, which is\nthe closest star discovered so far having an orbital period P_b = 15.98 yr, and\nto a hypothetical closer star X with P_b = 0.5 yr. Our calculations are quite\ngeneral, not being related to any specific parameterization of k, and can be\napplied also to astrophysical binary systems, stellar planetary systems, and\nplanetary satellite geodesy in which different reference frames, generally not\naligned with the primary's rotational axis, are routinely used.\n", "  We introduce a formalism for computing bond percolation properties of a class\nof correlated and clustered random graphs. This class of graphs is a\ngeneralization of the Configuration Model where nodes of different types are\nconnected via different types of hyperedges, edges that can link more than 2\nnodes. We argue that the multitype approach coupled with the use of clustered\nhyperedges can reproduce a wide spectrum of complex patterns, and thus enhances\nour capability to model real complex networks. As an illustration of this\nclaim, we use our formalism to highlight unusual behaviors of the size and\ncomposition of the components (small and giant) in a synthetic, albeit\nrealistic, social network.\n", "  Many people are aware of the theory of elastic fracture originated by AA\nGriffith, and although Griffith used the theorem of minimum potential energy\nmost people seem unaware of the broader implications of this theorem. If it is\nset within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted\nform of a Lagrangian.\n  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the\nrole of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced\ntexts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included\nor not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the\nfundamentals of fracture.\n  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the\nconcept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave\nunloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress\nfield. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and\nthis model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic\nmaterials to include crack tip plasticity.\n  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to\nestablish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives\nsignificant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the\ninfluence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,\ncalled the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised. The new form of the\nfatigue crack growth relationship derived answers many of the long standing\nquestions about the Paris Law.\n", "  We study rain water infiltration and drainage in a dry model sandy soil with\nsuperabsorbent hydrogel particle additives by measuring the mass of retained\nwater for non-ponding rainfall using a self-built 3D laboratory set-up. In the\npure model sandy soil, the retained water curve measurements indicate that\ninstead of a stable horizontal wetting front that grows downward uniformly, a\nnarrow fingered flow forms under the top layer of water-saturated soil. This\nrain water channelization phenomenon not only further reduces the available\nrain water in the plant root zone, but also affects the efficiency of soil\nadditives, such as superabsorbent hydrogel particles. Our studies show that the\nshape of the retained water curve for a soil packing with hydrogel particle\nadditives strongly depends on the location and the concentration of the\nhydrogel particles in the model sandy soil. By carefully choosing the particle\nsize and distribution methods, we may use the swollen hydrogel particles to\nmodify the soil pore structure, to clog or extend the water channels in sandy\nsoils, or to build water reservoirs in the plant root zone.\n", "  We construct a class of spacetimes (without symmetry assumptions) satisfying\nthe vacuum Einstein equations with singular boundaries on two null\nhypersurfaces intersecting in the future on a 2-sphere. The metric of these\nspacetimes extends continuously beyond the singularities while the Christoffel\nsymbols fail to be square integrable in a neighborhood of any point on the\nsingular boundaries. The construction shows moreover that the singularities are\nstable in a suitable sense. These singularities are stronger than the impulsive\ngravitational spacetimes considered by Luk-Rodnianski and conjecturally they\nare present in the interior of generic black holes arising from gravitational\ncollapse.\n", "  We develop a Lagrangian approach to conservation-law anomalies in weak\nsolutions of inviscid Burgers equation, motivated by previous work on the\nKraichnan model of turbulent scalar advection. We show that the entropy\nsolutions of Burgers possess Markov stochastic processes of (generalized)\nLagrangian trajectories backward in time for which the Burgers velocity is a\nbackward martingale. This property is shown to guarantee dissipativity of\nconservation-law anomalies for general convex functions of the velocity. The\nbackward stochastic Burgers flows with these properties are not unique,\nhowever. We construct infinitely many such stochastic flows, both by a\ngeometric construction and by the zero-noise limit of the Constantin-Iyer\nstochastic representation of viscous Burgers solutions. The latter proof yields\nthe spontaneous stochasticity of Lagrangian trajectories backward in time for\nBurgers, at unit Prandtl number. It is conjectured that existence of a backward\nstochastic flow with the velocity as martingale is an admissibility condition\nwhich selects the unique entropy solution for Burgers. We also study linear\ntransport of passive densities and scalars by inviscid Burgers flows. We show\nthat shock solutions of Burgers exhibit spontaneous stochasticity backward in\ntime for all Prandtl numbers, implying conservation-law anomalies for linear\ntransport. We discuss the relation of our results for Burgers with\nincompressible Navier-Stokes turbulence, especially Lagrangian admissibility\nconditions for Euler solutions and the relation between turbulent cascade\ndirections and time-asymmetry of Lagrangian stochasticity.\n", "  The orbital dynamics of a test particle moving in the non-spherically\nsymmetric field of a rotating oblate primary is impacted also by certain\nindirect, mixed effects arising from the interplay of the different Newtonian\nand post-Newtonian accelerations which induce known direct perturbations. We\nsystematically calculate the indirect gravitoelectromagnetic shifts per orbit\nof the Keplerian orbital elements of the test particle arising from the\ncrossing among the first even zonal harmonic $J_2$ of the central body and the\npost-Newtonian static and stationary components of its gravitational field. We\nalso work out the Newtonian shifts per orbit of order $J_2^2$, and the direct\npost-Newtonian gravitoelectric effects of order $J_2 c^{-2}$ arising from the\nequations of motion. In the case of both the indirect and direct\ngravitoelectric $J_2 c^{-2}$ shifts, our calculation holds for an arbitrary\norientation of the symmetry axis of the central body. We yield numerical\nestimates of their relative magnitudes for systems ranging from Earth\nartificial satellites to stars orbiting supermassive black holes.\n", "  We study the symmetry and strength of the superconducting pairing in a\ntwo-orbital t-J1-J2-K model for iron pnictides using the salve boson mean-field\ntheory. We show that the nearest-neighbor biquadratic interaction -K (S_i *\nS_j)^2 inflences the superconducting pairing phase diagram by promoting the\nd_{x2-y2} B_{1g} and the s_{x^2+y^2} A_{1g} channels. The resulting phase\ndiagram consists of several competing pairing channels, including an isotropic\ns_{\\pm} A_{1g} channel, an anisotropic d_{x2-y2} B_{1g} channel, and two s+id\npairing channels. We have investigated the evolution of superconducting states\nwith electron doping, and find that with the biquadratic interaction various\npairing channels may dominate at different doping concentrations. We show that\nthis is crucial in understanding the doping evolution of superconducting gap\nanisotropy observed in some angle resolved photoemission spectrum measurements.\n", "  We present a numerical model developed to calculate observed fluxes of\nrelativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. The observed flux of each\nturbulent eddy is dependent upon its variable Doppler boosting factor, computed\nas a function of the relativistic sum of the individual eddy and bulk jet\nvelocities and our viewing angle to the jet. The total observed flux is found\nby integrating the radiation from the eddies over the turbulent spectrum. We\nconsider jets that contain turbulent eddies that have either standard\nKolmogorov or recently derived relativistic turbulence spectra. We also account\nfor the time delays in receiving the emission of the eddies due to their\ndifferent simulated positions in the jet, as well as due to the varying beaming\ndirections as they turn over. We examine these theoretical light curves and\ncompute power spectral densities (PSDs) for a range of viewing angles, bulk\nvelocities of the jet, and turbulent velocities. These PSD slopes depend\nsignificantly on the turbulent velocity and are essentially independent of\nviewing angle and bulk velocity. The flux variations produced in the\nsimulations for realistic values of the parameters tested are consistent with\nthe types of variations observed in radio-loud AGN as, for example, recently\nmeasured with the Kepler satellite, as long as the turbulent velocities are not\ntoo high.\n", "  A scheme of simplified smooth hybrid inflation is realized in the framework\nof supersymmetric $SU(5)$. The smooth model of hybrid inflation provides a\nnatural solution to the monopole problem that appears in the breaking of\n$SU(5)$ gauge symmetry. The supergravity corrections with nonminimal K\\\"ahler\npotential are shown to play important role in realizing inflation with a\nred-tilted scalar spectral index $n_s <1$, within Planck's latest bounds. As\ncompared to shifted model of hybrid inflation, relatively large values of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\lesssim 0.01$ are achieved here, with nonminimal\ncouplings $-0.05 \\lesssim \\kappa_S \\lesssim 0.01$ and $-1 \\lesssim \\kappa_{SS}\n\\lesssim 1$ and the gauge symmetry-breaking scale $M \\simeq (2.0 - 16.7) \\times\n10^{16}$ GeV.\n", "  The Duflo map is a valuable tool for operator ordering in contexts in which\nKirillov-Kostant brackets and their quantizations play a role. A priori, the\nDuflo map is only defined on the subspace of the symmetric algebra over a Lie\nalgebra consisting of elements invariant under the adjoint action. Here we\ndiscuss extensions to the whole symmetric algebra, as well as their application\nto the calculation of Chern-Simons theory expectation values.\n", "  The rupture of double-stranded DNA under stress is a key process in\nbiophysics and nanotechnology. In this article we consider the shear-induced\nrupture of short DNA duplexes, a system that has been given new importance by\nrecently designed force sensors and nanotechnological devices. We argue that\nrupture must be understood as an activated process, where the duplex state is\nmetastable and the strands will separate in a finite time that depends on the\nduplex length and the force applied. Thus, the critical shearing force required\nto rupture a duplex within a given experiment depends strongly on the time\nscale of observation. We use simple models of DNA to demonstrate that this\napproach naturally captures the experimentally observed dependence of the\ncritical force on duplex length for a given observation time. In particular,\nthe critical force is zero for the shortest duplexes, before rising sharply and\nthen plateauing in the long length limit. The prevailing approach, based on\nidentifying when the presence of each additional base pair within the duplex is\nthermodynamically unfavorable rather than allowing for metastability, does not\npredict a time-scale-dependent critical force and does not naturally\nincorporate a critical force of zero for the shortest duplexes. Additionally,\nmotivated by a recently proposed force sensor, we investigate application of\nstress to a duplex in a mixed mode that interpolates between shearing and\nunzipping. As with pure shearing, the critical force depends on the time scale\nof observation; at a fixed time scale and duplex length, the critical force\nexhibits a sigmoidal dependence on the fraction of the duplex that is subject\nto shearing.\n", "  Hydrodynamics can be formulated as the gradient expansion of conserved\ncurrents in terms of the fundamental fields describing the near-equilibrium\nfluid flow. In the relativistic case, the Navier-Stokes equations follow from\nthe conservation of the stress-energy tensor to first order in derivatives. In\nthis paper, we go beyond the presently understood second-order hydrodynamics\nand discuss the systematisation of obtaining the hydrodynamic expansion to an\narbitrarily high order. As an example of the algorithm that we present, we\nfully classify the gradient expansion at third order for neutral fluids in four\ndimensions, thus finding the most general next-to-leading-order corrections to\nthe relativistic Navier-Stokes equations in curved space-time. In doing so, we\nlist $20$ new transport coefficient candidates in the conformal and $68$ in the\nnon-conformal case. As we do not consider any constraints that could\npotentially arise from the local entropy current analysis, this is the maximal\npossible set of neutral third-order transport coefficients. To investigate the\nphysical implications of these new transport coefficients, we obtain the\nthird-order corrections to the linear dispersion relations that describe the\npropagation of diffusion and sound waves in relativistic fluids. We also\ncompute the corrections to the scalar (spin-$2$) two-point correlation function\nof the third-order stress-energy tensor. Furthermore, as an example of a\nnon-linear hydrodynamic flow, we calculate the third-order corrections to the\nenergy density of a boost-invariant Bjorken flow. Finally, we apply our field\ntheoretic results to the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills fluid at\ninfinite 't Hooft coupling and infinite number of colours to find the values of\nfive new linear combinations of the conformal transport coefficients.\n", "  The gravitational field of a galaxy can act as a lens and deflect the light\nemitted by a more distant object such as a quasar. Strong gravitational lensing\ncauses multiple images of the same quasar to appear in the sky. Since the light\nin each gravitationally lensed image traverses a different path length from the\nquasar to the Earth, fluctuations in the source brightness are observed in the\nseveral images at different times. The time delay between these fluctuations\ncan be used to constrain cosmological parameters and can be inferred from the\ntime series of brightness data or light curves of each image. To estimate the\ntime delay, we construct a model based on a state-space representation for\nirregularly observed time series generated by a latent continuous-time\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. We account for microlensing, an additional source\nof independent long-term extrinsic variability, via a polynomial regression.\nOur Bayesian strategy adopts a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler. We\nimprove the sampler by using an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy\nand adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce a profile likelihood of the\ntime delay as an approximation of its marginal posterior distribution. The\nBayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing\nalmost identical results; the Bayesian method is more principled but the\nprofile likelihood is simpler to implement. We demonstrate our estimation\nstrategy using simulated data of doubly- and quadruply-lensed quasars, and\nobserved data from quasars Q0957+561 and J1029+2623.\n", "  In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed\ngranular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in\nanalogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent\nathermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed\nmatter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and\nexperimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based\non the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of\nmicrocanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which\nreplaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation\nschemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for\nensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force\ndistributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and\nexperiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong\nassumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results\nsuggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A\ntheoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from\nspherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids,\nspherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and\nadhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is\ndiscussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed\nmatter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable\njammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights\nthat the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem\nfor excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying\nframework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and\nout-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.\n", "  Electromagnetic particle simulation model has been formulated and verified\nfor nonlinear processes of lower hybrid (LH) waves in fusion plasmas. Electron\ndynamics is described by the drift kinetic equation using either kinetic\nmomentum or canonical momentum. Ion dynamics is treated as the fluid system or\nby the Vlasov equation. Compressible magnetic perturbation is retained to\nsimulate both the fast and slow LH waves. Numerical properties are greatly\nimproved by using electron continuity equation to enforce consistency between\nelectrostatic potential and vector potential, and by using the importance\nsampling technique. The simulation model has been implemented in the\ngyrokinetic toroidal code (GTC), and verified for the dispersion relation and\nnonlinear particle trapping of the electromagnetic LH waves.\n", "  A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily,\nwhich suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely to\nconnect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structures\nembedded in common neighbors have on link formation is much less\nwell-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing the\nstructural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120\nlarge-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhood\ndiversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find\nthat its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on LinkedIn suggest\ndifferent underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover\nstriking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily---that is,\nwhere fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each\nother. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood\nsignature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique\nnetwork superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findings\nshed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structures\nare organized and formed, pointing to potential advancement in designing graph\ngeneration models and recommender systems.\n", "  The 2017 Nobel Prize in physics awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and\nKip S. Thorne has generated unprecedented interest in gravitational waves\n(GWs). These notes are based on my lectures on various occasions - in the\nUniversity of Delhi as well as in different GW schools held in India following\nthe exciting direct detection of GWs. I discuss GW flux and luminosity while\npointing out a curious aspect associated with the latter - physical dimensions\nof $c^5/G$ as well as third time derivative of mass quadrupole moment are that\nof luminosity. Formation of primordial black holes in the early universe and\nprogenitors of fast radio bursts could have generated GW luminosity comparable\nto the Planck luminosity, $c^5/G$. I also address the issue of black hole\nthermodynamics in connection with the GW150914 event, demonstrating that this\nevent is consistent with Hawking's black hole area theorem. In the last\nsection, as an illustrative exercise, I estimate the GW amplitude expected from\nthe fast moving plasma bullets that have been shot out from the vicinity of the\ncarbon star V Hydrae, as reported recently by Sahai et al. (2016).\n", "  Fundamentally, the dynamics of micro-macro transitions is instrumental to\nunderstanding the process of quantum-to-classical transitions; technologically,\nit can also facilitate the detection of the microscopic signals in quantum\nexperiments via convenient detectors. Here, we demonstrate a scheme to\ncharacterize micro-macro transitions based on a four-wave mixing linear optical\namplification process in a hot rubidium vapor. The linear optical amplifier\nprovides a large optical gain of $10^7$ for injected single-photon-level\npulses, enabling photon-number-resolving detection by average via\nnon-single-photon counting detectors with a large dynamic range. The scheme\nexhibits strong dispersion which is sensitive to the input's change at the\nsingle-photon level, resulting in the group-velocity delay time scaling with\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the average input photon number. The output probe\nand conjugate modes have different coefficients of this $1/\\sqrt{N}$ scaling,\nindicating the coefficient can serve as an efficient parameter to characterize\nthe specified micro-macro transitions. The demonstrated results are generally\napplicable for quantum detection and optical signal processing in light-atom\ninterfaces. Furthermore, the present system is suitable for the study of\nrelevant time-resolved dynamics of the quantum-to-classical transitions.\n", "  Quantum walks constitute a versatile platform for simulating transport\nphenomena on discrete graphs including topological material properties while\nproviding a high control over the relevant parameters at the same time. To\nexperimentally access and directly measure the topological invariants of\nquantum walks we implement the scattering scheme proposed by Tarasinski et\nal.[Phys. Rev. A 89, 042327 (2014)] in a photonic time multiplexed quantum walk\nexperiment. The tunable coin operation provides opportunity to reach distinct\ntopological phases, and accordingly to observe the corresponding topological\nphase transitions. The ability to read-out the position and the coin state\ndistribution, complemented by explicit interferometric sign measurements,\nallowed the reconstruction of the scattered reflection amplitudes and thus the\ncomputation of the associated bulk topological invariants. As predicted we also\nfind localised states at the edges between two bulks belonging to different\ntopological phases. In order to analyse the impact of disorder we have measured\ninvariants of two different types of disordered samples in large ensemble\nmeasurements, demonstrating their constancy in one disorder regime and a\ncontinuous transition with increasing disorder strength for the second disorder\nsample.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of \"age-specific small worlds\"\nusing data from a large-scale mobile communication network approximating\ninteraction patterns at societal scale. Rather than asking whether two random\nindividuals are separated by a small number of links, we ask whether\nindividuals in specific age groups live in a small world in relation to\nindividuals from other age groups. Our analysis shows that there is systematic\nvariation in this age-relative small world effect. Young people live in the\n\"smallest world,\" being separated from other young people and their parent's\ngeneration via a smaller number of intermediaries than older individuals. The\noldest people live in the \"least small world,\" being separated from their same\nage peers and their younger counterparts by a larger number of intermediaries.\nVariation in the small world effect is specific to age as a node attribute\n(being absent in the case of gender) and is consistently observed under several\ndata robustness checks. The discovery of age-specific small worlds is\nconsistent with well-known social mechanisms affecting the way age interacts\nwith network connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kin\nties observed in this network. This social pattern has significant implications\nfor our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades,\ndiffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions.\n", "  Crystallization, a prototypical self-organization process during which a\ndisordered state spontaneously transforms into a crystal characterized by a\nregular arrangement of its building blocks, usually proceeds by nucleation and\ngrowth. In the initial stages of the transformation, a localized nucleus of the\nnew phase forms in the old one due to a random fluctuation. Most of these\nnuclei disappear after a short time, but rarely a crystalline embryo may reach\na critical size after which further growth becomes thermodynamically favorable\nand the entire system is converted into the new phase. In these lecture notes,\nwe will discuss several theoretical concepts and computational methods to study\ncrystallization. More specifically, we will address the rare event problem\narising in the simulation of nucleation processes and explain how to calculate\nnucleation rates accurately. Particular attention is directed towards\ndiscussing statistical tools to analyze crystallization trajectories and\nidentify the transition mechanism.\n", "  We derive the formula of the entanglement entropy between the left and right\noscillating modes of the $\\sigma$-model with the de Sitter target space. To\nthis end, we study the theory in the \\emph{cosmological gauge} in which the\nnon-vanishing components of the metric on the two-dimensional base space are\nfunctions of the expansion parameter of the de Sitter space. The model is\nembedded in the causal north pole diamond of the Penrose diagram. We argue that\nthe cosmological gauge is natural to the $\\sigma$-model as it is compatible\nwith the canonical quantization relations. In this gauge, we obtain a new\ngeneral solution to the equations of motion in terms of time-independent\noscillating modes. The constraint structure is adequate for quantization in the\nGupta-Bleuler formalism. We construct the space of states as a one-parameter\nfamily of Hilbert spaces and give the Bargmann-Fock and Jordan-Schwinger\nrepresentations of it. Also, we give a simple description of the physical\nsubspace as an infinite product of $\\mathcal{D}^{+}_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ in the\npositive discreet series irreducible representations of the $SU(1,1)$ group. We\nconstruct the map generated by the Hamiltonian between states at two different\nvalues of time and show how it produces the entanglement of left and right\nexcitations. Next, we derive the formula of the entanglement entropy of the\nreduced density matrix for the ground state acted upon by the Hamiltonian map.\nFinally, we determine the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy of a\nsingle mode bi-oscillator in the limit of large values of time.\n", "  Nickel nanoparticles were dispersed on the surface of exfoliated black\nphosphorus and the resulting nanohybrid Ni/2DBP showed an improved stability\nrespect to pristine 2D BP when kept in ambient conditions in the darkness.\nNi/2DBP was applied as catalyst in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene and\nexhibited high conversion and selectivity towards styrene. These features were\npreserved after recycling tests revealing the high stability of the nanohybrid.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a modified covariant quantum algebra based in the\nso-called Quesne-Tkachuk algebra. By means of a deformation procedure we arrive\nat a class of higher derivative models of gravity. The study of the particle\nspectra of these models reveals an equivalence with the physical content of the\nwell-known renormalizable and super-renormalizable higher derivative gravities.\nThe particle spectrum exhibits the presence of spurious complex ghosts and, in\nlight of this problem, we suggest an interesting interpretation in the context\nof minimal length theories. Also, a discussion regarding the non-relativistic\npotential energy is proposed.\n", "  The explicit filtering method for large eddy simulation (LES,) which\ncomprises integration of the governing equations without any added terms for\nsub-grid-scale modeling, and the application of a low-pass filter to\ntransported fields, is discussed. The shapes of filter response functions of\nnumerical schemes for spatial derivatives and the explicit filter, that have\nbeen used for several LES, are examined. Generally, these are flat (no\nfiltering) over a range of low wavenumbers, and then fall off over a small\nrange of the highest represented wavenumbers. It is argued that this high\nwavenumber part can be viewed as a spectral buffer analogous to physical buffer\n(or sponge) zones used near outflow boundaries. The monotonic convergence of\nthis approach to a direct numerical simulation, and the shifting of the\nspectral buffer to larger wavenumbers as the represented spectral range is\nincreased, without altering the low wavenumber part of solutions, is\ndemonstrated with LES of two sample flows. Connections to other widely used\nmethods---the Smagorinsky model, MILES and another ILES---are also explained.\n", "  We propose a nanodevice based on a typical planar semiconductor\nheterostructure with lateral confinement potential created by voltages applied\nto local electrodes. We show how to obtain near parabolical confinement along\nthe nanodevice, and how to use coherent states of the harmonic oscillator for\nspatial separation of electron densities corresponding to opposite spin\ndirections. In such a way, an entangled state of Schr\\\"odinger's cat type is\ncreated. We performed simulations of a realistic nanodevice model by numerical\nsolving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger's equation together with simultaneous\ntracking of the controllable confinement potential via solution of the\nPoisson's equation at every time step.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium steady state of the driven-dissipative\nBose-Hubbard model with Kerr nonlinearity. Employing a mean-field decoupling\nfor the intercavity hopping $J$, we find that the steep crossover between low\nand high photon-density states inherited from the single cavity transforms into\na gas$-$liquid bistability at large cavity-coupling $J$. We formulate a van der\nWaals like gas$-$liquid phenomenology for this nonequilibrium situation and\ndetermine the relevant phase diagrams, including a new type of diagram where a\nlobe-shaped boundary separates smooth crossovers from sharp, hysteretic\ntransitions. Calculating quantum trajectories for a one-dimensional system, we\nprovide insights into the microscopic origin of the bistability.\n", "  We get point vortices dynamics equations on a rotating sphere surface\ndirectly from the hydrodynamic equations as representing their weak exact\nsolution contrary to the conventional case of the use of a kinematic\nrelationship between a given singular vortex field and velocity field. It is\nfirst time that the effect of a sphere rotation on the vortices interaction is\naccounted for in exact form. We show that only the stream function of a vortex\npair of antipodal vortices (APV), and only it satisfies the original\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamics equations on a sphere. We prove that only APV\npair with two point vortices in the diameter-conjugated points of a sphere with\nequal by quantity but different sign circulations may be correctly considered\nas an elementary (stationary, not self-affecting) singular point object on a\nsphere. We suggest using the axis connecting the two point vortices in an APV\nfor describing of an axis of rotation of the global vortices introduced in\n(Barrett, 1958) to reflect the observed global rotation of atmospheric masses\nwith the rotation axes not coinciding with the planet rotation axis and\nprecessing about it. Up to now, the question about interaction of global\nvortices corresponding to such solutions with rotations about different axis\nwas not even posed. This is the first model describing interaction of the\nBarrett-type global vortices corresponding to atmospheric centers of action\n(ACA). The new steady-state and its stability conditions for N=2 are obtained\nand used for the analysis of coupled cyclone-anticyclone ACAs over oceans in\nthe Northern Hemisphere. On the base of corresponding exact solutions, we show\nacceptability of modelling of the stable blocks of splitting flow type when in\nline with the exact accounting for the sphere rotation, we define also\nconditions of the polar vortices affecting on the stability boundaries of the\nblock modes.\n", "  e-ASTROGAM (`enhanced ASTROGAM') is a breakthrough Observatory mission\ndedicated to the study of the non-thermal Universe in the photon energy range\nfrom 0.3 MeV to 3 GeV. The mission is based on an advanced space-proven\ndetector technology, with unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy\nresolution, combined with polarimetric capability. In the largely unexplored\nMeV-GeV domain, e-ASTROGAM will open a new window on the non-thermal Universe,\nmaking pioneering observations of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic\nsources, elucidating the nature of their relativistic outflows and their\neffects on Galactic ecosystems. With a line sensitivity in the MeV energy range\none to two orders of magnitude better than previous generation instruments,\nwill determine the origin of key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of\nsupernova explosion and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will\nprovide unique data of significant interest to a broad astronomical community,\ncomplementary to powerful observatories such as LIGO-Virgo-GEO600-KAGRA, SKA,\nALMA, E-ELT, TMT, LSST, JWST, Athena, CTA, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the promise of\neLISA.\n  Keywords: High-energy gamma-ray astronomy, High-energy astrophysics, Nuclear\nAstrophysics, Compton and Pair creation telescope, Gamma-ray bursts, Active\nGalactic Nuclei, Jets, Outflows, Multiwavelength observations of the Universe,\nCounterparts of gravitational waves, Fermi, Dark Matter, Nucleosynthesis, Early\nUniverse, Supernovae, Cosmic Rays, Cosmic antimatter.\n", "  Under certain conditions, two samples of fluid at different initial\ntemperatures present a counterintuitive behavior known as the Mpemba effect: it\nis the hotter system that cools sooner. Here, we show that the Mpemba effect is\npresent in granular fluids, both in uniformly heated and in freely cooling\nsystems. In both cases, the system remains homogeneous, and no phase transition\nis present. Analytical quantitative predictions are given for how differently\nthe system must be initially prepared to observe the Mpemba effect, the\ntheoretical predictions being confirmed by both molecular dynamics and Monte\nCarlo simulations. Possible implications of our analysis for other systems are\nalso discussed.\n", "  The quantum Rabi model describes the fundamental mechanism of light-matter\ninteraction. It consists of a two-level atom or qubit coupled to a quantized\nharmonic mode via a transversal interaction. In the weak coupling regime, it\nreduces to the well-known Jaynes-Cummings model by applying a rotating wave\napproximation (RWA). The RWA breaks down in the ultra-strong coupling (USC)\nregime, where the effective coupling strength $g$ is comparable to the energy\n$\\omega$ of the bosonic mode, and remarkable features in the system dynamics\nare revealed. We demonstrate an analog quantum simulation of an effective\nquantum Rabi model in the USC regime, achieving a relative coupling ratio of\n$g/\\omega \\sim 0.6$. The quantum hardware of the simulator is a superconducting\ncircuit embedded in a cQED setup. We observe fast and periodic quantum state\ncollapses and revivals of the initial qubit state, being the most distinct\nsignature of the synthesized model.\n", "  Topological defects are singularities in material fields that play a vital\nrole across a range of systems: from cosmic microwave background polarization\nto superconductors, and biological materials. Although topological defects and\ntheir mutual interactions have been extensively studied, little is known about\nthe interplay between defects in different fields -- especially when they\nco-evolve -- within the same physical system. Here, using nematic\nmicrofluidics, we study the cross-talk of topological defects in two different\nmaterial fields -- the velocity field and the molecular orientational field.\nSpecifically, we generate hydrodynamic stagnation points of different\ntopological charges at the center of star-shaped microfluidic junctions, which\nthen interact with emergent topological defects in the orientational field of\nthe nematic director. We combine experiments, and analytical and numerical\ncalculations to demonstrate that a hydrodynamic singularity of given\ntopological charge can nucleate a nematic defect of equal topological charge,\nand corroborate this by creating $-1$, $-2$ and $-3$ topological defects in\n$4-$, $6-$, and $8-$arm junctions. Our work is an attempt toward understanding\nmaterials that are governed by distinctly multi-field topology, where disparate\ntopology-carrying fields are coupled, and concertedly determine the material\nproperties and response.\n", "  Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids crystallize\ninto a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong\nelectron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In\ngeometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without\nlong-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic\nmaterial with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated\nwith crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in\nthe context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO\npatterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes\nthat characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization\nof electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of\nthe liquid-glass transition.\n", "  We develop a general framework for the open dynamics of an ensemble of\nquantum particles subject to spacetime fluctuations about the flat background.\nAn arbitrary number of interacting bosonic and fermionic particles are\nconsidered. A systematic approach to the generation of gravitational waves in\nthe quantum domain is presented that recovers known classical limits in terms\nof the quadrupole radiation formula and backreaction dissipation. Classical\ngravitational emission and absorption relations are quantized into their\nquantum field theoretical counterparts in terms of the corresponding operators\nand quantum ensemble averages. Certain arising consistency issues related to\nfactor ordering have been addressed and resolved. Using the theoretical\nformulation established here with numerical simulations in the quantum regime,\nwe discuss potential new effects including decoherence through the spontaneous\nemission of gravitons and collectively amplified radiation of gravitational\nwaves by correlated quantum particles.\n", "  Zika virus (ZIKV) exhibits unique transmission dynamics in that it is\nconcurrently spread by a mosquito vector and through sexual contact. We show\nthat this sexual component of ZIKV transmission induces novel processes on\nnetworks through the highly asymmetric durations of infectiousness between\nmales and females -- it is estimated that males are infectious for periods up\nto ten times longer than females -- leading to an asymmetric percolation\nprocess on the network of sexual contacts. We exactly solve the properties of\nthis asymmetric percolation on random sexual contact networks and show that\nthis process exhibits two epidemic transitions corresponding to a\ncore-periphery structure. This structure is not present in the underlying\ncontact networks, which are not distinguishable from random networks, and\nemerges because of the asymmetric percolation. We provide an exact analytical\ndescription of this double transition and discuss the implications of our\nresults in the context of ZIKV epidemics. Most importantly, our study suggests\na bias in our current ZIKV surveillance as the community most at risk is also\none of the least likely to get tested.\n", "  The top-quark mass is measured in the all-hadronic top-antitop quark decay\nchannel using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$\n= 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data set\nused in the analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$.\nThe large multi-jet background is modelled using a data-driven method. The\ntop-quark mass is obtained from template fits to the ratio of the three-jet to\nthe dijet mass. The three-jet mass is obtained from the three jets assigned to\nthe top quark decay. From these three jets the dijet mass is obtained using the\ntwo jets assigned to the W boson decay. The top-quark mass is measured to be\n173.72 $\\pm$ 0.55 (stat.) $\\pm$ 1.01 (syst.) GeV.\n", "  A representation of the two-loop contribution to the pion decay constant in\n$SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory is presented. The result is analytic upto\nthe contribution of the three (different) mass sunset integrals, for which an\nexpansion in their external momentum has been taken. We also give an analytic\nexpression for the two-loop contribution to the pion mass based on a\nrenormalized representation and in terms of the physical eta mass. We find an\nexpansion of $F_{\\pi}$ and $M_{\\pi}^2$ in the strange quark mass in the isospin\nlimit, and perform the matching of the chiral SU(2) and SU(3) low energy\nconstants. A numerical analysis demonstrates the high accuracy of our\nrepresentation, and the strong dependence of the pion decay constant upon the\nvalues of the low energy constants, especially in the chiral limit. Finally, we\npresent a simplified representation that is particularly suitable for fitting\nwith available lattice data.\n", "  We obtain a new class of topological black hole solutions in\n$(n+1)$-dimensional massive gravity in the presence of the power-Maxwell\nelectrodynamics. We calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the\nsystem and show that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied on the\nhorizon. Then, we investigate the holographic conductivity for the four and\nfive dimensional black brane solutions. For completeness, we study the\nholographic conductivity for both massless ($m=0$) and massive ($m \\neq 0$)\ngravities with power-Maxwell field. The massless gravity enjoys translational\nsymmetry whereas the massive gravity violates it. For massless gravity, we\nobserve that the real part of conductivity, $\\mathrm{Re}[\\sigma]$, decreases as\ncharge $q$ increases when frequency $\\omega $ tends to zero, while the\nimaginary part of conductivity, $\\mathrm{Im}[\\sigma ]$, diverges as $\\omega\n\\rightarrow 0$. For the massive gravity, we find that $\\mathrm{Im}[\\sigma ]$ is\nzero at $\\omega =0$ and becomes larger as $q$\\ increases (temperature\ndecreases), which is in contrast to the massless gravity. Interestingly, we\nobserve that in contrast to the massless case, $\\mathrm{Re}[\\sigma ]$ has a\nmaximum value at $\\omega =0$ (known as the Drude peak) for $p=\\left( n+1\\right)\n/4$ (conformally invariant electrodynamics) where $p$ is the power parameter of\nthe power-law Maxwell field and this maximum increases with increasing $q$.\nFinally, we show that for high frequencies, the real part of the holographic\nconductivity have the power law behavior in terms of frequency, $\\omega ^{a}$\nwhere $a \\propto (n+1-4p)$. Some similar behaviors for high frequencies in\npossible dual CFT systems have been reported in experimental observations.\n", "  We present a working concept for Phase III of the Project 8 experiment,\naiming to achieve a neutrino mass sensitivity of $2~\\mathrm{eV}$ ($90~\\%$ C.L.)\nusing a large volume of molecular tritium and a phased antenna array. The\ndetection system is discussed in detail.\n", "  The Project 8 collaboration seeks to measure the absolute neutrino mass scale\nby means of precision spectroscopy of the beta decay of tritium. Our technique,\ncyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, measures the frequency of the\nradiation emitted by electrons produced by decays in an ambient magnetic field.\nBecause the cyclotron frequency is inversely proportional to the electron's\nLorentz factor, this is also a measurement of the electron's energy. In order\nto demonstrate the viability of this technique, we have assembled and\nsuccessfully operated a prototype system, which uses a rectangular waveguide to\ncollect the cyclotron radiation from internal conversion electrons emitted from\na gaseous $^{83m}$Kr source. Here we present the main design aspects of the\nfirst phase prototype, which was operated during parts of 2014 and 2015. We\nwill also discuss the procedures used to analyze these data, along with the\nfeatures which have been observed and the performance achieved to date.\n", "  Fermionic continuous spin field propagating in (A)dS space-time is studied.\nGauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for such fermionic field is developed.\nLagrangian of the fermionic continuous spin field is constructed in terms of\ntriple gamma-traceless tensor-spinor Dirac fields, while gauge symmetries are\nrealized by using gamma-traceless gauge transformation parameters. It is\ndemonstrated that partition function of fermionic continuous spin field is\nequal to one. Modified de Donder gauge condition that considerably simplifies\nanalysis of equations of motion is found. Decoupling limits leading to\narbitrary spin massless, partial-massless, and massive fermionic fields are\nstudied.\n", "  We investigate theoretical aspects of the detection of Majorana bound states\nin Josephson junctions using the semiclassical RCSJ model of junction dynamics.\nThe influence of a 4$\\pi$-periodic supercurrent contribution can be detected\nthrough its effect on the width of the Shapiro steps and the Fourier spectrum\nof the voltage signal. We explain how the inclusion of a capacitance term\nresults in a strong quenching of the odd steps when the junction is\nunderdamped, and hence may be used to effectively detect Majorana bound states.\nFurthermore, in presence of capacitance the first and third steps are quenched\nto a different degree, as observed experimentally. We examine the emission\nspectrum of phase-locked solutions, showing that the presence of\nperiod-doubling may difficult the measurement of the 4$\\pi$-periodic\ncontribution from the Fourier spectrum. Finally, we study the voltage response\nin the quasiperiodic regime and indicate how the Fourier spectra and the\nfirst-return maps in this regime reflect the change of periodicity in the\nsupercurrent.\n", "  Gravitational redshift is generally reported by most of the authors without\nconsidering the influence of the energy of the test particle using various\nspacetime geometries such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr and\nKerr-Newman geometries for static, charged static, rotating and charged\nrotating objects respectively. In the present work, the general expression for\nthe energy dependent gravitational redshift is derived for charged rotating\nbody using the Kerr-Newman geometry along with the energy dependent gravity's\nrainbow function. It is found that the gravitational redshift is influenced by\nthe energy of the source or emitter. One may obtain greater correction in the\nvalue of gravitational redshift, using the high energy photons. Knowing the\nvalue of gravitational redshift from a high energy sources such as Gamma-ray\nBursters (GRB), one may obtain the idea of upper bounds on the dimensionless\nrainbow function parameter ($\\xi$). Also there may be a possibility to\nintroduce a new physical scale of the order of $\\frac{\\xi}{E_{Pl}}$.\n", "  Fracton topological order describes a remarkable phase of matter which can be\ncharacterized by fracton excitations with constrained dynamics and a ground\nstate degeneracy that increases exponentially with the length of the system on\na three-dimensional torus. However, previous models exhibiting this order\nrequire many-spin interactions which may be very difficult to realize in a real\nmaterial or cold atom system. In this work, we present a more physically\nrealistic model which has the so-called X-cube fracton topological order but\nonly requires nearest-neighbor two-spin interactions. The model lives on a\nthree-dimensional honeycomb-based lattice with one to two spin-1/2 degrees of\nfreedom on each site and a unit cell of 6 sites. The model is constructed from\ntwo orthogonal stacks of $Z_2$ topologically ordered Kitaev honeycomb layers,\nwhich are coupled together by a two-spin interaction. It is also shown that a\nfour-spin interaction can be included to instead stabilize 3+1D $Z_2$\ntopological order. We also find dual descriptions of four quantum phase\ntransitions in our model, all of which appear to be discontinuous first order\ntransitions.\n", "  Progress in science has advanced the development of human society across\nhistory, with dramatic revolutions shaped by information theory, genetic\ncloning, and artificial intelligence, among the many scientific achievements\nproduced in the 20th century. However, the way that science advances itself is\nmuch less well-understood. In this work, we study the evolution of scientific\ndevelopment over the past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million\ndigitalized papers published between 1900 and 2015. We find that science has\nbenefited from the shift from individual work to collaborative effort, with\nover 90% of the world-leading innovations generated by collaborations in this\ncentury, nearly four times higher than they were in the 1900s. We discover that\nrather than the frequent myopic- and self-referencing that was common in the\nearly 20th century, modern scientists instead tend to look for literature\nfurther back and farther around. Finally, we also observe the globalization of\nscientific development from 1900 to 2015, including 25-fold and 7-fold\nincreases in international collaborations and citations, respectively, as well\nas a dramatic decline in the dominant accumulation of citations by the US, the\nUK, and Germany, from ~95% to ~50% over the same period. Our discoveries are\nmeant to serve as a starter for exploring the visionary ways in which science\nhas developed throughout the past century, generating insight into and an\nimpact upon the current scientific innovations and funding policies.\n", "  We initiate the study of computational entropy in the quantum setting. We\ninvestigate to what extent the classical notions of computational entropy\ngeneralize to the quantum setting, and whether quantum analogues of classical\ntheorems hold. Our main results are as follows. (1) The classical Leakage Chain\nRule for pseudoentropy can be extended to the case that the leakage information\nis quantum (while the source remains classical). Specifically, if the source\nhas pseudoentropy at least $k$, then it has pseudoentropy at least $k-\\ell$\nconditioned on an $\\ell$-qubit leakage. (2) As an application of the Leakage\nChain Rule, we construct the first quantum leakage-resilient stream-cipher in\nthe bounded-quantum-storage model, assuming the existence of a quantum-secure\npseudorandom generator. (3) We show that the general form of the classical\nDense Model Theorem (interpreted as the equivalence between two definitions of\npseudo-relative-min-entropy) does not extend to quantum states. Along the way,\nwe develop quantum analogues of some classical techniques (e.g. the Leakage\nSimulation Lemma, which is proven by a Non-uniform Min-Max Theorem or\nBoosting). On the other hand, we also identify some classical techniques (e.g.\nGap Amplification) that do not work in the quantum setting. Moreover, we\nintroduce a variety of notions that combine quantum information and quantum\ncomplexity, and this raises several directions for future work.\n", "  Using the synchronous coordinates, the creation of a Schwarzschild black hole\nimmersed in a de Sitter spacetime can be viewed as a coherent creation of a\ncollection of timelike geodesics. The previously supposed conical singularities\ndo not exist at the horizons of the constrained instan- ton. Instead, the\nunavoidable irregularity is presented as a non-vanishing second fundamental\nform elsewhere at the quantum transition 3-surface. The same arguments can be\napplied to charged, topological or higher dimensional black hole cases.\n", "  We report on optical spectroscopy on the lacunar spinels GaV$_4$S$_8$ and\nGeV$_4$S$_8$ in the spectral range from 100 to 23000 cm$^{-1}$ and for\ntemperatures from 5 to 300 K. These multiferroic spinel systems reveal\nJahn-Teller driven ferroelectricity and complex magnetic order at low\ntemperatures. We study the infrared-active phonon modes and the low-lying\nelectronic excitations in the cubic high-temperature phase, as well as in the\norbitally and in the magnetically ordered low-temperature phases. We compare\nthe phonon modes in these two compounds, which undergo different\nsymmetry-lowering Jahn-Teller transitions into ferroelectric and orbitally\nordered phases, and exhibit different magnetic ground states. We follow the\nsplitting of the phonon modes at the structural phase transition and detect\nadditional splittings at the onset of antiferromagnetic order in GeV$_4$S$_8$.\nWe observe electronic transitions within the $d$-derived bands of the V$_4$\nclusters and document a significant influence of the structural and magnetic\nphase transitions on the narrow electronic band gaps.\n", "  Modified gravity theories can introduce modifications to the Poisson equation\nin the Newtonian limit. As a result, we expect to see interesting features of\nthese modifications inside stellar objects. White dwarf stars are one of the\nmost well studied stars in stellar astrophysics. We explore the effect of\nmodified gravity theories inside white dwarfs. We derive the modified stellar\nstructure equations and solve them to study the mass-radius relationships for\nvarious modified gravity theories. We also constrain the parameter space of\nthese theories from observations.\n", "  Data unfolding is a common analysis technique used in HEP data analysis.\nInspired by the deconvolution technique in the digital signal processing, a new\nunfolding technique based on the SVD technique and the well-known Wiener filter\nis introduced. The Wiener-SVD unfolding approach achieves the unfolding by\nmaximizing the signal to noise ratios in the effective frequency domain given\nexpectations of signal and noise and is free from regularization parameter.\nThrough a couple examples, the pros and cons of the Wiener-SVD approach as well\nas the nature of the unfolded results are discussed.\n", "  Quantum coherence is an essential feature of quantum mechanics which is\nresponsible for the departure between classical and quantum world. The recently\nestablished resource theory of quantum coherence studies possible quantum\ntechnological applications of quantum coherence, and limitations which arise if\none is lacking the ability to establish superpositions. An important open\nproblem in this context is a simple characterization for incoherent operations,\nconstituted by all possible transformations allowed within the resource theory\nof coherence. In this work, we contribute to such a characterization by proving\nseveral upper bounds on the maximum number of incoherent Kraus operators in a\ngeneral incoherent operation. For a single qubit, we show that the number of\nincoherent Kraus operators is not more than 5, and it remains an open question\nif this number can be reduced to 4. The presented results are also relevant for\nquantum thermodynamics, as we demonstrate by introducing the class of\nGibbs-preserving strictly incoherent operations, and solving the corresponding\nmixed-state conversion problem for a single qubit.\n", "  We explore the feasibility of a compact high-precision Hg atomic clock based\non a hollow core optical fiber. We evaluate the sensitivity of the\n$^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition in Hg and other divalent atoms to the fiber\ninner core surface at non-zero temperatures. The Casimir-Polder interaction\ninduced $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ transition frequency shift is calculated for the atom\ninside the hollow capillary as a function of atomic position, capillary\nmaterial, and geometric parameters. For $^{199}\\mathrm{Hg}$ atoms on the axis\nof a silica capillary with inner radius $\\geq 15 \\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and\noptimally chosen thickness $d\\sim 1 \\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$, the atom-surface\ninteraction induced $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition frequency shift can be\nkept on the level $\\delta\\nu/\\nu_{\\mathrm{Hg}} \\sim10^{-19}$. We also estimate\nthe atom loss and heating due to the collisions with the buffer gas, lattice\nintensity noise induced heating, spontaneous photon scattering, and residual\nbirefringence induced frequency shifts.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) direct detections are investigated for models with the\nfollowing properties: isospin-violating couplings, exothermic scatterings,\nand/or a light mediator, with the aim to reduce the tension between the CDMS-Si\npositive signals and other negative searches. In particular, we focus on the\nnon-standard effective operators which could lead to the spin-independent\nDM-nucleus scatterings with non-trivial dependences on the transfer momentum or\nDM velocity. As a result, such effective operator choices have the very mild\neffects on the final fittings. Furthermore, by including the latest constraints\nfrom LUX, PandaX-II, XENON1T and PICO-60, we find that, for almost all the\nconsidered models, the predicted CDMS-Si signal regions are either severely\nconstrained or completely excluded by the LUX, PandaX-II, XENON1T and PICO-60\ndata, including the most promising Xe-phobic exothermic DM models with/without\na light mediator. Therefore, we conclude that it is very difficult for the\npresent DM framework to explain the CDMS-Si excess.\n", "  We investigate theoretically a one-dimensional ideal Bose gas that is driven\ninto a steady state far from equilibrium via the coupling to two heat baths: a\nglobal bath of temperature $T$ and a \"hot needle\", a bath of temperature\n$T_h\\gg T$ with localized coupling to the system. Remarkably, this system\nfeatures a crossover to finite-size Bose condensation at temperatures $T$ that\nare orders of magnitude larger than the equilibrium condensation temperature.\nThis counterintuitive effect is explained by a suppression of long-wavelength\nexcitations resulting from the competition between both baths. Moreover, for\nsufficiently large needle temperatures ground-state condensation is superseded\nby condensation into an excited state, which is favored by its weaker coupling\nto the hot needle. Our results suggest a general strategy for the preparation\nof quantum degenerate nonequilibrium steady states with unconventional\nproperties and at large temperatures.\n", "  Weyl points in three spatial dimensions are characterized by a\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-valued charge -- the Chern number -- which makes them stable\nagainst a wide range of perturbations. A set of Weyl points can mutually\nannihilate only if their net charge vanishes, a property we refer to as\nrobustness. While nodal loops are usually not robust in this sense, it has\nrecently been shown using homotopy arguments that in the centrosymmetric\nextension of the $\\textrm{AI}$ symmetry class they nevertheless develop a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge analogous to the Chern number. Nodal loops carrying a\nnon-trivial value of this $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge are robust, i.e. they can be\ngapped out only by a pairwise annihilation and not on their own. As this is an\nadditional charge independent of the Berry $\\pi$-phase flowing along the band\ndegeneracy, such nodal loops are, in fact, doubly charged. In this manuscript,\nwe generalize the homotopy discussion to the centrosymmetric extensions of all\nAtland-Zirnbauer classes. We develop a taylored mathematical framework dubbed\nthe AZ+$\\mathcal{I}$ classification and show that in three spatial dimensions\nsuch robust and multiply charged nodes appear in four of such centrosymmetric\nextensions, namely AZ+$\\mathcal{I}$ classes $\\textrm{CI}$ and $\\textrm{AI}$\nlead to doubly charged nodal lines, while $\\textrm{D}$ and $\\textrm{BDI}$\nsupport doubly charged nodal surfaces. We remark that no further crystalline\nsymmetries apart from the spatial inversion are necessary for their stability.\nWe provide a description of the corresponding topological charges, and develop\nsimple tight-binding models of various semimetallic and superconducting phases\nthat exhibit these nodes. We also indicate how the concept of robust and\nmultiply charged nodes generalizes to other spatial dimensions.\n", "  Variations of the bath energy are compared with the information flow in local\ndephasing channels. Special correlated initial conditions are prepared from the\nthermal equilibrium of the whole system, by performing a selective measurement\non the qubit. The spectral densities under study are ohmic-like at low\nfrequencies and include logarithmic perturbations of the power-law profiles.\nThe bath and the correlation energy alternately increase or decrease,\nmonotonically, over long times, according to the value of the ohmicity\nparameter, following logarithmic and power laws. Consider initial conditions\nsuch that the environment is in a thermal state, factorized from the state of\nthe qubit. In the super-ohmic regime the long-time features of the information\nflow are transferred to the bath and correlation energy, by changing the\ninitial condition from the factorized to the specially correlated, even with\ndifferent temperatures. In fact, the low-frequency structures of the spectral\ndensity that provide information backflow with the factorized initial\ncondition, induce increasing (decreasing) bath (correlation) energy with the\nspecially correlated initial configuration. By performing the same change of\ninitial conditions, the spectral properties providing information loss, produce\ndecrease (increase) of the bath (correlation) energy.\n", "  We present a first instalment of the MUSE-Wide survey, covering an area of\n22.2 arcmin$^2$ (corresponding to $\\sim$20% of the final survey) in the\nCANDELS/Deep area of the Chandra Deep Field South. We use the MUSE integral\nfield spectrograph at the ESO VLT to conduct a full-area spectroscopic mapping\nat a depth of 1h exposure time per 1 arcmin$^2$ pointing. We searched for\ncompact emission line objects using our newly developed LSDCat software based\non a 3-D matched filtering approach, followed by interactive classification and\nredshift measurement of the sources. Our catalogue contains 831 distinct\nemission line galaxies with redshifts ranging from 0.04 to 6. Roughly one third\n(237) of the emission line sources are Lyman $\\alpha$ emitting galaxies with $3\n< z < 6$, only four of which had previously measured spectroscopic redshifts.\nAt lower redshifts 351 galaxies are detected primarily by their [OII] emission\nline ($0.3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.5$), 189 by their [OIII] line ($0.21 \\lesssim\nz \\lesssim 0.85$), and 46 by their H$\\alpha$ line ($0.04 \\lesssim z \\lesssim\n0.42$). Comparing our spectroscopic redshifts to photometric redshift estimates\nfrom the literature, we find excellent agreement for $z<1.5$ with a median\n$\\Delta z$ of only $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{-4}$ and an outlier rate of 6%, however a\nsignificant systematic offset of $\\Delta z = 0.26$ and an outlier rate of 23%\nfor Ly$\\alpha$ emitters at $z>3$. Together with the catalogue we also release\n1D PSF-weighted extracted spectra and small 3D datacubes centred on each of the\n831 sources.\n", "  Conformal loop quantum gravity provides an approach to loop quantization\nthrough an underlying conformal structure i.e. conformally equivalent class of\nmetrics. The property that general relativity itself has no conformal\ninvariance is reinstated with a constrained scalar field setting the physical\nscale. Conformally equivalent metrics have recently been shown to be amenable\nto loop quantization including matter coupling. It has been suggested that\nconformal geometry may provide an extended symmetry to allow a reformulated\nImmirzi parameter necessary for loop quantization to behave like an arbitrary\ngroup parameter that requires no further fixing as its present standard form\ndoes. Here, we find that this can be naturally realized via conformal frame\ntransformations in scalar-tensor gravity. Such a theory generally incorporates\na dynamical scalar gravitational field and reduces to general relativity when\nthe scalar field becomes a pure gauge. In particular, we introduce a conformal\nEinstein frame in which loop quantization is implemented. We then discuss how\ndifferent Immirzi parameters under this description may be related by conformal\nframe transformations and yet share the same quantization having, for example,\nthe same area gaps, modulated by the scalar gravitational field.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger equation for Bose gas with repulsive contact interactions in\none-dimensional space may be solved analytically with the help of the Bethe\nansatz if we impose periodic boundary conditions. It was shown that in such a\nsystem there exist many-body eigenstates directly corresponding to dark soliton\nsolutions of the mean-field equation. The system is still integrable if one\nswitches from the periodic boundary conditions to an infinite square well\npotential. The corresponding eigenstates were constructed by M. Gaudin. We\nanalyze weak interaction limit of Gaudin's solutions and identify\nparametrization of eigenstates strictly connected with single and multiple dark\nsolitons. Numerical simulations of detection of particle's positions reveal\ndark solitons in the weak interaction regime and their quantum nature in the\npresence of strong interactions.\n", "  A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution\nmodel for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the\nCalifornia-Kepler-Survey. The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets.\n", "  Spin-spin correlation function response in the low electronic density regime\nand externally applied electric field is evaluated for 2D metallic crystals\nunder Rashba-type coupling, fixed number of particles and two-fold energy band\nstructure. Intrinsic Zeeman-like effect on electron spin polarization, density\nof states, Fermi surface topology and transverse magnetic susceptibility are\nanalyzed in the zero temperature limit. A possible magnetic state for Dirac\nelectrons depending on the zero field band gap magnitude under this conditions\nis found.\n", "  Modern management of research is increasingly based on quantitative\nbibliometric indices. Nowadays, the h-index is a major measure of research\noutput that has supplanted all other citation-based indices. In this context,\nindicators that complement the h-index by evaluating different facets of\nresearch achievement are compelling. As an additional bibliometric source that\ncan be easily extracted from available databases, we propose to use the number\nof distinct journals Nj in which an individual's papers were published. We show\nthat Nj is independent of citation counts, and argue that it is a relevant\nindicator of research scope, since it quantifies readership extent and\nscientific multidisciplinarity. Combining the h-index and Nj, we define a\ntwo-dimensional index (H,M) that measures both the output (through H) and the\noutreach (through M) of individual's research. In order to probe the relevance\nof this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a\npanel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different\nresearch themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two\nindices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of\nresearchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects. We\nconclude that the two indices together offer a more complete picture of\nresearch performance and can be applied to either individuals, research groups\nor institutions.\n", "  An experiment in which the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality is maximally\nviolated is self-testing (i.e., it certifies in a device-independent way both\nthe state and the measurements). We prove that an experiment maximally\nviolating Gisin's elegant Bell inequality is not similarly self-testing. The\nreason can be traced back to the problem of distinguishing an operator from its\ncomplex conjugate. We provide a complete and explicit characterization of all\nscenarios in which the elegant Bell inequality is maximally violated. This\nenables us to see exactly how the problem plays out.\n", "  We have performed quantum chemical computational studies to determine carbon\ndioxide affinity to carbon compounds and minerals, which could be present in\nshales. These studies shed light on the microscopic mechanisms of the possible\ncarbon oxide sequestration processes. Our studies reveal that the carbon oxide\ncan be adsorbed to various forms of carbon structures and also minerals such as\npericlase or illite. We find out that the strongest affinity of carbon oxide\ntowards carbon structures occurs when the carbon structures exhibit $sp^3$\nbonds.\n", "  In this paper we show that the scattered field of a bichromatically driven\nV-type three-level atom exhibit asymmetry and large violation of classical\nbounds in amplitude-intensity correlations. These features result from the\nnoncommutativity of amplitude and intensity field operators, and the strong\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations in this system. The amplitude-intensity correlations\nof resonance fluorescence, with its large third-order fluctuations, describe\nthe nonclassical features of the emitted field more accurately than the\nsecond-order measure related to squeezing. Spectra and variances of these\ncorrelations, along intensity-intensity correlations, provide a wealth of\nsupporting information.\n", "  We show that the proper interpretation of the cocycle operators appearing in\nthe physical vertex operators of compactified strings is that the closed string\ntarget is non-commutative. We track down the appearance of this\nnon-commutativity to the Polyakov action of the flat closed string in the\npresence of translational monodromies (i.e., windings). In view of the\nunexpected nature of this result, we present detailed calculations from a\nvariety of points of view, including a careful understanding of the\nconsequences of mutual locality in the vertex operator algebra, as well as a\ndetailed analysis of the symplectic structure of the Polyakov string. We also\nunderscore why this non-commutativity was not emphasized previously in the\nexisting literature. This non-commutativity can be thought of as a central\nextension of the zero-mode operator algebra, an effect set by the string length\nscale -- it is present even in trivial backgrounds. Clearly, this result\nindicates that the $\\alpha'\\to 0$ limit is more subtle than usually assumed.\n", "  The concept of capacitive coupling between sensors and readout chips is under\nstudy for the vertex detector at the proposed high-energy CLIC electron\npositron collider. The CLICpix Capacitively Coupled Pixel Detector (C3PD) is an\nactive High-Voltage CMOS sensor, designed to be capacitively coupled to the\nCLICpix2 readout chip. The chip is implemented in a commercial $180$ nm HV-CMOS\nprocess and contains a matrix of $128\\times128$ square pixels with $25$ $\\mu$m\npitch. First prototypes have been produced with a standard resistivity of\n$\\sim20$ $\\Omega$cm for the substrate and tested in standalone mode. The\nresults show a rise time of $\\sim20$ ns, charge gain of $190$ mV/ke$^{-}$ and\n$\\sim40$ e$^{-}$ RMS noise for a power consumption of $4.8$ $\\mu$W/pixel. The\nmain design aspects, as well as standalone measurement results, are presented.\n", "  In this paper we present the design and measured performance of a novel\ncryogenic motor based on a superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). The motor is\ntailored for use in millimeter-wave half-wave plate (HWP) polarimeters, where a\nHWP is rapidly rotated in front of a polarization analyzer or\npolarization-sensitive detector. This polarimetry technique is commonly used in\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization studies. The SMB we use is\ncomposed of fourteen yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) disks and a contiguous\nneodymium iron boron (NdFeB) ring magnet. The motor is a hollow-shaft motor\nbecause the HWP is ultimately installed in the rotor. The motor presented here\nhas a 100 mm diameter rotor aperture. However, the design can be scaled up to\nrotor aperture diameters of approximately 500 mm. Our motor system is composed\nof four primary subsystems: (i) the rotor assembly, which includes the NdFeB\nring magnet, (ii) the stator assembly, which includes the YBCO disks, (iii) an\nincremental encoder, and (iv) the drive electronics. While the YBCO is cooling\nthrough its superconducting transition, the rotor is held above the stator by a\nnovel hold and release mechanism (HRM). The encoder subsystem consists of a\ncustom-built encoder disk read out by two fiber optic readout sensors. For the\ndemonstration described in this paper, we ran the motor at 50 K and tested\nrotation frequencies up to approximately 10 Hz. The feedback system was able to\nstabilize the the rotation speed to approximately 0.4%, and the measured rotor\norientation angle uncertainty is less than 0.15 deg. Lower temperature\noperation will require additional development activities, which we will\ndiscuss.\n", "  In this work we propose an effective low-energy theory for a large class of\n2+1 dimensional non-Abelian topological spin liquids whose edge states are\nconformal degrees of freedom with central charges corresponding to the coset\nstructure $su(2)_k\\oplus su(2)_{k'}/su(2)_{k+k'}$. For particular values of\n$k'$ it furnishes the series for unitary minimal and superconformal models.\nThese gapped phases were recently suggested to be obtained from an array of\none-dimensional coupled quantum wires. In doing so we provide an explicit\nrelationship between two distinct approaches: quantum wires and Chern-Simons\nbulk theory. We firstly make a direct connection between the interacting\nquantum wires and the corresponding conformal field theory at the edges, which\nturns out to be given in terms of chiral gauged WZW models. Relying on the\nbulk-edge correspondence we are able to construct the underlying non-Abelian\nChern-Simons effective field theory.\n", "  Using variational wave functions and Monte Carlo techniques, we study the\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with first-neighbor $J_1$ and\nsecond-neighbor $J_2$ antiferromagnetic couplings on the honeycomb lattice. We\nperform a systematic comparison of magnetically ordered and nonmagnetic states\n(spin liquids and valence-bond solids) to obtain the ground-state phase\ndiagram. N\\'eel order is stabilized for small values of the frustrating\nsecond-neighbor coupling. Increasing the ratio $J_2/J_1$, we find strong\nevidence for a continuous transition to a nonmagnetic phase at $J_2/J_1 \\approx\n0.23$. Close to the transition point, the Gutzwiller-projected uniform\nresonating valence bond state gives an excellent approximation to the exact\nground-state energy. For $0.23 \\lesssim J_2/J_1 \\lesssim 0.4$, a gapless $Z_2$\nspin liquid with Dirac nodes competes with a plaquette valence-bond solid. In\ncontrast, the gapped spin liquid considered in previous works has significantly\nhigher variational energy. Although the plaquette valence-bond order is\nexpected to be present as soon as the N\\'eel order melts, this ordered state\nbecomes clearly favored only for $J_2/J_1 \\gtrsim 0.3$. Finally, for $0.36\n\\lesssim J_2/J_1 \\le 0.5$, a valence-bond solid with columnar order takes over\nas the ground state, being also lower in energy than the magnetic state with\ncollinear order. We perform a detailed finite-size scaling and standard data\ncollapse analysis, and we discuss the possibility of a deconfined quantum\ncritical point separating the N\\'eel antiferromagnet from the plaquette\nvalence-bond solid.\n", "  We present the first determination of Higgs-boson decay to hadrons at the\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD in the limit\nof a heavy top quark and massless light flavours. This result has been obtained\nby computing the absorptive parts of the relevant five-loop self-energy for a\ngeneral gauge group and combining the outcome with the corresponding\ncoefficient function already known to this order in QCD. Our new result reduces\nthe uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbation series to a fraction\nof the uncertainty due to the present error of the strong coupling constant. We\nhave also performed the corresponding but technically simpler computations for\ndirect Higgs decay to bottom quarks and for the electromagnetic R-ratio in e^+\ne^- -> hadrons, thus verifying important fifth-order results obtained so far\nonly by one group.\n", "  The Anti-Matter Factory at CERN is gearing up, commissioning of the Extra Low\nENergy Antiprotons (ELENA) ring is ongoing and the first anti-protons are\nforeseen to circulate in the decelerator very soon. The unprecedented flux of\nlow energy antiprotons delivered by ELENA will open a new era for precision\ntests with antimatter including laser and microwave spectroscopy and tests of\nits gravitational behaviour. Here we propose a scheme to load the ultra cold\nanti-hydrogen atoms that will be produced by the GBAR experiment in an optical\nlattice tuned at the magic wavelength of the 1S-2S transition in order to\nmeasure this interval at a level comparable or even better than its matter\ncounter part. This will provide the most sensitive test of CPT symmetry\nparametrised in the framework of the Standard Model Extension.\n", "  The gas SF$_6$ has become of interest as a negative ion drift gas for use in\ndirectional dark matter searches. However, as for other targets in such\nsearches, it is important that radon contamination can be removed as this\nprovides a source of unwanted background events. In this work we demonstrate\nfor the first time filtration of radon from SF$_6$ gas by using a molecular\nsieve. Four types of sieves from Sigma-Aldrich were investigated, namely\n3{\\AA}, 4{\\AA}, 5{\\AA} and 13X. A manufactured radon source was used for the\ntests. This was attached to a closed loop system in which gas was flowed\nthrough the filters and a specially adapted Durridge RAD7 radon detector. In\nthese measurements, it was found that only the 5{\\AA} type was able to\nsignificantly reduce the radon concentration without absorbing the SF$_6$ gas.\nThe sieve was able to reduce the initial radon concentration of 3875 $\\pm$ 13\nBqm$^{-3}$ in SF$_6$ gas by 87% when cooled with dry ice. The ability of the\ncooled 5{\\AA} molecular sieve filter to significantly reduce radon\nconcentration from SF$_6$ provides a promising foundation for the construction\nof a radon filtration setup for future ultra-sensitive SF$_6$ gas rare-event\nphysics experiments.\n", "  Multispectral imaging plays an important role in many applications from\nastronomical imaging, earth observation to biomedical imaging. However, the\ncurrent technologies are complex with multiple alignment-sensitive components,\npredetermined spatial and spectral parameters by manufactures. Here, we\ndemonstrate a single-shot multispectral imaging technique that gives\nflexibility to end-users with a very simple optical setup, thank to spatial\ncorrelation and spectral decorrelation of speckle patterns. These seemingly\nrandom speckle patterns are point spreading functions (PSFs) generated by light\nfrom point sources propagating through a strongly scattering medium. The\nspatial correlation of PSFs allows image recovery with deconvolution\ntechniques, while the spectral decorrelation allows them to play the role of\ntune-able spectral filters in the deconvolution process. Our demonstrations\nutilizing optical physics of strongly scattering media and computational\nimaging present the most cost-effective approach for multispectral imaging with\ngreat advantages.\n", "  We introduce a category of stochastic maps (certain Markov kernels) on\ncompact Hausdorff spaces, construct a stochastic analogue of the Gelfand\nspectrum functor, and prove a stochastic version of the commutative\nGelfand-Naimark Theorem. This relates concepts from algebra and operator theory\nto concepts from topology and probability theory. For completeness, we review\nstochastic matrices, their relationship to positive maps on commutative\n$C^*$-algebras, and the Gelfand-Naimark Theorem. No knowledge of probability\ntheory nor $C^*$-algebras is assumed and several examples are drawn from\nphysics.\n", "  In this paper we continue the investigation concerning the propagation of\ngravitational waves in a cosmological background using Laplace transform\n\\cite{A}. We analyze the possible physical consequences of the result present\nin \\cite{A} where it is argued that a non-vanishing positive abscissa of\nconvergence caused by the de Sitter expansion factor $a(t)=e^{Ht}$ implies a\nshift in the frequencies domain of a traveling gravitational waves as measured\nby a comoving observer. In particular, we show that in a generic asymptotically\nde Sitter cosmological universe this redshift effect does also arise.\nConversely, in a universe expanding with, for example, a power law expansion,\nthis phenomenon does not happen. This physically possible new redshift effect,\nalthough negligible for the actual very low value of $\\Lambda$, can have\ninteresting physical consequences concerning for example its relation with\nBose-Einstein condensation or more speculatively with the nature of the\ncosmological constant in terms of gravitons, as recently suggested in \\cite{B}\nnear a Bose-Einstein condensation phase.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have been extensively studied owing to\ntheir fascinating and technologically relevant properties. Their\nfunctionalities can be often tailored by the interlayer stacking pattern.\nLow-frequency (LF) Raman spectroscopy provides a quick, non-destructive and\ninexpensive optical technique for stacking characterization, since the\nintensities of LF interlayer vibrational modes are sensitive to the details of\nthe stacking. A simple and generalized interlayer bond polarizability model is\nproposed here to explain and predict how the LF Raman intensities depend on\ncomplex stacking sequences for any thickness in a broad array of 2D materials,\nincluding graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, NbSe2, Bi2Se3, GaSe, h-BN, etc. Additionally,\na general strategy is proposed to unify the stacking nomenclature for these 2D\nmaterials. Our model reveals the fundamental mechanism of LF Raman response to\nthe stacking, and provides general rules for stacking identification.\n", "  Adhesion between a T cell and an antigen presenting cell is achieved by\nTCR-pMHC and LFA1-ICAM1 protein complexes. These segregate to form a special\npattern, known as the immunological synapse (IS), consisting of a central\nquasi-circular domain of TCR-pMHC bonds surrounded by a peripheral domain of\nLFA1-ICAM1 complexes. Insights gained from imaging studies had led to the\nconclusion that the formation of the central adhesion domain in the IS is\ndriven by active (ATP-driven) mechanisms. Recent studies, however, suggested\nthat passive (thermodynamic) mechanisms may also play an important role in this\nprocess. Here, we present a simple physical model, taking into account the\nmembrane-mediated thermodynamic attraction between the TCR-pMHC bonds and the\neffective forces that they experience due to ATP-driven actin retrograde flow\nand transport by dynein motor proteins. Monte Carlo simulations of the model\nexhibit a good spatio-temporal agreement with the experimentally observed\npattern evolution of the TCR-pMHC microclusters. The agreement is lost when one\nof the aggregation mechanisms is \"muted\", which helps to identify the\nrespective roles in the process. We conclude that actin retrograde flow drives\nthe centripetal motion of TCR-pMHC bonds, while the membrane-mediated\ninteractions facilitate microcluster formation and growth. In the absence of\ndynein motors, the system evolves into a ring-shaped pattern, which highlights\nthe role of dynein motors in the formation of the final concentric pattern. The\ninterplay between the passive and active mechanisms regulates the rate of the\naccumulation process, which in the absence of one them proceeds either too\nquickly or slowly.\n", "  Chemically doped graphene could support plasmon excitations up to\ntelecommunication or even visible frequencies. Apart from that, the presence of\ndopant may influence electron scattering mechanisms in graphene and thus impact\nthe plasmon decay rate. Here I study from first principles these effects in\nsingle-layer and bilayer graphene doped with various alkali and alkaline earth\nmetals. I find new dopant-activated damping channels: loss due to out-of-plane\ngraphene and in-plane dopant vibrations, and electron transitions between\ngraphene and dopant states. The latter excitations interact with the graphene\nplasmon and together they form a new hybrid mode. The study points out a strong\ndependence of these features on the type of dopants and the number of layers,\nwhich could be used as a tuning mechanism in future graphene-based plasmonic\ndevices.\n", "  An optical potential constructed using the ${\\bar p}N$ scattering amplitudes\nderived from the 2009 version of the Paris ${\\bar N}N$ potential is applied in\ncalculations of ${\\bar p}$ quasi-bound states in selected nuclei across the\nperiodic table. A proper self-consistent procedure for treating energy\ndependence of the amplitudes in a nucleus appears crucial for evaluating ${\\bar\np}$ binding energies and widths. Particular attention is paid to the role of\n$P$-wave amplitudes. While the $P$-wave potential nearly does not affect\ncalculated ${\\bar p}$ binding energies, it reduces considerably the\ncorresponding widths. The Paris $S$-wave potential supplemented by a\nphenomenological $P$-wave term yields in dynamical calculations ${\\bar p}$\nbinding energies $B_{\\bar p}\\approx 200$ MeV and widths $\\Gamma_{\\bar\np}\\sim~200 - 230$ MeV, which is very close to the values obtained within the\nRMF model consistent with ${\\bar p}$-atom data.\n", "  In the recent years neutrino experiments have studied in detail the\nphenomenon of neutrino oscillations and most of the oscillation parameters have\nbeen measured with a good accuracy. However, in spite of many interesting\nideas, the problem of flavor in the lepton sector remains an open issue. In\nthis review, we discuss the state of the art of models for neutrino masses and\nmixings formulated in the context of flavor symmetries, with particular\nemphasis on the role played by grand unified gauge groups.\n", "  This article argues for the importance of forbidden triads - open triads with\nhigh-weight edges - in predicting success in creative fields. Forbidden triads\nhad been treated as a residual category beyond closed and open triads, yet I\nargue that these structures provide opportunities to combine socially evolved\nstyles in new ways. Using data on the entire history of recorded jazz from 1896\nto 2010, I show that observed collaborations have tolerated the openness of\nhigh weight triads more than expected, observed jazz sessions had more\nforbidden triads than expected, and the density of forbidden triads contributed\nto the success of recording sessions, measured by the number of record releases\nof session material. The article also shows that the sessions of Miles Davis\nhad received an especially high boost from forbidden triads.\n", "  We present an approach for simulating the collisional evolution of spherical\nisotropic stellar systems based on the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation.\nA novel aspect is that we use the phase volume as the argument of the\ndistribution function, instead of the traditionally used energy, which\nfacilitates the solution. The publicly available code, PhaseFlow, implements a\nhigh-accuracy finite-element method for the Fokker-Planck equation, and can\nhandle multiple-component systems, optionally with the central black hole and\ntaking into account loss-cone effects and star formation. We discuss the energy\nbalance in the general setting, and in application to the Bahcall-Wolf cusp\naround a central black hole, for which we derive a perturbative solution. We\nstress that the cusp is not a steady-state structure, but rather evolves in\namplitude while retaining an approximately $\\rho\\propto r^{-7/4}$ density\nprofile. Finally, we apply the method to the nuclear star cluster of the Milky\nWay, and illustrate a possible evolutionary scenario in which a two-component\nsystem of lighter main-sequence stars and stellar-mass black holes develops a\nBahcall-Wolf cusp in the heavier component and a weaker $\\rho\\propto r^{-3/2}$\ncusp in the lighter, visible component, over the period of several Gyr. The\npresent-day density profile is consistent with the recently detected mild cusp\ninside the central parsec, and is weakly sensitive to initial conditions.\n", "  Local structural distortions in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-based solid solutions have\nbeen proved to play a crucial role in understanding and tuning their enhanced\npiezoelectric properties near the morphotropic phase boundary. In this work all\nlocal structural disorders in a lead-free ternary system, namely\n85%Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-10%Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-5%BaTiO3, were mapped in reciprocal space by\n3D electron diffraction. Furthermore, a comprehensive model of the local\ndisorder was developed by analysing the intensity and morphology of the\nobserved weak diffuse scattering. We found that the studied ceramics consists\nof plate-like in-phase oxygen octahedral nanoscale domains randomly distributed\nin an antiphase tilted matrix. In addition, A-site chemical short-range order\nof Na/Bi and polar displacements contribute to different kinds of diffuse\nscattering. The proposed model explains all the observed diffraction features\nand offers insight into the ongoing controversy over the nature of local\nstructural distortions in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-based solid solutions.\n", "  We report the low temperature magnetic properties of the DyScO$_3$\nperovskite, which were characterized by means of single crystal and powder\nneutron scattering, and by magnetization measurements. Below\n$T_{\\mathrm{N}}=3.15$ K, Dy$^{3+}$ moments form an antiferromagnetic structure\nwith an easy axis of magnetization lying in the $ab$-plane. The magnetic\nmoments are inclined at an angle of $\\sim\\pm{28}^{\\circ}$ to the $b$-axis. We\nshow that the ground state Kramers doublet of Dy$^{3+}$ is made up of primarily\n$|\\pm 15/2\\rangle$ eigenvectors and well separated by crystal field from the\nfirst excited state at $E_1=24.9$ meV. This leads to an extreme Ising\nsingle-ion anisotropy, $M_{\\perp}/M_{\\|}\\sim{0.05}$. The transverse magnetic\nfluctuations, which are proportional to $M^{2}_{\\perp}/M^{2}_{\\|}$, are\nsuppressed and only moment fluctuations along the local Ising direction are\nallowed. We also found that the Dy-Dy dipolar interactions along the\ncrystallographic $c$-axis are 2-4 times larger than in-plane interactions.\n", "  This paper focuses on the motion of a test particle moving around the\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole. It deals with circular motion and radial motion\nof the neutral massive test particles, and shortly handles circular motion of\nthe charged massive test particles. Both neutral and charged particles are\naffected by black hole's charge, but it is due to the fact that charge of the\nblack hole bends the spacetime more strongly. This procedure has nothing to do\nwith electromagnetic interactions, and these are only considered for charged\ntest particles. However, it only treats mathematically easy, approximated\nsituations and general motions and complex motions will not be discussed. This\npaper has tried to get some physical information only with the easiest\nmathematical tools and without difficult concepts that general relativity\ncontains. Contents of this paper would be suitable for those who want to know\nsomething about the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, but does not have much\nknowledge in this field. They can begin their intellectual journey with this\npaper.\n", "  We present the results of two-component (disc+bar) and three-component\n(disc+bar+bulge) multiwavelength 2D photometric decompositions of barred\ngalaxies in five SDSS bands ($ugriz$). This sample of $\\sim$3,500 nearby\n($z<0.06$) galaxies with strong bars selected from the Galaxy Zoo citizen\nscience project is the largest sample of barred galaxies to be studied using\nphotometric decompositions which include a bar component. With detailed\nstructural analysis we obtain physical quantities such as the bar- and\nbulge-to-total luminosity ratios, effective radii, S\\'ersic indices and colours\nof the individual components. We observe a clear difference in the colours of\nthe components, the discs being bluer than the bars and bulges. An overwhelming\nfraction of bulge components have S\\'ersic indices consistent with being\npseudobulges. By comparing the barred galaxies with a mass-matched and\nvolume-limited sample of unbarred galaxies, we examine the connection between\nthe presence of a large-scale galactic bar and the properties of discs and\nbulges. We find that the discs of unbarred galaxies are significantly bluer\ncompared to the discs of barred galaxies, while there is no significant\ndifference in the colours of the bulges. We find possible evidence of secular\nevolution via bars that leads to the build-up of pseudobulges and to the\nquenching of star formation in the discs. We identify a subsample of unbarred\ngalaxies with an inner lens/oval and find that their properties are similar to\nbarred galaxies, consistent with an evolutionary scenario in which bars\ndissolve into lenses. This scenario deserves further investigation through both\ntheoretical and observational work.\n", "  Using a wavefunction Dirac Bogoliubov-de Gennes method, we demonstrate that\nthe tunable Fermi level of a graphene layer in the presence of Rashba spin\norbit coupling (RSOC) allows for producing an anomalous nonlocal Andreev\nreflection and equal spin superconducting triplet pairing. We consider a\ngraphene junction of a ferromagnet-RSOC-superconductor-ferromagnet\nconfiguration and study scattering processes, the appearance of spin triplet\ncorrelations, and charge conductance in this structure. We show that the\nanomalous crossed Andreev reflection is linked to the equal spin triplet\npairing. Moreover, by calculating current cross-correlations, our results\nreveal that this phenomenon causes negative charge conductance at weak voltages\nand can be revealed in a spectroscopy experiment, and may provide a tool for\ndetecting the entanglement of the equal spin superconducting pair correlations\nin hybrid structures.\n", "  The effect of network chain distribution on mechanical behavior of elastomers\nis one of the long standing problems in rubber mechanics. The classical theory\nof rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic elasticity of\nnetworks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The kinetic theories\nfor vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect experimental measurements\nall indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates is made of polymer strands\nwith a random distribution of length. The polydispersity in strand length is\nexpected to control the mechanical strength of rubber as the overloaded short\nstrands break at small deformations and transfer the load to the longer\nstrands. The purpose of this contribution is to present a simple theory of\nrubber mechanics which takes into account the length distribution of strands\nand its effect on the onset of bulk failure.\n", "  Virginia's barrier islands constitute one of the most undeveloped shorelines\nof the eastern US. Aside from a few islands in the north, the islands are\nuninhabited and managed for conservation. These islands play important\nenvironmental, cultural, and economic roles along Virginia's Eastern Shore.\nClimate change driven sea-level rise is already having a major impact on these\nislands and threatens their existence. We utilize transect analysis across each\nof the barrier islands to depict the shoreline change trends annually from 1850\nto 2010. We then utilize time series forecasting and panel modeling to estimate\nfuture shorelines up to and including a best estimate 2099 CE shoreline.\nResults indicate that across almost all the islands, the shoreline retreat rate\nhas been increasing over time. Additionally, we find that year 2100 CE\nsea-level rise scenarios are likely to accelerate the shoreline retreat\noccurring on these islands and may erase many of them all together. We find\nthat the northern islands of Wallops and North Assateague will remain generally\nstable whereas many of the remaining islands will likely experience rapid\nshoreline retreat under future sea-level rise scenarios.\n", "  Solar flare emission at X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) energies can\ncause substantial enhancements in the electron density in the Earth's lower\nionosphere. It is now become clear that flares exhibit quasi-periodic\npulsations with timescales of minutes at X-ray energies, but to date, it has\nnot been known if the ionosphere is sensitive to this variability. Here, using\na combination of Very Low Frequency (24 kHz) measurement together with\nspace-based X-ray and EUV observations, we report pulsations of the ionospheric\nD-region, which are synchronized with a set of pulsating flare loops. Modeling\nof the ionosphere show that the D-region electron density varies by up to an\norder of magnitude over the timescale of the pulsations ($\\sim$20 mins). Our\nresults reveal that the Earth's ionosphere is more sensitive to small-scale\nchanges in solar soft X-ray flux than previously thought, and implies that\nplanetary ionospheres are closely coupled to small-scale changes in\nsolar/stellar activity.\n", "  Recently, D. Zhou et al. 2015 studied empirically the land surface\ntemperature of 32 Chinese cities and reported an exponentially decaying\nresidual effect of the urban heat island (UHI) around the cities. Here we show\nanalytically that such a form is equivalent to a previously proposed\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian function. The reason for this seeming contradiction is\nthe way how the distance from the considered city is defined. While in the\nformer, consecutive equal area belts around the city are used, in the latter it\nis the euclidean distance. In simplified terms, the definition of the belts\nimplies a transformation of the independent variable $\\rho\\sim d^{\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha\\approx 1/2$, where $\\rho$ is the euclidean distance from the center and\n$d$ is the index of the belt. Since the belts have equal area, outer ones\nbecome more narrow. As a consequence, the Gaussian function $\\sim\n\\mathrm{e}^{-\\rho^2}$ becomes an exponential cone $\\sim \\mathrm{e}^{-d}$. This\npaper provides an explicit derivation of the equivalence.\n", "  We present our progress on simulating the Glasma in the early stages of heavy\nion collisions in a non-boost-invariant setting. Our approach allows us to\ndescribe colliding nuclei with finite longitudinal width by extending the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan model to include a parameter for the Lorentz-contracted\nbut finite extent of the nucleus in the beam direction. We determine the\nrapidity profile of the Glasma energy density, which shows strong deviations\nfrom the boost invariant result. Both broad and narrow profiles can be produced\nby varying the initial conditions. We find reasonable agreement when we compare\nthe results to rapidity profiles of measured pion multiplicities from RHIC.\n", "  Blazars are often characterized by a spectral break at soft X-rays, whose\norigin is still debated. While most sources show a flattening, some exhibit a\nblackbody-like soft excess with temperatures of the order of $\\sim$0.1 keV,\nsimilar to low-luminosity, non-jetted Seyferts. Here we present the analysis of\nthe simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation of the luminous FSRQ\n4C+25.05 ($z=2.368$). The observed 0.3-30 keV spectrum is best described by the\nsum of a hard X-ray power law ($\\Gamma = 1.38_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$) and a soft\ncomponent, approximated by a blackbody with $kT_{\\rm BB} =\n0.66_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ keV (rest frame). If the spectrum of 4C+25.05 is\ninterpreted in the context of bulk Comptonization by cold electrons of\nbroad-line region photons emitted in the direction of the jet, such an unusual\ntemperature implies a bulk Lorentz factor of the jet of $\\Gamma_{\\rm bulk}\\sim\n11.7$. Bulk Comptonization is expected to be ubiquitous on physical grounds,\nyet no clear signature of it has been found so far, possibly due to its\ntransient nature and the lack of high-quality, broad-band X-ray spectra.\n", "  We discuss a general approach permitting the identification of a broad class\nof sets of Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians, which are integrable in the sense of\nLiouville. It is shown that all such Hamiltonians can be solved explicitly by a\nseparation of variables {\\em Ansatz}. The method leads in particular to a proof\nthat the so-called \"goldfish\" Hamiltonian is maximally superintegrable, and\nleads to an elementary identification of a full set of integrals of motion. The\nHamiltonians in involution with the \"goldfish\" Hamiltonian are also explicitly\nintegrated. New integrable Hamiltonians are identified, among which some have\nthe property of being isochronous, that is, that all their orbits have the same\nperiod. Finally, a peculiar structure is identified in the Poisson brackets\nbetween the elementary symmetric functions and the set of Hamiltonians\ncommuting with the \"goldfish\" Hamiltonian: these can be expressed as products\nbetween elementary symmetric functions and Hamiltonians. The structure displays\nan invariance property with respect to one element, and has both a symmetry and\na closure property. The meaning of this structure is not altogether clear to\nthe author, but it turns out to be a powerful tool.\n", "  We improve on the description of the relationship that exists between\ncritical clusters in thermal systems and intermittency near the onset of chaos\nin low-dimensional systems. We make use of the statistical-mechanical language\nof inhomogeneous systems and of the renormalization group (RG) method in\nnonlinear dynamics to provide a more accurate, formal, approach to the subject.\nThe description of this remarkable correspondence encompasses, on the one hand,\nthe density functional formalism, where classical and quantum mechanical\nanalogues match the procedure for one-dimensional clusters, and, on the other,\nthe RG fixed-point map of functional compositions that captures the essential\ndynamical behavior. We provide details of how the above-referred theoretical\napproaches interrelate and discuss the implications of the correspondence\nbetween the high-dimensional (degrees of freedom) phenomenon and\nlow-dimensional dynamics.\n", "  The phenomenon associated with inhomogeneous distribution of electron density\nis known as a charge ordering. In this work, we study the zero-bandwidth limit\nof the extended Hubbard model, which can be considered as a simple effective\nmodel of charge ordered insulators. It consists of the on-site interaction $U$\nand the intersite density-density interactions $W_1$ and $W_2$ between\nnearest-neighbors and next-nearest neighbors, respectively. We derived the\nexact ground state diagrams for different lattice dimensionalities and discuss\neffects of small finite temperatures in the limit of high dimensions. In\nparticular, we estimated the critical interactions for which new ordered phases\nemerge (laminar or stripe and four-sublattice-type). Our analysis show that the\nground state of the model is highly degenerated. One of the most intriguing\nfinding is that the nonzero temperature removes these degenerations.\n", "  We consider the most general action for gravity which is quadratic in\ncurvature. In this case first order and second order formalisms are not\nequivalent. This framework is a good candidate for a unitary and renormalizable\ntheory of the gravitational field; in particular, there are no propagators\nfalling down faster than $\\tfrac{1}{p^2}$. The UV regime is in a conformal\ninvariant phase; only when Weyl invariance is broken through the coupling to\nmatter can an Einstein-Hilbert term (and its corresponding Planck mass scale)\nbe generated.\n", "  Earth possesses a persistent, internally-generated magnetic field, whereas no\ntrace of a dynamo has been detected on Venus, at present or in the past,\nalthough a high surface temperature and recent resurfacing events may have\nremoved paleomagnetic evidence. Whether or not a terrestrial body can sustain\nan internally generated magnetic field by convection inside its metallic fluid\ncore is determined in part by its initial thermodynamic state and its\ncompositional structure, both of which are in turn set by the processes of\naccretion and differentiation. Here we show that the cores of Earth- and\nVenus-like planets should grow with stable compositional stratification unless\ndisturbed by late energetic impacts. They do so because higher abundances of\nlight elements are incorporated into the liquid metal that sinks to form the\ncore as the temperatures and pressures of metal-silicate equilibration increase\nduring accretion. We model this process and determine that this establishes a\nstable stratification that resists convection and inhibits the onset of a\ngeodynamo. However, if a late energetic impact occurs, it could mechanically\nstir the core creating a single homogenous region within which a long-lasting\ngeodynamo would operate. While Earth's accretion has been punctuated by a late\ngiant impact with likely enough energy to mix the core (e.g. the impact that\nformed the Moon), we hypothesize that the accretion of Venus is characterized\nby the absence of such energetic giant impacts and the preservation of its\nprimordial stratifications.\n", "  With two Higgs doublets but without any discrete $Z_2$ symmetry to forbid\nflavor changing neutral Higgs couplings, new top Yukawa couplings $\\rho_{tt}$\nand $\\rho_{tc}$ are allowed and naturally complex. Electroweak baryogenesis is\nremarkably efficient if both $\\rho_{tt}$ (and $\\rho_{tc}$) and exotic Higgs\nquartic couplings are ${\\cal O}(1)$. Furthermore, the alignment phenomenon,\nthat the observed 125 GeV boson so closely resembles the Standard Model Higgs\nboson, emerges naturally. One not only has many new flavor and CPV phenomena\n(modulo SM-like flavor organization plus alignment), but the exotic Higgs\nbosons $H^0$, $A^0$ and $H^+$ are necessarily sub-TeV in mass, and LHC search\nshould be readjusted.\n", "  Data from three solar observatories, Learmonth, Holloman, and San Vito, are\nused to study the variations in the average number of sunspots per sunspot\ngroup. It is found that the different types of sunspot groups and the number of\nsunspots in these groups have different solar cycle and cycle to cycle\nvariations. The varying ratio between the average number of sunspots and the\nnumber of sunspot groups is shown to be a real feature and not a result of\nchanging observational instruments, observers experience, calculation schemes,\netc., and is a result of variations in the solar magnetic fields. Therefore,\nthe attempts to minimize the discrepancies between the sunspot number and\nsunspot group series are not justified, and lead to the loss of important\ninformation about the variability of the solar dynamo.\n", "  Quantum entangled states of light are essential for quantum technologies and\nfundamental tests of physics. While quantum information science has relied on\nsystems with entanglement in 2D degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum bits with\npolarization states, the field is moving towards ever-higher dimensions of\nentanglement. Increasing the dimensionality enhances the channel capacity and\nsecurity of quantum communication protocols, gives rise to exponential speed-up\nof quantum computation, and is necessary for quantum imaging. Yet,\ncharacterization of even bipartite quantum states of high-dimensional\nentanglement remains a prohibitively time-consuming challenge, as the\ndimensionality of the joint Hilbert space scales quadratically with the number\nof modes. Here, we develop and experimentally demonstrate a new, more complete\ntheory of detection in CCD cameras for rapid measurement of the full joint\nprobability distribution of high-dimensional quantum states. The theory spans\nthe intensity range from low photon count to saturation of the detector, while\nthe massive parallelization inherent in the pixel array makes measurements\nscale favorably with dimensionality. The results accurately account for partial\ndetection and electronic noise, resolve the paradox of ignoring two-photon\ndetection in a single pixel despite collinear spatial entanglement, and reveal\nthe full Hilbert space for exploration. For example, use of a megapixel array\nallows measurement of a joint Hilbert space of 1012 dimensions, with a speed-up\nof nearly four orders of magnitude over traditional methods. We demonstrate the\nmethod with pairs, but it generalizes readily to arbitrary numbers of entangled\nphotons. The technique uses standard geometry with existing technology, thus\nremoving barriers of entry to quantum imaging experiments, and open previously\ninaccessible regimes of high-dimensional quantum optics.\n", "  A set of general allometric scaling laws is derived for different systems\nrepresented by tree networks. The formulation postulates self-similar networks\nwith an arbitrary number of branches developed in each generation, and with an\ninhomogeneous structure given by a fractal relation between successive\ngenerations. Three idealized examples are considered: networks of masses,\nelectric resistors, and elastic springs, which obey a specific recurrence\nrelation between generations. The results can be generalized to networks made\nwith different elements obeying equivalent relations. The equivalent values of\nthe networks (total mass, resistance and elastic coefficient) are compared with\ntheir corresponding spatial scales (length, cross-section and volume) in order\nto derive allometric scaling laws. Under appropriate fractal-like\napproximations of the length and cross-section of the branches, some allometric\nexponents reported in the literature are recovered (for instance, the 3/4-law\nof metabolism in biological organisms or the hydraulic conductivity scaling in\nporous networks). The formulation allows different choices of the fractal\nparameters, thus enabling the derivation of new power-laws not reported before.\n", "  The paper at hand presents a novel class of dyonic black holes in higher\ndimensions through a new proposal for the electromagnetic field tensor. The\nblack hole solutions are extracted analytically and their geometrical/physical\nproperties are studied. In addition, the details regarding thermodynamical\nstructure and phase transition behavior of the solutions for $4$ different\ncases are investigated: i) general case, ii) constant electric field, iii)\nconstant magnetic field, and iv) constant electric and magnetic fields. It will\nbe shown that depending on the picture under consideration, the thermodynamical\nproperties are modified. To have better picture regarding the phase\ntransitions, the concept of the extended phase space is employed. It will be\nshown that in the absence of the electric field, magnetic black holes present\nvan der Waals like phase transition. Furthermore, it will be highlighted that\nfor super magnetized black holes, no phase transition exists.\n", "  We present integral estimates for the shift and induced metric in the maximal\nisothermal gauge, corresponding to linear axially symmetric gravitational\nperturbations over the Minkowski and extreme Kerr metric. These bounds are a\nstep towards finding pointwise bounds for the perturbations. In particular the\npresented estimate for the shift includes the horizon for the extreme Kerr\ncase.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) arise from the thermonuclear explosion of\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Though the uniformity of their light curves makes\nthem powerful cosmological distance indicators, long-standing issues remain\nregarding their progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Recent detection of the\nearly ultraviolet pulse of a peculiar subluminous SN Ia has been claimed as new\nevidence for the companion-ejecta interaction through the single-degenerate\nchannel. Here, we report the discovery of a prominent but red optical flash at\n$\\sim$ 0.5 days after the explosion of a SN Ia which shows hybrid features of\ndifferent SN Ia sub-classes: a light curve typical of normal-brightness SNe Ia,\nbut with strong titanium absorptions, commonly seen in the spectra of\nsubluminous ones. We argue that the early flash of such a hybrid SN Ia is\ndifferent from predictions of previously suggested scenarios such as the\ncompanion-ejecta interaction. Instead it can be naturally explained by a SN\nexplosion triggered by a detonation of a thin helium shell either on a\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\\gtrsim$ 1.3 M$_{\\odot}$) with low-yield\n$^{56}$Ni or on a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ($\\sim$ 1.0 M$_{\\odot}$)\nmerging with a less massive white dwarf. This finding provides compelling\nevidence that one branch of the previously proposed explosion models, the\nhelium-ignition scenario, does exist in nature, and such a scenario may account\nfor explosions of white dwarfs in a wider mass range in contrast to what was\npreviously supposed.\n", "  A priori assumption in micromechanical analysis of polymeric networks is that\nthe constitutive polymer strands are of equal length. Monodisperse distribution\nof strands, however, is merely a simplifying assumption. In this paper, we\nrelax this assumption and consider a vulcanized network with a broad\ndistribution of strand length. In the light of this model, we predict the\ndamage initiation and stress-stretch dependency in a filled polymer network\nwith random internal structures. The degradation of network mechanical behavior\nis assumed to be controlled by the adhesive failure of the strands adsorbed to\nthe filler surface. We show that the short adsorbed strands are the culprits\nfor damage initiation and their finite extensibility is a key determinant of\nmechanical strength.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of a $d$-$d$ transition in NiO using a new x-ray\nspectrometer with 0.025 eV resolution at 15816 eV, and via ab-initio ligand\nfield theory calculations. The transition at ~1.7 eV energy transfer is\nmeasured at temperatures between 20 and 800 K, at a momentum transfer\n|$\\bf{Q}$| = 6.52 \\AA$^{-1}$. Fine structure is clearly observed at 20 K. As\ntemperature is increased, the excitation shifts to lower energy and broadens.\nWe explain the energy shift as being related to thermal expansion and to\nmagnetism. The broadening is well fit considering thermal fluctuations of the\nNi-O bond length, with a scale factor found to be in reasonable agreement with\ncalculation.\n", "  We found that the electronic transport property of SnSe single crystals was\nsensitive to oxygen content. Semiconducting SnSe single crystals were obtained\nby using Sn of grain form as a starting material while powder Sn resulted in\nmetallic SnSe. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the\nsurfaces of raw Sn were oxidized, where the volume fraction was relatively low\nin grain Sn. This demonstrates that contamination of oxygen causes metallic\nbehavior in grown SnSe single crystals.\n", "  We demonstrated an electric field controlled exchange bias (EB) effect\naccompanied with unipolar resistive switching behavior in the\nSi/SiO2/Pt/Co/NiO/Pt device. By applying certain voltages, the device displays\nobvious EB in high-resistance-state while negligible EB in\nlow-resistance-state. Conductive filaments forming and rupture in the NiO layer\nbut near the Co-NiO interface are considered to play dominant roles in\ndetermining the combined resistive switching and EB phenomena. This work paves\na new way for designing multifunctional and nonvolatile magnetic-electrical\nrandom access memory devices.\n", "  Defining an objective boundary for a city is a difficult problem, which\nremains to be solved by an effective method. Recent years, new methods for\nidentifying urban boundary have been developed by means of spatial search\ntechniques (e.g. CCA). However, the new algorithms are involved with another\nproblem, that is, how to determine the radius of spatial search objectively.\nThis paper proposes new approaches to looking for the most advisable spatial\nsearching radius for determining urban boundary. The key is to find out the\ncharacteristic length of spatial search by certain functional relationships. A\ndiscovery is that the relationships between the spatial searching radius and\nthe corresponding number of clusters take on an exponential function, in which\nthe scale parameter just represents the characteristic length. Using the\ncharacteristic length, we can define the most objective urban boundary. Two\nsets of Chinese cities are employed to test this method, and the results lend\nsupport to judgment that the characteristic parameter can serve for the spatial\nsearching radius. This study suggests a new way of determining urban boundary\nand determining city size in the right perspective.\n", "  Perovskite light-emitting field-effect transistors (PeLEFETs) provide a\nversatile device architecture to control transport and electroluminescence\nproperties of hybrid perovskites, enabling injection of high charge carrier\ndensity and spatial control of the radiative recombination zone. Ionic\nscreening and organic cation polarization effects typical of metal-halide\nperovskites, however, critically affect PeLEFET efficiency and reliability. In\nthis work, we demonstrate a new device operation mode based on high-frequency\nmodulation of the applied voltages, which allows significant reduction of ionic\ndrift/screening in methylammonium lead iodide light-emitting transistors. In\noptimized top contact PeLEFETs, AC operation results in brighter and more\nuniform electroluminescence compared to DC-driven devices. Moreover, high\nfrequency modulation enables electroluminescence emission up to room\ntemperature.\n", "  Quantum cryptography is set to become a key technology for future secure\ncommunications. However, to get maximum benefit in communication networks,\ntransmission links will need to be shared among several quantum keys for\nseveral independent users. Such links will enable switching in quantum network\nnodes of the quantum keys to their respective destinations. In this paper we\npresent an experimental demonstration of a photonic integrated silicon chip\nquantum key distribution protocols based on space division multiplexing (SDM),\nthrough multicore fiber technology. Parallel and independent quantum keys are\nobtained, which are useful in crypto-systems and future quantum network.\n", "  Using the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid as example, we\nshow that mean first-passage time based methods may underestimate the reaction\nrates. We trace the reason of this deficiency back to the non-Markovian\ncharacter of the dynamics caused by the projection to a poorly chosen reaction\ncoordinate. The non-Markovianity of the dynamics becomes apparent in the\nbehavior of the recurrence times.\n", "  Small pre-structured seeds introduced into an undercooled fluid are known to\nincrease the crystal nucleation rate by some orders of magnitude, if the\nstructure of the seeds is commensurate with the bulk crystalline phase. The\npresence of such seeds also alters the crystallisation mechanism by favouring\nparticular structures at the early stages of the nucleation process. Here, we\nstudy with computer simulations the effect of small face-centred cubic and\nbody-centred cubic seeds on the crystallisation of a Lennard-Jones liquid in\nthe strongly undercooled regime. We find that seeds with body-centred cubic\nstructure lead to a larger enhancement of the crystallisation rate than\nface-centred cubic seeds. An analysis of recurrence times reveals that the size\nof the largest crystalline cluster used as reaction coordinate is affected by\npronounced memory effects, which depend on the particular seed structure and\npoint to the importance of structural information in the definition of a good\nreaction coordinate for crystallisation.\n", "  The absorption energy of atomic hydrogen at rotated graphene bilayers is\nstudied using ab initio methods based on the density functional theory\nincluding van der Waals interactions. We find that, due to the surface\ncorrugation induced by the underneath rotated layer and the perturbation of the\nelectronic density of states near the Fermi energy, the atoms with an almost AA\nstacking are the preferential ones for hydrogen chemisorption. The adsorption\nenergy difference between different atoms can be as large as 80 meV. In\naddition, we find that, due to the logarithmic van Hove singularities in the\nelectronic density of states at energies close to the Dirac point, the\nadsorption energy of either electron or hole doped samples is substantially\nincreased. We also find that the adsorption energy increases with the decrease\nof the rotated angle between the layers. Finally, the large zero point energy\nof the C-H bond (${\\sim 0.3 eV}$) suggests adsorption and desorption of atomic\nhydrogen and deuterium should behave differently.\n", "  Radio frequency (RF) waves can provide heating, current and flow drive, as\nwell as instability control for steady state operations of fusion experiments.\nA particle simulation model has been developed in this work to provide a\nfirst-principles tool for studying the RF nonlinear interactions with plasmas.\nIn this model, ions are considered as fully kinetic particles using the Vlasov\nequation and electrons are treated as guiding centers using the drift kinetic\nequation. This model has been implemented in a global gyrokinetic toroidal code\n(GTC) using real electron-to-ion mass ratio. To verify the model, linear\nsimulations of ion plasma oscillation, ion Bernstein wave, and lower hybrid\nwave are carried out in cylindrical geometry and found to agree well with\nanalytic predictions.\n", "  In this paper, new upper limits on the parameters of the Continuous\nSpontaneous Localization (CSL) collapse model are extracted. To this end, the\nX-ray emission data collected by the IGEX collaboration are analyzed and\ncompared with the spectrum of the spontaneous photon emission process predicted\nby collapse models.\n  This study allows the obtainment of the most stringent limits within a\nrelevant range of the CSL model parameters, with respect to any other method.\nThe collapse rate $\\lambda$ and the correlation length $r_C$ are mapped, thus\nallowing the exclusion of a broad range of the parameter space.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab searches for the charged flavor violating\nconversion of a muon into an electron in the Coulomb field of a nucleus. The\ndetector consists of a straw tube tracker and a CSI crystal electromagnetic\ncalorimeter, both housed in a superconducting solenoid. Both the front-end and\nthe digital electronics, located inside the cryostat, will be operated in\nvacuum under a 1 T magnetic field, having to sustain the high flux of neutrons\nand ionizing particles coming from the muons stopping target. These harsh\nexperimental conditions make the design of the calorimeter waveform digitizer\nquite challenging. All the selected commercial devices must be tested\nindividually and qualified for radiation hardness and operation in high\nmagnetic field. At the moment the expected particles flux and spectra at the\ndigitizers location are not completely simulated and we are using initial rough\nestimates to select the components for the first prototype. We are gaining\nexperience in the qualification procedures using the selected components but\nthe choice will be frozen only when dose and neutron flux simulations will be\ncompleted. The experimental results of the first qualification campaign are\npresented.\n", "  Transport across heterogeneous, patchy environments is a ubiquitous\nphenomenon spanning fields of study including ecological movement,\nintracellular transport and regions of specialised function in a cell. These\nregions or patches may be highly heterogeneous in their properties, and often\nexhibit anomalous behaviour (resulting from e.g. crowding or viscoelastic\neffects) which necessitates the inclusion of non-Markovian dynamics in their\nstudy. However, many such processes are also subject to an internal\nself-regulating or tempering process due to concurrent competing functions\nbeing carried out. In this work we develop a model for anomalous transport\nacross a heterogeneous, patchy environment subject to tempering. We show that\nin the long-time an equilibrium may be reached with constant effective\ntransport rates between the patches. This result is qualitatively different\nfrom untempered systems where subdiffusion results in the long-time\naccumulation of all particles in the patch with lowest anomalous exponent,\n$0<\\mu<1$.\n", "  Electronic structure and the shape of the Fermi surface are known to be of\nfundamental importance for the superconducting instability in real materials.\nWe demonstrate that such an instability may be explored by static Cooper pair\nsusceptibility renormalized by pairing interaction and present an efficient\nmethod of its evaluation using Wannier orbitals derived from ab initio\ncalculation. As an example, this approach is used to search for an\nunconventional superconducting phase of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO) type in a heavy-fermion compound CeCoIn$_5$ and an iron-based\nsuperconductor FeSe. The results suggest that the FFLO superconducting phase\noccurs at finite magnetic field in both materials.\n", "  In composite Higgs models, new composite pseudoscalars can interact with the\nHiggs and with electroweak gauge bosons via anomalous interactions, which stem\nfrom the topological structure of the underlying theory. A future 100 TeV pp\ncollider (FCC-pp) will be able to test these anomalous interactions and thus\nshed light on the strong dynamics which generates the Higgs and other composite\nresonances. We will discuss the topological interactions of a minimal composite\nHiggs model with fermionic ultraviolet completion, based on the coset\nSU(4)/Sp(4). We will indicate the strategy to test these interactions at the\nFCC-pp and the expected reach.\n", "  Drug development is time and cost-consuming: It takes in average 10 years and\n1 billion euros to move from a therapeutic target to a new drug. To speedup\nthis process and reduce its cost, numerical simulation are massively used.\nNevertheless, they remain limited, one reason of which is the huge amount of\nsolvent molecules to consider. The molecular density functional theory is a\nliquid state theory that allows the study of the solvation thermodynamics of\nsolutes of arbitrary shape. MDFT predicts, in few seconds only, the free energy\nof solvation and the solvent profils. These parameters are at the heart of many\nothers calculation used by the pharmaceutical industry. This thesis is the\nfirst step towards these applications. For that purpose, we adapted the theory\nas well as the associated code to this new target, then applied them to system\nof biological interest.\n", "  The structural complexity of soft gels is at the origin of a versatile\nmechanical response that allows for large deformations, controlled elastic\nrecovery and toughness in the same material. A limit to exploiting the\npotential of such materials is the insufficient fundamental understanding of\nthe microstructural origin of the bulk mechanical properties. Here we\ninvestigate the role of the network topology in a model gel through 3D\nnumerical simulations. Our study links the topology of the network organization\nin space to its non-linear rheological response preceding yielding and damage:\nour analysis elucidates how the network connectivity alone could be used to\nmodify the gel mechanics at large strains, from strain-softening to hardening\nand even to a brittle response. These findings provide new insight for smart\nmaterial design and for understanding the non-trivial mechanical response of a\npotentially wide range of technologically relevant materials.\n", "  New Molecular Dynamics simulations have been carried out in order to get an\ninsight on the physical mechanisms that determine the drift mobility of\nnegative Oxygen ions in very dense Neon gas in the supercritical phase close to\nthe critical point. Two ion-neutral interaction potentials have been used that\ndiffer by their repulsive part. We have observed that the potential with a\nharder repulsive part gives much better agreement with the experimental data.\nThe differences with the softer repulsive potential previously used are\ndiscussed. We propose that the behavior of the ion mobility as a function of\nthe gas density is related to the number of neutral atoms loosely bound in the\nfirst solvation shell around the ion.\n", "  Accurate stellar masses are requested in order to improve our understanding\nof stellar interiors, but they are still rather rare. Fortunately, the\nforthcoming Gaia Mission will provide astrometric measurements permitting the\nderivation of the orbital inclinations of nearby binaries which are also\nobserved as double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) with ground-based\ntelescopes. A programme of radial velocity (RV) measurements was initiated in\n2010 with the Sophie spectrograph of the Haute-Provence observatory in order to\nderive accurate SB2 orbits for a large set of stars. Therefore, combined\nSB2+astrometric orbits will be derived thanks to Gaia, and masses with errors\naround 1~\\% are expected for both components. The programme includes 70 SB2s,\nand the accurate SB2 orbits of 24 of them were already derived. In addition,\ntwo complementary programmes devoted to southern stars or to late-type dwarf\nstars were also initiated with the HERMES and the CARMENES spectrographs,\nrespectively. Interferometric measurements were obained with the VLTI/PIONIER\nfor 7 SB2s, and were taken from other sources for 4 others. Currently, combined\n\"visual binary\" (VB) +SB2 solutions were derived for 7 binaries, leading to the\nmasses of the components and to the parallaxes. The parallaxes from the\nHipparcos 2 catalogue were corrected for orbital motion and compared to our\nsolution, confirming the high quality of Hipparcos 2.\n", "  This contribution deals with our recent study of antibaryon interactions with\nthe nuclear medium within the relativistic mean-field approach using antibaryon\ncoupling constants consistent with available experimental data. We performed\ncalculations of $\\bar{B}$ ($\\bar{B}=\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\Lambda}, \\bar{\\Sigma},\n\\bar{\\Xi}$) bound states in selected nuclei. Due to the lack of information on\nthe in-medium antihyperon annihilation near threshold only the $\\bar{p}$\nabsorption was considered. It was described by the imaginary part of a\nphenomenological optical potential fitted to $\\bar{p}$-atom data. The\nannihilation was treated dynamically, taking into account explicitly the\nreduced phase space for annihilation products in the nuclear medium, as well as\nthe compressed nuclear density due to the antiproton. The energy available for\nthe annihilation products was evaluated self-consistently, considering\nadditional energy shift due to particle momenta in the ${\\bar p}$-nucleus\nsystem. Corresponding $\\bar{p}$ widths were significantly reduced, however,\nthey still remain sizable. Next, the $\\bar{p}$-nucleus interaction was\nconstructed using the latest version of the Paris $\\bar{N}N$ potential. Related\nscattering amplitudes were used to define the complex $\\bar{p}$ optical\npotential in the nuclear medium. The resulting $\\bar{p}$ $1s$ binding energies\nare about 10% smaller and widths about 20% larger than those obtained with the\nphenomenological approach.\n", "  Photon statistical measurements on a semiconductor microlaser, obtained using\nsingle-photon counting techniques, show that a newly discovered pulsed emission\nregime is inconsistent with all current theoretical modeling. The observed\nspike dynamics, typical of small-scale devices, is at the origin of an\nunexpected discordance between the probability density function and its\nrepresentation in terms of the first moments, a discordance so far unnoticed in\nall devices (even solid-state microcavities). The impact of this new dynamics\nis potentially large, since coincidence techniques are presently the sole\ncapable of characterizing the light emitted by nanolasers.\n", "  Redfield non-secular master equation governing relaxation of a spin in weak\ninteraction with a thermal bath is studied. Using the fact that the relaxation\nfollows the exponential law, we prove that in most cases the semi-secular\napproximation is sufficient to find the system relaxation rate. Based on this,\na \"secular\" form of the non-secular master equation is for the first time\ndeveloped which correctly set up one of most fundamental equations in\nrelaxation investigation. This key secular form allows us to derive a general\nformula of the phonon-induced quantum tunneling rate which is valid for the\nentire range of temperature regardless of the basis. In incoherent tunneling\nregime and localized basis, this formula reduces to the ubiquitous incoherent\ntunneling rate. Meanwhile, in eigenstates basis, this tunneling rate is\ndemonstrated to be equal to zero. From this secular form, we end the\ncontroversy surrounding the selection of basis for the secular approximation by\nfiguring out the conditions for using this approximation in localized and\neigenstates basis. Particularly, secular approximation in localized basis is\njustified in the regime of high temperature and small tunnel splittings. In\ncontrast, a large ground doublet's tunnel splitting is required for the secular\napproximation in eigenstates basis. With these findings, this research lays a\nsound foundation for any treatments of the spin-phonon relaxation under any\nconditions provided that the non-secular master equation is relevant.\n", "  We study 1 or 2 neighboring Mn impurities, as well as complexes of 1 Mn and 1\nor 2 Mg ions in a 64 atoms supercell of GaN by means of density functional\ncalculations. Taking into account the electron correlation in the local spin\ndensity approximation with explicit correction of the Hubbard term (the LSDA+U\nmethod) and full lattice relaxation we determine the nearest neighbor exchange\nJ for a pair of Mn impurities. We find J to be ferromagnetic and of the order\nof about 18 meV in the Hamiltonian H=-2*J1*J2. That J is only weakly influenced\nby the U parameter (varying between 2 and 8 eV) and by the lattice relaxation.\nFrom a detailed analysis of the magnetization density distribution we get hints\nfor a ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism. Also the Mn valence was found to\nbe 3+ without any doubt in the absence of co-doping with Mg. Co-doping with Mg\nleads to a valence change to 4+ for 1 Mg and to 5+ for 2 Mg. We show that the\nvalence change can already be concluded from a careful analysis of the density\nof states of GaN doped with Mn without any Mg.\n", "  In this note we give a concise review of the present state-of-art for the\nproblem of self-adjoint realisations for the Dirac operator with a Coulomb-like\nsingular scalar potential $V(\\vec x)=\\phi(\\vec x) I_4$. We try to follow the\nhistorical and conceptual path that leads to the present understanding of the\nproblem and to highlight the techniques employed and the main ideas. In the\nfinal part we outline a few major open questions that concern the topical\nproblem of the multiplicity of self-adjoint realisations of the model, and\nwhich are worth addressing in the future.\n", "  In the future-included complex and real action theories whose paths run over\nnot only the past but also the future, we briefly review the theorem on the\nnormalized matrix element of an operator $\\hat{\\cal O}$, which is defined in\nterms of the future and past states with a proper inner product $I_Q$ that\nmakes a given Hamiltonian normal. The theorem states that, provided that the\noperator $\\hat{\\cal O}$ is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e. Hermitian with regard to the\nproper inner product $I_Q$, the normalized matrix element becomes real and\ntime-develops under a $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the past and future states\nselected such that the absolute value of the transition amplitude from the past\nstate to the future state is maximized. Discussing what the theorem implicates,\nwe speculate that the future-included complex action theory would be the most\nelegant quantum theory.\n", "  We show how magnetic observations of the Sun can be used in conjunction with\nan axisymmetric flux-transport solar dynamo model in order to estimate the\nlarge-scale meridional circulation throughout the convection zone. Our\ninnovative approach rests on variational data assimilation, whereby the\ndistance between predictions and observations (measured by an objective\nfunction) is iteratively minimized by means of an optimization algorithm\nseeking the meridional flow which best accounts for the data. The minimization\nis performed using a quasi-Newton technique, which requires the knowledge of\nthe sensitivity of the objective function to the meridional flow. That\nsensitivity is efficiently computed via the integration of the adjoint\nflux-transport dynamo model. Closed-loop (also known as twin) experiments using\nsynthetic data demonstrate the validity and accuracy of this technique, for a\nvariety of meridional flow configurations, ranging from unicellular and\nequatorially symmetric to multicellular and equatorially asymmetric. In this\nwell-controlled synthetic context, we perform a systematic study of the\nbehavior of our variational approach under different observational\nconfigurations, by varying their spatial density, temporal density, noise\nlevel, as well as the width of the assimilation window. We find that the method\nis remarkably robust, leading in most cases to a recovery of the true\nmeridional flow to within better than 1%. These encouraging results are a first\nstep towards using this technique to i) better constrain the physical processes\noccurring inside the Sun and ii) better predict solar activity on decadal time\nscales.\n", "  Many Heusler compounds possess magnetic properties well-suited for\napplications as spintronic materials. The pseudo-binary\nMn$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ru$_2$Sn, formed as a solid solution of two full Heuslers,\nhas recently been shown to exhibit exchange hardening suggestive of two\nmagnetic phases, despite existing as a \\textit{single} chemical phase. We have\nperformed a first-principles study of the chemical and magnetic degrees of\nfreedom in the Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ru$_2$Sn pseudo-binary to determine the origin\nof the unique magnetic behavior responsible for exchange hardening within a\nsingle phase. We find a transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to\nferromagnetic (FM) behavior upon replacement of Mn with Fe, consistent with\nexperimental results. The lowest energy orderings in Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ru$_2$Sn\nconsist of chemically- and magnetically-uniform (111) planes, with Fe-rich\nregions preferring FM ordering and Mn-rich regions preferring AFM ordering,\nindependent of the overall composition. Analysis of the electronic structure\nsuggests that the magnetic behavior of this alloy arises from a competition\nbetween AFM-favoring Sn-mediated superexchange and FM-favoring RKKY exchange\nmediated by spin-polarized conduction electrons. Changes in valency upon\nreplacement of Mn with Fe shifts the balance from superexchange-dominated\ninteractions to RKKY-dominated interactions.\n", "  We present a catalog of extragalactic proper motions created using archival\nVLBI data and our own VLBA astrometry. The catalog contains 713 proper motions,\nwith average uncertainties of ~ 24 muas/yr, including 40 new or improved proper\nmotion measurements using relative astrometry with the VLBA. The observations\nwere conducted in X-band and yielded positions with uncertainties ~ 70 muas. We\nadd 10 new redshifts using spectroscopic observations taken at Apache Point\nObservatory and Gemini North. With the VLBA Extragalactic Proper Motion\nCatalog, we detect the secular aberration drift - the apparent motion of\nextragalactic objects caused by the solar system's acceleration around the\nGalactic center - at a 6.3 sigma significance. We model the aberration drift as\na spheroidal dipole, with the square root of the power equal to 4.89 +/- 0.77\nmuas/yr, an amplitude of 1.69 +/- 0.27 muas/yr, and an apex at (275.2 +/- 10.0\ndeg, -29.4 +/- 8.8 deg). Our dipole model detects the aberration drift at a\nhigher significance than some previous studies (e.g., Titov & Lambert 2013),\nbut at a lower amplitude than expected or previously measured. The full\naberration drift may be partially removed by the no-net-rotation constraint\nused when measuring archival extragalactic radio source positions. Like the\ncosmic microwave background dipole, which is induced by the observer's motion,\nthe aberration drift signal should be subtracted from extragalactic proper\nmotions in order to detect cosmological proper motions, including the Hubble\nexpansion, long-period stochastic gravitational waves, and the collapse of\nlarge-scale structure.\n", "  We study rogue wave excitation dynamics on a double-plane wave background\nthrough deriving rogue wave solution on the background. The results indicate\nthat rogue wave still can be excited successfully from resonant perturbations\nwith the two plane wave backgrounds. The obtained vector rogue wave can be\ndecomposed to two rogue waves located on the two backgrounds separately. This\nenables us to investigate the superpositions of two of the three well-known\nfundamental rogue wave patterns, mainly including eye-shaped, anti-eye-shaped,\nand four-petaled one. The explicit conditions for different possible\nsuperpositions are clarified by a phase diagram for rogue wave pattern on each\nplane wave background. The detail analysis indicate that the rogue wave admits\nmany different profiles, in contrast to the ones reported before. The studies\ncan be extended directly to investigate other localized waves on double-plane\nwave background and even more plane waves involved cases.\n", "  We perturbatively study form factors in the Landau-Lifshitz model and the\ngeneralisation originating in the study of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills dilatation\ngenerator. In particular we study diagonal form factors which have previously\nbeen related to gauge theory structure constants. For the Landau-Lifshitz\nmodel, due to the non-relativistic nature of the theory, we are able to compute\nall orders in perturbation theory and to resum the series to find quantum form\nfactors for low numbers of external particles. We apply our form factors to the\nstudy of deformations of the integrable theory by means of form factor\nperturbation theory. As a check of our method we compute spin-chain S-matrix\nelements for the Leigh-Strassler family of marginal deformations to leading\norder in the deformation parameters.\n"]}
