restrict to\nits traveling waves. The method which yields explicitly all the elliptic or\ndegenerate elliptic solutions of a given nonlinear, any order algebraic\nordinary differential equation is briefly recalled. We then apply it to the\nfluid system and, restricting in this preliminary report to the generic\nsituation, we obtain all the solutions in that class, including several new\nsolutions.\n", "  We study the geometry and topology of (filtered) algebra-bundles\n${\\bf\\Psi}^{\\mathbb Z}$ over a smooth manifold $X$ with typical fibre\n$\\Psi^{\\mathbb Z}(Z; V)$, the algebra of classical pseudodifferential operators\nof integral order on the compact manifold $Z$ acting on smooth sections of a\nvector bundle $V$. First a theorem of Duistermaat and Singer is generalized to\nthe assertion that the group of projective invertible Fourier integral\noperators ${\\rm PGL}({\\mathcal F}^\\bullet(Z; V))$, is precisely the\nautomorphism group, ${\\rm Aut}(\\Psi^{\\mathbb Z}(Z; V)),$ of the filtered\nalgebra of pseudodifferential operators. We replace some of the arguments in\ntheir paper by microlocal ones, thereby removing the topological assumption\nwell as extending their result to sections of a vector bundle. We define a\nnatural class of connections and B-fields the principal bundle to which\n${\\bf\\Psi}^{\\mathbb Z}$ is associated and obtain a de Rham representative of\nthe Dixmier-Douady class, in terms of the outer derivation on the Lie algebra\nand the residue trace of Guillemin and Wodzicki; the resulting formula only\ndepends on the formal symbol algebra ${\\bf\\Psi}^{\\mathbb\nZ}/{\\bf\\Psi}^{-\\infty}.$ Examples of pseudodifferential algebra bundles are\ngiven that are not associated to a finite dimensional fibre bundle over $X.$\n", "  Let X be a translation invariant point process on the complex plane and let D\nbe a bounded open set whose boundary has zero Lebesgue measure. We ask what\ndoes the point configuration obtained by taking the points of X outside D tell\nus about the point configuration inside D? We show that for the Ginibre\nensemble, it determines the number of points in D. For the\ntranslation-invariant zero process of a planar Gaussian Analytic Function, we\nshow that it determines the number as well as the centre of mass of the points\nin D. Further, in both models we prove that the outside says \"nothing more\"\nabout the inside, in the sense that the conditional distribution of the inside\npoints, given the outside, is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to\nthe Lebesgue measure on its supporting submanifold.\n", "  Reaction networks are a general formalism for describing collections of\nclassical entities interacting in a random way. While reaction networks are\nmainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used\nfor similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and\nothers, techniques from quantum field theory can be adapted to apply to such\nsystems. Here we use these techniques to study how the \"master equation\"\ndescribing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network is related to the\n\"rate equation\" describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number\nof particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the\nrelation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a \"coherent\nstate\", meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by\nindependent Poisson distributions.\n", "  Silicon nitride (SiN) micro- and nanomechanical resonators have attracted a\nlot of attention in various research fields due to their exceptionally high\nquality factors ($Q$s). Despite their popularity, the origin of the limiting\nloss mechanisms in these structures has remained controversial. In this paper\nwe propose an analytical model combining acoustic radiation loss with intrinsic\nloss. The model accurately predicts the resulting mode-dependent $Q$s of a\nlow-stress silicon-rich and a high-stress stoichiometric SiN membrane. The\nlarge acoustic mismatch of the low-stress membrane to the substrate seems to\nminimize radiation loss and $Q$s of higher modes ($n \\wedge m \\geq 3$) are\nlimited by intrinsic losses. The study of these intrinsic losses in low-stress\nmembranes with varying lengths $L$ and thicknesses $h$ reveals an inverse\nlinear dependence of the intrinsic loss with $h$ for thin resonators\nindependent of $L$. This finding was confirmed by comparing the intrinsic\ndissipation of arbitrary (membranes, strings, and cantilevers) SiN resonators\nextracted from literature, suggesting surface loss as ubiquitous damping\nmechanism in thin SiN resonators with $Q_{surf} = \\beta \\cdot h$ and $\\beta =\n6\\times10^{10} \\pm4\\times 10^{10}$~m$^{-1}$. Based on the intrinsic loss the\nmaximal achievable $Q$s and $Q\\cdot f$ products for SiN membranes and strings\nare outlined.\n", "  The eigenstates of a quantum spin glass Hamiltonian with long-range\ninteraction are examined from the point of view of localisation and\nentanglement. In particular, low particle sectors are examined and an anomalous\nfamily of eigenstates is found that is more delocalised but also has larger\ninter-spin entanglement. These are then identified as particle-added\neigenstates from the one-particle sector. This motivates the introduction and\nthe study of random promoted two-particle states, and it is shown that they may\nhave large delocalisation such as generic ran- dom states and scale exactly\nlike them. However, the entanglement as measured by two-spin concurrence\ndisplays different scaling with the total number of spins. This shows how for\ndifferent classes of complex quantum states entanglement can be qualitatively\ndifferent even if localisation measures such as participation ratio are not.\n", "  We provide a unified description of efficiency correction and error\nestimation for moments of conserved quantifies in heavy-ion collisions. Moments\nand cumulants are expressed in terms of the factorial moments, which can be\neasily corrected for the efficiency effect. By deriving the covariance between\nfactorial moments, one can obtain the general error formula for the efficiency\ncorrected moments based on the error propagation derived from the Delta\ntheorem. The skellam distribution based Monto Carlo simulation is used to test\nthe Delta theorem and Bootstrap error estimation methods. The statistical\nerrors calculated from the two methods can well reflect the statistical\nfluctuations of the efficiency corrected moments.\n", "  We report a Dalitz plot analysis of charmless hadronic decays of charged $B$\nmesons to the final state $K_{\\rm S}^{0}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{0}$ using the full BaBar\ndataset of $470.9\\pm2.8$ million $B\\bar{B}$ events collected at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance. We measure the overall branching fraction and $CP$\nasymmetry to be ${\\cal B}\\left(B^{+}\\to K^{0}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{0}\\right) = \\left(45.9\n\\pm 2.6 \\pm 3.0^{+8.6}_{-0.0}\\right)\\times10^{-6}$ and $A_{CP}\\left(B^{+}\\to\nK^{0}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{0}\\right) = 0.07 \\pm 0.05 \\pm 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, where the\nuncertainties are statistical, systematic, and due to the signal model,\nrespectively. This is the first measurement of the branching fraction for\n$B^{+} \\to K^{0}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{0}$. We find first evidence of a $CP$ asymmetry in\n$B^{+}\\to K^{*}(892)^{+}\\pi^{0}$ decays: $A_{CP}\\left(B^{+}\\to\nK^{*}(892)^{+}\\pi^{0}\\right)=-0.52 \\pm 0.14 \\pm 0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$. The\nsignificance of this asymmetry, including systematic and model uncertainties,\nis $3.4$ standard deviations. We also measure the branching fractions and $CP$\nasymmetries for three other intermediate decay modes.\n", "  Phase selection in deeply undercooled liquids and devitrified glasses during\nheating involves complex interplay between the barriers to nucleation and the\nability for these nuclei to grow. During the devitrification of glassy alloys,\ncomplicated metastable structures often precipitate instead of simpler, more\nstable compounds. Here, we access this unconventional type of phase selections\nby investigating an Al-10%Sm system, where a complicated cubic structure first\nprecipitates with a large lattice parameter of 1.4 nm. We not only solve the\nstructure of this \"big cubic\" phase containing ~140 atoms but establish an\nexplicit interconnection between the structural orderings of the amorphous\nalloy and the cubic phase, which provides a low-barrier nucleation pathway at\nlow temperatures. The surprising rapid growth of the crystal is attributed to\nits high tolerance to point defects, which minimize the short-scale atomic\nrearrangements to form the crystal. Our study suggests a new scenario of\ndevitrification, where phase transformation proceeds initially without\npartitioning through a complex intermediate crystal phase.\n", "  High-fidelity, efficient quantum nondemolition readout of quantum bits is\nintegral to the goal of quantum computation. As superconducting circuits\napproach the requirements of scalable, universal fault tolerance, qubit readout\nmust also meet the demand of simplicity to scale with growing system size. Here\nwe propose a fast, high-fidelity, scalable measurement scheme based on the\nstate-selective ring-up of a cavity followed by photodetection with the\nrecently introduced Josephson photomultiplier (JPM), a current-biased Josephson\njunction. This scheme maps qubit state information to the binary digital output\nof the JPM, circumventing the need for room-temperature heterodyne detection\nand offering the possibility of a cryogenic interface to superconducting\ndigital control circuitry. Numerics show that measurement contrast in excess of\n95% is achievable in a measurement time of 140 ns. We discuss perspectives to\nscale this scheme to enable readout of multiple qubit channels with a single\nJPM.\n", "  We provide a scheme for inferring causal relations from uncontrolled\nstatistical data based on tools from computational algebraic geometry, in\nparticular, the computation of Groebner bases. We focus on causal structures\ncontaining just two observed variables, each of which is binary. We consider\nthe consequences of imposing different restrictions on the number and\ncardinality of latent variables and of assuming different functional\ndependences of the observed variables on the latent ones (in particular, the\nnoise need not be additive). We provide an inductive scheme for classifying\nfunctional causal structures into distinct observational equivalence classes.\nFor each observational equivalence class, we provide a procedure for deriving\nconstraints on the joint distribution that are necessary and sufficient\nconditions for it to arise from a model in that class. We also demonstrate how\nthis sort of approach provides a means of determining which causal parameters\nare identifiable and how to solve for these. Prospects for expanding the scope\nof our scheme, in particular to the problem of quantum causal inference, are\nalso discussed.\n", "  The study is devoted to radial pulsations in Population I Cepheids with\nmasses from 5.4 to 6 Msun. Solution of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics\nand turbulent convection for nonlinear stellar pulsations was obtained with\ninitial conditions as the core helium burning models of computed evolutionary\nsequences. For each value of the initial mass we considered stellar evolution\nfrom the zero age main sequence to central helium exhaustion with three values\nof the convective overshoot parameter: aov=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2. Models for the\nCepheid SZ Tau with pulsation period 3.149 day can be constructed only for\naov=0.1 and aov=0.15. The star is at the evolutionary stage of the second\ncrossing of the instability strip and pulsates in the first overtone just near\nthe boundary between the fundamental mode and the first overtone. The mass,\nradius and age of the star are in the ranges 5.46 <= M/Msun <= 5.75, 41.5 <=\nR/Rsun <= 42.3 and 6.9e7 yr <= t <= 8.0e7 yr, respectively. Predicted period\nchange rates are of -0.4 s/yr.\n", "  The intrinsic instability of underdoped copper oxides towards inhomogeneous\nstates is one of the central puzzles of the physics of correlated materials.\nThe influence of the Mott physics on the doping-temperature phase diagram of\ncopper oxides represents a major issue that is subject of intense theoretical\nand experimental effort. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics\nin prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the\nO-2p$\\rightarrow$Cu-3d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear\nevolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott\ninsulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This\nreorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical\ndoping p$_{cr}\\simeq$0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well\ndescribed by dynamical mean field theory calculations. We argue that the onset\nof the low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of\nthe underlying Mottness that characterizes the p<p$_{cr}$ region of the phase\ndiagram. This discovery sets a new framework for theories of charge order and\nlow-temperature phases in underdoped copper oxides.\n", "  We establish Strichartz estimates in similarity coordinates for the radial\nwave equation in three spatial dimensions with a (time-dependent) self-similar\npotential. As an application we consider the critical wave equation and prove\nthe asymptotic stability of the ODE blowup profile in the energy space.\n", "  We describe the observing strategy, data reduction tools and early results of\na supernova (SN) search project, named SUDARE, conducted with the ESO VST\ntelescope aimed at measuring the rate of the different types of SNe in the\nredshift range 0.2<z<0.8. The search was performed in two of the best-studied\nextragalactic fields, CDFS and COSMOS, for which a wealth of ancillary data are\navailable in the literature or public archives.\n  (abridged)\n  We obtained a final sample of 117 SNe, most of which are SNIa (57%) and the\nremaining core collapse events of which 44% type II, 22% type IIn and 34% type\nIb/c. In order to link the transients, we built a catalog of ~1.3x10^5 galaxies\nin the redshift range 0<z<1 with a limiting magnitude K_AB=23.5 mag. We\nmeasured the SN rate per unit volume for SN Ia and core collapse SNe in\ndifferent bin of redshifts. The values are consistent with other measurements\nfrom the literature. The dispersion of the rate measurements for SNe Ia is\ncomparable with the scatter of the theoretical tracks for single (SD) and\ndouble degenerate (DD) binary systems models, therefore the data do not allow\nto disentangle among the two different progenitor scenarios. However, we may\nnotice that among the three tested models, SD and two flavours of DD, either\nwith a steep (DDC) or a wide (DDW) delay time distribution, the SD gives a\nbetter fit across the whole redshift range whereas the DDC better matches the\nsteep rise up to redshift ~1.2. The DDW appears instead less favoured. The core\ncollapse SN rate is fully consistent, unlike recent claims, with the prediction\nbased on recent estimates of the star formation history, and standard\nprogenitor mass range.\n", "  We show that without quantum correlations, energy cannot flow. The result\nfollows from a simple theorem that shows that systems whose dynamics do not\ngenerate quantum discord are effectively non-interacting. We show that the rate\nof heat transfer between two quantum systems at different temperatures is\ndirectly proportional to the instantaneous rate of increase of\ndiagonal/energetic discord between the systems. Consequently, nanoscale heat\ntransfer experiments can be used to measure discord directly. We report the\nresults of a measurement of the increase in discord due to nanoscale heat flow\nacross an aluminum-sapphire interface and find it to be $4.28 \\times 10^{24}$\n${\\rm bits}\\,{\\rm m^{-2}}\\,{\\rm K^{-1}}\\,{\\rm s^{-1}}$.\n", "  It is known that the spectral type of the almost Mathieu operator depends in\na fundamental way on both the strength of the coupling constant and the\narithmetic properties of the frequency. We study the competition between those\nfactors and locate the point where the phase transition from singular\ncontinuous spectrum to pure point spectrum takes place, which solves\nJitomirskaya's conjecture in \\cite{Ji95,J07}. Together with \\cite{Aab}, we give\nthe sharp description of phase transitions for the almost Mathieu operator.\n", "  We start with Fannes' type and Winter's type tight continuity bounds for the\nquantum conditional mutual information and their specifications for states of\nspecial types.\n  Then we analyse continuity of the Holevo quantity with respect to\nnonequivalent metrics on the set of discrete ensembles of quantum states. We\nshow that the Holevo quantity is continuous on the set of all ensembles of m\nstates with respect to all the metrics if either m or the dimension of\nunderlying Hilbert space is finite and obtain Fannes' type tight continuity\nbounds for the Holevo quantity in this case.\n  In general case conditions for local continuity of the Holevo quantity for\ndiscrete and continuous ensembles are found. Winter's type tight continuity\nbound for the Holevo quantity under constraint on the average energy of\nensembles is obtained and applied to the system of quantum oscillators.\n  The above results are used to obtain tight and close-to-tight continuity\nbounds for basic capacities of finite-dimensional channels (refining the\nLeung-Smith continuity bounds).\n", "  We investigate the issue in determining the significance of candidate\ntransient gravitational-wave events in a ground-based interferometer network.\nGiven the presence of non-Gaussian noise artefacts in real data, the noise\nbackground must be estimated empirically from the data itself. However, the\ndata also potentially contains signals, thus the background estimate may be\noverstated due to contributions from signals. It has been proposed to mitigate\npossible bias by removing single-detector data samples that pass a\nmulti-detector consistency test from the background estimates. We conduct a\nhigh-statistics Mock Data Challenge to evaluate the effects of removing such\nsamples, modelling a range of scenarios with plausible detector noise\ndistributions and with a range of plausible foreground astrophysical signal\nrates. We consider the two different modes: one in which coincident samples are\nremoved, and one in which all samples are retained and used. Three algorithms\nwere operated in both modes, show good consistency with each other; however,\ndiscrepancies arise between the results obtained under the \"coincidence\nremoval\" and \"all samples\" modes, for false alarm probabilities below a certain\nvalue. In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nestimator under the \"all samples\" mode is consistent with the exact FAP. On the\nother hand the \"coincidence removal\" mode is found to be unbiased for the mean\nof the estimated FAP. While the numerical values at which discrepancies become\napparent are specific to the details of our experiment, we believe that the\nqualitative differences in the behaviour of the median and mean of the FAP\nestimator have more general validity. On the basis of our study we suggest that\nthe FAP of candidates for the first detection of gravitational waves should be\nestimated without removing single-detector samples that form coincidences.\n", "  We numerically compute the low-energy spectrum of a gate-controlled\nsuperconducting topological nanowire segmented into two islands, each\nJosephson-coupled to a bulk superconductor. This device may host two pairs of\nMajorana bound states and could provide a platform for testing Majorana fusion\nrules. We analyze the crossover between (i) a charge-dominated regime\nutilizable for initialization and readout of Majorana bound states, (ii) a\nsingle-island regime for dominating inter-island Majorana coupling, (iii) a\nJosephson-plasmon regime for large coupling to the bulk superconductors, and\n(iv) a regime of four Majorana bound states allowing for topologically\nprotected Majorana manipulations. From the energy spectrum, we derive\nconservative estimates for the time scales of a fusion-rule testing protocol\nproposed recently [arXiv:1511.05153]. We also analyze the steps needed for\nbasic Majorana braiding operations in branched nanowire structures.\n", "  We summarize the current status of baryon number violation in supersymmetry\nand provide prospects for going beyond the present reach by means of a new\nsearch for neutron-antineutron oscillations. The main motivation is the\nrecently proposed neutron-antineutron oscillation experiment at the European\nSpallation Source in Lund, Sweden, which is projected to be able to improve the\ncurrent bound on the transition probability in the quasi-free regime by three\norders of magnitude. We consider various processes involving superpartners that\ngive rise to neutron-antineutron oscillations and extract the corresponding\nsimplified models, including only the most relevant superpartners and\ncouplings. In terms of these models we recast and determine the exclusion\nlimits from LHC searches as well as from searches for flavor transitions, CP\nviolation and di-nucleon decays. We find that, for certain regions of the\nparameter space, the proposed neutron-antineutron experiment has a reach that\ngoes beyond all other experiments, as it can probe gluino and squark masses in\nthe multi-TeV range.\n", "  Models of bacterial growth tend to be `irreversible', allowing for the number\nof bacteria in a colony to increase but not to decrease. By contrast, models of\nmolecular self-assembly are usually `reversible', allowing for addition and\nremoval of particles to a structure. Such processes differ in a fundamental way\nbecause only reversible processes possess an equilibrium. Here we show at\nmean-field level that dynamic trajectories of reversible and irreversible\ngrowth processes are similar in that both feel the influence of attractors, at\nwhich growth proceeds without limit but the intensive properties of the system\nare invariant. Attractors of both processes undergo nonequilibrium phase\ntransitions as model parameters are varied, suggesting a unified way of\ndescribing reversible and irreversible growth. We also establish a connection\nat mean-field level between an irreversible model of growth (the magnetic Eden\nmodel) and the equilibrium Ising model, supporting the findings made by other\nauthors using numerical simulations.\n", "  Dynamical phases with novel topological properties are known to arise in\ndriven systems of free fermions. In this paper, we obtain a `periodic table' to\ndescribe the phases of such time-dependent systems, generalizing the periodic\ntable for static topological insulators. Using K-theory, we systematically\nclassify Floquet topological insulators from the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry\nclasses across all dimensions. We find that the static classification scheme\ndescribed by a group $G$ becomes $G\\times G$ in the time-dependent case, and\ninterpret the two factors as arising from the bipartite decomposition of the\nunitary time-evolution operator. Topologically protected edge modes may arise\nat the boundary between two Floquet systems, and we provide a mapping between\nthe number of such edge modes and the topological invariant of the bulk.\n", "  Glauber models based on nucleon--nucleon interactions are commonly used to\ncharacterize the initial state in high-energy nuclear collisions, and the\ndependence of its properties on impact parameter or number of participating\nnucleons. In this paper, an extension to the Glauber model is presented, which\naccounts for an arbitrary number of effective sub-nucleon degrees of freedom,\nor active constituents, in the nucleons. Properties of the initial state, such\nas the number of constituent participants and collisions, as well as\neccentricity and triangularity, are calculated and systematically compared for\ndifferent assumptions of how to distribute the sub-nuclear degrees of freedom\nand for various collision systems. It is demonstrated that at high collision\nenergy the number of produced particles scales with an average number of\nsub-nucleon degrees of freedom of between $3$ and $5$. The source codes for the\nconstituent Monte Carlo Glauber extension, as well as for the calculation of\nthe overlap area and participant density in a standard Glauber model, are made\npublicly available.\n", "  In the present report we analyze the eventual modifications caused by the\npolymer quantization upon the ground state of a homogeneous one-dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate. We obtain the ground state energy of the\ncorresponding N-body system and, consequently, the corresponding speed of\nsound, allowing us to explore the sensitivity of the system to corrections\ncaused by the polymer quantization. The corrections arising from the polymer\nquantization can be improved for dense systems together with small values of\nthe corresponding one-dimensional scattering length. However, these corrections\nremain constrained due to finite size effects of the system. The contributions\nof the polymer length scale to the properties of the ground state energy of the\nsystem allow us to explore, as a first approximation and when the Bogoliubov's\nformalism is valid, the sensitivity of this many-body system to traces caused\nby the discreteness of space suggested by the polymer quantization.\n", "  Pulsation period changes in Mira type variables are investigated using the\nstellar evolution and nonlinear stellar pulsation calculations. We considered\nthe evolutionary sequence of stellar models with initial mass 3 Msol and\npopulation I composition. Pulsations of stars in the early stage of the\nasymptotic giant branch are shown to be due to instability of the fundamental\nmode. In the later stage of evolution when the helium shell source becomes\nthermally unstable the stellar oscillations arise in either the fundamental\nmode (for the stellar luminosity L < 5.4e3 Lsol) or the first overtone (L > 7e3\nLsol). Excitation of pulsations is due to the kappa-mechanism in the hydrogen\nionization zone. Stars with intermediate luminosities 5.4e3 < L/Lsol < 7e3 were\nfound to be stable against radial oscillations. The pulsation period was\ndetermined as a function of evolutionary time and period change rates \\dot\\Pi\nwere evaluated for the first ten helium flashes. The period change rate becomes\nthe largest in absolute value (\\dot\\Pi/\\Pi\\approx -0.01 per year) between the\nhelium flash and the maximum of the stellar luminosity. Period changes with\nrate |\\dot\\Pi/\\Pi| > 1e-3 per year take place during approx 500 years, that is\nnearly one hundredth of the interval between helium flashes.\n", "  We investigate the ultraviolet and infrared fixed point structure of\ngauge-Yukawa theories featuring a single gauge coupling, Yukawa coupling and\nscalar self coupling. Our investigations are performed using the two loop gauge\nbeta function, one loop Yukawa beta function and one loop scalar beta function.\nWe provide the general conditions that the beta function coefficients must\nabide for the theory to be completely asymptotically free while simultaneously\npossessing an infrared stable fixed point. We also uncover special trajectories\nin coupling space along which some couplings are both asymptotically safe and\ninfrared conformal.\n", "  We provide the first explicit proposal for all microstates of generic black\nholes in three dimensions (of Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-type): black hole\nmicrostates, termed \"horizon fluffs\", are a particular class of near horizon\nsoft hairs which have zero energy as measured by the horizon observer and\ncannot be distinguished by observers at finite distance from the horizon. These\nstates are arranged in orbits of the two-dimensional conformal algebra\nassociated with the asymptotic black hole geometry. We count these microstates\nusing the Hardy-Ramanujan formula for the number of partitions of a given\ninteger into non-negative integers, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\nWe discuss possible extensions of our black hole microstate construction to\nastrophysical Kerr-type black holes.\n", "  Hydrodynamical instabilities and shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical\nscenarios. Therefore, an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is\nmandatory to correctly model and understand many astrophysical events, such as\nSupernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In this work, we\nattempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical\ninstabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that\nincludes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new\nones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the\nEuler-Lagrange formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are:\nthe use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a\nflexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing\ninstability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which\nprovides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,\nwhich consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice\nrelies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy,\nentropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. The coupling\nbetween the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of\nvolume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help\nto suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in regular SPH codes. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the\nverification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial\nconditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than\nthose obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent\ndensity-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel\n(CRKSPH) techniques.\n", "  In this work the homogeneous and isotropic Universe of\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker is studied in the presence of two fluids: stiff\nmatter and radiation described by the Schutz's formalism. We obtain to the\nclassic case the behaviour of the scale factor of the universe. For the quantum\ncase the wave packets are constructed and the wave function of the universe is\nfound.\n", "  This paper presents an alternative approach of analyzing possibly multitype\npoint patterns in space and space-time that occur on network structures, and\nintroduces several different graph-related intensity measures. The proposed\nformalism allows to control for processes on undirected, directional as well as\npartially directed network structures and is not restricted to linearity or\ncircularity.\n", "  A study of ice formation in stationary turbulent conditions is carried out in\nvarious limit regimes of crystal growth, supercooling and ice entrainment at\nthe water surface. Analytical expressions for the temperature, salinity and ice\nconcentration mean profiles are provided, and the role of fluctuations in ice\nproduction is numerically quantified. Lower bounds on the ratio of sensible\nheat flux to latent heat flux to the atmosphere are derived and their\ndependence on key parameters such as salt restitution in freezing and ice\nentrainment in the water column is elucidated.\n", "  We explore the phase diagram of Ising spins on one-dimensional chains which\ncriss-cross in two perpendicular directions and which are connected by\ninterchain couplings. This system is of interest as a simpler, classical analog\nof a quantum Hamiltonian which has been proposed as a model of magnetic\nbehavior in Nb$_{12}$O$_{29}$ and also, conceptually, as a geometry which is\nintermediate between one and two dimensions. Using mean field theory as well as\nMetropolis Monte Carlo and Wang-Landau simulations, we locate quantitatively\nthe boundaries of four ordered phases. Each becomes an effective Ising model\nwith unique effective couplings at large interchain coupling. Away from this\nlimit we demonstrate non-trivial critical behavior, including tricritical\npoints which separate first and second order phase transitions. Finally, we\npresent evidence that this model belongs to the 2D Ising universality class.\n", "  We report ultra-strong high-order nonlinear multiphoton processes in\nmonolayer MoS$_2$ (1L-MoS$_2$): the third harmonic is thirty times stronger\nthan the second harmonic, and the fourth harmonic is comparable to the second\nharmonic. We find that second and third harmonic processes are strongly\ndependent on elliptical polarization, which can be used to selectively tune\nharmonic generation with different orders. We explain this by calculating the\nnonlinear response functions of 1L-MoS$_2$ with a continuum-model Hamiltonian\nand quantum-mechanical diagrammatic perturbation theory, highlighting the\ncrucial role of trigonal warping. A similar effect is expected for all other\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides. Our results pave the way for efficient and\ntunable harmonic generation based on layered materials for various\napplications, including microscopy and imaging\n", "  Due to fundamental interest and potential applications in quantum\ncomputation, tremendous efforts have been invested to study topological\nsuperconductivity. However, bulk topological superconductivity seems to be\ndifficult to realize and its mechanism is still elusive. Several possible\nroutes to induce topological superconductivity have been proposed, including\nproximity efforts, doping or pressurizing a topological insulator or semimetal.\nAmong them, the pressurizing is considered to be a clean way to tune the\nelectronic structures. Here we report the discovery of a pressure-induced\ntopological and superconducting phase of SnSe, a material which is highly\nfocused recently due to its superior thermoelectric properties. In situ\nhigh-pressure electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements show that the superconductivity emerges along with the formation\nof a CsCl-type structural symmetry of SnSe above around 27 GPa, with a maximum\ncritical temperature of 3.2 K at 39 GPa. Based on ab initio calculations, this\nCsCl-type SnSe is predicted to be a Dirac line nodes (DLN) semimetal in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling, whose DLN states are protected by the\ncoexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These results make\nCsCl-type SnSe an interesting model platform with simple crystal symmetry to\nstudy the interplay of topological physics and superconductivity.\n", "  We report the results for charge radii of heavy flavored mesons ($D^+, D^0,\nD^+_s, B^+, B^0, B^0_s$) in an improved QCD potential model. To enhance the\neffectiveness of short range and long range effect of the potential\n$V(r)=-4\\frac{\\alpha_s}{3r}+br+c$ in the perturbative procedure a cut-off\nparameter $r^P$ is introduced as an integration limit. The obtained results are\nfound to be comparable with other available data. The limitation of the\napproach is discussed in the manuscript.\n", "  We model theoretically a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) covered by a\nsuperconductor and demonstrate that topological superconducting channels are\nformed when stripes of the superconducting layer are removed. As a consequence,\nMajorana bound states (MBS) are created at the ends of the stripes. We\ncalculate the topological invariant and energy gap of a single stripe, using\nrealistic values for an InAs 2DEG proximitized by an epitaxial Al layer. We\nshow that the topological gap is enhanced when the structure is made\nasymmetric. This can be achieved by either imposing a phase difference (by\ndriving a supercurrent or using a magnetic-flux loop) over the strip or by\nreplacing one superconductor by a metallic gate. Both strategies also enable\ncontrol over the MBS splitting, thereby facilitating braiding and readout\nschemes based on controlled fusion of MBS. Finally, we outline how a network of\nMajorana stripes can be designed.\n", "  The Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest is a highly non-linear field with a lot of\ninformation available in the data beyond the power spectrum. The flux\nprobability distribution function (PDF) has been used as a successful probe of\nsmall-scale physics. In this paper we argue that measuring coefficients of the\nLegendre polyonomial expansion of the PDF offers several advantages over\nmeasuring the binned values as is commonly done. In particular, $n$-th\ncoefficient can be expressed as a linear combination of the first $n$ moments,\nallowing these coefficients to be measured in the presence of noise and\nallowing a clear route for marginalisation over mean flux. Moreover, in the\npresence of noise, our numerical work shows that a finite number of\ncoefficients are well measured with a very sharp transition into noise\ndominance. This compresses the available information into a small number of\nwell-measured quantities. We find that the amount of recoverable information is\na very non-linear function of spectral noise that strongly favors fewer quasars\nmeasured at better signal to noise.\n", "  The notions of qubits and coherent states correspond to different physical\nsystems and are described by specific formalisms. Qubits are associated with a\ntwo-dimensional Hilbert space and can be illustrated on the Bloch sphere. In\ncontrast, the underlying Hilbert space of coherent states is\ninfinite-dimensional and the states are typically represented in phase space.\nFor the particular case of binary coherent state alphabets these otherwise\ndistinct formalisms can equally be applied. We capitalize this formal\nconnection to analyse the properties of optimally cloned binary coherent\nstates. Several practical and near-optimal cloning schemes are discussed and\nthe associated fidelities are compared to the performance of the optimal\ncloner.\n", "  In the proposed model with interaction between dark energy and dark matter,\nwe consider cosmological scenarios with different equations of state ($w_d$)\nfor dark energy. For both constant and variable equation of state, we analyze\nsolutions for dark energy and dark matter in seven variants of the model. We\ninvestigate exact analytic solutions for $w_d={}$ constant equation of state,\nand several variants of the model for variable $w_d$. These scenarios are\ntested with the current astronomical data from Type Ia Supernovae, baryon\nacoustic oscillations, Hubble parameter $H (z)$ and the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation. Finally, we make a statistical comparison of our\ninteracting model with $\\Lambda$CDM as well as with some other well known\nnon-interacting cosmological models.\n", "  We develop an approach to apply Wang-Landau algorithm to multicomponent\nalloys in semi-grand-canonical ensemble. Although the Wang-Landau algorithm has\ngreat advantages over conventional sampling methods, there are few applications\nto alloys. This is because calculating compositions in semi-grand-canonical\nensemble using the Wang-Landau algorithm requires a multi-dimensional density\nof states in terms of total energy and compositions. However, constructing the\nmulti-dimensional density of states is difficult. In this study, we develop a\nsimple approach to calculate the alloy phase diagram using Wang-Landau\nalgorithm, and show that compositions in semi-grand-canonical ensemble require\njust some one-dimensional densities of states. Finally, we applied the present\nmethod to Cu-Au and Pd-Rh alloys and confirmed that the present method\nsuccessfully describes the phase diagram with high validity and accuracy.\n", "  We experimentally generate two-dimensional Jones-Roberts solitons in a\nthree-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by imprinting a triangular\nphase pattern. By monitoring their dynamics we observe that this kind of\nsolitary waves are resistant to both dynamic (snaking) and thermodynamic\ninstabilities, that usually are known to strongly limit the lifetime of dark\nplane solitons in dimensions higher than one. We additionally find signatures\nof a possible dipole-like interaction between them. Our results confirm that\nJones-Roberts solitons are stable solutions of the non-linear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in higher dimensions and promote these excitations for applications\nbeyond matter wave physics, like energy and information transport in noisy and\ninhomogeneous environments.\n", "  We study the concept of entanglement distance between two quantum states\nwhich quantifies the amount of information shared between their reduced density\nmatrices (RDMs). Using analytical arguments combined with\ndensity-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED)\ncalculations, we show that for gapless systems the entanglement distance has\npower law dependence on the energy separation and subsystem size with\n$\\alpha_E$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ exponents, respectively. Using conformal field\ntheory (CFT) we find $\\alpha_E = 2$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell} = 4$ for Abelian\ntheories with $c=1$ such as free fermions. For non-Abelian CFTs $\\alpha_E = 0$\n, and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ is twice the conformal dimension of the thermal primary\nfields. For instance for $Z_3$ parafermion CFT $\\alpha_E = 1$ and\n$\\alpha_{\\ell} = 4/5$. For gapped 1+1D fermion systems, we show that the\nentanglement distance divides the low energy excitations into two branches with\ndifferent values of $\\alpha_E$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$. These two branches are\nrelated to momentum transfers near zero and $\\pi$. We also demonstrate that the\nentanglement distance reaches its maximum for degenerate states related through\nnonlocal operators such as Wilson loops. For example, degenerate ground-states\n(GSs) of 2+1 D topological states have maximum entanglement distance. On the\ncontrary, degenerate GSs related through confined anyon excitations such as\ngenons have minimum entanglement distance. Various implications of this concept\nfor quantum simulations are discussed. Finally, based on the ideas developed we\ndiscuss the computational complexity of DMRG algorithms that are capable of\nfinding all degenerate GSs.\n", "  We propose a method to produce pure single photons with an arbitrary designed\ntemporal shape in a heralded, lossless and scalable way. As the indispensable\nresource, the method uses pairs of time-energy entangled photons. To accomplish\nthe shaping, one photon of a pair undergoes temporal modulation according to\nthe desired shape. Subsequent frequency-resolving detection of the photon\nheralds its entangled counterpart in a pure quantum state with a temporal shape\nnon-locally affected by the modulation. We found conditions for the shape of\nthe heralded photon to reproduce the modulation function. The method can be\nimplemented with various sources of time-energy entangled photons. In\nparticular, using entangled photons from the parametric down-conversion the\nmethod enables generation of pure photons with tunable shape within\nunprecedentedly broad range of temporal durations - from tenths of femtoseconds\nto microseconds. Proposed shaping of single photons will push forward\nimplementation of scalable multidimensional quantum information protocols,\nefficient photon-matter coupling and quantum control at the level of single\nquanta.\n", "  In this paper we show that the frequencies of propagating electromagnetic\nwave (photon) in rotating dielectric medium obey Landau quantization. We show\nthat the degeneracy of right and left helicities of photons is broken on the\nlowest Landau level. In homogeneous space this level is shown to be helical,\ni.e. left and right helical photons counter-propagate. This leads to helical\nvortical effect for photons.\n", "  The flow of dense suspensions, glasses, and granular materials is heavily\ninfluenced by frictional interactions between constituent particles. However,\nneither hydrodynamics nor friction has successfully explained the full range of\nflow phenomena in concentrated suspensions. Particles with asperities represent\na case in point. Lubrication hydrodynamics fail to completely capture two key\nrheological properties - namely, that the viscosity increases drastically and\nthe first normal stress difference can switch signs as volume fraction\nincreases. Yet, simulations that account for interparticle friction are also\nunable to fully predict these properties. Furthermore, experiments show that\nrheological behavior can vary depending on particle roughness and\ndeformability. We seek to resolve these apparent contradictions by\nsystematically tuning the roughness of model colloids, investigating their\nviscosity and first normal stress differences under steady shear, and finally\ngenerating a rheological state diagram that demonstrates how surface roughness\ninfluences the transition between shear thickening and dilatancy. Our\nsimulations, which are in good agreement with the experiments, suggest that\nfriction between rough particles is significant. In addition, we find that\nroughness progressively lowers the critical conditions required for the onset\nof shear thickening and dilatancy. Our results thus provides a major\ncontribution in the field of suspension rheology with broad relevance to\ngranular and particulate materials. For instance, particle geometry can be\ntuned to increase the efficacy of materials that turn solid-like on the\napplication of stimuli. On the other hand, engineers who work with concentrated\nslurries can now use images of the constituent particles to estimate optimal\nflow processing conditions.\n", "  Quantum fluids of light are an emerging tool employed in quantum many-body\nphysics. Their amazing properties and versatility allow using them in a wide\nvariety of fields including gravitation, quantum information and simulation.\nHowever the implications of the quantum nature of light in the nonlinear\noptical propagation are still missing many features. We theoretically predict\nclassical spontaneous squeezing of a photon fluid in a nonlocal nonlinear\nmedium. By using the so called Gamow vectors, we show that the quadratures of a\ncoherent state get squeezed and that a maximal squeezing power exists. Our\nanalysis holds true for temporal and spatial optical propagation in highly\nnonlocal regime. These results open a new scenario in quantum photon fluids and\nmay lead to novel applications in fields like metrology and analogues of\nquantum gravity.\n", "  Understanding and probing phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems is an\nongoing challenge in physics. A particular instance are phase transitions that\noccur between a non-fluctuating absorbing phase, e.g., an extinct population,\nand one in which the relevant order parameter, such as the population density,\nassumes a finite value. Here we report the observation of signatures of such a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition in an open driven quantum system. In our\nexperiment rubidium atoms in a quasi one-dimensional cold disordered gas are\nlaser-excited to Rydberg states under so-called facilitation conditions. This\nconditional excitation process competes with spontaneous decay and leads to a\ncrossover between a stationary state with no excitations and one with a finite\nnumber of excitations. We relate the underlying physics to that of an absorbing\nstate phase transition in the presence of a field (i.e. off-resonant excitation\nprocesses) which slightly offsets the system from criticality. We observe a\ncharacteristic power-law scaling of the Rydberg excitation density as well as\nincreased fluctuations close to the transition point. Furthermore, we argue\nthat the observed transition relies on the presence of atomic motion which\nintroduces annealed disorder into the system and enables the formation of\nlong-ranged correlations. Our study paves the road for future investigations\ninto the largely unexplored physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions in\nopen many-body quantum systems.\n", "  We investigate numerically the Andreev spectrum of a multichannel mesoscopic\nquantum wire (N) with high spin-orbit interaction coupled to superconducting\nelectrodes (S), contrasting topological and non topological behaviors.\n  In the non topological case, modeled by a square lattice with Rashba\ninteractions, we find that as soon as the normal quantum wires can host several\nconduction channels, the spin degeneracy of Andreev levels is lifted by a phase\ndifference between the S reservoirs which breaks time reversal symmetry in zero\nZeeman field. The Andreev states remain degenerate at phases multiple of $\\pi$\nfor which time reversal symmetry is preserved, giving rise to level crossings\nwhich are not lifted by disorder. In contrast with the dc Josephson current,\nthe finite frequency admittance (susceptibility) is very sensitive to these\nlevel crossings and the lifting of their degeneracy by a small Zeeman field.\nMore interesting is the case of the hexagonal lattice with next nearest\nneighbor spin-orbit interactions which exhibit 1D topological helical edge\nstates \\cite{Kane2005}. The finite frequency admittance carries then a very\nspecific signature at low temperature of a protected Andreev level crossing at\n$\\pi$ and zero energy in the form of a sharp peak split by a Zeeman field.\n", "  The role of relativistic surface plasmons (SPs) in high order harmonic\nemission from laser-irradiated grating targets has been investigated by means\nof particle-in-cell simulations. SP excitation drives a strong enhancement of\nthe intensity of harmonics, particularly in the direction close to the surface\ntangent. The SP-driven enhancement overlaps with the angular separation of\nharmonics generated by the grating, which is beneficial for applications\nrequiring monochromatic XUV pulses.\n", "  Laboratory experiments indicate that direct growth of silicate grains via\nmutual collisions can only produce particles up to roughly millimeters in size.\nOn the other hand, recent simulations of the streaming instability have shown\nthat mm/cm-sized particles require an excessively high metallicity for dense\nfilaments to emerge. Using a numerical algorithm for stiff mutual drag force,\nwe perform simulations of small particles with significantly higher resolutions\nand longer simulation times than in previous investigations. We find that\nparticles of dimensionless stopping time $\\tau_\\mathrm{s} = 10^{-2}$ and\n$10^{-3}$ -- representing mm- and cm-sized particles interior of the water ice\nline -- concentrate themselves via the streaming instability at a solid\nabundance of a few percent. We thus revise a previously published critical\nsolid abundance curve for the regime of $\\tau_\\mathrm{s} \\ll 1$. The solid\ndensity in the concentrated regions reaches values higher than the Roche\ndensity, indicating that direct collapse of particles down to mm sizes into\nplanetesimals is possible. Our results hence bridge the gap in particle size\nbetween direct dust growth limited by bouncing and the streaming instability.\n", "  An analogy with real Clifford algebras on even-dimensional vector spaces\nsuggests to assign a couple of space and time dimensions modulo 8 to any\nalgebra (represented over a complex Hilbert space) containing two self-adjoint\ninvolutions and an anti-unitary operator with specific commutation relations.\n  It is shown that this assignment is compatible with the tensor product: the\nspace and time dimensions of the tensor product are the sums of the space and\ntime dimensions of its factors. This could provide an interpretation of the\npresence of such algebras in PT-symmetric Hamiltonians or the description of\ntopological matter.\n  This construction is used to build an indefinite (i.e. pseudo-Riemannian)\nversion of the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry, defined over Krein\nspaces instead of Hilbert spaces. Within this framework, we can express the\nLagrangian (both bosonic and fermionic) of a Lorentzian almost-commutative\nspectral triple. We exhibit a space of physical states that solves the\nfermion-doubling problem. The example of quantum electrodynamics is described.\n", "  We study 21cm and Ly$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ fluctuations, as well as\nH$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$, while distinguishing between Ly$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ emission\nof galactic, diffuse, and scattered intergalactic medium (IGM) origin.\nCross-correlation information about the state of the IGM is obtained, testing\nneutral versus ionized medium cases with different tracers in a seminumerical\nsimulation setup. In order to pave the way toward constraints on reionization\nhistory and modeling beyond power spectrum information, we explore parameter\ndependencies of the cross-power signal between 21$\\,$cm and\nLy$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$, which displays a characteristic morphology and a turnover\nfrom negative to positive correlation at scales of a couple Mpc$^{-1}$. In a\nproof of concept for the extraction of further information on the state of the\nIGM using different tracers, we demonstrate the use of the 21$\\,$cm and\nH$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ cross-correlation signal to determine the relative strength\nof galactic and IGM emission in Ly$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$. We conclude by showing the\ndetectability of the 21$\\,$cm and Ly$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ cross-correlation signal\nover more than one decade in scale at high signal-to-noise ratio for upcoming\nprobes like SKA and the proposed all-sky intensity mapping satellites SPHEREx\nand CDIM, while also including the Ly$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ damping tail and 21cm\nforeground avoidance in the modeling.\n", "  Within the framework of a realistic multi-band p-d-model, we derived an\neffective Hamiltonian to describe the exchange interaction effects near the\nspin crossover in magnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators under pressure. It is shown\nthat single-ion mechanism of spin crossover under change of the crystal field\ndoes not lead to a thermodynamic phase transition, however, at T = 0 a quantum\nphase transition appears. It has been found that the cooperativity leads to a\nmodification of the quantum phase transition to a first-order phase transition\nand the appearance of metastable states of the system. The pressure -\ntemperature phase diagram has been obtained to describe the magnetization and\nhigh-spin population near the spin crossover of the Motts dielectrics with\nd6-ions.\n", "  An efficient solver for the three dimensional free-space Poisson equation is\npresented. The underlying numerical method is based on finite Fourier series\napproximation. While the error of all involved approximations can be fully\ncontrolled, the overall computation error is driven by the convergence of the\nfinite Fourier series of the density. For smooth and fast-decaying densities\nthe proposed method will be spectral accurate. The method scales with\n$\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ operations, where $N$ is the total number of\ndiscretization points in the Cartesian grid. The majority of the computational\ncosts come from fast Fourier transforms (FFT), which makes it ideal for GPU\ncomputation. Several numerical computations on CPU and GPU validate the method\nand show efficiency and convergence behavior. Tests are performed using the\nVienna Scientific Cluster 3 (VSC3). A free MATLAB implementation for CPU and\nGPU is provided to the interested community.\n", "  We investigate a new empirical fitting method for the optical light curves of\nType Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) that is able to estimate the first-light time of\nSNe~Ia, even when they are not discovered extremely early. With an improved\nability to estimate the time of first light for SNe Ia, we compute the rise\ntimes for a sample of 56 well-observed SNe~Ia. We find rise times ranging from\n10.5 to 20.5 days, with a mean of 16.0 days, and confirm that the rise time is\ngenerally correlated with the decline rate $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$, but with large\nscatter. The rise time could be an additional parameter to help classify SN~Ia\nsubtypes.\n", "  We assess the utility of an optimization-based data assimilation (D.A.)\ntechnique for treating the problem of nonlinear neutrino flavor transformation\nin core collapse supernovae. D.A. uses measurements obtained from a physical\nsystem to estimate the state variable evolution and parameter values of the\nassociated model. Formulated as an optimization procedure, D.A. can offer an\nintegration-blind approach to predicting model evolution, which offers an\nadvantage for models that thwart solution via traditional numerical integration\ntechniques. Further, D.A. performs most optimally for models whose equations of\nmotion are nonlinearly coupled. In this exploratory work, we consider a simple\nsteady-state model with two mono-energetic neutrino beams coherently\ninteracting with each other and a background medium. As this model can be\nsolved via numerical integration, we have an independent consistency check for\nD.A. solutions. We find that the procedure can capture key features of flavor\nevolution over the entire trajectory, even given measurements of neutrino\nflavor only at the endpoint, and with an assumed known initial flavor\ndistribution. Further, the procedure permits an examination of the sensitivity\nof flavor evolution to estimates of unknown model parameters, locates\ndegeneracies in parameter space, and can identify the specific measurements\nrequired to break those degeneracies.\n", "  Photo-z error is one of the major sources of systematics degrading the\naccuracy of weak lensing cosmological inferences. Zhang et al. (2010) proposed\na self-calibration method combining galaxy-galaxy correlations and galaxy-shear\ncorrelations between different photo-z bins. Fisher matrix analysis shows that\nit can determine the rate of photo-z outliers at a level of 0.01-1% merely\nusing photometric data and do not rely on any prior knowledge. In this paper,\nwe develop a new algorithm to implement this method by solving a constrained\nnonlinear optimization problem arising in the self-calibration process. Based\non the techniques of fixed-point iteration and non-negative matrix\nfactorization, the proposed algorithm can efficiently and robustly reconstruct\nthe scattering probabilities between the true-z and photo-z bins. The algorithm\nhas been tested extensively by applying it to mock data from simulated stage IV\nweak lensing projects. We find that the algorithm provides a successful\nrecovery of the scatter rates at the level of 0.01-1%, and the true mean\nredshifts of photo-z bins at the level of 0.001, which may satisfy the\nrequirements in future lensing surveys.\n", "  A three-dimensional Riccati differential equation of complex\nquaternion-valued functions is studied. Many properties similar to those of the\nordinary differential Riccati equation such that linearization and Picard\ntheorem are obtained. Lie point symmetries of the quaternionic Riccati equation\nare calculated as well as the form of the associated three-dimensional\npotential of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Using symmetry reductions and\nrelations between the three-dimensional Riccati and the Schr\\\"odinger equation,\nexamples are given to obtain solutions of both equations.\n", "  We study the electrical conductivity in a nodal-line semimetal with charged\nimpurities. The screening of the Coulomb potential in this system is\nqualitatively different from what is found in conventional metals or\nsemiconductors, with the screened potential $\\phi$ decaying as $\\phi \\propto\n1/r^2$ over a wide interval of distances $r$. This unusual screening gives rise\nto a rich variety of conduction regimes as a function of temperature, doping\nlevel and impurity concentration. In particular, nodal-line semimetals exhibit\na diverging mobility $\\propto 1/|\\mu|$ in the limit of vanishing chemical\npotential $\\mu$, a linearly-increasing dependence of the conductivity on\ntemperature, $\\sigma \\propto T$, and a large weak-localization correction with\na strongly anisotropic dependence on magnetic field.\n", "  We present a generic framework for the emergence of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ntoric-code and the double-semion topological order in a wide class of hardcore\nBose-Hubbard-type models governed by density-density interaction and in the\nstrong-interaction regime. We fix fractional filling factor and study under\nwhich conditions the density-density interaction gives rise to topological\ndegeneracy. We further specify which dynamics determines the toric-code and the\ndouble-semion topological order. Our results indicate that the specifics of the\ndensity-density interaction determine the long-range entanglement of the model\nwhich possesses \"restricted patterns\" of the long-range entanglement realized\nin corresponding string-net models with the same topological order.\n", "  In this article we report on a preliminary study, {\\it via} Holography, of\ninfrared fixed points in a putative strongly coupled SU$(N_c)$ gauge theory,\nwith $N_f$ fundamental matter, in the presence of additional fields in the\nfundamental sector, e.g. density or a magnetic field. In an inherently {\\it\neffective} or a {\\it bottom up} approach, we work with a simple system:\nEinstein-gravity with a negative cosmological constant, coupled to a\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) matter. We obtain a class of exact solutions, dual to\ncandidate grounds states in the infrared (IR), with a scaling ansatz for\nvarious fields. These solutions are of two kinds: AdS$_m \\times {\\mathbb\nR}^n$--type, and AdS$_m \\times$EAdS$_n$--type, where $m$ and $n$ are suitable\nintegers. Both these classes of solutions are {\\it non-perturbative} in\nback-reaction. The AdS$_m \\times$EAdS$_n$--type contains examples of Bianchi\ntype-V solutions. We also construct explicit numerical flows from an AdS$_5$\nultraviolet to both an AdS$_2$ and an AdS$_3$ IR.\n", "  We provide a cohomological framework for contextuality of quantum mechanics\nthat is suited to describing contextuality as a resource in measurement-based\nquantum computation. This framework applies to the parity proofs first\ndiscussed by Mermin, as well as a different type of contextuality proofs based\non symmetry transformations. The topological arguments presented can be used in\nthe state-dependent and the state-independent case.\n", "  We study optical forces acting upon semiconductor quantum dots and the force\ndriven motion of the dots in a colloid. In the spectral range of exciton\ntransitions in uantum dots, when the photon energy is close to the exciton\nenergy, the polarizability of the dots is drastically increased. It leads to a\nresonant increase of both the gradient and the scattering contributions to the\noptical force, which enables the efficient manipulation with the dots. We\nreveal that the optical grating of the colloid leads to the formation of a\nfluid photonic crystal with spatially periodic circulating fluxes and density\nof the dots. Pronounced resonant dielectric response of semiconductor quantum\ndots enables a separation of the quantum dots with different exciton\nfrequencies.\n", "  Despite the obvious advantage of simple life forms capable of fast\nreplication, different levels of cognitive complexity have been achieved by\nliving systems in terms of their potential to cope with environmental\nuncertainty. Against the inevitable cost associated to detecting environmental\ncues and responding to them in adaptive ways, we conjecture that the potential\nfor predicting the environment can overcome the expenses associated to\nmaintaining costly, complex structures. We present a minimal formal model\ngrounded in information theory and selection, in which successive generations\nof agents are mapped into transmitters and receivers of a coded message. Our\nagents are guessing machines and their capacity to deal with environments of\ndifferent complexity defines the conditions to sustain more complex agents.\n", "  We introduce a matrix-product state based method to efficiently obtain\ndynamical response functions for two-dimensional microscopic Hamiltonians,\nwhich we apply to different phases of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. We find\nsignificant broad high energy features beyond spin-wave theory even in the\nordered phases proximate to spin liquids. This includes the phase with zig-zag\norder of the type observed in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where we find high energy\nfeatures like those seen in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Our\nresults provide an example of a natural path for proximate spin liquid features\nto arise at high energies above a conventionally ordered state, as the diffuse\nremnants of spin-wave bands intersect to yield a broad peak at the Brillouin\nzone center.\n", "  We study two-magnon excitations in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)\nat the transition-metal $K$-edge. Instead of working with effective Heisenberg\nspin models, we work with a Hubbard-type model ($d$-$p$ model) for a typical\ninsulating cuprate La$_2$CuO$_4$. For the antiferromagnetic ground state within\nthe spin-density-wave (SDW) mean-field formalism, we calculate the dynamical\ncorrelation function within the random-phase approximation (RPA), and then\nobtain two-magnon excitation spectra by calculating the convolution of it.\nCoupling between the $K$-shell hole and the magnons in the intermediate state\nis calculated by means of diagrammatic perturbation expansion in the Coulomb\ninteraction. Calculated momentum dependence of RIXS spectra agrees well with\nthat of experiments. A notable difference from previous calculations based on\nthe Heisenberg spin models is that RIXS spectra have a large two-magnon weight\nnear the zone center, which may be confirmed by further careful high-resolution\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the heat capacity of a static system of self-gravitating radiations\nanalytically in the context of general relativity. To avoid the complexity due\nto a conical singularity at the center, we excise the central part and replace\nit with a regular spherically symmetric distribution of matters of which\nspecifications we are not interested in. We assume that the mass inside the\ninner boundary and the locations of the inner and the outer boundaries are\ngiven. Then, we derive a formula relating the variations of physical parameters\nat the outer boundary with those at the inner boundary. Because there is only\none free variation at the inner boundary, the variations at the outer boundary\nare related, which determines the heat capacity. To get an analytic form for\nthe heat capacity, we use the thermodynamic identity $\\delta S_{\\rm rad} =\n\\beta \\delta M_{\\rm rad}$ additionally, which is derived from the variational\nrelation of the entropy formula with the restriction that the mass inside the\ninner boundary does not change. Even if the radius of the inner boundary of the\nshell goes to zero, in the presence of a central conical singularity, the heat\ncapacity does not go to the form of the regular sphere. An interesting\ndiscovery is that another legitimate temperature can be defined at the inner\nboundary which is different from the asymptotic one $\\beta^{-1}$.\n", "  Ensembles of quantum mechanical spins offer a promising platform for quantum\nmemories, but proper functionality requires accurate control of unavoidable\nsystem imperfections. We present an efficient control scheme for a spin\nensemble strongly coupled to a single-mode cavity based on a set of Volterra\nequations relying solely on weak classical control pulses. The viability of our\napproach is demonstrated in terms of explicit storage and readout sequences\nthat will serve as a starting point towards the realization of more demanding\nfull quantum mechanical optimal control schemes.\n", "  In the present work, we provide results from specific heat, magnetic\nsusceptibility, dielectric constant, ac conductivity, and electrical\npolarization measurements performed on the lacunar spinel GaV4Se8. With\ndecreasing temperature, we observe a transition from the paraelectric and\nparamagnetic cubic state into a polar, probably ferroelectric state at 42 K\nfollowed by magnetic ordering at 18 K. The polar transition is likely driven by\nthe Jahn-Teller effect due to the degeneracy of the V4 cluster orbitals. The\nexcess polarization arising in the magnetic phase indicates considerable\nmagnetoelectric coupling. Overall, the behavior of GaV4Se8 in many respects is\nsimilar to that of the skyrmion host GaV4S8, exhibiting a complex interplay of\norbital, spin, lattice, and polar degrees of freedom. However, its dielectric\nbehavior at the polar transition markedly differs from that of the Jahn-Teller\ndriven ferroelectric GeV4S8, which can be ascribed to the dissimilar electronic\nstructure of the Ge compound.\n", "  We give experimental grounding for the remarkable observation made by\nFuruberg et al. in Ref. [furuberg1988] of an unusual dynamic scaling for the\npair correlation function $N(r,t)$ during the slow drainage of a porous medium.\nThe authors of that paper have used an invasion percolation algorithm to show\nnumerically that the probability of invasion of a pore at a distance $r$ away\nand after a time $t$ from the invasion of another pore, scales as\n$N(r,t)\\propto r^{-1}f\\left(r^{D}/t\\right)$, where $D$ is the fractal dimension\nof the invading cluster and the function $f(u)\\propto u^{1.4}$, for $u \\ll 1$\nand $f(u)\\propto u^{-0.6}$, for $u \\gg 1$. Our experimental setup allows us to\nhave full access to the spatiotemporal evolution of the invasion, which was\nused to directly verify this scaling. Additionally, we have connected two\nimportant theoretical contributions from the literature to explain the\nfunctional dependency of $N(r,t)$ and the scaling exponent for the short-time\nregime ($t \\ll r^{D}$). A new theoretical argument was developed to explain the\nlong-time regime exponent ($t \\gg r^{D}$).\n", "  We present measurements of bulk properties of the matter produced in Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV using identified\nhadrons ($\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, $p$ and $\\bar{p}$) from the STAR experiment in the\nBeam Energy Scan (BES) Program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).\nMidrapidity ($|y|<$0.1) results for multiplicity densities $dN/dy$, average\ntransverse momenta $\\langle p_T \\rangle$ and particle ratios are presented. The\nchemical and kinetic freeze-out dynamics at these energies are discussed and\npresented as a function of collision centrality and energy. These results\nconstitute the systematic measurements of bulk properties of matter formed in\nheavy-ion collisions over a broad range of energy (or baryon chemical\npotential) at RHIC.\n", "  A result of great theoretical and experimental interest, Jarzynski equality\npredicts a free energy change $\\Delta F$ of a system at inverse temperature\n$\\beta$ from an ensemble average of non-equilibrium exponential work, i.e.,\n$\\langle e^{-\\beta W}\\rangle =e^{-\\beta\\Delta F}$. The number of experimental\nwork values needed to reach a given accuracy of $\\Delta F$ is determined by the\nvariance of $e^{-\\beta W}$, denoted ${\\rm var}(e^{-\\beta W})$. We discover in\nthis work that ${\\rm var}(e^{-\\beta W})$ in both harmonic and an-harmonic\nHamiltonian systems can systematically diverge in non-adiabatic work protocols,\neven when the adiabatic protocols do not suffer from such divergence. This\ndivergence may be regarded as a type of dynamically induced phase transition in\nwork fluctuations. For a quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent\ntrapping frequency as a working example, any non-adiabatic work protocol is\nfound to yield a diverging ${\\rm var}(e^{-\\beta W})$ at sufficiently low\ntemperatures, markedly different from the classical behavior. The divergence of\n${\\rm var}(e^{-\\beta W})$ indicates the too-far-from-equilibrium nature of a\nnon-adiabatic work protocol and makes it compulsory to apply designed control\nfields to suppress the quantum work fluctuations in order to test Jarzynski\nequality.\n", "  We theoretically explore the crossover from three dimensions (3D) to two (2D)\nin a strongly interacting atomic Fermi superfluid through confining the\ntransverse spatial dimension. Using the gaussian pair fluctuation theory, we\ndetermine the zero-temperature equation of state and Landau critical velocity\nas functions of the spatial extent of the transverse dimension and interaction\nstrength. In the presence of strong interactions, we map out a dimensional\ncrossover diagram from the location of maximum critical velocity, which\nexhibits distinct dependence on the transverse dimension from 2D to quasi-2D,\nand to 3D. We calculate the dynamic structure factor to characterize the\nlow-energy excitations of the system and propose that the intermediate quasi-2D\nregime can be experimentally probed using Bragg spectroscopy.\n", "  We present an optical technique based on ultrafast photoacoustics to\nprecisely determine the local temperature distribution profile in liquid\nsamples in contact with a laser heated optical transducer. This ultrafast\npump-probe experiment uses time-domain Brillouin scattering (TDBS) to locally\ndetermine the light scattering frequency shift. As the temperature influences\nthe Brillouin scattering frequency, the TDBS signal probes the local\nlaser-induced temperature distribution in the liquid. We demonstrate the\nrelevance and the sensitivity of this technique for the measurement of the\nabsolute laser-induced temperature gradient of a glass forming liquid\nprototype, glycerol, at different laser pump powers - i.e. different steady\nstate background temperatures. Complementarily, our experiments illustrate how\nthis TDBS technique can be applied to measure thermal diffusion in complex\nmultilayer systems in contact to a surrounding liquid.\n", "  The low energy optical conductivity of conventional superconductors is\nusually well described by Mattis-Bardeen (MB) theory which predicts the onset\nof absorption above an energy corresponding to twice the superconducing (SC)\ngap parameter Delta. Recent experiments on strongly disordered superconductors\nhave challenged the application of the MB formulas due to the occurrence of\nadditional spectral weight at low energies below 2Delta. Here we identify three\ncrucial items which have to be included in the analysis of optical-conductivity\ndata for these systems: (a) the correct identification of the optical threshold\nin the Mattis-Bardeen theory, and its relation with the gap value extracted\nfrom the measured density of states, (b) the gauge-invariant evaluation of the\ncurrent-current response function, needed to account for the optical absorption\nby SC collective modes, and (c) the inclusion into the MB formula of the energy\ndependence of the density of states present already above Tc. By computing the\noptical conductvity in the disordered attractive Hubbard model we analyze the\nrelevance of all these items, and we provide a compelling scheme for the\nanalysis and interpretation of the optical data in real materials.\n", "  We have studied the impact of low-frequency magnetic flux noise upon\nsuperconducting transmon qubits with various levels of tunability. We find that\nqubits with weaker tunability exhibit dephasing that is less sensitive to flux\nnoise. This insight was used to fabricate qubits where dephasing due to flux\nnoise was suppressed below other dephasing sources, leading to flux-independent\ndephasing times T2* ~ 15 us over a tunable range of ~340 MHz. Such tunable\nqubits have the potential to create high-fidelity, fault-tolerant qubit gates\nand fundamentally improve scalability for a quantum processor.\n", "  In a strong magnetic field, ultra-relativistic electrons or positrons undergo\nspin flip transitions as they radiate, preferentially spin polarizing in one\ndirection -- the Sokolov-Ternov effect. Here we show that this effect could\noccur very rapidly (in less than 10 fs) in high intensity ($I\\gtrsim10^{23}$\nW/cm$^{2}$) laser-matter interactions, resulting in a high degree of electron\nspin polarization (70%-90%).\n", "  We present a detailed synchrotron x-ray scattering study of the\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) order in simple tetragonal HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$\n(Hg1201). Resonant soft x-ray scattering measurements reveal that short-range\norder appears at a temperature that is distinctly lower than the pseudogap\ntemperature and in excellent agreement with a prior transient reflectivity\nresult. Despite considerable structural differences between Hg1201 and\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\\delta}$, the CDW correlations exhibit similar doping\ndependencies, and we demonstrate a universal relationship between the CDW wave\nvector and the size of the reconstructed Fermi pocket observed in quantum\noscillation experiments. The CDW correlations in Hg1201 vanish already below\noptimal doping, once the correlation length is comparable to the CDW modulation\nperiod, and they appear to be limited by the disorder potential from unit cells\nhosting two interstitial oxygen atoms. A complementary hard x-ray diffraction\nmeasurement, performed on an underdoped Hg1201 sample in magnetic fields along\nthe crystallographic $c$ axis of up to 16 T, provides information about the\nform factor of the CDW order. As expected from the single-CuO$_2$-layer\nstructure of Hg1201, the CDW correlations vanish at half-integer values of $L$\nand appear to be peaked at integer $L$. We conclude that the atomic\ndisplacements associated with the short-range CDW order are mainly planar,\nwithin the CuO$_2$ layers.\n", "  In this tutorial it is explained the procedure to analyze an optical\nemission-line spectrum produced by a nebula ionized by massive star formation.\nParticularly, it is described the methodology used to derive physical\nproperties, such as electron density and temperature, and the ionic abundances\nof the most representative elements whose emission lines are present in the\noptical spectrum. The tutorial is focused on the direct method,based on the\nmeasurement of the electron temperature to derive the abundances, given that\nthe ionization and thermal equilibrium of the ionized gas is dominated by the\nmetallicity. The ionization correction factors used to obtain total abundances\nfrom the abundances of some of their ions are also given. Finally, some\nstrong-line methods to derive abundances are described. These are used when no\nestimation of the temperature can be derived, but that can be consistent with\nthe direct method if they are calibrated.\n", "  In the past years several authors studied the abundance of satellites around\ngalaxies in order to better estimate the halo masses of host galaxies. To\ninvestigate this connection, we analyze galaxies with\n$M_\\mathrm{star}\\geq\\,10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$ from the hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulation Magneticum. We find that the satellite fraction of centrals is\nindependent of their morphology. With the exception of very massive galaxies at\nlow redshift, our results do not support the assumption that the dark matter\n(DM) haloes of spheroidal galaxies are significantly more massive than those of\ndisc galaxies at fixed $M_\\mathrm{star}$. We show that the\ndensity-morphology-relation starts to build up at $z\\sim2$ and is independent\nof the star-formation properties of central galaxies. We conclude that\nenvironmental quenching is more important for satellites than for centrals. Our\nsimulations indicate that conformity is already in place at $z=2$, where\nformation redshift and current star-formation rate (SFR) of central and\nsatellite galaxies correlate. Centrals with low SFRs have formed earlier (at\nfixed $M_\\mathrm{star}$) while centrals with high SFR formed later, with\ntypical formation redshifts well in agreement with observations. However, we\nconfirm the recent observations that the apparent number of satellites of\nspheroidal galaxies is significantly larger than for disc galaxies. This\ndifference completely originates from the inclusion of companion galaxies, i.e.\ngalaxies that do not sit in the potential minimum of a DM halo. Thus, due to\nthe density-morphological-relation the number of satellites is not a good\ntracer for the halo mass, unless samples are restricted to the central galaxies\nof DM haloes.\n", "  We study a graphene Hall probe located on top of a magnetic surface as a\ndetector of skyrmions, using as working principle the anomalous Hall effect\nproduced by the exchange interaction of the graphene electrons with the\nnon-coplanar magnetization of the skyrmion. We study the magnitude of the\neffect as a function of the exchange interaction, skyrmion size and device\ndimensions. Our calculations for multiterminal graphene nanodevices, working in\nthe ballistic regime, indicate that for realistic exchange interactions a\nsingle skyrmion would give Hall voltages well within reach of the experimental\nstate of the art. The proposed device could act as an electrical transducer\nthat marks the presence of a single skyrmion in a nanoscale region, paving the\nway towards the integration of skyrmion-based spintronics and graphene\nelectronics.\n", "  Microscopy is the workhorse of the physical and life sciences, producing\ncrisp images of everything from atoms to cells well beyond the capabilities of\nthe human eye. However, the analysis of these images is frequently little\nbetter than automated manual marking. Here, we revolutionize the analysis of\nmicroscopy images, extracting all the information theoretically contained in a\ncomplex microscope image. Using a generic, methodological approach, we extract\nthe information by fitting experimental images with a detailed optical model of\nthe microscope, a method we call Parameter Extraction from Reconstructing\nImages (PERI). As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this approach with a\nconfocal image of colloidal spheres, improving measurements of particle\npositions and radii by 100x over current methods and attaining the maximum\npossible accuracy. With this unprecedented resolution, we measure\nnanometer-scale colloidal interactions in dense suspensions solely with light\nmicroscopy, a previously impossible feat. Our approach is generic and\napplicable to imaging methods from brightfield to electron microscopy, where we\nexpect accuracies of 1 nm and 0.1 pm, respectively.\n", "  We examine the question to what extent prospective detection of dark matter\nby direct and indirect- detection experiments could shed light on what fraction\nof dark matter was generated thermally via the freeze-out process in the early\nUniverse. By simulating putative signals that could be seen in the near future\nand using them to reconstruct WIMP dark matter properties, we show that, in a\nmodel- independent approach this could only be achieved in a thin sliver of the\nparameter space. However, with additional theoretical input the hypothesis\nabout the thermal freeze-out as the dominant mechanism for generating dark\nmatter can potentially be verified. We illustrate this with two examples: an\neffective field theory of dark matter with a vector messenger and a higgsino or\nwino dark matter within the MSSM.\n", "  We propose a setup for the experimental realization of unexpected and\nanisotropic $0$-$\\pi$ transitions of the Josephson current, in a junction whose\nlink is made of irradiated Weyl semi-metal (WSM), due to the presence of chiral\nnodes. We show using a Green's function technique that the Josephson current\nthrough a time-reversal symmetric WSM has anisotropic periodic oscillations as\na function of $k_0L$, where $k_0$ is the (relevant) separation of the chiral\nnodes and $L$ is the length of the sample. This is unexpected, for\ntime-reversal symmetric systems, although it has been shown earlier for\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking WSMs. We then show that the effective value of\n$k_0$ can be tuned with precision by irradiating the sample with photons\nresulting in $0$-$\\pi$ transitions of the critical current. Finally, we discuss\nthe robustness of our setup.\n", "  Understanding the influence of structure of dispersal network on the species\npersistence and modeling a much realistic species dispersal in nature are two\ncentral issues in spatial ecology. A realistic dispersal structure which favors\nthe persistence of interacting ecological systems has been studied in [Holland\n\\& Hastings, Nature, 456:792--795 (2008)], where it is shown that a\nrandomization of the structure of dispersal network in a metapopulation model\nof prey and predator increases the species persistence via clustering,\nprolonged transient dynamics, and amplitudes of population fluctuations. In\nthis paper, by contrast, we show that a deterministic network topology in a\nmetapopulation can also favor asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics if\nspecies dispersal obeys a long-range interaction governed by a\ndistance-dependent power-law. To explore the effects of power-law coupling, we\ntake a realistic ecological model, namely the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in\neach patch (node) of the network of oscillators, and show that the coupled\nsystem is driven from synchrony to asynchrony with an increase in the power-law\nexponent. Moreover, to understand the relationship between species persistence\nand variations in power-law exponent, we compute correlation coefficient to\ncharacterize cluster formation, synchrony order parameter and median predator\namplitude. We further show that smaller metapopulations with less number of\npatches are more vulnerable to extinction as compared to larger metapopulations\nwith higher number of patches. We believe that the present work improves our\nunderstanding of the interconnection between the random network and\ndeterministic network in theoretical ecology.\n", "  Integrable $\\sigma$-models, such as the principal chiral model,\n${\\mathbb{Z}}_T$-coset models for $T \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}_{\\geq 2}$ and their\nvarious integrable deformations, are examples of non-ultralocal integrable\nfield theories described by (cyclotomic) $r/s$-systems with twist function. In\nthis general setting, and when the Lie algebra ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ underlying the\n$r/s$-system is of classical type, we construct an infinite algebra of local\nconserved charges in involution, extending the approach of Evans, Hassan,\nMacKay and Mountain developed for the principal chiral model and symmetric\nspace $\\sigma$-model. In the present context, the local charges are attached to\ncertain `regular' zeros of the twist function and have increasing degrees\nrelated to the exponents of the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra\n$\\widehat{{\\mathfrak{g}}}$ associated with ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. The Hamiltonian\nflows of these charges are shown to generate an infinite hierarchy of\ncompatible integrable equations.\n", "  The dislocation-mediated quantum melting of solids into quantum liquid\ncrystals is extended from two to three spatial dimensions, using a\ngeneralization of boson-vortex or Abelian-Higgs duality. Dislocations are now\nBurgers-vector-valued strings that trace out worldsheets in spacetime while the\nphonons of the solid dualize into two-form (Kalb-Ramond) gauge fields. We\npropose an effective dual Higgs potential that allows for restoring\ntranslational symmetry in either one, two or three directions, leading to the\nquantum analogues of columnar, smectic or nematic liquid crystals. In these\nphases, transverse phonons turn into gapped, propagating modes while\ncompressional stress remains massless. Rotational Goldstone modes emerge\nwhenever translational symmetry is restored. We also consider electrically\ncharged matter, and find amongst others that as a hard principle only two out\nof the possible three rotational Goldstone modes are observable using\nelectromagnetic means.\n", "  We investigate the existence of topological phases in a dense two-dimensional\natomic lattice gas. The coupling of the atoms to the radiation field gives rise\nto dissipation and a non-trivial coherent long-range exchange interaction whose\nform goes beyond a simple power-law. The far-field terms of the potential --\nwhich are particularly relevant for atomic separations comparable to the atomic\ntransition wavelength -- can give rise to energy spectra with one-sided\ndivergences in the Brillouin zone. The long-ranged character of the\ninteractions has another important consequence: it can break of the standard\nbulk-boundary relation in topological insulators. We show that topological\nproperties such as the transport of an excitation along the edge of the lattice\nare robust with respect to the presence of lattice defects and dissipation. The\nlatter is of particular relevance as dissipation and coherent interactions are\ninevitably connected in our setting.\n", "  We study several aspects of the recently introduced fixed-phase spin-orbit\ndiffusion Monte Carlo (FPSODMC) method, in particular, its relation to the\nfixed-node method and its potential use as a general approach for electronic\nstructure calculations. We illustrate constructions of spinor-based wave\nfunctions with the full space-spin symmetry without assigning up or down spin\nlabels to particular electrons, effectively \"complexifying\" even ordinary\nreal-valued wave functions. Interestingly, with proper choice of the simulation\nparameters and spin variables, such fixed-phase calculations enable one to\nreach also the fixed-node limit. The fixed-phase solution provides a\nstraightforward interpretation as the lowest bosonic state in a given effective\npotential generated by the many-body approximate phase. In addition, the\ndivergences present at real wave function nodes are smoothed out to lower\ndimensionality, decreasing thus the variation of sampled quantities and making\nthe sampling also more straightforward. We illustrate some of these properties\non calculations of selected first-row systems that recover the fixed-node\nresults with quantitatively similar levels of the corresponding biases. At the\nsame time, the fixed-phase approach opens new possibilities for more general\ntrial wave functions with further opportunities for increasing accuracy in\npractical calculations.\n", "  Recent versions of the observed cosmic star-formation history (SFH) have\nresolved an inconsistency with the stellar mass density history. We show that\nthe revised SFH also scales up the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia), as determined from the observed volumetric SN Ia rate\nhistory, aligning it with other field-galaxy SN Ia DTD measurements. The\nrevised-SFH-based DTD has a $t^{-1.1 \\pm 0.1}$ form and a\nHubble-time-integrated production efficiency of $N/M_\\star=1.3\\pm0.1$ SNe Ia\nper $1000~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ of formed stellar mass. Using these revised histories\nand updated empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we re-derive the\ncosmic iron accumulation history. Core-collapse SNe and SNe Ia have contributed\nabout equally to the total mass of iron in the Universe today. We find the\ntrack of the average cosmic gas element in the [$\\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\nabundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the observed main locus\nof Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky Way (MW) SFH similar in\nform to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple MW SFH that makes the track\nclosely match this stellar locus. Galaxy clusters appear to have a\nhigher-normalization DTD. This cluster DTD, combined with a short-burst MW SFH\npeaked at $z=3$, produces a track that matches remarkably well the observed\n\"high-$\\alpha$\" locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk population\nhas had a galaxy-cluster-like formation mode. Thus, a simple two-component SFH,\ncombined with empirical DTDs and SN iron yields, suffices to closely reproduce\nthe MW's stellar abundance patterns.\n", "  Cosmologies including strongly Coupled (SC) Dark Energy (DE) and Warm dark\nmatter (SCDEW) are based on a conformally invariant (CI) attractor solution\nmodifying the early radiative expansion. Then, aside of radiation, a kinetic\nfield $\\Phi$ and a DM component account for a stationary fraction, $\\sim 1\\,\n\\%$, of the total energy. Most SCDEW predictions are hardly distinguishable\nfrom LCDM, while SCDEW alleviates quite a few LCDM conceptual problems, as well\nas its difficulties to meet data below the average galaxy scale. The CI\nexpansion begins at the inflation end, when $\\Phi$ (future DE) possibly plays a\nrole in reheating, and ends at the Higgs' scale. Afterwards, a number of viable\noptions is open, allowing for the transition from the CI expansion to the\npresent Universe. In this paper: (i) We show how the attractor is recovered\nwhen the spin degrees of freedom decreases. (ii) We perform a detailed\ncomparison of CMB anisotropy and polarization spectra for SCDEW and LCDM,\nincluding tensor components, finding negligible discrepancies. (iii) Linear\nspectra exhibit a greater parameter dependence at large $k$'s, but are still\nconsistent with data for suitable parameter choices. (iv) We also compare\nprevious simulation results with fresh data on galaxy concentration. Finally,\n(v) we outline numerical difficulties at high $k$. This motivates a second\nrelated paper, where such problems are treated in a quantitative way.\n", "  Constraining the Dark Energy (DE) equation of state, w, is one of the primary\nscience goals of ongoing and future cosmological surveys. In practice, with\nimperfect data and incomplete redshift coverage, this requires making\nassumptions about the evolution of w with redshift z. These assumptions can be\nmanifested in a choice of a specific parametric form, which can potentially\nbias the outcome, or else one can reconstruct w(z) non-parametrically, by\nspecifying a prior covariance matrix that correlates values of w at different\nredshifts. In this work, we derive the theoretical prior covariance for the\neffective DE equation of state predicted by general scalar-tensor theories with\nsecond order equations of motion (Horndeski theories). This is achieved by\ngenerating a large ensemble of possible scalar-tensor theories using a Monte\nCarlo methodology, including the application of physical viability conditions.\nWe also separately consider the special sub-case of the minimally coupled\nscalar field, or quintessence. The prior shows a preference for tracking\nbehaviors in the most general case. Given the covariance matrix, theoretical\npriors on parameters of any specific parametrization of w(z) can also be\nreadily derived by projection.\n", "  The dynamics of a dense binary mixture of soft dumbbells, each subject to an\nactive propulsion force and thermal fluctuations, shows a sudden arrest, first\nto a translational then to a rotational glass, as one reduces temperature $T$\nor the self-propulsion force $f$. Is the temperature-induced glass different\nfrom the activity-induced glass? To address this question, we monitor the\ndynamics along an iso-relaxation-time contour in the $(T-f)$ plane. We find\ndramatic differences both in the fragility and in the nature of dynamical\nheterogeneity which characterise the onset of glass formation - the\nactivity-induced glass exhibits large swirls or vortices, whose scale is set by\nactivity, and appears to diverge as one approaches the glass transition. This\nlarge collective swirling movement should have implications for collective cell\nmigration in epithelial layers.\n", "  The understanding of very energy hadron cross sections in terms of a 'black\ndisc' with an 'edge' is reviewed. The slow approach to 'Asymptopia' is\nexplained by the 'Edge'. The disproportion of length or mass scales involved is\nprobably due to the small pion massa.\n", "  We study an ensemble of strongly coupled electrons under continuous microwave\nirradiation interacting with a dissipative environment, a problem of relevance\nto the creation of highly polarized non-equilibrium states in nuclear magnetic\nresonance. We analyse the stationary states of the dynamics, described within a\nLindblad master equation framework, at the mean-field approximation level. This\napproach allows us to identify steady state phase transitions between phases of\nhigh and low polarization controlled by the distribution of electronic\ninteractions. We compare the mean-field predictions to numerically exact\nsimulations of small systems and find good agreement. Our study highlights the\npossibility of observing collective phenomena, such as metastable states, phase\ntransitions and critical behaviour in appropriately designed paramagnetic\nsystems. These phenomena occur in a low-temperature regime which is not\ntheoretically tractable by conventional methods, e.g., the spin-temperature\napproach.\n", "  Modern wide-field, optical time-domain surveys must solve a basic\noptimization problem: maximize the number of transient discoveries or minimize\nthe follow-up needed for the new discoveries. Here, we describe the Color Me\nIntrigued experiment, the first from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory\n(iPTF) to search for transients simultaneously in the $g_\\mathrm{PTF}$- and\n$R_\\mathrm{PTF}$-bands. During the course of this experiment we discovered\niPTF$\\,$16fnm, a new member of the 02cx-like subclass of type Ia supernovae\n(SNe). iPTF$\\,$16fnm peaked at $M_{g_\\mathrm{PTF}} = -15.09 \\pm 0.17 \\;\n\\mathrm{mag}$, making it the second least-luminous known type Ia SN. iPTF 16fnm\nexhibits all the hallmarks of the 02cx-like class: (i) low luminosity at peak,\n(ii) low ejecta velocities, and (iii) a non-nebular spectra several months\nafter peak. Spectroscopically, iPTF$\\,$16fnm exhibits a striking resemblence to\n2 other low-luminosity 02cx-like SNe: SNe 2007qd and 2010ae. iPTF$\\,$16fnm and\nSN 2005hk decline at nearly the same rate, despite a 3 mag difference in\nbrightness at peak. When considering the full subclass of 02cx-like SNe, we do\nnot find evidence for a tight correlation between peak luminosity and decline\nrate in either the $g'$ or $r'$ band. We further examine the $g' - r'$\nevolution of 02cx-like SNe and find that their unique color evolution can be\nused to separate them from 91bg-like and normal type Ia SNe. This selection\nfunction will be especially important in the spectroscopically incomplete\nZwicky Transient Facility/Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era. We measure the\nrelative rate of 02cx-like SNe to normal SNe Ia and find $r_{N_{02cx}/N_{Ia}} =\n25^{+75}_{-18.5}\\%$. Finally, we close by recommending that LSST periodically\nevaluate, and possibly update, its observing cadence to maximize transient\nscience.\n", "  We introduce a rigorous, physically appealing, and practical way to measure\ndistances between exchange-only correlations of interacting many-electron\nsystems, which works regardless of their size and inhomogeneity. We show that\nthis distance captures fundamental physical features such as the periodicity of\natomic elements, and that it can be used to effectively and efficiently analyze\nthe performance of density functional approximations. We suggest that this\nmetric can find useful applications in high-throughput materials design.\n", "  Recently, thermal Hall effect has been observed in the paramagnetic state of\nVolborthite, which consists of distorted Kagome layers with $S=1/2$ local\nmoments. Despite the appearance of a magnetic order below $1 \\, \\mathrm{K}$,\nthe response to external magnetic field and unusual properties of the\nparamagnetic state above $1 \\, \\mathrm{K}$ suggest possible realization of\nexotic quantum phases. Motivated by these discoveries, we investigate possible\nspin liquid phases with fermionic spinon excitations in a non-symmorphic\nversion of the Kagome lattice, which belongs to the two-dimensional\ncrystallographic group $p2gg$. This non-symmorphic structure is consistent with\nthe spin model obtained in the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.\nUsing projective symmetry group (PSG) analysis and fermionic parton mean field\ntheory, we identify twelve distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid states, four of\nwhich are found to have correspondence in the eight Schwinger boson spin liquid\nstates we classified earlier. We focus on the four fermionic states with\nbosonic counterpart and find that the spectrum of their corresponding root\n$U(1)$ states feature spinon Fermi surface. The existence of spinon Fermi\nsurface in candidate spin liquid states may offer a possible explanation of the\nfinite thermal Hall conductivity observed in Volborthite.\n", "  The chaotic nature of planet dynamics in the solar system suggests the\nrelevance of a statistical approach to planetary orbits. In such a statistical\ndescription, the time-dependent position and velocity of the planets are\nreplaced by the probability density function (PDF) of their orbital elements.\nIt is quite natural to set up this kind of approach in the framework of\nstatistical mechanics. In the present paper I focus on the collisionless\nexcitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions in\na planetary system, the prototype of such a dynamics being the future planet\ntrajectories in the solar system. I thus address the statistical mechanics of\nthe planetary orbits in the solar system and try to reproduce the PDFs\nnumerically constructed by Laskar (2008). I show that the microcanonical\nensemble of the Laplace-Lagrange theory accurately reproduce the statistics of\nthe giant planet orbits. To model the inner planets I then investigate the\nansatz of equiprobability in the phase space constrained by the secular\nintegrals of motion. The eccentricity and inclination PDFs of Earth and Venus\nare reproduced with no free parameters. Within the limitations of a stationary\nmodel, the predictions also show a reasonable agreement with Mars PDFs and that\nof Mercury inclination. The eccentricity of Mercury demands in contrast a\ndeeper analysis. I finally revisit Laskar's random walk approach to the time\ndependence of the inner planet PDFs. Such a statistical theory could be\ncombined with direct numerical simulations of planet trajectories in the\ncontext of planet formation, which is likely to be a chaotic process.\n", "  The Horndeski Lagrangian brings together all possible interactions between\ngravity and a scalar field that yield second-order field equations in\nfour-dimensional spacetime. As originally proposed, it only addresses\nphenomenology without torsion, which is a non-Riemannian feature of geometry.\nSince torsion can potentially affect interesting phenomena such as\ngravitational waves and early Universe inflation, in this paper we allow\ntorsion to exist and propagate within the Horndeski framework. To achieve this\ngoal, we cast the Horndeski Lagrangian in Cartan's first-order formalism, and\nintroduce wave operators designed to act covariantly on p-form fields that\ncarry Lorentz indices. We find that nonminimal couplings and second-order\nderivatives of the scalar field in the Lagrangian are indeed generic sources of\ntorsion. Metric perturbations couple to the background torsion and new\ntorsional modes appear. These may be detected via gravitational waves but not\nthrough Yang-Mills gauge bosons.\n", "  The dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the low-lying states of Ca$^{+}$ for\nlinearly and circularly polarized light are calculated by using relativistic\nconfiguration interaction plus core polarization (RCICP) approach. The magic\nwavelengths, at which the two levels of the transitions have the same ac Stark\nshifts, for $4s$-$4p_{j,m}$ and $4s$-$3d_{j,m}$ magnetic sublevels transitions\nare determined. The present magic wavelengths for linearly polarized light\nagree with the available results excellently. The polarizability for the\ncircularly polarized light has the scalar, vector and tensor components. The\ndynamic polarizability is different for each of magnetic sublevels of the\natomic state. Additional magic wavelengths have been found for the circularly\npolarized light. We recommend that the measurement of the magic wavelength near\n850 nm for $4s-4p_{\\frac32,m=\\pm\\frac32,\\pm\\frac12}$ could be able to determine\nthe oscillator strength ratio of $f_{4p_{\\frac32} \\to 3d_{\\frac32}}$ and\n$f_{4p_{\\frac32} \\to 3d_{\\frac52}}$.\n", "  We present a simple model of defects embedded in flat spacetime, where the\nmodel is designed to maintain Lorentz invariance over large length scales. Even\nwithout remnant Lorentz violation, there are still effects from these spacetime\ndefects on the propagation of physical fields, notably mass generation for\nscalars and Dirac fermions.\n", "  We report thermoelectric (TE) properties of topological surface Dirac states\n(TSDS) in three-dimensional topological insulators (3D-TIs) purely isolated\nfrom the bulk by employing single crystal Bi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$\nfilms epitaxially grown in the ultrathin limit. Two intrinsic nontrivial\ntopological surface states, a metallic TSDS (m-TSDS) and a gap-opened\nsemiconducting topological state (g-TSDS), are successfully observed by\nelectrical transport, and important TE parameters (electrical conductivity\n(${\\sigma}$), thermal conductivity (${\\kappa}$), and thermopower ($S$)) are\naccurately determined. Pure m-TSDS gives $S$=-44 {\\mu}VK$^{-1}$, which is an\norder of magnitude higher than those of the conventional metals and the value\nis enhanced to -212 {\\mu}VK$^{-1}$ for g-TSDS. It is clearly shown that the\nsemi-classical Boltzmann transport equation (SBTE) in the framework of constant\nrelaxation time (${\\tau}$) most frequently used for conventional analysis\ncannot be valid in 3D-TIs and strong energy dependent relaxation time\n${\\tau}(E)$ beyond the Born approximation is essential for making intrinsic\ninterpretations. Although ${\\sigma}$ is protected on the m-TSDS, ${\\kappa}$ is\ngreatly influenced by the disorder on the topological surface, giving a\ndissimilar effect between topologically protected electronic conduction and\nphonon transport.\n", "  We show that eigen-energies and energy eigenstates play different roles in\nthe equilibration process of an isolated quantum system. Their roles are\nrevealed numerically by exchanging the eigen-energies between an integrable\nmodel and a non-integrable model. We ?find that the structure of eigenenergies\nof a non-integrable model characterized by non-degeneracy ensures that quantum\nrevival occurs rarely whereas the energy eigenstates of a non-integrable model\nsuppress the fluctuations for the equilibrated quantum state. Our study is\naided with a quantum entropy that describes how randomly a wave function is\ndistributed in quantum phase space. We also demonstrate with this quantum\nentropy the validity of Berry's conjecture for energy eigenstates. This implies\nthat the energy eigenstates of a non-integrable model appear indeed \"random\".\n", "  We investigate stationary states of the linear damped stochastic oscillator\ndriven by L\\'evy noises. In the long time limit kinetic and potential energies\nof the oscillator do not fulfill the equipartition theorem and their\ndistributions follow the power-law asymptotics. At the same time, partition of\nthe mechanical energy is controlled by the damping coefficient. We show that in\nthe limit of vanishing damping a stochastic analogue of the equipartition\ntheorem can be proposed, namely the statistical properties of potential and\nkinetic energies attain distributions characterized by the same width. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the ratio of instantaneous kinetic and potential energies\nwhich signifies departure from the mechanical energy equipartition, follows\nuniversal power-law asymptotics.\n", "  Context. It is still an open issue whether a self-gravitating accretion disk\nfragments. There are many different physical and numerical explanations for\nfragmentation, but simulations often show a non-convergent behavior for ever\nbetter resolution.\n  Aims. We investigate the influence of different numerical limiters in Godunov\ntype schemes on the fragmentation boundary in self- gravitating disks.\n  Methods. We compare the linear and non-linear outcome in two-dimensional\nshearingsheet simulations using the VANLEER and the SUPERBEE limiter.\n  Results. We show that choosing inappropriate limiting functions to handle\nshock-capturing in Godunov type schemes can lead to an overestimation of the\nsurface density in regions with shallow density gradients. The effect amplifies\nitself on timescales comparable to the dynamical timescale even at high\nresolutions. This is exactly the environment, where clumps are expected to\nform. The effect is present without, but scaled up by, self-gravity and also\ndoes not depend on cooling. Moreover it can be backtracked to a well known\neffect called oversteepening. If the effect is also observed in the linear\ncase, the fragmentation limit is shifted to larger values of the critical\ncooling timescale.\n", "  Hybrid quantum systems have been developed with various mechanical, optical\nand microwave harmonic oscillators. The coupling produces a rich library of\ninteractions including two mode squeezing, swapping interactions, back-action\nevasion and thermal control. In a multimode mechanical system, coupling\nresonators of different scales (both in frequency and mass) leverages the\nadvantages of each resonance. For example: a high frequency, easily manipulated\nresonator could be entangled with a low frequency massive object for tests of\ngravitational decoherence. Here we demonstrate coherent optomechanical state\nswapping between two spatially and frequency separated resonators with a mass\nratio of 4. We find that, by using two laser beams far detuned from an optical\ncavity resonance, efficient state transfer is possible through a process very\nsimilar to STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) in atomic physics.\nAlthough the demonstration is classical, the same technique can be used to\ngenerate entanglement between oscillators in the quantum regime.\n", "  Halo bias is the one of the key ingredients of the halo models. It was shown\nat a given redshift to be only dependent, to the first order, on the halo mass.\nIn this study, four types of cosmic web environments: clusters, filaments,\nsheets and voids are defined within a state of the art high resolution $N$-body\nsimulation. Within those environments, we use both halo-dark matter\ncross-correlation and halo-halo auto correlation functions to probe the\nclustering properties of halos. The nature of the halo bias differs strongly\namong the four different cosmic web environments we describe. With respect to\nthe overall population, halos in clusters have significantly lower biases in\nthe {$10^{11.0}\\sim 10^{13.5}h^{-1}\\rm M_\\odot$} mass range. In other\nenvironments however, halos show extremely enhanced biases up to a factor 10 in\nvoids for halos of mass {$\\sim 10^{12.0}h^{-1}\\rm M_\\odot$}. Such a strong\ncosmic web environment dependence in the halo bias may play an important role\nin future cosmological and galaxy formation studies. Within this cosmic web\nframework, the age dependency of halo bias is found to be only significant in\nclusters and filaments for relatively small halos $\\la 10^{12.5}\\msunh$.\n", "  We introduce a simple, physically-motivated variational ground state for the\nquantum Rabi model, and demonstrate that it provides a high-fidelity\napproximation of the true ground state in all parameter regimes (including\nintermediate and strong coupling regimes). Our variational state is constructed\nusing Gaussian cavity states and nonorthogonal qubit pointer states, and\ncontains only three variational parameters. We use our state to develop a\nheuristic understanding of how the ground state evolves with increasing\ncoupling, and find a previously unexplored regime where the ground state\ncorresponds to the cavity being in a nearly pure Schr\\\"odinger cat state.\n", "  Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) are primordial fluctuations\nthat balance baryon and dark-matter isocurvature to leave the total matter\ndensity unperturbed. The effects of CIPs on the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are similar to those produced by weak lensing of the CMB:\nsmoothing of the power spectrum, and generation of non-Gaussian features.\nPrevious work considered the CIP effects on the CMB power-spectrum but\nneglected to include the CIP effects on estimates of the lensing potential\npower spectrum (though its contribution to the non-Gaussian, connected, part of\nthe CMB trispectrum). Here, the CIP contribution to the standard estimator for\nthe lensing potential power-spectrum is derived, and along with the CIP\ncontributions to the CMB power-spectrum, Planck data is used to place limits on\nthe root-mean-square CIP fluctuations on CMB scales, $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2(R_{\\rm\nCMB})$. The resulting constraint of $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2(R_{\\rm CMB}) < 4.3\n\\times 10^{-3}$ using this new technique improves on past work by a factor of\n$\\sim 3$. We find that for Planck data our constraints almost reach the\nsensitivity of the optimal CIP estimator. The method presented here is\ncurrently the most sensitive probe of the amplitude of a scale-invariant CIP\npower spectrum placing an upper limit of $A_{\\rm CIP}< 0.017$ at 95% CL. Future\nmeasurements of the large-scale CMB lensing potential power spectrum could\nprobe CIP amplitudes as low as $\\Delta_{\\rm rms}^2(R_{\\rm CMB}) = 8 \\times\n10^{-5}$ ($A_{\\rm CIP} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-4}$).\n", "  We study experimentally and theoretically discrete solitons in crystalline\nstructures consisting of several tens of laser-cooled ions confined in a\nradiofrequency trap. Resonantly exciting localized, spectrally gapped\nvibrational modes of the soliton, a nonlinear mechanism leads to a\nnonequilibrium steady state of the continuously cooled crystal. We find that\nthe propagation and the escape of the soliton out of its a\nquasi-one-dimensional channel can be described as a thermal activation\nmechanism. We control the effective temperature of the soliton's collective\ncoordinate by the amplitude of the external excitation. Furthermore, the global\ntrapping potential permits controlling the soliton dynamics and realizing\ndirected transport depending on its topological charge.\n", "  Neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR) studies are presented\nfor the newly characterized polymorph of NiNb$_2$O$_6$ ($\\beta$-NiNb$_2$O$_6$)\nwith space group P4$_2$/n and $\\mu$SR data only for the previously known\ncolumbite structure polymorph with space group Pbcn. The magnetic structure of\nthe P4$_2$/n form was determined from neutron diffraction using both powder and\nsingle crystal data. Powder neutron diffraction determined an ordering wave\nvector $\\vec{k}$ = ($\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}$). Single crystal data\nconfirmed the same $\\vec{k}$-vector and showed that the correct magnetic\nstructure consists of antiferromagnetically-coupled chains running along the a\nor b-axes in adjacent Ni$^{2+}$ layers perpendicular to the c-axis, which is\nconsistent with the expected exchange interaction hierarchy in this system. The\nrefined magnetic structure is compared with the known magnetic structures of\nthe closely related tri-rutile phases, NiSb$_2$O$_6$ and NiTa$_2$O$_6$. $\\mu$SR\ndata finds a transition temperature of $T_N \\sim$ 15 K for this system, while\nthe columbite polymorph exhibits a lower $T_N =$ 5.7(3) K. Our $\\mu$SR\nmeasurements also allowed us to estimate the critical exponent of the order\nparameter $\\beta$ for each polymorph. We found $\\beta =$ 0.25(3) and 0.16(2)\nfor the $\\beta$ and columbite polymorphs respectively. The single crystal\nneutron scattering data gives a value for the critical exponent $\\beta\n=$~0.28(3) for $\\beta$-NiNb$_2$O$_6$, in agreement with the $\\mu$SR value.\nWhile both systems have $\\beta$ values less than 0.3, which is indicative of\nreduced dimensionality, this effect appears to be much stronger for the\ncolumbite system. In other words, although both systems appear to\nwell-described by $S = 1$ spin chains, the interchain interactions in the\n$\\beta$-polymorph are likely much larger.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the subgapped transport phenomena through a\nnormal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction made up of ultra thin topological\ninsulator with proximity induced superconductivity. The dimensional crossover\nfrom three dimensional ($3$D) topological insulator (TI) to thin\ntwo-dimensional ($2$D) TI introduces a new degree of freedom, the so-called\nhybridization or coupling between the two surface states. We explore the role\nof hybridization in transport properties of the NSN junction, especially how it\naffects the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We observe that a rib-like\npattern appears in CAR probability profile while examined as a function of\nangle of incidence and length of the superconductor. Depending on the incoming\nand reflection or transmission channel, CAR probability can be maneuvered to be\nhigher than $97\\%$ under suitable coupling between the two TI surface states\nalong with appropriate gate voltage and doping concentration in the normal\nregion. Coupling between the two surfaces also induces an additional\noscillation envelope in the behavior of the angle averaged conductance, with\nthe variation of the length of the superconductor. The behavior of co-tunneling\n(CT) probability is also very sensitive to the coupling and other parameters.\nFinally, we also explore the shot noise cross correlation and show that the\nbehavior of the same can be monotonic or non-monotonic depending on the doping\nconcentration in the normal region. Under suitable circumstances, shot noise\ncross correlation can change sign from positive to negative or vice versa\ndepending on the relative strength of CT and CAR.\n", "  We propose a new class of tensor network state as a model for the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence and holography. This class is demonstrated to retain key\nfeatures of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), in that\nthey describe quantum states with algebraic correlation functions, have free\nvariational parameters, and are efficiently contractible. Yet, unlike MERA,\nthey are built according to a uniform tiling of hyperbolic space, without\ninherent directionality or preferred locations in the holographic bulk, and\nthus circumvent key arguments made against the MERA as a model for AdS/CFT.\nNovel holographic features of this tensor network class are examined, such as\nan equivalence between the causal cones C(R) and the entanglement wedges E(R)\nof connected boundary regions R.\n", "  The first hint of the neutrino mass hierarchy is believed to come from the\nlong-baseline experiment NO$\\nu$A. Recent results from the NO$\\nu$A shows a\nmild preference towards the CP phase $\\delta_{13} = -90^\\circ$ and normal\nhierarchy. Fortunately this is the favorable area of the parameter space which\ndoes not suffer from the hierarchy-$\\delta_{13}$ degeneracy and thus NO$\\nu$A\ncan have good hierarchy sensitivity for this true combination of hierarchy and\n$\\delta_{13}$. Apart from the hierarchy-$\\delta_{13}$ degeneracy there is also\nthe octant-$\\delta_{13}$ degeneracy. But this does not affect the favorable\nparameter space of NO$\\nu$A as this degeneracy can be resolved with a balanced\nneutrino and antineutrino run. However, ff we consider the existence of a light\nsterile neutrino then there may be additional degeneracies which can spoil the\nhierarchy sensitivity of NO$\\nu$A even in the favorable parameter space. In the\npresent work we find that apart from the degeneracies mentioned above, there\nare additional hierarchy and octant degeneracies that appear with the new phase\n$\\delta_{14}$ in the presence of a light sterile neutrino in the eV scale. In\ncontrast to the hierarchy and octant degeneracies appearing with $\\delta_{13}$,\nthe parameter space for hierarchy-$\\delta_{14}$ degeneracy is different in\nneutrinos and antineutrinos though the octant-$\\delta_{14}$ degeneracy behaves\nsimilarly in neutrinos and antineutrinos. We study the effect of these\ndegeneracies on the hierarchy sensitivity of NO$\\nu$A for the true normal\nhierarchy.\n", "  We studied the local Ru 4d electronic structure of alpha-RuCl3 by means of\npolarization dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ru-L2,3 edges. We\nobserved a vanishingly small linear dichroism indicating that electronically\nthe Ru 4d local symmetry is highly cubic. Using full multiplet cluster\ncalculations we were able to reproduce the spectra excellently and to extract\nthat the trigonal splitting of the t2g orbitals is -12 $\\pm10$ meV, i.e.\nnegligible as compared to the Ru 4d spin-orbit coupling constant. Consistent\nwith our magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we found that the ratio of\nthe orbital and spin moments is 2.0, the value expected for a Jeff = 1/2 ground\nstate. We have thus shown that as far as the Ru 4d local properties are\nconcerned, alpha-RuCl3 is an ideal candidate for the realization of Kitaev\nphysics.\n", "  In thermal convection, roughness is often used as a means to enhance heat\ntransport, expressed in Nusselt number. Yet there is no consensus on whether\nthe Nusselt vs. Rayleigh number scaling exponent ($\\mathrm{Nu} \\sim\n\\mathrm{Ra}^\\beta$) increases or remains unchanged. Here we numerically\ninvestigate turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection over rough plates in two\ndimensions, up to $\\mathrm{Ra}=10^{12}$. Varying the height and wavelength of\nthe roughness elements with over 200 combinations, we reveal the existence of\ntwo universal regimes. In the first regime, the local effective scaling\nexponent can reach up to 1/2. However, this cannot be explained as the\nattainment of the so-called ultimate regime as suggested in previous studies,\nbecause a further increase in $\\mathrm{Ra}$ leads to the second regime, in\nwhich the scaling saturates back to a value close to the smooth case.\nCounterintuitively, the transition from the first to the second regime\ncorresponds to the competition between bulk and boundary layer flow: from the\nbulk-dominated regime back to the classical boundary-layer-controlled regime.\nOur study clearly demonstrates that the local $1/2$ scaling does not signal the\nonset of asymptotic ultimate thermal convection.\n", "  High-temperature superconductivity is closely adjacent to a long-range\nantiferromagnet, which is called a parent compound. In cuprates, all parent\ncompounds are alike and carrier doping leads to superconductivity, so a unified\nphase diagram can be drawn. However, the properties of parent compounds for\niron-based superconductors show significant diversity and both carrier and\nisovalent dopings can cause superconductivity, which casts doubt on the idea\nthat there exists a unified phase diagram for them. Here we show that the\nordered moments in a variety of iron pnictides are inversely proportional to\nthe effective Curie constants of their nematic susceptibility. This unexpected\nscaling behavior suggests that the magnetic ground states of iron pnictides can\nbe achieved by tuning the strength of nematic fluctuations. Therefore, a\nunified phase diagram can be established where superconductivity emerges from a\nhypothetical parent compound with a large ordered moment but weak nematic\nfluctuations, which suggests that iron-based superconductors are strongly\ncorrelated electron systems.\n", "  This paper is a sequel to our previous one (Kato et al.2015), which\ncalculated the luminosities and spectra of electron-type anti-neutrinos\n($\\bar{\\nu}_e$'s) from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae. Expecting\nthat a capability to detect electron-type neutrinos ($\\nu_e$'s) will increase\ndramatically with the emergence of liquid-argon detectors such as DUNE, we\nbroaden the scope in this study to include all-flavors of neutrinos emitted\nfrom the pre-bounce phase. We pick up three progenitor models of an electron\ncapture supernova (ECSN) and iron-core collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe). We find\nthat the number luminosities reach $\\sim10^{57} \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and\n$\\sim10^{53} \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ at maximum for $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_e$,\nrespectively. We also estimate the numbers of detection events at terrestrial\nneutrino detectors including DUNE, taking flavor oscillations into account and\nassuming the distance to the progenitors to be 200 pc. It is demonstrated that\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$'s from the ECSN-progenitor will be undetected at almost all\ndetectors, whereas we will be able to observe $\\gtrsim$15900 $\\nu_e$'s at DUNE\nfor the inverted mass hierarchy. From the FeCCSN-progenitors, the number of\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ events will be largest for JUNO, 200-900 $\\bar{\\nu}_e$'s,\ndepending on the mass hierarchy whereas the number of $\\nu_e$ events at DUNE is\n$\\gtrsim$2100 for the inverted mass hierarchy. These results imply that the\ndetection of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$'s is useful to distinguish FeCCSN- from\nECSN-progenitors, while $\\nu_e$'s will provide us with detailed information on\nthe collapse phase regardless of the type and mass of progenitor.\n", "  The low distance, $z=0.0591$, of GRB 100316D and its association with SN\n2010bh represent two important motivations for studying this host galaxy and\nthe GRB's immediate environment with the Integral-Field Spectrographs like\nVLT/MUSE. Its large field-of-view allows us to create 2D maps of gas\nmetallicity, ionization level, and the star-formation rate distribution maps,\nas well as to investigate the presence of possible host companions. The host is\na late-type dwarf irregular galaxy with multiple star-forming regions and an\nextended central region with signatures of on-going shock interactions. The GRB\nsite is characterized by the lowest metallicity, the highest star-formation\nrate and the youngest ($\\sim$ 20-30 Myr) stellar population in the galaxy,\nwhich suggest a GRB progenitor stellar population with masses up to 20 -- 40\n$M_{\\odot}$. We note that the GRB site has an offset of $\\sim$660pc from the\nmost luminous SF region in the host. The observed SF activity in this galaxy\nmay have been triggered by a relatively recent gravitational encounter between\nthe host and a small undetected ($L_{H\\alpha} \\leq 10^{36}$ erg/s) companion.\n", "  The moist-air entropy can be used to analyze and better understand the\ngeneral circulation of the atmosphere or convective motions. Isentropic\nanalyses are commonly based on studies of different equivalent potential\ntemperatures, all of which are assumed to fully represent the entropy of moist\nair. It is, however, possible to rely either on statistical physics or the\nthird law of thermodynamics when defining and computing the absolute entropy of\nmoist air and to study the corresponding third-law potential temperature, which\nis different from the previous ones. The third law assumes that the entropy for\nthe most stable crystalline state of all substances is zero when approaching\nabsolute zero temperature.\n  This paper shows that the way all these moist-air potential temperatures are\ndefined has a large impact on: (i) the plotting of the isentropes for a\nsimulation of the Hurricane DUMILE; (ii) the changes in moist-air entropy\ncomputed for a steam cycle defined for this Hurricane; (iii) the analyses of\nisentropic stream functions computed for this Hurricane; and (iv) the\ncomputations of the heat input, the work function, and the efficiency defined\nfor this steam cycle.\n  The moist-air entropy is a state function and the isentropic analyses must be\ncompletely determined by the local moist-air conditions. The large differences\nobserved between the different formulations of moist-air entropy are\ninterpreted as proof that the isentropic analyses of moist-air atmospheric\nmotions must be achieved by using the third-law potential temperature defined\nfrom general thermodynamics.\n", "  Two-dimensional electron gases with strong spin-orbit coupling covered by a\nsuperconducting layer offer a flexible and potentially scalable platform for\nMajorana networks. We predict Majorana bound states (MBSs) to appear for\nexperimentally achievable parameters and realistic gate potentials in two\ndesigns: either underneath a narrow stripe of a superconducting layer\n(S-stripes) or where a narrow stripe has been removed from a uniform layer\n(N-stripes). The coupling of the MBSs can be tuned for both types in a wide\nrange (< 1 neV to >10 $\\mu$eV) using gates placed adjacent to the stripes. For\nboth types, we numerically compute the local density of states for two parallel\nMajorana-stripe ends as well as Majorana trijunctions formed in a tuning-fork\ngeometry. The MBS coupling between parallel Majorana stripes can be suppressed\nbelow 1 neV for potential barriers in the meV range for separations of about\n200 nm. We further show that the MBS couplings in a trijunction can be\ngate-controlled in a range similar to the intra-stripe coupling while\nmaintaining a sizable gap to the excited states (tens of $\\mu$eV). Altogether,\nthis suggests that braiding can carried out on a time scale of 10-100 ns.\n", "  We demonstrate tunable pulling and pushing optical forces on plasmonic\nnanostructures around Fano resonance. The plasmonic nanostructure containing a\nspherical core with optical gain and a metallic shell shows much larger optical\npulling force than a pure gain sphere. One can obtain large field enhancement\nand giant pulling force at the emerged quadrupole mode. The introduction of\noptical pump compensate the dissipative loss from metal shell, thus enable the\nstrong coupling between a narrow quadrupole mode and a board dipole mode,\ngiving rise to Fano resonance. The giant negative forces origin from the\nreversal of electric field at Fano resonance, which lead to pulling force on\nbound currents and charges. Meanwhile, the separation of the Lorentz force\nhelps to reveal the nature of the pulling forces in gain system. We have shown\nthat by applying the Lorentz force density formula, it is possible to obtain\nthe correct value of the force inside our complex inhomogenous structure made\nup of dispersive and lossy metamaterial irrespective of the electromagnetic\nmomentum density. Our results provide a practical way to manipulate\nnanoparticles and give deep insight into light-matter interaction.\n", "  We present 3D \"zoom-in\" simulations of the formation of two molecular clouds\nout of the galactic interstellar medium. We model the clouds - identified from\nthe SILCC simulations - with a resolution of up to 0.06 pc using adaptive mesh\nrefinement in combination with a chemical network to follow heating, cooling,\nand the formation of H$_2$ and CO including (self-) shielding. The two clouds\nare assembled within a few million years with mass growth rates of up to $\\sim$\n10$^{-2}$ M$_\\mathrm{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ and final masses of $\\sim$ 50 000\nM$_\\mathrm{sun}$. A spatial resolution of $\\lesssim$ 0.1 pc is required for\nconvergence with respect to the mass, velocity dispersion, and chemical\nabundances of the clouds, although these properties also depend on the cloud\ndefinition such as based on density thresholds, H$_2$ or CO mass fraction. To\navoid grid artefacts, the progressive increase of resolution has to occur\nwithin the free-fall time of the densest structures (1 - 1.5 Myr) and $\\gtrsim$\n200 time steps should be spent on each refinement level before the resolution\nis progressively increased further. This avoids the formation of spurious,\nlarge-scale, rotating clumps from unresolved turbulent flows. While CO is a\ngood tracer for the evolution of dense gas with number densities $n \\geq$ 300\ncm$^{-3}$, H$_2$ is also found for $n \\lesssim 30$ cm$^{-3}$ due to turbulent\nmixing and becomes dominant at column densities around 30 - 50 M$_\\mathrm{sun}$\npc$^{-2}$. The CO-to-H$_2$ ratio steadily increases within the first 2 Myr\nwhereas $X_\\mathrm{CO}\\simeq$ 1 - 4 $\\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km\ns$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ is approximately constant since the CO(1-0) line quickly\nbecomes optically thick.\n", "  Driven-dissipative systems in two dimensions can differ substantially from\ntheir equilibrium counterparts. In particular, a dramatic loss of off-diagonal\nalgebraic order and superfluidity has been predicted to occur due to the\ninterplay between coherent dynamics and external drive and dissipation in the\nthermodynamic limit. We show here that the order adopted by the system can be\nsubstantially altered by a simple, experimentally viable, tuning of the driving\nprocess. More precisely, by considering the long-wavelength phase dynamics of a\npolariton quantum fluid in the optical parametric oscillator regime, we\ndemonstrate that simply changing the strength of the pumping mechanism in an\nappropriate parameter range can substantially alter the level of effective\nspatial anisotropy induced by the driving laser, and move the system into\ndistinct scaling regimes. These include: (i) the classic algebraically ordered\nsuperfluid below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, as in\nequilibrium; (ii) the non-equilibrium, long-wave-length fluctuation dominated\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) phase; and the two associated topological defect\ndominated disordered phases caused by proliferation of (iii) entropic BKT\nvortex-antivortex pairs or (iv) repelling vortices in the KPZ phase. Further,\nby analysing the renormalization group flow in a finite system, we examine the\nlength scales associated with these phases, and assess their observability in\ncurrent experimental conditions.\n", "  Evolutionary tracks from the zero age main sequence to the asymptotic giant\nbranch were computed for stars with initial masses 2M_\\odot <= Mzams <=\n5M_\\odot and metallicity Z=0.02. Some models of evolutionary sequences were\nused as initial conditions for equations of radiation hydrodynamics and\nturbulent convection describing radial stellar pulsations. The early asymptotic\ngiant branch stars are shown to pulsate in the fundamental mode with periods\nfrom 30 to 400 day. The rate of period change gradually increases as the star\nevolves but is too small to be detected (d ln P/dt < 1.e-5 yr^-1). Pulsation\nproperties of thermally pulsing AGB stars are investigated on time intervals\ncomprising 17 thermal pulses for evolutionary sequences with intial masses\nMzams=2M_\\odot and 3M_\\odot and 6 thermal pulses for Mzams=4M_\\odot and\n5M_\\odot. TP-AGB stars with initial masses Mzams<=3M_\\odot pulsate either in\nthe fundamental mode or in the first overtone, whereas more massive red giants\n(Mzams>=4M_\\odot) pulsate in the fundamental mode with periods as long as 1.e3\nday. Most rapid pulsation period change with rate -0.02 < d ln P/dt < -0.01\nyr^-1 occurs during decrease of the surface luminosity after the maximum helium\nluminosity. The rate of subsequent increase of the period is d ln P/dt <= 5.e-3\nyr^-1.\n", "  We describe the first precision measurement of the electron's electric dipole\nmoment (eEDM, $d_e$) using trapped molecular ions, demonstrating the\napplication of spin interrogation times over 700 ms to achieve high sensitivity\nand stringent rejection of systematic errors. Through electron spin resonance\nspectroscopy on $^{180}{\\rm Hf}^{19}{\\rm F}^{+}$ in its metastable\n$^{3}\\Delta_{1}$ electronic state, we obtain $d_e = (0.9 \\pm 7.7_{\\rm stat} \\pm\n1.7_{\\rm syst}) \\times 10^{-29}\\,e\\,{\\rm cm}$, resulting in an upper bound of\n$|d_e| < 1.3 \\times 10^{-28}\\,e\\,{\\rm cm}$ (90% confidence). Our result\nprovides independent confirmation of the current upper bound of $|d_e| < 9.3\n\\times 10^{-29}\\,e\\,{\\rm cm}$ [J. Baron $\\textit{et al.}$, Science\n$\\textbf{343}$, 269 (2014)], and offers the potential to improve on this limit\nin the near future.\n", "  We propose a simple theory for the dynamics of model glass-forming fluids,\nwhich should be solvable using a mean-field-like approach. The theory is based\non transparent physical assumptions, which can be tested in computer\nsimulations. The theory predicts an ergodicity-breaking transition that is\nidentical to the so-called dynamic transition predicted within the replica\napproach. Thus, it can provide the missing dynamic component of the random\nfirst order transition framework. In the large-dimensional limit the theory\nreproduces the result of a recent exact calculation of Maimbourg et al. [PRL\n116, 015902 (2016)]. Our approach provides an alternative, physically motivated\nderivation of this result.\n", "  We use a semi-analytic model, ${\\it Delphi}$, that jointly tracks the dark\nmatter and baryonic assembly of high-redshift ($z \\simeq 4-20$) galaxies to\ngain insight on the number density of Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) hosts\nin three different cosmologies: the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model and\ntwo Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models with particle masses of 3.5 and 1.5 keV.\nObtaining the Lyman-Werner (LW) luminosity of each galaxy from ${\\it Delphi}$,\nwe use a clustering bias analysis to identify all, pristine halos with a virial\ntemperature $T_{vir}>=10^4$ K that are irradiated by a LW background above a\ncritical value as, DCBH hosts. In good agreement with previous studies, we find\nthe DCBH number density rises from $\\sim10^{-6.1}$ to $\\sim 10^{-3.5}\\,\n\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ from $z\\simeq 17.5$ to $8$ in the CDM model using a\ncritical LW background value of $30 J_{21}$ (where $J_{21}= 10^{-21} \\, {\\rm\nerg\\, s^{-1}\\, Hz^{-1} \\, cm^{-2} \\, sr^{-1}}$). We find that a combination of\ndelayed structure formation and an accelerated assembly of galaxies results in\na later metal-enrichment and an accelerated build-up of the LW background in\nthe 1.5 keV WDM model, resulting in DCBH hosts persisting down to much lower\nredshifts ($z \\simeq 5$) as compared to CDM where DCBH hosts only exist down to\n$z \\simeq 8$. We end by showing how the expected colours in three different\nbands of the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the forthcoming James Webb\nSpace Telescope (${\\it JWST}$) can be used to hunt for potential $z \\simeq 5-9$\nDCBHs, allowing hints on the WDM particle mass.\n", "  We present stacked average far-infrared spectra of a sample of 197 dusty,\nstar-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $0.005 < z < 4$ using close to 90% of the\nSPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) extragalactic data archive from the\nHerschel Space Observatory based on 3.5 years of science operations. These\nspectra explore an observed-frame $\\rm 447\\,GHz-1568\\,GHz$ ($\\rm 191\\,\\mu\nm-671\\,\\mu m$) frequency (wavelength) range allowing us to observe the main\natomic and molecular lines emitted by gas in the interstellar medium. The\nsample is sub-divided into five redshift bins at $0.005 < z < 0.05$, $0.05 < z\n< 0.2$, $0.2 < z < 0.5$, $0.8 < z <2$, and $2 < z < 4$. To study the dependence\nof observed spectral lines on total infrared luminosity, the sources in a\nsubset of the redshift bins are stacked in luminosity bins. These stacked\nspectra are used to determine the average properties of the interstellar medium\nand dense molecular gas properties of DSFGs, in particular, the fine-structure\nline ([CII] 158 $\\mu$m and [OI] 63 $\\mu$m) luminosity ratios, and the line to\nfar-IR luminosity ratios are used to model the gas density and radiation field\nstrength in the photodissociation regions (PDRs). For the low-redshift sample,\nwe additionally present the average spectral line energy distributions (SLED)\nof CO and $\\rm{H_2O}$ rotational transitions and also consider PDR conditions\nbased on a combination of [CI] 370 $\\mu$m and 609 $\\mu$m and $\\rm CO (7-6)$\nlines. For the high-z ($0.8 < z < 4$) sample PDR models suggest a molecular gas\ndistribution in the presence of a radiation field that is at least a factor of\n10$^3$ larger than the Milky-Way and with a neutral gas density of roughly\n10$^3$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$. The corresponding PDR models for the low-z sample\nsuggest a UV radiation field and gas density comparable to those at high-z.\n", "  Data assimilation is widely used to improve flood forecasting capability,\nespecially through parameter inference requiring statistical information on the\nuncertain input parameters (upstream discharge, friction coefficient) as well\nas on the variability of the water level and its sensitivity with respect to\nthe inputs. For particle filter or ensemble Kalman filter, stochastically\nestimating probability density function and covariance matrices from a Monte\nCarlo random sampling requires a large ensemble of model evaluations, limiting\ntheir use in real-time application. To tackle this issue, fast surrogate models\nbased on Polynomial Chaos and Gaussian Process can be used to represent the\nspatially distributed water level in place of solving the shallow water\nequations. This study investigates the use of these surrogates to estimate\nprobability density functions and covariance matrices at a reduced\ncomputational cost and without the loss of accuracy, in the perspective of\nensemble-based data assimilation. This study focuses on 1-D steady state flow\nsimulated with MASCARET over the Garonne River (South-West France). Results\nshow that both surrogates feature similar performance to the Monte-Carlo random\nsampling, but for a much smaller computational budget; a few MASCARET\nsimulations (on the order of 10-100) are sufficient to accurately retrieve\ncovariance matrices and probability density functions all along the river, even\nwhere the flow dynamic is more complex due to heterogeneous bathymetry. This\npaves the way for the design of surrogate strategies suitable for representing\nunsteady open-channel flows in data assimilation.\n", "  For a field theory with a gravitational dual, we study holographic fidelity\nsusceptibility for two states related by a deformation of a relevant operator.\nTo do so, we study back reaction of a massive scalar field on the asymptotic\nbehavior of the metric in an Einstein gravity coupled to a massive scalar\nfield. Identifying the two states, holographically, with the original and back\nreacted geometries, the corresponding holographic fidelity susceptibility is\ngiven by the difference of the volume of an extremal time slice evaluated on\nthe original and back reacted geometries.\n", "  We explore whether perturbative interacting fixed points in matter systems\ncan persist under the impact of quantum gravity. We first focus on semi-simple\ngauge theories and show that the leading order gravity contribution evaluated\nwithin the functional Renormalization Group framework preserves the\nperturbative fixed-point structure in these models discovered in [1]. We\nhighlight that the quantum-gravity contribution alters the scaling dimension of\nthe gauge coupling, such that the system exhibits an effective dimensional\nreduction. We secondly explore the effect of metric fluctuations on\nasymptotically safe gauge-Yukawa systems which feature an asymptotically safe\nfixed point [2]. The same effective dimensional reduction that takes effect in\npure gauge theories also impacts gauge-Yukawa systems. There, it appears to\nlead to a split of the degenerate free fixed point into an interacting infrared\nattractive fixed point and a partially ultraviolet attractive free fixed point.\nThe quantum-gravity induced infrared fixed point moves towards the\nasymptotically safe fixed point of the matter system, and annihilates it at a\ncritical value of the gravity coupling. Even after that fixed-point\nannihilation, graviton effects leave behind new partially interacting fixed\npoints for the matter sector.\n", "  Hierarchical self-assembly consisting of local associations of simple\nbuilding-blocks for the formation of complex structures widely exists in\nnature, while the essential role of local assembly remains unknown. In this\nwork, by using computer simulations, we study a simple model system consisting\nof associating colloidal hemispheres crystallizing into face-centered-cubic\ncrystals comprised of spherical dimers of hemispheres, focusing on the effect\nof dimer formation on the hierarchical crystallization. We found that besides\nassisting the crystal nucleation because of increasing the symmetry of\nbuilding-blocks, the association between hemispheres can also induce both\nre-entrant melting and re-entrant crystallization depending on the range of\ninteraction. Especially when the interaction is highly sticky, we observe a\nnovel re-entrant crystallization of identical crystals, which melt only in\ncertain temperature range. This offers a new axis in fabricating responsive\ncrystalline materials by tuning the fluctuation of local association.\n", "  A search for charged Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and\ndecaying into W and Z bosons using proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV\nis presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 15.2\ninverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector in 2015 and 2016. The event\nselection requires three leptons (electrons or muons), two jets with large\npseudorapidity separation and high dijet mass, and missing transverse momentum.\nThe observation agrees with the standard model prediction. Limits on the vector\nboson fusion production cross section times branching fraction for new charged\nphysical states are reported as a function of mass from 200 to 2000 GeV and\ninterpreted in the context of Higgs triplet models.\n", "  We use three different cosmological dark matter simulations to study how the\norientation of the angular momentum vector (AM) in dark matter haloes evolve\nwith time. We find that haloes in this kind of simulations are constantly\naffected by a spurious change of mass, which translates into an artificial\nchange in the orientation of the AM. After removing the haloes affected by\nartificial mass change, we found that the change in the orientation of the AM\nvector is correlated with time. The change in its angle and direction (i.e. the\nangle subtended by the AM vector in two consecutive timesteps) that affect the\nAM vector has a dependence on the change of mass that affects a halo, the time\nelapsed in which the change of mass occurs and the halo mass. We create a\nMonte-Carlo simulation that reproduces the change of angle and direction of the\nAM vector. We reproduce the angular separation of the AM vector since a look\nback time of 8.5 Gyrs to today ( $\\rm \\alpha$) with an accuracy of\napproximately 0.05 in $\\rm cos(\\alpha)$. We are releasing this Monte-Carlo\nsimulation together with this publication. We also create a Monte Carlo\nsimulation that reproduces the change of the AM modulus. We find that haloes in\ndenser environments display the most dramatic evolution in their AM direction,\nas well as haloes with a lower specific AM modulus. These relations could be\nused to improve the way we follow the AM vector in low-resolution simulations.\n", "  We study the role of long-range interactions on the non-equilibrium dynamics\nconsidering a long-range Kitaev chain in which superconducting term decays with\ndistance between two sites in a power-law fashion characterised by an exponent\n$\\alpha$. We show that the Kibble-Zurek scaling exponent, dictating the\npower-law decay of the defect density in the final state reached following a\nslow quenching of the chemical potential ($\\mu$) across a quantum critical\npoint, depends non-trivially on the exponent $\\alpha$ as long as $\\alpha <2$;\non the other hand, for $\\alpha >2$, one finds that the exponent saturates to\nthe corresponding well-know value of $1/2$ expected for the short-range model.\nFurthermore, studying the dynamical quantum phase transitions manifested in the\nnon-analyticities in the rate function of the return possibility ($I(t)$) in\nsubsequent temporal evolution following a sudden change in $\\mu$, we show the\nexistence of a new region; in this region, we find three instants of cusp\nsingularities in $I(t)$ associated with a single sector of Fisher zeros.\nNotably, the width of this region shrinks as $\\alpha$ increases and vanishes in\nthe limit $\\alpha \\to 2$.\n", "  The weathervane modes of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the\nkagome lattice constitute possibly the earliest and certainly the most\ncelebrated example of a flat band of zero-energy excitations. Such modes arise\nfrom the underconstraint that has since become a defining criterion of strong\ngeometrical frustration. We investigate the fate of this flat band when dipolar\ninteractions are added. These change the nearest-neighbour model fundamentally\nas they remove the Heisenberg spin-rotational symmetry while also introducing a\nlong- range component to the interaction. We explain how the modes continue to\nremain approximately dispersionless, while being lifted to finite energy as\nwell as being squeezed: they change their ellipticity described by the ratio of\nthe amplitudes of the canonically conjugate variables comprising them. This\nphenomenon provides interesting connections between concepts such as constraint\ncounting and self-screening underpinning the field of frustrated magnetism. We\ndiscuss variants of these phenomena for different interactions, lattices and\ndimension.\n", "  Presently, we are facing a 3$\\sigma$ tension in the most basic cosmological\nparameter -- the Hubble constant $H_0$. This tension arises when fitting the\nLambda-cold-dark-matter model ($\\Lambda$CDM) to the high-precision\ntemperature-temperature (TT) power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) and to local cosmological observations. We propose a resolution of this\nproblem by postulating that the thermal photon gas of the CMB obeys an SU(2)\nrather than U(1) gauge principle, suggesting a high-$z$ cosmological model\nwhich is void of dark matter. Observationally, we rely on precise low-frequency\nintensity measurements in the CMB spectrum and on a recent model independent\n(low-$z$) extraction of the relation between the comoving sound horizon $r_s$\nat the end of the baryon drag epoch and $H_0$ ($r_s H_0 = \\text{const}$). We\npoint out that the commonly employed condition for baryon-velocity freeze-out\nis imprecise, judged by a careful inspection of the formal solution to the\nassociated Euler equation. As a consequence, the above mentioned 3$\\sigma$\ntension actually transforms into a 5$\\sigma$ discrepancy. To make contact with\nsuccessful low-$z$ $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology we propose an interpolation based on\npercolated/depercolated vortices of a Planck-scale axion condensate. For a\nfirst consistency test of such an all-$z$ model we compute the angular scale of\nthe sound horizon at photon decoupling.\n", "  Attenuation effect is the effect of weakening of contributions to the\noscillation signal from remote structures of matter density profile. The effect\nis a consequence of integration over the neutrino energy within the energy\nresolution interval. Structures of a density profile situated at distances\nlarger than the attenuation length, $\\lambda_{att}$, are not \"seen\". We show\nthat the origins of attenuation are (i) averaging of oscillations in certain\nlayer(s) of matter, (ii) smallness of matter effect: $\\epsilon \\equiv\n2EV/\\Delta m^2 \\ll 1$, where $V$ is the matter potential, and (iii) specific\ninitial and final states on neutrinos. We elaborate on the graphic description\nof the attenuation which allows us to compute explicitly the effects in the\n$\\epsilon^2$ order for various density profiles and oscillation channels. The\nattenuation in the case of partial averaging is described. The effect is\ncrucial for interpretation of oscillation data and for the oscillation\ntomography of the Earth with low energy (solar, supernova, atmospheric, {\\it\netc.}) neutrinos.\n", "  Recently it has been shown that the vacuum state in QED is infinitely\ndegenerate. Moreover a transition among the degenerate vacua is induced in any\nnontrivial scattering process and determined from the associated soft factor.\nConventional computations of scattering amplitudes in QED do not account for\nthis vacuum degeneracy and therefore always give zero. This vanishing of all\nconventional QED amplitudes is usually attributed to infrared divergences. Here\nwe show that if these vacuum transitions are properly accounted for, the\nresulting amplitudes are nonzero and infrared finite. Our construction of\nfinite amplitudes is mathematically equivalent to, and amounts to a physical\nreinterpretation of, the 1970 construction of Faddeev and Kulish.\n", "  The differential production cross sections of B+/- mesons are measured via\nthe exclusive decay channels B+/- to J/psi K+/- to mu+ mu- K+/- as a function\nof transverse momentum in pp and PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy\nsqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair with the CMS detector at the LHC. The\npp (PbPb) dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of 28.0 inverse picobarns (351 inverse microbarns). The measurement\nis performed in the B+/- meson transverse momentum range of 7 to 50 GeV/c, in\nthe rapidity interval abs(y) < 2.4. In this kinematic range, a strong\nsuppression of the production cross section by about a factor of two is\nobserved in the PbPb system in comparison to the expectation from pp reference\ndata. These results are found to be roughly compatible with theoretical\ncalculations incorporating beauty quark diffusion and energy loss in a\nquark-gluon plasma.\n", "  We analyze possible effects of the dark matter environment on the atomic\nclock stability measurements. The dark matter is assumed to exist in a form of\nwaves of ultralight scalar fields or in a form of topological defects\n(monopoles and strings). We identify dark matter signal signatures in clock\nAllan deviation plots that can be used to constrain the dark matter coupling to\nthe Standard Model fields. The existing data on the Al+/Hg+ clock comparison\nare used to put new limits on the dilaton dark matter in the region of masses m\n> 10^{-15} eV. We also estimate the sensitivities of future atomic clock\nexperiments in space, including the cesium microwave and strontium optical\nclocks aboard the International Space Station, as well as a potential nuclear\nclock. These experiments are expected to put new limits on the topological dark\nmatter in the range of masses 10^{-10} eV < m < 10^{-6} eV.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of some unexplored aspects of relaxed\nBose-Einstein condensate dark matter (BECDM) haloes. This type of ultralight\nbosonic scalar field dark matter is a viable alternative to the standard cold\ndark matter (CDM) paradigm, as it makes the same large-scale predictions as CDM\nand potentially overcomes CDM's small-scale problems via a galaxy-scale de\nBroglie wavelength. We simulate BECDM halo formation through mergers, evolved\nunder the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations. The formed haloes consist of a\nsoliton core supported against gravitational collapse by the quantum pressure\ntensor and an asymptotic $r^{-3}$ NFW-like profile. We find a fundamental\nrelation of the core=to-halo mass with the dimensionless invariant $\\Xi \\equiv\n\\lvert E \\rvert/M^3/(Gm/\\hbar)^2$ or $M_{\\rm c}/M \\simeq 2.6 \\Xi^{1/3}$,\nlinking the soliton to global halo properties. For $r \\geq 3.5 \\,r_{\\rm c}$\ncore radii, we find equipartition between potential, classical kinetic, and\nquantum gradient energies. The haloes also exhibit a conspicuous turbulent\nbehavior driven by the continuous reconnection of vortex lines due to wave\ninterference. We analyse the turbulence 1D velocity power spectrum and find a\n$k^{-1.1}$ power-law. This suggests the vorticity in BECDM haloes is\nhomogeneous, similar to thermally-driven counterflow BEC systems from condensed\nmatter physics, in contrast to a $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov power-law seen in\nmechanically-driven quantum systems. The mode where the power spectrum peaks is\napproximately the soliton width, implying the soliton-sized granules carry most\nof the turbulent energy in BECDM haloes.\n", "  We argue that at subgap energies quantum behavior of superconducting weak\nlinks can be exactly accounted for by an effective Hamiltonian for a Josephson\nparticle in a quantum dissipative environment formed by Andreev levels. This\nenvironment can constitute an important source for intrinsic inelastic\nrelaxation and dephasing in highly transparent weak links. We investigate the\nproblem of macroscopic quantum tunneling in such weak links demonstrating that\n-- depending on the barrier transmission -- the supercurrent decay can be\ndescribed by three different regimes: ($i$) weak intrinsic dissipation, ($ii$)\nstrong intrinsic dissipation and ($iii$) strong capacitance renormalization.\nCrossover between quantum and thermally-assisted supercurrent decay regimes can\nalso be strongly affected by the Andreev level environment.\n", "  In the simplest version of a $\\mathbf{Q}_{6}$ flavored supersymmetric model,\nwe analyze the leptonic masses and mixings in the framework of a soft breaking\nof the $\\mu \\leftrightarrow \\tau$ symmetry. This breaking is controlled by the\ninequality $m_{e\\tau}\\neq m_{e\\mu}$ in the effective neutrino mass. As a\nconsequence of this breaking, the reactor and atmospheric angle are deviate\nfrom $0^{\\circ}$ and $45^{\\circ}$, respectively. Such deviations can be\nenhanced or suppressed by the CP parities in the Majorana phases, so that an\nanalytic study is carried out to remark their importance to constrain the free\nparameters that accommodate the mixing angles. The normal hierarchy is\ncompletely discarded in this model, the inverted hierarchy is less favored than\nthe degenerate one where the reactor and atmospheric angles are in good\nagreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the model predicts defined\nregions for the effective neutrino mass decay, the neutrino mass scale and the\nsum of the neutrino mass in the inverted and degenerate mass spectrum. Thus,\nthis model may be testable by future experiments that focus in neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay.\n", "  We present measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale in\nredshift-space using the clustering of quasars. We consider a sample of 147,000\nquasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS)\ndistributed over 2044 square degrees with redshifts $0.8 < z < 2.2$ and measure\ntheir spherically-averaged clustering in both configuration and Fourier space.\nOur observational dataset and the 1400 simulated realizations of the dataset\nallow us to detect a preference for BAO that is greater than 2.8$\\sigma$. We\ndetermine the spherically averaged BAO distance to $z = 1.52$ to 3.8 per cent\nprecision: $D_V(z=1.52)=3843\\pm147 \\left(r_{\\rm d}/r_{\\rm d, fid}\\right)\\ $Mpc.\nThis is the first time the location of the BAO feature has been measured\nbetween redshifts 1 and 2. Our result is fully consistent with the prediction\nobtained by extrapolating the Planck flat $\\Lambda$CDM best-fit cosmology. All\nof our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory,\nconfirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point\nfor numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We\ncombine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to\nconstruct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and\nmarginalizing over the length of the standard ruler, we find $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}\n> 0$ at 6.6$\\sigma$ significance when testing a $\\Lambda$CDM model with free\ncurvature.\n", "  The geometry of the accretion flow in black-hole X-ray binaries in the hard\nstate, in particular the position of the disc inner edge, has been a subject of\nintense debate in recent years. We address this issue by performing a spectral\nstudy of simultaneous observations of Cyg X-1 in the hard state by NuSTAR and\nSuzaku. The same data were analysed before, and modelled by a lamppost\ncontaining hybrid electrons and located very close to the horizon, which\nemission was incident on a surrounding disc extending almost to the innermost\nstable circular orbit. We re-analyse the incident continuum model and show that\nit suffers from the lack of physical self-consistency. Still, the good fit to\nthe data provided by this model indicates that the real continuum has a similar\nshape. We find it features a strong soft X-ray excess below a few keV, which we\nmodel as a soft thermal-Comptonization component, in addition to the main hard\nthermal-Compton component. This continuum model with reflection of both\ncomponents yields the overall lowest $\\chi^2$ and has a geometry with a hot\ninner accretion flow and a disc truncated at $\\simeq$13--20 gravitational\nradii. On the other hand, we have also found spectral solution with a lamppost\nat a large height and a disc that can extend to the innnermost stable circular\norbit, though somewhat statistically worse. Overall, we find the fitted\ntruncation radius depends on the assumed continuum and geometry.\n", "  The possible emergence of compact stars has been investigated in the recently\nintroduced modified Gauss-Bonnet $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity, where\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet term and ${T}$ is the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Specifically, for this modified $f(\\mathcal{G}, T)$\ntheory, the analytic solutions of Krori and Barua have been applied to\nanisotropic matter distribution. To determine the unknown constants appearing\nin Krori and Barua metric, the well-known three models of the compact stars\nnamely 4U1820-30, Her X-I, and SAX J 1808.4-3658 have been used. The analysis\nof the physical behavior of the compact stars has been presented and the\nphysical features like energy density and pressure, energy conditions, static\nequilibrium, stability, measure of anisotropy, and regularity of the compact\nstars, have been discussed.\n", "  We explore the response of Ir $5d$ orbitals to pressure in\n$\\beta$-$\\mathrm{Li_2IrO_3}$, a hyperhoneycomb iridate in proximity to a Kitaev\nquantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals a\nreconstruction of the electronic ground state below 2 GPa, the same pressure\nrange where x-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows an apparent collapse of\nmagnetic order. The electronic reconstruction, which manifests a reduction in\nthe effective spin-orbit (SO) interaction in $5d$ orbitals, pushes\n$\\beta$-$\\mathrm{Li_2IrO_3}$ further away from the pure $J_{\\rm eff}=1/2$\nlimit. Although lattice symmetry is preserved across the electronic transition,\nx-ray diffraction shows a highly anisotropic compression of the hyperhoneycomb\nlattice which affects the balance of bond-directional Ir-Ir exchange\ninteractions driven by spin-orbit coupling at Ir sites. An enhancement of\nsymmetric anisotropic exchange over Kitaev and Heisenberg exchange interactions\nseen in theoretical calculations that use precisely this anisotropic Ir-Ir bond\ncompression provides one possible route to realization of a QSL state in this\nhyperhoneycomb iridate at high pressures.\n", "  The high-resolution echelle spectrograph UVES of the Very Large Telescope at\nCerro Paranal in Chile has been regularly operated since April 2000. Thus, UVES\narchival data originally taken for astronomical projects but also including sky\nemission can be used to study airglow variations on a time scale longer than a\nsolar cycle. Focusing on OH emission and observations until March 2015, we\nconsidered about 3,000 high-quality spectra from two instrumental set-ups\ncentred on 760 and 860 nm, which cover about 380 nm each. These data allowed us\nto measure line intensities for several OH bands in order to derive band\nintensities and rotational temperatures for different upper vibrational levels\nas a function of solar activity and observing date. The results were compared\nwith those derived from emission and temperature profile data of the radiometer\nSABER on the TIMED satellite taken in the Cerro Paranal area between 2002 and\n2015. In agreement with the SABER data, the long-term variations in OH\nintensity and temperature derived from the UVES data are dominated by the solar\ncycle, whereas secular trends appear to be negligible. Combining the UVES and\nSABER results, the solar cycle effects for the OH intensity and temperature are\nabout 12 to 17% and 4 to 5 K per 100 sfu and do not significantly depend on the\nselected OH band. The data also reveal that variations of the effective OH\nemission layer height and air density can cause significant changes in the OH\nrotational temperatures due to a varying ratio of OH thermalising collisions by\nair molecules and OH radiation, deactivation, and destruction processes which\nimpede the rotational relaxation. However, this effect appears to be of minor\nimportance for the explanation of the rotational temperature variations related\nto the solar activity cycle, which causes only small changes in the OH emission\nprofile.\n", "  High-entropy alloy (HEA) is a family of metallic materials with nearly equal\npartitions of five or more metals, which might possess mechanical and transport\nproperties that are different from conventional binary or tertiary alloys. In\nthis work, we demonstrate current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetization\nswitching in a Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti HEA-based magnetic heterostructure with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). The maximum damping-like SOT\nefficiency from this particular HEA-based magnetic heterostructure is further\ndetermined to be $|\\zeta^{\\operatorname{HEA}}_{DL}|\\approx0.033$ by hysteresis\nloop shift measurements, while that for the Ta control sample is\n$|\\zeta^{\\operatorname{Ta}}_{DL}|\\approx0.04$. Our results indicate that\nHEA-based magnetic heterostructures can serve as a new group of potential\ncandidates for SOT device applications.\n", "  In this paper we study the dependence of Bose-Einstein correlations on the\nmultiplicity of an event. We found that events with large multiplicity, stem\nfrom the production of several parton showers, while the additional production\nof small multiplicity in the central rapidity region (central diffraction),\ngives a negligible contribution due to emission of soft gluons, that leads to\nthe Sudakov suppression of the exclusive production of two gluon jets. Hence,\nthe Bose-Einstein correlation is the main source of the azimuthal angle\ncorrelations which generates $v_n$ with odd and even $n$.\n  We found, that without this suppression, the measurement of an event with\ngiven multipilicity, yields $v_{n,n} < 0$ for odd $n$. It appears that in\nhadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, the Bose-Einstein correlations\ndo not depend on multiplicity, while for hadron-hadron scattering, such\ndependence can be considerable. We proposed a simple Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (KLN)\ntype model, to describe the dependence of azimuthal angle correlations on the\ncentrality of the event, in ion-ion collisions.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength observations and modeling of the exceptionally\nbright long $\\gamma$-ray burst GRB 160625B. The optical and X-ray data are\nwell-fit by synchrotron emission from a collimated blastwave with an opening\nangle of $\\theta_j\\approx 3.6^\\circ$ and kinetic energy of $E_K\\approx\n2\\times10^{51}$ erg, propagating into a low density ($n\\approx 5\\times10^{-5}$\ncm$^{-3}$) medium with a uniform profile. The forward shock is sub-dominant in\nthe radio band; instead, the radio emission is dominated by two additional\ncomponents. The first component is consistent with emission from a reverse\nshock, indicating an initial Lorentz factor of $\\Gamma_0\\gtrsim 100$ and an\nejecta magnetization of $R_B\\approx 1-100$. The second component exhibits\npeculiar spectral and temporal evolution and is most likely the result of\nscattering of the radio emission by the turbulent Milky Way interstellar medium\n(ISM). Such scattering is expected in any sufficiently compact extragalactic\nsource and has been seen in GRBs before, but the large amplitude and long\nduration of the variability seen here are qualitatively more similar to extreme\nscattering events previously observed in quasars, rather than normal\ninterstellar scintillation effects. High-cadence, broadband radio observations\nof future GRBs are needed to fully characterize such effects, which can\nsensitively probe the properties of the ISM and must be taken into account\nbefore variability intrinsic to the GRB can be interpreted correctly.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed comparison of the dijet production by\nphoton -- photon, photon -- pomeron and pomeron -- pomeron interactions in\n$pp$, $pA$ and ${\\rm AA}$ collisions at the LHC energy. The transverse\nmomentum, pseudo -- rapidity and angular dependencies of the cross sections are\ncalculated at LHC energy using the Forward Physics Monte Carlo (FPMC), which\nallows to obtain realistic predictions for the dijet production with two\nleading intact hadrons. We obtain that $\\gamma \\pom$ channel is dominant at\nforward rapidities in $pp$ collisions and in the full kinematical range in the\nnuclear collisions of heavy nuclei. Our results indicate that the analysis of\ndijet production at the LHC can be useful to test the Resolved Pomeron model as\nwell as to constrain the magnitude of the absorption effects.\n", "  We propose a model for the mechanical behavior of protein materials. Based on\na limited number of experimental macromolecular parameters (persistence and\ncontour lengths, rate of unfolding dissipation) we obtain the macroscopic\nbehavior of keratin fibers (human, cow, and rabbit hair), taking into account\nthe damage and residual stretches effects which are fundamental in many\nfunctions of life. We support our theoretical results by showing that our model\nis robust and able to reproduce with high quantitive accuracy the cyclic\nexperimental behavior of different keratinous protein materials we tested. We\nalso show the capability of describing, even if with lower precision, the\ndissipation and permanent strain effects in spider silks.\n", "  We present the calculation of dijet production, doubly-differential in dijet\nmass, $m_{jj}$ and rapidity difference, $|y^{*}|$, at leading colour in all\npartonic channels at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD.\nWe consider the long-standing problems associated with scale choice for dijet\nproduction at next-to-leading order (NLO) and investigate the impact of\nincluding the NNLO contribution. We find that the NNLO theory provides reliable\npredictions, even when using scale choices which display pathological behaviour\nat NLO. We choose the dijet invariant mass as the theoretical scale on the\ngrounds of perturbative convergence and residual scale variation and compare\nthe predictions to the ATLAS 7 TeV 4.5 fb$^{-1}$ data.\n", "  We analyze perturbative dynamics of a composite system consisting of a\nquantum mechanical system and an environment by the renormalization group (RG)\nmethod. The solution obtained from the RG method has no secular terms and\napproximates the exact solution for a long time interval. Moreover, the RG\nmethod causes a reduction of the dynamics of the composite system under some\nassumptions. We show that this reduced dynamics is closely related to a quantum\nmaster equation for the quantum mechanical system. Then, we compare this\ndynamics with the exact dynamics in an exactly solvable spin-boson model.\n", "  We investigate the stability of the many-body localized (MBL) phase for a\nsystem in contact with a single ergodic grain, modelling a Griffiths region\nwith low disorder. Our numerical analysis provides evidence that even a small\nergodic grain consisting of only 3 qubits can delocalize a localized chain, as\nsoon as the localization length exceeds a critical value separating localized\nand extended regimes of the whole system. We present a simple theory,\nconsistent with the arguments in [Phys. Rev. B 95, 155129 (2017)], that assumes\na system to be locally ergodic unless the local relaxation time, determined by\nFermi's Golden Rule, is larger than the inverse level spacing. This theory\npredicts a critical value for the localization length that is perfectly\nconsistent with our numerical calculations. We analyze in detail the behavior\nof local operators inside and outside the ergodic grain, and find excellent\nagreement of numerics and theory.\n", "  Topological Weyl semimetal (TWS) is a metal, where low energy excitations\nbehave like Weyl fermions of high-energy physics. It was recently shown that\ndue to the lower symmetry of condensed matter systems, they can realize two\ndistinct types of Weyl fermions. The type-I Weyl fermion in a metal is formed\nby a linear crossing of two bands at a point in the crystalline momentum space\n- Brillouin zone (BZ). The second type TWSs host type-II Weyl points appearing\nat the touching points of electron and hole pockets, which is a result of\ntilted linear dispersion. The type-II TWS was predicted to exist in several\ncompounds, including WTe$_2$. Several ARPES studies of WTe$_2$ were reported so\nfar, having contradictory conclusions on the topological nature of observed\nFermi arcs. In this work, we report the results of spectroscopic imaging with a\nscanning tunneling microscope and first principle calculations, establishing a\nclear quasiparticle interference features of the surface states of WTe$_2$. Our\nwork provides a strong evidence for surface state scattering. Although the\nsurface Fermi arcs are clearly observed, it is still difficult to prove the\nexistence of predicted Type-II Weyl points in the bulk.\n", "  Annual modulation of $\\gamma$ rays from ($\\alpha$, $\\gamma$) reactions in the\nSoudan Underground Lab has been observed using a 12-liter scintillation\ndetector. This significant annual modulation, measured over 4 years, can mimic\nthe signature for dark matter and can also generate potential background events\nfor neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay experiments. The measured annual\nmodulation of the event rate from ($\\alpha$, $\\gamma$) reactions is strongly\ncorrelated with the time-varying radon concentration observed independently in\nthe Lab. The $\\alpha$ flux from radon decay is simulated starting from the\nmeasured radon concentration, and the $\\gamma$-ray flux is determined using the\nconvolution of the $\\alpha$ flux and the cross sections for ($\\alpha$,\n$\\gamma$) reactions. The calculated $\\gamma$-ray flux is sufficient to generate\nthe measured event rate that exhibits an annual modulation.\n", "  We make use of numerical exact diagonalization calculations to explore the\nphysics of $\\nu = 1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) droplets in the\npresence of experimentally realistic cylindrically symmetric hard-wall\npotentials. This kind of confinement is found to produce very different\nmany-body spectra compared to a harmonic trap or the so-called extremely steep\nlimit. For a relatively weak confinement, the degeneracies are lifted and the\nlow-lying excited states organize themselves in energy branches that can be\nexplained in terms of their Jack polynomial representation. For a strong\nconfinement, a strong spatial deformation of the droplet is found, with an\nunexpected depletion of its central density.\n", "  Monitoring structural changes in ferroelectric thin films during electric\nfield-induced polarization switching is important for a full microscopic\nunderstanding of the coupled motion of charges, atoms and domain walls. We\ncombine standard ferroelectric test-cycles with time-resolved x-ray diffraction\nto investigate the response of a nanoscale ferroelectric oxide capacitor upon\ncharging, discharging and switching. Piezoelectric strain develops during the\nelectronic RC time constant and additionally during structural domain-wall\ncreep. The complex atomic motion during ferroelectric polarization reversal\nstarts with a negative piezoelectric response to the charge flow triggered by\nvoltage pulses. Incomplete screening limits the compressive strain. The\npiezoelectric modulation of the unit cell tweaks the energy barrier between the\ntwo polarization states. Domain wall motion is evidenced by a broadening of the\nin-plane components of Bragg reflections. Such simultaneous measurements on a\nworking device elucidate and visualize the complex interplay of charge flow and\nstructural motion and challenges theoretical modelling.\n", "  Due to the nonlinear dielectric response within SrTiO$_{3}$ (STO), an\naccumulation layer created by positive charges at the surface of the STO sample\n($x=0$) has an electron density profile $n(x)$ that slowly decays as\n$1/x^{12/7}$. Here we show that the long tail of $n(x)$ causes the\nmagnetization and the specific heat of the accumulation layer to diverge at\nlarge $x$. We explore the truncation of the tail by the finite sample width\n$W$, the transition from the nonlinear to linear dielectric response with\ndielectric constant $\\kappa$, and the use of a back gate with a negative\nvoltage $-|V|$. We find that both the magnetization and specific heat are\nanomalously large and obey nontrivial power law dependences on $W$, $\\kappa$,\nor $|V|$. We conclude with a discussion of how the capacitance as a function of\nthe back gate voltage may be used to study the shape of the $n(x)$ tail in thin\nsamples.\n", "  Within the context of the extended bi-spinor gauge theory we describe a new\noff-shell realization of scalar supersymmetry (s-susy) of massless interacting\nfields with U(1), U(1) x SU(N) and U(1) x SU(N_1) x SU(N_2) gauge groups.\nS-susy acts in the space of graded differential forms. The realization is\nnon-linear in the non-abelian case. S-susy would not require the doubling of\nthe SM particle spectrum. Instead, essentially only the forth generation of\nquarks and leptons would be needed as extra field content. The theory is by\nconstruction globally U(2,2) invariant and is an example of a supersymmetric\nCFT.\n", "  In this paper we study a numerical implementation for the initial boundary\nvalue formulation for the generalized conformal field equations. We propose a\nformulation which is well suited for the study of the long-time behaviour of\nperturbed exact solutions such as a Schwarzschild or even a Kerr black hole. We\ndescribe the derivation of the implemented equations which we give in terms of\nthe space-spinor formalism. We discuss the conformal Gauss gauge, and a slight\ngeneralization thereof which seems to be particularly useful in the presence of\nboundaries. We discuss the structure of the equations at the boundary and\npropose a method for imposing boundary conditions which allow the correct\nnumber of degrees of freedom to be freely specified while still preserving the\nconstraints. We show that this implementation yields a numerically well-posed\nsystem by testing it on a simple case of gravitational perturbations of\nMinkowski space-time and subsequently with gravitational perturbations of\nSchwarzschild space-time.\n", "  The mechanism of diffusing diffusivity predicts that, in environments where\nthe diffusivity changes gradually, the displacement distribution becomes\nnon-Gaussian, even though the mean-squared displacement (MSD) grows linearly\nwith time. Here, we report single-particle tracking measurements of the\ndiffusion of colloidal spheres near a planar substrate. Because the local\neffective diffusivity is known, we have been able to carry out the first direct\ntest of this mechanism for diffusion in inhomogeneous media.\n", "  In this work we revisit the MIT bag model to describe quark matter within\nboth the usual Fermi-Dirac and the Tsallis statistics. We verify the effects of\nthe non-additivity of the latter by analysing two different pictures: the first\norder phase transition of the QCD phase diagram and stellar matter properties.\nWhile, the QCD phase diagram is visually affected by the Tsallis statistics,\nthe resulting effects on quark star macroscopic properties are barely noticed.\n", "  A hydrodynamic theory of screening in a generic electron gas of arbitrary\ndimensionality is given that encompasses all previously studied cases and\nclarifies the predictions of the many-body approach. We find that\nlong-wavelength plasma oscillations are classical phenomena with\nquantum-mechanical effects playing no explicit role. The character of the\noscillations is solely dictated by the dimensionality of the electron system\nand its equation of state in the neutral limit. Materials whose excitations are\ndescribed by the Dirac dispersion law -- such as doped graphene or a Weyl\nsemimetal -- are no exception to this rule.\n", "  We study flat bands in bipartite tight-binding networks with discrete\ntranslational invariance. Chiral flat bands with chiral symmetry eigenenergy E\n= 0 and host compact localized eigenstates for finite range hopping. For a\nbipartite network with a majority sublattice chiral flat bands emerge. We\npresent a simple generating principle of chiral flat band networks and as a\nshowcase add to the previously observed cases a number of new potentially\nrealizable chiral flat bands in various lattice dimensions. Chiral symmetry\nrespecting network perturbations - including disorder and synthetic magnetic\nfields - preserve both the flatband and the modified compact localized states.\nChiral flatbands are spectrally protected by gaps, and pseudogaps in the\npresence of disorder due to Griffiths effects.\n", "  We present a new model for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies and\ndemonstrate its accuracy in modeling the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole\nof the galaxy density field down to scales of $k = 0.4 \\ h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.\nThe model describes the clustering of galaxies in the context of a halo model\nand the clustering of the underlying halos in redshift space using a\ncombination of Eulerian perturbation theory and $N$-body simulations. The\nmodeling of redshift-space distortions is done using the so-called distribution\nfunction approach. The final model has 13 free parameters, and each parameter\nis physically motivated rather than a nuisance parameter, which allows the use\nof well-motivated priors. We account for the Finger-of-God effect from centrals\nand both isolated and non-isolated satellites rather than using a single\nvelocity dispersion to describe the combined effect. We test and validate the\naccuracy of the model on several sets of high-fidelity $N$-body simulations, as\nwell as realistic mock catalogs designed to simulate the BOSS DR12 CMASS data\nset. The suite of simulations covers a range of cosmologies and galaxy bias\nmodels, providing a rigorous test of the level of theoretical systematics\npresent in the model. The level of bias in the recovered values of $f \\sigma_8$\nis found to be small. When including scales to $k = 0.4 \\ h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,\nwe find 15-30\\% gains in the statistical precision of $f \\sigma_8$ relative to\n$k = 0.2 \\ h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and a roughly 10-15\\% improvement for the\nperpendicular Alcock-Paczynski parameter $\\alpha_\\perp$. Using the BOSS DR12\nCMASS mocks as a benchmark for comparison, we estimate an uncertainty on $f\n\\sigma_8$ that is $\\sim$10-20\\% larger than other similar Fourier-space RSD\nmodels in the literature that use $k \\leq 0.2 \\ h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, suggesting\nthat these models likely have a too-limited parametrization.\n", "  All pieces of concrete evidence for phenomena outside the standard model (SM)\n- neutrino masses and dark matter - are consistent with the existence of new\ndegrees of freedom that interact very weakly, if at all, with those in the SM.\nWe propose that these new degrees of freedom organize themselves into a simple\ndark sector, a chiral SU(3) x SU(2) gauge theory with the smallest nontrivial\nfermion content. Similar to the SM, the dark SU(2) is spontaneously broken\nwhile the dark SU(3) confines at low energies. At the renormalizable level, the\ndark sector contains massless fermions - dark leptons - and stable massive\nparticles - dark protons. We find that dark protons with masses between 10-100\nTeV satisfy all current cosmological and astrophysical observations concerning\ndark matter even if dark protons are a symmetric thermal relic. The dark\nleptons play the role of right-handed neutrinos and allow simple realizations\nof the seesaw mechanism or the possibility that neutrinos are Dirac fermions.\nIn the latter case, neutrino masses are also parametrically different from\ncharged-fermion masses and the lightest neutrino is predicted to be massless.\nSince the new \"neutrino\" and \"dark matter\" degrees of freedom interact with one\nanother, these two new-physics phenomena are intertwined. Dark leptons play a\nnontrivial role in early universe cosmology while indirect searches for dark\nmatter involve, decisively, dark matter annihilations into dark leptons. These,\nin turn, may lead to observable signatures at high-energy neutrino and\ngamma-ray observatories, especially once one accounts for the potential\nSommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross-section, derived from the\nlow-energy dark-sector effective theory, a possibility we explore\nquantitatively in some detail.\n", "  We report on THz, infrared reflectivity and transmission experiments for wave\nnumbers from 10 to 8000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\sim$ 1 meV - 1 eV) and for temperatures\nfrom 5 to 295 K on the Kitaev candidate material {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$. As reported\nearlier, the compound under investigation passes through a first-order\nstructural phase transition, from a monoclinic high-temperature to a\nrhombohedral low-temperature phase. The phase transition shows an extreme and\nunusual hysteretic behavior, which extends from 60 to 166 K. In passing this\nphase transition, in the complete frequency range investigated we found a\nsignificant reflectance change, which amounts almost a factor of two. We\nprovide a broadband spectrum of dielectric constant, dielectric loss and\noptical conductivity from the THz to the mid infrared regime and study in\ndetail the phonon response and the low-lying electronic density of states. We\nprovide evidence for the onset of an optical energy gap, which is of order 200\nmeV, in good agreement with the gap derived from measurements of the DC\nelectrical resistivity. Remarkably, the onset of the gap exhibits a strong blue\nshift on increasing temperatures.\n", "  Parity- and time-reversal-symmetry violating interaction constants required\nfor the interpretation of a recent measurement (arXiv:1704.07928\n[physics.atom-ph]) of corresponding symmetry violations in the $\\Omega=1$\n(${^3\\Delta}_1$) science state of the HfF$^+$ molecular ion are reported. Using\na relativistic four-component all-electron multi-reference configuration\ninteraction model the nucleon-electron scalar-pseudoscalar interaction constant\nis determined as $W_S = 20.0$ [kHz]. An updated result for the electron\nelectric-dipole-moment effective electric field of $|E_{\\text{eff}}| = 22.7\n\\left[\\frac{\\rm GV}{\\rm cm}\\right]$ is obtained. Further results of relevance\nin the context of the search for leptonic charge-parity violation such as\nmagnetic hyperfine interaction constants and electronic $G$-tensor for HfF$^+$\nare presented.\n", "  In this work we present a newly constructed equation of state (EoS)\n--applicable to stellar core collapse and neutron star mergers--, including the\nentire baryon octet. Our EoS is compatible with the main constraints from\nnuclear physics and, in particular, with a maximum mass for cold\nbeta-equilibrated neutron stars of 2 solar masses in agreement with recent\nobservations. As an application of our new EoS, we compute numerical stationary\nmodels for rapidly (rigidly) rotating hot neutron stars. We consider maximum\nmasses of hot stars, such as proto-neutron stars or hypermassive neutron stars\nin the post-merger phase of binary neutron star coalescence. The universality\nof I-Q-relations at nonzero temperature for fast rotating models, comparing a\npurely nuclear EoS with its counterparts containing Lambda-hyperons or the\nentire baryon octet, respectively, is discussed, too. We find that the I-Q\nuniversality is broken when thermal effects become important, whatever the\nvalue of entropy gradients in our models. Thus, the use of I-Q relations for\nthe analysis of proto-neutron stars or merger remnant data, including\ngravitational wave signals from the last stages of binary neutron star mergers,\nshould be regarded with care.\n", "  We present real-time inchworm quantum Monte Carlo results for single-site\ndynamical mean field theory on an infinite coordination number Bethe lattice.\nOur numerically exact results are obtained on the L-shaped Keldysh contour and,\nbeing evaluated in real-time, avoid the analytic continuation issues typically\nencountered in Monte Carlo calculations. Our results show that inchworm Monte\nCarlo methods have now reached a state where they can be used as dynamical mean\nfield impurity solvers and the dynamical sign problem can be overcome. As\nnon-equilibrium problems can be simulated at the same cost, we envisage the\nmain use of these methods as dynamical mean field solvers for time-dependent\nproblems far from equilibrium.\n", "  We show the peak magnitude for orphan afterglows from the jets of\ngravitational wave (GW) detected black-hole/neutron star - neutron star\n(BH/NS-NS) mergers highly depends on the jet half-opening angle $\\theta_j$.\nShort $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB) with a homogeneous jet structure and\n$\\theta_j>10^\\circ$, the orphan afterglow viewed at the typical inclination for\na GW detected event, 38$^\\circ$, is brighter at optical frequencies than the\ncomparable macronova emission. Structured jets, where the energetics and\nLorentz factor $\\Gamma$ vary with angle from the central axis, may have\nlow-$\\Gamma$ components where the prompt emission is suppressed; GW\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts may reveal a population of failed-GRB orphan\nafterglows. Using a Monte Carlo method assuming a NS-NS detection limit we show\nthe fraction of GW-EM counterparts from homogeneous, two-component, power-law\nstructured, and Gaussian jets where the variable structure models include a\nwide low energy and $\\Gamma$ component: for homogeneous jets, with a\n{$\\theta_j=6^\\circ$ and typical short GRB parameters, we find {\\it r}-band\nmagnitude $m_r\\leq21$ counterparts for $\\sim 13.6\\%$ of GW detected mergers;\nwhere jet structure extends to a half-opening angle of $25^\\circ$,\ntwo-component jets produce $m_r\\leq21$ counterparts in $\\sim30\\%$ of GW\ndetected mergers; power-law structured jets result in $\\sim37\\%$; and Gaussian\njets with our parameters $\\sim13\\%$.} We show the features in the lightcurves\nfrom orphan afterglows can be used to indicate the presence of extended\nstructure.\n", "  Quantum tomography is a critically important tool to evaluate quantum\nhardware, making it essential to develop optimized measurement strategies that\nare both accurate and efficient. We compare a variety of strategies using\nnearly pure test states. Those that are informationally complete for all states\nare found to be accurate and reliable even in the presence of errors in the\nmeasurements themselves, while those designed to be complete only for pure\nstates are far more efficient but highly sensitive to such errors. Our results\nhighlight the unavoidable tradeoffs inherent to quantum tomography.\n", "  Axions arise in many theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of particle\nphysics, in particular the \"string axiverse\". If the axion masses, $m_a$, and\n(effective) decay constants, $f_a$, lie in specific ranges, then axions\ncontribute to the cosmological dark matter and dark energy densities. We\ncompute the background cosmological (quasi-)observables for models with a large\nnumber of axion fields, $n_{\\rm ax}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10-100)$, with the masses\nand decay constants drawn from statistical distributions. This reduces the\nnumber of parameters from $2n_{\\rm ax}$ to a small number of \"hyperparameters\".\nWe consider a number of distributions, from those motivated purely by\nstatistical considerations, to those where the structure is specified according\nto a class of M-theory models. Using Bayesian methods we are able to constrain\nthe hyperparameters of the distributions. In some cases the hyperparameters can\nbe related to string theory, e.g. constraining the number ratio of axions to\nmoduli, or the typical decay constant scale needed to provide the correct relic\ndensities. Our methodology incorporates the use of both random matrix theory\nand Bayesian networks.\n", "  Context. Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) have been frequently observed during\nthe gradual phase of solar flares near the limb. In coronal emission lines\nsensitive to flaring plasmas, they appear as tadpole-like dark voids against\nthe diffuse fan-shaped \"haze\" above, flowing toward the well-defined flare\narcade.\n  Aims. We aim to investigate the evolution of SADs' thermal properties, and to\nshed light on the formation mechanism and physical processes of SADs.\n  Methods. We carefully studied several selected SADs from two flare events and\ncalculated their differential emission measures (DEMs) as well as DEM-weighted\ntemperatures using data obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\nonboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that SADs are associated with a substantial\ndecrease in DEM above 4 MK, which is 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the\nsurrounding haze as well as the region before or after the passage of SADs, but\ncomparable to the quiet corona. There is no evidence for the presence of the\nSAD-associated hot plasma (> 20 MK) in the AIA data, and this decrease in DEM\ndoes not cause any significant change in the DEM distribution as well as the\nDEM-weighted temperature, which supports this idea that SADs are density\ndepletion. This depression in DEM rapidly recovers in the wake of the SADs\nstudied, generally within a few minutes, suggesting that they are discrete\nfeatures. In addition, we found that SADs in one event are spatio-temporally\nassociated with the successive formation of post-flare loops along the flare\narcade.\n", "  We consider the ${\\mathcal O}(1/m)$ and the spin-independent\nmomentum-dependent ${\\mathcal O}(1/m^2)$ quasi-static energies of heavy\nquarkonium (with unequal masses). They are defined nonperturbatively in terms\nof Wilson loops. We determine their short-distance behavior through ${\\mathcal\nO}(\\alpha^3)$ and ${\\mathcal O}(\\alpha^2)$, respectively. In particular, we\ncalculate the ultrasoft contributions to the quasi-static energies, which\nrequires the resummation of potential interactions. Our results can be directly\ncompared to lattice simulations. In addition, we also compare the available\nlattice data with the expectations from effective string models for the\nlong-distance behavior of the quasi-static energies.\n", "  Non-zero-range interactions are often incorporated into mean field theories\nthrough gradient terms. Here, a formalism is developed to incorporate such\nterms into hydrodynamics. These terms alter expressions for the entropy,\nchemical potential, temperature and the stress-energy tensor. The formalism\nrespects local conservation of energy, charge and entropy. The formalism leads\nto static solutions where the temperature, chemical potential and hydrodynamic\nacceleration all vanish, even when the density profile might be non-uniform.\nProfiles for a phase boundary and for correlation functions are calculated to\nillustrate the gradient modifications for various thermodynamic quantities.\nAlso, for hydrodynamic calculations that add thermal noise to generate\ndensity-density correlations of the desired strength, an additional noise term\nis derived so that, at equilibrium, correlations are generated with both the\ncorrect size and length scale.\n", "  We study BPS bound states of little strings in a limit where they realise\nmonopole strings in five dimensional gauge theories. The latter have gauge\ngroup $U(M)^N$ and arise from compactification of $(1,0)$ little string\ntheories of type $A_{M-1} \\times A_{N-1}$. We find evidence that the partition\nfunction of a certain subclass of monopole strings of charge $(k,\\ldots,k)$\n($k\\geq 1$) is expressible as the partition function of a symmetric orbifold\nsigma model, whose target space is precisely the symmetric product of the\nmoduli space of monopoles with charge $(1, \\ldots, 1)$.\n", "  Comprehending complex systems by simplifying and highlighting important\ndynamical patterns requires modeling and mapping higher-order network flows.\nHowever, complex systems come in many forms and demand a range of\nrepresentations, including memory and multilayer networks, which in turn call\nfor versatile community-detection algorithms to reveal important modular\nregularities in the flows. Here we show that various forms of higher-order\nnetwork flows can be represented in a unified way with networks that\ndistinguish physical nodes for representing a~complex system's objects from\nstate nodes for describing flows between the objects. Moreover, these so-called\nsparse memory networks allow the information-theoretic community detection\nmethod known as the map equation to identify overlapping and nested flow\nmodules in data from a range of~different higher-order interactions such as\nmultistep, multi-source, and temporal data. We derive the map equation applied\nto sparse memory networks and describe its search algorithm Infomap, which can\nexploit the flexibility of sparse memory networks. Together they provide a\ngeneral solution to reveal overlapping modular patterns in higher-order flows\nthrough complex systems.\n", "  Most derivations of acoustic wave equations involve ensuring that causality\nis satisfied. Here we explore the consequences of also requiring that the\nmedium should be passive. This is a stricter criterion than causality for a\nlinear system and implies that there are restrictions on the relaxation modulus\nand its first few derivatives. The viscous and relaxation models of acoustics\nsatisfy passivity and have restrictions on not only a few, but all derivatives\nof the relaxation modulus. This is the important class of completely monotone\nsystems. It is the only class where the medium is modeled as a system of\nsprings and dampers with positive parameters. It is shown here that the\nattenuation as a function of frequency for such media has to increase slower\nthan a linear function. Likewise the phase velocity has to increase\nmonotonically. This gives criteria on which one may judge whether a proposed\nwave equation is passive or not, as illustrated by comparing two different\nversions of the viscous wave equation.\n", "  We study the two-photon laser excitation to the 5D$_{5/2}$ energy level of\n$^{85}$Rb atoms contained in the interstices of a porous material made from\nsintered ground glass with typical pore dimensions in the 10 - 100 $\\mu$m\nrange. The excitation spectra show unusual flat-top lineshapes which are shown\nto be the consequence of wave-vector randomization of the laser light in the\nporous material. For large atomic densities, the spectra are affected by\nradiation trapping around the D2 transitions. The effect of the transient\natomic response limited by time of flight between pores walls appears to have a\nminor influence in the excitation spectra. It is however revealed by the\nshortening of the temporal evolution of the emitted blue light following a\nsudden switch-off of the laser excitation.\n", "  The construction of topological error correction codes requires the ability\nto fabricate a lattice of physical qubits embedded on a manifold with a\nnon-trivial topology such that the quantum information is encoded in the global\ndegrees of freedom (i.e. the topology) of the manifold. However, the\nmanufacturing of large-scale topological devices will undoubtedly suffer from\nfabrication errors---permanent faulty components such as missing physical\nqubits or failed entangling gates---introducing permanent defects into the\ntopology of the lattice and hence significantly reducing the distance of the\ncode and the quality of the encoded logical qubits. In this work we investigate\nhow fabrication errors affect the performance of topological codes, using the\nsurface code as the testbed. A known approach to mitigate defective lattices\ninvolves the use of primitive SWAP gates in a long sequence of syndrome\nextraction circuits. Instead, we show that in the presence of fabrication\nerrors the syndrome can be determined using the supercheck operator approach\nand the outcome of the defective gauge stabilizer generators without any\nadditional computational overhead or the use of SWAP gates. We report numerical\nfault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both qubit fabrication and gate\nfabrication errors using a circuit-based noise model and the minimum-weight\nperfect matching decoder. Our numerical analysis is most applicable to 2D\nchip-based technologies, but the techniques presented here can be readily\nextended to other topological architectures. We find that in the presence of 8%\nqubit fabrication errors, the surface code can still tolerate a computational\nerror rate of up to 0.1%.\n", "  We advocate the use of on-shell constrained $M_2$ variables in order to\nmitigate the combinatorial problem in SUSY-like events with two invisible\nparticles at the LHC. We show that in comparison to other approaches in the\nliterature, the constrained $M_2$ variables provide superior ansatze for the\nunmeasured invisible momenta and therefore can be usefully applied to\ndiscriminate combinatorial ambiguities. We illustrate our procedure with the\nexample of dilepton $t\\bar{t}$ events. We critically review the existing\nmethods based on the Cambridge $M_{T2}$ variable and MAOS-reconstruction of\ninvisible momenta, and show that their algorithm can be simplified without loss\nof sensitivity, due to a perfect correlation between events with complex\nsolutions for the invisible momenta and events exhibiting a kinematic endpoint\nviolation. Then we demonstrate that the efficiency for selecting the correct\npartition is further improved by utilizing the $M_2$ variables instead.\nFinally, we also consider the general case when the underlying mass spectrum is\nunknown, and no kinematic endpoint information is available.\n", "  Pseudorapidity and azimuthal three-particle correlations are studied based on\na correlated-cluster model of multiparticle production. The model provides a\ncommon framework for correlations in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions\nallowing easy comparison with the measurements. It is shown that azimuthal\ncluster correlations are definitely required in order to understand\nthree-particle correlations in the near-side ridge effect. This is similar to\nthe explanation of the ridge phenomenon found in our previous analysis of\ntwo-particle correlations and generalizes the model to higher-order\ncorrelations.\n", "  We use a suite of high-resolution cosmological dwarf galaxy simulations to\ntest the accuracy of commonly-used mass estimators from Walker et al.(2009) and\nWolf et al.(2010), both of which depend on the observed line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion and the 2D half-light radius of the galaxy, $Re$. The simulations\nare part of the the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project and\ninclude twelve systems with stellar masses spanning $10^{5} - 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$\nthat have structural and kinematic properties similar to those of observed\ndispersion-supported dwarfs. Both estimators are found to be quite accurate:\n$M_{Wolf}/M_{true} = 0.98^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$ and $M_{Walker}/M_{true}\n=1.07^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, with errors reflecting the 68% range over all\nsimulations. The excellent performance of these estimators is remarkable given\nthat they each assume spherical symmetry, a supposition that is broken in our\nsimulated galaxies. Though our dwarfs have negligible rotation support, their\n3D stellar distributions are flattened, with short-to-long axis ratios $ c/a\n\\simeq 0.4-0.7$. The accuracy of the estimators shows no trend with\nasphericity. Our simulated galaxies have sphericalized stellar profiles in 3D\nthat follow a nearly universal form, one that transitions from a core at small\nradius to a steep fall-off $\\propto r^{-4.2}$ at large $r$, they are well fit\nby S\\'ersic profiles in projection. We find that the most important empirical\nquantity affecting mass estimator accuracy is $Re$ . Determining $Re$ by an\nanalytic fit to the surface density profile produces a better estimated mass\nthan if the half-light radius is determined via direct summation.\n", "  We argue that outward transport of energy by convection and photon diffusion\nin a common envelope evolution (CEE) of giant stars substantially reduces the\nfraction of the recombination energy of hydrogen and helium that is available\nfor envelope removal. We base our estimate on the properties of an unperturbed\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) spherical model, and on some simple arguments.\nSince during the CEE the envelope expands and energy removal by photon\ndiffusion becomes more efficient, our arguments underestimate the escape of\nrecombination energy. We hence strengthen earlier claims that recombination\nenergy does not contribute much to common envelope removal. A large fraction of\nthe energy that jets deposit to the envelope, on the other hand, might be in\nthe form of kinetic energy of the expanding and buoyantly rising hot bubbles.\nThese rapidly rising bubbles remove mass from the envelope. We demonstrate this\nprocess by conducting a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation where we\ndeposit hot gas in the location of a secondary star that orbits inside the\nenvelope of a giant star. Despite the fact that we do not include the large\namount of gravitational energy that is released by the in-spiraling secondary\nstar, the hot bubbles alone remove mass at a rate of about 0.1 Mo/yr, which is\nmuch above the regular mass loss rate.\n", "  We show for a simple non-collinear configuration of the atomistic spins (in\nparticular, where one spin is rotated by a finite angle in a ferromagnetic\nbackground) that the pairwise energy variation computed in terms of multiple\nscattering formalism cannot be fully mapped onto a bilinear Heisen- berg spin\nmodel even in the lack of spin-orbit coupling. The non-Heisenberg terms induced\nby the spin-polarized host appear in leading orders in the expansion of the\ninfinitesimal angle variations. However, an Eg-T2g symmetry analysis based on\nthe orbital decomposition of the exchange param- eters in bcc Fe leads to the\nconclusion that the nearest neighbor exchange parameters related to the T2g\norbitals are essentially Heisenberg-like: they do not depend on the spin\nconfiguration, and can in this case be mapped onto a Heisenberg spin model even\nin extreme non-collinear cases.\n", "  The LHCb collaboration has recently reported a 2.5 $\\sigma$ discrepancy with\nrespect to the predicted value in a test of lepton universality in the ratio\n$R_{K^*}= \\hbox{BR}(B \\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-) / \\hbox{BR}(B \\to K^* e^+ e^-)$.\nCoupled with an earlier observation of a similar anomaly in $R_{K}$, this has\ngenerated significant excitement. A number of new physics scenarios have been\nproposed to explain the anomaly. In this work we consider simplified limits on\n$Z'$ models from ATLAS and CMS searches for new resonances in dilepton and\ndijet modes, and we use the simplified limits variable $\\zeta$ to correlate the\nresults of the resonance and B-decay experiments. By examining minimal $Z'$\nmodels that can accomodate the observed LHCb results, we show that the\nhigh-mass resonance search results are begining to be sensitive to these models\nand that future results will be more informative.\n", "  Interacting galaxies surrounded by HI tidal debris are ideal sites for the\nstudy of young clusters and tidal galaxy formation. The process that triggers\nstar formation in the low-density environments outside galaxies is still an\nopen question. New clusters and galaxies of tidal origin are expected to have\nhigh metallicities for their luminosities. Spectroscopy of such objects is,\nhowever, at the limit of what can be done with existing 8-10m class telescopes,\nwhich has prevented statistical studies of these objects. NGC2865 is an\nUV-bright merging elliptical galaxy with shells and extended HI tails. The\nregions observed in this work were previously detected using multi-slit imaging\nspectroscopy. We obtain new multislit spectroscopy of six young star-forming\nregions around NGC2865, to determine their redshifts and metallicities. The six\nemission-line regions are located 16-40 kpc from NGC2865 and they have similar\nredshifts. They have ages of ~10Myears and an average metallicity of\n12+log(O/H) ~ 8.6, suggesting a tidal origin for the regions. It is noted that\nthey coincide with an extended HI tail, which has projected density of N$_{HI}$\n< 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, and displays a low surface brightness counterpart. These\nregions may represent the youngest of the three populations of star clusters\nalready identified in NGC2865. The high, nearly-solar, oxygen abundances found\nfor the six regions in the vicinity of NGC2865 suggest that they were formed by\npre-enriched material from the parent galaxy, from gas removed during the last\nmajor merger. Given the mass and the location of the HII regions, we can\nspeculate that these young star-forming regions are potential precursors of\nglobular clusters that will be part of the halo of NGC2865 in the future. Our\nresult supports the use of the multi-slit imaging spectroscopy as a useful tool\nfor finding nearly-formed stellar systems around galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the role of ambipolar diffusion (AD) in collisions between\nmagnetized giant molecular clouds (GMCs), which may be an important mechanism\nfor triggering star cluster formation. Three dimensional simulations of GMC\ncollisions are performed using a version of the Enzo magnetohydrodynamics code\nthat has been extended to include AD. The resistivities are calculated using\nthe 31-species chemical model of Wu et al. (2015). We find that in the\nweak-field, $10\\:{\\rm \\mu G}$ case, AD has only a modest effect on the\ndynamical evolution during the collision. However, for the stronger-field,\n$30\\:{\\rm \\mu G}$ case involving near-critical clouds, AD results in formation\nof dense cores in regions where collapse is otherwise inhibited. The overall\nefficiency of formation of cores with $n_{\\rm H}\\geq10^{6}\\:{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ in\nthese simulations is increases from about 0.2% to 2% once AD is included,\ncomparable to observed values in star-forming GMCs. The gas around these cores\ntypically has relatively slow infall at speeds that are a modest fraction of\nthe free-fall speed.\n", "  We consider the motion of individual two-dimensional vortices in general\nradially symmetric potentials in Bose-Einstein condensates. We find that\nalthough in the special case of the parabolic trap there is a logarithmic\ncorrection in the dependence of the precession frequency $\\omega$ on the\nchemical potential $\\mu$, this is no longer true for a general potential $V(r)\n\\propto r^p$. Our calculations suggest that for $p>2$, the precession frequency\nscales with $\\mu$ as $\\omega \\sim \\mu^{-2/p}$. This theoretical prediction is\ncorroborated by numerical computations, both at the level of spectral\n(Bogolyubov-de Gennes) stability analysis by identifying the relevant\nprecession mode dependence on $\\mu$, but also through direct numerical\ncomputations of the vortex evolution in the large $\\mu$, so-called\nThomas-Fermi, limit. Additionally, the dependence of the precession frequency\non the radius of an initially displaced from the center vortex is examined and\nthe corresponding predictions are tested against numerical results.\n", "  Plasmon excitations in free-standing graphene and graphene/hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) heterostructure are studied using linear-response time-dependent\ndensity functional theory within the random phase approximation. Within a\nsingle theoretical framework, we examine both the plasmon dispersion behavior\nand lifetime (line width) of Dirac and $\\pi$ plasmons on an equal footing.\nParticular attention is paid to the influence of the hBN substrate and the\nanisotropic effect. Furthermore, a model-based analysis indicates that the\ncorrect dispersion behavior of $\\pi$ plasmons should be $\\omega_\\pi(q) =\n\\sqrt{E_g^2 + \\beta q}$ for small $q$'s, where $E_g$ is the band gap at the $M$\npoint in the Brillouin zone, and $\\beta$ is a fitting parameter. This model is\nradically different from previous proposals, but in good agreement with our\ncalculated results from first principles.\n", "  Three-dimensional maps of the Galactic interstellar medium are general\nastrophysical tools. Reddening maps may be based on the inversion of color\nexcess measurements for individual target stars or on statistical methods using\nstellar surveys. Three-dimensional maps based on diffuse interstellar bands\n(DIBs) have also been produced. All methods benefit from the advent of massive\nsurveys and from Gaia data. We first updated our previous local dust maps based\non a regularized Bayesian inversion of individual color excess data by\nreplacing Hipparcos or photometric distances with Gaia Data Release 1 values\nwhen available. Secondly, we complemented this database with a series of ~5,000\ncolor excess values estimated from the strength of the lambda 15273 DIB toward\nstars from SDSS/APOGEE, possessing a Gaia parallax. Third, we computed a\nlow-resolution map based on a grid of Pan-STARRS reddening measurements by\nmeans of a new hierarchical technique and used this map as the prior\ndistribution during the inversion of the two other datasets. Here we present a\nfirst attempt to combine different datasets and methods to improve the local\nmaps. The use of Gaia parallaxes introduces significant changes in some areas\nand globally increases the compactness of the structures. Additional DIB-based\ndata make it possible to assign distances to clouds located behind closer\nopaque structures and do not introduce contradictory information for the close\nstructures. A more realistic prior distribution instead of a plane-parallel\nhomogeneous distribution helps better define the structures. We validated the\nresults through comparisons with other maps and with soft X-ray data. Our study\ndemonstrates that the combination of various tracers is a potential tool for\nmore accurate maps. An online tool makes it possible to retrieve maps and\nreddening estimations (http://stilism.obspm.fr).\n", "  A relativistic spacecraft of the type envisioned by the Breakthrough Starshot\ninitiative will inevitably get charged through collisions with interstellar\nparticles and UV photons. Interstellar magnetic fields would, therefore,\ndeflect the trajectory of the spacecraft. We calculate the expected deflection\nfor typical interstellar conditions. We also find that the charge distribution\nof the spacecraft is asymmetric, producing an electric dipole moment. The\ninteraction between the moving electric dipole and the interstellar magnetic\nfield is found to produce a large torque, which can result in fast oscillation\nof the spacecraft around the axis perpendicular to the direction of motion,\nwith a period of $\\sim$ 0.5 hr. We then study the spacecraft rotation arising\nfrom impulsive torques by dust bombardment. Finally, we discuss the effect of\nthe spacecraft rotation and suggest several methods to mitigate it.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of the Rashba-split bands in the bismuth\ntellurohalides BiTe$X$ $(X=$ I, Br, Cl) from first principles. We find that\nincreasing temperature reduces the Rashba splitting, with the largest effect\nobserved in BiTeI with a reduction of the Rashba parameter of $40$% when\ntemperature increases from $0$ K to $300$ K. These results highlight the\ninadequacy of previous interpretations of the observed Rashba splitting in\nterms of static-lattice calculations alone. Notably, we find the opposite\ntrend, a strengthening of the Rashba splitting with rising temperature, in the\npressure-stabilized topological-insulator phase of BiTeI. We propose that the\nopposite trends with temperature on either side of the topological phase\ntransition could be an experimental signature for identifying it. The predicted\ntemperature dependence is consistent with optical conductivity measurements,\nand should also be observable using photoemission spectroscopy, which could\nprovide further insights into the nature of spin splitting and topology in the\nbismuth tellurohalides.\n", "  In this paper we use high-resolution cosmological simulations to study halo\nintrinsic alignment and its dependence on mass, formation time and large-scale\nenvironment. In agreement with previous studies using N-body simulations, it is\nfound that massive halos have stronger alignment. For given mass, older halos\nhave stronger alignment than younger ones. By identifying the cosmic\nenvironment of halo using Hessian matrix, we find that for given mass, halos in\ncluster regions also have stronger alignment than those in filament. The\nexisting theory has not addressed these dependencies explicitly. In this work\nwe extend the linear alignment model with inclusion of halo bias and find that\nthe halo alignment with its mass and formation time dependence can be explained\nby halo bias. However, the model can not account for the environment\ndependence, as it is found that halo bias is lower in cluster and higher in\nfilament. Our results suggest that halo bias and environment are independent\nfactors in determining halo alignment. We also study the halo alignment\ncorrelation function and find that halos are strongly clustered along their\nmajor axes and less clustered along the minor axes. The correlated halo\nalignment can extend to scale as large as $100h^{-1}$Mpc where its feature is\nmainly driven by the baryon acoustic oscillation effect.\n", "  We present a model to describe a generic circuit QED system which consists of\nmultiple artificial three-level atoms, namely qutrits, strongly coupled to a\ncavity mode. When the state transition of the atoms disobey the selection rules\nthe process that does not conserve the number of excitations can happen\ndeterminatively. Therefore, we can realize coherent exchange interaction among\nthree or more atoms mediated by the exchange of virtual photons. In addition,\nwe generalize the one cavity mode mediated interactions to the multi-cavity\nsituation, providing a method to entangle atoms located in different cavities.\nUsing experimental feasible parameters, we investigate the dynamics of the\nmodel including three cyclic-transition three-level atoms, for which the two\nlowest-energy levels can be treated as qubits. Hence, we have found that two\nqubits can jointly exchange excitation with one qubit in a coherent and\nreversible way. In the whole process, the population in the third level of\natoms is negligible and the cavity photon number is far smaller than 1. Our\nmodel provides a feasible scheme to couple multiple distant atoms together,\nwhich may find applications in quantum information processing.\n", "  We present a semiclassical proof of the weak gravity conjecture in $D = 4$\nspacetime dimensions for scalar matter gauged under a $U(1)^N$ gauge group. We\ncompute the non-perturbative macroscopic entropy of a scalar field in an\nextremal black hole background at the level of linearized backreaction on the\nmetric. The scalar field is assumed to violate or saturate the weak gravity\nconjecture. The scalar contributes a logarithmic correction to the entropy in\nthe black hole geometry that outgrows the classical contribution. We\ndemonstrate that the entropy of the gauged scalar violates the generalized\nsecond law in the limit of large black hole charge. Our result suggests that\nentropy inequalities may directly discriminate between effective field theories\nthat live in the landscape versus the swampland.\n", "  It is a challenging task to explain, in terms of a simple and compelling new\nphysics scenario, the intriguing discrepancies between the standard model\nexpectations and the data for the neutral-current observables $R_K$ and\n$R_{K^*}$, as well as the charged-current observables $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$. We\nshow that this can be achieved in an effective theory with only two unknown\nparameters. In addition, this class of models predicts some interesting\nsignatures in the context of both $B$ decays as well as high-energy collisions.\n", "  We introduce a class of generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (gLMG) models with\nsu$(m)$ interactions of Haldane-Shastry type. We have computed the partition\nfunction of these models in closed form by exactly evaluating the partition\nfunction of the restriction of a spin chain Hamiltonian of Haldane-Shastry type\nto subspaces with well-defined magnon numbers. As a byproduct of our analysis,\nwe have obtained strong numerical evidence of the Gaussian character of the\nlevel density of the latter restricted Hamiltonians, and studied the\ndistribution of the spacings of consecutive unfolded levels. We have also\ndiscussed the thermodynamic behavior of a large family of su(2) and su(3) gLMG\nmodels, showing that it is qualitatively similar to that of a two-level system.\n", "  We show that a particle detector can distinguish the $\\mathbb{RP}^3$ geon\nfrom the Schwarzschild black hole, even though they differ only by a\ntopological identification beyond the event horizon. This shows that the\ndetector can read out information about the non-local structure even when\nseparated from the non-locality by an event horizon. Our analysis of the\ndependence of the transition on the detector gap is novel, and in principle\npresents an interesting observational signal.\n", "  A constructive theoretical platform for the description of quantum space-time\ncrystals uncovers for $N$ interacting and ring-confined rotating particles the\nexistence of low-lying states with proper space-time crystal behavior. The\nconstruction of the corresponding many-body trial wave functions proceeds first\nvia symmetry breaking at the mean-field level followed by symmetry restoration\nusing projection techniques. The ensuing correlated many-body wave functions\nare stationary states and preserve the rotational symmetries, and at the same\ntime they reflect the point-group symmetries of the mean-field crystals. This\nbehavior results in the emergence of sequences of select magic angular momenta\n$L_m$. For angular-momenta away from the magic values, the trial functions\nvanish. Symmetry breaking beyond mean field can be induced by superpositions of\nsuch good-$L_m$ many-body stationary states. We show that superposing a pair of\nadjacent magic angular momenta states leads to formation of special\nbroken-symmetry states exhibiting quantum space-time-crystal behavior. In\nparticular, the corresponding particle densities rotate around the ring,\nshowing undamped and nondispersed periodic crystalline evolution in both space\nand time. The experimental synthesis of such quantum space-time-crystal wave\npackets is predicted to be favored in the vicinity of ground-state energy\ncrossings of the Aharonov-Bohm-type spectra accessed via an externally applied\nmagnetic field. These results are illustrated here for Coulomb-repelling\nfermionic ions and for a lump of contact-interaction attracting bosons.\n", "  We performed hydrodynamic computations of nonlinear stellar pulsations of\npopulation I stars at the evolutionary stages of the ascending red giant branch\nand the following luminosity drop due to the core helium flash. Red giants\npopulating this region of the Hertzsprung--Russel diagram were found to be the\nfundamental mode pulsators. The pulsation period is the largest at the tip of\nthe red giant branch and for stars with initial masses from 1.1M_\\odot to\n1.9M_\\odot ranges from 254 day to 33 day, respectively. The rate of period\nchange during the core helium flash is comparable with rates of secular period\nchange in Mira type variables during the thermal pulse in the helium shell\nsource. The period change rate is largest (\\dot\\Pi/\\Pi\\approx -0.01 yr^{-1}) in\nstars with initial mass Mzams=1.1M_\\odot and decreases to \\dot\\Pi/\\Pi\\sim\n-0.001\\ yr^{-1} for stars of the evolutionary sequence Mzams=1.9M_\\odot.\nTheoretical light curves of red giants pulsating with periods Pi > 200 day show\nthe presence of the secondary maximum similar to that observed in many Miras.\n", "  A microscopic theory of the spin Peltier effect in a bilayer structure\ncomprising a paramagnetic metal (PM) and a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) based\non the nonequilibrium Green's function method is presented. Spin current and\nheat current driven by temperature gradient and spin accumulation are\nformulated as functions of spin susceptibilities in the PM and the FI, and are\nsummarized by Onsager's reciprocal relations. By using the current formulae, we\nestimate heat generation and absorption at the interface driven by the\nheat-current injection mediated by spins from PM into FI.\n", "  Saltation threshold, the minimum wind speed for sediment transport, is a\nfundamental parameter in aeolian processes. The presence of liquid, such as\nwater on Earth or methane on Titan, may affect the threshold values to a great\nextent. Sediment density is also crucial for determining threshold values. Here\nwe provide quantitative data on density and water content of common wind tunnel\nmaterials that have been used to study conditions on Earth, Titan, Mars, and\nVenus. The measured density values for low density materials are higher\ncompared to literature values, whereas for the high density materials, there is\nno such discrepancy. We also find that low density materials have much higher\nwater content and longer atmospheric equilibration timescales compared to high\ndensity sediments. In the Titan Wind Tunnel, we performed threshold experiments\nwith the standard walnut shells (125-150 \\mu m, 7.2% water by mass) and dried\nwalnut shells (1.7% water by mass). The threshold results for the two scenarios\nare almost the same, which indicates that humidity had a negligible effect on\nthreshold for walnut shells in this experimental regime. When the water content\nis lower than 11.0%, the interparticle forces are dominated by adsorption\nforces, whereas at higher values the interparticle forces are dominated by much\nlarger capillary forces. For materials with low equilibrium water content, like\nquartz sand, capillary forces dominate. When the interparticle forces are\ndominated by adsorption forces, the threshold does not increase with increasing\nrelative humidity (RH). Only when the interparticle forces are dominated by\ncapillary forces does the threshold start to increase with increasing RH/water\ncontent. Since tholins have a low methane content (0.3% at saturation, Curtis\net al., 2008), we believe tholins would behave similarly to quartz sand when\nsubjected to methane moisture. [abridged abstract]\n", "  We use a swap Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically prepare bulk glasses with\nkinetic stability comparable to that of glass films produced experimentally by\nphysical vapor deposition. By melting these systems into the liquid state, we\nshow that some of our glasses retain their amorphous structures longer than\n10^5 times the equilibrium structural relaxation time. This exceptional kinetic\nstability cannot be achieved experimentally for bulk materials. We perform\nsimulations at both constant volume and constant pressure to demonstrate that\nthe density mismatch between the ultrastable glass and the equilibrium liquid\naccounts for a major part of the observed kinetic stability.\n", "  We consider isosinglet scalar extension of a model with a Higgs democracy -\nmultihiggs extension of the SM where each quark and lepton has its own Higgs\nisodoublet. The addition of light isosinglet scalar allows to solve both muon\n$g_{\\mu}-2$ anomaly and dark matter problem. Also we point out that an\nextension of the model with $L_{\\mu} - L_{\\tau}$ vector interaction allows not\nonly explain muon $g_{\\mu} - 2$ anomaly but also dark matter density.\n", "  The width of the $f_1 (1285) \\to e^+e^-$ decay is calculated in the vector\nmeson dominance model. The result depends on the relative phase between two\ncoupling constants describing $f_1 \\to \\rho^0\\gamma$ decay. The width $\\Gamma\n(f_1 \\to e^+e^-)$ is estimated to be $\\simeq 0.07-0.19$ eV. Direct $f_1$\nproduction in $e^+e^-$ collisions is discussed, and the $e^+e^- \\to f_1\\to a_0\n\\pi \\to \\eta \\pi \\pi$ cross section is calculated. Charge asymmetry in the\n$e^+e^- \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ reaction due to interference between $e^+e^- \\to\nf_1$ and $e^+e^- \\to \\eta \\rho^0$ amplitudes is studied.\n", "  The rheology of dense granular flows is often seen as dependent on the nature\nof the energy landscape defining the modes of energy relaxation under shear. We\ninvestigate numerically the transition from soft to rigid particles, varying\n$S$, their stiffness compared to the confining pressure over three decades and\nthe inertial number $I$ of the shear flow over five decades. We show that the\nrheological constitutive relation, characterized by a dynamical friction\ncoefficient of the form $\\mu(I)=\\mu_c + a I^{\\alpha}$ is marginally affected by\nthe particle stiffness, with constitutive parameters being essentially\ndependent on the inter-particle friction. Similarly, the distribution of local\nshear rate mostly depends on the inertial number $I$, which shows that the\ncharacteristic timescale of plastic events is primarily controlled by the\nconfining pressure and is insensitive to $S$. By contrast, the form under which\nenergy is stored between these events, but also the contact network properties\nsuch as the coordination number and the distance to isostaticity, are strongly\naffected by stiffness, allowing us to discuss the different regimes in the\n$(S,I)$ phase space.\n", "  One of the most active fields of research of modern-day astrophysics is that\nof massive black hole formation and co-evolution with the host galaxy. In these\ninvestigations, ranging from cosmological simulations, to semi-analytical\nmodeling, to observational studies, the Bondi solution for accretion on a\ncentral point mass is widely adopted. In this work we generalize the classical\nBondi accretion theory to take into account the effects of the gravitational\npotential of the host galaxy, and of radiation pressure in the optically thin\nlimit. Then, we present the fully analytical solution, in terms of the\nLambert-Euler $W$-function, for isothermal accretion in Jaffe and Hernquist\ngalaxies with a central black hole. The flow structure is found to be sensitive\nto the shape of the mass profile of the host galaxy. These results and the\nformulae that are provided, mostly important the one for the critical accretion\nparameter, allow for a direct evaluation of all flow properties, and are then\nuseful for the above mentioned studies. As an application, we examine the\ndeparture from the true mass accretion rate of estimates obtained using the gas\nproperties at various distances from the black hole, under the hypothesis of\nclassical Bondi accretion. An overestimate is obtained from regions close to\nthe black hole, and an underestimate outside a few Bondi radii; the exact\nposition of the transition between the two kinds of departure depends on the\ngalaxy model.\n", "  We develop a new functional renormalization group (FRG) approach for the\ntwo-dimensional XY-model by combining the lattice FRG proposed by Machado and\nDupuis [Phys. Rev. E 82, 041128 (2010)] with a duality transformation which\nexplicitly introduces vortices via an integer-valued field. We show that the\nhierarchy of FRG flow equations for the infinite set of relevant and marginal\ncouplings of the model can be reduced to the well-known Kosterlitz-Thouless\nrenormalization group equations for the renormalized temperature and the vortex\nfugacity. Within our approach it is straightforward to include weak amplitude\nas well as out-of-plane fluctuations of the spins, which lead to additional\ninteractions between the vortices that do not spoil the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. This demonstrates that previous\nfailures to obtain a line of true fixed points within the FRG are a\nmathematical artifact of insufficient truncation schemes.\n", "  We develop high temperature series expansions for the thermodynamic\nproperties of the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Numerical results\nfor uniform susceptibility, heat capacity and entropy as a function of\ntemperature for different values of the Kitaev coupling $K$ and Heisenberg\nexachange coupling $J$ (with $|J|\\le |K|$) are presented. These expansions show\ngood convergence down to a temperature of a fraction of $K$ and in some cases\ndown to $T=K/10$. In the Kitaev exchange dominated regime, the inverse\nsusceptibility has a nearly linear temperature dependence over a wide\ntemperature range. However, we show that already at temperatures $10$-times the\nCurie-Weiss temperature, the effective Curie-Weiss constant estimated from the\ndata can be off by a factor of 2. We find that the magnitude of the heat\ncapacity maximum at the short-range order peak, is substantially smaller for\nsmall $J/K$ than for $J$ of order or larger than $K$. We suggest that this\nitself represents a simple marker for the relative importance of the Kitaev\nterms in these systems. Somewhat surprisingly, both heat capacity and\nsusceptibility data on Na$_2$IrO$_3$ are consistent with a dominant {\\it\nantiferromagnetic} Kitaev exchange constant of about $300-400$ $K$.\n", "  We demonstrate analytically and numerically the existence of geodesically\ncomplete singularities in quintessence and scalar tensor quintessence models\nwith scalar field potential of the form $V(\\phi)\\sim \\vert \\phi\\vert^n$ with\n$0<n<1$. In the case of quintessence, the singularity which occurs at $\\phi=0$,\ninvolves divergence of the third time derivative of the scale factor\n(Generalized Sudden Future Singularity (GSFS)), and of the second derivative of\nthe scalar field. In the case of scalar-tensor quintessence with the same\npotential and with a linear minimal coupling ($F(\\phi)=1-\\lambda \\phi$), the\nsingularity is stronger and involves divergence of the second derivative of the\nscale factor (Sudden Future Singularity (SFS)). We show that the scale factor\nclose to the singularity is of the form $a(t)=a_s+b(t_{s}-t) + c(t_{s}-t)^2\n+d(t_{s}-t)^q$ where $a_s,b,c,d$ are constants obtained from the dynamical\nequations and $t_s$ is the time of the singularity. In the case of quintessence\nwe find $q=n+2$ (ie $2<q<3$), while for the case of scalar-tensor quintessence\n$q=n+1$ ($1<q<2$). We verify these analytical results numerically and extend\nthem to the case where a perfect fluid is present. The linear and quadratic\nterms in $(t_{s}-t)$ that appear in the expansion of the scale factor around\n$t_s$ are subdominant for the diverging derivatives close to the singularity,\nbut can play an important role in the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Using\nthe analytically derived relations between these terms, we derive relations\ninvolving the Hubble parameter close to the singularity, which may be used as\nobservational signatures of such singularities in this class of models. For\nquintessence with matter fluid, we find that close to the singularity $\\dot\nH=\\frac{3}{2}\\Omega_{0m} (1+z_{s})^{3}-3H^{2}$.\n", "  We present experimental results on the controlled de-excitation of Rydberg\nstates in a cold gas of Rb atoms. The effect of the van der Waals interactions\nbetween the Rydberg atoms is clearly seen in the de-excitation spectrum and\ndynamics. Our observations are confirmed by numerical simulations. In\nparticular, for off-resonant (facilitated) excitation we find that the\nde-excitation spectrum reflects the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the\nquasi one-dimensional geometry of our experiment. We discuss future\napplications of this technique and implications for detection and controlled\ndissipation schemes.\n", "  Radiative feedback from stars and galaxies has been proposed as a potential\nsolution to many of the tensions with simplistic galaxy formation models based\non $\\Lambda$CDM, such as the faint end of the UV luminosity function. The total\nenergy budget of radiation could exceed that of galactic winds and supernovae\ncombined, which has driven the development of sophisticated algorithms that\nevolve both the radiation field and the hydrodynamical response of gas\nsimultaneously, in a cosmological context. We probe self-feedback on galactic\nscales using the adaptive mesh refinement, radiative transfer, hydrodynamics,\nand $N$-body code. Unlike previous studies which assume a homogeneous UV\nbackground, we self-consistently evolve both the radiation field and gas to\nconstrain the halo baryon fraction during cosmic reionization. We demonstrate\nthat the characteristic halo mass with mean baryon fraction half the cosmic\nmean, $M_{\\mathrm{c}}(z)$, shows very little variation as a function of\nmass-weighted ionization fraction. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of\nmetal cooling and the ability to resolve scales small enough for self-shielding\nto become efficient leads to a significant drop in $M_{\\mathrm{c}}$ when\ncompared to recent studies. Finally, we develop an Artificial Neural Network\nthat is capable of predicting the baryon fraction of haloes based on recent\ntidal interactions, gas temperature, and mass-weighted ionization fraction.\nSuch a model can be applied to any reionization history, and trivially\nincorporated into semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.\n", "  The formation of planets strongly depends on the total amount as well as on\nthe spatial distribution of solids in protoplanetary disks. Thanks to the\nimprovements in resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, measurements of\nthe surface density of mm-sized grains are now possible on large samples of\ndisks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We\nanalyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus\nstar forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine\nphysical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size\nand to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux\n(a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the\ndisk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at\nsimilar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature\nand scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are\ngenerally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.\nConsidering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to\ntentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous\nspreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be\nruled out.\n", "  We report ferroelectric ordering in Ni substituted CaBaCo4O7. Magnetization\nshowed ferrimagnetic transition at 60 K and an additional transition is found ~\n82 K, further, enhanced antiferromagnetic interactions and decrease in\nsaturation magnetization are noticed with Ni substitution. The dielectric and\npyroelectric measurements illustrate a strong coupling between spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom; ferroelectric behavior is confirmed with enhanced ordering\ntemperature (~82 K) and saturation polarization (250 muC/m2. Neutron\ndiffraction has revealed an increase in c-lattice parameter in Ni sample and\nall the Co/Ni moments are reoriented in a- direction; evidently a non-collinear\nferrimagnetic to collinear ferrimagnetic spin order is observed. The coupling\nbetween the triangular and Kagome layers weakens and leads to up-up-down-down\nAFM ordering in the Kagoma layer. This can be viewed as a 2D-collinear layer\nwith unequal bond distances and most likely responsible for the switching of\nelectric polarization.\n", "  It has previously been shown that a dye-filled microcavity can produce a\nBose-Einstein condensate of photons. Thermalization of photons is possible via\nrepeated absorption and re-emission by the dye molecules. In this paper, we\ntheoretically explore the behavior of the polarization of light in this system.\nWe find that in contrast to the near complete thermalization between different\nspatial modes of light, thermalization of polarization states is expected to\ngenerally be incomplete. We show that the polarization degree changes\nsignificantly from below to above threshold, and explain the dependence of\npolarization on all relevant material parameters.\n", "  We study two different forms of fluctuation-dissipation processes generating\nanomalous relaxations to equilibrium of an initial out of equilibrium\ncondition, the former being based on a stationary although very slow\ncorrelation function and the latter characterized by the occurrence of crucial\nevents, namely, non-Poisson renewal events, incompatible with the stationary\ncondition. Both forms of regression to equilibrium have the same\nnon-exponential Mittag-Leffler structure. We analyze the single trajectories of\nthe two processes by recording the time distances between two consecutive\norigin re-crossings and establishing the corresponding waiting time probability\ndensity function (PDF), $\\psi(t)$. In the former case, with no crucial events,\n$\\psi(t)$ is exponential and in the latter case, with crucial events, $\\psi(t)$\nis an inverse power law PDF with a diverging first moment. We discuss the\nconsequences that this result is expected to have for the correct\ninterpretation of some anomalous relaxation processes.\n", "  We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of phonon spectra in the\nparent superconductor iron-tuned chalcogenide Fe$_{1+x}$Te, for two different x\ncontents (x $\\leq$ 0.11), using neutron time-of-flight technique. Thermal\nneutron spectroscopy allowed to collect the low-temperature Stokes spectra over\nan extended Q-range, at 2, 40 and 120K - hence covering both the magnetic\nmonoclinic and the paramagnetic tetragonal phases. Whereas cold-neutrons\nallowed to measure high-resolution anti-Stokes spectra at 140, 220 and 300K,\nthus covering the tetragonal phase. Our results evidence a spin-phonon coupling\nbehaviour towards the observed noticeable temperature-dependent change of the\nStokes spectra across the transition temperatures. On the other hand, the\nanti-Stokes spectra reveal a pronounced hardening of the low-energy, acoustic\nregion, of the phonon spectrum, upon heating, indicating a strong anharmonicity\nand a subtle dependence of phonons on structural evolution within the\ntetragonal phase. Experimental results are accompanied by ab initio\ncalculations of phonon spectra of the tetragonal stoichiometric phase for a\ncomparison with the high-resolution anti-Stokes spectra. Calculations included\ndifferent density functional methods. Spin polarization and van der Waals\ninteraction, were either considered or neglected, individually or\nconcomitantly, in order to study their respective effect on lattice dynamics\ndescription. Our results suggest that including van der Waals interaction has\nonly a slight effect on phonon dynamics, however, phonon spectra are better\ndescribed when spin polarization is included, in a cooperative way with van der\nWaals interactions.\n", "  The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is expected to be\ndetected in the next few years, either with existing instruments or by the\nupcoming SKA and HERA projects. In this context there is a pressing need for\npublicly available high-quality templates covering a wide range of possible\nsignals. These are needed both for end-to-end simulations of the up-coming\ninstruments, as well as to develop signal analysis methods. In this work we\npresent such a set of templates, publicly available, for download at\nhttps://21ssd.obspm.fr/. The database contains 21-cm brightness temperature\nlightcones at high and low resolution, and several derived statistical\nquantities for 45 models spanning our choice of 3D parameter space. These data\nare the result of fully coupled radiative hydrodynamic high resolution\n($1024^3$) simulations performed with the LICORICE code. Both X-ray and Lyman\nline transfer is performed to account for heating and Wouthuysen-Field coupling\nfluctuations. We also present a first exploitation of the data using the power\nspectrum and the Pixel Distribution Function (PDF) as functions of redshifts,\ncomputed from lightcone data. We analyse how these two quantities behave when\nvarying the model parameters while taking into account the thermal noise\nexpected of a typical SKA survey. Finally, we show that the power spectrum and\nthe PDF have different -- and to some extent complementary -- abilities to\ndistinguish between different models. This opens the door to formulating an\noptimal sampling of the parameter space, dependant on the chosen diagnostics.\n", "  Cosmological models with Galileon gravity are an alternative to the standard\n$\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$ paradigm with testable predictions at the level of its\nself-accelerating solutions for the expansion history, as well as large-scale\nstructure formation. Here, we place constraints on the full parameter space of\nthese models using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) (including\nlensing), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe\n(ISW) effect. We pay special attention to the ISW effect for which we use the\ncross-spectra, $C_\\ell^{\\rm T g}$, of CMB temperature maps and foreground\ngalaxies from the WISE survey. The sign of $C_\\ell^{\\rm T g}$ is set by the\ntime evolution of the lensing potential in the redshift range of the galaxy\nsample: it is positive if the potential decays (like in $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$),\nnegative if it deepens. We constrain three subsets of Galileon gravity\nseparately known as the Cubic, Quartic and Quintic Galileons. The cubic\nGalileon model predicts a negative $C_\\ell^{\\rm T g}$ and exhibits a\n$7.8\\sigma$ tension with the data, which effectively rules it out. For the\nquartic and quintic models the ISW data also rule out a significant region of\nthe parameter space but permit regions where the goodness-of-fit is comparable\nto $\\Lambda {\\rm CDM}$. The data prefers a non zero sum of the neutrino masses\n($\\sum m_\\nu\\approx 0.5$eV) with $ \\sim \\! 5\\sigma$ significance in these\nmodels. The best-fitting models have values of $H_0$ consistent with local\ndeterminations, thereby avoiding the tension that exists in $\\Lambda {\\rm\nCDM}$. We also identify and discuss a $\\sim \\! 2\\sigma$ tension that Galileon\ngravity exhibits with recent BAO measurements. Our analysis shows overall that\nGalileon cosmologies cannot be ruled out by current data but future lensing,\nBAO and ISW data hold strong potential to do so.\n", "  The lifetimes and decay channels of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules created\nin a dense BEC are examined by monitoring the time evolution of the Rydberg\npopulation using field ionization. Studies of molecules with values of\nprincipal quantum number, $n$, in the range $n=49$ to $n=72$ that contain tens\nto hundreds of ground state atoms within the Rydberg electron orbit show that\ntheir presence leads to marked changes in the field ionization characteristics.\nThe Rydberg molecules have lifetimes of $\\sim1-5\\,\\mu$s, their destruction\nbeing attributed to two main processes: formation of Sr$^+_2$ ions through\nassociative ionization, and dissociation induced through $L$-changing\ncollisions. The observed loss rates are consistent with a reaction model that\nemphasizes the interaction between the Rydberg core ion and its nearest\nneighbor ground-state atom. The measured lifetimes place strict limits on the\ntime scales over which studies involving Rydberg species in cold, dense atomic\ngases can be undertaken and limit the coherence times for such measurements.\n", "  We study effects of a potential barrier on collective modes of superfluid\nBose gases in optical lattices. We assume that the barrier is created by local\nsuppression of the hopping amplitude. When the system is in a close vicinity of\nthe Mott transition at commensurate fillings, where an approximate\nparticle-hole symmetry emerges, there exist bound states of Higgs amplitude\nmode that are localized around the barrier. By applying the Gutzwiller\nmean-field approximation to the Bose-Hubbard model, we analyze properties of\nnormal modes of the system with a special focus on the Higgs bound states. We\nshow that when the system becomes away from the Mott transition point, the\nHiggs bound states turn into quasi-bound states due to inevitable breaking of\nthe particle-hole symmetry. We use a stabilization method to compute the\nresonance energy and line width of the quasi-bound states. We compare the\nresults obtained by the Gutzwiller approach with those by the Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory. We find that the Higgs bound states survive even in a parameter region\nfar from the Mott transition, where the Ginzburg-Landau theory fails.\n", "  We study hole spin resonance in a p-channel silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor\nfield-effect transistor. In the sub-threshold region, the measured source-drain\ncurrent reveals a double dot in the channel. The observed spin resonance\nspectra agree with a model of strongly coupled two-spin states in the presence\nof a spin-orbit-induced anti-crossing. Detailed spectroscopy at the\nanti-crossing shows a suppressed spin resonance signal due to\nspin-orbit-induced quantum state mixing. This suppression is also observed for\nmulti-photon spin resonances. Our experimental observations agree with\ntheoretical calculations.\n", "  We revisit the interpretation of quasiparticle scattering interference in\ncuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors. This phenomenon has been very successful in\nreconstructing the dispersions of d-wave Bogoliubov excitations, but the\nsuccessful identification and interpretation of QPI in scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS) experiments rely on theoretical results obtained for the\ncase of isolated impurities. We introduce a highly flexible technique to\nsimulate STS measurements by computing the local density of states using\nreal-space Green's functions defined on two-dimensional lattices with as many\nas 100,000 sites. We focus on the following question: to what extent can the\nexperimental results be reproduced when various forms of distributed disorder\nare present? We consider randomly distributed point-like impurities, smooth\n\"Coulombic\" disorder, and disorder arising from random on-site energies and\nsuperconducting gaps. We find an apparent paradox: the QPI peaks in the\nFourier-transformed local density of states appear to be sharper and better\ndefined in experiment than those seen in our simulations. We arrive at a no-go\nresult for smooth-potential disorder since this does not reproduce the QPI\npeaks associated with large-momentum scattering. An ensemble of point-like\nimpurities gets closest to experiment, but this goes hand in hand with impurity\ncores that are not seen in experiment. We also study the effects of possible\nmeasurement artifacts (the \"fork mechanism\"), which turn out to be of\nrelatively minor consequence. It appears that there is an unknown mechanism at\nwork which renders the QPI peaks much sharper than they are based on present\ntheoretical understanding.\n", "  Context. The Sun is an active star that produces large-scale energetic events\nsuch as solar flares and coronal mass ejections and numerous smaller-scale\nevents such as solar jets. These events are often associated with accelerated\nparticles that can cause emission at radio wavelengths. The reconfiguration of\nthe solar magnetic field in the corona is believed to be the cause of the\nmajority of solar energetic events and accelerated particles. Aims. Here, we\ninvestigate a bright J-burst that was associated with a solar jet and the\npossible emission mechanism causing these two phenomena. Methods. We used data\nfrom the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to observe a solar jet, and radio\ndata from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograph\n(NRH) to observe a J-burst over a broad frequency range (33-173 MHz) on 9 July\n2013 at ~11:06 UT. Results. The J-burst showed fundamental and harmonic\ncomponents and it was associated with a solar jet observed at extreme\nultraviolet wavelengths with SDO. The solar jet occurred at a time and location\ncoincident with the radio burst, in the northern hemisphere, and not inside a\ngroup of complex active regions in the southern hemisphere. The jet occurred in\nthe negative polarity region of an area of bipolar plage. Newly emerged\npositive flux in this region appeared to be the trigger of the jet.\nConclusions. Magnetic reconnection between the overlying coronal field lines\nand the newly emerged positive field lines is most likely the cause of the\nsolar jet. Radio imaging provides a clear association between the jet and the\nJ-burst which shows the path of the accelerated electrons.\n", "  We demonstrate the deterministic generation of multipartite entanglement\nbased on scalable methods. Four qubits are encoded in $^{40}$Ca$^+$, stored in\na micro-structured segmented Paul trap. These qubits are sequentially entangled\nby laser-driven pairwise gate operations. Between these, the qubit register is\ndynamically reconfigured via ion shuttling operations, where ion crystals are\nseparated and merged, and ions are moved in and out of a fixed laser\ninteraction zone. A sequence consisting of three pairwise entangling gates\nyields a four-ion GHZ state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\vert\n0000\\rangle+\\vert 1111\\rangle\\right)$, and full quantum state tomography\nreveals a Bell state fidelity of 94.4(3)\\%. We analyze the decoherence of this\nstate and employ dynamic decoupling on the spatially distributed constituents\nto maintain 69(5)\\% coherence at a storage time of 1.1~seconds.\n", "  Little is observationally known about the progenitors of Type Ibc supernovae\n(SNe) or the typical activity of SNe progenitors in their final years. Here, we\nanalyze deep Large Binocular Telescope imaging data spanning the 4 years before\nand after the Type Ic SN 2012fh using difference imaging. We place 1$\\sigma$\nupper limits on the detection of the progenitor star at $M_R>-4.0$, $M_V>-3.8$,\n$M_B>-3.1$, and $M_U>-3.8$ mag. These limits are the tightest placed on a Type\nIc SNe and they largely rule out single star evolutionary models in favor of a\nbinary channel as the origin of this SN. We also constrain the activity of the\nprogenitor to be small on an absolute scale, with the RMS $UBVR$ optical\nvariability $<2500L_\\odot$ and long-term dimming or brightening trends\n$<1000L_\\odot/\\text{year}$ in all four bands.\n", "  A critical challenge in the observation of the redshifted 21-cm line is its\nseparation from bright Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. In particular,\nthe instrumental leakage of polarized foregrounds, which undergo significant\nFaraday rotation as they propagate through the interstellar medium, may\nharmfully contaminate the 21-cm power spectrum. We develop a formalism to\ndescribe the leakage due to instrumental widefield effects in visibility-based\npower spectra measured with redundant arrays, extending the delay-spectrum\napproach presented in Parsons et al. (2012). We construct polarized sky models\nand propagate them through the instrument model to simulate realistic full-sky\nobservations with the Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization. We\nfind that the leakage due to a population of polarized point sources is\nexpected to be higher than diffuse Galactic polarization at any $k$ mode for a\n30~m reference baseline. For the same reference baseline, a foreground-free\nwindow at $k > 0.3 \\, h$~Mpc$^{-1}$ can be defined in terms of leakage from\ndiffuse Galactic polarization even under the most pessimistic assumptions. If\nmeasurements of polarized foreground power spectra or a model of polarized\nforegrounds are given, our method is able to predict the polarization leakage\nin actual 21-cm observations, potentially enabling its statistical subtraction\nfrom the measured 21-cm power spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the time-evolution of quantum entanglement between an\nelectron, liberated by a strong few-cycle laser pulse, and its parent ion-core.\nSince the standard procedure is numerically prohibitive in this case, we\npropose a novel way to quantify the quantum correlation in such a system: we\nuse the reduced density matrices of the directional subspaces along the\npolarization of the laser pulse and along the transverse directions as building\nblocks for an approximate entanglement entropy. We present our results, based\non accurate numerical simulations, in terms of several of these entropies, for\nselected values of the peak electric field strength and the carrier-envelope\nphase difference of the laser pulse. The time evolution of the mutual entropy\nof the electron and the ion-core motion along the direction of the laser\npolarization is similar to our earlier results based on a simple\none-dimensional model. However, taking into account also the dynamics\nperpendicular to the laser polarization reveals a surprisingly different\nentanglement dynamics above the laser intensity range corresponding to pure\ntunneling: the quantum entanglement decreases with time in the over-the-barrier\nionization regime.\n", "  We show that the performances of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus can be improved by\nusing a magnetic field profile for the atomic spin evolution designed through\nshortcut to adiabaticity technique. Interestingly, it can be made more compact\n- for atomic beams propagating at a given velocity - and more resilient to a\ndispersion in velocity, in comparison with the results obtained with a standard\nuniform rotation of the magnetic field. Our results are obtained using a\nreverse engineering approach based on Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants. We discuss\nquantitatively the advantages offered by our configuration in terms of the\nresources involved and show that it drastically enhances the fidelity of the\nquantum state transfer achieved by the Stern-Gerlach device.\n", "  Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group technique we study the effect\nof spin-orbit coupling on a three-orbital Hubbard model in the $(t_{2g})^{4}$\nsector and in one dimension. Fixing the Hund coupling to a robust value\ncompatible with some multiorbital materials, we present the phase diagram\nvarying the Hubbard $U$ and spin-orbit coupling $\\lambda$, at zero temperature.\nOur results are shown to be qualitatively similar to those recently reported\nusing the Dynamical Mean Field Theory in higher dimensions, providing a robust\nbasis to approximate many-body techniques. Among many results, we observe an\ninteresting transition from an orbital-selective Mott phase to an excitonic\ninsulator with increasing $\\lambda$ at intermediate $U$. In the strong $U$\ncoupling limit, we find a non-magnetic insulator with an effective angular\nmomentum $\\langle(\\textbf{J}^{eff})^{2}\\rangle \\ne 0$ near the excitonic phase,\nsmoothly connected to the $\\langle(\\textbf{J}^{eff})^{2}\\rangle = 0$ regime. We\nalso provide a list of quasi-one dimensional materials where the physics\ndiscussed in this publication could be realized.\n", "  Random textures of the orbital part of the order parameter of superfluid\n3He-A in aerogel are analyzed theoretically in the Ginzburg and Landau region\nboth in the presence and in the absence of a global anisotropy. Correlation\nfunctions of angles, determining orientation of the order parameter are found\nfor relative distances which are small in comparison with the characteristic\nscale of the random texture. Modifications of the Larkin-Imry-Ma state in\nlimiting cases of a relatively strong uniaxial compression and of a uniaxial\nstretching are analyzed and characteristic parameters of the emerging states\nare found.\n", "  We study the approach to the adiabatic limit in periodically driven systems.\nSpecifically focusing on a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field we find that, when the\nparameters of the Hamiltonian lead to a quasi-degeneracy in the Floquet\nspectrum, the evolution is not adiabatic even if the frequency of the field is\nmuch smaller than the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. We argue that this is a\ngeneral phenomenon of periodically driven systems. Although an explanation\nbased on a perturbation theory in $\\omega_0$ cannot be given, because of the\nsingularity of the zero frequency limit, we are able to describe this\nphenomenon by means of a mapping to an extended Hilbert space, in terms of\nresonances of an effective two-band Wannier-Stark ladder. Remarkably, the\nphenomenon survives in the presence of dissipation towards an environment and\ncan be therefore easily experimentally observed.\n", "  The interaction between two initially causally disconnected regions of the\nuniverse is studied using analogies of non-commutative quantum mechanics and\ndeformation of Poisson manifolds. These causally disconnect regions are\ngoverned by two independent Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)\nmetrics with scale factors $a$ and $b$ and cosmological constants $\\Lambda_a$\nand $\\Lambda_b$, respectively. The causality is turned on by positing a\nnon-trivial Poisson bracket $[ {\\cal P}_{\\alpha}, {\\cal P}_{\\beta} ]\n=\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta}\\frac{\\kappa}{G}$, where $G$ is Newton's gravitational\nconstant and $\\kappa $ is a dimensionless parameter. The posited deformed\nPoisson bracket has an interpretation in terms of 3-cocycles, anomalies and\nPoissonian manifolds. The modified FLRW equations acquire an energy-momentum\ntensor from which we explicitly obtain the equation of state parameter. The\nmodified FLRW equations are solved numerically and the solutions are\ninflationary or oscillating depending on the values of $\\kappa$. In this model\nthe accelerating and decelerating regime may be periodic. The analysis of the\nequation of state clearly shows the presence of dark energy. By completeness,\nthe perturbative solution for $\\kappa \\ll1 $ is also studied.\n", "  We present new evidence for eight early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the CALIFA\nSurvey that show clear rotation around their major photometric axis (\"prolate\nrotation\"). These are LSBCF560-04, NGC 0647, NGC 0810, NGC 2484, NGC 4874, NGC\n5216, NGC 6173 and NGC 6338. Including NGC 5485, a known case of an ETG with\nstellar prolate rotation, as well as UGC 10695, a further possible candidate\nfor prolate rotation, we report ten CALIFA galaxies in total that show evidence\nfor such a feature in their stellar kinematics. Prolate rotators correspond to\n~9% of the volume-corrected sample of CALIFA ETGs, a fraction much higher than\npreviously reported. We find that prolate rotation is more common among the\nmost massive ETGs. We investigate the implications of these findings by\nstudying N-body merger simulations, and show that a prolate ETG with rotation\naround its major axis could be the result of a major polar merger, with the\namplitude of prolate rotation depending on the initial bulge-to-total stellar\nmass ratio of its progenitor galaxies. Additionally, we find that prolate ETGs\nresulting from this formation scenario show a correlation between their stellar\nline-of-sight velocity and higher order moment h_3, opposite to typical oblate\nETGs, as well as a double peak of their stellar velocity dispersion along their\nminor axis. Finally, we investigate the origin of prolate rotation in polar\ngalaxy merger remnants. Our findings suggest that prolate rotation in massive\nETGs might be more common than previously expected, and can help towards a\nbetter understanding of their dynamical structure and formation origin.\n", "  Plasmonics allows manipulating light at the nanoscale, but has limitations\ndue to the static nature of nanostructures and lack of tuneability. We propose\nand theoretically analyse a room-temperature liquid-metal nanodroplet that\nchanges its shape, and therefore tunes the plasmon resonance frequency, due to\ncapillary oscillations. We show the possibility to tune the capillary\noscillation frequency of the nanodroplet and to drive the oscillations\nelectrically or mechanically. Employed as a tuneable nanoantenna, the\nnanodroplet may find applications in sensors, imaging, microscopy, and\nmedicine.\n", "  Saturation properties are directly linked to the short-range scale of the\ntwo-body interaction of the particles. The case of helium is particular, from\none hand the two-body potential has a strong repulsion at short distances. On\nthe other hand, the extremely weak binding of the helium dimer locates this\nsystem very close to the unitary limit allowing for a description based on an\neffective theory. At leading order of this theory a two- and a three-body term\nappear, each one characterized by a low energy constant. In a potential model\nthis description corresponds to a soft potential model with a two-body term\npurely attractive plus a three-body term purely repulsive constructed to\ndescribe the dimer and trimer binding energies. Here we analyse the capability\nof this model to describe the saturation properties making a direct link\nbetween the low energy scale and the short-range correlations. We will show\nthat the energy per particle, $E_N/N$, can be obtained with reasonable accuracy\nat leading order extending the validity of this approximation, characterizing\nuniversal behavior in few-boson systems close to the unitary limit, to the\nmany-body system.\n", "  In this work we study the implications of light-quark pionic matter at finite\ntemperatures on the properties of open and hidden charm mesons. The meson-meson\ninteractions are described by means of a chiral unitary approach accounting for\ncoupled channels effects. The in-medium Lippmann-Schwinger Equations, which\nconsider the change in self-energy that the mesons acquire from interacting\nwith the surrounding pionic matter, are solved self-consistently, and the\nspectral functions of the mesons in the hot pion bath are obtained. It is\nobserved that the charmed mesons develop a quite substantial pion-induced\nwidth, being of several tens at a temperature of 150 MeV. The $J/\\Psi$ meson\nstays narrow, but its pionic width at 150 MeV, found to be around 0.1 MeV, is\nalready larger that its vacuum width.\n", "  Aims: In this work, we analyse the multiwavelength brightness variations and\nflaring activity of FSRQ PKS1510-089, aiming to constrain the position of the\nemission sources.\n  Methods: We report 7 mm (43 GHz) radio and R-band polarimetric observations\nof PKS1510-089. The radio observations were performed at the Itapetinga Radio\nObservatory, while the polarimetric data were obtained at the Pico dos Dias\nObservatory. The 7 mm observations cover the period between 2011 and 2013,\nwhile the optical polarimetric observations were made between 2009 and 2012.\n  Results: At 7 mm, we detected a correlation between four radio and\n$\\gamma$-ray flares with a delay of about 54 days between them; the higher\nfrequency counterpart occurred first. Using optical polarimetry, we detected a\nlarge variation in polarization angle (PA) within two days associated with the\nbeginning of a $\\gamma$-ray flare. Complementing our data with other data\nobtained in the literature, we show that PA presented rotations associated with\nthe occurrence of flares.\n  Conclusions: Our results can be explained by a shock-in-jet model, in which a\nnew component is formed in the compact core producing an optical and/or\n$\\gamma$-ray flare, propagates along the jet, and after some time becomes\noptically thin and is detected as a flare at radio frequencies. The variability\nin the polarimetric parameters can also be reproduced; we can explain large\nvariation in both PA and polarization degree (PD), in only one of them, or in\nneither, depending on the differences in PA and PD between the jet and the new\ncomponent.\n", "  Prior to star formation, pre-stellar cores accumulate matter towards the\ncentre. As a consequence, their central density increases while the temperature\ndecreases. Understanding the evolution of the chemistry and physics in this\nearly phase is crucial to study the processes governing the formation of a\nstar. We aim at studying the chemical differentiation of a prototypical\npre-stellar core, L1544, by detailed molecular maps. In contrast with single\npointing observations, we performed a deep study on the dependencies of\nchemistry on physical and external conditions. We present the emission maps of\n39 different molecular transitions belonging to 22 different molecules in the\ncentral 6.25 arcmin$^2$ of L1544. We classified our sample in five families,\ndepending on the location of their emission peaks within the core. Furthermore,\nto systematically study the correlations among different molecules, we have\nperformed the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated emission\nmaps. The PCA allows us to reduce the amount of variables in our dataset.\nFinally, we compare the maps of the first three principal components with the\nH$_2$ column density map, and the T$_{dust}$ map of the core. The results of\nour qualitative analysis is the classification of the molecules in our dataset\nin the following groups: (i) the $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ family (carbon chain\nmolecules), (ii) the dust peak family (nitrogen-bearing species), (iii) the\nmethanol peak family (oxygen-bearing molecules), (iv) the HNCO peak family\n(HNCO, propyne and its deuterated isotopologues). Only HC$^{18}$O$^+$ and\n$^{13}$CS do not belong to any of the above mentioned groups. The principal\ncomponent maps allow us to confirm the (anti-)correlations among different\nfamilies that were described in a first qualitative analysis, but also points\nout the correlation that could not be inferred before.\n", "  The results of 4,747 intensified CCD observations of double stars, made with\nthe 26-inch refractor of the U.S. Naval Observatory, are presented. Each\nobservation of a system represents a combination of over two thousand\nshort-exposure images. These observations are averaged into 2,667 mean relative\npositions and range in separation from 0.328\" to 95.9\", with a median\nseparation of 8.673\". Four orbits are improved. This is the 22nd in this series\nof papers and covers the period 4 January 2016 through 29 December 2016.\n", "  We present the MUSE observations of UGC 6697, a giant (Mstar 10^{10} Msol)\nspiral galaxy infalling in the nearby cluster Abell 1367. During its high\nvelocity transit through the intracluster medium (ICM), the hydrodynamical\ninteractions with the ICM produce a ~ 100 kpc tail of ionized gas that we map\nwith a mosaic of five MUSE pointings up to 60 kpc from the galaxy. CGCG 97087N,\na small companion that lies at few arcminutes in projection from UGC 6697, is\nalso suffering from the hydrodynamic action of the ICM of the cluster. Along\nthe whole extent of the tail we detect diffuse H$\\alpha$ emission and, to a\nlesser extent, H$\\beta$, [OIII]$\\lambda5007$, and [OI]$\\lambda6300$. By\ncomparing the kinematics and distribution of gas and stars (as traced by the\nCaII triplet) for both galaxies, we separate the ionized gas, as traced by the\nH$\\alpha$ line, in a component still bound to the galaxy and a component that\nis stripped. We find that the \"onboard\" component shows low velocity dispersion\nand line ratios consistent with photoionization by hot stars. The stripped gas\nis more turbulent, with velocity dispersions up to > 100 km/s}, and is excited\nby shocks as traced by high values of [OI]/H$\\alpha$ and [NII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio.\nIn the tail of UGC 6697 we identify numerous bright compact knots with line\nratios typical of HII regions. These are distributed along the only streams of\nstripped gas retaining low velocity dispersions (< 35 km/s). Despite being in\nthe stripped gas, their physical properties do not differentiate from normal\nHII regions in galactic disks. We find evidence of a past fast encounter\nbetween the two galaxies in the form of a double tail emerging from CGCG 97087N\nthat connects with UGC 6697. This encounter might have increased the efficiency\nof the stripping process, leaving the stellar distribution and kinematics\nunaltered.\n", "  We show how the massive data compression algorithm MOPED can be used to\nreduce, by orders of magnitude, the number of simulated datasets that are\nrequired to estimate the covariance matrix required for the analysis of\ngaussian-distributed data. This is relevant when the covariance matrix cannot\nbe calculated directly. The compression is especially valuable when the\ncovariance matrix varies with the model parameters. In this case, it may be\nprohibitively expensive to run enough simulations to estimate the full\ncovariance matrix throughout the parameter space. This compression may be\nparticularly valuable for the next-generation of weak lensing surveys, such as\nproposed for Euclid and LSST, for which the number of summary data (such as\nband power or shear correlation estimates) is very large, $\\sim 10^4$, due to\nthe large number of tomographic redshift bins that the data will be divided\ninto. In the pessimistic case where the covariance matrix is estimated\nseparately for all points in an MCMC analysis, this may require an unfeasible\n$10^9$ simulations. We show here that MOPED can reduce this number by a factor\nof 1000, or a factor of $\\sim 10^6$ if some regularity in the covariance matrix\nis assumed, reducing the number of simulations required to a manageable $10^3$,\nmaking an otherwise intractable analysis feasible.\n", "  Double field theory yields a formulation of the low-energy effective action\nof bosonic string theory and half-maximal supergravities that is covariant\nunder the T-duality group O$(d,d)$ emerging on a torus $T^d$. Upon reduction to\nthree spacetime dimensions and dualisation of vector fields into scalars, the\nsymmetry group is enhanced to O$(d+1,d+1)$. We construct an enhanced double\nfield theory with internal coordinates in the adjoint representation of\nO$(d+1,d+1)$. Its section constraints admit two inequivalent solutions,\nencoding in particular the embedding of $D=6$ chiral and non-chiral theories,\nrespectively. As an application we define consistent generalized Scherk-Schwarz\nreductions using a novel notion of generalized parallelization. This allows us\nto prove the consistency of the truncations of $D=6$, ${\\cal N}=(1,1)$ and\n$D=6$, ${\\cal N}=(2,0)$ supergravity on AdS$_3\\times \\mathbb{S}^3$.\n", "  We investigate the efficiency of an isothermal Brownian work-to-work\nconverter engine, composed of a Brownian particle coupled to a heat bath at a\nconstant temperature. The system is maintained out of equilibrium by using two\nexternal time-dependent stochastic Gaussian forces, where one is called load\nforce and the other is called drive force. Work done by these two forces are\nstochastic quantities. The efficiency of this small engine is defined as the\nratio of stochastic work done against load force to stochastic work done by the\ndrive force. The probability density function as well as large deviation\nfunction of the stochastic efficiency are studied analytically and verified by\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  The isoscalar monopole response of neutron-rich nuclei is sensitive to both\nthe incompressibility coefficient of symmetric nuclear matter and the density\ndependence of the symmetry energy. The main goal of this paper is to explore\nthe emergence, evolution, and origin of low energy monopole strength along the\neven-even calcium isotopes: from 40Ca to 60Ca. The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is\nadopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any\nreliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of\nlow-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is\nbeing filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows. Further, in\ncontrast to experimental findings, a mild softening of the monopole response\nwith increasing mass number is predicted. Beyond 48Ca, a significant amount of\nlow-energy monopole strength emerges as soon as the weak-binding neutron\norbitals (2p and 1f5/2) become populated. The emergence and evolution of\nlow-energy strength is identified with transitions from these weakly-bound\nstates into the continuum. Moreover, given that models with a soft symmetry\nenergy tend to reach the neutron-drip line earlier than their stiffer\ncounterparts, we identify an inverse correlation between the neutron-skin\nthickness and the inverse energy weighted sum.\n", "  We report the emergence of electronic edge states in time-periodically driven\nstrained armchair terminated graphene nanoribbons. This is done by considering\na short-pulse spatial-periodic strain field. Then, the tight-binding\nHamiltonian of the system is mapped into a one dimensional ladder. The time\nperiodicity is considered within the Floquet formalism. Thus the quasienergy\nspectrum is found numerically by diagonalizing the evolution operator. For some\nparticular cases, the quasienergy spectrum is found analytically. We find that\nthe system is able to support gapless and gapped phases. Very different edge\nstates emerge for both the gapless and the gapful phases. In the case of the\ngapped phase, edge states emerge at the gap centered at zero quasienergy,\nalthough the Chern number is zero due to the chiral symmetry of the system. For\nthe gapless phase, besides edge states at zero quasienergy, cosine like edge\nstates which merge and coexist with the bulk band are observed. To confirm the\ntopological nature of these edge states, we analytically obtained the effective\nHamiltonian and its spectrum for a particular case, finding that the edge\nstates are topologically weak. Finally, we found analytically the evolution of\nband edges and its crossings as a function of the driven period. Topological\nmodes arise at such crossings.\n", "  The main aim of this work is to determine the solar differential rotation by\ntracing sunspot groups during the period 1964-2016, using the Kanzelh\\\"ohe\nObservatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO) sunspot drawings and\nwhite light images. Two procedures for the determination of the heliographic\npositions were applied: an interactive procedure on the KSO sunspot drawings\n(1964 - 2008, solar cycles nos. 20 - 23) and an automatic procedure on the KSO\nwhite light images (2009 - 2016, solar cycle no. 24). For the determination of\nthe synodic angular rotation velocities two different methods have been used: a\ndaily shift (DS) method and a robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) method.\nAfterwards, the rotation velocities had to be converted from synodic to\nsidereal, which were then used in the least-squares fitting for the solar\ndifferential rotation law. For the test data from 2014, we found the rLSQ\nmethod for calculating rotational velocities to be more reliable than the DS\nmethod. The best fit solar differential rotation profile for the whole time\nperiod is $\\omega(b)$ = (14.47 $\\pm$ 0.01) - (2.66 $\\pm$ 0.10) $\\sin^2b$\n(deg/day) for the DS method and $\\omega(b)$ = (14.50 $\\pm$ 0.01) - (2.87 $\\pm$\n0.12) $\\sin^2b$ (deg/day) for the rLSQ method. A barely noticeable north -\nsouth asymmetry is observed for the whole time period 1964 - 2016 in the\npresent paper. Rotation profiles, using different data sets (e.g. Debrecen\nPhotoheliographic Data, Greenwich Photoheliographic Results), presented by\nother authors for the same time periods and the same tracer types, are in good\nagreement with our results. Therefore, the KSO data set is suitable for the\ninvestigation of the long-term variabilities in the solar rotation profile.\n", "  We show the AdS/CFT correspondence between the conformal partial wave and the\ngeodesic Witten diagram with anti-symmetric exchange. To this end, we introduce\nthe embedding space formalism for anti-symmetric fields in AdS. Then we prove\nthat the geodesic Witten diagram satisfies the conformal Casimir equation and\nthe appropriate boundary condition. Furthermore, we discuss the connection\nbetween the geodesic Witten diagram and the shadow formalism by using the split\nrepresentation of harmonic function for anti-symmetric fields. We also discuss\nthe 3pt geodesic Witten diagrams and its extension to the mixed-symmetric\ntensors.\n", "  Transiting super-Earths orbiting bright stars in short orbital periods are\ninteresting targets for the study of planetary atmospheres. While selecting\nsuper-Earths suitable for further characterization from the ground among a list\nof confirmed and validated exoplanets detected by K2, we found some suspicious\ncases that led to us re-assessing the nature of the detected transiting signal.\nWe did a photometric analysis of the K2 light curves and centroid motions of\nthe photometric barycenters. Our study shows that the validated planets K2-78b,\nK2-82b, and K2-92b are actually not planets but background eclipsing binaries.\nThe eclipsing binaries are inside the Kepler photometric aperture, but outside\nthe ground-based high resolution images used for validation. We advise extreme\ncare on the validation of candidate planets discovered by space missions. It is\nimportant that all the assumptions in the validation process are carefully\nchecked. An independent confirmation is mandatory in order to avoid wasting\nvaluable resources on further characterization of non-existent targets.\n", "  The latest MERRA-2 reanalysis of the modern satellite measurements provides\nunprecedented uniformity and fidelity for the atmospheric data. In this paper,\nthese data are used to evaluate five sites for millimeter-wave (mm-wave)\nobservations. These include two established sites (South Pole and Chajnantor,\nAtacama), and three new sites (Ali, Tibet; Dome A, Antarctica; and Summit Camp,\nGreenland). Atmospheric properties including precipitable water vapor (PWV),\nsky brightness temperature fluctuations, ice and liquid water paths are derived\nand compared. Dome A emerges to be the best among those evaluated, with PWV and\nfluctuations smaller than the second-best site, South Pole, by more than a\nfactor of 2. It is found that the higher site in Ali (6,100 m) is on par with\nCerro Chajnantor (5,612 m) in terms of transmission and stability. The lower\nsite in Ali (5,250 m) planned for first stage of observations at 90/150GHz\nprovides conditions comparable to those on the Chajnantor Plateau. These\nanalyses confirm Ali to be an excellent mm-wave site on the Northern Hemisphere\nthat will complement well-established sites on the Southern Hemisphere. It is\nalso found in this analysis that the observing conditions at Summit Camp are\ncomparable to Cerro Chajnantor. Although it is more affected by the presence of\nliquid water clouds.\n", "  Optical conductivity (OC) can serve as a measure of correlation effects in a\nwide range of condensed matter systems. We here show that the long-range tail\nof the Coulomb interaction yields a universal correction to the OC in a\nthree-dimensional Weyl semimetal $\\sigma(\\Omega)=\\sigma_0(\\Omega)\\left[\n1+\\frac{1}{N+1} \\right]$, where of $\\sigma_0(\\Omega)=Ne^2_0 \\Omega/(12 h v)$ is\nthe OC in the non-interacting system, with $v$ as the actual (renormalized)\nFermi velocity of Weyl quasiparticles at frequency $\\Omega$, and $e_0$ is the\nelectron charge in vacuum. Such universal enhancement of OC, which depends only\non the number of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level ($N$), is a remarkable\nconsequence of an intriguing conspiracy among the quantum-critical nature of an\ninteracting Weyl liquid, marginal irrelevance of the long-range Coulomb\ninteraction and the violation of hyperscaling in three dimensions, and can\ndirectly be measured in recently discovered Weyl as well as Dirac materials. By\ncontrast, a local density-density interaction produces a non-universal\ncorrection to the OC, stemming from the non-renormalizable nature of the\ncorresponding interacting field theory.\n", "  We present a numerical and theoretical study that supports and explains\nrecent experimental results on anomalous magnetization fluctuations of a\nuniaxial ferromagnetic film in its low-temperature phase, which is forced by an\noscillating field above the critical period of the associated dynamic phase\ntransition (DPT) [P. Riego, P. Vavassori, A. Berger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118,\n117202 (2017)]. For this purpose, we perform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of\na two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions\nin the presence of a sinusoidally oscillating field, to which is added a\nconstant bias field. We study a large range of system sizes and supercritical\nperiods and analyze the data using a droplet-theoretical description of\nmagnetization switching. We find that the period-averaged magnetization, which\nplays the role of the order parameter for the DPT, presents large fluctuations\nthat give rise to well-defined peaks in its scaled variance and its\nsusceptibility with respect to the bias field. The peaks are symmetric with\nrespect to zero bias and located at values of the bias field that increase\ntoward the field amplitude as an inverse logarithm of the field oscillation\nperiod. Our results indicate that this effect is independent of the system size\nfor large systems, ruling out critical behavior associated with a phase\ntransition. Rather, it is a stochastic-resonance phenomenon that has no\ncounterpart in the corresponding thermodynamic phase transition, providing a\nreminder that the equivalence of the DPT to an equilibrium phase transition is\nlimited to the critical region near the critical period and zero bias.\n", "  The $\\alpha+d\\rightarrow\\, ^6{\\rm Li}+\\gamma$ radiative capture is studied in\norder to predict the $^6$Li primordial abundance. Within a two-body framework,\nthe $\\alpha$ particle and the deuteron are considered the structureless\nconstituents of $^6$Li. Five $\\alpha+d$ potentials are used to solve the\ntwo-body problem: four of them are taken from the literature, only one having\nalso a tensor component. A fifth model is here constructed in order to\nreproduce, besides the $^6$Li static properties as binding energy, magnetic\ndipole and electric quadrupole moments, also the $S$-state asymptotic\nnormalization coefficient (ANC). The two-body bound and scattering problem is\nsolved with different techniques, in order to minimize the numerical\nuncertainty of the present results. The long-wavelength approximation is used,\nand therefore only the electric dipole and quadrupole operators are retained.\nThe astrophysical $S$-factor is found to be significantly sensitive to the ANC,\nbut in all the cases in good agreement with the available experimental data.\nThe theoretical uncertainty has been estimated of the order of few % when the\npotentials which reproduce the ANC are considered, but increases up to $\\simeq\n20$ % when all the five potential models are retained. The effect of this\n$S$-factor prediction on the $^6$Li primordial abundance is studied, using the\npublic code PArthENoPE. For the five models considered here we find $^6{\\rm\nLi}/$H$ = (0.9 - 1.8) \\times 10^{-14}$, with the baryon density parameter in\nthe 3-$\\sigma$ range of Planck 2015 analysis, $\\Omega_b h^2= 0.02226 \\pm\n0.00023$.\n", "  According to the extensive theoretical and experimental investigations, it is\nwidely accepted that the long-range Coulomb interaction is too weak to generate\na dynamical excitonic gap in graphene with a perfect Dirac cone. We study the\nimpact of the deformation of Dirac cone on dynamical gap generation. When a\nuniaxial strain is applied to graphene, the Dirac cone is made elliptical in\nthe equal-energy plane and the fermion velocity becomes anisotropic. The\napplied uniaxial strain has two effects: it decreases the fermion velocity; it\nincreases the velocity anisotropy. After solving the Dyson-Schwinger gap\nequation, we show that dynamical gap generation is promoted by the former\neffect, but is suppressed by the latter one. For suspended graphene, we find\nthat the systems undergoes an excitonic insulating transition when the strain\nis roughly 7.34$\\%$. We also solve the gap equation in case the Dirac cone is\ntiled, which might be realized in the organic material\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$I$_{3}$, and find that the tilt of Dirac cone can\nsuppress dynamical gap generation. It turns out that the geometry of the Dirac\ncone plays an important role in the formation of excitonic pairing.\n", "  The Enskog kinetic theory for moderately dense gas-solid suspensions under\nsimple shear flow is considered as a model to analyze the rheological\nproperties of the system. The influence of the environmental fluid on solid\nparticles is modeled via a viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like\nterm. The Enskog equation is solved by means of two independent but\ncomplementary routes: (i) Grad's moment method and (ii) event-driven Langevin\nsimulation of hard spheres. Both approaches clearly show that the flow curve\n(stress-strain rate relation) depends significantly on the volume fraction of\nthe solid particles. In particular, as the density increases, there is a\ntransition from the discontinuous shear thickening (observed in dilute gases)\nto the continuous shear thickening for denser systems. The comparison between\ntheory and simulations indicate that while the theoretical predictions for the\nkinetic temperature agree well with simulations for densities $\\varphi \\lesssim\n0.5$, the agreement for the other rheological quantities (the viscosity, the\nstress ratio and the normal stress differences) is limited to more moderate\ndensities ($\\varphi \\lesssim 0.3$) if the inelasticity during collisions\nbetween particles is not large.\n", "  Recently a new family of Cr-based A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs) superconductors\nwere reported, which own a rare quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure\nwith infinite (Cr3As3)2- chains and exhibit intriguing superconducting\ncharacteristics possibly derived from spin-triplet electron pairing. The\ncrystal structure of A2Cr3As3 is actually a slight variation of the hexagonal\nTlFe3Te3 prototype although they have different lattice symmetry. Here we\nreport superconductivity in a 133-type KCr3As3 compound that belongs to the\nlatter structure. The single crystals of KCr3As3 were prepared by the\ndeintercalation of K ions from K2Cr3As3 crystals which were grown from a\nhigh-temperature solution growth method, and it owns a centrosymmetric lattice\nin contrast to the non-centrosymmetric K2Cr3As3. After annealing at a moderate\ntemperature, the KCr3As3 crystals show bulk superconductivity at 5 K revealed\nby electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity\nmeasurements. The discovery of this KCr3As3 superconductor provides a different\nstructural instance to study the exotic superconductivity in these Q1D Cr-based\nsuperconductors.\n", "  The three dimensional structure, dynamics and dispersion characteristics of a\nsimulated upwelling filament in the Iberian upwelling system are analyzed using\nLagrangian tools. We used a realistic regional simulation of the western\nIberian shelf which is concomitant with an in-situ oceanographic campaign that\nsurveyed the area. We compute 3d fields of finite--size Lyapunov exponents\n(FSLE) from 3d velocity fields and extract the field's ridges to study the\nspatial distribution and temporal evolution of the Lagrangian Coherent\nStructures (LCSs) evolving around the filament. We find that the most intense\ncurtain-like LCSs delimit the boundaries of the whole filamentary structure\nwhose general properties match well the observations. The filament interior is\ncharacterized by small dispersion of fluid elements. Furthermore, we identify a\nweak LCS separating the filament into a warmer vein and a colder filament\nassociated with the interaction of a mesoscale eddy with the upwelling front.\nThe cold upwelled water parcels move along the filament conserving their\ndensity. The filament itself is characterized by small dispersion of fluid\nelements in its interior. The comparison of LCSs with potential temperature and\nsalinity gradient fields shows that the outer limits of the filament coincide\nwith regions of large hydrographic gradients, similar to those observed,\nexplaining the isolation of the interior of the filament with the surrounding\nwaters. We conclude that the Lagrangian analysis used in this work is useful in\nexplaining the dynamics of cross-shore exchanges of materials between coastal\nregions and the open ocean due to mesoscale processes.\n", "  Conserved lattice gas (CLG) models in one dimension exhibit absorbing state\nphase transition (APT) with simple integer exponents $\\beta=1=\\nu=\\eta$ whereas\nthe same on a ladder belong to directed percolation (DP)universality. We\nconjecture that additional stochasticity in particle transfer is a relevant\nperturbation and its presence on a ladder force the APT to be in DP class. To\nsubstantiate this we introduce a class of restricted conserved lattice gas\nmodels on a multi-chain system ($M\\times L$ square lattice with periodic\nboundary condition in both directions), where particles which have exactly one\nvacant neighbor are active and they move deterministically to the neighboring\nvacant site. We show that for odd number of chains , in the thermodynamic limit\n$L \\to \\infty,$ these models exhibit APT at $\\rho_c= \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac1M)$\nwith $\\beta =1.$ On the other hand, for even-chain systems transition occurs at\n$\\rho_c=\\frac12$ with $\\beta=1,2$ for $M=2,4$ respectively, and $\\beta= 3$ for\n$M\\ge6.$ We illustrate this unusual critical behavior analytically using a\ntransfer matrix method.\n", "  We study the laser-driven Dicke model beyond the rotating-wave approximation.\nFor weak coupling of the system to environmental degrees of freedom the\ndissipative dynamics of the emitter-cavity system is described by the Floquet\nmaster equation. Projection of the system evolution onto the emitter degrees of\nfreedom results in non-Markovian behavior. We quantify the non-Markovianity of\nthe resulting emitter dynamics and show that this quantity can be used as an\nindicator of the dissipative quantum phase transition occurring at high driving\namplitudes.\n", "  From ESO VLT/FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra, abundance measurements of Zn have been\nmade in $\\approx$100 individual red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Sculptor\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy. This is the largest sample of individual Zn abundance\nmeasurements within a stellar system beyond the Milky Way. In the observed\nmetallicity range, $-2.7\\leq\\text{[Fe/H]}\\leq-0.9$, the general trend of Zn\nabundances in Sculptor is similar to that of $\\alpha$-elements. That is,\nsuper-solar abundance ratios of [Zn/Fe] at low metallicities, which decrease\nwith increasing [Fe/H], eventually reaching subsolar values. However, at the\nhigher metallicities in Sculptor, $\\text{[Fe/H]}\\gtrsim-1.8$, we find a\nsignificant scatter, $-0.8\\lesssim\\text{[Zn/Fe]}\\lesssim+0.4$, which is not\nseen in any $\\alpha$-element. Our results are consistent with previous\nobservations of a limited number of stars in Sculptor and in other dwarf\ngalaxies. These results suggest that zinc has a complex nucleosynthetic origin,\nbehaving neither completely like an $\\alpha$- nor an iron-peak element.\n", "  Distinguishing the Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos remains one of the\nmost important tasks in neutrino physics. By assuming that the $\\tau^- \\to\n\\pi^- \\mu^- e^+ \\nu$ (or $\\bar{\\nu}$) decay is resonantly enhanced by the\nexchange of an intermediate mass sterile neutrino $N$, we show that the energy\nspectrum of emitted pions and muons can be used to easily distinguish between\nthe Dirac and Majorana nature of $N$. This method takes advantage of the fact\nthat the flavor of light neutrinos is not identified in the tau decay under\nconsideration. We find that it is particularly advantageous, because of no\ncompeting background events, to search for $N$ in the mass range $m_e + m_{\\mu}\n\\leqslant m_N \\leqslant m_{\\mu} + m_{\\pi}$, where $m_X$ denotes the mass of\nparticle $X \\in \\{ e, \\mu, \\pi, N \\}$.\n", "  The structural phase transitions of MF$_3$ (M=Al, Cr, V, Fe, Ti, Sc) metal\ntrifluorides are studied within a simple Landau theory consisting of tilts of\nrigid MF$_6$ octahedra associated with soft antiferrodistoritive optic modes\nthat are coupled to long-wavelength strain generating acoustic phonons. We\ncalculate the temperature and pressure dependence of several quantities such as\nthe spontaneous distortions, volume expansion and shear strains as well as\n$T-P$ phase diagrams. By contrasting our model to experiments we quantify the\ndeviations from mean-field behavior and found that the tilt fluctuations of the\nMF$_6$ octahedra increase with metal cation size. We apply our model to predict\ngiant barocaloric effects in Sc substituted TiF$_3$ of up to about\n$15\\,$JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$ for modest hydrostatic compressions of $0.2\\,$GPa. The\neffect extends over a wide temperature range of over $140\\,$K (including room\ntemperature) due to a large predicted rate $dT_c/dP = 723\\,$K GPa$^{-1}$, which\nexceeds those of typical barocaloric materials. Our results suggest that open\nlattice frameworks such as the trifluorides are an attractive platform to\nsearch for giant barocaloric effects.\n", "  In order to inquire the microscopic origin of observed multiple time scales\nin solvation dynamics we carry out several computer experiments. We perform\natomistic molecular dynamics simulations on three protein-water systems namely,\nLysozyme, Myoglobin and sweet protein Monellin. In these experiments we mutate\nthe charges of the neighbouring amino acid side chains of certain natural\nprobes (Tryptophan) and also freeze the side chain motions. In order to\ndistinguish between different contributions, we decompose the total solvation\nenergy response in terms of various components present in the system. This\nallows us to capture the interplay among different self and cross-energy\ncorrelation terms. Freezing the protein motions removes the slowest component\nthat results from side chain fluctuations, but a part of slowness remains. This\nleads to the conclusion that the slow component in the ~20-80 ps range arises\nfrom slow water molecules present in the hydration layer. While the more than\n100 ps component may arise from various sources namely, adjacent charges in\namino acid side chains, the water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to them\nand a dynamically coupled motion between side chain and water. The charges, in\naddition, enforce a structural ordering of nearby water molecules and helps to\nform local long-lived hydrogen bonded network. Further separation of the\nspatial and temporal responses in solvation dynamics reveals different roles of\nhydration and bulk water. We find that the hydration layer water molecules are\nlargely responsible for the slow component whereas the initial ultrafast decay\narise predominantly (~80%) due to the bulk. This agrees with earlier\ntheoretical observations. We also attempt to rationalise our results with the\nhelp of a molecular hydrodynamic theory that was developed using classical time\ndependent density functional theory in a semi quantitative manner.\n", "  We propose a model for CP violating oscillations of neutral, heavy-flavored\nbaryons into antibaryons at rates which are within a few orders of magnitude of\ntheir lifetimes. The flavor structure of the baryon violation suppresses\nneutron oscillations and baryon number violating nuclear decays to\nexperimentally allowed rates. We also propose a scenario for producing such\nbaryons in the early Universe via the out-of-equilibrium decays of a neutral\nparticle, after hadronization but before nucleosynthesis. We find parameters\nwhere CP violating baryon oscillations at a temperature of a few MeV could\nresult in the observed asymmetry between baryons and antibaryons. Furthermore,\npart of the relevant parameter space for baryogenesis is potentially testable\nat Belle II via decays of heavy flavor baryons into an exotic neutral fermion.\nThe model introduces four new particles: three light Majorana fermions and a\ncolored scalar. The lightest of these fermions is typically long lived on\ncollider timescales and may be produced in decays of bottom and possibly\ncharmed hadrons.\n", "  Context: HD 54879 (O9.7 V) is one of a dozen O-stars for which an organized\natmospheric magnetic field has been detected. To gain insights into the\ninterplay between atmospheres, winds, and magnetic fields of massive stars, we\nacquired UV and X-ray data of HD 54879 using the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nXMM-Newton satellite. In addition, 35 optical amateur spectra were secured to\nstudy the variability of HD 54879. A multiwavelength (X-ray to optical)\nspectral analysis is performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model\natmosphere code and the xspec software.\n  Results: The photospheric parameters are typical for an O9.7 V star. The\nmicroturbulent, macroturbulent, and projected rotational velocities are lower\nthan previously suggested (<4 km/s). An initial mass of 16$\\,M_\\odot$ and an\nage of 5 Myr are inferred from evolutionary tracks. We derive a mean X-ray\nemitting temperature of $\\log T_{\\rm X} = 6.7\\,$[K] and an X-ray luminosity of\n$\\log L_\\text{X} = 32\\,$[erg/s]. Short- and long-scale variability is seen in\nthe H-alpha line, but only a very long period of $P \\approx 5\\,$yr could be\nestimated. Assessing the circumstellar density of HD 54879 using UV spectra, we\ncan roughly estimate the mass-loss rate HD 54879 would have in the absence of a\nmagnetic field as $\\log \\dot{M}_{B=0}\\approx -9.0\\,[{M_\\odot}/{\\rm yr}]$. The\nmagnetic field traps the stellar wind up to the Alfv\\'en radius >\n$12\\,R_\\odot$, implying that its true mass-loss rate is $\\log \\dot{M}<\n-10.2\\,[{M_\\odot}/{\\rm yr}]$. Hence, density enhancements around magnetic stars\ncan be exploited to estimate mass-loss rates of non-magnetic stars of similar\nspectral types, essential for resolving the weak wind problem.\n  Conclusions: Our study confirms that strongly magnetized stars lose little or\nno mass, and supplies important constraints on the weak-wind problem of massive\nmain sequence stars.\n", "  The carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are largely\nunidentified molecules ubiquitously present in the interstellar medium (ISM).\nAfter decades of study, two strong and possibly three weak near-infrared DIBs\nhave recently been attributed to the C60+ fullerene based on observational and\nlaboratory measurements. There is great promise for the identification of the\nover 400 other known DIBs, as this result could provide chemical hints towards\nother possible carriers.\n  In an effort to systematically study the properties of the DIB carriers, we\nhave initiated a new large-scale observational survey: the ESO Diffuse\nInterstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES). The main objective is to\nbuild on and extend existing DIB surveys to make a major step forward in\ncharacterising the physical and chemical conditions for a statistically\nsignificant sample of interstellar lines-of-sight, with the goal to\nreverse-engineer key molecular properties of the DIB carriers.\n  EDIBLES is a filler Large Programme using the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle\nSpectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Paranal, Chile. It is designed to\nprovide an observationally unbiased view of the presence and behaviour of the\nDIBs towards early-spectral-type stars whose lines-of-sight probe the\ndiffuse-to-translucent ISM. Such a complete dataset will provide a deep census\nof the atomic and molecular content, physical conditions, chemical abundances\nand elemental depletion levels for each sightline. Achieving these goals\nrequires a homogeneous set of high-quality data in terms of resolution (R ~\n70000 -- 100000), sensitivity (S/N up to 1000 per resolution element), and\nspectral coverage (305--1042 nm), as well as a large sample size (100+\nsightlines). In this first paper the goals, objectives and methodology of the\nEDIBLES programme are described and an initial assessment of the data is\nprovided.\n", "  The Zwicky Transient Facility is a new robotic-observing program, in which a\nnewly engineered 600-MP digital camera with a pioneeringly large field of view,\n47~square degrees, will be installed into the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope\nat the Palomar Observatory. The camera will generate $\\sim 1$~petabyte of raw\nimage data over three years of operations. In parallel related work, new\nhardware and software systems are being developed to process these data in real\ntime and build a long-term archive for the processed products. The first public\nrelease of archived products is planned for early 2019, which will include\nprocessed images and astronomical-source catalogs of the northern sky in the\n$g$ and $r$ bands. Source catalogs based on two different methods will be\ngenerated for the archive: aperture photometry and point-spread-function\nfitting.\n", "  Electronic structure calculations are used to examine the magnetic properties\nof Fe$_2$P-based alloys and the mechanisms through which the Curie temperature\nand magnetocrystalline anisotropy can be optimized for specific applications.\nIt is found that at elevated temperatures the magnetic interaction in pure\nFe$_2$P develops a pronounced two-dimensional character due to the suppression\nof the magnetization in one of the sublattices, but the interlayer coupling is\nvery sensitive to band filling and structural distortions. This feature\nsuggests a natural explanation of the observed sharp enhancement of the Curie\ntemperature by alloying with multiple elements, such as Co, Ni, Si, and B. The\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy is also tunable by electron doping, reaching a\nmaximum near the electron count of pure Fe$_2$P. These findings enable the\noptimization of the alloy content, suggesting co-alloying of Fe$_2$P with Co\n(or Ni) and Si as a strategy for maximizing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy\nat and above room temperature.\n", "  We investigate the electronic properties of $N$-layer black phosphorus by\nmeans of an analytical method based on a recently proposed tight-binding\nHamiltonian involving $14$ hopping parameters. The method provides simple and\naccurate general expressions for the Hamiltonian of $N$-layer phosphorene,\nwhich are suitable for the study of electronic transport and optical properties\nof such systems, and the results show the features that emerge as the number of\nlayers increases. In addition, we show that the $N$-layer problem can be\ntranslated into $N$ effective monolayer problems in the long wavelength\napproximation and, within this analytical picture, we obtain expressions for\nthe energy gap and the effective masses for electrons and holes along the\n$N$-layer black phosphorus plane directions as function of the number of\nlayers, as well as for the Landau levels as function of perpendicular magnetic\nfield.\n", "  There are a number of observational hints from astrophysics which point to\nthe existence of stellar energy losses beyond the ones accounted for by\nneutrino emission. These excessive energy losses may be explained by the\nexistence of a new sub-keV mass pseudoscalar Nambu--Goldstone boson with tiny\ncouplings to photons, electrons, and nucleons. An attractive possibility is to\nidentify this particle with the axion -- the hypothetical pseudo\nNambu--Goldstone boson predicted by the Peccei--Quinn solution to the strong CP\nproblem. We explore this possibility in terms of a DFSZ-type axion and of a\nKSVZ-type axion/majoron, respectively. Both models allow a good global fit to\nthe data, prefering an axion mass around 10 meV. We show that future axion\nexperiments -- the fifth force experiment ARIADNE and the helioscope IAXO --\ncan attack the preferred mass range from the lower and higher end,\nrespectively. An axion in this mass range can also be the main constituent of\ndark matter.\n", "  We perform Raman spectroscopy of optically trapped non interacting \\Rb atoms,\nand observe revivals of the atomic coherence at integer multiples of the trap\nperiod. The effect of coherence control methods such as echo and dynamical\ndecoupling is investigated experimentally, analytically and numerically, along\nwith the effect of the anharmonicity of the trapping potential. The latter is\nshown to be responsible for incompleteness of the revivals. Coherent Raman\ncontrol of trapped atoms can be useful in the context of free-oscillation atom\nintefrerometry and spatial multi-mode quantum memory.\n", "  The heliospheric magnetic field is of pivotal importance in solar and space\nphysics. The field is rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been\nobserved for many years. Global maps of the solar magnetic field based on full\ndisk magnetograms are commonly used as boundary conditions for coronal and\nsolar wind models. Two primary observational constraints on the models are (1)\nthe open field regions in the model should approximately correspond to coronal\nholes observed in emission, and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in\nthe model should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In\nthis study, we calculate both MHD and PFSS solutions using fourteen different\nmagnetic maps produced from five different types of observatory magnetograms,\nfor the time period surrounding July, 2010. We have found that for all of the\nmodel/map combinations, models that have coronal hole areas close to\nobservations underestimate the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely,\nfor models to match the interplanetary flux, the modeled open field regions are\nlarger than coronal holes observed in EUV emission. In an alternative approach,\nwe estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by\ncombining automatically detected coronal holes for Carrington rotation 2098\nwith observatory synoptic magnetic maps. This approach also underestimates the\ninterplanetary magnetic flux. Our results imply that either typical observatory\nmaps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux, or a significant portion of the\nopen magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark in EUV and\nX-ray emission.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of testing supergravity unified models with\nscalar masses in the range 50-100 TeV and much lighter gaugino masses at the\nLarge Hadron Collider. The analysis is carried out under the constraints that\nmodels produce the Higgs boson mass consistent with experiment and also produce\ndark matter consistent with WMAP and PLANCK experiments. A set of benchmarks in\nthe supergravity parameter space are investigated using a combination of signal\nregions which are optimized for the model set. It is found that some of the\nmodels with scalar masses in the 50-100 TeV mass range are discoverable with as\nlittle as 100 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and should be accessible at\nthe LHC RUN II. The remaining benchmark models are found to be discoverable\nwith less than 1000 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and thus testable in the\nhigh luminosity era of the LHC, i.e., at HL-LHC. It is shown that scalar masses\nin the 50-100 TeV range but gaugino masses much lower in mass produce\nunification of gauge coupling constants, consistent with experimental data at\nlow scale, with as good an accuracy (and sometimes even better) as models with\nlow ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV) weak scale supersymmetry. Decay of the gravitinos\nfor the supergravity model benchmarks are investigated and it is shown that\nthey decay before the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Further, we investigate\nthe non-thermal production of neutralinos from gravitino decay and it is found\nthat the non-thermal contribution to the dark matter relic density is\nnegligible relative to that from the thermal production of neutralinos for\nreheat temperature after inflation up to $10^9$ GeV. An analysis of the direct\ndetection of dark matter for SUGRA models with high scalar masses is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We have obtained new NASA IRTF SpeX spectra of the HR 4796A debris ring\nsystem. We find a unique red excess flux that extends out to ~9 um in Spitzer\nIRS spectra, where thermal emission from cold, ~100K dust from the system's\nring at ~75 AU takes over. Matching imaging ring photometry, we find the excess\nconsists of NIR reflectance from the ring which is as red as that of old,\nprocessed comet nuclei, plus a tenuous thermal emission component from\nclose-in, T ~ 850 K circumstellar material evincing an organic plus silicate\nemission feature complex at 7 - 13 um. Unusual, emission-like features due to\natomic Si, S, Ca, and Sr were found at 0.96 - 1.07 um, likely sourced by rocky\ndust evaporating in the 850 K component. An empirical cometary dust phase\nfunction can reproduce the scattered light excess and 1:5 balance of scattered\nvs. thermal energy for the ring with optical depth Tau > 0.10 in an 8 AU wide\nbelt of 4 AU vertical height and Mdust > 0.1-0.7 M_Mars. Our results are\nconsistent with HR 4796A consisting of a narrow sheparded ring of devolatilized\ncometary material associated with multiple rocky planetesimal subcores, and a\nsmall steady stream of dust inflowing from this belt to a rock sublimation zone\nat approximately 1 AU from the primary. These subcores were built from comets\nthat have been actively emitting large, reddish dust for > 0.4 Myr at 100K, the\ntemperature at which cometary activity onset is seen in our Solar System.\n", "  The analysis of signals in directional dark matter (DM) detectors typically\nassumes that the directions of nuclear recoils can be measured in the Galactic\nrest frame. However, this is not possible with all directional detection\ntechnologies. In nuclear emulsions, for example, the recoil events must be\ndetected and measured after the exposure time of the experiment. Unless the\nentire detector is mounted and rotated with the sidereal day, the recoils\ncannot be reoriented in the Galactic rest frame. We examine the effect of this\n`time integration' on the primary goals of directional detection, namely: (1)\nconfirming that the recoils are anisotropic; (2) measuring the median recoil\ndirection to confirm their Galactic origin; and (3) probing below the neutrino\nfloor. We show that after time integration the DM recoil distribution retains a\npreferred direction and is distinct from that of Solar neutrino-induced\nrecoils. Many of the advantages of directional detection are therefore\npreserved and it is not crucial to mount and rotate the detector. Rejecting\nisotropic backgrounds requires a factor of 2 more signal events compared with\nan experiment with event time information, whereas a factor of 1.5-3 more\nevents are needed to measure a median direction in agreement with the\nexpectation for DM. We also find that there is still effectively no neutrino\nfloor in a time-integrated directional experiment. However to reach a cross\nsection an order of magnitude below the floor, a factor of 8 larger exposure is\nrequired than with a conventional directional experiment. We also examine how\nthe sensitivity is affected for detectors with only 2D recoil track readout,\nand/or no head-tail measurement. As for non-time-integrated experiments, 2D\nreadout is not a major disadvantage, though a lack of head-tail sensitivity is.\n", "  Potentially habitable planets can orbit close enough to their host star that\nthe differential gravity across their diameters can fix the rotation rate at a\nspecific frequency, a process called tidal locking. Tidally locked planets on\ncircular orbits will rotate synchronously, but those on eccentric orbits will\neither librate or rotate super-synchronously. I calculate how habitable planets\nevolve under two commonly-used models and find, for example, that one model\npredicts that the Earth's rotation rate would have synchronized after 4.5 Gyr\nif its initial rotation period was 3 days, it had no satellites, and it always\nmaintained the modern Earth's tidal properties. Lower mass stellar hosts will\ninduce stronger tidal effects on potentially habitable planets, and tidal\nlocking is possible for most planets in the habitable zones of GKM dwarf stars.\nFor fast rotating planets, both models predict eccentricity growth and that\ncircularization can only occur once the rotational frequency is similar to the\norbital frequency. The orbits of potentially habitable planets of very late M\ndwarfs (<0.15 solar masses) are very likely to be circularized within 1 Gyr and\nhence those planets will be synchronous rotators. Proxima b is almost assuredly\ntidally locked, but its orbit may not have circularized yet, so the planet\ncould be rotating super-synchronously today. The evolution of the isolated and\npotentially habitable Kepler planet candidates is computed and about half could\nbe tidally locked. Finally, projected TESS planets are simulated over a wide\nrange of assumptions, and the vast majority of all cases are found to tidally\nlock within 1 Gyr. These results suggest that the process of tidal locking is a\nmajor factor in the evolution of most of the potentially habitable exoplanets\nto be discovered in the near future. [abridged]\n", "  The verification of quantum entanglement under the influence of realistic\nnoise and decoherence is crucial for the development of quantum technologies.\nUnfortunately, a full entanglement characterization is generally not possible\nwith most entanglement criteria such as entanglement witnesses or the partial\ntransposition criterion. In particular, so called bound entanglement cannot be\ncertified via the partial transposition criterion. Here we present the full\nentanglement verification of dephased qubit and qutrit Werner states via\nentanglement quasiprobabilities. Remarkably, we are able to reveal bound\nentanglement for noisy-mixed states in the qutrit case. This example\ndemonstrates the strength of the entanglement quasiprobabilities for verifying\nthe full entanglement of quantum states suffering from noise.\n", "  We study the impact of anomalous gauge boson and fermion couplings on the\nproduction of $W^+W^-$ pairs at the LHC. Helicity amplitudes are presented\nseparately to demonstrate the sources of new physics contributions and the\nimpact of QCD and electroweak corrections. The QCD corrections have important\neffects on the fits to anomalous couplings, in particular when one $W$ boson is\nlongitudinally polarized and the other is transversely polarized. In effective\nfield theory language, we demonstrate that the dimension-6 approximation to\nconstraining new physics effects in $W^+W^-$ pair production fails at $p_T\\sim\n500-1000$ GeV.\n", "  The extrapolation technique of Savin [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A509 (2014)],\nwhich was initially applied to range-separated ground-state-density-functional\nHamiltonians, is adapted in this work to ghost-interaction-corrected (GIC)\nrange-separated ensemble density-functional theory (eDFT) for excited states.\nWhile standard extrapolations rely on energies that decay as $\\mu^{-2}$ in the\nlarge range-separation-parameter $\\mu$ limit, we show analytically that\n(approximate) range-separated GIC ensemble energies converge more rapidly (as\n$\\mu^{-3}$) towards their pure wavefunction theory values\n($\\mu\\rightarrow+\\infty$ limit), thus requiring a different extrapolation\ncorrection. The purpose of such a correction is to further improve on the\nconvergence and, consequently, to obtain more accurate excitation energies for\na finite (and, in practice, relatively small) $\\mu$ value. As a proof of\nconcept, we apply the extrapolation method to He and small molecular systems\n(viz. H$_{2}$, HeH$^{+}$ and LiH), thus considering different types of\nexcitations like Rydberg, charge transfer and double excitations. Potential\nenergy profiles of the first three and four singlet $\\Sigma^+$ excitation\nenergies in HeH$^{+}$ and H$_{2}$, respectively, are studied with a particular\nfocus on avoided crossings for the latter. Finally, the extraction of\nindividual state energies from the ensemble energy is discussed in the context\nof range-separated eDFT, as a perspective.\n", "  We present a deep imaging and spectroscopic survey of the Local Group\nirregular galaxy IC10 using Gemini North and GMOS to unveil its global\nWolf-Rayet (WR) population. We obtain a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.045 +/-\n0.023 Msun/yr, for IC10 from the nebular Halpha luminosity, which is comparable\nto the SMC. We also present a revised nebular oxygen abundance of log(O/H) + 12\n= 8.40 +/- 0.04, comparable to the LMC. It has previously been suggested that\nfor IC10 to follow the WR subtype-metallicity dependance seen in other Local\nGroup galaxies, a large WN population awaits discovery. Our search revealed 3\nnew WN stars, and 6 candidates awaiting confirmation, providing little evidence\nto support this claim. The new global WR star total of 29 stars is consistent\nwith the LMC population when scaled to the reduced SFR of IC10. For\nspectroscopically confirmed WR stars, the WC/WN ratio is lowered to 1.0,\nhowever including all potential candidates, and assuming those unconfirmed to\nbe WN stars, would reduce the ratio to ~0.7. We attribute the high WC/WN ratio\nto the high star formation surface density of IC10 relative to the Magellanic\nClouds, which enhances the frequency of high mass stars capable of producing WC\nstars.\n", "  Recently there has been interest in the correlation between R(D*) and the\nbranching ratio (BR) of $B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$ in models with a charged scalar\nH^\\pm. Any enhancement of R(D*) by $H^\\pm$ alone (in order to agree with\ncurrent data) also enhances $BR(B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$), for which there has been no\ndirect search at hadron colliders. We show that LEP data taken at the Z peak\nrequires BR($B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$) < 10%, and this constraint is significantly\nstronger than the recent constraint BR($B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$) < 30% from\nconsidering the lifetime of B_c. In order to respect this new constraint, any\nexplanation of the R(D) and R(D*) anomaly in terms of $H^\\pm$ alone would\nrequire the future measurements of R(D*) to be even closer to the Standard\nModel prediction. A stronger limit on BR($B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$) (or its first\nmeasurement) would be obtained if the L3 collaboration used all its data taken\nat the Z peak.\n", "  We present calculations for spin $ 1/2 $ fermions at unitarity limit, where\nthe effective range of the interaction is zero and the scattering length is\ninfinite. We compute the ground-state energy for a system of 6, 10,14,18 and 20\nparticles, with equal numbers of up and down spins in a periodic cube in the\nfull ground-state constrained-path Monte Carlo (CPMC) method using the\nextended, attractive Hubbard model. Our results in a careful extrapolation to\nthe thermodynamic limit may suggest that the ratio of the ground-state energy\nto that of a free Fermi gas is $ \\xi = 0.43(4) $, which can compare with recent\nexperimental results and consistent with the fixed node Green's function Monte\nCarlo and novel lattice approaches results. We also obtain results for\ninteractions with different effective ranges and find that the energy is\nconsistent with a universal linear dependence on the product of the Fermi\nmomentum and the effective range.\n", "  T-odd correlations in $Wj$ production at the LHC have been studied recently\nas a way to measure a phase produced by QCD at NLO by Frederix et. al. That\nstudy found that the induced asymmetry could be observed with 20 fb$^{-1}$ of 8\nTeV data. These T-odd asymmetries can also be induced by CP violating new\nphysics interfering with the SM at LO. In this paper we study this possibility\nusing effective Lagrangians to describe the new physics. We find that the\nleading contribution arises at dimension eight, and that it necessarily\nintroduces flavor changing neutral currents as well. We discuss the constraints\nthat can be placed on the flavor structure of the new physics operator from\nstudies of FCNC in kaon and B meson decays and then compare the T-odd\ncorrelations in $Wj$ induced by CP violating new physics to those induced by\nQCD at NLO. We quantify the level at which these couplings can be probed at the\nLHC, and find that they will not affect a measurement of the NLO QCD phases.\n", "  We develop and analyze an advanced concept for domain wall based sensing of\nrotations. Moving domain walls in n closed loops with n-1 intersecting\nconvolutions by rotating fields, we can sense n rotations. By combining loops\nwith coprime numbers of rotations, we create a sensor system allowing for the\ntotal counting of millions of turns of a rotating applied magnetic field. We\nanalyze the operation of the sensor and identify the intersecting cross\nstructures as the critical component for reliable operation. In particular\ndepending on the orientation of the applied field angle with the magnetization\nin the branches of the cross, a domain wall is found to propagate in an\nunwanted direction yielding failures and counting errors in the device. To\novercome this limiting factor, we introduce a specially designed syphon\nstructure to achieve the controlled pinning of the domain wall before the cross\nand depinning and propagation only for a selected range of applied field\nangles. By adjusting the syphon and the cross geometry, we find that the\noptimized combination of both structures prevents failures in the full sensor\nstructure yielding robust operation. Our modeling results show that the\noptimized element geometry allows for the realization of the sensor with\ncross-shaped intersections and operation that is tolerant to inaccuracies of\nthe fabrication.\n", "  We describe procedures for converging on and characterizing zero-energy\nFeshbach resonances that appear in scattering lengths as a function of an\nexternal field. The elastic procedure is appropriate for purely elastic\nscattering, where the scattering length is real and displays a true pole. The\nregularized scattering length (RSL) procedure is appropriate when there is weak\nbackground inelasticity, so that the scattering length is complex and displays\nan oscillation rather than a pole, but the resonant scattering length $a_{\\rm\nres}$ is close to real. The fully complex procedure is appropriate when there\nis substantial background inelasticity and the real and complex parts of\n$a_{\\rm res}$ are required. We demonstrate these procedures for scattering of\nultracold $^{85}$Rb in various initial states. All of them can converge on and\nprovide full characterization of resonances, from initial guesses many\nthousands of widths away, using scattering calculations at only about 10 values\nof the external field.\n", "  We use invasion percolation to compute numerical values for bond and site\npercolation thresholds $p_c$ (existence of an infinite cluster) and $p_u$\n(uniqueness of the infinite cluster) of tesselations $\\{P,Q\\}$ of the\nhyperbolic plane, where $Q$ faces meet at each vertex and each face is a\n$P$-gon. Our values are accurate to six or seven decimal places, allowing us to\nexplore their functional dependency on $P$ and $Q$ and to numerically compute\ncritical exponents. We also prove rigorous upper and lower bounds for $p_c$ and\n$p_u$ that can be used to find the scaling of both thresholds as a function of\n$P$ and $Q$.\n", "  We calculate the rates of inelastic collisions for ultracold alkali-metal\natoms in radiofrequency-dressed traps, using coupled-channel scattering\ncalculations on accurate potential energy surfaces. We identify an rf-induced\nloss mechanism that does not exist in the absence of rf radiation. This\nmechanism is not suppressed by a centrifugal barrier in the outgoing channel,\nand can be much faster than spin relaxation, which is centrifugally suppressed.\nWe explore the dependence of the rf-induced loss rate on singlet and triplet\nscattering lengths, hyperfine splittings and the strength of the rf field. We\ninterpret the results in terms of an adiabatic model of the collision dynamics,\nand calculate the corresponding nonadiabatic couplings. The loss rate can vary\nby 10 orders of magnitude as a function of singlet and triplet scattering\nlengths. $^{87}$Rb is a special case, where several factors combine to reduce\nrf-induced losses; as a result, they are slow compared to spin-relaxation\nlosses. For most other alkali-metal pairs, rf-induced losses are expected to be\nmuch faster and may dominate.\n", "  As one of Weyl semimetals discovered recently, NbP exhibits two groups of\nWeyl points with one group lying inside the $k_z=0$ plane and the other group\nstaying away from this plane. All Weyl points have been assumed to be type-I,\nfor which the Fermi surface shrinks into a point as the Fermi energy crosses\nthe Weyl point. In this work, we have revealed that the second group of Weyl\npoints are actually type-II, which are found to be touching points between the\nelectron and hole pockets in the Fermi surface. Corresponding Weyl cones are\nstrongly tilted along a line approximately $17^\\circ$ off the $k_z$ axis in the\n$k_x - k_z$ (or $k_y - k_z$) plane, violating the Lorentz symmetry but still\ngiving rise to Fermi arcs on the surface. Therefore, NbP exhibits both type-I\n($k_z=0$ plane) and type-II ($k_z \\neq 0$ plane) Weyl points.\n", "  An unexpected result at the RHIC and the LHC is the observation that\nhigh-multiplicity hadronic events in heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions are\ndistributed as two \"ridges\", approximately flat in rapidity and opposite in\nazimuthal angle. We propose that the origin of these events is due to the\ninelastic collisions of aligned gluonic flux tubes that underly the color\nconfinement of the quarks in each proton. We predict that high-multiplicity\nhadronic ridges will also be produced in the high energy photon-photon\ncollisions accessible at the LHC in ultra-peripheral proton-proton collisions\nor at a high energy electron-positron collider. We also note the orientation of\nthe flux tubes between the quark and antiquark of each high energy photon will\nbe correlated with the plane of the scattered proton or lepton. Thus hadron\nproduction and ridge formation can be controlled in a novel way at the LHC by\nobserving the azimuthal correlations of the scattering planes of the\nultra-peripheral protons with the orientation of the produced ridges.\nPhoton-photon collisions can thus illuminate the fundamental physics underlying\nthe ridge effect and the physics of color confinement in QCD.\n", "  Linares et al. (2016) obtained quasi-simultaneous g', r' and i-band light\ncurves and an absorption line radial velocity curve of the secondary star in\nthe redback system 3FGL J0212.1+5320. The light curves showed two maxima and\nminima primarily due to the secondary star's ellipsoidal modulation, but with\nunequal maxima and minima. We fit these light curves and radial velocities with\nour X-ray binary model including either a dark solar-type star spot or a hot\nspot due to off-centre heating from an intrabinary shock, to account for the\nunequal maxima. Both models give a radial velocity semi-amplitude and\nrotational broadening that agree with the observations. The observed secondary\nstar's effective temperature is best matched with the value obtained using the\nhot spot model, which gives a neutron star and secondary star mass of $M_{\\rm\n1}$=1.85$^{+0.32}_{-0.26}$ $M_{\\odot}$and $M_{\\rm 2}$=0.50$^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, respectively.\n", "  We report the discovery of a radio quiet type 2 quasar (SDSS\nJ165315.06+234943.0 nicknamed the \"Beetle\" at z=0.103) with unambiguous\nevidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) radio induced feedback acting across\na total extension of ~46 kpc and up to ~26 kpc from the AGN. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first radio quiet system where radio induced feedback\nhas been securely identified at >>several kpc from the AGN. Turbulent gas is\nalso found far from the radio axis, ~25 kpc in the perpendicular direction. We\npropose a scenario in which the radio structures have perforated the\ninterstellar medium of the galaxy and escaped into the circumgalactic medium.\nWhile advancing, they have interacted with in-situ gas modifying its\nproperties. Our results show that jets of modest power can be the dominant\nfeedback mechanism acting across huge volumes in radio quiet systems, including\nhighly accreting luminous AGN, where radiative mode feedback may be expected.\n", "  Models of inflationary magnetogenesis with a coupling to the electromagnetic\naction of the form $f^2 F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$, are known to suffer from several\nproblems. These include the strong coupling problem, the back reaction problem\nand also strong constraints due to Schwinger effect. We propose a model which\nresolves all these issues. In our model, the coupling function, $f$, grows\nduring inflation and transits to a decaying phase post inflation. This\nevolutionary behaviour is chosen so as to avoid the problem of strong coupling.\nBy assuming a suitable power law form of the coupling function, we can also\nneglect back reaction effects during inflation. To avoid back reaction\npost-inflation, we find that the reheating temperature is restricted to be\nbelow $ \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^4$ GeV. The magnetic energy spectrum is predicted\nto be non-helical and generically blue. The estimated present day magnetic\nfield strength and the corresponding coherence length taking reheating at the\nQCD epoch(150 MeV) are $ 1.4 \\times 10^{-12}$ G and $6.1 \\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc,\nrespectively. This is obtained after taking account of nonlinear processing\nover and above the flux freezing evolution after reheating. If we consider also\nthe possibility of a non-helical inverse cascade, as indicated in direct\nnumerical simulations, the coherence length and the magnetic field strength are\neven larger. In all cases mentioned above, the magnetic fields generated in our\nmodels satisfy the $\\gamma$-ray bound below a certain reheating temperature.\n", "  Gravitational waves can be used to test general relativity (GR) in the highly\ndynamical strong-field regime. Scalar-tensor theories of gravity are natural\nalternatives to GR that can manifest nonperturbative phenomena in neutron stars\n(NSs). One such phenomenon, known as dynamical scalarization, occurs in\ncoalescing binary NS systems. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors may be\nsensitive to this effect, and thus could potentially further constrain\nscalar-tensor theories. This type of analysis requires waveform models of\ndynamically scalarizing systems; in this work we devise an analytic model of\ndynamical scalarization using an effective action approach. For the first time,\nwe compute the Newtonian-order Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of a\ndynamically scalarizing binary in a self-consistent manner. Despite only\nworking to leading order, the model accurately predicts the frequency at which\ndynamical scalarization occurs. In conjunction with Landau theory, our model\nallows one to definitively establish dynamical scalarization as a second-order\nphase transition. We also connect dynamical scalarization to the related\nphenomena of spontaneous scalarization and induced scalarization; these\nphenomena are naturally encompassed into our effective action approach.\n", "  The present work reports results from systematic multiconfiguration\nDirac-Hartree-Fock calculations of electronic isotope shift factors for a set\nof transitions between low-lying states in neutral zinc. These electronic\nquantities together with observed isotope shifts between different pairs of\nisotopes provide the changes in mean-square charge radii of the atomic nuclei.\nWithin this computational approach, different models for electron correlation\nare explored in a systematic way to determine a reliable computational strategy\nand to estimate theoretical error bars of the isotope shift factors.\n", "  We present and compare measurements of the spacecraft potential (Vs/c) of the\nRosetta space- craft throughout its stay in the inner coma of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, by the Langmuir probe (RPC-LAP) and Ion Composition\nAnalyzer (RPC-ICA) instruments. Vs/c has mainly been negative, driven by the\nhigh temperature (~5-10 eV) of the coma photoelectrons. The magnitude of the\nnegative Vs/c traces heliocentric, cometocentric, seasonal and diurnal\nvariations in cometary outgassing, consistent with production at or inside the\ncometocentric distance of the spacecraft being the dominant source of the\nobserved plasma. LAP only picks up a portion of the full Vs/c since the two\nprobes, mounted on booms of 2.2 and 1.6 m length, respectively, are generally\ninside the potential field of the spacecraft. Comparing with the minimum energy\nof positive ions collected by ICA, we find numerous cases with strong cor-\nrelation between the two instruments, from which the fraction of Vs/c picked up\nby LAP is found to vary between about 0.7 and 1. We also find an ICA energy\noffset of 13.7 eV (95% CI: [12.5, 15.0]). Many cases of poor correlation\nbetween the instruments are also observed, predominantly when local ion\nproduction is weak and accelerated ions dominate the flux, or during quiet\nperiods with low dynamic range in Vs/c and consequently low signal-to-noise\nratios.\n", "  The complete sample of large-perihelion nearly-parabolic comets discovered\nduring the period 1901-2010 is studied starting from their orbit determination.\nNext, an orbital evolution that includes three perihelion passages\n(previous-observed-next) is investigated where a full model of Galactic\nperturbations and perturbations from passing stars have been incorporated. We\nshow that the distribution of planetary perturbations suffered by actual\nlarge-perihelion comets during their passage through the Solar system has a\ndeep, unexpected minimum around zero which indicates a lack of \"almost\nunperturbed\" comets. By a series of simulations we show that this deep well is\nmoderately resistant to some diffusion of orbital elements of analysed comets.\nIt seems reasonable to state that the observed stream of these large-perihelion\ncomets experienced a series of specific planetary configurations when passing\nthrough the planetary zone. An analysis of the past dynamics of these comets\nclearly shows that dynamically new comets may appear only when their original\nsemimajor axes are greater than 20 000 au. However, only for semimajor axes\nlonger than 40 000 au dynamically old comets are completely not present. We\ndemonstrated that the observed $1/a_{\\rm ori}$ distribution exhibits a local\nminimum separating dynamically new from dynamically old comets. Long-term\ndynamical studies reveal a large variety of orbital behaviour. Several\ninteresting examples of action of passing stars are also described, in\nparticular the impact of Gliese 710 which will pass close to the Sun in the\nfuture. However, none of the obtained stellar perturbations is sufficient to\nchange the dynamical status of analysed comets.\n", "  The upcoming NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will obtain\nspace-based uninterrupted light curves for a large sample of bright white\ndwarfs distributed across the entire sky, providing a very rich resource for\nasteroseismological studies and the search for transits from planetary debris.\nWe have compiled an all-sky catalogue of ultraviolet, optical, and infrared\nphotometry as well as proper motions, which we propose as an essential tool for\nthe preliminary identification and characterisation of potential targets. We\npresent data for 1864 known white dwarfs and 305 high-probability white dwarf\ncandidates brighter than 17 mag. We describe the spectroscopic follow-up of 135\nstars, of which 82 are white dwarfs and 25 are hot subdwarfs. The new confirmed\nstars include six pulsating white dwarf candidates (ZZ Cetis), and nine white\ndwarf binaries with a cool main-sequence companion. We identify one star with a\nspectroscopic distance of only 25 pc from the Sun. Around the time TESS is\nlaunched, we foresee that all white dwarfs in this sample will have\ntrigonometric parallaxes measured by the ESA Gaia mission next year.\n", "  In this paper, we compare simple viscous diffusion models for the disc\nevolution with the results of recent surveys of the properties of young\nprotoplanetary discs. We introduce the useful concept of `disc isochrones' in\nthe accretion rate - disc mass plane and explore a set of Montecarlo\nrealization of disc initial conditions. We find that such simple viscous models\ncan provide a remarkable agreement with the available data in the Lupus star\nforming region, with the key requirement that the average viscous evolutionary\ntimescale of the discs is comparable to the cluster age. Our models produce\nnaturally a correlation between mass accretion rate and disc mass that is\nshallower than linear, contrary to previous results and in agreement with\nobservations. We also predict that a linear correlation, with a tighter\nscatter, should be found for more evolved disc populations. Finally, we find\nthat such viscous models can reproduce the observations in the Lupus region\nonly in the assumption that the efficiency of angular momentum transport is a\ngrowing function of radius, thus putting interesting constraints on the nature\nof the microscopic processes that lead to disc accretion.\n", "  We present the second paper of a series of publications aiming at obtaining a\nbetter understanding regarding the nature of type Ia supernovae (SNIa)\nprogenitors by studying a large sample of detached F, G and K main sequence\nstars in close orbits with white dwarf companions (i.e. WD+FGK binaries). We\nemploy the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope)\ndata release 4 spectroscopic data base together with GALEX (Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer) ultraviolet fluxes to identify 1,549 WD+FGK binary candidates (1,057\nof which are new), thus doubling the number of known sources. We measure the\nradial velocities of 1,453 of these binaries from the available LAMOST spectra\nand/or from spectra obtained by us at a wide variety of different telescopes\naround the globe. The analysis of the radial velocity data allows us to\nidentify 24 systems displaying more than 3sigma radial velocity variation that\nwe classify as close binaries. We also discuss the fraction of close binaries\namong WD+FGK systems, which we find to be ~10 per cent, and demonstrate that\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy is required to efficiently identify\ndouble-degenerate SNIa progenitor candidates.\n", "  We developed a novel direct algorithm to derive the mass-ratio distribution\n(MRD) of short-period binaries from an observed sample of single-lined\nspectroscopic binaries (SB1). The algorithm considers a class of parameterized\nMRDs and finds the set of parameters that best fits the observed sample. The\nalgorithm consists of four parts. First, we define a new observable, the\n`modified mass function', that can be calculated for each binary in the sample.\nWe show that the distribution of the modified mass function follows the shape\nof the underlying MRD, turning it more advantageous than the previously used\nmass function, reduced mass function or reduced mass function logarithm.\nSecond, we derive the likelihood of the sample of modified mass functions to be\nobserved given an assumed MRD. An MCMC search enables the algorithm to find the\nparameters that best fit the observations. Third, we suggest to express the\nunknown MRD by a linear combination of a basis of functions that spans the\npossible MRDs. We suggest two such bases. Fourth, we show how to account for\nthe undetected systems that have an RV amplitude below a certain threshold.\nWithout the correction, this observational bias suppresses the derived MRD for\nlow mass ratios. Numerous simulations show that the algorithm works well with\neither of the two suggested bases. The four parts of the algorithm are\nindependent, but the combination of the four turn the algorithm to be highly\neffective in deriving the MRD of the binary population.\n", "  Using linear perturbation theory, we investigate the torque exerted on a\nlow-mass planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disc with finite thermal\ndiffusivity. When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, the\nmain effect of thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the\nplanet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes on either\nside of the orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes\nexert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to\nthe one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the\nlobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the `cold'\nthermal torque, which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the\ndistance to corotation to the size of the lobes $\\sim\\sqrt{\\chi/\\Omega_p}$,\n$\\chi$ being the thermal diffusivity and $\\Omega_p$ the orbital frequency. We\nbelieve that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named `cold finger'\nrecently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes\nthe dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is\nluminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional\ndisturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes. They give a torque,\nnamed heating torque in previous work, that has an expression similar, but of\nopposite sign, to the cold thermal torque.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength data analysis of IRAS 05463+2652 (hereafter\nI05463+2652) to study star formation mechanisms. A shell-like structure around\nI05463+2652 is evident in the Herschel column density map, which is not\nassociated with any ionized emission. Based on the Herschel sub-millimeter\nimages, several parsec-scale filaments (including two elongated filaments,\n\"s-fl\" and \"nw-fl\" having lengths of ~6.4 pc and ~8.8 pc, respectively) are\ninvestigated in I05463+2652 site. Herschel temperature map depicts all these\nfeatures in a temperature range of ~11-13 K. 39 clumps are identified and have\nmasses between ~70-945 M$_\\odot$. A majority of clumps (having M_clump >= 300\nM$_\\odot$) are distributed toward the shell-like structure. 175 young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) are selected using the photometric 1-5 microns data and a\nmajority of these YSOs are distributed toward the four areas of high column\ndensity >= 5 x 10^{21} cm^{-2}; A_V ~5.3 mag) in the shell-like structure,\nwhere massive clumps and a spatial association with filament(s) are also\nobserved. The knowledge of observed masses per unit length of elongated\nfilaments and critical mass length reveals that they are supercritical. The\nfilament \"nw-fl\" is fragmented into five clumps (having M_clump ~100-545\nM$_\\odot$) and contains noticeable YSOs, while the other filament \"s-fl\" is\nfragmented into two clumps (having M_clump ~170-215 M$_\\odot$) without YSOs.\nTogether, these observational results favor the role of filaments in star\nformation process in I05480+2545. This study also reveals the filament \"s-fl\",\ncontaining two starless clumps, at an early stage of fragmentation.\n", "  The process of heralded noiseless amplification, and the inverse process of\nheralded noiseless attenuation, have potential applications in the context of\nquantum communications. Although several different physical implementations of\nheralded noiseless amplifiers have now been demonstrated, the research on\nheralded noiseless attenuators has been largely confined to a beam-splitter\nbased approach. Here we show that an optical parametric amplifier (OPA),\ncombined with appropriate heralding, can also serve as a heralded noiseless\nattenuator. The counterintuitive use of an optical amplifier as an attenuator\nis only possible due to the probabilistic nature of the device.\n", "  We analyzed series of spectra obtained for twelve stable RRc stars observed\nwith the echelle spectro- graph of the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas\nObservatory and we analyzed the spectra of RRc Blazhko stars discussed by Govea\net al. (2014). We derived model atmosphere parameters, [Fe/H] metallicities,\nand [X/Fe] abundance ratios for 12 species of 9 elements. We co-added all\nspectra ob- tained during the pulsation cycles to increase S/N and demonstrate\nthat these spectra give results superior to those obtained by co-addition in\nsmall phase intervals. The RRc abundances are in good agreement with those\nderived for the RRab stars of Chadid et al. (2017). We used radial velocity\nmeasurements of metal lines and H{\\alpha} to construct variations of velocity\nwith phase, and center-of-mass velocities. We used these to construct\nradial-velocity templates for use in low-medium resolution radial velocity\nsurveys of RRc stars. Additionally, we calculated primary accelerations, radius\nvariations, metal and H{\\alpha} velocity amplitudes, which we display as\nregressions against primary acceleration. We employ these results to compare\nthe atmosphere structures of metal-poor RRc stars with their RRab counterparts.\nFinally, we use the radial velocity data for our Blazhko stars and the Blazhko\nperiods of Szczygie l & Fabrycky (2007) to falsify the Blazhko oblique rotator\nhypothesis.\n", "  We present the results of a deep survey of the nearby Sculptor group and the\nassociated Sculptor filament taken with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope in the\n21-cm emission line of neutral hydrogen. We detect 31 HI sources in the\nSculptor group/filament, eight of which are new HI detections. We derive a\nslope of the HI mass function along the Sculptor filament of $\\alpha =\n-1.10^{+0.20}_{-0.11}$, which is significantly flatter than the global mass\nfunction and consistent with the flat slopes previously found in other\nlow-density group environments. Some physical process, such as star formation,\nphotoionisation or ram-pressure stripping, must therefore be responsible for\nremoving neutral gas predominantly from low-mass galaxies. All of our HI\ndetections have a confirmed or tentative optical counterpart and are likely\nassociated with luminous rather than 'dark' galaxies. Despite a column density\nsensitivity of about $4 \\times 10^{17}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, we do not find any\ntraces of extragalactic gas or tidal streams, suggesting that the Sculptor\nfilament is, at the current time, a relatively quiescent environment that has\nnot seen any recent major interactions or mergers.\n", "  In this paper, we report our detailed analysis of the new strong-coupling\nregime between Alfv\\'en and fast modes in Poynting-dominated plasma turbulence,\nreported in our previous work Takamoto & Lazarian (2016), which is an important\neffect for many relativistic plasma phenomena, and calls for new theories of\nPoynting-dominated MHD turbulence. We performed numerical simulations of\nrelativistic MHD turbulence in isothermal plasmas, and analyzed the ratio of\nfast to Alfv\\'en mode energy. We found that the increase of the fast mode with\nthe background $\\sigma$-parameter can be observed even in isothermal plasma,\nshowing that such a phenomena is universal in trans-Alfv\\'enic turbulence in\nPoynting-dominated plasmas. To study the detailed energy conversion process, we\nalso performed a series of simulations of decaying turbulence injecting pure\nAlfv\\'en, fast, and slow modes, respectively, and investigated the development\nof the mode conversion from the each mode. We also found that the mode\nconversion between Alfv\\'en and fast modes is nearly insensitive to the\nbackground temperature. Finally, we report a result of a simulation with\ninitially fast mode dominated turbulence. It developed into a temporally\nstrong-coupling regime, which is a strong evidence for the existence of our\nsuggesting strong-coupling regime of fast and Alfv\\'en modes. Our result\nsuggests that the strong turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasma is very\ndifferent from that in the non-relativistic plasma. It will also give an\nimportant guidance to studies of particle acceleration and non-thermal photon\nemission from Poynting-dominated plasma.\n", "  Resonant microwave absorption of a two-dimensional electron system in an\nAlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure excited by a near-field technique was investigated.\nAlong with collective magnetoplasmon modes, we observed resonance that\nprecisely follows the cyclotron resonance (CR) position and revealed no signs\nof collective plasma depolarization shift. We show that the discovered CR mode\nis absent in the Faraday geometry, and is localized at the edge of the exciting\nmetal electrode. Such behavior points in favor of the single-particle\nAzbel'-Kaner nature of the discovered resonance.\n", "  Over the last decade, the classical definition of Globular Clusters (GCs) as\nsimple stellar populations was revolutionized due to the discovery of \"Multiple\nPopulations\" (MPs). However, our knowledge of this phenomenon and its\ncharacteristics is still lacking greatly observationally, and there is\ncurrently no scenario that adequately explains its origin. It is therefore\nimportant to study as many GCs as possible to characterize whether or not they\nhave MPs, and determine their detailed behavior to enlighten formation\nscenarios, using a wide range of techniques. The Washington photometric system\nhas proved to be useful to find MPs thanks mainly to the UV-sensitivity and\nhigh efficiency of the C filter. We search for MPs in the Galactic GC NGC 7099\n(M30), the second GC being searched for MPs using this system. We obtained\nphotometric data using the Swope 1m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, as\nwell as the 4m SOAR facility. Our reduction procedure included addstar\nexperiments to properly assess photometric errors. We find a clear signal of\nMPs based on an intrinsically wide color spread on the RGB, in particular due\nto a relatively small fraction of stars significantly bluer than the main RGB\nlocus. These stars should correspond to so-called first generation stars, which\nwe estimate to be roughly 15\\% of the total. However, we find these\nfirst-generation stars to be more spatially concentrated than their second\ngeneration counterparts, which is the opposite to the general trend found in\nother clusters. We briefly discuss possible explanations for this phenomenon.\n", "  We have performed combined photoionization and photodissociation region (PDR)\nmodelling of a Crab Nebula filament subjected to the synchrotron radiation from\nthe central pulsar wind nebula, and to a high flux of charged particles; a\ngreatly enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate over the standard interstellar\nvalue, $\\zeta_0$, is required to account for the lack of detected [C I]\nemission in published Herschel SPIRE FTS observations of the Crab Nebula. The\nobserved line surface brightness ratios of the OH$^+$ and ArH$^+$ transitions\nseen in the SPIRE FTS frequency range can only be explained with both a high\ncosmic ray ionization rate and a reduced ArH$^+$ dissociative recombination\nrate compared to that used by previous authors, although consistent with\nexperimental upper limits. We find that the ArH$^+$/OH$^+$ line strengths and\nthe observed H$_2$ vibration-rotation emission can be reproduced by model\nfilaments with $n_{\\rm{H}} = 2 \\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $\\zeta = 10^7 \\zeta_0$\nand visual extinctions within the range found for dusty globules in the Crab\nNebula, although far-infrared emission from [O I] and [C II] is higher than the\nobservational constraints. Models with $n_{\\rm{H}} = 1900$ cm$^{-3}$\nunderpredict the H$_2$ surface brightness, but agree with the ArH$^+$ and\nOH$^+$ surface brightnesses and predict [O I] and [C II] line ratios consistent\nwith observations. These models predict HeH$^+$ rotational emission above\ndetection thresholds, but consideration of the formation timescale suggests\nthat the abundance of this molecule in the Crab Nebula should be lower than the\nequilibrium values obtained in our analysis.\n", "  Collision-induced absorption (CIA) from molecular hydrogen is a dominant\nopacity source in the atmosphere of cool white dwarfs. It results in a\nsignificant flux depletion in the near-IR and IR parts of their spectra.\nBecause of the extreme conditions of helium-rich atmospheres (where the density\ncan be as high as a few g/cm$^3$), this opacity source is expected to undergo\nstrong pressure distortion and the currently used opacities have not been\nvalidated at such extreme conditions. To check the distortion of the CIA\nopacity we applied state-of-the-art ab initio methods of computational quantum\nchemistry to simulate the CIA opacity at high densities. The results show that\nthe CIA profiles are significantly distorted above densities of $0.1\\,{\\rm\ng/cm}^3$ in a way that is not captured by the existing models. The\nroto-translational band is enhanced and shifted to higher frequencies as an\neffect of the decrease of the interatomic separation of the H$_2$ molecule. The\nvibrational band is blueward shifted and split into $Q_R$ and $Q_P$ branches,\nseparated by a pronounced interference dip. Its intensity is also substantially\nreduced. The distortions result in a shift of the maximum of the absorption\nfrom $2.3\\,\\mu{\\rm m}$ to $3-7 \\mu{\\rm m}$, which could potentially explain the\nspectra of some very cool, helium-rich white dwarfs.\n", "  We present the results of numerical simulations of the prompt emission of\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts. We consider emission from the relativistic\njet, the mildly relativistic cocoon, and the non-relativistic shocked ambient\nmaterial. We find that the cocoon material is confined between off-axis angles\n15<theta<45 degrees and gives origin to X-ray transients with a duration of a\nfew to ~10 seconds, delayed by a few seconds from the time of the merger. We\nalso discuss the distance at which such transients can be detected, finding\nthat it depends sensitively on the assumptions that are made about the\nradiation spectrum. Purely thermal cocoon transients are detectable only out to\na few Mpc, Comptonized transients can instead be detected by the FERMI GBM out\nto several tens of Mpc.\n", "  Although Type Ia supernova cosmology has now reached a mature state, it is\nimportant to develop as many independent methods as possible to understand the\ntrue nature of dark energy. Recent studies have shown that Type II supernovae\n(SNe II) offer such a path and could be used as alternative distance\nindicators. However, the majority of these studies were unable to extend the\nHubble diagram above redshift $z=0.3$ because of observational limitations.\nHere, we show that we are now ready to move beyond low redshifts and attempt\nhigh-redshift ($z \\gtrsim 0.3$) SN~II cosmology as a result of new-generation\ndeep surveys such as the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. Applying the\n\"standard candle method\" to SN$\\sim$2016jhj ($z=0.3398 \\pm 0.0002$; discovered\nby HSC) together with a low-redshift sample, we are able to construct the\nhighest-redshift SN II Hubble diagram to date with an observed dispersion of\n0.27 mag (i.e., 12-13% in distance). This work demonstrates the bright future\nof SN~II cosmology in the coming era of large, wide-field surveys like that of\nthe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.\n", "  We present a detailed inventory of star formation in the local Universe,\ndissecting the cosmic star formation budget as a function of key variables that\ninfluence the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies: stellar mass, local\nenvironment and morphology. We use a large homogeneous dataset from the SDSS to\nfirst study how the star-formation budget in galaxies with stellar masses\ngreater than $\\log (\\textrm{M}_{*}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}) = 10$ splits as a\nfunction of each parameter separately. We then explore how the budget behaves\nas a simultaneous function of these three parameters. We show that the bulk of\nthe star formation at $z<0.075$ ($\\sim$65 per cent) takes place in spiral\ngalaxies, that reside in the field, and have stellar masses between $10 < \\log\n(\\textrm{M}_{*}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}) < 10.9$. The ratio of the cosmic star\nformation budget hosted by galaxies in the field, groups and clusters is\n21:3:1. Morphological ellipticals are minority contributors to local star\nformation. They make a measurable contribution to the star formation budget\nonly at intermediate to high stellar masses, $10.3< \\log\n(\\textrm{M}_{*}/\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}) < 11.2 $ (where they begin to dominate by\nnumber), and typically in the field, where they contribute up to $\\sim$13 per\ncent of the total star-formation budget. This inventory of local star formation\nserves as a $z\\sim0$ baseline which, when combined with similar work at high\nredshift, will enable us to understand the changes in SFR that have occurred\nover cosmic time and offers a strong constraint on models of galaxy formation.\n", "  This paper presents a three-dimensional simulation of chromospheric jets with\ntwisted magnetic field lines. Detailed treatments of the photospheric radiative\ntransfer and the equation of states allow us to model realistic thermal\nconvection near the solar surface, which excites various MHD waves and produces\nchromospheric jets in the simulation. A tall chromospheric jet with a maximum\nheight of 10--11 Mm and lifetime of 8--10 min is formed above a strong magnetic\nfield concentration. The magnetic field lines are strongly entangled in the\nchromosphere, which helps the chromospheric jet to be driven by the Lorentz\nforce. The jet exhibits oscillatory motion as a natural consequence of its\ngeneration mechanism. We also find that the produced chromospheric jet forms a\ncluster with a diameter of several Mm with finer strands. These results imply a\nclose relationship between the simulated jet and solar spicules.\n", "  We conducted a polarimetric observation of the fast-rotating near-Earth\nasteroid (1566) Icarus at large phase (Sun-asteroid-observer's) angles\n$\\alpha$= 57 deg--141deg around the 2015 summer solstice. We found that the\nmaximum values of the linear polarization degree are\n$P_\\mathrm{max}$=7.32$\\pm$0.25 % at phase angles of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{max}$=124$\\pm$8 deg in the $V$-band and\n$P_\\mathrm{max}$=7.04$\\pm$0.21 % at $\\alpha_\\mathrm{max}$=124$\\pm$6 deg in the\n$R_\\mathrm{C}$-band. Applying the polarimetric slope-albedo empirical law, we\nderived a geometric albedo of $p_\\mathrm{V}$=0.25$\\pm$0.02, which is in\nagreement with that of Q-type taxonomic asteroids. $\\alpha_\\mathrm{max}$ is\nunambiguously larger than that of Mercury, the Moon, and another near-Earth\nS-type asteroid (4179) Toutatis but consistent with laboratory samples with\nhundreds of microns in size. The combination of the maximum polarization degree\nand the geometric albedo is in accordance with terrestrial rocks with a\ndiameter of several hundreds of micrometers. The photometric function indicates\na large macroscopic roughness. We hypothesize that the unique environment\n(i.e., the small perihelion distance $q$=0.187 au and a short rotational period\nof $T_\\mathrm{rot}$=2.27 hours) may be attributed to the paucity of small\ngrains on the surface, as indicated on (3200) Phaethon.\n", "  We estimate the number counts of line emitters at high redshift and their\nevolution with cosmic time based on a combination of photometry and\nspectroscopy. We predict the H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$, [OII], and [OIII] line fluxes\nfor more than $35,000$ galaxies down to stellar masses of $\\sim10^9$\n$M_{\\odot}$ in the COSMOS and GOODS-S fields, applying standard conversions and\nexploiting the spectroscopic coverage of the FMOS-COSMOS survey at $z\\sim1.55$\nto calibrate the predictions. We calculate the number counts of H$\\alpha$,\n[OII], and [OIII] emitters down to fluxes of $1\\times10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in the range $1.4 < z < 1.8$ covered by the FMOS-COSMOS survey. We\nmodel the time evolution of the differential and cumulative H$\\alpha$ counts,\nsteeply declining at the brightest fluxes. We expect $\\sim9,300-9,700$ and\n$\\sim2,300-2,900$ galaxies deg$^{-2}$ for fluxes $\\geq1\\times10^{-16}$ and\n$\\geq2\\times10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ over the range $0.9<z<1.8$. We\nshow that the observed evolution of the Main Sequence of galaxies with redshift\nis enough to reproduce the observed counts variation at $0.2<z<2.5$. We\ncharacterize the physical properties of the H$\\alpha$ emitters with fluxes\n$\\geq2\\times10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, including their stellar masses,\nUV sizes, [NII]/H$\\alpha$ ratios, and H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths. An aperture\nof $R\\sim R_{\\rm e}\\sim0.5$\" maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for a\ndetection, while causing a factor of $\\sim2\\times$ flux losses, influencing the\nrecoverable number counts, if neglected. Our approach, based on deep and large\nphotometric datasets, reduces the uncertainties on the number counts due to the\nselection and spectroscopic samplings, while exploring low fluxes. We publicly\nrelease the line flux predictions for the explored photometric samples.\n", "  We consider the capabilities of current and future large facilities operating\nat 2\\,mm to 3\\,mm wavelength to detect and image the [CII] 158\\,$\\mu$m line\nfrom galaxies into the cosmic \"dark ages\" ($z \\sim 10$ to 20). The [CII] line\nmay prove to be a powerful tool in determining spectroscopic redshifts, and\ngalaxy dynamics, for the first galaxies. We emphasize that the nature, and even\nexistence, of such extreme redshift galaxies, remains at the frontier of open\nquestions in galaxy formation. In 40\\,hr, ALMA has the sensitivity to detect\nthe integrated [CII] line emission from a moderate metallicity, active\nstar-forming galaxy [$Z_A = 0.2\\,Z_{\\odot}$; star formation rate (SFR) =\n5\\,$M_\\odot$\\,yr$^{-1}$], at $z = 10$ at a significance of 6$\\sigma$. The\nnext-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will detect the integrated [CII] line\nemission from a Milky-Way like star formation rate galaxy ($Z_{A} =\n0.2\\,Z_{\\odot}$, SFR = 1\\,$M_\\odot$\\,yr$^{-1}$), at $z = 15$ at a significance\nof 6$\\sigma$. Imaging simulations show that the ngVLA can determine rotation\ndynamics for active star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 15$, if they exist. Based\non our very limited knowledge of the extreme redshift Universe, we calculate\nthe count rate in blind, volumetric surveys for [CII] emission at $z \\sim 10$\nto 20. The detection rates in blind surveys will be slow (of order unity per\n40\\,hr pointing). However, the observations are well suited to commensal\nsearches. We compare [CII] with the [OIII] 88$\\mu$m line, and other ancillary\ninformation in high $z$ galaxies that would aid these studies.\n", "  Carbon monoxide is the most abundant molecule after H$_2$ and is important\nfor chemistry in circumstellar envelopes around late-type stars. The size of\nthe envelope is important when modelling low-J transition lines and deriving\nmass-loss rates from such lines. Now that ALMA is coming to full power the\nextent of the CO emitting region can be measured directly for nearby asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars. In parallel, it has become obvious in the past few\nyears that the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) can have a\nsignificant impact on the interpretation of the emission lines.\n  In this paper an update and extension of the classical Mamon et al. (1988;\nApJ 328, 797) paper is presented; these authors provided the CO abundance\nprofile, described by two parameters, as a function of mass-loss rate and\nexpansion velocity. Following recent work an improved numerical method and\nupdated H$_2$ and CO shielding functions are used and a larger grid is\ncalculated that covers more parameter space, including the strength of the\nISRF.\n  The effect of changing the photodissociation radius on the low-J CO line\nintensities is illustrated in two cases.\n", "  We present a detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of 219 DA and DB\nwhite dwarfs for which trigonometric parallax measurements are available. Our\naim is to compare the physical parameters derived from the spectroscopic and\nphotometric techniques, and then to test the theoretical mass-radius relation\nfor white dwarfs using these results. The agreement between spectroscopic and\nphotometric parameters is found to be excellent, especially for effective\ntemperatures, showing that our model atmospheres and fitting procedures provide\nan accurate, internally consistent analysis. Values of surface gravity and\nsolid angle, obtained respectively from spectroscopy and photometry, are\ncombined with parallax measurements in various ways to study the validity of\nthe mass-radius relation from an empirical point of view. After a thorough\nexamination of our results, we find that 73% and 92% of the white dwarfs are\nconsistent within 1 and 2$\\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively, with the\npredictions of the mass-radius relation, thus providing strong support to the\ntheory of stellar degeneracy. Our analysis also allows us to identify 15 stars\nthat are better interpreted in terms of unresolved double degenerate binaries.\nAtmospheric parameters for both components in these binary systems are obtained\nusing a novel approach. We further identify a few white dwarfs that are\npossibly composed of an iron core rather than a carbon/oxygen core, since they\nare consistent with Fe-core evolutionary models.\n", "  It is usually thought that a single equation of state (EoS) model \"correctly\"\nrepresents cores of all compact stars. Here we emphasize that two families of\ncompact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature,\nand that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the\nnucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue\nsome massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black\nholes. Besides, we extend the concept of critical mass $M_{\\rm cr}$ for the\nneutron star sequence (Berezhiani et al. 2003; Bombaci et al. 2004) to the case\nof fast-spinning neutron stars, and point out that neutron star EoS models\ncannot be ruled out by the stellar mass measurement alone. Finally, we\nemphasize the additional complexity for constraining EoS models, for example,\nby stellar radius measurements using X-ray observations, if two families of\ncompact stars coexist.\n", "  We aim at constraining the dust mass in high-redshift ($z\\gtrsim 5$) galaxies\nusing the upper limits obtained by ALMA in combination with the rest-frame\nUV--optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For SED fitting, because of\ndegeneracy between dust extinction and stellar age, we focus on two extremes:\ncontinuous star formation (Model A) and instantaneous star formation (Model B).\nWe apply these models to Himiko (as a representative UV-bright object) and a\ncomposite SED of $z>5$ Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). For Himiko, Model A\nrequires a significant dust extinction, which leads to a high dust temperature\n$>70$ K for consistency with the ALMA upper limit. This high dust temperature\nputs a strong upper limit on the total dust mass $M_\\mathrm{d}\\lesssim 2\\times\n10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$, and the dust mass produced per supernova (SN)\n$m_\\mathrm{d,SN}\\lesssim 0.1$ M$_{\\odot}$. Such a low $m_\\mathrm{d,SN}$\nsuggests significant loss of dust by reverse shock destruction or outflow, and\nimplies that SNe are not the dominant source of dust at high $z$. Model B\nallows $M_\\mathrm{d}\\sim 2\\times 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $m_\\mathrm{d,SN}\\sim\n0.3$ M$_{\\odot}$.} We could distinguish between Models A and B if we observe\nHimiko at {wavelength $<$ 1.2 mm by ALMA. For the LBG sample, we obtain\n$M_\\mathrm{d}\\lesssim 2\\times 10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ for a typical LBG at $z>5$, but\nthis only puts an upper limit for $m_\\mathrm{d,SN}$ as $\\sim 2$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThis clarifies the importance of observing UV-bright objects (like Himiko) to\nconstrain the dust production by SNe.\n", "  We present results from a deep (200 ks) Chandra observation of the early-type\ngalaxy NGC 4552 (M89) which is falling into the Virgo cluster. Previous\nshallower X-ray observations of this galaxy showed a remnant gas core, a tail\nto the South of the galaxy, and twin `horns' attached to the northern edge of\nthe gas core [machacek05a]. In our deeper data, we detect a diffuse, low\nsurface brightness extension to the previously known tail, and measure the\ntemperature structure within the tail. We combine the deep Chandra data with\narchival XMM-Newton observations to put a strong upper limit on the diffuse\nemission of the tail out to a large distance (10$\\times$the radius of the\nremnant core) from the galaxy center. In our two previous papers\n[roediger15a,roediger15b], we presented the results of hydrodynamical\nsimulations of ram pressure stripping specifically for M89 falling into the\nVirgo cluster and investigated the effect of ICM viscosity. In this paper, we\ncompare our deep data with our specifically tailored simulations and conclude\nthat the observed morphology of the stripped tail in NGC 4552 is most similar\nto the inviscid models. We conclude that, to the extent the transport processes\ncan be simply modeled as a hydrodynamic viscosity, the ICM viscosity is\nnegligible. More generally, any micro-scale description of the transport\nprocesses in the high-$\\beta$ plasma of the cluster ICM must be consistent with\nthe efficient mixing observed in the stripped tail on macroscopic scales.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of the covariance matrix of the spherically\naveraged galaxy power spectrum and present a new, practical method for\nestimating this within an arbitrary survey without the need for running mock\ngalaxy simulations that cover the full survey volume. The method uses\ntheoretical arguments to modify the covariance matrix measured from a set of\nsmall-volume cubic galaxy simulations, which are computationally cheap to\nproduce compared to larger simulations and match the measured small-scale\ngalaxy clustering more accurately than is possible using theoretical modelling.\nWe include prescriptions to analytically account for the window function of the\nsurvey, which convolves the measured covariance matrix in a non-trivial way. We\nalso present a new method to include the effects of supersample covariance and\nmodes outside the small simulation volume which requires no additional\nsimulations and still allows us to scale the covariance matrix. As validation,\nwe compare the covariance matrix estimated using our new method to that from a\nbrute force calculation using 500 simulations originally created for analysis\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS-MGS). We find\nexcellent agreement on all scales of interest for large scale structure\nanalysis, including those dominated by the effects of the survey window, and on\nscales where theoretical models of the clustering normally break-down, but the\nnew method produces a covariance matrix with significantly better\nsignal-to-noise. Although only formally correct in real-space, we also discuss\nhow our method can be extended to incorporate the effects of Redshift Space\nDistortions.\n", "  The dependence of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu, on the local matter\ndensity was investigated using methanol emission in the dense dark cloud core\nL1498. Towards two different positions in L1498, five methanol transitions were\ndetected and an extra line was tentatively detected at a lower confidence level\nin one of the positions. The observed centroid frequencies were then compared\nwith their rest frame frequencies derived from least-squares fitting to a large\ndata set. Systematic effects, as the underlying methanol hyperfine structure\nand the Doppler tracking of the telescope, were investigated and their effects\nwere included in the total error budget. The comparison between the\nobservations and the rest frame frequencies constrains potential mu variation\nat the level of Dmu/mu < 6 x 10^(-8), at a 3 sigma confidence level. For the\ndark cloud we determine a total CH3OH (A+E) beam averaged column density of 3-4\nx 10^(12) cm(-2) (within roughly a factor of two), an E- to A-type methanol\ncolumn density ratio of N(A-CH3OH)/N(E-CH3OH) = 1.00 +/- 0.15, a density of\nn(H2) = 3 x 10^5 cm^(-3) (again within a factor of two), and a kinetic\ntemperature of Tkin = 6 +/- 1 K. In a kinetic model including the line\nintensities observed for the methanol lines, the n(H2) density is higher and\nthe temperature is lower than that derived in previous studies based on\ndifferent molecular species; the intensity of the 1_0 --> 1_-1 E line strength\nis not well reproduced.\n", "  We report flare ribbons approach (FRA) during a multiple-ribbon M-class flare\non 2015 November 4 in NOAA AR 12443, obtained by the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The flare consisted of a pair\nof main ribbons and two pairs of secondary ribbons. The two pairs of secondary\nribbons were formed later than the appearance of main ribbons, with respective\ntime delays of 15 and 19 minutes. The negative-polarity main ribbon spread\noutward faster than the first secondary ribbon with the same polarity in front\nof it, and thus the FRA was generated. Just before their encounter, the main\nribbon was darkening drastically and its intensity decreased by about 70% in 2\nminutes, implying the suppression of main-phase reconnection that produced two\nmain ribbons. The FRA caused the deflection of the main ribbon to the direction\nof secondary ribbon with a deflection angle of about 60 degree. Post-approach\narcade was formed about 2 minutes later and the downflows were detected along\nthe new arcade with velocities of 35-40 km/s, indicative of the magnetic\nrestructuring during the process of FRA. We suggest that there are three\ntopological domains with footpoints outlined by the three pairs of ribbons.\nClose proximity of these domains leads to deflection of the ribbons in\nagreement with the magnetic field topology.\n", "  We report on the second installment of an X-ray monitoring project of seven\nluminous radio-quiet quasars (RQQs). New {\\sl Chandra} observations of four of\nthese, at $4.10\\leq z\\leq4.35$, yield a total of six X-ray epochs, per source,\nwith temporal baselines of $\\sim850-1600$ days in the rest frame. These data\nprovide the best X-ray light curves for RQQs at $z>4$, to date, enabling\nqualitative investigations of the X-ray variability behavior of such sources\nfor the first time. On average, these sources follow the trend of decreasing\nvariability amplitude with increasing luminosity, and there is no evidence for\nX-ray variability increasing toward higher redshifts, in contrast with earlier\npredictions of potential evolutionary scenarios. An ensemble variability\nstructure function reveals that their variability level remains relatively flat\nacross $\\approx20 - 1000$ days in the rest frame and it is generally lower than\nthat of three similarly luminous RQQs at $1.33\\leq z\\leq 2.74$ over the same\ntemporal range. We discuss possible explanations for the increased variability\nof the lower-redshift subsample and, in particular, whether higher accretion\nrates play a leading role. Near-simultaneous optical monitoring of the sources\nat $4.10\\leq z\\leq 4.35$ indicates that none is variable on $\\approx1$-day\ntimescales, although flux variations of up to $\\sim25$\\% are observed on\n$\\approx100$-day timescales, typical of RQQs at similar redshifts. Significant\noptical-X-ray spectral slope variations observed in two of these sources are\nconsistent with the levels observed in luminous RQQs and are dominated by X-ray\nvariations.\n", "  The total solar fluxes at 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz were observed continuously\nfrom 1957 to 1994 at Toyokawa, and from 1994 until now at Nobeyama, Japan with\nthe current Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters. We examined the multi-frequency and\nlong-term datasets, and found that not only the microwave solar flux but also\nits monthly standard deviation well indicates the long-term variation of solar\nactivity. Furthermore, we found that the microwave spectra at the solar minima\nof Cycle 20~24 agree with each other. These results show that the average\natmospheric structure above the upper chromosphere in the quiet Sun has not\nvaried for half a century, and suggest that the energy input for atmospheric\nheating from the sub-photosphere to the corona has not changed in the quiet Sun\ndespite significantly differing strengths of magnetic activity in the last five\nsolar cycles.\n", "  Kepler photometry of the hot Neptune host star HAT-P-11 suggests that its\nspot latitude distribution is comparable to the Sun's near solar maximum. We\nsearch for evidence of an activity cycle in the CaII H & K chromospheric\nemission $S$-index with archival Keck/HIRES spectra and observations from the\nechelle spectrograph on the ARC 3.5 m Telescope at APO. The chromospheric\nemission of HAT-P-11 is consistent with a $\\gtrsim 10$ year activity cycle,\nwhich plateaued near maximum during the Kepler mission. In the cycle that we\nobserved, the star seemed to spend more time near active maximum than minimum.\nWe compare the $\\log R^\\prime_{HK}$ normalized chromospheric emission index of\nHAT-P-11 with other stars. HAT-P-11 has unusually strong chromospheric emission\ncompared to planet-hosting stars of similar effective temperature and rotation\nperiod, perhaps due to tides raised by its planet.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star, 2MASS\nJ$19400781-4420093$ (J1940; $V=13.1$). The star was discovered using SuperWASP\nbroadband photometry to have a frequency of 176.39 d$^{-1}$ (2041.55 $\\mu$Hz;\n$P = 8.2$ min; Holdsworth et al. 2014a) and is shown here to have a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of 34 mmag. J1940 has been observed during three seasons\nat the South African Astronomical Observatory, and has been the target of a\nWhole Earth Telescope campaign. The observations reveal that J1940 pulsates in\na distorted quadrupole mode with unusual pulsational phase variations. A higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio spectrum has been obtained since J1940's first\nannouncement, which allows us to classify the star as A7 Vp Eu(Cr). The\nobserving campaigns presented here reveal no pulsations other than the\ninitially detected frequency. We model the pulsation in J1940 and conclude that\nthe pulsation is distorted by a magnetic field of strength $1.5$ kG. A\ndifference in the times of rotational maximum light and pulsation maximum\nsuggests a significant offset between the spots and pulsation axis, as can be\nseen in roAp stars.\n", "  Almost every star in our Galaxy is likely to harbor a terrestrial planet, but\naccurate measurements of an exoplanet's mass and radius demands accurate\nknowledge of the properties of its host star. The imminent TESS and CHEOPS\nmissions are slated to discover thousands of new exoplanets. Along with WFIRST,\nwhich will directly image nearby planets, these surveys make urgent the need to\nbetter characterize stars in the nearby solar neighborhood (< 30 pc). We have\ncompiled the CATalog of Stellar Unified Properties (CATSUP) for 951 stars,\nincluding such data as: Gaia astrometry; multiplicity within stellar systems;\nstellar elemental abundance measurements; standardized spectral types; Ca II H\nand K stellar activity indices; GALEX NUV and FUV photometry; and X-ray fluxes\nand luminosities from ROSAT, XMM, and Chandra. We use this data-rich catalog to\nfind correlations, especially between stellar emission indices, colors, and\ngalactic velocity. Additionally, we demonstrate that thick-disk stars in the\nsample are generally older, have lower activity, and have higher velocities\nnormal to the galactic plane. We anticipate CATSUP will be useful in discerning\nother trends among stars within the nearby solar neighborhood, for comparing\nthin-disk vs. thick-disk stars, for comparing stars with and without planets,\nand for finding correlations between chemical and kinematic properties.\n", "  We analysed Washington $CMT_1$ photometry of star clusters located along the\nminor axis of the LMC, from the LMC optical centre up to $\\sim$ 39 degrees\noutwards to the North-West. The data base was exploited in order to search for\nnew star cluster candidates, to produce cluster CMDs cleaned from field star\ncontamination and to derive age estimates for a statistically complete cluster\nsample. We confirmed that 146 star cluster candidates are genuine physical\nsystems, and concluded that an overall $\\sim$ 30 per cent of catalogued\nclusters in the surveyed regions are unlikely to be true physical systems. We\ndid not find any new cluster candidates in the outskirts of the LMC\n(deprojected distance $\\ge$ 8 degrees). The derived ages of the studied\nclusters are in the range 7.2 < log($t$ yr$^{-1}$) $\\le$ 9.4, with the sole\nexception of the globular cluster NGC\\,1786 (log($t$ yr$^{-1}$) = 10.10). We\nalso calculated the cluster frequency for each region, from which we confirmed\npreviously proposed outside-in formation scenarios. In addition, we found that\nthe outer LMC fields show a sudden episode of cluster formation (log($t$\nyr$^{-1}$) $\\sim$ 7.8-7.9) that continued until log($t$ yr$^{-1}$) $\\sim$ 7.3\nonly in the outermost LMC region. We link these features to the first\npericentre passage of the LMC to the MW, which could have triggered cluster\nformation due to ram pressure interaction between the LMC and MW halo.\n", "  Given the frequency of stellar multiplicity in the solar neighborhood, it is\nimportant to study the impacts this can have on exoplanet properties and\norbital dynamics. There have been numerous imaging survey projects established\nto detect possible low-mass stellar companions to exoplanet host stars. Here we\nprovide the results from a systematic speckle imaging survey of known exoplanet\nhost stars. In total, 71 stars were observed at 692~nm and 880~nm bands using\nthe Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) at the Gemini-North\nObservatory. Our results show that all but 2 of the stars included in this\nsample have no evidence of stellar companions with luminosities down to the\ndetection and projected separation limits of our instrumentation. The\nmass-luminosity relationship is used to estimate the maximum mass a stellar\ncompanion can have without being detected. These results are used to discuss\nthe potential for further radial velocity follow-up and interpretation of\ncompanion signals.\n", "  We explore the well-observed type IIP SN 2013ej with peculiar luminosity\nevolution. It is found that the hydrodynamic model cannot reproduce in detail\nthe bolometric luminosity at both the plateau and the radioactive tail. Yet the\nejecta mass of 23-26 Msun and the kinetic energy of (1.2-1.4)x10^51 erg are\ndetermined rather confidently. We suggest that the controversy revealed in\nhydrodynamic simulations stems from the strong asphericity of the Ni-56 ejecta.\nAn analysis of the asymmetric nebular H-alpha line and of the peculiar\nradioactive tail made it possible to recover parameters of the asymmetric\nbipolar Ni-56 ejecta with the heavier jet residing in the rear hemisphere. The\ninferred Ni-56 mass is 0.039 Msun, twice as large compared to a straightforward\nestimate from the bolometric luminosity at the early radioactive tail. The bulk\nof ejected Ni-56 has velocities in the range of 4000-6500 km/s. The linear\npolarization predicted by the model with the asymmetric ionization produced by\nbipolar Ni-56 ejecta is consistent with the observational value.\n", "  We use a sample of 1338 spectroscopically confirmed and photometrically\nclassified Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), sourced from the CSP, CfA, SDSS-II, and\nSNLS supernova samples, to examine the relationships between SNe Ia and the\ngalaxies that host them. Our results provide confirmation with improved\nstatistical significance that SNe Ia, after standardization, are on average\nmore luminous in massive hosts (significance $\\rm > 5 \\sigma$), and decline\nmore rapidly in massive hosts (significance $\\rm > 9\\sigma$) and in hosts with\nlow specific star formation rates (significance $\\rm > 8\\sigma$). We study the\nvariation of these relationships with redshift and detect no evolution. We\nsplit SNe Ia into pairs of subsets that are based on the properties of the\nhosts, and fit cosmological models to each subset. Including both systematic\nand statistical uncertainties, we do not find any significant shift in the\nbest-fit cosmological parameters between the subsets. Among different SN Ia\nsubsets, we find that SNe Ia in hosts with high specific star formation rates\nhave the least intrinsic scatter ($\\rm \\sigma_{int}=0.08\\pm0.01$) in luminosity\nafter standardization.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of transient growth in the\nlinear perturbation of current sheets. The resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\noperator for a background field consisting of a current sheet is non-normal,\nmeaning that associated eigenvalues and eigenmodes can be very sensitive to\nperturbation. In a linear stability analysis of a tearing current sheet, we\nshow that modes that are damped as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$ can produce transient\nenergy growth, contributing faster growth rates and higher energy attainment\n(within a fixed finite time) than the unstable tearing mode found from\nnormal-mode analysis. We determine the transient growth for tearing-stable and\ntearing-unstable regimes and discuss the consequences of our results for\nprocesses in the solar atmosphere, such as flares and coronal heating. Our\nresults have significant potential impact on how fast current sheets can be\ndisrupted. In particular, transient energy growth due to (asymptotically)\ndamped modes may lead to accelerated current sheet thinning and, hence, a\nfaster onset of the plasmoid instability, compared to the rate determined by\nthe tearing mode alone.\n", "  Galaxy dynamics probes weak gravity at accelerations below the de Sitter\nscale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light and $H$\nis the Hubble parameter. Low and high redshift galaxies hereby offer a novel\nprobe of weak gravity in an evolving cosmology, satisfying\n$H(z)=H_0\\sqrt{1+\\omega_m(6z+12z^2+12z^3+6z^4+(6/5)z^5)}/(1+z)$ with baryonic\nmatter content $\\omega_m$ sans tension to $H_0$ in surveys of the Local\nUniverse. Galaxy rotation curves show anomalous galaxy dynamics in weak gravity\n$a_N<a_{dS}$ across a transition radius $r_t =\n4.7\\,\\mbox{kpc}\\,M_{11}^{1/2}(H_0/H)^\\frac{1}{2}$ in galaxies of mass\n$M=10^{11}M_\\odot M_{11}$, where $a_N$ is the Newtonian acceleration based on\nbaryonic matter content. We identify this behavior with a holographic origin of\ninertia from entanglement entropy, that introduces a $C^0$ onset across\n$a_N=a_{dS}$ with asymptotic behavior described by a Milgrom parameter\nsatisfying $a_0=\\omega_0/2\\pi$, where $\\omega_0=\\sqrt{1-q}H$ is a fundamental\neigenfrequency of the cosmological horizon. Extending an earlier confrontation\nwith data covering $0.003\\lesssim a_N/a_{dS}\\lesssim1$ at redshift $z\\sim0$ in\nLellie et al. (2016), the modest anomalous behavior in the Genzel et al. sample\nat redshifts $0.854\\le z\\le 2.282$ is found to be mostly due to clustering\n$0.36\\lesssim a_N/a_{dS}\\lesssim1$ close to the $C^0$ onset to weak gravity and\nan increase of up to 65\\% in $a_0$.\n", "  With unique distorted 1T structure and the associated in-plane anisotropic\nproperties, mono- and few-layer ReX2 (X=S, Se) have recently attracted\nparticular interest. Based on experiment and first-principles calculations, we\ninvestigate the fracture behavior of ReX2. We find that the cleaved edges of\nReX2 flakes usually form an angle of ~120{\\deg} or ~60{\\deg}. In order to\nunderstand such phenomenon, we perform comprehensive investigations on the\nuniaxial tensile stress-strain relation of monolayer and multi-layer ReX2\nsheets. Our numerical calculation shows that the particular cleaved edges of\nReX2 flakes are caused by unique anisotropic ultimate tensile strengths and\ncritical strains. We also calculate the stress-strain relation of WTe2, which\nexplains why their cleaved edges are not corresponding to the principle axes.\nOur proposed mechanism about the fracture angle has also been supported by the\ncalculated cleavage energies and surface energies for different edge surfaces.\n", "  Theoretical predictions for the core helium burning phase of stellar\nevolution are highly sensitive to the uncertain treatment of mixing at\nconvective boundaries. In the last few years, interest in constraining the\nuncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from\nasteroseismology. Recently, Spruit (2015) proposed a limit for the rate of\ngrowth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of\nmaterial ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the\nimplications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass\nand metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild\nboundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning,\nwhen core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest.\nOrdinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to\nsuch an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster\npopulations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses ($0.83 \\leq\nM/\\text{M}_\\odot \\leq 5$), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core\nhelium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or\ntheir number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore\nhelps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical\npredictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for $R_2$, the observed\nratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular\nclusters; the luminosity difference between these two groups; and in\nasteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in\nthe \\textit{Kepler} field.\n", "  Shell galaxies are understood to form through the collision of a dwarf galaxy\nwith an elliptical galaxy. Shell structures and kinematics have been noted to\nbe independent tools to measure the gravitational potential of the shell\ngalaxies. We compare theoretically the formation of shells in Type I shell\ngalaxies in different gravity theories in this work because this is so far\nmissing in the literature. We include Newtonian plus dark halo gravity, and two\nnon-Newtonian gravity models, MOG and MOND, in identical initial systems. We\ninvestigate the effect of dynamical friction, which by slowing down the dwarf\ngalaxy in the dark halo models limits the range of shell radii to low values.\nUnder the same initial conditions, shells appear on a shorter timescale and\nover a smaller range of distances in the presence of dark matter than in the\ncorresponding non-Newtonian gravity models. If galaxies are embedded in a dark\nmatter halo, then the merging time may be too rapid to allow multi-generation\nshell formation as required by observed systems because of the large dynamical\nfriction effect. Starting from the same initial state, in the dark halo model\nthe observation of small bright shells should be accompanied by large faint\nones, while for the case of MOG, the next shell generation patterns iterate\nwith a specific time delay. The first shell generation pattern shows a\ndegeneracy with the age of the shells and in different theories, but the\nrelative distance of the shells and the shell expansion velocity can break this\ndegeneracy.\n", "  The preflare phase of the flare SOL2011-08-09T03:52 is unique in its long\nduration, its coverage by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI) and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, and the presence of three\nwell-developed soft X-ray (SXR) peaks. No hard X-rays (HXR) are observed in the\npreflare phase. Here we report that also no associated radio emission at 17 GHz\nwas found despite the higher sensitivity of the radio instrument. The ratio\nbetween the SXR peaks and the upper limit of the radio peaks is larger by more\nthan one order of magnitude compared to regular flares. The result suggests\nthat the ratio between acceleration and heating in the preflare phase was\ndifferent than in regular flares. Acceleration to relativistic energies, if\nany, occurred with lower efficiency.\n", "  We present photometry and spectroscopy for 27 pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere\nwhite dwarfs (DAVs, a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) observed by the Kepler space\ntelescope up to K2 Campaign 8, an extensive compilation of observations with\nunprecedented duration (>75 days) and duty cycle (>90%). The space-based\nphotometry reveals pulsation properties previously inaccessible to ground-based\nobservations. We observe a sharp dichotomy in oscillation mode linewidths at\nroughly 800 s, such that white dwarf pulsations with periods exceeding 800 s\nhave substantially broader mode linewidths, more reminiscent of a damped\nharmonic oscillator than a heat-driven pulsator. Extended Kepler coverage also\npermits extensive mode identification: We identify the spherical degree of 61\nout of 154 unique radial orders, providing direct constraints of the rotation\nperiod for 20 of these 27 DAVs, more than doubling the number of white dwarfs\nwith rotation periods determined via asteroseismology. We also obtain\nspectroscopy from 4m-class telescopes for all DAVs with Kepler photometry.\nUsing these homogeneously analyzed spectra we estimate the overall mass of all\n27 DAVs, which allows us to measure white dwarf rotation as a function of mass,\nconstraining the endpoints of angular momentum in low- and intermediate-mass\nstars. We find that 0.51-to-0.73-solar-mass white dwarfs, which evolved from\n1.7-to-3.0-solar-mass ZAMS progenitors, have a mean rotation period of 35 hr\nwith a standard deviation of 28 hr, with notable exceptions for higher-mass\nwhite dwarfs. Finally, we announce an online repository for our Kepler data and\nfollow-up spectroscopy, which we collect at http://www.k2wd.org.\n", "  Vortices, turbulence, and unsteady non-laminar flows are likely both\nprominent and dynamically important features of astrophysical disks. Such\nstrongly nonlinear phenomena are often difficult, however, to simulate\naccurately, and are generally amenable to analytic treatment only in idealized\nform. In this paper, we explore the evolution of compressible two-dimensional\nflows using an implicit dual-time hydrodynamical scheme that strictly conserves\nvorticity (if applied to simulate inviscid flows for which Kelvin's Circulation\nTheorem is applicable). The algorithm is based on the work of Lerat, Falissard\n& Side (2007), who proposed it in the context of terrestrial applications such\nas the blade-vortex interactions generated by helicopter rotors. We present\nseveral tests of Lerat et al.'s vorticity-preserving approach, which we have\nimplemented to second-order accuracy, providing side-by-side comparisons with\nother algorithms that are frequently used in protostellar disk simulations. The\ncomparison codes include one based on explicit, second-order van-Leer\nadvection, one based on spectral methods, and another that implements a\nhigher-order Godunov solver. Our results suggest that Lerat et al's algorithm\nwill be useful for simulations of astrophysical environments in which vortices\nplay a dynamical role, and where strong shocks are not expected.\n", "  We have shown that Lyman-$\\alpha$ blobs (LABs) may still exist even at\n$z\\sim0.3$, about 7 billion years later than most other LABs known (Schirmer et\nal. 2016). Their luminous Ly$\\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters at $z\\sim0.3$ offer\nnew insights into the ionization mechanism. This paper focuses on the two X-ray\nbrightest LABs at $z\\sim0.3$, SDSS J0113$+$0106 (J0113) and SDSS J1155$-$0147\n(J1155), comparable in size and luminosity to `B1', one of the best-studied\nLABs at $z \\gtrsim$ 2. Our NuSTAR hard X-ray (3--30 keV) observations reveal\npowerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) with $L_{2-10{\\;\\rm\nkeV}}=(0.5$--$3)\\times10^{44}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. J0113 also faded by a\nfactor of $\\sim 5$ between 2014 and 2016, emphasizing that variable AGN may\ncause apparent ionization deficits in LABs. Joint spectral analyses including\nChandra data constrain column densities of $N_{\\rm\nH}=5.1^{+3.1}_{-3.3}\\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ (J0113) and $N_{\\rm\nH}=6.0^{+1.4}_{-1.1}\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ (J1155). J0113 is likely buried in\na torus with a narrow ionization cone, but ionizing radiation is also leaking\nin other directions as revealed by our Gemini/GMOS 3D spectroscopy. The latter\nshows a bipolar outflow over $10$ kpc, with a peculiar velocity profile that is\nbest explained by AGN flickering. X-ray analysis of J1155 reveals a weakly\nabsorbed AGN that may ionize over a wide solid angle, consistent with our 3D\nspectra. Extinction corrected [OIII] log-luminosities are high, $\\sim43.6$. The\nvelocity dispersions are low, $\\sim100$--$150$ km s$^{-1}$, even at the AGN\npositions. We argue that this is a combination of high extinction hiding the\nturbulent gas, and previous outflows that have cleared the escape paths for\ntheir successors.\n", "  Overabundances in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) of Earth's mantle can be\nexplained by conveyance from a singular, immense (3000 km in a diameter) \"Late\nVeneer\" impactor of chondritic composition, subsequent to lunar formation and\nterrestrial core-closure. Such rocky objects of approximately lunar mass (about\n0.01 M_E) ought to be differentiated, such that nearly all of their HSE payload\nis sequestered into iron cores. Here, we analyze the mechanical and chemical\nfate of the core of such a Late Veneer impactor, and trace how its HSEs are\nsuspended - and thus pollute - the mantle. For the statistically most-likely\noblique collision (about 45degree), the impactor's core elongates and\nthereafter disintegrates into a metallic hail of small particles (about 10 m).\nSome strike the orbiting Moon as sesquinary impactors, but most re-accrete to\nEarth as secondaries with further fragmentation. We show that a single oblique\nimpactor provides an adequate amount of HSEs to the primordial terrestrial\nsilicate reservoirs via oxidation of (<m-sized) metal particles with a hydrous,\npre-impact, early Hadean Earth.\n", "  In an earlier paper we modeled the far-infrared emission from a star-forming\ngalaxy using the photoionisation code CLOUDY and presented metallicity\nsensitive diagnostics based on far-infrared fine structure line ratios. Here,\nwe focus on the applicability of the [OIII]88/[NII]122 microns line ratio as a\ngas phase metallicity indicator in high redshift submillimetre luminous\ngalaxies. The [OIII]88/[NII]122 microns ratio is strongly dependent on the\nionization parameter (which is related to the total number of ionizing photons)\nas well as the gas electron density. We demonstrate how the ratio of 88/$122\ncontinuum flux measurements can provide a reasonable estimate of the ionization\nparameter while the availability of the [NII]205 microns line can constrain the\nelectron density. Using the [OIII]88/[NII]122 microns line ratios from a sample\nof nearby normal and star-forming galaxies we measure their gas phase\nmetallicities and find that their mass metallicity relation is consistent with\nthe one derived using optical emission lines. Using new, previously\nunpublished, Herschel spectroscopic observations of key far-infrared fine\nstructure lines of the z~3 galaxy HLSW-01 and additional published measurements\nof far-infrared fine structure lines of high-z submillimetre luminous galaxies\nwe derive gas phase metallicities using their [OIII]88/[NII]122 microns line\nratio. We find that the metallicities of these z~3 submm luminous galaxies are\nconsistent with solar metallicities and that they appear to follow the\nmass-metallicity relation expected for z~3 systems.\n", "  Cold hydrogen gas is the raw fuel for star formation in galaxies, and its\npartition into atomic and molecular phases is a key quantity for galaxy\nevolution. In this Letter, we combine Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray and Arecibo single-dish observations to estimate the molecular-to-atomic\nhydrogen mass ratio for massive star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim$ 0.2 extracted\nfrom the HIGHz survey, i.e., some of the most massive gas-rich systems\ncurrently known. We show that the balance between atomic and molecular hydrogen\nin these galaxies is similar to that of local main-sequence disks, implying\nthat atomic hydrogen has been dominating the cold gas mass budget of\nstar-forming galaxies for at least the past three billion years. In addition,\ndespite harboring gas reservoirs that are more typical of objects at the cosmic\nnoon, HIGHz galaxies host regular rotating disks with low gas velocity\ndispersions suggesting that high total gas fractions do not necessarily drive\nhigh turbulence in the interstellar medium.\n", "  Based on current models of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB), heavily\nobscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are expected to make up ~10% of the peak\nemission of the CXB and ~20% of the total population of AGN, yet few of these\nsources have been recorded and characterized in current surveys. Here we\npresent the Chandra follow-up observation of 14 AGN detected by Swift-BAT. For\nfive sources in the sample, NuSTAR observations in the 3-80 keV band are also\navailable. The X-ray spectral fitting over the 0.3-150 keV energy range allows\nus to determine the main X-ray spectral parameters, such as the photon index\nand the intrinsic absorption, of these objects, and to make hypotheses on the\nphysical structures responsible for the observed spectra. We find that 13 of\nthe 14 objects are absorbed AGN, and one is a candidate Compton thick AGN,\nhaving intrinsic absorption NH>1E24 cm^{-2}. Finally, we verified that the use\nof NuSTAR observations is strategic to strongly constrain the properties of\nobscured AGN, since the best-fit values we obtained for parameters such as the\npower-law photon index and the intrinsic absorption NH changed sometimes\nsignificantly fitting the spectra with and without the use of NuSTAR data.\n", "  We present the first release of the Czech Variable star catalogue that\ncurrently contains 1228 stars whose variability was discovered by 60 Czech\nobservers. The catalogue contains confirmed variable stars of various types,\nbut also candidates. We give precise coordinates, cross identification with\nother catalogues, information about constellation, variability type,\nbrightness, light elements, name of the discoverer and year of discovery. In\neighty-eight percent of stars the variability type is estimated, for more than\n60 % of the stars the light ephemerides are given.\n", "  Regardless of studies and debates over a century, the statistical origin of\nthe second law of thermodynamics still remains illusive. One essential obstacle\nis the lack of a proper theoretical formalism for non-equilibrium entropy. Here\nI revisit the seminal ideas about non-equilibrium statistical entropy due to\nBoltzmann and due to Gibbs, and synthesize them into a coherent and precise\nframework. Using this framework, I clarify the anthropomorphic principle of\nentropy, and analyze the evolution of entropy for classical Hamiltonian systems\nunder different experimental setups. I find that evolution of Boltzmann entropy\nobeys a Stochastic H-Theorem, which relates probability of Boltzmann entropy\nincreasing to that of decreasing. By contrast, the coarse-grained Gibbs entropy\nis monotonically increasing, if the microscopic dynamics is locally mixing, and\nthe initial state is a Boltzmann state. These results clarify the precise\nmeaning of the second law of thermodynamics for classical systems, and\ndemonstrate that it is the initial condition as a Boltzmann state that is\nultimately responsible for the arrow of time.\n", "  The Deep Impact spacecraft fly-by of comet 103P/Hartley 2 occurred on 2010\nNovember 4, one week after perihelion with a closest approach (CA) distance of\nabout 700 km. We used narrowband images obtained by the Medium Resolution\nImager (MRI) onboard the spacecraft to study the gas and dust in the innermost\ncoma. We derived an overall dust reddening of 15\\%/100 nm between 345 and 749\nnm and identified a blue enhancement in the dust coma in the sunward direction\nwithin 5 km from the nucleus, which we interpret as a localized enrichment in\nwater ice. OH column density maps show an anti-sunward enhancement throughout\nthe encounter except for the highest resolution images, acquired at CA, where a\nradial jet becomes visible in the innermost coma, extending up to 12 km from\nthe nucleus. The OH distribution in the inner coma is very different from that\nexpected for a fragment species. Instead, it correlates well with the water\nvapor map derived by the HRI-IR instrument onboard Deep Impact\n\\citep{AHearn2011}. Radial profiles of the OH column density and derived water\nproduction rates show an excess of OH emission during CA that cannot be\nexplained with pure fluorescence. We attribute this excess to a prompt emission\nprocess where photodissociation of H$_2$O directly produces excited\nOH*($A^2\\it{\\Sigma}^+$) radicals. Our observations provide the first direct\nimaging of Near-UV prompt emission of OH. We therefore suggest the use of a\ndedicated filter centered at 318.8 nm to directly trace the water in the coma\nof comets.\n", "  In this Letter we report the detection of chromospheric 3-minute oscillations\nin disk-integrated EUV irradiance observations during a solar flare. A wavelet\nanalysis of detrended Lyman-alpha (from GOES/EUVS) and Lyman continuum (from\nSDO/EVE) emission from the 2011 February 15 X-class flare (SOL2011-02-15T01:56)\nrevealed a $\\sim$3-minute period present during the flare's main phase. The\nformation temperature of this emission locates this radiation to the flare's\nchromospheric footpoints, and similar behaviour is found in the SDO/AIA\n1600\\AA\\ and 1700\\AA\\ channels, which are dominated by chromospheric continuum.\nThe implication is that the chromosphere responds dynamically at its acoustic\ncutoff frequency to an impulsive injection of energy. Since the 3-minute period\nwas not found at hard X-ray energies (50-100 keV) in RHESSI data we can state\nthat this 3-minute oscillation does not depend on the rate of energization of\nnon-thermal electrons. However, a second period of 120 s found in both hard\nX-ray and chromospheric emission is consistent with episodic electron\nenergization on 2-minute timescales. Our finding on the 3-minute oscillation\nsuggests that chromospheric mechanical energy should be included in the flare\nenergy budget, and the fluctuations in the Lyman-alpha line may influence the\ncomposition and dynamics of planetary atmospheres during periods of high\nactivity.\n", "  We present a precise and complete procedure for processing spectral data\nobserved by the 1-meter New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). The procedure is\nsuitable for both the sit-and-stare and raster-scan spectra. In this work, the\ngeometric distortions of the spectra are firstly corrected for subsequent\nprocesses. Then, considering the temporal changes and the remnants of spectral\nlines in the flat-field, the original flat-field matrix is split into four\nindependent components for ensuring a high precision flat-fielding correction,\nconsisting of the continuum gradient matrix, slit non-uniform matrix, CCD dust\nmatrix, and interference fringe matrix. Subsequently, the spectral line drifts\nand intensity fluctuations of the science data are further corrected. After\nprecise reduction with this procedure, the measuring accuracies of the Doppler\nvelocities for different spectral lines and of the oscillation curves of the\nchromosphere and photosphere are measured. The results show that the highest\nmeasuring accuracy of the Doppler velocity is within 100 ms-1, which indicates\nthat the characteristics of the photosphere and chromosphere can be studied\nco-spatially and co-temporally with the reduced spectra of NVST.\n", "  We study the prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy, Markarian 3, based on imaging and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy observations taken by the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory. We construct a deconvolved X-ray image, which reveals the S-shaped\nmorphology of the hot gas in the narrow line region (NLR). While this\nmorphology is similar to the radio and [O III] emission, the distribution of\nthe X-ray gas is broader than that obtained at these other wavelengths. By\nmapping the density and temperature distribution of the hot gas in the NLR, we\ndemonstrate the presence of shocks towards the west ($M=2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$) and\neast ($M=1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$). Moreover, we compute the flux ratios between the\n[O III] and $0.5-2$ keV band X-ray luminosity and show that it is non-uniform\nin the NLR with the western side of the NLR being more highly ionized. In\naddition, based on the Chandra grating data we investigate the line ratios of\nthe Si XIII triplet, which are not consistent with pure photoionization. Based\non these results, we suggest that in the NLR of Mrk 3 both photoionization and\ncollisional ionization act as excitation mechanisms. We conclude that the\ncanonical picture, in which photoionization is solely responsible for exciting\nthe interstellar medium in the NLR of Seyfert galaxies, may be overly\nsimplistic. Given that weak and small-scale radio jets are commonly detected in\nSeyfert galaxies, it is possible that shock heating plays a non-negligible role\nin the NLR of these galaxies.\n", "  Bulk Au-Fe alloys separate into Au-based fcc and Fe-based bcc phases, but\nL1$_0$ and L1$_2$ orderings were reported in single-phase Au-Fe nanoparticles.\nMotivated by these observations, we study the structural and ordering\nenergetics in this alloy by combining density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations with effective Hamiltonian techniques: a cluster expansion with\nstructural filters, and the configuration-dependent lattice deformation model.\nThe phase separation tendency in Au-Fe persists even if the fcc-bcc\ndecomposition is suppressed. The relative stability of disordered bcc and fcc\nphases observed in nanoparticles is reproduced, but the fully ordered L1$_0$\nAuFe, L1$_2$ Au$_3$Fe, and L1$_2$ AuFe$_3$ structures are unstable in DFT.\nHowever, a tendency to form concentration waves at the corresponding [001]\nordering vector is revealed in nearly-random alloys in a certain range of\nconcentrations. This incipient ordering requires enrichment by Fe relative to\nthe equiatomic composition, which may occur in the core of a nanoparticle due\nto the segregation of Au to the surface. Effects of magnetism on the chemical\nordering are also discussed.\n", "  We address a question whether the observed light curves of X-ray flares\noriginating deep in galactic cores can give us independent constraints on the\nmass of the central supermassive black hole. To this end we study four\nbrightest flares that have been recorded from Sagittarius A*. They all exhibit\nan asymmetric shape consistent with a combination of two intrinsically separate\npeaks that occur at a certain time-delay with respect to each other, and are\ncharacterized by their mutual flux ratio and the profile of raising/declining\nparts. Such asymmetric shapes arise naturally in the scenario of a temporary\nflash from a source orbiting near a super- massive black hole, at radius of\nonly 10-20 gravitational radii. An interplay of relativistic effects is\nresponsible for the modulation of the observed light curves: Doppler boosting,\ngravitational redshift, light focusing, and light-travel time delays. We find\nthe flare properties to be in agreement with the simulations (our ray-tracing\ncode sim5lib). The inferred mass for each of the flares comes out in agreement\nwith previous estimates based on orbits of stars; the latter have been observed\nat radii and over time-scales two orders of magnitude larger than those typical\nfor the X-ray flares, so the two methods are genuinely different. We test the\nreliability of the method by applying it to another object, namely, the Seyfert\nI galaxy RE J1034+396.\n", "  We report the characterization of the first $62$ MaNGA Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN) hosts in the Fifth Product Launch (MPL-5) and the definition of a control\nsample of non-active galaxies. This control sample - comprising two galaxies\nfor each AGN - was selected in order to match the AGN hosts in terms of stellar\nmass, redshift, visual morphology and inclination. The stellar masses are in\nthe range $9.4<\\log(M/M_\\odot)<11.5$, and most objects have redshifts $\\leq\n0.08$. The AGN sample is mostly comprised of low-luminosity AGN, with only 17\nnuclei with $L([OIII]\\lambda 5007)\\geq 3.8\\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (that we\ncall \"strong AGN\"). The stellar population of the control sample galaxies\nwithin the inner $1$-$3$ kpc is dominated by the old ($\\sim$ $4$ - $13$ Gyr)\nage component, with a small contribution of intermediate age ($\\sim 640$-$940$\nMyr) and young stars ($\\leq 40$ Myr) to the total light at $5700\\AA$. While the\nweaker AGN show a similar age distribution to that of the control galaxies, the\nstrong AGN show an increased contribution of younger stars and a decreased\ncontribution of older stars. Examining the relationship between the AGN stellar\npopulation properties and $L([OIII])$, we find that with increasing\n$L([OIII])$, the AGN exhibit a decreasing contribution from the oldest ($>4$\nGyr) stellar population relative to control galaxies, but have an increasing\ncontribution from the younger components with ages $\\sim 40$ Myr. We also find\na correlation of the mean age differences (AGN - control) with $L([OIII])$, in\nthe sense that more luminous AGN are younger than the control objects, while\nthe low-luminosity AGN seem to be older. These results support a connection\nbetween the growth of the galaxy bulge via formation of new stars and the\ngrowth of the Supermassive Black Hole via matter accretion in the AGN phase.\n", "  We present the first HI spectral line images of the nearby, star-forming\ndwarf galaxies UGC11411 and UGC 8245, acquired as part of the \"Observing for\nUniversity Classes\" program with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).\nThese low-resolution images localize the HI gas and reveal the bulk kinematics\nof each system. Comparing with HST broadband and ground-based H{\\alpha}\nimaging, we find that the ongoing star formation in each galaxy is associated\nwith the highest HI mass surface density regions. UGC 8245 has a much lower\ncurrent star formation rate than UGC 11411, which harbors very high surface\nbrightness H{\\alpha} emission in the inner disk and diffuse, lower surface\nbrightness nebular gas that extends well beyond the stellar disk as traced by\nHST. We measure the dynamical masses of each galaxy and find that the halo of\nUGC 11411 is more than an order of magnitude more massive than the halo of UGC\n8245, even though the HI and stellar masses of the sources are similar. We show\nthat UGC8245 shares similar physical properties with other well-studied\nlow-mass galaxies, while UGC11411 is more highly dark matter dominated. Both\nsystems have negative peculiar velocities that are associated with a coherent\nflow of nearby galaxies at high supergalactic latitude.\n", "  A BIonic diode is constructed of two polygonal manifolds connected by a\nChern-Simons manifold. The shape and the angle between atoms of molecules on\nthe boundary of two polygonal manifolds are completely different. For this\nreason, electrons on the Chern-Simons manifold are repelled by molecules at the\nboundary of one manifold and absorbed by molecules on the boundary of another\nmanifold. The attractive and repulsive forces between electrons are carried by\nmasive photons. For example, when two non-similar trigonal manifolds join to\neach other, one non-symmetrical hexagonal manifold is emerged and the exchanged\nphotons form Chern-Simons fields which live on a Chern-Simons manifold in a\nBIon. While, for a hexagonal manifold, with similar trigonal manifolds, the\nphotons exchanged between two trigonal manifolds cancel the effect of each\nother and BIonic energy becomes zero. Also, exchanging photons between\nheptagonal and pentagonal manifolds lead to the motion of electrons on the\nChern-Simons manifold and formation of BIonic diode. The mass of photons depend\non the shape of molecules on the boundary of manifolds and the length of BIon\nin a gap between two manifolds.\n", "  We present the first statistical study of the anisotropy of the magnetic\nfield turbulence in the solar wind between 1 and 200Hz, i.e. from proton to\nsub-electron scales. We consider 93 10-minute intervals of Cluster/STAFF\nmeasurements. We find that the fluctuations $\\delta B_{\\perp}^2$ are not\ngyrotropic at a given frequency $f$, a property already observed at larger\nscales ($\\parallel$/$\\perp$ mean parallel/perpendicular to the average magnetic\n${\\bf B_0}$). This non-gyrotropy gives indications on the angular distribution\nof the wave vectors ${\\bf k}$: at $f <$ 10Hz, we find that $k_{\\perp}\\gg\nk_{\\parallel}$, mainly in the fast wind; at $f >$ 10Hz, fluctuations with a\nnon-negligible $k_{\\parallel}$ are also present. We then consider the\nanisotropy ratio $\\delta B_{\\parallel}^2/\\delta B_{\\perp}^2$, which is a\nmeasure of the magnetic compressibility of the fluctuations. This ratio, always\nsmaller than 1, increases with $f.$ It reaches a value showing that the\nfluctuations are more or less isotropic at electron scales, for $f \\geq 50$Hz.\nFrom 1 to 15-20Hz, there is a strong correlation between the observed\ncompressibility and the one expected for the kinetic Alfv\\'en waves (KAW),\nwhich only depends on the total plasma $\\beta$. For $f > $ 15-20Hz, the\nobserved compressibility is larger than expected for KAW; and it is stronger in\nthe slow wind: this could be an indication of the presence of a slow-ion\nacoustic mode of fluctuations, which is more compressive and is favored by the\nlarger values of the electron to proton temperature ratio generally observed in\nthe slow wind.\n", "  We study the influence of chain stiffness on droplet flow in a nano-channel,\ncoated with semiflexible hydrophobic polymers by means of non-equilibrium\nmolecular-dynamics simulations. The studied system is then a moving droplet in\nthe slit channel, coexisting with its vapor and subjected to periodic boundary\nconditions in the flow direction. The polymer chains, grafted by the terminal\nbead to the confining walls, are described by a coarse-grained model that\naccounts for chain connectivity, excluded volume interactions and local chain\nstiffness. The rheological, frictional and dynamical properties of the brush\nare explored over a wide range of persistence lengths. We find a rich behavior\nof polymer conformations and concomitant changes in the friction properties\nover the wide range of studied polymer stiffnesses. A rapid decrease in the\ndroplet velocity was observed as the rigidity of the chains is increased for\npolymers whose persistence length is smaller than their contour length. We find\na strong relation between the internal dynamics of the brush and the droplet\ntransport properties, which could be used to tailor flow properties by surface\nfunctionalization. The monomers of the brush layer, under the droplet, present\na collective \"treadmill belt\" like dynamics which can only be present due the\nthe existence of grafted chains. We describe its changes in spatial extension\nupon variations of polymer stiffness, with bidimensional velocity and density\nprofiles. The deformation of the polymer brushes due to the presence of the\ndroplet is analyzed in detail. Lastly, the droplet-gas interaction is studied\nby varying the liquid to gas ratio, observing a 16% speed increase for droplets\nthat flow close to each other, compared to a train of droplets that present a\nlarge gap between consecutive droplets.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the N$\\acute{e}$el and Kekul$\\acute{e}$ valence bond\nsolids quantum criticality in graphene Dirac semimetal. Considering the quartic\nfour-fermion interaction $g(\\bar{\\psi}_i\\Gamma_{ij}\\psi_j)^2$ that contains\nspin,valley, and sublattice degrees of freedom in the continuum field theory,\nwe find the microscopic symmetry is spontaneously broken when the coupling $g$\nis greater than a critical value $g_c$. The symmetry breaking gaps out the\nfermion and leads to semimetal-insulator transition. All possible quartic\nfermion-bilinear interactions give rise to the uniform critical coupling, which\nexhibits the multicritical point for various orders and the Landau-forbidden\nquantum critical point. We also investigate the typical critical point between\nN$\\acute{e}$el and Kekul$\\acute{e}$ valence bond solid transition when the\nsymmetry is broken. The quantum criticality is captured by the\nWess-Zumino-Witten term and there exist a mutual-duality for\nN$\\acute{e}$el-Kekul$\\acute{e}$ VBS order. We show the emergent spinon in the\nN$\\acute{e}$el-Kekul$\\acute{e}$ VBS transition , from which we conclude the\nphase transition is a deconfined quantum critical point. Additionally, the\nconnection between the index theorem and zero energy mode bounded by the\ntopological defect in the Kekul$\\acute{e}$ VBS phase is studied to reveal the\nN$\\acute{e}$el-Kekul$\\acute{e}$ VBS duality.\n", "  Spatially resolving the immediate surroundings of young stars is a key\nchallenge for the planet formation community. SPHERE on the VLT represents an\nimportant step forward by increasing the opportunities offered by optical or\nnear-infrared imaging instruments to image protoplanetary discs. The Guaranteed\nTime Observation Disc team has concentrated much of its efforts on polarimetric\ndifferential imaging, a technique that enables the efficient removal of stellar\nlight and thus facilitates the detection of light scattered by the disc within\na few au from the central star. These images reveal intriguing complex disc\nstructures and diverse morphological features that are possibly caused by\nongoing planet formation in the disc. An overview of the recent advances\nenabled by SPHERE is presented.\n", "  Advanced satellite-based frequency transfers by TWCP and IPPP have been\nperformed between NICT and KRISS. We confirm that the disagreement between them\nis less than 1x10^{-16} at an averaging time of several days. Additionally, an\nintercontinental frequency ratio measurement of Sr and Yb optical lattice\nclocks was directly performed by TWCP. We achieved an uncertainty at the\nmid-10^{-16} level after a total measurement time of 12 hours. The frequency\nratio was consistent with the recently reported values within the uncertainty.\n", "  The V380 Ori NE bipolar outflow was imaged in the SiO and CO J = 1 - 0 lines,\nand dense cores in L1641 were observed in the 2.0-0.89 mm continuum. The highly\ncollimated SiO jet shows point-symmetric oscillation patterns in both position\nand velocity, which suggests that the jet axis is precessing and the driving\nsource may belong to a non-coplanar binary system. By considering the position\nand velocity variabilities together, accurate jet parameters were derived. The\nprotostellar system is viewed nearly edge-on, and the jet has a flow speed of\n35 km/s and a precession period of 1600 years. The CO outflow length gives a\ndynamical timescale of 6300 years, and the protostar must be extremely young.\nThe inferred binary separation of 6-70 au implies that this protobinary system\nmay have been formed through the disk instability process. The continuum\nspectra of L1641 dense cores indicate that the emission comes from dust, and\nthe fits with modified blackbody functions give emissivity power indices of\nbeta = 0.3-2.2. The emissivity index shows a positive correlation with the\nmolecular line width, but no strong correlation with bolometric luminosity or\ntemperature. V380 Ori NE has a particularly low value of beta = 0.3, which\ntentatively suggests the presence of millimeter-sized dust grains. Because the\ndust growth takes millions of years, much longer than the protostellar age,\nthis core may have produced large grains in the starless core stage. HH 34 MMS\nand HH 147 MMS also have low emissivity indices.\n", "  We present an extended version of the recently proposed \"LLOB\" model for the\ndynamics of latent liquidity in financial markets. By allowing for finite\ncancellation and deposition rates within a continuous reaction-diffusion setup,\nwe account for finite memory effects on the dynamics of the latent order book.\nWe compute in particular the finite memory corrections to the square root\nimpact law, as well as the impact decay and the permanent impact of a\nmeta-order. The latter is found to be linear in the traded volume and\nindependent of the trading rate, as dictated by no-arbitrage arguments. In\naddition, we consider the case of a spectrum of cancellation and deposition\nrates, which allows us to obtain a square root impact law for moderate\nparticipation rates, as observed empirically. Our multi-scale framework also\nprovides an alternative solution to the so-called price diffusivity puzzle in\nthe presence of a long-range correlated order flow.\n", "  We present first strong observational evidence that the X-ray cool-core bias\nor the apparent bias in the abundance of relaxed clusters is absent in our\nREFLEX volume-limited sample (ReVols). We show that these previously observed\nbiases are due to the survey selection method such as for an flux-limited\nsurvey, and are not due to the inherent nature of X-ray selection. We also find\nthat the X-ray luminosity distributions of clusters for the relaxed and for the\ndisturbed clusters are distinct and a displacement of approximately 60 per cent\nis required to match two distributions. Our results suggest that to achieve\nmore precise scaling relation one may need to take the morphology of clusters\nand their fractional abundance into account.\n", "  A systematic search for axial octupole deformation in the actinides and\nsuperheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=88-126$ and neutron numbers from\ntwo-proton drip line up to $N=210$ has been performed in covariant density\nfunctional theory (DFT) using four state-of-the-art covariant energy density\nfunctionals representing different model classes. The nuclei in the $Z\\sim 96,\nN\\sim 196$ region of octupole deformation have been investigated in detail and\nthe systematic uncertainties in the description of their observables have been\nquantified. Similar region of octupole deformation exists also in Skyrme DFT\nand microscopic+macroscopic approach but it is centered at somewhat different\nparticle numbers. Theoretical uncertainties in the predictions of the regions\nof octupole deformation are increasing on going to superheavy nuclei with\n$Z\\sim 120, N\\sim 190$. There are no octupole deformed nuclei for $Z=112-126$\nin covariant DFT calculations. This agrees with Skyrme DFT calculations, but\ndisagrees with Gogny DFT and microscopic+macroscopic calculations which predict\nextended $Z\\sim 120, N\\sim 190$ region of octupole deformation.\n", "  The first step in any formalism that aims to connect a many-nucleon theory of\nnucleon-nucleus scattering and the concept of an optical model potential in the\nsense pioneered by Feshbach is to explain what is meant by the optical model\nwavefunction. By definition this is a function of a single space coordinate\nplus a set of single nucleon internal variables. This article gives a critique\nof the definitio as it is frequently expressed in 2nd Quantisation language and\nsuggest a new definition which is more consistent with the requirements of\nantisymmetry and translational invariance. A modification of the time-dependent\nGreen's function formalism is suggested.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR)\nand star-formation rate (SFR) for Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-mass\nprogenitors from z = 0.2 - 2.5. We source galaxies from the Ks-band selected\nZFOURGE survey, which includes multi-wavelenth data spanning 0.3 - 160um. We\nuse decomposition software to split the observed SEDs of our galaxies into\ntheir active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming components, which allows us\nto estimate BHARs and SFRs from the infrared (IR). We perform tests to check\nthe robustness of these estimates, including a comparison to BHARs and SFRs\nderived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find as the\nprogenit- ors evolve, their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their\nBHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors\nexhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 +/- 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are\n0.39 +/- 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost\nflat slope when adopting X-ray/AGN-selected or mass-limited samples and is\nlikely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different\nevolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the\npotential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for\nevolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that\nBHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts\nover the idea that the suppression of star-formation is predominantly driven by\nluminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).\n", "  An arbitrarily-shaped optical potential on a discrete photonic lattice, which\ntransversely drifts at a speed larger than the maximum one allowed by the light\ncone of the lattice band, becomes reflectionless. Such an intriguing result,\nwhich arises from the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice, is\npeculiar to discretized light and does not have any counterpart for light\nscattering in continuous optical media. A drifting non-Hermitian optical\npotential of the Kramers-Kronig type is also an invisible potential, i.e. a\ndiscrete optical beam crosses the drifting potential without being distorted,\ndelayed nor advanced.\n", "  In this work, using solutions from a local gyrokinetic flux-tube code\ncombined with higher order ballooning theory, a new analytical approach is\ndeveloped to reconstruct the global linear mode structure with associated\nglobal mode frequency. In addition to the isolated mode (IM), which usually\npeaks on the outboard mid-plane, the higher order ballooning theory has also\ncaptured other types of less unstable global modes: (a) the weakly asymmetric\nballooning theory (WABT) predicts a mixed mode (MM) that undergoes a small\npoloidal shift away from the outboard mid-plane, (b) a relatively more stable\ngeneral mode (GM) balloons on the top (or bottom) of the tokamak plasma. In\nthis paper, an analytic approach is developed to combine these disconnected\nanalytical limits into a single generalised ballooning theory (GBT). This is\nused to investigate how an IM behaves under the effect of sheared toroidal\nflow. For small values of flow an IM initially converts into a MM where the\nresults of WABT are recaptured, and eventually, as the flow increases, the mode\nasymptotically becomes a GM on the top (or bottom) of the plasma. This may be\nan ingredient in models for understanding why in some experimental scenarios,\ninstead of large edge localised modes (ELMs), small ELMs are observed. Finally,\nour theory can have other important consequences, especially for calculations\ninvolving Reynolds stress driven intrinsic rotation through the radial\nasymmetry in the global mode structures. Understanding the intrinsic rotation\nis significant because external torque in a plasma the size of ITER is expected\nto be relatively low.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal with a pair of Weyl nodes accommodates chiral states on its\nflat surface if the Weyl nodes are projected onto two different points in the\ncorresponding surface Brillouin zone. These surface states are collectively\nreferred to as a Fermi arc as they appear to connect the projected Weyl nodes.\nThis statement assumes that translational symmetry is present on the surface\nand hence electron momentum is a conserved quantity. It is unclear how chiral\nsurface states are modified if the translational symmetry is broken by a\nparticular system structure. Here, focusing on a straight step edge of finite\nwidth, we numerically analyze how chiral surface states appear on it. It is\nshown that the chiral surface states are algebraically (i.e., weakly) localized\nnear the step edge. It is also shown that the appearance of chiral surface\nstates is approximately determined by a simple condition characterized by the\nnumber of unit atomic layers constituting the step edge together with the\nlocation of the Weyl nodes.\n", "  A five-dimensional interpolation method and corresponding computer program\nare developed for using published calculations to determine the non-LTE\ncorrection {\\Delta\\}NLTE to the lithium abundance log{\\epsilon}(Li) derived\nfrom the Li I 6707.8 {\\AA} line. The {\\Delta\\}NLTE values is determined from\nthe following five parameters: {\\Delta\\}NLTE the effective temperature Teff,\nthe acceleration of gravity logg, the metallicity index [Fe/H], the\nmicroturbulent velocity Vt, and the LTE Li abundance log {\\epsilon}(Li). The\nprogram is used to calculate values of {\\Delta\\}NLTE and the non-LTE Li\nabundance for 91 single bright giants from the list of Lebre, et al. By\ncombining these results with data for 55 stars, we obtain the non-LTE values of\nlog {\\epsilon}(Li) for 146 FGK-giants and supergiants. We confirm that, in the\nspectra of most of these stars, it is only possible to estimate for them an\nupper limit for the Li abundance. A large spread is confirmed in log\n{\\epsilon}(Li) for stars with masses M<6Msun. A comparison of these results\nwith model calculations of stars confirms the unique sensitivity of the lithium\nabundance to the initial rotation velocity V0. We discuss the giants and\nsupergiants with lithium abundances log {\\epsilon}(Li) = 1.4 +- 0.3, which\ncould have a rotation velocity V0=0 km/s and have already undergone deep\nconvective mixing. Li-rich giants with lithium abundances log {\\epsilon}(Li)>2\nand nearly up to the initial value of log {\\epsilon}(Li) = 3.2 +- 0.1 are\nexamined. It is shown that the fraction of Li-rich giants with V0 = 0 - 50 km/s\nis consistent with current evolutionary models. The other stars of this type,\nas well as all of the \"super Li-rich\" giants, for which the standard theory is\nuntenable, can be explained by invoking the hypothesis of recent lithium\nsynthesis in the star or an alternative hypothesis according to which a giant\nplanet is engulfed by the star.\n", "  We propose a scheme for preparation of large-scale entangled $GHZ$ states and\n$W$ states with neutral Rydberg atoms. The scheme mainly depends on Rydberg\nantiblockade effect, i.e., as the Rydberg-Rydberg-interaction (RRI) strength\nand the detuning between the atom transition frequency and the classical laser\nfrequency satisfies some certain conditions, the effective Rabi oscillation\nbetween the two ground states and the two excitation Rydberg states would be\ngenerated. The prominent advantage is that both two-multiparticle $GHZ$ states\nand two-multiparticle $W$ states can be fused in this model, especially the\nsuccess probability for fusion of $GHZ$ states can reach unit. In addition, the\nimperfections induced by the spontaneous emission is also discussed through\nnumerical simulation.\n", "  The complex refractive index m=n+ik of a particle is an intrinsic property\nwhich cannot be directly measured, it must be inferred from its extrinsic\nproperties such as the scattering and absorption cross-sections. Bohren and\nHuffman called this approach describing the dragon from its tracks, since the\ninversion of Lorenz-Mie theory equations is intractable without the use of\ncomputers. This article describes PyMieScatt, an open-source module for Python\nthat contains functionality for solving the inverse problem for complex m using\nextensive optical and physical properties as input, and calculating regions\nwhere valid solutions may exist within the error bounds of laboratory\nmeasurements. Additionally, the module has comprehensive capabilities for\nstudying homogeneous and coated single spheres, as well as ensembles of\nhomogeneous spheres with user-defined size distributions, making it a complete\ntool for studying the optical behavior of spherical particles.\n", "  The origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is still a fascinating field of\nresearch nowadays. While we have been collecting more and more observationally\nconstrained properties of GRB-physics, new theoretical results on the\nprogenitor evolution (be it stellar or compact object) have also emerged. I\nreview some of the most promising progenitor theories for forming a\nshort-duration GRB. A special emphasis is put on the hypothetical case of\nforming a short-duration GRB through the double black hole merger scenario --\nin which case we may expect to observe a gravitational wave emission too. The\nchemically homogeneous channel for forming a black hole binary is discussed,\nand the stellar progenitors (so called TWUIN stars) are introduced. The birth\nplace of these short-duration GRBs with a gravitational wave counterpart may be\nlow-metallicity, starforming dwarf galaxies.\n", "  Superconductors at the atomic two-dimensional (2D) limit are the focus of an\nenduring fascination in the condensed matter community. This is because, with\nreduced dimensions, the effects of disorders, fluctuations, and correlations in\nsuperconductors become particularly prominent at the atomic 2D limit; thus such\nsuperconductors provide opportunities to tackle tough theoretical and\nexperimental challenges. Here, based on the observation of ultrathin 2D\nsuperconductivity in mono- and bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) with\nelectric-double-layer (EDL) gating, we found that the critical sheet carrier\ndensity required to achieve superconductivity in a monolayer MoS$_2$ flake can\nbe as low as 0.55*10$^{14}$cm$^{-2}$, which is much lower than those values in\nthe bilayer and thicker cases in previous report and also our own observations.\nFurther comparison of the phonon dispersion obtained by ab initio calculations\nindicated that the phonon softening of the acoustic modes around the M point\nplays a key role in the gate-induced superconductivity within the\nBardeen-Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) theory framework. This result might help enrich\nthe understanding of 2D superconductivity with EDL gating.\n", "  A theory is proposed, in which the basic elements of reality are assumed to\nbe something called modes. Particles are interpreted as composites of modes,\ncorresponding to eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian of modes. At the\nfundamental level of the proposed theory, there are two basic modes only,whose\nspinor spaces are the two smallest nontrivial representation spaces of the\nSL(2,C) group, one being the complex conjugate of the other. All other modes\nare constructed from the two basic modes, making use of the operations of\ndirect sum and direct product for related spinor spaces. Accompanying the\nconstruction of direct-product modes, interactions among modes are introduced\nin a natural way, with the interaction Hamiltonian given from mappings between\nthe corresponding state spaces. The interaction Hamiltonian thus obtained turn\nout to possess a form, which is similar to a major part of the interaction\nHamiltonian in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory. In the proposed\ntheory, it is possible for the second-order perturbation expansion of energy to\nbe free from ultraviolet divergence. This expansion is used to derive some\napproximate relations for neutrino masses; in particular, a rough estimate is\nobtained for the ratio of mass differences of neutrinos, which gives the\ncorrect order of magnitude compared with the experimental result.\n", "  This review describes the most common theories behind long-duration gamma-ray\nburst progenitors. I discuss two astrophysical scenarios: the collapsar and the\nmagnetar models. According to their requirements, the progenitor should be an\nenvelope-free massive star with a fast rotating, collapsing iron core. Such an\nobject, called a TWUIN star, may be produced by chemically homogeneous\nevolution either from a massive single star or a massive binary system. Various\noutcomes of this evolutionary path (e.g. supernova explosions and gravitational\nwave production) are also mentioned, and directions for future research are\nsuggested. In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, my hope is to present a\ntimely overview on how stellar astrophysicists are searching for progenitor\nmodels of long-duration gamma-ray bursts, and what they have found so far.\n", "  We show that the properties of the electron beam and bright X-rays produced\nby a laser wakefield accelerator can be predicted if the distance over which\nthe laser self-focuses and compresses prior to self-injection is taken into\naccount. A model based on oscillations of the beam inside a plasma bubble shows\nthat performance is optimised when the plasma length is matched to the laser\ndepletion length. With a 200~TW laser pulse this results in an X-ray beam with\nmedian photon energy of 20 keV, $> 10^{9}$ photons per shot and a peak\nbrightness of $4 \\times 10^{23}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mrad$^{-2}$ mm$^{-2}$ (0.1 %\nBW)$^{-1}$.\n", "  Gravitational waves were discovered with the detection of binary black hole\nmergers and they should also be detectable from lower mass neutron star\nmergers. These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive\nisotopes that can power an electromagnetic signal called a kilonova. The\ngravitational wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron star merger in\nthe nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance\nestimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly\nfading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC4993, which is spatially\ncoincident with GW170817 and a weak short gamma-ray burst. The transient has\nphysical parameters broadly matching the theoretical predictions of blue\nkilonovae from neutron star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can\nbe explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 +/- 0.01 Msol, with an opacity of\nkappa <= 0.5 cm2/gm at a velocity of 0.2 +/- 0.1c. The power source is\nconstrained to have a power law slope of beta = -1.2 +/- 0.3, consistent with\nradioactive powering from r-process nuclides. We identify line features in the\nspectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (90 < A < 140). As it\nfades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and emission may have contribution by\na higher opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component. This indicates that neutron\nstar mergers produce gravitational waves, radioactively powered kilonovae, and\nare a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.\n", "  We examine the fraction of massive ($M_{*}>10^{10} M_{\\odot}$), compact\nstar-forming galaxies (cSFGs) that host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at\n$z\\sim2$. These cSFGs are likely the direct progenitors of the compact\nquiescent galaxies observed at this epoch, which are the first population of\npassive galaxies to appear in large numbers in the early Universe. We identify\ncSFGs that host an AGN using a combination of Hubble WFC3 imaging and Chandra\nX-ray observations in four fields: the Chandra Deep Fields, the Extended Groth\nStrip, and the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. We find that\n$39.2^{+3.9}_{-3.6}$\\% (65/166) of cSFGs at $1.4<z<3.0$ host an X-ray detected\nAGN. This fraction is 3.2 times higher than the incidence of AGN in extended\nstar-forming galaxies with similar masses at these redshifts. This difference\nis significant at the $6.2\\sigma$ level. Our results are consistent with models\nin which cSFGs are formed through a dissipative contraction that triggers a\ncompact starburst and concurrent growth of the central black hole. We also\ndiscuss our findings in the context of cosmological galaxy evolution\nsimulations that require feedback energy to rapidly quench cSFGs. We show that\nthe AGN fraction peaks precisely where energy injection is needed to reproduce\nthe decline in the number density of cSFGs with redshift. Our results suggest\nthat the first abundant population of massive, quenched galaxies emerged\ndirectly following a phase of elevated supermassive black hole growth and\nfurther hints at a possible connection between AGN and the rapid quenching of\nstar formation in these galaxies.\n", "  The discovery by Advanced LIGO/Virgo of gravitational waves from the binary\nneutron star (NS) merger GW170817, and subsequently by astronomers of transient\ncounterparts across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, has initiated the era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy. Given the slew of papers appearing on this event, I\nthought it useful to summarize the EM discoveries in the context of theoretical\nmodels and present my views on the major take-away lessons from this watershed\nevent. The weak GRB discovered in close time coincidence with GW170817, and\npotential evidence for a more powerful off-axis relativistic jet (initially\nbeamed away from our line of sight) from the delayed rise of a non-thermal\nX-ray and radio orphan afterglow, provides the most compelling evidence yet\nthat cosmological short GRBs originate from binary NS mergers. The luminosity\nand colors of the early optical emission discovered within a day of the merger\nagrees strikingly well with original predictions (Metzger et al. 2010) for\n\"kilonova\" emission powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei, the\nNS merger origin of which was initially proposed by Lattimer & Schramm 1974.\nThe transition of the spectral energy distribution to NIR wavelengths on\ntimescales of days matches predictions by Barnes & Kasen 2013 and Tanaka &\nHotokezaka 2013 if a portion of the ejecta contains heavy r-process nuclei with\nhigher opacities. The \"blue\" and \"red\" ejecta components may possess distinct\norigins (e.g. dynamical ejecta versus accretion disk outflows), with key\nimplications for the merger physics and the properties of neutron stars. I\noutline the diversity in the EM emission expected from additional\nmergers-observed with different binary masses and viewing angles-discovered\nonce LIGO/Virgo reach design sensitivity and NS mergers are discovered as\nfrequently as once per week.\n", "  The three gravitational wave events detected by LIGO are opening a new era\nfor high- energy astrophysics. Nevertheless, location of such events remain\nunknown. A promising solution to the localization problem is to find an\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterpart of GW- generating events, such as binary\nneutron star mergers (BNS). Indeed, their GW emission will be above sensitivity\nthreshold in the near future. BNS are also considered as short Gamma Ray Bursts\n(sGRB) progenitors. However, sGRB are highly beamed. In this study, we will\ntherefore focus on another EM counterpart candidate: the cocoon afterglow. The\npropagation of the GRB jet inside the matter ejected by the BNS produces a\ncocoon. Then, similarly to the GRB afterglow, a cocoon afterglow is produced,\nbut with a mildly relativistic velocity. Firstly, we propose a model that gives\nthe full hydrodynamic evolution of the cocoon including the mildly relativistic\nregime. Then we calculate the cocoon afterglow emission in X-ray, optical and\nradio wavelengths. Finally, we compare the cocoon afterglow emission to the GRB\nafterglow emission and conclude that the cocoon afterglow is a promising EM\ncounterpart.\n", "  Many aspects of solar energy and policies to tackle the energy transition\nhave been neglected. Even though the earth is plenty of sun energy, our planet\nis not plenty of resources to transform that energy into electricity. This is a\ncase between many others where an strongly optimistic bias is shadowing the\nwhite elephant in the room.\n", "  In the last ten years, the technology of differential geometry, ubiquitous in\ngravitational physics, has found its place in the field of optics. It has been\nsuccessfully used in the design of optical metamaterials, through a technique\nnow known as \"transformation optics\". This method, however, only applies for\nthe particular class of metamaterials known as impedance matched, that is,\nmaterials whose electric permittivity is equal to their magnetic permeability.\nIn that case, the material may be described by a spacetime metric. In the\npresent work we will introduce a generalization of the geometric methods of\ntransformation optics to situations in which the material is not impedance\nmatched. In such situation, the material -or more precisely, its constitutive\ntensor- will not be described by a metric only. We bring in a second tensor,\nwith the local symmetries of the Weyl tensor, the \"$W$-tensor\". In the\ngeometric optics approximation we show how the properties of the $W$-tensor are\nrelated to the asymmetric transmission of the material. We apply this feature\ninto the design of a particularly interesting set of asymmetric materials.\nThese materials are birefringent when light rays approach the material in a\ngiven direction, but behave just like vacuum when the rays have the opposite\ndirection with the appropriate polarization (or, in some cases, independently\nof the polarization).\n", "  We study the equations of conformal gravity, as given by Mannheim, in the\nweak field limit, so that a linear approximation is adequate. Specializing to\nstatic fields with spherical symmetry, we obtain a second-order equation for\none of the metric functions. We obtain the Green function for this equation,\nand represent the metric function in the form of integrals over the source.\nNear a compact source such as the Sun the solution no longer has Schwarzschild\nform. Using Flanagan's method of obtaining a conformally invariant metric\ntensor we attempt to get a solution of Schwarzschild type. We find, however,\nthat the 1/r terms disappear altogether. We conclude that a solution of\nMannheim type cannot exist for these field equations.\n", "  There is a large variety of bi-layered structures with smectic A type\nordering. Results of this paper contribute to a theory of bi-layered phases.\nThe difference between the \\( SmC^{*}_{A} \\) and \\( SmC_{\\alpha}^{*} \\) phases\nis described in this latter paper and it is explained by existence and\nnon-existence of the dipole moment pairs.\n", "  Engineering the synthetic nanopores through lipid bilayer membrane to access\nthe interior of a cell is a long persisting challenge in biotechnology. Here,\nwe demonstrate the stability and dynamics of a tile-based 6-helix DNA nanotube\n(DNT) embedded in POPC lipid bilayer using the analysis of 0.2 microsecond long\nequilibrium MD simulation trajectories. We observe that the head groups of the\nlipid molecules close to the lumen cooperatively tilt towards the hydrophilic\nsugar-phosphate backbone of DNA and form a toroidal structure around the patch\nof DNT protruding in the membrane. Further, we explore the effect of ionic\nconcentrations to the in-solution structure and stability of the lipid-DNT\ncomplex. Transmembrane ionic current measurements for the constant electric\nfield MD simulation provide the I-V characteristics of the water filled DNT\nlumen in lipid membrane. With increasing salt concentrations, the measured\nvalues of transmembrane ionic conductance of the porous DNT lumen vary from 4.3\nnS to 20.6 nS. Simulations of the DNTs with ssDNA and dsDNA overhangs at the\nmouth of the pore show gating effect with remarkable difference in the\ntransmembrane ionic conductivities for open and close state nanopores.\n", "  Results of top-quark mass measurements in the di-lepton and the all-jets\ntop-antitop decay channels with the ATLAS detector are presented. The\nmeasurements are obtained using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data set used\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 $fb^{-1}$. The top-quark mass\nin the di-lepton channel is measured to be 172.99 $\\pm$ 0.41 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.74\n(syst.) GeV. In the all-jets analysis, the top-quark mass is measured to be\n173.72 $\\pm$ 0.55 (stat.) $\\pm$ 1.01 (syst.) GeV. In addition, the top-quark\npole mass is determined from inclusive cross-section measurements in the\ntop-antitop di-lepton decay channel with the ATLAS detector. The measurements\nare obtained using data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 $fb^{-1}$ and 20.2 $fb^{-1}$\nrespectively. The top-quark pole mass is measured to be $172.9^{+2.5}_{-2.6}$\nGeV.\n", "  Ionic Liquids (ILs) are organic molten salts characterized by the total\nabsence of solvent. They show remarkable properties: low vapor pressure, high\nionic conductivity, high chemical, thermal and electrochemical stability. These\nelectrolytes meet therefore key criteria for the development of safe energy\nstorage systems. Due to a competition between electrostatic and van der Walls\ninteractions, ILs show an uncommon property for neat bulk liquids: they\nself-organize in transient nanometric domains. In ILs-based electrochemical\ndevices, this fluctuating nano-segregation acts as energy barriers to the long\nrange diffusional processes and hence to the ionic conductivity. Here, we show\nhow the ionic conductivity of ILs can be increased by more than one order of\nmagnitude by exploiting one dimensional (1D) confinement effects in\nmacroscopically oriented carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes. We identify 1D CNT\nmembranes as promising separators for high instant power batteries.\n", "  The biggest challenge for the commercialization of layered structured nickel\nrich lithium transition metal oxide cathode is the capacity and voltage fading.\nResolving this problem over the years follows an incremental progress. In this\nwork, we report our finding of totally a new approach to revolutionize the\ncycle stability of aggregated cathode particles for lithium ion battery at both\nroom and elevated temperatures. We discover that infusion of a solid\nelectrolyte into the grain boundaries of the cathode secondary particles can\ndramatically enhance the capacity retention and voltage stability of the\nbattery. We find that the solid electrolyte infused in the boundaries not only\nacts as a fast channel for Li ion transport, but also most importantly prevents\npenetration of the liquid electrolyte into the boundaries, consequently\neliminating the detrimental factors that include solid-liquid interfacial\nreaction, intergranular cracking, and layer to spinel phase transformation. The\npresent work, for the first time, reveals unprecedented insight as how the\ncathode behaves in the case of not contacting with the liquid electrolyte,\nultimately points toward a general new route, via grain boundary engineering,\nfor designing of better batteries of both solid-liquid and solid state systems.\n", "  We present results for Wilson loops smoothed with the Yang-Mills gradient\nflow and matched through the scale $t_0$. They provide renormalized and precise\noperators allowing to test the $1/N^2$ scaling both at finite lattice spacing\nand in the continuum limit. Our results show an excellent scaling up to $1/N =\n1/3$. Additionally, we obtain a very precise non-perturbative confirmation of\nfactorization in the large $N$ limit.\n", "  Finding the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of binary compact star merger,\nespecially the binary neutron star (BNS) merger, is critically important for\ngravitational wave (GW) astronomy, cosmology and fundamental physics. On Aug.\n17, 2017, Advanced LIGO and \\textit{Fermi}/GBM independently triggered the\nfirst BNS merger, GW170817, and its high energy EM counterpart, GRB 170817A,\nrespectively, resulting in a global observation campaign covering gamma-ray,\nX-ray, UV, optical, IR, radio as well as neutrinos. The High Energy X-ray\ntelescope (HE) onboard \\textit{Insight}-HXMT (Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope)\nis the unique high-energy gamma-ray telescope that monitored the entire GW\nlocalization area and especially the optical counterpart (SSS17a/AT2017gfo)\nwith very large collection area ($\\sim$1000 cm$^2$) and microsecond time\nresolution in 0.2-5 MeV. In addition, \\textit{Insight}-HXMT quickly implemented\na Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation to scan the GW localization area for\npotential X-ray emission from the GW source. Although it did not detect any\nsignificant high energy (0.2-5 MeV) radiation from GW170817, its observation\nhelped to confirm the unexpected weak and soft nature of GRB 170817A.\nMeanwhile, \\textit{Insight}-HXMT/HE provides one of the most stringent\nconstraints (~10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-6}$ erg/cm$^2$/s) for both GRB170817A and any\nother possible precursor or extended emissions in 0.2-5 MeV, which help us to\nbetter understand the properties of EM radiation from this BNS merger.\nTherefore the observation of \\textit{Insight}-HXMT constitutes an important\nchapter in the full context of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observation\nof this historical GW event.\n", "  In this paper, we study the solar selective absorbing properties of metal\nnanowire array (NWA) / anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) composites at 1000 K via\nnumerical simulation. The materials and structural parameters which influence\nthe wavelength absorption between 0.28 and 10 microns are simulated and\noptimized. The results reveal that W NWA / AAO composites with nanowire length\nof 7.3 microns, fill factor of 0.03, and AAO template thickness of 0.1 microns\nexhibits the best selective absorption. This composite has 0.90 solar\nabsorptivity and 0.045 thermal emissivity in 1000 K, and shows a photothermal\nconversion efficiency of 71.5 %.\n", "  We outline polarization fringe predictions derived from a new application of\nthe Berreman calculus for the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) retarder\noptics. The DKIST retarder baseline design used 6 crystals, single-layer\nanti-reflection coatings, thick cover windows and oil between all optical\ninterfaces. This new tool estimates polarization fringes and optic Mueller\nmatrices as functions of all optical design choices. The amplitude and period\nof polarized fringes under design changes, manufacturing errors, tolerances and\nseveral physical factors can now be estimated. This tool compares well with\nobservations of fringes for data collected with the SPINOR spectropolarimeter\nat the Dunn Solar Telescope using bi-crystalline achromatic retarders as well\nas laboratory tests. With this new tool, we show impacts of design decisions on\npolarization fringes as impacted by anti-reflection coatings, oil refractive\nindices, cover window presence and part thicknesses. This tool helped DKIST\ndecide to remove retarder cover windows and also recommends reconsideration of\ncoating strategies for DKIST. We anticipate this tool to be essential in\ndesigning future retarders for mitigation of polarization and intensity fringe\nerrors in other high spectral resolution astronomical systems.\n", "  We study a self-dual generalization of the Baxter-Wu model, employing results\nobtained by transfer matrix calculations of the magnetic scaling dimension and\nthe free energy. While the pure critical Baxter-Wu model displays the critical\nbehavior of the four-state Potts fixed point in two dimensions, in the sense\nthat logarithmic corrections are absent, the introduction of different\ncouplings in the up- and down triangles moves the model away from this fixed\npoint, so that logarithmic corrections appear. Real couplings move the model\ninto the first-order range, away from the behavior displayed by the\nnearest-neighbor, four-state Potts model. We also use complex couplings, which\nbring the model in the opposite direction characterized by the same type of\nlogarithmic corrections as present in the four-state Potts model. Our\nfinite-size analysis confirms in detail the existing renormalization theory\ndescribing the immediate vicinity of the four-state Potts fixed point.\n", "  We propose a novel measurement technique that exploits the high coherent\ncontrollability of multi-comb systems, which corresponds to a generalization of\nthe frequency control between the comb sources. In this paper, we particularly\nfocus on the arbitrary relative carrier envelope phase (CEP) control through\nthe relative offset frequency of two combs. We successfully demonstrate\npolarization-modulated comb generation and its coherent detection in the\ndeveloped system. The proof-of-principle experiment indicates the potential of\nmulti-comb systems, enabling a rapid, precise, and arbitrary coherent\nmodulation method utilized for a wide variety of metrological applications.\n", "  Due to competing long range ferromagnetic order, the transition metals Fe, Co\nand Ni are not superconductors at ambient pressure. While superconductivity was\nobserved in a non-magnetic phase of Fe, stabilized under pressure, it is yet to\nbe discovered in Co and Ni under any experimental conditions. Here, we report\nemergence of superconductivity in the recently discovered high-density\nnonmagnetic face centered cubic phase in Co thin films below a transition\ntemperature (Tc) of ~5.4 K, as revealed in experiments based on point-contact\nspectroscopy and resistance, and four-probe measurements of resistance at\nambient pressure. We confirm the non-magnetic nature of the dense fcc phase of\nCo within first-principles density functional theory, and show that its\nsuperconductivity below 5 K originates from anomalous softening of\nzone-boundary phonons and their enhanced coupling with electrons upon biaxial\nstrain.\n", "  With rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we show in this paper that exciton\ntransmission in a one-dimensional two-level molecule chain embedded in a cavity\ncan be enhanced or suppressed by strong cavity-chain couplings. This exciton\ntransmission is closely related to the number of molecules and the distribution\nof molecular exciton energy. In addition, we propose a proposal to enhance the\nexciton transmission by quantum-jump-based feedback. These results may find\napplications in experiments of exciton transmission in organic materials.\n", "  Time evolution of initially prepared entangled state in the system of coupled\nquantum dots has been analyzed by means of two different theoretical\napproaches: equations of motion for the all orders localized electron\ncorrelation functions, considering interference effects, and kinetic equations\nfor the pseudo-particle occupation numbers with constraint on the possible\nphysical states. Results obtained by means of different approaches were\ncarefully analyzed and compared with each other. Revealed direct link between\nconcurrence (degree of entanglement) and quantum dots pair correlation\nfunctions allowed us to follow the changes of entanglement during time\nevolution of the coupled quantum dots system. It was demonstrated that the\ndegree of entanglement can be controllably tuned during the time evolution of\nquantum dots system.\n", "  Assembly of quantum nanophotonic systems with plasmonic resonators are\nimportant for fundamental studies of single photon sources as well as for\non-chip information processing. In this work, we demonstrate controllable\nnanoassembly of gold nanospheres with ultra-bright quantum emitters in 2D\nlayered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We utilize an atomic force microscope\n(AFM) tip to precisely position gold nanospheres to close proximity of the\nquantum emitters and observe the resulting emission enhancement and\nfluorescence lifetime reduction. A fluorescence enhancement of over 300% is\nachieved experimentally for quantum emitters in hBN, with a radiative quantum\nefficiency of up to 40% and a saturated count rate in excess of 5 million\ncounts/s. Our results are promising for future employment of quantum emitters\nin hBN for integrated nanophotonic devices and plasmonic based nanosensors.\n", "  We propose a scheme for preparation of large-scale entangled $W$ states based\non the fusion mechanism via quantum Zeno dynamics. By sending two atoms\nbelonging to an $n$-atom $W$ state and an $m$-atom $W$ state, respectively,\ninto a vacuum cavity (or two separate cavities), we may obtain a ($n+m-2$)-atom\n$W$ state via detecting the two-atom state after interaction. The present\nscheme is robust against both spontaneous emission of atoms and decay of\ncavity, and the feasibility analysis indicates that it can also be realized in\nexperiment.\n", "  We argue that the requirement of a finite entanglement entropy of quantum\ndegrees of freedom across a boundary surface is closely related to the\nphenomenon of running spectral dimension, universal in approaches to quantum\ngravity. If quantum geometry hinders diffusion, for instance when its structure\nat some given scale is discrete or too rough, then the spectral dimension of\nspacetime vanishes at that scale and the entropy density blows up. A finite\nentanglement entropy is a key ingredient in deriving Einstein gravity in a\nsemi-classical regime of a quantum-gravitational theory and, thus, our\narguments strengthen the role of running dimensionality as an imprint of\nquantum geometry with potentially observable consequences.\n", "  Here we show scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), non-contact atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) and inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS)\nmeasurements on organic molecule with a CO- terminated tip at 5K. The\nhigh-resolution contrast observed simultaneously in all channels unam-\nbiguously demonstrates the common imaging mechanism in STM/AFM/IETS, related to\nthe lateral bending of the CO-functionalized tip. The IETS spectroscopy reveals\nthat the submolecular con- trast at 5K consists of both renormalization of\nvibrational frequency and variation of the amplitude of IETS signal. This\nfinding is also corroborated by first principles simulations. We extend accord-\ningly the probe-particle AFM/STM/IETS model to include these two main\ningredients necessary to reproduce the high-resolution IETS contrast. We also\nemploy the first principles simulations to get more insight into different\nresponse of frustrated translation and rotational modes of CO-tip during\nimaging.\n", "  We report the discovery of one of the largest and most distant Giant Radio\nGalaxy (GRG) in the Lynx field which was discovered using deep Giant Metre-wave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) 150 MHz observations. The core is detected at 150 MHz\nand also in the VLA FIRST survey. Spectroscopic observations carried out using\nthe IUCAA Giravali Observatory(IGO) provided a redshift value of 0.57. This\nredshift was later confirmed with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data\nRelease 12). The angular size of the GRG is 5.5 arcmin and at the redshift of\n0.57, its linear size is 2.2 Mpc. At this high redshift, only a few radio\nsources are known to have such large linear size. In order to estimate the\nspectral index of the bridge emission as well as the spectral age of the\nsource, we observed this source at L-band, 610 MHz and 325 MHz bands with the\nGMRT. We present the spectral ageing analysis of the source which puts an upper\nlimit of 20 Myr on the spectral age. The better resolution maps presented here\nas opposed to the original 150 MHz map shows evidence for a second episode of\nemission. We also find that the core is detected at all four frequencies with a\nspectral index of 0.85, which is steeper than normal, hence we speculate that\nthe core may be a compact steep spectrum source (CSS), which makes this giant\nradio galaxy a candidate triple-double radio galaxy.\n", "  The coupled evolution of the magnetic field and the flow at the Earth's core\nmantle boundary is modeled within the 1900.0-2014.0 time period. To constraint\nthe dynamical behavior of the system with a core field model deriving from\ndirect measurements of the Earth's magnetic field we used an Ensemble Kalman\nfilter algorithm. By simulating an ensemble of possible states, access to the\ncomplete statistical properties of the considered fields is available.\nFurthermore, the method enables to provide predictions and to assess their\nreliability. In this study, we could highlight the cohabitation of two distinct\nflow regimes. One associated with the large scale part of the eccentric gyre,\nwhich evolves slowly in time and posses a very long memory of its past, and a\nfaster one associated with the small scale velocity field. We show that the\nlatter can exhibit rapid variations in localized areas. The combination of the\ntwo regimes can predict quite well the decadal variations in length of day, but\nit can also explain the discrepancies between the physically predicted and the\nobserved trend in these variations. Hindcast tests demonstrate that the model\nis well balanced and that it can provide accurate short term predictions of a\nmean state and its associated uncertainties. However, magnetic field\npredictions are limited by the high randomization rate of the different\nvelocity field scales, and after approximately 2000 years of forecast, no\nreliable information on the core field can be recovered.\n", "  We propose efficient schemes for converting three-photon, four-photon and\nfive-photon GHZ state to a $W$ state or Dicke state, respectively with the\nnitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers via single-photon input-output process and\ncross-Kerr nonlinearities. The total success probability can be improved by\niterating the conversion process for the case of three-photon and five-photon\nwhile it does not require iteration for converting four-photon GHZ state to a\n$W$ state. The analysis of feasibility shows that our scheme is feasible for\ncurrent experimental technology.\n", "  The thesis contains studies of properties quark-gluon plasma, using some\nnon-perturbative techniques. It contains a brief introduction of quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP) and discussion on various signatures along with a motivation for\nthis thesis work. It presents the basic mathematical tools and ingredients\nrequired for the thesis, i.e. basics of QCD, Imaginary and Real Time Formalism,\nHard Thermal Loop perturbation theory (HTLpt), Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) action,\nthe Correlation Function along with the Spectral Function and Operator Product\nExpansion (OPE) and QCD in magnetized medium. OPE is used to compute the\ndilepton rate in intermediate mass range by incorporating the non-perturbative\ndynamics of QCD through the inclusion of non-vanishing quark and gluon\ncondensates in combination with the Green functions in momentum space. Also the\nmagnetic scale (g^2T) in the HTL perturbation theory, related to the confining\nproperties of the QCD is taken into account using the GZ action through a mass\nparameter, which reflects a new space-like quark mode in the collective\nexcitation. The impact of this new exciting mode on the DPR has been studied\nand its important consequences has been discussed. A hot magnetized medium\nintroduces another scale in the system in addition to temperature.\nElectromagnetic spectral properties and DPR are studied completely analytically\nin presence of both strong and weak background magnetic fields at finite\ntemperature. The Debye screening in a hot and magnetized medium has been\nstudied which reveals some of the intriguing properties of the medium in\npresence of both strong and weak magnetic field. Also an important quantity\nthat characterizes the QGP, namely quark number susceptibility has been\ninvestigated. Most of the non-perturbative results discussed in this thesis are\ncompared with those of perturbative ones and lattice QCD.\n", "  Terahertz field induced photocurrents in graphene were studied experimentally\nand by microscopic modeling. Currents were generated by cw and pulsed laser\nradiation in large area as well as small-size exfoliated graphene samples. We\nreview general symmetry considerations leading to photocurrents depending on\nlinear and circular polarized radiation and then present a number of situations\nwhere photocurrents were detected. Starting with the photon drag effect under\noblique incidence, we proceed to the photogalvanic effect enhancement in the\nreststrahlen band of SiC and edge-generated currents in graphene. Ratchet\neffects were considered for in-plane magnetic fields and a structure inversion\nasymmetry as well as ratchets by non-symmetric patterned top gates. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that graphene can be used as a fast, broadband detector of\nterahertz radiation.\n", "  Microemulsion (water-in-oil) methods enable the encapsulation of individual\nnanoparticles into SiO2 spheres. The major drawbacks of this method, when\napplied for silica encapsulation of anisotropic nanorods (NRs), are a spatially\nunequal silica growth and long reaction times (24 h at least). In this work,\nvarious tetra-alkoxysilanes (tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), tetraethyl\northosilicate (TEOS) and tetrapropyl orthosilicate (TPOS)) with different\nalkyl-chain lengths were used as the silica precursors in attempt to tune the\nsilanization behavior of CdSe/CdS NRs in a microemulsion system. We find an\nenhanced spatial homogeneity of the silica growth with decreasing alkyl-chain\nlength of the tetra-alkoxysilanes. In particular, by using TMOS as the\nprecursor, NRs can be fully encapsulated in a continuous thin ($\\le$ 5 nm)\nsilica shell within only 1 h reaction time. Surprisingly, the thin silica shell\nshowed a superior shielding ability to acidic environment even compared to the\n30 nm thick shell prepared by using TEOS. Our investigations suggest that the\nlower steric hindrance of TMOS compared to TEOS or TPOS strongly promotes the\nhomogeneous growth of the silica shells while its increased hydrolysis rate\nleads decreases the porosity of these shells.\n", "  Recently, several efforts have been made to identify the seismic signatures\nof flares and magnetic activity in the Sun and Sun-like stars. In this work, we\nhave analyzed the disk-integrated velocity and intensity observations of the\nSun obtained from the GOLF and VIRGO/SPM instruments, respectively, on board\nthe SOHO space mission covering several successive flare events, for the period\nfrom 11 February 2011 to 17 February 2011, of which 11 February 2011 remained a\nrelatively quiet day and served as a \"null test\" for the investigation.\nApplication of the spectral analysis to these disk-integrated Sun-as-a-star\nvelocity and intensity signals indicates that there is enhanced power of the\nglobal modes of oscillations in the Sun during the flares, as compared to the\nquiet day. The GOLF instrument obtains velocity observations using the Na I D\nlines which are formed in the upper solar photosphere, while the intensity data\nused in our analysis are obtained by VIRGO/SPM instrument at 862~nm, which is\nformed within the solar photosphere. Despite the fact that the two instruments\nsample different layers of the solar atmosphere using two different parameters\n(velocity v/s intensity), we have found that both these observations show the\nsignatures of flare-induced global waves in the Sun. These results could\nsuffice in identifying the asteroseismic signatures of stellar flares and\nmagnetic activity in the Sun-like stars.\n", "  In this work, we present HOC simulation of vortices in the triangular cavity\nfor slow viscous incompressible flows by using a recently proposed new paradigm\napproach for solving Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. These vortices qualify as\nMoffatt vortices which are characterized by the computation of common ratios of\ntheir sizes and intensities. We further explore topological structures of\nMoffatt eddies by using crtical point theory which is one of the key concept in\nthe field of topological fluid dynamics.\n", "  In this talk we present a short overview of top physics at the\nelectron-proton (ep) colliders. Currently, the proposed ep collider is the\nLarge Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), which is a combination of 60 GeV\nelectron beam and 7 TeV proton beam of the LHC tunnel. This may be extended to\nFuture Circular electron-hadron Collider (FCC-eh), which features a 60 GeV (or\nhigher) electron beam with the 50 TeV proton beam from the Future Circular\nhadron Collider (FCC-hh). Selected topics include but not limited to top\nstructure function, top parton distribution functions, top spin polarization,\ntop electric charge, measurement of $\\rm V_{tb}$, anomalous $\\rm tt\\gamma$,\nttZ, tbW, $\\rm tq\\gamma$, tqH couplings and CP phase of ttH coupling.\n", "  We summarize a recent work on the title subject, skipping the detailed\ncalculations but introducing the basic points with enough detail. The theory\nconsidered is formulated in a preferred reference frame in a four-dimensional\nspacetime endowed with a curved \"physical\" metric. The dynamics of a test\nparticle is defined by an extension of the special-relativistic form of\nNewton's second law. This determines the dynamical equation verified by the\nenergy-momentum tensor ${\\bf T}$ of a \"dust\" continuum, also in the presence of\na non-gravitational external force. The dynamical equation for ${\\bf T}$ thus\nobtained is assumed valid for a general continuous medium or a system of\nfields. When the non-gravitational force is the Lorentz force, this equation in\nturn determines the Maxwell equations in a gravitational field for the present\ntheory. They are consistent with the dynamics of photons i.e. with the\ngeometrical optics of the theory. Except for a constant gravitational field,\nthey seem to imply some local production or destruction of electric charge. The\npossible amounts are yet to be assessed.\n", "  The chemical stability of the powder DyBa2Cu3O6+{\\delta} has been studied by\nX-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermal\nanalysis at ambient conditions. The powder was subjected to mechanical\nprocessing in a ball mill-activator to accelerate chemical degradation. The\nkinetic regularities of hydrolytic decomposition of DyBa2Cu3O6+{\\delta} under\nthe influence of air moisture have been determined. The resistive properties of\nDyBa2Cu3O6+{\\delta} to water have been found to be better, but not much\ndifferent from analogous properties of YBa2Cu3O6+{\\delta} which is unstable in\na wet environment. Chemical degradation of the material is triggered by crucial\nconcentrating of water particles near the free surface of the solid reactant\n(due to their low diffusibility in the bulk) leading to rapid chemical\ndecomposition of the respective regions.\n", "  The Georgi-Machacek model is one of many beyond Standard Model scenarios with\nan extended scalar sector which can group under the custodial $\\rm SU(2)_C$\nsymmetry. There are 5-plet, 3-plet and singlet Higgs bosons under the\nclassification of such symmetry in addition to the Standard Model Higgs boson.\nHere we study the prospects for detecting the doubly-charged Higgs boson ($\\rm\nH_5^{\\pm\\pm}$) through the vector boson fusion production at the\nelectron-proton colliders. Typically, we concentrate on our analysis through\n$\\mu$-lepton pair production via pair of same-sign W bosons decay. The\ndiscovery significance are calculated as the functions of the triplet vacuum\nexpectation value and necessary luminosity.\n", "  We compute the exact path integral of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge\ntheories with general gauge group on $\\mathbb{RP}^4$ and a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-quotient of the hemi-$S^4$. By specializing to $SU(2)$\nsuperconformal quivers, we show that these, together with hemi-$S^4$ partition\nfunctions, compute Liouville correlators on unoriented/open Riemann surfaces.\nWe perform explicit checks for Riemann surfaces obtained as $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nquotients of the sphere and the torus. We also discuss the coupled $3d\\!-\\!4d$\nsystems associated to Liouville amplitudes with boundary punctures.\n", "  In the recent years, major milestones in neutrino physics were accomplished\nat nuclear reactors: the smallest neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ was\ndetermined with high precision and the emitted antineutrino spectrum was\nmeasured at unprecedented resolution. However, two anomalies, the first one\nrelated to the absolute flux and the second one to the spectral shape, have yet\nto be solved. The flux anomaly is known as the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly and\ncould be caused by the existence of a light sterile neutrino participating in\nthe neutrino oscillation phenomenon. Introducing a sterile state implies the\npresence of a fourth mass eigenstate, global fits favour oscillation parameters\naround $\\sin^2({2\\theta}) \\approx 0.09$ and $\\Delta m^2 \\approx\n1\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$. The Stereo experiment was built to finally solve this\npuzzle. It is one of the first running experiments built to search for eV\nsterile neutrinos and takes data since end of 2016 at ILL Grenoble (France). At\na short baseline of 10 metres, it measures the antineutrino flux and spectrum\nemitted by a compact research reactor. The segmentation of the detector in six\ntarget cells allows for measurements of the neutrino spectrum at multiple\nbaselines. An active-sterile flavour oscillation could be unambiguously\ndetected, as it distorts the spectral shape of each cell's measurement\ndifferently. This contribution gives an overview on the Stereo experiment,\nalong with details on the detector design, detection principle and the current\nstatus of data analysis.\n", "  We study a system in which a quark-antiquark antenna emits a hard gluon in a\nmedium, and an extra very soft emission afterwards. Considering the coherence\neffects in terms of the survival probability, we can describe the interaction\nof the $q\\bar{q}g$ configuration with the medium. We extrapolate previous\nanalyzes of the antenna radiation to the case of two hard splittings inside the\nmedium, and prove that this generalization keeps back the picture of jet\nquenching with effective emitters in the parton QCD cascade.\n", "  Several anomalies are discussed in neutrino physics, linked to the possible\nexistence of light sterile neutrinos. These sterile neutrinos would not\ninteract weakly, but they could leave an imprint in various measurements, such\nas neutrino oscillation experiments or precise measurements of beta decay\nspectra. Global analyses of neutrino oscillation data suggest sterile neutrinos\nwith a mass in the eV range, but reveal at the same time tensions with the\nobserved neutrino anomalies. In the next years several experiments will test\nthe sterile neutrino hypothesis with masses in the eV range with promising\nsensitivities.\n", "  Boron nitride structures have excellent thermal and chemical stabilities.\nBased on state-of-art theoretical calculations, we propose a wide gap\nsemiconducting BN crystal with a three-dimensional hyperhoneycomb structure\n(Hp-BN), which is both mechanically and thermodynamically stable. Our\ncalculated results show that Hp-BN has a higher bulk modulus and a smaller\nenergy gap as compared to c-BN. Moreover, due to the unique bonding structure,\nHp-BN exhibits anisotropic electronic and optical properties. It has great\nadsorption in the ultraviolet region, but it is highly transparent in the\nvisible and infrared region, suggesting that the Hp-BN crystal could have\npotential applications in electronic and optical devices.\n", "  Recently, Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 86, 012113(2012)] explored the behavior of\nthe entropic uncertainty relation under the influence of local unital and\nnonunital noisy channels for a class of Bell-diagonal states. We here reform\ntheir results and investigate the entropic uncertainty relation under the\ninfluence of unital and nonunital noisy channels with memory. Different types\nof noisy channels with memory, such as amplitude damping channel(nonunitary),\nphase-damping and depolarizing channels(unitary) have been taken into account.\nSome analytical or numerical results are presented. The effect of channels with\nmemory on dynamics of the entropic uncertainties (or their lower bounds) has\nbeen discussed in detail. Compare with previous results, our results show that,\nthe entropic uncertainties (or their lower bounds) subjecting to amplitude\ndamping channel with memory will be reduced at first and then be lifted with\nthe memory coefficient of channel $\\mu$ increasing, however they will be only\nreduced under phase-damping and depolarizing channels with memory. Especially,\nin the limit of $\\mu\\rightarrow1$, the entropic uncertainties (or their lower\nbounds) could be well protected and immune to decoherence of channle. Moreover,\nthe mechanism behind these phenomena are also explored by using the purity of\nstate.\n", "  The classic Sierpinski triangle comprised of conducting bonds is\nmultifractal. Thus the critical exponents and dimensions related to the\nconductivity are obtained asymptotically--that is, in the limit that the\ncorrelation length {\\xi} of the recursive triangle goes to infinity.\n", "  We describe the steps necessary to create three-dimensional (3D) movies of\nNorthern Lights or Aurorae Borealis out of real-time images taken with two\ndistant high-resolution fish-eye cameras. Astrometric reconstruction of the\nvisible stars is used to model the optical mapping of each camera and correct\nfor it in order to properly align the two sets of images. Examples of the\nresulting movies can be seen at http://www.iap.fr/aurora3d.\n", "  A 100 TeV pp collider is under consideration, by the high-energy physics\ncommunity, as an important step for the future development of our field,\nfollowing the completion of the LHC and High-luminosity LHC physics programmes.\nIn particular, CERN is considering 100 TeV pp collisions as the key target of a\nFuture Circular Collider facility, built around a 100 km tunnel and designed to\ndeliver pp, e+e- and ep collisions, in addition to a programme with heavy ion\nbeams and with the injector complex. CERN is coordinating an international\nstudy tasked with the completion, by the end of 2018, of a Conceptual Design\nReport (CDR) for this facility. This document presents the first results of the\nassessment of the physics potential of the hadronic part of this research\nprogramme (FCC-hh).\n", "  In the following we present our recent results on the resummation of soft\ngluon corrections to the $pp\\rightarrow t\\bar{t}H$ cross section at the LHC.\nThe resummation was carried out at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL)\naccuracy using the Mellin space technique. Obtained results were matched to the\nNLO cross section. We show that the resummation leads to reduction of\nscale-variation uncertainty of the total $pp\\rightarrow t\\bar{t}H$ cross\nsection.\n", "  We review star formation in molecular clouds and describe why magnetic fields\nmay be important and how they can influence filamentary structure and the\ncolumn density probability distribution function (PDF). We also comment on the\norigin of the stellar and substellar initial mass function (IMF), which may\nrequire explanations beyond a simple Jeans length argument in turbulent\nmolecular clouds. A mathematical model of the modified lognormal power-law\n(MLP) distribution function provides a framework within which to connect\naccretion processes with the IMF.\n", "  In this work, we have estimated self diffusion coefficients along with the\nbinary diffusion coefficients of mixtures of alkane (methane, ethane, propane\nand n-butane) in SPC/E water(H$_2$O). Molecular dynamics study of a binary\nmixture of alkane gas and SPC/E water, with alkane as solute and water as\nsolvent, have been carried out at different temperatures ranging from 283.15 K\nto 333.15 K. We have taken a dilute solution of 3 alkane (methane, ethane,\npropane and n-butane) molecules and 971 water molecules in a system. The role\nof interaction in the structure of the constituents of the system as a function\nof temperature is studied with the help of the radial distribution function\n(RDF) and the coordination numbers. The self-diffusion coefficient of the\nconstituents of the mixture was calculated by using mean square displacement\n(MSD) and the binary diffusion coefficients of alkane in water have been\ncalculated by using Darken's relation. The results are then compared with the\navailable experimental values. The values of self-diffusion coefficients of\nwater from the present work come in good agreement with the experimental values\nwithin 9% error. The binary diffusion coefficients of ethane, methane, propane\nand n-butane agree with the previously reported experimental values. The\ndependence of the diffusion coefficients on temperature is approximated by\nArrhenius-type exponential relationship.\n", "  We present an X-ray Compton scattering study on aqueous Trimethylamine\nN-oxide (TMAO) and guanidine hydrochloride solutions (GdnHCl) as a function of\ntemperature. Independent from the concentration of the solvent, Compton\nprofiles almost resemble results for liquid water as a function of temperature.\nHowever, The number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule extracted from the\nCompton profiles suggests a decrease of hydrogen bonds with rising temperatures\nfor all studied samples, the differences between water and the solutions are\nweak. Nevertheless, the data indicate a reduced bond weakening with rising TMAO\nconcentration up to 5M of 7.2% compared to 8 % for pure water. In contrast, the\naddition of GdnHCl appears to behave differently for concentrations up to 3.1 M\nwith a weaker impact on the temperature response of the hydrogen bond\nstructure.\n", "  In 1835 Lobachevski entertained the possibility of multiple (rival)\ngeometries. This idea has reappeared on occasion (e.g., Poincar\\'{e}) but\ndidn't become key in space-time foundations prior to Brown's \\emph{Physical\nRelativity} (at the end, the interpretive key to the book). A crucial\ndifference between his constructivism and orthodox \"space-time realism\" is\nmodal scope. Constructivism applies to all local classical field theories,\nincluding those with multiple geometries. But the orthodox view provincially\nassumes a unique geometry, as familiar theories (Newton, Special Relativity,\nNordstr\\\"{o}m, and GR) have. They serve as the orthodox \"canon.\" Their\nhistorical roles suggest a story of inevitable progress. Physics literature\nafter c. 1920 is relevant to orthodoxy mostly as commentary on the canon, which\nclosed in the 1910s. The orthodox view explains the behavior of matter as the\nmanifestation of the real space-time geometry, which works within the canon.\nThe orthodox view, Whiggish history, and the canon relate symbiotically.\n  If one considers a theory outside the canon, space-time realism sheds little\nlight on matter's behavior. Worse, it gives the wrong answer when applied to an\nexample arguably in the canon, massive scalar gravity with universal coupling.\nWhich is the true geometry---the flat metric from the Poincar\\'{e} symmetry,\nthe conformally flat metric exhibited by material rods and clocks, or both---or\nis the question bad? How does space-time realism explain that all matter fields\nsee the same curved geometry, given so many ways to mix and match?\nConstructivist attention to dynamical details is vindicated; geometrical\nshortcuts disappoint. The more exhaustive exploration of relativistic field\ntheories (especially massive) in particle physics is an underused resource for\nfoundations.\n", "  For an arbitrary symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category $V$, we define the\nfactorization homology of $V$-enriched $\\infty$-categories over (possibly\nstratified) 1-manifolds and study its basic properties. In the case that $V$ is\n\\textit{cartesian} symmetric monoidal, by considering the circle and its\nself-covering maps we obtain a notion of \\textit{unstable topological cyclic\nhomology}, which we endow with an \\textit{unstable cyclotomic trace map}. As we\nshow in \\cite{AMR-trace}, these induce their stable counterparts through\nlinearization (in the sense of Goodwillie calculus).\n", "  The apparent dependence of detection frequency of extrasolar planets on the\nmetallicity of their host stars is investigated with Monte Carlo simulations\nusing a deterministic core-accretion planet formation model. According to this\nmodel, gas giants formed and acquired their mass $M_{\\rm p}$ through\nplanetesimal coagulation followed by the emergence of cores onto which gas is\naccreted. These protoplanets migrate and attain their asymptotic semi-major\naxis $a$ through their tidal interaction with their nascent disk. Based on the\nobserved properties of protostellar disks, we generate $M_{\\rm p}$-$a$\ndistribution. Our results reproduce the observed lack of planets with\nintermediate mass $M_{\\rm p} = 10$--100$M_{\\oplus}$ and $a \\la 3$AU and with\nlarge mass $M_{\\rm p} \\ga 10^3 M_{\\oplus}$ and $a \\la 0.2$AU. Based on the\nsimulated $M_{\\rm p}$-$a$ distributions, we also evaluate the metallicity\ndependence of fraction of stars harboring planets that are detectable with\ncurrent radial velocity survey. If protostellar disks attain the same fraction\nof heavy elements which are contained in their host stars, the detection\nprobability around metal-rich stars would be greatly enhanced because\nprotoplanetary cores formed in them can grow to several Earth masses prior to\ntheir depletion. These large masses are required for the cores to initiate\nrapid gas accretion and to transform into giant planets. The theoretically\nextrapolated metallicity dependence is consistent with the observation. This\ncorrelation does not arise naturally in the gravitational-instability scenario.\nWe also suggest other metallicity dependence of the planet distributions that\ncan be tested by on-going observations.\n", "  We present multiple Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the type 1.8\nSeyfert Galaxy NGC 1365, which shows the most dramatic X-ray spectral changes\nobserved so far in an AGN: the source switched from reflection dominated to\ntransmission dominated and back in just 6 weeks. During this time the soft\nthermal component, arising from a ~1 kpc region around the center, remained\nconstant. The reflection component is constant at all timescales, and its high\nflux relative to the primary component implies the presence of thick gas\ncovering a large fraction of the solid angle. The presence of this gas, and the\nfast variability time scale, suggest that the Compton-thick to Compton thin\nchange is due to variation in the line-of-sight absorber, rather than to\nextreme intrinsic emission variability. We discuss a structure of the\ncircumnuclear absorber/reflector which can explain the observed X-ray spectral\nand temporal properties.\n"]}
