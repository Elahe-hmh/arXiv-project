This is achieved \\textit{via} a method initiated\nby Painleve' with the application of a test due to Kowalevski and Gambier. The\nsolutions can be obtained explicitly in terms of Painleve' transcendents or\nelliptic functions.\n", "  In order to later find explicit analytic solutions, we investigate the\nsingularity structure of a fundamental model of nonlinear optics, the four-wave\nmixing model in one space variable z. This structure is quite similar, and this\nis not a surprise, to that of the cubic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. The\nmain result is that, in order to be single valued, time-dependent solutions\nshould depend on the space-time coordinates through the reduced variable\nxi=\\sqrt{z} exp(-t / tau), in which tau is the relaxation time.\n", "  Under pressure, metals exhibit increasingly shorter interatomic distances.\nIntuitively, this response is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the\nwidths of the valence and conduction bands and hence a more pronounced\nfree-electron-like behaviour. But at the densities that can now be achieved\nexperimentally, compression can be so substantial that core electrons overlap.\nThis effect dramatically alters electronic properties from those typically\nassociated with simple free-electron metals such as lithium and sodium, leading\nin turn to structurally complex phases and superconductivity with a high\ncritical temperature. But the most intriguing prediction - that the seemingly\nsimple metals Li and Na will transform under pressure into insulating states,\nowing to pairing of alkali atoms - has yet to be experimentally confirmed. Here\nwe report experimental observations of a pressure-induced transformation of Na\ninto an optically transparent phase at 200 GPa (corresponding to 5.0-fold\ncompression). Experimental and computational data identify the new phase as a\nwide bandgap dielectric with a six-coordinated, highly distorted\ndouble-hexagonal close-packed structure. We attribute the emergence of this\ndense insulating state not to atom pairing, but to p-d hybridizations of\nvalence electrons and their repulsion by core electrons into the lattice\ninterstices. We expect that such insulating states may also form in other\nelements and compounds when compression is sufficiently strong that atomic\ncores start to overlap strongly.\n", "  Boron is an element of fascinating chemical complexity. Controversies have\nshrouded this element since its discovery was announced in 1808: the new\n'element' turned out to be a compound containing less than 60-70 percent of\nboron, and it was not until 1909 that 99-percent pure boron was obtained. And\nalthough we now know of at least 16 polymorphs, the stable phase of boron is\nnot yet experimentally established even at ambient conditions. Boron's\ncomplexities arise from frustration: situated between metals and insulators in\nthe periodic table, boron has only three valence electrons, which would favour\nmetallicity, but they are sufficiently localized that insulating states emerge.\nHowever, this subtle balance between metallic and insulating states is easily\nshifted by pressure, temperature and impurities. Here we report the results of\nhigh-pressure experiments and ab initio evolutionary crystal structure\npredictions that explore the structural stability of boron under pressure and,\nstrikingly, reveal a partially ionic high-pressure boron phase. This new phase\nis stable between 19 and 89 GPa, can be quenched to ambient conditions, and has\na hitherto unknown structure (space group Pnnm, 28 atoms in the unit cell)\nconsisting of icosahedral B12 clusters and B2 pairs in a NaCl-type arrangement.\nWe find that the ionicity of the phase affects its electronic bandgap, infrared\nadsorption and dielectric constants, and that it arises from the different\nelectronic properties of the B2 pairs and B12 clusters and the resultant charge\ntransfer between them.\n", "  We show that all meromorphic solutions of the stationary reduction of the\nreal cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation are elliptic or degenerate elliptic. We\nthen obtain them all explicitly by the subequation method, and one of them\nappears to be a new elliptic solution.\n", "  In evolution equations for a complex amplitude, the phase obeys a much more\nintricate equation than the amplitude. Nevertheless, general methods should be\napplicable to both variables. On the example of the traveling wave reduction of\nthe complex cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL5), we explain how to\novercome the difficulties arising in two such methods: (i) the criterium that\nthe sum of residues of an elliptic solution should be zero, (ii) the\nconstruction of a first order differential equation admitting the given\nequation as a differential consequence (subequation method).\n", "  We derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation for the dynamical\nself-diffraction of optical waves in a nonlinear cavity. The case of the\nreflection geometry of wave interaction as well as a medium that possesses the\ncubic nonlinearity (including a local and a nonlocal nonlinear responses) and\nthe relaxation is considered. A stable localized spatial structure in the form\nof a \"dark\" dissipative soliton is formed in the cavity in the steady state.\nThe envelope of the intensity pattern, as well as of the dynamical grating\namplitude, takes the shape of a $\\tanh$ function. The obtained complex\nGinzburg-Landau equation describes the dynamics of this envelope, at the same\ntime the evolution of this spatial structure changes the parameters of the\noutput waves. New effects are predicted in this system due to the\ntransformation of the dissipative soliton which takes place during the\ninteraction of a pulse with a continuous wave, such as: retention of the pulse\nshape during the transmission of impulses in a long nonlinear cavity; giant\namplification of a seed pulse, which takes energy due to redistribution of the\npump continuous energy into the signal.\n", "  We analyse the nature of the confinement of an infinitely long (and finite)\nlinear semiflexible homo-polymer chain confined in between two geometrical\nconstraints (A&B) under good solvent condition in two dimensions. The\nconstraints are stair shaped impenetrable lines. A lattice model of fully\ndirected self avoiding walk is used to list information of walks of the\nconfined chain and the exact enumeration technique is used for the canonical\nensemble of conformations of the confined chain to discuss equilibrium\nstatistics of the chain. We obtain the probability of polymerization of the\nconfined flexible chain segments with either one end (polymer trains) or both\nthe ends of the confined chain lying on the stair shaped constraints (polymer\nbridge and arc). We have also calculated the force of confinement exerted by\nthe constraints on to the chain or the force exerted by the chain on the\ngeometrical constraints using grand canonical ensemble theory and discuss\nnature of variation of the force.\n", "  Liouville Field Theory (LFT for short) is a two dimensional model of random\nsurfaces, which is for instance involved in $2d$ string theory or in the\ndescription of the fluctuations of metrics in $2d$ Liouville quantum gravity.\nThis is a probabilistic model that consists in weighting the classical Free\nField action with an interaction term given by the exponential of a Gaussian\nmultiplicative chaos. The main input of our work is the study of the\nsemiclassical limit of the theory, which is a prescribed asymptotic regime of\nLFT of interest in physics literature (see \\cite{witten} and references\ntherein). We derive exact formulas for the Laplace transform of the Liouville\nfield in the case of flat metric on the unit disk with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. As a consequence, we prove that the Liouville field concentrates on\nthe solution of the classical Liouville equation with explicit negative scalar\ncurvature. We also characterize the leading fluctuations, which are Gaussian\nand massive, and establish a large deviation principle. Though considered as an\nansatz in the whole physics literature, it seems that it is the first rigorous\nprobabilistic derivation of the semiclassical limit of LFT. On the other hand,\nwe carry out the same analysis when we further weight the Liouville action with\nheavy matter operators. This procedure appears when computing the $n$-points\ncorrelation functions of LFT.\n", "  In the recent paper by Hamadeh et al. (2012) an elegant analytic criterion\nfor incremental output feedback passivity (iOFP) of cyclic feedback systems\n(CFS) has been reported, assuming that the constituent subsystems are\nincrementally output strictly passive (iOSP). This criterion was used to prove\nthat a network of identical CFS can be synchronized under sufficiently strong\nlinear diffusive coupling. A very important class of CFS consists of biological\noscillators, named after Brian Goodwin and describing self-regulated chains of\nenzymatic reactions, where the product of each reaction catalyzes the next\nreaction, while the last product inhibits the first reaction in the chain.\nGoodwin's oscillators are used, in particular, to model the dynamics of genetic\ncircadian pacemakers, hormonal cycles and some metabolic pathways. In this\npaper we point out that for Goodwin's oscillators, where the individual\nreactions have nonlinear (e.g. Mikhaelis-Menten) kinetics, the synchronization\ncriterion, obtained by Hamadeh et al., cannot be directly applied. This\ncriterion relies on the implicit assumption of the solution boundedness,\ndictated also by the chemical feasibility (the state variables stand for the\nconcentrations of chemicals). Furthermore, to test the synchronization\ncondition one needs to know an explicit bound for a solution, which generally\ncannot be guaranteed under linear coupling. At the same time, we show that\nthese restrictions can be avoided for a nonlinear synchronization protocol,\nwhere the control inputs are \"saturated\" by a special nonlinear function\n(belonging to a wide class), which guarantees nonnegativity of the solutions\nand allows to get explicit ultimate bounds for them. We prove that oscillators\nsynchronize under such a protocol, provided that the couplings are sufficiently\nstrong.\n", "  Populations of flashing fireflies, claps of applauding audience, cells of\ncardiac and circadian pacemakers reach synchrony via event-triggered\ninteractions, referred to as pulse couplings. Synchronization via pulse\ncoupling is widely used in wireless sensor networks, providing clock\nsynchronization with parsimonious packet exchanges. In spite of serious\nattention paid to networks of pulse coupled oscillators, there is a lack of\nmathematical results, addressing networks with general communication topologies\nand general phase-response curves of the oscillators. The most general results\nof this type (Wang et al., 2012, 2015) establish synchronization of oscillators\nwith a delay-advance phase-response curve over strongly connected networks. In\nthis paper we extend this result by relaxing the connectivity condition to the\nexistence of a root node (or a directed spanning tree) in the graph. This\ncondition is also necessary for synchronization.\n", "  Low-temperature thermal conductivity measurements were performed on single\ncrystal of PbTaSe$_2$, a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with topological\nbulk nodal lines in the electronic band structure. It is found that the\nresidual linear term $\\kappa_0/T$ is negligible in zero magnetic field.\nFurthermore, the field dependence of $\\kappa_0/T$ exhibits a clear \"$S$\"-shape\ncurve. These results suggest that PbTaSe$_2$ has multiple nodeless\nsuperconducting gaps. Therefore, the spin-triplet state with gap nodes does not\nplay an important role in this noncentrosymmetric superconductor with strong\nspin-orbital coupling. The fully gapped superconducting state also meets the\nrequirement of a topological superconductor, if PbTaSe$_2$ is indeed the case.\n", "  We report low-temperature heat transport measurements on superconducting iron\nsulfide FeS with $T_c \\approx$ 5 K, which has the same crystal structure and\nsimilar electronic band structure to the superconducting iron selenide FeSe. In\nzero magnetic field, a significant residual linear term $\\kappa_0/T$ is\nobserved. At low field, $\\kappa_0/T$ increases rapidly with the increase of\nfield. These results provide strong evidence for nodal superconducting gap in\nFeS. We compare it with the sister compound FeSe, and other iron-based\nsuperconductors with nodal gap.\n", "  We prove that conformally parametrized surfaces in Euclidean space $\\Rcubec$\nof curvature $c$ admit a symmetry reduction of their Gauss-Codazzi equations\nwhose general solution is expressed with the sixth Painlev\\'e function.\nMoreover, it is shown that the two known solutions of this type (Bonnet 1867,\nBobenko, Eitner and Kitaev 1997) can be recovered by such a reduction.\n", "  Processes related to the production of vorticity in the forward and rear\nflank downdrafts and their interaction with the boundary layer are thought to\nplay a role in tornadogenesis. We argue that an inverse energy cascade is a\nplausible mechanism for tornadogenesis and tornado maintenance and provide\nsupporting evidence which is both numerical and observational. We apply a\nthree-dimensional vortex gas model to supercritical vortices produced at the\nsurface boundary layer possibly due to interactions of vortices brought to the\nsurface by the rear flank downdraft and also to those related to the forward\nflank downdraft. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional vortex gas models are\ndiscussed, and the three-dimensional vortex gas model of Chorin, developed\nfurther by Flandoli and Gubinelli, is proposed as a model for intense small-\nscale subvortices found in tornadoes and in recent numerical studies by Orf et\nal. In this paper, the smaller scales are represented by intense, supercritical\nvortices, which transfer energy to the larger-scale tornadic flows (inverse\nenergy cascade). We address the formation of these vortices as a result of the\ninteraction of the flow with the surface and a boundary layer.\n", "  A large number of examples of compact $G_2$ manifolds, relevant to\nsupersymmetric compactifications of M-Theory to four dimensions, can be\nconstructed by forming a twisted connected sum of two appropriate building\nblocks times a circle. These building blocks, which are appropriate $K3$-fibred\nthreefolds, are shown to have a natural and elegant construction in terms of\ntops, which parallels the construction of Calabi-Yau manifolds via reflexive\npolytopes.\n", "  Quantum annealing provides a way of solving optimization problems by encoding\nthem as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The\nsolution of the optimization problem then corresponds to the ground state of\nthe system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the\nground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major\ndifficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing\ndevices is the fact that many real world optimization problems require\ninteractions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the\nlimitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of\nhow to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only\nprovides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design\nof such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits in which effective\nN-body interactions are implemented using N ancilla qubits and only two\ninductive couplers. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as the unit\ncell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding\ntechnique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary\nconnectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbor four-body\ninteractions. It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear\neffects in the coupling loops as well as mismatches in some of the circuit\nparameters.\n", "  As the simplest iron-based superconductor, FeSe forms a tetragonal structure\nwith transition temperature Tc ~ 8 K. With assistance of pressure, or other\ntechniques, Tc can be greatly enhanced, even to above liquid nitrogen\ntemperature. The newly discovered superconducting tetragonal FeS (Tc ~ 4.5 K),\na sulfide counterpart of FeSe, promotes us on its high pressure investigation.\nThe transport and structure evolution of FeS with pressure have been studied. A\nrapid suppression of Tc and vanishing of superconductivity at 4.0 GPa are\nobserved, followed by a second superconducting dome with a 30% enhancement in\nmaximum Tc. An onsite tetragonal to hexagonal phase transition occurs around\n7.0 GPa, followed by a broad pressure range of phase coexistence. The residual\ndeformed tetragonal phase is considered as the source of second superconducting\ndome. The observation of two superconducting domes in iron-based\nsuperconductors poses great challenges for understanding their pairing\nmechanism.\n", "  In order to describe the coupling between the Kerr nonlinearity and the\nstimulated Brillouin scattering, Mauger et alii recently proposed a system of\npartial differential equations in three complex amplitudes. We perform here its\nanalytic study by two methods. The first method is to investigate the structure\nof singularities, in order to possibly find closed form singlevalued solutions\nobeying this structure. The second method is to look at the infinitesimal\nsymmetries of the system in order to build reductions to a lesser number of\nindependent variables. Our overall conclusion is that the structure of\nsingularities is too intricate to obtain closed form solutions by the usual\nmethods. One of our results is the proof of the nonexistence of traveling\nwaves.\n", "  In this paper we add a compact dimension to Schwarzschild-(anti-) de sitter\nand Kerr-(anti-) de sitter spacetimes, which describes (rotating) black\nstring-(anti-) de sitter spacetime. We study the geodesic motion of test\nparticles and light rays in this spacetime. We present the analytical solutions\nof the geodesic equations in terms of Weierstrass elliptic and Kleinian sigma\nhyperelliptical functions. We also discuss the possible orbits and classify\nthem according to particle's energy and angular momentum. Moreover, the\nobtained results, are compared to Schwarzschild-(anti-) de sitter and\nKerr-(anti-) de sitter spacetimes.\n", "  We report the first all-optical production of a superfluid Bose-Fermi mixture\nwith two spin states of $^6$Li (fermion) and one spin state of $^7$Li (boson)\nunder the resonant magnetic field of the s-wave Feshbach resonance of the\nfermions. Fermions are cooled efficiently by evaporative cooling and they serve\nas coolant for bosons. As a result, a superfluid mixture can be achieved by\nusing a simple experimental apparatus and procedures, as in the case of the\nall-optical production of a single Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We show that\nthe all-optical method enables us to realize variety of ultracold Bose-Fermi\nmixtures.\n", "  We investigate the effects of charged-current (CC) nonstandard neutrino\ninteractions (NSIs) at the source and at the detector in the simulated data for\nthe planned Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), while neglecting the\nneutral-current NSIs at the propagation due to the fact that several solutions\nhave been proposed to resolve the degeneracies posed by neutral-current NSIs\nwhile no solution exists for the degeneracies due to the CC NSIs. We study the\neffects of CC NSIs on the simultaneous measurements of $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ in DUNE. The analysis reveals that 3$\\sigma $ C.L. measurement of\nthe correct octant of $\\theta_{23}$ in the standard mixing scenario is spoiled\nif the CC NSIs are taken into account. Likewise, the CC NSIs can deteriorate\nthe uncertainty of the $\\delta_{CP}$ measurement by a factor of two relative to\nthat in the standard oscillation scenario. We also show that the source and the\ndetector CC NSIs can induce a significant amount of fake CP-violation and the\nCP-conserving case can be excluded by more than 80\\% C.L. in the presence of\nfake CP-violation. We further find the potential of DUNE to constrain the\nrelevant CC NSI parameters from the single parameter fits for both neutrino and\nantineutrino appearance and disappearance channels at both the near and far\ndetectors. The results show that there could be improvement in the current\nbounds by at least one order of magnitude at the near and far detector of DUNE\nexcept a few parameters which remain weaker at the far detector.\n", "  Nous montrons que les \\'equations du rep\\`ere mobile des surfaces de Bonnet\nconduisent \\`a une paire de Lax matricielle isomonodromique d'ordre deux pour\nla sixi\\`eme \\'equation de Painlev\\'e.\n  We show that the moving frame equations of Bonnet surfaces can be\nextrapolated to a second order, isomonodromic matrix Lax pair of the sixth\nPainlev\\'e equation.\n", "  The low energy expansion of Type II superstring amplitudes at genus one is\norganized in terms of modular graph functions associated with Feynman graphs of\na conformal scalar field on the torus. In earlier work, surprising identities\nbetween two-loop graphs at all weights, and between higher-loop graphs of\nweights four and five were constructed. In the present paper, these results are\ngeneralized in two complementary directions. First, all identities at weight\nsix and all dihedral identities at weight seven are obtained and proven.\nWhenever the Laurent polynomial at the cusp is available, the form of these\nidentities confirms the pattern by which the vanishing of the Laurent\npolynomial governs the full modular identity. Second, the family of modular\ngraph functions is extended to include all graphs with derivative couplings and\nworldsheet fermions. These extended families of modular graph functions are\nshown to obey a hierarchy of inhomogeneous Laplace eigenvalue equations. The\neigenvalues for the extended family of dihedral modular graph functions are\ncalculated analytically for the simplest infinite sub-families and obtained by\nMaple for successively more complicated sub-families. The spectrum is shown to\nconsist solely of eigenvalues $s(s-1)$ for positive integers $s$ bounded by the\nweight, with multiplicities which exhibit rich representation-theoretic\npatterns.\n", "  One of the readily accessible observables in trapped cold-atom experiments is\nthe column density, which is determined from optical depth (OD) obtained from\nabsorption imaging and the absorption cross-section ($\\sigma_{\\rm abs}$). Here\nwe report on simple and accurate determination of OD for dense gases of light\natoms such as lithium-6. We investigate theoretically and experimentally an\nappropriate condition for the probe intensity and duration to achieve good\nsignal-to-noise ratio by considering the influences of photon recoils and\nphoton shot noises. As a result, we have succeeded in measuring OD which\nreached 2.5 with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 under spatial resolution of 1.7\n$\\mu$m.\n", "  The effects of thermal noise on particle rearrangements in colloidal\nsuspensions undergoing cyclic shear are experimentally investigated using\nparticle tracking methods. The experimental model system consists of\npolystyrene particles adsorbed at an oil- water interface, in which the\nparticles exhibit small but non-negligible Brownian motion. We perform\nexperiments on bidisperse (1 and 1.2 $\\mu$m in size) colloidal samples with\narea fractions ($\\phi$ ) of 0.20 and 0.32. Reversibility of particle\nrearrangements are characterized, and we show that unlike dense athermal\nsystems, reversible clusters are not stable; once a particle enters into a\nreversible trajectory, it has a nonzero probability of becoming irreversible in\nthe following shearing cycle. This probability was previously found to be\napproximately zero for an analogous athermal system. We demonstrate that the\nstability of reversibility depends both on packing fraction, $\\phi$ , and the\nshearing amplitude, $\\gamma_0$. In addition, we identify hysteresis in the\ndynamics of rearrangements for reversible particles, which indicates that such\nrearrangements are dissipative. At lower packing fractions, this hysteresis\nbecomes less prominent, and the dynamics is moved closer to equilibrium by\nthermal noise.\n", "  The fast development of superconducting nanowire single photon detector\n(SNSPD) in the past decade has enabled many advances in quantum information\ntechnology. The best system detection efficiency (SDE) record at 1550 nm\nwavelength was 93% obtained from SNSPD made of amorphous WSi which usually\noperated at sub-kelvin temperatures. We first demonstrate SNSPD made of\npolycrystalline NbN with SDE of 90.2% for 1550 nm wavelength at 2.1K,\naccessible with a compact cryocooler. The SDE saturated to 92.1% when the\ntemperature was lowered to 1.8K. The results lighten the practical and high\nperformance SNSPD to quantum information and other high-end applications.\n", "  Simulating the stochastic evolution of real quantities on a digital computer\nrequires a trade-off between the precision to which these quantities are\napproximated, and the memory required to store them. The statistical accuracy\nof the simulation is thus generally limited by the internal memory available to\nthe simulator. Here, using tools from computational mechanics, we show that\nquantum processors with a fixed finite memory can simulate stochastic processes\nof real variables to arbitrarily high precision. This demonstrates a provable,\nunbounded memory advantage that a quantum simulator can exhibit over its best\npossible classical counterpart.\n", "  Given a sphere with Bartnik data close to that of a round sphere in Euclidean\n3-space, we compute its Bartnik-Bray outer mass to first order in the data's\ndeviation from the standard sphere. The Hawking mass gives a well-known lower\nbound, and an upper bound is obtained by estimating the mass of a static vacuum\nextension. As an application we confirm that in a time-symmetric slice\nconcentric geodesic balls shrinking to a point have mass-to-volume ratio\nconverging to the energy density at their center, in accord with physical\nexpectation and the behavior of other quasilocal masses. For balls shrinking to\na flat point we can also compute the outer mass to fifth order in the\nradius---the term is proportional to the Laplacian of the scalar curvature at\nthe center---but our estimate is not refined enough to identify this term at a\npoint which is merely scalar flat. In particular it cannot discern\ngravitational contributions to the mass.\n", "  The problem of classifying off-shell representations of the $N$ -extended\none-dimensional super Poincar\\'e algebra is closely related to the study of a\nclass of decorated $N$-regular, $N$-edge colored bipartite graphs known as\nAdinkras. In previous work we canonically embedded these graphs into explicitly\nuniformized Riemann surfaces via the \"dessins d'enfant\" construction of\nGrothendieck. The Adinkra graphs carry two additional structures: a selection\nof dashed edges and an assignment of integral helghts to the vertices. In this\npaper, we complete the passage from algebra, through discrete structures, to\ngeometry. We show that the dashings correspond to special spin structures on\nthe Riemann surface, defining thereby super Riemann surfaces. Height\nassignments determine discrete Morse functions, from which we produce a set of\nMorse divisors which capture the topological properties of the height\nassignments.\n", "  We study the phenomenological consequences of several $CP$-violating\nstructures that could arise in the Standard Model effective field theory\nframework. Focusing on operators involving electroweak gauge and/or Higgs\nbosons, we derive constraints originating from Run I LHC data. We then study\nthe capabilities of the present and future LHC runs at higher energies to\nfurther probe associated CP-violating phenomena and we demonstrate how\ndifferential information can play a key role. We consider both traditional\nfour-lepton probes of CP-violation in the Higgs sector and novel new physics\nhandles based on varied angular and non-angular observables.\n", "  We experimentally determined various thermodynamic quantities of interacting\ntwo-component fermions at the zero-temperature limit from the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) region to the unitarity limit. The obtained\nresults are very accurate in the sense that the systematic error is within 4%\naround the unitarity limit. Using this advantage, we can compare our data with\nvarious many-body theories. We found that an extended ${\\it T}$-matrix\napproximation, which is a strong-coupling theory involving fluctuations in the\nCooper channel, well reproduces our experimental results. We also found that\nthe superfluid order parameter ${\\it \\Delta}$ calculated by solving the\nordinary BCS gap equation with the chemical potential of interacting fermions\nis close to the binding energy of the paired fermions directly observed in a\nspectroscopic experiment and that obtained using a quantum Monte Carlo method.\nSince understanding the strong-coupling properties of a superfluid Fermi gas in\nthe BCS-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover region is a crucial issue in\ncondensed matter physics and nuclear physics, the results of the present study\nare expected to be useful in the further development of these fields.\n", "  Finding and sampling rare trajectories in dynamical systems is a difficult\ncomputational task underlying numerous problems and applications. In this paper\nwe show how to construct Metropolis- Hastings Monte Carlo methods that can\nefficiently sample rare trajectories in the (extremely rough) phase space of\nchaotic systems. As examples of our general framework we compute the\ndistribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (in different chaotic maps) and\nthe distribution of escape times (in transient-chaos problems). Our methods\nsample exponentially rare states in polynomial number of samples (in both low-\nand high-dimensional systems). An open-source software that implements our\nalgorithms and reproduces our results can be found in\nhttps://github.com/jorgecarleitao/chaospp\n", "  In recent years, we have observed a significant trend towards filling the gap\nbetween social network analysis and control. This trend was enabled by the\nintroduction of new mathematical models describing dynamics of social groups,\nthe advancement in complex networks theory and multi-agent systems, and the\ndevelopment of modern computational tools for big data analysis. The aim of\nthis tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with\napplications to social systems, to the attention of the broad research\ncommunity. This paper is the first part of the tutorial, and it is focused on\nthe most classical models of social dynamics and on their relations to the\nrecent achievements in multi-agent systems.\n", "  We provide a large class of quantum evolution governed by the memory kernel\nmaster equation. This class defines quantum analog of so called semi-Markov\nclassical stochastic evolution. In this Letter for the first time we provide a\nproper definition of quantum semi-Markov evolution and using the appropriate\ngauge freedom we propose a suitable generalization which contains majority of\nexamples considered so far in the literature. The key concepts are quantum\ncounterparts of classical waiting time distribution and survival probability --\nquantum waiting time operator and quantum survival operator, respectively. In\nparticular collision models and its generalizations considered recently are\nspecial examples of generalized semi-Markov evolution. This approach allows for\nan interesting generalization of trajectory description of the quantum dynamics\nin terms of POVM densities.\n", "  We develop a framework for stress response in two dimensional granular media,\nwith and without friction, that respects vector force balance at the\nmicroscopic level. We introduce local gauge degrees of freedom that determine\nthe response of contact forces between constituent grains on a given,\ndisordered, contact network, to external perturbations. By mapping this\nresponse to the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian corresponding to the\nunderlying contact network, we show that this naturally leads to spatial\nlocalization of forces. We present numerical evidence for localization using\nexact diagonalization studies of network Laplacians of soft disk packings.\nFinally, we discuss the role of other constraints, such as torque balance, in\ndetermining the stability of a granular packing to external perturbations.\n", "  Several extensions of the Standard Model contain right-handed (sterile)\nneutrinos in the GeV-TeV mass range. Due to their mixing with the active\nneutrinos, they may give rise to novel effects in cosmology, neutrino physics,\nand collider searches. In addition, right-handed neutrinos can also appear as\nfinal states from dark matter annihilations, with important implications for\ndark matter indirect detection searches. In this paper, we use current data\nfrom the Fermi Large Area Telescope (6-year observation of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies) and H.E.S.S. (10-year observation of the Galactic center) to\nconstrain the annihilation of dark matter into right-handed neutrinos. We\nconsider right-handed neutrino with masses between 10 GeV and 1 TeV, including\nboth two-body and three-body decays, to derive bounds on the dark matter\nannihilation rate, $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle$, as a function of the dark matter\nmass. Our results show, in particular, that the thermal dark matter\nannihilation cross section, $3\\times 10^{-26}\\, {\\rm cm^3 s^{-1}} $, into\nright-handed neutrinos is excluded for dark matter masses smaller than $200$\nGeV.\n", "  We present a parallel network of 16 demagnetization refrigerators mounted on\na cryofree dilution refrigerator aimed to cool nanoelectronic devices to\nsub-millikelvin temperatures. To measure the refrigerator temperature, the\nthermal motion of electrons in a Ag wire -- thermalized by a spot-weld to one\nof the Cu nuclear refrigerators -- is inductively picked-up by a\nsuperconducting gradiometer and amplified by a SQUID mounted at 4 K. The noise\nthermometer as well as other thermometers are used to characterize the\nperformance of the system, finding magnetic field independent heat-leaks of a\nfew nW/mol, cold times of several days below 1 mK, and a lowest temperature of\n150 microK of one of the nuclear stages in a final field of 80 mT, close to the\nintrinsic SQUID noise of about 100 microK. A simple thermal model of the system\ncapturing the nuclear refrigerator, heat leaks, as well as thermal and Korringa\nlinks describes the main features very well, including rather high refrigerator\nefficiencies typically above 80%.\n", "  We investigate the etching of a pure hydrogen plasma on graphite samples and\ngraphene flakes on SiO$_2$ and hexagonal Boron-Nitride (hBN) substrates. The\npressure and distance dependence of the graphite exposure experiments reveals\nthe existence of two distinct plasma regimes: the direct and the remote plasma\nregime. Graphite surfaces exposed directly to the hydrogen plasma exhibit\nnumerous etch pits of various size and depth, indicating continuous defect\ncreation throughout the etching process. In contrast, anisotropic etching\nforming regular and symmetric hexagons starting only from preexisting defects\nand edges is seen in the remote plasma regime, where the sample is located\ndownstream, outside of the glowing plasma. This regime is possible in a narrow\nwindow of parameters where essentially all ions have already recombined, yet a\nflux of H-radicals performing anisotropic etching is still present. At the\nrequired process pressures, the radicals can recombine only on surfaces, not in\nthe gas itself. Thus, the tube material needs to exhibit a sufficiently low H\nradical recombination coefficient, such a found for quartz or pyrex. In the\nremote regime, we investigate the etching of single layer and bilayer graphene\non SiO$_2$ and hBN substrates. We find isotropic etching for single layer\ngraphene on SiO$_2$, whereas we observe highly anisotropic etching for graphene\non a hBN substrate. For bilayer graphene, anisotropic etching is observed on\nboth substrates. Finally, we demonstrate the use of artificial defects to\ncreate well defined graphene nanostructures with clean crystallographic edges.\n", "  Graphene pseudohalides are natural candidates for use in molecular sensing\ndue to their greater chemical activity as compared to both graphene halides and\npristine graphene. Though their study is still in its infancy, being hindered\nuntil recently by the unavailability of both selective and efficient procedures\nfor their synthesis, they promise to considerably widen the application\npotential of chemically modified graphenes. Herein, we employ vdW-DFT to study\nthe structural and electronic properties of two selected graphene pseudohalides\nnamely cyanographone and isocyanographone and investigate the potential use of\nthe latter as a chemical sensor via electron transport calculations.\n", "  The two-channel Kondo impurity model realizes a local non-Fermi liquid state\nwith finite residual entropy. The competition between the two channels drives\nthe system to an impurity quantum critical point. We show that the\nout-of-time-ordered (OTO) commutator for the impurity spin reveals markedly\ndistinct behaviour depending on the low energy impurity state. For the one\nchannel Kondo model with Fermi liquid ground state, the OTO commutator vanishes\nfor late times, indicating the absence of the butterfly effect. For the two\nchannel case, the impurity OTO commutator is completely temperature independent\nand saturates quickly to its upper bound 1/4, and the butterfly effect is\nmaximally enhanced. These compare favourably to numerics on spin chain\nrepresentation of the Kondo model. Our results imply that a large late time\nvalue of the OTO commutator does not necessarily diagnose quantum chaos.\n", "  We develop a quantum simulator architecture that is suitable for the\nsimulation of $U(1)$ Abelian gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics.\nOur approach relies on the ability to control the hopping of a particle through\na barrier by means of the internal quantum states of a neutral or charged\nimpurity-particle sitting at the barrier. This scheme is experimentally\nfeasible, as the correlated hopping does not require fine-tuning of the intra-\nand inter-species interactions. We investigate the applicability of the scheme\nin a double well potential, which is the basic building block of the simulator,\nboth at the single-particle and the many-body mean-field level. Moreover, we\nevaluate its performance for different particle interactions and trapping, and,\nspecifically for atom-ion systems, in the presence of micro-motion.\n", "  Third order tensors have wide applications in mechanics, physics and\nengineering. The most famous and useful third order tensor is the piezoelectric\ntensor, which plays a key role in the piezoelectric effect, first discovered by\nCurie brothers. On the other hand, the Levi-Civita tensor is famous in tensor\ncalculus. In this paper, we study third order tensors and (third order)\nhypermatrices systematically, by regarding a third order tensor as a linear\noperator which transforms a second order tensor into a first order tensor, or a\nfirst order tensor into a second order tensor. For a third order tensor, we\ndefine its transpose, kernel tensor and L-eigenvalues. Here, \"L\" is named after\nLevi-Civita. The transpose of a third order tensor is uniquely defined. In\nparticular, the transpose of the piezoelectric tensor is the inverse\npiezoelectric tensor (the electrostriction tensor). The kernel tensor of a\nthird order tensor is a second order positive semi-definite symmetric tensor,\nwhich is the product of that third order tensor and its transpose. We define\nL-eigenvalues, singular values, C-eigenvalues and Z-eigenvalues for a third\norder tensor. They are all invariants of that third order tensor. For a third\norder partially symmetric tensor, we give its eigenvector decomposition. The\npiezoelectric tensor, the inverse piezoelectric tensor, and third order\nsymmetric tensors are third order partially symmetric tensors. We make a\nconjecture a third order symmetric tensor has seven independent invariants. We\nraise the questions on how may independent invariants a third order tensor, a\nthird order partially symmetric tensor and a third order cyclically symmetric\ntensor may have respectively.\n", "  This work builds upon the recent demonstration of a phononic four-wave mixing\n(FWM) pathway mediated by parametric resonance. In such a process, drive tones\nf_d1 and f_d2 associated with a specific phonon mode interact such that one of\nthe drive tones also parametrically excites a second mode at a sub-harmonic\nfrequency and such interactions result in a frequency comb f_d1/2 +/-\nn(f_d1-f_d2 ). However, the specific behaviour associated with the case where\nboth drive tones can independently excite the sub-harmonic phonon mode has not\nbeen studied or previously described. While it may be possible to expect the\nmerger of two frequency combs f_d1/2 +/- n(f_d1-f_d2 ) and f_d2/2 +/-\nn(f_d1-f_d2 ), this paper indicates that only one of these mechanisms is\nselected and also shows an interesting transition linked to this process. Such\nfrequency transitions from f_d1/2 +/- n(f_d1-f_d2 ) to f_d2/2 +/- n(f_d1-f_d2 )\nholds potential promise for computing applications.\n", "  Nodal-line semimetals, one of the topological semimetals, have degeneracy\nalong nodal lines where the band gap is closed. In many cases, the nodal lines\nappear accidentally, and in such cases it is impossible to determine whether\nthe nodal lines appear or not, only from the crystal symmetry and the electron\nfilling. In this paper, for spinless systems, we show that in specific space\ngroups at $4N+2$ fillings ($8N+4$ fillings including the spin degree of\nfreedom), presence of the nodal lines is required regardless of the details of\nthe systems. Here, the spinless systems refer to crystals where the spin-orbit\ncoupling is negligible and the spin degree of freedom can be omitted because of\nthe SU(2) spin degeneracy. In this case the shape of the band structure around\nthese nodal lines is like an hourglass, and we call this a spinless hourglass\nnodal-line semimetal. We construct a model Hamiltonian as an example and we\nshow that it is always in the spinless hourglass nodal-line semimetal phase\neven when the model parameters are changed without changing the symmetries of\nthe system. We also establish a list of all the centrosymmetric space groups,\nunder which spinless systems always have hourglass nodal lines, and illustrate\nwhere the nodal lines are located. We propose that Al$_3$FeSi$_2$, whose\nspace-group symmetry is Pbcn (No. 60), is one of the nodal-line semimetals\narising from this mechanism.\n", "  We prove a result of delocalization for the Anderson model on the regular\ntree (Bethe lattice). When the disorder is weak, it is known that large parts\nof the spectrum are a.s. purely absolutely continuous, and that the dynamical\ntransport is ballistic. In this work, we prove that in such AC regime, the\neigenfunctions are also delocalized in space, in the sense that if we consider\na sequence of regular graphs converging to the regular tree, then the\neigenfunctions become asymptotically uniformly distributed. The precise result\nis a quantum ergodicity theorem.\n", "  Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials\nscience and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the\nlimits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact\nnumerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost,\nwhile Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These\nlimitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom\nmolecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum\ncomputers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to\nmolecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the\nexperimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a\nhundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of\nincreasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient\nvariational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the\navailable interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact\nencoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization\nroutine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the\ntechnique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we\nfind agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model\nof the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the\nmethod to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the\nforefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum\nhardware.\n", "  Recent transport experiments in the cuprate superconductors linked the\nopening of the pseudogap to a change in electronic dispersion [S. Badoux et\nal., Nature 531, 210 (2015)]. Transport measurements showed that the carrier\ndensity sharply changes from $x$ to $1+x$ at the pseudogap critical doping, in\naccordance with the change from Fermi arcs at low doping to a large hole Fermi\nsurface at high doping. The SU(2) theory of cuprates shows that\nantiferromagnetic short range interactions cause the arising of both charge and\nsuperconducting orders, which are related by an SU(2) symmetry. The\nfluctuations associated with this symmetry form a pseudogap phase. Here we\nderive the renormalised electronic propagator under the SU(2) dome, and\ncalculate the spectral functions and transport quantities of the renormalised\nbands. We show that their evolution with doping matches both spectral and\ntransport measurements.\n", "  Recent experiments revealed a striking asymmetry in the phase diagram of the\nhigh temperature cuprate superconductors. The correlation effect seems strong\nin the hole-doped systems and weak in the electron-doped systems. On the other\nhand, a recent theoretical study shows that the interaction strengths (the\nHubbard U) are comparable in these systems. Therefore, it is difficult to\nexplain this asymmetry by their interaction strengths. Given this background,\nwe analyze the one-particle spectrum of a single band model of a cuprate\nsuperconductor near the Fermi level using the dynamical mean field theory. We\nfind the difference in the \"visibility\" of the strong correlation effect\nbetween the hole- and electron-doped systems. This can explain the\nelectron-hole asymmetry of the correlation strength without introducing the\ndifference in the interaction strength.\n", "  Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of\na system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to\ndetect and transmit signals in a noisy environment, suggesting that it is a\ngood candidate to take advantage of SR. In this work, we aim to identify the\noptimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple\nnetwork model of the human brain. Specifically, using a dynamic model\nimplemented on an anatomical brain network (connectome), we investigate the\nsimilarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the\nnetwork while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that\nnon-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and\nthe signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not\nunique; rather, there is a set of parameter values at which the information is\ntransmitted with greater precision, this set corresponds to the parameter\nvalues that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical\npoints in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain\nat criticality.\n", "  We study integrable deformations of sine-Liouville conformal field theory.\nEvery integrable perturbation of this model is related to the series of quantum\nintegrals of motion (hierarchy). We construct the factorized scattering\nmatrices for different integrable perturbed conformal field theories. The\nperturbation theory, Bethe ansatz technique, renormalization group and methods\nof perturbed conformal field theory are applied to show that all integrable\ndeformations of sine-Liouville model possess non-trivial duality properties.\n", "  Networks of stochastic spiking neurons are interesting models in the area of\nTheoretical Neuroscience, presenting both continuous and discontinuous phase\ntransitions. Here we study fully connected networks analytically, numerically\nand by computational simulations. The neurons have dynamic gains that enable\nthe network to converge to a stationary slightly supercritical state\n(self-organized supercriticality or SOSC) in the presence of the continuous\ntransition. We show that SOSC, which presents power laws for neuronal\navalanches plus some large events, is robust as a function of the main\nparameter of the neuronal gain dynamics. We discuss the possible applications\nof the idea of SOSC to biological phenomena like epilepsy and dragon king\navalanches. We also find that neuronal gains can produce collective\noscillations that coexists with neuronal avalanches, with frequencies\ncompatible with characteristic brain rhythms.\n", "  We study classical two-dimensional frustrated Heisenberg models with\ngenerically incommensurate groundstates. A new theory for the spin-nematic\n\"order by disorder\" transition is developed based on the self-consistent\ndetermination of the effective exchange coupling bonds. In our approach,\nfluctuations of the constraint field imposing conservation of the local\nmagnetic moment drive nematicity at low temperatures. The critical temperature\nis found to be highly sensitive to the peak helimagnetic wavevector, and\nvanishes continuously when approaching rotation symmetric Lifshitz points.\nTransitions between symmetry distinct nematic orders may occur by tuning the\nexchange parameters, leading to lines of bicritical points.\n", "  We analyze the statistics of gaps ($\\Delta H$) between successive avalanches\nin one dimensional random field Ising models (RFIMs) in an external field $H$\nat zero temperature. In the first part of the paper we study the\nnearest-neighbour ferromagnetic RFIM. We map the sequence of avalanches in this\nsystem to a non-homogeneous Poisson process with an $H$-dependent rate\n$\\rho(H)$. We use this to analytically compute the distribution of gaps\n$P(\\Delta H)$ between avalanches as the field is increased monotonically from\n$-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. We show that $P(\\Delta H)$ tends to a constant\n$\\mathcal{C}(R)$ as $\\Delta H \\to 0^+$, which displays a non-trivial behaviour\nwith the strength of disorder $R$. We verify our predictions with numerical\nsimulations. In the second part of the paper, motivated by avalanche gap\ndistributions in driven disordered amorphous solids, we study a long-range\nantiferromagnetic RFIM. This model displays a gapped behaviour $P(\\Delta H) =\n0$ up to a system size dependent offset value $\\Delta H_{\\text{off}}$, and\n$P(\\Delta H) \\sim (\\Delta H - \\Delta H_{\\text{off}})^{\\theta}$ as $\\Delta H \\to\nH_{\\text{off}}^+$. We perform numerical simulations on this model and determine\n$\\theta \\approx 0.95(5)$. We also discuss mechanisms which would lead to a\nnon-zero exponent $\\theta$ for general spin models with quenched random fields.\n", "  We numerically study the jamming transition of frictionless polydisperse\nspheres in three dimensions. We use an efficient thermalisation algorithm for\nthe equilibrium hard sphere fluid and generate amorphous jammed packings over a\nrange of critical jamming densities that is about three times broader than in\nprevious studies. This allows us to reexamine a wide range of structural\nproperties characterizing the jamming transition. Both isostaticity and the\ncritical behavior of the pair correlation function hold over the entire range\nof jamming densities. At intermediate length scales, we find a weak, smooth\nincrease of bond orientational order. By contrast, distorted icosahedral\nstructures grow rapidly with increasing the volume fraction in both fluid and\njammed states. Surprisingly, at large scale we observe that denser jammed\nstates show stronger deviations from hyperuniformity, suggesting that the\nenhanced amorphous ordering inherited from the equilibrium fluid competes with,\nrather than enhances, hyperuniformity. Finally, finite size fluctuations of the\ncritical jamming density are considerably suppressed in the denser jammed\nstates, indicating an important change in the topography of the potential\nenergy landscape. By considerably stretching the amplitude of the critical\n\"J-line\", our work disentangles physical properties at the contact scale that\nare associated with jamming criticality, from those occurring at larger length\nscales, which have a different nature.\n", "  In this work, we study the conductance and the thermoelectric properties of a\nquantum dot embedded between two metallic leads with a side-coupled triple\nquantum dot molecule under a magnetic field. We focus on the spin polarization\nand thermoelectric quantities. Our results show the possibility of design an\nefficient spin filter device besides a noticeable enhancement of the Seebeck\ncoefficient driven by the asymmetry in the quantum dots energy levels and a\ntunable pure spin Seebeck effect is obtained. This behavior also holds in the\ninteracting case, where a pure spin Seebeck effect can be obtained for fixed\nvalues of the embedded quantum dot energy level. Our findings could lead to the\nimplementation of a new pure spin energy conversion and capable spin filter\ndevices working with weak magnetic fields.\n", "  The progenitor systems of the class of \"Ca-rich transients\" is a key open\nissue in time domain astrophysics. These intriguing objects exhibit unusually\nstrong calcium line emissions months after explosion, fall within an\nintermediate luminosity range, are often found at large projected distances\nfrom their host galaxies, and may play a vital role in enriching galaxies and\nthe intergalactic medium. Here we present multi-wavelength observations of\niPTF15eqv in NGC 3430, which exhibits a unique combination of properties that\nbridge those observed in Ca-rich transients and Type Ib/c supernovae. iPTF15eqv\nhas among the highest [Ca II]/[O I] emission line ratios observed to date, yet\nis more luminous and decays more slowly than other Ca-rich transients. Optical\nand near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy reveal signatures consistent with\nthe supernova explosion of a < 10 solar mass star that was stripped of its\nH-rich envelope via binary interaction. Distinct chemical abundances and ejecta\nkinematics suggest that the core collapse occurred through electron capture\nprocesses. Deep limits on possible radio emission made with the Jansky Very\nLarge Array imply a clean environment ($n <$ 0.1 cm$^{-3}$) within a radius of\n$\\sim 10^{17}$ cm. Chandra X-ray Observatory observations rule out alternative\nscenarios involving tidal disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole, for\nmasses > 100 solar masses). Our results challenge the notion that\nspectroscopically classified Ca-rich transients only originate from white dwarf\nprogenitor systems, complicate the view that they are all associated with large\nejection velocities, and indicate that their chemical abundances may vary\nwidely between events.\n", "  Temporal networks are increasingly being used to model the interactions of\ncomplex systems. Most studies require the temporal aggregation of edges (or\nevents) into discrete time steps to perform analysis. In this article we\ndescribe a static, lossless, and unique representation of a temporal network,\nthe temporal event graph (TEG). The TEG describes the temporal network in terms\nof both the inter-event time and two-event temporal motif distributions. By\nconsidering these distributions in unison we provide a new method to\ncharacterise the behaviour of individuals and collectives in temporal networks\nas well as providing a natural decomposition of the network. We illustrate the\nutility of the TEG by providing examples on both synthetic and real temporal\nnetworks.\n", "  The strong ellipticity dependence of high-harmonic generation in gases\nenables numerous experimental techniques that are nowadays routinely used, for\ninstance, to create isolated attosecond pulses. Extending such techniques to\nhigh-harmonic generation in solids requires a fundamental understanding of the\nmicroscopic mechanism of the high-harmonic generation. Here, using extensive\nfirst-principles simulations within a time-dependent density-functional\nframework, we show how intraband and interband mechanisms are strongly and\ndifferently affected by the ellipticity of the driving laser field. The complex\ninterplay between intraband and interband effects can be used to tune and\nimprove harmonic emission in solids. In particular, we show that the energy\ncutoff of the high-harmonic plateau can be increased by as much as 30\\% using a\nfinite ellipticity of the driving field, opening a new avenue for better\nunderstanding and control of HHG in solids based on ellipticity. Also, we\ndemonstrate the possibility to generate, from a single circularly polarized\ndriving field, circularly polarized harmonics with alternating helicity. Our\nwork shows that ellipticity provides an additional knob to experimentally\ncontrol high-order harmonic generation in solids.\n", "  A nanomagnet precessing in an external magnetic field can be treated as a\nsource of narrow-bandwidth magnetic noise, that leaves characteristic\nfingerprints in decoherence of a nearby spin qubit undergoing dynamical\ndecoupling. We show how, by measurements of two-qubit coherence, a noise sensor\ncomposed of qubit pair can be used to reconstruct the position of the\nnanomagnet. Such localization of noise source is possible with only two qubit\nprobes, because the course of coherence decay under appropriately designed\ndynamical decoupling sequences contain information not only about noises\nexperienced by each qubit, but also about their cross-correlations. We test the\napplicability of the proposed protocol on an example of two qubits coupled to\nthe nanomagnet via dipolar interaction. We also show how, using a two-qubit\nsensor possessing a particular symmetry, one can localize the nanomagnet even\nwhen the sensor-magnet coupling law is unknown.\n", "  The different point defects formed by two hydrogen atoms or two helium atoms\nin tungsten were investigated through first-principles calculation. The\nenergetically favorable site for a hydrogen atom is tetrahedral interstitial\nsite while substitutional site is the most preferred site for a helium atom.\nThe formation energies of two hydrogen or helium atoms are determined by their\npositions, and there are not a multiple of a single atom's. After relaxation,\ntwo adjacent hydrogen atoms are away from each other while helium atoms are\nclose to. The reasons for the interaction between two hydrogen or helium atoms\nare also discussed.\n", "  We present results from a first attempt to mitigate radio frequency\ninterference in real-time during astronomical measurements with a phased array\nfeed on the 64 m Parkes radio telescope. Suppression of up to 20 dB was\nachieved despite errors in estimating the interference spatial signature. Best\nresults were achieved in the clean excision of a narrowband and stationary\nclock signal that originates from the receiver's digital back-end system. We\nalso contribute a method to interpolate valid beamformer weights at\ninterference-affected channels. Correct initial beam weights are required to\navoid suppressing the desired signal.\n", "  Concepts from the field of wave chaos have been shown to successfully predict\nthe statistical properties of linear electromagnetic fields in electrically\nlarge enclosures. The Random Coupling Model (RCM) describes these properties by\nincorporating both universal features described by Random Matrix Theory and the\nsystem-specific features of particular system realizations. In an effort to\nextend this approach to the nonlinear domain, we add an active nonlinear\nfrequency-doubling circuit to an otherwise linear wave chaotic system, and we\nmeasure the statistical properties of the resulting second harmonic fields. We\ndevelop an RCM-based model of this system as two linear chaotic cavities\ncoupled by means of a nonlinear transfer function. The harmonic field strengths\nare predicted to be the product of two statistical quantities and the\nnonlinearity characteristics. Statistical results from measurement-based\ncalculation, RCM-based simulation, and direct experimental measurements are\ncompared and show good agreement over many decades of power.\n", "  It was recently pointed out that direct detection signals from at least three\ndifferent targets may be used to determine whether the Dark Matter (DM)\nparticle is different from its antiparticle. In this work, we examine in detail\nthe feasibility of this test under different conditions, motivated by proposals\nfor future detectors. Specifically, we perform likelihood fits to mock data\nunder the hypotheses that the DM particle is identical to or different from its\nantiparticle, and determine the significance with which the former can be\nrejected in favor of the latter. In our analysis, we consider 3 different\nvalues of the DM mass ($50$ GeV, $300$ GeV, $1$ TeV) and 4 different\nexperimental ensembles, each consisting of at least 3 different targets -- Xe\nand Ar plus one among the following: Si, Ge, $\\mathrm{CaWO_4}$, or\nGe/$\\mathrm{CaWO_4}$. For each of these experimental ensembles and each DM\nmass, the expected discrimination significance is calculated as a function of\nthe DM-nucleon couplings. In the best case scenario, the discrimination\nsignificance can reach $\\mathcal{O}(3\\sigma)$ for three of the four ensembles\nconsidered, and $\\mathcal{O}(5\\sigma)$ for the ensemble including\n$\\mathrm{Si}$, highlighting the need for a variety of experimental targets in\norder to determine the DM properties. These results show that future direct\ndetection signals could be used to exclude, at a statistically significant\nlevel, a Majorana or a real DM particle, giving a critical clue about the\nidentity of the Dark Matter.\n", "  Recent anomalies in $B\\to K^{(*)}\\ell\\ell$ meson decays are consistent with\nexchange of a heavy $Z'$ vector boson. Here we try to connect such new physics\nto understanding the origin of flavor, by gauging generation number.\nPhenomenological and theoretical considerations suggest that the smallest\nviable flavor symmetry (not including any extra U(1) factors) is chiral ${\\rm\nSU(3)}_L\\times{\\rm SU(3)}_R$, which acts only on generation indices and does\nnot distinguish between quarks and leptons. Spontaneous breaking of the\nsymmetry gives rise to the standard model Yukawa matrices, and masses for the\n16 $Z'$-like gauge bosons, one of which is presumed to be light enough to\nexplain the $B\\to K^{(*)}\\ell\\ell$ anomalies. We perform a bottom-up study of\nthis framework, showing that it is highly constrained by LHC dilepton searches,\nmeson mixing, $Z$ decays and CKM unitarity. Similar anomalies are predicted for\nsemileptonic decays of $B$ to lighter mesons, with excesses in the\n$ee,\\tau\\tau$ channels and deficits in $\\mu\\mu$, but no deviation in $\\nu\\nu$.\nThe lightest $Z'$ mass is $\\lesssim 6\\,$TeV if the gauge coupling is $\\lesssim\n1$.\n", "  We present the ultra-low-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on\nsingle crystals of the prototypical charge-density-wave material 1$T$-TaS$_2$,\nwhich was recently argued to be a candidate for quantum spin liquid. Our\nexperiments show that the residual linear term of thermal conductivity at zero\nfield is essentially zero, within the experimental accuracy. Furthermore, the\nthermal conductivity is found to be insensitive to the magnetic field up to 9\nT. These results clearly demonstrate the absence of itinerant magnetic\nexcitations with fermionic statistics in bulk 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and, thus, put a\nstrong constraint on the theories of the ground state of this material.\n", "  The transmission matrix is a unique tool to control light through a\nscattering medium. A monochromatic transmission matrix does not allow temporal\ncontrol of broadband light. Conversely, measuring multiple transmission\nmatrices with spectral resolution allows fine temporal control when a pulse is\ntemporally broadened upon multiple scattering, but requires very long\nmeasurement time. Here, we show that a single linear operator, measured for a\nbroadband pulse with a co-propagating reference, naturally allows for spatial\nfocusing, and interestingly generates a two-fold temporal recompression at the\nfocus, compared with the natural temporal broadening. This is particularly\nrelevant for non-linear imaging techniques in biological tissues.\n", "  In this work we analyze the gravitational wave signal from hypermassive\nneutron stars formed after the merger of binary neutron star systems, focusing\non its spectral features. The gravitational wave signals are extracted from\nnumerical relativity simulations of models already considered by De Pietri et\nal. [Phys. Rev. D 93, 064047 (2016)], Maione et al. [Classical Quantum Gravity\n33, 175009 (2016)], and Feo et al. [Classical Quantum Gravity 34, 034001\n(2017)], and allow us to study the effect of the total baryonic mass of such\nsystems (from $2.4 M_{\\odot}$ to $3 M_{\\odot}$), the mass ratio (up to $q =\n0.77$), and the neutron star equation of state, both in equal and highly\nunequal mass binaries. We use the peaks we find in the gravitational spectrum\nas an independent test of already published hypotheses of their physical origin\nand empirical relations linking them with the characteristics of the merging\nneutron stars. In particular, we highlight the effects of the mass ratio, which\nin the past was often neglected. We also analyze the temporal evolution of the\nemission frequencies. Finally, we introduce a modern variant of Prony's method\nto analyze the gravitational wave postmerger emission as a sum of complex\nexponentials, trying to overcome some drawbacks of both Fourier spectra and\nleast-squares fitting. Overall, the spectral properties of the postmerger\nsignal observed in our simulation are in agreement with those proposed by other\ngroups. More specifically, we find that the analysis of Bauswein and\nStergioulas [Phys. Rev. D 91, 124056 (2015)] is particularly effective for\nbinaries with very low masses or with a small mass ratio and that the\nmechanical toy model of Takami et al. [Phys. Rev. D 91, 064001 (2015)] provides\na comprehensive and accurate description of the early stages of the postmerger.\n", "  We expect that $BR(\\chi_{c2}(2P)\\to gluon\\, gluon)\\gtrsim 2 \\%$ if Particle\nData Group as well as BaBar and Belle collaboration correctly identified the\nstate. In reality, this branching ratio corresponds to the one for\n$\\chi_{c2}(2P)$ decaying to the light hadrons. We also discuss the detection\npossibilities of these decays.\n", "  We introduce unitary quantum gates for photon pair creation in spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion nonlinear crystals (NLs) and for photon path\nalignment. These are the two key ingredients for the method of \"induced\ncoherence without induced emission\" and many ensuing variations thereof. The\ndifficulty in doing so stems from an apparent mixing of the mode picture (such\nas the polarization of photons) and the Fock picture (such as the existence of\nthe photons). We illustrate utility of these gates by obtaining quantum\ncircuits for the experimental setups of the frustrated generation of photon\npairs, identification of a point-like object with undetected photons, and\ncreation of a Bell state. We also introduce an effective nonunitary description\nfor the action of NLs in experiments where all the NLs are pumped coherently.\nAs an example, by using this simplifying picture, we show how NLs can be used\nto create superposition of given quantum states in a modular fashion.\n", "  In order to unambiguously identify the source of magnetism reported in recent\nstudies of the Co-Te system, two sets of high-quality, epitaxial CoTe$_x$ films\n(thickness $\\simeq$ 300 nm) were prepared by pulse laser deposition (PLD).\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that all of the films are epitaxial along the\n[001] direction and have the hexagonal NiAs structure. There is no indication\nof any second phase metallic Co peaks (either $fcc$ or $hcp$) in the XRD\npatterns. The two sets of CoTe$_x$ films were grown on various substrates with\nPLD targets having Co:Te in the atomic ratio of 50:50 and 35:65. From the\nmeasured lattice parameters $c = 5.396 \\AA$ for the former and $c = 5.402\\AA$\nfor the latter, the compositions CoTe$_{1.71}$ (63.1% Te) and CoTe$_{1.76}$\n(63.8% Te), respectively, are assigned to the principal phase. Although XRD\nshows no trace of metallic Co second phase, the magnetic measurements do show a\nferromagnetic contribution for both sets of films with the saturation\nmagnetization values for the CoTe$_{1.71}$ films being approximately four times\nthe values for the CoTe$_{1.76}$ films. $^{59}$Co spin-echo nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) clearly shows the existence of metallic Co inclusions in the\nfilms. The source of weak ferromagnetism reported in several recent studies is\ndue to the presence of metallic Co, since the stoichiometric composition \"CoTe\"\ndoes not exist.\n", "  We assess two different non-equilibrium quantum Landauer bounds: the\ntraditional approach based on the change in entropy, referred to as the\n`entropic bound', and one based on the details of the dynamical map, referred\nto as the `thermodynamic bound'. By first restricting to a simple exactly\nsolvable model of a single two level system coupled to a finite dimensional\nthermal environment and by exploiting an excitation preserving interaction, we\nestablish the dominant role played by the population terms in dictating the\ntightness of these bounds with respect to the dissipated heat, and clearly\nestablish that coherences only affect the entropic bound. Furthermore, we show\nthat sharp boundaries between the relative performance of the two quantities\nemerge, and find that there are clear instances where both approaches return a\nbound weaker than Clausius' statement of the second law, rendering them\nineffective. Finally we show that our results extend to generic interaction\nterms.\n", "  Coherent communication over mesoscale distances is a necessary condition for\nthe application of solid-state spin qubits to scalable quantum information\nprocessing. Among other routes under study, one possibility entails the\ngeneration of magnetostatic surface spin waves (MSSW) dipolarly coupled to\nshallow paramagnetic defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors. As an initial step\nin this direction, here we make use of room-temperature MSSWs to mediate the\ninteraction between the microwave field from an antenna and the spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We show that this transport spans\ndistances exceeding 3 mm, a manifestation of the MSSW robustness and long\ndiffusion length. Using the NV spin as a local sensor, we find that the MSSW\namplitude grows linearly with the applied microwave power, suggesting this\napproach could be extended to amplify the signal from neighboring spin qubits\nby several orders of magnitude.\n", "  We consider the resonances of the self-adjoint three-dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger operator with point interactions of constant strength supported\non the set $X = \\{ x_n \\}_{n=1}^N$. The size of $X$ is defined by $V_X =\n\\max_{\\pi\\in\\Pi_N} \\sum_{n=1}^N |x_n - x_{\\pi(n)}|$, where $\\Pi_N$ is the\nfamily of all the permutations of the set $\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$. We prove that the\nnumber of resonances counted with multiplicities and lying inside the disc of\nradius $R$ behaves asymptotically linear $\\frac{W_X}{\\pi} R + \\mathcal{O}(1)$\nas $R \\to \\infty$, where the constant $W_X \\in [0,V_X]$ can be seen as the\neffective size of $X$. Moreover, we show that there exist configurations of any\nnumber of points such that $W_X = V_X$. Finally, we construct an example for $N\n= 4$ with $W_X < V_X$, which can be viewed as an analogue of a quantum graph\nwith non-Weyl asymptotics of resonances.\n", "  This work reports an experimental study on an antiferromagnetic honeycomb\nlattice of MnPS$_3$ that couples the valley degree of freedom to a macroscopic\nantiferromagnetic order. The crystal structure of MnPS$_3$ is identified by\nhigh resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Layer dependent\nangle resolved polarized Raman fingerprints of the MnPS$_3$ crystal are\nobtained and the Raman peak at 383 cm$^{-1}$ exhibits 100% polarity.\nTemperature dependences of anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of MnPS$_3$\ncrystal are measured in superconducting quantum interference device. Magnetic\nparameters like effective magnetic moment, and exchange interaction are\nextracted from the mean field approximation mode. Ambipolar electronic\ntransport channels in MnPS$_3$ are realized by the liquid gating technique. The\nconducting channel of MnPS$_3$ offers a unique platform for exploring the\nspin/valleytronics and magnetic orders in 2D limitation.\n", "  Which density functional is the \"best\" for structure simulations of a\nparticular material? A concise, first principles, approach to answer this\nquestion is presented. The random phase approximation (RPA)--- an accurate many\nbody theory--- is used to evaluate various density functionals. To demonstrate\nand verify the method, we apply it to the hybrid perovskite MAPbI$_3$, a\npromising new solar cell material. The evaluation is done by first creating\nfinite temperature ensembles for small supercells using RPA molecular dynamics,\nand then evaluating the variance between the RPA and various approximate\ndensity functionals for these ensembles. We find that, contrary to recent\nsuggestions, van der Waals functionals do not improve the description of the\nmaterial, whereas hybrid functionals and the SCAN (strongly constrained\nappropriately normed) density functional yield very good agreement with the\nRPA. Finally, our study shows that in the room temperature tetragonal phase of\nMAPbI$_3$, the molecules are preferentially parallel to the shorter lattice\nvectors but reorientation on ps timescales is still possible.\n", "  Within the framework of inflationary models that incorporate a spontaneous\nreduction of the wave function for the emergence of the seeds of cosmic\nstructure, we study the effects on the primordial scalar power spectrum by\nchoosing a novel initial quantum state that characterizes the perturbations of\nthe inflaton. Specifically, we investigate under which conditions one can\nrecover an essentially scale free spectrum of primordial inhomogeneities when\nthe standard Bunch-Davies vacuum is replaced by another one that minimizes the\nrenormalized stress-energy tensor via a Hadamard procedure. We think that this\nnew prescription for selecting the vacuum state is better suited for the\nself-induced collapse proposal than the traditional one in the semiclassical\ngravity picture. We show that the parametrization for the time of collapse,\nconsidered in previous works, is maintained. Also, we obtain an angular\nspectrum for the CMB temperature anisotropies consistent with the one that best\nfits the observational data. Therefore, we conclude that the collapse mechanism\nmight be of a more fundamental character than previously suspected.\n", "  Environment plays a fundamental role in the competition for resources, and\nhence in the evolution of populations. Here, we study a well-mixed, finite\npopulation consisting of two strains competing for the limited resources\nprovided by an environment that randomly switches between states of abundance\nand scarcity. Assuming that one strain grows slightly faster than the other, we\nconsider two scenarios--one of pure resource competition, and one in which one\nstrain provides a public good--and investigate how environmental randomness\n(external noise) coupled to demographic (internal) noise determines the\npopulation's fixation properties and size distribution. By analytical means and\nsimulations, we show that these coupled sources of noise can significantly\nenhance the fixation probability of the slower-growing species. We also show\nthat the population size distribution can be unimodal, bimodal or multimodal\nand undergoes noise-induced transitions between these regimes when the rate of\nswitching matches the population's growth rate.\n", "  Femtosecond laser induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics have been studied\nin multisublattice CoxDy1-x alloys. By performing element and time-resolved\nX-ray spectroscopy, we distinguish the ultrafast quenching of Co3d and Dy4f\nmagnetic order when the initial temperatures are below (T=150K) or above\n(T=270K) the temperature of magnetic compensation (Tcomp). In accordance with\nformer element-resolved investigations and theoretical calculations, we observe\ndifferent dynamics for Co3d and Dy4f spins. In addition we observe that, for a\ngiven laser fluence, the demagnetization amplitudes and demagnetization times\nare not affected by the existence of a temperature of magnetic compensation.\nHowever, our experiment reveals a twofold increase of the ultrafast\ndemagnetization rates for the Dy sublattice at low temperature. In parallel, we\nmeasure a constant demagnetization rate of the Co3d sublattice above and below\nTcomp. This intriguing difference between the Dy4f and Co3d sublattices calls\nfor further theoretical and experimental investigations.\n", "  New Relativistic mean field parameter set IOPB-I has been developed.\n", "  We report on the SuperKEKB Phase I operations of the Large Angle\nBeamstrhalung Monitor (LABM). The detector is described and its performance\ncharacterized using the synchrotron radiation backgrounds from the last Beam\nLine magnets. The backgrounds are also used to determine the expected position\nof the Interaction Point (IP), and the expected background rates during Phase\nII.\n", "  We have measured X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectra at the Pu\n$M_{4,5}$ absorption edges from a newly-prepared high-quality single crystal of\nthe heavy fermion superconductor $^{242}$PuCoGa$_{5}$, exhibiting a critical\ntemperature $T_{c} = 18.7~{\\rm K}$. The experiment probes the vortex phase\nbelow $T_{c}$ and shows that an external magnetic field induces a Pu 5$f$\nmagnetic moment at 2 K equal to the temperature-independent moment measured in\nthe normal phase up to 300 K by a SQUID device. This observation is in\nagreement with theoretical models claiming that the Pu atoms in PuCoGa$_{5}$\nhave a nonmagnetic singlet ground state resulting from the hybridization of the\nconduction electrons with the intermediate-valence 5$f$ electronic shell.\nUnexpectedly, XMCD spectra show that the orbital component of the $5f$ magnetic\nmoment increases significantly between 30 and 2 K; the antiparallel spin\ncomponent increases as well, leaving the total moment practically constant. We\nsuggest that this indicates a low-temperature breakdown of the complete\nKondo-like screening of the local 5$f$ moment.\n", "  A quantum spin-liquid might be realized in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, a\nhoneycomb-lattice magnetic material with substantial spin-orbit coupling.\nMoreover, $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ is a Mott insulator, which implies the\npossibility that novel exotic phases occur upon doping. Here, we study the\nelectronic structure of this material when intercalated with potassium by\nphotoemission spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density\nfunctional theory calculations. We obtain a stable stoichiometry at\nK$_{0.5}$RuCl$_3$. This gives rise to a peculiar charge disproportionation into\nformally Ru$^{2+}$ (4$d^6$) and Ru$^{3+}$ (4$d^5$). Every Ru 4$d^5$ site with\none hole in the $t_{2g}$ shell is surrounded by nearest neighbors of 4$d^6$\ncharacter, where the $t_{2g}$ level is full and magnetically inert. Thus, each\ntype of Ru sites forms a triangular lattice and nearest-neighbor interactions\nof the original honeycomb are blocked.\n", "  We observed surface and electronic structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 single\ncrystal by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) at 4.2 K.\nSquare lattice composed of Bi atoms was observed at a positive sample bias\nvoltage on the surface prepared by cleavage. At a negative sample bias voltage,\na stripe structure running along Bi-Bi directions was observed as in the\nprevious report on NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. Furthermore, we observed a supermodulation\nrunning along the diagonal directions with the period of about 5 times of the\nlattice constant. This seems to be indicative of structural instability of this\nsystem rather than electronic instability attributed to a nesting picture.\n", "  Using the tight-binding approach, we investigate the electronic properties of\nbilayer phosphorene (BLP) quantum dots (QDs) in the presence of perpendicular\nelectric and magnetic fields. Since BLP consists of two coupled phosphorene\nlayers, it is of interest to examine the layer-dependent electronic properties\nof BLP QDs, such as the electronic distributions over the two layers and the\nso-produced layer-polarization features, and to see how these properties are\naffected by the magnetic field and the bias potential. We find that in the\nabsence of a bias potential only edge states are layer-polarized while the bulk\nstates are not, and the layer-polarization degree (LPD) of the unbiased edge\nstates increases with increasing magnetic field. However, in the presence of a\nbias potential both the edge and bulk states are layer-polarized, and the LPD\nof the bulk (edge) states depends strongly (weakly) on the interplay of the\nbias potential and the interlayer coupling. At high magnetic fields, applying a\nbias potential renders the bulk electrons in a BLP QD to be mainly distributed\nover the top or bottom layer, resulting in layer-polarized bulk Landau levels\n(LLs). In the presence of a large bias potential that can drive a\nsemiconductor-to-semimetal transition in BLP, these bulk LLs exhibit different\nmagnetic-field dependences, i.e., the zeroth LLs exhibit a linear-like\ndependence on the magnetic field while the other LLs exhibit a square-root-like\ndependence.\n", "  We consider the Gauss-Manin differential equations for hypergeometric\nintegrals associated with a family of weighted arrangements of hyperplanes\nmoving parallelly to themselves. We reduce these equations modulo a prime\ninteger $p$ and construct polynomial solutions of the new differential\nequations as $p$-analogs of the initial hypergeometric integrals.\n  In some cases we interpret the $p$-analogs of the hypergeometric integrals as\nsums over points of hypersurfaces defined over the finite field $F_p$. That\ninterpretation is similar to the interpretation by Yu.I. Manin in [Ma] of the\nnumber of point on an elliptic curve depending on a parameter as a solution of\na classical hypergeometric differential equation.\n  We discuss the associated Bethe ansatz.\n", "  Many combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped to finding the ground\nstates of the corresponding Ising Hamiltonians. The physical systems that can\nsolve optimization problems in this way, namely Ising machines, have been\nattracting more and more attention recently. Our work shows that Ising machines\ncan be realized using almost any nonlinear self-sustaining oscillators with\nlogic values encoded in their phases. Many types of such oscillators are\nreadily available for large-scale integration, with potentials in high-speed\nand low-power operation. In this paper, we describe the operation and mechanism\nof oscillator-based Ising machines. The feasibility of our scheme is\ndemonstrated through several examples in simulation and hardware, among which a\nsimulation study reports average solutions exceeding those from state-of-art\nIsing machines on a benchmark combinatorial optimization problem of size 2000.\n", "  On August 14, 2017 at 10:30:43 UTC, the Advanced Virgo detector and the two\nAdvanced LIGO detectors coherently observed a transient gravitational-wave\nsignal produced by the coalescence of two stellar mass black holes, with a\nfalse-alarm-rate of $\\lesssim$ 1 in 27000 years. The signal was observed with a\nthree-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred\nmasses of the initial black holes are $30.5_{-3.0}^{+5.7}$ Msun and\n$25.3_{-4.2}^{+2.8}$ Msun (at the 90% credible level). The luminosity distance\nof the source is $540_{-210}^{+130}~\\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to a redshift\nof $z=0.11_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. A network of three detectors improves the sky\nlocalization of the source, reducing the area of the 90% credible region from\n1160 deg$^2$ using only the two LIGO detectors to 60 deg$^2$ using all three\ndetectors. For the first time, we can test the nature of gravitational wave\npolarizations from the antenna response of the LIGO-Virgo network, thus\nenabling a new class of phenomenological tests of gravity.\n", "  Background: The ($\\alpha$,n) and ($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$) reactions on $^{17,18}$O\nhave significant impact on the neutron balance in the astrophysical\n$s$-process. In this scenario stellar reaction rates are required for\nrelatively low temperatures below $T_9 \\lesssim 1$.\n  Purpose: The uncertainties of the $^{17,18}$O($\\alpha$,n)$^{20,21}$Ne\nreactions are investigated. Statistical model calculations are performed to\nstudy the applicability of this model for relatively light nuclei in extension\nto a recent review for the $20 \\le A \\le 50$ mass range.\n  Method: The available experimental data for the\n$^{17,18}$O($\\alpha$,n)$^{20,21}$Ne reactions are compared to statistical model\ncalculations. Additionally, the reverse $^{20}$Ne(n,$\\alpha$)$^{17}$O reaction\nis investigated, and similar studies for the $^{17}$F mirror nucleus are\nprovided.\n  Results: It is found that on average the available experimental data for\n$^{17}$O and $^{18}$O are well described within the statistical model,\nresulting in reliable reaction rates above $T_9 \\gtrsim 1.5$ from these\ncalculations. However, significant experimental uncertainties are identified\nfor the $^{17}$O($\\alpha$,n$_0$)$^{20}$Ne(g.s.) channel.\n  Conclusions: The statistical model is able to predict astrophysical reaction\nrates for temperatures above 1 GK with uncertainties of less than a factor of\ntwo for the nuclei under study. An experimental discrepancy for the\n$^{17}$O($\\alpha$,n)$^{20}$Ne reaction needs to be resolved.\n", "  We investigate star formation occurring in idealised giant molecular clouds,\ncomparing structures that evolve in isolation versus those undergoing a\ncollision. Two different collision speeds are investigated and the impact of\nphotoionising radiation from the stars is determined. We find that a colliding\nsystem leads to more massive star formation both with and without the addition\nof feedback, raising overall star formation efficiencies (SFE) by a factor of\n10 and steepening the high-mass end of the stellar mass function. This rise in\nSFE is due to increased turbulent compression during the cloud collision. While\nfeedback can both promote and hinder star formation in the isolated system, it\nincreases the SFE by approximately 1.5 times in the colliding case when the\nthermal speed of the resulting HII regions matches the shock propagation speed\nin the collision.\n", "  Geometric quantum discord with Bures distance, a kind of correlations in\ngeometric point of view, is defined as the minimal Bures distance between the\nquantum state and the set of zero-discord states in bipartite quantum system.\nComparing to other geometric distance, Bures distance is monotonous and\nRiemannian and the minimal Bures distance to zero-discord states satisfies all\ncriteria of an discord measure. Furthermore, Bures geometric quantum discord is\nclosely linked to a minimal error quantum state discrimination. So far,\ngeometric quantum discord with Bures distance has been calculated explicitly\nonly for a rather limited set of two-qubit quantum states and expression for\nmore general quantum states are unkown. In this paper, we derive explicit\nexpression for Bures geometric quantum discord and classical correlation,\ntogether with all closest zero-discord states and closest product state for a\nfive-parameter family of states. For general X-states, a seven-parameter family\nof that have been of interest in a variety of contexts in the field, we not\nonly calculate the Bures geometric quantum discord for a wide class of this\nkind of states, but also provide a analytic upper bound for entirety.\n", "  We use helium released during mechanical deformation of shales as a signal to\nexplore the effects of deformation and failure on material transport\nproperties. A dynamic dual-permeability model with evolving pore and fracture\nnetworks is used to simulate gases released from shale during deformation and\nfailure. Changes in material properties required to reproduce experimentally\nobserved gas signals are explored. We model two different experiments of $^4$He\nflow rate measured from shale undergoing mechanical deformation, a core\nparallel to bedding and a core perpendicular to bedding. We find that the\nhelium signal is sensitive to fracture development and evolution as well as\nchanges in the matrix transport properties. We constrain the timing and\neffective fracture aperture, as well as the increase in matrix porosity and\npermeability. Increases in matrix permeability are required to explain gas flow\nprior to macroscopic failure, and the short-term gas flow post failure.\nIncreased matrix porosity, is required to match the long-term, post-failure gas\nflow. Our model provides the first quantitative interpretation of helium\nrelease as a result of mechanical deformation. The sensitivity of this model to\nchanges in the fracture network, as well as to matrix properties during\ndeformation, indicates that helium release can be used as a quantitative tool\nto evaluate the state of stress and strain in earth materials.\n", "  In this work, we investigate an original strategy in order to derive a\nstatistical modeling of the interface in gas-liquid two-phase flows through\ngeometrical variables. The con- tribution is two-fold. First it participates in\nthe theoretical design of a unified reduced- order model for the description of\ntwo regimes: a disperse phase in a carrier fluid and two separated phases. The\nfirst idea is to propose a statistical description of the in- terface relying\non geometrical properties such as the mean and Gauss curvatures and define a\nSurface Density Function (SDF). The second main idea consists in using such a\nformalism in the disperse case, where a clear link is proposed between local\nstatistics of the interface and the statistics on objects, such as the number\ndensity function in Williams-Boltzmann equation for droplets. This makes\nessential the use of topolog- ical invariants in geometry through the\nGauss-Bonnet formula and allows to include the works conducted on sprays of\nspherical droplets. It yields a statistical treatment of populations of\nnon-spherical objects such as ligaments, as long as they are home- omorphic to\na sphere. Second, it provides an original angle and algorithm in order to build\nstatistics from DNS data of interfacial flows. From the theoretical approach,\nwe identify a kernel for the spatial averaging of geometrical quantities\npreserving the topological invariants. Coupled to a new algorithm for the\nevaluation of curvatures and surface that preserves these invariants, we\nanalyze two sets of DNS results conducted with the ARCHER code from CORIA with\nand without topological changes and assess the approach.\n", "  The formation of regular patterns is a common feature of many solidification\nprocesses involving cast materials. We describe here how regular patterns can\nbe obtained in porous alumina by controlling the freezing of ceramic slurries\nfollowed by subsequent ice sublimation and sintering, leading to multilayered\nporous alumina structures with homogeneous and well-defined architecture. We\ndiscuss the relationships between the experimental results, the physics of ice\nand the interaction between inert particles and the solidification front during\ndirectional freezing. The anisotropic interface kinetics of ice leads to\nnumerous specific morphologies features in the structure. The structures\nobtained here could have numerous applications including ceramic filters,\nbiomaterials, and could be the basis for dense multilayered composites after\ninfiltration with a selected second phase.\n", "  We show that Jet Energy Correlation variables can be used effectively to\ndiscover and distinguish a wide variety of boosted light dijet resonances at\nthe LHC through sensitivity to their transverse momentum and color structures.\n", "  One-dimensional topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes (MZMs),\nthe non-local property of which could be exploited for quantum computing\napplications. Spin- polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show\nthat MZMs realized in self- assembled Fe chains on the surface of Pb have a\nspin polarization that exceeds that due to the magnetism of these chains. This\nfeature, captured by our model calculations, is a direct consequence of the\nnonlocality of the Hilbert space of MZMs emerging from a topological band\nstructure. Our study establishes spin polarization measurements as a diagnostic\ntool to uniquely distinguish topological MZMs from trivial in-gap states of a\nsuperconductor.\n", "  From our recent catalog based on the first Gaia data release (TGAS), we\nselect wide binaries in which both stars have been observed by the Radial\nVelocity Experiment (RAVE) or the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre\nSpectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Using RAVE and LAMOST metallicities and RAVE\nMg, Al, Si, Ti, and Fe abundances, we find that the differences in the\nmetallicities and elemental abundances of components of wide binaries are\nconsistent with being due to observational uncertainties, in agreement with\nprevious results for smaller and more restricted samples. The metallicity and\nelemental abundance consistency between wide binary components presented in\nthis work confirms their common origin and bolsters the status of wide binaries\nas \"mini-open clusters.\" Furthermore, this is evidence that wide binaries are\neffectively co-eval and co-chemical, supporting their use for e.g.,\nconstraining age-activity-rotation relations, the initial-final mass relation\nfor white dwarfs, and M-dwarf metallicity indicators. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that the common proper motion, common parallax pairs in TGAS with\nthe most extreme separations (s $\\gtrsim$ 0.1 pc) typically have inconsistent\nmetallicities, radial velocities or both and are therefore likely to be\npredominantly comprised of random alignments of unassociated stars with similar\nastrometry, in agreement with our previous results. Finally, we propose that\nwide binaries form an ideal data set with which to test chemical tagging as a\nmethod to identify stars of common origin, particularly because the stars in\nwide binaries span a wide range of metallicities, much wider than that spanned\nby nearby open clusters.\n", "  Solar energy conversion to produce electricity using photovoltaics is an\nemerging area in alternative energy research. Herein, we report on the basis of\ndensity functional calculations, phosphorene/AsP heterostructure could be a\npromising material for excitonic solar cells (XSCs). Our HSE06 functional\ncalculations show that the band gap of both phosphorene and AsP fall exactly\ninto the optimum value range according to XSCs requirement. The calculated\neffective mass of electrons and holes show anisotropic in nature with effective\nmasses along ${\\Gamma}$-X direction is lower than the ${\\Gamma}$-Y direction\nand hence the charge transport will be faster along ${\\Gamma}$-X direction. The\nwide energy range of light absorption confirms the potential use of these\nmaterials for solar cell applications. Interestingly, phosphorene and AsP\nmonolayer forms a type-II band alignment which will enhance the separation of\nphotogenerated charge carriers and hence the recombination rate will be lower\nwhich can further improve its photo-conversion efficiency if one use it in\nXSCs.\n", "  Mass loss is a crucial component in stellar evolution models, since it\nlargely determines the rate of evolution at the later stages of a star's life.\nThe dust-driven outflows from AGB stars are particularly important in this\nregard. Including AGB dust formation in a stellar evolution model does also\nrequire a model of these outflows. Since AGB stars exhibit large-amplitude\npulsation, a model based on time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) is\nneeded in order to capture all the important physical aspects of dust\nformation. However, this cannot be afforded in a stellar evolution model. Here,\na mean-flow model is presented, which include corrections to the steady-state\nmodel currently being used in AGB evolution models with dust formation.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that massive primordial black holes (PBH) could\nconstitute all of the dark matter, providing a novel scenario of structure\nformation, with early reionization and a rapid growth of the massive black\nholes at the center of galaxies and dark matter halos. The scenario arises from\nbroad peaks in the primordial power spectrum that give both a spatially\nclustered and an extended mass distribution of PBH. The constraints from the\nobserved microlensing events on the extended mass function have already been\naddressed. Here we study the impact of spatial clustering on the microlensing\nconstraints. We find that the bounds can be relaxed significantly for\nrelatively broad mass distributions if the number of primordial black holes\nwithin each cluster is typically above one hundred. On the other hand, even if\nthey arise from individual black holes within the cluster, the bounds from CMB\nanisotropies are less stringent due to the enhanced black hole velocity in such\ndense clusters. This way, the window between a few and ten solar masses has\nopened up for PBH to comprise the totality of the dark matter.\n", "  In the next few years the classification of radio sources observed by the\nlarge surveys will be a challenging problem, and spectral index is a powerful\ntool for addressing it. Here we present an algorithm to estimate the spectral\nindex of sources from multiwavelength radio images. We have applied our\nalgorithm to SCORPIO (Umana et al. 2015), a Galactic Plane survey centred\naround 2.1 GHz carried out with ATCA, and found we can measure reliable\nspectral indices only for sources stronger than 40 times the rms noise. Above a\nthreshold of 1 mJy, the source density in SCORPIO is 20 percent greater than in\na typical extra-galactic field, like ATLAS (Norris et al. 2006), because of the\npresence of Galactic sources. Among this excess population, 16 sources per\nsquare degree have a spectral index of about zero, suggesting optically thin\nthermal emission such as Hii regions and planetary nebulae, while 12 per square\ndegree present a rising spectrum, suggesting optically thick thermal emission\nsuch as stars and UCHii regions.\n", "  There are at least three sources of cosmic quarks in the universe. One, the\nquark nuggets which may survive beyond a certain baryon number during the phase\ntransition from quarks to hadrons microseconds after the big bang. These quark\nnuggets can very well be candidate of cold dark matter and these nuggets\nconsist of strange quarks. Second, the interior of the neutron star may well be\nmade of quarks due to very very high pressure. It is further shown that the\ninterior of heavy neutron star, recently discovered $\\approx$ 2M$_{\\odot}$,\nwith an appropriate equation of state, can also be made of quark core. Finally,\nusing the property of colour entanglement among quarks it is entirely possible\nto have free orphan quarks roaming around in the cosmos. Some better\nunderstanding of dark energy and dark matter is possible with these entangled\norphan quarks.\n", "  An overview of recent ALICE results aimed to understand collective phenomena\nin Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC is presented. These include the centrality\ndependence of the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) distributions of charged\npions, kaons, and protons as well as results on anisotropic flow using data\nfrom Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV. In addition,\ncomparisons between data and model predictions are presented.\n", "  In most macro-scale robotics systems , propulsion and controls are enabled\nthrough a physical tether or complex on-board electronics and batteries. A\ntether simplifies the design process but limits the range of motion of the\nrobot, while on-board controls and power supplies are heavy and complicate the\ndesign process. Here we present a simple design principle for an untethered,\nentirely soft, swimming robot with the ability to achieve preprogrammed,\ndirectional propulsion without a battery or on-board electronics. Locomotion is\nachieved by employing actuators that harness the large displacements of\nbistable elements, triggered by surrounding temperature changes. Powered by\nshape memory polymer (SMP) muscles, the bistable elements in turn actuates the\nrobot's fins. Our robots are fabricated entirely using a commercially available\n3D printer with no post-processing. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the\nability to program a vessel, which can autonomously deliver a cargo and\nnavigate back to the deployment point.\n", "  We study the autonomous system for a scalar-tensor model of dark energy with\nGauss-Bonnet and non-minimal couplings. The critical points describe important\nstable asymptotic scenarios including quintessence, phantom and de Sitter\nattractor solutions. Two functional forms for the coupling functions and the\nscalar potential were considered: power-law and exponential functions of the\nscalar field. For the exponential functions the existence of stable\nquintessence, phantom or de Sitter solutions, allows an asymptotic behavior\nwhere the effective Newtonian coupling becomes constant. The phantom solutions\ncould be realized without appealing to ghost degrees of freedom. Transient\ninflationary and radiation dominated phases can also be described.\n", "  Taking advantages of ultra-narrow bandwidth and high noise rejection\nperformance of the Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF),\nsimultaneously with the coherent amplification of atomic stimulated emission, a\nstimulated amplified Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (SAFADOF) at\ncesium 1470 nm is realized. The SAFADOF is able to significantly amplify very\nweak laser signals and reject noise in order to obtain clean signals in strong\nbackground. Experiment results show that, for a weak signal of 50 pW, the gain\nfactor can be larger than 25000 (44 dB) within a bandwidth as narrow as 13 MHz.\nHaving this ability to amplify weak signals with low background contribution,\nthe SAFADOF finds outstanding potential applications in weak signal detections.\n", "  In this article we study two classical linear water wave problems, i) normal\nmodes of infinite straight channels of bounded constant cross-section, and ii)\ntrapped longitudinal modes in domains with unbounded constant cross-section.\nBoth problems can be stated using linearized free surface potential flow\ntheory, and our goal is to compare known analytic solutions in the literature\nto numerical solutions obtained using an ad-hoc but simple approximation of the\nnon-local Dirichlet-Neumann operator for linear waves proposed in\n[vargas2016whitham]. To study normal modes in channels with bounded\ncross-section we consider special symmetric triangular cross-sections, namely\nsymmetric triangles with sides inclined at $45^{\\circ}$ and $60^{\\circ}$ to the\nvertical, and compare modes obtained using the non-local Dirichlet-Neumann\noperator to known semi-exact analytic expressions by Lamb\n[lamb1932hydrodynamics], Macdonald [macdonald1893waves] , Greenhill\n[greenhill1887wave], Packham [packham1980small], and Groves\n[groves1994hamiltonian]. These geometries have slopping beach boundaries that\nshould in principle limit the applicability of our approximate\nDirichlet-Neumann operator. We nevertheless see that the operator gives\nremarkably close results for even modes, while for odd modes we have some\ndiscrepancies near the boundary. For trapped longitudinal modes in domains with\nan infinite cross-section we consider a piecewise constant depth profile and\ncompare modes computed with the nonlocal operator modes to known analytic\nsolutions of linearized shallow water theory by Miles [miles1972wave], Lin,\nJuang and Tsay [lin2001anomalous], see also [mei2005theory]. This is a problem\nof significant geophysical interest, and the proposed model is shows to give\nquantitatively similar results for the lowest trapped modes.\n", "  Bismuth and Nickel transparent oxides thin films were grown on glass and\nflexible polythelene terephalate (PET) substrates by DC sputtering technique at\nroom temperature 300 K. The structures of Bi2O3 and NiO films were analyzed by\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A\nprofilometry is used to measure the thicknesses of the ultrathin films. These\nvalues were established by a spectro-ellipsometry technique with a new\namorphous dispersion model in the range of 200 nm to 2200 nm with one nm\nincrement. In addition, the optical constants of these films were investigated\nusing a double beam UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer and a spectro-ellipsometry and\ncompared using the same wavelength range. They present an excellent agreement.\nAccording to the optical transmittance spectra of the films a high average\ntransmittance in the visible region of each sample deposited onto different\nsubstrates is measured. Moreover, the absorption coefficients and the optical\nenergy gaps for four types of optical transitions (allowed direct, forbidden\ndirect, allowed indirect, forbidden indirect) of the films were determined and\ncompared with the two different techniques. Finally, the nature of the\nstructure and morphology of Bi2O3 and NiO ultrathin films has been analyzed and\ncompared.\n", "  KAGRA is a 3-km interferometric gravitational wave telescope located in the\nKamioka mine in Japan. It is the first km-class gravitational wave telescope\nconstructed underground to reduce seismic noise, and the first km-class\ntelescope to use cryogenic cooling of test masses to reduce thermal noise. The\nconstruction of the infrastructure to house the interferometer in the tunnel,\nand the initial phase operation of the interferometer with a simple 3-km\nMichelson configuration have been completed. The first cryogenic operation is\nexpected in 2018, and the observing runs with a full interferometer are\nexpected in 2020s. The basic interferometer configuration and the current\nstatus of KAGRA are described.\n", "  AG Draconis is a bright symbiotic binary consisting of a white dwarf and a\npulsating cool giant. Moreover, it is the most intense X-ray source among\nsymbiotic stars, and one of the best representatives of the super-soft X-ray\nobjects. The system undergoes characteristic symbiotic activity with\nalternating quiescent and active stages. The active ones consist of several\noutbursts repeating at about a one-year interval. The recent activity stage of\nAG Dra began with the weak pre-outburst in 2015 followed by a more prominent\noutburst in 2016. According to photometric and some spectroscopic observations,\nboth brightenings belong to the minor (hot) outbursts of AG Dra. Such behavior\nof the active stage is quite unusual because more often, the activity of AG Dra\nstarts with a major (cool) outburst. Moreover, the behavior of Raman scattered\nOVI lines at {\\lambda} 6825 {\\AA} and {\\lambda} 7082 {\\AA} suggest that the\nminor outburst of AG Dra in April 2016 has the characteristics of both the hot\nand cool outbursts. Based on the above, an open question is the next evolution\nof activity of the symbiotic binary AG Dra in 2017 and beyond.\n", "  The possibility of tailoring the guidance properties of optical fibers along\nthe same direction as the evolution of the optical field allows to explore new\ndirections in nonlinear fiber optics. The new degree of freedom offered by\naxially-varying optical fibers enables to revisit well-established nonlinear\nphenomena, and even to discover novel short pulse nonlinear dynamics. Here we\nstudy the impact of meter-scale longitudinal variations of group velocity\ndispersion on the propagation of bright solitons and on their associated\ndispersive waves. We show that the longitudinal tailoring of fiber properties\nallows to observe experimentally unique dispersive waves dynamics, such as the\nemission of cascaded, multiple or polychromatic dispersive waves.\n", "  We present an innovative approach to the synthesis of linear arrays having\nthe least possible number of elements while radiating shaped beams lying in\ncompletely arbitrary power masks. The approach, based on theory and procedures\nlend from Compressive Sensing, has two innovative key features. First, it\nexploits at best the multiplicity of equivalent field solutions corresponding\nto the many different power patterns lying in the given mask. Second, it\na-priori optimizes those parameters that affect the performance of Compressive\nSensing. The overall problem is formulated as two convex programming routines\nplus one local optimization, with the inherent advantages in terms of\ncomputational time and solutions optimality. An extensive numerical comparison\nagainst state-of-the-art procedures proves the effectiveness of the approach.\n", "  FLASH and the European XFEL are SASE-FEL user facilities, at which\nsuperconducting TESLA cavities are operated in a pulsed mode to accelerate long\nbunch-trains. Several cavities are powered by one klystron. While the low-level\nrf system is able to stabilize the vector sum of the accelerating gradient of\none rf station sufficiently, the rf parameters of individual cavities vary\nwithin the bunch-train. In correlation with misalignments, intrabunch-train\ntrajectory variations are induced. An efficient model is developed to describe\nthe effect at low beam energy, using numerically adjusted transfer matrices and\ndiscrete coupler kick coefficients, respectively. Comparison with start-to-end\ntracking and dedicated experiments at the FLASH injector will be shown. The\nshort computation time of the derived model allows for comprehensive numerical\nstudies on the impact of misalignments and variable rf parameters on the\ntransverse intra-bunch-train beam stability at the injector module. Results\nfrom both, statistical multibunch performance studies and the deduction of\nmisalignments from multibunch experiments are presented.\n", "  In a recent article [Chin. Phys. Lett. 34, 020301 (2017)], Ben-Israel et al.\nhave claimed that the experiment proposed in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 32, 050303\n(2015)] to determine the past of a quantum particle in a nested Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer does not work, and they have proposed a modification to the\nexperiment. We show that their claim is false, and the modification is not\nrequired.\n", "  We give an exhaustive characterization of the topology of band structures in\nclass AI, using nonsymmorphic space group 33 ($Pna2_1$) as a representative\nexample where a great variety of symmetry protected line-nodal structures can\nbe formed. We start with the topological classification of all line-nodal\nstructures given through the combinatorics of valence irreducible\nrepresentations (IRREPs) at a few high-symmetry points (HSPs) at a fixed\nfilling. We decompose the total topology of nodal valence band bundles through\nthe local topology of elementary (i.e. inseparable) nodal structures and the\nglobal topology that constrains distinct elementary nodal elements over the\nBrillouin zone (BZ). Generalizing from the cases of simple point nodes and\nsimple nodal lines (NLs), we argue that the local topology of every elementary\nnodal structure is characterized by a set of poloidal-toroidal charges, one\nmonopole, and one thread charge (when threading the BZ torus), while the global\ntopology only allows pairs of nontrivial monopole and thread charges. We show\nthat all these charges are given in terms of symmetry protected topological\ninvariants, defined through quantized Wilson loop phases over symmetry\nconstrained momentum loops, which we derive entirely algebraically from the\nvalence IRREPs at the HSPs. In particular, we find highly connected line-nodal\nstructures, line-nodal monopole pairs, and line-nodal thread pairs, that are\nall protected by the unitary crystalline symmetries only. Furthermore, we show\nsymmetry preserving topological Lifshitz transitions through which independent\nNLs can be connected, disconnected, or linked. Our work constitutes a heuristic\napproach to the systematic topological classification and characterization of\nall momentum space line-nodal structures protected by space group symmetries in\nclass AI.\n", "  Realization of fast fault-tolerant quantum gates on a single spin is the core\nrequirement for solid-state quantum-information processing. As polarized light\nshows geometric interference, spin coherence is also geometrically controlled\nwith light via the spin-orbit interaction. Here, we show that a geometric spin\nin a degenerate subspace of a spin-1 electronic system under a zero field in a\nnitrogen vacancy center in diamond allows implementation of optical\nnon-adiabatic holonomic quantum gates. The geometric spin under quasi-resonant\nlight exposure undergoes a cyclic evolution in the spin-orbit space, and\nacquires a geometric phase or holonomy that results in rotations about an\narbitrary axis by any angle defined by the light polarization and detuning.\nThis enables universal holonomic quantum gates with a single operation. We\ndemonstrate a complete set of Pauli quantum gates using the geometric spin\npreparation and readout techniques. The new scheme opens a path to holonomic\nquantum computers and repeaters.\n", "  A hierarchical scheme for clustering data is presented which applies to\nspaces with a high number of dimension ($N_{_{D}}>3$). The data set is first\nreduced to a smaller set of partitions (multi-dimensional bins). Multiple\nclustering techniques are used, including spectral clustering, however, new\ntechniques are also introduced based on the path length between partitions that\nare connected to one another. A Line-Of-Sight algorithm is also developed for\nclustering. A test bank of 12 data sets with varying properties is used to\nexpose the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Finally, a robust\nclustering technique is discussed based on reaching a consensus among the\nmultiple approaches, overcoming the weaknesses found individually.\n", "  The most recent results of Standard Model physics using 8 and 13 TeV\nproton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector during the LHC Runs I\nand II are reviewed. This overview includes studies of several results of\nvector boson production in association with jets. The outlined results are\ncompared to the corresponding theoretical predictions and no significant\ndeviation is observed.\n", "  In the present work, we examine the potential robustness of extreme wave\nevents associated with large amplitude fluctuations of the Peregrine soliton\ntype, upon departure from the integrable analogue of the discrete nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (DNLS) equation, namely the Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) model. Our model\nof choice will be the so-called Salerno model, which interpolates between the\nAL and the DNLS models. We find that rogue wave events essentially are\ndrastically distorted even for very slight perturbations of the homotopic\nparameter connecting the two models off of the integrable limit. Our results\nsuggest that the Peregrine soliton structure is a rather sensitive feature of\nthe integrable limit, which may not persist under \"generic\" perturbations of\nthe limiting integrable case.\n", "  Froissart Bound implies that the total proton-proton cross-section (or\nequivalently structure function) cannot rise faster than the logarithmic growth\n$\\log^2 s \\sim \\log^2 (1/x)$, where \\textit{s} is the square of the center of\nmass energy and \\textit{x} is the Bjorken variable. In the present report,\ncompatibility of such behavior will be shown in case of Transverse Momentum\nDependent Parton Distributions Functions (TMDPDF) or TMDs for the model of\nproton based on self-similarity.\n", "  Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria are described by the self-consistent solutions of\nthe time-independent Maxwell equations for the real-space dynamics of\nelectromagnetic fields, and the Vlasov equation for the phase-space dynamics of\nparticle distributions in a collisionless plasma. These two systems\n(macroscopic and microscopic) are coupled via the source terms in Maxwell's\nequations, which are sums of velocity-space 'moment' integrals of the particle\ndistribution function. This paper considers 'the inverse problem for\ncollisionless equilibria' (IPCE), viz. \"given information regarding the\nreal-space/macroscopic configuration of a specific collisionless plasma\nequilibrium, what self-consistent equilibrium distributions exist?\" We develop\nthe constants of motion approach to IPCE using the assumptions of a 'modified\nMaxwellian' distribution function, and a strictly neutral and spatially\none-dimensional plasma. In such circumstances, IPCE formally reduces to the\ninversion of Weierstrass transformations (Bilodeau, 1962), such as those\ntransformations that feature in the initial value problem for the\nheat/diffusion equation. We discuss the various mathematical conditions that a\ncandidate solution of IPCE must satisfy. One method that can be used to invert\nthe Weierstrass transform is expansions in Hermite polynomials. Building on the\nresults of Allanson et al. (2016), we establish under what circumstances a\nsolution obtained by these means converges, and allows velocity moments of all\norders. Ever since the seminal work by Bernstein et al. (1957), on 'stationary'\nelectrostatic plasma waves, the necessary quality of non-negativity has been\nnoted as a feature that any candidate solution of IPCE will not $\\textit{a\npriori}$ satisfy. We also discuss this problem in the context of for our\nformalism, for magnetised plasmas.\n", "  The tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation of zirconia has been the\nsubject of extensive studies over the last 20 years [1-4]. The main features of\nthe transformation have been identified and its martensitic nature is now\nwidely recognised [5-8]. More specifically, the relevance of a nucleation and\ngrowth model to describe the transformation is widely accepted. Recent fracture\nepisodes [9] of zirconia hip joint heads were reported, failures related to the\nt-m transformation degradation. Among the materials solutions considered for\ndecreasing the sensitivity to t-m phase transformation, the possibility of\nadding silica as a dopant appears as an appealing one. Previous studies have\nrevealed the beneficial effect of silica addition by the formation of a glassy\nphase at the grain boundaries and triple points. This glassy phase has been\nproven to reduce the residual stresses level [10], slowing down the\ntransformation kinetics. Preliminary quantitative investigations by XRD have\nshown these materials are less susceptible to transformation. However, the\nmechanism by which the transformation propagated has still to be assessed.\n", "  We demonstrate in this paper that atomic force microscopy can be successfully\nused to gain further insights into the understanding of transformation\ntoughening in ceria stabilized zirconia. Transformation was induced by stresses\naccumulated in the region surrounding propagating cracks in double torsion\nsamples. The resolution provided by AFM at the surface of the samples made it\npossible to observe the formation of self accommodated martensite pairs in the\nnear crack areas. The potential for transformation is found to decrease with\nincreasing alloying addition, and is totally suppressed for 16 mol.% CeO2-TZP\nsamples. A statistical analysis of the martensite pair orientation is\nperformed, and the relationship with the applied stress and strain fields is\ndiscussed. The contribution to transformation toughening by\ntransformation-induced plasticity occurring in the formation of martensitic\nvariant pairs with small net shear is demonstrated. The influence of alloying\naddition content on the potential for transformation toughening and fracture\ntoughness values is finally discussed.\n", "  The low temperature autoclave aging behavior of zirconia toughened alumina\ncomposites processed by a classical powder mixing processing route was analyzed\nusing atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy and X-Ray\ndiffraction. The transformation was evaluated in terms of nucleation and\ngrowth, assessed by XRD. The time-temperature equivalency of the transformation\nwas used to measure an apparent activation energy of the nucleation stage of\nthe transformation of 78kJ/mol. The microstructural features influencing the\ntransformation were identified, and the influence of the alumina matrix on the\ntransformation was investigated. Transformation progression grain by grain was\nobserved by AFM. Transformation does not only occur in zirconia agglomerates\nbut also in isolated zirconia grains. The matrix could partially inhibit the\ntransformation. This behavior could be rationalized considering the\nconstraining effect of the alumina matrix, shape strain accommodation arguments\nand microstructural homogeneity effects.\n", "  This paper investigates the behaviour of colloidal suspensions of alumina\nparticles during directional solidification, by in situ high-resolution\nobservations using X-ray radiography and tomography. This second part is\nfocussed on the evolution of ice crystals during steady state growth (in terms\nof interface velocity) and on the particles redistribution taking place in this\nregime. In particular, it is shown that diffusion cannot determine the\nconcentration profile and the particles redistribution in this regime of\ninterface velocities (20-40 microns/s); constitutional supercooling arguments\ncannot be invoked to interpret particles redistribution. Particles are\nredistributed by a direct interaction with the moving solidification interface.\nSeveral parameters controlling the particles redistribution were identified,\nnamely the interface velocity, the particle size, the shape of the ice crystals\nand the orientation relationships between the crystals and the temperature\ngradient.\n", "  The relationship between the microstructure of a porous medium and the\nobserved flow distribution is still a puzzle. We resolve it with an analytical\nmodel, where the local correlations between adjacent pores, which determine the\ndistribution of flows propagated from one pore downstream, predict the flow\ndistribution. Numerical simulations of a two-dimensional porous medium verify\nthe model and clearly show the transition of flow distributions from\n$\\delta$-function-like via Gaussians to exponential with increasing disorder.\nComparison to experimental data further verifies our numerical approach.\n", "  This paper investigates by in situ high-resolution X-ray radiography and\ntomography the behaviour of colloidal suspensions of alumina particles during\ndirectional solidification by freezing. The combination of these techniques\nprovided both qualitative and quantitative information about the propagation\nkinetic of the solid/liquid interface, the particles redistribution between the\ncrystals and a particle enriched phase and the 3D organisation of the ice\ncrystals. In this first part of two companion papers, the precursor phenomena\nleading to directional crystallisation during the first instants of\nsolidification is studied. Mullins-Sekerka instabilities are not necessary to\nexplain the dynamic evolution of the interface pattern. Particle redistribution\nduring these first instants is dependent on the type of crystals growing into\nthe suspension. The insights gained into the mechanisms of solidification of\ncolloidal suspensions may be valuable for the materials processing routes\nderived for this type of directional solidification (freeze-casting), and of\ngeneral interest for those interested in the interactions between\nsolidification fronts and inert particles.\n", "  We explore a combinatorial framework which efficiently quantifies the\nasymmetries between minima and maxima in local fluctuations of time series. We\nfirstly showcase its performance by applying it to a battery of synthetic\ncases. We find rigorous results on some canonical dynamical models (stochastic\nprocesses with and without correlations, chaotic processes) complemented by\nextensive numerical simulations for a range of processes which indicate that\nthe methodology correctly distinguishes different complex dynamics and\noutperforms state of the art metrics in several cases. Subsequently, we apply\nthis methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines\nincluding cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science. We conclude that\ndifferences between the statistics of local maxima and local minima in time\nseries are highly informative of the complex underlying dynamics and a\ngraph-theoretic extraction procedure allows to use these features for\nstatistical learning purposes.\n", "  This is an extension of our recent work on $D^+(c\\bar{d}),D^o(c\\bar{u})$\nproduction from p-p and d-Au collisions to $B^+(b\\bar{d}),B^o(b\\bar{u})$\nproduction from p-p and A-A collisions. The rapidity cross sections for\n$B^+(c\\bar{d}),B^o(b\\bar{u})$ production from both p-p and A-A collisions are\nestimated. Our present work makes use of previous work on $J/\\Psi$,\n$\\Psi'(2S)$, $\\Upsilon(nS)$ production in p-p and A-A collisions, with the main\nnew aspect being the fragmentation probability, $D_{b \\rightarrow b\\bar{q}}$,\nwhich turns out to be similar to the fragmentation probability $D_{c\n\\rightarrow c\\bar{q}}$ used in our recent work.\n", "  A simple and self-consistent approach has been proposed for simulation of the\nproton-induced soft error rate based on the heavy ion induced single event\nupset cross-section data and vice versa. The approach relies on the GEANT4\nassisted Monte Carlo simulation of the secondary particle LET spectra produced\nby nuclear interactions. The method has been validated with the relevant\nin-flight soft error rate data for space protons and heavy ions. An approximate\nanalytical relation is proposed and validated for a fast recalculation between\nthe two types of experimental data.\n", "  We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian in a straight three dimensional waveguide\nwith non-rotationally invariant cross section, perturbed by a twisting of small\namplitude. It is well known that such a perturbation does not create\neigenvalues below the essential spectrum. However, around the bottom of the\nspectrum, we provide a meromorphic extension of the weighted resolvent of the\nperturbed operator, and show the existence of exactly one resonance near this\npoint. Moreover, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of this resonance as the\nsize of the twisting goes to 0. We also extend the analysis to the upper\neigenvalues of the transversal problem, showing that the number of resonances\nis bounded by the multiplicity of the eigenvalue and obtaining the\ncorresponding asymptotic behavior\n", "  Neutron diffraction on a triple-axis spectrometer and a small-angle neutron\nscattering instrument is used to study the magnetic phase transition in\ntetragonal Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$ at zero magnetic field. In addition to the\nincommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order, we establish\nthat weak incommensurate ferromagnetism (FM) also arises below the transition\ntemperature $T_N$ identified by sharp Bragg peaks close to the $\\Gamma$ point.\nThe intensities of both the incommensurate AFM and FM Bragg peaks vanish\nabruptly at $T_N$ indicative of a weak first-order transition. Above $T_N$,\nevidence is presented that the magnetic intensity within the tetragonal $(a,b)$\nplane is distributed on a ring in momentum space whose radius is determined by\nthe incommensurate wavevector of the cycloidal order. We speculate that the\nassociated soft fluctuations are at the origin of the weak first-order\ntransition in the spirit of a scenario proposed by Brazovskii.\n", "  The deep learning framework is witnessing expansive growth into diverse\napplications such as biological systems, human cognition, robotics, and the\nsocial sciences, thanks to its immense ability to extract essential features\nfrom complicated systems. In particular, recent developments of the field have\nrevealed the unique faculty of deep learning to accurately approximate complex\nphysical systems in fluid dynamics, condensed matter physics, etc. The\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is an efficient approach to represent\ncomplex systems with large degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN), as an unsupervised learning algorithm, is\ncapable of efficiently imitating the distribution of training data. Here we\nleverage this unique property of GAN, in conjunction with CNN methodology, to\nestablish an Ising simulator whose generator can produce Ising states given\ntemperature T around the criticality. The generated Ising states well resemble,\nand essentially replicate, the data from conventional Monte Carlo simulations.\nOur results demonstrate the universality of GAN as a promising tool in the\nfield of computational and statistical physics.\n", "  We present an extended study of inflationary models that inflaton field is\nnon-minimally coupled with gravity. We study parameters space of the models up\nto the second (and in some cases third) order of the slow-roll parameters for\nusual large field potentials in Jordan and Einstein frames that are connected\neach other by conformal transformation. We calculate inflationary parameters\nand the results are compared in both frames and also with observations. By\nusing the recent observational datasets, we present a discussion in order to\nclarify the physical frame between Jordan and Einstein frames. Also, some\nsuggestions are expressed in order to navigate us for the future works.\n", "  We briefly review the status of high precision QCD predictions available for\nLHC processes, focusing on corrections beyond NLO and ways to make the latter\navailable in a convenient format. As a phenomenological example we discuss the\ntwo-loop corrections to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion.\n", "  Quantum-chemical processes in liquid environments impact broad areas of\nscience, from molecular biology to geology to electrochemistry. While\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) has enabled efficient quantum-mechanical\ncalculations which profoundly impact understanding of atomic-scale phenomena,\nrealistic description of the liquid remains a challenge. Here, we present an\napproach based on joint density-functional theory (JDFT) which addresses this\nchallenge by leveraging the DFT approach not only for the quantum mechanics of\nthe electrons in a solute, but also simultaneously for the statistical\nmechanics of the molecules in a surrounding equilibrium liquid solvent.\nSpecifically, we develop a new universal description for the interaction of\nelectrons with an arbitrary liquid, providing the missing link to finally\ntransform JDFT into a practical tool for the realistic description of chemical\nprocesses in solution. This approach predicts accurate solvation free energies\nand surrounding atomic-scale liquid structure for molecules and surfaces in\nmultiple solvents without refitting, all at a fraction of the computational\ncost of methods of comparable detail and accuracy. To demonstrate the potential\nimpact of this method, we determine the structure of the solid/liquid\ninterface, offering compelling agreement with more accurate (but much more\ncomputationally intensive) theories and with X-ray reflectivity measurements.\n", "  We present analytical next-to-leading order results for the correlator of\nbaryonic currents at the three loop level with one finite mass quark. We obtain\nthe massless and the HQET limit of the correlator from the general formula as\nparticular cases. We also give explicit expressions for the moments of the\nspectral density.\n", "  Whether integrable, partially integrable or nonintegrable, nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) can be handled from scratch with essentially the\nsame toolbox, when one looks for analytic solutions in closed form. The basic\ntool is the appropriate use of the singularities of the solutions, and this can\nbe done without knowing these solutions in advance. Since the elaboration of\nthe \\textit{singular manifold method} by Weiss et al., many improvements have\nbeen made. After some basic recalls, we give an interpretation of the method\nallowing us to understand why and how it works. Next, we present the state of\nthe art of this powerful technique, trying as much as possible to make it a\n(computerizable) algorithm. Finally, we apply it to various PDEs in 1+1\ndimensions, mostly taken from physics, some of them chaotic: sine-Gordon,\nBoussinesq, Sawada-Kotera, Kaup-Kupershmidt, complex Ginzburg-Landau,\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky, etc.\n", "  This short review is an introduction to a great variety of methods, the\ncollection of which is called the Painlev\\'e analysis, intended at producing\nall kinds of exact (as opposed to perturbative) results on nonlinear equations,\nwhether ordinary, partial, or discrete.\n", "  We integrate with hyperelliptic functions a two-particle Hamiltonian with\nquartic potential and additionnal linear and nonpolynomial terms in the\nLiouville integrable cases 1:6:1 and 1:6:8.\n", "  A scaling invariance in the Lorenz model allows one to consider the usually\ndiscarded case sigma=0. We integrate it with the third Painlev\\'e function.\n", "  A few 2+1-dimensional equations belonging to the KP and modified KP\nhierarchies are shown to be sufficient to provide a unified picture of all the\nintegrable cases of the cubic and quartic H\\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonians.\n", "  Following the basic principles stated by Painlev\\'e, we first revisit the\nprocess of selecting the admissible time-independent Hamiltonians\n$H=(p_1^2+p_2^2)/2+V(q_1,q_2)$ whose some integer power $q_j^{n_j}(t)$ of the\ngeneral solution is a singlevalued function of the complex time $t$. In\naddition to the well known rational potentials $V$ of H\\'enon-Heiles, this\nselects possible cases with a trigonometric dependence of $V$ on $q_j$. Then,\nby establishing the relevant confluences, we restrict the question of the\nexplicit integration of the seven (three ``cubic'' plus four ``quartic'')\nrational H\\'enon-Heiles cases to the quartic cases. Finally, we perform the\nexplicit integration of the quartic cases, thus proving that the seven rational\ncases have a meromorphic general solution explicitly given by a genus two\nhyperelliptic function.\n", "  The Hirota equation is a higher order extension of the nonlinear Schroedinger\nequation by incorporating third order dispersion and one form of self\nsteepening effect. New periodic waves for the discrete Hirota equation are\ngiven in terms of elliptic functions. The continuum limit converges to the\nanalogous result for the continuous Hirota equation, while the long wave limit\nof these discrete periodic patterns reproduces the known result of the\nintegrable Ablowitz-Ladik system.\n", "  Most evolution equations %or wave equations are partially integrable and, in\norder to explicitly integrate all possible cases, there exist several methods\nof complex analysis, but none is optimal. The theory of Nevanlinna and\nWiman-Valiron on the growth of the meromorphic solutions gives predictions and\nbounds, but it is not constructive and restricted to meromorphic solutions. The\nPainleve' approach via the a priori singularities of the solutions gives no\nbounds but it is often (not always) constructive. It seems that an adequate\ncombination of the two methods could yield much more output in terms of\nexplicit (i.e. closed form) analytic solutions. We review this question, mainly\ntaking as an example the chaotic equation of Kuramoto and Sivashinsky nu u''' +\nb u'' + mu u' + u^2/2 +A=0, nu nonzero, with nu,b,mu,A constants.\n", "  The signaling apparatus mediating bacterial chemotaxis can adapt to a wide\nrange of persistent external stimuli. In many cases, the bacterial activity\nreturns to its pre-stimulus level exactly and this \"perfect adaptability\" is\nrobust against variations in various chemotaxis protein concentrations. We\nmodel the bacterial chemotaxis signaling pathway, from ligand binding to CheY\nphosphorylation. By solving the steady-state equations of the model\nanalytically, we derive a full set of conditions for the system to achieve\nperfect adaptation. The conditions related to the phosphorylation part of the\npathway are discovered for the first time, while other conditions are\ngeneralization of the ones found in previous works. Sensitivity of the perfect\nadaptation is evaluated by perturbing these conditions. We find that, even in\nthe absence of some of the perfect adaptation conditions, adaptation can be\nachieved with near perfect precision as a result of the separation of scales in\nboth chemotaxis protein concentrations and reaction rates, or specific\nproperties of the receptor distribution in different methylation states. Since\nnear perfect adaptation can be found in much larger regions of the parameter\nspace than that defined by the perfect adaptation conditions, their existence\nis essential to understand robustness in bacterial chemotaxis.\n"]}
