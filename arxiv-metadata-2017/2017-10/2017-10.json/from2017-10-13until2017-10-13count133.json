The method of construction is based on Kelvin's\ninvestigations into linearized disturbances in an unbounded Couette flow. We\nobtain explicit formulae for all three components of a Kelvin mode in terms of\nelementary functions. We then prove that Kelvin modes with parallel (though\ntime-dependent) wave vectors can be superposed to construct the most general\nplane transverse shearing wave. An explicit solution is given, with any\nspecified initial orientation, profile and polarization structure, with either\nunbounded or shear-periodic boundary conditions.\n", "  In this note we explicitly solve the Lindblad equation for a system of three\nspins with a three-body interaction, coupled to the environment by bath\noperators that inject or absorb spin carriers. We exemplify the properties of\nthis solution in the context of a simple instance of Feynman's quantum computer\nin which a two-qubit program line is executed, applying the $\\sqrt{NOT}$\nprimitive to a one-qubit register.\n", "  The transmission of an excitation along a spin chain can be hindered by the\npresence of small fixed imperfections that create trapping regions where the\nexcitation may get caught (Anderson localization). A certain degree of noise,\nensuing from the interaction with a thermal bath, allows to overcome\nlocalization (noise-assisted transport). In this paper we investigate the\nrelation between noise-assisted transport and (quantum) computation. In\nparticular we prove that noise does assist classical computation on a quantum\ncomputing device but hinders the possibility of creating entanglement.\n", "  We present a comparison of several modern C++ libraries providing high-level\ninterfaces for programming multi- and many-core architectures on top of CUDA or\nOpenCL. The comparison focuses on the solution of ordinary differential\nequations and is based on odeint, a framework for the solution of systems of\nordinary differential equations. Odeint is designed in a very flexible way and\nmay be easily adapted for effective use of libraries such as Thrust, MTL4,\nVexCL, or ViennaCL, using CUDA or OpenCL technologies. We found that CUDA and\nOpenCL work equally well for problems of large sizes, while OpenCL has higher\noverhead for smaller problems. Furthermore, we show that modern high-level\nlibraries allow to effectively use the computational resources of many-core\nGPUs or multi-core CPUs without much knowledge of the underlying technologies.\n", "  We apply specular and off-specular neutron reflection at the hydrophobic\nsilicon/water interface to check for evidence of nanoscopic air bubbles whose\npresence is claimed after an ad hoc procedure of solvent exchange. Nanobubbles\nand/or a depletion layer at the hydrophobic/water interface have long been\ndiscussed and generated a plethora of controversial scientific results. By\ncombining neutron reflectometry (NR), off-specular reflectometry (OSS) and\ngrazing incidence small angle neutron scattering (GISANS), we studied the\ninterface between hydrophobized silicon and heavy water before and after\nsaturation with nitrogen gas. Our specular reflectometry results can be\ninterpreted by assuming a sub-molecular sized depletion layer and the\noff-specular measurements show no change with nitrogen super saturated water.\nThis picture is consistent with the assumption that, following the solvent\nexchange, no additional nanobubbles are introduced at significant\nconcentrations (if present at all). Furthermore, we discuss the results, in\nterms of the maximum surface coverage of nanobubbles that could be present on\nthe hydrophobic surface compatibly with the sensitivity limit of these\ntechniques.\n", "  By means of the Boltzmann-Vlasov kinetic equation we investigate dynamical\nproperties of a trapped, one-component Fermi gas at zero temperature, featuring\nthe anisotropic and long-range dipole-dipole interaction. To this end, we\ndetermine an approximate solution by rescaling both space and momentum\nvariables of the equilibrium distribution, thereby obtaining coupled ordinary\ndifferential equations for the corresponding scaling parameters. Based on\nprevious results on how the Fermi sphere is deformed in the hydrodynamic regime\nof a dipolar Fermi gas, we are able to implement the relaxation-time\napproximation for the collision integral. Then, we proceed by linearizing the\nequations of motion around the equilibrium in order to study both the\nfrequencies and the damping of the low-lying excitation modes all the way from\nthe collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical results are\nexpected to be relevant for understanding current experiments with trapped\ndipolar Fermi gases.\n", "  We present a 2-local quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism GI based on an\nadiabatic protocol. By exploiting continuous-time quantum-walks, we are able to\navoid a mere diffusion over all possible configurations and to significantly\nreduce the dimensionality of the visited space. Within this restricted space,\nthe graph isomorphism problem can be translated into the search of a satisfying\nassignment to a 2-SAT formula without resorting to perturbation gadgets or\nprojective techniques. We present an analysis of the execution time of the\nalgorithm on small instances of the graph isomorphism problem and discuss the\nissue of an implementation of the proposed adiabatic scheme on current quantum\ncomputing hardware.\n", "  We investigate the particle and heat transport in quantum junctions with the\ngeometry of star graphs. The system is in a nonequilibrium steady state,\ncharacterized by the different temperatures and chemical potentials of the heat\nreservoirs connected to the edges of the graph. We explore the\nLandauer-Buettiker state and its orbit under parity and time reversal\ntransformations. Both particle number and total energy are conserved in these\nstates. However the heat and chemical potential energy are in general not\nseparately conserved, which gives origin to a basic process of energy\ntransmutation among them. We study both directions of this process in detail,\nintroducing appropriate efficiency coefficients. For scale invariant\ninteractions in the junction our results are exact and explicit. They cover the\nwhole parameter space and take into account all nonlinear effects. The energy\ntransmutation depends on the particle statistics.\n", "  Capelli identities are shown to facilitate the construction of\nrepresentations of various Heisenberg algebras that arise in many-particle\nquantum mechanics and the construction of holomorphic representations of many\nLie algebras by Vector Coherent State methods. We consider the original Capelli\nidentity and its generalizations by Turnbull and by Howe and Umeda.\n", "  This paper addresses the problem of obtaining low-order models of fluid flows\nfor the purpose of designing robust feedback controllers. This is challenging\nsince whilst many flows are governed by a set of nonlinear, partial\ndifferential-algebraic equations (the Navier-Stokes equations), the majority of\nestablished control theory assumes models of much greater simplicity, in that\nthey are firstly: linear, secondly: described by ordinary differential\nequations, and thirdly: finite-dimensional. Linearisation, where appropriate,\novercomes the first disparity, but attempts to reconcile the remaining two have\nproved difficult. This paper addresses these two problems as follows. Firstly,\na numerical approach is used to project the governing equations onto a\ndivergence-free basis, thus converting a system of differential-algebraic\nequations into one of ordinary differential equations. This dispenses with the\nneed for analytical velocity-vorticity transformations, and thus simplifies the\nmodelling of boundary sensing and actuation. Secondly, this paper presents a\nnovel and straightforward approach for obtaining suitable low-order models of\nfluid flows, from which robust feedback controllers can be synthesised that\nprovide a priori guarantees of robust performance when connected to the\n(infinite-dimensional) linearised flow system. This approach overcomes many of\nthe problems inherent in approaches that rely upon model-reduction. To\nillustrate these methods, a perturbation shear stress controller is designed\nand applied to plane channel flow, assuming arrays of wall mounted shear-stress\nsensors and transpiration actuators. DNS results demonstrate robust attenuation\nof the perturbation shear-stresses across a wide range of Reynolds numbers with\na single, linear controller.\n", "  We study non-equilibrium steady state transport in scale invariant quantum\njunctions with focus on the particle and heat fluctuations captured by the\ntwo-point current correlation functions. We show that the non-linear behavior\nof the particle current affects both the particle and heat noise. The existence\nof domains of enhancement and reduction of the noise power with respect to the\nlinear regime are observed. The impact of the statistics is explored. We\ndemonstrate that in the scale invariant case the bosonic particle noise exceeds\nthe fermionic one in the common domain of heat bath parameters. Multi-lead\nconfigurations are also investigated and the effect of probe terminals on the\nnoise is discussed.\n", "  The scaling of entanglement entropy for the nearest neighbor\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin model is studied computationally for clusters\njoined by a single bond. Bisecting the balanced three legged Bethe Cluster,\ngives a second Renyi entropy and the valence bond entropy which scales as the\nnumber of sites in the cluster. For the analogous situation with square\nclusters, i.e. two $L \\times L$ clusters joined by a single bond, numerical\nresults suggest that the second Renyi entropy and the valence bond entropy\nscales as $L$. For both systems, the environment and the system are connected\nby the single bond and interaction is short range. The entropy is not constant\nwith system size as suggested by the area law.\n", "  Searching for new states of matter and unusual quasiparticles in emerging\nmaterials and especially low-dimensional systems is one of the major trends in\ncontemporary condensed matter physics. Dirac materials, which host\nquasiparticles which are described by ultrarelativistic Dirac-like equations,\nare of a significant current interest from both a fundamental and applied\nphysics perspective. Here we show that a pair of two-dimensional massless\nDirac-Weyl fermions can form a bound state independently of the sign of the\ninter-particle interaction potential, as long as this potential decays at large\ndistances faster than Kepler's inverse distance law. This leads to the\nemergence of a new type of energetically-favourable quasiparticle: bielectron\nvortices, which are double-charged and reside at zero-energy. Their bosonic\nnature allows for condensation and may give rise to Majorana physics without\ninvoking a superconductor. These novel quasiparticles arguably explain a range\nof poorly understood experiments in gated graphene structures at low doping.\n", "  Tunneling, transport of particles through classically forbidden regions, is a\npure quantum phenomenon. It governs numerous phenomena ranging from\nsingle-molecule electronics to donor-acceptor transition reactions. The main\nproblem is the absence of a universal method to compute tunneling time. This\nproblem has been attacked in various ways in the literature. Here, in the\npresent work, we show that a statistical approach to the problem, motivated by\nthe imaginary nature of time in the forbidden regions, lead to a novel\ntunneling time formula which is real and subluminal (in contrast to various\nknown time definitions implying superluminal tunneling). This entropic\ntunneling time, as we call it, shows good agreement with the tunneling time\nmeasurements in laser-driven He ionization. Moreover, it sets an accurate range\nfor long-range electron transfer reactions. The entropic tunneling time is\ngeneral enough to extend to the photon and phonon tunneling phenomena.\n", "  We consider a test, non-null electromagnetic field special in the sense that\nthe principal null directions of the field lie along the two repeated principal\nnull directions of the type D vacuum background. We prove that the special\nnon-null field is a valid solution of the Maxwell equations on a type D\nbackground. This field behaves as $1/r^2$ and the only non-vanishing Maxwell\nscalar is $\\phi_1$ so it can be called the Coulomb field. We show that the\ncontribution to the energy and angular momentum fluxes of the Coulomb field\nvanishes at any surface of integration, on the type D vacuum backgrounds Kerr,\nKerr-Taub-NUT, Taub-NUT, and Schwarzschild. Therefore this field does not lead\nto any perturbations of the mass and angular momentum parameters of these\nspace-times.\n", "  We derive the exact n-point current expectation values in the\nLandauer-Buttiker non-equilibrium steady state of a multi terminal system with\nstar graph geometry and a point-like defect localised in the vertex. The\ncurrent cumulants are extracted from the connected correlation functions and\nthe cumulant generating function is established. We determine the moments, show\nthat the associated moment problem has a unique solution and reconstruct\nexplicitly the corresponding probability distribution. The basic building\nblocks of this distribution are the probabilities of particle emission and\nabsorption from the heat reservoirs, driving the system away from equilibrium.\nWe derive and analyse in detail these probabilities, showing that they fully\ndescribe the quantum transport problem in the system.\n", "  We develop a quantum circuit model describing unitary interactions between\nquantum fields and a uniformly accelerated object, and apply it to a\nsemi-transparent mirror which uniformly accelerates in the Minkowski vacuum.\nThe reflection coefficient $R_{\\omega}$ of the mirror varies between 0 and 1,\nrepresenting a generalization of the perfect mirror ($R_{\\omega}=1$) discussed\nextensively in the literature. Our method is non-perturbative, not requiring\n$R_{\\omega} \\sim 0$. We use the circuit model to calculate the radiation from\nan eternally accelerated mirror and obtain a finite particle flux along the\npast horizon provided an appropriate low frequency regularization is\nintroduced. More importantly, it is straightforward to see from our formalism\nthat the radiation is squeezed. The squeezing is closely related to cutting the\ncorrelation across the horizon, which therefore may have important implications\nto the formation of a black hole firewall.\n", "  Noether's theorem has gained outstanding importance in theoretical particle\nphysics, because it leads to basic conservation laws, such as the conservation\nof momentum and of angular momentum. Closely related to this theorem, but\nunnoticed so far, is a complementary law, which requires the (virtual) exchange\nof momentum between the particles of a closed multi-particle system. This\nexchange of momentum determines an interaction. For a two-particle system\ndefined by an irreducible representation of the Poincare group, this\ninteraction is identified as the electromagnetic interaction. This sheds new\nlight on the particle interactions described by the Standard Model. It resolves\nlong-standing questions about the value of the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant, and about divergent integrals in quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  An exact relation is derived between scalar dissipation due to molecular\ndiffusivity and the randomness of stochastic Lagrangian trajectories for flows\nwithout bounding walls. This \"Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation\"\nequates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the\nvariance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal\nscalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic\nLagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of\nturbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is\nassociated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has\nbeen controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars\nadvected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this\ncontroversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For either a\npassive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field,\nincluding solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from\nwalls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian\nspontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove furthermore that\nspontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial\nscalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely\nequivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database\nof homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to\nthe results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects\nby stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories.\n", "  Rare decays of b hadrons provide a powerful way of identifying contributions\nfrom physics beyond the Standard Model, in particular from new hypothetical\nparticles too heavy to be produced at colliders. The most relevant experimental\nmeasurements are reviewed and possible interpretations are briefly discussed.\n", "  Models of geometric flows pertaining to $\\mathcal{R}^2$ scale invariant\n(super) gravity theories coupled to conformally invariant matter fields are\ninvestigated. Related to this work are supersymmetric scalar manifolds that are\nisomorphic to the K\\\"{a}hlerian spaces $\\mathcal{M}_n=SU(1,1+k)/U(1)\\times\nSU(1+k)$ as generalizations of the non-supersymmetric analogs with\n$SO(1,1+k)/SO(1+k)$ manifolds. For curved superspaces with geometric evolution\nof physical objects, a complete supersymmetric theory has to be elaborated on\nnonholonomic (super) manifolds and bundles determined by non-integrable\nsuperdistributions with additional constraints on (super) field dynamics and\ngeometric evolution equations. We also consider generalizations of Perelman's\nfunctionals using such nonholonomic variables which result in the decoupling of\ngeometric flow equations and Ricci soliton equations with supergravity\nmodifications of the $R^2$ gravity theory. As such, it is possible to construct\nexact non-homogeneous and locally anisotropic cosmological solutions for\nvarious types of (super) gravity theories modelled as modified Ricci soliton\nconfigurations. Such solutions are defined by employing the general ansatz\nencompassing coefficients of generic off-diagonal metrics and generalized\nconnections that depend generically on all spacetime coordinates. We consider\nnonholonomic constraints resulting in diagonal homogeneous configurations\nencoding contributions from possible nonlinear parametric geometric evolution\nscenarios, off-diagonal interactions and anisotropic polarization/ modification\nof physical constants. We also analyze the conditions under which such modified\nmimetic type theories and solutions reproduce the Starobinsky inflationary\nmodels in the double scalar approach.\n", "  Electron irradiation of GaN nanowires in a scanning electron microscope\nstrongly reduces their luminous efficiency as shown by cathodoluminescence\nimaging and spectroscopy. We demonstrate that this luminescence quenching\noriginates from a combination of charge trapping at already existing surface\nstates and the formation of new surface states induced by the adsorption of C\non the nanowire sidewalls. The interplay of these effects leads to a complex\ntemporal evolution of the quenching, which strongly depends on the incident\nelectron dose per area. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on\nelectron-irradiated samples reveal that the carbonaceous adlayer affects both\nthe nonradiative and the radiative recombination dynamics.\n", "  The self-consistent modeling of vacuum polarization due to virtual\nelectron-positron fluctuations is of relevance for many near term experiments\nassociated with high intensity radiation sources and represents a milestone in\ndescribing scenarios of extreme energy density. We present a generalized\nfinite-difference time-domain solver that can incorporate the modifications to\nMaxwell's equations due to vacuum polarization. Our multidimensional solver\nreproduced in one dimensional configurations the results for which an analytic\ntreatment is possible, yielding vacuum harmonic generation and birefringence.\nThe solver has also been tested for two-dimensional scenarios where finite\nlaser beam spot sizes must be taken into account. We employ this solver to\nexplore different types of counter-propagating configurations that can be\nrelevant for future planned experiments aiming to detect quantum vacuum\ndynamics at ultra-high electromagnetic field intensities.\n", "  It is shown that the data of the Hensen et al. Bell test experiment exhibits\nanomalous postselection that can fully account for the apparent violation of\nthe CHSH inequality. A simulation of a local realist model implementing similar\npostselection is presented. The model produces an apparent violation of CHSH\nindistinguishable from that of the experiment. The experimental data also\nappears to violate no-signaling, and it is shown how postselection can produce\nan artifactual violation of no-signaling. The Hensen et al. experiment does not\nsucceed in rejecting classical locality and therefore does not confirm quantum\nnonlocality.\n", "  The impact of bound states in Landauer-Buttiker scattering approach to\nnon-equilibrium quantum transport is investigated. We show that the noise power\nat frequency $\\nu$ is sensitive to all bound states with energies $\\omega_b$\nsatisfying $|\\omega_b| < \\nu$. We derive the exact expression of the bound\nstate contribution and compare it to the one produced by the scattering states\nalone. It turns out that the bound states lead to specific modifications of\nboth space and frequency dependence of the total noise power. The theoretical\nand experimental consequences of this result are discussed.\n", "  The initial magnetic field of previous magnetorotational instability (MRI)\nsimulations has always included a significant system-scale component, even if\nstochastic. However, it is of conceptual and practical interest to assess\nwhether the MRI can grow when the initial field is turbulent. The ubiquitous\npresence of turbulent or random flows in astrophysical plasmas generically\nleads to a small-scale dynamo (SSD), which would provide initial seed turbulent\nvelocity and magnetic fields in the plasma that becomes an accretion disc. Can\nthe MRI grow from these more realistic initial conditions? To address this we\nsupply a standard shearing box with isotropically forced SSD generated magnetic\nand velocity fields as initial conditions, and remove the forcing. We find that\nif the initially supplied fields are too weak or too incoherent, they decay\nfrom the initial turbulent cascade faster than they can grow via the MRI. When\nthe initially supplied fields are sufficient to allow MRI growth and\nsustenance, the saturated stresses, large-scale fields, and power spectra match\nthose of the standard zero net flux MRI simulation with an initial large scale\nvertical field.\n", "  Future sea-level rise poses nontrivial risks for many coastal communities.\nManaging these risks often relies on consensus projections like those provided\nby the IPCC. Yet, there is a growing awareness that the surrounding\nuncertainties may be much larger than typically perceived. Recently published\nsea-level projections appear widely divergent and highly sensitive to\nnon-trivial model choices and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may be much\nless stable than previously believed, enabling a rapid disintegration. In\nresponse, some agencies have already announced to update their projections\naccordingly. Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level projections that\napproximate deeply uncertain WAIS contributions. The projections aim to inform\nrobust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial\nassumptions. We show that the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate\nother uncertainties within decades. These deep uncertainties call for the\ndevelopment of robust adaptive strategies. These decision-making needs, in\nturn, require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential\nsignposts and the maximum rate of WAIS induced sea-level changes.\n", "  A Markovian lattice model for photoreceptor cells is introduced to describe\nthe growth of mosaic patterns on fish retina. The radial stripe pattern\nobserved in wild-type zebrafish is shown to be selected naturally during the\nretina growth, against the geometrically equivalent, circular stripe pattern.\nThe mechanism of such dynamical pattern selection is clarified on the basis of\nboth numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, which find that the\nsuccessive emergence of local defects plays a critical role in the realization\nof the wild-type pattern.\n", "  We have recorded the coherent diffraction images of individual xenon clusters\nwith intense extreme ultraviolet pulses to elucidate the influence of\nlight-induced electronic changes on the diffraction pattern. Using the FLASH\nfree-electron laser we tuned the wavelength to specific xenon atomic and ionic\nresonances. The data show the emergence of a transient core-shell structure\nwithin the otherwise homogeneous sample. Simulations indicate that ionization\nand nanoplasma formation result in a cluster shell with strongly altered\nrefraction. The presented resonant scattering approach enables imaging of\nultrafast electron dynamics on their natural time scale.\n", "  We comment on the recent work [N. Harrison, \\textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. B {\\bf\n92}, 224505 (2015)] which attempts to explain the sign reversal and quantum\noscillations of the Hall coefficient observed in cuprates from a single nodal\ndiamond-shaped electron pocket with concave arc segments. Given the importance\nof this work, it calls for a closer scrutiny. Their conclusion of sign reversal\nof the Hall coefficient depends on a non-generic rounding of the sharp\nvertices. Moreover, their demonstration of quantum oscillation in the Hall\ncoefficient from a single pocket is unconvincing. We maintain that at least two\npockets with different scattering rates is necessary to explain the observed\nquantum oscillations of the Hall coefficient.\n", "  We develop a general framework to investigate fluctuations of non-commuting\nobservables. To this end, we consider the Keldysh quasi-probability\ndistribution (KQPD). This distribution provides a measurement-independent\ndescription of the observables of interest and their time-evolution.\nNevertheless, positive probability distributions for measurement outcomes can\nbe obtained from the KQPD by taking into account the effect of measurement\nback-action and imprecision. Negativity in the KQPD can be linked to an\ninterference effect and acts as an indicator for non-classical behavior.\nNotable examples of the KQPD are the Wigner function and the full counting\nstatistics, both of which have been used extensively to describe systems in the\nabsence as well as in the presence of a measurement apparatus. Here we discuss\nthe KQPD and its moments in detail and connect it to various time-dependent\nproblems including weak values, fluctuating work, and Leggett-Garg\ninequalities. Our results are illustrated using the simple example of two\nsubsequent, non-commuting spin measurements.\n", "  Single-photon detectors in space must retain useful performance\ncharacteristics despite being bombarded with sub-atomic particles. Mitigating\nthe effects of this space radiation is vital to enabling new space applications\nwhich require high-fidelity single-photon detection. To this end, we conducted\nproton radiation tests of various models of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and\none model of photomultiplier tube potentially suitable for satellite-based\nquantum communications. The samples were irradiated with 106 MeV protons at\ndoses approximately equivalent to lifetimes of 0.6 , 6, 12 and 24 months in a\nlow-Earth polar orbit. Although most detection properties were preserved,\nincluding efficiency, timing jitter and afterpulsing probability, all APD\nsamples demonstrated significant increases in dark count rate (DCR) due to\nradiation-induced damage, many orders of magnitude higher than the 200 counts\nper second (cps) required for ground-to-satellite quantum communications. We\nthen successfully demonstrated the mitigation of this DCR degradation through\nthe use of deep cooling, to as low as -86 degrees C. This achieved DCR below\nthe required 200 cps over the 24 months orbit duration. DCR was further reduced\nby thermal annealing at temperatures of +50 to +100 degrees C.\n", "  We explore two classes of 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ little string theories\nobtained from type IIA/IIB NS5-branes probing $D_n$ singularities. Their tensor\nbranches are described by effective gauge theories whose instanton solitons are\nmacroscopic little strings. We specifically study two families of 2d\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ gauge theories which describe at low energy the worldsheet\ndynamics of the type IIA/IIB little strings. These gauge theories are useful to\ncalculate the supersymmetric partition functions of the little string theories\non $\\mathbf{R}^4 \\times T^2$. We establish the T-duality of the little string\ntheories by utilizing their BPS spectra as a probe.\n", "  We suggest that a randomization of the pseudo-dipolar interaction in the\nspin-orbit-generated low-energy Hamiltonian of YbMgGaO$_4$ due to an\ninhomogeneous charge environment from a natural mixing of Mg$^{2+}$ and\nGa$^{3+}$ can give rise to orientational spin disorder and mimic a\nspin-liquid-like state. In the absence of such quenched disorder, $1/S$ and\ndensity matrix renormalization group calculations both show robust ordered\nstates for the physically relevant phases of the model. Our scenario is\nconsistent with the available experimental data and further experiments are\nproposed to support it.\n", "  We derive here Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relations for advected\nscalars in wall-bounded flows. The relations equate the dissipation rate for\neither passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs from the\ninitial values, boundary values, and internal sources, as those are sampled\nbackward in time by stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. New probabilistic\nconcepts are required to represent scalar boundary conditions at the walls: the\nboundary local-time density at points on the wall where scalar fluxes are\nimposed and the boundary first hitting-time at points where scalar values are\nimposed. These concepts are illustrated both by analytical results for the\nproblem of pure heat conduction and by numerical results from a database of\nchannel-flow flow turbulence, which also demonstrate the scalar mixing\nproperties of near-wall turbulence. As an application of the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation, we examine for wall-bounded flows the\nrelation between anomalous scalar dissipation and Lagrangian spontaneous\nstochasticity, i.e. the persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle\ntrajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. In the first\npaper of this series, we showed that spontaneous stochasticity is the only\npossible mechanism for anomalous dissipation of passive or active scalars, away\nfrom walls. Here it is shown that this remains true when there are no scalar\nfluxes through walls. Simple examples show, on the other hand, that a distinct\nmechanism of non-vanishing scalar dissipation can be thin scalar boundary\nlayers near the walls. Nevertheless, we prove for general wall-bounded flows\nthat spontaneous stochasticity is another possible mechanism of anomalous\nscalar dissipation.\n", "  We derive the trace and diffeomorphism anomalies of the Schr\\\"odinger field\nminimally coupled to the Newton-Cartan background using Fujikawa's path\nintegral approach. This approach in particular enables us to calculate the\none-loop contributions due to all the fields of the Newton-Cartan structure. We\ndetermine the coefficients and demonstrate that gravitational anomalies for\nthis theory always arise in odd dimensions. Due to the gauge field contribution\nof the background we find that in $2+1$ dimensions the trace anomaly contains\nterms which have a form similar to that of the $1+1$ and $3+1$ dimensional\nrelativistic trace anomalies. This result reveals that the Newton-Cartan\nbackground which satisfies the Frobenius condition possesses a Type A trace\nanomaly in contrast with the result of Lishitz spacetimes. As an application we\ndemonstrate that the coefficient of the term similar to the $1+1$ dimensional\nrelativistic trace anomaly satisfies a c-theorem condition.\n", "  We find confluent Heun solutions to the radial equations of two\nHalilsoy-Badawi metrics. For the first metric, we studied the radial part of\nthe massless Dirac equation and for the second case, we studied the radial part\nof the massless Klein-Gordon equation.\n", "  We show why and how Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius should be\ncombined into one single new length scale, which we call the\nCompton-Schwarzschild length. Doing so offers a resolution of the black hole\ninformation loss paradox, and suggests Planck mass remnant black holes as\ncandidates for dark matter. It also compels us to introduce torsion, and\nidentify the Dirac field with a complex torsion field. Dirac equation, and\nEinstein equations, are shown to be mutually dual limiting cases of an\nunderlying gravitation theory which involves the Compton-Schwarzschild length\nscale, and includes a complex torsion field.\n", "  We revisit the radiative decays of the Higgs boson to a fermion pair\n$h\\rightarrow f\\bar{f}\\gamma$ where $f$ denotes a fermion in the Standard Model\n(SM). We include the chirality-flipping diagrams via the Yukawa couplings at\nthe order $\\mathcal{O}(y_f^2 \\alpha)$, the chirality-conserving contributions\nvia the top-quark loops of the order $\\mathcal{O}(y_t^2 \\alpha^3)$, and the\nelectroweak loops at the order $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha^4)$. The QED correction is\nabout $Q_f^2\\times {\\cal O}(1\\%)$ and contributes to the running of fermion\nmasses at a similar level, which should be taken into account for future\nprecision Higgs physics. The chirality-conserving electroweak-loop processes\nare interesting from the observational point of view. First, the branching\nfraction of the radiative decay $h \\to \\mu^+\\mu^- \\gamma$ is about a half of\nthat of $h \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$, and that of $h \\to e^+ e^- \\gamma$ is more than\nfour orders of magnitude larger than that of $h \\to e^+ e^-$, both of which\nreach about $10^{-4}$. The branching fraction of $h \\to \\tau^+\\tau^- \\gamma$ is\nof the order $10^{-3}$. All the leptonic radiative decays are potentially\nobservable at the LHC Run 2 or the HL-LHC. The kinematic distributions for the\nphoton energy or the fermion pair invariant mass provide non-ambiguous\ndiscrimination for the underlying mechanisms of the Higgs radiative decay. We\nalso study the process $h \\to c\\bar c \\gamma$ and evaluate the observability at\nthe LHC. We find it comparable to the other related studies and better than the\n$h \\to J/\\psi\\ \\gamma$ channel in constraining the charm-Yukawa coupling.\n", "  We measured the mean plane of the Kuiper belt as a function of semi-major\naxis. For the classical Kuiper belt as a whole (the non-resonant objects in the\nsemi-major axis range 42--48~au), we find a mean plane of inclination\n$i_m=1.8^{\\circ}$$^{+0.7^{\\circ}}_{-0.4^{\\circ}}$ and longitude of ascending\nnode $\\Omega_m=77^{\\circ}$$^{+18^{\\circ}}_{-14^{\\circ}}$ (in the J2000\necliptic-equinox coordinate system), in accord with theoretical expectations of\nthe secular effects of the known planets. With finer semi-major axis bins, we\ndetect a statistically significant warp in the mean plane near semi-major axes\n40--42~au. Linear secular theory predicts a warp near this location due to the\n$\\nu_{18}$ nodal secular resonance, however the measured mean plane for the\n40.3-42~au semi-major axis bin (just outside the $\\nu_{18}$) is inclined\n$\\sim13^{\\circ}$ to the predicted plane, a nearly 3-$\\sigma$ discrepancy. For\nthe more distant Kuiper belt objects of semi-major axes in the range 50--80~au,\nthe expected mean plane is close to the invariable plane of the solar system,\nbut the measured mean plane deviates greatly from this: it has inclination\n$i_m=9.1^{\\circ}$$^{+6.6^{\\circ}}_{-3.8^{\\circ}}$ and longitude of ascending\nnode $\\Omega_m=227^{\\circ}$$^{+18^{\\circ}}_{-44^{\\circ}}$. We estimate this\ndeviation from the expected mean plane to be statistically significant at the\n$\\sim97-99\\%$ confidence level. We discuss several possible explanations for\nthis deviation, including the possibility that a relatively close-in\n($a\\lesssim100$~au), unseen small planetary-mass object in the outer solar\nsystem is responsible for the warping.\n", "  Electron spin-momentum locking together with background magnetic textures can\nsignificantly alter the electron transport properties. We theoretically\ninvestigate the electron transport at the interface between a topological\ninsulator and a magnetic insulator with magnetic skyrmions on the top. In\ncontrast to the conventional topological Hall effect in normal metals, the\nskyrmions yield an additional contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity\neven in the absence of in-plane magnetic texture, arising from the phase factor\ncharacteristic to Dirac electrons acquired at skyrmion boundary.\n", "  Aboria is a powerful and flexible C++ library for the implementation of\nparticle-based numerical methods. The particles in such methods can represent\nactual particles (e.g. Molecular Dynamics) or abstract particles used to\ndiscretise a continuous function over a domain (e.g. Radial Basis Functions).\nAboria provides a particle container, compatible with the Standard Template\nLibrary, spatial search data structures, and a Domain Specific Language to\nspecify non-linear operators on the particle set. This paper gives an overview\nof Aboria's design, an example of use, and a performance benchmark.\n", "  We study the ac current-driven domain wall motion in bilayer ferromagnetic\nmetal (FM)/nonmagnetic metal (NM) nanowire. The solution of the modified\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation including all the spin transfer torques is\nused to describe motion of the domain wall in presence of the spin Hall effect.\nWe show that the domain wall center has second harmonic frequency response in\naddition to the known first harmonic excitation. In contrast to the\nexperimentally observed second harmonic response in harmonic Hall measurements\nof spin-orbit torque in magnetic thin films, this second harmonic response\ndirectly originates from spin-orbit torque driven domain wall dynamics. Based\non the spin current generated by domain wall dynamics, the longitudinal spin\nmotive force generated voltage across the length of the nanowire is determined.\nThe second harmonic response introduces additionally a new practical field-free\nand all-electrical method to probe the effective spin Hall angle for FM/NM\nbilayer structures that could be applied in experiments. Our results also\ndemonstrate the capability of utilizing FM/NM bilayer structure in domain wall\nbased spin torque signal generators and resonators.\n", "  We study the quantum Ising model in D dimensions with the equation of motion\ntechnique, in combination with the Majorana representation for spins. The\ndecoupling scheme used for the Green's functions is based on the hierarchy of\ncorrelations in position space. To lowest order this method reproduces the well\nknown mean field phase diagram and critical exponents. When correlations\nbetween spins are included, we show how the appearance of thermal fluctuations\nand magnons strongly affect the physical properties. We demonstrate that in 1D\nand for B=0, thermal fluctuations completely destroy the ordered phase, and\nthat near the quantum critical point, the quantum model displays different\nbehavior than its classical counterpart. We discuss the connection with the\nDyson's equation formalism and the explicit form of the self-energies.\n", "  We explore the non-equilibrium evolution and stationary states of an open\nmany-body system which displays epidemic spreading dynamics in a classical and\na quantum regime. Our study is motivated by recent experiments conducted in\nstrongly interacting gases of highly excited Rydberg atoms where the\nfacilitated excitation of Rydberg states competes with radiative decay. These\nsystems approximately implement open quantum versions of models for population\ndynamics or disease spreading where species can be in a healthy, infected or\nimmune state. We show that in a two-dimensional lattice, depending on the\ndominance of either classical or quantum effects, the system may display a\ndifferent kind of non-equilibrium phase transition. We moreover discuss the\nobservability of our findings in laser driven Rydberg gases with particular\nfocus on the role of long-range interactions.\n", "  Future sea-level rise drives severe risks for many coastal communities.\nStrategies to manage these risks hinge on a sound characterization of the\nuncertainties. For example, recent studies suggest that large fractions of the\nAntarctic ice sheet (AIS) may rapidly disintegrate in response to rising global\ntemperatures, leading to potentially several meters of sea-level rise during\nthe next few centuries. It is deeply uncertain, for example, whether such an\nAIS disintegration will be triggered, how much this would increase sea-level\nrise, whether extreme storm surges intensify in a warming climate, or which\nemissions pathway future societies will choose. Here, we assess the impacts of\nthese deep uncertainties on projected flooding probabilities for a levee ring\nin New Orleans, Louisiana. We use 18 scenarios, presenting probabilistic\nprojections within each one, to sample key deeply uncertain future projections\nof sea-level rise, radiative forcing pathways, storm surge characterization,\nand contributions from rapid AIS mass loss. The implications of these deep\nuncertainties for projected flood risk are thus characterized by a set of 18\nprobability distribution functions. We use a global sensitivity analysis to\nassess which mechanisms contribute to uncertainty in projected flood risk over\nthe course of a 50-year design life. In line with previous work, we find that\nthe uncertain storm surge drives the most substantial risk, followed by general\nAIS dynamics, in our simple model for future flood risk for New Orleans.\n", "  We present first results and future plans for the Oscillating Resonant Group\nAxioN (ORGAN) experiment, a microwave cavity axion haloscope situated in Perth,\nWestern Australia designed to probe for high mass axions motivated by several\ntheoretical models. The first stage focuses around 26.6 GHz in order to\ndirectly test a claimed result, which suggests axions exist at the\ncorresponding mass of $110~\\mu$eV. Later stages will move to a wider scan range\nof 15-50 GHz ($60-210~\\mu $eV). We present the results of the pathfinding run,\nwhich sets a limit on $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$ of $2.02\\times 10^{-12} $eV$^{-1}$ at\n26.531 GHz, or 110~$\\mu$eV, in a span of 2.5 neV (shaped by the Lorentzian\nresonance) with $90 \\%$ confidence. Furthermore, we outline the current design\nand future strategies to eventually attain the sensitivity to search for well\nknown axion models over the wider mass range.\n", "  A particle with internal unobserved states diffusing in a force field will\ngenerally display effective advection-diffusion. The drift velocity is\nproportional to the mobility averaged over the internal states, or effective\nmobility, while the effective diffusion has two terms. One is of the\nequilibrium type and satisfies an Einstein relation with the effective mobility\nwhile the other is quadratic in the applied force. In this contribution we\npresent two new methods to obtain these results, on the one hand using large\ndeviation techniques, and on the other by a multiple-scale analysis, and\ncompare the two. We consider both systems with discrete internal states and\ncontinuous internal states. We show that the auxiliary equations in the\nmultiple-scale analysis can also be derived in second-order perturbation theory\nin a large deviation theory of a generating function (discrete internal states)\nor generating functional (continuous internal states). We discuss that\nmeasuring the two components of the effective diffusion give a way to determine\nkinetic rates from only first and second moments of the displacement in steady\nstate.\n", "  Because of increasing global urbanization and its immediate consequences,\nincluding changes in patterns of food demand, circulation and land use, the\nnext century will witness a major increase in the extent of paved roads built\nworldwide. To model the effects of this increase, it is crucial to understand\nwhether possible self-organized patterns are inherent in the global road\nnetwork structure. Here, we use the largest updated database comprising all\nmajor roads on Earth, together with global urban and cropland inventories, to\nsuggest that road length distributions within croplands are indistinguishable\nfrom urban ones, once rescaled to account for the difference in mean road\nlength. Such similarity extends to road length distributions within urban or\nagricultural domains of given area. We find two distinct regimes for the\nscaling of the mean road length with the associated area, holding in general at\nsmall and at large values of the latter. In suitably large urban and cropland\ndomains, we find that mean and total road lengths increase linearly with their\ndomain area, differently from earlier suggestions. Scaling regimes suggest that\nsimple and universal mechanisms regulate urban and cropland road expansion at\nthe global scale. As such, our findings bear implications for global road\ninfrastructure growth based on land-use change and for planning policies\nsustaining urban expansions.\n", "  We are entering the era of high-precision and high-resolution spectroscopy of\nexoplanets. Such observations herald the need for robust self-consistent\nspectral models of exoplanetary atmospheres to investigate intricate\natmospheric processes and to make observable predictions. Spectral models of\nplane-parallel exoplanetary atmospheres exist, mostly adapted from other\nastrophysical applications, with different levels of sophistication and\naccuracy. There is a growing need for a new generation of models custom-built\nfor exoplanets and incorporating state-of-the-art numerical methods and\nopacities. The present work is a step in this direction. Here we introduce\nGENESIS, a plane-parallel, self-consistent, line-by-line exoplanetary\natmospheric modelling code which includes (a) formal solution of radiative\ntransfer using the Feautrier method, (b) radiative-convective equilibrium with\ntemperature correction based on the Rybicki linearisation scheme, (c) latest\nabsorption cross sections, and (d) internal flux and external irradiation,\nunder the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium, local thermodynamic\nequilibrium and thermochemical equilibrium. We demonstrate the code here with\ncloud-free models of giant exoplanetary atmospheres over a range of equilibrium\ntemperatures, metallicities, C/O ratios and spanning non-irradiated and\nirradiated planets, with and without thermal inversions. We provide the\ncommunity with theoretical emergent spectra and pressure-temperature profiles\nover this range, along with those for several known hot Jupiters. The code can\ngenerate self-consistent spectra at high resolution and has the potential to be\nintegrated into general circulation and non-equilibrium chemistry models as it\nis optimised for efficiency and convergence. GENESIS paves the way for\nhigh-fidelity remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres at high resolution\nwith current and upcoming observations.\n", "  Electromagnetic properties of the deformed neutron-odd nucleus $^{229}$Th are\ninvestigated in the framework of the unified model, with primary emphasis upon\nthe properties of the low-lying isomeric state.\n", "  We investigate spatially inhomogeneous versions of the stochastic\nLotka-Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence by means of\nMonte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. To study boundary effects for this paradigmatic population dynamics\nsystem, we employ a simulation domain split into two patches: Upon setting the\npredation rates at two distinct values, one half of the system resides in an\nabsorbing state where only the prey survives, while the other half attains a\nstable coexistence state wherein both species remain active. At the domain\nboundary, we observe a marked enhancement of the predator population density.\nThe predator correlation length displays a minimum at the boundary, before\nreaching its asymptotic constant value deep in the active region. The frequency\nof the population oscillations appears only very weakly affected by the\nexistence of two distinct domains, in contrast to their attenuation rate, which\nassumes its largest value there. We also observe that boundary effects become\nless prominent as the system is successively divided into subdomains in a\ncheckerboard pattern, with two different reaction rates assigned to neighboring\npatches. When the domain size becomes reduced to the scale of the correlation\nlength, the mean population densities attain values that are very similar to\nthose in a disordered system with randomly assigned reaction rates drawn from a\nbimodal distribution.\n", "  The emissivity of common materials remains constant with temperature\nvariations, and cannot drastically change. However, it is possible to design\nits entire behaviour as a function of temperature, and to significantly modify\nthe thermal emissivity of a surface through the combination of different\nmaterials and patterns. Here, we show that smart patterned surfaces consisting\nof smaller structures (motifs) may be designed to respond uniquely through\ncombinatorial design strategies by transforming themselves from 2D to 3D\ncomplex structures with a two-way shape memory effect. The smart surfaces can\npassively manipulate thermal radiation without-the use of controllers and power\nsupplies-because their modus operandi has already been programmed and\nintegrated into their intrinsic characteristics; the environment provides the\nenergy required for their activation. Each motif emits thermal radiation in a\ncertain manner, as it changes its geometry; however, the spatial distribution\nof these motifs causes them to interact with each other. Therefore, their\ncombination and interaction determine the global behaviour of the surfaces,\nthus enabling their a priori design. The emissivity behaviour is not random; it\nis determined by two fundamental parameters, namely the combination of\norientations in which the motifs open (n-fold rotational symmetry (rn)) and the\ncombination of materials (colours) on the motifs; these generate functions\nwhich fully determine the dependency of the emissivity on the temperature.\n", "  The centrality dependence of pseudorapidity distributions for charged\nparticles produced in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ GeV and 200 GeV\nat RHIC, and in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV at LHC are\ninvestigated in the fireball model, assuming that the rapidity axis is\npopulated with fireballs following one distribution function. We assume that\nthe particles in the fireball fulfill the Tsallis distribution. The theoretical\nresults are compared with the experimental measurements and a good agreement is\nfound. Using these results, the pseudorapidity distributions of charged\nparticles produced in Pb+Pb central collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV and\n10 TeV are predicted.\n", "  Dirac points in two-dimensional (2D) materials have been a fascinating\nsubject of research, with graphene as the most prominent example. However, the\nDirac points in existing 2D materials, including graphene, are vulnerable\nagainst spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, based on first-principles calculations\nand theoretical analysis, we propose a new family of stable 2D materials, the\nHfGeTe-family monolayers, which represent the first example to host so-called\nspin-orbit Dirac points (SDPs) close to the Fermi level. These Dirac points are\nspecial in that they are formed only under significant SOC, hence they are\nintrinsically robust against SOC. We show that the existence of a pair of SDPs\nare dictated by the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry of the system, which are\nvery robust under various types of lattice strains. The energy, the dispersion,\nand the valley occupation around the Dirac points can be effectively tuned by\nstrain. We construct a low-energy effective model to characterize the Dirac\nfermions around the SDPs. Furthermore, we find that the material is\nsimultaneously a 2D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological metal, which possesses\nnontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant in the bulk and spin-helical edge states on\nthe boundary. From the calculated exfoliation energies and mechanical\nproperties, we show that these materials can be readily obtained in experiment\nfrom the existing bulk materials. Our result reveals HfGeTe-family monolayers\nas a promising platform for exploring spin-orbit Dirac fermions and novel\ntopological phases in two-dimensions.\n", "  We demonstrate that an applied electric field causes piezoelectric distortion\nacross single molecular monolayers of oligopeptides. We deposited\nself-assembled monolayers ~1.5 nm high onto smooth gold surfaces. These\nmonolayers exhibit strong piezoelectric response that varies linearly with\napplied bias (1-3V), measured using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The\nresponse is markedly greater than control experiments with rigid alkanethiols\nand correlates with surface spectroscopy and theoretical predictions of\nconformational change from applied electric fields. Unlike existing\npiezoelectric oxides, our peptide monolayers are intrinsically flexible, easily\nfabricated, aligned and patterned without poling.\n", "  We present a table-top quantum estimation protocol to measure the\ngravitational acceleration $g$ by using an optomechanical cavity. In\nparticular, we exploit the non-linear quantum light-matter interaction between\nan optical field and a massive mirror acting as mechanical oscillator. The\ngravitational field influences the system dynamics affecting the phase of the\ncavity field during the interaction. Reading out such phase carried by the\nradiation leaking from the cavity, we provide an estimate of the gravitational\nacceleration through interference measurements. Contrary to previous studies,\nhaving adopted a fully quantum description, we are able to propose a quantum\nanalysis proving the ultimate bound to the estimability of the gravitational\nacceleration and verifying optimality of homodyne detection. Noticeably, thanks\nto the light-matter decoupling at the measurement time, no initial cooling of\nthe mechanical oscillator is in principle demanded.\n", "  Parents and teachers often express concern about the extensive use of social\nmedia by youngsters. Some of them see emoticons, undecipherable initialisms and\nloose grammar typical for social media as evidence of language degradation. In\nthis paper, we use a simple measure of text complexity to investigate how the\ncomplexity of public posts on a popular social networking site changes over\ntime. We analyze a unique dataset that contains texts posted by 942, 336 users\nfrom a large European city across nine years. We show that the chosen\ncomplexity measure is correlated with the academic performance of users: users\nfrom high-performing schools produce more complex texts than users from\nlow-performing schools. We also find that complexity of posts increases with\nage. Finally, we demonstrate that overall language complexity of posts on the\nsocial networking site is constantly increasing. We call this phenomenon the\ndigital Flynn effect. Our results may suggest that the worries about language\ndegradation are not warranted.\n", "  It is shown theoretically that the renormalization of the electron energy\nspectrum of bilayer graphene with a strong high-frequency electromagnetic field\n(dressing field) results in the Lifshitz transition - the abrupt change in the\ntopology of the Fermi surface near the band edge. This effect substantially\ndepends on the polarization of the field: The linearly polarized dressing field\ninduces the Lifshitz transition from the quadruply-connected Fermi surface to\nthe doubly-connected one, whereas the circularly polarized field induces the\nmulticritical point, where the four different Fermi topologies may coexist. As\na consequence, the discussed phenomenon creates physical basis to control the\nelectronic properties of bilayer graphene with light.\n", "  Spin-dependent heat and thermoelectric currents in a quantum ring with Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction placed in a photon cavity are theoretically calculated.\nThe quantum ring is coupled to two external leads with different temperatures.\nIn a resonant regime, with the ring structure in resonance with the photon\nfield, the heat and the thermoelectric currents can be controlled by the Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction. The heat current is suppressed in the presence of the\nphoton field due to contribution of the two-electron and photon replica states\nto the transport while the thermoelectric current is not sensitive to changes\nin parameters of the photon field. Our study opens a possibility to use the\nproposed interferometric device as a tunable heat current generator in the\ncavity photon field.\n", "  We show that in a central nucleus-nucleus collision, the variation of the\nmean transverse mass with the multiplicity is determined, up to a rescaling, by\nthe variation of the energy over entropy ratio as a function of the entropy\ndensity, thus providing a direct link between experimental data and the\nequation of state. Each colliding energy thus probes the equation of state at\nan effective entropy density, whose approximate value is $19$ fm$^{-3}$ for\nAu+Au collisions at 200 GeV and $41$ fm$^{-3}$ for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76\nTeV, corresponding to temperatures of $227$ MeV and $279$ MeV if the equation\nof state is taken from lattice calculations. The relative change of the mean\ntransverse mass as a function of the colliding energy gives a direct measure of\nthe pressure over energy density ratio $P/\\epsilon$, at the corresponding\neffective density. Using RHIC and LHC data, we obtain $P/\\epsilon=0.21\\pm\n0.10$, in agreement with the lattice value $P/\\epsilon=0.23$ in the\ncorresponding temperature range. Measurements over a wide range of colliding\nenergies using a single detector with good particle identification would help\nreducing the error.\n", "  The Eckart co-rotating frame is used to analyze the dynamics of star polymers\nunder shear flow, either in melt or solution and with different types of bonds.\nThis formalism is compared with the standard approach used in many previous\nstudies on polymer dynamics, where an apparent angular velocity $\\omega$ is\nobtained from relation between the tensor of inertia and angular momentum. A\ncommon mistake is to interpret $\\omega$ as the molecular rotation frequency,\nwhich is only valid for rigid-body rotation. The Eckart frame, originally\nformulated to analyze the infrared spectra of small molecules, dissects\ndifferent kinds of displacements: vibrations without angular momentum, pure\nrotation, and vibrational angular momentum (leading to a Coriolis cross-term).\nThe Eckart frame co-rotates with the molecule with an angular frequency\n$\\Omega$ obtained from the Eckart condition for minimal coupling between\nrotation and vibration. The standard and Eckart approaches are compared with a\nstraight description of the star's dynamics taken from the time autocorrelation\nof the monomers positions moving around the molecule's center of mass. This is\nan underdamped oscillatory signal, which can be described by a rotation\nfrequency $\\omega_R$ and a decorrelation rate $\\Gamma$. We consistently find\nthat $\\Omega$ coincides with $\\omega_R$, which determines the characteristic\ntank-treading rotation of the star. By contrast, the apparent angular velocity\n$\\omega < \\Omega$ does not discern between pure rotation and molecular\nvibrations. We believe that the Eckart frame will be useful to unveil the\ndynamics of semiflexible molecules where rotation and deformations are\nentangled, including tumbling, tank-treading motions and breathing modes.\n", "  Differential shrinkage in particulate quasi-brittle materials causes\nmicrocracking which reduces durability in these materials by increasing their\nmass transport properties. A hydro-mechanical three-dimensional periodic\nnetwork approach was used to investigate the influence of particle and specimen\nsize on the specimen permeability. The particulate quasi-brittle materials\nstudied here consist of stiff elastic particles, and a softer matrix and\ninterfacial transition zones between matrix and particles exhibiting nonlinear\nmaterial responses. An incrementally applied uniform eigenstrain, along with a\ndamage-plasticity constitutive model, are used to describe the shrinkage and\ncracking processes of the matrix and interfacial transition zones. The results\nshowed that increasing particle diameter at constant volume fraction increases\nthe crack widths and, therefore, permeability, which confirms previously\nobtained 2D modelling results. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that specimen\nthickness has, in comparison to the influence of particle size, a small\ninfluence on permeability increase due to microcracking.\n", "  In high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, the dependence of the total\ncross-section ($\\sigma_{tot}$) with the energy still constitutes an open\nproblem for QCD. Phenomenological analyses usually relies on analytic\nparameterizations provided by the Regge-Gribov formalism and fits to the\nexperimental data. In this framework, the singularities of the scattering\namplitude in the complex angular momentum plane determine the asymptotic\nbehavior of $\\sigma_{tot}$ in terms of the energy. Usual applications connect\nsimple and triple pole singularities with asymptotic power and\nlogarithmic-squared functions of the energy, respectively. More restrict\napplications have considered as a leading component for $\\sigma_{tot}$ an\nempirical function consisting of a logarithmic raised to a real exponent, which\nis treated as a free fit parameter. With this function, data reductions lead to\ngood descriptions of the experimental data and real (not integer) values of the\nexponent. In this paper, making use of two independent formalisms (fractional\ncalculus and Mellin transform), we first show that the singularity associated\nwith this empirical function is a branch point and then we explore the\nmathematical consequences of the result and possible physical interpretations.\nAfter reviewing the determination of the singularities from asymptotic forms of\ninterest through the Mellin transform, we demonstrate that the same analytic\nresults can be obtained by means of the Caputo fractional derivative, leading,\ntherefore, to fractional calculus interpretations. Besides correlating Mellin\ntransform, non-local fractional derivatives and exploring the generalization\nfrom integer to real exponents and derivative orders, this fractional calculus\nresult may provide insights for physical interpretations on the asymptotic rise\nof $\\sigma_{tot}$.\n", "  We show that the equality of 2d $\\mathcal{N}$=(2,2) supersymmetric indices in\nSeiberg-type duality leads to a new integrable Ising-type model. The emergence\nof the new model is the result of correspondence between the supersymmetric\n$SU(2)$ quiver gauge theories and the Yang-Baxter equation. Using this\ncorrespondence, we solve the star-triangle relation and obtain the\ntwo-dimensional exactly solvable spin model. The model corresponding to our\nsolution possesses continuous spin variables on the circle and the Boltzmann\nweights are demonstrated in terms of Jacobi theta function. Using the solution\nof the star-triangle relation, we also construct interaction-round-a-face and\nvertex models.\n", "  Around 1920, Kaluza and Klein had the idea to add a fifth dimension to the\nclassical 4-dimensional spacetime of general relativity to create a geometric\ntheory of gravitation and electromagnetism. Today, theoretical evidences, like\nstring theory, suggest the need for a spacetime with more than five dimensions.\n  We want to present in this paper a mathematical structure generalizing the\nfiber bundle structure to the case of a product fiber of the form $F=S \\times\nW$, that enable the possible definition of multiple naturally defined fibers at\neach point of the manifold, on which therefore one can define objects that\ndepend only on one of the components of the global fiber.\n  Although we do not pretend here to model precisely other known physical\ninteractions, we present this geometric structure as a possible way to model or\nencode deviations from standard 4-dimensional General Relativity, or \"dark\"\neffects such as dark matter or energy ; (we refer to the authors' article [3]\n). Also this geometry was a starting point for the second author's new approach\nto a geometric unification of General Relativity and Quantum Physics ( see\n[23]).\n", "  The formulation of the laws of black hole mechanics assumes the stability of\nblack holes under perturbations in accordance with the \"cosmic censorship\nhypothesis\"(CCH). CCH prohibits the formation of a naked singularity by a\nphysical process from a regular black hole solution with an event horizon.\nEarlier studies show that naked singularities can indeed be formed leading to\nthe violation of CCH if a near-extremal black hole is injected with massive\ncharged particles and the back reaction effects are neglected. We investigate\nthe validity of CCH by considering the infall of charged massless particles as\nwell as a charged null shell. We also discuss the issue of third law of black\nhole mechanics in the presence of null charged particles by considering various\npossibilities.\n", "  We study the quantum reflection of ultracold antihydrogen atoms bouncing on\nthe surface of a liquid helium film. The Casimir-Polder potential and quantum\nreflection are calculated for different thicknesses of the film supported by\ndifferent substrates. Antihydrogen can be protected from anni- hilation for as\nlong as 1.3s on a bulk of liquid 4He, and 1.7s for liquid 3He. These large\nlifetimes open interesting perspectives for spectroscopic measurements of the\nfree fall acceleration of antihydrogen. Variation of the scattering length with\nthe thickness of a film of helium shows interferences which we interpret\nthrough a Liouville transformation of the quantum reflection problem.\n", "  We investigate the triggering of star formation and the formation of stellar\nclusters in molecular clouds that form as the ISM passes through spiral shocks.\nThe spiral shock compresses gas into $\\sim$100 pc long main star formation\nridge, where clusters forming every 5-10 pc along the merger ridge. We use a\ngravitational potential based cluster finding algorithm, which extracts\nindividual clusters, calculates their physical properties and traces cluster\nevolution over multiple time steps. Final cluster masses at the end of\nsimulation range between 1000 and 30000 M$_{\\odot}$ with their characteristic\nhalf-mass radii between 0.1 pc and 2 pc. These clusters form by gathering\nmaterial from 10-20 pc size scales. Clusters also show a mass - specific\nangular momentum relation, where more massive clusters have larger specific\nangular momentum due to the larger size scales, and hence angular momentum from\nwhich they gather their mass. The evolution shows that more massive clusters\nexperiences hierarchical merging process, which increases stellar age spreads\nup to 2-3 Myr. Less massive clusters appear to grow by gathering nearby\nrecently formed sinks, while more massive clusters with their large global\ngravitational potentials are increasing their mass growth from gas accretion.\n", "  We investigate Cu-doped Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ with transport,\nmagnetic susceptibility, and elastic neutron scattering measurements. In the\nheavily Cu-doped regime where long-range stripe-type antiferromagnetic order in\nBaFe$_2$As$_2$ is suppressed, Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (0.145 $\\leq x\n\\leq$ 0.553) samples exhibit spin-glass-like behavior in magnetic\nsusceptibility and insulating-like temperature dependence in electrical\ntransport. Using elastic neutron scattering, we find stripe-type short-range\nmagnetic order in the spin-glass region identified by susceptibility\nmeasurements. The persistence of short-range magnetic order over a large doping\nrange in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ likely arises from local arrangements\nof Fe and Cu that favor magnetic order, with Cu acting as vacancies relieving\nmagnetic frustration and degeneracy. These results indicate locally broken\nfour-fold rotational symmetry, suggesting that stripe-type magnetism is\nubiquitous in iron pnictides.\n", "  The origin of super-massive black holes in the early universe remains poorly\nunderstood.Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a\npromising initial process,but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the\nblack hole fast enough.We report numerical simulations of early black hole\nformation starting from realistic cosmological conditions.Supersonic gas\nmotions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until\nrapid gas condensation is triggered in a proto-galactic halo. A protostar is\nformed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass\naccretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses.The massive star ends its life\nwith a catastrophic collapse to leave a black hole -- a promising seed for the\nformation of a monstrous black hole.\n", "  In this series of lectures we give an introduction to the concept of\nasymptotic symmetry analysis with a focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes in\n2+1 dimensions. We explain general ideas of quantizing gauge theories and then\napply these ideas to gravity both in the metric as well as the Chern-Simons\nformulations. This enables one to compute the asymptotic symmetries of given\ngravitational configurations that in turn act as the basic underlying\nsymmetries of a possible dual quantum field theory in the context of\nholography. We also briefly elaborate on the concept of \"soft hair\" excitations\nof black holes in this context.\n", "  Major part of a pancreatic islet is composed of beta cells that secrete\ninsulin, a key hormone regulating influx of nutrients into all cells in a\nvertebrate organism to support nutrition, housekeeping or energy storage. Beta\ncells constantly communicate with each other using both direct, short-range\ninteractions through gap junctions, and paracrine long-range signaling.\nHowever, how these cell interactions shape collective sensing and cell behavior\nin islets that leads to insulin release is unknown. When stimulated by specific\nligands, primarily glucose, beta cells collectively respond with expression of\na series of transient Ca$^{2+}$ changes on several temporal scales. Here we\nanalyze a set of Ca$^{2+}$ spike trains recorded in acute rodent pancreatic\ntissue slice under physiological conditions. We found strongly correlated\nstates of co-spiking cells coexisting with mostly weak pairwise correlations\nwidespread across the islet. Furthermore, the collective Ca$^{2+}$ spiking\nactivity in islet shows on-off intermittency with scaling of spiking\namplitudes, and stimulus dependent autoassociative memory features. We use a\nsimple spin glass-like model for the functional network of a beta cell\ncollective to describe these findings and argue that Ca$^{2+}$ spike trains\nproduced by collective sensing of beta cells constitute part of the islet\nmetabolic code that regulates insulin release and limits the islet size.\n", "  Water is of the utmost importance for life and technology. However, a\ngenuinely predictive ab initio model of water has eluded scientists. We\ndemonstrate that a fully ab initio approach, relying on the strongly\nconstrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, provides such a\ndescription of water. SCAN accurately describes the balance among covalent\nbonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions that dictates the\nstructure and dynamics of liquid water. Notably, SCAN captures the density\ndifference between water and ice I{\\it h} at ambient conditions, as well as\nmany important structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of liquid water.\nThese successful predictions of the versatile SCAN functional open the gates to\nstudy complex processes in aqueous phase chemistry and the interactions of\nwater with other materials in an efficient, accurate, and predictive, ab initio\nmanner.\n", "  Hybrid integration of plasmonics and Si photonics is a promising architecture\nfor global microprocessor interconnects. To this end, practical plasmonic\ndevices not only should provide athermal, broadband operation over\nwavelength-scale footprint, but also support non-intrusive integration with\nlow-loss Si waveguides as well as CMOS back-end-of-line processes. Here, we\ndemonstrate a hybrid plasmonic photodetector with a single active junction\nfabricated via back-end deposited amorphous materials coupled to Si nanowires\nwith only 1.5dB loss. Utilizing internal photoemission, our detectors measured\nsensitivity of -35dBm in a 620nm by 5{\\mu}m footprint at 7V bias. Moreover,\nresponsivity up to 0.4mA/W and dark current down to 0.2nA were obtained. The\nhigh process tolerance is demonstrated between {\\lambda}=1.2-1.8{\\mu}m and up\nto 100{\\deg}C. The results suggest the potential towards plasmonic-photonic\noptoelectronic integration on top of Si chips without costly process\nmodifications.\n", "  We study energy transport in the paradigmatic Hamiltonian mean-field (HMF)\nmodel and other related long-range interacting models using molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We show that energy diffusion in the HMF model is subdiffusive in\nnature, which confirms a recently obtained intriguing result that, despite\nbeing globally interacting, this model is a thermal insulator in the thermo-\ndynamic limit. Surprisingly, when additional nearest neighbor interactions are\nintroduced to the HMF model, an energy superdiffusion is observed. We show that\nthese results can be consistently explained by studying energy localization due\nto thermally generated intrinsic localized excitation modes (discrete\nbreathers) in nonlinear discrete systems. Our analysis for the HMF model can\nalso be readily extended to more generic long-range interacting models where\nthe interaction strength decays algebraically with the (shortest) distance\nbetween two lattice sites. This reconciles many of the apparently\ncounter-intuitive results presented recently [C. Olivares and C. Anteneodo,\nPhys. Rev. E 94, 042117 (2016); D. Bagchi, Phys. Rev. E 95, 032102 (2017)]\nconcerning energy transport in two such long-range interacting models.\n", "  The World Wide Web (WWW) has fundamentally changed the ways billions of\npeople are able to access information. Thus, understanding how people seek\ninformation online is an important issue of study. Wikipedia is a hugely\nimportant part of information provision on the web, with hundreds of millions\nof users browsing and contributing to its network of knowledge. The study of\nnavigational behaviour on Wikipedia, due to the site's popularity and breadth\nof content, can reveal more general information seeking patterns that may be\napplied beyond Wikipedia and the Web. Our work addresses the relative\nshortcomings of existing literature in relating how information structure\ninfluences patterns of navigation online. We study aggregated clickstream data\nfor articles on the English Wikipedia in the form of a weighted, directed\nnavigational network. We introduce two parameters that describe how articles\nact to source and spread traffic through the network, based on their in/out\nstrength and entropy. From these, we construct a navigational phase space where\ndifferent article types occupy different, distinct regions, indicating how the\nstructure of information online has differential effects on patterns of\nnavigation. Finally, we go on to suggest applications for this analysis in\nidentifying and correcting deficiencies in the Wikipedia page network that may\nalso be adapted to more general information networks.\n", "  We study the directional excitation of optical surface waves controlled by\nthe magnetic field of light. We theoretically predict that a spinning magnetic\ndipole develops a tunable unidirectional coupling of light to TE-polarized\nBloch surface waves (BSWs). Experimentally, we show that the helicity of light\nprojected onto a subwavelength groove milled in the top layer of a 1D photonic\ncrystal (PC) controls the power distribution between two TE-polarized BSWs\nexcited on both sides of the groove. Such a phenomenon is shown to be mediated\nsolely by the helicity of the magnetic field of light, thus revealing a\nmagnetic spin-orbit interaction. Remarkably, this magnetic optical effect is\nclearly observed with a near-field coupler governed by an electric dipole\nmoment: it is of the same order of magnitude as the electric optical effects\ninvolved in the coupling. The magnetic spin-orbit interaction opens new degrees\nof freedom in the manipulation of light and offers appealing novel\nopportunities in the development of integrated optical functionalities.\n", "  Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, short pulse equation and complex short\npulse equation have important application in nonlinear optics. They can be\nderived from the Maxwell equation. In this paper, we investigate a coupled\nfocusing-defocusing complex short pulse equation.\n  The bright-bright, bright-dark and dark-dark soliton solutions of the coupled\nfocusing-defocusing complex short pulse equation are given.\n  Then the breathers are derived from the dark soliton solution. The rogue wave\nsolutions are also constructed.\n  The dynamics and the asymptotic behavior of the soliton solutions are\nanalyzed, which reveals that there exist the elastic or inelastic collision in\nbright-bright soliton solution. But the interactions of bright-dark and\ndark-dark soliton solutions are both elastic.\n", "  Understanding tie strength in social networks, and the factors that influence\nit, have received much attention in a myriad of disciplines for decades.\nSeveral models incorporating indicators of tie strength have been proposed and\nused to quantify relationships in social networks, and a standard set of\nstructural network metrics have been applied to predominantly online social\nmedia sites to predict tie strength. Here, we introduce the concept of the\n\"social bow tie\" framework, a small subgraph of the network that consists of a\ncollection of nodes and ties that surround a tie of interest, forming a\ntopological structure that resembles a bow tie. We also define several\nintuitive and interpretable metrics that quantify properties of the bow tie. We\nuse random forests and regression models to predict categorical and continuous\nmeasures of tie strength from different properties of the bow tie, including\nnodal attributes. We also investigate what aspects of the bow tie are most\npredictive of tie strength in two distinct social networks: a collection of 75\nrural villages in India and a nationwide call network of European mobile phone\nusers. Our results indicate several of the bow tie metrics are highly\npredictive of tie strength, and we find the more the social circles of two\nindividuals overlap, the stronger their tie, consistent with previous findings.\nHowever, we also find that the more tightly-knit their non-overlapping social\ncircles, the weaker the tie. This new finding complements our current\nunderstanding of what drives the strength of ties in social networks.\n", "  Interferometric interrogation technique realized for conventional fiber Bragg\ngrating (FBG) sensors is historically known to offer the highest sensitivity\nmeasurements, however, it has not been yet explored for {\\pi}-phase-shifted FBG\n({\\pi}FBG) sensors. This, we believe, is due to the complex nature of the\nreflection/transmission spectrum of a {\\pi}FBG, which cannot be directly used\nfor interferometric interrogation purpose. Therefore, we propose here an\ninnovative as well as simple concept towards this direction, wherein, the\ntransmission spectrum of a {\\pi}FBG sensor is optically filtered using a\nspecially designed fiber grating. The resulting filtered spectrum retains the\nentire characteristics of a {\\pi}FBG sensor and hence the filtered spectrum can\nbe interrogated with interferometric principles. Furthermore, due to the\nextremely narrow transmission notch of a {\\pi}FBG sensor, a fiber\ninterferometer can be realized with significantly longer path difference. This\nleads to substantially enhanced detection limit as compared to sensors based on\na regular FBG of similar length. Theoretical analysis demonstrate that high\nresolution weak dynamic strain measurement down to 4 p{\\epsilon}/sqrt(Hz) is\neasily achievable.\n", "  Epitaxial growth of atomically-sharp interfaces serves as one of the main\nbuilding blocks of nanofabrication. Such interfaces are crucial for the\noperation of various devices including transistors, photo-voltaic cells, and\nmemory components. In order to avoid charge traps that may hamper the operation\nof such devices, it is critical for the layers to be atomically-sharp.\nFabrication of atomically sharp interfaces normally requires ultra-high vacuum\ntechniques and high substrate temperatures. We present here a new self-limiting\nwet chemical process for deposition of epitaxial layers from alkoxide\nprecursors. This method is fast, cheap, and yields perfect interfaces as we\nvalidate by various analysis techniques. It allows the design of\nheterostructures with half-unit cell resolution. We demonstrate our method by\ndesigning hole-type oxide interfaces SrTiO3/BaO/LaAlO3. We show that transport\nthrough this interface exhibits properties of mixed electron-hole contributions\nwith hole mobility exceeding that of electrons. Our method and results are an\nimportant step forward towards a controllable design of a p-type oxide\ninterface.\n", "  We present results from deep (380 ks) \\textit{Chandra} observations of the\nAGN outburst in the massive early-type galaxy NGC 4472. We detect cavities in\nthe gas coincident with the radio lobes and estimate the eastern and western\nlobe enthalpy to be $(1.1 \\pm 0.5 )\\times 10^{56}$ erg and $(3 \\pm 1 )\\times\n10^{56}$ erg, and the average power required to inflate the lobes to be $(1.8\n\\pm 0.9)\\times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(6 \\pm 3)\\times 10^{41}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, respectively. We also detect enhanced X-ray rims around the radio\nlobes with sharp surface brightness discontinuities between the shells and the\nambient gas. The temperature of the gas in the shells is less than that of the\nambient medium, suggesting that they are not AGN-driven shocks but rather gas\nuplifted from the core by the buoyant rise of the radio bubbles. We estimate\nthe energy required to lift the gas to be up to $(1.1 \\pm 0.3 )\\times 10^{56}$\nerg and $(3 \\pm 1 )\\times 10^{56}$ erg for the eastern and western rim\nrespectively, constituting a significant fraction of the total outburst energy.\nA more conservative estimate suggests that the gas in the rim was uplifted a\nsmaller distance, requiring only $20-25\\%$ of this energy. In either case, if a\nsignificant fraction of this uplift energy is thermalized via hydrodynamic\ninstabilities or thermal conduction, our results suggest that it could be an\nimportant source of heating in cool core clusters and groups. We also find\nevidence for a central abundance drop in NGC 4472. The iron abundance profile\nshows that the region along the cavity system has a lower metallicity than the\nsurrounding, undisturbed gas, similar to the central region. This also shows\nthat bubbles have lifted low-metallicity gas from the center.\n", "  The dispersion of nitride and carbide ceramic particles in water is\ndifficult, due to the absence of hydroxyl groups on their surface. Boron\nnitride is not an exception and despite its numerous applications, no effective\ndispersant has been identified so far. We demonstrate here the dispersion\nproperties of two cellulose derivatives for hexagonal boron nitride powders,\nhydroxyl ethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose. The effect of particle sizes and\ncellulose concentration was investigated. The adsorption of cellulose onto the\nsurface of the BN particles was confirmed by isotherm adsorption. Zeta\npotential measurements shows a charge screening effect of the cellulose The\nsuspensions obtained were highly loaded and stable versus pH, and thus could\nlead to homogeneous codispersion of BN particles and sintering additives.\n", "  Novel plasma-clustered deposition technique, called PVD Droplets, as well as\nits main principles of operation were described. New types of obtained thick,\nover 20 {\\mu}m, functional coatings basing on Ta and Zr have been presented.\nResults of research in physic-chemical properties of the coating materials are\nlisted including preliminary studies of superconductive properties. Comparative\nevaluation between of obtained coatings and sample CVD coating was made.\n", "  We use a semi-empirical model to reproduce the 0.1-10um spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of a sample of 85 luminous quasars. In the model, the\ncontinuum emission from the accretion disk as well as the nebular lines are\nrepresented by a single empirical template (disk), where differences in the\noptical spectral index are reproduced by varying the amount of extinction. The\nnear- and mid-infrared emission of the AGN-heated dust is modelled as the\ncombination of two black-bodies (dust). The model fitting shows that the disk\nand dust components are remarkably uniform among individual quasars, with\ndifferences in the observed SED largely accounted for by varying levels of\nobscuration in the disk as well as differences in the relative luminosity of\nthe disk and dust components. By combining the disk-subtracted SEDs of the 85\nquasars, we generate a template for the 1-10um emission of the AGN-heated dust.\nAdditionally, we use a sample of local Seyfert 1 galaxies with full\nspectroscopic coverage in the 0.37um to 39um range to demonstrate a method for\nstitching together spectral segments obtained with different PSF and extraction\napertures. We show that the disk and dust templates obtained from luminous\nquasars also reproduce the optical-to-mid-infrared spectra of local Seyfert 1s\nwhen the contribution from the host galaxy is properly subtracted.\n", "  This work demonstrates the Nd:YAG waveguide laser as an efficient platform\nfor the bio-sensing. The waveguide was fabricated in the Nd:YAG crystal by the\ncooperation of the ultrafast laser writing and ion irradiation. As the laser\noscillation in the Nd:YAG waveguide is ultra-sensitivity to the external\nenvironment of the waveguide. Even a weak disturbance would induce a large\nvariation of the output power of the laser. According to this feature, the\nNd:YAG waveguide coated with Graphene and WSe2 layers is used as substrate for\nthe microfluidic channel. When the microflow crosses the Nd:YAG waveguide, the\nlaser oscillation in the waveguide is disturbed, and induces the fluctuation of\nthe output laser. Through the analysis of the fluctuation, the concentration of\nthe dextrose solution and the size of the tumor cell are distinguished\n", "  Modern physics has unlocked a number of mysteries regarding the early\nUniverse, such as the baryogenesis, the unification of the strong and\nelectroweak forces and the nucleosynthesis. However, understanding the very\nearly Universe, close to the Planck epoch, still presents a major challenge.\nThe theory of inflation, which is assumed to have taken place towards the end\nof the very early Universe, has been introduced in order to solve a number of\ncosmological problems. However, concrete observational evidence for inflation\nis still outstanding and the physical mechanisms behind inflation remain mostly\nunknown. In this paper we argue for inflation from a different standpoint. In\norder for time to have any concrete physical meaning in the very early and the\nearly Universe, the capacity of the Universe to measure time - its size or,\nequivalently, memory - must be at least as large as the number of clock \"ticks\"\nthat need to be recorded somewhere within the Universe. Using this simple\ncriterion, we provide a sketch proof showing that in the absence of inflation\nthe subsystems of the Universe might not have been able to undertake the\nsynchronised evolution described by the time we use today.\n", "  The mass of the top quark is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model\nand has to be determined experimentally. In these proceedings, I review recent\ndirect measurements of the top quark mass in $p\\bar p$ collisions at $\\sqrt\ns=1.96$ TeV recorded by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron. The measurements are\nperformed in final states containing one and two charged leptons. I will\npresent the legacy combination of all top quark mass measurements from the D0\nexperiment and their combination with results from the CDF experiment. A\nrelative precision of down to 0.3\\% is attained.\n", "  Laser irradiation of various materials including metals, polymers and\nsemiconductors with vortex beams was previously shown to twist transiently\nmolten matter providing the direct easy-to-implement way to obtain chiral\nsurface relief. Specifically for metals, this effect was attributed to transfer\nof an optical angular momentum (OAM) carrying by the vortex beam. In this\nLetter, we report the formation of twisted metal nanoneedles on the surface of\nsilver and gold metal films under their irradiation with zero-OAM laser beam\nhaving spiral-shape lateral intensity distribution. Our comparative experiments\nclearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the formation process of chiral\nnanoneedles on the surface of plasmonic-active metals is mainly governed by the\ntemperature-gradient induced chiral thermocapillary mass transfer rather that\nthe OAM driven rotation of the transiently molten matter.\n", "  Due to the large production cross-section, many of the top quark properties\ncan be measured very precisely at the LHC. A very few recent results, probed\nonly through the top quark decay vertices are presented here. These results are\nbased on proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments at sqrt(s)=7, 8 and 13 TeV. All the measurements and observed\nlimits are consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions, while strong\nbounds on anomalous Wtb couplings are established.\n", "  We present a versatile rf pulse control system that has been designed for\nmulti-qubit quantum experiments. One instrument can be scaled to provide 32\nchannels of rf between 10 - 450 MHz. Synchronization can be achieved across\nmultiple instruments. By using direct digital synthesis and custom control\ncircuitry contained within a field-programmable gate array, sequences of\ntransform-limited pulses can be produced. These have been used to carry out\nquantum gates that are able to meet fault-tolerant thresholds for single- and\ntwo-qubit gate fidelities, as published elsewhere. We have also extended the\nfrequency to the gigahertz regime using additional mixers to address hyperfine\ntransitions in atomic systems. The system uses an efficient memory management\nscheme and a low-latency communications protocol that allows pulse sequences to\nbe updated in real-time. Together these can enable outcome-based algorithms\nsuch as quantum error correction to be executed. The system is fully\nprogrammable in C++, and other languages such as Python can be supported by the\non-board CPU, offering a highly flexible platform for a wide variety of\nexperimental systems, and has been proven in trapped-ion quantum information\nexperiments.\n", "  The HAWC (High Altitude Water Cherenkov) gamma ray observatory is able to\nobserve muons with nearly horizontal trajectories. HAWC is located at an\naltitude of 4100 meters a.s.l. on the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico. The HAWC\ndetector is composed of 300 water tanks, each 7.3 m in diameter and 4.5 m tall,\ndensely packed over a physical area of 22,000 m$^{2}$. Previous and current\nexperiments have observed high zenith angle (near horizontal) muons at or near\nsea level. HAWC operates as a hodoscope able to observe multi-TeV muons at\nzenith angles greater than 75 degrees. This is the first experiment to measure\nnear horizontal muons at high altitude and with large ($\\geq$ 10 m) separations\nfor multiple muons. These muons are distinguishable from extensive air showers\nby observing near horizontal particles propagating with the speed of light. The\nproximity of Sierra Negra and Pico de Orizaba volcanoes provides an additional\nmeasurement of muons with rock overburdens of several km water equivalent. We\nwill present the angular distribution and rate at which HAWC observes these\nmuon events\n", "  Dark matter axions can generate peculiar effects in special types of\nJosephson junctions, so-called SNS junctions. One can show that the axion field\nequations in a Josephson environment allow for very small oscillating\nsupercurrents, which manifest themselves as a tiny wiggle in the I-V curve, a\nso-called Shapiro step, which occurs at a frequency given by the axion mass.\nThe effect is very small but perfectly measurable in modern nanotechnological\ndevices. In this paper I will summarize the theory and then present evidence\nthat candidate Shapiro steps of this type have indeed been seen in several\nindependent condensed matter experiments. Assuming the observed tiny Shapiro\nsteps are due to axion flow then these data point to an axion mass of $(106 \\pm\n6)\\mu$eV, consistent with what is expected for the QCD axion. In addition to\nthe above small Shapiro resonance effects at frequencies in the GHz region one\nalso expects to see broad-band noise effects at much lower frequencies. Overall\nthis approach provides a novel pathway for the future design of new types of\naxionic dark matter detectors. The resonant Josephson data summarized in this\npaper are consistent with a 'vanilla' axion with a coupling constant\n$f_a=\\sqrt{v_{EW}m_{Pl}}=5.48 \\cdot 10^{10}$GeV given by the geometric average\nof the electroweak symmetry breaking scale $v_{EW}$ and the Planck mass\n$m_{Pl}$.\n", "  Inspired by ancient astronomy, we propose a holographic description of\nperturbative scattering amplitudes, as integrals over a `celestial sphere'.\nSince Lorentz invariance, local interactions, and particle propagations all\ntake place in a four-dimensional space-time, it is not trivial to accommodate\nthem in a lower-dimensional `celestial sphere'. The details of this task will\nbe discussed step by step, resulting in the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) and similar\nscattering amplitudes, thereby providing them with a holographic non-string\ninterpretation.\n", "  In this article, we construct two-dimensional integrable and superintegrable\nsys- tems in terms of the master function formalism and relate them to\nMielnik;s and Marquette;s construction in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. For\ntwo diferent cases of the master functions, we obtain two diferent\ntwo-dimensional superintegrable systems with higher order integrals of motion.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are the living fossils with records of\nchemical enrichment history at the early epoch of galaxy formation. By the\nrecent large observation campaigns, statistical samples of EMP stars have been\nobtained. This motivates us to reconsider their classification and formation\nconditions. From the observed lower-limits of carbon and iron abundances of\nAcr(C) ~ 6 and [Fe/H]cr ~ -5 for C-enhanced EMP (CE-EMP) and C-normal EMP\n(CN-EMP) stars, we confirm that gas cooling by dust thermal emission is\nindispensable for the fragmentation of their parent clouds to form such\nlow-mass, i.e., long-lived stars, and that the dominant grain species are\ncarbon and silicate, respectively. We constrain the grain radius r_i^{cool} of\na species i and condensation efficiency f_{ij} of a key element j as\nr_C^{cool}/f_{C, C} = 10 um and r_Sil^{cool}/f_{Sil, Mg} = 0.1 um to reproduce\nAcr(C) and [Fe/H]cr, which give a universal condition 10^{[C/H]-2.30} +\n10^[Fe/H] > 10^{-5.07} for the formation of every EMP star. Instead of the\nconventional boundary [C/Fe] = 0.7 between CE- and CN-EMP stars, this condition\nsuggests a physically meaningful boundary [C/Fe]_{b} = 2.30 above and below\nwhich carbon and silicate grains are dominant coolants, respectively.\n", "  Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are known to be chemically\ndiverse. In this paper we present the first observational evidence of a star\nthat has failed the third dredge-up (TDU). J005252.87-722842.9 is a A-type\n($T_{\\rm eff}$ = 8250 $\\pm$ 250K) luminous (8200 $\\pm$ 700 $\\rm L_{\\odot}$),\nmetal-poor ($\\textrm{[Fe/H]}$ = $- 1.18 \\pm$ 0.10), low-mass (M$_{\\rm initial}$\n$\\approx$ 1.5 $-$ 2.0 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$) post-AGB star in the Small Magellanic\nCloud. Through a systematic abundance study, using high-resolution optical\nspectra from UVES, we found that this likely post-AGB object shows an\nintriguing photospheric composition with no confirmed carbon-enhancement (upper\nlimit of [C/Fe] $<$ 0.50) nor enrichment of $s$-process elements. We derived an\noxygen abundance of [O/Fe] = 0.29 $\\pm$ 0.1. For Fe and O, we took into account\nthe effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). We could not derive\nan upper limit for the nitrogen abundance as there are no useful nitrogen lines\nwithin our spectral coverage. The chemical pattern displayed by this object has\nnot been observed in single or binary post-AGBs. Based on its derived stellar\nparameters and inferred evolutionary state, single star nucleosynthesis models\npredict that this star should have undergone TDU episodes while on the AGB and\nbe carbon-enriched. However, our observations are in contrast with these\npredictions. We identify two possible Galactic analogues which are likely to be\npost-AGB stars, but the lack of accurate distances (hence luminosities) to\nthese objects does not allow us to confirm their post-AGB status. If they have\nlow luminosities then they are likely to be dusty post-RGB stars. The discovery\nof J005252.87-722842.9 reveals a new stellar evolutionary channel whereby a\nstar evolves without any third dredge-up episodes.\n", "  Bayesian inference for models that have an intractable partition function is\nknown as a doubly intractable problem, where standard Monte Carlo methods are\nnot applicable. The past decade has seen the development of auxiliary variable\nMonte Carlo techniques (M{\\o}ller et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2006) for\ntackling this problem; these approaches being members of the more general class\nof pseudo-marginal, or exact-approximate, Monte Carlo algorithms (Andrieu and\nRoberts, 2009), which make use of unbiased estimates of intractable posteriors.\nEveritt et al. (2017) investigated the use of exact-approximate importance\nsampling (IS) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in doubly intractable problems,\nbut focussed only on SMC algorithms that used data-point tempering. This paper\ndescribes SMC samplers that may use alternative sequences of distributions, and\ndescribes ways in which likelihood estimates may be improved adaptively as the\nalgorithm progresses, building on ideas from Moores et al. (2015). This\napproach is compared with a number of alternative algorithms for doubly\nintractable problems, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which\nwe show is closely related to the method of M{\\o}ller et al. (2006).\n", "  We study a spinless fermion lattice model that has ${\\cal{N}}=2$\nsupersymmetry given by Hermann Nicolai. We show that high degeneracy of\nsupersymmetric ground states of the Nicolai model is associated to breakdown of\nlocal fermion symmetries hidden in the model.\n", "  We report a novelly universal scheme for design of a grazing incidence\nspectrometer, which creates an excellent meridional flat field in its detector\ndomain to deliver the desired spectral resolution throughout the full\ndesignated spectral range, while eliminates the sagittal astigmatism to enhance\nthe spectral intensity simultaneously. The intrinsic optical properties of the\nsystem are thoroughly investigated and optimized, especially how the detector\nplane approaches to the actual meridional or sagittal focal curves is well\nquantified. We demonstrated within the \"water window\", i.e. 2-5nm wavelength\nrange, the resolving power of 6000-18000 could be achieved for the effective\nmeridional source size of 200um r.m.s.; and it would be further improved to\n20000-40000 if the source size is confined down to 50um r.m.s.\n", "  Although extensive efforts have been put into the development of porous\nscaffolds for bone regeneration, with encouraging results, all porous materials\nhave a common limitation: the inherent lack of strength associated with\nporosity. Hence, the development of porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds has been\nhindered to non-load bearing applications. We report here how freeze-casting\ncan be applied to synthesize porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds exhibiting\nunusually high compressive strength, e.g. up to 145 MPa for 47% porosity and 65\nMPa for 56% porosity. The materials are characterized by well-defined pore\nconnectivity along with directional and completely open porosity. Various\nparameters affecting the porosity and compressive strength have been\ninvestigated, including initial slurry concentration, freezing rate, and\nsintering conditions. The implications and potential application as bone\nsubstitute are discussed. These results might open the way for\nhydroxyapatite-based materials designed for load-bearing applications. The\nbiological response of these materials is yet to be tested.\n", "  We overview physical effects of exchange frustration and quantum spin\nfluctuations in (quasi-) two dimensional (2D) quantum magnets ($S=1/2$) with\nsquare, rectangular and triangular structure. Our discussion is based on the\n$J_1$-$J_2$ type frustrated exchange model and its generalizations. These\nmodels are closely related and allow to tune between different phases,\nmagnetically ordered as well as more exotic nonmagnetic quantum phases by\nchanging only one or two control parameters. We survey ground state properties\nlike magnetization, saturation fields, ordered moment and structure factor in\nthe full phase diagram as obtained from numerical exact diagonalization\ncomputations and analytical linear spin wave theory. We also review finite\ntemperature properties like susceptibility, specific heat and magnetocaloric\neffect using the finite temperature Lanczos method. This method is powerful to\ndetermine the exchange parameters and g-factors from experimental results. We\nfocus mostly on the observable physical frustration effects in magnetic phases\nwhere plenty of quasi-2D material examples exist to identify the influence of\nquantum fluctuations on magnetism.\n", "  The dynamics of double hard scattering in proton-proton collisions is quite\ninvolved compared with the familiar case of single hard scattering. In this\ncontribution, we review our theoretical understanding of double hard scattering\nand of its interplay with other reaction mechanisms.\n", "  This note presents search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in $WW$,\n$\\tau\\tau$ and $\\mu\\mu$ decay channels with the proton-proton collision data\ncollected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results have been derived using\ndifferent amounts of luminosities for different channels.\n", "  A specialized stress equipment has been developed for EPR X-band experiments.\nUniaxial stress experiments in EPR of different impurity ions in SrTiO3 and\nBaTiO3 will be reviewed.\n", "  In this paper we study a proposal of Nekrasov, Rosly and Shatashvili that\ndescribes the effective twisted superpotential obtained from a class S theory\ngeometrically as a generating function in terms of certain complexified\nlength-twist coordinates, and extend it to higher rank. First, we introduce a\nhigher rank analogue of Fenchel-Nielsen type spectral networks in terms of a\ngeneralized Strebel condition. We find new systems of spectral coordinates\nthrough the abelianization method and argue that they are higher rank analogues\nof the Nekrasov-Rosly-Shatashvili Darboux coordinates. Second, we give an\nexplicit parametrization of the locus of opers and determine the generating\nfunctions of this Lagrangian subvariety in terms of the higher rank Darboux\ncoordinates in some specific examples. We find that the generating functions\nindeed agree with the known effective twisted superpotentials. Last, we relate\nthe approach of Nekrasov, Rosly and Shatashvili to the approach using quantum\nperiods via the exact WKB method.\n", "  The tetragonal to monoclinic (t-m) phase transformation of zirconia has been\nthe object of extensive investigations of the last twenty years, and is now\nrecognised as being of martensitic nature. However, martensitic transformation\nhas only been observed by transmission electron microscopy or indirect methods.\nThough the benefit on the fracture toughness and crack resistance was the main\ninterest, the transformation is now considered for its consequences on the\ndegradation of the material. The use of AFM reported here allowed the\nobservation of the first stages of martensite relief growth and of new\nmartensitic features.\n", "  A recent report [S. Deville et al., J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 86(12), 2225 (2003)]\nhas shown the new possibilities offered by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to\ninvestigate martensitic transformation induced relief in zirconia. In this\npaper, we studied qualitatively the surface relief resulting from martensitic\ntetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation in yttria and ceria-doped\nzirconia by AFM. AFM appears as a very powerful tool to investigate martensite\nrelief with a great precision. The phenomenological theory of martensitic\ncrystallography could be succesfully applied to explain all the observed\nfeatures. The formation conditions of the martensite are discussed, as well as\nways of accommodating locally the transformation strain, i.e.\nself-accommodating variant pairs and microcracking. Variants growth sequences\nare observed. These observations bring new insights and explanations on the\ntransformation initiation and propagation sequences.\n", "  This article presents the effect of the presence of solid contaminants, in\nengine lubricating oil, on the tribological parameters, which impact negatively\non the performance of the engine and increase fuel consumption. This study\nrevealed that the lubricant was contaminated by Fe, Cu, Al, Pb and SiO2\nparticles. The tribological tests were performed using 0.63, 0.85 and 1.1 m s-1\naverage sliding speeds and 120 N contact load to mimic the boundary lubrication\nregime of the sliding reciprocating motion of the piston ring/liner interface\nin an engine. The presence of the solid contaminants in engine oils leads to an\nincrease in friction coefficient, wear and frictional power losses, increasing\nthe surfaces roughness as a consequence. The results showed that grain size and\nconcentrations strongly affected the tribological parameters. In order to\nminimize the effect of solid contaminants, it is necessary to improve the\nfiltration accuracy for lubricating oils.\n", "  Since the recent failure events of two particular series of zirconia femoral\nheads for total hip replacement prosthesis, a large decrease in the use of\nzirconia ceramics for orthopaedic implants has been observed. In spite of the\nbiomedical success of this material during the last ten years, this was\nrequired for safety reasons, until the cause of the failures is known. It has\nbeen shown that these failures were related to the low temperature hydrothermal\ndegradation (also known as ageing). Thus it is crucial to better understand the\nageing behaviour, in order to be able to assess its importance and then control\nit if required. In this paper, various techniques relevant to assess the\nhydrothermal degradation sensitivity of biomedical grade yttria stabilized\nzirconia are discussed and compared. The expected outputs of conventional\nmethods, i.e. X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy are examined.\nMore recent methods like optical interferometry and atomic force microscopy are\npresented, with their respective benefits and drawbacks. An up to date\ncomparison of these different techniques is provided, and their use for\nensuring the long term reliability of a particular batch of zirconia in terms\nof ageing degradation is demonstrated.\n", "  We present an ab-initio study of the temperature-dependent longitudinal and\nanomalous Hall resistivities in the compensated collinear ferrimagnet\nMn$_{1.5}$V$_{0.5}$FeAl. Its transport properties are calculated using the\ngeneral fully relativistic Kubo--Bastin formalism and their temperature\ndependency is accounted for magnetic and structural disorder. Both scattering\nsources, together with the residual chemical disorder, were treated equally\nprovided by the CPA (Coherent Potential Approximation) SPR-KKR (Spin-Polarized\nRelativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker) method. All calculated properties showed\ngood agreement with a recent experimental results, providing useful specific\ninformation on the chemical and magnetic arrangement as well as on the\ninfluence of disorder. Finally, we demonstrated that the anomalous Hall effect\nin such compensated systems occurs regardless of the vanishing net spin moment.\n", "  Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (3Y-TZP) with different\nmicrostructures were elaborated. The isothermal tetragonal to monoclinic\ntransformation was investigated at 134 {\\deg}C in steam by X-ray diffraction,\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and optical interferometry. The aging kinetics\nwere analyzed in terms of nucleation and growth, using the Mehl-Avrami-Johnson\n(MAJ) formalism. Numerical simulation of the aging of zirconia surfaces was\nalso conducted, and the results were used to better fit the aging kinetics. The\nsimulation shows that the exponent of the MAJ laws is controlled not only by\nthe nucleation and growth mechanisms, but also - and mainly - by their\nrespective kinetic parameters. Measurements of nucleation and growth rates at\nthe surface, at the beginning of aging, and the use of numerical simulation\nallow the accurate prediction of aging kinetics.\n", "  A perturbative analytic operator solution of a completely quantum mechanical\nHamiltonian of multi-photon pump non-degenerate hyper-Raman process is\nobtained. It is shown that the obtained solution is general in nature as the\nsolutions of non-degenerate hyper-Raman and stimulated Raman processes can be\nobtained as special cases of the present solution. The analytic solutions\nobtained here are used to investigate the nonclassical properties of the\ndifferent modes in the stimulated, spontaneous and partially spontaneous\nmulti-photon pump non-degenerate hyper-Raman processes. The nonclassical nature\nof these processes is witnessed by means of single mode and intermodal\nquadrature squeezing, intermodal entanglement of different orders, lower order\nand higher order photon antibunching. Interestingly, manifesting the\nmultiphoton nature of the pump modes, a bunch of nonclassicality involving them\nare observed due to self-interaction of various pump modes.\n", "  We present the results of our long-term photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations at the Russian-Turkish RTT-150 telescope for the optical\ncounterpart to one of the best-known sources, representatives of the class of\nfast X-ray transients, IGR J17544-2619. Based on our optical data, we have\ndetermined for the first time the orbital and physical parameters of the binary\nsystem by the methods of Doppler spectroscopy. We have computed theoretical\nspectra of the optical counterpart by applying non-LTE corrections for selected\nlines and obtained the parameters of the stellar atmosphere and the optical\nstar ($T_{\\rm eff}=33\\,000$ K, $\\log\\,g=3.85$, $R=9.5\\ R_{\\odot},$ and $M=23\\\nM_{\\odot}$). The latter suggest that the optical star is not a supergiant as\nhas been thought previously.\n", "  We discuss the uniform shear flow of a fluidized granular bed composed of\nmonodisperse Hertzian spheres. Considering high densities around the glass\ntransition density of inelastic Hertzian spheres, we report kinetic theory\nexpressions for the Newtonian viscosity as well as the Bagnold coefficient. We\ndiscuss the dependence of the transport coefficients on density and coefficient\nof restitution.\n", "  The students build and use an old navigational tool from the Arab world of\nthe 9th century, the kamal. After an introduction to historic seafaring and\nnavigation, they build this simple tool and understand how it can be used to\nmeasure angles. After learning that the elevation of Polaris is (almost)\nidentical to the latitude of the observer, they apply this knowledge while\nusing the kamal. During a field trip, they actually measure the elevation of\nPolaris. The result is compared with modern methods.\n", "  We study a Hamiltonian system of type describing a charged particle resonant\ninteraction with an electromagnetic wave. We consider an ensemble of particles\nthat repeatedly pass through the resonance with the wave, and study evolution\nof the distribution function due to multiple scatterings on the resonance and\ntrappings (captures) into the resonance. We derive the corresponding kinetic\nequation. Particular cases of this problem has been studied in our recent\npapers [1, 2].\n", "  Research has established increased engagement and positive behavioral,\nattitudinal, and learning outcomes from educational games. Although engagement\nbegets these benefits, there is a lack of research on how students engage with\neducational games, especially when self-directed. Additionally, research on the\neffects of engagement on performance is conflicting. This study aimed to\nidentify barriers to students' self-directed engagement with two anatomy\neducational games, methods to overcome identified barriers, and the impact of\nengagement on learning performance. Employing the within-case and cross-case\napproach and triangulation of data, four educational-game specific barriers\nemerged (from most common to least common): 1) negative perceptions of\neducational games, 2) incompatible audience, 3) incompatible difficulty, and 4)\nprice. Path analysis found that engagement may have insignificant, positive\neffects on performance. These findings indicate that students' self-directed\nengagement with educational games is impeded by unique barriers and engagement\nmay not be vital for performance. Suggestions for game design and marketing\nemerged to help developers, teachers, and researchers overcome identified\nbarriers.\n", "  In this review, I reflect on four decades of my experience in linking\nastronomy research and education by supervising variable-star research projects\nby undergraduates, and by outstanding senior high school students. I describe\nthe evolution of my experience, the students I have supervised, the nature of\ntheir projects, the educational contexts of the projects, the need for \"best\npractices\", the journals in which we publish, and the special role of the\nAmerican Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). I then describe our\nrecent research on pulsating red giants and related objects, including three\nastrophysical mysteries that we have uncovered. Finally, I suggest how my\nprojects might be scaled up or extended by others who supervise student\nresearch.\n", "  A bare description of the seminal quantum algorithm devised by Deutsch could\nmean more than an introduction to quantum computing. It could contribute to\nopening the field to interdisciplinary research.\n", "  We calculate the two-mass contribution to the 3-loop vacuum polarization of\nthe gluon in Quantum Chromodynamics at virtuality $p^2 = 0$ for general masses\nand also present the analogous result for the photon in Quantum\nElectrodynamics.\n", "  Rare earth elements recycling has been proposed to alleviate supply risks and\nmarket volatility. In this context, the potential of a new recycling pathway,\nnamely plasma mass separation, is uncovered through the example of nedodymium -\niron - boron magnets recycling. Plasma mass separation is shown to address some\nof the shortcomings of existing rare earth elements recycling pathways, in\nparticular detrimental environmental effects. A simplified mass separation\nmodel suggests that plasma separation performances could compare favourably\nwith existing recycling options. In addition, simple energetic considerations\nof plasma processing suggest that the cost of these techniques may not be\nprohibitive, particularly considering that energy costs from solar may become\nsignificantly cheaper. Further investigation and experimental demonstration of\nplasma separation techniques should permit asserting the potential of these\ntechniques against other recycling techniques currently under development.\n", "  We have recently proposed a new regularization framework based on the\nloop-tree duality theorem. This theorem allows to rewrite loop level amplitudes\nin terms of tree-level structures and phase-space integrations. In consequence,\nit is possible to combine naturally real and virtual contributions at integrand\nlevel. Moreover, through the introduction of a proper momentum-mapping, a\ncomplete local cancellation of infrared singularities is achieved, by-passing\nthe necessity of counter-terms. In this article, we briefly explain the\nimplementation of this novel approach to compute some physical processes, and\nwe show how to deal with both infrared and ultraviolet divergences without\nusing DREG.\n", "  This work is devoted to the consistent modeling of a three-phase mixture of a\ngas, a liquid and its vapor. Since the gas and the vapor are mis-cible, the\nmixture is subjected to a non-symmetric constraint on the volume. Adopting the\nGibbs formalism, the study of the extensive equilibrium entropy of the system\nallows to recover the Dalton's law between the two gaseous phases. In addition,\nwe distinguish whether phase transition occurs or not between the liquid and\nits vapor. The thermodynamical equilibria are described both in extensive and\nintensive variables. In the latter case, we focus on the geometrical properties\nof equilibrium entropy. The consistent characterization of the thermodynamics\nof the three-phase mixture is used to introduce two Homogeneous Equilibrium\nModels (HEM) depending on mass transfer is taking into account or not.\nHyperbolicity is investigated while analyzing the entropy structure of the\nsystems. Finally we propose two Homogeneous Relaxation Models (HRM) for the\nthree-phase mixtures with and without phase transition. Supplementary equations\non mass, volume and energy fractions are considered with appropriate source\nterms which model the relaxation towards the thermodynamical equilibrium, in\nagreement with entropy growth criterion.\n", "  This research aimed to identify indications of scientific literacy resulting\nfrom a didactic and investigative interaction with Google Trends Big Data\nsoftware by first-year students from a high-school in Novo Hamburgo, Southern\nBrazil. Both teaching strategies and research interpretations lie on four\ntheoretical backgrounds. Firstly, Bunge's epistemology, which provides a\nthorough characterization of Science that was central to our study. Secondly,\nthe conceptual framework of scientific literacy of Fives et al. that makes our\nteaching focus precise and concise, as well as supports one of our\nmethodological tool: the SLA (scientific literacy assessment). Thirdly, the\n\"crowdledge\" construct from dos Santos, which gives meaning to our study when\nas it makes the development of scientific literacy itself versatile for paying\nattention on sociotechnological and epistemological contemporary phenomena.\nFinally, the learning principles from Papert's Constructionism inspired our\neducational activities. Our educational actions consisted of students, divided\ninto two classes, investigating phenomena chose by them. A triangulation\nprocess to integrate quantitative and qualitative methods on the assessments\nresults was done. The experimental design consisted in post-tests only and the\nexperimental variable was the way of access to the world. The experimental\ngroup interacted with the world using analyses of temporal and regional plots\nof interest of terms or topics searched on Google. The control class did\n'placebo' interactions with the world through on-site observations of\nbryophytes, fungus or whatever in the schoolyard. As general results of our\nresearch, a constructionist environment based on Big Data analysis showed\nitself as a richer strategy to develop scientific literacy, compared to a free\nschoolyard exploration.\n", "  Solution-processed organic semiconductors enable the fabrication of\nlarge-area and flexible electronics by means of cost-effective, solution-based\nmass manufacturing techniques. However, for many applications an insoluble\nactive layer can offer technological advantages in terms of robustness to\nprocessing solvents. This is particularly relevant in field-effect transistors\n(FET), where processing of dielectrics or barriers from solution on top of the\nsemiconductor layer typically imposes the use of orthogonal solvents in order\nnot to interfere with the nanometer thick accumulation channel. To this end,\nthe use of latent pigments, highly soluble molecules which can produce\ninsoluble films after a post-deposition thermal cleavage of solubilizing\ngroups, is a very promising strategy. In this contribution, we demonstrate the\nuse of tert-Butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) functionalized diketopyrrolopyrrole and\nperylene-diimide small molecules for good hole and electron transporting films.\nt-Boc thermal cleavage produces a densification of the films, along with a\nstrong structural rearrangement of the deprotected molecules, strongly\nimproving charge mobility in both p- and n-type FET. We also highlight the\nrobustness of these highly insoluble semiconducting layers to typical and\naggressive processing solvents. These results can greatly enhance the degree of\nfreedom in the manufacturing of multi-layered organic electronic devices,\noffering enhanced stability to harsh processing steps.\n", "  The simplest integrands in the CHY formulation of scattering amplitudes are\nconstructed using the so-called Parke-Taylor functions. Parke-Taylor functions\nalso turn out to belong to a large class of rational functions known as MHV\nleading singularities. In fact, Parke-Taylor functions correspond to planar MHV\nleading singularities. In this note we study the behavior of CHY integrands\nconstructed using non-planar MHV leading singularities under collinear and\nmulti-particle factorization limits. General $n$-particle MHV leading\nsingularities are completely characterized by a set of $(n-2)$ triples of\nparticle labels. We give a simple operation on this combinatorial data which\n\"factors\" the list into two sets of triples defining two lower point MHV\nleading singularities. The fact that general MHV leading singularities form a\nclosed set under \"multi-particle factorizations\" is surprising from their gauge\ntheoretic origin.\n", "  We combine theory, numerical calculations, and experiments to accurately\npredict the motion of anisotropic particles in shallow microfluidic channels,\nin which the particles are strongly confined in the vertical direction. We\nformulate an effective quasi-two-dimensional description of the Stokes flow\naround the particle via the Brinkman equation, which can be solved in a time\nthat is two orders of magnitude faster than the three-dimensional problem. The\ncomputational speedup enables us to calculate the full trajectories of\nparticles in the channel. To test our scheme, we study the motion of\ndumbbell-shaped particles that are produced in a microfluidic channel using\n`continuous flow lithography'. Contrary to what was reported in earlier work\n(Uspal et al., Nature communications 4 (2013)), we find that the reorientation\ntime of a dumbbell particle in an external flow exhibits a minimum as a\nfunction of its disk size ratio. This finding is in excellent agreement with\nnew experiments, thus confirming the predictive power of our scheme.\n", "  As quantum devices scale up, many-body quantum gates and algorithms begin to\nsurpass what is possible to simulate classically. Validation methods which rely\non such classical simulation, such as process tomography and randomized\nbenchmarking, cannot efficiently check correctness of most of the processes\ninvolved. In particular non-Clifford gates are a requirement for not only\nuniversal quantum computation but for any algorithm or quantum simulation that\nyields fundamental speedup in comparison with its classical counterpart. We\nshow that it is in fact still possible to validate such non-simulable processes\nby taking advantage of expected or engineered conservations laws in the system,\ncombined with a unitary one-design strategy to randomize errors over the\ncomputational Hilbert space. We show that in the context of (fault-tolerant)\nquantum error correction, we can construct a one-design using the logically\nencoded Clifford group over the engineered error-free stabilizer subspace to\nobtain average error for arbitrary logically-encoded gates and algorithms. In\nthe case of benchmarking simulation of physical systems, these can have various\nexotic symmetries over which one-design strategies can nonetheless be\nconstructed. We give examples for fermionic systems which conserve particle\nnumber, as well as for the Fermi-Hubbard model. The symmetry benchmarking\nmethod preserves robustness to state preparation and measurement imperfections.\n", "  Many obsects in the solar system are suspected to have experience\nreorientation of their spin axes. As their rotation rates are slow and their\nshapes are nearly spherical, the formation of mass anomalies, by either\nendogenic of exogenic processes, can change objects' moments of inertia.\nTherefore, the objects reorient to align their largest moment of inertia with\ntheir spin axis. Such phenomenon is called True Polar Wander (TPW).\n  Here we report the discovery of a global series of topographic lows on\nSaturn's satellite Enceladus that we interpret to show that this synchronously\nlocked moon has undergone TPW by ~55{\\deg} about the tidal axis. We use\nimproved topographic data from the spherical harmonic expansion of Cassini limb\nand stereogrammetric measurements to characterize regional topography over the\nsurface of Enceladus. We identify a group of nearly antipodal basins orthogonal\nto a topographic basin chain tracing a non-equatorial circumglobal belt across\nEnceladus' surface. We argue that the belt and the antipodal regions are fossil\nremnants of an earlier equator and poles, respectively. We argue that these\nlows arise from isostasic compensation and that their pattern reflects spatial\nvariations in internal dynamics of the ice shell. Our hypothesis is consistent\nwith a variety of geological features visible in Cassini images.\n", "  Mastering problem solving requires students to not only understand and apply\nphysics concepts but also employ mathematics and mathematical representations\n(sketches, diagrams, graphs, gestures, equations and spoken language)\nskillfully. As part of a larger project to investigate problem solving\nprocesses among upper division physics students, we investigate how students\ncoordinate among multiple representations while solving problems. Data for this\nstudy is drawn from an upper-division Electromagnetism I course, where students\nengage in individual oral exams. We do moment-by-moment analysis of students'\nproblem solving to see how they translate between durable representations\n(diagrams, written mathematical equations) with the help of evanescent\nrepresentations (gestures, words); and how they build up durable\nrepresentations where they can \"stand fast\" later. In this paper, we present\nthe case of Larry as an exemplary case for problem solving. Larry starts from a\ndurable representation (diagram) and builds up from there using evanescent\nrepresentations (gestures and words), standing fast on the diagram. He later\ntranslates to a different kind of durable representation (mathematics), where\nhe reasons and answers the original problem.\n"]}
