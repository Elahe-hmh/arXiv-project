"10.1063/1.4995698"], "abstract": ["  We show that the peculiar surface abundance patterns of Carbon Enhanced Metal\nPoor (CEMP) stars has been inherited from material having been processed by H-\nand He-burning phases in a previous generation of stars (hereafter called the\n``Source Stars''). In this previous generation, some mixing must have occurred\nbetween the He- and the H-burning regions in order to explain the high observed\nabundances of nitrogen. In addition, it is necessary to postulate that a very\nsmall fraction of the carbon-oxygen core has been expelled (either by winds or\nby the supernova explosion). Therefore only the most outer layers should have\nbeen released by the Source Stars. Some of the CEMP stars may be He-rich if the\nmatter from the Source Star is not too much diluted with the InterStellar\nMedium (ISM). Those stars formed from nearly pure ejecta would also be Li-poor.\n", "  We describe here various detectors designs: GEM type, MICROMEGAStype,\nPPACtype as well as cascaded detectors made of a resistive mesh manufactured\nfrom a resistive Kapton foil, (20 microns thick, resistivity a few MOhm per\nsquare) by a laser drilling technique. As in any other micropattern detectors\nthe maximum achievable gas gain of these detectors is restricted by the Raether\nlimit, however, the resistive mesh makes them and the front end electronics\nfully spark protected. This approach could be an alternative or complimentary\nto the ongoing efforts in developing MICROMEGAS and GEMs with resistive anode\nreadout plates and can be especially beneficial in the case of micropattern\ndetectors combined with a micropixel-type integrated front end electronics\n", "  The Turaev-Viro invariants are scalar topological invariants of\nthree-dimensional manifolds. Here we show that the problem of estimating the\nFibonacci version of the Turaev-Viro invariant of a mapping torus is a complete\nproblem for the one clean qubit complexity class (DQC1). This complements a\nprevious result showing that estimating the Turaev-Viro invariant for arbitrary\nmanifolds presented as Heegaard splittings is a complete problem for the\nstandard quantum computation model (BQP). We also discuss a beautiful analogy\nbetween these results and previously known results on the computational\ncomplexity of approximating the Jones polynomial.\n", "  We search for the dark flow induced diffuse kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ)\neffect through CMB-galaxy cross correlation. Such angular correlation is\nanisotropic, with a unique $cos(theta_DF)$ angular dependence and hence can be\ndistinguished from other components. Here, $theta_DF$ is the angle between the\nopposite dark flow direction and the direction of the sky where the correlation\nis measured. We analyze the KIAS-VAGC galaxy catalog of SDSS-DR7 and the WMAP\nseven-year temperature maps, applying an unbiased optimal weighting scheme to\neliminate any statistically isotropic components and to enhance the dark flow\ndetection signal. Non-zero weighted cross correlations are detected at 3.5\nsigma for the redshift bin z<0.1 and at 3 sigma for the bin 0.1<z<0.2, implying\nthe existence of statistically anisotropic components in CMB. However, further\nanalysis does not support the dark flow explanation. The observed directional\ndependence deviates from the $\\propto cos(theta_DF)$ relation expected, and\nhence can not be explained by the presence of a single dark flow, and if the\nobserved cross correlation is generated by the dark flow induced kSZ effect,\nthe velocity would be too high (> 6000 km/s). We report this work as the first\nattempt to search for dark flow through weighted CMB-galaxy cross correlation\nand to draw the attention on the sources of the detected anomalous CMB-galaxy\ncross correlation.\n", "  An obfuscator is an algorithm that translates circuits into\nfunctionally-equivalent similarly-sized circuits that are hard to understand.\nEfficient obfuscators would have many applications in cryptography. Until\nrecently, theoretical progress has mainly been limited to no-go results. Recent\nworks have proposed the first efficient obfuscation algorithms for classical\nlogic circuits, based on a notion of indistinguishability against\npolynomial-time adversaries. In this work, we propose a new notion of\nobfuscation, which we call partial-indistinguishability. This notion is based\non computationally universal groups with efficiently computable normal forms,\nand appears to be incomparable with existing definitions. We describe universal\ngate sets for both classical and quantum computation, in which our definition\nof obfuscation can be met by polynomial-time algorithms. We also discuss some\npotential applications to testing quantum computers. We stress that the\ncryptographic security of these obfuscators, especially when composed with\ntranslation from other gate sets, remains an open question.\n", "  We study the alignment signal between the distribution of brightest satellite\ngalaxies (BSGs) and the major axis of their host groups using SDSS group\ncatalog constructed by Yang et al. (2007). After correcting for the effect of\ngroup ellipticity, a statistically significant (~ 5\\sigma) major-axis alignment\nis detected and the alignment angle is found to be 43.0 \\pm 0.4 degrees. More\nmassive and richer groups show stronger BSG alignment. The BSG alignment around\nblue BCGs is slightly stronger than that around red BCGs. And red BSGs have\nmuch stronger major-axis alignment than blue BSGs. Unlike BSGs, other\nsatellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis. We\nfurther explore the BSG alignment in semi-analytic model (SAM) constructed by\nGuo et al. (2011). We found general good agreement with observations: BSGs in\nSAM show strong major-axis alignment which depends on group mass and richness\nin the same way as observations; and none of other satellites exhibit prominent\nalignment. However, discrepancy also exists in that the SAM shows opposite BSG\ncolor dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scale\nenvironment ingredient in SAM. The combination of two popular scenarios can\nexplain the detected BSG alignment. The first one: satellites merged into the\ngroup preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is strongly aligned\nwith the major axis of the group. The second one: BSGs enter their host group\nmore recently than other satellites, then will preserve more information about\nthe assembling history and so the major-axis alignment. In SAM, we found\npositive evidence for the second scenario by the fact that BSGs merged into\ngroups statistically more recently than other satellites. On the other hand,\nalthough is opposite in SAM, the BSG color dependence in observation might\nindicate the first scenario as well.\n", "  The creation of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond is nowadays well\ncontrolled using nitrogen implantation and annealing. Although the\nhigh-resolution placement of NV centres has been demonstrated using either\ncollimation through pierced AFM tips or masks with apertures made by electron\nbeam lithography, a targeted implantation into pre-defined structures in\ndiamond may not be achieved using these techniques. We show that a beam of\nnitrogen ions can be focused to approximately 100 nm using focused ion beam\n(FIB) technology. The nitrogen ion beam is produced using an electron cyclotron\nresonance (ECR) plasma source. Combined with a scanning electron microscope,\nthe nitrogen-FIB offers new possibilities for the targeted creation of single\ndefects in diamond. This maskless technology is suitable for example for the\ncreation of optical centres in the cavities of photonic crystals or in diamond\ntips for scanning magnetometry. Finally, we further show that by changing the\ngas source from nitrogen to xenon, standard FIB milling capabilities are also\navailable within the same tool.\n", "  Using covariant quantization of the electromagnetic field, the Casimir force\nper unit area experienced by a long conducting cylindrical shell, under both\nDirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, is calculated. The renormalization\nprocedure is based on the plasma cut-off frequency for real conductors. The\nreal case of a gold (silver) cylindrical shell is considered and the\ncorresponding electromagnetic Casimir pressure is computed. It is discussed\nthat the Dirichlet and Neumann problems should be considered separately without\nadding their corresponding results.\n", "  We perform an extensive survey of non-standard Higgs decays that are\nconsistent with the 125 GeV Higgs-like resonance. Our aim is to motivate a\nlarge set of new experimental analyses on the existing and forthcoming data\nfrom the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The explicit search for exotic Higgs\ndecays presents a largely untapped discovery opportunity for the LHC\ncollaborations, as such decays may be easily missed by other searches. We\nemphasize that the Higgs is uniquely sensitive to the potential existence of\nnew weakly coupled particles and provide a unified discussion of a large class\nof both simplified and complete models that give rise to characteristic\npatterns of exotic Higgs decays. We assess the status of exotic Higgs decays\nafter LHC Run 1. In many cases we are able to set new nontrivial constraints by\nreinterpreting existing experimental analyses. We point out that improvements\nare possible with dedicated analyses and perform some preliminary collider\nstudies. We prioritize the analyses according to their theoretical motivation\nand their experimental feasibility. This document is accompanied by a website\nthat will be continuously updated with further information:\nhttp://exotichiggs.physics.sunysb.edu.\n", "  The security of quantum key distribution protocols is guaranteed by the laws\nof quantum mechanics. However, a precise analysis of the security properties\nrequires tools from both classical cryptography and information theory. Here,\nwe employ recent results in non-asymptotic classical information theory to show\nthat one-way information reconciliation imposes fundamental limitations on the\namount of secret key that can be extracted in the finite key regime. In\nparticular, we find that an often used approximation for the information\nleakage during information reconciliation is not generally valid. We propose an\nimproved approximation that takes into account finite key effects and\nnumerically test it against codes for two probability distributions, that we\ncall binary-binary and binary-Gaussian, that typically appear in quantum key\ndistribution protocols.\n", "  The population of stellar-mass, compact object binaries that merge with\nnon-negligible eccentricity may be large enough to motivate searches with\nground-based gravitational wave detectors. Such events could be exceptional\nlaboratories to test General Relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime,\nas a larger fraction of the energy is emitted at high-velocities, compared to\nquasi-circular inspirals. A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of\ncomputing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite\naccuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are\nmore a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a\ncontinuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess\npower over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was\nrecently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy.\nThe leading-order \"observable\" that would be inferred from such a detection\nwould be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of\neach time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence\nof numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the\nbinary at formation. In this work, following the spirit of the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian framework developed for quasi-circular inspiral, we propose a\nsimple, parameterized deformation of the baseline general relativistic burst\nalgorithm for eccentric inspiral events that would allow for model-independent\ntests of Einstein's theory in this high-velocity, strong-field regime.\n", "  A detailed study of the semiclassical expansion of the world line path\nintegral for a charged relativistic particle in a constant external electric\nfield is presented. We show that the Schwinger formula for charged particle\npair production is reproduced exactly by the semiclassical expansion around\nclassical instanton solutions when the leading order of fluctuations is taken\ninto account. We prove that all corrections to this leading approximation\nvanish and that the WKB approximation to the world line path integral is exact.\n", "  A unitary operator that satisfies the constant Yang-Baxter equation\nimmediately yields a unitary representation of the braid group B n for every $n\n\\ge 2$. If we view such an operator as a quantum-computational gate, then\ntopological braiding corresponds to a quantum circuit. A basic question is when\nsuch a representation affords universal quantum computation. In this work, we\nshow how to classically simulate these circuits when the gate in question\nbelongs to certain families of solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. These\ninclude all of the qubit (i.e., $d = 2$) solutions, and some simple families\nthat include solutions for arbitrary $d \\ge 2$. Our main tool is a\nprobabilistic classical algorithm for efficient simulation of a more general\nclass of quantum circuits. This algorithm may be of use outside the present\nsetting.\n", "  BRST complexes are differential graded Poisson algebras. They are associated\nto a coisotropic ideal $J$ of a Poisson algebra $P$ and provide a description\nof the Poisson algebra $(P/J)^J$ as their cohomology in degree zero. Using the\nnotion of stable equivalence introduced by Felder and Kazhdan, we prove that\nany two BRST complexes associated to the same coisotropic ideal are\nquasi-isomorphic in the case $P = \\mathbb{R}[V]$ where $V$ is a\nfinite-dimensional symplectic vector space and the bracket on $P$ is induced by\nthe symplectic structure on $V$. As a corollary, the cohomology of the BRST\ncomplexes is canonically associated to the coisotropic ideal $J$ in the\nsymplectic case. We do not require any regularity assumptions on the\nconstraints generating the ideal $J$. We finally quantize the BRST complex\nrigorously in the presence of infinitely many ghost variables and discuss\nuniqueness of the quantization procedure.\n", "  We demonstrate that $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric non-Abelian gauge theories\nhave towers of BPS particles obeying a Regge relation, $J \\sim m^{2},$ between\ntheir angular momenta, $J,$ and their masses, $m$. For $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills\ntheories, we estimate the slope of these Regge trajectories using a\nnon-relativistic quiver quantum mechanics model. Along the way, we also prove\nvarious structure theorems for the quiver moduli spaces that appear in the\ncalculation.\n", "  We review the basic concepts of all-order calculations in Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) and their application to collider phenomenology. We start\nby discussing the factorization properties of QCD amplitudes and cross-sections\nin the soft and collinear limits and their resulting all-order exponentiation.\nWe then discuss several applications of this formalism to observables which are\nof great interest at particle colliders. In this context, we describe the\nall-order resummation of event-shape distributions, as well as observables that\nprobe the internal structure of hadronic jets.\n", "  Jupiter's tropospheric composition and cloud structure are studied using\nCassini VIMS 4.5-5.1 {\\mu}m thermal emission spectra from the 2000-2001 flyby.\nWe make use of both nadir and limb darkening observations on the planet's\nnightside, and compare these with dayside observations. Although there is\nsignificant spatial variability in the 5-{\\mu}m brightness temperatures, the\nshape of the spectra remain very similar across the planet, suggesting the\npresence of a spectrally-flat, spatially inhomogeneous cloud deck. We find that\na simple cloud model consisting of a single, compact cloud is able to reproduce\nboth nightside and dayside spectra, subject to the following constraints: (i)\nthe cloud base is located at pressures of 1.2 bar or lower; (ii) the cloud\nparticles are highly scattering; (iii) the cloud is sufficiently spectrally\nflat. Using this cloud model, we search for global variability in the cloud\nopacity and the phosphine deep volume mixing ratio. We find that the vast\nmajority of the 5-{\\mu}m inhomogeneity can be accounted for by variations in\nthe thickness of the cloud decks, with huge differences between the cloudy\nzones and the relatively cloud-free belts. The relatively low spectral\nresolution of VIMS limits reliable retrievals of gaseous species, but some\nevidence is found for an enhancement in the abundance of phosphine at high\nlatitudes.\n", "  The results are presented on the study of the electronic structure of thorium\natoms adsorbed by the liquid atomic layer deposition from aqueous solution of\nthorium nitrate on the surface of CaF2. The chemical state of the atoms and the\nchange of the band structure in the surface layers of Th/CaF2 system on CaF2\nsubstrate were investigated by XPS and REELS techniques. It was found that\nREELS spectra for Th/CaF2 system include peaks in the region of low energy\nlosses (3-7 eV) which are missing in the similar spectra for pure CaF2. It is\nconcluded that the presence of the observed features in the REELS spectra is\nassociated with the chemical state of thorium atoms and is caused by the\npresence of uncompensated chemical bonds at the Th/CaF2 interface, and,\ntherefore, by the presence of unbound 6d- and 7s-electrons of thorium atoms.\nAssuming the equivalence of the electronic configuration of thorium-229 and\nthorium-232 atoms, an estimate was made on the time decay of the excited state\nof thorium-229 nuclei through the channel of the electron conversion. It was\nfound that the relaxation time is about 40 {\\mu}s for 6d-electrons, and about 1\n{\\mu}s for 7s-electrons.\n", "  We study the formation and growth of laser-induced periodic surface\nstructures (LIPSSs) with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. We\nuse a recently proposed inter-pulse feedback method to account for the\nevolution of the surface morphology between each laser pulse sent to the\nsurface of the processed material. This method has been used with an\nablation-like mechanism, by removing material exposed to a light intensity\nhigher than a given threshold. We propose an inverse mechanism, an\nexpansion-like mechanism, able to grow structures that the ablation-like\nprocess cannot. This allows us to introduce the notions of constructive and\ndestructive feedback and explains a strong contradiction between the standard\nSipe-Drude theory and the experimental observations, i. e. the formation on\nmetals of structures usually linked to wide band gap dielectrics.\n", "  Our work is motivated by an interest in constructing a protein-protein\ninteraction network that captures key features associated with Parkinson's\ndisease. While there is an abundance of subnetwork construction methods\navailable, it is often far from obvious which subnetwork is the most suitable\nstarting point for further investigation. We provide a method to assess whether\na subnetwork constructed from a seed list (a list of nodes known to be\nimportant in the area of interest) differs significantly from a randomly\ngenerated subnetwork. The proposed method uses a Monte Carlo approach. As\ndifferent seed lists can give rise to the same subnetwork, we control for\nredundancy by constructing a minimal seed list as the starting point for the\nsignificance test. The null model is based on random seed lists of the same\nlength as a minimum seed list that generates the subnetwork, in this random\nseed list the nodes have (approximately) the same degree distribution as the\nnodes in the minimum seed list. We use this null model to select subnetworks\nwhich deviate significantly from random on an appropriate set of statistics and\nmight capture useful information for a real world protein-protein interaction\nnetwork.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the degenerate heavy Higgs bosons in the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) by introducing\nvector-like particles. Such an extension is well motivated from the top-down\nview since some grand unified theories usually predict the existence of singlet\nscalars and vector-like particles at weak scale. Under the constraints from the\nLHC and dark matter experiments, we find that (1) the null results of searching\nfor high mass resonances have tightly constrained the parameter space; (2) two\ndegenerate heavy singlet Higgs bosons $h_2$ and $a_1$ can sizably decay to\n$\\chi^0_1\\chi^0_1$ invisibly. Therefore, search for the monojet events through\nthe process $gg \\to h_2 / a_1 (\\to \\chi^0_1 \\chi^0_1) j$ may further test our\nscenario at the future LHC.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the primary and\nsecondary instabilities in a Kolmogorov-like flow. The experiment uses\nelectromagnetic forcing with an approximately sinusoidal spatial profile to\ndrive a quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) shear flow in a thin layer of electrolyte\nsuspended on a thin lubricating layer of a dielectric fluid. Theoretical\nanalysis is based on a 2D model (Suri ${\\it et al.}$ 2014), derived from first\nprinciples by depth-averaging the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes\nequations. As the strength of the forcing is increased, the Q2D flow in the\nexperiment undergoes a series of bifurcations, which is compared with results\nfrom direct numerical simulations of the 2D model. The effects of confinement\nand the forcing profile are studied by performing simulations that assume\nspatial periodicity and strictly sinusoidal forcing, as well as simulations\nwith realistic no-slip boundary conditions and an experimentally validated\nforcing profile. We find that only the simulation subject to physical no-slip\nboundary conditions and a realistic forcing profile provides close,\nquantitative agreement with the experiment. Our analysis offers additional\nvalidation of the 2D model as well as a demonstration of the importance of\nproperly modelling the forcing and boundary conditions.\n", "  We have earlier proposed a fourth order gravity model as a possible\nexplanation for late time cosmic acceleration, and for flattened galaxy\nrotation curves. The model has a free length parameter whose value depends on\nthe scale of the system under study (e.g. the whole Universe, a galaxy, or a\ncompact binary pulsar). In the present work, we investigate the constraints\nimposed on the free model parameter by Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar data:\nperiastron advance; and emission of gravitational waves and consequent period\ndecay. It is shown that the model is consistent with these observations,\nprovided the length parameter is bounded from above.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of global optimization-based overlapping\ncommunity detection, using link community framework. We first show that\npartition density, the original quality function used in link community\ndetection method, is not suitable as a quality function for global optimization\nbecause it prefers breaking communities into triangles except in highly limited\nconditions. We analytically derive those conditions and confirm it with\ncomputational results on direct optimization of various synthetic and\nreal-world networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose alternative\napproaches combining the weighted line graph transformation and existing\nquality functions for node-based communities. We suggest a new line graph\nweighting scheme, a normalized Jaccard index. Computational results show that\ncommunity detection using the weighted line graphs generated with the\nnormalized Jaccard index leads to a more accurate community structure.\n", "  In this letter, we propose a new model that explains the Raman peak downshift\nobserved in nanoparticles with respect to bulk materials. The proposed model\ntakes into account discreteness of the vibrational spectra of nanoparticles.\nFor crystals with a cubic lattice (Diamond, Silicon, Germanium) we give a\nrelation between the displacement of Raman peak position and the size of\nnanoparticles. The proposed model does not include any uncertain parameters,\nunlike the conventionally used phonon confinement model (PCM), and can be\nemployed for unambiguous nanoparticles size estimation.\n", "  Long-distance quantum channels capable of transferring quantum states\nfaithfully for unconditionally secure quantum communication have been so far\nconfirmed feasible in both fiber and free-space air. However, it remains\nunclear whether seawater, which covers more than 70% of the earth, can also be\nutilized, leaving global quantum communication incomplete. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate that polarization quantum states including general\nqubits and entangled states can well survive after travelling through seawater.\nWe performed experiments in a 3.3-meter-long tube filled with seawater samples\ncollected in a range of 36 kilometers in Yellow sea, which conforms to Jerlov\nwater type I. For single photons at 405 nm in blue-green window, we obtained\naverage process fidelity above 98%. For entangled photons at 810 nm, even with\nhigh loss, we observe violation of Bell inequality with 33 standard deviations.\nThis work confirms feasibility of seawater quantum channel, representing the\nfirst step towards underwater quantum communication.\n", "  The extended Harper's model, proposed by D.J. Thouless in 1983, generalizes\nthe famous almost Mathieu operator, allowing for a wider range of lattice\ngeometries (parametrized by three coupling parameters) by permitting 2D\nelectrons to hop to both nearest and next nearest neighboring (NNN) lattice\nsites, while still exhibiting its characteristic symmetry (Aubry duality).\nPrevious understanding of the spectral theory of this model was restricted to\ntwo dual regions of the parameter space, one of which is characterized by the\npositivity of the Lyapunov exponent. In this paper, we complete the picture\nwith a description of the spectral measures over the entire remaining\n(self-dual) region, for all irrational values of the frequency parameter (the\nmagnetic flux in the model). Most notably, we prove that in the entire interior\nof this regime, the model exhibits a collapse from purely ac spectrum to purely\nsc spectrum when the NNN interaction becomes symmetric. In physics literature,\nextensive numerical analysis had indicated such \"spectral collapse,\" however so\nfar not even a heuristic argument for this phenomenon could be provided. On the\nother hand, in the remaining part of the self-dual region, the spectral\nmeasures are singular continuous irrespective of such symmetry. The analysis\nrequires some rather delicate number theoretic estimates, which ultimately\ndepend on the solution of a problem posed by Erd\\H{o}s and Szekeres.\n", "  Large $N$ but non-planar limits of ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory can\nbe described using restricted Schur polynomials. Previous investigations\ndemonstrate that the action of the one loop dilatation operator on restricted\nSchur operators, with classical dimension of order $N$ and belonging to the\n$su(2)$ sector, is largely determined by the $su(2)$ ${\\cal R}$ symmetry\nalgebra as well as structural features of perturbative field theory. Studies\npresented so far have used the form of ${\\cal R}$ symmetry generators when\nacting on small perturbations of half-BPS operators. In this article, as a\nfirst step towards going beyond small perturbations of the half-BPS operators,\nwe explain how the exact action of symmetry generators on restricted Schur\npolynomials can be determined.\n", "  In contrast to the seminal weak localization prediction of a non-critical\nHall constant ($R_{H}$) at the Anderson metal-insulator transition (MIT),\n$R_{H}$ in quite a few real disordered systems exhibits both, a strong\n$T$-dependence and critical scaling near their MIT. Here, we investigate these\nissues in detail within a non-perturbative \"strong localization\" regime using\ncluster-dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT). We uncover $(i)$ clear and\nunconventional quantum-critical scaling of the $\\gamma$-function, finding that\n$\\gamma(g_{xy})\\simeq$ log$(g_{xy})$ over a wide range spanning the continuous\nMIT, very similar to that seen for the longitudinal conductivity, $(ii)$\nstrongly $T$-dependent and clear quantum critical scaling in both transverse\nconductivity and $R_{H}$ at the MIT. We find that these surprising results are\nin comprehensive and very good accord with signatures of a novel kind of\nlocalization in disordered NbN near the MIT, providing substantial support for\nour \"strong\" localization view.\n", "  In nonlinear microresonators driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing\npatterns have been studied in the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with\nemphasis on its high coherence and exceptional robustness against\nperturbations. Destabilization of Turing pattern and transition to\nspatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available energy carried in the\nTuring rolls and prevents further harvest of their high coherence and\nrobustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent such\ndestabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations, and\nattain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear\noscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and an\nelevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is\ndiscretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency\nsideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous\nmicrowave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution\nstages through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running\nTuring roll coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is\ntransferred onto a plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz\ncoherent generation at room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power\nconversion. Its long-term stability can be further improved by more than two\norders of magnitude, reaching an Allan deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a\nsimple computer-aided slow feedback control. The demonstrated on-chip coherent\nhigh-power Turing-THz system is promising to find applications in astrophysics,\nmedical imaging, and wireless communications.\n", "  Despite stringent constraints set by astrophysical observations, there remain\nviable scalar-tensor theories that could be distinguished from general\nrelativity with gravitational-wave detectors. A promising signal predicted in\nthese alternative theories is dynamical scalarization, which can dramatically\naffect the evolution of neutron-star binaries near merger. Motivated by the\nsuccessful treatment of spontaneous scalarization, we develop a formalism that\npartially resums the post-Newtonian expansion to capture dynamical\nscalarization in a mathematically consistent manner. We calculate the\npost-Newtonian order corrections to the equations of motion and scalar mass of\na binary system. Through comparison with quasi-equilibrium configuration\ncalculations, we verify that this new approximation scheme can accurately\npredict the onset and magnitude of dynamical scalarization.\n", "  Understanding anomalous transport and reaction kinetics due to microscopic\nphysical and chemical disorder is a long-standing goal in many fields including\ngeophysics, biology, and engineering. We consider reaction-diffusion\ncharacterized by fluctuations in both transitions times and decay rates. We\nintroduce and analyze a model framework that explicitly connects microscopic\nfluctuations with the mescoscopic description. For broad distributions of\ntransport and reaction time scales we compute the particle density and derive\nthe equations governing its evolution, finding power-law decay of the survival\nprobability, and spatially heterogeneous decay that leads to subdiffusion and\nan asymptotically stationary surviving-particle density. These anomalies are\nclearly attributable to non-Markovian effects that couple transport and\nchemical properties in both reaction and diffusion terms.\n", "  We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing\nfor cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to\nbe separated from other non-causally-related events. This tool shows that\ntraditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct\nbut temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise.\nIn contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden\nfeatures of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical\ndata with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that\nneuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.\n", "  The simplest string theory compactifications to 3D with 16 supercharges --\nthe heterotic string on $T^7$, and type II strings on $K3 \\times T^3$ -- are\nrelated by U-duality, and share a moduli space of vacua parametrized by\n$O(8,24; \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash O(8,24) / (O(8) \\times O(24))$. One can think\nof this as the moduli space of even, self-dual 32-dimensional lattices with\nsignature (8,24). At 24 special points in moduli space, the lattice splits as\n$\\Gamma^{8,0} \\oplus \\Gamma^{0,24}$. $\\Gamma^{0,24}$ can be the Leech lattice\nor any of 23 Niemeier lattices, while $\\Gamma^{8,0}$ is the $E_8$ root lattice.\nWe show that starting from this observation, one can find a precise connection\nbetween the Umbral groups and type IIA string theory on $K3$. This provides a\nnatural physical starting point for understanding Mathieu and Umbral moonshine.\nThe maximal unbroken subgroups of Umbral groups in 6D (or any other limit) are\nthose obtained by starting at the associated Niemeier point and moving in\nmoduli space while preserving the largest possible subgroup of the Umbral\ngroup. To illustrate the action of these symmetries on BPS states, we discuss\nthe computation of certain protected four-derivative terms in the effective\nfield theory, and recover facts about the spectrum and symmetry representations\nof 1/2-BPS states.\n", "  The new multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on NGC 5548 shows clearly that\nthe variability of the UV/optical lightcurves lags by progressively longer\ntimes at longer wavelengths, as expected from reprocessing of an optically\nthick disk, but that the timescales are longer than expected for a standard\nShakura-Sunyaev accretion disc. We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc\nreprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves\nwith too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata. We reverse engineer a solution to match the observations and find that\nthe luminosity and temperature of the lagged emission is not consistent with\nmaterial at the light travel lag distance responding to the irradiating flux\n(either FUV or X-ray) from the AGN. We conclude that the UV/optical lags of NGC\n5548 are not the light travel time from X-ray reprocessing, nor the light\ntravel time from FUV reprocessing, but instead could be the timescale for the\nouter blackbody disc vertical structure to respond to the changing FUV\nillumination.\n", "  Spin Hall effect (SHE) induced reversal of perpendicular magnetization has\nattracted significant interest, due to its potential to lead to low power\nmemory and logic devices. However, the switching requires an assisted in-plane\nmagnetic field, which hampers its practical applications. Here, we introduce a\nnovel approach for external-field-free spin Hall switching of a perpendicular\nnanomagnet by utilizing a local dipolar field arising from an adjacent in-plane\nmagnetic layer. Robust switching of perpendicular CoFeB nanopillars in a\ndipole-coupled composite stack is experimentally demonstrated in the absence of\nany external magnetic field, in consistent with the results of micromagnetic\nsimulation. Large in-plane compensation field of about 135 Oe and out-of-plane\nloop shift of about 45 Oe / 10 7 A cm-2 are obtained in the nanopillar devices\nwith composite structure. By performing micromagnetic simulations, we confirm\nthe composite external-field-free switching strategy can also work for a 10 x\n10 nm2 circular pillar. Compared with other proposed methods for\nexternal-field-free spin Hall switching of perpendicular magnetization, the\ndipole-coupled composite structure is compatible with a wide range of spin Hall\nsystems and perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions, paving the way towards\npractical SHE-based MRAM and logic applications.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the nonlocal correlation (beyond entanglement)\ncaptured by measurement induced nonlocality and geometric quantum discord for a\npair of interacting spin-1/2 particles at thermal equilibrium. It is shown that\nboth the measures are identical in measuring the correlation. We show the\npossibility of nonlocal correlation between the spins without entanglement,\nwhich ceases to exist only for the maximal mixture of product bases. We also\nobserve that while interaction between the spins is responsible for the\nenhancement of correlation, this non-classicality decreases with the\nintervention of external magnetic field.\n", "  Small random perturbations may have a dramatic impact on the long time\nevolution of dynamical systems, and large deviation theory is often the right\ntheoretical framework to understand these effects. At the core of the theory\nlies the minimization of an action functional, which in many cases of interest\nhas to be computed by numerical means. Here we review the theoretical and\ncomputational aspects behind these calculations, and propose an algorithm that\nsimplifies the geometric minimum action method to minimize the action in the\nspace of arc-length parametrized curves. We then illustrate this algorithm's\ncapabilities by applying it to various examples from material sciences, fluid\ndynamics, atmosphere/ocean sciences, and reaction kinetics. In terms of models,\nthese examples involve stochastic (ordinary or partial) differential equations\nwith multiplicative or degenerate noise, Markov jump processes, and systems\nwith fast and slow degrees of freedom, which all violate detailed balance, so\nthat simpler computational methods are not applicable.\n", "  We study the performance of a three-terminal thermoelectric device such as\nheat engine and refrigerator with broken time-reversal symmetry by applying the\nunified trade-off figure of merit ($\\dot{\\Omega}$ criterion) which accounts for\nboth useful energy and losses. For heat engine, we find that a thermoelectric\ndevice working under the maximum $\\dot{\\Omega}$ criterion gives a significantly\nbetter performance than a device working at maximum power output. Within the\nframework of linear irreversible thermodynamics such a direct comparison is not\npossible for refrigerators, however, our study indicates that, for\nrefrigerator, the maximum cooling load gives a better performance than the\nmaximum $\\dot{\\Omega}$ criterion for a larger asymmetry. Our results can be\nuseful to choose a suitable optimization criterion for operating a real\nthermoelectric device with broken time-reversal symmetry.\n", "  In this paper we extend a new method to measure possible variation of the\nspeed of light by using Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the Hubble function\npresented in our earlier paper [V. Salzano, M. P. D\\c{a}browski, and R. Lazkoz,\nPhys. Rev. D93, 063521 (2016)] onto an inhomogeneous model of the universe. The\nmethod relies on the fact that there is a simple relation between the angular\ndiameter distance $(D_{A})$ maximum and the Hubble function $(H)$ evaluated at\nthe same maximum-condition redshift, which includes speed of light $c$. One\nlimit of such method was the assumption of null spatial curvature (even if we\nshowed that even a non-zero curvature would have negligible effects). Here, we\nmove one step further: we explicitly assume a model with intrinsic non-null\ncurvature, and calculate the exact relation between $D_{A}$ and $H$ in this\ncase. Then, we evaluate if current or future missions such as SKA can be\nsensitive enough to detect any such kind of spatial variation of $c$ which can\nperhaps be related to the recently observed spatial variation of the fine\nstructure constant (an effect known as $\\alpha$-dipole).\n", "  A thermal antenna is an electromagnetic source which emits in its\nsurrounding, a spatially coherent field in the infrared frequency range.\nUsually, its emission pattern changes with the wavelength so that the heat flux\nit radiates is weakly directive. Here, we show that a class of hyperbolic\nmaterials, possesses a Brewster angle which is weakly dependent on the\nwavelength, so that they can radiate like a true thermal antenna with a highly\ndirectional heat flux. The realization of these sources could open a new avenue\nin the field of thermal management in far-field regime.\n", "  The resonance phenomenon is widely known from Physics courses. Qualitatively\nspeaking, it takes place in a driven oscillating system whenever the driven\nfrequency approaches the natural frequency. It is when the amplitude of the\noscillations become maximal. Very closely related to this phenomenon, there is\nanother which is very surprising too. It takes place when the driven and\nnatural frequencies of the system are slightly different and interfere\nconstructively and destructively, forming the so called beats. The frequency of\nthe beats is just the difference of the interfering waves frequencies. Beats\nare very noticeable in acoustic systems. We all have probably perceived them in\nthe form of periodic ups and downs in the sound intensity volume. There are\nseveral works in this journal on visualizing the beats in acoustic systems. For\ninstance, the microphone and the speaker of two mobile devices were used in\nprevious work to analyze the acoustic beat produced by two signals of close\nfrequencies. The formation of beats can also be visualized in mechanical\nsystems, such as a mass-spring system5 or a double driven string. Hereafter,\nthe mechanical beats in a smartphone-spring system are directly visualized in a\nsimple way. The frequency of the beats is measured by means of the acceleration\nsensor of a smartphone which hangs from a spring attached to a motor driver.\n", "  Consider the following stochastic partial differential equation,\n\\begin{equation*} \\partial_t u_t(x)=\n  \\mathcal{L}u_t(x)+ \\xi\\sigma (u_t(x)) \\dot F(t,x), \\end{equation*} where\n$\\xi$ is a positive parameter and $\\sigma$ is a globally Lipschitz continuous\nfunction. The stochastic forcing term $\\dot F(t,x)$ is white in time but\npossibly colored in space. The operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is a non-local operator.\nWe study the behaviour of the solution with respect to the parameter $\\xi$,\nextending the results in \\cite{FoonNual} and \\cite{Bin}\n", "  We introduce a method and a 3D-camera for single-shot 3D shape measurement,\nwith unprecedented features: The 3D-camera does not rely on pattern\ncodification and acquires object surfaces at the theoretical limit of the\ninformation efficiency: Up to 30% of the available camera pixels display\nindependent (not interpolated) 3D points. The 3D-camera is based on\ntriangulation with two properly positioned cameras and a projected multi-line\npattern, in combination with algorithms that solve the ambiguity problem. The\nprojected static line pattern enables 3D-acquisition of fast processes and the\ntake of 3D-motion-pictures. The depth resolution is at its physical limit,\ndefined by electronic noise and speckle noise. The requisite low cost\ntechnology is simple.\n", "  Discovery of causal relations is fundamental for understanding the dynamics\nof complex systems. While causal interactions are well defined for acyclic\nsystems that can be separated into causally effective subsystems, a\nmathematical definition of gradual causal interaction is still lacking for\nnonseparable dynamical systems. The solution proposed here is analytically\ntractable for time discrete chaotic maps and is shown to fulfill basic\nrequirements for causality measures. It implies a method for determination of\ndirected effective influences using pairs of measurements from dynamical\nsystems. Applications to time series from systems of coupled differential\nequations and linear stochastic systems demonstrate its general utility.\n", "  The two pillars of rational conformal field theory and rational vertex\noperator algebras are modularity of characters on the one hand and its\ninterpretation of modules as objects in a modular tensor category on the other\none. Overarching these pillars is the Verlinde formula.\n  In this paper we consider the more general class of logarithmic conformal\nfield theories and $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras. We suggest that\ntheir modular pillar are trace functions with insertions corresponding to\nintertwiners of the projective cover of the vacuum, and that the categorical\npillar are finite tensor categories $\\mathcal C$ which are ribbon and whose\ndouble is isomorphic to the Deligne product $\\mathcal C\\otimes \\mathcal\nC^{opp}$.\n  Overarching these pillars is then a logarithmic variant of Verlinde's\nformula. Numerical data realizing this are the modular $S$-matrix and modified\ntraces of open Hopf links.\n  The representation categories of $C_2$-cofinite and logarithmic conformal\nfield theories that are fairly well understood are those of the $\\mathcal\nW_p$-triplet algebras and the symplectic fermions. We illustrate the ideas in\nthese examples and especially make the relation between logarithmic Hopf links\nand modular transformations explicit.\n", "  Heterotic vacua of string theory are realised, at large radius, by a compact\nthreefold with vanishing first Chern class together with a choice of stable\nholomorphic vector bundle. These form a wide class of potentially realistic\nfour-dimensional vacua of string theory. Despite all their phenomenological\npromise, there is little understanding of the metric on the moduli space of\nthese. What is sought is the analogue of special geometry for these vacua. The\nmetric on the moduli space is important in phenomenology as it normalises\nD-terms and Yukawa couplings. It is also of interest in mathematics, since it\ngeneralises the metric, first found by Kobayashi, on the space of gauge field\nconnections, to a more general context. Here we construct this metric, correct\nto first order in alpha', in two ways: first by postulating a metric that is\ninvariant under background gauge transformations of the gauge field, and also\nby dimensionally reducing heterotic supergravity. These methods agree and the\nresulting metric is Kahler, as is required by supersymmetry. Checking that the\nmetric is in fact Kahler is quite intricate and uses the anomaly cancellation\nequation for the H-field, in an essential way. The Kahler potential\nnevertheless takes a remarkably simple form: it is Kahler potential for special\ngeometry with the Kahler form replaced by the alpha'-corrected hermitian form.\n", "  An interesting problem in solid state physics is to compute discrete breather\nsolutions in $\\mathcal{N}$ coupled 1--dimensional Hamiltonian particle chains\nand investigate the richness of their interactions. One way to do this is to\ncompute the homoclinic intersections of invariant manifolds of a saddle point\nlocated at the origin of a class of $2\\mathcal{N}$--dimensional invertible\nmaps. In this paper we apply the parametrization method to express these\nmanifolds analytically as series expansions and compute their intersections\nnumerically to high precision. We first carry out this procedure for a\n2--dimensional (2--D) family of generalized Henon maps ($\\mathcal{N}$=1), prove\nthe existence of a hyperbolic set in the non-dissipative case and show that it\nis directly connected to the existence of a homoclinic orbit at the origin.\nIntroducing dissipation we demonstrate that a homoclinic tangency occurs beyond\nwhich the homoclinic intersection disappears. Proceeding to $\\mathcal{N}=2$, we\nuse the same approach to determine the homoclinic intersections of the\ninvariant manifolds of a saddle point at the origin of a 4--D map consisting of\ntwo coupled 2--D cubic H\\'enon maps. In dependence of the coupling the\nhomoclinic intersection is determined, which ceases to exist once a certain\namount of dissipation is present. We discuss an application of our results to\nthe study of discrete breathers in two linearly coupled 1--dimensional particle\nchains with nearest--neighbor interactions and a Klein--Gordon on site\npotential.\n", "  In order to carry out research in the field of possible existence of sterile\nneutrino the laboratory based on SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia) was\ncreated to search for oscillations of reactor antineutrino. The prototype of a\nmulti-section neutrino detector with liquid scintillator volume of 350 l was\ninstalled in the middle of 2015. It is a moveable inside the passive shielding\ndetector, which can be set at distance range from 6 to 11 meters from the\nreactor core. Measurements of antineutrino flux at such small distances from\nthe reactor core carried out with movable detector for the first time. The\nmeasurements carried out with detector prototype demonstrated a possibility of\nmeasuring a reactor antineutrino flux in difficult conditions of cosmic\nbackground at Earth surface.\n", "  Glitches in the rotational frequency of a spinning neutron star could be\npromising sources of gravitational wave signals lasting between a few\nmicroseconds to a few weeks. The emitted signals and their properties depend\nupon the internal properties of the neutron star. In neutron stars, the most\nimportant physical properties of the fluid core are the viscosity of the fluid,\nthe stratification of flow in the equilibrium state and the adiabatic sound\nspeed. Such models were previously studied by van Eysden and Melatos [73] and\nBennett et al. [26] following simple assumptions on all contributing factors,\nin which the post-glitch relaxation phase could be driven by the well-known\nprocess of Ekman pumping [76, 17]. We explore the hydrodynamic properties of\nthe flow of fluid during this phase following more relaxed assumptions on the\nstratification of flow and the pressure-density gradients within the neutron\nstar than previously studied. We calculate the time-scales of duration as well\nas the amplitudes of the resulting gravitational wave signals, and we detail\ntheir dependence on the physical properties of the fluid core. We find that it\nis possible for the neutron star to emit gravitational wave signals in a wide\nrange of decay time-scales and within the detection sensitivity of aLIGO for\nselected domains of physical parameters.\n", "  The chiral anomaly is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon that has a long\nhistory dating back to the late 1960s. Surprisingly, it has recently made a\nmacroscopic appearance in condensed matter physics. A brief introduction to the\nrelevant features of this anomaly is given and it is shown that its appearance\nin condensed matter systems must involve force-free magnetic fields, which may\nhelp explain the long current relaxation times in Dirac and Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We consider equivalent mechanical model of liquid sloshing in\npartially-filled cylindrical vessel; the model treats both the regime of linear\nsloshing, and strongly nonlinear sloshing regime. The latter is related to\nhydraulic impacts applied to the vessel walls. These hydraulic impacts are\ncommonly simulated with the help of high-power potential and dissipation\nfunctions. For the sake of analytic exploration, we substitute this traditional\napproach by treatment of an idealized vibro-impact system with\nvelocity-dependent restitution coefficient. The obtained reduced model is\nsimilar to recently explored system of linear primary oscillator with attached\nvibro-impact energy sink. The ratio of modal mass of the first sloshing mode to\nthe total mass of the liquid and the tank serves as a natural small parameter\nfor multiple-scale analysis. In the case of external ground forcing,\nsteady-state responses and chaotic strongly modulated responses are revealed.\nAll analytical predictions of the reduced vibro-impact model are validated\nagainst direct numerical simulations of initial equivalent model with\nhigh-power smooth potential and dissipation functions, and good agreement is\nobserved.\n", "  In this paper, we characterize a class of solutions to the unsteady\n2-dimensional flow of a van der Waals fluid involving shock waves, and derive\nan asymptotic amplitude equation exhibiting quadratic and cubic nonlinearities\nincluding dissipation and diffraction. We exploit the theory of nonclassical\nsymmetry reduction to obtain some exact solutions. Because of the\nnonlinearities present in the evolution equation, one expects that the wave\nprofile will eventually encounter distortion and steepening which in the limit\nof vanishing dissipation culminates into a shock wave; and once shock is\nformed, it will propagate by separating the portions of the continuous region.\nHere we have shown how the real gas effects, which manifest themselves through\nthe van der Waals parameters $\\tilde{a}$ and $\\tilde{b}$ influence the wave\ncharacteristics, namely the shape, strength, and decay behavior of shocks.\n", "  Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies offers a powerful probe of\ntheir structure and mass distribution. Deriving a lens magnification map for a\ngalaxy cluster is a classic inversion problem and many methods have been\ndeveloped over the past two decades to solve it. Several research groups have\ndeveloped techniques independently to map the predominantly dark matter\ndistribution in cluster lenses. While these methods have all provided\nremarkably high precision mass maps, particularly with exquisite imaging data\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the reconstructions themselves have\nnever been directly compared. In this paper, we report the results of comparing\nvarious independent lens modeling techniques employed by individual research\ngroups in the community. Here we present for the first time a detailed and\nrobust comparison of methodologies for fidelity, accuracy and precision. For\nthis collaborative exercise, the lens modeling community was provided simulated\ncluster images -- of two clusters Ares and Hera -- that mimic the depth and\nresolution of the ongoing HST Frontier Fields. The results of the submitted\nreconstructions with the un-blinded true mass profile of these two clusters are\npresented here. Parametric, free-form and hybrid techniques have been deployed\nby the participating groups and we detail the strengths and trade-offs in\naccuracy and systematics that arise for each methodology. We note in conclusion\nthat lensing reconstruction methods produce reliable mass distributions that\nenable the use of clusters as extremely valuable astrophysical laboratories and\ncosmological probes.\n", "  We propose a simulation strategy which uses a classical device of linearly\ncoupled chain of springs to simulate quantum dynamics, in particular the\nquantum walks. Through this strategy, we obtain the quantum wave function from\nclassical evolution. Specially, this goal is achieved with the classical\nmomenta of the particles on the chain and their Hilbert transform, from which\nwe construct the many-body momentum and Hilbert transformed momentum pair\ncorrelation functions yielding the real and imaginary parts of the wave\nfunction, respectively. With such wave function, we show that the classical\nchain's energy and heat spreading densities can be related to the wave\nfunction's modulus square. This relation indicates a concept of \"phonon random\nwalks\", and thus it provides a new perspective to understand ballistic heat\ntransport. The results here may give a definite answer to Feynman's idea of\nusing a classical device to simulate quantum physics.\n", "  We consider Unruh-Wald qubit detector model adopted for the far future region\nof an exactly solvable 1+1 dimensional scalar field theory in a\nRobertson-Walker expanding spacetime. It is shown that the expansion of the\nuniverse in its history enhances the decoherence of the qubit coupled with a\nscalar field. Moreover, we consider two entangled qubits, each locally coupled\na scalar field. The expansion of the universe in its history degrades the\nentanglement between the qubits, and can lead to entanglement sudden death if\nthe initial entanglement is small enough. The details depend on the parameters\ncharacterizing the expansion of the universe. This work, albeit on a toy model,\nsuggests that the history of the universe might be probed through the coherent\nand entanglement behavior of future detectors of quantum fields.\n", "  In the turbulence modeling community, significant efforts have been made to\nquantify the uncertainties in the Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS)\nmodels and to improve their predictive capabilities. Of crucial importance in\nthese efforts is the understanding of the discrepancies in the RANS modeled\nReynolds stresses. However, to what extent these discrepancies can be predicted\nor whether they are completely random remains a fundamental open question. In\nthis work we used a machine learning algorithm based on random forest\nregression to predict the discrepancies. The success of the\nregression--prediction procedure indicates that, to a large extent, the\ndiscrepancies in the modeled Reynolds stresses can be explained by the mean\nflow feature, and thus they are universal quantities that can be extrapolated\nfrom one flow to another, at least among different flows sharing the same\ncharacteristics such as separation. This finding has profound implications to\nthe future development of RANS models, opening up new possibilities for\ndata-driven predictive turbulence modeling.\n", "  Observations indicate that the Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating\nwhile the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art\nclimate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the\nArctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a\nsmall subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the\nobservations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the\nmodels are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated\ninternal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice\nchanges during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model\nLarge Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close\nrelationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea\nice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice\nretreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than\nobservations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate\nthe sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming\nin each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice\nretreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies\nthat the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we\nfind that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds\nwith too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. We\nshow that because of this, the simulations do not capture the observed\nasymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the\nmodels may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both\npolar regions.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of sub- and supersonic impinging jets with\nReynolds numbers of 3300 and 8000 are carried out to analyse their statistical\nproperties. The influence of the parameters Mach number, Reynolds number and\nambient temperature on the mean velocity and temperature fields are studied.\nFor the compressible subsonic cold impinging jets into a heated environment,\ndifferent Reynolds analogies are assesses. It is shown, that the (original)\nReynolds analogy as well as the Chilton Colburn analogy are in good agreement\nwith the DNS data outside the impinging area. The generalised Reynolds analogy\n(GRA) and the Crocco-Busemann relation are not suited for the estimation of the\nmean temperature field based on the mean velocity field of impinging jets.\nFurthermore, the prediction of fluctuating temperatures according to the GRA\nfails. On the contrary, the linear relation between thermodynamic fluctuations\nof entropy, density and temperature as suggested by Lechner et al. (2001) can\nbe confirmed for the entire wall jet. The turbulent heat flux and Reynolds\nstress tensor are analysed and brought into coherence with the primary and\nsecondary ring vortices of the wall jet. Budget terms of the Reynolds stress\ntensor are given as data base for the improvement of turbulence models.\n", "  Understanding the local structure of water at the interfaces of metallic\nelectrodes is a key problem in aqueous-based electrochemistry. Nevertheless, a\nrealistic simulation of such setup is challenging, particularly when the\nelectrodes are maintained at different potentials. To correctly compute the\neffect of an external bias potential applied to truly semi-infinite surfaces,\nwe combine Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Non-Equilibrium Green's\nFunctions (NEGF) methods. This framework allows for the out-of-equilibrium\ncalculation of forces and dynamics, and directly correlates to the chemical\npotential of the electrodes, which is the one introduced experimentally. In\nthis work, we apply this methodology to study the electronic properties and\natomic forces of one water molecule at the interface of gold surface. We find\nthat the water molecule tends to align its dipole moment with the electric\nfield, and it is either repelled or attracted to the metal depending on the\nsign and magnitude of the applied bias, in an asymmetric fashion.\n", "  We study localized nonlinear waves on a plane wave background in the multiple\nself-induced transparency (SIT) system, which describes an important\nenhancement of the amplification and control of optical waves compared to the\nsingle SIT system. A hierarchy of exact multiparametric rational solutions in a\ncompact determinant representation are presented. We demonstrate that, this\nfamily of solutions contains known rogue wave solution and unusual W-shaped\nsoliton solution, which strictly corresponds to the linear stability analysis\nthat involves modulation instability and stability regimes in the low\nperturbation frequency region. State transitions between rogue waves and\nW-shaped solitons as well as the higher-order nonlinear superposition modes are\nrevealed by the suitable choice for the background wavenumber of electric field\ncomponent. In particular, our results show that, the multiple SIT system admits\nstationary and nonstationary nonlinear modes in contrast to the results in the\nsingle SIT system. Correspondingly, the important characteristics of the\nnonlinear waves including trajectories and spectrum are revealed in detail.\n", "  We compute the gravitational waveform from a binary system in scalar-tensor\ngravity at 2PN relative order. We restrict our calculation to non-spinning\nbinary systems on quasi-circular orbits and compute the spin-weighted spherical\nmodes of the radiation. The evolution of the phase of the waveform is computed\nin the time and frequency domains. The emission of dipolar radiation is the\nlowest-order dissipative process in scalar-tensor gravity. However, stringent\nconstraints set by current astrophysical observations indicate that this effect\nis subdominant to quadrupolar radiation for most prospective gravitational-wave\nsources. We compute the waveform for systems whose inspiral is driven by: (a)\ndipolar radiation (e.g., binary pulsars or spontaneously scalarized systems)\nand (b) quadrupolar radiation (e.g., typical sources for space-based and\nground-based detectors).\n", "  We demonstrate thermalization and Bose-Einstein (BE) distribution of photons\nin standard erbium-doped fibers (edf) in a broad spectral range up to ~200nm at\nthe 1550nm wavelength regime. Our measurements were done at a room temperature\n~300K and 77K. It is a special demonstration of thermalization of photons in\nfiber cavities and even in open fibers. They are one-dimensional (1D),\nmeters-long, with low finesse, high loss and small capture fraction of the\nspontaneous emission. Moreover, we find in the edf cavities coexistence of\nthermal equilibrium (TE) and lasing without an overall inversion. The\nexperimental results are supported by a theoretical analysis based on the rate\nequations.\n", "  Dijet, dihadron, hadron-jet angular correlations have been reckoned as\nimportant probes of the transverse momentum broadening effects in relativistic\nnuclear collisions. When a pair of high-energy jets created in hard collisions\ntraverse the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, they become\nde-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the\nSudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening. For\nthe first time, we employ the systematical resummation formalism and establish\na baseline calculation to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular\ncorrelation data in $pp$ and peripheral $AA$ collisions where the medium effect\nis negligible. We demonstrate that the medium-induced broadening $\\langle\np_\\perp^2\\rangle$ and the so-called jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$ can be\nextracted from the angular de-correlations observed in $AA$ collisions. A\nglobal $\\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data\nrenders the best fit $\\langle p_\\perp^2 \\rangle \\sim 13~\\textrm{GeV}^2$ for a\nquark jet at RHIC top energy. Further experimental and theoretical efforts\nalong the direction of this work shall significantly advance the quantitative\nunderstanding of transverse momentum broadening and help us acquire\nunprecedented knowledge of jet quenching parameter in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n", "  The observation of the spin Hall effect triggered intense research on pure\nspin current transport. With the spin Hall effect, the spin Seebeck effect, and\nthe spin Peltier effect already observed, our picture of pure spin current\ntransport is almost complete. The only missing piece is the spin Nernst\n(-Ettingshausen) effect, that so far has only been discussed on theoretical\ngrounds. Here, we report the observation of the spin Nernst effect. By applying\na longitudinal temperature gradient, we generate a pure transverse spin current\nin a Pt thin film. For readout, we exploit the\nmagnetization-orientation-dependent spin transfer to an adjacent Yttrium Iron\nGarnet layer, converting the spin Nernst current in Pt into a controlled change\nof the longitudinal thermopower voltage. Our experiments show that the spin\nNernst and the spin Hall effect in Pt are of comparable magnitude, but differ\nin sign, as corroborated by first-principles calculations.\n", "  It is well known that Wheeler proposed several delayed choice experiments in\norder to show the impossibility to speak of the way a quantum system behaves\nbefore being detected. In a double-slit experiment, when do photons decide to\ntravel by one way or by two ways? Delayed choice experiments seem to indicate\nthat, strangely, it is possible to change the decision of the photons until the\nvery last moment before they are detected. This led Wheeler to his famous\nsentence: No elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a\nregistered phenomenon, brought to a close by an irreversible act of\namplification. Nevertheless some authors wrote that backward in time effects\nwere needed to explain these results. I will show that in delayed choice\nexperiments involving only one particle, a simple explanation is possible\nwithout invoking any backward in time effect. Delayed choice experiments\ninvolving entangled particles such as the so called quantum eraser can also be\nexplained without invoking any backward in time effect but I will argue that\nthese experiments cannot be accounted for so simply because they rise the whole\nproblem of knowing what a measurement and a collapse are. A previously\npresented interpretation, Convivial Solipsism, is a natural framework for\ngiving a simple explanation of these delayed choice experiments with entangled\nparticles. In this paper, I show how Convivial Solipsism helps clarifying the\npuzzling questions raised by the collapse of the wave function of entangled\nsystems.\n", "  Recently, a new functional analytic construction of quasi-free states for a\nself-dual CAR algebra has been presented in \\cite{Felix2}. This method relies\non the so-called strong mass oscillation property. We provide an example where\nthis requirement is not satisfied, due to the nonvanishing trace of the\nsolutions of the Dirac equation on the horizon of Rindler space, and we propose\na modification of the construction in order to weaken this condition. Finally,\na connection between the two approaches is built.\n", "  In the context of scalar quantum field theory we introduce a class of\ngenerically nonlinear quantum-background splits for which the splitting Ward\nidentity, encoding the single field dependence in the effective action, can be\nsolved exactly. We show that this can be used to construct an effective action\nwhich is both covariant and dependent on the background and fluctuation fields\nonly through a single total field in a way independent from the dynamics.\nMoreover we discuss the criteria under which the ultraviolet symmetries are\ninherited by the quantum effective action. The approach is demonstrated through\nsome examples, including the $O(N)$ effective field theory, which might be of\ninterest for the Higgs sector of the Standard Model or its extensions.\n", "  Recent experimental techniques in multicolor waveform synthesis allow the\ntemporal shaping of strong femtosecond laser pulses with applications in the\ncontrol of quantum mechanical processes in atoms, molecules, and\nnanostructures. Prediction of the shapes of the optimal waveforms can be done\ncomputationally using quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). In this work we\ndemonstrate the control of above-threshold photoemission of one-dimensional\nhydrogen model with pulses feasible for experimental waveform synthesis.By\nmixing different spectral channels and thus lowering the intensity requirements\nfor individual channels, the resulting optimal pulses can extend the cutoff\nenergies by at least up to 50\\% and bring up the electron yield by several\norders of magnitude. Insights into the electron dynamics for optimized\nphotoelectron emission are obtained with a semiclassical two-step model.\n", "  The celebrated Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is believed to be robust in metals as\nlong as interactions between electrons preserve their fermion-quasiparticle\ncharacter. We study thermal transport and the fate of the WF law close to a\ncontinuous metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM)\nusing cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Surprisingly, as for\nelectrical transport, we find robust and novel quantum critical scaling in\nthermal transport across the MIT. We unearth the deeper reasons for these novel\nfindings in terms of (i) the specific structure of energy-current correlations\nfor the FKM and (ii) the microscopic electronic processes which facil- itate\nenergy transport while simultaneously blocking charge transport close to the\nMIT. However, within (C)DMFT, we also find that the WF law survives at T=0 in\nthe incoherent metal right up to the MIT, even in absence of Landau\nquasiparticles.\n", "  Widefield stochastic microscopy techniques such as PALM or STORM rely on the\nprogressive accumulation of a large number of frames, each containing a scarce\nnumber of super-resolved point images. We justify that the redundancy in the\nlocalization of detected events imposes a specific limit on the temporal\nresolution. Based on a theoretical model, we derive analytical predictions for\nthe minimal time required to obtain a reliable image at a given spatial\nresolution, called image completion time. In contrast to standard assumptions,\nwe find that the image completion time scales logarithmically with the ratio of\nthe image size by the spatial resolution volume. We justify that this\nnon-linear relation is the hallmark of a random coverage problem. We propose a\nmethod to estimate the risk that the image reconstruction is not complete,\nwhich we apply to an experimental data set. Our results provide a theoretical\nframework to quantify the pattern detection efficiency and to optimize the\ntrade-off between image coverage and acquisition time, with applications to\n$1$, $2$ or $3$ dimension structural imaging.\n", "  Heavy quarks are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic hadron\ncollisions via hard scatterings and are an important tool for studying\ndifferent aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in hadronic collisions.\nCharged-particle multiplicity gives information on the global characteristics\nof the event and could be used to characterize particle production mechanisms.\nIn hadronic collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, there is a\nsignificant contribution of multi-parton interactions. The measurement of\nheavy-flavour yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity gives\ninsight into the mechanisms influencing their production in hadronic collisions\nat these energies and it is a tool to test the possible influence of\nmulti-parton interactions. Furthermore, the charged-particle multiplicity\ndependence of open heavy flavours is used to test the ability of QCD\ntheoretical models to describe the data. In ALICE, heavy-flavour production is\nmeasured via the hadronic and semi-leptonic decay channels (electrons at\ncentral rapidity and muons at forward rapidity). Charged-particle multiplicity\nis measured at central and forward rapidity. We will present the results on\nopen heavy-flavour production as a function of the charged-particle\nmultiplicity in pp and pPb collisions. Results will be compared to quarkonia\nmeasurements as well as theoretical model calculations.\n", "  We present the detailed analyses of magneto-conductivities in a Weyl\nsemimetal within Born and self-consistent Born approximations. In the presence\nof the charged impurities, the linear magnetoresistance can happen when the\ncharge carriers are mainly from the zeroth (n=0) Landau level. Interestingly,\nthe linear magnetoresistance is very robust against the change of temperature,\nas long as the charge carriers mainly come from the zeroth Landau level. We\ndenote this parameter regime as the high-field regime. On the other hand, the\nlinear magnetoresistance disappears once the charge carriers from the higher\nLandau levels can provide notable contributions. Our analysis indicates that\nthe deviation from the linear magnetoresistance is mainly due to the deviation\nof the longitudinal conductivity from the $1/B$ behavior. We found two\nimportant features of the self-energy approximation: 1. a dramatic jump of\n$\\sigma_{xx}$, when the $n=1$ Landau level begins to contribute charge\ncarriers, which is the beginning point of the middle-field regime, when\ndecreasing the external magnetic field from high field; 2. In the low-field\nregime $\\sigma_{xx}$ shows a $B^{-5/3}$ behavior and results the\nmagnetoresistance $\\rho_{xx}$ to show a $B^{1/3}$ behavior. The detailed and\ncareful numerical calculation indicates that the self-energy approximation\n(including both the Born and the self-consistent Born approximations) does not\nexplain the recent experimental observation of linear magnetoresistance in Weyl\nsemimetals.\n", "  Until now no electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) has been observed.\nWhy it is so vanishingly small, escaping detection for the last 65 years, is\nnot easy to explain. In general it is considered as one of the most sensitive\nprobes for the violation of the combined symmetry of charge and parity (CP). A\ndiscovery could shed light on the poorly understood matter/antimatter asymmetry\nof the Universe. The neutron EDM might one day help to distinguish different\nsources of CP-violation in combination with measurements of paramagnetic\nmolecules, diamagnetic atoms and other nuclei. This review presents an overview\nof the most important concepts in searches for an nEDM as well as a brief\noverview of the worldwide efforts.\n", "  The dynamics of a thin elastic sheet lubricated by a narrow layer of liquid\nis relevant to various situations and length scales. In the continuity of our\nprevious work on viscous wakes, we study theoretically the effects of an\nexternal pressure disturbance moving at constant speed along the surface of a\nthin lubricated elastic sheet. In the comoving frame, the imposed pressure\nfield creates a stationary deformation of the free interface that spatially\nvanishes in the far-field region. The shape of the wake and the way it decays\ndepend on the speed and size of the external disturbance, as well as the\nrheological properties of both the elastic and liquid layers. The wave\nresistance, namely the force that has to be externally furnished in order to\nmaintain the wake, is analyzed in detail.\n", "  We consider a new class of instantons in context of quantum field theory of a\nscalar field coupled with a chaotic background source field. We show how the\ninstanton associated to the quantum tunneling from a metastable false to the\ntrue vacuum will be corrected by an exponential enhancement factor. Possible\nimplications are discussed.\n", "  Four-lepton production in proton-proton collisions, pp to\n(Z/gamma*)(Z/gamma*) to l+l-l'+l'-, where l, l' = e or mu, is studied at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data\nsample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 inverse femtobarns. The\nZZ production cross section, sigma(pp to ZZ) = 14.6 +1.9/-1.8 (stat) +0.5/-0.3\n(syst) +/- 0.2 (theo) +/- 0.4 (lumi) pb, is measured for events with two\nopposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs produced in the mass region 60 <\nm[l+l-], m[l'+l'-] < 120 GeV. The Z boson branching fraction to four leptons is\nmeasured to be B(Z to l+l-l'+l'-) = 4.9 +0.8/-0.7 (stat) +0.3/-0.2 (syst)\n+0.2/-0.1 (theo) +/- 0.1 (lumi) x E-6 for the four-lepton invariant mass in the\nrange 80 < m[l+l-l'+l'-] < 100 GeV and dilepton mass m[l+l-] > 4 GeV for all\nopposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The results are in agreement with\nstandard model predictions.\n", "  The outcomes of quantum mechanical experiments are inherently random. It is\ntherefore necessary to develop stringent methods for quantifying the degree of\nstatistical uncertainty about the results of quantum experiments. For the\nparticularly relevant task of quantum state estimation, it has been shown that\na significant reduction in uncertainty can be achieved by taking the positivity\nof quantum states into account. However -- the large number of partial results\nand heuristics notwithstanding -- no efficient general algorithm is known that\nproduces an optimal uncertainty region from experimental data and the prior\nconstraint of positivity. Here, we make this problem precise and show that the\ngeneral case is NP-hard. Our result leaves room for the existence of efficient\napproximate solutions, and therefore does not yet imply that the practical task\nof quantum uncertainty quantification is intractable. However, it does show\nthat there exists a non-trivial trade-off between optimality and computational\nefficiency for error regions. We prove two versions of the result: One for\nfrequentist and one for Bayesian statistics.\n", "  Non-Fermi liquids are metals that cannot be adiabatically deformed into free\nfermion states. We argue for the existence of \"non-Fermi glasses,\" which are\nphases of interacting disordered fermions that are fully many-body localized,\nyet cannot be deformed into an Anderson insulator without an eigenstate phase\ntransition. We explore the properties of such non-Fermi glasses, focusing on a\nspecific solvable example. At high temperature, non-Fermi glasses have\nqualitatively similar spectral features to Anderson insulators. We identify a\ndiagnostic, based on ratios of correlation functions, that sharply\ndistinguishes between the two phases even at infinite temperature. We argue\nthat our results and diagnostic should generically apply to the\nhigh-temperature behavior of the many-body localized descendants of\nfractionalized phases.\n", "  We describe a method for calculating the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\n(RIXS) response---including the dynamics of the transient core hole---of\nmany-body systems with non-trivial gap structure encoded in their single\nparticle Green's function. Our approach introduces auxiliary fermions in order\nto obtain a form amenable to the determinant method of Benjamin et al. [PRL 112\n247002 (2014)], and is applicable to systems where interactions are most\nstrongly felt through a renormalization of the single particle propagator. As a\ntest case we consider the Yang Rice Zhang ansatz describing cuprate phenomena\nin the underdoped `pseudogap' regime, and show that including the core hole\ndynamics pushes the RIXS peaks towards higher energy transfer, improving\nagreement with experiments.\n", "  Magnetic field generation in three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection\nof an electrically conducting fluid is studied numerically by fixing the\nPrandtl number at $P=0.3$ and varying the Rayleigh number (Ra) as a control\nparameter. A recently reported route to hyperchaos involving quasiperiodic\nregimes, crises and chaotic intermittent attractors is followed, and the\ncritical magnetic Prandtl number ($P_m^c$) for dynamo action is determined as a\nfunction of Ra. A mechanism for the onset of intermittency in the magnetic\nenergy is described, the most beneficial convective regimes for dynamo action\nin this transition to weak turbulence are identified, and the impact of\nintermittency on the dependence of $P_m^c$ on Ra is discussed.\n", "  We report idealized simulations that mimic the growth of galaxy disks\nembedded in responsive halos and bulges. The disks manifested an almost\noverwhelming tendency to form strong bars that we found very difficult to\nprevent. We found that fresh bars formed in growing disks after we had\ndestroyed the original, indicating that bar formation also afflicts continued\ngalaxy evolution, and not just the early stages of disk formation. This\nbehavior raises still more insistently the previously unsolved question of how\nsome galaxies avoid bars. Since our simulations included only collisionless\nstar and halo particles, our findings may apply to gas-poor galaxies only;\nhowever the conundrum persists for the substantial unbarred fraction of those\ngalaxies. Our original objective was to study how internal dynamics rearranged\nthe distribution of mass in the disk as a generalization of our earlier study\nwith rigid spherical components. With difficulty, we were able to construct\nsome models that were not strongly influenced by bars, and found that halo\ncompression, and angular momentum exchange with the disk did not alter our\nearlier conclusion that spiral activity is largely responsible for creating\nsmooth density profiles and rotation curves.\n", "  Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in an array of double-well potentials\nrealize an effective transverse Ising model with peculiar inter-layer\ninteractions, that may result under proper conditions in an anomalous\nfirst-order ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition, and nontrivial\nphases due to frustration. The considered setup as well allows the study of\nKibble-Zurek defect formation, whose kink statistics follows that expected from\nthe universality class of the mean-field transverse Ising model in 1D.\nFurthermore, random occupation of each layer of the stack leads to random\neffective Ising interactions and generation of local transverse fields, thus\nallowing the study of Anderson-like localization of imbalance perturbations in\nthe two-well stack under controllable conditions.\n", "  With the advent of PW class lasers, the very large laser intensities\nattainable on-target should enable the production of intense high order Doppler\nharmonics from relativistic laser-plasma mirrors interactions. At present, the\nmodeling of these harmonics with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes is extremely\nchallenging as it implies an accurate description of tens of harmonic orders on\na a broad range of angles. In particular, we show here that standard Finite\nDifference Time Domain (FDTD) Maxwell solvers used in most PIC codes partly\nfail to model Doppler harmonic generation because they induce numerical\ndispersion of electromagnetic waves in vacuum which is responsible for a\nspurious angular deviation of harmonic beams. This effect was extensively\nstudied and a simple toy-model based on Snell-Descartes law was developed that\nallows us to finely predict the angular deviation of harmonics depending on the\nspatio-temporal resolution and the Maxwell solver used in the simulations. Our\nmodel demonstrates that the mitigation of this numerical artifact with FDTD\nsolvers mandates very high spatio-temporal resolution preventing doing\nrealistic 3D simulations. We finally show that non dispersive pseudo-spectral\nanalytical time domain solvers can considerably reduce the spatio-temporal\nresolution required to mitigate this spurious deviation and should enable in\nthe the near future 3D accurate modeling on supercomputers in a realistic\ntime-to-solution.\n", "  We show that carbon nanotubes (CNT) can be driven through a topological phase\ntransition using either strain or a magnetic field. This can naturally lead to\nJackiw-Rebbi soliton states carrying fractionalized charges, similar to those\nfound in a domain wall in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, in a setup with a\nspatially inhomogeneous strain and an axial field. Two types of fractionalized\nstates can be formed at the interface between regions with different strain: a\nspin-charge separated state with integer charge and spin zero (or zero charge\nand spin $\\pm \\hbar/2$), and a state with charge $\\pm e/2$ and spin $\\pm\n\\hbar/4$. The latter state requires spin-orbit coupling in the CNT. We show\nthat in our setup, the precise quantization of the fractionalized interface\ncharges is a consequence of the symmetry of the CNT under a combination of a\nspatial rotation by $\\pi$ and time reversal. Finally, we comment on the effects\nof many-body interaction on this phenomena.\n", "  By using of an appropriate transformation, it was shown that the quantum\nsystem of 4 dimensional simple harmonic oscillator can describe the motion of a\ncharged particle in the presence of a magnetic monopole field. It was shown\nthat the Dirac magnetic monopole has the hidden algebra of U(1) symmetry and by\nreducing of the dimensions of space, the U(1)*U(1) dynamical group for 4D\nharmonic oscillator quantum system was obtained. Using the group representation\nand based on explicit solution of the obtained differential equation, the\nspectrum of system was calculated.\n", "  It is shown that a highly equidistant optical frequency comb can be generated\nby the parametric excitation of an optical bottle microresonator with nanoscale\neffective radius variation by its natural mechanical vibrations.\n", "  In this work we construct a novel dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) theory\nin quadratic bath coupling environment, based an extended algebraic statistical\nquasi-particle approach. To validate the new ingredient of the underlying\ndissipaton algebra, we derive an extended Zusman equation via a totally\ndifferent approach. We prove that the new theory, if it starts with the\nidentical setup, constitutes the dynamical resolutions to the extended Zusman\nequation. Thus, we verify the generalized (non-Gaussian) Wick's theorem with\ndissipatons-pair added. This new algebraic ingredient enables the dissipaton\napproach being naturally extended to nonlinear coupling environments. Moreover,\nit is noticed that, unlike the linear bath coupling case, the influence of a\nnon-Gaussian environment cannot be completely characterized with the linear\nresponse theory. The new theory has to take this fact into account. The\ndeveloped DEOM theory manifests the dynamical interplay between dissipatons and\nnonlinear bath coupling descriptors that will be specified. Numerical\ndemonstrations will be given with the optical line shapes in quadratic coupling\nenvironment.\n", "  We construct a prequantum 2-Hilbert space for any line bundle gerbe whose\nDixmier-Douady class is torsion. Analogously to usual prequantisation, this\n2-Hilbert space has the category of sections of the line bundle gerbe as its\nunderlying 2-vector space. These sections are obtained as certain morphism\ncategories in Waldorf's version of the 2-category of line bundle gerbes. We\nshow that these morphism categories carry a monoidal structure under which they\nare semisimple and abelian. We introduce a dual functor on the sections, which\nyields a closed structure on the morphisms between bundle gerbes and turns the\ncategory of sections into a 2-Hilbert space. We discuss how these 2-Hilbert\nspaces fit various expectations from higher prequantisation. We then extend the\ntransgression functor to the full 2-category of bundle gerbes and demonstrate\nits compatibility with the additional structures introduced. We discuss various\naspects of Kostant-Souriau prequantisation in this setting, including its\ndimensional reduction to ordinary prequantisation.\n", "  Understanding and quantifying polarization in social systems is important\nbecause of many reasons. It could for instance help to avoid segregation and\nconflicts in the society or to control polarized debates and predict their\noutcomes. In this paper we present a version of the $q$-voter model of opinion\ndynamics with two types of response to social influence: conformity (like in\noriginal $q$-voter model) and anticonformity. We put the model on a social\nnetwork with the double-clique topology in order to check how the interplay\nbetween those responses impacts the opinion dynamics in a population divided\ninto two antagonistic segments. The model is analyzed analytically, numerically\nand by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that the systems\nundergoes two bifurcations as the number of cross-links between cliques\nchanges. Below the first critical point consensus in the entire system is\npossible. Thus two antagonistic cliques may share the same opinion only if they\nare loosely connected. Above that point the system ends up in a polarized\nstate.\n", "  The superconducting and normal state characteristics of yttrium hexaboride\n(YB$_6$) have been investigated for the single crystals with a transition\ntemperatures $T_c$ ranging between 6 K and 7.6 K. The extracted set of\nmicroscopic parameters [the coherence length $\\xi$(0) $\\sim$ 320$\\div$340\n${\\AA}$, the penetration depth $\\lambda$(0) $\\sim$ 1100$\\div$1600 ${\\AA}$ and\nthe mean free path of charge carriers $l$ = 31$\\div$58 ${\\AA}$, the\nGinzburg-Landau-Maki parameters $\\kappa$$_{1,2}$(0) $\\sim$ 3.3$\\div$4.8 and the\nsuperconducting gap $\\Delta$(0) $\\sim$ 10.3$\\div$14.8 K] confirms the type II\nsuperconductivity in \"dirty limit\" ($\\xi$$\\gg$ $l$) with a medium to strong\nelectron-phonon interaction (the electron-phonon interaction constant\n$\\lambda_{e-ph}$ = 0.93$\\div$0.96) and $s$-type pairing of charge carriers in\nthis compound [2$\\Delta$(0)$/k_BT_c$ $\\approx$ 4]. The comparative analysis of\ncharge transport (resistivity, Hall and Seebeck coefficients) and thermodynamic\n(heat capacity, magnetization) properties in the normal state in YB$_6$ allowed\nto detect a transition into the cage-glass state at $T^*$ $\\sim$ 50 K with a\nstatic disorder in the arrangement of the Y$^{3+}$ ions. We argue that the\nsignificant $T_c$ variations in the YB$_6$ single crystals are determined by\ntwo main factors: (i) the superconductivity enhancement is related with the\nincrease of the number of isolated vacancies, both at yttrium and boron sites,\nwhich leads to the development of an instability in the hexaboride lattice;\n(ii) the $T_c$ depression is additionally stimulated by the spin polarization\nof conduction electrons emerged and enhanced by the magnetic field in the\nvicinity of defect complexes in the YB$_6$ matrix.\n", "  In a spontaneously dimerized quantum antiferromagnet, spin-1/2 excitations\n(spinons) are confined in pairs by strings akin to those confining quarks in\nnon-abelian gauge theories. The system has multiple degenerate ground states\n(vacua) and domain walls between regions of different vacua. For two vacua, we\ndemonstrate that spinons on a domain wall are liberated, in a mechanism\nstrikingly similar to domain-wall deconfinement of quarks in variants of\nquantum chromodynamics. This observation not only establishes a novel\nphenomenon in quantum magnetism, but also provides a new direct link between\nparticle physics and condensed-matter physics. The analogy opens doors to\nimproving our understanding of particle confinement and deconfinement by\ncomputational and experimental studies in quantum magnetism.\n", "  We review recent work on the theory for pump/probe photoemission spectroscopy\nof electron-phonon mediated superconductors in both the normal and the\nsuperconducting states. We describe the formal developments that allow one to\nsolve the Migdal-Eliashberg theory in nonequilibrium for an ultrashort laser\npumping field, and explore the solutions which illustrate the relaxation as\nenergy is transferred from electrons to phonons. We focus on exact results\nemanating from sum rules and approximate numerical results which describe rules\nof thumb for relaxation processes. In addition, in the superconducting state,\nwe describe how Higg's oscillations can be excited due to the nonlinear\ncoupling with the electric field and how pumping the system can enhance\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We show that optical beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be\ngenerated even with incomplete computer generated holograms (CGH). These\nholograms are made such that random portions of it do not contain any\ninformation. We observe that although the beams produced with these holograms\nare less intense, these beams maintain their shape and that their topological\ncharges are not affected. Furthermore, we show that superposition of two or\nmore beams can be created using separate incomplete CGHs interspersed together.\nOur result is significant especially since most method to generate beams with\nOAM for various applications rely on pixelated devices or optical elements with\nimperfections.\n", "  The physical nature of any quantum source guarantees the existence of an\neffective Hilbert space of finite dimension, the physical sector, in which its\nstate is completely characterized with arbitrarily high accuracy. The\nextraction of this sector is essential for state tomography. We show that the\nphysical sector of a state, defined in some pre-chosen basis, can be\nsystematically retrieved with a procedure using only data collected from a set\nof commuting quantum measurement outcomes, with no other assumptions about the\nsource. We demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of the physical-sector\nextraction by applying it to simulated and experimental data for quantum light\nsources, as well as quantum systems of finite dimensions.\n", "  We show that, if they exist, lepton number asymmetries ($L_\\alpha$) of\nneutrino flavors should be distinguished from the ones ($L_i$) of mass\neigenstates, since Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bounds on the flavor\neigenstates cannot be directly applied to the mass eigenstates. Similarly,\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on mass eigenstates do not\ndirectly constrain flavor asymmetries. Due to the difference of mass and flavor\neigenstates, the cosmological constraint on the asymmetries of neutrino flavors\ncan be much stronger than conventional expectation, but not uniquely determined\nunless at least the asymmetry of the heaviest neutrino is well constrained.\nCosmological constraint on $L_i$ for a specific case is presented as an\nillustration.\n", "  We test whether halo age and galaxy age are correlated at fixed halo and\ngalaxy mass. The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos\ncorrelate with their large-scale density $\\rho$, an effect known as assembly\nbias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the\ndependence of galaxy stellar age on $\\rho$. To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$. However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\\rm gal}\\gtrsim\n10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\\sim 5\\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to\nhigh densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos\nusing peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation\nof $f_Q$ with $\\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the\ndata across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This\nimplies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant\nimpact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching\nprocess in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation\nhistory.\n", "  We present a measurement of two-dimensional (2D) redshift-space power\nspectrum for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11\nCMASS galaxies in the North Galactic Cap (NGC) based on the method developed by\nJing & Borner (2001). In this method, we first measure the 2D redshift-space\ncorrelation function for the CMASS galaxies, and obtain the 2D power spectrum\nbased on Fourier Transform of the correlation function. The method is tested\nwith an N-body mock galaxy catalog, which demonstrates that the method can\nyield an accurate and unbiased measurement of the redshift-space power spectrum\ngiven the input 2D correlation function is correct. Compared with previous\nmeasurements in literature that are usually based on direct Fourier Transform\nin redshift space, our method has the advantages that the window function and\nshot-noise are fully corrected. In fact, our 2D power spectrum, by its\nconstruction, can accurately reproduce the 2D correlation function, and in the\nmeanwhile can reproduce, for example, the 2D power spectrum of Beutler et al.\n(2014) accurately if ours is convolved with the window function they provided.\nThus, our measurement can facilitate a direct comparison with the theoretical\npredictions. With this accurate measurement of the 2D power spectrum, we then\ndevelop a method to measure the structure growth rate, by separating the\nanisotropic redshift-space power spectrum from the isotropic real-space power\nspectrum. We have also carefully corrected for the nonlinearities in the\nmapping from real space to redshift space, according to the theoretical model\nof Zhang et al. (2013). Finally, we obtain f(zeff)sigma_8(zeff)=0.438\\pm0.037\nat the effective redshift zeff=0.57, where f(zeff) is the linear growth rate at\nredshift zeff. The result is useful for constraining cosmological parameters.\nThe measurements of 2D power spectrum will be released soon.\n", "  We analyze recent $K^+$ meson photoproduction data from the CLAS\ncollaboration for the reactions $\\gamma p\\rightarrow K^+\\Lambda$ and $\\gamma\np\\rightarrow K^+\\Sigma_0$, fitting measured forward-angle differential cross\nsections to the form $Ae^{Bt}$. We develop a quantitative scheme for\ndetermining the kinematic region where the fit is to be done, and, from the\nextracted $t$-slope $B$, determine whether single-Reggeon exchange can explain\nthe production mechanism. We find that, in the region $5 < s < 8.1$ GeV$^2$,\nproduction of the $K^+\\Lambda$ channel can be explained by single $K^+$ Reggeon\nexchange, but the $K^+\\Sigma_0$ production channel cannot. We verify these\nconclusions by fitting the data to a differential cross section produced by the\ninterfering sum of two exponential amplitudes.\n", "  Unique optical properties of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs),\narising from quantum mechanical confinement of charge within these structures,\npresent a versatile testbed for the study of how high electric fields affect\nthe electronic structure of nanostructured solids. Earlier studies of quasi-DC\nelectric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the\nelectrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric\nfields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In\ncontrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with\nhigh-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few\npicoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD\nluminescence even in the absence of an external charge source. Our experiments\nshow that QD luminescence is associated with a remarkably high and rapid\nmodulation of the QD band-gap, which is changing by more than 0.5 eV\n(corresponding to 25% of the unperturbed bandgap energy) within the picosecond\ntimeframe of THz field profile. We show that these colossal energy shifts can\nbe consistently explained by the quantum confined Stark effect. Our work\ndemonstrates a route to extreme modulation of material properties without\nconfigurational changes in material sets or geometries. Additionally, we expect\nthat this platform can be adapted to a novel compact THz detection scheme where\nconversion of THz fields (with meV-scale photon energies) to the\nvisible/near-IR band (with eV-scale photon energies) can be achieved at room\ntemperature with high bandwidth and sensitivity.\n", "  The current status of the phenomenology of short-baseline neutrino\noscillations induced by light sterile neutrinos in the framework of 3+1 mixing\nis reviewed.\n", "  The use of multidimensional entanglement opens new perspectives for quantum\ninformation processing. However, an important challenge in practice is to\ncertify and characterize multidimensional entanglement from measurement data\nthat are typically limited. Here, we report the certification and\nquantification of two-photon multidimensional energy-time entanglement between\nmany temporal modes, after one photon has been stored in a crystal. We develop\na method for entanglement quantification which makes use of only sparse data\nobtained with limited resources. This allows us to efficiently certify an\nentanglement of formation of 1.18 ebits after performing quantum storage. The\ntheoretical methods we develop can be readily extended to a wide range of\nexperimental platforms, while our experimental results demonstrate the\nsuitability of energy-time multidimensional entanglement for a quantum repeater\narchitecture.\n", "  Unstable equilibrium solutions in a homogeneous shear flow with sinuous\nsymmetry are numerically found in large-eddy simulations (LES) with no kinetic\nviscosity. The small-scale properties are determined by the mixing length scale\n$l_S$ used to define eddy viscosity, and the large-scale motion is induced by\nthe mean shear at the integral scale, which is limited by the spanwise box\ndimension $L_z$. The fraction $ R_S= L_z/l_S$, which plays the role of a\nReynolds number, is used as a numerical continuation parameter. It is shown\nthat equilibrium solutions appear by a saddle-node bifurcation as $R_S$\nincreases, and that they resemble those in plane Couette flow with the same\nsymmetry. The vortical structures of both lower- and upper-branch solutions\nbecome spontaneously localised in the vertical direction. The lower-branch\nsolution is an edge state at low $R_S$, and takes the form of a thin critical\nlayer as $R_S$ increases, as in the asymptotic theory of generic shear flow at\nhigh-Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, the upper-branch solutions are\ncharacterised by a tall velocity streak with multi-scale multiple vortical\nstructures. At the higher end of $R_S$, an incipient multiscale structure is\nfound. The LES turbulence occasionally visits vertically localised states whose\nvortical structure resembles the present vertically localised LES equilibria.\n", "  Fluid dynamics induced by periodically forced flow around a cylinder is\nanalyzed computationally for the case when the forcing frequency is much lower\nthan the von K{\\'a}rm{\\'a}n vortex shedding frequency corresponding to the\nconstant flow velocity condition. By using the Koopman Mode Decomposition\napproach, we find a new normal form equation that extends the classical Hopf\nbifurcation normal form by a time-dependent term for Reynolds numbers close to\nthe Hopf bifurcation value. The normal form describes the dynamics of an\nobservable and features a forcing (control) term that multiplies the state, and\nis thus a parametric - i.e. not an additive - forcing effect. We find that the\ndynamics of the flow in this regime are characterized by alternating instances\nof quiescent and strong oscillatory behavior, and that this pattern persists\nindefinitely. Furthermore, the spectrum of the associated Koopman operator is\nshown to possess quasi-periodic features. We establish the theoretical\nunderpinnings of this phenomenon -- that we name Quasi-Periodic Intermittency\n-- using the new normal form model and show that the dynamics are caused by the\ntendency of the flow to oscillate between the unstable fixed point and the\nstable limit cycle of the unforced flow. The quasi-periodic intermittency\nphenomena is also characterized by positive Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents\nthat, over a long period of time, asymptotically approach zero.\n", "  We investigate the vibrational properties of Pt- and Pd-phthalocyanine (PtPc\nand PdPc) molecules on Ag(111) with high resolution electron energy loss\nspectroscopy (HREELS). In the monolayer regime, both molecules exhibit long\nrange order. The vibrational spectra prove a flat adsorption geometry. The red\nshift of vibrational modes and the presence of asymmetric vibrational peaks\nsuggest a moderate interaction of the molecules with the substrate, accompanied\nby a static charge transfer from the metal to the molecules. The appearance of\na particular vibrational mode, which (i) belongs to the $\\mathrm{B_{1g}}$\nrepresentation of the original fourfold $\\mathrm{D_{4h}}$ molecular symmetry\ngroup and which (ii) exhibits interfacial dynamical charge transfer (IDCT),\nproves that a preferential charge transfer from the Ag surface into one of the\noriginally doubly degenerate lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of\n$\\mathrm{E_g}$ symmetry takes place, i.e. the electronic degeneracy is lifted\nand the molecule-surface complex acquires the twofold symmetry group\n$\\mathrm{C_{2v}}$. The vibration-based analysis of orbital degeneracies, as\ncarried out here for PtPc/Ag(111) and PdPc/Ag(111), is not restricted to these\ncases. It is particularly useful whenever the presence of multiple molecular\nin-plane orientations at the interface makes the analysis of orbital\ndegeneracies with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy difficult.\n", "  Thermal conductivity of the lowermost mantle governs the heat flow out of the\ncore energizing planetary-scale geological processes. Yet, there are no direct\nexperimental measurements of thermal conductivity at relevant\npressure-temperature conditions of Earth's core-mantle boundary. Here we\ndetermine the radiative conductivity of post-perovskite at near core-mantle\nboundary conditions by optical absorption measurements in a laser-heated\ndiamond anvil cell. Our results show that the radiative conductivity of\nMg0.9Fe0.1SiO3 post-perovskite (< 1.2 W/m/K) is ~ 40% smaller than bridgmanite\nat the base of the mantle. By combining this result with the present-day\ncore-mantle heat flow and available estimations on the lattice thermal\nconductivity we conclude that post-perovskite is as abundant as bridgmanite in\nthe lowermost mantle which has profound implications for the dynamics of the\ndeep Earth.\n", "  Neutrino mass sum rules are an important class of predictions in flavour\nmodels relating the Majorana phases to the neutrino masses. This leads, for\ninstance, to enormous restrictions on the effective mass as probed in\nexperiments on neutrinoless double beta decay. While up to now these sum rules\nhave in practically all cases been taken to hold exactly, we will go here\nbeyond that. While the effect of the renormalisation group running can be\nvisible, the qualitative features do not change. This changes somewhat for\nmodel dependent corrections which might alter even the qualitative predictions\nbut only for large corrections and a high neutrino mass scale close to the edge\nof the current limits. This finding backs up the solidity of the predictions\nderived in the literature apart from some exceptions, and it thus marks a very\nimportant step in deriving testable and robust predictions from neutrino\nflavour models.\n", "  The Accurate Particle Tracer (APT) code is designed for large-scale particle\nsimulations on dynamical systems. Based on a large variety of advanced\ngeometric algorithms, APT possesses long-term numerical accuracy and stability,\nwhich are critical for solving multi-scale and non-linear problems. Under the\nwell-designed integrated and modularized framework, APT serves as a universal\nplatform for researchers from different fields, such as plasma physics,\naccelerator physics, space science, fusion energy research, computational\nmathematics, software engineering, and high-performance computation. The APT\ncode consists of seven main modules, including the I/O module, the\ninitialization module, the particle pusher module, the parallelization module,\nthe field configuration module, the external force-field module, and the\nextendible module. The I/O module, supported by Lua and Hdf5 projects, provides\na user-friendly interface for both numerical simulation and data analysis. A\nseries of new geometric numerical methods and key physical problems, such as\nrunaway electrons in tokamaks and energetic particles in Van Allen belt, have\nbeen studied using APT. As an important realization, the APT-SW version has\nbeen successfully distributed on the world's fastest computer, the Sunway\nTaihuLight supercomputer, by supporting master-slave architecture of Sunway\nmany-core processors.\n", "  Based on the definition of the apparent horizon in a general two-dimensional\ndilaton gravity theory, we analyze the tunnelling phenomenon of the apparent\nhorizon by using Hamilton-Jacobi method. In this theory the definition of the\nhorizon is very different from those in higher-dimensional gravity theories.\nThe spectrum of the radiation is obtained and the temperature of the radiation\nis read out from this spectrum and it satisfies the usual relationship with the\nsurface gravity. Besides, the calculation with Parikh's null geodesic method\nfor a simple example conforms to our result in general stationary cases.\n", "  The correlation between increased Sahel rainfall and reduced Saharan surface\npressure is well established in observations and global climate models, and has\nbeen used to imply that increased Sahel rainfall is caused by a stronger\nshallow meridional circulation (SMC) over the Sahara. This study uses two\natmospheric reanalyses to examine interannual variability of Sahel rainfall and\nthe Saharan SMC, which consists of northward near-surface flow across the Sahel\ninto the Sahara and southward flow near 700 hPa out of the Sahara. During wet\nSahel years, the Saharan SMC shifts poleward, producing a drop in low-level\ngeopotential and surface pressure over the Sahara. Statistically removing the\neffect of the poleward shift from the low-level geopotential eliminates\nsignificant correlations between this geopotential and Sahel precipitation. As\nthe Saharan SMC shifts poleward, its mid-tropospheric divergent outflow\ndecreases, indicating a weakening of its overturning mass flux. The poleward\nshift and weakening of the Saharan SMC during wet Sahel years is reproduced in\nan idealized model of West Africa; a wide range of imposed sea surface\ntemperature and land surface albedo perturbations in this model produce a much\nlarger range of SMC variations that nevertheless have similar quantitative\nassociations with Sahel rainfall as in the reanalyses. These results disprove\nthe idea that enhanced Sahel rainfall is caused by strengthening of the Saharan\nSMC. Instead, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the a\nstronger SMC inhibits Sahel rainfall, perhaps by advecting mid-tropospheric\nwarm and dry air into the precipitation maximum.\n", "  In the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe, a high\npressure xenon time projection chamber (HPXe-TPC) has two advantages over\nliquid xenon TPCs: a better energy resolution and the access to topological\nfeatures, which may provide extra discrimination from background events. The\nPandaX-III experiment has recently proposed a 200 kg HPXe-TPC based on\nMicromegas readout planes, to be located at the Jinping Underground Laboratory\nin China. Its detection concept is based on two results obtained within the\nT-REX project: Micromegas readouts can be built with extremely low levels of\nradioactivity; and the operation in xenon-trimethylamine at 10 bar in realistic\nexperimental conditions has proven an energy resolution of 3% FWHM at the\nregion of interest. In this work, two discrimination methods are applied to\nsimulated signal and background data in a generic 200 kg HPXe-TPC, based on two\nwell-known algorithms of graph theory: the identification of connections and\nthe search for the longest path. Rejection factors greater than 100 are\nobtained for small pixel sizes and a signal efficiency of 40%. Moreover, a new\nobservable (the blob charge density) rejects better surface contaminations,\nwhich makes the use of a trigger signal ($T_0$) not imperative in this\nexperiment.\n", "  The STEREO experiment, aiming to probe short baseline neutrino oscillations\nby precisely measuring reactor anti-neutrino spectrum, is currently under\ninstallation. It is located at short distance from the compact research reactor\ncore of the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France. Dedicated electronics,\nhosted in a single $\\mu$TCA crate, were designed for this experiment. In this\narticle, the electronics requirements, architecture and the performances\nachieved are described. It is shown how intrinsic Pulse Shape Discrimination\nproperties of the liquid scintillator are preserved and how custom adaptable\nlogic is used to improve the muon veto efficiency.\n", "  We study a moisture model for warm clouds that has been used by Klein and\nMajda as a basis for multiscale asymptotic expansions for deep convective\nphenomena. These moisture balance equations correspond to a bulk microphysics\nclosure in the spirit of Kessler and of Grabowski and Smolarkiewicz, in which\nwater is present in the gaseous state as water vapor and in the liquid phase as\ncloud water and rain water. It thereby contains closures for the phase changes\ncondensation and evaporation, as well as the processes of autoconversion of\ncloud water into rainwater and the collection of cloud water by the falling\nrain droplets. Phase changes are associated with enormous amounts of latent\nheat and therefore provide a strong coupling to the thermodynamic equation.\n  In this work we assume the velocity field to be given and prove rigorously\nthe global existence and uniqueness of uniformly bounded solutions of the\nmoisture model with viscosity, diffusion and heat conduction. To guarantee\nlocal well-posedness we first need to establish local existence results for\nlinear parabolic equations, subject to the Robin boundary conditions on the\ncylindric type of domains under consideration. We then derive a priori\nestimates, for proving the maximum principle, using the Stampacchia method, as\nwell as the iterative method by Alikakos to obtain uniform boundedness. The\nevaporation term is of power law type, with an exponent in general less or\nequal to one and therefore making the proof of uniqueness more challenging.\nHowever, these difficulties can be circumvented by introducing new unknowns,\nwhich satisfy the required cancellation and monotonicity properties in the\nsource terms.\n", "  We analyze acoustic streaming flows using an ALE perspective. The formulation\nstems from an explicit separation of time-scales resulting in two subproblems:\na first-order problem, formulated in terms of the fluid displacement at the\nfast scale, and a second-order problem formulated in terms of the Lagrangian\nflow velocity at the slow time scale. Following a rigorous time-averaging\nprocedure, the second-order problem is shown to be intrinsically steady, and\nwith exact boundary conditions at the oscillating walls. Also, as the\nsecond-order problem is solved directly for the Lagrangian velocity, the\nformulation does not need to employ the notion of Stokes drift, or any\nassociated post-processing, thus facilitating a direct comparison with\nexperiments. Because the first-order problem is formulated in terms of the\ndisplacement field, our formulation is directly applicable to more complex\nfluid-structure interaction problems in microacosutofluidic devices. After the\nformulation's exposition, we present numerical results that illustrate the\nadvantages of the formulation with respect to current approaches.\n", "  Screening mechanisms for a three-form field around a dense source such as the\nSun are investigated. Working with the dual vector, we can obtain a thin-shell\nwhere field interactions are short range. The field outside the source adopts\nthe configuration of a dipole which is a manifestly distinct behaviour from the\none obtained with a scalar field or even a previously proposed vector field\nmodel. We identify the region of parameter space where this model satisfies\npresent solar system tests.\n", "  Mass loss bridges the gap between massive stars and supernovae (SNe) in two\nmajor ways: (i) theoretically it is the amount of mass lost that determines the\nmass of the star prior to explosion, and (ii) observations of the circumstellar\nmaterial around SNe may teach us the type of progenitor that made the SN. Here,\nI present the latest models and observations of mass loss from massive stars,\nboth for canonical massive O stars, as well as very massive stars (VMS) that\nshow Wolf-Rayet type features.\n", "  Recently, Tao and Mo proposed an accurate meta-generalized gradient\napproximation for the exchange-correlation energy. The exchange part is derived\nfrom the density matrix expansion, while the correlation part is obtained by\nimproving the TPSS correlation in the low-density limit. To better understand\nthis exchange functional, in this work, we combine the TM exchange with the\noriginal TPSS correlation, which we call TMTPSS, and make a systematic\nassessment on molecular properties. The test sets include the 223 G3/99\nenthalpies of formation, 58 electron affinities, 8 proton affinities, 96 bond\nlengths, 82 harmonic frequencies, and 10 hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.\nOur calculations show that the TMTPSS functional is competitive with or even\nmore accurate than TM functional for some properties. In particular, it is the\nmost accurate nonempirical semilocal DFT for the enthalpies of formation and\nharmonic vibrational frequencies, suggesting the robustness of TM exchange.\n", "  The T2K near-detector, ND280, employs three large argon gas TPCs (Time\nProjection Chambers) for particle tracking and identification. The gas inside\nthe TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in\ngreat detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,\nneutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding\nscintillator-based detectors. We expect about 600 such events in the recorded\ndata so far (about 200 in the fiducial volume). We are able to separate those\nevents from the background and thus demonstrate the viability of using gaseous\nargon as a target for a neutrino beam. This enables us to do a cross- section\nmeasurement on gaseous argon, the first measurement of this kind. All previous\nneutrino cross-section measurements on argon were performed in liquid argon\nTPCs.\n", "  This paper considers the dynamics of scattering of planetesimals or planetary\nembryos by a planet on a circumstellar orbit. We classify six regions in the\nplanet's mass versus semimajor axis parameter space according to the dominant\noutcome for scattered objects: ejected, accreted, remaining, escaping, Oort\nCloud, depleted Oort Cloud. We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejector and architectures\nthat maximise the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris disks are usually\nconsidered classical Kuiper belt analogues. Here we consider the possibility of\ndetecting scattered disk analogues, which could be betrayed by a broad radial\nprofile and lack of small grains, as well as spherical 100-1000au mini-Oort\nClouds. Some implications for escaping planets around young stars, detached\nplanets akin to Sedna, and the formation of super-Earths, are also discussed.\n", "  The calculation of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $\\Delta$\nproduction cross sections in nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering\n$\\sigma^*_{NN\\rightarrow N\\Delta}$ has been performed within the framework of\nthe relativistic BUU approach. The N$\\Delta$ cross sections are calculated in\nBorn approximation taking into account the effective mass splitting of the\nnucleons and $\\Delta$s in asymmetric matter. Due to the different mass\nsplitting for neutron, proton and differently charged $\\Delta$s, it is shown\nthat, similar to the NN elastic ones, the reductions of N$\\Delta$ inelastic\ncross sections in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium are different from each\nother for all the individual channels and the effect is largest and of opposite\nsign for the $\\Delta^{++}$ and $\\Delta^{-}$ states. This approach is also\ncompared to calculations without effective mass splitting and with splitting\nderived from Dirac-Brueckerner (DB) calculations. The isospin dependence of the\nN$\\Delta$ cross sections is expected to influence the production of $\\pi^+$ and\n$\\pi^-$ mesons as well as their yield ratio, and thus affect the use of the\nlatter quantity as a probe of the stiffness of the symmetry energy at\nsupranormal densities.\n", "  In this letter we deduce an integral equation that allows to calculate the\nexact left-hand-cut discontinuity for an uncoupled $S$-wave partial-wave\namplitude in potential scattering for a given finite-range potential. The\nresults obtained from the $N/D$ method for the partial-wave amplitude are\nrigorous, since now the discontinuities along the left-hand cut and right-hand\ncut are exactly known. This solves the open question with respect to the $N/D$\nmethod and the effect on the final result of the non-perturbative iterative\ndiagrams in the evaluation of $\\Delta(A)$. A big advantage of the method is\nthat short-range physics (corresponding to integrated out degrees of freedom\nwithin low-energy Effective Field Theory) does not contribute to $\\Delta(A)$\nand it manifests through the extra subtractions that are implemented within the\nmethod. We show the equivalence of the $N/D$ method and the Lippmann-Schwinger\n(LS) equation for a nonsingular $^1S_0$ $NN$ potential (Yukawa potential). The\nequivalence between the $N/D$ method with one extra subtraction and the LS\nequation renormalized with one counter term or with subtractive renormalization\nalso holds for the singular attractive higher-order ChPT potentials. The $N/D$\nmethod also allows to evaluate partial-wave amplitudes with a higher number of\nextra subtractions, that we fix in terms of shape parameters within the\neffective range expansion. The result at NNLO shows that the $^1S_0$ phase\nshifts might be accurately described once the electromagnetic and charge\nsymmetry breaking terms are included. Our present results can be extended to\nhigher partial waves as well as to coupled channel scattering.\n", "  The MAJORANA Collaboration is constructing a system containing 44 kg of\nhigh-purity Ge (HPGe) detectors to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of\na future tonne-scale experiment capable of probing the neutrino mass scale to\n~15 meV. To realize this, a major goal of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR is to\ndemonstrate a path forward to achieving a background rate at or below 1\ncount/(ROI-t-y) in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) around the Q-value at\n2039 keV. This goal is pursued through a combination of a significant reduction\nof radioactive impurities in construction materials and analytical methods for\nbackground rejection, for example using powerful pulse shape analysis\ntechniques profiting from the p-type point contact HPGe detectors technology.\nThe effectiveness of these methods is assessed using simulations of the\ndifferent background components whose purity levels are constrained from\nradioassay measurements. Preliminary background results obtained during the\nengineering runs of the Demonstrator are presented.\n", "  Recent results of Kaplan et al., building on previous work by Kuwakado and\nMorii, have shown that a wide variety of classically-secure symmetric-key\ncryptosystems can be completely broken by quantum chosen-plaintext attacks\n(qCPA). In such an attack, the quantum adversary has the ability to query the\ncryptographic functionality in superposition. The vulnerable cryptosystems\ninclude the Even-Mansour block cipher, the three-round Feistel network, the\nEncrypted-CBC-MAC, and many others. In this work, we study simple algebraic\nadaptations of such schemes that replace $(\\mathbb Z/2)^n$ addition with\noperations over alternate finite groups--such as $\\mathbb Z/{2^n}$--and provide\nevidence that these adaptations are qCPA-secure. These adaptations furthermore\nretain the classical security properties (and basic structural features)\nenjoyed by the original schemes.\n  We establish security by treating the (quantum) hardness of the well-studied\nHidden Shift problem as a basic cryptographic assumption. We observe that this\nproblem has a number of attractive features in this cryptographic context,\nincluding random self-reducibility, hardness amplification, and--in many cases\nof interest--a reduction from the \"search version\" to the \"decisional version.\"\nWe then establish, under this assumption, the qCPA-security of several such\nHidden Shift adaptations of symmetric-key constructions. We show that a Hidden\nShift version of the Even-Mansour block cipher yields a quantum-secure\npseudorandom function, and that a Hidden Shift version of the Encrypted CBC-MAC\nyields a collision-resistant hash function. Finally, we observe that such\nadaptations frustrate the direct Simon's algorithm-based attacks in more\ngeneral circumstances, e.g., Feistel networks and slide attacks.\n", "  Neutrinoless double-beta decay searches seek to determine the nature of\nneutrinos, the existence of a lepton violating process, and the effective\nMajorana neutrino mass. The {\\sc Majorana} Collaboration is assembling an array\nof high purity Ge detectors to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay in\n$^{76}$Ge. The {\\sc Majorana Demonstrator} is composed of 44.8~kg (29.7 kg\nenriched in $^{76}$Ge) of Ge detectors in total, split between two modules\ncontained in a low background shield at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility in Lead, South Dakota. The initial goals of the {\\sc Demonstrator} are\nto establish the required background and scalability of a Ge-based,\nnext-generation, tonne-scale experiment. Following a commissioning run that\nbegan in 2015, the first detector module started physics data production in\nearly 2016. We will discuss initial results of the Module 1 commissioning and\nfirst physics run, as well as the status and potential physics reach of the\nfull {\\sc Majorana Demonstrator} experiment. The collaboration plans to\ncomplete the assembly of the second detector module by mid-2016 to begin full\ndata production with the entire array.\n", "  We quantify the geometric measure of entanglement in terms of mean values of\nobservables of entangled system. For pure states we find the relation of\ngeometric measure of entanglement with the mean value of spin one-half for the\nsystem composed of spin and arbitrary quantum system. The geometric measure of\nentanglement for mixed states of rank-2 is studied as well. We find the\nexplicit expression for geometric entanglement and the relation of entanglement\nin this case with the values of spin correlations. These results allow to find\nexperimentally the value of entanglement by measuring a value of the mean spin\nand the spin correlations for pure and mixed states, respectively. The obtained\nresults are applied for calculation of entanglement during the evolution in\nspin chain with Ising interaction , two-spin Ising model in transverse\nfluctuating magnetic field, Schr\\\"odinger cat in fluctuating magnetic field.\n", "  The discovery of graphene and other two-dimensional (2-D) materials has\nstimulated a general interest in low-dimensional (low-D) materials. Whereas\nlong time ago, Peierls and Landau's theoretical work demonstrated that any one-\nand two-dimensional materials could not exist in any finite temperature\nenvironment. Then, two basic issues became a central concern for many\nresearchers: How can stable low-D materials exist? What kind of low-D materials\nare stable? Here, we establish an energy stability criterion for low-D\nmaterials, which seeks to provide a clear answer to these questions. For a\ncertain kind of element, the stability of its specific low-D structure is\ndetermined by several derivatives of its interatomic potential. This\natomistic-based approach is then applied to study any straight/planar, low-D,\nequal-bond-length elemental materials. We found that 1-D monatomic chains, 2-D\nhoneycomb lattices, square lattices, and triangular lattices are the only four\npermissible structures, and the stability of these structures can only be\nunderstood by assuming multi-body interatomic potentials. Using this approach,\nthe stable existence of graphene, silicene and germanene can be explained.\n", "  It is understood that the Skyrme model has a topologically interesting\nbaryonic excitation which can model nuclei. So far no stable knotted solutions,\nof the Skyrme model, have been found. Here we investigate the dynamics of Hopf\nsolitons decaying to the vacuum solution in the Skyrme model. In doing this we\ndevelop a matrix-free numerical method to identify the minimum eigenvalue of\nthe Hessian of the corresponding energy functional. We also show that as the\nHopf solitons decay, they emit a cloud of isospinning radiation.\n", "  We propose to use oscillating spin currents with slowly varying frequency\n(chirp) to manipulate and control the magnetization dynamics in a nanomagnet.\nBy recasting the Landau-Lifshitz-Slonczewski equation in a quantum-like\ntwo-level formalism, we show that a chirped spin current polarized in the\ndirection normal to the anisotropy axis can induce a stable precession of the\nmagnetic moment at any angle (up to $90^\\circ$) with respect to the anisotropy\naxis. The drive current can be modest ($10^6\\,\\rm A/cm^2$ or lower) provided\nthe chirp rate is sufficiently slow. The induced precession is stable against\nthermal noise, even for small nano-objects at room temperature. Complete\nreversal of the magnetization can be achieved by adding a small external\nmagnetic field antiparallel to the easy axis. Alternatively, a combination of\nchirped ac and dc currents with different polarization directions can also be\nused to trigger the reversal.\n", "  The de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity admits pp-wave backgrounds on\nwhich linear fluctuations are shown to undergo time advances for all values of\nthe parameters. The perturbations may propagate in closed time-like curves\nunless the parameter space is constrained to a line. These classical phenomena\ntake place well within the theory's validity regime.\n", "  We have run a new suite of simulations that solve hydrodynamics and radiative\ntransfer simultaneously to study helium II reionization. Our suite of\nsimulations employs various models for populating quasars inside of dark matter\nhalos, which affect the He II reionization history. In particular, we are able\nto explore the impact that differences in the timing and duration of\nreionization have on observables. We examine the thermal signature that\nreionization leaves on the IGM, and measure the temperature-density relation.\nAs previous studies have shown, we confirm that the photoheating feedback from\nhelium II reionization raises the temperature of the IGM by several thousand\nkelvin. To compare against observations, we generate synthetic Ly$\\alpha$\nforest sightlines on-the-fly and match the observed effective optical depth\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}(z)$ of hydrogen to recent observations. We show that when\nthe simulations have been normalized to have the same values of\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{eff}$, the effect that helium II reionization has on observations\nof the hydrogen Ly$\\alpha$ forest is minimal. Specifically, the flux PDF and\nthe one-dimensional power spectrum are sensitive to the thermal state of the\nIGM, but do not show direct evidence for the ionization state of helium. We\nshow that the peak temperature of the IGM typically corresponds to the time of\n90%-95% helium ionization by volume, and is a relatively robust indicator of\nthe timing of reionization. Future observations of helium reionization from the\nhydrogen Ly$\\alpha$ forest should thus focus on measuring the temperature of\nthe IGM, especially at mean density. Detecting the peak in the IGM temperature\nwould provide valuable information about the timing of the end of helium II\nreionization.\n", "  Considering a Kerr black hole surrounded by the homogenous unmagnetised\nplasma medium, we study the strong gravitational lensing on the equatorial\nplane of the Kerr black hole. We find that the presence of the uniform plasma\nincreases the photon-sphere radius $r_{ps}$, the coefficient $\\bar{a},\\bar{b}$,\nthe angular position of the relativistic images $\\theta_{\\infty}$, the\ndeflection angle $\\alpha(\\theta)$ and the angular separation $s$. However the\nrelative magnitudes $r_m$ decrease in presence of the uniform plasma medium. It\nis also shown that the impact of the uniform plasma on the effect of strong\ngravitational become smaller as the spin of the Kerr black increace in prograde\norbit($a>0$). Especially, for the extreme black hole(a=0.5), the effect of\nstrong gravitational lensing in homogenous plasma medium is the same as the\ncase in vacuum for the prograde orbit.\n", "  In this technical paper we introduce the Tensor Network Theory (TNT) library\n-- an open-source software project aimed at providing a platform for rapidly\ndeveloping robust, easy to use and highly optimised code for TNT calculations.\nThe objectives of this paper are (i) to give an overview of the structure of\nTNT library, and (ii) to help scientists decide whether to use the TNT library\nin their research. We show how to employ the TNT routines by giving examples of\nground-state and dynamical calculations of one-dimensional bosonic lattice\nsystems. We also discuss different options for gaining access to the software\navailable at http://www.tensornetworktheory.org.\n", "  The role of passive body dynamics on the kinematics of swimming\nmicro-organisms in complex fluids is investigated. Asymptotic analysis of small\namplitude motions of a finite-length undulatory swimmer in a Stokes-Oldroyd-B\nfluid is used to predict shape changes that result as body elasticity and fluid\nelasticity are varied. Results from the analysis are compared with numerical\nsimulations, and the small amplitude analysis of shape changes is\nquantitatively accurate at both small and large amplitudes, even for strongly\nelastic flows. We compute a stroke-induced swimming speed that accounts for the\nshape changes, but not additional effects of fluid elasticity. Elastic induced\nshape changes lead to larger amplitude strokes for sufficiently soft swimmers\nin a viscoelastic fluid, and these stroke boosts can lead to swimming\nspeed-ups, but we find that additional effects of fluid elasticity generically\nslow down swimmers. High amplitude strokes in strongly elastic flows lead to a\nqualitatively different regime in which highly concentrated elastic stresses\naccumulate near swimmer bodies and where dramatic slow-downs are seen.\n", "  The NEXT experiment aims to observe the neutrinoless double beta decay of\nXe-136 in a high-pressure xenon gas TPC using electroluminescence to amplify\nthe signal from ionization. One of the main advantages of this technology is\nthe possibility to use the topology of events with energies close to Qbb as an\nextra tool to reject background. In these proceedings we show with data from\nprototypes that an extra background rejection factor of 24.3 +- 1.4 (stat.)%\ncan be achieved, while maintaining an efficiency of 66.7 +- 1.% for signal\nevents. The performance expected in NEW, the next stage of the experiment, is\nto improve to 12.9% +- 0.6% background acceptance for 66.9% +- 0.6% signal\nefficiency.\n", "  Deterministic simulations of the rate equations governing cluster dynamics in\nmaterials are limited by the number of equations to integrate. Stochastic\nsimulations are limited by the high frequency of certain events. We propose a\ncoupling method combining deterministic and stochastic approaches. It allows\nhandling different time scale phenomena for cluster dynamics. This method,\nbased on a splitting of the dynamics, is generic and we highlight two different\nhybrid deterministic/stochastic methods. These coupling schemes are highly\nparallelizable and specifically designed to treat large size cluster problems.\nThe proof of concept is made on a simple model of vacancy clustering under\nthermal ageing.\n", "  The dynamics of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors fundamentally\ndiffer from those in crystalline semiconductors due to the lack of long-range\norder and the high defect density. Despite intensive technology-driven research\ninterests and the existence of well-established experimental techniques, such\nas photoconductivity time-of-flight and ultrafast optical measurements, many\naspects of the dynamics of photo-excited charge carriers in amorphous\nsemiconductors remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate direct imaging of\ncarrier dynamics in space and time after photo-excitation in hydrogenated\namorphous silicon (a-Si:H) by scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM). We\nobserve an unexpected regime of fast diffusion immediately after\nphotoexcitation along with spontaneous electron-hole separation and charge\ntrapping induced by the atomic disorder. Our findings demonstrate the rich\ndynamics of hot carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors that can be\nrevealed by direct imaging based on SUEM.\n", "  The Majorana Demonstrator searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay of\n$^{76}$Ge using arrays of high-purity germanium detectors. If observed, this\nprocess would demonstrate that lepton number is not a conserved quantity in\nnature, with implications for grand-unification and for explaining the\npredominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. A problematic\nbackground in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles.\nIn the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed that are consistent\nwith energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to\na potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition\noccurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk\nonto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility. This\nleads to both a reduced prompt signal and a measurable change in slope of the\ntail of a recorded pulse. In this contribution we discuss the characteristics\nof these events and the development of a filter that can identify the\noccurrence of this delayed charge recovery, allowing for the efficient\nrejection of passivated surface alpha events in analysis.\n", "  At present the results in the field of direct dark matter search are in\ntension: the positive claim of DAMA/LIBRA versus null results from other\nexperiments. However, the comparison of the results of different experiments\ninvolves model dependencies, in particular because of the different target\nmaterials in use. The COSINUS R&D project aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic\ncalorimeter. Such a detector would not only allow for a direct comparison to\nDAMA/LIBRA, but would also provide a low(er) nuclear recoil threshold and\nparticle discrimination.\n", "  We demonstrate that surface plasmon resonances excited by photon tunneling\nthrough an adjacent dielectric medium enhance photocurrent detected by a\ngraphene photodetector. The device is created by overlaying a graphene sheet\nover an etched gap in a gold film deposited on glass. The detected\nphotocurrents are compared for five different excitation wavelengths, ranging\nfrom nm to nm. The photocurrent excited with incident p-polarized light (the\ncase for resonant surface plasmon excitation) is significantly amplified in\ncomparison with that for s-polarized light (without surface plasmon\nresonances). We observe that the photocurrent is greater for shorter\nwavelengths (for both s and p-polarizations) due to the increased photothermal\ncurrent resulting from higher damping of surface plasmons at shorter wavelength\nexcitation. Position-dependent Raman spectroscopic analysis of the\noptically-excited graphene photodetector indicates the presence of charge\ncarriers near the metallic edge. In addition, we show that the polarity of\nphotocurrent switches across the gap as the incident light spot moves across\nthe gap. Graphene-based photodetectors offer a simple architecture which can be\nfabricated on dielectric waveguides to exploit the plasmonic photocurrent\nenhancement of the evanescent field for detection. Applications for these\ndevices include photo-detection, optical sensing and direct plasmonic\ndetection.\n", "  In this research, the production cross sections for QCD matter, neutrino and\ndark energy due to acceleration of Universe is calculated. To obtain these\ncross sections, the Universe production cross section is multiplied by the\nparticle or dark energy distribution in accelerating Universe. Also missing\ncross section for each matter and dark energy due to formation of event\nhorizon, is calculated. It is clear that the cross section of particles\nproduced near event horizon of Universe is much larger for higher acceleration\nof Universe. This is because as the acceleration of Universe becomes larger,\nthe Unruh temperature becomes larger and the thermal radiations of particles\nare enhanced. There are different channels for producing Higgs boson in\naccelerating Universe. Universe maybe decay to quark and gluons, and then these\nparticles interact with each other and Higgs boson is produced. Also, some\nHiggs boson are emitted directly from event horizon of Universe. Comparing\nHiggs boson cross sections via different channels, it is observed that at lower\nacceleration, a_Universe<2.5 a_(early Universe), the Universe will not be able\nto emit Higgs, but is still able to produce a quark and eventually for\na_Universe<1.5 a_(early Universe) the Universe can only emit massless gluons.\nAs the acceleration of Universe at the LHC increases, a_Universe>2.5 a_(early\nUniverse), most of Higgs boson production will be due to Unruh effect near\nevent horizon of Universe. Finally comparing the production cross section for\ndark energy with particle cross sections, it is found that the cross section\nfor dark energy is dominated by QCD matter, Higgs boson and neutrino. This\nresult is consistent with previous predictions for dark energy cross section.\n", "  A horizontal flow of two immiscible fluid layers with different densities,\nviscosities and thicknesses, subject to vertical gravitational forces and with\nan insoluble surfactant present at the interface, is investigated. The base\nCouette flow is driven by the horizontal motion of the channel walls. Linear\nand nonlinear stages of the (inertialess) surfactant and gravity dependent\nlong-wave instability are studied using the lubrication approximation, which\nleads to a system of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the interface\nand surfactant disturbances. The linear stability is determined by an\neigenvalue problem for the normal modes. The growth rates and the amplitudes of\ndisturbances of the interface, surfactant, velocities, and pressures are found\nanalytically. For each wavenumber, there are two active normal modes. For each\nmode, the instability threshold conditions in terms of the system parameters\nare determined. In particular, it transpires that for certain parametric\nranges, even arbitrarily strong gravity cannot completely stabilize the flow.\nThe correlations of vorticity-thickness phase differences with instability,\npresent when the gravitational effects are neglected, are found to break down\nwhen gravity is important. The physical mechanisms of instability for the two\nmodes are explained with vorticity playing no role in them. Unlike the\nsemi-infinite case that we previously studied, a small-amplitude nonlinear\nsaturation of the surfactant instability is possible in the absence of gravity.\nFor certain parametric ranges, the interface deflection is governed by a\ndecoupled Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, which provides a source term for a\nlinear convection-diffusion equation governing the surfactant concentration.\nThe full numerics confirm the prediction that, along with the interface, the\nsurfactant wave is chaotic, but the ratio of the two chaotic waves is constant.\n", "  By taking advantage of symmetries with respect to the plane containing the\ndirections of the neutrino and outgoing lepton, it is possible to isolate\nneutrino interactions on hydrogen in composite nuclear targets. This technique\nenables us to study the `primary' neutrino-nucleon interaction and therefore\ngain access to fundamental model parameters free from nuclear effects. Using\nT2K Monte Carlo equivalent to $\\sim7\\times10^{21}$ POT, we present an update on\nthe measurement of the exclusive charged-current $\\mu^-$, p, $\\pi^+$ final\nstate on hydrogen.\n", "  In the search for CP violation at the T2K and future Hyper-Kamiokande\nexperiments, it is crucial to reduce the present systematic uncertainties. The\ncurrent T2K near detector, ND280, reduces the uncertainties coming from the\nneutrino beam and cross-section models from $11.9\\%$ to $5.4\\%$ in the\n$\\nu_{e}$ appearance channel. These residual uncertainties mostly come from\nintrinsic limitations of ND280 due to its difference in target material and\nangular acceptance with the far detector.\\\\ In order to show evidence\n(subsequently observation) of the CP violation in the T2K phase-II and\nHyper-Kamiokande experiments, this paper proposes an upgrade of the ND280\ndetector. It uses a 3D grid scintillator structure surrounded by Time\nProjecting Chambers in order to reconstruct particles with $\\sim 4\\pi$\nacceptance.\n", "  One aim of upcoming high-intensity laser facilities is to provide new\nhigh-flux gamma-ray sources. Electromagnetic cascades may serve for this, but\nare known to limit both field strengths and particle energies, restricting\nefficient production of photons to sub-GeV energies. Here we show how to create\na directed GeV photon source, enabled by a controlled interplay between the\ncascade and anomalous radiative trapping. Using advanced 3D QED\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and analytic estimates, we show that the\nconcept is feasible for planned peak powers of 10 PW level. A higher peak power\nof 40 PW can provide $10^9$ photons with GeV energies in a well-collimated 3 fs\nbeam, achieving peak brilliance ${9 \\times 10^{24}}$ ph\ns$^{-1}$mrad$^{-2}$mm$^{-2}$/0.1${\\%}$BW. Such a source would be a powerful\ntool for studying fundamental electromagnetic and nuclear processes.\n", "  Studies of an interesting effect of neutrino spin and spin-flavour\noscillations engenders by neutrino weak interactions with the transversally\nmoving or polarized matter are reviewed.\n", "  Event reweighting has been implemented in the NuWro neutrino event generator\nfor a number of free theory parameters in the interaction model. Event\nreweighting is a key analysis technique, used to efficiently study the effect\nof neutrino interaction model uncertainties. This opens up the possibility for\nNuWro to be used as a primary event generator by experimental analysis groups.\nA preliminary model tuning to ANL and BNL data of quasi-elastic and single pion\nproduction events was performed to validate the reweighting engine.\n", "  Jupiter's tropospheric composition is studied using high resolution\nspatially-resolved 5-micron observation from the CRIRES instrument at the Very\nLarge Telescope. The high resolving power (R=96,000) allows us to spectrally\nresolve the line shapes of individual molecular species in Jupiter's\ntroposphere and, by aligning the slit north-south along Jupiter's central\nmeridian, we are able to search for any latitudinal variability. Despite the\nhigh spectral resolution, we find that there are significant degeneracies\nbetween the cloud structure and aerosol scattering properties that complicate\nthe retrievals of tropospheric gaseous abundances and limit conclusions on any\nbelt-zone variability. However, we do find evidence for variability between the\nequatorial regions of the planet and the polar regions. Arsine (AsH$_3$) and\nphosphine (PH$_3$) both show an enhancement at high latitudes, while the\nabundance of germane (GeH$_4$) remains approximately constant. These\nobservations contrast with the theoretical predictions from Wang et al. (2016)\nand we discuss the possible explanations for this difference.\n", "  We show an efficient way to compute the electron-phonon coupling constant,\n$\\lambda$, and the superconducting transition temperature, Tc from\nfirst-principles calculations. This approach gives rapid convergence of Tc with\nrespect to the size of the k-point mesh, and is seamlessly connected to the\nformulation used in large molecular systems such as alkali fullerides where\nmomentum dependence can be neglected. Since the phonon and electron-phonon\ncalculations are time consuming particularly in complicated systems, the\npresent approach will strongly reduce the computational cost, which facilitates\nhigh-throughput superconducting material design.\n", "  It is found that nonlinear interaction of plasma wakefields driven by\ncounterpropagating laser or particle beams can efficiently generate high-power\nelectromagnetic radiation at the second harmonic of the plasma frequency. Using\na simple analytical theory and particle-in-cell simulations, we show that this\nphenomenon can be attractive for producing high-field ($\\sim 10$ MV/cm)\nnarrowband terahertz pulses with the gigawatt power level and millijoule energy\ncontent.\n", "  Analytical expression for the E1 photon strength functions (PSF) is modified\nto account for the low-energy enhancement due to nuclear structure effects\n(presence of low-energy state (LES)). A closed-form expression of the E1 PSF\nfunction includes response of two nuclear states: LES and giant diplole\nresonance (GDR). Expression for the nuclear response function on\nelectromagnetic field is based on a model of excitation of two coupled damped\nstates. These approach is tested for different data sets for spherical nuclei.\nImpact on PSF shape of coupling between LES and GDR excitations is considered.\n", "  We study the possibility of probing different texture zero neutrino mass\nmatrices at long baseline neutrino experiment DUNE. Assuming a diagonal charged\nlepton basis and Majorana nature of light neutrinos, we first classify the\npossible light neutrino mass matrices with one and two texture zeros and then\nnumerically evaluate the parameter space in terms of atmospheric mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ and Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{\\text{CP}}$ which satisfies the\ntexture zero conditions. We then feed these parameter values into the numerical\nanalysis in order to study the sensitivity of DUNE experiment to them. We find\nthat the DUNE will be able to exclude some of these texture zero mass matrices\nwhich restrict the $(\\theta_{23}-\\delta_{\\text{CP}})$ to a very specific range\nof values.\n", "  A wavelength-tunable Optical Fiber Tweezer (OFT) based on a Graded Index\nMultimode Fiber (GIMF) with a flat endface is proposed. It is shown that the\ndesign can support a trapping position which is far from the tip of the GIMF\ncompared with other common optical tweezing methods, hence reducing the\npossibility of a contact between the trapped particle and the fiber tip.\nMoreover, because of the wavelength dependence of the GIMF design parameters\nsuch the Numerical Aperture (NA), the trapping position can become\nwavelength-dependent. Therefore, the trapping position can be tuned over a long\nrange using a common wave-length tunable laser. The proposed OFT differs from\nprevious fiber-based demonstrations by using a flat-endface fiber making the\nfabrication and experiment quite easier than previously proposed\ntapered-endface OFTs.\n", "  The correlated and coupled dynamics of accretion and outflow around black\nholes (BHs) are essentially governed by the fundamental laws of conservation as\noutflow extracts matter, momentum and energy from the accretion region. Here we\nanalyzed a robust form of 2.5-dimensional viscous, resistive, advective\nmagnetized accretion-outflow coupling in BH systems, in the mean field\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) regime. We solve the complete set of coupled MHD\nconservation equations self-consistently, through invoking a generalized\npolynomial expansion in two dimensions. We perform a critical analysis of\naccretion-outflow region and provide a complete quasi-analytical family of\nsolutions for advective flows. We obtain the physical plausible outflow\nsolutions at high turbulent viscosity parameter $\\alpha \\, (\\ge 0.3)$, and at a\nreduced scale-height, as magnetic stresses compress or squeeze the flow region.\nWe found that the value of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field $\\bar B_P$\nis enhanced with increasing geometrical thickness of the accretion flow. On the\nother hand differential magnetic torque ($-r^2 \\bar B_{\\varphi} \\bar B_z$)\nincreases with the increase in $\\dot M$. $\\bar B_P$, $-r^2 \\bar B_{\\varphi}\n\\bar B_z$ as well as the plasma beta $\\beta_P$ get strongly augmented with the\nincrease in the value of $\\alpha$, enhancing the transport of vertical flux\noutwards. Our solutions indicate that magnetocentrifugal acceleration plausibly\nplays a dominant role in effusing out plasma from the radial accretion flow in\nmoderately advective paradigm which are more centrifugally dominated, however\nin strongly advective paradigm it is likely that the thermal pressure gradient\nwould play a more contributory role in the vertical transport of the plasma.\n", "  We discuss the correspondence between models solved by Bethe ansatz and\nclassical integrable systems of Calogero type. We illustrate the correspondence\nby the simplest example of the inhomogeneous asymmetric 6-vertex model\nparametrized by trigonometric (hyperbolic) functions.\n", "  Neutrino telescopes have a wide scientic scope. One of their main goals is\nthe detection of dark matter, for which they have specic advantages. Neutrino\ntelescopes offer the possibility of looking at several kinds of sources, not\nall of them available to other indirect searches. In this work we provide an\noverview of the results obtained by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, which has\nbeen taking data for almost ten years. One of the most interesting ones is the\nSun, since a detection of high energy neutrinos from it would be a very clean\nindication of dark matter, given that no signicant astrophysical backgrounds\nare expected, contrary to other indirect searches. Moreover, the limits from\nneutrino telescopes for spin-dependent cross section are the most restrictive\nones. Another interesting source is the Galactic Centre, for which ANTARES has\na better visibility than IceCube, due to its geographical location. This search\ngives limits on the annihilation cross section. Other dark matter searches\ncarried out in ANTARES include the Earth and dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We study ballistic hole transport through Ge/Si core/shell nanowires at low\ntemperatures. We observe Fabry-P$\\acute{e}$rot interference patterns as well as\nconductance plateaus at integer multiples of 2e$^2$/h at zero magnetic field.\nMagnetic field evolution of these plateaus reveals large effective\nLand$\\acute{e}$ g-factors. Ballistic effects are observed in nanowires with\nsilicon shell thicknesses of 1 - 3 nm, but not in bare germanium wires. These\nfindings inform the future development of spin and topological quantum devices\nwhich rely on ballistic subband-resolved transport.\n", "  Recent work [1,2] suggests that ferromagnetic reversal with spin transfer\ntorque (STT) requires more current in a system in the presence of DMI than\nswitching a typical ferromagnet of the same dimensions and perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, DMI promotes stabilization of skyrmions and\nwe report that when the perpendicular anisotropy is modulated (reduced) for\nboth the skyrmion and ferromagnet, it takes much smaller current to reverse the\nfixed skyrmion than to reverse the ferromagnet in the same time, or the\nskyrmion reverses much faster than the ferromagnet at similar levels of\ncurrent. We show with rigorous micromagnetic simulations and energy portraits\nthat the skyrmion switching proceeds along a different path at very low PMA\nwhich results in a significant reduction in the spin current required or time\nrequired for reversal. This can have potential for memory application where a\nrelatively simple modification of the standard STT-RAM to include a heavy metal\nadjacent to the soft magnetic layer and with appropriate design of the tunnel\nbarrier can lead to energy efficient and fast magnetic memory device based on\nthe reversal of fixed skyrmions.\n", "  The MINERvA collaboration has reported a Charged-Current inclusive (CCinc)\ncross-section measurement on a CH target. This was performed by looking at both\nthe muon and hadronic final state particles to create a double differential\ncross-section distribution that provides additional insight into the different\nregions of the phase-space where nuclear effects are present. We show early\ncomparisons of the NEUT and NuWro generators in an attempt to estimate which\nparts of the models are in agreement with this data.\n", "  The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of polycrystalline samples of\n$Ln$O$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ ($Ln$ = La, Nd) at ambient pressure (tetragonal\nstructure) and high pressure (HP) (monoclinic structure) have been investigated\nvia electrical resistivity measurements at various magnetic fields up to 8.5 T.\nThe $H_{c2}$($T$) curves for all the samples show an uncharacteristic concave\nupward curvature at temperatures below $T_c$, which cannot be described by the\nconventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory. For the\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ sample under HP, as temperature is decreased, the\nupper critical field $H_{onset}$, estimated from the onset of the\nsuperconducting transitions, increases slowly between 4.9 and 5.8 T compared\nwith the slope of $H_{onset}$($T$) below 4.9 T and above 5.8 T. This anomalous\nbehavior reveals a remarkable similarity in superconductivity between\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ samples measured under HP and synthesized under\nHP, although the crystal structures of the two samples were reported to be\ndifferent. The experimental results support the idea that local atomic\nenvironment, which can be tuned by applying external pressure and can be\nquenched to ambient pressure via high temperature-pressure annealing, is\npossibly more essential to the enhancement of $T_c$ for BiS$_2$-based\nsuperconductors than the structural phase transition. On the other hand, such\nanomalous behavior is very subtle in the case of NdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$\nunder HP, suggesting that the anisotropy of the upper critical field in the\n$ab$-plane and the possible lattice deformation induced by external pressure is\nweak. This explains why the pressure-induced enhancement of $T_c$ for\nNdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ is not as large as that for\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$.\n", "  Electronic logic gates are the basic building blocks of every computing and\nmicro controlling system. Logic gates are made of switches, such as diodes and\ntransistors. Ion-selective, ionic switches may emulate electronic switches\n[1-8]. If we ever want to create artificial bio-chemical circuitry, then we\nneed to move a step further towards ion-logic circuitry. Here we demonstrate\nion XOR and OR gates with electrochemical cells, and specifically, with two\nwet-cell batteries. In parallel to vacuum tubes, the batteries were modified to\ninclude a third, permeable and conductive mid electrode (the gate), which was\nplaced between the anode and cathode in order to affect the ion flow through\nit. The key is to control the cell output with a much smaller biasing power, as\ndemonstrated here. A successful demonstration points to self-powered ion logic\ngates.\n", "  We present a study of the inner (out to $\\sim$1 R$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) stellar\npopulations of 9 shell galaxies. We derive stellar population parameters from\nlong slit spectra by both analyzing the Lick indices of the galaxies and by\nfitting Single Stellar Population model spectra to the full galaxy spectra. The\nresults from the two methods agree reasonably well. Many of the shell galaxies\nin our sample appear to have lower central $\\mathrm{Mg}_{2}$ index values than\nnon-shell galaxies of the same central velocity dispersion, which is likely due\nto a past interaction event. Our shell galaxy sample shows a relation between\ncentral metallicity and velocity dispersion that is consistent with previous\nsamples of non-shell galaxies. Analyzing the metallicity gradients in our\nsample, we find an average metallicity gradient of -0.16$\\pm$0.10 dex per\ndecade in radius. We compare this with formation models to constrain the\nmerging history of shell galaxies. We argue that our galaxies likely have\nundergone major mergers in their past but it is unclear whether the shells\nformed from these events or from separate minor mergers. Additionally, we find\nevidence for young stellar populations ranging in age from 500 Myr to 4--5 Gyr\nin four of the galaxies, allowing us to speculate on the age of the shells. For\nNGC 5670, we use a simple dynamical model to find the time required to produce\nthe observed distribution of shells to be consistent with the age of the young\nsubpopulation, suggesting that the shells likely formed from the same event\nthat led to the young subpopulation.\n", "  I derive a universal upper bound on the capacity of any communication channel\nbetween two distant systems. The Holevo quantity, and hence the mutual\ninformation, is at most of order $E \\Delta t / \\hbar$, where $E$ is the average\nenergy of the signal, and $\\Delta t$ is the amount of time for which detectors\noperate. The bound does not depend on the size or mass of the emitting and\nreceiving systems, nor on the nature of the signal. No restrictions on\npreparing and processing the signal are imposed.\n  As an example, I consider the encoding of information in the transverse or\nangular position of a signal emitted and received by systems of arbitrarily\nlarge cross-section. In the limit of a large message space, quantum effects\nbecome important even if individual signals are classical, and the bound is\nupheld.\n", "  We study extensions of the Twin Higgs model that solve the Hierarchy problem\nand simultaneously address problems of the large- and small-scale structures of\nthe Universe. Besides naturally providing dark matter (DM) candidates as the\nlightest charged twin fermions, the twin sector contains a light photon and\nneutrinos, which can modify structure formation relative to the prediction from\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We focus on two scenarios. First, we study a\nFraternal Twin Higgs model in which the spin-3/2 baryon\n$\\hat{\\Omega}\\sim(\\hat{b}\\hat{b}\\hat{b})$ and the lepton twin tau $\\hat{\\tau}$\ncontribute to the dominant and subcomponent dark matter densities. A\nnon-decoupled scattering between the twin tau and twin neutrino arising from a\ngauged twin lepton number symmetry provides a drag force that damps the density\ninhomogeneity of a dark matter subcomponent. Next, we consider the possibility\nof having the twin hydrogen atom $\\hat{H}$ as the dominant DM component. After\nrecombination, a small fraction of the twin protons and leptons remains ionized\nduring structure formation, and their scattering to twin neutrinos through a\ngauged U$(1)_{B-L}$ force provides the mechanism that damps the density\ninhomogeneity. Both scenarios realize the Partially Acoustic dark matter\n(PAcDM) scenario and explain the $\\sigma_8$ discrepancy between the CMB and\nweak lensing results. Moreover, the self-scattering neutrino behaves as a dark\nfluid that enhances the size of the Hubble rate $H_0$ to accommodate the local\nmeasurement result while satisfying the CMB constraint. For the small-scale\nstructure, the scattering of $\\hat{\\Omega}$'s and $\\hat{H}$'s through the twin\nphoton exchange generates a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model that\nsolves the mass deficit problem from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales.\n", "  Synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators (SPOPOs) are optical\ncavities containing a nonlinear crystal capable of down-converting a frequency\ncomb to lower frequencies. These have received a lot of attention lately,\nbecause their intrinsic multimode nature makes them compact sources of quantum\ncorrelated light with promising applications in modern quantum information\ntechnologies. In this work we show that SPOPOs are also capable of accessing\nthe challenging but interesting regime where spontaneous symmetry breaking\nplays a crucial role in the quantum properties of the emitted light, difficult\nto access with any other nonlinear optical cavity. Apart from opening the\npossibility of studying experimentally this elusive regime of dissipative phase\ntransitions, our predictions will have a practical impact, since we show that\nspontaneous symmetry breaking provides a specific spatiotemporal mode with\nperfect squeezing for any value of the system parameters, turning SPOPOs into\nrobust sources of highly nonclassical light above threshold.\n", "  We present the results of numerical study of the phase dynamics of the\nDC-SQUID with topologically trivial and nontrivial barriers. In our\ncalculations we take into account two components of supperconducting current,\nCooper pairs ($2\\pi$-periodic) and Majorana fermions ($4\\pi$-periodic)\ncurrents. Magnetic field dependence of return current is presented. The\nqualitative behavior of this dependence is explained. We show that in case of\ntwo component superconducting current the periodicity of magnetic field\ndependence of return current displaced by Cooper pairs and Majorana fermion\nratio over the magnetic field. This effect makes possible the experimental\ndetermination of ratio of Cooper pairs and Majorana fermions currents.\n", "  It has been proposed that the states of fully many-body localized systems can\nbe described in terms of conserved local pseudospins. Due to the multitude of\nways to define these, the explicit identification of the optimally local\npseudospins in specific systems is non-trivial. Given continuing intense\ninterest in the role of disorder in strongly correlated systems, we consider\nthe disordered Hubbard model. Focusing on a two-site system, we track the\nevolution of the optimally localized pseudospins as hopping and interactions\nare varied to move the system away from the trivially localized atomic limit,\nexamining the explicit form of the pseudospins and exploring the broad\ndistribution of non-optimal forms.\n", "  In this work we continue and extend our recent work on the correlation energy\nof the quantized electron gas of uniform density at temperature $T=0$. As\nbefore we utilize the methods, properties, and results obtained by means of\nclassical statistical mechanics. These were extended to quantized systems via\nthe Feynman path integral formalism. The latter translates the quantum problem\ninto a classical polymer problem in four dimensions. Again the well known RPA\n(random phase approximation) is recovered as a basic result which we then\nmodify and improve upon. Here we will we focus upon thermodynamic\nself-consistency. Our numerical calculations exhibit a remarkable agreement\nwith well known results of a standard parametrization of Monte Carlo\ncorrelation energies.\n", "  Collective behaviour in biological systems pitches us against theoretical\nchallenges way beyond the borders of ordinary statistical physics. The lack of\nconcepts like scaling and renormalization is particularly grievous, as it\nforces us to negotiate with scores of details whose relevance is often hard to\nassess. In an attempt to improve on this situation, we present here\nexperimental evidence of the emergence of dynamic scaling laws in natural\nswarms. We find that spatio-temporal correlation functions in different swarms\ncan be rescaled by using a single characteristic time, which grows with the\ncorrelation length with a dynamical critical exponent z~1. We run simulations\nof a model of self-propelled particles in its swarming phase and find z~2,\nsuggesting that natural swarms belong to a novel dynamic universality class.\nThis conclusion is strengthened by experimental evidence of non-exponential\nrelaxation and paramagnetic spin-wave remnants, indicating that previously\noverlooked inertial effects are needed to describe swarm dynamics. The absence\nof a purely relaxational regime suggests that natural swarms are subject to a\nnear-critical censorship of hydrodynamics.\n", "  An adaptive moving mesh finite difference method is presented to solve two\ntypes of equations with dynamic capillary pressure term in porous media. One is\nthe non-equilibrium Richards Equation and the other is the modified\nBuckley-Leverett equation. The governing equations are discretized with an\nadaptive moving mesh finite difference method in the space direction and an\nimplicit-explicit method in the time direction. In order to obtain high quality\nmeshes, an adaptive time-dependent monitor function with directional control is\napplied to redistribute the mesh grid in every time step, and a diffusive\nmechanism is used to smooth the monitor function. The behaviors of the central\ndifference flux, the standard local Lax-Friedrich flux and the local\nLax-Friedrich flux with reconstruction are investigated by solving a 1D\nmodified Buckley-Leverett equation. With the moving mesh technique, good mesh\nquality and high numerical accuracy are obtained. A collection of\none-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical experiments is presented to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "  Recent advances have suggested that spacetime itself emerges from the\nentanglement of the quantum degrees of freedom living on the boundary. In the\ncase of the AdS spacetimes, a particular class of tensor networks has been\nshown to realize the same via Multi-Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz\n(MERA). In this paper we suggest a prescription for the dS/MERA correspondence\nand recover a discrete version of de Sitter Penrose diagram by using the MERA\non conformal theories identified with the future/past conformal boundaries of\nthe de Sitter spacetime. As anticipated, time appears as the emergent\ndirection. We comment on the possible interpretation that the de Sitter\ncosmological horizon entropy involves entanglement with degrees of freedom\nacross the cosmological horizon as well as the implications of our construction\nfor cosmology.\n", "  We show that when the dynamical dimension of the $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ operator is\nreduced from three to two in a fermion electrodynamics with scaling, a\n$g(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^2+g(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^5\\psi)^2$ four-fermion interaction\nwhich is dressed by this electrodynamics becomes renormalizable. In the\nfermion-antifermion scattering amplitude every term in an expansion to\narbitrary order in $g$ is found to diverge as just a single ultraviolet\nlogarithm (i.e. no log squared or higher), and is thus made finite by a single\nsubtraction. While not necessary for renormalizability per se, the reduction in\nthe dimension of $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ to two leads to dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking in the infrared, with the needed subtraction then automatically being\nprovided by the theory itself through the symmetry breaking mechanism, with\nthere then being no need to introduce the subtraction by hand. Since the vector\nand axial vector currents are conserved, they do not acquire any anomalous\ndimension, with the four-fermion $(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\psi)^2$ and\n$(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma^5\\psi)^2$ interactions instead having to be\ncontrolled by the standard Higgs mechanism.\n", "  Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations many ideas have been put forward\nto explain the special features of the leptonic mixing and the differences with\nrespect to the quark sector. In this talk I review some of these proposals,\nemphasizing especially their predictability. In the light of the new data, I\nfirst revisit fixed-point relations among mixing angles and phases. Then I\nbriefly comment on radiative neutrino masses. Finally I discuss the role of\nflavour symmetries. Given the very many existing models I focus on two classes\nof models. On the one hand I illustrate the ability of models based on a\ngeneralization of the anarchy idea in reproducing the main features of both the\nquark and the lepton spectrum, also in a GUT framework. On the other hand I\ndiscuss less ambitious but more predictive models based on discrete flavour\nsymmetries, centered on the properties of the leptonic mixing matrix.\n", "  Homework in introductory physics represents an important part of a student's\nlearning experience; therefore choosing the manner in which homework is\npresented merits investigation. We performed three rounds of clinical trials\ncomparing the effects of mastery-style homework vs traditional-style homework\nwith students in both algebra-based and calculus-based introductory mechanics.\nResults indicate a benefit from mastery-style over traditional-style homework,\nprincipally for weaker students who are less familiar with the material being\ncovered and on questions that are nearer transfer to the study materials.\n", "  The number of phase wraps in 2D wrapped phase map can be completely\neliminated, or greatly reduced by frequency shifting. But the wraps usually\ncannot be optimally reduced using the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT)\nbecause the spectrum can be shifted only by an integer number in the frequency\ndomain. In order to completely eliminate the phase wraps or achieve a\nsignificant phase wrap reduction, in this paper, we propose a fast and precise\ntwo-step method for phase wraps reduction, which uses the iterative local\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) to determine the sub-pixel spectral peak\nlocation and the frequency shifting algorithm that operates in spatial domain\nto reduce the number of phase wraps. Firstly, an initial estimate of the\nfrequency peak is obtain by FFT, then the sub-pixel spectral peak with high\nresolution is determined by iteratively upsampling the local DFT around the\ninitial spectral peak location, further the non-integer frequency shifting in\nspatial domain is realized to eliminate or reduce the number of phase wraps.\nFinally, simulations and experiments are conducted to prove the validity of the\nproposed method. The results demonstrate the proposed method's superb computing\nefficiency, high resolution and overall performance.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the performance of time-reversal (TR) techniques in\nconjunction with various Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) pre-processing methods\naimed at improving detection of subsurface targets. TR techniques were first\ndeveloped for ultrasound applications and, by exploiting the invariance of the\nwave equation under time reversal, can yield features such as superresolution\nand statistical stability. The TR method was examined here using both synthetic\nand actual GPR field data under four different pre-processing strategies on the\nraw data, namely: mean background removal, eigenvalue background removal, a\nsliding-window space-frequency technique, and a noise-robust spatial\ndifferentiator along the scan direction. Depending on the acquisition mode, it\nwas possible to determine with good precision the position and depth of the\nstudied targets as well as, in some cases, to differentiate the targets from\nnearby clutter such as localized geological anomalies. The proposed methodology\nhas the potential to be useful when applied to GPR data for the detection of\nburied targets.\n", "  This paper presents an arbitrary h.o. accurate ADER DG method on space-time\nadaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear\ntime dependent PDE for compr. dissipative flows: the compr. Navier-Stokes\nequations and the equations of visc. and res. MHD in 2 and 3 space-dimensions.\nThe work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and\napplication of a proper a posteriori subcell FV limiting procedure suitable for\nDG methods. It is a well known fact that a major weakness of h.o. DG methods\nlies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate\nspurious oscillations, namely the so-called 'Gibbs phenomenon'. In the present\nwork the main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness\neven in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical\ndiffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a\nproper sub-grid. An important feature of our new scheme is its ability to cure\neven floating point errors that may occur during a simulation, for example when\ntaking real roots of negative numbers or after divisions by zero. We apply the\nwhole approach for the first time to the equations of compr. gas dynamics and\nMHD in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic\nresistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to\ncases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state\nvector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical\nscheme stands out against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the\ncompr. Navier-Stokes and the viscous and resistive MHD equations. The present\nresults show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes\nare significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement\nimplementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).\n", "  We present a conjugate analysis of two different dark energy models\ninvestigating both their agreement with recent data and their thermodynamical\nproperties. The successful match with the data allows to both constrain the\nmodel parameters and characterize their kinematical properties. As a novel\nstep, we exploit the strong connection between gravity and thermodynamics to\nfurther check models viability by investigating their thermodynamical\nquantities. In particular, we study whether the cosmological scenario fulfills\nthe generalized second law of thermodynamics and, moreover, we contrast the two\nmodel asking whether the evolution of the total entropy is in agreement with\nthe expectation for a closed system. As a general result, we discuss whether\nthermodynamic constraints can be a valid complementary way to both constrain\ndark energy models and differentiate among rival scenarios.\n", "  The nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger/Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation is considered\nin the presence of three equally-spaced potentials. The problem is reduced to a\nfinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system by a Galerkin truncation. Families of\noscillatory orbits are sought in the neighborhoods of the system's nine\nbranches of standing wave solutions. Normal forms are computed in the\nneighborhood of these branches' various Hamiltonian Hopf and saddle-node\nbifurcations, showing how the oscillatory orbits change as a parameter is\nincreased. Numerical experiments show agreement between normal form theory and\nnumerical solutions to the reduced system and NLS/GP near the Hamiltonian Hopf\nbifurcations and some subtle disagreements near the saddle-node bifurcations\ndue to exponentially small terms in the asymptotics.\n", "  We present results for the isospin-0 $\\pi\\pi$ s-wave scattering length\ncalculated with Osterwalder-Seiler valence quarks on Wilson twisted mass gauge\nconfigurations. We use three $N_f = 2$ ensembles with unitary (valence) pion\nmass at its physical value (250$\\sim$MeV), at 240$\\sim$MeV (320$\\sim$MeV) and\nat 330$\\sim$MeV (400$\\sim$MeV), respectively. By using the stochastic Laplacian\nHeaviside quark smearing method, all quark propagation diagrams contributing to\nthe isospin-0 $\\pi\\pi$ correlation function are computed with sufficient\nprecision. The chiral extrapolation is performed to obtain the scattering\nlength at the physical pion mass. Our result $M_\\pi a^\\mathrm{I=0}_0 =\n0.198(9)(6)$ agrees reasonably well with various experimental measurements and\ntheoretical predictions. Since we only use one lattice spacing, certain\nsystematics uncertainties, especially those arising from unitary breaking, are\nnot controlled in our result.\n", "  Weakly conducting dielectric liquid drops suspended in another dielectric\nliquid and subject to an applied uniform electric field exhibit a wide range of\ndynamical behaviors contingent on field strength and material properties. These\nphenomena are best described by the Melcher-Taylor leaky dielectric model,\nwhich hypothesizes charge accumulation on the drop-fluid interface and\nprescribes a balance between charge relaxation, the jump in Ohmic currents from\nthe bulk and charge convection by the interfacial fluid flow. Most previous\nnumerical simulations based on this model have either neglected interfacial\ncharge convection or restricted themselves to axisymmetric drops. In this work,\nwe develop a three-dimensional boundary element method for the complete leaky\ndielectric model to systematically study the deformation and dynamics of liquid\ndrops in electric fields. The inclusion of charge convection in our simulations\npermits us to investigate drops in the Quincke regime, in which experiments\nhave demonstrated a symmetry-breaking bifurcation leading to steady\nelectrorotation. Our simulation results show excellent agreement with existing\nexperimental data and small-deformation theories.\n", "  Metamaterials made of periodic collections of dielectric nanorods are\nconsidered theoretically. When quantum resonators are embedded within the\nnanorods, one obtains a quantum metamaterial, whose electromagnetic properties\ndepend upon the state of the quantum resonators. The theoretical model predicts\nthat when the resonators are pumped and reach the inversion regime, the quantum\nmetamaterial exhibits an all-optical switchable conduction band. The phenomenon\ncan be described by considering the pole stucture of the scattering matrix of\nthe metamaterial.\n", "  The spectral response of a plasmonic nanostructure may heavily depend on the\nrefractive index of its surroundings. The key idea of this paper is to control\nthis response by coherent optical means, i.e. with an optically controlled\nelectromagnetically-induced-transparency medium. In such environment, an\nexternal laser provides a knob to shift the position of plasmonic resonances\nwithout the need to change the geometry of the nanostructure. Additionally, the\nsetup can be exploited to excite narrow-band surface plasmon polaritons.\n", "  Recently, the LIGO observatory reported the first direct observation of\ngravitational waves, with a signal consistent with a binary black hole merger.\nThis detection triggered several follow-up searches for coincident emission in\nelectromagnetic waves as well as neutrinos, but no such emission was found. In\nthis article, the implications of the non-detection of counterpart neutrinos\nare investigated using general arguments. The results are interpreted with a\nparameter denoting the energy emitted in neutrinos relative to the energy\nemitted in gravitational waves. The bound on this parameter from the diffuse\nastrophysical neutrino flux detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is\ndiscussed. It is found that, currently, the non-detection of counterpart\nneutrinos puts a bound comparable to the one from the diffuse astrophysical\nneutrino flux. This bound is then used to constrain the amount of matter in the\nblack hole binary environment. Finally, the sensitivity to this parameter in\nfuture gravitational wave observation runs is investigated. It is shown how the\ndetection of one or more neutrinos from a single merger would strongly\nconstrain the source population and evolution.\n", "  Modern transient surveys have begun discovering and following supernovae\n(SNe) shortly after first light---providing systematic measurements of the rise\nof Type II SNe. We explore how analytic models of early shock-cooling emission\nfrom core-collapse SNe can constrain the progenitor's radius, explosion\nvelocity, and local host extinction. We simulate synthetic photometry in\nseveral realistic observing scenarios and, assuming the models describe the\ntypical explosions well, find that ultraviolet observations can constrain the\nprogenitor's radius to a statistical uncertainty of $\\pm10-15\\%$, with a\nsystematic uncertainty of $\\pm 20\\%$. With these observations the local host\nextinction ($A_V$) can be constrained to a factor of two and the shock velocity\nto $\\pm 5\\%$ with a systematic uncertainty of $\\pm 10\\%$. We also re-analyze\nthe SN light curves presented in Garnavich et al. (2016) and find that KSN\n2011a can be fit by a blue supergiant model with a progenitor radius of $R_s <\n7.7 + 8.8 {\\rm (stat)} + 1.9 {\\rm (sys)}R_\\odot$, while KSN 2011d can be fit\nwith a red supergiant model with a progenitor radius of $R_s = 111_{-21 {\\rm\n(stat)}}^{+89 {\\rm (stat)}} \\phantom{}_{-1{\\rm (sys)}}^{+49 {\\rm (sys)}}$. Our\nresults do not agree with those of Garnavich et al. (2016). Moreover, we\nre-evaluate their claims and find that there is no statistically significant\nevidence for a shock breakout flare in the light curve of KSN 2011d.\n", "  The origin of the isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB) --- the portion of\nthe extragalactic gamma-ray sky that is not resolvable into individual point\nsources --- provides a powerful probe into the evolution of the high-energy\nuniverse. Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are among the most likely contributors\nto the IGRB, though their contribution is difficult to constrain because their\nflux distribution is dominated by numerous faint sources. We produce a novel\njoint-likelihood analysis of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from 584 SFGs, utilizing\nadvanced statistical techniques to compare the distribution of low-significance\nexcesses against the non-Poissonian $\\gamma$-ray background fluctuations. We\nfirst examine the theoretically well-motivated relationship between the far-IR\nand $\\gamma$-ray luminosities of SFGs, utilizing a model where the $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity is given by log$_{10}$(L$_\\gamma$/(erg s$^{-1}$)) = $\\alpha$\nlog$_{10}$(L$_{IR}$/(10$^{10}$L$_\\odot$)) + $\\beta$. We calculate best-fit\nparameters $\\alpha$ = 1.18 $\\pm$ 0.15, $\\beta$ = 38.49 $\\pm$ 0.24, with a\nlog-normal dispersion in this relationship given by $\\sigma$ = 0.39 $\\pm$ 0.12.\nThe best-fit values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are consistent with previous\nstudies. We find a larger dispersion in the far-IR to $\\gamma$-ray correlation\nthan previous studies. This dispersion is significant at the level of\n5.7$\\sigma$. These results imply that SFGs significantly contribute to the\nIGRB, producing between 61.0$^{+30.2}_{-18.3}\\%$ of the total IGRB intensity\nabove an energy of 1 GeV. Along with recent works, this strongly indicates that\nmultiple source classes provide comparable contributions to the IGRB intensity.\nWe discuss the implication of these results for the interpretation of the\nIceCube neutrinos.\n", "  Understanding interactions between microparticles and lipid membranes is of\nincreasing importance, especially for unraveling the influence of microplastics\non our health and environment. Here, we study how a short-ranged adhesive force\nbetween microparticles and model lipid membranes causes membrane-mediated\nparticle assembly. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the initial particle\nattachment to the membrane, then particle wrapping, and in rare cases\nspontaneous membrane tubulation. In the attached state, we measure that the\nparticle mobility decreases by 26%. If multiple particles adhere to the same\nvesicle, their initial single-particle state determines their interactions and\nsubsequent assembly pathways: 1) attached particles only aggregate when small\nadhesive vesicles are present in solution, 2) wrapped particles reversibly\nattract one another by membrane deformation, and 3) a combination of wrapped\nand attached particles form membrane-mediated dimers, which further assemble\ninto a variety of complex structures. The experimental observation of distinct\nassembly pathways induced only by a short ranged membrane-particle adhesion,\nshows that a cellular cytoskeleton or other active components are not required\nfor microparticle aggregation. We suggest that this membrane-mediated\nmicroparticle aggregation is a reason behind reported long retention times of\npolymer microparticles in organisms.\n", "  We conduct the first detailed analysis in quantum information of recently\nderived operator relations from the study of quantum one-way local operations\nand classical communications (LOCC). We show how operator structures such as\noperator systems, operator algebras, and Hilbert C*-modules all naturally arise\nin this setting, and we make use of these structures to derive new results and\nnew derivations of some established results in the study of LOCC. We also show\nthat perfect distinguishability under one-way LOCC and under arbitrary\noperations is equivalent for several families of operators that appear jointly\nin matrix and operator theory and quantum information theory.\n", "  The study of granular crystals, metamaterials that consist of closely packed\narrays of particles that interact elastically, is a vibrant area of research\nthat combines ideas from disciplines such as materials science, nonlinear\ndynamics, and condensed-matter physics. Granular crystals, a type of nonlinear\nmetamaterial, exploit geometrical nonlinearities in their constitutive\nmicrostructure to produce properties (such as tunability and energy\nlocalization) that are not conventional to engineering materials and linear\ndevices. In this topical review, we focus on recent experimental,\ncomputational, and theoretical results on nonlinear coherent structures in\ngranular crystals. Such structures --- which include traveling solitary waves,\ndispersive shock waves, and discrete breathers --- have fascinating dynamics,\nincluding a diversity of both transient features and robust, long-lived\npatterns that emerge from broad classes of initial data. In our review, we\nprimarily discuss phenomena in one-dimensional crystals, as most research has\nfocused on such scenarios, but we also present some extensions to\ntwo-dimensional settings. Throughout the review, we highlight open problems and\ndiscuss a variety of potential engineering applications that arise from the\nrich dynamic response of granular crystals.\n", "  We present a non-supersymmetric scenario in which the R-parity symmetry $R_P\n= (-1)^{3(B-L)+2s}$ arises as a result of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking,\nleading to a viable Dirac fermion WIMP dark matter candidate. Direct detection\nin nuclear recoil experiments probes dark matter masses around $2-5$ TeV for\n$M_{Z^{\\prime}} \\sim 3-4$ TeV consistent with searches at the LHC, while lepton\nflavor violation rates and flavor changing neutral currents in neutral meson\nsystems lie within reach of upcoming experiments.\n", "  We find set of necessary and sufficient conditions for CP conservation in the\nmost general 2HDM in terms of observable quantities. This set contains two\nrelatively easily testable simple conditions instead of usually discussed three\nmore complex ones.\n", "  Gravity is the weakest fundamental interaction and the only one that has not\nbeen measured at the particle level. Traditional experimental methods, from\nastronomical observations to torsion balances, use macroscopic masses to both\nsource and probe gravitational fields. Matter wave interferometers have used\nneutrons, atoms and molecular clusters as microscopic test particles, but\ninitially probed the field sourced by the entire earth. Later, the\ngravitational field arising from hundreds of kilograms of artificial source\nmasses was measured with atom interferometry. Miniaturizing the source mass and\nmoving it into the vacuum chamber could improve positioning accuracy, allow the\nuse of monocrystalline source masses for improved gravitational measurements,\nand test new physics, such as beyond-standard-model (\"fifth\") forces of nature\nand non-classical effects of gravity. In this work, we detect the gravitational\nforce between freely falling cesium atoms and an in-vacuum, centimeter-sized\nsource mass using atom interferometry with state-of-the-art sensitivity. The\nability to sense gravitational-strength coupling is conjectured to access a\nnatural lower bound for fundamental forces, thereby representing an important\nmilestone in searches for physics beyond the standard model. A local, in-vacuum\nsource mass is particularly sensitive to a wide class of interactions whose\neffects would otherwise be suppressed beyond detectability in regions of high\nmatter density. For example, our measurement strengthens limits on a number of\ncosmologically-motivated scalar field models, such as chameleon and symmetron\nfields, by over two orders of magnitude and paves the way toward novel\nmeasurements of Newton's gravitational constant G and the gravitational\nAharonov-Bohm effect\n", "  We give qualitative arguments for the mesoscopic nature of the\nSachdev-Yee-Kitaev (SYK) model in the holographic regime with $q^2/N\\ll 1$ with\n$N$ Majorana particles coupled by antisymmetric and random interactions of\nrange $q$. Using a stochastic deformation of the SYK model, we show that its\ncharacteristic determinant obeys a viscid Burgers equation with a small\nspectral viscosity in the opposite regime with $q/N=1/2$, in leading order. The\nstochastic evolution of the SYK model can be mapped onto that of random matrix\ntheory, with universal Airy oscillations at the edges. A spectral\nhydrodynamical estimate for the relaxation of the collective modes is made.\n", "  CUORE is a cryogenic experiment searching primarily for neutrinoless double\ndecay in $^{130}$Te. It will begin data-taking operations in 2016. To monitor\nthe cryostat and detector during commissioning and data taking, we have\ndesigned and developed Slow Monitoring systems. In addition to real-time\nsystems using LabVIEW, we have an alarm, analysis, and archiving website that\nuses MongoDB, AngularJS, and Bootstrap software. These modern, state of the art\nsoftware packages make the monitoring system transparent, easily maintainable,\nand accessible on many platforms including mobile devices.\n", "  We present a systematic coarse-graining (CG) strategy for many particle\nmolecular systems based on cluster expansion techniques. We construct a\nhierarchy of coarse-grained Hamiltonians with interaction potentials consisting\nof two, three and higher body interactions. The accuracy of the derived cluster\nexpansion based on interatomic potentials is examined over a range of various\ntemperatures and densities and compared to direct computation of pair potential\nof mean force. The comparison of the coarse-grained simulations is done on the\nbasis of the structural properties, against the detailed all-atom data. We give\nspecific examples for methane and ethane molecules in which the coarse-grained\nvariable is the center of mass of the molecule. We investigate different\ntemperature and density regimes, and we examine differences between the methane\nand ethane systems. Results show that the cluster expansion formalism can be\nused in order to provide accurate effective pair and three-body CG potentials\nat high $T$ and low $\\rho$ regimes. In the liquid regime the three-body\neffective CG potentials give a small improvement, over the typical pair CG\nones; however in order to get significantly better results one needs to\nconsider even higher order terms.\n", "  The experimental efforts characterizing the era of precision neutrino physics\nrevolve around collecting high-statistics neutrino samples and attaining an\nexcellent energy and position resolution. Next generation liquid-based neutrino\ndetectors, such as JUNO, HyperKamiokande, etc, share the use of a large target\nmass, and the need of pushing light collection to the edge for maximal\ncalorimetric information. Achieving high light collection implies considerable\ncosts, especially when considering detector masses of several kt. A traditional\nstrategy to maximize the effective photo-coverage with the minimum number of\nPMTs relies on Light Concentrators (LC), such as Winston Cones. In this paper,\nthe authors introduce a novel concept called Occulting Light Concentrators\n(OLC), whereby a traditional LC gets tailored to a conventional PMT, by taking\ninto account its single-photoelectron collection efficiency profile and thus\nocculting the worst performing portion of the photocathode. Thus, the OLC shape\noptimization takes into account not only the optical interface of the PMT, but\nalso the maximization of the PMT detection performances. The light collection\nuniformity across the detector is another advantage of the OLC system. By\nconsidering the case of JUNO, we will show OLC capabilities in terms of light\ncollection and energy resolution.\n", "  If observed, charged lepton flavour violation is a clear sign of new physics\n- beyond the Standard Model minimally extended to accommodate neutrino\noscillation data. We briefly review several extensions of the Standard Model\nwhich could potentially give rise to observable signals, also emphasising the\nr\\^ole of charged lepton flavour violation in probing such new physics models.\n", "  In this Letter, we report a realistic calculation of the magnetic field\nprofile for the equation of state inside strongly magnetized neutron stars.\nUnlike previous estimates, which are widely used in the literature, we find\nthat magnetic fields increase relatively slowly with increasing baryon chemical\npotential (or baryon density) of magnetized matter. More precisely, the\nincrease is polynomial instead of exponential, as previously assumed. Through\nthe analysis of several different realistic models for the microscopic\ndescription of stellar matter (including hadronic, hybrid and quark models)\ncombined with general relativistic solutions endowed with a poloidal magnetic\nfield obtained by solving Einstein-Maxwell's field equations in a\nself-consistent way, we generate a phenomenological fit for the magnetic field\ndistribution in the stellar polar direction to be used as input in microscopic\ncalculations.\n", "  We present a simple proof that the imaginary part of the world-line path\nintegral which computes the rate of Schwinger pair production of charged\nparticles in a constant electric field, is given exactly by the semiclassical\nWKB limit.\n", "  Adiabatic process has found many important applications in modern physics,\nthe distinct merit of which is that it does not need accurate control over the\ntiming of the process. However, it is a slow process, which limits the\napplication in quantum computation, due to the limited coherent times of\ntypical quantum systems. Here, we propose a scheme to implement quantum state\nconversion in opto-electro-mechanical systems via shortcut to adiabaticity,\nwhere the process can be greatly speeded up while the precise timing control is\nstill not necessary. In our scheme, only by modifying the coupling strength, we\ncan achieve fast quantum state conversion with high fidelity, where the\nadiabatic condition does not need to be met. In addition, the population of the\nunwanted intermediate state can be further suppressed. Therefore, our protocol\npresents an important step towards practical state conversion between optical\nand microwave photons, and thus may find many important applications in hybrid\nquantum information processing.\n", "  Numerical simulation of switching process of high-voltage silicon\nphotodiodes, phototransistors and photothyristors those triggered-on\nhomogeneously over the area by picosecond laser pulses, has been performed for\nthe first time. The analysis of results allowed to obtain \"empirical\"\nrelationship between key parameters of switches (energy of control pulses, a\nradiation absorption coefficient, the area of structures) and parameters those\ncharacterizing the switching process in a circuit with the resistive load. For\nsome of these relationship the approximate analytical formulas which seem to be\nquite adequate to the simulation results has been deduced. It is noted that\ndistinctions between switching processes in structures of the three different\ntypes become apparent only at long duration of voltage pulses at a final stage\nwhen the blocking capability of photodiodes and phototransistors is recovered.\n", "  We study the non-interacting two-impurity Anderson model on a lattice using\nthe Green function equation-of-motion method. A case of particular interest is\nthe RKKY limit that is characterized by a small hybridization between\nimpurities and host electrons and the absence of a direct coupling between the\nimpurities. In contrast to the low-density case, at half band-filling and\nparticle-hole symmetry, the RKKY interaction decays as the inverse square of\nthe impurity distance along the axis of a simple cubic lattice. In the RKKY\nlimit, for the spectral function we generically observe a small splitting of\nthe single-impurity resonance into two peaks. For a vanishing density-density\ncorrelation function of the host electrons, we find only a broadened single\npeak in the local density of states.\n", "  We present new ultra-metal-poor (UMP) stars parameters with [Fe/H]<-4.0 based\non line-by-line non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances using an\nup-to-date iron model atom with a new recipe for non-elastic hydrogen collision\nrates. We study the departures from LTE in their atmospheric parameter and show\nthat they can grow up to ~1.0 dex in [Fe/H], 150K in Teff and 0.5 dex in log g\ntoward the lowest metallicities. Accurate NLTE atmospheric stellar parameters,\nin particular [Fe/H] being signifcantly higher, are the first step to\neventually providing full NLTE abundance patterns that can be compared with\nPopulation III supernova nucleosynthesis yields to derive properties of the\nfirst stars. Overall, this maximizes the potential of these likely\nsecond-generation stars to investigate the early universe and how the chemical\nelements were formed.\n", "  The discovery of a superconducting phase in sulfur hydride under high\npressure with a critical temperature above 200 K has provided a new impetus to\nthe search for even higher $T_c$. Theory predicted and experiment confirmed\nthat the phase involved is H$_3$S with Im-3m crystal structure. The observation\nof a sharp drop in resistance to zero at $T_c$, its downward shift with\nmagnetic field and a Meissner effect confirm superconductivity but the\nmechanism involved remains to be determined. Here, we provide a first optical\nspectroscopy study of this new superconductor. Experimental results for the\noptical reflectivity of H$_3$S, under high pressure of 150 GPa, for several\ntemperatures and over the range 60 to 600 meV of photon energies, are compared\nwith theoretical calculations based on Eliashberg theory using DFT results for\nthe electron-phonon spectral density $\\alpha^2$F($\\Omega$). Two significant\nfeatures stand out: some remarkably strong infrared active phonons at $\\approx$\n160 meV and a band with a depressed reflectance in the superconducting state in\nthe region from 450 meV to 600 meV. In this energy range, as predicted by\ntheory, H$_3$S is found to become a better reflector with increasing\ntemperature. This temperature evolution is traced to superconductivity\noriginating from the electron-phonon interaction. The shape, magnitude, and\nenergy dependence of this band at 150 K agrees with our calculations. This\nprovides strong evidence of a conventional mechanism. However, the unusually\nstrong optical phonon suggests a contribution of electronic degrees of freedom.\n", "  We have designed a single-pixel camera with imaging around corners based on\ncomputational ghost imaging. It can obtain the image of an object when the\ncamera cannot look at the object directly. Our imaging system explores the fact\nthat a bucket detector in a ghost imaging setup has no spatial resolution\ncapability. A series of experiments have been designed to confirm our\npredictions. This camera has potential applications for imaging around corner\nor other similar environments where the object cannot be observed directly.\n", "  Constructing efficient and accurate parameterizations of sub-grid scale\nprocesses is a central area of interest in the numerical modelling of\ngeophysical fluids. Using a modified version of the two-level Lorenz '96 model,\nwe present here a proof of concept of a scale-adaptive parameterization\nconstructed using statistical mechanical arguments. By a suitable use of the\nRuelle response theory and of the Mori-Zwanzig projection method, it is\npossible to derive explicitly a parameterization for the fast variables that\ntranslates into deterministic, stochastic and non-markovian contributions to\nthe equations of motion of the variables of interest. We show that our approach\nis computationally parsimonious, has great flexibility, as it is explicitly\nscale-adaptive, and we prove that it is competitive compared to empirical\nad-hoc approaches. While the parameterization proposed here is universal and\ncan be easily analytically adapted to changes in the parameters' values by a\nsimple rescaling procedure, the parameterization constructed with the ad-hoc\napproach needs to be recomputed each time the parameters of the systems are\nchanged. The price of the higher flexibility of the method proposed here is\nhaving a lower accuracy in each individual case.\n", "  The MINERvA collaboration is currently engaged in a broad program of\nneutrino-nucleus interaction measurements. Several recent measurements of\ninterest to the accelerator-based oscillation community are presented. These\ninclude measurements of quasi-elastic scattering, diffractive pion production,\nkaon production and comparisons of interaction cross sections across nuclei. A\nnew measurement of the NuMI neutrino beam flux that incorporates both external\nhadro-production data and MINERvA detector data is also presented.\n", "  When neutrino masses arise from the exchange of neutral heavy leptons, as in\nmost seesaw schemes, the effective lepton mixing matrix $N$ describing neutrino\npropagation is non-unitary, hence neutrinos are not exactly orthonormal. New CP\nviolation phases appear in $N$ that could be confused with the standard phase\n$\\delta_{\\text{CP}}$ characterizing the three neutrino paradigm. We study the\npotential of the long-baseline neutrino experiment DUNE in probing CP violation\ninduced by the standard CP phase in the presence of non-unitarity. In order to\naccomplish this we develop our previous formalism, so as to take into account\nthe neutrino interactions with the medium, important in long baseline\nexperiments such as DUNE. We find that the expected CP sensitivity of DUNE is\nsomewhat degraded with respect to that characterizing the standard unitary\ncase. However the effect is weaker than might have been expected thanks mainly\nto the wide neutrino beam. We also investigate the sensitivity of DUNE to the\nparameters characterizing non-unitarity. In this case we find that there is no\nimprovement expected with respect to the current situation, unless the near\ndetector setup is revamped.\n", "  We investigate the Lyapunov spectrum of separated flows and their dependence\non the numerical discretization. The chaotic flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil\nat low Reynolds number and large angle of attack is considered to that end, and\nt-, h- and p-refinement studies are performed to examine each effect\nseparately. Numerical results show that the time discretization has a small\nimpact on the dynamics of the system, whereas the spatial discretization can\ndramatically change them. In particular, the asymptotic Lyapunov spectrum for\ntime refinement is achieved for CFL numbers as large as\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^1-10^2)$, whereas the system continues to become more and more\nchaotic even for meshes that are much finer than the best practice for this\ntype of flows.\n", "  In the present article the snake instability mechanism for dark solitons in\nsuperfluid Fermi gases is studied in the context of a recently developed\neffective field theory [Eur. Phys. J. B 88, 122 (2015)]. This theoretical\ntreatment has proven to be suitable to study stable dark solitons in quasi-1D\nsetups across the BEC-BCS crossover. In this manuscript the nodal plane of the\nstable soliton solution is perturbed by adding a transverse modulation. The\nnumerical solution of the system of coupled nonlinear differential equations\ndescribing the amplitude of the perturbation leads to the instability spectra\nwhich are calculated for a wide range of interaction regimes and compared to\nother theoretical predictions. The maximum transverse size that the atomic\ncloud can have in order to preserve the stability is estimated, and the effects\nof spin-imbalance on this critical length are examined, revealing a\nstabilization of the soliton with increasing imbalance.\n", "  We investigate the viscous fingering instability that arises when air is\ninjected from the end of an oil-filled, compliant channel. We show that induced\naxial and transverse depth gradients foster novel pattern formation. Moreover,\nthe steady propagation of the interface allows us to elucidate the nonlinear\nsaturation of a fingering pattern first observed in a time-evolving system\n(Pihler-Puzovic et al. PRL 108, 074502, 2012): the wavelength is set by the\nviscous fingering mechanism, but the amplitude is inversely proportional to the\ntangent of the compliant wall's inclination angle.\n", "  Nonreciprocal electromagnetic devices play an important role in modern\noptical and microwave technologies. Conventional methods for realizing such\nsystems are incompatible with integrated circuits. With recent advances in\nintegrated photonics, the need for efficient on-chip magnetless nonreciprocal\ndevices is more urgent than ever. This paper leverages space-time engineered\nasymmetric photonic bandgaps to generate optical isolation. It is shown that a\nproperly designed space-time modulated slab is highly reflective/transparent\nfor opposite directions of propagation. The proposed method requires a low\nmodulation frequency, is magnetless and can achieve very high isolation levels.\nExperimental proof of concept at microwave frequencies is provided.\n", "  The decays $\\tau \\to \\nu_{\\tau} (K^{*}(892), K^{*}(1410), K_1(1270),\nK_1(1650), a_1(1260), a_1(1640))$ in the extended NJL model are calculated. The\nresults obtained for the decays are $\\tau \\to \\nu_{\\tau} (K^{*}(892),\nK^{*}(1410), K_1(1270))$ in a satisfactory agreement with the experimental\ndata. There are no experimental data for other types of decay. Therefore, the\nobtained results should be considered as predictions for further experiments.\n", "  Starting from the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations, we derive a time-averaged\n`hydrostatic wave equation' that describes the propagation of inertia-gravity\ninternal waves through quasi-geostrophic flow. The derivation uses a\nmultiple-time-scale asymptotic method to isolate wave field evolution over\nintervals much longer than a wave period, assumes that the wave field has a\nwell-defined and non-inertial frequency such as that of the mid-latitude\nsemi-diurnal lunar tide, neglects nonlinear wave-wave interactions and makes no\nrestriction on either the background density stratification or the relative\nspatial scales between the wave field and quasi-geostrophic flow. As a result\nthe hydrostatic wave equation is a reduced model applicable to the propagation\nof large scale internal tides through the inhomogeneous and moving ocean. A\nnumerical comparison with the linearized and hydrostatic Boussinesq equations\ndemonstrates the validity of the hydrostatic wave equation and illustrates the\nmanners of model failure when the quasi-geostrophic flow is too strong and the\nwave frequency is too close to inertial.\n", "  Deterministic all-optical control of magnetization without an applied\nmagnetic field has been reported for different materials such as ferrimagnetic\nand ferromagnetic thin films and granular recording media. These findings have\nchallenged the understanding of all-optical helicity-dependent switching of\nmagnetization and opened many potential applications for future magnetic\ninformation, memory and storage technologies. Here we demonstrate optical\ncontrol of an antiferromagnetic layer through the exchange bias interaction\nusing the helicity of a femtosecond pulsed laser on IrMn/[Co/Pt]xN\nantiferromagnetic/ ferromagnetic heterostructures. We show controlled switching\nof the sign of the exchange bias field without any applied field, only by\nchanging the helicity of the light, and quantify the influence of the laser\nfluence and the number of light pulses on the exchange bias control. We also\npresent the combined effect of laser pulses and applied magnetic field. This\nstudy opens applications in spintronic devices where the exchange bias\nphenomenon is routinely used to fix the magnetization orientation of a magnetic\nlayer in one direction.\n", "  Anisotropic collective patterns occur frequently in the morphogenesis of 2D\nbiofilms. These patterns are often attributed to growth regulation mechanisms\nand differentiation based on gradients of diffusing nutrients and signalling\nmolecules. Here, we employ a model of bacterial growth dynamics to show that\neven in the absence of growth regulation or differentiation, confinement by an\nenclosing medium such as agar can itself lead to stable pattern formation over\ntime scales that are employed in experiments. The underlying mechanism relies\non path formation through physical deformation of the enclosing environment.\n", "  In the standard picture of structure formation, the first massive galaxies\nare expected to form at the highest peaks of the density field, which\nconstitute the cores of massive proto-clusters. Luminous quasars (QSOs) at z~4\nare the most strongly clustered population known, and should thus reside in\nmassive dark matter halos surrounded by large overdensities of galaxies,\nimplying a strong QSO-galaxy cross-correlation function. We observed six z~4\nQSO fields with VLT/FORS exploiting a novel set of narrow band filters custom\ndesigned to select Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in a thin redshift slice of\nDelta_z~0.3, mitigating the projection effects that have limited the\nsensitivity of previous searches for galaxies around z>~4 QSOs. We find that\nLBGs are strongly clustered around QSOs, and present the first measurement of\nthe QSO-LBG cross-correlation function at z~4, on scales of 0.1<~R<~9 Mpc/h\n(comoving). Assuming a power law form for the cross-correlation function\nxi=(r/r0_QG)^gamma, we measure r0_QG=8.83^{+1.39}_{-1.51} Mpc/h for a fixed\nslope of gamma=2.0. This result is in agreement with the expected\ncross-correlation length deduced from measurements of the QSO and LBG\nauto-correlation function, and assuming a linear bias model. We also measure a\nstrong auto-correlation of LBGs in our QSO fields finding\nr0_GG=21.59^{+1.72}_{-1.69} Mpc/h for a fixed slope of gamma=1.5, which is ~4\ntimes larger than the LBG auto-correlation length in random fields, providing\nfurther evidence that QSOs reside in overdensities of LBGs. Our results\nqualitatively support a picture where luminous QSOs inhabit exceptionally\nmassive (M_halo>10^12 M_sun) dark matter halos at z~4.\n", "  We show that the deviation from exponential behavior of the diffraction cone\nobserved near t=-0.1 GeV^2 both at ISR and the LHC (so-called break) follows\nfrom a two-pion loop in the t channel, imposed by unitarity. By using a simple\nRegge-pole model, we extrapolate the \"break\" from the ISR energy region to that\nof the LHC.\n", "  We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical\nsimulations of the geodynamo. We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven\nsimulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case\nreaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number\nRm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is\nfeasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis\nhighlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo\ntheory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it\nalso unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this\nstrong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one\norder of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of\nmagnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast\nexists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the\ncylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In\nthe interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a\nvigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the\nformation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell.\nFurthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light\nmaterial within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there.\nTorsional Alfv{\\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the\ntangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent\ncylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic\nenergy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the\nlow-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly\nlarge-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations,\nwithout any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further\nreveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance\nbetween Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align,\nminimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance\nbetween magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live\nat an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance --\ninvolving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3})\nquasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic\nintensity.\n", "  KM3NeT, currently under construction in the abysses of the Mediterranean Sea,\nis a distributed research infrastructure that will host a km3-scale neutrino\ntelescope (ARCA) for high-energy neutrino astronomy, and a megaton scale\ndetector (ORCA) for neutrino oscillation studies of atmospheric neutrinos. ORCA\nis optimised for a measurement of the mass hierarchy, providing a sensitivity\nof 3{\\sigma} after 3-4 years. It will also measure the atmospheric mixing\nparameters $\\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\\theta_{23}$ with a precision comparable to\nthe NOvA and T2K experiments using both the muon neutrino disappearance and tau\nneutrino appearance channels. It will provide a measurement of the tau neutrino\nappearance rate with better than 10% precision, a crucial ingredient for tests\nof unitarity. It will probe the octant of the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ via\nmatter resonance effects on neutrinos and antineutrinos crossing the core and\nmantle, which are largely independent on the CP phase. The observation of\nneutrino oscillations over a wide range of baselines and energies will provide\nbroad sensitivity to new physics such as non-standard neutrino interactions\n(NSI) and sterile neutrinos.\n", "  A ribbon is a surface swept out by a line segment turning as it moves along a\ncentral curve. For narrow magnetic ribbons, for which the length of the line\nsegment is much less than the length of the curve, the anisotropy induced by\nthe magnetostatic interaction is biaxial, with hard axis normal to the ribbon\nand easy axis along the central curve. The micromagnetic energy of a narrow\nribbon reduces to that of a one-dimensional ferromagnetic wire, but with\ncurvature, torsion and local anisotropy modified by the rate of turning. These\ngeneral results are applied to two examples, namely a helicoid ribbon, for\nwhich the central curve is a straight line, and a M\\\"obius ribbon, for which\nthe central curve is a circle about which the line segment executes a\n$180^\\circ$ twist. In both examples, for large positive tangential anisotropy,\nthe ground state magnetization lies tangent to the central curve. As the\ntangential anisotropy is decreased, the ground state magnetization undergoes a\ntransition, acquiring an in-surface component perpendicular to the central\ncurve. For the helicoid ribbon, the transition occurs at vanishing anisotropy,\nbelow which the ground state is uniformly perpendicular to the central curve.\nThe transition for the M\\\"obius ribbon is more subtle; it occurs at a positive\ncritical value of the anisotropy, below which the ground state is nonuniform.\nFor the helicoid ribbon, the dispersion law for spin wave excitations about the\ntangential state is found to exhibit an asymmetry determined by the geometric\nand magnetic chiralities.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of static and dynamic responses of\nCoulomb interacting particles in two-dimensional traps across the thermal\ncrossover from an amorphous solid- to liquid-like behaviors. While static\ncorrelations, that investigate the translational and bond orientational order\nin the confinements, show the footprints of hexatic-like phase at low\ntemperature, dynamics of the particles slow down considerably in this state --\nreminiscent of a supercooled liquid. Using density correlations, we probe\nintriguing signatures of long-lived inhomogeneities due to the interplay of the\nirregularity in the confinement and long-range Coulomb interactions. The\nrelaxation at multiple time scales show stretched-exponential decay of spatial\ncorrelations in irregular traps. Temperature dependence of characteristic time\nscales, depicting the structural relaxation of the system, show striking\nsimilarities with those observed for the glassy systems indicating that, some\nof the key signatures of supercooled liquids emerge in confinements with lower\nspatial symmetries.\n", "  We investigate the impact of different redshift distributions of random\nsamples on the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements of\n$D_V(z)r_\\mathrm{d}^\\mathrm{fid}/r_\\mathrm{d}$ from the two-point correlation\nfunctions (2PCF) of galaxies in the Data Release 12 (DR12) of the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Big surveys, such as BOSS, usually\nassign redshifts to the random samples by randomly drawing values from the\nmeasured redshift distributions of the data, which would necessarily introduce\nfiducial signals of fluctuations into the random samples, weakening the signals\nof BAO, if the cosmic variance cannot be ignored. We propose a smooth function\nof redshift distribution that fits the data well to populate the random galaxy\nsamples. The resulting cosmological parameters match the input parameters of\nthe mock catalogue very well. The significance of BAO signals has been improved\nby $0.33\\sigma$ for a low-redshift (LOWZ) sample and by $0.03\\sigma$ for a\nconstant-stellar-mass (CMASS) sample, though the absolute values do not change\nsignificantly. Given the precision of the measurements of current cosmological\nparameters, it would be appreciated for the future improvements on the\nmeasurements of galaxy clustering.\n", "  A high pressure xenon gas time projection chamber with electroluminescent\namplification (EL HPGXe TPC) searching for the neutrinoless double beta\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay offers: excellent energy resolution ($0.5-0.7\\%$ FWHM\nat the $Q_{\\beta\\beta}$), by amplifying the ionization signal with\nelectroluminescent light, and tracking capabilities, as demonstrated by the\nNEXT collaboration using two kg-scale prototypes. The NEXT collaboration is\nbuilding an EL HPGXe TPC capable of holding 100 kg (NEXT-100) of xenon\nisotopically enriched in ${{}^{136}\\rm Xe}$. The installation and commissioning\nof the NEXT-100 detector at the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC) is\nplanned for 2018. The current estimated background level for the NEXT-100\ndetector is of $4\\times10^{-4}$ counts/keV-kg-yr or less in the energy region\nof interest. Assuming an energy resolution of 0.75$\\%$ FWHM at the\n$Q_{\\beta\\beta}$ and a $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ signal efficiency of about 28$\\%$, this\ngives an expected sensitivity (at 90$\\%$ CL) to the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half\nlife of $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>6.0\\times10^{25}$ yr for an exposure of 275 kg yr. A\nfirst phase of the NEXT experiment, called NEW, is currently being commissioned\nat the LSC. The NEW detector is a scale 1:2 in size (1:10 in mass) of the\nNEXT-100 detector using the same materials and photosensors and will be used to\nperform a characterization of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ backgrounds and a\nmeasurement of the standard double beta decay with neutrinos\n(${2\\nu\\beta\\beta}$). An 8 sigma significance for the ${2\\nu\\beta\\beta}$ signal\nin the NEW detector has been estimated for a 100-day run.\n", "  Deep cooling of electron and nuclear spins is equivalent to achieving\npolarization degrees close to 100% and is a key requirement in solid state\nquantum information technologies. While polarization of individual nuclear\nspins in diamond and SiC reaches 99% and beyond, it has been limited to 60-65%\nfor the nuclei in quantum dots. Theoretical models have attributed this limit\nto formation of coherent \"dark\" nuclear spin states but experimental\nverification is lacking, especially due to the poor accuracy of polarization\ndegree measurements. Here we measure the nuclear polarization in GaAs/AlGaAs\nquantum dots with high accuracy using a new approach enabled by manipulation of\nthe nuclear spin states with radiofrequency pulses. Polarizations up to 80% are\nobserved - the highest reported so far for optical cooling in quantum dots.\nThis value is still not limited by nuclear coherence effects. Instead we find\nthat optically cooled nuclei are well described within a classical spin\ntemperature framework. Our findings unlock a route for further progress towards\nquantum dot electron spin qubits where deep cooling of the mesoscopic nuclear\nspin ensemble is used to achieve long qubit coherence. Moreover, GaAs hyperfine\nmaterial constants are measured here experimentally for the first time.\n", "  We show that the magnetoconductance oscillations of laterally-confined 2D NS\njunctions are completely suppressed when the superconductor side enters a\ntopological phase. This suppression can be attributed to the modification of\nthe vortex structure of local currents at the junction caused by the\ntopological transition of the superconductor. The two regimes (with and without\noscillations) could be seen in a semiconductor 2D junction with a cleaved-edge\ngeometry, one of the junction arms having proximitized superconductivity. We\npredict similar oscillations and suppression as a function of the Rashba\ncoupling. The oscillation suppression is robust against differences in chemical\npotential and phases of lateral superconductors.\n", "  Energy efficiency of optoelectronic switches based on high-voltage silicon\nphotodiodes, phototransistors or photothyristors and triggered-on by picosecond\nlaser pulses has been studied for the first time. For given values of resistive\nload, amplitude and duration $t_R$ of voltage pulses it is shown that there\nexist optimal sets of values for the device area, energy and absorption\ncoefficient for triggering illumination, which provide the maximal general\nefficiency of the switch about 0.92. All three types of switches have almost\nidentical efficiencies at short $t_R$, and in case of long $t_R$\nphotothyristors possess a noticeable advantage among them.\n", "  Despite about forty years of investigations, the nature of the melting\ntransition in two dimensions is not completely clear. In the framework of the\nmost popular Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (BKTHNY)\ntheory, 2D systems melt through two continuous Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(BKT) transitions with intermediate hexatic phase. The conventional first-order\ntransition is also possible. On the other hand, recently on the basis of\ncomputer simulations the new melting scenario was proposed with continuous BKT\ntype solid-hexatic transition and first order hexatic-liquid transition.\nHowever, in the simulations the hexatic phase is extremely narrow that makes\nits study difficult. In the present paper, we propose to apply the random\npinning to investigate the hexatic phase in more detail. The results of\nmolecular dynamics simulations of two dimensional system having core-softened\npotentials with narrow repulsive step which is similar to the soft disk system\nare outlined. The system has a small fraction of pinned particles giving\nquenched disorder. Random pinning widens the hexatic phase without changing the\nmelting scenario and gives the possibility to study the behavior of the\ndiffusivity and order parameters in the vicinity of the melting transition and\ninside the hexatic phase.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the connection between convergence in distribution\nand Mallows distance in the context of positively associated random variables.\nOur results extend some known invariance principles for sequences with FKG\nproperty. Applications for processes with Gibbssian dependence structures are\nincluded.\n", "  The nonmesonic weak decay of $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei is studied within a\nmicroscopic diagrammatic approach which is extended to include the\nthree--nucleon induced mechanism. We adopt a nuclear matter formalism which,\nthrough the local density approximation, allows us to model finite hypernuclei,\na one--meson--exchange weak transition potential and a Bonn nucleon--nucleon\nstrong potential. One--, two-- and three--nucleon induced weak decay rates are\npredicted for $^{12}_\\Lambda$C by including ground state correlations up to\nsecond order in the nucleon--nucleon potential and the recoil of the residual\nnucleus. Three--nucleon stimulated decays, $\\Lambda NNN\\to nNNN$ ($N=n$ or\n$p$), are considered here for the first time. The obtained decay rates compare\nwell with the latest KEK and FINUDA data. The three--nucleon induced rate turns\nout to be dominated by $nnp$-- and $npp$--induced decays, it amounts to $\\sim$\n7\\% of the total nonmesonic rate and it is $\\sim 1/2$ of the neutron--induced\ndecay rate. The reduction effect of the nuclear recoil is particularly relevant\nfor the three--nucleon induced rates ($\\sim$ 15\\%), less important for the\ntwo--nucleon induced rates ($\\sim$ 4\\%) and negligible for the one--nucleon\ninduced rates. Given the non--negligible size of the three--nucleon induced\ncontribution and consequently its importance in the precise determination of\nthe complete set of decay rates, new measurements and/or experimental analysis\nare encouraged.\n", "  We have studied the temporal evolution of a quantum system subjected to\nstrong dissipation at ultra-low temperatures where the system-bath interaction\nrepresents the leading energy scale. In this regime, theory predicts the time\nevolution of the system to follow a generalization of the classical\nSmoluchowski description, the quantum Smoluchowski equation, thus, exhibiting\nquantum Brownian motion characteristics. For this purpose, we have investigated\nthe phase dynamics of a superconducting tunnel junction in the presence of high\ndamping. We performed current-biased measurements on the small-capacitance\nJosephson junction of a scanning tunneling microscope placed in a low impedance\nenvironment at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We can describe our experimental\nfindings by a quantum diffusion model with high accuracy in agreement with\ntheoretical predications based on the quantum Smoluchowski equation. In this\nway we experimentally demonstrate that quantum systems subjected to strong\ndissipation follow quasi-classical dynamics with significant quantum effects as\nthe leading corrections.\n", "  We review recent results on the phase structure of QCD and bulk QCD\nthermodynamics. In particular we discuss how universal critical scaling related\nto spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry manifests itself in recent\nlattice QCD simulations and how the knowledge on non-universal scaling\nparameter can be utilized in the exploration of the QCD phase diagram. We also\nshow how various (generalized) susceptibilities can be employed to characterize\nproperties of QCD matter at low and hight temperatures, related to deconfining\naspects of the QCD transition. Finally, we address the input these lattice QCD\ncalculation can provide for our under standing of the matter created in heavy\nion collisions and in particular on the freeze-out conditions met in the\nhydrodynamic evolution of this matter.\n", "  In this note, we expand on some technical issues raised in \\cite{PPV} by the\nauthors, as well as providing a friendly introduction to and summary of our\nprevious work. We construct a set of heterotic string compactifications to 0+1\ndimensions intimately related to the Monstrous moonshine module of Frenkel,\nLepowsky, and Meurman (and orbifolds thereof). Using this model, we review our\nphysical interpretation of the genus zero property of Monstrous moonshine.\nFurthermore, we show that the space of (second-quantized) BPS-states forms a\nmodule over the Monstrous Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{m}_g$---some of the first and\nmost prominent examples of Generalized Kac-Moody algebras---constructed by\nBorcherds and Carnahan. In particular, we clarify the structure of the module\npresent in the second-quantized string theory. We also sketch a proof of our\nmethods in the language of vertex operator algebras, for the interested\nmathematician.\n", "  Magnetic dipolar modes (MDMs) in a quasi 2D ferrite disk are microwave energy\neigenstate oscillations with topologically distinct structures of rotating\nfields and unidirectional power flow circulations. At the first glance, this\nmight seem to violate the law of conservation of an angular momentum, since the\nmicrowave structure with an embedded ferrite sample is mechanically fixed.\nHowever, an angular momentum is seen to be conserved if topological properties\nof electromagnetic fields in the entire microwave structure are taken into\naccount. In this paper we show that due to the topological action of the\nazimuthally unidirectional transport of energy in a MDM resonance ferrite\nsample there exists the opposite topological reaction on a metal screen placed\nnear this sample. We call this effect topological Lenz effect. The topological\nLenz law is applied to opposite topological charges, one in a ferrite sample\nand another on a metal screen. The MDM originated near fields, the\nmagnetoelectric (ME) fields, induce helical surface electric currents and\neffective charges on a metal. The fields formed by these currents and charges\nwill oppose their cause.\n", "  An efficient systematic procedure is provided for symbolic computation of Lie\ngroups of equivalence transformations and generalized equivalence\ntransformations of systems of differential equations that contain arbitrary\nelements (arbitrary functions and/or arbitrary constant parameters), using the\nsoftware package GeM for Maple. Application of equivalence transformations to\nthe reduction of the number of arbitrary elements in a given system of\nequations is discussed, and several examples are considered. First\ncomputational example of a generalized equivalence transformation where the\ntransformation of the dependent variable involves the arbitrary constitutive\nfunction is presented.\n  As a detailed physical example, a three-parameter family of nonlinear wave\nequations describing finite anti-plane shear displacements of an incompressible\nhyperelasic fiber-reinforced medium is considered. Equivalence transformations\nare computed and employed to radically simplify the model for an arbitrary\nfiber direction, invertibly reducing the model to a simple form that\ncorresponds to a special fiber direction, and involves no arbitrary elements.\n  The presented computation algorithm is applicable to wide classes of systems\nof differential equations containing arbitrary elements.\n", "  The ligand-protected Au13 clusters have been synthesized by using\nmeso-2,3-imercaptosuccinic acid as the reducing and stabilizing agent.\nTransmission electron microscopic analysis shows a size distribution of 0.6nm.\nOptical spectrum shows an absorbance peak at 390 nm. The electrical transport\nmeasurement devices are fabricated using the electro-migration method. Coulomb\nblockade is observed at the temperature of 1.6 K,revealing the formation of the\ntunneling junction. The Coulomb oscillation on-off ratio is nearly 5. Three\npeaks are extracted in the dI-dV data and attributed to the energy levels of\nAu13 clusters, gapped by about 60 meV. First principle calculations are carried\nout to interpret the energy diagram.\n", "  Ever since the discovery of black hole evaporation, the region of origin of\nthe radiated quanta has been a topic of debate. Recently it was argued by\nGiddings that the Hawking quanta originate from a region well outside the black\nhole horizon by calculating the effective radius of a radiating body via the\nStefan--Boltzmann law. In this paper we try to further explore this issue and\nend up corroborating this claim, using both a heuristic argument and a detailed\nstudy of the stress energy tensor. We show that the Hawking quanta originate\nfrom what might be called a quantum atmosphere around the black hole with\nenergy density and fluxes of particles peaked at about $4M$, running contrary\nto the popular belief that these originate from the ultra high energy\nexcitations very close to the horizon. This long distance origin of Hawking\nradiation could have a profound impact on our understanding of the information\nand transplanckian problems.\n", "  We analyze a complete spectroscopic sample of galaxies ($\\sim$600,000 ) drawn\nfrom Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, DR7) to look for evidence of galactic\nwinds in the local Universe. We focus on the shape of the [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\nemission line as a tracer of ionizing gas outflows. We stack our spectra in a\nfine grid of star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass to analyze the\ndependence of winds on the position of galaxies in the SFR versus mass diagram.\nWe do not find any significant evidence of broad and shifted\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emission line which we interpret as no evidence of\noutflowing ionized gas in the global population. We have also classified these\ngalaxies as star-forming or AGN dominated according to their position in the\nstandard BPT diagram. We show how the average [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 profile\nchanges as function of nature of the dominant ionizing source. We find that in\nthe star-forming dominated source the oxygen line is symmetric and governed by\nthe gravitational potential well. The AGN or composite\nAGN$\\setminus$star-formation activity objects, in contrast, display a prominent\nand asymmetric profile that can be well described by a broad gaussian component\nthat is blue-shifted from a narrow symmetric core. In particular, we find that\nthe blue wings of the average [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 profiles are increasingly\nprominent in the LINERs and Seyfert galaxies. We conclude that, in the\nlow-redshift Universe, \"pure\" star-formation activity does not seem capable of\ndriving ionized-gas outflows, while, the presence of optically selected AGN\nseems to play a primary role to drive such winds. We discuss the implications\nof these results for the role of the quenching mechanism in the present day\nUniverse.\n", "  We discuss and compare the efficiency of various methods, combinations of\npoint-to-all propagators, stochastic timeslice-to-all propagators, the one-end\ntrick and sequential propagators, to compute two-point correlation functions of\ntwo-quark and four-quark interpolating operators of different structure\nincluding quark-antiquark type, mesonic molecule type, diquark-antidiquark type\nand two-meson type. Although we illustrate our methods in the context of the\n$a_0(980)$, they can be applied for other multi-quark systems, where similar\ndiagrams appear. Thus our results could provide helpful guidelines on the\nchoice of methods for correlation function computation for future lattice QCD\nstudies of meson-meson scattering and possibly existing tetraquark states.\n", "  The temporal fluctuations in global mean surface temperature is an example of\na geophysical quantity which can be described using the notions of long-range\npersistence and scale invariance/scaling, but this description has suffered\nfrom lack of a generally accepted physical explanation. Processes with these\nstatistical signatures can arise from non-linear effects, for instance through\ncascade-like energy transfer in turbulent fluids, but they can also be produced\nby linear models with scale-invariant impulse-response functions. This paper\ndemonstrates that on time scales from months to centuries, the scale-invariant\nimpulse-response function of global surface temperature can be explained from\nsimple linear multi-box energy balance models. This explanation describes both\nthe scale invariance of the internal variability and the lack of a\ncharacteristic time scale of the response to external forcings. With parameters\nestimated from observational data, the climate response is approximately\nscaling in these models, even if the response function is not chosen to be\nscaling a priori. It is also demonstrated that the differences in scaling\nexponents for temperatures over land and for sea-surface temperatures can be\nreproduced by a version of the multi-box energy balance model with two distinct\nsurface boxes.\n", "  The lepton identification is essential for the physics programs at\nhigh-energy frontier, especially for the precise measurement of the Higgs\nboson. For this purpose, a Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis (TMVA) based\nlepton identification (LICH) has been developed for detectors using high\ngranularity calorimeters. Using the conceptual detector geometry for the\nCircular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and single charged particle samples\nwith energy larger than 2 GeV, LICH identifies electrons/muons with\nefficiencies higher than 99.5% and controls the mis-identification rate of\nhadron to muons/electrons to better than 1%/0.5%. Reducing the calorimeter\ngranularity by 1-2 orders of magnitude, the lepton identification performance\nis stable for particles with E > 2 GeV. Applied to fully simulated\neeH/$\\mu\\mu$H events, the lepton identification performance is consistent with\nthe single particle case: the efficiency of identifying all the high energy\nleptons in an event, is 95.5-98.5%.\n", "  The M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen gate is a state-of-the-art entangling gate in the\nion trap quantum computing where the gate fidelity can exceed 99\\%. Here we\npropose an analogous implementation in the setting of cavity QED. The cavity\nphoton mode acts as the bosonic degree of freedom in the gate in contrast of\nthat played by a phonon mode in ion traps. This is made possible by utilising\ncavity assisted Raman transitions interconnecting the logical qubit states\nembedded in a four-level energy structure, making the \"anti-Jaynes-Cummings\"\n(AJC) term available under the rotating-wave approximation. We identify\npractical sources of infidelity and discuss their effects on the gate\nperformance. Our proposal not only demonstrates an alternative entangling gate\nscheme but also sheds new light on the relationship between ion traps and\ncavity QED, in the sense that many techniques developed in the former are\ntransferable to the latter through our framework.\n", "  We analyze the interplay between leptogenesis and residual symmetry in the\nframework of two right-handed neutrino model. Working in the flavor basis, we\nshow that all the leptogenesis CP asymmetries are vanishing for the case of two\nresidual CP transformations or a cyclic residual flavor symmetry in the\nneutrino sector. If a single remnant CP transformation is preserved in the\nneutrino sector, the lepton mixing matrix is determined up to a real orthogonal\nmatrix multiplied from the right side. The $R$-matrix is found to depend on\nonly one real parameter, it can take three viable forms, and each entry is\neither real or purely imaginary. The baryon asymmetry is generated entirely by\nthe CP violating phases in the mixing matrix in this scenario. We perform a\ncomprehensive study for the $\\Delta(6n^2)$ flavor group and CP symmetry which\nare broken to a single remnant CP transformation in the neutrino sector and an\nabelian subgroup in the charged lepton sector. The results for lepton flavor\nmixing and leptogenesis are presented.\n", "  Deviations from the standard model prediction have been observed not only in\n$b \\to c$ charged current interactions but also in $b \\to s$ flavor changing\nneutral current interactions. In particular, the deviation observed in the\nmeasured ratio of branching fractions $R_D = \\mathcal B(B \\to\nD\\tau\\nu)/\\mathcal B(B \\to D\\,l\\,\\nu)$ and $R_{D^{\\ast}} =\\mathcal B(B \\to\nD^{\\ast}\\tau\\nu)/\\mathcal B(B \\to D^{\\ast}\\,l\\,\\nu)$, where $l = (e,\\,\\mu)$, is\nmore pronounced and the combined excess currently stands at $3.9\\sigma$ level.\nIf it persists and confirmed by future experiments, it would be a definite hint\nof new physics. In this context, we consider $B_c \\to \\eta_c\\,l\\,\\nu$ and $B_c\n\\to J/\\Psi\\,l\\,\\nu$ decays mediated via $b \\to c\\,l\\,\\nu$ charged current\ninteractions and employ the most general effective Lagrangian in the presence\nof new physics to give prediction on various observables such as ratio of\nbranching ratio, tau polarization fraction, and forward backward asymmetry for\nthese decay modes.\n", "  We extend the classical Wick rotation to D-modules and higher codimensional\nsubmanifolds.\n", "  Superstring theories at low energy limit are described by the corresponding\nsupergravities, and their non-perturbative D-brane/O-plane excitations are\ndescribed by DBI and WZ actions. Higher derivative corrections to these\neffective actions are important for understanding the stringy behavior of the\nfundamental objects. They may be extracted from the contact terms of the\ncorresponding S-matrix elements. On the other hand, the superstring theories\nenjoy the T- and S-dualities which appear in the S-matrix elements as duality\nWard identities. These Ward identities might be used as generating functions\nfor constructing the S-matrix elements. The dualities may also be used directly\nto construct the effective actions. In this article, we review the duality Ward\nidentities which can be used to generate S-matrix elements, and review the\ndualities which may be used directly to construct the higher derivative\ncorrections to the effective actions.\n", "  The demand for single photon sources at $\\lambda~=~1.54~\\mu$m, which follows\nfrom the consistent development of quantum networks based on commercial optical\nfibers, makes Er:O$_x$ centers in Si still a viable resource thanks to the\noptical transition of $Er^{3+}~:~^4I_{13/2}~\\rightarrow~^4I_{15/2}$. Yet, to\ndate, the implementation of such system remains hindered by its extremely low\nemission rate. In this Letter, we explore the room-temperature\nphotoluminescence (PL) at the telecomm wavelength of very low implantation\ndoses of $Er:O_x$ in $Si$. The emitted photons, excited by a $\\lambda~=~792~nm$\nlaser in both large areas and confined dots of diameter down to $5~\\mu$m, are\ncollected by an inverted confocal microscope. The lower-bound number of\ndetectable emission centers within our diffraction-limited illumination spot is\nestimated to be down to about 10$^4$, corresponding to an emission rate per\nindividual ion of about $4~\\times~10^{3}$ photons/s.\n", "  We present gravitational lens models of the multiply imaged quasar DES\nJ0408-5354, recently discovered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint, with\nthe aim of interpreting its remarkable quad-like configuration. We first model\nthe DES single-epoch $grizY$ images as a superposition of a lens galaxy and\nfour point-like objects, obtaining spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and\nrelative positions for the objects. Three of the point sources (A,B,D) have\nSEDs compatible with the discovery quasar spectra, while the faintest\npoint-like image (G2/C) shows significant reddening and a `grey' dimming of\n$\\approx0.8$mag. In order to understand the lens configuration, we fit\ndifferent models to the relative positions of A,B,D. Models with just a single\ndeflector predict a fourth image at the location of G2/C but considerably\nbrighter and bluer. The addition of a small satellite galaxy ($R_{\\rm\nE}\\approx0.2$\") in the lens plane near the position of G2/C suppresses the flux\nof the fourth image and can explain both the reddening and grey dimming. All\nmodels predict a main deflector with Einstein radius between $1.7\"$ and $2.0\",$\nvelocity dispersion $267-280$km/s and enclosed mass $\\approx\n6\\times10^{11}M_{\\odot},$ even though higher resolution imaging data are needed\nto break residual degeneracies in model parameters. The longest time-delay\n(B-A) is estimated as $\\approx 85$ (resp. $\\approx125$) days by models with\n(resp. without) a perturber near G2/C. The configuration and predicted\ntime-delays of J0408-5354 make it an excellent target for follow-up aimed at\nunderstanding the source quasar host galaxy and substructure in the lens, and\nmeasuring cosmological parameters. We also discuss some lessons learnt from\nJ0408-5354 on lensed quasar finding strategies, due to its chromaticity and\nmorphology.\n", "  The electronic and the structural properties of two dimensional van der Waals\nmetal/semiconductor heterostructures have been investigated through\nfirst-principles calculations. We have considered the recently synthesized\nborophene [Science {\\bf 350}, 1513 (2015)], and the planar boron sheets (S1 and\nS2) [Nature Chemistry {\\bf 8}, 563 (2016)] as the 2D metal layer, and the\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) \\mose, and \\wse\\ as the semiconductor\nmonolayer. We find that the energetic stability of those 2D metal/semiconductor\nheterojunctions is mostly ruled by the vdW interactions; however, chemical\ninteractions also take place in borophene/TMDC. The electronic charge transfers\nat the metal/semiconductor interface has been mapped, where we find a a net\ncharge transfer from the TMDCs to the boron sheets. Further electronic\nstructure calculations reveal that the metal/semiconductor interfaces, composed\nby planar boron sheets S1 and S2, present a p-type Schottky barrier which can\nbe tuned to a p-type ohmic contact upon an external electric field.\n", "  The study of Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN's) is a very active field.\nEarlier well-known results \\cite{Feinberg:def_01:87, Anderson:product_dist:10}\nidentify a topological quantity called deficiency, for any CRN, which, when\nexactly equal to zero, leads to a unique factorized steady-state for these\nnetworks. No results exist however for the steady states of non-zero-deficiency\nnetworks. In this paper, we show how to write the full moment-hierarchy for any\nnon-zero-deficiency CRN obeying mass-action kinetics, in terms of equations for\nthe factorial moments (FM). Using these, we can recursively predict values for\nlower moments from higher moments, reversing the procedure usually used to\nsolve moment hierarchies. We show, for non-trivial examples, that in this\nmanner we can predict to high accuracy, any moment of interest, for CRN's with\nnon-zero deficiency and non-factorizable steady states.\n", "  Integration between magnetism and topology is an exotic phenomenon in\ncondensed-matter physics. Here, we propose an exotic phase named topological\ncrystalline antiferromagnetic state, in which antiferromagnetism intrinsically\nintegrates with nontrivial topology, and we suggest such a state can be\nrealized in tetragonal FeS. A combination of first-principles calculations and\nsymmetry analyses shows that the topological crystalline antiferromagnetic\nstate arises from band reconstruction induced by pair checker-board\nantiferromagnetic order together with band-gap opening induced by intrinsic\nspin-orbit coupling in tetragonal FeS. The topological crystalline\nantiferromagnetic state is protected by the product of fractional translation\nsymmetry, mirror symmetry, and time-reversal symmetry, and present some unique\nfeatures. In contrast to strong topological insulators, the topological\nrobustness is surface-dependent. These findings indicate that non-trivial\ntopological states could emerge in pure antiferromagnetic materials, which\nsheds new light on potential applications of topological properties in\nfast-developing antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n", "  Growth kinetics of AlGaN in NH3 MBE under significant Ga desorption was\nstudied. It was found that the addition of gallium stimulates 2D growth and\nprovides better morphology of films compared to pure AlN. The effect was\nexperimentally observed at up to 98% desorption of the impinging gallium. We\nfound that, under the conditions of significant thermal desorption, larger\namounts of gallium were retained at lateral boundaries of 3D surface features\nthan at flat terraces because of the higher binding energy of Ga atoms at\nspecific surface defects. The selective accumulation of gallium resulted in an\nincrease in lateral growth component through the formation of the Ga-enriched\nAlGaN phase at boundaries of 3D surface features. We studied temperature\ndependence of AlGaN growth rate and developed a kinetic model analytically\ndescribing this dependence. As the model was in good agreement with the\nexperimental data, we used it to estimate the increase in the binding energy of\nGa atoms at surface defects compared to terrace surface cites using data on the\nGa content in different AlGaN phases. We also applied first-principles\ncalculations to the thermodynamic analysis of stable configurations on the AlN\nsurface and then used these surface configurations to compare the binding\nenergy of Ga atom at terraces and steps. Both first-principles calculations and\nanalytical estimations of the experimental results gave similar values of\ndifference in binding energies; this value is 0.3 eV.\n", "  When a free-falling liquid droplet is hit by a laser it experiences a strong\nablation driven pressure pulse. Here we study the resulting droplet deformation\nin the regime where the ablation pressure duration is short, i.e. comparable to\nthe time scale on which pressure waves travel through the droplet. To this end\nan acoustic analytic model for the pressure-, pressure impulse- and velocity\nfields inside the droplet is developed in the limit of small density\nfluctuations. This model is used to examine how the droplet deformation depends\non the pressure pulse duration while the total momentum to the droplet is kept\nconstant. Within the limits of this analytic model, we demonstrate that when\nthe total momentum transferred to the droplet is small the droplet\nshape-evolution is indistinguishable from an incompressible droplet\ndeformation. However, when the momentum transfer is increased the droplet\nresponse is strongly affected by the pulse duration. In this later regime,\ncompressed flow regimes alter the droplet shape evolution considerably.\n", "  A normal form approximation for the evolution of a reaction-diffusion system\nhosted on a directed graph is derived, in the vicinity of a supercritical Hopf\nbifurcation. Weak diffusive couplings are assumed to hold between adjacent\nnodes. Under this working assumption, a Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE)\nis obtained, whose coefficients depend on the parameters of the model and the\ntopological characteristics of the underlying network. The CGLE enables one to\nprobe the stability of the synchronous oscillating solution, as displayed by\nthe reaction-diffusion system above Hopf bifurcation. More specifically,\nconditions can be worked out for the onset of the symmetry breaking instability\nthat eventually destroys the uniform oscillatory state. Numerical tests\nperformed for the Brusselator model confirm the validity of the proposed\ntheoretical scheme. Patterns recorded for the CGLE resemble closely those\nrecovered upon integration of the original Brussellator dynamics.\n", "  We survey and enlarge the known mappings of the 16-vertex model, with\nemphasis on mappings between the even and odd 8-vertex subcases of the general\nmodel, also giving new mappings between these models, valid on finite toroidal\nlattices. In particular, we find new mappings between the models by using their\nalgebraic invariants with respect to the $SL(2)\\times SL(2)$ symmetry of the\n16-vertex model; we also find a larger set of weak-graph transformations. We\nshow many examples of models with negative weights which map to models with\nonly positive weights. Using the algebraic invariant relations of the even and\nodd 8-vertex models, we find the complete set of points in the complex field\nplane of the square lattice Ising model in a field which map to the even or odd\n8-vertex models; these points also correspond to the set of free-fermionic\npoints of the model. We do not find any new integrable points, but we find a\nnew mapping between the odd 8-vertex model and the square lattice Ising model\nat magnetic field $H= i\\pi/(2\\beta)$, valid on finite toroidal lattices. We\nalso show directly through various examples that mappings via algebraic\ninvariants do not fully exhaust the possible mappings a model may have with\nanother model. We construct a new solution to the odd 8-vertex free-fermion\nmodel which is valid on the finite lattice, since the previous known solution\nresulted from a mapping valid only in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we\ndetail for the first time the phase transitions of the column staggered\nfree-fermion 8-vertex model, and show that it can be mapped to the bi-partite\nstaggered free-fermion model.\n", "  We study the effective theory of a generic class of hidden sectors where\nsupersymmetry is broken together with an approximate R-symmetry at low energy.\nThe light spectrum contains the gravitino and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson\nof the R-symmetry, the R-axion. We derive new model-independent constraints on\nthe R-axion decay constant for R-axion masses ranging from GeV to TeV, which\nare of relevance for hadron colliders, lepton colliders and B-factories. The\ncurrent bounds allow for the exciting possibility that the first sign of SUSY\nwill be the R-axion. We point out its most distinctive signals, providing a new\nexperimental handle on the properties of the hidden sector and a solid\nmotivation for searches of axion-like particles.\n", "  The spin filter capability of a (0,8) armchair graphene nanoribbon with Fe\natoms at substitutional sites is investigated by density functional theory in\ncombination with the non-equilibrium Greens function technique. For specific\narrangements, a high degree of spin polarization is achieved. These include a\nsingle substitution at an edge position or double substitution in the central\nsector of the transmission element. The possibility of switching between\nmajority and minority spin polarization by changing the double substitution\ngeometry is predicted. Including the bias dependence of the transmission\nfunction proves to be essential for correct representation of the spin-resolved\ncurrent-voltage profiles.\n", "  We study the problem of estimating the phase shift due to the general\nrelativistic time dilation in the interference of photons using a non-linear\nMach-Zender interferometer setup. By introducing two non-linear Kerr materials,\none in the bottom and one in the top arm, we can measure the non-linear phase\n$\\phi_{NL}$ produced by the space-time curvature and achieve a scaling of the\nstandard deviation with photon number ($N$) of $1/N^{\\beta}$ where $\\beta > 1$,\nwhich exceeds the conventional Heisenberg limit of a linear interferometer\n($1/N$). The non-linear phase shift is an effect that is amplified by the\nintensity of the probe field. In a regime of high number of photons, this\neffect can dominate over the linear phase shift.\n", "  In this paper, we report on nontrivial results of our investigations of\ndynamic and thermodynamic moduli in search of invariants for viscous liquids in\nthe density scaling regime by using selected supercooled van der Waals liquids\nas representative materials. Previously, the dynamic modulus $M_{p-T}$ (defined\nin the pressure-temperature representation by the ratio of isobaric activation\nenergy and activation volume) as well as the ratio $B_{T}/M_{p-T}$ (where $B_T$\nis the thermodynamic modulus defined as the inverse isothermal compressibility)\nhave been suggested as some kind of material constants. We have established\nthat they are not valid in the explored wide range of temperatures $T$ over\ndozen decades of structural relaxation times $\\tau $. The temperature\ndependences of $M_{p-T}$ and $B_T/M_{p-T}$ have been elucidated by comparison\nwith the well-known measure of the relative contribution of temperature and\ndensity fluctuations to molecular dynamics near the glass transition, i.e., the\nratio of the isochoric and isobaric activation energies,\n$E^{act}_{V}/E^{act}_{p}$. Then, we have implemented an idea to transform the\ndefinition of the dynamic modulus $M_{p-T}$ from the p-T representation to the\nV-T one. This idea relied on the disentanglement of combined temperature and\ndensity fluctuations involved in isobaric parameters has resulted in finding an\ninvariant for viscous liquids in the density scaling regime, which is the ratio\nof the thermodynamic and dynamic moduli, $B_{T}/M_{V-T}$. In this way, we have\nconstituted a characteristic of thermodynamics and molecular dynamics, which\nremains unchanged in the supercooled liquid state for a given material, the\nmolecular dynamics of which obeys the power density scaling law.\n", "  Coherent Raman microscopy provide label-free imaging by interrogating the\nintrinsic vibration of biomolecules. Nevertheless, trade-off between high\nchemical-specificity and high imaging-speed currently exists in transition from\nspectroscopy to spectroscopic imaging when capturing dynamics in complex living\nsystems. Here, we present a novel concept in dual-comb scheme to substantially\nbeat this trade-off and facilitate high-resolution broadband coherent\nanti-Stokes Raman spectroscopic imaging based on down-converted, automatically\nvarying delay-time in spectral focusing excitation. A rapid measurement of\nvibrational microspectroscopy on sub-microsecond scale over a spectral span\n~700 cm-1 with solid signal-to-noise ratio provides access to well-resolved\nmolecular signatures within the fingerprint region. We demonstrate this\nhigh-performance spectroscopic imaging of spatially inhomogeneous distributions\nof chemical substances as well as the carotenoids accumulation in plant cells.\nThis technique offers an unprecedented route for broadband CARS imaging with\nhundreds of kHz frame rate using available 1-GHz oscillators.\n", "  We study the flux tubes produced by static quark-antiquark, quark-quark and\nquark-gluon charges at finite temperature in pure gauge SU(3) lattice QCD. Our\nsources are static and our lattice correlators are composed of fundamental and\nadjoint Polyakov loops. To signal the flux tubes, we compute the square\ndensities of the chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields with plaquettes, in a\ngauge invariant framework. We study the existence and non-existence of flux\ntubes both above and below the deconfinement phase transition temperature Tc.\nUsing the Lagrangian density as a probability distribution, we also compute the\nwidths of the flux tubes and study their widening as a function of the\nintercharge distance. We determine our results with both statistical and\nsystematic errors. Our computations are performed in NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA\nlanguage.\n", "  We introduce a multi-parameter deformation of the Fredkin spin $1/2$ chain\nwhose ground state is a weighted superposition of Dyck paths, depending on a\nset of parameters $t_i$ along the chain. The parameters are introduced in such\na way to maintain the system frustration-free while allowing to explore a range\nof possible phases. In the case where the parameters are uniform, and a color\ndegree of freedom is added we establish a phase diagram with a transition\nbetween an area law and a volume low. The volume entropy obtained for half a\nchain is $n \\log s$ where $n$ is the half-chain length and $s$ is the number of\ncolors. Next, we prove an upper bound on the spectral gap of the $t>1, s>1$\nphase, scaling as $\\Delta=O((4s)^nt^{-n^2/2})$, similar to a recent a result\nabout the deformed Motzkin model, albeit derived in a different way. Finally,\nusing an additional variational argument we prove an exponential lower bound on\nthe gap of the model for $t>1, s=1$, which provides an example of a system with\nbounded entanglement entropy and a vanishing spectral gap.\n", "  The Hawking-Perry-Strominger (HPS) work [1] states a new controversial idea\nabout the black hole (BH) information paradox [2-5] where BHs maximally\nentropize and encode information in their event horizon area [6,7], with no\n\"hair\" were thought to reveal information outside but angular momentum, mass\nand electric charge only [8,9] in a unique quantum gravity (QG) vacuum state.\nThis new idea invokes new conservation laws involving gravitation and\nelectromagnetism [10,11], to generate different QG vacua and preserve more\ninformation in hair implants. In the context of black holes and the HPS\nproposal we find that BH photon hair implants can be spatially shaped ad hoc\nand encode structured and densely organized information on the event horizon\ninvolving novel aspect in the discussion a particular aspect of EM fields,\nnamely the spatial information of the field associated to its orbital angular\nmomentum. BHs can have \"curly\", twisted, soft-hair implants with vorticity\nwhere structured information is holographically encoded in the event horizon in\nan organized way.\n", "  ReS$_2$ is considered as a promising candidate for novel electronic and\nsensor applications. The low crystal symmetry of the van der Waals compound\nReS$_2$ leads to a highly anisotropic optical, vibrational, and transport\nbehavior. However, the details of the electronic band structure of this\nfascinating material are still largely unexplored. We present a\nmomentum-resolved study of the electronic structure of monolayer, bilayer, and\nbulk ReS$_2$ using k-space photoemission microscopy in combination with\nfirst-principles calculations. We demonstrate that the valence electrons in\nbulk ReS$_2$ are - contrary to assumptions in recent literature - significantly\ndelocalized across the van der Waals gap. Furthermore, we directly observe the\nevolution of the valence band dispersion as a function of the number of layers,\nrevealing a significantly increased effective electron mass in single-layer\ncrystals. We also find that only bilayer ReS$_2$ has a direct band gap. Our\nresults establish bilayer ReS$_2$ as a advantageous building block for\ntwo-dimensional devices and van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  While non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) foresees a variety of elementary\nquarkonium production mechanisms naturally leading to state-dependent kinematic\npatterns, the LHC cross sections and polarization measurements reveal a\nremarkably simple production scenario, independent of the quantum numbers and\nmasses of the quarkonia. Surprisingly, NRQCD is able to accommodate the\nobserved universal scenario, through a series of conspiring cancellations\nsmoothing out its otherwise variegated hierarchy of mechanisms. This seemingly\nunnatural solution implies that the $\\chi_{c1}$ and $\\chi_{c2}$ polarizations,\nnot yet measured, are strong and opposite, representing the only potential\nexception to a remarkably simple picture of quarkonium production. The\nobservation of a large difference between $\\chi_{c2}$ and $\\chi_{c1}$\npolarizations, which cannot be indirectly extracted from existing measurements\nbecause they mutually cancel each other in their contribution to the observed\nJ/$\\psi$ production, would be a smoking gun signal finally proving the\nmultifaceted but mysteriously elusive structure of NRQCD. On the other hand,\nthe measurement of two similar, small polarizations will urge improved P-wave\ncalculations, if not a substantial revision of the NRQCD hierarchies.\n", "  Ionisation cluster size distributions produced in the sensitive volume of an\nion-counting wall-less nanodosimeter by monoenergetic carbon ions with energies\nbetween 45 MeV and 150 MeV were measured at the TANDEM-ALPI ion accelerator\nfacility complex of the LNL INFN in Legnaro. Those produced by monoenergetic\nhelium ions with energies between 2 MeV and 20 MeV were measured at the\naccelerator facilities of PTB and with a 241Am alpha particle source. C3H8 was\nused as the target gas. The ionisation cluster size distributions were measured\nin narrow beam geometry with the primary beam passing the target volume at\nspecified distances from its centre, and in broad beam geometry with a fan-like\nprimary beam. By applying a suitable drift time window, the effective size of\nthe target volume was adjusted to match the size of a DNA segment. The measured\ndata were compared with the results of simulations obtained with the PTB Monte\nCarlo code PTra. Before the comparison, the simulated cluster size\ndistributions were corrected with respect to the background of additional\nionisations produced in the transport system of the ionised target gas\nmolecules. Measured and simulated characteristics of the particle track\nstructure are in good agreement for both types of primary particles and for\nboth types of the irradiation geometry.\n", "  It is well known that two-dimensional mappings preserving a rational elliptic\nfibration, like the Quispel-Roberts-Thompson mappings, can be deautonomized to\ndiscrete Painlev\\'e equations. However, the dependence of this procedure on the\nchoice of a particular elliptic fiber has not been sufficiently investigated.\nIn this paper we establish a way of performing the deautonomization for a pair\nof an autonomous mapping and a fiber. %By choosing a particular Starting from a\nsingle autonomous mapping but varying the type of a chosen fiber, we obtain\ndifferent types of discrete Painlev\\'e equations using this deautonomization\nprocedure. We also introduce a technique for reconstructing a mapping from the\nknowledge of its induced action on the Picard group and some additional\ngeometric data. This technique allows us to obtain factorized expressions of\ndiscrete Painlev\\'e equations, including the elliptic case. Further, by\nimposing certain restrictions on such non-autonomous mappings we obtain new and\nsimple elliptic difference Painlev\\'e equations, including examples whose\nsymmetry groups do not appear explicitly in Sakai's classification.\n", "  A simple physical model for calculation of the ion-induced soft error rate in\nspace environment has been proposed, based on the phenomenological cross\nsection notion. Proposed numerical procedure is adapted to the multiple cell\nupset characterization in highly scaled memories. Nonlocality of the ion impact\nhas been revealed as the key concept determining the difference between\nphysical processes in low scaled and highly scaled memories. The model has been\nvalidated by comparison between the simulation results and the literature\non-board data. It was shown that proposed method provides single-valued\nprediction results correlating well with on-board data based solely on cross\nsection data and LET spectra without any hidden fitting parameters and\nprocedures.\n", "  The design of graphene-based composite with high thermal conductivity\nrequires a comprehensive understanding of phonon coupling in graphene. We\nextended the two-temperature model to coupled groups of phonon. The study give\nnew physical quantities, the phonon-phonon coupling factor and length, to\ncharacterize the couplings quantitatively. Besides, our proposed coupling\nlength has an obvious dependence on system size. Our studies can not only\nobserve the nonequilibrium between different groups of phonon, but explain\ntheoretically the thermal resistance inside graphene.\n", "  Long range frequency chirping of Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes, whose\nexistence is determined by the fast particles, is investigated in cases where\nthese particles do not move freely and their motion is bounded to restricted\norbits. An equilibrium oscillating potential, which creates different orbit\ntopologies of energetic particles, is included into the bump-on-tail\ninstability problem of a plasma wave. With respect to fast particles dynamics,\nthe extended model captures the range of particles motion (trapped/passing)\nwith energy and thus represents a more realistic 1D picture of the long range\nsweeping events observed for weakly damped modes, e.g. global Alfven\neigenmodes, in tokamaks. The Poisson equation is solved numerically along with\nbounce averaging the Vlasov equation in the adiabatic regime. We demonstrate\nthat the shape and the saturation amplitude of the nonlinear mode structure\ndepends not only on the amount of deviation from the initial eigenfrequency but\nalso on the initial energy of the resonant electrons in the equilibrium\npotential. Similarly, the results reveal that the resonant electrons following\ndifferent equilibrium orbits in the electrostatic potential lead to different\nrates of frequency evolution. As compared to the previous model [Breizman B.N.\n2010 Nucl. Fusion 50 084014], it is shown that the frequency sweeps with lower\nrates. The additional physics included in the model enables a more complete 1D\ndescription of the range of phenomena observed in experiments.\n", "  An important ingredient in numerical modelling of high temperature magnetised\nastrophysical plasmas is the anisotropic transport of heat along magnetic field\nlines from higher to lower temperatures.Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) typically\ninvolves solving the hyperbolic set of conservation equations along with the\ninduction equation. Incorporating anisotropic thermal conduction requires to\nalso treat parabolic terms arising from the diffusion operator. An explicit\ntreatment of parabolic terms will considerably reduce the simulation time step\ndue to its dependence on the square of the grid resolution ($\\Delta x$) for\nstability. Although an implicit scheme relaxes the constraint on stability, it\nis difficult to distribute efficiently on a parallel architecture. Treating\nparabolic terms with accelerated super-time stepping (STS) methods has been\ndiscussed in literature but these methods suffer from poor accuracy (first\norder in time) and also have difficult-to-choose tuneable stability parameters.\nIn this work we highlight a second order (in time) Runge Kutta Legendre (RKL)\nscheme (first described by Meyer et. al. 2012) that is robust, fast and\naccurate in treating parabolic terms alongside the hyperbolic conversation\nlaws. We demonstrate its superiority over the first order super time stepping\nschemes with standard tests and astrophysical applications. We also show that\nexplicit conduction is particularly robust in handling saturated thermal\nconduction. Parallel scaling of explicit conduction using RKL scheme is\ndemonstrated up to more than $10^4$ processors.\n", "  A new semi-empirical formula for calculations of $\\alpha$~decay halflives is\npresented. It was derived from Royer relationship by introducing new parameters\nwhich are fixed by fit to a set of experimental data. We are using three sets:\nset A with 130 e-e (even-even), 119 e-o (even-odd), 109 o-e, and 96 o-o, set B\nwith 188 e-e, 147 e-o, 131 o-e, and 114 o-o, and set C with 136 e-e, 84 e-o, 76\no-e, and 48 o-o alpha emitters. A comparison of results obtained with the new\nformula and the following well known relationships: semFIS (semiempirical based\non fission theory), ASAF (analytical superAsymmetric fission) model, and UNIV\n(universal formula) is made in terms of rms standard deviation. We also\nintroduced a weighted mean value of this quantity, allowing to compare the\nglobal properties of a given model. For the set B the order of the four models\nis the following: semFIS, UNIV, newF, and ASAF. Nevertheless for even-even\nalpha emitters UNIV gives the 2nd best result after semFIS, and for odd-even\nparents the 2nd is newF. Despite its simplicity in comparison with semFIS the\nnew formula, presented in this article, behaves quite well, competing with the\nothers well known relationships.\n", "  Special gravity refers to interacting theories of massless gravitons in\nMinkowski space-time which are invariant under the abelian gauge invariance\n$h_{ab}\\rightarrow h_{ab}+\\partial_{(a}\\chi_{b)}$ only. In this article we\ndetermine the most general form of special gravity free of Ostrogradski ghosts,\nmeaning its equation of motion is of at most second order. Together with the\nrecent works, this result could be helpful in formulating proofs of General\nRelativity as the unique physical theory of self-interacting massless\ngravitons. We also study how to construct gauge invariant couplings to matter\nfields.\n", "  We show that a topological quantum phase transition, generating flat bands\nand altering Fermi surface topology, is a primary reason for the exotic\nbehavior of the overdoped high-temperature superconductors represented by $\\rm\nLa_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$, whose superconductivity features differ from what is\ndescribed by the classical Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory [J.I. Bo\\^zovi\\'c,\nX. He, J. Wu, and A. T. Bollinger, Nature 536, 309 (2016)]. We demonstrate that\n1) at temperature $T=0$, the superfluid density $n_s$ turns out to be\nconsiderably smaller than the total electron density; 2) the critical\ntemperature $T_c$ is controlled by $n_s$ rather than by doping, and is a linear\nfunction of the $n_s$; 3) at $T>T_c$ the resistivity $\\rho(T)$ varies linearly\nwith temperature, $\\rho(T)\\propto \\alpha T$, where $\\alpha$ diminishes with\n$T_c\\to 0$, while in the normal overdoped (non superconducting) region with\n$T_c=0$, the resistivity becomes $\\rho(T)\\propto T^2$. The theoretical results\npresented are in good agreement with recent experimental observations, closing\nthe colossal gap between these empirical findings and\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like theories.\n", "  We study the Starobinsky or $R^2$ model of $f(R)=R+\\alpha R^2$ for neutron\nstars with the structure equations represented by the coupled differential\nequations and the \\emph{polytropic} type of the matter equation of state. The\njunction conditions of $f(R)$ gravity are used as the boundary conditions to\nmatch the Schwarschild solution at the surface of the star. Based on these the\nconditions, we demonstrate that the coupled differential equations can be\nsolved \\emph{directly}. In particular, from the dimensionless equation of state\n$\\bar{\\rho} = \\bar{k}\\, \\bar{p}^{\\,\\gamma}$ with $\\bar{k}\\sim5.0$ and\n$\\gamma\\sim0.75$ and the constraint of $\\alpha\\lesssim {1.47722}\\times 10^{7}\\,\n\\text{m}^2$, we obtain the \\emph{minimal} mass of the NS to be around 1.44\n$M_{\\odot}$. In addition, if $\\bar{k}$ is larger than 5.0, the mass and radius\nof the NS would be smaller.\n", "  We present a polarization-resolved photoluminescence study of the exchange\ninteraction effects in a prototype system consisting of an individual Fe2+ ion\nand a single neutral exciton confined in a CdSe/ZnSe quantum dot. Maximal\npossible number of eight fully linearly-polarized lines in the bright exciton\nemission spectrum is observed, evidencing complete degeneracy lifting in the\ninvestigated system. We discuss conditions required for such a scenario to take\nplace: anisotropy of the electron-hole interaction and the zero-field splitting\nof the Fe2+ ion spin states. Neglecting of either of these components is shown\nto restore partial degeneracy of the transitions, making the excitonic spectrum\nsimilar to those previously reported for all other systems of quantum dots with\nsingle magnetic dopants.\n", "  In theories with a perturbatively massless 2-form (dual to an axion), a\nparadox may arise in the process of black hole evaporation. Schwarzschild black\nholes can support a non-trivial Wilson-line-type field, the integral of the\n2-form around their horizon. After such an 'axionic black hole' evaporates, the\nWilson line must be supported by the corresponding 3-form field strength in the\nregion formerly occupied by the black hole. In the limit of small axion\ndecay-constant f, the energy required for this field configuration is too\nlarge. The natural resolution is through the presence of light strings, which\nallow the black hole to \"shed\" its axionic hair sufficiently early. This gives\nrise to a new Weak-Gravity-type argument in the 2-form context: Small coupling,\nin this case f, enforces the presence of light strings or a low cutoff. We also\ndiscuss how this argument may be modified in situations where the weak coupling\nregime is achieved in the low-energy effective theory through an appropriate\ngauging of a model with a vector field and two 2-forms.\n", "  Polarization-based filtering in fiber lasers is well-known to enable spectral\ntunability and a wide range of dynamical operating states. This effect is\nrarely exploited in practical systems, however, because optimization of cavity\nparameters is non-trivial and evolves due to environmental sensitivity. Here,\nwe report a genetic algorithm-based approach, utilizing electronic control of\nthe cavity transfer function, to autonomously achieve broad wavelength tuning\nand the generation of Q-switched pulses with variable repetition rate and\nduration. The practicalities and limitations of simultaneous spectral and\ntemporal self-tuning from a simple fiber laser are discussed, paving the way to\non-demand laser properties through algorithmic control and machine learning\nschemes.\n", "  The spectral renormalization method was introduced by Ablowitz and Musslimani\nin 2005, [Opt. Lett. 30, pp. 2140-2142] as an effective way to numerically\ncompute (time-independent) bound states for certain nonlinear boundary value\nproblems. % of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS), Gross-Pitaevskii and water\nwave type equations to mention a few. In this paper, we extend those ideas to\nthe time domain and introduce a time-dependent spectral renormalization method\nas a numerical means to simulate linear and nonlinear evolution equations. The\nessence of the method is to convert the underlying evolution equation from its\npartial or ordinary differential form (using Duhamel's principle) into an\nintegral equation. The solution sought is then viewed as a fixed point in both\nspace and time. The resulting integral equation is then numerically solved\nusing a simple renormalized fixed-point iteration method. Convergence is\nachieved by introducing a time-dependent renormalization factor which is\nnumerically computed from the physical properties of the governing evolution\nequation. The proposed method has the ability to incorporate physics into the\nsimulations in the form of conservation laws or dissipation rates. This novel\nscheme is implemented on benchmark evolution equations: the classical nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS), integrable $PT$ symmetric nonlocal NLS and the viscous\nBurgers' equations, each of which being a prototypical example of a\nconservative and dissipative dynamical system. Numerical implementation and\nalgorithm performance are also discussed.\n", "  We present an all-sky search for muon neutrinos produced during the prompt\n$\\gamma$-ray emission of 1172 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory. The detection of these neutrinos would constitute evidence for\nultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) production in GRBs, as interactions\nbetween accelerated protons and the prompt $\\gamma$-ray field would yield\ncharged pions, which decay to neutrinos. A previously reported search for muon\nneutrino tracks from Northern Hemisphere GRBs has been extended to include\nthree additional years of IceCube data. A search for such tracks from Southern\nHemisphere GRBs in five years of IceCube data has been introduced to enhance\nour sensitivity to the highest energy neutrinos. No significant correlation\nbetween neutrino events and observed GRBs is seen in the new data. Combining\nthis result with previous muon neutrino track searches and a search for cascade\nsignature events from all neutrino flavors, we obtain new constraints for\nsingle-zone fireball models of GRB neutrino and UHECR production.\n", "  We discuss the effect of a magnetic thin-film ribbon at the surface of a\ntopological insulator on the charge and spin transport due to surface\nelectrons.\\\\ If the magnetization in the magnetic ribbon is perpendicular to\nthe surface of a topological insulator, it leads to a gap in the energy\nspectrum of surface electrons. As a result, the ribbon is a barrier for\nelectrons, which leads to electrical resistance.\\\\ We have calculated\nconductance of such a structure. The conductance reveal some oscillations with\nthe length of the magnetized region due to the interference of transmitted and\nreflected waves. We have also calculated the Seebeck coefficient when electron\nflux is due to a temperature gradient.\n", "  The dressed states arising from the interaction between electrons and holes,\nand off-resonant electromagnetic radiation have been investigated for recently\nfabricated gapped and anisotropic black phosphorus. Our calculations were\ncarried out for the low-energy electronic subbands near the $\\Gamma$ point.\nStates for both linear and circular polarizations of the incoming radiation\nhave been computed. However, our principal emphasis is on linearly polarized\nlight with arbitrary polarization since this case has not been given much\nattention for dressing fields imposed on anisotropic structures. We have\nconsidered various cases for one- and few-layer phosphorus, including massless\nDirac fermions with tunable in-plane anisotropy. Initial Hamiltonian parameters\nare renormalized in a largely different way compared to those for previously\nreported for gapped Dirac structures and, most importantly, existing anisotropy\nwhich could be modified in every direction.\n", "  80% of all Renewable Energy Power in Germany is installed in tree-like\ndistribution grids. Intermittent power fluctuations from such sources introduce\nnew dynamics into the lower grid layers. At the same time, distributed\nresources will have to contribute to stabilize the grid against these\nfluctuations in the future. In this paper, we model a system of distributed\nresources as oscillators on a tree-like, lossy power grid and its ability to\nwithstand desynchronization from localized intermittent renewable infeed.\n  We find a remarkable interplay of network structure and the position of the\nnode at which the fluctuations are fed in. An important precondition for our\nfindings is the presence of losses in distribution grids. Then, the most\nnetwork central node splits the network into branches with different influence\non network stability. Troublemakers, i.e. nodes at which fluctuations are\nespecially exciting the grid, tend to be downstream branches with high net\npower outflow. For low coupling strength, we also find branches of nodes\nvulnerable to fluctuations anywhere in the network. These network regions can\nbe predicted at high confidence using an eigenvector based network measure\ntaking the turbulent nature of perturbations into account.\n  While we focus here on tree-like networks, the observed effects also appear,\nalbeit less pronounced, for weakly meshed grids. On the other hand the observed\neffects disappear for lossless power grids often studied in the complex systems\nliterature.\n", "  A time fractional quantum framework has been introduced into quantum\nmechanics. A new version of the space-time fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation\nhas been launched. The introduced space-time fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation\nhas a new scale parameter, which is a fractional generalization of Planck's\nconstant in quantum physics. It has been shown that the presence of a time\nfractional time derivative in the space-time fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation\nsignificantly impacts quantum mechanical fundamentals. Time fractional quantum\nmechanical operators of coordinate, momentum and angular momentum were defined\nand their commutation relationships were established. The pseudo-Hamilton\noperator was introduced and its Hermicity has been proven. Two new functions\nrelated to the Mittag-Leffler function have been introduced to solve the\nspace-time fractional Schr\\\"odinger equation. Energy of a time fractional\nquantum system has been defined and calculated in terms of the newly introduced\nfunctions. It has been found that in the framework of time fractional quantum\nmechanics there are no stationary states, and the eigenvalues of the\npseudo-Hamilton operator are not the energy levels of the time fractional\nquantum system. A free particle solution to the space-time fractional\nSchr\\\"odinger equation was found. A free particle space-time fractional quantum\nmechanical kernel has been found and expressed in terms of the H-function.\nRenormalization properties of a free particle solution and the space-time\nfractional quantum kernel were established. Some particular cases of time\nfractional quantum mechanics have been analyzed and discussed.\n", "  We study the $ZH$ associated production followed by the Higgs $H\\to \\gamma\n\\bar{\\gamma}$ decay into a photon plus an invisible and massless dark photon,\nat future high-energy $e^+e^-$ facilities. Large $H\\to \\gamma \\bar{\\gamma}$\ndecay rates (with branching ratios up to a few percent) are allowed, thanks to\npossible non-decoupling properties of the Higgs boson under specific\nconditions, and unsuppressed dark-photon couplings in the dark sector. Such\nlarge decay rates can be obtained in the framework of recent flavor models that\naim to naturally explain the observed spread in the fermion mass spectrum. We\nanalyze the experimental prospects for observing the $e^+e^-\\rightarrow ZH$\nprocess followed by the semi invisible Higgs decay into a photon plus a\nmassless invisible system. Search strategies for both the leptonic and the\nhadronic final states (arising from $Z\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $Z\\rightarrow\nq\\bar{q}$, respectively) are outlined. We find that a $5\\sigma$ sensitivity to\na branching fraction $BR_{\\gamma\\bar{\\gamma}}\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}$ can be\nachieved by combining the two channels with an integrated luminosity of 10\nab$^{-1}$ at a c.m. energy of 240 GeV. This is considerably better than the\ncorresponding sensitivity in alternative channels previously studied at lepton\ncolliders. The analysis is model independent, and its results can be\nstraightforwardly applied to the search of any Higgs two-body decay into a\nphoton plus an undetected light particle.\n", "  The unsteady electrorotation of a drop of a viscous weakly conducting\npolarizable liquid suspended in another viscous weakly conducting polarizable\nliquid immiscible with the former in an applied constant uniform electric field\nis theoretically investigated. The surface tension of the drop is regarded as\nsufficiently large for deformation of the drop under the action of the applied\nelectric field and the electrohydrodynamic flow can be considered small and the\ndrop can be considered spherical in the calculation of the electric field and\nflow. The electric field intensity and the velocity and pressure in the\nelectrohydrodynamic flow are sought for in the form of a series solution with\ntime-dependent scalar, vector, and tensor coefficients for which relations are\nfound allowing one to determine them. The coefficients are sought for in the\nform of asymptotic expansions over the parameter, the smallness of which\ncorresponds to the sufficiently large viscosity of the drop with respect to\nthat of the surrounding liquid. The differential equations for the terms of the\ndimensionless expansions up to the first and second orders with respect to this\nparameter are obtained. Their stationary solutions are found in the explicit\nform and their stability is investigated. Up to the terms of the second order,\ntransitions to deformational oscillations of the drop are established not to\noccur.\n", "  Inspired by Kubo-Anderson Markov processes, we introduce a new class of\ntransfer matrices whose largest eigenvalue is determined by a simple explicit\nalgebraic equation. Applications include the free energy calculation for\nvarious equilibrium systems and a general criterion for perfect harmonicity,\ni.e., a free energy that is exactly quadratic in the external field. As an\nillustration, we construct a \"perfect spring\", namely a polymer with\nnon-Gaussian, exponentially distributed sub-units which nevertheless remains\nharmonic until it is fully stretched. This surprising discovery is confirmed by\nMonte Carlo and Langevin simulations.\n", "  Chemical reactions can accelerate, slow down or even be at the very origin of\nthe development of dissolution-driven convection in partially miscible\nstratifications, when they impact the density profile in the host fluid phase.\nWe numerically analyze the dynamics of this reactive convective dissolution in\nthe fully developed non-linear regime for a phase A dissolving into a host\nlayer containing a dissolved reactant B. We show that for a general\nA+B$\\rightarrow$C reaction in solution, the dynamics vary with the Rayleigh\nnumbers of the chemical species, i.e. with the nature of the chemicals in the\nhost phase. Depending on whether the reaction slows down, accelerates or is at\nthe origin of the development of convection, the spatial distributions of\nspecies A, B or C, the dissolution flux and the reaction rate are different. We\nshow that chemical reactions enhance the steady-state flux as they consume A\nand can induce more intense convection than in the absence of reactions. This\nresult is important in the context of CO$_2$ geological sequestration where\nquantifying the storage rate of CO$_2$ dissolving into the host oil or aqueous\nphase is crucial to assess the efficiency and the safety of the project.\n", "  We present an implementation of dispersion-scan based on self-diffraction (SD\nd-scan) and apply it to the measurement of over octave-spanning sub-4-fs\npulses. The results are compared with second-harmonic generation (SHG) d-scan.\nThe efficiency of the SD process is derived theoretically and compared with the\nspectral response retrieved by the d-scan algorithm. The new SD d-scan has a\nrobust inline setup and enables measuring pulses with over-octave spectra,\nsingle-cycle durations and wavelength ranges beyond those of SHG crystals, such\nas the ultraviolet and the deep-ultraviolet.\n", "  We have synthesized nanoscale magnetic compasses with high yield. These\nferromagnetic iron carbide nano-particles, which are encapsulated in a pair of\nparallel carbon needles, change their direction in response to an external\nmagnetic field. Electron holography reveals magnetic fields confined to the\nvicinity of the bicone-shaped particles, which are composed of few\nferromagnetic domains. Aligned magnetically and encapsulated in an acrylate\npolymer matrix, these nanocompasses exhibit anisotropic bulk magnetic\npermeability with an easy axis normal to the needle direction, that can be\nunderstood as a result of the anisotropic demagnetizing field of a nonspherical\nsingle-domain particle. This novel material with orthogonal magnetic and\nstructural axes could be highly useful as magnetic components in\nelectromagnetic wave absorbent materials and magnetorheological fluids.\n", "  Spontaneous synchronization is a significant collective behavior of weakly\ncoupled systems. Due to their inherent nonlinear nature, optomechanical systems\ncan exhibit self-sustained oscillations which can be exploited for\nsynchronizing different mechanical resonators. In this paper, we explore the\nsynchronization dynamics of two membranes coupled to a common optical field\nwithin a cavity, and pumped with a strong blue-detuned laser drive. We focus on\nthe system quantum dynamics in the parameter regime corresponding to\nsynchronization of the classical motion of the two membranes. With an\nappropriate definition of the phase difference operator for the resonators, we\nstudy synchronization in the quantum case through the covariance matrix\nformalism. We find that for sufficiently large driving, quantum synchronization\nis robust with respect to quantum fluctuations and to thermal noise up to not\ntoo large temperatures. Under synchronization, the two membranes are never\nentangled, while quantum discord behaves similarly to quantum synchronization,\nthat is, it is larger when the variance of the phase difference is smaller.\n", "  A Higgs-like dilaton owns couplings that differ from those of the Standard\nModel Higgs and of a generic Composite Higgs. The complete bosonic basis for a\nHiggs-like dilaton is presented at the first subleading order. A comparison\nwith the Standard Model, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and the\ngeneric Lagrangian for the minimal $SO(5)/SO(4)$ Composite Higgs model is\nperformed. Observables that can disentangle the different hypotheses are\nidentified.\n", "  Three dimensional galaxy clustering measurements provide a wealth of\ncosmological information. However, obtaining spectra of galaxies is expensive,\nand surveys often only measure redshifts for a subsample of a target galaxy\npopulation. Provided that the spectroscopic data is representative, we argue\nthat angular pair upweighting should be used in these situations to improve the\n3D clustering measurements. We present a toy model showing mathematically how\nsuch a weighting can improve measurements, and provide a practical example of\nits application using mocks created for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS). Our analysis of mocks suggests that, if an angular clustering\nmeasurement is available over twice the area covered spectroscopically,\nweighting gives a $\\sim$10-20% reduction of the variance of the monopole\ncorrelation function on the BAO scale.\n", "  Fracton topological phases host fractionalized excitations that are either\ncompletely immobile or only mobile along certain lines or planes. We\ndemonstrate how such phases can be understood in terms of two fundamentally\ndifferent types of parton constructions, in which physical degrees of freedom\nare decomposed into clusters of \"parton\" degrees of freedom subject to emergent\ngauge constraints. First, we employ non-interacting partons subject to multiple\noverlapping constraints to describe a fermionic fracton model. Second, we\ndemonstrate how interacting partons can be used to develop new models of\nbosonic fracton phases, both with string and membrane logical operators (type-I\nfracton phases) and with fractal logical operators (type-II fracton phases). In\nparticular, we find a new type-II model which saturates a bound on its\ninformation storage capacity. Our parton approach is generic beyond exactly\nsolvable models and provides a variational route to realizing fracton phases in\nmore physically realistic systems.\n", "  We consider the large $L$ limit of one dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators\n$H_L=-d^2/dx^2 + V_1(x) + V_{2,L}(x)$ in two cases: when $V_{2,L}(x)=V_2(x-L)$\nand when $V_{2,L}(x)=e^{-cL}\\delta(x-L)$. This is motivated by some recent work\nof Herbst and Mavi where $V_{2,L}$ is replaced by a Dirichlet boundary\ncondition at $L$. The Hamiltonian $H_L$ converges to $H = -d^2/dx^2 + V_1(x)$\nas $L\\to \\infty$ in the strong resolvent sense (and even in the norm resolvent\nsense for our second case). However, most of the resonances of $H_L$ do not\nconverge to those of $H$. Instead, they crowd together and converge onto a\nhorizontal line: the real axis in our first case and the line $\\Im(k)=-c/2$ in\nour second case. In the region below the horizontal line resonances of $H_L$\nconverge to the reflectionless points of $H$ and to those of $-d^2/dx^2 +\nV_2(x)$. It is only in the region between the real axis and the horizontal line\n(empty in our first case) that resonances of $H_L$ converge to resonances of\n$H$. Although the resonances of $H$ may not be close to any resonance of $H_L$\nwe show that they still influence the time evolution under $H_L$ for a long\ntime when $L$ is large.\n", "  The gauge dependence problem of the effective action for general gauge\ntheories in the framework of a modified functional renormalization group\napproach proposed recently is studied. It is shown that the effective action\nremains gauge-dependent on-shell.\n", "  In this paper we consider the phase retrieval problem for Herglotz functions,\nthat is, solutions of the Helmholtz equation $\\Delta u+\\lambda^2u=0$ on domains\n$\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\geq2$. In dimension $d=2$, if $u,v$ are two\nsuch solutions then $|u|=|v|$ implies that either $u=cv$ or $u=c\\bar v$ for\nsome $c\\in\\mathbb{C}$ with $|c|=1$. In dimension $d\\geq3$, the same conclusion\nholds under some restriction on $u$ and $v$: either they are real valued or\nzonal functions or have non vanishing mean.\n", "  General relativity and quantum mechanism are two separate rules of modern\nphysics explaining how nature works. Both theories are accurate, but the direct\nconnection between two theories was not yet clarified. Recently, researchers\nblur the line between classical and quantum physics by connecting chaos and\nentanglement. Here, we showed the early reported extended HM theory that\nincluded the general relativity can also be used to recover the classic chaos\nequations and even the Schrodinger equation in quantum physics, suggesting the\nextended theory of harmonic maps may act as a universal theory of physics.\n", "  A weakly-nonlinear potential theory is developed for the description of deep\npenetrating pressure fields caused by single and colliding wave groups of\ncollinear waves due to the second-order nonlinear interactions. The result is\napplied to the representative case of groups with the sech-shape of envelope\nsolitons in deep water. When solitary groups experience a head-on collision,\nthe induced due to nonlinearity dynamic pressure may have magnitude comparable\nwith the magnitude of the linear solution. It attenuates with depth with\ncharacteristic length of the group, which may greatly exceed the individual\nwave length. In general the picture of the dynamic pressure beneath intense\nwave groups looks complicated. The qualitative difference in the structure of\nthe induced pressure field for unidirectional and opposite wave trains is\nemphasized.\n", "  It is well known in enzyme kinetics that the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation\nis applicable only to enzymes in the steady state. We show that the result\nobtained in the previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 218301 (2011)] is\ninconsistent with the MM equation, not because the authors considered the\nenzyme system at mesoscopic concentrations but because they considered the\nenzyme system in the non-stationary state. The substrate concentration\ndependence of the mean turnover time is, in fact, consistent with the MM\nequation in the steady state, regardless of the number of enzymes in the\nsystem.\n", "  Hysteresis characteristics of the crystal field diluted general Spin-S\n($S>1$) Blume-Capel model have been studied within the effective field\napproximation. Particular emphasis has been paid on the large negative valued\ncrystal field and low temperature region and it has been demonstrated for this\nregion that, rising dilution of the crystal field results in decreasing number\nof windowed hysteresis loops. The evolution of the multiple hysteresis loop\nwith the dilution of the crystal field has been investigated and physical\nmechanism behind this evolution has been given.\n", "  The neutrino $\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection symmetry has been attracting a lot of\nattention as it predicts the interesting results $\\theta^{}_{23} = \\pi/4$ and\n$\\delta = \\pm \\pi/2$. But it is reasonable to consider breakings of such a\nsymmetry either from the theoretical considerations or on the basis of\nexperimental results. We thus perform a systematic study for the possible\nsymmetry-breaking patterns and their implications for the mixing parameters.\nThe general treatment is applied to some specific symmetry breaking arising\nfrom the renormalization group effects for illustration.\n", "  Tin Selenide (SnSe) is one of the best thermoelectric materials reported to\ndate. The possibility of growing few-layer SnSe helped boost the interest in\nthis long-known, earth abundant material. Pristine SnSe in bulk, mono- and\nfew-layer forms are reported to have indirect electronic bandgaps. Possible\nindirect-direct transition in SnSe is attractive for its optoelectronic-related\napplications. Based on the results from first principles Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) calculations, we carefully analyzed electronic band structures of\nbulk, and bilayer SnSe with various interlayer stackings. We report the\npossible stacking-dependent indirect-direct transition of bilayer SnSe. By\nfurther analysis, our results reveal that it is the directionality of\ninterlayer interactions that determine the critical features of their\nelectronic band structures. In fact, by engineering the interface stacking\nbetween layers, it is possible to achieve few-layer SnSe with direct electronic\nband gap. This study provides fundamental insights to design few-layer SnSe and\nSnSe heterostructures for electronic/optoelectronic applications, where the\ninterface geometry plays a fundamental role in device performance.\n", "  We present the first numerical computation of two-loop amplitudes based on\nthe unitarity method. As a proof of principle, we compute the four-gluon\nprocess. We discuss the new method, analyze its numerical properties and apply\nit to reconstruct the analytic form of the amplitudes. The numerical method is\nuniversal, and can be automated to provide multi-scale two-loop computations\nfor phenomenologically relevant signatures at hadron colliders.\n", "  We compare correlators for pseudoscalar and vector mesons made from valence\nstrange quarks using the clover quark and highly improved staggered quark\n(HISQ) formalisms in full lattice QCD. We use fully nonperturbative methods to\nnormalise vector and axial vector current operators made from HISQ quarks,\nclover quarks and from combining HISQ and clover fields. This allows us to test\nexpectations for the renormalisation factors based on perturbative QCD, with\nimplications for the error budget of lattice QCD calculations of the matrix\nelements of clover-staggered $b$-light weak currents, as well as further HISQ\ncalculations of the hadronic vacuum polarisation. We also compare the approach\nto the (same) continuum limit in clover and HISQ formalisms for the mass and\ndecay constant of the $\\phi$ meson. Our final results for these parameters,\nusing single-meson correlators and neglecting quark-line disconnected diagrams\nare: $m_{\\phi} =$ 1.023(5) GeV and $f_{\\phi} = $ 0.238(3) GeV in good agreement\nwith experiment. The results come from calculations in the HISQ formalism using\ngluon fields that include the effect of $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea\nwith three lattice spacing values and $m_{u/d}$ values going down to the\nphysical point.\n", "  We present the ${\\mathscr P}(\\varphi)_2$ model on de Sitter space in the\ncanonical formulation. We discuss the role of the Noether theorem and we\nprovide explicit expressions for the energy-stress tensor of the interacting\nmodel.\n", "  We use first-principles Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations to study the\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between hydrogen adatoms\nattached to a graphene sheet. We find that the pairwise RKKY interactions at\ndistances of a few lattice spacings are strongly affected by inter-electron\ninteractions, in particular, the potential barrier between widely separated\nadatoms and the dimer configuration becomes wider and thus harder to penetrate.\nWe also point out that anti-ferrromagnetic and charge density wave orderings\nhave very different effects on the RKKY interaction. Finally, we analyze the\nstability of several regular adatom superlattices with respect to small\ndisplacements of a single adatom, distinguishing the cases of adatoms which\npopulate either both or only one sublattice of the graphene lattice.\n", "  Octahedral tilting is most common distortion process observed in\ncentrosymmetric perovskite compounds (ABO$_{3}$). Indeed, crucial physical\nproperties of this oxide stem from the tilts of BO$_{6}$ rigid octahedra. In\nmicrowave ceramics with perovskite-type structure, there is a close relation\nbetween the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency and tilt system of\nthe perovskite structure. However, in many cases, limited access facilities are\nneeded to assign correctly the space group, including neutron scattering and\ntransmission electron microscopy. Here, we combine the Raman scattering and\ngroup-theory calculations to probe the structural distortion in the perovskite\n(Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$)$_{3}$CaNb$_{2}$O$_{9}$ solid solution, which exhibits a\nstructural phase transition at $x$ $\\geq$ 0.7, from D$_{3d}^{3}$ trigonal to\nC$_{2h}^{3}$ monoclinic cell. Both phases are related by an octahedral tilting\ndistortion ($a^{0}b^{-}b^{-}$ in Glazer notation). Low temperature Raman\nspectra corroborate the group-theoretical predictions for\nSr$_{3}$CaNb$_{2}$O$_{9}$ compound, since 36 modes detected at 25 K agree well\nwith those 42 (25A$_{g}$ $\\oplus$ 17B$_{g}$) predicted ones.\n", "  An extended analysis of the key role of direct interactions, i.e., breakup,\nstripping and pick-up processes, has been carried out for deuteron-induced\nreactions. Particular comments concern the deuteron breakup which is the\ndominant mechanism involved in surrogate reactions on heavy nuclei, around the\nCoulomb barrier.\n", "  Haynes et al. (1977) derived a nonlinear differential equation to determine\nthe spread of innovations within a social network across space and time. This\nmodel depends upon the imitators and the innovators within the social system,\nwhere the imitators respond to internal influences, whilst the innovators react\nto external factors. Here, this differential equation is applied to simulate\nthe uptake of a low-carbon technology (LCT) within a local electricity network\nsituated in the UK. This network comprises of many households that are assigned\nto certain feeders. Firstly, travelling wave solutions of Haynes' model are\nused to predict adoption times as a function of the imitation and innovation\ninfluences. Then, the grid that represents the electricity network is created\nso that the finite element method (FEM) can be implemented. Next, innovation\ndiffusion is modelled with Haynes' equation and the FEM, where varying\nmagnitudes of the internal and external pressures are imposed. Consequently,\nthe impact of these model parameters is examined. Moreover, LCT adoption\ntrajectories at fixed feeder locations are calculated, which give a macroscopic\nunderstanding of the uptake behaviour at specific network sites. Lastly, the\nadoption of LCTs at a household level is discussed.\n", "  In this paper we discuss how the information contained in atomistic\nsimulations of homogeneous nucleation should be used when fitting the\nparameters in macroscopic nucleation models. We show how the number of solid\nand liquid atoms in such simulations can be determined unambiguously by using a\nGibbs dividing surface and how the free energy as a function of the number of\nsolid atoms in the nucleus can thus be extracted. We then show that the\nparameters of a model based on classical nucleation theory can be fit using the\ninformation contained in these free-energy profiles but that the parameters in\nsuch models are highly correlated. This correlation is unfortunate as it\nensures that small errors in the computed free energy surface can give rise to\nlarge errors in the extrapolated properties of the fitted model. To resolve\nthis problem we thus propose a method for fitting macroscopic nucleation models\nthat uses simulations of planar interfaces and simulations of three-dimensional\nnuclei in tandem. We show that when the parameters of the macroscopic model are\nfitted in this way the numerical errors for the final fitted model are smaller\nand that the extrapolated predictions for large nuclei are thus more reliable.\n", "  Coupling between a crystal of di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium\nradicals and a superconducting microwave resonator is investigated in a circuit\nquantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) architecture. The crystal exhibits\nparamagnetic behavior above 4~K, with antiferromagnetic correlations appearing\nbelow this temperature, and we demonstrate strong coupling at base temperature.\nThe magnetic resonance acquires a field angle dependence as the crystal is\ncooled down, indicating anisotropy of the exchange interactions. These results\nshow that multispin modes in organic crystals are suitable for circuit QED,\noffering a platform for their coherent manipulation. They also utilize the\ncircuit QED architecture as a way to probe spin correlations at low\ntemperature.\n", "  Molecular clouds are to a great extent influenced by turbulent motions in the\ngas. Numerical and observational studies indicate that the star formation rate\nand efficiency crucially depend on the mixture of solenoidal and compressive\nmodes in the turbulent acceleration field, which can be quantified by the\nturbulent driving parameter b. For purely solenoidal (divergence-free) driving\nprevious studies showed that b=1/3 and for entirely compressive (curl-free)\ndriving b=1. In this study, we determine the evolution of the turbulent driving\nparameter b in magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation\nand evolution. The clouds form due to the convergence of two flows of warm\nneutral gas. We explore different scenarios by varying the magnitude of the\ninitial turbulent perturbations in the flows. We show that the driving mode of\nthe turbulence within the cloud strongly fluctuates with time and exhibits no\nclear correlation with typical cloud properties, such as the cloud mass and the\n(Alfven) Mach number. We specifically find that $b$ strongly varies from b=0.3\nto b=0.8 on timescales t<5 Myr, where the timescale and range of variation can\nchange from cloud to cloud. This rapid change of b from solenoidal to\ncompressive driving is primarily associated with global contraction of the\ncloud and subsequent onset of star formation. We conclude that the effective\nturbulence driving parameter should be treated as a free parameter that can\nvary from solenoidal to compressive in both time and space.\n", "  We present a numerical spectral method to solve systems of differential\nequations on an infinite interval $y\\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ in presence of\nlinear differential operators of the form $Q(y)\n\\left(\\partial/\\partial_y\\right)^b$ (where $Q(y)$ is a rational fraction and\n$b$ a positive integer). Even when these operators are not parity-preserving,\nwe demonstrate how a mixed expansion in interleaved Chebyshev rational\nfunctions $TB_n(y)$ and $SB_n(y)$ preserves the sparsity of their\ndiscretization. This paves the way for fast $O(N\\ln N)$ and spectrally accurate\nmixed implicit-explicit time-marching of sets of linear and nonlinear equations\nin unbounded geometries.\n", "  We observe the breakup dynamics of an elongated cloud of condensed $^{85}$Rb\natoms placed in an optical waveguide. The number of localized spatial\ncomponents observed in the breakup is compared with the number of solitons\npredicted by a plane-wave stability analysis of the nonpolynomial nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, an effective one-dimensional approximation of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation for cigar-shaped condensates. It is shown that the\nnumbers predicted from the fastest growing sidebands are consistent with the\nexperimental data, suggesting that modulational instability is the key\nunderlying physical mechanism driving the breakup.\n", "  GaN is a key material for lighting technology. Yet, the carrier transport and\nultrafast dynamics that are central in GaN light emitting devices are not\ncompletely understood. We present first-principles calculations of carrier\ndynamics in GaN, focusing on electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering and the cooling\nand nanoscale dynamics of hot carriers. We find that e-ph scattering is\nsignificantly faster for holes compared to electrons, and that for hot carriers\nwith an initial 0.5$-$1 eV excess energy, holes take a significantly shorter\ntime ($\\sim$0.1 ps) to relax to the band edge compared to electrons, which take\n$\\sim$1 ps. The asymmetry in the hot carrier dynamics is shown to originate\nfrom the valence band degeneracy, the heavier effective mass of holes compared\nto electrons, and the details of the coupling to different phonon modes in the\nvalence and conduction bands. We show that the slow cooling of hot electrons\nand their long ballistic mean free paths (over 3 nm) are a possible cause of\nefficiency droop in GaN light emitting diodes. Taken together, our work sheds\nlight on the ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers in GaN and the nanoscale origin\nof efficiency droop.\n", "  In this paper, we study the non-projectable 2d Ho\\v{r}ava gravity coupled\nwith a non-relativistic scalar field, where the coupling is in general\nnon-minimal and of the form $f(\\phi)R$, where $f(\\phi)$ is an arbitrary\nfunction of the scalar field $\\phi$, and $R$ denotes the 2d Ricci scalar. In\nparticular, we first investigate the Hamiltonian structure, and show that there\nare two-first and two-second class constraints, similar to the pure gravity\ncase, but now the local degree of freedom is one, due to the presence of the\nscalar field. Then, we present various exact stationary solutions of this\ncoupled system, and find that some of them represent black holes but now with\nuniversal horizons as their boundaries. At these horizons, the Hawking\nradiations are thermal with temperatures proportional to their surface\ngravities, which normally depend on the non-linear dispersion relations of the\nparticles radiated, similar to the (3+1)-dimensional case.\n", "  In quantum mechanics it is often required to describe in a semiclassical\napproximation the motion of particles moving within a given energy band. Such a\nrepresentation leads to the appearance of an analogues of fictitious forces in\nthe semiclassical equations of motion associated with the Berry curvature. The\npurpose of this paper is to derive systematically the kinetic Boltzmann\nequations displaying these effects in the case that the band is degenerate, and\nas such the Berry curvature is non-Abelian. We use the formalism of phase-space\nquantum mechanics to derive the results.\n", "  We report measurements on yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films grown on both\ngadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) and yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) substrates,\nwith and without thin Pt top layers. We provide three principal results: the\nobservation of an interfacial region at the Pt/YIG interface, we place a limit\non the induced magnetism of the Pt layer and confirm the existence of an\ninterfacial layer at the GGG/YIG interface. Polarised neutron reflectometry\n(PNR) was used to give depth dependence of both the structure and magnetism of\nthese structures. We find that a thin film of YIG on GGG is best described by\nthree distinct layers: an interfacial layer near the GGG, around 5 nm thick and\nnon-magnetic, a magnetic bulk phase, and a non-magnetic and compositionally\ndistinct thin layer near the surface. We theorise that the bottom layer, which\nis independent of the film thickness, is caused by Gd diffusion. The top layer\nis likely to be extremely important in inverse spin Hall effect measurements,\nand is most likely Y2O3 or very similar. Magnetic sensitivity in the PNR to any\ninduced moment in the Pt is increased by the existence of the Y2O3 layer; any\nmoment is found to be less than 0.02 uB/atom.\n", "  The disjointed Fermi-arcs in Weyl semimetals can intertwine with chiral bulk\nmodes and participate in unusual closed magnetic orbits in the presence of a\nvertical magnetic field. Here we carry out the quantum oscillation study of\nsuch unusual Weyl magnetic orbits in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, a close cousin of\nWeyl semimetals. We find that extra two-dimensional (2D) quantum oscillations\nemerge at high field, which superimpose on 3D bulk background and can be\nattributed to the Weyl magnetic orbits, when the thickness of nanoplates is\nsmaller than the mean free path of the electrons. Further evidence of the 2D\nquantum oscillations from the Weyl magnetic orbits is provided by the nonlocal\ndetection, which demonstrates an alternative way to study the quantum transport\nproperties of Fermi-arcs under magnetic field.\n", "  A discrete analogue of the extended Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfeld (BPS) Skyrme\nmodel that admits time-dependent solutions is presented. Using the spacing h of\nadjacent lattice nodes as a parameter, we identify the spatial profile of the\nsolution and the continuation of the relevant branch of solutions over the\nlattice spacing for different values of the potential (free) parameter\n{\\alpha}. In particular, we explore the dynamics and stability of the obtained\nsolutions, finding that, while they generally seem to be prone to\ninstabilities, for suitable values of the lattice spacing and for sufficiently\nlarge value of {\\alpha}, they may be long-lived in direct numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Eddy current flow meters (ECFM) are widely used for measuring the flow\nvelocity of electrically conducting fluids. Since the flow induced\nperturbations of a magnetic field depend both on the geometry and the\nconductivity of the fluid, extensive calibration is needed to get accurate\nresults. Transient eddy current flow metering (TECFM) has been developed to\novercome this problem. It relies on tracking the position of an impressed eddy\ncurrent system which is moving with the same velocity as the conductive fluid.\nWe present an immersed version of this measurement technique and demonstrate\nits viability by numerical simulations and a first experimental validation.\n", "  We study confinement-deconfinement phase transition in a holographic\nsoft-wall QCD model. By solving the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar system\nanalytically, we obtain the phase structure of the black hole backgrounds. We\nthen impose probe open strings in such background to investigate the\nconfinement-deconfinement phase transition from different open string\nconfigurations under various temperatures and chemical potentials. Furthermore,\nwe study the Wilson loop by calculating the minimal surface of the probing open\nstring world-sheet and obtain the Cornell potential in confinement phase\nanalytically.\n", "  Over the past years, experiments accumulated intriguing hints for new physics\n(NP) in flavor observables, namely in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\n($a_\\mu$), in $R(D^{(*)})={\\rm Br}(B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu)/{\\rm Br}(B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\ell\\nu)$ and in $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ transitions, which are all at the\n$3-4\\,\\sigma$ level. In this article we point out that one can explain the\n$R(D^{(*)})$ anomaly using two scalar leptoquarks (LQs) with the same mass and\ncoupling to fermions related via a discrete symmetry: an $SU(2)$ singlet and an\n$SU(2)$ triplet, both with hypercharge $Y=-2/3$. In this way, potentially\ndangerous contributions to $b\\to s\\nu\\nu$ are avoided and non-CKM suppressed\neffects in $R(D^{(*)})$ can be generated. This allows for smaller overall\ncouplings to fermions weakening the direct LHC bounds. In our model,\n$R(D^{(*)})$ is directly correlated to $b\\to s\\tau^+\\tau^-$ transitions where\nan enhancement by orders of magnitude compared to the standard model (SM) is\npredicted, such that these decay modes are in the reach of LHCb and BELLE II.\nFurthermore, one can also naturally explain the $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomalies\n(including $R(K)$) by a $C_9=-C_{10}$ like contribution without spoiling\n$\\mu-e$ universality in charged current decays. In this case sizable effects in\n$b\\to s\\tau\\mu$ transitions are predicted which are again well within the\nexperimental reach. One can even address the longstanding anomaly in $a_\\mu$,\ngenerating a sizable decay rate for $\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$. However, we find that\nout of the three anomalies $R(D^{(*)})$, $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $a_{\\mu}$ only\ntwo (but any two) can be explained simultaneously.\n", "  We consider fixed points of steady solutions and flow directions using the\nboson Boltzmann equation that is a one-dimensionally reduced kinetic equation\nafter the angular integration. With an elastic collision integral of the\ntwo-to-two scattering process, in the dense (dilute) regime where the\ndistribution function is large (small), the boson Boltzmann equation has\napproximate fixed points with a power-law spectrum in addition to the thermal\ndistribution function. We argue that the power-law fixed point can be exact in\nspecial cases. We elaborate a graphical presentation to display evolving flow\ndirections similarly to the renormalization group flow, which explicitly\nexhibits how fixed points are connected and parameter space is separated by\ncritical lines. We discuss that such a flow diagram contains useful information\non thermalization processes out of equilibrium.\n", "  We revisit the question of whether and how the steady states arising after\nnon-equilibrium time evolution in integrable models (and in particular in the\nXXZ spin chain) can be described by the so-called Generalized Gibbs Ensemble\n(GGE). It is known that the micro-canonical ensemble built on a complete set of\ncharges correctly describes the long-time limit of local observables, and\nrecently a canonical ensemble was built by Ilievski et. al. using particle\noccupation number operators. Here we provide an alternative construction by\nconsidering truncated GGE's (tGGE's) that only include a finite number of well\nlocalized conserved operators. It is shown that the tGGE's can approximate the\nsteady states with arbitrary precision, i.e. all physical observables are\nexactly reproduced in the infinite truncation limit. In addition, we show that\na complete canonical ensemble can in fact be built in terms of a new (discrete)\nset of charges built as linear combinations of the standard ones.\n  Our general arguments are applied to concrete quench situations in the XXZ\nchain, where the initial states are simple two-site or four-site product\nstates. Depending on the quench we find that numerical results for the local\ncorrelators can be obtained with remarkable precision using truncated GGE's\nwith only 10-100 charges.\n", "  Ambiguous measurements do not reveal complete information about the system\nunder test. Their quantum-mechanical counterparts are semi-weak (or in the\nlimit, weak-) measurements and here we discuss their role in tests of the\nLeggett-Garg inequalities. We show that, whilst ambiguous measurements allow\none to forgo the usual non-invasive measureability assumption, to derive an LGI\nthat may be violated, we are forced to introduce another assumption that\nequates the invasive influence of ambiguous and unambiguous detectors. Based on\nthis assumption, we derive signalling conditions that should be fulfilled for\nthe plausibility of the Leggett-Garg test. We then propose an experiment on a\nthree-level system with a direct quantum-optics realisation that satisfies all\nsignalling constraints and violates a Leggett-Garg inequality.\n", "  We investigate the photoluminescence of interlayer excitons in\nheterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2 at low temperatures.\nSurprisingly, we find a doublet structure for such interlayer excitons. Both\npeaks exhibit long photoluminescence lifetimes of several ten nanoseconds up to\n100 ns at low temperatures, which verifies the interlayer nature of both. The\npeak energy and linewidth of both show unusual temperature and power\ndependences. In particular, we observe a blue-shift of their emission energy\nfor increasing excitation powers. At a low excitation power and low\ntemperatures, the energetically higher peak shows several spikes. We explain\nthe findings by two sorts of interlayer excitons; one that is indirect in real\nspace but direct in reciprocal space, and the other one being indirect in both\nspaces. Our results provide fundamental insights into long-lived interlayer\nstates in van der Waals heterostructures with possible bosonic many-body\ninteractions\n", "  The Sagnac effect has been shown in inertial frames as well as rotating\nframes. We solve the problem of the generalized Sagnac effect in the standard\nsynchronization of clocks. The speed of a light beam that traverses an optical\nfiber loop is measured with respect to the proper time of the light detector,\nand is shown to be other than the constant c, though it appears to be c if\nmeasured by the time standard-synchronized. The fiber loop, which can have an\narbitrary shape, is described by an infinite number of straight lines such that\nit can be handled by the general framework of Mansouri and Sexl (MS). For a\ncomplete analysis of the Sagnac effect, the motion of the laboratory should be\ntaken into account. The MS framework is introduced to deal with its motion\nrelative to a preferred reference frame. Though the one-way speed of light is\nother than c, its two-way speed is shown to be c with respect to the proper\ntime. The theoretical analysis of the generalized Sagnac effect corresponds to\nthe experimental results, and shows the usefulness of the standard\nsynchronization. The introduction of the standard synchrony can make\nmathematical manipulation easy and can allow us to deal with relative motions\nbetween inertial frames without information on their velocities relative to the\npreferred frame.\n", "  We have constructed the database of stars in the local group using the\nextended version of the SAGA (Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology)\ndatabase that contains stars in 24 dwarf spheroidal galaxies and ultra faint\ndwarfs. The new version of the database includes more than 4500 stars in the\nMilky Way, by removing the previous metallicity criterion of [Fe/H] <= -2.5,\nand more than 6000 stars in the local group galaxies. We examined a validity of\nusing a combined data set for elemental abundances. We also checked a\nconsistency between the derived distances to individual stars and those to\ngalaxies in the literature values. Using the updated database, the\ncharacteristics of stars in dwarf galaxies are discussed. Our statistical\nanalyses of alpha-element abundances show that the change of the slope of the\n[alpha/Fe] relative to [Fe/H] (so-called \"knee\") occurs at [Fe/H] = -1.0+-0.1\nfor the Milky Way. The knee positions for selected galaxies are derived by\napplying the same method. Star formation history of individual galaxies are\nexplored using the slope of the cumulative metallicity distribution function.\nRadial gradients along the four directions are inspected in six galaxies where\nwe find no direction dependence of metallicity gradients along the major and\nminor axes. The compilation of all the available data shows a lack of CEMP-s\npopulation in dwarf galaxies, while there may be some CEMP-no stars at [Fe/H]\n<~ -3 even in the very small sample. The inspection of the relationship between\nEu and Ba abundances confirms an anomalously Ba-rich population in Fornax,\nwhich indicates a pre-enrichment of interstellar gas with r-process elements.\nWe do not find any evidence of anti-correlations in O-Na and Mg-Al abundances,\nwhich characterises the abundance trends in the Galactic globular clusters.\n", "  Adiabatic potential energy curves of the $^1\\Sigma^+$ and $^1\\Pi$ states of\nthe LiH molecule have been calculated. They correlate asymptotically to atomic\nstates, like 2s+1s, 2p+1s, 3s+1s, 3p+1s, 3d+1s, 4s+1s, 4p+1s and 4d+1s. Very\ngood agreement is found between our calculated spectroscopic parameters and\nexperimental ones. The dynamics of the rotational predissociation process of\nthe $1^1\\Pi$ state has been studied by solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The classical experiment of Velasco [Can. J. Phys.\n{35}, 1204 (1957)] on dissociation in the $1^1\\Pi$ state is explained in\ndetail.\n", "  A new method for compiling quantum algorithms is proposed and tested for a\nthree qubit system. The proposed method is to decompose a a unitary matrix U,\ninto a product of simpler U j via a neural network. These U j can then be\ndecomposed into product of known quantum gates. Key to the effectiveness of\nthis approach is the restriction of the set of training data generated to paths\nwhich approximate minimal normal subRiemannian geodesics, as this removes\nunnecessary redundancy and ensures the products are unique. The two neural\nnetworks are shown to work effectively, each individually returning low loss\nvalues on validation data after relatively short training periods. The two\nnetworks are able to return coefficients that are sufficiently close to the\ntrue coefficient values to validate this method as an approach for generating\nquantum circuits. There is scope for more work in scaling this approach to\nlarger quantum systems.\n", "  The minimal seesaw scenario can radiatively generate the Higgs potential to\ninduce electroweak symmetry breaking while supplying an origin of the Higgs\nvacuum expectation value from an underlying Majorana scale. If the Higgs\npotential and (derived) electroweak scale have this origin, the heavy $\\rm\nSU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)_Y$ singlet states are expected to reside at $m_N\n\\sim 10-500 \\, {\\rm PeV} $ for couplings $|\\omega| \\sim 10^{-4.5}-10^{-6}$\nbetween the Majorana sector and the Standard Model. In this framework, the\nchallenge of the electroweak scale hierarchy problem is replaced with a need to\ngenerate or accommodate PeV Majorana mass scales in ultraviolet models; the\nusual hierarchy problem is absent as the electroweak scale is not a fundamental\nscale.\n", "  We consider parallel splitting of a strip composed of two different chains.\nAs a waveguide, the dissimilar-chain structure radically differs from the\nwell-studied identical-chain system. It is characterized by three speeds of the\nlong waves, two for the separate chains, and one for the intact strip where the\nchains are connected. Accordingly, there exist three ranges, the subsonic for\nboth chains, the intersonic and the supersonic. The speed in the latter range\nis supersonic for the intact strip and at the same time, it is subsonic for the\nseparate higher-speed chain. This fact allows the splitting wave to propagate\nin the strip supersonically. We derive steady-state analytical solutions and\nfind that the splitting can propagate steadily only in two of these speed\nranges, the subsonic and the supersonic, whereas the intersonic regime is\nforbidden. In the case of considerable difference in the chain stiffness, the\nlowest dynamic threshold corresponds to the supersonic regime. The peculiarity\nof the supersonic mode is that the supersonic energy delivery channel, being\ninitially absent, is opening with the moving splitting point. Based on the\ndiscrete and related continuous models we find which regime can be implemented\ndepending on the structure parameters and loading conditions. The analysis\nallows us to represent the characteristics of such processes and to demonstrate\nstrengths and weaknesses of different formulations, quasi-static, dynamic,\ndiscrete or continuous. Analytical solutions for steady-state regimes are\nobtained and analyzed in detail. We find the force-speed relations and show the\ndifference between the static and dynamic thresholds. The parameters and energy\nof waves radiated by the propagating splitting are determined. We calculate the\nstrain distribution ahead of the transition point and check whether the\nsteady-state solutions are admissible.\n", "  We study theoretically the recombination within a pair of two polarons in\nmagnetic field subject to a strong linearly polarized ac drive. Strong drive\nimplies that the Zeeman frequencies of the pair-partners are much smaller than\nthe Rabi frequency, so that the rotating wave approximation does not apply.\nWhat makes the recombination dynamics nontrivial, is that the partners\nrecombine only when they form a singlet, S. By admixing singlet to triplets,\nthe drive induces the triplet recombination as well. We calculate the effective\ndecay rate of all four spin modes. Our main finding is that, under the strong\ndrive, the major contribution to the decay of the modes comes from short time\nintervals when the driving field passes through zero. When the recombination\ntime in the absence of drive is short, fast recombination from S leads to\nanomalously slow recombination from the other spin states of the pair. We show\nthat, with strong drive, this recombination becomes even slower. The\ncorresponding decay rate falls off as a power law with the amplitude of the\ndrive.\n", "  We present CheSS, the \"Chebyshev Sparse Solvers\" library, which has been\ndesigned to solve typical problems arising in large-scale electronic structure\ncalculations using localized basis sets. The library is based on a flexible and\nefficient expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and presently features\nthe calculation of the density matrix, the calculation of matrix powers for\narbitrary powers, and the extraction of eigenvalues in a selected interval.\nCheSS is able to exploit the sparsity of the matrices and scales linearly with\nrespect to the number of nonzero entries, making it well-suited for large-scale\ncalculations. The approach is particularly adapted for setups leading to small\nspectral widths of the involved matrices and outperforms alternative methods in\nthis regime. By coupling CheSS to the DFT code BigDFT, we show that such a\nfavorable setup is indeed possible in practice. In addition, the approach based\non Chebyshev polynomials can be massively parallelized, and CheSS exhibits\nexcellent scaling up to thousands of cores even for relatively small matrix\nsizes.\n", "  We explore trends in the morphology and line-of-sight (los) velocity of\nstellar populations in the inner regions of disc galaxies, using N-body\nsimulations with both a thin (kinematically cold) and a thick (kinematically\nhot) disc which form a bar and boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge. The bar in the thin\ndisc component is $\\sim$50\\% stronger than the thick disc bar and is more\nelongated, with an axis ratio almost half that of the thick disc bar. The thin\ndisc b/p bulge has a pronounced X-shape, while the thick disc b/p is weaker\nwith a rather boxy shape. This leads to the signature of the b/p bulge in the\nthick disc to be weaker and further away from the plane than in the thin disc.\nRegarding the kinematics, we find that the los velocity of thick disc stars in\nthe outer parts of the b/p bulge can be \\emph{larger} than that of thin disc\nstars, by up to 40\\% and 20\\% for side-on and Milky Way-like orientations of\nthe bar respectively. This is due to the different orbits followed by thin and\nthick disc stars in the bar-b/p region, which are affected by the fact that: i)\nthin disc stars are trapped more efficiently in the bar - b/p instability and\nthus lose more angular momentum than their thick disc counterparts and ii)\nthick disc stars have large radial excursions and therefore stars from large\nradii with high angular momenta can be found in the bar region. We also find\nthat the difference between the los velocities of the thin and thick disc in\nthe b/p bulge ($\\Delta v_{los}$) correlates with the initial difference between\nthe radial velocity dispersions of the two discs ($\\Delta \\sigma$) . We\ntherefore conclude that stars in the bar - b/p bulge will have considerably\ndifferent morphologies and kinematics depending on the kinematic properties of\nthe disc population they originate from.\n", "  In this paper, we numerically study the impact heavy field degrees of freedom\nhave on vacuum metastability in a toy model, with the aim of better\nunderstanding how the decoupling theorem extends to semiclassical processes. We\nobserve that decoupling applies to partial amplitudes associated with fixed\nfinal state field configurations emerging from the tunneling processes,\ncharacterized by a scale such as the inverse radius of a spherically symmetric\nbubble, and not directly on the total lifetime (as determined by the \"bounce\").\nMore specifically, tunneling amplitudes for bubbles with inverse radii smaller\nthan the scale of the heavier fields are largely insensitive to their presence,\nwhile those for bubbles with inverse radii larger than that scale may be\nsignificantly modified.\n", "  We demonstrate autoparametric excitation of two distinct sub-harmonic\nmechanical modes by the same driven mechanical mode corresponding to different\ndrive frequencies within its resonance dispersion band. This experimental\nobservation is used to motivate a more general physical picture wherein\nmultiple mechanical modes could be excited by the same driven primary mode\nwithin the same device as long as the frequency spacing between the\nsub-harmonic modes is less than half the dispersion bandwidth of the driven\nprimary mode. The excitation of both modes is seen to be threshold-dependent\nand a parametric back-action is observed impacting on the response of the\ndriven primary mode. Motivated by this experimental observation, modified\ndynamical equations specifying 2-mode auto-parametric excitation for such\nsystems are presented.\n", "  We conducted a 12-month monitoring campaign of 33 T Tauri stars (TTS) in\nTaurus. Our goal was to monitor objects that possess a disk but have a weak\nHalpha line, a common accretion tracer for young stars, to determine whether\nthey host a passive circumstellar disk. We used medium-resolution optical\nspectroscopy to assess the objects' accretion status and to measure the Halpha\nline. We found no convincing example of passive disks; only transition disk and\ndebris disk systems in our sample are non-accreting. Among accretors, we find\nno example of flickering accretion, leading to an upper limit of 2.2% on the\nduty cycle of accretion gaps assuming that all accreting TTS experience such\nevents. Combining literature results with our observations, we find that the\nreliability of traditional Halpha-based criteria to test for accretion is high\nbut imperfect, particularly for low-mass TTS. We find a significant correlation\nbetween stellar mass and the full width at 10 per cent of the peak (W10%) of\nthe Halpha line that does not seem to be related to variations in free-fall\nvelocity. Finally, our data reveal a positive correlation between the Halpha\nequivalent width and its W10%, indicative of a systematic modulation in the\nline profile whereby the high-velocity wings of the line are proportionally\nmore enhanced than its core when the line luminosity increases. We argue that\nthis supports the hypothesis that the mass accretion rate on the central star\nis correlated with the Halpha W10% through a common physical mechanism.\n", "  We convert a strongly interacting ultracold Bose gas into a mixture of atoms\nand molecules by sweeping the interactions from resonant to weak. By analyzing\nthe decay dynamics of the molecular gas, we show that in addition to Feshbach\ndimers it contains Efimov trimers. Typically around 8\\% of the total atomic\npopulation is bound into trimers, identified by their density-independent\nlifetime of about 100~$\\mu$s. The lifetime of the Feshbach dimers shows a\ndensity dependence due to inelastic atom-dimer collisions, in agreement with\ntheoretical calculations. We also vary the density of the gas across a factor\nof 250 and investigate the corresponding atom loss rate at the interaction\nresonance.\n", "  We apply the statistical methods by Schoenrich, Binney & Asplund to assess\nthe quality of distances and kinematics in the RAVE-TGAS and LAMOST-TGAS\nsamples of Solar neighbourhood stars. These methods yield a nominal distance\naccuracy of 1-2%. Other than common tests on parallax accuracy, they directly\ntest distance estimations including the effects of distance priors. We show how\nto construct these priors including the survey selection functions (SSFs)\ndirectly from the data. We demonstrate that neglecting the SSFs causes severe\ndistance biases. Due to the decline of the SSFs in distance, the simple\n1/parallax estimate only mildly underestimates distances. We test the accuracy\nof measured line-of-sight velocities (v_los) by binning the samples in the\nnominal v_los uncertainties. We find: a) the LAMOST v_los have a ~ -5 km/s\noffset; b) the average LAMOST measurement error for v_los is ~7 km/s,\nsignificantly smaller than, and nearly uncorrelated with the nominal LAMOST\nestimates. The RAVE sample shows either a moderate distance underestimate, or\nan unaccounted source of v_los dispersion (e_v) from measurement errors and\nbinary stars. For a subsample of suspected binary stars in RAVE, our methods\nindicate significant distance underestimates. Separating a sample in\nmetallicity or kinematics to select thick-disc/halo stars, discriminates\nbetween distance bias and e_v. For LAMOST, this separation yields consistency\nwith pure v_los measurement errors. We find an anomaly near longitude\nl~(300+/-60)deg and distance s~(0.32+/-0.03)kpc on both sides of the galactic\nplane, which could be explained by either a localised distance error or a\nbreathing mode.\n", "  In this work, we demonstrate the correspondence between first principle\ncalculations and experimental measurements of size effects on thermal transport\nin SiGe alloys. Transient thermal grating (TTG) is used to measure the\neffective thermal conductivity. The virtual crystal approximation under the\ndensity functional theory (DFT) framework combined with impurity scattering is\nused to determine the phonon properties for the exact alloy composition of the\nmeasured samples. With these properties, classical size effects are calculated\nfor the experimental geometry of reflection mode TTG using the\nrecently-developed variational solution to the phonon Boltzmann transport\nequation (BTE), which is verified against established Monte Carlo simulations.\nWe find agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements\nin the reduction of thermal conductivity (as much as $\\sim$ 25\\% of the bulk\nvalue) across grating periods spanning one order of magnitude. This work\nprovides a framework for the tabletop study of size effects on thermal\ntransport.\n", "  We show that the dynamics of particles in a one-dimensional harmonic trap\nwith hard-core interactions can be solvable for certain arrangements of unequal\nmasses. For any number of particles, there exist two families of unequal mass\nparticles that have integrable dynamics, and there are additional exceptional\ncases for three, four and five particles. The integrable mass families are\nclassified by Coxeter reflection groups and the corresponding solutions are\nBethe ansatz-like superpositions of hyperspherical harmonics in the relative\nhyperangular coordinates that are then restricted to sectors of fixed particle\norder. We also provide evidence for superintegrability of these Coxeter mass\nfamilies and conjecture maximal superintegrability.\n", "  We report on the first experimental observation of graphene optical emission\ninduced by the intense THz pulse. P-doped CVD graphene with the initial Fermi\nenergy of about 200 meV was used, optical photons was detected in the\nwavelength range of 340-600 nm. Emission started when THz field amplitude\nexceeded 100 kV/cm. For THz fields from 200 to 300 kV/cm the temperature of\noptical radiation was constant, while the number of emitted photons increased\nseveral dozen times. This fact clearly indicates multiplication of\nelectron-hole pairs induced by an external field itself and not due to electron\nheating. The experimental data are in a good agreement with the theory of\nLandau-Zener interband transitions. It is shown theoretically that Landau-Zener\ntransitions are possible even in the case of heavily doped graphene because the\nstrong THz field removes quasiparticles from the region of interband\ntransitions during several femtoseconds, which cancels the Pauli blocking\neffect.\n", "  Identifying the mechanism by which high energy Lyman continuum (LyC) photons\nescaped from early galaxies is one of the most pressing questions in cosmic\nevolution. Haro 11 is the best known local LyC leaking galaxy, providing an\nimportant opportunity to test our understanding of LyC escape. The observed LyC\nemission in this galaxy presumably originates from one of the three bright,\nphotoionizing knots known as A, B, and C. It is known that Knot C has strong\nLy$\\alpha$ emission, and Knot B hosts an unusually bright ultraluminous X-ray\nsource, which may be a low-luminosity AGN. To clarify the LyC source, we carry\nout ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) by obtaining narrow-band imaging from\nthe Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS cameras to construct spatially resolved\nratio maps of [OIII]/[OII] emission from the galaxy. IPM traces the ionization\nstructure of the interstellar medium and allows us to identify optically thin\nregions. To optimize the continuum subtraction, we introduce a new method for\ndetermining the best continuum scale factor derived from the mode of the\ncontinuum-subtracted, image flux distribution. We find no conclusive evidence\nof LyC escape from Knots B or C, but instead, we identify a high-ionization\nregion extending over at least 1 kpc from Knot A. Knot A shows evidence of an\nextremely young age ($\\lesssim 1$ Myr), perhaps containing very massive stars\n($>100$ M$_\\odot$). It is weak in Ly$\\alpha$, so if it is confirmed as the LyC\nsource, our results imply that LyC emission may be independent of Ly$\\alpha$\nemission.\n", "  The one step fermionic ladder refers to two parallel Luttinger Liquids (poles\nof the ladder) placed such that there is a finite probability of electrons\nhopping between the two poles at a pair of opposing points along each of the\npoles. The many-body Green function for such a system is calculated in presence\nof forward scattering interactions using the powerful non-chiral bosonization\ntechnique (NCBT). This technique is based on a non-standard harmonic analysis\nof the rapidly varying parts of the density fields appropriate for the study of\nstrongly inhomogeneous ladder systems. The closed analytical expression for the\ncorrelation function obtained from NCBT is nothing but the series involving the\nRPA (Random Phase Approximation) diagrams in powers of the forward scattering\ncoupling strength resummed to include only the most singular terms with the\nsource of inhomogeneities treated exactly. Finally the correlation functions\nare used to study physical phenomena such as Friedel oscillations and the\nconductance of such systems with the potential difference applied across\nvarious ends.\n", "  Magnetic properties of a single vacancy in graphene is a relevant and still\nunsolved problem. The experimental results point to a clearly detectable\nmagnetic defect state at the Fermi energy, while several calculations based on\ndensity functional theory (DFT) yield widely varying results for the magnetic\nmoment, in the range of $\\mu=1.04-2.0$ $\\mu_{B}$. We present a multi-tool\n\\textit{ab initio} theoretical study of the same defect, using two simulation\nprotocols for a defect in a crystal (cluster and periodic boundary conditions)\nand different DFT functionals - bare and hybrid DFT, mixing a fraction of exact\nHartree-Fock exchange (XC). Our main conclusions are two-fold: First, we find\nthat due to the $\\pi$-character of the Fermi-energy states of graphene,\ninclusion of XC is crucial and for a single isolated vacancy we can predict an\ninteger magnetic moment $\\mu=2\\mu_{B}$. Second, we find that due to the\nspecific symmetry of the graphene lattice, periodic arrays of single vacancies\nmay provide interesting diffuse spin-spin interactions.\n", "  Aims. This paper investigates the chaotic rotation of an oblate satellite in\nthe context of chaos control. Methods. A model of planar oscillations,\ndescribed with the Beletskii equation, was investigated. The Hamiltonian\nformalism was utilized to employ a control method for suppressing chaos.\nResults. An additive control term, which is an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe potential, is constructed. This allows not only for significantly\ndiminished diffusion of the trajectory in the phase space, but turns the purely\nchaotic motion into strictly periodic motion.\n", "  The Einstein-First project aims to change the paradigm of school science\nteaching through the introduction of modern Einsteinian concepts of space and\ntime, gravity and quanta at an early age. These concepts are rarely taught to\nschool students despite their central importance to modern science and\ntechnology. The key to implementing the Einstein-First curriculum is the\ndevelopment of appropriate models and analogies. This paper is the first part\nof a three-paper series. It presents the conceptual foundation of our approach,\nbased on simple physical models and analogies, followed by a detailed\ndescription of the models and analogies used to teach concepts of general and\nspecial relativity. Two accompanying papers address the teaching of quantum\nphysics (Part 2) and research outcomes (Part 3).\n", "  Building on our earlier work (Proesmans et. al., Phys.~Rev.~X \\textbf{6}\n(2016), 041010), we introduce the underdamped Brownian duet as a prototype\nmodel of a dissipative system or of a work-to-work engine. Several recent\nadvances from the theory of stochastic thermodynamics are illustrated with\nexplicit analytic calculations and corresponding Langevin simulations. In\nparticular, we discuss Onsager-Casimir symmetry, the trade-off relations\nbetween power, efficiency and dissipation, and stochastic efficiency.\n", "  We study tetraquark resonances with lattice QCD potentials computed for a\nstatic bbar bbar pair in the presence of two lighter quarks u d, the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation and the emergent wave method. As a proof of\nconcept we focus on the system with isospin I = 0, but consider different\nrelative angular momenta l of the heavy quarks bbar bbar. For l=0 a bound state\nhas already been predicted with quantum numbers I(JP) = 0(1+). Exploring\nvarious angular momenta we now compute the phase shifts and search for S and T\nmatrix poles in the second Riemann sheet. We predict a tetraquark resonance for\nl =1, decaying into two B mesons, with quantum numbers I(JP) = 0(1-), mass m =\n10 \\, 576^{+4}_{-4} MeV} and decay width Gamma = 112^{+90}_{-103} MeV.\n", "  Quantum functional inequalities (e.g. the logarithmic Sobolev- and Poincar\\'e\ninequalities) have found widespread application in the study of the behavior of\nprimitive quantum Markov semigroups. The classical counterparts of these\ninequalities are related to each other via a so-called transportation cost\ninequality of order 2 (TC2). The latter inequality relies on the notion of a\nmetric on the set of probability distributions called the Wasserstein distance\nof order 2. (TC2) in turn implies a transportation cost inequality of order 1\n(TC1). In this paper, we introduce quantum generalizations of the inequalities\n(TC1) and (TC2), making use of appropriate quantum versions of the Wasserstein\ndistances, one recently defined by Carlen and Maas and the other defined by us.\nWe establish that these inequalities are related to each other, and to the\nquantum modified logarithmic Sobolev- and Poincar\\'e inequalities, as in the\nclassical case. We also show that these inequalities imply certain\nconcentration-type results for the invariant state of the underlying semigroup.\nWe consider the example of the depolarizing semigroup to derive concentration\ninequalities for any finite dimensional full-rank quantum state. These\ninequalities are then applied to derive upper bounds on the error probabilities\noccurring in the setting of finite blocklength quantum parameter estimation.\n", "  Understanding what determines the strength of MHD turbulence in accretion\ndiscs is a question of fundamental theoretical and observational importance. In\nthis work we investigate whether the dependence of the turbulent accretion disc\nstress ($\\alpha$) on the magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) is sufficiently sensitive\nto induce thermal-viscous instability using 3D MHD simulations. We first\ninvestigate whether the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence, found by many previous authors,\nhas a physical or numerical origin by conducting a suite of local shearing-box\nsimulations. We find that a definite $\\alpha$-Pm dependence persists when\nsimultaneously increasing numerical resolution and decreasing the absolute\nvalues of both the viscous and resistive dissipation coefficients. This points\nto a physical origin of the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence. Using a further set of\nsimulations which include realistic turbulent heating and radiative cooling,\nand by giving Pm a realistic physical dependence on the plasma temperature and\ndensity, we demonstrate that the $\\alpha$-Pm dependence is sufficiently strong\nto lead to a local instability. We confirm that the instability manifests\nitself as an unstable limit cycle by mapping the local thermal-equilibrium\ncurve of the disc. This is the first self-consistent MHD simulation\ndemonstrating the Pm instability from first principles. This result is\nimportant because a physical Pm instability would lead to the global\npropagation of heating and cooling fronts and a transition between disc states\non timescales compatible with the observed hard/soft state transitions in black\nhole binaries.\n", "  For decades the primary experimental goal in studies of hadronic parity\nnonconservation (PNC) has been the isolation of the isovector weak\nnucleon-nucleon interaction, expected to be dominated by long-range pion\nexchange and enhanced by the neutral current. In meson-exchange descriptions\nthis interaction together with an isoscalar interaction generated by rho and\nomega exchange dominate most observables. Consequently these two amplitudes\nhave been used to compare and check the consistency of the field's experiments.\nYet to date, despite sensitive searches like that performed with 18F, no\nevidence for isovector hadronic PNC has been found. Here we argue, based on\nrecent large-Nc treatments and new global analyses, that the emphasis on\nisovector hadronic PNC was misplaced. Large-Nc provides an alternative and\ntheoretically better motivated simplification of effective field theories\n(EFTs) of hadronic PNC, separating the five low-energy constants (LECs) into\ntwo of leading order (LO), and three others that are NNLO. This scheme pivots\nthe isospin coordinates we have traditionally used, placing one dominant axis\nin the isoscalar plane, and a second along the isotensor direction. We show\nthat this large-Nc LEC hierarchy accurately describes all existing data on\nhadronic PNC, and we discuss opportunities to further test the predicted\nlarge-Nc hierarchy of LECs, illustrating the kind of analyses experimentalists\ncan use to better constrain the LO theory and to determine the size of NNLO\ncorrections.\n", "  We investigate the effect of varying the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and\ntoroidal equilibrium scale sheared flow on ion-scale turbulence in the outer\ncore of MAST by means of local gyrokinetic simulations. We show that nonlinear\nsimulations reproduce the experimental ion heat flux and that the\nexperimentally measured values of the ITG and the flow shear lie close to the\nturbulence threshold. We demonstrate that the system is subcritical in the\npresence of flow shear, i.e., the system is formally stable to small\nperturbations, but transitions to a turbulent state given a large enough\ninitial perturbation. We propose that the transition to subcritical turbulence\noccurs via an intermediate state dominated by low number of coherent long-lived\nstructures, close to threshold, which increase in number as the system is taken\naway from the threshold into the more strongly turbulent regime, until they\nfill the domain and a more conventional turbulence emerges. We show that the\nproperties of turbulence are effectively functions of the distance to\nthreshold, as quantified by the ion heat flux. We make quantitative comparisons\nof correlation lengths, times, and amplitudes between our simulations and\nexperimental measurements using the MAST BES diagnostic. We find reasonable\nagreement of the correlation properties, most notably of the correlation time,\nfor which significant discrepancies were found in previous numerical studies of\nMAST turbulence.\n", "  The hierarchical product of networks represents a natural tool for building\nlarge networks out of two smaller subnetworks: a primary subnetwork and a\nsecondary subnetwork. Here we study the dynamics of diffusion and\nsynchronization processes on hierarchical products. We apply techniques\npreviously used for approximating the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix to\nthe Laplacian matrix, allowing us to quantify the effects that the primary and\nsecondary subnetworks have on diffusion and synchronization in terms of a\ncoupling parameter that weighs the secondary subnetwork relative to the primary\nsubnetwork. Diffusion processes are separated into two regimes: for small\ncoupling the diffusion rate is determined by the structure of the secondary\nnetwork, scaling with the coupling parameter, while for large coupling it is\ndetermined by the primary network and saturates. Synchronization, on the other\nhand, is separated into three regimes: for both small and large coupling\nhierarchical products have poorly synchronization properties, but is optimized\nat an intermediate value. Moreover, the critical coupling value that optimizes\nsynchronization is shaped by the relative connectivities of the primary and\nsecondary subnetworks, compensating for significant differences between the two\nsubnetworks.\n", "  The aim of this work is to investigate feasibility of the ion beam analysis\ntechniques for monitoring swift heavy ion track formation. First, use of the in\nsitu Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy in channeling mode to observe\ndamage build-up in quartz SiO2 after MeV heavy ion irradiation is demonstrated.\nSecond, new results of the in situ grazing incidence time-of-flight elastic\nrecoil detection analysis used for monitoring the surface elemental composition\nduring ion tracks formation in various materials are presented. Ion tracks were\nfound on SrTiO3, quartz SiO2, a-SiO2 and muscovite mica surfaces by atomic\nforce microscopy, but in contrast to our previous studies on GaN and TiO2,\nsurface stoichiometry remained unchanged.\n", "  This paper shows that the oxygen vacancies observed experimentally in thin\nfilms of LaCoO3 subject to tensile strain are thermodynamically stable\naccording to ab initio calculations. By using DFT calculations, we show that\noxygen vacancies on the order of 6 % forming chains perpendicular to the (001)\ndirection are more stable than the stoichiometric solution. These lead to\nmagnetic Co2+ ions surrounding the vacancies that couple ferromagnetically. The\nremaining Co3+ cations in an octahedral environment are non magnetic. The gap\nleading to a ferromagnetic insulating phase occurs naturally and we provide a\nsimple ionic picture to explain the resulting electronic structure.\n", "  We determine the optical response of ultrathin film topological insulators in\nthe presence of a quantizing external magnetic field taking into account both\nhybridization between surface states, broken inversion symmetry and explicit\ntime reversal symmetry breaking by the magnetic field. We find that breaking of\ninversion symmetry in the system, which can be due to interaction with a\nsubstrate or electrical gating, results in Landau level crossings which lead to\nadditional optical transition channels that were previously forbidden. We show\nthat by tuning the hybridization and symmetry breaking parameters, a transition\nfrom the normal to a topological insulator phase occurs with measurable\nsignatures in both the longitudinal and optical Hall conductivity.\n", "  A 2.8-dB polarization squeezing of the Stokes operator S2 for the rubidium D1\nline (795 nm) is achieved, with the lowest squeezing band at an audio frequency\nof 2.6 kHz. Two methods are applied for improving the squeezing towards low\nfrequencies: an orthogonal-polarized locking beam that precludes residual\nunwanted interference and quantum noise locking method that stabilizes the\nrelative phase between the squeezed vacuum and the local oscillator. The\nsqueezing level is limited by absorption-induced losses at short wavelengths,\nhere is 397.5 nm. The generated polarization squeezed light can be used in a\nquantum enhanced magnetometer to increase the measurement sensitivity.\n", "  We compute molecular continuum orbitals in the single center expansion\nscheme. We then employ these orbitals to obtain molecular Auger rates and\nsingle-photon ionization cross sections to study the interaction of N2 with\nFree-Electron-Laser (FEL) pulses. The nuclei are kept fixed. We formulate rate\nequations for the energetically allowed molecular and atomic transitions and we\naccount for dissociation through additional terms in the rate equations.\nSolving these equations for different parameters of the FEL pulse, allows us to\nidentify the most efficient parameters of the FEL pulse for obtaining the\nhighest contribution of double core hole states (DCH) in the final atomic ion\nfragments. Finally we identify the contribution of DCH states in the electron\nspectra and show that the DCH state contribution is more easily identified in\nthe photo-ionization rather than the Auger transitions.\n", "  A metamaterial made by stacked hole-array layers known as a fishnet\nmetamaterial behaves as a hyperbolic metamaterial at wavelength much longer\nthan hole-array period. However, the analytical formulae of effective\nparameters of a fishnet metamaterial have not been reported hindering the\ndesign of deep-subwavelength imaging devices using this structure. We report\nthe new closed-form formulae of effective parameters comprising anisotropic\ndispersion relation of a fishnet metamaterial working at terahertz or microwave\nfrequency. These effective parameters of a fishnet metamaterial are consistent\nwith those obtained by quasi-full solutions using known effective parameters of\na hole-array layer working at frequency below its spoof plasma frequency with\nthe superlattice period much smaller than the hole-array period. We also\ntheoretically demonstrate the deep-subwavelength focusing at {\\lambda}/83 using\nthe composite structure of a slit-array layer and a fishnet metamaterial. It is\nfound that the focused intensity inside a fishnet metamaterial is several times\nlarger than that without the fishnet metamaterial, but the transmitted\nintensity is still restricted by large-wavevector difference in air and a\nfishnet metamaterial. Our effective parameters may aid the next-generation\ndeep-subwavelength imaging devices working at terahertz or microwave radiation.\n", "  almaBTE is a software package that solves the space- and time-dependent\nBoltzmann transport equation for phonons, using only ab-initio calculated\nquantities as inputs. The program can predictively tackle phonon transport in\nbulk crystals and alloys, thin films, superlattices, and multiscale structures\nwith size features in the nm-$\\mu$m range. Among many other quantities, the\nprogram can output thermal conductances and effective thermal conductivities,\nspace-resolved average temperature profiles, and heat-current distributions\nresolved in frequency and space. Its first-principles character makes almaBTE\nespecially well suited to investigate novel materials and structures. This\narticle gives an overview of the program structure and presents illustrative\nexamples for some of its uses.\n", "  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging technology most commonly\napplied to brackish water desalination. In CDI, salt ions are removed from the\nfeedwater and stored in electric double layers (EDLs) within micropores of\nelectrically charged porous carbon electrodes. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated that CDI electrodes exhibit selective ion removal based on ion\nsize, with the smaller ion being preferentially removed in the case of\nequal-valence ions. However, state-of-the-art CDI theory does not capture this\nobserved selectivity, as it assumes volume-less point ions in the micropore\nEDLs. We here present a theory which includes multiple couterionic species, and\nrelaxes the point ion assumption by incorporating ion volume exclusion\ninteractions into a description of the micropore EDLs. The developed model is a\ncoupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations which can be solved for micropore\nion concentrations and electrode Donnan potential at cell equilibrium. We\ndemonstrate that this model captures key features of the experimentally\nobserved size-based ion selectivity of CDI electrodes.\n", "  A common challenge in quantum information processing with photons is the\nlimited ability to manipulate and measure correlated states. An example is the\ninability to measure picosecond scale temporal correlations of a multi-photon\nstate, given state-of-the-art detectors have a temporal resolution of about 100\nps. Here, we demonstrate temporal magnification of time-bin entangled\ntwo-photon states using a time-lens, and measure their temporal correlation\nfunction which is otherwise not accessible because of the limited temporal\nresolution of single photon detectors. Furthermore, we show that the time-lens\nmaps temporal correlations of photons to frequency correlations and could be\nused to manipulate frequency-bin entangled photons. This demonstration opens a\nnew avenue to manipulate and analyze spectral and temporal wavefunctions of\nmany-photon states.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that Earth-like planets in the outer regions of\nthe habitable zone experience unstable climates, repeatedly cycling between\nglaciated and deglaciated climatic states (Menou 2015). While this result has\nbeen confirmed and also extended to explain early Mars climate records\n(Haqq-Misra et al. 2016; Batalha et al. 2016), all existing work relies on\nhighly idealized low-dimensional climate models. Here, we confirm that the\nphenomenology of climate cycles remains in 3D Earth climate models with\nconsiderably more degrees of freedom. To circumvent the computational barrier\nof integrating climate on Gyr timescales, we design a hybrid 0D-3D integrator\nwhich uses a general circulation model (GCM) as a short relaxation step along a\nlong evolutionary climate sequence. We find that GCM climate cycles are\nqualitatively consistent with reported low-dimensional results. This\nestablishes on a firmer ground the notion that outer habitable zone planets may\nbe preferentially found in transiently glaciated states.\n", "  We study the formation of dipolar excitons and their superfluidity in a black\nphosphorene double layer. The analytical expressions for the single dipolar\nexciton energy spectrum and wave function are obtained. It is predicted that a\nweakly interacting gas of dipolar excitons in a double layer of black\nphosphorus exhibits superfluidity due to the dipole-dipole repulsion between\nthe dipolar excitons. In calculations are employed the Keldysh and Coulomb\npotentials for the interaction between the charge carriers to analyze the\ninfluence of the screening effects on the studied phenomena. It is shown that\nthe critical velocity of superfluidity, the spectrum of collective excitations,\nconcentrations of the superfluid and normal component, and mean field critical\ntemperature for superfluidity are anisotropic and demonstrate the dependence on\nthe direction of motion of dipolar excitons. The critical temperature for\nsuperfluidity increases if the exciton concentration and the interlayer\nseparation increase. It is shown that the dipolar exciton binding energy and\nmean field critical temperature for superfluidity are sensitive to the electron\nand hole effective masses. The proposed experiment to observe a directional\nsuperfluidity of excitons is addressed.\n", "  We present the fully general time-dependent multiconfiguration\nself-consistent-field method to describe the dynamics of a system consisting of\narbitrary different kinds and numbers of interacting fermions and bosons. The\ntotal wave function is expressed as a superposition of different configurations\nconstructed from time-dependent spin-orbitals prepared for each particle kind.\nWe derive equations of motion followed by configuration-interaction (CI)\ncoefficients and spin-orbitals for general, not restricted to full-CI,\nconfiguration spaces. The present method provides a flexible framework for the\nfirst-principles theoretical study of, e.g., correlated multielectron and\nmultinucleus quantum dynamics in general molecules induced by intense laser\nfields and attosecond light pulses.\n", "  We calculate the rate of thermal Schwinger pair production at arbitrary\ncoupling in weak external fields. Our calculations are valid independently of\nmany properties of the charged particles produced, in particular their spin and\nwhether they are electric or magnetic. Using the worldline formalism, we\ncalculate the logarithm of the rate to leading order in the weak external field\nand to all orders in virtual photon exchange, taking us beyond the perturbative\nexpansion about the leading order, weak coupling result.\n", "  An infinite chain of driven-dissipative condensate spins with uniform\nnearest-neighbor coherent coupling is solved analytically and investigated\nnumerically. Above a critical occupation threshold the condensates undergo\nspontaneous spin bifurcation (becoming magnetized) forming a binary chain of\nspin-up or spin-down states. Minimization of the bifurcation threshold\ndetermines the magnetic order as a function of the coupling strength. This\nallows control of multiple magnetic orders via adiabatic (slow ramping of)\npumping. In addition to ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic ordered states we\nshow the formation of a paired-spin ordered state $\\left|\\dots \\uparrow\n\\uparrow \\downarrow \\downarrow \\dots \\right. \\rangle$ as a consequence of the\nphase degree of freedom between condensates.\n", "  The temperature-induced structural and electronic transformation in VO$_2$\nbetween the monoclinic M1 and tetragonal rutile phases was studied by means of\n\\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics, based on density functional theory with\nHubbard correction (DFT+U). Analysis of the dynamical processes associated with\nthe structural transformation was carried out on the atomic scale by following\nthe time evolution of dimerization amplitudes of vanadium atom chains and the\ntwisting angle of vanadium dimers. The electronic transition was studied by\ntracing the changes in projected densities of states and their correlation with\nthe evolution of the structural transformation. Our results reveal a strong\ninterconnection between the structural and electronic transformations and show\nthat they take place on the same time scale.\n", "  We report a specially configured non-Hermitian optical microcavity, imposing\nspatially imbalanced gain-loss profile, to host an exclusively proposed next\nnearest neighbor resonances coupling scheme. Adopting scattering matrix\n(S-matrix) formalism, the effect of interplay between such proposed resonance\ninteractions and the incorporated non-Hermiticity in the microcavity is\nanalyzed drawing a special attention to the existence of hidden singularities,\nnamely exceptional points (EPs); where at least two coupled resonances\ncoalesce. We establish adiabatic flip-of-states phenomena of the coupled\nresonances in the complex frequency plane (k-plane) which is essentially an\noutcome of the fact that the respective EP is being encircled in system\nparameter plane. Encountering such multiple EPs, the robustness of\nflip-of-states phenomena have been analyzed via continuous tuning of coupling\nparameters along a special hidden singular line which connects all the EPs in\nthe cavity. Such a numerically devised cavity, incorporating the exclusive next\nneighbor coupling scheme, have been designed for the first time to study the\nunconventional optical phenomena in the vicinity of EPs.\n", "  If the electroweak sector of the standard model is described by classically\nconformal dynamics, the early Universe evolution can be substantially altered.\nIt is already known that---contrarily to the standard model case---a first\norder electroweak phase transition may occur. Here we show that, depending on\nthe model parameters, a dramatically different scenario may happen: A\nfirst-order, six massless quark QCD phase transition occurs first, which then\ntriggers the electroweak symmetry breaking. We derive the necessary conditions\nfor this dynamics to occur, using the specific example of the classically\nconformal B-L model. In particular, relatively light weakly coupled particles\nare predicted, with implications for collider searches. This scenario is also\npotentially rich in cosmological consequences, such as renewed possibilities\nfor electroweak baryogenesis, altered dark matter production, and gravitational\nwave production, as we briefly comment upon.\n", "  We present observations of two new hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae\n(SLSN-I), iPTF15esb and iPTF16bad, showing late-time H-alpha emission with line\nluminosities of (1-3)e+41 erg/s and velocity widths of (4000-6000) km/s.\nIncluding the previously published iPTF13ehe, this makes up a total of three\nsuch events to date. iPTF13ehe is one of the most luminous and the slowest\nevolving SLSNe-I, whereas the other two are less luminous and fast decliners.\nWe interpret this as a result of the ejecta running into a neutral H-shell\nlocated at a radius of ~ 1.0e+16cm. This implies that violent mass loss must\nhave occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short time\ninterval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly prior to the\ndeath of a massive star as a SLSN. And more importantly, helium is unlikely to\nbe completely stripped off the progenitor stars and could be present in the\nejecta. It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even though\nnon-thermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He atoms, may exist as\nsuggested by the O II absorption series in the early time spectra. At late\ntimes (+240d), our spectra appear to have intrinsically lower [O I]6300A\nluminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, possibly an indication of\nsmaller oxygen masses (<10-30Msun). The blue-shifted H-alpha emission relative\nto the hosts for all three events may be in tension with the binary star model\nproposed for iPTF13ehe. Finally, iPTF15esb has a peculiar light curve with\nthree peaks separated from one another by ~ 22 days. The LC undulation is\nhigher in bluer bands. One possible explanation is eject-CSM interaction.\n", "  We propose to realize (natural) NMSSM spectrum from deflected AMSB with new\nmessenger-matter interactions. With additional messenger-matter interactions\ninvolving ${\\bf 10}\\oplus{\\bf \\overline{10}}$ representation messengers, the\nmuon g-2 anomaly can be solved at $2\\sigma$ (or $3\\sigma$) level with the\ncorresponding gluino mass range $2.8~{\\rm TeV}<m_{\\tilde{g}}<5.4~ {\\rm TeV}$\n(or $2.6 ~{\\rm TeV}<m_{\\tilde{g}}<7.3~ {\\rm TeV}$). Besides, our scenario is\nfairly natural within which the involved fine tuning can be as low as 47. So,\nin the framework of AMSB-type scenarios, NMSSM can be advantageous in\nexplaining the muon g-2 anomaly in compare with MSSM.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis in frequency domain for\nvarious electromagnetic problems based on discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with\nan arbitrary 2-D triangular or 3-D tetrahedral mesh. We formulate the governing\nequations in terms of DEC for 3D and 2D inhomogeneous structures, and also show\nthat the charge continuity relation is naturally satisfied. Then we introduce\neffective signed dual volume to incorporate material information into Hodge\nstar operators and take into account the case when circumcenters fall outside\ntriangles or tetrahedrons, which may lead to negative dual volume without\nDelaunay triangulation. Then we demonstrate the implementation of various\nboundary conditions, including perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), perfect\nelectric conductor (PEC), Dirichlet, periodic, and absorbing boundary\nconditions (ABC) within this method. An excellent agreement is achieved through\nthe numerical calculation of several problems, including homogeneous\nwaveguides, microstructured fibers, photonic crystals, scattering by a 2-D PEC,\nand resonant cavities.\n", "  In previous work, we developed tools for quantifying the tidal distortion of\na black hole's event horizon due to an orbiting companion. These tools use\ntechniques which require large mass ratios (companion mass $\\mu$ much smaller\nthan black hole mass $M$), but can be used for arbitrary bound orbits, and for\nany black hole spin. We also showed how to visualize these distorted black\nholes by embedding their horizons in a global Euclidean 3-space,\n${\\mathbb{E}}^3$. Such visualizations illustrate interesting and important\ninformation about horizon dynamics. Unfortunately, we could not visualize black\nholes with spin parameter $a_* > \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866$: such holes cannot\nbe globally embedded into ${\\mathbb{E}}^3$. In this paper, we overcome this\ndifficulty by showing how to embed the horizons of tidally distorted Kerr black\nholes in a hyperbolic 3-space, ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$. We use black hole perturbation\ntheory to compute the Gaussian curvatures of tidally distorted event horizons,\nfrom which we build a two-dimensional metric of their distorted horizons. We\ndevelop a numerical method for embedding the tidally distorted horizons in\n${\\mathbb{H}}^3$. As an application, we give a sequence of embeddings into\n${\\mathbb{H}}^3$ of a tidally interacting black hole with spin $a_*=0.9999$. A\nsmall amplitude, high frequency oscillation seen in previous work shows up\nparticularly clearly in these embeddings.\n", "  We use public data from the CMS experiment to study the 2-prong substructure\nof jets. The CMS Open Data is based on 31.8/pb of 7 TeV proton-proton\ncollisions recorded at the Large Hadron Collider in 2010, yielding a sample of\n768,687 events containing a high-quality central jet with transverse momentum\nlarger than 85 GeV. Using CMS's particle flow reconstruction algorithm to\nobtain jet constituents, we extract the 2-prong substructure of the leading jet\nusing soft drop declustering. We find good agreement between results obtained\nfrom the CMS Open Data and those obtained from parton shower generators, and we\nalso compare to analytic jet substructure calculations performed to modified\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. Although the 2010 CMS Open Data does not include\nsimulated data to help estimate systematic uncertainties, we use track-only\nobservables to validate these substructure studies.\n", "  In this paper the optical gain mechanism in phototransistor detectors (PTDs)\nis explored in low light conditions. An analytical formula is derived for the\nphysical limit on the minimum number of detectable photons for the PTD. This\nformulation shows that the sensitivity of the PTD, regardless of its material\ncomposition, is related to the square root of the normalized total capacitance\nat the base layer. Since the base total capacitance is directly proportional to\nthe size of the PTD, the formulation shows the scaling effect on the\nsensitivity of the PTD. We used the extracted formula to study the sensitivity\nlimit of a typical InGaAs/InP heterojunction PTD. Modeling predicts that a PTD\nwith a nanoscale electronic area can reach to a single photon noise equivalent\npower even at room temperature. The proposed model can also be used to explore\nthe sensitivity and speed of the nanowire-based photodetectors. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study on the sensitivity of the\nPTD for low light detection.\n", "  The inner surface of superconducting cavities plays a crucial role to achieve\nhighest accelerating fields and low losses. The industrial fabrication of\ncavities for the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) HiGrade Research Project allowed for an\ninvestigation of this interplay. For the serial inspection of the inner\nsurface, the optical inspection robot OBACHT was constructed and to analyze the\nlarge amount of data, represented in the images of the inner surface, an image\nprocessing and analysis code was developed and new variables to describe the\ncavity surface were obtained. This quantitative analysis identified vendor\nspecific surface properties which allow to perform a quality control and\nassurance during the production. In addition, a strong negative correlation of\n$\\rho= -0.93$ with a significance of $6\\,\\sigma$ of the integrated grain\nboundary area $\\sum{\\mathrm{A}}$ versus the maximal achievable accelerating\nfield $\\mathrm{E_{acc,max}}$ has been found.\n", "  We study the relaxation dynamics of photo-carriers in the paramagnetic Mott\ninsulating phase of the half-filled two-band Hubbard model. Using\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory, we excite charge carriers across\nthe Mott gap by a short hopping modulation, and simulate the evolution of the\nphoto-doped population within the Hubbard bands. We observe an ultrafast\ncharge-carrier relaxation driven by emission of local spin excitations with an\ninverse relaxation time proportional to the Hund's coupling. The photo-doping\ngenerates additional side-bands in the spectral function, and for strong Hund's\ncoupling, the photo-doped population also splits into several resonances. The\ndynamics of the local many-body states reveals two effects, thermal blocking\nand kinetic freezing, which manifest themselves when the Hund's coupling\nbecomes of the order of the temperature or the bandwidth, respectively. These\neffects, which are absent in the single-band Hubbard model, should be relevant\nfor the interpretation of experiments on correlated materials with multiple\nactive orbitals. In particular, the features revealed in the non-equilibrium\nenergy distribution of the photo-carriers are experimentally accessible, and\nprovide information on the role of the Hund's coupling in these materials.\n", "  In this work, a second order smoothed particle hydrodynamics is derived for\nthe study of relativistic heavy ion collisions. The hydrodynamical equation of\nmotion is formulated in terms of the variational principle. In order to\ndescribe the fluid of high energy density but of low baryon density, the\nentropy is taken as the base quantity for the interpolation. The smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics algorithm employed in this study is of the second order,\nwhich guarantees better particle consistency. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nvariational principle preserves the translational invariance of the system, and\ntherefore improves the accuracy of the method. A brief discussion on the\npotential implications of the model in heavy ion physics is also presented.\n", "  In 1979 Fradkin and Shenker observed \\cite{Frad} that if one considers a\nYang-Mills theory fully Higgsed by virtue of scalar fields in the fundamental\nrepresentation of the ${\\rm SU}(N)$ gauge group there is no phase transition in\npassing from the Higgs regime (weak coupling) to the \"QCD confinement\" regime\nat strong coupling. The above two regimes are continuously connected. We\ncombine this observations with lessons from supersymmetric gauge theories which\nshow that the Higgs phase is continuously connected to what is called\n\"instead-of-confinement\" phase rather than the phase with quark confinement. In\nthe \"instead-of-confinement\" phase monopoles are confined and play a role of\n\"constituent\" quarks inside hadrons. In contrast, the Seiberg-Witten phase of\nquark confinement is not analytically connected to the Higgs phase.\n  We propose dedicated lattice studies of Yang-Mills theories with scalar\nquarks.\n", "  We investigate the relation between kinematic morphology, intrinsic colour\nand stellar mass of galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation. We calculate the intrinsic u-r colours and measure the fraction of\nkinetic energy invested in ordered corotation of 3562 galaxies at z=0 with\nstellar masses larger than $10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We perform a visual inspection\nof gri-composite images and find that our kinematic morphology correlates\nstrongly with visual morphology. EAGLE produces a galaxy population for which\nmorphology is tightly correlated with the location in the colour- mass diagram,\nwith the red sequence mostly populated by elliptical galaxies and the blue\ncloud by disc galaxies. Satellite galaxies are more likely to be on the red\nsequence than centrals, and for satellites the red sequence is morphologically\nmore diverse. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic\ncolour and morphology arises from galaxy formation models that reproduce the\nobserved galaxy mass function and sizes.\n", "  Investigating Friedel oscillations in ultracold gases would complement the\nstudies performed on solid state samples with scanning-tunneling microscopes.\nIn atomic quantum gases interactions and external potentials can be tuned\nfreely and the inherently slower dynamics allow to access non-equilibrium\ndynamics following a potential or interaction quench. Here, we examine how\nFriedel oscillations can be observed in current ultracold gas experiments under\nrealistic conditions. To this aim we numerically calculate the amplitude of the\nFriedel oscillations which a potential barrier provokes in a 1D Fermi gas and\ncompare it to the expected atomic and photonic shot noise in a density\nmeasurement. We find that to detect Friedel oscillations the signal from\nseveral thousand one-dimensional systems has to be averaged. However, as up to\n100 parallel one-dimensional systems can be prepared in a single run with\npresent experiments, averaging over about 100 images is sufficient.\n", "  Exotic nuclei, particularly those near the driplines, are at the core of one\nof the fundamental questions driving nuclear structure and astrophysics today:\nwhat are the limits of nuclear binding? Exotic nuclei play a critical role in\nboth informing theoretical models as well as in our understanding of the origin\nof the heavy elements. Our purpose is to refine existing mass models through\nthe training of an artificial neural network that will mitigate the large model\ndiscrepancies far away from stability. The basic paradigm of our two-pronged\napproach is an existing mass model that captures as much as possible of the\nunderlying physics followed by the implementation of a Bayesian Neural Network\n(BNN) refinement to account for the missing physics. Bayesian inference is\nemployed to determine the parameters of the neural network so that model\npredictions may be accompanied by theoretical uncertainties. Despite the\nundeniable quality of the mass models adopted in this work, we observe a\nsignificant improvement (of about 40%) after the BNN refinement is implemented.\nIndeed, in the specific case of the Duflo-Zuker mass formula, we find that the\nrms deviation relative to experiment is reduced from rms =0.503MeV to rms=0.286\nMeV. These newly refined mass tables are used to map the neutron drip lines (or\nrather \"drip bands\") and to study a few critical r-process nuclei. The BNN\napproach is highly successful in refining the predictions of existing mass\nmodels. In particular, the large discrepancy displayed by the original \"bare\"\nmodels in regions where experimental data is unavailable is considerably\nquenched after the BNN refinement. This lends credence to our approach and has\nmotivated us to publish refined mass tables that we trust will be helpful for\nfuture astrophysical applications.\n", "  Since perovskite solar cells have attracted a lot of attentions over the past\nyears, the enhancement of their optical absorption and current density are\namong the basic coming challenges. For this reason, first, we have studied\nstructural and optical properties of organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite\nCH3NH3PbI3 and the compounds doped by chlorine halogen CH3NH3PbI3-xClx in the\ncubic phase by using density functional theory (DFT). Then, we investigate the\nlight absorption efficiency and optical current density of the single-junction\nperovskite solar cell CH3NH3PbI3-xClx for the values (x=0,1,2,3) by utilizing\noptical constants (n,k) resulted from these calculations. The results suggest\nthat increasing the amount of chlorine in the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx compound leads an\nincrease in bandgap energy, as well as a decrease in lattice constants and\noptical properties like refractive index and extinction coefficient of the\nstructure. Also, the results obtained by simulation express that by taking\nadvantage of light trapping techniques of SiO2, a remarkable increase of light\nabsorption will be achieved to the magnitude of 83.13%, which is noticeable.\n", "  We give a proof of perturbative renormalizability of SU(2) Yang--Mills theory\nin four-dimensional Euclidean space which is based on the Flow Equations of the\nrenormalization group. The main motivation is to present a proof which does not\nmake appear mathematically undefined objects (as for example dimensionally\nregularized generating functionals), which permits to parametrize the theory in\nterms of {\\it physical} renormalization conditions, and which allows to control\nthe singularities of the correlation functions of the theory in the infrared\ndomain. Thus a large part of the proof is dedicated to bounds on massless\ncorrelation functions.\n", "  We aim to explain in a unified way the experimental data on ultrahigh energy\ncosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrinos, using a single source class and obeying\nlimits on the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background (EGRB). If UHECRs only\ninteract hadronically with gas around their sources, the resulting diffuse CR\nflux can be matched well to the observed one, providing at the same time large\nneutrino fluxes. However, air showers in the Earth's atmosphere induced by\nUHECRs with energies $E>3\\times 10^{18}$ eV would reach in such a case their\nmaxima too high. Therefore additional photo-hadronic interactions of UEHCRs\nclose to the accelerator have to be present, in order to modify the nuclear\ncomposition of CRs in a relatively narrow energy interval. We include thus both\nphoton and gas backgrounds, and combine the resulting CR spectra with the\nhigh-energy part of the Galactic CR fluxes predicted by the escape model. As\nresult, we find a good description of experimental data on the total CR flux,\nthe mean shower depth $X_\\max$ and its width $RMS(X_\\max)$ in the whole energy\nrange above $E\\simeq 10^{17}$ eV. The predicted high-energy neutrino flux\nmatches IceCube measurements, while the contribution to the EGRB is of order\n30%.\n", "  We review how vertex constraints inherited from the thermal ground state\nstrongly reduce the integration support of loop four-momenta associated with\nmassive quasi-particles in bubble diagrams constituting corrections to the free\nthermal quasi-particle pressure. In spite of the observed increasingly\nsuppressing effect when increasing 2-particle-irreducible (2PI) loop order, a\nquantitative analysis enables us to disprove the conjecture voiced in\nhep-th/0609033 that the loop expansion would terminate at a finite order. This\nreveals the necessity to investigate exact expressions of (at least some)\nhigher-loop order diagrams. Explicit calculation shows that although the\nbehaviour of the 2PI three-loop contribution at low temperatures displays\nhierarchical suppression compared to lower loop-orders, its high-temperature\nexpression instead dominates all lower orders. However, an all-loop-order\nresummation of a class of 2PI bubble diagrams is shown to yield an analytic\ncontinuation of the low-temperature hierarchy to all temperatures in the\ndeconfining phase.\n", "  Using very long molecular dynamics simulation runs, temperature protocols\nspanning up to five orders of magnitude in time-scales are performed to\ninvestigate thermally activated structural relaxation in a model amorphous\nsolid. The simulations demonstrate significant local structural excitations as\na function of increasing temperature and show that enthalpy rather than energy\nis primarily responsible for relaxation. The observed enthalpy changes are of\nthe order seen in experiment, and can be correlated with the level of internal\nhydrostatic stress homogenization and icosahedral content within the solid.\n", "  When modeling global satellite data to recover a planetary magnetic or\ngravitational potential field and evaluate it elsewhere, the method of choice\nremains their analysis in terms of spherical harmonics. When only regional data\nare available, or when data quality varies strongly with geographic location,\nthe inversion problem becomes severely ill-posed. In those cases, adopting\nexplicitly local methods is to be preferred over adapting global ones (e.g., by\nregularization). Here, we develop the theory behind a procedure to invert for\nplanetary potential fields from vector observations collected within a\nspatially bounded region at varying satellite altitude. Our method relies on\nthe construction of spatiospectrally localized bases of functions that mitigate\nthe noise amplification caused by downward continuation (from the satellite\naltitude to the planetary surface) while balancing the conflicting demands for\nspatial concentration and spectral limitation. Solving simultaneously for\ninternal and external fields in the same setting of regional data availability\nreduces internal-field artifacts introduced by downward-continuing unmodeled\nexternal fields, as we show with numerical examples. The AC-GVSF are optimal\nlinear combinations of vector spherical harmonics. Their construction is not\naltogether very computationally demanding when the concentration domains (the\nregions of spatial concentration) have circular symmetry, e.g., on spherical\ncaps or rings - even when the spherical-harmonic bandwidth is large. Data\ninversion proceeds by solving for the expansion coefficients of truncated\nfunction sequences, by least-squares analysis in a reduced-dimensional space.\nHence, our method brings high-resolution regional potential-field modeling from\nincomplete and noisy vector-valued satellite data within reach of contemporary\ndesktop machines.\n", "  We define the knotting probability of a knot $K$ by the probability for a\nrandom polygon (RP) or self-avoiding polygon (SAP) of $N$ segments having the\nknot type $K$. We show fundamental and generic properties of the knotting\nprobability particularly its dependence on the excluded volume. We investigate\nthem for the SAP consisting of hard cylindrical segments of unit length and\nradius $r_{\\rm ex}$. For various prime and composite knots we numerically show\nthat a compact formula describes the knotting probabilities for the cylindrical\nSAP as a function of segment number $N$ and radius $r_{\\rm ex}$. It connects\nthe small-$N$ to the large-$N$ behavior and even to lattice knots in the case\nof large values of radius. As the excluded volume increases the maximum of the\nknotting probability decreases for prime knots except for the trefoil knot. If\nit is large, the trefoil knot and its descendants are dominant among the\nnontrivial knots in the SAP. From the factorization property of the knotting\nprobability we derive a relation among the estimates of a fitting parameter for\nall prime knots, which suggests the local knot picture. Here we remark that the\ncylindrical SAP gives a model of circular DNA which are negatively charged and\nsemiflexible, where radius $r_{\\rm ex}$ corresponds to the screening length.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge process (i.e. the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process conditioned to start and end at fixed points)\nconstraints to have a fixed area under its path. We present both anticipative\n(in this case, we need the knowledge of the future of the path) and\nnon-anticipative versions of the stochastic process. We obtain the anticipative\ndescription thanks to the theory of generalized Gaussian bridges while the\nnon-anticipative representation comes from the theory of stochastic control.\nFor this last representation, a stochastic differential equation is derived\nwhich leads to an effective Langevin equation. Finally, we extend our\ntheoretical findings to linear bridge processes.\n", "  We present a method of detecting sequence defects by supercoiling DNA with\nmagnetic tweezers. The method is sensitive to a single mismatched base pair in\na DNA sequence of several thousand base pairs. We systematically compare DNA\nmolecules with 0 to 16 adjacent mismatches at 1 M monovalent salt and 3.5 pN\nforce and show that, under these conditions, a single plectoneme forms and is\nstably pinned at the defect. We use these measurements to estimate the energy\nand degree of end-loop kinking at defects. From this, we calculate the relative\nprobability of plectoneme pinning at the mismatch under physiologically\nrelevant conditions. Based on this estimate, we propose that DNA supercoiling\ncould contribute to mismatch and damage sensing in vivo.\n", "  Many real-world communication networks often have hybrid nature with both\nfixed nodes and moving modes, such as the mobile phone networks mainly composed\nof fixed base stations and mobile phones. In this paper, we discuss the\ninformation transmission process on the hybrid networks with both fixed and\nmobile nodes. The fixed nodes (base stations) are connected as a spatial\nlattice on the plane forming the information-carrying backbone, while the\nmobile nodes (users), which are the sources and destinations of information\npackets, connect to their current nearest fixed nodes respectively to deliver\nand receive information packets. We observe the phase transition of traffic\nload in the hybrid network when the packet generation rate goes from below and\nthen above a critical value, which measures the network capacity of packets\ndelivery. We obtain the optimal speed of moving nodes leading to the maximum\nnetwork capacity. We further improve the network capacity by rewiring the fixed\nnodes and by considering the current load of fixed nodes during packets\ntransmission. Our purpose is to optimize the network capacity of hybrid\nnetworks from the perspective of network science, and provide some insights for\nthe construction of future communication infrastructures.\n", "  Scale-free networks are quite popular nowadays since many systems are well\nrepresented by such structures. In order to study these systems, several models\nwere proposed. However, most of them do not take into account the node-to-node\nEuclidean distance, i.e., the geographical distance. In real networks, the\ndistance between sites can be very relevant, e.g., those cases where it is\nintended to minimize costs. Within this scenario we studied the role of\ndimensionality $d$ in the Bianconi-Barab\\'asi model with a preferential\nattachment growth involving Euclidean distances. The preferential attachment in\nthis model follows the rule $\\Pi_{i} \\propto \\eta_i k_i/r_{ij}^{\\alpha_A}$ $(1\n\\leq i < j; \\alpha_A \\geq 0)$, where $\\eta_i$ characterizes the fitness of the\n$i$-th site and is randomly chosen within the $(0,1]$ interval. We verified\nthat the degree distribution $P(k)$ for dimensions $d=1,2,3,4$ are well fitted\nby $P(k) \\propto e_q^{-k/\\kappa}$, where $e_q^{-k/\\kappa}$ is the\n$q$-exponential function naturally emerging within nonextensive statistical\nmechanics. We determine the index $q$ and $\\kappa$ as functions of the\nquantities $\\alpha_A$ and $d$, and numerically verify that both present a\nuniversal behavior with respect to the scaled variable $\\alpha_A/d$. The same\nbehavior also has been displayed by the dynamical $\\beta$ exponent which\ncharacterizes the steadily growing number of links of a given site.\n", "  It is a fundamental problem to characterize the nonequilibrium processes. For\na slowly moving one-dimensional potential, we explore the quasi adiabatic\ndynamics of the initial energy eigenstates for a confined quantum system\ninteracting with a large reservoir. For concreteness, we investigate a dragged\nharmonic oscillator linearly interacting with an assembly of harmonic\noscillators, and explore the deviation from adiabatic processes by rigorously\ncalculating the so-called persistent amplitude. In this way, we also show that\nthe phase of the persistent amplitudes are common both for the ground and\nexcited states.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a novel topological phase of matter, in which Weyl\nfermions (WFs) arise as pseudo-magnetic monopoles in its momentum space. The\nchirality of the WFs, given by the sign of the monopole charge, is central to\nthe Weyl physics, since it directly serves as the sign of the topological\nnumber and gives rise to exotic properties such as Fermi arcs and the chiral\nanomaly. Despite being the defining property of a WSM, the chirality of the WFs\nhas never been experimentally measured. Here, we directly detect the chirality\nof the WFs by measuring the photocurrent in response to circularly polarized\nmid-infrared light. The resulting photocurrent is determined by both the\nchirality of WFs and that of the photons. Our results pave the way for\nrealizing a wide range of theoretical proposals for studying and controlling\nthe WFs and their associated quantum anomalies by optical and electrical means.\nMore broadly, the two chiralities, analogous to the two valleys in 2D\nmaterials, lead to a new degree of freedom in a 3D crystal with potential novel\npathways to store and carry information.\n", "  A semicalssical method based on surface-hopping techniques is developed to\nmodel the dynamics of radiative association with electronic transitions in\narbitrary polyatomic systems. It can be proven that our method is an extension\nof the established semiclassical formula used in the characterization of\ndiatomic molecule- formation. Our model is tested for diatomic molecules. It\ngives the same cross sections as the former semiclassical formula, but contrary\nto the former method it allows us to follow the fate of the trajectories after\nthe emission of a photon. This means that we can characterize the rovibrational\nstates of the stabilized molecules: using semiclassial quantization we can\nobtain quantum state resolved cross sections or emission spectra for the\nradiative association process. The calculated semiclassical state resolved\nspectra show good agreement with the result of quantum mechanical perturbation\ntheory. Furthermore our surface-hopping model is not only applicable for the\ndescription of radiative association but it can be use for semiclassical\ncharacterization of any molecular process where spontaneous emission occurs.\n", "  We propose an approximation for the total ice nucleation rate J=J(T,R) in\nsupercooled water droplets as a function of both droplet radius R and\ntemperature T, taking account of both volume-based and surface-stimulated\nnucleation modes. Its crucial idea is that, even in the surface-stimulated mode\ncrystal nuclei initially emerge (as sub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the\nsub-surface layer, not \"pseudo-heterogeneously\" at the surface. This mode is\nnegligible in large droplets, but becomes increasingly important with\ndecreasing droplet size and is dominant in small droplets. The crossover\ndroplet radius for the transition of homogeneous ice nucleation from the\nvolume-based mode to the surface-stimulated mode nonmonotonically depends on T\nfrom 233 K to 239.5 K, ranging there from about 2 microns to about 100 microns.\nUsing experimental data on ice nucleation rates in small droplets, we determine\nthat the ice-air interfacial tension of basal facets of ice crystals\nmonotonically increases from about 89 dyn/cm at T=234.8 K to about 91 dyn/cm at\nT=236.2 K.\n", "  We discuss the development and implementation of a constant temperature (NVT)\nmolecular dynamics scheme that combines the Nos\\'e-Hoover chain thermostat with\nthe extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) scheme,\nusing a linear scaling density functional theory (DFT) approach. An integration\nscheme for this canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD is developed and\ndiscussed in the context of the Liouville operator formulation. Linear scaling\nDFT canonical-ensemble extended Lagrangian BOMD simulations are tested on bulk\nsilicon and silicon carbide systems to evaluate our integration scheme. The\nresults show that the conserved quantity remains stable with no systematic\ndrift even in the presence of the thermostat.\n", "  Using the recently developed Coulomb Quantum Orbit Strong-Field Approximation\n(CQSFA), we perform a systematic analysis of several features encountered in\nabove-threshold ionization (ATI) photoelectron angle-resolved distributions\n(PADs), such as side lobes, and intra- and intercycle interference patterns.\nThe latter include not only the well-known intra-cycle rings and the\nnear-threshold fan-shaped structure, but also previously overlooked patterns.\nWe provide a direct account of how the Coulomb potential distorts different\ntypes of interfering trajectories and changes the corresponding phase\ndifferences, and show that these patterns may be viewed as generalized\nholographic structures formed by up to three types of trajectories. We also\nderive analytical interference conditions and estimates valid in the presence\nor absence of the residual potential, and assess the range of validity of\nCoulomb-corrected interference conditions provided in the literature.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the stability of nineteen different periodic\nstructures using the finite range Lennard-Jones potential model discussing the\neffects of pressure, potential truncation, cutoff distance and Lennard-Jones\nexponents. The structures considered are the hexagonal close packed (hcp), face\ncentred cubic (fcc) and seventeen other polytype stacking sequences, such as\ndhcp and $9R$. We found that at certain pressure and cutoff distance values,\nneither fcc nor hcp is the ground state structure as previously documented, but\ndifferent polytypic sequences. This behaviour shows a strong dependence on the\nway the tail of the potential is truncated.\n", "  We present a calculation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm hvp}$, in lattice QCD\nemploying dynamical up and down quarks. We focus on controlling the infrared\nregime of the vacuum polarization function. To this end we employ several\ncomplementary approaches, including Pad\\'e fits, time moments and the\ntime-momentum representation. We correct our results for finite-volume effects\nby combining the Gounaris-Sakurai parameterization of the timelike pion form\nfactor with the L\\\"uscher formalism. On a subset of our ensembles we have\nderived an upper bound on the magnitude of quark-disconnected diagrams and\nfound that they decrease the estimate for $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm hvp}$ by at most 2%.\nOur final result is $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm hvp}=(654\\pm32\\,{}^{+21}_{-23})\\cdot\n10^{-10}$, where the first error is statistical, and the second denotes the\ncombined systematic uncertainty. Based on our findings we discuss the prospects\nfor determining $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm hvp}$ with sub-percent precision.\n", "  We present an all-fibre source of high-purity heralded single photons with an\nintegrated conditional optical gate that reduces uncorrelated noise by almost\nan order of magnitude. Generating photon pairs by four-wave mixing in photonic\ncrystal fibre, we observe with the noise gate active a factor of 7 reduction in\nthe rate of single counts in the heralded channel with no measurable drop in\ncoincidence count rate. In contrast to electronic post-selection of coincidence\nevents, the real reduction in the flux of unwanted photons is beneficial for\nexample to avoid bleaching light-sensitive samples or in generating entangled\nstates.\n", "  Two body $B$ meson decays involving the radially excited meson\n$\\psi(2S)/\\eta_c(2S)$ in the final states are studied by using the perturbative\nQCD (pQCD) approach. We find that: (a) The branching ratios for the decays\ninvolving $K$ meson are predicted as\n$Br(B^+\\to\\psi(2S)K^+)=(5.37^{+1.85}_{-2.22})\\times10^{-4},\nBr(B^0\\to\\psi(2S)K^0)=(4.98^{+1.71}_{-2.06})\\times10^{-4},\nBr(B^+\\to\\eta_c(2S)K^+)=(3.54^{+3.18}_{-3.09})\\times10^{-4}$, which are\nconsistent well with the present data when including the next-to-leading-order\n(NLO) effects. Here the NLO effects are from the vertex corrections and the NLO\nWilson coefficients. The large errors in the decay $B^+\\to\\eta_c(2S)K^+$ are\nmainly induced by using the decay constant\n$f_{\\eta_c(2S)}=0.243^{+0.079}_{-0.111}$ GeV with large uncertainties. (b)\nWhile there seems to be some room left for other higher order corrections or\nthe non-perturbative long distance contributions in the decays involving $\\pi$\nmeson, $Br(B^+\\to\\psi(2S)\\pi^+)=(1.17^{+0.42}_{-0.50})\\times10^{-5},\nBr(B^0\\to\\psi(2S)\\pi^0)=0.54^{+0.20}_{-0.23}\\times10^{-5}$, which are smaller\nthan the present data. The results for other decays can be tested at the\nrunning LHCb and forthcoming Super-B experiments. (c) There is no obvious\nevidence of the direct CP violation being seen in the decays $B\\to\n\\psi(2S)\\pi(K), \\eta_c(2S)\\pi(K)$ in the present experiments, which is\nsupported by our calculations. If a few percent value is confirmed in the\nfuture , it would indicate new physics definitely.\n", "  We perform a global Bayesian analysis of currently available neutrino data,\nputting data from oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$), and precision cosmology on an equal footing. We evaluate\nthe discovery potential of future $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments and the Bayes\nfactor of the two possible neutrino mass ordering schemes for different prior\nchoices. We show that the indication for normal ordering is still very mild and\ndoes not strongly depend on realistic prior assumptions or different\ncombinations of cosmological data sets. We find a wide range for\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ discovery potential, depending on the absolute neutrino mass\nscale, mass ordering and achievable background level.\n", "  The effective field theory of dark energy and modified gravity is supposed to\nwell describe, at low energies, the behaviour of the gravity modifications due\nto one extra scalar degree of freedom. The usual curvature perturbation is very\nuseful when studying the conditions for the avoidance of ghost instabilities as\nwell as the positivity of the squared speeds of propagation for both the scalar\nand tensor modes, or the St\\\"uckelberg field performs perfectly when\ninvestigating the evolution of linear perturbations. We show that the viable\nparameters space identified by requiring no-ghost instabilities and positive\nsquared speeds of propagation does not change by performing a field\nredefinition, while the requirement of the avoidance of tachyonic instability\nmight instead be different. Therefore, we find interesting to associate to the\ngeneral modified gravity theory described in the effective field theory\nframework, a perturbation field which will inherit the whole properties of the\ntheory. In the present paper we address the following questions: 1) how can we\ndefine such a field? and 2) what is the mass of such a field as the background\napproaches a final de Sitter state? We define a gauge invariant quantity which\nidentifies the density of the dark energy perturbation field valid for any\nbackground. We derive the mass associated to the gauge invariant dark energy\nfield on a de Sitter background, which we retain to be still a good\napproximation also at very low redshift ($z\\simeq 0$). On this background we\nalso investigate the value of the speed of propagation and we find that there\nexist classes of theories which admit a non-vanishing speed of propagation,\neven among the Horndeski model, for which in literature it has previously been\nfound a zero speed. We finally apply our results to specific well known models.\n", "  We report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of low energy ($\\hbar\n\\omega < 10$ meV) magnetic excitations in the \"11\" system\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$. The spin correlations are two-dimensional (2D) in\nthe superconducting samples at low temperature, but appear much more\nthree-dimensional when the temperature rises well above $T_c \\sim 15$ K, with a\nclear increase of the (dynamic) spin correlation length perpendicular to the Fe\nplanes. The spontaneous change of dynamic spin correlations from 2D to 3D on\nwarming is unexpected and cannot be naturally explained when only the spin\ndegree of freedom is considered. Our results suggest that the low temperature\nphysics in the \"11\" system, in particular the evolution of low energy spin\nexcitations towards %better satisfying the nesting condition for mediating\nsuperconducting pairing, is driven by changes in orbital correlations.\n", "  GPS, an excellent tool for geodesy, may serve also particle physics. In the\npresence of Earth's magnetic field, a GPS photon may be transformed into an\naxion. The proposed experimental setup involves the transmission of a GPS\nsignal from a satellite to another satellite, both in low orbit around the\nEarth. To increase the accuracy of the experiment, we evaluate the influence of\nEarth's gravitational field on the whole quantum phenomenon. There is a\nsignificant advantage in our proposal. While geomagnetic field B is low, the\nmagnetized length L is very large, resulting into a scale (BL)^2 orders of\nmagnitude higher than existing or proposed reaches. The transformation of the\nGPS photons into axion particles will result in a dimming of the photons and\neven to a \"light shining through the Earth\" phenomenon.\n", "  Extensible quantum computing architectures require a large array of quantum\ndevices operating with low error rates. A quantum processor based on\nsuperconducting quantum bits can be scaled up by stacking microchips that each\nperform different computational functions. In this article, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a thermocompression bonding technology that utilizes indium films\nas a welding agent to attach pairs of lithographically-patterned chips. We\nperform chip-to-chip indium bonding in vacuum at $190^{\\circ}C$ with indium\nfilm thicknesses of $150 nm$. We characterize the dc and microwave performance\nof bonded devices at room and cryogenic temperatures. At $10 mK$, we find a dc\nbond resistance of $515 n{\\Omega}mm^2$. Additionally, we show minimal microwave\nreflections and good transmission up to $6.8 GHz$ in a tunnel-capped, bonded\ndevice as compared to a similar uncapped device. As a proof of concept, we\nfabricate and measure a set of tunnel-capped superconducting resonators,\ndemonstrating that our bonding technology can be used in quantum computing\napplications.\n", "  The plateau in the duration distribution of long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs)\nprovides a direct observational evidence for the Collapsar model. The plateau\nreflects the fact that the observed duration satisfies: $T_{90} = t_{e}-t_{b}$\nwhere $t_{e}$ is the time that the central engine operates and $t_{b}$ is a\nthreshold time, interpreted within the Collapsar model as the time it takes for\nthe relativistic jet to penetrate the stellar envelope. Numerical simulation\nand macronova observations suggest that compact binary mergers involve mass\nejection. If short-Gamma Ray Bursts (sGRBs) arise from such mergers, their jets\nshould cross this surrounding ejecta before producing the prompt emission. Like\nin LGRBs, this should result in a distinct short plateau in the GRBs' duration\ndistribution. We present a new analysis of the duration distribution for the\nthree GRB satellites: BATSE, {\\it Swift} and Fermi. We find a clear evidence\nfor a short ($\\sim 0.4$ sec) plateau in the duration distribution. This plateau\nis consistent with the expected jet crossing time, provided that the ejecta is\nof order of a few percent of solar masses.\n", "  CsFeBr$_3$ is an $S\\,{=}\\,1$ hexagonal antiferromagnet that has a singlet\nground state owing to its large easy-plane single-ion anisotropy. The critical\nbehavior of the magnetic-field-induced phase transition for a magnetic field\nparallel to the $c$ axis, which can be described by the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) of magnons under the $U(1)$ symmetry, was investigated via\nmagnetization and specific heat measurements down to 0.1$\\,$K. For the specific\nheat measurement, we have developed a method of effectively suppressing the\ntorque acting on a sample with strong anisotropy that uses the spin dimer\ncompound Ba$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ with large and anisotropic Van Vleck\nparamagnetism. The temperature dependence of the transition field $H_{\\rm\nc}(T)$ was found to follow the power-law $H_{\\rm c}(T)\\,{-}\\,H_{\\rm\nc}\\,{\\propto}\\,T^{\\phi}$ with a critical exponent of\n${\\phi}\\,{=}\\,1.50\\,{\\pm}\\,0.02$ and critical field of $H_{\\rm c}\\,{=}\\,2.60$\nT. This result verifies the universality of the three-dimensional BEC of\nmagnons described by ${\\phi}_{\\rm BEC}\\,{=}\\,3/2$.\n", "  A thin Hafnium film is shown to act both as an effective diffusion barrier\nfor manganese at a thickness of 0.7 nm, and as an effective exchange coupling\nlayer in a sandwich structure with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The\nmagnetic layers are Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and the low moment ferrimagnet\nMn$_2$Ru$_x$Ga (MRG). The coupling changes sign at the compensation temperature\nof MRG and the exchange energy reaches 0.11 mJm$^{-2}$ for the thinnest Hf\ninterlayers. Ruthenium, the usual metal of choice for coupling ferromagnetic\nlayers in thin film heterostructures, cannot be used with the zero-moment half\nmetal MRG because of Ru interdiffusion. Due to its large coercivity near\ncompensation, the MRG can act as an effective source of exchange pinning.\n", "  The de Finetti theorem and its extensions concern the structure of\nmultipartite probability distributions with certain symmetry properties, the\nparadigmatic original example being permutation symmetry. These theorems assert\nthat such symmetric distributions are well approximated by convex combinations\nof uncorrelated ones. In this article, we apply de Finetti theorems to quantum\ngravity theories, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model or large-N vector\nand gauge theories. For SYK we put recent studies of information/entanglement\ndynamics in a general and rigorous basis. For vector and gauge theories, we\nfind a gauge invariant operator whose expectation value provides the leading\nterm in the entanglement entropy in all states close enough to a given\nclassical state. These results can be unified through a generic statement about\nthe nature of Schmidt decompositions and decoherence in large-N theories. In\nthe reverse direction, we extend de Finetti theorems in various ways and\nprovide an independent approach to the theorems only based on the large-N\nproperties of the gauge invariant coherence group.\n", "  We present results of integral field spectroscopy of Balmer-dominated shocks\nin the LMC supernova remnant (SNR) N103B, carried out using the Wide Field\nIntegral Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring\nObservatory in Australia. Existing X-ray studies of N103B have indicated a Type\nIa supernova origin. Radiative shock emission from clumpy material surrounding\nthe SNR may result from interaction of the forward shock with relic stellar\nwind material, possibly implicating a thermonuclear explosion in a\nsingle-degenerate binary system. The recently discovered Balmer-dominated\nshocks mark the impact of the forward shock with low density, partially neutral\nCSM gas, and form a partial shell encircling clumps of material exhibiting\nradiative shocks. The WiFeS spectra of N103B cover the range 3500 - 7000\nAngstroms and reveal broad Halpha profiles up to 2360 km/s in width along the\nnorthern rim, and both Halpha and Hbeta broad profiles approximately 1300 km/s\nin width along the southern rim. Our fits to the Halpha line profiles indicate\nthat in addition to from the usual broad and narrow emission components, a\nthird component of intermediate width exists in the Balmer-dominated shocks,\nranging from around 125 km/s up to 225 km/s in width. Recent Balmer-dominated\nshock models have predicted such an intermediate-width component will be\ngenerated in a fast neutral precursor. We derive a Sedov age of approximately\n685 years for N103B from the Balmer-dominated spectra, consistent with the\nyoung age of 380 - 860 years estimated from light echo studies.\n", "  Pion production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at intermediate energies was\nmodeled in the framework of the Isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck\n(IBUU) transport model. The effects of nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations\nin initialization and mean-field potential, isospin-dependent in-medium\nbaryon-baryon elastic and inelastic cross sections and pion in-medium effect\nare all considered in this model. It is found that the ratio and yields of\n$\\pi^{-}$and $\\pi^{+}$ in Au+Au reaction at 400 MeV/nucleon reproduce the\nFOPI/GSI data very well especially with a soft symmetry energy in the present\ntransport model. Predictions on the single and double $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio\nare made for the isotope reaction systems $^{132}\\rm {Sn}+^{124}\\rm {Sn}$ and\n$^{108}\\rm {Sn}+^{112}\\rm {Sn}$ at 300 MeV/nucleon since related experiments\nare being carried out at RIKEN/Japan.\n", "  2D materials provide a platform for strong light--matter interactions,\ncreating wide-ranging design opportunities via new-material discoveries and new\nmethods for geometrical structuring. We derive general upper bounds to the\nstrength of such light--matter interactions, given only the optical\nconductivity of the material, including spatial nonlocality, and otherwise\nindependent of shape and configuration. Our material figure of merit shows that\nhighly doped graphene is an optimal material at infrared frequencies, whereas\nsingle-atomic-layer silver is optimal in the visible. For quantities ranging\nfrom absorption and scattering to near-field spontaneous-emission enhancements\nand radiative heat transfer, we consider canonical geometrical structures and\nshow that in certain cases the bounds can be approached, while in others there\nmay be significant opportunity for design improvement. The bounds can encourage\nsystematic improvements in the design of ultrathin broadband absorbers, 2D\nantennas, and near-field energy harvesters.\n", "  Two-photon superbunching of pseudothermal light is observed with single-mode\ncontinuous-wave laser light in a linear optical system. By adding more\ntwo-photon paths via three rotating ground glasses,g(2)(0) = 7.10 is\nexperimentally observed. The second-order temporal coherence function of\nsuperbunching pseudothermal light is theoretically and experimentally studied\nin detail. It is predicted that the degree of coherence of light can be\nincreased dramatically by adding more multi-photon paths. For instance, the\ndegree of the second- and third-order coherence of the superbunching\npseudothermal light with five rotating ground glasses can reach 32 and 7776,\nrespectively. The results are helpful to understand the physics of\nsuperbunching and to improve the visibility of thermal light ghost imaging.\n", "  In $\\mu$-hybrid inflation a nonzero inflaton vacuum expectation value induced\nby supersymmetry breaking is proportional to the gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$,\nwhich can be exploited to resolve the minimal supersymmetric standard model\n$\\mu$ problem. We show how this scenario can be successfully implemented with\n$m_{3/2} \\sim 1-100$ TeV and reheat temperature as low as $10^6$ GeV by\nemploying a minimal renormalizable superpotential coupled with a well defined\nnon-minimal K\\\"ahler potential. The tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, a canonical\nmeasure of primordial gravity waves in most cases is less than or of the order\nof $10^{-6}-10^{-3}$.\n", "  Traditional matched field processing is based on the comparison of the\ncomplex amplitudes of the measured and calculated wave fields at the aperture\nof the receiving antenna. This paper considers an alternative approach based on\ncomparing the intensity distributions of these fields in the \"depth -- arrival\nangle\" plane. To construct these intensities, the formalism of coherent states\nborrowed from quantum mechanics is used. The main advantage of the approach\nunder consideration is its low sensitivity to the inevitable inaccuracy of an\nenvironmental model used in calculation.\n", "  The short-time dynamics of bacterial chromosomal loci is a mixture of\nsubdiffusive and active motion, in the form of rapid relocations with\nnear-ballistic dynamics. While previous work has shown that such rapid motions\nare ubiquitous, we still have little grasp on their physical nature, and no\npositive model is available that describes them. Here, we propose a minimal\ntheoretical model for loci movements as a fractional Brownian motion subject to\na constant but intermittent driving force, and compare simulations and\nanalytical calculations to data from high-resolution dynamic tracking in E.\ncoli. This analysis yields the characteristic time scales for intermittency.\nFinally, we discuss the possible shortcomings of this model, and show that an\nincrease in the effective local noise felt by the chromosome associates to the\nactive relocations.\n", "  The two-point complex coherence function constitutes a complete\nrepresentation for scalar quasi-monochromatic optical fields. Exploiting\ndynamically reconfigurable slits implemented with a digital micromirror device,\nwe report on measurements of the complex two-point coherence function for\npartially coherent light scattering from a `scene' comprising one or two\nobjects at different transverse and axial positions with respect to the source.\nAlthough the intensity shows no discernible shadows in absence of a lens,\nnumerically back-propagating the measured complex coherence function allows\nestimating the objects' sizes and locations -- and thus the reconstruction of\nthe scene.\n", "  In this work we study a system of interacting fermions with large spin and\nSP(N) symmetry. We contrast their behaviour with the case of SU(N) symmetry by\nanalysing the conserved quantities and the dynamics in each case. We also\ndevelop the Fermi liquid theory for fermions with SP(N) symmetry. We find that\nthe effective mass and inverse compressibility are always enhanced in the\npresence of interactions, and that the N-dependence of the enhancement is\nqualitatively different in distinct parameter regimes. The Wilson ratio can be\nenhanced, indicating that the system can be made closer to a magnetic\ninstability, in contrast to the SU(N) scenario. We conclude discussing what are\nthe experimental routes to SP(N) symmetry within cold atoms and the exciting\npossibility to realize physics in higher dimensions in these systems.\n", "  Polymer translocation experiments typically involve anionic polyelectrolytes\nsuch as DNA molecules driven through negatively charged nanopores. Quantitative\nmodelling of polymer capture to the nanopore followed by translocation\ntherefore necessitates the consideration of the electrostatic barrier resulting\nfrom like-charge polymer-pore interactions. To this end, in this work we couple\nmean-field level electrohydrodynamic equations with the Smoluchowski formalism\nto characterize the interplay between the electrostatic barrier, the\nelectrophoretic drift, and the electro-osmotic liquid flow. In particular, we\nfind that due to distinct ion density regimes where the salt screening of the\ndrift and barrier effects occur, there exists a characteristic salt\nconcentration maximizing the probability of barrier-limited polymer capture\ninto the pore. We also show that in the barrier-dominated regime, the polymer\ntranslocation time increases exponentially with the membrane charge and decays\nexponentially fast with the pore radius and the salt concentration. These\nresults suggest that the alteration of these parameters in the barrier-driven\nregime can be an efficient way to control the duration of the translocation\nprocess and facilitate more accurate measurements of the ionic current signal\nin the pore.\n", "  Ultracold atomic physics experiments offer a nearly ideal context for the\ninvestigation of quantum systems far from equilibrium. We describe three\nrelated emerging directions of research into extreme non-equilibrium phenomena\nin atom traps: quantum emulation of ultrafast atom-light interactions, coherent\nphasonic spectroscopy in tunable quasicrystals, and realization of Floquet\nmatter in strongly-driven lattice systems. We show that all three should enable\nquantum emulation in parameter regimes inaccessible in solid-state experiments,\nfacilitating a complementary approach to open problems in non-equilibrium\ncondensed matter.\n", "  Limited bonding valence, usually accompanied by well-defined directional\ninteractions and selective bonding mechanisms, is nowadays considered among the\nkey ingredients to create complex structures with tailored properties: even\nthough isotropically interacting units already guarantee access to a vast range\nof functional materials, anisotropic interactions can provide extra\ninstructions to steer the assembly of specific architectures. The anisotropy of\neffective interactions gives rise to a wealth of self-assembled structures both\nin the realm of suitably synthesized nano- and micro-sized building blocks and\nin nature, where the isotropy of interactions is often a zero-th order\ndescription of the complicated reality. In this review, we span a vast range of\nsystems characterized by limited bonding valence, from patchy colloids of new\ngeneration to polymer-based functionalized nanoparticles, DNA-based systems and\nproteins, and describe how the interaction patterns of the single building\nblocks can be designed to tailor the properties of the target final structures.\n", "  The characterization of a third order nonlinear integrated waveguide is\nreported for the first time by means of a top-hat Dispersive-Scan (D-Scan)\ntechnique, a temporal analog of the top-hat Z-Scan. With a single laser beam,\nand by carrying two counter-directional nonlinear transmissions to assess the\ninput and output coupling efficiencies, a novel procedure is described leading\nto an accurate measurement of the TPA figure of merit, the effective Two-Photon\nAbsorption (TPA) and optical Kerr (including the sign) coefficients. The\ntechnique is validated in a silicon strip waveguide for which the effective\nnonlinear coefficients are measured with an accuracy of $\\pm 10~\\%$\n", "  We study the effect of the electromagnetic environment on the resonance\nfrequency of plasmonic excitations in dimers of interacting metallic\nnanoparticles. The coupling between plasmons and vacuum electromagnetic\nfluctuations induces a shift in the resonance frequencies (analogous to the\nLamb shift in atomic physics) which is usually not measurable in an isolated\nnanoparticle. In contrast, we show that this shift leads to sizable corrections\nto the level splitting induced by dipolar interactions in nanoparticle dimers.\nFor the system parameters which we consider in this work, the ratio between the\nlevel splitting for the longitudinal and transverse hybridized modes takes a\nuniversal form dependent only on the interparticle distance and thus is highly\ninsensitive to the precise fabrication details of the two nanoparticles. We\ndiscuss the possibility to successfully perform the proposed measurement using\nstate-of-the-art nanoplasmonic architectures.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the main algebraic properties of the maximally\nsuperintegrable system known as \"Perlick system type I\". All possible values of\nthe relevant parameters, $K$ and $\\beta$, are considered. In particular,\ndepending on the sign of the parameter $K$ entering in the metrics, the motion\nwill take place on compact or non compact Riemannian manifolds. To perform our\nanalysis we follow a classical variant of the so called factorization method.\nAccordingly, we derive the full set of constants of motion and construct their\nPoisson algebra. As it is expected for maximally superintegrable systems, the\nalgebraic structure will actually shed light also on the geometric features of\nthe trajectories, that will be depicted for different values of the initial\ndata and of the parameters. Especially, the crucial role played by the rational\nparameter $\\beta$ will be seen \"in action\".\n", "  In this paper, we derive the mass exclusion limits for the hypothetical\nvector resonances of a strongly interacting extension of the Standard model\nusing the most recent upper bounds on the cross sections for various resonance\nproduction processes. The $SU(2)_{L+R}$ triplet of the vector resonances under\nconsideration is embedded into the effective Lagrangian based on the non-linear\nsigma model with the $125$-GeV $SU(2)_{L+R}$ scalar singlet. No direct\ninteractions of the vector resonance to the SM fermions are assumed. We find\nthat among eleven processes considered in this paper only those where the\nvector resonances decay to $WW$ and $WZ$ provide the mass exclusion limit.\nDepending on the values of other parameters of the model the mass limit can be\nas low as 1 TeV.\n", "  The endohedral fullerene $^{15}\\mathrm{N@C}_{60}$ has narrow electron\nparamagnetic resonance lines which have been proposed as the basis for a\ncondensed-matter portable atomic clock. We measure the low-frequency spectrum\nof this molecule, identifying and characterizing a clock transition at which\nthe frequency becomes insensitive to magnetic field. We infer a linewidth at\nthe clock field of 100 kHz. Using experimental data, we are able to place a\nbound on the clock's projected frequency stability. We discuss ways to improve\nthe frequency stability to be competitive with existing miniature clocks.\n", "  We have fabricated 5 nm ultra-thin NbN nanowires that form a dense and\nregular array in the linear channels of mesoporous SBA-15 silica substrates.\nBulk NbN is a well-known classical superconductor with Tc of 16 K. We show\nthat, by being incorporated into this nanostructure, the composite material\nexhibits typical quasi-one-dimensional characteristics. We compare the\nsuperconducting properties with those of superconducting Pb nanowires of same\ndimensionality in identical configuration within the linear SBA-15 pores. While\nPb nanowire arrays show a pronounced crossover from 1D superconductivity at\nhigh temperatures to a 3D bulk superconducting state in the low temperature\nregime with true zero resistance triggered by transversal Josephson\ninteraction, this transition appears to be completely absent in the NbN\nnanowire array. The small coherence length in NbN, which strongly suppresses\nthe Josephson coupling is discussed as the origin of this difference.\n", "  The thermodynamics of $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in the covariant variational\napproach is studied by relating the free action density in the background of a\nnon-trivial Polyakov loop to the pressure of the gluon plasma. The correct\nsubtraction of the vacuum contribution in the free action density is argued\nfor. The Poisson resummed expression for the pressure can be evaluated\nanalytically in limiting cases, and shows the correct Stefan-Boltzmann limit at\n$T \\to \\infty$, while the limit $T \\to 0$ is afflicted by artifacts due to\nmassless modes in the confined phase. Several remedies to remove these\nartifacts are discussed. Using the numerical $T=0$ solutions for the ghost and\ngluon propagators in the covariant variational approach as input, the pressure,\nenergy density and interaction strength are calculated and compared to lattice\ndata.\n", "  We present thermophoretic measurements in aqueous suspensions of three\ndifferent polystyrene (PS) particles of varying negative charge, size and\nsurface coating. Our measurement technique is based on the observation of the\ncolloidal steady-state distribution using conventional bright-field microscopy,\nwhich avoids undesirable effects such as laser-induced convection or local\nheating. We find that the colloids with the weakest zeta potential exhibit the\nstrongest thermophoretic effect, suggesting that surface functionality leads to\na more intricate dependence of the Soret coefficient on hydrodynamic boundary\nconditions than predicted by existing theoretical approaches. We also study the\nrelaxation of the colloids to steady-state and propose a model to quantify the\nrelaxation speed, based on the time evolution of the colloidal center of mass.\nOur observations are well described by this model and show that the relaxation\nspeed tends to increase with the magnitude of the thermophoretic force.\n", "  We discuss phenomenological criteria for defining \"axion windows\", namely\nregions in the parameter space of the axion-photon coupling where realistic\nmodels live. Currently, the boundaries of this region depend on somewhat\narbitrary criteria, and it would be highly desirable to specify them in terms\nof precise phenomenological requirements. We first focus on hadronic axion\nmodels within post-inflationary scenarios, in which the initial abundance of\nthe new vectorlike quarks $Q$ is thermal. We classify their representations\n$R_Q$ by requiring that $i)$ the $Q$ are sufficiently short lived to avoid\nissues with long-lived strongly interacting relics, $ii)$ the theory remains\nweakly coupled up to the Planck scale. The more general case of multiple $R_Q$\nis also studied, and the absolute upper and lower bounds on the axion-photon\ncoupling as a function of the axion mass is identified. Pre-inflationary\nscenarios in which the axion decay constant remains bounded as $f_a\\leq 5\\cdot\n10^{11}\\,$GeV allow for axion-photon couplings only about 20% larger. Realistic\nDine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky type of axion models also remain encompassed\nwithin the hadronic axion window. Some mechanisms that can allow to enhance the\naxion-photon coupling to values sizeably above the preferred window are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this article we study the spin and tunneling dynamics as a function of\nmagnetic field in a one-dimensional GaAs double quantum dot with both the\nDresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular we consider different\nspatial widths for the spin-up and spin-down electronic states. We find that\nthe spin dynamics is a superposition of slow as well as fast Rabi oscillations.\nIt is found that the Rashba interaction strength as well as the external\nmagnetic field strongly modifies the slow Rabi oscillations which is\nparticularly useful for single qubit manipulation for possible quantum computer\napplications.\n", "  Unconventional fermions with high degeneracies in three dimensions beyond\nWeyl and Dirac fermions have sparked tremendous interest in condensed matter\nphysics. Here, we study quantum Hall effects (QHEs) in a two-dimensional (2D)\nunconventional fermion system with a pair of gapped spin-1 fermions. We find\nthat the original unlimited number of zero energy Landau levels (LLs) in the\ngapless case develop into a series of bands, leading to a novel QHE phenomenon\nthat the Hall conductance first decreases (or increases) to zero and then\nrevives as an infinite ladder of fine staircase when the Fermi surface is moved\ntoward zero energy, and it suddenly reverses with its sign being flipped due to\na Van Hove singularity when the Fermi surface is moved across zero. We further\ninvestigate the peculiar QHEs in a dice model with a pair of spin-1 fermions,\nwhich agree well with the results of the continuous model.\n", "  The distribution of cloud-base mass flux is studied using large-eddy\nsimulations (LES) of two reference cases, one representing conditions over the\ntropical ocean, and another one representing mid-latitude conditions over land.\nTo examine what sets the difference between the two distributions, nine\nadditional LES cases are set up as variations of the two reference cases. We\nfind that the total surface heat flux and its changes over the diurnal cycle do\nnot influence the distribution shape. The latter is also not determined by the\nlevel of organization in the cloud field. It is instead determined by the ratio\nof the surface sensible heat flux to the latent heat flux, the Bowen ratio $B$.\n$B$ sets the thermodynamic efficiency of the moist convective heat cycle, which\ndetermines the portion of the total surface heat flux that can be transformed\ninto mechanical work of convection against mechanical dissipation. The\nthermodynamic moist heat cycle sets the average mass flux per cloud $\\langle m\n\\rangle$, and through $\\langle m \\rangle$ it also controls the shape of the\ndistribution. An expression for $\\langle m \\rangle$ is derived based on the\nmoist convective heat cycle and is evaluated against LES. This expression can\nbe used in shallow cumulus parameterizations as a physical constraint on the\nmass flux distribution. The similarity between the mass flux and the cloud area\ndistributions indicate that $B$ also has a role in shaping the cloud area\ndistribution, which could explain its different shapes and slopes observed in\nprevious studies.\n", "  We compute the maximum mass a growing planetary embryo can reach depending on\nthe size of accreted planetesimals or pebbles, to infer the possibility of\ngrowing the cores of giant planets, and giant planets themselves. We compute\nthe internal structure of the gas envelope of planetary embryos, to determine\nthe core mass that is necessary to bind an envelope large enough to destroy\nplanetesimals or pebbles while they are gravitationally captured. We also\nconsider the effect of the advection wind originating from the protoplanetary\ndisk, following the results of Ormel et al. (2015). We show that for low mass\npebbles, once the planetary embryo is larger than ~1 Mearth, the envelope is\nlarge enough to destroy and vaporize pebbles completely before they can reach\nthe core. The material constituting pebbles is therefore released in the\nplanetary envelope, and later on dispersed in the protoplanetary disk, if the\nadvection wind is strong enough. As a consequence the growth of the planetary\nembryo is stopped at a mass that is so small that Kelvin-Helmholtz accretion\ncannot lead to the accretion of significant amounts of gas. For larger\nplanetesimals, a similar process occurs but at much larger mass, of the order\nof ten Earth masses, and is followed by rapid accretion of gas. If the effect\nof the advection is as efficient as described in Ormel al. (2015), the combined\neffect of the vaporization of accreted solids in the envelope of forming\nplanetary embryos, and of this advection wind, prevents the growth of the\nplanets at masses smaller or similar to the Earth mass in the case of formation\nby pebble accretion, up to a distance of the order of 10 AU. In the case of\nformation by accretion of large mass planetesimals, the growth of the planetary\ncore is limited at masses ~10 Mearth but further growth of the planet can\nproceed by gas accretion.\n", "  In the study of subdiffusive wave-packet spreading in disordered Klein-Gordon\n(KG) nonlinear lattices, a central open question is whether the motion\ncontinues to be chaotic despite decreasing densities, or tends to become\nquasi-periodic as nonlinear terms become negligible. In a recent study of such\nKG particle chains with quartic (4th order) anharmonicity in the on-site\npotential, it was shown that $q-$Gaussian probability distribution functions of\nsums of position observables with $q > 1$ always approach pure Gaussians\n($q=1$) in the long time limit and hence the motion of the full system is\nultimately \"strongly chaotic\". In the present paper, we show that these results\ncontinue to hold even when a sextic (6th order) term is gradually added to the\npotential and ultimately prevails over the 4th order anharmonicity, despite\nexpectations that the dynamics is more \"regular\", at least in the regime of\nsmall oscillations. Analyzing this system in the subdiffusive energy domain\nusing $q$-statistics, we demonstrate that groups of oscillators centered around\nthe initially excited one (as well as the full chain) possess strongly chaotic\ndynamics and are thus far from any quasi-periodic torus, for times as long as\n$t=10^9$.\n", "  We study the violation of Bell-Mermin-Klyshko (BMK) inequalities in initial\nquantum states of scalar fields in inflation. We show that the Bell inequality\nis maximally violated by the Bunch-Davies vacuum which is a two-mode squeezed\nstate of a scalar field. However, we find that the violation of the BMK\ninequalities does not increase with the number of modes to measure. We then\nconsider a non-Bunch-Davies vacuum expressed by a four-mode squeezed state of\ntwo scalar fields. Remarkably, we find that the violation of the BMK\ninequalities increases exponentially with the number of modes to measure. This\nindicates that some evidence that our universe has a quantum mechanical origin\nmay survive in CMB data even if quantum entanglement decays exponentially\nafterward due to decoherence.\n", "  The resolution of linear system with positive integer variables is a basic\nyet difficult computational problem with many applications. We consider sparse\nuncorrelated random systems parametrised by the density $c$ and the ratio\n$\\alpha=N/M$ between number of variables $N$ and number of constraints $M$. By\nmeans of ensemble calculations we show that the space of feasible solutions\nendows a Van-Der-Waals phase diagram in the plane ($c$, $\\alpha$). We give\nnumerical evidence that the associated computational problems become more\ndifficult across the critical point and in particular in the coexistence\nregion.\n", "  We propose an alternative evaluation of quantum entanglement by measuring the\nmaximum violation of the Bell's inequality without performing a partial trace\noperation. This proposal is demonstrated by bridging the maximum violation of\nthe Bell's inequality and the concurrence of a pure state in an $n$-qubit\nsystem, in which one subsystem only contains one qubit and the state is a\nlinear combination of two product states. We apply this relation to the ground\nstates of four qubits in the Wen-Plaquette model and show that they are\nmaximally entangled. A topological entanglement entropy of the Wen-Plaquette\nmodel could be obtained by relating the upper bound of the maximum violation of\nthe Bell's inequality to the concurrences of a pure state with respect to\ndifferent bipartitions.\n", "  Shortcuts to adiabaticity have been proposed to speed up the \"slow\" adiabatic\ntransport of an atom or a wave packet of atoms. However, the freedom of the\ninverse engineering approach with appropriate boundary conditions provides\nthousands of trap trajectories for different purposes, for example, time and\nenergy minimizations. In this paper, we propose trigonometric protocols for\nfast and robust atomic transport, taking into account cubic or quartic\nanharmonicities. The numerical results have illustrated that such trigonometric\nprotocols, particular cosine ansatz, is more robust and the corresponding final\nenergy excitation is smaller, as compared to sine trajectories implemented in\nprevious experiments.\n", "  We discuss the role of meson exchange mechanisms in $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ scattering. Several pseudoscalar ($\\pi^0$, $\\eta$, $\\eta'(958)$,\n$\\eta_c(1S)$, $\\eta_c(2S)$), scalar ($f_{0}(500)$, $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$,\n$f_0(1370)$, $\\chi_{c0}(1P)$) and tensor ($f_2(1270)$, $a_2(1320)$,\n$f_2'(1525)$, $f_2(1565)$, $a_2(1700)$) mesons are taken into account. We\nconsider not only $s$-channel but also for the first time $t$- and $u$-channel\nmeson exchange amplitudes corrected for off-shell effects including vertex form\nfactors. We find that, depending on not well known vertex form factors, the\nmeson exchange amplitudes interfere among themselves and could interfere with\nfermion-box amplitudes and modify the resulting cross sections. The meson\ncontributions are shown as a function of collision energy as well as angular\ndistributions are presented. Interesting interference effects separately for\nlight pseudoscalar, scalar and tensor meson groups are discussed. The meson\nexchange contributions may be potentially important in the context of a\nmeasurement performed recently in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions by\nthe ATLAS collaboration. The light-by-light interactions could be studied in\nfuture in electron-positron collisions by the Belle II at SuperKEKB\naccelerator.\n", "  Thin rigid sheets floating on a liquid substrate appear, for example, in\ncoatings and surfactant monolayers. Upon uniaxial compression the sheet\nundergoes transitions from a compressed flat state to a periodic wrinkled\npattern to a localized folded pattern. The stability of these states is\ndetermined by the in-plane elasticity of the sheet, its bending rigidity, and\nthe hydrostatics of the underlying liquid. Wrinkles and folds, and the\nwrinkle-to-fold transition, were previously studied for incompressible sheets.\nIn the present work we extend the theory to include finite compressibility. We\nanalyze the details of the flat-to-wrinkle transition, the effects of\ncompressibility on wrinkling and folding, and the compression field associated\nwith the pattern formation. The state diagram of the floating sheet including\nall three states is presented.\n", "  We study integrability properties of a reversible deterministic cellular\nautomaton (the rule 54 of [Bobenko et al., Commun. Math. Phys. 158, 127\n(1993)]) and present a bulk algebraic relation and its inhomogeneous extension\nwhich allow for an explicit construction of Liouvillian decay modes for two\ndistinct families of stochastic boundary driving. The spectrum of the many-body\nstochastic matrix defining the time propagation is found to separate into sets,\nwhich we call orbitals, and the eigenvalues in each orbital are found to obey a\ndistinct set of Bethe-like equations. We construct the decay modes in the first\norbital (containing the leading decay mode) in terms of an exact inhomogeneous\nmatrix product ansatz, study the thermodynamic properties of the spectrum and\nthe scaling of its gap, and provide a conjecture for the Bethe-like equations\nfor all the orbitals and their degeneracy.\n", "  Serpentine interconnects are highly stretchable and frequently used in\nflexible electronic systems. In this work, we show that the undulating geometry\nof the serpentine interconnects will generate phononic band gaps to manipulate\nelastic wave propagation. The interesting effect of `bands-sticking-together'\nis observed. We further illustrate that the band structures of the serpentine\ninterconnects can be tuned by applying pre-stretch deformation. The discovery\noffers a way to design stretchable and tunable phononic crystals by using\nmetallic interconnects instead of the conventional design with soft rubbers and\nunfavorable damping.\n", "  The recently-introduced self-learning Monte Carlo method is a general-purpose\nnumerical method that speeds up Monte Carlo simulations by training an\neffective model to propose uncorrelated configurations in the Markov chain. We\nimplement this method in the framework of continuous time Monte Carlo method\nwith auxiliary field in quantum impurity models. We introduce and train a\ndiagram generating function (DGF) to model the probability distribution of\nauxiliary field configurations in continuous imaginary time, at all orders of\ndiagrammatic expansion. By using DGF to propose global moves in configuration\nspace, we show that the self-learning continuous-time Monte Carlo method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational complexity of the simulation.\n", "  We examine knotted solutions, the most simple of which is the \"Hopfion\", from\nthe point of view of relations between electromagnetism and ideal fluid\ndynamics. A map between fluid dynamics and electromagnetism works for initial\nconditions or for linear perturbations, allowing us to find new knotted fluid\nsolutions. Knotted solutions are also found to to be solutions of nonlinear\ngeneralizations of electromagnetism, and of quantum-corrected actions for\nelectromagnetism coupled to other modes. For null configurations,\nelectromagnetism can be described as a null pressureless fluid, for which we\ncan find solutions from the knotted solutions of electromagnetism. We also map\nthem to solutions of Euler's equations, obtained from a type of nonrelativistic\nreduction of the relativistic fluid equations.\n", "  We revisit the 1/2-BPS D-branes on the AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ background. Based\nonly on the classification of 1/2-BPS D-branes obtained by the covariant open\nstring description, we consider various purely static configurations of\nD-branes without any worldvolume flux on the AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ background.\nUnder the covariant $\\kappa$ symmetry fixing condition, we investigate which\npart the spacetime supersymmetries is preserved on the D-brane worldvolume and\nobtain the associated worldvolume supersymmetry transformation rules to leading\norder in the worldvolume fluctuating fields. It is shown that, for purely\nstatic configurations without any worldvolume flux, only the AdS type D-branes,\nin which the AdS radial direction is one of worldvolume coordinates, are\n1/2-BPS.\n", "  We consider the path integral associated to the Moyal formalism for quantum\nmechanics extended to contain higher differential forms by means of Grassmann\nodd fields. After revisiting some properties of the functional integral\nassociated to the (super-extended) Moyal formalism, we give a convenient\nfunctional derivation of the BBGKY hierarchy in this framework. In this case\nthe distribution functions depend also on the Grassmann odd fields.\n", "  In this paper we study the future global existence and late-time behaviour of\nthe Einstein-Boltzmann system with Bianchi I symmetry and a positive\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda>0$. For the Boltzmann equation we consider the\nscattering kernel of Israel particles which are the relativistic counterpart of\nMaxwellian particles. Under a smallness assumption on initial data in a\nsuitable norm we show that solutions exist globally in time and isotropize at\nlate times.\n", "  We investigate structure of $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$ and discuss the difference\nand similarity between the structures of $^{12}{\\rm C}$ and $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm\nC}$ by answering the questions if the linear-chain and gaslike cluster states,\nwhich are proposed to appear in $^{12}{\\rm C}$, survives, or new structure\nstates appear or not. We introduce a microscopic cluster model called,\nHyper-Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\\\"opke (H-THSR) wave function, which is an\nextended version of the THSR wave function so as to describe $\\Lambda$\nhypernuclei. We obtained two bound states and two resonance (quasi-bound)\nstates for $J^\\pi=0^+$ in $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$, corresponding to the four\n$0^+$ states in $^{12}{\\rm C}$. However, the inversion of level ordering\nbetween the spectra of $^{12}{\\rm C}$ and $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$, i.e. that the\n$0_3^+$ and $0_4^+$ states in $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$ correspond to the $0_4^+$\nand $0_3^+$ states in $^{12}{\\rm C}$, respectively, is shown to occur. The\nadditional $\\Lambda$ particle reduces sizes of the $0_2^+$ and $0_3^+$ states\nin $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$ very much, but the shrinkage of the $0_4^+$ state is\nonly a half of the other states. In conclusion, the Hoyle state becomes quite a\ncompact object with ${^{9}_\\Lambda{\\rm Be}}+\\alpha$ configuration in\n$^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$ and is no more gaslike state composed of the $3\\alpha$\nclusters. Instead, the $0_4^+$ state in $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$, coming from the\n$^{12}{\\rm C}(0_3^+)$ state, appears as a gaslike state composed of\n$\\alpha+\\alpha+^{5}_\\Lambda{\\rm He}$ configuration, i.e. the Hoyle analog\nstate. A linear-chain state in a $\\Lambda$ hypernucleus is for the first time\npredicted to exist as the $0_3^+$ state in $^{13}_\\Lambda{\\rm C}$ with more\nshrunk arrangement of the $3\\alpha$ clusters along $z$-axis than the $3\\alpha$\nlinear-chain configuration realized in the $^{12}{\\rm C}(0_4^+)$ state.\n", "  The NA62 experiment recorded a large sample of $K^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+\n\\nu_{\\mu}$ decays in 2007. A peak search has been performed in the\nreconstructed missing mass spectrum. In the absence of a signal, limits in the\nrange $2 \\times 10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ have been set on the squared mixing\nmatrix element $|U_{\\mu4} |^2$ between muon and heavy neutrino states, for\nheavy neutrino masses in the range 300-375 MeV/$c^2$. The result extends the\nrange of masses for which upper limits have been set on the value of $|U_{\\mu4}\n|^2$ in previous production search experiments.\n", "  The interplay between dissipation, interactions and gauge fields opens the\npossibility to rich emerging physics. Here we focus on a set-up in which the\nsystem is coupled at its extremities to two different baths which impose a\ncurrent. We then study the system's response to a gauge field depending on the\nfilling. We show that while the current induced by the baths has a marked\ndependence on the magnetic field at low fillings which is significantly reduced\nclose to half-filling. We explain the interplay between interactions, gauge\nfield and dissipation by studying the system's energy spectrum at the different\nfillings. This interplay also results in the emergence of negative differential\nconductivity. For this study we have developed a number-conserving treatment\nwhich allows a numerical exact treatment of fairly large system sizes, and\nwhich can be extended to a large class of systems.\n", "  We use classical Monte Carlo calculations to model the high-pressure behavior\nof the phase transition in the helical magnets. We vary values of the exchange\ninteraction constant J and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant D,\nwhich is equivalent to changing spin-spin distances, as occurs in real systems\nunder pressure. The system under study is self-similar at D/ J = constant, and\nits properties are defined by the single variable J / T , where T is\ntemperature. The existence of the first order phase transition critically\ndepends on the ratio D / J. A variation of J strongly affects the phase\ntransition temperature and width of the fluctuation region (the hump) as\nfollows from the system self-similarity. The high-pressure behavior of the spin\nsystem depends on the evolution of the interaction constants J and D on\ncompression. Our calculations are relevant to the high pressure phase diagrams\nof helical magnets MnSi and Cu2OSeO3.\n", "  We present an account of the current status of the theoretical treatment of\ninclusive $(d,p)$ reactions in the breakup-fusion formalism, pointing to some\napplications and making the connection with current experimental capabilities.\nThree independent implementations of the reaction formalism have been recently\ndeveloped, making use of different numerical strategies. The codes also\noriginally relied on two different but equivalent representations, namely the\nprior (Udagawa-Tamura, UT) and the post (Ichimura-Austern-Vincent, IAV)\nrepresentations.\n  The different implementations have been benchmarked, and then applied to the\nCa isotopic chain. The neutron-Ca propagator is described in the Dispersive\nOptical Model (DOM) framework, and the interplay between elastic breakup (EB)\nand non-elastic breakup (NEB) is studied for three Ca isotopes at two different\nbombarding energies. The accuracy of the description of different reaction\nobservables is assessed by comparing with experimental data of $(d,p)$ on\n$^{40,48}$Ca. We discuss the predictions of the model for the extreme case of\nan isotope ($^{60}$Ca) currently unavailable experimentally, though possibly\navailable in future facilities (nominally within production reach at FRIB). We\nexplore the use of $(d,p)$ reactions as surrogates for $(n,\\gamma)$ processes,\nby using the formalism to describe the compound nucleus formation in a\n$(d,p\\gamma)$ reaction as a function of excitation energy, spin, and parity.\nThe subsequent decay is then computed within a Hauser-Feshbach formalism.\nComparisons between the $(d,p\\gamma)$ and $(n,\\gamma)$ induced gamma decay\nspectra are discussed to inform efforts to infer neutron captures from\n$(d,p\\gamma)$ reactions. Finally, we identify areas of opportunity for future\ndevelopments, and discuss a possible path toward a predictive reaction theory.\n", "  A significant fraction of extended radio sources presents a peculiar X-shaped\nradio morphology: in addition to the classical double lobed structure, radio\nemission is also observed along a second axis of simmetry in the form of\ndiffuse wings or tails. In a previous investigation we showed the existence of\na connection between the radio morphology and the properties of the host\ngalaxies. Motivated by this connection we performed two-dimensional numerical\nsimulations showing that X-shaped radio sources may naturally form as a jet\npropagates along the major axis a highly elliptical density distribution,\nbecause of the fast expansion of the cocoon along the minor axis of the\ndistribution.\n  We intend to extend our analysis by performing three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations and investigating the role of different parameters is determining\nthe formation of the X-shaped morphology.\n  The problem is addressed by numerical means, carrying out three-dimensional\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of bidirectional jets propagating\nin a triaxial density distribution.\n  We show that only jets with power $\\lesssim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can give\norigin to an X-shaped morphology and that a misalignment of $30^o$ between the\njet axis and the major axis of the density distribution is still favourable to\nthe formation of this kind of morphology. In addition we compute synthetic\nradio emission maps and polarization maps.\n  In our scenario for the formation of X-shaped radio sources only low power\nFRII can give origin to such kind of morphology. Our synthetic emission maps\nshow that the different observed morphologies of X-shaped sources can be the\nresult of similar structures viewed under different perspectives.\n", "  The process of pattern formation for a multi-species model anchored on a time\nvarying network is studied. A non homogeneous perturbation superposed to an\nhomogeneous stable fixed point can amplify, as follows a novel mechanism of\ninstability, reminiscent of the Turing type, instigated by the network\ndynamics. By properly tuning the frequency of the imposed network evolution,\none can make the examined system behave as its averaged counterpart, over a\nfinite time window. This is the key observation to derive a closed analytical\nprediction for the onset of the instability in the time dependent framework.\nContinuously and piecewise constant periodic time varying networks will be\nanalysed, to set the ground for the proposed approach. The extension to non\nperiodic settings will also be discussed.\n", "  Radio interferometry most commonly involves antennas or antenna arrays of\nidentical design. The identical antenna assumption leads to a convenient and\nuseful mathematical simplification resulting in a scalar problem. An\ninteresting variant to this is a \"hybrid\" interferometer involving two designs.\nWe encounter this in the characterization of low-frequency antenna/array\nprototypes using a homogenous low-frequency array telescope such as the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA). In this work, we present an interferometry\nequation that applies to hybrid antennas. The resulting equation involves\nvector inner products rather than scalar multiplications. We discuss physical\ninterpretation and useful applications of this concept in the areas of\nsensitivity measurement and calibration of an antenna/array under test using a\ncompact calibrator source.\n", "  We report on the observation of the motional Stark effect of highly excited\n$^{87}$Rb Rydberg atoms moving in the presence of a weak homogeneous magnetic\nfield in a vapor cell. Employing electromagnetically induced transparency for\nspectroscopy of an atomic vapor, we observe the velocity-, quantum state- and\nmagnetic field-dependent transition frequencies between the ground and Rydberg\nexcited states. For atoms moving at velocities around $400\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, the\nprincipal quantum number $n=100$ of the valence electron, and a magnetic field\nof $B=100\\,\\mathrm{G}$, we measure a motional Stark shift of\n$\\sim10\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. Our experimental results are supported by numerical\ncalculations based on a diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian governing\nthe valence electron of $^{87}$Rb in the presence of crossed electric and\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  The differential equation proposed by Frits Zernike to obtain a basis of\npolynomial orthogonal solutions on the the unit disk to classify wavefront\naberrations in circular pupils, is shown to have a set of new orthonormal\nsolution bases, involving Legendre and Gegenbauer polynomials, in\nnon-orthogonal coordinates close to Cartesian ones. We find the overlaps\nbetween the original Zernike basis and a representative of the new set, which\nturn out to be Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n", "  In this paper, a scheme is put forward to design pulses which drive a\nthree-level system based on the reverse engineering with Lewis-Riesenfeld\ninvariant theory. The scheme can be applied to a three-level system even when\nthe rotating-wave approximation (RWA) can not be used. The amplitudes of pulses\nand the maximal values of detunings in the system could be easily controlled by\nadjusting control parameters. We analyze the dynamics of the system by an\ninvariant operator, so additional couplings are unnecessary. Moreover, the\napproaches to avoid singularity of pulses are studied and several useful\nresults are obtained. We hope the scheme could contribute to fast quantum\ninformation processing without RWA.\n", "  We consider a particular set of two-point functions in the setting of N = 4\nSYM with a defect, dual to the fuzzy-funnel solution for the probe D5-D3-brane\nsystem. The two-point functions in focus involve a single trace operator in the\nSU(2)-subsector of arbitrary length and a length-two operator built out of any\nscalars. By interpreting the contractions as a spin-chain operator, simple\nexpressions were found for the leading contribution to the two-point functions,\nmapping them to earlier known formulas for the one-point functions in this\nsetting.\n", "  We study second-harmonic generation (SHG) arising from surface nonlinearity\nat a metal-dielectric interface using a spectral decomposition method. Since\nour method avoids the need to consider the generalized boundary condition\nacross the metal-dielectric interface in the presence of a perpendicular\nsurface source, we retrieve the known discontinuity of the tangential component\nof the electric field ($E_{\\parallel}^ {2\\omega}$) for a general geometry,\nbased on a purely mathematical argument. Further, we reaffirm the standard\nconvention of the implementation of this condition, namely, that the surface\ndipole source radiates as if placed outside the metal surface for arbitrary\ngeometries. We also study and explain the spectral dependence of the\ndiscontinuity of the tangential component of the electric field at second\nharmonic. Finally, we note that the default settings of the commercial\nnumerical package COMSOL Multiphysics fail to account for the $E_{\\parallel}^\n{2\\omega}$-discontinuity. We provide a simple recipe that corrects the boundary\ncondition within these existing settings.\n", "  We study turbulent channel flows of monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions\nof finite-size spheres by means of Direct Numerical Simulations using an\nimmersed boundary method to account for the dispersed phase. Suspensions with 3\ndifferent Gaussian distributions of particle radii are considered (i.e. 3\ndifferent standard deviations). The distributions are centered on the reference\nparticle radius of the monodisperse suspension. In the most extreme case, the\nradius of the largest particles is 4 times that of the smaller particles. We\nconsider two different solid volume fractions, 2% and 10%. We find that for all\npolydisperse cases, both fluid and particles statistics are not substantially\naltered with respect to those of the monodisperse case. Mean streamwise fluid\nand particle velocity profiles are almost perfectly overlapping. Slightly\nlarger differences are found for particle velocity fluctuations. These increase\nclose to the wall and decrease towards the centerline as the standard deviation\nof the distribution is increased. Hence, the behavior of the suspension is\nmostly governed by excluded volume effects regardless of particle size\ndistribution (at least for the radii here studied). Due to turbulent mixing,\nparticles are uniformly distributed across the channel. However, smaller\nparticles can penetrate more into the viscous and buffer layer and velocity\nfluctuations are therein altered. Non trivial results are presented for\nparticle-pair statistics.\n", "  Close to equilibrium, the exchange of particles and heat between macroscopic\nsystems at different temperatures and different chemical potentials is known to\nbe governed by a matrix of transport coefficients which is positive and\nsymmetric. We investigate the amounts of heat and particles that are exchanged\nbetween two small quantum systems within a given time, and find them\ncharacterized by a transport matrix which neither needs to be symmetric nor\npositive. At larger times even spontaneous transport can be observed in the\ntotal absence of temperature and chemical potential differences provided that\nthe two systems are different in size. All these deviations from standard\ntransport behavior can be attributed to the fact that work is done on the\nsystem in the processes contacting and separating those parts of the system\nthat initially possess different temperatures and chemical potentials. The\nstandard transport properties are recovered for vanishing work and also in the\nlimit of large systems and sufficiently large contact times. The general\nresults are illustrated by an example.\n", "  Recently, our efforts to clarify the old question, if a memristor is a\npassive or active device [1], triggered debates between engineers, who have had\nadvanced definitions of passivity/activity of devices, and physicists with\nsignificantly different views about this seemingly simple question. This debate\ntriggered our efforts to test the well-known engineering concepts about\npassivity/activity in a deeper way, challenging them by statistical physics. It\nis shown that the advanced engineering definition of passivity/activity of\ndevices is self-contradictory when a thermodynamical system executing\nJohnson-Nyquist noise is present. A new, statistical physical, self-consistent\ndefinition based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics is introduced. It is also\nshown that, in a system with uniform temperature distribution, any rectifier\ncircuitry that can rectify thermal noise must contain an active circuit\nelement, according to both the engineering and statistical physical\ndefinitions.\n", "  Observations of the solar butterfly diagram from sunspot records suggest\npersistent fluctuation in parity, away from the overall, approximately dipolar\nstructure. We use a simple mean-field dynamo model with a solar-like rotation\nlaw, and perturb the $\\alpha$-effect. We find that the parity of the magnetic\nfield with respect to the rotational equator can demonstrate what we describe\nas resonant behaviour, while the magnetic energy behaves in a more or less\nexpected way. We discuss possible applications of the phenomena in the context\nof various deviations of the solar magnetic field from dipolar symmetry, as\nreported from analysis of archival sunspot data. We deduce that our model\nproduces fluctuations in field parity, and hence in the butterfly diagram, that\nare consistent with observed fluctaions in solar behaviour.\n", "  Collisional fragmentation is shown to not be a barrier to rocky planet\nformation at small distances from the host star. Simple analytic arguments\ndemonstrate that rocky planet formation via collisions of homogeneous\ngravity-dominated bodies is possible down to distances of order the Roche\nradius ($r_\\mathrm{Roche}$). Extensive N-body simulations with initial bodies\n${\\gtrsim}1700$ km that include plausible models for fragmentation and merging\nof gravity-dominated bodies confirm this conclusion and demonstrate that rocky\nplanet formation is possible down to ${\\sim}$1.1 $r_\\mathrm{Roche}$. At smaller\ndistances, tidal effects cause collisions to be too fragmenting to allow mass\nbuild-up to a final, dynamically stable planetary system. We argue that even\ndifferentiated bodies can accumulate to form planets at distances that are not\nmuch larger than $r_\\mathrm{Roche}$.\n", "  We propose a graphene-on-grating nanostructure to enable second-order spatial\ndifferentiation computation in terahertz (THz) region. The differentiation\noperation is based on the interference between the direct reflected field and\nthe leakage of two excited surface plasmon polaritons counter-propagating along\nthe graphene sheet. With the spatial coupled-mode theory, we derive out that\nthe requirement for the second-order spatial differentiation is the critical\ncoupling condition. We numerically demonstrate such an analog computation with\nGaussian beams. It shows that the spatial bandwidth of the proposed\ndifferentiator is large enough such that even when the waist radius of the\nGaussian beam is as narrow as ${{w}_{0}}=0.68\\lambda $ ($\\lambda $ is the\nfree-space wavelength), the accuracy of the differentiator is higher than 95\\%.\nThe proposed differentiator is ultra-compact, with a thickness less than\n$0.1\\lambda $, and useful for real-time imaging applications in THz security\ndetections.\n", "  The structural and electronic properties of amorphous silicon ($a$-Si) are\ninvestigated by first-principles calculations based on the density-functional\ntheory (DFT), focusing on the intrinsic structural defects. By simulated\nmelting and quenching of a crystalline silicon model through the Car-Parrinello\nmolecular dynamics (CPMD), we generate several different $a$-Si samples, in\nwhich three-fold ($T_3$), five-fold ($T_5$), and anomalous four-fold ($T_{4a}$)\ndefects are contained. Using the samples, we clarify how the disordered\nstructure of $a$-Si affects the characters of its density of states (DOS). We\nsubsequently study the properties of defect complexes found in the obtained\nsamples, including one that comprises three $T_5$ defects, and we show the\nconditions for the defect complexes to be energetically stable. Finally, we\ninvestigate the hydrogen passivation process of the $T_5$ defects in $a$-Si and\nshow that the hydrogenation of $T_5$ is an exothermic reaction and that the\nactivation energy for a H$_2$ molecule to passivate two $T_5$ sites is\ncalculated to be 1.05 eV.\n", "  The recent LHCb measurement of $R_{K^*}$ in two $q^2$ bins, when combined\nwith the earlier measurement of $R_K$, strongly suggests lepton flavour\nnon-universal new physics in semi-leptonic $B$ meson decays. Motivated by these\nintriguing hints of new physics, several authors have considered vector, axial\nvector, scalar and pseudo scalar operators as possible explanations of these\nmeasurements. However, tensor operators have widely been neglected in this\ncontext. In this paper, we consider the effect of tensor operators in $R_K$ and\n$R_{K^*}$. We find that, unlike other local operators, tensor operators can\ncomfortably produce both of $R_{K^*} ^{\\rm low}$ and $R_{K^*} ^{\\rm central}$\nclose to their experimental central values. However, a simultaneous explanation\nof $R_K$ is not possible with only Tensor operators, and other vector or axial\nvector operators are needed. In fact, we find that combination of vector and\ntensor operators can provide simultaneous explanations of all the anomalies\ncomfortably at the $1 \\sigma$ level, a scenario which is hard to achieve with\nonly vector or axial vector operators. We also comment on the compatibility of\nthe various new physics solutions with the measurements of the inclusive decay\n$B_d \\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$.\n", "  GRB 160625B, one of the brightest bursts in recent years, was simultaneously\nobserved by Fermi and Swift satellites, and ground-based optical telescopes in\nthree different events separated by long periods of time. In this paper the\nnon-thermal multiwavelength observations of GRB 160625B are described and a\ntransition phase from wind-type-like medium to interstellar medium between the\nearly (event II) and the late (event III) afterglow is found. The\nmultiwavelength observations of the early afterglow are consistent with the\nafterglow evolution starting at $\\sim$ 150 s in a stellar wind medium whereas\nthe observations of the late afterglow are consistent with the afterglow\nevolution in interstellar medium (ISM). The wind-to-ISM transition is\ncalculated to be at $\\sim 8\\times 10^3$ s when the jet has decelerated, at a\ndistance of $\\sim$ 1 pc from the progenitor. Using the standard external shock\nmodel, the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from reverse shock\nis required to model the GeV $\\gamma$-ray and optical observations in the early\nafterglow, and synchrotron radiation from the adiabatic forward shock to\ndescribe the X-ray and optical observations in the late afterglow. The derived\nvalues of the magnetization parameter, the slope of the fast decay of the\noptical flash and the inferred magnetic fields suggest that Poynting\nflux-dominated jet models with arbitrary magnetization could account for the\nspectral properties exhibited by GRB 160625B.\n", "  The geometry of twisted null geodesic congruences in gravitational plane wave\nspacetimes is explored, with special focus on homogeneous plane waves. The role\nof twist in the relation of the Rosen coordinates adapted to a null congruence\nwith the fundamental Brinkmann coordinates is explained and a generalised form\nof the Rosen metric describing a gravitational plane wave is derived. The\nKilling vectors and isometry algebra of homogeneous plane waves (HPWs) are\ndescribed in both Brinkmann and twisted Rosen form and used to demonstrate the\ncoset space structure of HPWs. The van Vleck-Morette determinant for twisted\ncongruences is evaluated in both Brinkmann and Rosen descriptions. The twisted\nnull congruences of the Ozsvath-Schucking,`anti-Mach' plane wave are\ninvestigated in detail. These developments provide the necessary geometric\ntoolkit for future investigations of the role of twist in loop effects in\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime, where gravitational plane waves arise\ngenerically as Penrose limits; in string theory, where they are important as\nstring backgrounds; and potentially in the detection of gravitational waves in\nastronomy.\n", "  In this paper we study an $AdS_5$ solution constructed using non-Abelian\nT-duality, acting on the Klebanov-Witten background. We show that this is dual\nto a linear quiver with two tails of gauge groups of increasing rank. The field\ntheory dynamics arises from a D4-NS5-NS5' brane set-up, generalizing the\nconstructions discussed by Bah and Bobev. These realize $\\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver\ngauge theories built out of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\\mathcal{N}=2$ vector\nmultiplets flowing to interacting fixed points in the infrared. We compute the\ncentral charge using $a$-maximization, and show its precise agreement with the\nholographic calculation. Our result exhibits $n^3$ scaling with the number of\nfive-branes. This suggests an eleven-dimensional interpretation in terms of\nM5-branes, a generic feature of various $AdS$ backgrounds obtained via\nnon-Abelian T-duality.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the propagation of the light pulse reflected\nfrom the layer system with a graphene layer. We show a tunable transition\nbetween positive and negative group delay of the optical pulse reflection in\nsuch a layered system controlled by the properties of the graphene layer, and\nreveal two mechanisms to control the propagation properties of the light\nreflected from such systems. It is demonstrated that the reflected group delays\nare greatly tunable from positive and negative values in both mechanisms of\nresonances and the excitations of the surface plasmon resonances, which are\nadjusted by tuning the Fermi energy and temperature of the graphene layer. Our\nresults are helpful to control the pulse propagations and are useful for design\nof graphene-based optical devices.\n", "  A two-dimensional arrangement of quantum dots with finite inter-dot tunnel\ncoupling provides a promising platform for studying complicated spin\ncorrelations as well as for constructing large-scale quantum computers. Here,\nwe fabricate a tunnel-coupled triangular triple quantum dot with a novel gate\ngeometry in which three dots are defined by positively biasing the surface\ngates. At the same time, the small area in the center of the triangle is\ndepleted by negatively biasing the top gate placed above the surface gates. The\nsize of the small center depleted area is estimated from the Aharonov-Bohm\noscillation measured for the triangular channel but incorporating no\ngate-defined dots, with a value consistent with the design. With this approach,\nwe can bring the neighboring gate-defined dots close enough to one another to\nmaintain a finite inter-dot tunnel coupling. We finally confirm the presence of\nthe inter-dot tunnel couplings in the triple quantum dot from the measurement\nof tunneling current through the dots in the stability diagram. We also show\nthat the charge occupancy of each dot and that the inter-dot tunnel couplings\nare tunable with gate voltages.\n", "  Ablation fronts and shocks are two radiative/hydrodynamic features ubiquitous\nin inertial confinement fusion (ICF). A specially designed shock-tube\nexperiment was tested on the OMEGA laser facility to observe these two features\nevolve at once and to assess thermodynamical and radiative properties. It is a\nbasic science experiment aimed at improving our understanding of shocked and\nablated matter which is critical to ICF design. At all time, these two moving\n\"interfaces\" separate the tube into three distinct zones where matter is either\nablated, shocked or unshocked. The {\\it simple-flux} or {\\it double-flux}\nexperiments, respectively one or two halfraum-plus-tube, have been thought up\nto observe and image these zones using x-ray and visible image diagnostic. The\npossibility of observing all three regions at once was instrumental in our new\nradiographic image processing used to remove the backlighter background\notherwise detrimental to quantitative measurement. By so doing, after\nprocessing the radiographic images of the 15 shots accumulated during the 2013\nand 2015 campaigns, a quantitative comparison between experiments and our\nradiative hydrocode simulations was made possible. Several points of the\nprincipal Hugoniot of the aerogel used as a light material in the shock-tube\nwere inferred from that comparison. Most surprisingly, rapid variations of\nrelative-transmission in the ablated region were observed during radiographic\nirradiations while it remained constant in the shocked region. This effect\nmight be attributed to the spectral distribution variability of the backlighter\nduring the radiographic pulse. Numerically, that distribution is strongly\ndependent upon NLTE models and it could potentially be used as a mean to\ndiscriminate among them.\n", "  Femtosecond laser writing is applied to form Bragg grating waveguides in the\ndiamond bulk. Type II waveguides are integrated with a single pulse\npoint-by-point periodic laser modification positioned towards the edge of the\nwaveguide core. These photonic devices, operating in the telecommunications\nband, allow for simultaneous optical waveguiding and narrowband reflection from\na 4th order grating. This fabrication technology opens the way towards advanced\n3D photonic networks in diamond for a range of applications.\n", "  In order to fully exploit the potential of transition metal dichalcogenide\nmonolayers (TMD-MLs), the well-controlled creation of atomically sharp lateral\nheterojunctions within these materials is highly desirable. A promising\napproach to create such heterojunctions is the local modulation of the\nelectronic structure of an intrinsic TMD-ML via dielectric screening induced by\nits surrounding materials. For the realization of this non-invasive approach,\nan in-depth understanding of such dielectric effects is required. We report on\nthe modulations of excitonic transitions in TMD-MLs through the effect of\ndielectric environments including low-k and high-k dielectric materials. We\npresent absolute tuning ranges as large as 37 meV for the optical band gaps of\nWSe 2 and MoSe 2 MLs and relative tuning ranges on the order of 30% for the\nbinding energies of neutral excitons in WSe 2 MLs. The findings suggest the\npossibility to reduce the electronic band gap of WSe 2 MLs by 120 meV, paving\nthe way towards dielectrically defined lateral heterojunctions.\n", "  The decay of $\\alpha$ particle from a nucleus is viewed as a quantum\nresonance state of a two-body scattering process of the $\\alpha$+daughter\nnucleus pair governed by a novel nucleus-nucleus potential in squared\nWoods-Saxon form. By the application of the rigorous optical model (OM)\npotential scattering (S-matrix) theory the genuineness of the potential for the\nsystem is established by giving good explanation of the elastic scattering and\nreaction cross sections data of the $\\alpha$+nucleus pair. From the pole\nposition in the complex momentum (k) plane of the S-matrix defined above, the\nenergy and width of the resonance state akin to the decaying state of emission\nof $\\alpha$ particle are extracted and from this width, the result of\n$\\alpha$-decay half-life is derived to account for the experimental result of\nhalf-life in the cases of large number of $\\alpha$-emitters including heavy and\nsuper-heavy nuclei. The S-matrix of the full OM calculation above is replaced\nby an analytical function expressed in terms of exact Schr\\\"{o}dinger solutions\nof a global potential that closely represents the Coulomb-nuclear interaction\nin the interior and the pure Coulomb wave functions outside, and the resonant\npoles of this S-matrix in the complex momentum plane are used to give\nsatisfactory results of decay half-lives of $\\alpha$ coming out from varieties\nof nuclei.\n", "  We describe magnetic reconnection experiments using a new, pulsed-power\ndriven experimental platform in which the inflows are super-sonic but\nsub-Alfv\\'enic.The intrinsically magnetised plasma flows are long lasting,\nproducing a well-defined reconnection layer that persists over many\nhydrodynamic time scales.The layer is diagnosed using a suite of high\nresolution laser based diagnostics which provide measurements of the electron\ndensity, reconnecting magnetic field, inflow and outflow velocities and the\nelectron and ion temperatures.Using these measurements we observe a balance\nbetween the power flow into and out of the layer, and we find that the heating\nrates for the electrons and ions are significantly in excess of the classical\npredictions. The formation of plasmoids is observed in laser interferometry and\noptical self-emission, and the magnetic O-point structure of these plasmoids is\nconfirmed using magnetic probes.\n", "  We report on growth of tin (Sn) metal whiskers that is significantly\naccelerated under gamma-ray irradiation. The studied Sn thin film, evaporated\non glass substrate, was subjected to a total of ~60 hours of irradiation over\nthe course of 30 days. The irradiated sample demonstrated the enhanced\ndevelopment, in both whisker densities and lengths, resulting in an\nacceleration factor of ~50. This makes gamma-ray irradiation a candidate tool\nfor accelerated testing of whisker propensity. We attribute the observed\nenhancement to electrostatic fields created by charged defects in the glass\nsubstrate under ionizing radiation of gamma-rays.\n", "  Complete integrability and multisoliton solutions are discussed for a\nmulticomponent Ablowitz-Ladik system with branched dispersion relation. It is\nalso shown that starting from a \"diagonal\" (in two-dimensions) completely\nintegrable Ablowitz-Ladik equation, one can obtain all the results using a\nperiodic reduction.\n", "  Observations of X-ray absorption lines in magnetically driven disk winds\naround black hole binaries and active galactic nuclei yield a universal radial\ndensity profile rho proportional to r^{-1.2} in the wind. This is in\ndisagreement with the standard Blandford & Payne profile rho_BP proportional to\nr^{-1.5} expected when the magnetic field is neither advected nor diffusing\nthrough the accretion disk. In order to account for this discrepancy, we\nestablish a new paradigm for magnetically driven astrophysical winds according\nto which the large scale ordered magnetic field that threads the disk is\ncontinuously generated by the Cosmic Battery around the inner edge of the disk\nand continuously diffuses outward. We obtain self-similar solutions of such\nmagnetically advected winds (MAW) and discuss their observational\nramifications.\n", "  We apply the twin method to determine parallaxes to 232,545 stars of the RAVE\nsurvey using the parallaxes of Gaia DR1 as a reference. To search for twins in\nthis large dataset, we apply the t-stochastic neighbour embedding t-SNE\nprojection which distributes the data according to their spectral morphology on\na two dimensional map. From this map we choose the twin candidates for which we\ncalculate a chi^2 to select the best sets of twins. Our results show a\ncompetitive performance when compared to other model-dependent methods relying\non stellar parameters and isochrones. The power of the method is shown by\nfinding that the accuracy of our results is not significantly affected if the\nstars are normal or peculiar since the method is model free. We find twins for\n60% of the RAVE sample which is not contained in TGAS or that have TGAS\nuncertainties which are larger than 20%. We could determine parallaxes with\ntypical errors of 28%. We provide a complementary dataset for the RAVE stars\nnot covered by TGAS, or that have TGAS uncertainties which are larger than 20%,\nwith model-free parallaxes scaled to the Gaia measurements.\n", "  We introduce a new model describing multiple resonances in Kerr optical\ncavities. It perfectly agrees quantitatively with the Ikeda map and predicts\ncomplex phenomena such as super cavity solitons and coexistence of multiple\nnonlinear states.\n", "  The linear growth of operators in local quantum systems leads to an effective\nlightcone even if the system is non-relativistic. We show that consistency of\ndiffusive transport with this lightcone places an upper bound on the\ndiffusivity: $D \\lesssim v^2 \\tau_\\text{eq}$. The operator growth velocity $v$\ndefines the lightcone and $\\tau_\\text{eq}$ is the local equilibration\ntimescale, beyond which the dynamics of conserved densities is diffusive. We\nverify that the bound is obeyed in various weakly and strongly interacting\ntheories. In holographic models this bound establishes a relation between the\nhydrodynamic and leading non-hydrodynamic quasinormal modes of planar black\nholes. Our bound relates transport data --- including the electrical\nresistivity and the shear viscosity --- to the local equilibration time, even\nin the absence of a quasiparticle description. In this way, the bound sheds\nlight on the observed $T$-linear resistivity of many unconventional metals, the\nshear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma and the spin transport of unitary\nfermions.\n", "  The stability characteristics of compressible spanwise-periodic open-cavity\nflows are investigated with direct numerical simulation and biglobal stability\nanalysis for rectangular cavities with aspect ratios of $L/D=2$ and 6. This\nstudy examines the behavior of instabilities with respect to stable/unstable\nsteady states in the laminar regimes for subsonic and transonic conditions\nwhere compressibility plays an important role. It is observed that an increase\nin Mach number destabilizes the flow in the subsonic regime and stabilizes the\nflow in the transonic regime. Biglobal stability analysis is conducted to\nextract 2D and 3D eigenmodes for prescribed spanwise wavelengths about the 2D\nsteady state. The properties of 2D eigenmodes agree well with those observed in\nthe 2D nonlinear simulations. In the analysis of 3D eigenmodes, it is found\nthat an increase of Mach number stabilizes dominant 3D eigenmodes. For a short\ncavity with $L/D=2$, the 3D eigenmodes primarily stem from centrifugal\ninstabilities. For a long cavity with $L/D=6$, other types of eigenmodes appear\nwhose structures extend from the aft-region to the mid-region of the cavity. A\nselected number of 3D DNS are performed at $M_\\infty=0.6$. For $L/D=2$, the\nproperties of 3D structures present in the 3D nonlinear flow correspond closely\nto those obtained from linear stability analysis. However, for $L/D=6$, the 3D\neigenmodes cannot be clearly observed in the 3D DNS, due to the strong\nnonlinearity that develops over the length of the cavity. In addition, it is\nnoted that three-dimensionality in the flow helps alleviate violent\noscillations for the long cavity. The analysis performed in this paper can\nprovide valuable insights for designing effective flow control strategies to\nsuppress undesirable aerodynamic and pressure fluctuations in compressible\nopen-cavity flows.\n", "  We present a review of two methods used to model recent LCLS experimental\nresults for the 3C/3D line intensity ratio of Fe XVII (Bernitt et al. 2012),\nthe time-dependent collisional-radiative method and the density-matrix\napproach. These are described and applied to a two-level atomic system excited\nby an X-ray free electron laser. A range of pulse parameters is explored and\nthe effects on the predicted Fe XVII 3C and 3D line intensity ratio are\ncalculated. In order to investigate the behavior of the predicted line\nintensity ratio, a particular pair of A-values for the 3C and 3D transitions\nwas chosen (2.22 $\\times$ 10$^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ and 6.02 $\\times$ 10$^{12}$\ns$^{-1}$ for the 3C and 3D, respectively), but our conclusions are independent\nof the precise values. We also reaffirm the conclusions from Oreshkina et\nal.(2014, 2015): the non-linear effects in the density matrix are important and\nthe reduction in the Fe XVII 3C/3D line intensity ratio is sensitive to the\nlaser pulse parameters, namely pulse duration, pulse intensity, and laser\nbandwidth. It is also shown that for both models the lowering of the 3C/3D line\nintensity ratio below the expected time-independent oscillator strength ratio\nhas a significant contribution due to the emission from the plasma after the\nlaser pulse has left the plasma volume. Laser intensities above $\\sim 1\\times\n10^{12}$ W/cm$^{2}$ are required for a reduction in the 3C/3D line intensity\nratio below the expected time independent oscillator strength ratio.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is an important driver of energetic particles in many\nastrophysical phenomena. Using kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\nexplore the impact of three-dimensional reconnection dynamics on the efficiency\nof particle acceleration. In two-dimensional systems, Alfv\\'enic outflows expel\nenergetic electrons into flux ropes where they become trapped and disconnected\nfrom acceleration regions. However, in three-dimensional systems these flux\nropes develop axial structure that enables particles to leak out and return to\nacceleration regions. This requires a finite guide field so that particles may\nmove quickly along the flux rope axis. We show that greatest energetic electron\nproduction occurs when the guide field is of the same order as the reconnecting\ncomponent: large enough to facilitate strong transport, but not so large as to\nthrottle the dominant Fermi mechanism responsible for efficient electron\nacceleration. This suggests a natural explanation for the envelope of electron\nacceleration during the impulsive phase of eruptive flares.\n", "  We study the low temperature thermal conductivity of single-layer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides. In the low temperature regime where heat is carried\nprimarily through transport of electrons, thermal conductivity is linked to\nelectrical conductivity through the Wiedemann-Franz law. Using a \\textit{k.p}\nHamiltonian that describes the $ K $ and $ K^{'} $ valley edges, we compute the\nzero-frequency electric (Drude) conductivity using the Kubo formula to obtain a\nnumerical estimate for the thermal conductivity. The impurity scattering\ndetermined transit time of electrons which enters the Drude expression is\nevaluated within the self-consistent Born approximation. The analytic\nexpressions derived show that low temperature thermal conductivity 1) is\ndetermined by the band gap at the valley edges in monolayer TMDCs and 2) in\npresence of disorder which can give rise to the variable range hopping regime,\nthere is a distinct reduction. Additionally, we compute the Mott thermopower\nand demonstrate that under a high frequency light beam that sets up a Floquet\nHamiltonian, a valley-resolved thermopower can be obtained. A closing summary\nreviews the implications of results followed by a brief discussion on\napplicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law and its breakdown in context of the\npresented calculations.\n", "  The microlens parallax is a crucial observable for conclusively identifying\nthe nature of lens systems in microlensing events containing or composed of\nfaint (even dark) astronomical objects such as planets, neutron stars, brown\ndwarfs, and black holes. With the commencement of a new era of microlensing in\ncollaboration with space-based observations, the microlens parallax can be\nroutinely measured. In addition, space-based observations can provide\nopportunities to verify the microlens parallax measured from ground-only\nobservations and to find a unique solution of the lensing lightcurve analysis.\nHowever, since most space-based observations cannot cover the full lightcurves\nof lensing events, it is also necessary to verify the reliability of the\ninformation extracted from fragmentary space-based lightcurves. We conduct a\ntest based on the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0168 created by a binary\nlens system consisting of almost equal mass M-dwarf stars to demonstrate that\nit is possible to verify the microlens parallax and to resolve degeneracies by\nusing the space-based lightcurve even though the observations are fragmentary.\nSince space-based observatories will frequently produce fragmentary lightcurves\ndue to their short observing windows, the methodology of this test will be\nuseful for next-generation microlensing experiments that combine space-based\nand ground-based collaboration.\n", "  We discuss several bosonic topological phases in (3+1) dimensions enriched by\na global $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and gauging the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. More\nspecifically, following the spirit of the bulk-boundary correspondence,\nexpected to hold in topological phases of matter in general, we consider\nboundary (surface) field theories and their orbifold. From the surface\npartition functions, we extract the modular $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$\nmatrices and compare them with $(2+1)$d toplogical phase after dimensional\nreduction. As a specific example, we discuss topologically ordered phases in\n$(3+1)$ dimensions described by the BF topological quantum field theories, with\nabelian exchange statistics between point-like and loop-like quasiparticles.\nOnce the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge conjugation symmetry is gauged, the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux becomes non-abelian excitation. The gauged topological\nphases we are considering here belong to the quantum double model with\nnon-abelian group in $(3+1)$ dimensions.\n", "  Within mean field theory, we investigate the bridging transition between a\npair of parallel cylindrical colloids immersed in a binary liquid mixture as a\nsolvent which is close to its critical consolute point $T_c$. We determine the\nuniversal scaling functions of the effective potential and of the force between\nthe colloids. For a solvent which is at the critical concentration and close to\n$T_c$, we find that the critical Casimir force is the dominant interaction at\nclose separations. This agrees very well with the corresponding Derjaguin\napproximation for the effective interaction between the two cylinders, while\ncapillary forces originating from the extension of the liquid bridge turn out\nto be more important at large separations. In addition, we are able to infer\nfrom the wetting characteristics of the individual colloids the first-order\ntransition of the liquid bridge connecting two colloidal particles to the\nruptured state. While specific to cylindrical colloids, the results presented\nhere provide also an outline for identifying critical Casimir forces acting on\nbridged colloidal particles as such, and for analyzing the bridging transition\nbetween them.\n", "  Using a lattice model and a versatile thermodynamic integration scheme, we\nstudy the critical Casimir interactions between inclusions embedded in a\ntwo-dimensional critical binary mixtures. For single-domain inclusions we\ndemonstrate that the interactions are very long range, and their magnitudes\nstrongly depend on the affinity of the inclusions with the species in the\nbinary mixtures, ranging from repulsive when two inclusions have opposing\naffinities to attractive when they have the same affinities. When one of the\ninclusions has no preference for either of the species, we find negligible\ncritical Casimir interactions. For multiple-domain inclusions, mimicking the\nobservations that membrane proteins often have several domains with varying\naffinities to the surrounding lipid species, the presence of domains with\nopposing affinities does not cancel the interactions altogether. Instead we can\nobserve both attractive and repulsive interactions depending on their relative\norientations. With increasing number of domains per inclusion, the range and\nmagnitude of the effective interactions decrease in a similar fashion to those\nof electrostatic multipoles. Finally, clusters formed by multiple-domain\ninclusions can result in an effective affinity patterning due to the\nanisotropic character of the Casimir interactions between the building blocks.\n", "  We propose a method for preparing mixed quantum states of arbitrary dimension\n$D$ ($D\\geq2$) which are codified in the discretized transverse momentum and\nposition of single photons, once they are sent through an aperture with $D$\nslits. Following our previous technique we use a programmable single phase-only\nspatial light modulator (SLM) to define the aperture and set the complex\ntransmission amplitude of each slit, allowing the independent control of the\ncomplex coefficients that define the quantum state. Since these SLMs give us\nthe possibility to dynamically varying the complex coefficients of the state\nduring the measurement time, we can generate not only pure states but also\nquantum states compatible with a mixture of pure quantum states. Therefore, by\nusing these apertures varying on time according to a probability distribution,\nwe have experimentally obtained $D$-dimensional quantum states with purities\nthat depend on the parameters of the distribution through a clear analytical\nexpression. This fact allows us to easily customize the states to be generated.\nMoreover, the method offer the possibility of working without changing the\noptical setup between pure and mixed states, or when the dimensionality of the\nstates is increased. The obtained results show a quite good performance of our\nmethod at least up to dimension $D=11$, being the fidelity of the prepared\nstates $F > 0.98$ in every case.\n", "  We investigate the universality of truncation schemes for Dyson-Schwinger\nequations developed for quantum chromodynamics in theories which differ from\nquantum chromodynamics only in the gauge group. Our specific choices are the\ngauge groups $SU(2)$ and $G_2$, for which lattice calculations at nonvanishing\nchemical potential are possible. Thus, corresponding calculations can provide\nbenchmarks for testing calculations with functional equations. We calculate the\nquark and gluon propagators and determine the chiral and dual chiral\ncondensates at vanishing density to determine the confinement/deconfinement and\nchiral transitions, respectively. We can reproduce the expected type of\ntransitions in the quenched and unquenched cases. In general, all three\ntheories react very similarly to modifications of the employed model for the\nquark-gluon vertex.\n", "  A primary goal of many undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in the\nphysical sciences is to prepare students to engage in scientific research, or\nto prepare students for careers that leverage skillsets similar to those used\nby research scientists. Even for students who may not intend to pursue a career\nwith these characteristics, exposure to the context of applications in modern\nresearch can be a valuable tool for teaching and learning. However, a\npersistent barrier to student participation in research is familiarity with the\ntechnical language, format, and context that academic researchers use to\ncommunicate research methods and findings with each other: the literature of\nthe field. Astrobites, an online web resource authored by graduate students,\nhas published brief and accessible summaries of more than 1,300 articles from\nthe astrophysical literature since its founding in 2010. This article presents\nthree methods for introducing students at all levels within the formal higher\neducation setting to approaches and results from modern research. For each\nmethod, we provide a sample lesson plan that integrates content and principles\nfrom Astrobites, including step-by-step instructions for instructors,\nsuggestions for adapting the lesson to different class levels across the\nundergraduate and graduate spectrum, sample student handouts, and a grading\nrubric.\n", "  We perform a high statistics study of the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ and $1^{+}$\ncharmed-strange mesons, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, respectively. The\neffects of the nearby $DK$ and $D^{*}K$ thresholds are taken into account by\nemploying the corresponding four quark operators. Six ensembles with $N_f=2$\nnon-perturbatively ${\\cal O}(a)$ improved clover Wilson sea quarks at $a=0.07$\nfm are employed, covering different spatial volumes and pion masses: linear\nlattice extents $L/a=24,32,40,64$, equivalent to 1.7 fm to 4.5 fm, are realised\nfor $m_{\\pi}=290$ MeV and $L/a=48,64$ or 3.4 fm and 4.5 fm for an almost\nphysical pion mass of $150$ MeV. Through a phase shift analysis and the\neffective range approximation we determine the scattering lengths, couplings to\nthe thresholds and the infinite volume masses. Differences relative to the\nexperimental values are observed for these masses, however, this is likely to\nbe due to discretisation effects as spin-averaged quantities and splittings are\nreasonably compatible with experiment. We also compute the weak decay constants\nof the scalar and axialvector and find $f_V^{0^+}=114(2)(0)(+5)(10)$ MeV and\n$f_A^{1^+}=194(3)(4)(+5)(10)$ MeV, where the errors are due to statistics,\nrenormalisation, finite volume and lattice spacing effects.\n", "  We present two evolved stars from the TAPAS (Tracking Advanced PlAnetary\nSystems) with HARPS-N project devoted to RV precision measurements of\nidentified candidates within the PennState - Torun Centre for Astronomy Planet\nSearch. Evolved stars with planets are crucial to understand the dependency of\nthe planet formation mechanism on the mass and metallicity of the parent star\nand to study star-planet interactions. The paper is based on precise radial\nvelocity (RV) measurements, for HD 103485 we collected 57 epochs over 3317 days\nwith the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectrograph and 18\nultra-precise HARPS-N data over 919 days. For BD+03 2562 we collected 46 epochs\nof HET data over 3380 days and 19 epochs of HARPS-N data over 919 days. We\npresent the analysis of the data and the search for correlations between the RV\nsignal and stellar activity, stellar rotation and photometric variability.\nBased on the available data, we interpret the RV variations measured in both\nstars as Keplerian motion. Both stars have masses close to Solar (1.11 and\n1.14), very low metallicities ([Fe/H]=-0.50 and -0.71), and, both have Jupiter\nplanetary mass companions (m sin i=7 and 6.4 Mj), in close to terrestrial\norbits (1.4 and 1.3~au), with moderate eccentricities (e=0.34 and 0.2).\nHowever, we cannot totally exclude that the signal in the case of HD~103485 is\ndue to rotational modulation of active regions. Based on the current data, we\nconclude that BD+03 2562 has a bona fide planetary companion while for HD\n103485 we cannot totally exclude that the best explanation for the RV signal\nmodulations is not the existence of a planet but stellar activity. If, the\ninterpretation remains that both stars have planetary companions they represent\nsystems orbiting very evolved stars with very low metallicities, a challenge to\nthe conditions required for the formation of massive giant gas planets.\n", "  The coherent Ising machine is expected to find a near-optimal solution in\nvarious combinatorial optimization problems, which has been experimentally\nconfirmed with optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and a field programmable\ngate array (FPGA) circuit. The similar mathematical models were proposed three\ndecades ago by J. J. Hopfield, et al. in the context of classical neural\nnetworks. In this article, we compare the computational performance of both\nmodels.\n", "  The simplest cosmology --- the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-Lema\\^{i}tre (FRW)\nmodel --- describes a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe where the\nscale factor is the only dynamical parameter. Here we consider how quantized\nelectromagnetic fields become entangled with the scale factor in a toy version\nof the FRW model. A system consisting of a photon, source, and detector is\ndescribed in such a universe, and we find that the detection of a redshifted\nphoton by the detector system constrains possible scale factor superpositions.\nThus, measuring the redshift of the photon is equivalent to a weak measurement\nof the underlying cosmology. We also consider a potential optomechanical\nanalogy system that would enable experimental exploration of these concepts.\nThe analogy focuses on the effects of photon redshift measurement as a quantum\nback-action on metric variables, where the position of a movable mirror plays\nthe role of the scale factor. By working in the rotating frame, an effective\nHubble equation can be simulated with a simple free moving mirror.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae are widely accepted to be the outcomes of thermonuclear\nexplosions in white dwarf stars. However, many details of these explosions\nremain uncertain (e.g. the mass, ignition mechanism, and flame speed). Theory\npredicts that at very late times (beyond 1000 d) it might be possible to\ndistinguish between explosion models. Few very nearby supernovae can be\nobserved that long after the explosion. The Type Ia supernova SN 2011fe located\nin M101 and along a line of sight with negligible extinction, provides us with\nthe once-in-a-lifetime chance to obtain measurements that may distinguish\nbetween theoretical models. In this work, we present the analysis of\nphotometric data of SN 2011fe taken between 900 and 1600 days after explosion\nwith Gemini and HST. At these extremely late epochs theory suggests that the\nlight curve shape might be used to measure isotopic abundances which is a\nuseful model discriminant. However, we show in this work that there are several\ncurrently not well constrained physical processes introducing large systematic\nuncertainties to the isotopic abundance measurement. We conclude that without\nfurther detailed knowledge of the physical processes at this late stage one\ncannot reliably exclude any models on the basis of this dataset.\n", "  One viable seeding mechanism for supermassive black holes is the direct\ngaseous collapse route in pre-galactic dark matter halos, producing objects on\nthe order of $10^4 - 10^6$ solar masses. These events occur when the gas is\nprevented from cooling below $10^4$ K that requires a metal-free and relatively\nH$_2$-free medium. The initial collapse cools through atomic hydrogen\ntransitions, but the gas becomes optically thick to the cooling radiation at\nhigh densities. We explore the effects ofLyman-$\\alpha$ trapping in such a\ncollapsing system with a suite of Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations\nin uniform density and isotropic cases that are based from a cosmological\nsimulation. Our method includes both non-coherent scattering and two-photon\nline cooling. We find that Lyman-$\\alpha$ radiation is marginally trapped in\nthe parsec-scale gravitationally unstable central cloud, allowing the\ntemperature to increase to 50,000 K at a number density of $3 \\times 10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$ and increasing the Jeans mass by a factor of five. The effective\nequation of state changes from isothermal at low densities to have an adiabatic\nindex of 4/3 around the temperature maximum and then slowly retreats back to\nisothermal at higher densities. Our results suggest that Lyman-$\\alpha$\ntrapping delays the initial collapse by raising the Jeans mass. Afterward the\nhigh density core cools back to $10^4$ K that is surrounded by a warm envelope\nwhose inward pressure may alter the fragmentation scales at high densities.\n", "  Spin correlations between top-quark and anti-top-quark in pair production are\nsensitive to physics beyond the standard model. A complete set of observables,\nthat can be used to measure all independent parameters of the production spin\ndensity matrix, is necessary to search for anomalous interactions in the\nproduction dynamics. In this letter, we provide a set of asymmetry observables\nfor measuring all the density matrix elements. These observables are defined\nregardless of the production mechanism, and can be specified in any desired\nreference frame, particularly the laboratory frame in which the first evidence\nof spin correlation was observed experimentally. Our method can be used to find\nan optimal Lorentz frame in which the sensitivity to the density matrices is\nhigh for given production process and experimental environment, or to test\npossible correlations among the matrix elements.\n", "  Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that are sensitive to\npotential $\\gamma$-ray signals from dark matter (DM) annihilation above\n$\\sim50$ GeV will soon be superseded by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\nCTA will have a point source sensitivity an order of magnitude better than\ncurrently operating IACTs and will cover a broad energy range between 20 GeV\nand 300 TeV. Using effective field theory and simplified models to calculate\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra resulting from DM annihilation, we compare the prospects\nto constrain such models with CTA observations of the Galactic center with\ncurrent and near-future measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and\ndirect detection experiments. For DM annihilations via vector or pseudoscalar\ncouplings, CTA observations will be able to probe DM models out of reach of the\nLHC, and, if DM is coupled to standard fermions by a pseudoscalar particle,\nbeyond the limits of current direct detection experiments.\n", "  Similar to nacre or brick-and-mortar structures, imbricated lamellar\nstructures are widely found in natural and man-made materials and are of\ninterest for biomimetics. These structures are known to be rather insensitive\nto defects and to have a very high fracture toughness. Their deterministic\nbehavior has been intensely studied, but statistical studies have been rare and\nis so far there is no undisputed theoretical basis for the probability\ndistribution of strength of nacre. This paper presents a numerical and\ntheoretical study of the PDF of strength and of the corresponding statistical\nsize effect. After a reasonable simplifications of the shear bonds, an axially\nloaded lamellar shell is statistically modelled as a square fishnet pulled\ndiagonally. A finite element (FE) model is developed and used in Monte Carlo\nsimulations of strength. An analytical model for failure probability of the\nfishnet is developed and matched to the computed statistical histograms of\nstrength for various sizes. It appears that, with increasing size, the pdf of\nstrength slowly transits from Gaussian to Weilbull distribution but the\ntransition is different from that previously obtained at Northwestern for\nquasibrittle materials of random heterogeneous mesostructure.\n", "  A procedure to derive the partition function of non-interacting particles\nwith exotic or intermediate statistics is presented. The partition function is\ndirectly related to the associated creation and annihilation operators that\nobey some specific commutation or anti-commutation relations. The cases of\nGentile statistics, quons, Polychronakos statistics, and ewkons are considered.\nEwkons statistics was recently derived from the assumption of free diffusion in\nenergy space (Phys. Rev. E 94, 062115, 2016); an ideal gas of ewkons has\nnegative pressure, a feature that makes them suitable for the description of\ndark energy.\n", "  The localization of light in flat-band lattices has been recently proposed\nand experimentally demonstrated in several configurations, assuming a classical\ndescription of light. Here, we study the problem of light localization in the\nquantum regime. We focus on quasi one-dimensional and two-dimensional lattices\nwhich exhibit a perfect flat-band inside their linear spectrum. Localized\nquantum states are constructed as eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian\nwith a vanishing eigenvalue and a well defined total photon number. These are\nsuperpositions of Fock states with probability amplitudes given by positive as\nwell as negative square roots of multinomial coefficients. The classical\npicture can be recovered by considering poissonian superpositions of localized\nquantum states with different total photon number. We also study the\nseparability properties of flat band quantum states and apply them to the\ntransmission of information via multi-core fibers, where these states allow for\nthe total passive suppression of photon crosstalk and exhibit robustness\nagainst photon losses. At the end, we propose a novel on-chip setup for the\nexperimental preparation of localized quantum states of light for any number of\nphotons.\n", "  We revisit the standard analysis of inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering off\nnucleons taking into account the fact that on-shell quarks cannot be present in\nthe final state, but they rather decay into hadrons - a process that can be\ndescribed in terms of suitable \"jet\" correlators. As a consequence, a spin-flip\nterm associated with the invariant mass of the produced hadrons is generated\nnon perturbatively and couples to the target's transversity distribution\nfunction. In inclusive cross sections, this provides an hitherto neglected and\nlarge contribution to the twist-3 part of the g2 structure function, that can\nexplain the discrepancy between recent calculations and fits of this quantity.\nIt also provides an extension of the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule, putting\nconstraints on the small-x behavior of the transversity function, as well as an\nextension of the Efremov-Teryaev-Leader sum rule, suggesting a novel way to\nmeasure the tensor charge of the proton.\n", "  The two-component broad-band spectral energy distributions of blazars were\nsuggested to form a sequence in which (1) the peak frequency of the low-energy\n(synchrotron) component nu_syn is anticorrelated with the synchrotron\nluminosity L_syn, and (2) the luminosity ratio of the high-energy (inverse\nCompton) to synchrotron components q = L_IC / L_syn (Compton dominance)\nincreases with L_syn from the BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) to the flat spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs). The Compton dominance parameter is an important probe of\nplasma magnetisation in the blazar zones within relativistic jets. We\ninvestigate a sample of blazars detected by WISE in the mid-infrared (MIR) band\nand by Fermi/LAT in the GeV gamma-ray band, with the focus on the distribution\nof luminosities and photon indices. Our findings are the following: (1) the MIR\nphoton index Gamma_W12 is a useful probe of the blazar sequence, with the\nexception of low-luminosity BL Lacs that are most likely contaminated by their\nhost galaxies (L_W1 ~ 10^44 erg/s and Gamma_W12 < 1); (2) Gamma_W12 is\ncorrelated with the gamma-ray photon index Gamma_1-100GeV, with the MIR\nluminosity L_W1, and with the Fermi/WISE Compton dominance q_FW = L_1GeV/L_W1;\n(3) a clean separation between FSRQs and BL Lacs can be seen in the parameter\nspace of Gamma_W12 and q_FW; (4) the observed distribution of MIR luminosity\nL_W1 vs. Compton dominance q_FW for the entire sample of blazars can be modeled\nas a sequence of lepto-magnetic jet powers in the range (log_10 P_eB) in\n[42:45] with the preference for sub-equipartition magnetic fields P_B/P_e in\n[0.05:1], assuming fixed bulk Lorentz factor Gamma_j = 15, fixed jet opening\nangle Gamma_j Theta_j = 0.3, fixed radiative efficiency of jet electrons\nepsilon_em = 50%, and that external radiation luminosity scales like L_ext\npropto (P_eB)^(1.6) (parameter degeneracies are discussed).\n", "  The mechanical and transport properties of jammed materials originate from an\nunderlying per- colating network of contact forces between the grains. Using\nextensive simulations we investigate the force-percolation transition of this\nnetwork, where two particles are considered as linked if their interparticle\nforce overcomes a threshold. We show that this transition belongs to the random\npercolation universality class, thus ruling out the existence of long-range\ncorrelations between the forces. Through a combined size and pressure scaling\nfor the percolative quantities, we show that the continuous force percolation\ntransition evolves into the discontinuous jamming transition in the zero\npressure limit, as the size of the critical region scales with the pressure.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental and theoretical research on a monolayer of\nBoron atoms, Borophene, current-voltage characteristics of three different\nBorophene sheets, 2Pmmn, 8Pmmn and 8Pmmm, are calculated using density\nfunctional theory combined with nonequilibriumGreen function formalism.\nBorophene sheets with two and eight atoms in a unit cell are considered and\nbandstructure, electron density and structural anisotropy of them are analyzed\nin details. Results show that 8Pmmn and 8Pmmm structures which have eight atoms\nin the unit cell have less anisotropy than 2Pmmn. In addition, although 8Pmmn\nshows a Dirac cone in the bandstructure, its current is lower than two others.\nWe also consider a fully hydrogenated Borophene, Borophane, and find that the\nhydrogenation process reduces the structural anisotropy and the current\nsignificantly. Our findings reveal that the current-voltage characteristics of\nthe Borophene sheets can be used to detect the kind and the growth direction of\nthe sample because it is strongly dependent on the direction of the electron\ntransport, anisotropy and details of the unit cell of the Borophene.\n", "  In a reaction-diffusion-advection system, with a convectively unstable\nregime, a perturbation creates a wave train that is advected downstream and\neventually leaves the system. We show that the convective instability coexists\nwith a local absolute instability when a fixed boundary condition upstream is\nimposed. This boundary induced instability acts as a continuous wave source,\ncreating a local periodic excitation near the boundary, which initiates waves\ntraveling both up and downstream. To confirm this, we performed analytical\nanalysis and numerical simulations of a modified Martiel-Goldbeter\nreaction-diffusion model with the addition of an advection term. We provide a\nquantitative description of the wave packet appearing in the convectively\nunstable regime, which we found to be in excellent agreement with the numerical\nsimulations. We characterize this new instability and show that in the limit of\nhigh advection speed, it is suppressed. This type of instability can be\nexpected for reaction-diffusion systems that present both a convective\ninstability and an excitable regime. In particular, it can be relevant to\nunderstand the signaling mechanism of the social amoeba Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum that may experience fluid flows in its natural habitat.\n", "  The canonical and grand-canonical ensembles are two usual marginal cases for\nultracold Bose gases, but real collections of experimental runs commonly have\nintermediate properties. Here we study the continuum of intermediate cases, and\nlook into the appearance of ensemble equivalence as interaction rises for\nmesoscopic 1d systems. We demonstrate how at sufficient interaction strength\nthe distributions of condensate and excited atoms become practically identical\nregardless of the ensemble used. Importantly, we find that features that are\nfragile in the ideal gas and appear only in a strict canonical ensemble can\nbecome robust in all ensembles when interactions become strong. As evidence,\nthe steep cliff in the distribution of the number of excited atoms is\npreserved. To make this study, a straightforward approach for generating\ncanonical and intermediate classical field ensembles using a modified\nstochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) is developed.\n", "  This work reports an experimental characterisation of the flow properties in\na homogeneous bubble swarm rising at high-Reynolds-numbers within a homogeneous\nand isotropic turbulent flow. Both the gas volume fraction {\\alpha} and the\nvelocity fluctuations of the carrier flow before bubble injection are varied,\nrespectively, in the ranges 0% < alpha < 0.93% and 2.3 cm/s < urms < 5.5 cm/s.\nThe so-called bubblance parameter is used to compare the ratio of the kinetic\nenergy generated by the bubbles to the one produced by the incident turbulence,\nand is varied from 0 to 1.3. Conditional measurements of the velocity field\ndownstream of the bubbles in the vertical direction allow us to disentangle\nthree regions that have specific statistical properties, namely the primary\nwake, the secondary wake and the far field. While the fluctuations in the\nprimary wake are similar to the one of a single bubble rising in a liquid at\nrest, the statistics of the velocity fluctuations in the far field follow\nGaussian distribution, similar to the one produced by the homogenous and\nisotropic turbulence at the largest scales. In the secondary wake region, the\nconditional probability density function (pdf) of the velocity fluctuations is\nasymmetric and shows an exponential tail for the positive fluctuations and a\nGaussian one for the negative fluctuations. The overall agitation thus results\nfrom the combination of these three contributions and depends mainly on the\nbubblance parameter.\n", "  We present recent advances in Density Functional Theory (DFT) for\napplications to the field of quantum transport, with particular emphasis on\ntransport through strongly correlated systems. We review the foundations of the\npopular Landauer-B\\\"uttiker(LB)+DFT approach. This formalism, when using\napproximations to the exchange-correlation (xc) potential with steps at integer\noccupation, correctly captures the Kondo plateau in the zero bias conductance\nat zero temperature but completely fails to capture the transition to the\nCoulomb blockade (CB) regime as temperature increases. To overcome the\nlimitations of LB+DFT the quantum transport problem is treated from a\ntime-dependent (TD) perspective using TDDFT, an exact framework to deal with\nnonequilibrium situations. The steady-state limit of TDDFT shows that in\naddition to an xc potential in the junction, there also exists an xc correction\nto the applied bias. Open shell molecules in the CB regime provide the most\nstriking examples of the importance of the xc bias correction. Using the\nAnderson model as guidance we estimate these corrections in the limit of zero\nbias. For the general case we put forward a steady-state DFT which is based on\nthe one-to-one correspondence between the pair of basic variables steady\ndensity on and steady current across the junction and the pair local potential\non and bias across the junction. Like TDDFT, this framework also leads to both\nan xc potential in the junction and an xc correction to the bias. Unlike in\nTDDFT, these potentials are independent of history. We highlight the universal\nfeatures of both xc potential and xc bias corrections for junctions in the CB\nregime and provide an accurate parametrization for the Anderson model at\narbitrary temperatures and interaction strengths thus providing a unified DFT\ndescription for both Kondo and CB regimes and the transition between them.\n", "  The nearby galaxies of the Local Group can act as our laboratories in helping\nto bridge the gap between theory and observations. In this review we will\ndescribe the complications of identifying samples of OB stars, yellow and red\nsupergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars, and what we have so far learned from these\nstudies.\n", "  We present a method for calculating the complex Green function $G_{ij}\n(\\omega)$ at any real frequency $\\omega$ between any two sites $i$ and $j$ on a\nlattice. Starting from numbers of walks on square, cubic, honeycomb,\ntriangular, bcc, fcc, and diamond lattices, we derive Chebyshev expansion\ncoefficients for $G_{ij} (\\omega)$. The convergence of the Chebyshev series can\nbe accelerated by constructing functions $f(\\omega)$ that mimic the van Hove\nsingularities in $G_{ij} (\\omega)$ and subtracting their Chebyshev coefficients\nfrom the original coefficients. We demonstrate this explicitly for the square\nlattice and bcc lattice. Our algorithm achieves typical accuracies of 6--9\nsignificant figures using 1000 series terms.\n", "  We report the carrier dynamics and recombination coefficients in\nsingle-quantum-well semipolar $(20\\bar 2\\bar 1)$ InGaN/GaN light-emitting\ndiodes emitting at 440 nm with 93% peak internal quantum efficiency. The\ndifferential carrier lifetime is analyzed for various injection current\ndensities from 5 $A/cm^2$ to 10 $kA/cm^2$, and the corresponding carrier\ndensities are obtained. The coupling of internal quantum efficiency and\ndifferential carrier lifetime vs injected carrier density ($n$) enables the\nseparation of the radiative and nonradiative recombination lifetimes and the\nextraction of the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) nonradiative ($A$), radiative ($B$),\nand Auger ($C$) recombination coefficients and their $n$-dependency considering\nthe saturation of the SRH recombination rate and phase-space filling. The\nresults indicate a three to four-fold higher $A$ and a nearly two-fold higher\n$B_0$ for this semipolar orientation compared to that of $c$-plane reported\nusing a similar approach [A. David and M. J. Grundmann, Appl. Phys. Lett. 96,\n103504 (2010)]. In addition, the carrier density in semipolar $(20\\bar 2\\bar\n1)$ is found to be lower than the carrier density in $c$-plane for a given\ncurrent density, which is important for suppressing efficiency droop. The\nsemipolar LED also shows a two-fold lower $C_0$ compared to $c$-plane, which is\nconsistent with the lower relative efficiency droop for the semipolar LED (57%\nvs. 69%). The lower carrier density, higher $B_0$ coefficient, and lower $C_0$\n(Auger) coefficient are directly responsible for the high efficiency and low\nefficiency droop reported in semipolar $(20\\bar 2\\bar 1)$ LEDs.\n", "  We analyze an experimental method for creating interesting nonclassical\nstates by processing the entanglement generated when two large coherent states\ninteract in a cross-Kerr medium. We specifically investigate the effects of\nloss and noise in every mode of the experiment, as well as the effect of\n\"binning\" the post-selection outcomes. Even with these imperfections, we find\nan optimal set of currently-achievable parameters which would allow a\nproof-of-principle demonstration of number squeezing in states with large mean\nphoton number. We discuss other useful states which can be generated with the\nsame experimental tools, including a class of states which contain coherent\nsuperpositions of differing photon numbers, e.g. good approximations to the\nstate $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle+|20\\rangle)$. Finally, we suggest one\npossible application of this state in the field of optomechanics.\n", "  Laser linewidth is of central importance in spectroscopy, frequency metrology\nand all applications of lasers requiring high coherence. It is also of\nfundamental importance, because the Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth limit is of\nquantum origin. Recently, a theory of stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL)\nlinewidth has been reported. While the SBL linewidth formula exhibits power and\noptical Q factor dependences that are identical to the Schawlow-Townes formula,\na source of noise not present in two-level lasers, phonon occupancy of the\nBrillouin mechanical mode, is predicted to be the dominant SBL linewidth\ncontribution. Moreover, the quantum-limit of the SBL linewidth is predicted to\nbe twice the Schawlow-Townes limit on account of phonon participation. To help\nconfirm this theory the SBL fundamental linewidth is measured at cryogenic\ntemperatures in a silica microresonator. Its temperature dependence and the SBL\nlinewidth theory are combined to predict the number of thermo-mechanical quanta\nat three temperatures. The result agrees with the Bose-Einstein phonon\noccupancy of the microwave-rate Brillouin mode in support of the SBL linewidth\ntheory prediction.\n", "  We have investigated the superconducting ground state of the newly discovered\nsuperconductor ThFeAsN with a tetragonal layered crystal structure using\nresistivity, magnetization, heat capacity and transverse-field (TF) muon-spin\nrotation ($\\mu$SR) measurements. Our resistivity and magnetization measurements\nreveal an onset of bulk superconductivity with $T_{\\bf c}\\sim$ 30 K. The heat\ncapacity results show a very small anomaly, $\\Delta$C$_{ele}$$\\sim$0.214\n(J/mol-K) at $T_{\\bf c}\\sim$ 30 K and exhibits exponential behavior below\n$T_{\\bf c}$, which fits better to two superconducting gaps rather than a single\ngap. Further a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the electronic specific\nheat coefficient $\\gamma$(H) has been found in the low temperature limit, which\nindicates that the smaller energy gap is nodal. Our analysis of the TF-$\\mu$SR\nresults shows that the temperature dependence of the superfluid density is\nbetter described by a two-gap model either isotropic $s$+$s$-wave or\n$s$+$d$-wave than a single gap isotropic $s$-wave model for the superconducting\ngap, consistent with other Fe-based superconductors. The combine $\\gamma$(H)\nand TF-$\\mu$SR results confirm $s$+$d$-wave model for the gap structure of\nThFeAsN. The observation of two gaps in ThFeAsN suggests multiband nature of\nthe superconductivity possibly arising from the d-bands of Fe ions.\nFurthermore, from our TF-$\\mu$SR study we have estimated the magnetic\npenetration depth, in the polycrystalline sample, of\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{L}}$$(0)$ = 375 nm, superconducting carrier density $n_s =\n4.6 \\times 10^{27}~ $m$^{-3}$, and carrier's effective-mass $m^*$ =\n2.205\\textit{m}$_{e}$. We will compare the results of our present study with\nthose reported for the Fe-pnictide family of superconductors.\n", "  We study galactic star-formation activity as a function of environment and\nstellar mass over 0.5<z<2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE)\nsurvey. We estimate the galaxy environment using a Bayesian-motivated measure\nof the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass\ncompleteness of our survey, $\\log(M/M_\\odot)>9 (9.5)$ at z=1.3 (2.0). This\nmethod, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision\n($\\sigma_z / (1+z) \\lesssim 0.02$), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density\nenvironments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency,\nand show that at z> 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that\nthe effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not\nseparable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching\nefficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ($\\log (M/M_\\odot)\\gtrsim$\n10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ($\\log (M/M)_\\odot) \\lesssim$\n10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at $z\\gtrsim$ 1.5, but\nincreases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account\nfor nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ($\\log(M/M_\\odot) \\sim$ 9-10),\nwhich appear primarily at $z\\lesssim$ 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass\nquiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched\nstar-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the\nmorphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The\nevolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas\nstarvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through\nstar-formation and outflows (\"overconsumption\"), and additional processes such\nas galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the\nmorphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy\npopulations.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the four-wave mixing\nsuppression in a double-lambda interaction scheme by introducing an additional\nladder-type two-photon Raman absorption resonance for one of the optical\nfields. We propose several possible interaction configurations involving either\none or two isotopes of Rb, and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of\nefficient four-wave mixing suppression in both EIT and far-detuned Raman cases.\n", "  The primary goal of the pulsar timing array projects is to detect\nultra-low-frequency gravitational waves. The pulsar data sets are affected by\nnumerous noise processes including varying dispersive delays in the\ninterstellar medium and from the solar wind. The solar wind can lead to rapidly\nchanging variations that, with existing telescopes, can be hard to measure and\nthen remove. In this paper we study the possibility of using a low frequency\ntelescope to aid in such correction for the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA)\nand also discuss whether the ultra-wide-bandwidth receiver for the FAST\ntelescope is sufficient to model the solar wind variations. Our key result is\nthat a single wide-bandwidth receiver can be used to model and remove the\neffect of the solar wind. However, for pulsars that pass close to the Sun such\nas PSR J1022+1022, the solar wind is so variable that observations at two\ntelescopes separated by a day are insufficient to correct the solar wind\neffect.\n", "  Continuing the project described by Kato et al. (2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for 127 SU UMa-type dwarf novae observed\nmainly during the 2016--2017 season and characterized these objects. We provide\nupdated statistics of relation between the orbital period and the variation of\nsuperhumps, the relation between period variations and the rebrightening type\nin WZ Sge-type objects. We obtained the period minimum of 0.05290(2)d and\nconfirmed the presence of the period gap above the orbital period ~0.09d. We\nnote that four objects (NY Her, 1RXS J161659.5+620014, CRTS J033349.8-282244\nand SDSS J153015.04+094946.3) have supercycles shorter than 100d but show\ninfrequent normal outbursts. We consider that these objects are similar to V503\nCyg, whose normal outbursts are likely suppressed by a disk tilt. These four\nobjects are excellent candidates to search for negative superhumps. DDE 48\nappears to be a member of ER UMa-type dwarf novae. We identified a new\neclipsing SU UMa-type object MASTER OT J220559.40-341434.9. We observed 21 WZ\nSge-type dwarf novae during this interval and reported 18 out of them in this\npaper. Among them, ASASSN-16js is a good candidate for a period bouncer.\nASASSN-16ia showed a precursor outburst for the first time in a WZ Sge-type\nsuperoutburst. ASASSN-16kg, CRTS J000130.5+050624 and SDSS J113551.09+532246.2\nare located in the period gap. We have newly obtained 15 orbital periods,\nincluding periods from early superhumps.\n", "  We report the application of femtosecond four-wave mixing (FWM) to the study\nof carrier transport in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3. The diffusion\ncoefficient was extracted through direct detection of the lateral diffusion of\ncarriers utilizing the transient grating technique, coupled with simultaneous\nmeasurement of decay kinetics exploiting the versatility of the boxcar\nexcitation beam geometry. The observation of exponential decay of the transient\ngrating versus interpulse delay indicates diffusive transport with negligible\ntrapping within the first nanosecond following excitation. The in-plane\ntransport geometry in our experiments enabled the diffusion length to be\ncompared directly with the grain size, indicating that carriers move across\nmultiple grain boundaries prior to recombination. Our experiments illustrate\nthe broad utility of FWM spectroscopy for rapid characterization of macroscopic\nfilm transport properties.\n", "  Analysis of data from the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) has revealed\nthe presence of a flow of neutral helium through the inner solar system that\nmost likely emanates from the outer heliosheath, where a distinct population of\nneutral He is produced by charge exchange processes. This secondary He flow has\nbeen modeled using codes designed to study interstellar flows through the\nheliosphere, but a laminar flow is not a good approximation for the outer\nheliosheath. I present a simple parametrization for a more appropriate\ndivergent flow, and demonstrate how the secondary He particles might provide a\nmeans to remotely measure the divergence of the ISM flow around the heliopause.\n", "  Tomography has made a radical impact on diverse fields ranging from the study\nof 3D atomic arrangements in matter to the study of human health in medicine.\nDespite its very diverse applications, the core of tomography remains the same,\nthat is, a mathematical method must be implemented to reconstruct the 3D\nstructure of an object from a number of 2D projections. In many scientific\napplications, however, the number of projections that can be measured is\nlimited due to geometric constraints, tolerable radiation dose and/or\nacquisition speed. Thus it becomes an important problem to obtain the\nbest-possible reconstruction from a limited number of projections. Here, we\npresent the mathematical implementation of a tomographic algorithm, termed\nGENeralized Fourier Iterative REconstruction (GENFIRE). By iterating between\nreal and reciprocal space, GENFIRE searches for a global solution that is\nconcurrently consistent with the measured data and general physical\nconstraints. The algorithm requires minimal human intervention and also\nincorporates angular refinement to reduce the tilt angle error. We demonstrate\nthat GENFIRE can produce superior results relative to several other popular\ntomographic reconstruction techniques by numerical simulations, and by\nexperimentally by reconstructing the 3D structure of a porous material and a\nfrozen-hydrated marine cyanobacterium. Equipped with a graphical user\ninterface, GENFIRE is freely available from our website and is expected to find\nbroad applications across different disciplines.\n", "  With the advent of public access to small gate-based quantum processors, it\nbecomes necessary to develop a benchmarking methodology such that independent\nresearchers can validate the operation of these processors. We explore the\nusefulness of a number of simple quantum circuits as benchmarks for gate-based\nquantum computing devices and show that circuits performing identity operations\nare very simple, scalable and sensitive to gate errors and are therefore very\nwell suited for this task. We illustrate the procedure by presenting benchmark\nresults for the IBM Quantum Experience, a cloud-based platform for gate-based\nquantum computing.\n", "  An analytical model is developed for the prediction of noise radiated by an\naerofoil with leading edge serration in a subsonic turbulent stream. The model\nmakes use of the Fourier Expansion and Schwarzschild techniques in order to\nsolve a set of coupled differential equations iteratively and express the\nfar-field sound power spectral density in terms of the statistics of incoming\nturbulent upwash velocity. The model has shown that the primary noise reduction\nmechanism is due to the destructive interference of the scattered pressure\ninduced by the leading edge serrations. It has also shown that in order to\nachieve significant sound reduction, the serration must satisfy two geometrical\ncriteria related to the serration sharpness and hydrodynamic properties of the\nturbulence. A parametric study has been carried out and it is shown that\nserrations can reduce the overall sound pressure level at most radiation\nangles, particularly at downstream angles close to the aerofoil surface. The\nsound directivity results have also shown that the use of leading edge\nserration does not particularity change the dipolar pattern of the far-field\nnoise at low frequencies, but it changes the cardioid directivity pattern\nassociated with radiation from straight-edge scattering at high frequencies to\na tilted dipolar pattern.\n", "  Thin, magnetically aligned striations of relatively moderate contrast with\nthe background are commonly observed in both atomic and molecular clouds. They\nare also prominent in MHD simulations with turbulent converging shocks. The\nsimulated striations develop within a dense, stagnated sheet in the mid plane\nof the post-shock region where magnetically-induced converging flows collide.\nWe show analytically that the secondary flows are an inevitable consequence of\nthe jump conditions of oblique MHD shocks. They produce the stagnated,\nsheet-like sub-layer through a secondary shock when, roughly speaking, the\nAlfv\\'enic speed in the primary converging flows is supersonic, a condition\nthat is relatively easy to satisfy in interstellar clouds. The dense sub-layer\nis naturally threaded by a strong magnetic field that lies close to the plane\nof the sub-layer. The substantial magnetic field makes the sheet highly\nanisotropic, which is the key to the striation formation. Specifically,\nperturbations of the primary inflow that vary spatially perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field can easily roll up the sheet around the field lines without\nbending them, creating corrugations that appear as magnetically-aligned\nstriations in column density maps. On the other hand, perturbations that vary\nspatially along the field lines curve the sub-layer and alter its orientation\nrelative to the magnetic field locally, seeding special locations that become\nslanted overdense filaments and prestellar cores through enhanced mass\naccumulation along field lines. In our scenario, the dense sub-layer unique to\nmagnetized oblique shocks is the birthplace for both magnetically-aligned\ndiffuse striations and massive star-forming structures.\n", "  To design a uniaxial anisotropic metamaterial a layered cylindrical\nmetamaterial is introduced for TE polarization. Unlike to the previous work,\nwhich the layers were in radial direction, here the layers are in azimuthal\ndirection. Scattering efficiency for this metamaterial in different frequency\nis analyzed with solving Maxwell's wave equation. It is observed that in some\nfrequencies when the effective permittivity of the structure goes to zero the\nscattering efficiency would be negligible. This result approves the previous\npredictions. It is also found out that the scattering cancellation depends on\nthe relative permittivity of the environmental medium for the cylinder. The\nfinite element simulations are also confirmed the results.\n", "  We present the analysis of emission lines in high-resolution optical spectra\nof the planet-host star Proxima Centauri (Proxima) classified as a M5.5V\\@. We\ncarry out the detailed analysis of observed spectra to get a better\nunderstanding of the physical conditions of the atmosphere of this star. We\nidentify the emission lines in a serie series of 147 high-resolution optical\nspectra of the star at different levels of activity and compare them with the\nsynthetic spectra computed over a wide spectral range. Our synthetic spectra\ncomputed with the PHOENIX 2900/5.0/0.0 model atmosphere fits pretty well the\nobserved optical-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution. However,\nmodelling strong atomic lines in the blue spectrum (3900--4200\\AA{}) requires\nimplementing additional opacity. We show that high temperature layers in\nProxima Centauri consist in at least three emitting parts: a) a stellar\nchromosphere where numerous emission lines form. We suggest that some emission\ncores of strong absorption lines of metals form there; b) flare regions above\nthe chromosphere, where hydrogen Balmer lines up to high transition levels\n(10--2) form; c) a stellar wind component with V${r}$\\,=\\,$-$30 \\kmps{} seen in\nsome Balmer lines as blue shifted emission lines. We believe that the observed\nHe line at 4026\\AA{} in emission can be formed in that very hot region. We\nshow, that real structure of the atmosphere of Proxima is rather complicated.\nThe photosphere of the star is best fit by a normal M5 dwarf spectrum. On the\nother hand emission lines form in the chromosphere, flare regions and extended\nhot envelope.\n", "  Anomalous (non-Fourier's) heat transport is no longer just a theoretical\nissue since it has been observed experimentally in a number of low-dimensional\nnanomaterials, such as SiGe nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and others. To\nunderstand these anomalous behaviors, exploring the microscopic origin of\nnormal (Fourier's) heat transport is a fascinating theoretical topic. However,\nthis issue has not yet been fully understood even for one-dimensional (1D)\nmodel chains, in spite of a great amount of thorough studies done to date. From\nthose studies it has been widely accepted that the conservation of momentum is\na key ingredient to induce anomalous heat transport, while\nmomentum-nonconserving systems usually support normal heat transport where\nFourier's law is valid. But if the nonconservation of momentum is the reason,\nwhat is the underlying microscopic mechanism for the observed normal heat\ntransport? Here we carefully revisit a typical 1D momentum-nonconserving\n$\\phi^{4}$ model and present evidence that the mobile discrete breathers or, in\nother words, the moving intrinsic localized modes with frequency components\nabove the linear phonon band can be responsible for that.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a stochastic process that may experience random\nreset events which relocate the system to its starting position. We focus our\nattention on a one-dimensional, monotonic continuous-time random walk with a\nconstant drift: the process moves in a fixed direction between the reset\nevents, either by the effect of the random jumps, or by the action of a\ndeterministic bias. However, the orientation of its motion is randomly\ndetermined after each restart. As a result of these alternating dynamics,\ninteresting properties do emerge. General formulas for the propagator as well\nas for two extreme statistics, the survival probability and the mean\nfirst-passage time, are also derived. The rigor of these analytical results is\nverified by numerical estimations, for particular but illuminating examples.\n", "  Integrable deformation of SU(2) sigma and lambda models are considered at the\nclassical and quantum levels. These are the Yang-Baxter and XXZ-type\nanisotropic deformations. The XXZ type deformations are UV safe in one regime,\nwhile in another regime, like the Yang-Baxter deformations, they exhibit cyclic\nRG behaviour. The associated affine quantum group symmetry, realized\nclassically at the Poisson bracket level, has q a complex phase in the UV safe\nregime and q real in the cyclic RG regime, where q is an RG invariant. Based on\nthe symmetries and RG flow we propose exact factorizable S-matrices to describe\nthe scattering of states in the lambda models, from which the sigma models\nfollow by taking a limit and non-abelian T-duality. In the cyclic RG regimes,\nthe S-matrices are periodic functions of rapidity, at large rapidity, and in\nthe Yang-Baxter case violate parity.\n", "  A selfconsistent 1D theoretical framework for plasma assisted ignition and\ncombustion is reviewed. In this framework, a frozen electric field modeling\napproach is applied to take advantage of the quasiperiodic behaviors of the\nelectrical characteristics to avoid the recalculation of electric field for\neach pulse. The correlated dynamic adaptive chemistry (CoDAC) method is\nemployed to accelerate the calculation of large and stiff chemical mechanisms.\nThe timestep is updated dynamically during the simulation through a three-stage\nmultitimescale modeling strategy, which takes advantage of the large separation\nof timescales in nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges. A general theory of\nplasma assisted ignition and combustion is then proposed. Nanosecond pulsed\nplasma discharges for ignition and combustion can be divided into four stages.\nStage I is the discharge pulse, with timescales of O(1 to 10 ns). In this\nstage, most input energy is coupled into electron impact excitation and\ndissociation reactions to generate charged or excited species and radicals.\nStage II is the afterglow during the gap between two adjacent pulses, with\ntimescales of O(100 ns). In this stage, quenching of excited species not only\nfurther dissociates O2 and fuel molecules, but also provides fast gas heating.\nStage III is the remaining gap between pulses, with timescales of O(1 to 100\nmicrosec). The radicals generated during Stages I and II significantly enhance\nthe exothermic reactions in this stage. Stage IV is the accumulative effects of\nmultiple pulses, with timescales of O(1 ms to 1 sec), which include preheated\ngas temperatures and a large pool of radicals and fuel fragments to trigger\nignition. For plasma assisted flames, plasma significantly enhances the radical\ngeneration and gas heating in the preheat zone, which could trigger upstream\nautoignition.\n", "  Superconducting microwave circuits form a versatile platform for storing and\nmanipulating quantum information. A major challenge to further scalability is\nto find approaches for connecting these systems over long distances and at high\nrates. One approach is to convert the quantum state of a microwave circuit to\noptical photons that can be transmitted over kilometers at room temperature\nwith little loss. Many proposals for electro-optic conversion between microwave\nand optics use optical driving of a weak three-wave mixing nonlinearity to\nconvert the frequency of an excitation. Residual absorption of this optical\npump leads to heating, which is problematic at cryogenic temperatures. Here we\npropose an alternative approach where a nonlinear superconducting circuit is\ndriven to interconvert between microwave-frequency and\nmillimeter-wave-frequency (300 GHz) photons. To understand the potential for\nquantum conversion between microwave and mm-wave photons, we consider the\ndriven four-wave mixing quantum dynamics of nonlinear circuits. In contrast to\nthe linear dynamics of the driven three-wave mixing converters, the proposed\nfour-wave mixing converter has nonlinear decoherence channels that lead to a\nmore complex parameter space of couplings and pump powers that we map out. We\nconsider physical realizations of such converter circuits by deriving\ntheoretically the upper bound on the maximum obtainable nonlinear coupling\nbetween any two modes in a lossless circuit, and synthesizing an optimal\ncircuit based on realistic materials that saturates this bound. Our proposed\ncircuit dissipates less than $10^{-9}$ times the energy of current\nelectro-optic converters per qubit. Finally, we outline the quantum link budget\nfor optical, microwave, and mm-wave connections, showing that our approach is\nviable for realizing interconnected quantum processors for intracity or quantum\ndatacenter environments.\n", "  We used the TNG/GIANO instrument to obtain near-IR high-resolution spectra\n(R~50000) of XZ Tau and DR Tau, two actively accreting T Tauri stars classified\nas EXors. The analysis of the observed features provides information on the\nproperties of the inner disk, the accretion columns, and the winds. Both\nsources display composite HI line profiles, with contributions from both\naccreting gas and high-velocity winds. These lines become more symmetric and\nnarrower with increasing upper energy, which may be interpreted in terms of two\ncomponents with different decrements or imputed to self-absorption effects. XZ\nTau shows a relatively high state of activity with respect to literature\nobservations. The variation of the HeI 1.08um line blue-shifted absorption\nsuggests that the inner wind has undergone a dramatic change in its velocity\nstructure, connected with a recent accretion event. DR Tau has a more stable\nwind as its HeI 1.08um absorption is stable in time in spite of strong\nvariability of the emission component. The IR veiling can be interpreted as due\nto blackbody emission at temperatures of 1600K for XZ Tau and 2300K DR Tau,\nwith emitting areas ~30 times larger than the star. For XZ Tau these conditions\nare consistent with emission from the inner rim of the dusty disk, while for DR\nTau the fairly high temperature may suggest an origin from a thick gaseous disk\nwithin the dust sublimation radius. Strong and broad metallic lines, mainly\nfrom CI and FeI, are detected in XZ Tau, similar to those observed in other\nEXor sources during burst phases. DR Tau shows weaker and narrower metallic\nlines, despite its larger accretion luminosity. This suggests that accretion is\nnot the only driver of metallic line excitation. Our observations show the\npotential of wide-band, high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy to simultaneously\nprobe the phenomena that occur in the star-disk interaction region.\n", "  We study nature of the low-lying resonance states in mirror nuclei $^{9}$Be\nand $^{9}$B. Investigations are performed within a three-cluster model. The\nmodel makes use of the hyperspherical harmonics, which provides convenient\ndescription of three-cluster continuum. The dominant three-cluster\nconfigurations $\\alpha+\\alpha+n$ and $\\alpha+\\alpha+p$ in $^{9}$Be and $^{9}$B,\nrespectively, are taken into account. Dominant decay channels for all resonance\nstates in $^{9}$Be and $^{9}$B are explored. Much attention is paid to the\ncontroversial $1/2^{+}$ resonance states in both nuclei. We study effects of\nthe Coulomb interaction on energy and width of three-cluster resonances in the\nmirror nuclei $^{9}$Be and $^{9}$B. We also search for the Hoyle-analogue state\nwhich is a key step for alternative way of $^{9}$Be and $^{9}$B syntheses in a\ntriple collision of clusters in a stellar environment.\n", "  For hydrogen sensor and storage applications, films of Au and Pd were (i)\nco-sputtered at different rates or (ii) deposited in a sequential\nlayer-by-layer fashion on a cover glass. Peculiarities of hydrogen uptake and\nrelease were optically monitored using 1.3 micrometers wavelength light.\nIncrease of optical transmission was observed for hydrogenated Pd-rich films of\n10-30 nm thickness. Up to a three times slower hydrogen release took place as\ncompared with the hydrogen uptake. Composition ratio of Au:Pd and thermal\ntreatment of films provided control over the optical extinction changes and\nhydrogen uptake/release time constants. Higher uptake and release rates were\nobserved in the annealed Au:Pd films as compared to those deposited at room\ntemperature and were faster for the Au-richer films. Three main parameters\nrelevant for sensors: sensitivity, selectivity, stability (reproducibility) are\ndiscussed together with the hydrogenation mechanism in Au:Pd alloys.\n", "  The nonlinear propagation of heavy-ion-acoustic (HIA) waves (HIAWs) in a four\ncomponent multi-ion plasma (containing inertial heavy negative ions and light\npositive ions, as well as inertialess nonextensive electrons and positrons) has\nbeen theoretically investigated. The nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation\nis derived by employing the reductive perturbation method. It is found that the\nNLS equation leads to the modulational instability (MI) of HIAWs, and to the\nformation of HIA rogue waves (HIARWs), which are due to the effects of\nnonlinearity and dispersion in the propagation of HIAWs. The conditions for MI\nof HIAWs, and the basic properties of the generated HIARWs are identified. It\nis observed that the striking features (viz. instability criteria, growth rate\nof MI, amplitude and width of HIARWs, etc.) of the HIAWs are significantly\nmodified by effects of nonextensivity of electrons and positrons, ratio of\nlight positive ion mass to heavy negative ion mass, ratio of electron number\ndensity to light positive ion number density, and ratio of electron temperature\nto positron temperature, etc. The relevancy of our present investigation to the\nobservations in the space (viz. cometary comae and earth's ionosphere) and\nlaboratory (laser plasma interaction experimental devices) plasmas is pointed\nout.\n", "  We theoretically investigate magnetic properties of a trapped ultracold Fermi\ngas. Including pairing fluctuations within the framework of an extended\n$T$-matrix approximation (ETMA), as well as effects of a harmonic trap in the\nlocal density approximation (LDA), we calculate the local spin susceptibility\n$\\chi_{\\rm t}(r,T)$ in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein\ncondensation) crossover region. We show that pairing fluctuations cause\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence of $\\chi_{\\rm t}(r,T)$. Although this\nbehavior looks similar to the spin-gap phenomenon associated with pairing\nfluctuations in a {\\it uniform} Fermi gas, the trapped case is found to also be\ninfluenced by the temperature-dependent density profile, in addition to pairing\nfluctuations. We demonstrate how to remove this extrinsic effect from\n$\\chi_{\\rm t}(r,T)$, to study the interesting spin-gap phenomenon purely\noriginating from pairing fluctuations. Since experiments in cold atom physics\nare always done in a trap, our results would be useful for the assessment of\npreformed pair scenario, from the viewpoint of spin-gap phenomenon.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework and implementation details for self-energy\nembedding theory (SEET) with the GW approximation for the treatment of weakly\ncorrelated degrees of freedom and configuration interactions solver for handing\nthe strongly correlated degrees. On a series of molecular examples, for which\nthe exact results are known within a given basis, we demonstrate that\nSEET(CI/GW) is a systematically improvable and well controlled method capable\nof giving accurate results and well behaved causal self-energies and Green's\nfunctions. We compare the theoretical framework of SEET(CI/GW) to that of\nGW+DMFT and comment on differences between these to approaches that aim to\ntreat both strongly and weakly correlated simultaneously.\n", "  The behavior of identical particles interacting through the\nharmonic-repulsive pair potential has been studied in 3D using molecular\ndynamics simulations at a number of different densities. We found that at many\ndensities, as the temperature of the systems decreases, the particles\ncrystallize into complex structures whose formation have not been anticipated\nin previous studies on the harmonic-repulsive pair potential. In particular, at\ncertain densities crystallization into the structure $Ia\\bar{3}d$ (space group\n$\\#230$) with 16 particles in the unit cell occupying Wyckoff special positions\n(16b) was observed. This crystal structure has not been observed previously in\nexperiments or in computer simulations of single component atomic or soft\nmatter systems. At another density we observed a liquid which is rather stable\nagainst crystallization. Yet, we observed crystallization of this liquid into\nthe monoclinic $C2/c$ (space group $\\#15$) structure with 32 particles in the\nunit cell occupying four different non-special Wyckoff (8f) sites. In this\nstructure particles located at different Wyckoff sites have different energies.\nFrom the perspective of the local atomic environment, the organization of\nparticles in this structure resembles the structure of some columnar\nquasicrystals. At a different value of the density we did not observe\ncrystallization at all despite rather long molecular dynamics runs. At two\nother densities we observed the formation of the $\\beta Sn$ distorted diamond\nstructures instead of the expected diamond structure. Possibly, we also\nobserved the formation of the $R\\bar{3}c$ hexagonal lattice with 24 particles\nper unit cell occupying non-equivalent positions.\n", "  Fluidisation is the process by which the weight of a bed of particles is\nsupported by a gas flow passing through it from below. When fluidised materials\nflow down an incline, the dynamics of the motion differ from their\nnon-fluidised counterparts because the granular agitation is no longer required\nto support the weight of the flowing layer. Instead, the weight is borne by the\nimposed gas flow and this leads to a greatly increased flow mobility. In this\npaper, a framework is developed to model this two phase motion by incorporating\na kinetic theory description for the particulate stresses generated by the\nflow. In addition to calculating numerical solutions for fully developed flows,\nit is shown that for sufficiently thick flows there is often a local balance\nbetween the production and dissipation of the granular temperature. This\nphenomenon permits an asymptotic reduction of the full governing equations and\nthe identification of a simple state in which the volume fraction of the flow\nis uniform. The results of the model are compared with new experimental\nmeasurements of the internal velocity profiles of steady granular flows down\nslopes. The distance covered with time by unsteady granular flows down slopes\nand along horizontal surfaces and their shapes are also measured and compared\nwith theoretical predictions developed for flows that are thin relative to\ntheir streamwise extent. For the horizontal flows, it was found that resistance\nfrom the sidewalls was required in addition to basal resistance to capture\naccurately the unsteady evolution of the front position and the depth of the\ncurrent and for situations in which side-wall drag dominates, similarity\nsolutions are found for the experimentally-measured motion.\n", "  We propose a geometrical characterization of amorphous liquid structures that\nsuppress crystallization by competing locally with crystalline order. We\nintroduce for this purpose the crystal affinity of a liquid, a simple measure\nof its propensity to accumulate local crystalline structures on cooling. This\nquantity is explicitly related to the high temperature structural covariance\nbetween local fluctuations in crystal order and that of competing liquid\nstructures: favouring a structure that, due to poor overlap properties,\nanticorrelates with crystalline order reduces the affinity of the liquid. Using\na lattice model of a liquid, we show that this quantity successfully predicts\nthe tendency of a liquid to either accumulate or suppress local crystalline\nfluctuations with increasing supercooling. We demonstrate that the crystal\naffinity correlates strongly with the crystal nucleation rate and the\ncrystal-liquid interfacial free energy of the low-temperature liquid, making\nour theory a predictive tool to determine easily which amorphous structures\nenhance glass-forming ability.\n", "  Proximity orbital and spin-orbit effects of bilayer graphene on monolayer\nWSe$_2$ are investigated from first-principles. We find that the built-in\nelectric field induces an orbital band gap of about 10 meV in bilayer graphene.\nRemarkably, the proximity spin-orbit splitting for holes is two orders of\nmagnitude---the spin-orbit splitting of the valence band at K is about 2\nmeV---more than for electrons. Effectively, holes experience spin-valley\nlocking due to the strong proximity of the lower graphene layer to WSe$_2$.\nHowever, applying an external transverse electric field of some 1 V/nm,\ncountering the built-in field of the heterostructure, completely reverses this\neffect and allows, instead for holes, electrons to be spin-valley locked with 2\nmeV spin-orbit splitting. Such a behavior constitutes a highly efficient\nfield-effect spin-orbit valve, making bilayer graphene on WSe$_2$ a potential\nplatform for a field-effect spin transistor.\n", "  Gravitational wave astronomy provides an unprecedented opportunity to test\nthe nature of black holes and search for exotic, compact alternatives. Recent\nstudies have shown that exotic compact objects (ECOs) can ring down in a manner\nsimilar to black holes, but can also produce a sequence of distinct pulses\nresembling the initial ringdown. These \"echoes\" would provide definite evidence\nfor the existence of ECOs. In this work we study the generation of these echoes\nin a generic, parametrized model for the ECO, using Green's functions. We show\nhow to reprocess radiation in the near-horizon region of a Schwarzschild black\nhole into the asymptotic radiation from the corresponding source in an ECO\nspacetime. Our methods allow us to understand the connection between distinct\nechoes and ringing at the resonant frequencies of the compact object. We find\nthat the quasinormal mode ringing in the black hole spacetime plays a central\nrole in determining the shape of the first few echoes. We use this observation\nto develop a simple template for echo waveforms. This template preforms well\nover a variety of ECO parameters, and with improvements may prove useful in the\nanalysis of gravitational waves.\n", "  The mechanism driving core-collapse supernovae is sensitive to the interplay\nbetween matter and neutrino radiation. However, neutrino radiation transport is\nvery difficult to simulate, and several radiation transport methods of varying\nlevels of approximation are available. We carefully compare for the first time\nin multiple spatial dimensions the discrete ordinates (DO) code of Nagakura,\nYamada, and Sumiyoshi and the Monte Carlo (MC) code Sedonu, under the\nassumptions of a static fluid background, flat spacetime, elastic scattering,\nand full special relativity. We find remarkably good agreement in all spectral,\nangular, and fluid interaction quantities, lending confidence to both methods.\nThe DO method excels in determining the heating and cooling rates in the\noptically thick region. The MC method predicts sharper angular features due to\nthe effectively infinite angular resolution, but struggles to drive down noise\nin quantities where subtractive cancellation is prevalent, such as the net gain\nin the protoneutron star and off-diagonal components of the Eddington tensor.\nWe also find that errors in the angular moments of the distribution functions\ninduced by neglecting velocity dependence are sub-dominant to those from\nlimited momentum-space resolution. We briefly compare directly computed second\nangular moments to those predicted by popular algebraic two-moment closures,\nand find that the errors from the approximate closures are comparable to the\ndifference between the DO and MC methods. Included in this work is an improved\nSedonu code, which now implements a fully special relativistic,\ntime-independent version of the grid-agnostic Monte Carlo random walk\napproximation.\n", "  The wave-driven rotating torus (WDRT) is a recently proposed fusion concept\nwhere the rotational transform is provided by the E x B drift resulting from a\nminor radial electric field. This field can be produced, for instance, by the\nRF-wave-mediated extraction of fusion-born alpha particles. In this paper, we\ndiscuss how macroscopic force balance, i.e. balance of the thermal hoop force,\ncan be achieved in such a device. We show that this requires the inclusion of a\nsmall plasma current and vertical magnetic field, and identify the desirable\nreactor regime through free energy considerations. We then analyze particle\norbits in this desirable regime, identifying velocity-space anisotropies in\ntrapped (banana) orbits, resulting from the cancellation of rotational\ntransforms due to the radial electric and poloidal magnetic fields. The\npotential neoclassical effects of these orbits on the perpendicular\nconductivity, current drive, and transport are discussed.\n", "  We present a parameter-free scheme to combine fixed-order multi-jet results\nwith parton-shower evolution. The scheme produces jet cross sections with\nleading-order accuracy in the complete phase space of multiple emissions,\nresumming large logarithms when appropriate, while not arbitrarily enforcing\nordering on momentum configurations beyond the reach of the parton-shower\nevolution equation. This requires the development of a matrix-element\ncorrection scheme for complex phase-spaces including ordering conditions as\nwell as a systematic scale-setting procedure for unordered phase-space points.\nThe resulting algorithm does not require a merging-scale parameter. We\nimplement the new method in the Vincia framework and compare to LHC data.\n", "  We demonstrate a single-photon Rydberg excitation spectroscopy of cesium (Cs)\natoms in a room-temperature vapor cell. Cs atoms are excited directly from\n6S1/2 ground state to nP3/2 (n = 70 - 100) Rydberg states with a 318.6 nm\nultraviolet (UV) laser,and Rydberg excitation spectra are obtained by\ntransmission enhancement of a probe beam resonant to Cs 6S1/2, F = 4 - 6P3/2,\nF' = 5 transition as partial population on F = 4 ground state are transferred\nto Rydberg state .Analysis reveals that the observed spectra are\nvelocity-selective spectroscopy of Rydberg state, from which the amplitude and\nlinewidth influenced by lasers'Rabi frequency have been investigated. Fitting\nto energies of Cs nP3/2 (n = 70 -100) states, the determined quantum defect is\n3.56671(42). The demodulated spectra can also be employed as frequency\nreferences to stabilize the UV laser frequency to specific Cs Rydberg\ntransition.\n", "  We consider clean metals, at finite temperature, in which the inelastic rate,\n$\\hbar/ \\tau_{ee}$, can become of the order of, or larger, than the band\nsplitting energy. We show that in suchsystems, contrary to the common\nknowledge, the umklapp scattering rate becomes independent of both $\\tau_{ee}$\nand the temperature $T,$ in three dimensional systems. We discuss the relation\nof this phenomenon to the saturation of resistivity at high temperature.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the in-plane biaxial strain and charge doping\non the charge density wave (CDW) order of monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$ by using the\nfirst-principles calculations. Our results show that the tensile strain can\nsignificantly enhance the CDW order, while both compressive strain and charge\ndoping (electrons and holes) suppress the CDW instability. The tensile strain\nmay provide an effective method for obtaining higher CDW transition temperature\non the basis of monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$. We also discuss the potential\nsuperconductivity in charge-doped monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$. Controllable\nelectronic phase transition from CDW state to metallic state or even\nsuperconducting state can be realized in monolayer $1T$-TiSe$_2$, which makes\n$1T$-TiSe$_2$ possess a promising application in controllable switching\nelectronic devices based on CDW.\n", "  Using high speed imaging of the divertor volume, the region close to the\nX-point in MAST is shown to be quiescent. This is confirmed by three different\nanalysis techniques and the quiescent X-point region (QXR) spans from the\nseparatrix to the 1.02 flux surface. Local reductions to the atomic density and\neffects associated with the camera viewing geometry are ruled out as causes of\nthe QXR, leaving quiescence in the local plasma conditions as being the most\nlikely cause. The QXR is found to be ubiquitous across a significant\noperational space in MAST including L-mode and H-mode discharges across wide\nranges of line averaged density, plasma current and NBI power. When mapped to\nthe divertor target the QXR occupies approximately an e-folding length of the\nheat-flux profile, containing approximately 60% of the total heat flux to the\ntarget, and also shows a tendency towards higher frequency shorter lived\nfluctuations in the ion-saturation current. This is consistent with short-\nlived divertor localised filamentary structures observed further down the outer\ndivertor leg in the camera images, and suggests a complex multi-region picture\nof filamentary transport in the divertor.\n", "  Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or\nwavelength regimes will always bring in unexpected sources whose existence and\nproperties cannot be easily predicted from earlier observations: novelties or\neven anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty\ndetection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called\none-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns\namong sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the\nwhole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set\nof objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database,\npresent also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose\npatterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with\nthe model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such as objects with\nspurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of\ngenuine astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample\nof heavily reddened AGN/quasar candidates distributed uniformly over the sky\nand in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN catalogues. It also\nallowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and\ncompact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with\nstandard classification methods it will be possible to improve the latter by\naccounting for sources which are not present in the training sample but are\notherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection adds\nflexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the\nreliability and representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus\nconsidered as an essential step in supervised classification schemes to ensure\ncompleteness and purity of produced catalogues.\n", "  The formation of massive stars is still not well understood. Accumulating a\nlarge amount of mass infalling within a single entity in spite of radiation\npressure is possible if, among several other conditions, enough thermal energy\nis released. Despite numerous water line observations, with the Herschel Space\nObservatory, in most of the sources observations were not able to trace the\nemission from the hot core around the newly forming protostellar object. We\nwant to probe the physical conditions and water abundance in the inner layers\nof the host protostellar object NGC7538-IRS1 using a highly excited H2O line.\nWater maser models predict that several THz water masers should be detectable\nin these objects. We present SOFIA observations of the o-H2O 8(2,7)-7(3,4) line\nat 1296.41106 GHz and a 6(1,6)-5(2,3) 22 GHz e-MERLIN map of the region\n(first-ever 22 GHz images made after the e-MERLIN upgrade). In order to be able\nto constrain the nature of the emission - thermal or maser - we use\nnear-simultaneous observations of the 22 GHz water maser performed with the\nEffelsberg radiotelescope and e-MERLIN. A thermal water model using the RATRAN\nradiative transfer code is presented based on HIFI pointed observations.\nMolecular water abundances are derived for the hot core. The H2O 8(2,7)- 7(3,4)\nline is detected toward NGC7538-IRS1 with one feature at the source velocity\n(-57.7 km/s) and another one at -48.4 km/s. We propose that the emission at the\nsource velocity is consistent with thermal excitation and is excited in the\ninnermost part of the IRS1a massive protostellar object's closest circumstellar\nenvironment. The other emission is very likely the first detection of a water\nTHz maser line, pumped by shocks due to IRS1b outflow, in a star-forming\nregion. Assuming thermal excitation of the THz line, the water abundance in\nNGC7538-IRS1's hot core is estimated to be 5.2x10^{-5} with respect to H2.\n", "  Zero-field and transverse-field muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\\mu$SR)\nexperiments were undertaken in order to elucidate microscopic properties of a\nstrongly-coupled superconductor Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$ with $T_{\\text{c}}=9.8$ K.\nThe upper critical field extracted from the transverse-field $\\mu$SR data\nexhibits significant reduction with respect to the data from thermodynamic\nmeasurements indicating the coexistence of two independent length scales in the\nsuperconducting state. Accordingly, the temperature-dependent magnetic\npenetration depth of Mo$_{8}$Ga$_{41}$ is described using the model, in which\ntwo s-wave superconducting gaps are assumed. The V for Mo substitution in the\nparent compound leads to the complete suppression of one superconducting gap,\nand Mo$_{7}$VGa$_{41}$ is well described within the single s-wave gap scenario.\nThe reduction in the superfluid density and the evolution of the\nlow-temperature resistivity upon the V substitution indicate the emergence of a\ncompeting state in Mo$_{7}$VGa$_{41}$ that may be responsible for the closure\nof one of the superconducting gaps.\n", "  We present a further development of methods for analytical calculations of\nGreen's functions of lattice fermions based on recurrence relations. Applying\nit to tight-binding systems and topological superconductors in different\ndimensions we obtain a number of new results. In particular we derive an\nexplicit expression for arbitrary Green's function of an open Kitaev chain and\ndiscover non-local fermionic corner states in a 2D p-wave superconductor.\n", "  The ordinary time-dependent perturbation theory of quantum mechanics, that\ndescribes the interaction of a stationary system with a time-dependent\nperturbation, predicts that the transition probabilities induced by the\nperturbation are symmetric with respect to the initial an final states. Here we\nextend time-dependent perturbation theory into the non-Hermitian realm and\nconsider the transitions in a stationary Hermitian system, described by a\nself-adjoint Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$, induced by a time-dependent non-Hermitian\ninteraction $f(t) \\hat{P}$. In the weak interaction (perturbative) limit, the\ntransition probabilities generally turn out to be {\\it asymmetric} for exchange\nof initial and final states. In particular, for a temporal shape $f(t)$ of the\nperturbation with one-sided Fourier spectrum, i.e. with only positive (or\nnegative) frequency components, transitions are fully unidirectional, a result\nthat holds even in the strong interaction regime. Interestingly, we show that\nnon-Hermitian perturbations can be tailored to be transitionless, i.e. the\nperturbation leaves the system unchanged as if the interaction had not occurred\nat all, regardless the form of $\\hat{H}_0$ and $\\hat{P}$. As an application of\nthe results, we discuss asymmetric (chiral) behavior of dynamical encircling of\nan exceptional point in a two- and three-level system.\n", "  We study the Blume-Capel universality class in $d=\\frac{10}{3}-\\epsilon$\ndimensions. The RG flow is extracted by looking at poles in fractional\ndimension of three loop diagrams using $\\overline{\\rm MS}$. The theory is the\nonly nontrivial universality class which admits an expansion to three\ndimensions with $\\epsilon=\\frac{1}{3}<1$. We compute the relevant scaling\nexponents and estimate some of the OPE coefficients to the leading order. Our\nfindings agree with and complement CFT results. Finally we discuss a family of\nnonunitary multicritical models which includes the Lee-Yang and Blume-Capel\nclasses as special cases.\n", "  Context. Identification of planetary companions of giant stars is made\ndifficult because of the astrophysical noise, that may produce radial velocity\n(RV) variations similar to those induced by a companion. On the other hand any\nstellar signal is wavelength dependent, while signals due to a companion are\nachromatic. Aims. Our goal is to determine the origin of the Doppler periodic\nvariations observed in the thick disk K giant star TYC 4282-605-1 by HARPS-N at\nthe Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and verify if they can be due to the\npresence of a substellar companion. Methods. Several methods have been used to\nexclude the stellar origin of the observed signal including detailed analysis\nof activity indicators and bisector and the analysis of the photometric light\ncurve. Finally we have conducted an observational campaign to monitor the near\ninfrared (NIR) RV with GIANO at the TNG in order to verify whether the NIR\namplitude variations are comparable with those observed in the visible.\nResults. Both optical and NIR RVs show consistent variations with a period at\n101 days and similar amplitude, pointing to the presence of a companion\norbiting the target. The main orbital properties obtained for our giant star\nwith a derived mass of M=0.97+-0.03M_sun are\nM_Psini=10.78+-0.12MJ;P=101.54+-0.05days;e=0.28+-0.01 and a=0.422+-0.009AU. The\nchemical analysis shows a significant enrichment in the abundance of Nai, Mgi,\nAli and S i while the rest of analyzed elements are consistent with the solar\nvalue demonstrating that the chemical composition corresponds with an old K\ngiant (age = 10.1 Gyr) belonging to local thick disk. Conclusions. We conclude\nthat the substellar companion hypothesis for this K giant is the best\nexplanation for the observed periodic RV variation. This study also shows the\nhigh potential of multi-wavelength RV observations for the validation of planet\ncandidates.\n", "  We derive the finite temperature Keldysh response theory for interacting\nfermions in the presence of quenched disorder, as applicable to any of the 10\nAltland-Zirnbauer classes in an Anderson delocalized phase with at least a U(1)\ncontinuous symmetry. In this formulation of the interacting Finkel'stein\nnonlinear sigma model, the statistics of one-body wave functions are encoded by\nthe constrained matrix field, while physical correlations follow from the\nhydrodynamic density or spin response field, which decouples the interactions.\nIntegrating out the matrix field first, we obtain weak (anti)localization and\nAltshuler-Aronov quantum conductance corrections from the hydrodynamic response\nfunction. This procedure automatically incorporates the correct infrared\nphysics, and in particular gives the Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitsky (AAK)\nequations for dephasing of weak (anti)localization due to electron-electron\ncollisions. We explicate the method by deriving known quantum corrections in\ntwo dimensions for the symplectic metal class AII, as well as the spin-SU(2)\ninvariant superconductor classes C and CI. We show that conductance corrections\ndue to the special modes at zero energy in nonstandard classes are\nautomatically cut off by temperature, as previously expected, while the\nWigner-Dyson class Cooperon modes that persist to all energies are cut by\ndephasing. We also show that for short-ranged interactions, the standard\nself-consistent solution for the dephasing rate is equivalent to a diagrammatic\nsummation via the self-consistent Born approximation. This should be compared\nto the AAK solution for long-ranged Coulomb interactions, which exploits the\nMarkovian noise correlations induced by thermal fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field. We discuss prospects for exploring the many-body\nlocalization transition from the ergodic side as a dephasing catastrophe in\nshort-range interacting models.\n", "  We discuss the effect of the dynamics of D-branes on moduli stabilization in\ntype IIB string theory compactifications, with reference to a concrete toy\nmodel of T6/Z3 orientifold compactification with fractional D3-branes and\nanti-D3-branes at orbifold fixed points. The resulting attractive forces\nbetween anti-D3-branes and D3-branes, together with the repulsive forces\nbetween anti-D3-branes and O3-planes, can affect the stability of the compact\nspace. There are no complex structure moduli in T6/Z3 orientifold, which should\nthus capture some generic features of more general settings where all complex\nstructure moduli are stabilized by three-form fluxes. The simultaneous presence\nof branes and anti-branes brings along the breaking of supersymmetry. Non-BPS\ncombinations of this type are typical of \"brane supersymmetry breaking\", and\nare a necessary ingredient in the KKLT scenario for stabilizing the remaining\nKahler moduli. The conclusion of our analysis is that, while mutual D-brane\ninteractions sometimes help Kahler moduli stabilization, this is not always the\ncase.\n", "  The minimum energy paths for the migration of interstitial Mg in wurtzite GaN\nare studied through density functional calculations. The study also comprises\nLi, Na, and Be dopants to examine the dependence on size and charge of the\ndopant species. In all cases considered, the impurities diffuse like ions\nwithout any tendency of localizing charge. Li, Mg, and to some extent Na,\ndiffuse almost isotropically in GaN, with average diffusion barriers of 1.1,\n2.1, and 2.5 eV, respectively. Instead Be shows a marked anisotropy with energy\nbarriers of 0.76 and 1.88 eV for diffusion paths perpendicular and parallel to\nthe c-axis. The diffusion barrier generally increases with ionic charge and\nionic radius, but their interplay is not trivial. The calculated migration\nbarrier for Mg is consistent with the values estimated in a recent beta-\nemission channeling experiment.\n", "  Using multi-wavelength observation from SDO and STEREO, we investigated the\nmechanism of two successive eruptions (F1 & F2) of a filament in active region\nNOAA 11444 on 27 march, 2012. The filament was inverse `J' shaped and lying\nalong a quasi-circular polarity inversion line (PIL). The first part of the\nfilament (F1) erupted at ~2:30UT on 27 March 2012, the second part of the\nfilament (F2) erupted at around 4:20 UT on the same day. A precursor/pre-flare\nbrightening was observed below filament's main axis about 30 min prior to F1.\nThe brightening was followed by a jet-like ejection below filament, which\ntriggered the eruption. Before the eruption of F2, the filament seems to be\ntrapped within the overlying arcade loops almost for $\\sim$1.5~hr before its\nsuccessful eruption. Interestingly, we observed simultaneously contraction\n(~12km/s) and expansion (~20km/s) of arcade loops in the active region before\nF2. HMI magnetograms show the converging motion of the opposite polarities\nresulting in flux cancellation near PIL. We suggest that flux cancellation at\nPIL resulted jet-like ejection below filament's main axis, which triggered the\neruption F1 similar to tether-cutting process. The eruption F2 was triggered by\nremoval of the overlying arcade loops via reconnection process. Both filament\neruptions produced high speed (~1000km/s) CMEs.\n", "  We study thermalization in the holographic (1+1)-dimensional CFT after\nsimultaneous generation of two high-energy excitations in the antipodal points\non the circle. The holographic picture of such quantum quench is the creation\nof BTZ black hole from a collision of two massless particles. We perform\nholographic computation of entanglement entropy and mutual information in the\nboundary theory and analyze their evolution with time. We show that\nequilibration of the entanglement in the regions which contained one of the\ninitial excitations is generally similar to that in other holographic quench\nmodels, but with some important distinctions. We observe that entanglement\npropagates along a sharp effective light cone from the points of initial\nexcitations on the boundary. The characteristics of entanglement propagation in\nthe global quench models such as entanglement velocity and the light cone\nvelocity also have a meaning in the bilocal quench scenario. We also observe\nthe loss of memory about the initial state during the equilibration process. We\nfind that the memory loss reflects on the time behavior of the entanglement\nsimilarly to the global quench case, and it is related to the universal linear\ngrowth of entanglement, which comes from the interior of the forming black\nhole. We also analyze general two-point correlation functions in the framework\nof the geodesic approximation, focusing on the study of the late time behavior.\n", "  In most studies for the quantification of the third thermodynamic law, the\nminimum temperature which can be achieved with a long but finite-time process\nscales as a negative power of the process duration. In this article, we use our\nrecent complete solution for the optimal control problem of the quantum\nparametric oscillator to show that the minimum temperature which can be\nobtained in this system scales exponentially with the available time. The\npresent work is expected to motivate further research in the active quest for\nabsolute zero.\n", "  We compare a suite of four simulated dwarf galaxies formed in 10$^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$ haloes of collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) with galaxies\nsimulated in the same haloes with an identical galaxy formation model but a\nnon-zero cross-section for dark matter self-interactions. These cosmological\nzoom-in simulations are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE)\nproject and utilize the FIRE-2 model for hydrodynamics and galaxy formation\nphysics. We find the stellar masses of the galaxies formed in Self-Interacting\nDark Matter (SIDM) with $\\sigma/m= 1\\, cm^2/g$ are very similar to those in CDM\n(spanning $M_{\\star} \\approx 10^{5.7 - 7.0} M_{\\odot}$) and all runs lie on a\nsimilar stellar mass -- size relation. The logarithmic dark matter density\nslope ($\\alpha=d\\log \\rho / d\\log r$) in the central $250-500$ pc remains\nsteeper than $\\alpha= -0.8$ for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass\n$M_{\\star} \\sim 10^{6.6} M_{\\odot}$ and core-like in the most massive galaxy.\nIn contrast, every SIDM hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with\n$\\alpha >-0.4$. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs\nwithout baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2 baryonic\nphysics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the inclusion of\n(potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this mass scale,\nsuggesting SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM using low-mass galaxies. Our\nFIRE simulations predict that galaxies less massive than $M_{\\star} < 3 \\times\n10^6 M_{\\odot}$ provide potentially ideal targets for discriminating models,\nwith SIDM producing substantial cores in such tiny galaxies and CDM producing\ncusps.\n", "  The asymptotically flat structure of $\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supergravity in\nthree spacetime dimensions is explored. The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to $U(1)$\nfields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the\n$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide\nnontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to\nthe energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge. If\nthe spin structure is even, the same bound for the energy generically holds,\nunless the absolute value of the electric-like charge is less than minus the\nmass of Minkowski spacetime in vacuum, so that the energy has to be\nnonnegative. The explicit form of the Killing spinors is found for a wide class\nof configurations that fulfills our boundary conditions, and they exist\nprecisely when the corresponding bounds are saturated. It is also shown that\nthe spectra with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic\nfields are related by spectral flow, in a similar way as it occurs for the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Virasoro algebra. Indeed, our super-BMS$_3$ algebra can\nbe recovered from the flat limit of the superconformal algebra with\n$\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$, truncating the fermionic generators of the right copy.\n", "  Searching for top squark (stop) is a crucial task of the LHC. When the flavor\nconserving two body decays of the stop are kinematically forbidden, the stops\nproduced near the threshold will live long enough to form bound states which\nsubsequently decay through annihilation into the Standard Model (SM) final\nstates. In the region of stop mixing angle $\\theta_{\\tilde{t}} \\to 0$ or\n$\\pi/2$, we note that the LHC-13 TeV diphoton resonance data can give a strong\nbound on the spin-$0$ stoponium ($\\eta_{\\tilde{t}}$) and exclude the\nconstituent stop mass $m_{\\tilde{t}}$ up to about 290 GeV. While in the large\nstop mixing region, the stoponium will dominantly decay to the Higgs pair. By\nanalyzing the process $pp \\to \\eta_{\\tilde{t}} \\to h (\\to b\\bar{b} )h (\\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-)$, we find that a large portion of the parameter space on the\n$m_{\\tilde{t}_1}$ - $\\theta_{\\tilde{t}}$ plane can be probed at $2\\sigma$\nsignificance level at the LHC with the luminosity ${\\cal L}=3000$ fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  A higher moment analysis of multiplicity distribution is performed using the\nWeibull description of particle production in $pp\\,(p\\bar{p})$ collisions at\nSPS and LHC energies. The calculated normalized moments and factorial moments\nof Weibull distribution are compared to the measured data. The calculated\nWeibull moments are found to be in good agreement with the measured higher\nmoments (up to 5$^{\\rm{th}}$ order) reproducing the observed breaking of KNO\nscaling in the data. The moments for $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are\nalso predicted.\n", "  In this paper we use detailed Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that\nliquid xenon (LXe) can be used to build a Cherenkov-based TOF-PET, with an\nintrinsic coincidence resolving time (CRT) in the vicinity of 10 ps. This\nextraordinary performance is due to three facts: a) the abundant emission of\nCherenkov photons by liquid xenon; b) the fact that LXe is transparent to\nCherenkov light; and c) the fact that the fastest photons in LXe have\nwavelengths higher than 300 nm, therefore making it possible to separate the\ndetection of scintillation and Cherenkov light. The CRT in a Cherenkov LXe\nTOF-PET detector is, therefore, dominated by the resolution (time jitter)\nintroduced by the photosensors and the electronics. However, we show that for\nsufficiently fast photosensors (e.g, an overall 40 ps jitter, which can be\nachieved by current micro-channel plate photomultipliers) the overall CRT\nvaries between 30 and 55 ps, depending of the detection efficiency. This is\nstill one order of magnitude better than commercial CRT devices and improves by\na factor 3 the best CRT obtained with small laboratory prototypes.\n", "  A point charge in the presence of a metallic nanoshpere is a fundamental\nsetup, which has implications for Raman scattering, enhancement of spontaneous\nemission of a molecule by an antenna, sensing, and modeling a metallic tip in\nproximity to a nanoparticle. Here, we analytically expand the electric field of\na point charge in an $\\epsilon_{2}$ host medium in the presence of an\n$\\epsilon_{1}$ sphere using the sphere eigenstates, where $\\epsilon_1$ and\n$\\epsilon_2$ can take any values. Only the $m=0$ spherical harmonics are\nemployed in the expansion and the calculation of the potential and the electric\nfield is very simple. The electric field is strongly enhanced when\n$\\epsilon_{1}/\\epsilon_2$ is close to an $(\\epsilon_{1}/\\epsilon_2)_l$\neigenvalue of a dominant mode, which is determined by the point charge location\nand the measurement point. An electric field exists inside the sphere when\n$\\epsilon_{1}/\\epsilon_2$ is close to a $(\\epsilon_{1}/\\epsilon_2)_l$ resonance\neven when $\\epsilon_1$ is a conductor. Low order modes generate an electric\nfield far away from the interface, where the $l=1$ mode with a resonance at\n$\\epsilon_1=-2\\epsilon_2$ generates a field at the sphere center. The high\norder modes which are associated with high spatial frequencies become more\ndominant when the point charge approaches the sphere surface or when the\nphysical parameters are close the high order modes resonances. When\n$\\epsilon_{1}/\\epsilon_2$ is smaller or larger than the eigenvalues of the\ndominant modes, the modes interfere constructively and generate a strong signal\nat an angular direction equal to that of the source. The spectral information\nat the sphere surface may be utilized to calculate the point charge location\nwithout knowing its magnitude.\n", "  We calculate the polarization of prompt $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$(1S)\nproduction using the color evaporation model at leading order. We present the\npolarization parameter $\\lambda_\\vartheta$ as a function of center of mass\nenergy and rapidity in $p+p$ collisions. We also compare the $x_F$ dependence\nto experimental results in $p$+Cu and $\\pi$+W collisions, and predict the $x_F$\ndependence in $p$+Pb collisions at fixed-target energies. At energies far above\nthe $Q\\overline{Q}$ production threshold, we find the prompt $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\Upsilon$(1S) production to be longitudinally polarized with\n$\\lambda_\\vartheta^{J/\\psi}=-0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.16}$ and\n$\\lambda_\\vartheta^{\\Upsilon \\rm{(1S)}}=-0.69^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$. Both prompt\n$J/\\psi$ and prompt $\\Upsilon$(1S) are also longitudinally polarized at central\nrapidity, becoming transversely polarized at the most forward rapidities.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the many-emitter phonon laser based on optically\ndriven semiconductor quantum dots within an acoustic nanocavity. We map the\nphonon laser Hamiltonian to a Tavis-Cummings type interaction with an\nunexpected additional many-emitter energy shift. This many-emitter interaction\nwith the cavity mode results in a variety of resonances dependent on the number\nof participating emitters. We show that the many-emitter phonon laser also\nincludes the single emitter resonance besides these collective phenomena.\nHowever, we obtain a high quantum yield addressing these collective resonances.\nWe clearly demonstrate the best setup for maximal enhancement and show that the\noutput can be increased even more via lasing at the two phonon resonance.\n", "  We present the first QCD-based calculation of hadronic matrix elements with\npenguin topology determining direct CP-violating asymmetries in $D^0\\to\n\\pi^-\\pi^+$ and $D^0\\to K^- K^+$ nonleptonic decays. The method is based on the\nQCD light-cone sum rules and does not rely on any model-inspired amplitude\ndecomposition, instead leaning heavily on quark-hadron duality. We provide a\nStandard Model estimate of the direct CP-violating asymmetries in both pion and\nkaon modes and their difference and comment on further improvements of the\npresented computation.\n", "  It is usually thought that viscous torque works to align a circumbinary disk\nwith the binary's orbital plane. However, recent numerical simulations suggest\nthat the disk may evolve to a configuration perpendicular to the binary orbit\n(\"polar alignment\") if the binary is eccentric and the initial disk-binary\ninclination is sufficiently large. We carry out a theoretical study on the\nlong-term evolution of inclined disks around eccentric binaries, calculating\nthe disk warp profile and dissipative torque acting on the disk. For disks with\naspect ratio $H/r$ larger than the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, bending wave\npropagation effectively makes the disk precess as a quasi-rigid body, while\nviscosity acts on the disk warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the\ndisk-binary inclination. We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the\nbinary eccentricity and initial disk orientation) for the disk to evolve toward\npolar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disk has a non-negligible\nangular momentum compared to the binary, the final \"polar alignment\"\ninclination angle is reduced from $90^\\circ$. For typical protoplanetary disk\nparameters, the timescale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disk\nlifetime, suggesting that highly-inclined disks and planets may exist orbiting\neccentric binaries.\n", "  The development of a mechanics of non-differentiable paths suggested by Scale\nRelativity results in a foundation of Quantum Mechanics including\nSchr\\\"odinger's equation and all the other axioms under the assumption the path\nnon-differentiability can be described as a Wiener process at the\nresolution-scale of observation. This naturally brings under question the\npossibility that the statistics of the dynamics of macroscopic systems\nfulfilling this hypothesis could fall under a quantum-like description with the\nPlanck constant replaced with some other constant, possibly system specific,\nand corresponding to a diffusion coefficient. The observation of such a\nquantum-like dynamics would establish if the Scale Relativistic principle is\nimplemented in macroscopic complex or chaotic systems. This would have major\nimplications for the study of structure formation dynamics in various research\nfields. In this paper, I investigate the possibility for the detection of such\nan effect in the Brownian motion of a micro-sphere in an optical trap. I find\nthat, if it exists, the observation of the transition to a quantum-like regime\nis within reach of modern experiments.\n", "  The general space-time evolution of the scattering of an incident acoustic\nplane wave pulse by an arbitrary configuration of targets is treated by\nemploying a recently developed non-singular boundary integral method to solve\nthe Helmholtz equation in the frequency domain from which the fast Fourier\ntransform is used to obtain the full space-time solution of the wave equation.\nThe non-singular boundary integral solution can enforce the radiation boundary\ncondition at infinity exactly and can account for multiple scattering effects\nat all spacings between scatterers without adverse effects on the numerical\nprecision. More generally, the absence of singular kernels in the non-singular\nintegral equation confers high numerical stability and precision for smaller\nnumbers of degrees of freedom. The use of fast Fourier transform to obtain the\ntime dependence is not constrained to discrete time steps and is particularly\nefficient for studying the response to different incident pulses by the same\nconfiguration of scatterers. The precision that can be attained using a smaller\nnumber of Fourier components is also quantified.\n", "  Magnetic cycles have been detected in tens of solar-like stars. The\nrelationship between the cycle properties and global stellar parameters is not\nfully understood yet.\n  We searched for activity cycles in 90 solar-like stars with ages between 4\nand 95 Myr aiming to investigate the properties of activity cycles in this age\nrange.\n  We measured the length $P_{ cyc}$ of a given cycle by analyzing the long-term\ntime-series of three activity indexes. For each star, we computed also the\nglobal magnetic activity index <IQR> that is proportional to the amplitude of\nthe rotational modulation and is a proxy of the mean level of the surface\nmagnetic activity. We detected activity cycles in 67 stars. Secondary cycles\nwere also detected in 32 stars. The lack of correlation between $P_{ cyc}$ and\n$P_{ rot}$ suggest that these stars belong to the Transitional Branch and that\nthe dynamo acting in these stars is different from the solar one. This\nstatement is also supported by the analysis of the butterfly diagrams.\n  We computed the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_{ S}$ between $P_{ cyc}$,\n<IQR> and different stellar parameters. We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is\nuncorrelated with all the investigated parameters. The <IQR> index is\npositively correlated with the convective turn-over time-scale, the magnetic\ndiffusivity time-scale $\\tau_{ diff}$, and the dynamo number $D_{ N}$, whereas\nit is anti-correlated with the effective temperature $T_{ eff}$, the\nphotometric shear $\\Delta\\Omega_{\\rm phot}$ and the radius $R_{ C}$ at which\nthe convective zone is located.\n  We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is about constant and that <IQR> decreases with the\nstellare age in the range 4-95 Myr. We investigated the magnetic activity of AB\nDor A by merging ASAS time-series with previous long-term photometric data. We\nestimated the length of the AB Dor A primary cycle as $P_{ cyc} = 16.78 \\pm 2\n\\rm yr$.\n", "  The spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain exhibits a quantum critical regime\ncharacterized by quasi long-range magnetic order at zero temperature. We\nquantify the strength of quantum fluctuations in the ground state by\ndetermining the probability distributions of the components of the (staggered)\nsubsystem magnetization. Some of these exhibit scaling and the corresponding\nuniversal scaling functions can be determined by free fermion methods and by\nexploiting a relation with the boundary sine-Gordon model.\n", "  The H to tau tau decays form the prime channel for the measurement of the\nHiggs boson state and tests of the CP invariance of Higgs boson couplings. A\nprevious study has shown the viability of deep learning techniques for the\nmeasurement. In this paper, the study is expanded. Effects due to the partial\nmodelling of experimental effects are discussed. Furthermore, systematics due\nto ? decay modelling for complex cascade decays to tau^pm to a_1^pm nu_tau to\nrho^0 pi^pm nu_tau to 3pi^\\pm nu_tau are also addressed. Various\nparameterisations are considered using low-energy collision data.\n", "  Previously derived Lane consistent dispersive coupled-channel optical model\nfor nucleon scattering on $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U nuclei is extended to\ndescribe scattering on even-even actinides with $Z=$90--98. A\nsoft-rotator-model (SRM) description of the low-lying nuclear structure is\nused, where SRM Hamiltonian parameters are adjusted to the observed collective\nlevels of the target nucleus. SRM nuclear wave functions (mixed in $K$ quantum\nnumber) have been used to calculate coupling matrix elements of the generalized\noptical model. The \"effective\" deformations that define inter-band couplings\nare derived from SRM Hamiltonian parameters. Conservation of nuclear volume is\nenforced by introducing a dynamic monopolar term to the deformed potential\nleading to additional couplings between rotational bands. Fitted static\ndeformation parameters are in very good agreement with those derived by Wang\nand collaborators using the Weizs\\\"acker-Skyrme global mass model (WS4),\nallowing to use the latter to predict cross section for nuclei without\nexperimental data. A good description of scarce \"optical\" experimental database\nis achieved. SRM couplings and volume conservation allow a precise calculation\nof the compound-nucleus formation cross sections, which is significantly\ndifferent from the one calculated with rigid-rotor potentials coupling the\nground-state rotational band. Derived parameters can be used to describe both\nneutron and proton induced reactions.\n", "  Single-pixel imaging is an innovative imaging scheme and has received\nincreasing attentions in recent years. It is applicable to imaging at\nnon-visible wavelengths and imaging under low light conditions. However,\nsingle-pixel imaging has once encountered problems of low reconstruction\nquality and long data-acquisition time. This situation has been changed thanks\nto the developments of Hadamard single-pixel imaging (HSI) and Fourier\nsingle-pixel imaging (FSI). Both techniques are able to achieve high-quality\nand efficient imaging, remarkably improving the applicability of single-pixel\nimaging scheme. In this paper, we compare the performances of HSI and FSI with\ntheoretical analysis and experiments. The results show that FSI is more\nefficient than HSI while HSI is more noise-robust than FSI. Our work may\nprovide a guideline for researchers to choose suitable single-pixel imaging\ntechnique for their applications.\n", "  Analytical study of the rapidity distribution of the final state particles in\ndeep inelastic scattering at small x is presented. We separate and analyse\nthree sources of particle production: fragmentation of the quark-antiquark\npair, accompanying coherent soft gluon radiation due to octet color exchange in\nthe t-channel, and fragmentation of gluons that form parton distribution\nfunctions. Connection to Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) equations\nand the role of gluon reggezation are also discussed.\n", "  We report the first detection of HC$_{5}$$^{15}$N with the $J=9-8$ rotational\nline from the cyanopolyyne peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1 CP) using\nthe 45-m radio telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. The column density\nof HC$_{5}$$^{15}$N is derived to be (1.9 +- 0.5)*$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ (1\nsigma). We apply the double isotope method to derive the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N\nratios of HC$_{5}$N and HC$_{3}$N in TMC-1 CP. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios are\ncalculated to be 344 +- 53 and 257 +- 54 for HC$_{5}$N and HC$_{3}$N,\nrespectively. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of HC$_{5}$N is lower than the\nelemental ratio in the local interstellar medium (~440) and slightly higher\nthan that of HC$_{3}$N in TMC-1 CP. Since HC$_{3}$N is formed via the\nneutral-neutral reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN, the slightly higher\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of HC$_{5}$N may support our previous suggestions that\nthe main formation mechanism of HC$_{5}$N is the ion-molecule reactions between\nhydrocarbon ions (C$_{5}$H$_{n}^{+}$) and nitrogen atoms.\n", "  We study the system-size dependence of Knudsen number, a measure of degree of\nthermalization, for hadron resonance gas that follows the Lattice-QCD equation\nof state at zero chemical potential. A comparison between Knudsen numbers for\nthe AuAu collisions at RHIC and the hadron gas of size similar to the size of\nhigh-multiplicity pp events at LHC, reassures the applicability of\nhydrodynamics in interpreting the features of particle production in\nhigh-multiplicity pp events.\n", "  Most polarization-based BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) systems utilize\nmultiple lasers to generate one of four polarization quantum states randomly.\nHowever, random bit generation with multiple lasers can potentially open\ncritical side channels, which significantly endangers the security of QKD\nsystems. In this paper, we show unnoticed side channels of temporal disparity\nand intensity fluctuation, which possibly exist in the operation of multiple\nsemiconductor laser diodes. Experimental results show that the side channels\ncan enormously degrade security performance of QKD systems. An important system\nissue for the improvement of quantum bit error rate (QBER) related with laser\ndriving condition is furtherly addressed with experimental results.\n", "  The possible role of the triangle mechanism in the $B^-$ decay into\n$D^{*0}\\pi^-\\pi^0\\eta$ and $D^{*0}\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ is investigated. In this\nprocess, the triangle singularity appears from the decay of $B^-$ into\n$D^{*0}K^-K^{*0}$ followed by the decay of $K^{*0}$ into $\\pi^-K^+$ and the\nfusion of the $K^+K^-$ which forms the $a_0(980)$ or $f_0(980)$ which finally\ndecay into $\\pi^0\\eta$ or $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ respectively. The triangle mechanism\nfrom the $\\bar{K}^*K\\bar{K}$ loop generates a peak around 1420 MeV in the\ninvariant mass of $\\pi^-a_0$ or $\\pi^-f_0$, and gives sizable branching\nfractions $Br(B^-\\rightarrow D^{*0}\\pi^- a_0;a_0 \\rightarrow \\pi^0\\eta)= 1.66\n\\times 10^{-6}$ and $Br(B^-\\rightarrow D^{*0}\\pi^- f_0 ; f_0 \\rightarrow\n\\pi^+\\pi^-)= 2.82 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n", "  Applying a newly developed tangent-circle method (TCM), we derive a volume\ndensity map of HI gas in the inner Galaxy as a function of galacto-centric\ndistance $R$ and height $Z$. The HI hole around the Galactic Center (GC) is\nshown to have a crater-shaped wall, which coincides with the brightest ridge of\nthe North Polar Spur and emanates from the 3-kpc expanding ring. The crater\nstructure is explained by sweeping of the halo gas by a shock-wave from the GC.\nThe unperturbed HI halo outside 3 kpc is shown to be in hydrostatic\nequilibrium, obeying the sech$^2 Z/h$ density law with a scale height $h \\sim\n450$ pc.\n", "  It turns out that many integrable $\\sigma$-models on group manifolds belong\nto the class of the so-called ${ \\mathcal E}$-models which are relevant in the\ncontext of the Poisson-Lie T-duality. We show that this is the case also for\nthe Yang-Baxter $\\sigma$-model with WZNW term introduced by Delduc, Magro and\nVicedo in \\cite{DMV15}.\n", "  This work presents a joint and self-consistent Bayesian treatment of various\nforeground and target contaminations when inferring cosmological power-spectra\nand three dimensional density fields from galaxy redshift surveys. This is\nachieved by introducing additional block sampling procedures for unknown\ncoefficients of foreground and target contamination templates to the previously\npresented ARES framework for Bayesian large scale structure analyses. As a\nresult the method infers jointly and fully self-consistently three dimensional\ndensity fields, cosmological power-spectra, luminosity dependent galaxy biases,\nnoise levels of respective galaxy distributions and coefficients for a set of a\npriori specified foreground templates. In addition this fully Bayesian approach\npermits detailed quantification of correlated uncertainties amongst all\ninferred quantities and correctly marginalizes over observational systematic\neffects. We demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our approach in\nobtaining unbiased estimates of power-spectra via applications to realistic\nmock galaxy observations subject to stellar contamination and dust extinction.\nWhile simultaneously accounting for galaxy biases and unknown noise levels our\nmethod reliably and robustly infers three dimensional density fields and\ncorresponding cosmological power-spectra from deep galaxy surveys. Further our\napproach correctly accounts for joint and correlated uncertainties between\nunknown coefficients of foreground templates and the amplitudes of the\npower-spectrum. An effect amounting up to $10$ percent correlations and\nanti-correlations across large ranges in Fourier space.\n", "  We examine the phenomenology of the production, at the 13 TeV Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC), of a heavy resonance $X$, which decays via other new on-shell\nparticles $n$ into multi- (i.e.\\ three or more) photon final states. In the\nlimit that $n$ has a much smaller mass than $X$, the multi-photon final state\nmay dominantly appear as a two photon final state because the $\\gamma$s from\nthe $n$ decay are highly collinear and remain unresolved. We discuss how to\ndiscriminate this scenario from $X \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$: rather than\ndiscarding non-isolated photons, it is better instead to relax the isolation\ncriterion and instead form photon jet substructure variables. The spins of $X$\nand $n$ leave their imprint upon the distribution of pseudorapidity gap $\\Delta\n\\eta$ between the apparent two photon states. Depending on the total integrated\nluminosity, this can be used in many cases to claim discrimination between the\npossible spin choices of $X$ and $n$, although the case where $X$ and $n$ are\nboth scalar particles cannot be discriminated from the direct $X \\rightarrow\n\\gamma \\gamma$ decay in this manner. Information on the mass of $n$ can be\ngained by considering the mass of each photon jet.\n", "  The condensate density profile of trapped two-dimensional gas of photons in\nan optical microcavity, filled by a dye solution, is analyzed taking into\naccount a coordinate-dependent effective mass of cavity photons and\nphoton-photon coupling parameter. The profiles for the densities of the\nsuperfluid and normal phases of trapped photons in the different regions of the\nsystem at the fixed temperature are analyzed. The radial dependencies of local\nmean-field phase transition temperature $T_c^0 (r)$ and local\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature $T_c (r)$ for trapped microcavity\nphotons are obtained. The coordinate dependence of cavity photon effective mass\nand photon-photon coupling parameter is important for the mirrors of smaller\nradius with the high trapping frequency, which provides BEC and superfluidity\nfor smaller critical number of photons at the same temperature.\n  We discuss a possibility of an experimental study of the density profiles for\nthe normal and superfluid components in the system under consideration.\n", "  We present $ab$ $initio$ study of the electronic stopping power of protons\nand helium ions in an insulating material, HfO$_{2}$. The calculations are\ncarried out in channeling conditions with different impact parameters by\nemploying Ehrenfest dynamics and real--time, time--dependent density functional\ntheory. The satisfactory comparison with available experiments demonstrates\nthat this approach provides an accurate description of electronic stopping\npower. The velocity-proportional stopping power is predicted for protons and\nhelium ions in the low energy region, which conforms the linear response\ntheory. Due to the existence of wide band gap, a threshold effect in extremely\nlow velocity regime below excitation is expected. For protons, the threshold\nvelocity is observable, while it does not appear in helium ions case. This\nindicates the existence of extra energy loss channels beyond the electron--hole\npair excitation when helium ions are moving through the crystal. To analyze it,\nwe checked the charge state of the moving projectiles and an explicit charge\nexchange behavior between the ions and host atoms is found. The missing\nthreshold effect for helium ions is attributed to the charge transfer, which\nalso contributes to energy loss of the ion.\n", "  We present a public code to generate a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space\nassuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter\ndensity fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and\ncalculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter\nfields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise\nvelocity fields that is qualitatively similar to that of N-body simulations. We\ncheck fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation\nfunction and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We\nfind that a linear bias relation in the power spectrum does not guarantee a\nlinear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation\ncoefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We\nalso find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping\nprovides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is,\nnon-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the\nJacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales\nthat is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG)\neffect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not\ninclude random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in\nthe Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to\nFoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.\n", "  Investigating the interaction of electron beams with materials and light has\nbeen a field of research since more than a century. The field was advanced\ntheoretically by the raise of quantum mechanics and technically by the\nintroduction of electron microscopes and accelerators. It is possible nowadays\nto uncover a multitude of information from electron-induced excitations in\nmatter by means of advanced techniques like holography, tomography, and most\nrecently photon-induced near-field electron microscopy. The question is whether\nthe interaction can be controlled in an even more efficient way in order to\nunravel important questions like modal decomposition of the electron-induced\npolarization, by performing experiments with better spatial, temporal, and\nenergy resolutions. This review discusses recent advances in controlling the\nelectron and light interactions at the nanoscale. Theoretical and numerical\naspects of the interaction of electrons with nanostructures and metamaterials\nwill be discussed, with the aim to understand mechanisms of radiation in\ninteraction of electrons with even more sophisticated structures.\n", "  With in the extended thermodynamics, we give a comparative study of critical\nheat engines for Gauss-Bonnet and charged black holes in AdS in five\ndimensions, in the limit of large Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\\alpha$ and charge\n$q$, respectively. We show that the approach of efficiency of heat engines to\nCarnot limit in Gauss-Bonnet black holes is higher(lower) than charged black\nholes when corresponding parameters are small(large).\n", "  We study the optical properties of Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a model which\nfeatures, in addition to the usual term describing isolated Dirac cones\nproportional to the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$, a gap term $m$ and a Zeeman\nspin-splitting term $b$ with broken time reversal symmetry. Transport is\ntreated within Kubo formalism and particular attention is payed to the\nmodifications that result from a finite $m$ and $b$. We consider how these\nmodifications change when a finite residual scattering rate $\\Gamma$ is\nincluded. For $\\Gamma<m$ the A.C. conductivity as a function of photon energy\n$\\Omega$ continues to display the two quasilinear energy regions of the clean\nlimit for $\\Omega$ below the onset of the second electronic band which is\ngapped at ($ m+b $). For $\\Gamma$ of the order $m$ little trace of two distinct\nlinear energy scales remain and the optical response has evolved towards that\nfor $m=b=0$. Although some quantitative differences remain there are no\nqualitative differences. The magnitude of the D.C. conductivity\n$\\sigma^{DC}(T=0)$ at zero temperature ($T=0$) and chemical potential ($\\mu=0$)\nis altered. While it remains proportional to $\\Gamma$ it becomes inversely\ndependent on an effective Fermi velocity out of the Weyl nodes equal to\n$v_{F}^\\ast=v_{F}\\sqrt{b^2-m^2}/b$ which decreases strongly as the phase\nboundary between Weyl semimetal and gapped Dirac phase (GDSM) is approached at\n$b=m$. The leading term in the approach to $\\sigma^{DC}(T=0)$ for finite\n$T/\\Gamma$, $\\mu/\\Gamma$ and $\\Omega/\\Gamma$ is found to be quadratic. The\ncoefficient of these corrections tracks closely the $b/m$ dependence of the\n$\\mu=T=\\Omega=0$ limit with differences largest near to the WSM-GDSM boundary.\n", "  The ease of integration coupled with large second-order nonlinear coefficient\nof atomically thin layered 2D materials presents a unique opportunity to\nrealize second-order nonlinearity in silicon compatible integrated photonic\nsystem. However, the phase matching requirement for second-order nonlinear\noptical processes makes the nanophotonic design difficult. We show that by\nnano-patterning the 2D material, quasi-phase matching can be achieved. Such\npatterning based phase-matching could potentially compensate for inevitable\nfabrication errors and significantly simplify the design process of the\nnonlinear nano-photonic devices.\n", "  We study the nonclassicality of the evolution of a superposition of an\narbitrary number of photon-added squeezed coherent Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states\nin a nonlinear Kerr medium. The nonlinearity of the medium gives rise to the\nperiodicities of the quantities such as the Wehrl entropy $S_{Q}$ and the\nnegativity $\\delta_{W}$ of the $W$-distribution, and a series of local minima\nof these quantities arise at the rational submultiples of the said period. At\nthese local minima the evolving state coincides with the transient Yurke-Stoler\ntype of photon-added squeezed kitten states, which, for the choice of the phase\nspace variables reflecting their macroscopic nature, show extremely short-lived\nbehavior. Proceeding further we provide the closed form tomograms, which\nfurnish the alternate description of these short-lived states. The increasing\ncomplexity in the kitten formations induces more number of interference terms\nthat trigger more quantumness of the corresponding states. The nonclassical\ndepth of the photon-added squeezed kitten states are observed to be of maximum\npossible value. Employing the Lindblad master equation approach we study the\namplitude and the phase damping models for the initial state considered here.\nIn the phase damping model the nonclassicality is not completely erased even in\nthe long time limit when the dynamical quantities, such as the negativity\n$\\delta_{W}$ and the tomogram, assume nontrivial asymptotic values.\n", "  The many-body localization (MBL) is commonly related to a strong spatial\ndisorder. We show that MBL may alternatively be generated by adding a temporal\ndisorder to periodically driven many-body systems. We reach this conclusion by\nmapping the evolution of such systems on the dynamics of the time-independent,\ndisordered, Hubbard-like models. Our result opens the way to experimental\nstudies of MBL in systems that reveal crystalline structures in the time\ndomain. In particular, we discuss two relevant setups which can be implemented\nin experiments on ultra-cold atomic gases.\n", "  To model the cold dust emission observed in the diffuse interstellar medium,\nin dense molecular clouds or in cold clumps that could eventually form new\nstars, it is mandatory to know the physical and spectroscopic properties of\nthis dust and to understand its emission. This work is a continuation of\nprevious studies aiming at providing astronomers with spectroscopic data of\nrealistic cosmic dust analogues for the interpretation of observations.\nFerromagnesium amorphous silicate dust analogues were produced with a mean\ncomposition close to $\\mathrm{Mg_{1-x}Fe_{x}SiO_3}$ with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,\n0.4. Part of each sample was annealed at 500$^{\\circ}$C for two hours in a\nreducing atmosphere to modify the oxidation state of iron. We have measured the\nmass absorption coefficient (MAC) of these ferromagnesium amorphous silicate\ndust analogues in the spectral domain 30 - 1000 $\\mu$m for grain temperature in\nthe range 10 - 300 K and at room temperature in the 5 - 40 $\\mu$m range. The\nMAC of ferromagnesium samples behaves in the same way as the MAC of pure\nMg-rich amorphous silicate samples. In the 30 - 300 K range, the MAC increases\nwith increasing grain temperature whereas in the range 10 - 30 K, we do not see\nany change of the MAC. The MAC cannot be described by a single power law in\n${\\lambda}^{-\\beta}$. The MAC of all the samples is much higher than the MAC\ncalculated by dust models. The complex behavior of the MAC of amorphous\nsilicates with wavelength and temperature is observed whatever the exact\nsilicate composition (Mg vs. Fe amount). It is a universal characteristic of\namorphous materials, and therefore of amorphous cosmic silicates, that should\nbe taken into account in astronomical modeling. The enhanced MAC of the\nmeasured samples compared to the MAC calculated for cosmic dust model implies\nthat dust masses are overestimated by the models.\n", "  Experiments are presented that demonstrate how liquid-infused surfaces can\nreduce turbulent drag significantly in Taylor-Couette flow. The test liquid was\nwater, and the test surface was composed of square microscopic grooves\nmeasuring 100 $\\mu$m to 800 $\\mu$m, filled with alkane liquids with viscosities\nfrom 0.3 to 1.4 times that of water. We achieve drag reduction exceeding 35\\%,\nfour times higher than previously reported for liquid-infused surfaces in\nturbulent flow. The level of drag reduction increased with viscosity ratio,\ngroove width, fluid area fraction, and Reynolds number. The optimum groove\nwidth was given by $w^+ \\approx 35$.\n", "  We present a systematic, top-down, thermodynamic parametrization scheme for\ndissipative particle dynamics (DPD) using water-octanol partition coefficients,\nsupplemented by water-octanol phase equilibria and pure liquid phase density\ndata. We demonstrate the feasibility of computing the required partition\ncoefficients in DPD using brute-force simulation, within an adaptive\nsemi-automatic staged optimization scheme. We test the methodology by fitting\nto experimental partition coefficient data for twenty one small molecules in\nfive classes comprising alcohols and poly-alcohols, amines, ethers and simple\naromatics, and alkanes (i.e. hexane). Finally, we illustrate the\ntransferability of a subset of the determined parameters by calculating the\ncritical micelle concentrations of selected alkyl ethoxylate surfactants, in\ngood agreement with reported experimental values.\n", "  A chain of cofacial molecules with CN or CNh symmetry supports excitonic\nstates with a screw-like structure. These can be quantified with the\ncombination of an axial wavenumber and an azimuthal winding number.\nCombinations of these states can be used to construct excitonic wave packets\nthat spiral down the chain with well-determined linear and angular momenta.\nThese twisted exciton wave packets can be created and annihilated using laser\npulses, and their angular momentum can be optically modified during transit.\nThis allows for the creation of opto-excitonic circuits in which information,\nencoded in the angular momentum of light, is converted into excitonic wave\npackets that can be manipulated, transported, and then re-emitted. A\ntight-binding paradigm is used to demonstrate the key ideas. The approach is\nthen extended to quantify the evolution of twisted exciton wave packets in a\nmany-body, multi-level time-domain density functional theory setting. In both\nsettings, numerical methods are developed that allow the site-to-site transfer\nof angular momentum to be quantified.\n", "  We propose a method to map the temperature distribution of the hot gas in\ngalaxy clusters that uses resolved images of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(tSZ) effect in combination with X-ray data. Application to images from the New\nIRAM KIDs Array (NIKA) and XMM-Newton allows us to measure and determine the\nspatial distribution of the gas temperature in the merging cluster MACS\nJ0717.5+3745, at $z=0.55$. Despite the complexity of the target object, we find\na good morphological agreement between the temperature maps derived from X-ray\nspectroscopy only -- using XMM-Newton ($T_{\\rm XMM}$) and Chandra ($T_{\\rm\nCXO}$) -- and the new gas-mass-weighted tSZ+X-ray imaging method ($T_{\\rm\nSZ}$). We correlate the temperatures from tSZ+X-ray imaging and those from\nX-ray spectroscopy alone and find that $T_{\\rm SZ}$ is higher than $T_{\\rm\nXMM}$ and lower than $T_{\\rm CXO}$ by $\\sim 10\\%$ in both cases. Our results\nare limited by uncertainties in the geometry of the cluster gas, contamination\nfrom kinetic SZ ($\\sim 10\\%$), and the absolute calibration of the tSZ map\n($7\\%$). Investigation using a larger sample of clusters would help minimise\nthese effects.\n", "  We study the spin-$S$ Kitaev model in the classical ($S \\to \\infty$) limit\nusing Monte Carlo simulations combined with semi-classical spin dynamics. We\ndiscuss differences and similarities in the dynamical structure factors of the\nspin-$1/2$ and the classical Kitaev liquids. Interestingly, the low-temperature\nand low-energy spectrum of the classical model exhibits a finite energy peak,\nwhich is the precursor of the one produced by the Majorana modes of the $S=1/2$\nmodel. The classical peak is spectrally narrowed compared to the quantum result\nand can be explained by magnon excitations within fluctuating one-dimensional\nmanifolds (loops). Hence the difference from the classical limit to the quantum\nlimit can be understood by the fractionalization of magnons propagating in\none-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, we show that the momentum space\ndistribution of the low-energy spectral weight of the $S=1/2$ model follows the\nmomentum space distribution of zero modes of the classical model.\n", "  In this work we describe the thermodynamics and mechanism of CO$_2$\npolymorphic transitions under pressure from form I to form III combining\nstandard molecular dynamics, well-tempered metadynamics and committor analysis.\nWe find that the phase transformation takes place through a concerted\nrearrangement of CO$_2$ molecules, which unfolds via an anisotropic expansion\nof the CO$_2$ supercell. Furthermore, at high pressures we find that defected\nform I configurations are thermodynamically more stable with respect to form I\nwithout structural defects. Our computational approach shows the capability of\nsimultaneously providing an extensive sampling of the configurational space,\nestimates of the thermodynamic stability and a suitable description of a\ncomplex, collective polymorphic transition mechanism.\n", "  General relativity predicts that clocks run more slowly near massive objects.\nThe effect is small---a clock at sea level lags behind one 1000 m above sea\nlevel by only 9.4 ns/day. Here, we demonstrate that a measurement of this\neffect can be done by undergraduate students. Our paper describes an experiment\nconducted by undergraduate researchers at Colorado College and the United\nStates Air Force Academy to measure gravitational time dilation. The\nmeasurement was done by comparing the signals generated by a GPS frequency\nstandard (sea-level time) to a Cs-beam frequency standard at seven different\naltitudes above sea level. We found that our measurements are consistent with\nthe predictions of general relativity.\n", "  We report on further evidence that solar energetic particles are organized by\nthe kinematic properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)[1]. In particular, we\nfocus on the starting frequency of type II bursts, which is related to the\ndistance from the Sun where the radio emission starts. We find that the three\ngroups of solar energetic particle (SEP) events known to have distinct values\nof CME initial acceleration, also have distinct average starting frequencies of\nthe associated type II bursts. SEP events with ground level enhancement (GLE)\nhave the highest starting frequency (107 MHz), while those associated with\nfilament eruption (FE) in quiescent regions have the lowest starting frequency\n(22 MHz); regular SEP events have intermediate starting frequency (81 MHz).\nTaking the onset time of type II bursts as the time of shock formation, we\ndetermine the shock formation heights measured from the Sun center. We find\nthat the shocks form on average closest to the Sun (1.51 Rs) in GLE events,\nfarthest from the Sun in FE SEP events (5.38 Rs), and at intermediate distances\nin regular SEP events (1.72 Rs). Finally, we present the results of a case\nstudy of a CME with high initial acceleration (~3 km s^-2) and a type II radio\nburst with high starting frequency (~200 MHz) but associated with a minor SEP\nevent. We find that the relation between the fluence spectral index and CME\ninitial acceleration continues to hold even for this minor SEP event.\n", "  In this note we investigate Gra{\\ss}mannian formulas for form factors of the\nchiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal\nYang-Mills theory. We present an all-$n$ contour for the $G(3,n+2)$\nGra{\\ss}mannian integral of NMHV form factors derived from on-shell diagrams\nand the BCFW recursion relation. In addition, we study other $G(3,n+2)$\nformulas obtained from the connected prescription introduced recently. We find\na recursive expression for all $n$ and study its properties. For $n \\geq 6$,\nour formula has the same recursive structure as its amplitude counterpart,\nmaking its soft behaviour manifest. Finally, we explore the connection between\nthe two Gra{\\ss}mannian formulations, using the global residue theorem, and\nfind that it is much more intricate compared to scattering amplitudes.\n", "  Vanadium oxides are among the most promising materials that can be used as\nelectrodes in rechargeable metal-ion batteries. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate thermodynamic, electronic and kinetic properties associated with\nthe insertion of Li, Mg and Al atoms in rutile VO2. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we systematically study the structural evolution and voltage\ncurves of LixVO2, MgxVO2 and AlxVO2 (0<x<1) compounds. The calculated lithium\nintercalation voltage starts at 3.50 V for single-atom insertion and decreases\nto 2.23 V for full lithiation, to the LiVO2 compound, which agrees well with\nexperimental results. The Mg insertion features a plateau about 1.6 V up to\nMg0.5VO2 and then another plateau-like region at around 0.5 V up to Mg1VO2. The\npredicted voltage curve for Al insertion starts at 1.98 V, followed by two\nplateaus at 1.48 V and 1.17 V. The diffusion barrier of Li, Mg and Al in the\ntunnel structure of VO2 is 0.06, 0.33 and 0.50 eV, respectively. The\ndemonstrated excellent Li, Mg and Al mobility, high structural stability and\nhigh specific capacity suggest a promising potential of rutile VO2 electrodes\nespecially for multivalent batteries.\n", "  We present a generalized 4 $\\times$ 4 matrix formalism for the description of\nlight propagation in birefringent stratified media. In contrast to previous\nwork, our algorithm is capable of treating arbitrarily anisotropic or\nisotropic, absorbing or non-absorbing materials and is free of discontinous\nsolutions. We calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients and derive\nequations for the electric field distribution for any number of layers. The\nalgorithm is easily comprehensible and can be straight forwardly implemented in\na computer program. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we\ncalculate the reflectivities, electric field distributions, and dispersion\ncurves for surface phonon polaritons excited in the Otto geometry for selected\nmodel systems, where we observe several distinct phenomena ranging from\ncritical coupling to mode splitting, and surface phonon polaritons in\nhyperbolic media.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses individual light quanta in quantum\nsuperposition states to guarantee unconditional communication security between\ndistant parties. In practice, the achievable distance for QKD has been limited\nto a few hundred kilometers, due to the channel loss of fibers or terrestrial\nfree space that exponentially reduced the photon rate. Satellite-based QKD\npromises to establish a global-scale quantum network by exploiting the\nnegligible photon loss and decoherence in the empty out space. Here, we develop\nand launch a low-Earth-orbit satellite to implement decoy-state QKD with over\nkHz key rate from the satellite to ground over a distance up to 1200 km, which\nis up to 20 orders of magnitudes more efficient than that expected using an\noptical fiber (with 0.2 dB/km loss) of the same length. The establishment of a\nreliable and efficient space-to-ground link for faithful quantum state\ntransmission constitutes a key milestone for global-scale quantum networks.\n", "  The production of spin-polarized currents in pristine carbon nanotubes with\nRashba spin-orbit interaction has been shown to be very sensitive to the\nsymmetry of the tubes and the geometry of the setup. Here we analyze the role\nof defects on the spin quantum conductances of metallic carbon nanotubes due to\nan external electric field. We show that localized defects, such as adsorbed\nhydrogen atoms or pentagon-heptagon pairs, increase the Rashba spin-polarized\ncurrent. Moreover, this enhancement takes place for energies closer to the\nFermi energy as compared to the response of pristine tubes. Such increment can\nbe even larger when several equally spaced defects are introduced into the\nsystem. We explore different arrangements of defects, showing that for certain\ngeometries there are flips of the spin-polarized current and even transport\nsuppression. Our results indicate that spin valve devices at the nanoscale may\nbe achieved via defect engineering in carbon nanotubes.\n", "  The current generation of Cherenkov telescopes, together with Fermi-LAT, have\ngreatly increased our knowledge of $\\gamma$-ray blazars. Among them, the\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object (HBL) PKS1424+240 (z $\\simeq$ 0.6) is\nthe farthest persistent emitter of very-high-energy (VHE; E $\\geq$ 100 GeV)\n$\\gamma$-ray photons. Current emission models can satisfactorily reproduce\ntypical blazar emission assuming that the dominant emission process is\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) in HBLs; and external-inverse-Compton (EIC) in\nLBLs and FSRQs. Hadronic models are also able to correctly reproduce the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from blazars, although they are in general disfavoured\nfor bright quasars and rapid flares.The blazar PKS1424+240 is a rare example of\na luminous HBL, and we aim to determine which is the emission process most\nlikely responsible for its $\\gamma$-ray emission. This will impact more\ngenerally our comprehension of blazar emission models, and how they are related\nto the luminosity of the source and the peak frequency. We investigate\ndifferent blazar emission models applied to the SED of PKS1424+240. Among\nleptonic models, we study a 1-zone SSC model, a 2-zone SSC model, and an EIC\nmodel. We then investigate a blazar hadronic model, and finally a scenario in\nwhich the $\\gamma$-ray emission is associated with cascades in the\nline-of-sight produced by cosmic rays from the source. After a systematic study\nof the parameter space of the one-zone SSC model, we conclude that this\nscenario is not compatible with $\\gamma$-ray observations of PKS1424+240. A\ntwo-zone SSC scenario can alleviate this issue, as well as an EIC solution. For\nthe latter, the external photon field is assumed to be the infra-red radiation\nfrom the dusty torus. Alternatively, hadronic models can satisfactorily\nreproduce the $\\gamma$-ray emission from PKS1424+240, both as in-source\nemission and as cascade emission.\n", "  GaN/SiO2 core/shell nanowires are grown by cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst\nassisted vapor-liquid-solid route, in which Si wafer coated with a mixture of\ngallium and indium is used as the source for Ga and Si and ammonia is used as\nthe precursor for nitrogen and hydrogen. Gallium in the presence of indium and\nhydrogen, which results from the dissociation of ammonia, forms Si-Ga-In alloy\nat the growth temperature around 910 degree Celsius. This alloy acts as the\nsource of Si, Ga and In. A detailed study using a variety of characterization\ntools reveals that these wires, which are several tens of micron long, has a\ndiameter distribution of the core ranging from 20 to 50 nm, while the thickness\nof the amorphous SiO2 shell layer is about 10 nm. These wires grow along\ndirection. It has also been observed that the average width of these wires\ndecreases, while their density increases as the gallium proportion in the Ga-In\nmixture is increased.\n", "  An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be precisely measured or perfectly\nreplicated. However, quantum teleportation allows faithful transfer of unknown\nquantum states from one object to another over long distance, without physical\ntravelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation has been\nrecognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum\nnetworks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous\nteleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance\non the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or\nterrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a\nglobal-scale \"quantum internet\" is to significantly extend the range for\nteleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite\nplatform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points\non the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons'\npropagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum\nteleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to\na low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up\nto 1400 km. To optimize the link efficiency and overcome the atmospheric\nturbulence in the up-link, a series of techniques are developed, including a\ncompact ultra-bright source of multi-photon entanglement, narrow beam\ndivergence, high-bandwidth and high-accuracy acquiring, pointing, and tracking\n(APT). We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation for six input states in\nmutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of 0.80+/-0.01, well above the\nclassical limit. This work establishes the first ground-to-satellite up-link\nfor faithful and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation, an essential step\ntoward global-scale quantum internet.\n", "  We report a solar jet phenomenon associated with successive flares on\nNovember 10th 2014. These explosive events were involved with the satellite\nspots' emergence around a delta-type sunspot in the decaying active region NOAA\n12205. The data of this jet was provided by Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO),\nX-Ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Hinode, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS) and Domeless Solar Telescope (DST) at Hida Observatory, Kyoto\nUniversity. These plentiful data enabled us to present this series of papers to\ndiscuss the entire processes of the observed phenomena including the energy\nstorage, event trigger, and energy release. In this paper, we focus on the\nenergy build-up and trigger phases, by analyzing the photospheric horizontal\nflow field around the active region with an optical flow method. The analysis\nreveals the following three. (i) The observed explosive phenomena involved\nthree satellite spots, the magnetic fluxes of which successively reconnected\nwith their pre-existing ambient fields. (ii) All of these satellite spots\nemerged in the moat region of a pivotal delta-type sunspot, especially near its\nconvergent boundary with the neighboring supergranules or moat regions of\nadjacent sunspots. (iii) Around the jet ejection site, the positive polarities\nof satellite spot and adjacent emerging flux encountered the global magnetic\nfield with negative polarity in the moat region of the pivotal delta-type\nsunspot, and thus the polarity inversion line was formed along the convergent\nboundary of the photospheric horizontal flow channels.\n", "  Under high pressures, phase transition, as well as deformation twins, are\nconstantly reported in many BCC metals, whose interactions are of fundamental\nimportance to understand strengthen mechanism of these metals under extreme\nconditions. However, the interactions between twins and phase transition in BCC\nmetals are remain largely unexplored. In this work, interactions between\ncoherent twin boundaries and $\\alpha \\to \\epsilon$ phase transition of iron are\ninvestigated using both non- equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and\nnudge elastic band method. Mechanisms of both twin-assisted phase transition\nand reverse phase transition are studied and orientation relationships between\nBCC and HCP phase are found to be <11-1>BCC || <-12-10>HCP and <1-10>BCC ||\n<0001>HCP for both cases. The twin boundary corresponds to after the phase\ntransition. It is amazing that the reverse transition seems to be able to\n\"memory\" and recover the initial BCC twins. The memory would partly loss when\nplastic slips take place in the HCP phase before the reverse transition. In the\nrecovered initial BCC twins, three major twin spacing are observed, which are\nwell explained in terms of energy barriers of the transition from HCP phase to\nBCC twin. Besides, variant selection rule of the twin assisted phase transition\nis also discussed. The results of present work could be expected to give some\nclues for producing ultra-fine grain structure in materials exhibiting\nmartensitic phase transition.\n", "  Fully analytic expressions, for the electric and magnetic fields of an\nultrashort and tightly focused laser pulse of the radially polarized category,\nare presented to lowest order of approximation. The fields are derived from\nscalar and vector potentials, along the lines of our earlier work for a similar\npulse of the linearly polarized variety. A systematic program is also described\nfrom which the fields may be obtained to any desired accuracy, analytically or\nnumerically.\n", "  We discuss the main signatures of the Bilepton Model at the Large Hadron\nCollider, focusing on its gauge boson sector. The model is characterised by\nfive additional gauge bosons, four charged and one neutral, beyond those of the\nStandard Model, plus three exotic quarks. The latter turn into ordinary quarks\nwith the emission of bilepton doublets $(Y^{++},Y^{+})$ and $(Y^{--},Y^{-})$ of\nlepton number $L=-2$ and $L=+2$ respectively, with the doubly-charged bileptons\ndecaying into same-sign lepton pairs. We perform a phenomenological analysis\ninvestigating processes with two doubly-charged bileptons and two jets at the\nLHC and find that, setting suitable cuts on pseudorapidities and transverse\nmomenta of final-states jets and leptons, the model yields a visible signal and\nthe main Standard Model backgrounds can be suppressed. Compared to previous\nstudies, our investigation is based on a full Monte Carlo implementation of the\nmodel and accounts for parton showers, hadronization and an actual\njet-clustering algorithm for both signal and Standard Model background, thus\nproviding an optimal framework for an actual experimental search.\n", "  We show that generalized spherical harmonics are well suited for representing\nthe space and orientation molecular density in the resolution of the molecular\ndensity functional theory. We consider the common system made of a rigid solute\nof arbitrary complexity immersed in a molecular solvent, both represented by\nmolecules with interacting atomic sites and classical force fields. The\nmolecular solvent density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{\\Omega})$ around the solute\nis a function of the position $\\mathbf{r}\\equiv(x,y,z)$ and of the three Euler\nangles $\\mathbf{\\Omega}\\equiv(\\theta,\\phi,\\psi)$ describing the solvent\norientation. The standard density functional, equivalent to the HNC closure for\nthe solute-solvent correlations in the liquid theory, is minimized with respect\nto $\\rho(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{\\Omega})$. The up-to-now very expensive angular\nconvolution products are advantageously replaced by simple products between\nprojections onto generalized spherical harmonics. The dramatic gain in speed of\nresolution enables to explore in a systematic way molecular solutes of up to\nnanometric sizes in arbitrary solvents and to calculate their solvation free\nenergy and associated microscopic solvent structure in at most a few minutes.\nWe finally illustrate the formalism by tackling the solvation of molecules of\nvarious complexity in water.\n", "  We address memory effects and diffusive properties of a continuous-time\nquantum walk on a one-dimensional percolation lattice affected by spatially\ncorrelated random telegraph noise. In particular, by introducing spatially\ncorrelated time-dependent fluctuations in nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes,\nwe describe random domains characterized by global noise. The resulting open\ndynamics of the walker is then unraveled by an ensemble average over all the\nnoise realizations. Our results show that time-dependent noise assisted by\nspatial correlations leads to strong memory effects in the walker dynamics and\nto robust diffusive behavior against the detrimental action of uncorrelated\nnoise. We also show that spatially correlated classical noise enhances\nlocalization breaking, thus making a quantum particle spread on longer\ndistances across the lattice.\n", "  We reported a phenomenon that when exerting an electric field gradient across\na liquid metal/electrolyte interface, a droplet of the same liquid metal can\npersistently surf on the interface without coalescence. A thin layer of the\nintermediate solution, which separates the droplet from direct metallic\ncontacting and provides the levitating force, is responsible for such surfing\neffect. The electric resistance of this solution film is measured and the film\nthickness is further theoretically calculated. The fact that the levitating\nstate can be switched on and off via a controlled manner paves a way for\nreliable manipulation of liquid metal droplet.\n", "  Starting from the quantum fluctuation of current in the mesoscopic composite\nright-left handed transmission line (CRLH-TL) in the thermal Fock state, we\ninvestigate the left-handedness dependent of the frequencies, intensity and\nquantum fluctuations of the current field in the CRLH-TL under different\nthermal environment. The results show that the intensity and quantum\nfluctuations of current field in lower frequency bands affect the\nleft-handedness distinctly under different thermal environment. The thermal\neffect on the left-handedness in the mesoscopic CRLH-TL deserves further\nexperimental investigation in its miniaturization application.\n", "  Pure massive gravity is strongly coupled at a certain low scale, known as\nLambda_3. I show that the theory can be embedded into another one, with new\nlight degrees of freedom, to increase the strong scale to a significantly\nlarger value. Certain universal aspects of the proposed mechanism are\ndiscussed, notably that the coupling of the longitudinal mode to a\nstress-tensor is suppressed, thus making the linear theory consistent with the\nfifth-force exclusion. An example of the embedding theory studied in detail is\n5D AdS massive gravity, with a large cosmological constant. In this example the\n4D strong scale can be increased by 19 orders of magnitude. Holographic duality\nthen suggests that the strong scale of the 4D massive gravity can be increased\nby coupling it to a 4D non-local CFT, endowed with a UV cutoff; however, the 5D\nclassical gravity picture appears to be more tractable.\n", "  Using the multipole expansion of electromagnetic (EM) field, we present the\nangular magnetoelectric (AME) coupling in irreducible tensor form. We evaluate\nthe matrix elements when the radiation source is described by electronic\ntransitions in atomic systems. The results indicate that the energy corrections\nincrease for short wavelengths and large charge number.\n", "  The rate of physical aging of glassy polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), followed\nfrom the change in the secondary relaxation with aging, is found to be\nindependent of the density, the latter controlled by the pressure during glass\nformation. Thus, the aging behavior of the secondary relaxation is the same\nwhether the glass is more compacted or less dense than the corresponding\nequilibrium liquid. This equivalence in aging of glasses formed under different\npressures indicates that local packing is the dominant variable governing the\nglassy dynamics. One consequence is that pressure densification yields a\nreduction in the glass transition temperature. The fact that pressure\ndensification yields different glass structures is at odds with a model for\nnon-associated materials having dynamic properties exhibited by PMMA, such as\ndensity scaling of the relaxation time and isochronal superposition of the\nrelaxation dispersion.\n", "  The magnitude of the high frequency, static dielectric permittivity is used\nto determine the density of tetramethyl tetraphenyl trisiloxane, a\nnon-associated glass-forming liquid, as a function of temperature and pressure.\nWe demonstrate that the properties in the glassy state are affected by the\npressure applied to the liquid during vitrification. This behavior is normal\nfor hydrogen-bonded liquids and polymers, but unanticipated by models of simple\nliquids.\n", "  Jets in long-duration $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) have to drill through the\ncollapsing star in order to break out of it and produce the $\\gamma$-ray signal\nwhile the central engine is still active. If the breakout time is shorter for\nmore powerful engines, then the jet-collapsar interaction acts as a filter of\nless luminous jets. We show that the observed broken power-law GRB luminosity\nfunction is a natural outcome of this process. For a theoretically motivated\nbreakout time that scales with jet luminosity as $L^{-\\chi}$ with $\\chi\\sim\n1/3-1/2$, we show that the shape of the $\\gamma$-ray duration distribution can\nbe uniquely determined by the GRB luminosity function and matches the observed\none. This analysis has also interesting implications about the\nsupernova-central engine connection. We show that not only successful jets can\ndeposit sufficient energy in the stellar envelope to power the GRB-associated\nsupernovae, but also failed jets may operate in all Type Ib/c supernovae.\n", "  We address propagation of light in nonlinear twisted multi-core fibers with\nalternating amplifying and absorbing cores that are arranged into the PT -\nsymmetric structure. In this structure, the coupling strength between\nneighboring cores and global energy transport can be controlled not only by the\nnonlinearity strength, but also by gain and losses and by the fiber twisting\nrate. The threshold level of gain/losses, at which PT -symmetry breaking\noccurs, is a non-monotonic function of the fiber twisting rate and it can be\nreduced nearly to zero or, instead, notably increased just by changing this\nrate. Nonlinearity usually leads to the monotonic reduction of the symmetry\nbreaking threshold in such fibers.\n", "  The classical nucleation theory finds the rate of nucleation proportional to\nthe monomer concentration raised to the power, which is the `critical nucleaus\nsize', ${n_c}$. The implicit assumption, that amyloids nucleate in the same\nway, has been recently challenged by an alternative two-step mechanism, when\nthe soluble monomers first form a metastable aggregate (micelle), and then\nundergo conversion into the conformation rich in ${\\beta}$-strands that are\nable to form a stable growing nucleus for the protofilament. Here we put\ntogether the elements of extensive knowledge about aggregation and nucleation\nkinetics, using a specific case of A${\\beta_{1\\mathrm{-}42}}$ amyloidogenic\npeptide for illustration, to find theoretical expressions for the effective\nrate of amyloid nucleation. We find that at low monomer concentration in\nsolution, and also at low interaction energy between two peptide conformations\nin the micelle, the nucleation occurs via the classical route. At higher\nmonomer concentration, and a range of other interaction parameters between\npeptides, the two-step `aggregation-conversion' mechanism of nucleation takes\nover. In this regime, the effective rate of the process can be interpreted as a\npower of monomer concentration in a certain range of parameters, however, the\nexponent is determined by a complicated interplay of interaction parameters and\nis not related to the minimum size of the growing nucleus (which we find to be\n${\\sim}$ 7-8 for A${\\beta_{1-42}}$).\n", "  In the low-energy two-band as well as four-band continuum models, we study\nthe supercritical instability in gapped bilayer graphene in the field of a\ncharged impurity. It is found that the screening effects are crucially\nimportant in bilayer graphene. If they are neglected, then the critical value\nfor the impurity charge as the lowest-energy bound state dives into the lower\ncontinuum tends to zero as the gap $\\Delta$ vanishes. If the screened Coulomb\ninteraction is considered, then the critical charge tends to a finite value for\n$\\Delta \\to 0$. The different scalings of the kinetic energy of quasiparticles\nand the Coulomb interaction with respect to the distance to the charged\nimpurity ensure that the wave function of the electron bound state does not\nshrink toward the impurity as its charge increases. This results in the absence\nof the fall-to-center phenomenon in bilayer graphene although the supercritical\ninstability is realized.\n", "  The probability distribution function of column density (PDF) has become the\ntool of choice for cloud structure analysis and star formation studies. Its\nsimplicity is attractive, and the PDF could offer access to cloud physical\nparameters otherwise difficult to measure, but there has been some confusion in\nthe literature on the definition of its completeness limit and shape at the low\ncolumn density end. In this Letter we use the natural definition of the\ncompleteness limit of a column density PDF, the last closed column-density\ncontour inside a surveyed region, and apply it to a set of large-scale maps of\nnearby molecular clouds. We conclude that there is no observational evidence\nfor log-normal PDFs in these objects. We find that all studied molecular clouds\nhave PDFs well described by power-laws, including the diffuse cloud Polaris.\nOur results call for a new physical interpretation for the shape of the column\ndensity PDFs. We find that the slope of a cloud PDF is invariant to distance\nbut not to the spatial arrangement of cloud material, and as such it is still a\nuseful tool to investigate cloud structure.\n", "  Condensed matter systems that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and\nferromagnetism are rare due the antagonistic relationship between conventional\nspin-singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetic order. In materials in which\nsuperconductivity and magnetic order is known to coexist (such as some\nheavy-fermion materials), the superconductivity is thought to be of an\nunconventional nature. Recently, the conducting gas that lives at the interface\nbetween the perovskite band insulators LaAlO$_3$ (LAO) and SrTiO$_3$ (STO) has\nalso been shown to host both superconductivity and magnetism. Most previous\nresearch has focused on LAO/STO samples in which the interface is in the (001)\ncrystal plane. Relatively little work has focused on the (111) crystal\norientation, which has hexagonal symmetry at the interface, and has been\npredicted to have potentially interesting topological properties, including\nunconventional superconducting pairing states. Here we report measurements of\nthe magnetoresistance of (111) LAO/STO heterostructures at temperatures at\nwhich they are also superconducting. As with the (001) structures, the\nmagnetoresistance is hysteretic, indicating the coexistence of magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, but in addition, we find that this magnetoresistance is\nanisotropic. Such an anisotropic response is completely unexpected in the\nsuperconducting state, and suggests that (111) LAO/STO heterostructures may\nsupport unconventional superconductivity.\n", "  Analytic expressions for the fields of a radially polarized, ultrashort and\ntightly focused laser pulse propagating in a linear-response plasma are derived\nand discussed. The fields are obtained from solving the inhomogenous wave\nequations for the vector and scalar potentials, linked by the Lorenz gauge, in\na plasma background. First the scalar potential is eliminated using the gauge\ncondition, then the vector potential is synthesized from Fourier components of\nan initial uniform distribution of wavenumbers, and the inverse Fourier\ntransformation is carried out term-by-term in a truncated series (finite sum).\nThe zeroth-order term in, for example, the axial electric field component is\nshown to model a pulse much better than its widely used paraxial approximation\ncounterpart. Some of the propagation characteristics of the fields are\ndiscussed and all fields are shown to have manifestly the expected limits for\npropagation in a vacuum.\n", "  A family of semiconductors called as Chern band insulator are shown to host\nexciton bands with non-zero topological Chern integers and chiral exciton edge\nmodes. Using a prototypical two-band Chern insulator model, we calculate a\ncross-correlation function to obtain the exciton bands and their Chern\nintegers. The lowest exciton band acquires Chern integers such as $\\pm 1$ and\n$\\pm 2$ in electronic Chern insulator phase. The non-trivial topology can be\nexperimentally observed both by non-local optoelectronic response of exciton\nedge modes and by a phase shift in the cross-correlation response due to the\nbulk mode. Our result suggests that magnetically doped HgTe, InAs/GaSb quantum\nwells and $\\text{(Bi,Sb)}_{2} \\text{Te}_{3}$ thin film are promising candidates\nfor a platform of topological excitonics.\n", "  XB 1254-690 is a dipping low mass X-ray binary system hosting a neutron star\nand showing type I X-ray bursts. We aim at obtaining more accurate orbital\nephemeris and at constraining the orbital period derivative of the system for\nthe first time. In addition, we want to better constrain the distance to the\nsource in order to locate the system in a well defined evolutive scenario. We\napply for the first time an orbital timing technique to XB 1254-690, using the\narrival times of the dips present in the light curves that have been collected\nduring 26 years of X-ray pointed observations performed from different space\nmissions. We estimate the dip arrival times using a statistical method that\nweights the count-rate inside the dip with respect to the level of the\npersistent emission outside the dip. We fit the obtained delays as a function\nof the orbital cycles both with a linear and a quadratic function. We infer the\norbital ephemeris of XB 1254-690 improving the accuracy of the orbital period\nwith respect to previous estimates. We infer a mass of M$_{2}=0.42\\pm 0.04$\nM$_{\\odot}$ for the donor star, in agreement with the estimations already\npresent in literature, assuming that the star is in thermal equilibrium while\nit transfers part of its mass via the inner Lagrangian point, and assuming a\nneutron star mass of 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$. Using these assumptions, we also\nconstrain the distance to the source, finding a value of 7.6$\\pm 0.8$ kpc.\nFinally, we discuss the evolution of the system suggesting that it is\ncompatible with a conservative mass transfer driven by magnetic braking.\n", "  A search for direct production of top squark pairs in events with jets and\nlarge transverse momentum imbalance is presented. The data are based on\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in\n2016 at the CERN LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\ninverse femtobarns. The search considers a variety of R-parity conserving\nsupersymmetric models, including ones for which the top squark and neutralino\nmasses are nearly degenerate. Specialized jet reconstruction tools are\ndeveloped to exploit the unique characteristics of the signal topologies. With\nno significant excess of events observed above the standard model expectations,\nupper limits are set on the direct top squark pair production cross section in\nthe context of simplified supersymmetric models for various decay hypotheses.\nModels with larger differences in mass between the top squark and neutralino\nare probed for masses up to 1040 and 500 GeV, respectively, whereas models with\na more compressed mass hierarchy are probed up to 660 and 610 GeV,\nrespectively. The smallest mass difference probed is for masses near to 550 and\n540 GeV, respectively.\n", "  Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) in interlayer exchange\ncoupled (IEC) Pt/Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$(1.12\nnm)/Ru/Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$(1.12 nm) systems have been studied\ntheoretically and experimentally. Vibrating sample magnetometer has been used\nto measure their magnetization at saturation and their interlayer exchange\ncoupling constants. These latter are found to be of an antiferromagnetic nature\nfor the investigated Ru range thickness (0.5-1 nm). Their dynamic magnetic\nproperties were studied using Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique. The\nBLS measurements reveal pronounced non-reciprocal spin waves propagation. In\ncontrast to the calculations for symmetrical IEC CoFeB layers, this\nexperimental nonreciprocity is Ru thickness and thus coupling strength\ndependent. Therefore, to explain the experimental behaviour, a theoretical\nmodel based on the perpendicular interface anisotropy difference between the\nbottom and top CoFeB layers has been developed. We show that the Ru thickness\ndependence of the spin wave non-reciprocity is well reproduced by considering a\nconstant iDMI and different perpendicular interfacial anisotropy fields between\nthe top and bottom CoFeB layers. This anisotropy difference has been confirmed\nby the investigation of the CoFeB thickness dependence of effective\nmagnetization of Pt/CoFeB/Ru and Ru/CoFeB/MgO individual layers, where a linear\nbehaviour has been observed.\n", "  A generalized reciprocal theorem is formulated for the motion and\nhydrodynamic force moments of an active particle in an arbitrary background\nflow of a (weakly nonlinear) complex fluid. This formalism includes as special\ncases a number of previous calculations of the motion of both passive and\nactive particles in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.\n", "  One promising application of photonics to astronomical instrumentation is the\nminiaturization of near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers for large ground- and\nspace-based astronomical telescopes. Here we present new results from our\neffort to fabricate arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) spectrometers for\nastronomical applications entirely in-house. Our latest devices have a peak\noverall throughput of ~23%, a spectral resolving power\n(${\\lambda}/{\\delta}{\\lambda}$) of ~1300, and cover the entire H band\n(1450-1650 nm) for Transverse Electric (TE) polarization. These AWGs use a\nsilica-on-silicon platform with a very thin layer of Si3N4 as the core of the\nwaveguides. They have a free spectral range of ~10 nm at a wavelength of ~1600\nnm and a contrast ratio or crosstalk of about 2% (-17 dB). Various practical\naspects of implementing AWGs as astronomical spectrographs are discussed,\nincluding the coupling of the light between the fibers and AWGs,\nhigh-temperature annealing to improve the throughput of the devices at ~1500\nnm, cleaving at the output focal plane of the AWG to provide continuous\nwavelength coverage, and a novel algorithm to make the devices polarization\ninsensitive over a broad band. These milestones will guide the development of\nthe next generation of AWGs with wider free spectral range and higher resolving\npower and throughput.\n", "  Taking into account the effect of electron screening on the electron energy\nand electron capture threshold energy, by using the method of Shell-Model Monte\nCarlo and Random Phase Approximation theory, we investigate the strong electron\nscreening capture rates of chromium isotopes according to the linear response\ntheory screening model. The strong screening rates can decrease by about\n40.43\\% (e.g., for $^{60}$Cr at $T_9=3.44,Y_e=0.43$). Our conclusions may be\nhelpful to the researches of supernova explosion and numerical simulation.\n", "  The Shannon entropy, and related quantities such as mutual information, can\nbe used to quantify uncertainty and relevance. However, in practice, it can be\ndifficult to compute these quantities for arbitrary probability distributions,\nparticularly if the probability mass functions or densities cannot be\nevaluated. This paper introduces a computational approach, based on Nested\nSampling, to evaluate entropies of probability distributions that can only be\nsampled. I demonstrate the method on three examples: a simple gaussian example\nwhere the key quantities are available analytically; (ii) an experimental\ndesign example about scheduling observations in order to measure the period of\nan oscillating signal; and (iii) predicting the future from the past in a\nheavy-tailed scenario.\n", "  Inverted HgTe/CdTe quantum wells have been used as a platform for the\nrealization of 2D topological insulators, bulk insulator materials with\nspin-helical metallic edges states protected by time-reversal symmetry. This\nwork investigates the spectrum and the charge transport in HgTe/CdTe quantum\nwell junctions both in the topological regime and in the absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry. We model the system using the BHZ effective Hamiltonian\nand compute the transport properties using recursive Green's functions with a\nfinite differences' method. Specifically, we have studied the material's\nspatially-resolved conductance in a set-up with a gated central region, forming\nmonopolar (n-n$^{\\prime}$-n) and heteropolar (n-p-n, n-TI-n) double junctions,\nwhich have been recently realized in experiments. We find regimes in which the\nedge states carry spin-polarized currents in the central region even in the\npresence of a small magnetic field, which breaks TRS. More interestingly, the\nconductance displays spin-dependent, Fabry-Per\\'ot-like oscillations as a\nfunction of the central gate voltage producing tunable, fully spin-polarized\ncurrents through the device.\n", "  We study Andreev reflection and Andreev levels $\\varepsilon$ in Zeeman-split\nsuperconductor/Rashba wire/Zeeman-split superconductor junctions by solving the\nBogoliubov de-Gennes equation. We theoretically demonstrate that the Andreev\nlevels $\\varepsilon$ can be controlled by tuning either the strength of Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction or the relative direction of the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction and the Zeeman field. In particular, it is found that the magnitude\nof the band splitting is tunable by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction and the rength of the wire, which can be interpreted by a spin\nprecession in the Rashba wire. We also find that if the Zeeman field in the\nsuperconductor has the component parallel to the direction of the junction, the\n$\\varepsilon$-$\\phi$ curve becomes asymmetric with respect to the\nsuperconducting phase difference $\\phi$. Whereas the Andreev reflection\nprocesses associated with each pseudospin band are sensitive to the relative\norientation of the spin-orbit field and the exchange field, the total electric\nconductance interestingly remains invariant.\n", "  The Einstein-First project approaches the teaching of Einsteinian physics\nthrough the use of physical models and analogies. This paper presents an\napproach to the teaching of quantum physics which begins by emphasising the\nparticle-nature of light through the use of toy projectiles to represent\nphotons. This allows key concepts including the spacing between photons, and\nphoton momentum to be introduced. This in-turn allows an intuitive\nunderstanding of the uncertainty principle. We present optical interference in\nthe context of individual photons, using actual videos showing the development\nof images one at a time This enables simple laser interference experiments to\nbe interpreted through the statistical arrival of photons. The wave aspects of\nquantum phenomenon are interpreted in terms of the wavelike nature of the\narrival probabilities.\n", "  This paper reviews research results obtained from Einsteinian physics\nprograms run by different instructors with Years 6, 9, 10 and 11 students using\nthe models and analogies described in Parts 1 and 2. The research aimed to\ndetermine whether it is possible to teach Einsteinian physics and to measure\nthe changes in students attitudes to physics engendered by introducing the\nmodern concepts that underpin technology today. Results showed that students\neasily coped with the concepts of Einsteinian physics, and considered that they\nwere not too young for the material presented. Importantly, in all groups,\ngirls improved their attitude to physics considerably more than the boys,\ngenerally achieving near parity with the boys.\n", "  A change in the fundamental constants of nature or plasma effects in the\nearly universe could stabilize $^8$Be against decay into two $^4$He nuclei. Coc\net al. examined this effect on big bang nucleosynthesis as a function of $B_8$,\nthe mass difference between two $^4$He nuclei and a single $^8$Be nucleus, and\nfound no effects for $B_8 \\le 100$ keV. Here we examine stable $^8$Be with\nlarger $B_8$ and also allow for a variation in the rate for $^4$He + $^4$He\n$\\longrightarrow$ $^8$Be to determine the threshold for interesting effects. We\nfind no change to standard big bang nucleosynthesis for $B_8 < 1$ MeV. For $B_8\n\\gtrsim 1$ MeV and a sufficiently large reaction rate, a significant fraction\nof $^4$He is burned into $^8$Be, which fissions back into $^4$He when $B_8$\nassumes its present-day value, leaving the primordial $^4$He abundance\nunchanged. However, this sequestration of $^4$He results in a decrease in the\nprimordial $^7$Li abundance. Primordial abundances of $^7$Li consistent with\nobservationally-inferred values can be obtained for reaction rates similar to\nthose calculated for the present-day (unbound $^8$Be) case. Even for the\nlargest binding energies and largest reaction rates examined here, only a small\nfraction of $^8$Be is burned into heavier elements, consistent with earlier\nstudies. There is no change in the predicted deuterium abundance for any model\nwe examined.\n", "  A computational method is presented which is capable to obtain low lying\nenergy structures of topological amorphous systems. The method merges a\ndifferential mutation genetic algorithm with simulated annealing. This is done\nby incorporating a thermal selection criterion, which makes it possible to\nreliably obtain low lying minima with just a small population size and is\nsuitable for multimodal structural optimization. The method is tested on the\nstructural optimization of amorphous graphene from unbiased atomic starting\nconfigurations. With just a population size of six systems, energetically very\nlow structures are obtained. While each of the structures represents a\ndistinctly different arrangement of the atoms, their properties, such as\nenergy, distribution of rings, radial distribution function, coordination\nnumber and distribution of bond angles, are very similar.\n", "  {We report on the first of a series of studies on coronal bright points\ninvestigating the physical mechanism that generates these phenomena.} {The aim\nof this paper is to understand the magnetic-field structure that hosts the\nbright points.} {We use longitudinal magnetograms taken by the Solar Optical\nTelescope with the Narrowband Filter Imager. For a single case, magnetograms\nfrom the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager were added to the analysis. The\nlongitudinal magnetic field component is used to derive the potential magnetic\nfields of the large regions around the bright points. A magneto-static field\nextrapolation method is tested to verify the accuracy of the potential field\nmodelling. The three dimensional magnetic fields are investigated for the\npresence of magnetic null points and their influence on the local magnetic\ndomain.} {In 9 out of 10 cases the bright point resides in areas where the\ncoronal magnetic field contains an opposite polarity intrusion defining a\nmagnetic null point above it. It is found that X-ray bright points reside, in\nthese 9 cases, in a limited part of the projected fan dome area, either fully\ninside the dome or expanding over a limited area below which typically a\ndominant flux concentration resides. The 10th bright point is located in a\nbipolar loop system without an overlying null point.} {All bright points in\ncoronal holes and two out of tree bright points in quiet Sun regions are seen\nto reside in regions containing a magnetic null point. An yet unidentified\nprocess(es) generates the BPs in specific regions of the fan-dome structure. }\n", "  We measure the distance to the supernova remnant G15.4+0.1 which is likely\nassociated with TeV source HESS J1818-154. We build the neutral hydrogen (HI)\nabsorption and 13CO spectra to supernova remnant G15.4+0.1 by employing the\ndata from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) and the HI/OH/Recombination\nline survey (THOR). The maximum absorption velocity of about 140 km/s\nconstrains its lower limit distance of about 8.0 kpc. Further, the fact that\nthe HI emission feature at about 95 km/s seems no corresponding absorption\nsuggests that G15.4+0.1 has likely an upper limit distance of about 10.5 kpc.\n13CO spectrum to the remnant supports our measurement. The new distance revises\nparameters on its associated pulsar wind nebula and TeV source.\n", "  We compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy of a magnetically charged\nextremal black hole in AdS4 x S7 using the quantum entropy function and discuss\nthe possibility of matching against recently derived microscopic expressions.\n", "  We report a capacitance tracking method for achieving arbitrary polarization\nrotation from nematic liquid crystals. By locking to the unique capacitance\nassociated with the molecular orientation, any polarization rotation can be\nachieved with improved accuracy over a wide temperature range. A modified\nrelaxation oscillator circuit that can simultaneously determine the capacitance\nand drive the rotator is presented.\n", "  We develop a theory of the quasiparticle interference (QPI) in multiband\nsuperconductors based on strong-coupling Eliashberg approach within the Born\napproximation. In the framework of this theory, we study dependencies of the\nQPI response function in the multiband superconductors with nodeless s-wave\nsuperconductive order parameter. We pay a special attention to the difference\nof the quasiparticle scattering between the bands having the same and opposite\nsigns of the order parameter. We show that, at the momentum values close to the\nmomentum transfer between two bands, the energy dependence of the quasiparticle\ninterference response function has three singularities. Two of these correspond\nto the values of the gap functions and the third one depends on both the gaps\nand the transfer momentum. We argue that only the singularity near the smallest\nband gap may be used as an universal tool to distinguish between $s_{++}$ and\n$s_{\\pm}$ order parameters. The robustness of the sign of the response function\npeak near the smaller gap value, irrespective of the change in parameters, in\nboth the symmetry cases is a promising feature that can be harnessed\nexperimentally.\n", "  Starting with the most general four-dimensional spacetime possessing two\ncommuting Killing vectors and a nontrivial Killing tensor, we analytically\nintegrate Einstein-Yang-Mills equations for a completely arbitrary gauge group.\nIt is assumed that the gauge field inherits the symmetries of the background\nand is aligned with the principal null directions of the spacetime.\n", "  A heat-assisted multiferroic solid-state memory design is proposed and\nanalysed, based on a PbNbZrSnTiO3 antiferroelectric substrate and Ni81Fe19\nmagnetic free layer. Information is stored as magnetisation direction in the\nfree layer of a magnetic tunnel junction element. The bit writing process is\ncontactless and relies on triggering thermally activated magnetisation\nswitching of the free layer towards a strain-induced anisotropy easy axis. A\nstress is generated using the antiferroelectric substrate by voltage-induced\nantiferroelectric to ferroelectric phase change, and this is transmitted to the\nmagnetic free layer by strain-mediated coupling. The thermally activated\nstrain-induced magnetisation switching is analysed here using a\nthree-dimensional, temperature-dependent magnetisation dynamics model, based on\nsimultaneous evaluation of the stochastic Landau Lifshitz Bloch equation and\nheat flow equation, together with stochastic thermal fields and magnetoelastic\ncontributions. The magnetisation switching probability is calculated as a\nfunction of stress magnitude and maximum heat pulse temperature. An operating\nregion is identified, where magnetisation switching always occurs, with stress\nvalues ranging from 80 to 180 MPa, and maximum temperatures normalised to the\nCurie temperature ranging from 0.65 to 0.99.\n", "  This is a brief history of what I consider as very important, some of which\ntruly seminal, contributions made by young Korean nuclear theorists, mostly\ngraduate students working on PhD thesis in 1990's and early 2000's, to nuclear\neffective field theory, nowadays heralded as the first-principle approach to\nnuclear physics. The theoretical framework employed is an effective field\ntheory anchored on a scale-invariant hidden local symmetric Lagrangian\nconstructed along the line of Weinberg's \"Folk Theorem\" on effective field\ntheory. The problems addressed are the high-precision calculations on the\nthermal $np$ capture, the solar $pp$ fusion process, the solar $hep$ process --\nJohn Bahcall's challenge to nuclear theorists -- and the quenching of $g_A$ in\ngiant Gamow-Teller resonances and the whopping enhancement of first-forbidden\nbeta transitions in astrophysical processes. Extending adventurously the\nstrategy to a wild uncharted domain in which a systematic implementation of the\n\"theorem\" is far from obvious, the same effective Lagrangian is applied to the\nstructure of compact stars. A surprising result on the properties of massive\nstars, totally different from what has been obtained up to day in the\nliterature, is predicted, such as the precocious onset of conformal sound\nvelocity together with the possible emergence of hidden symmetries such as\nscale symmetry and hidden local symmetry.\n", "  Stellar mass has been shown to correlate with halo mass, with non-negligible\nscatter. The stellar mass-size and luminosity-size relationships of galaxies\nalso show significant scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. It is\npossible that, at fixed stellar mass and galaxy colour, the halo mass is\ncorrelated with galaxy size. Galaxy-galaxy lensing allows us to measure the\nmean masses of dark matter haloes for stacked samples of galaxies. We extend\nthe analysis of the galaxies in the CFHTLenS catalogue by fitting single\nS\\'{e}rsic surface brightness profiles to the lens galaxies in order to recover\nhalf-light radius values, allowing us to determine halo masses for lenses\naccording to their size. Comparing our halo masses and sizes to baselines for\nthat stellar mass yields a differential measurement of the halo mass-galaxy\nsize relationship at fixed stellar mass, defined as $M_{h}(M_{*}) \\propto\nr_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\eta}(M_{*})$. We find that on average, our lens galaxies\nhave an $\\eta = 0.42\\pm0.12$, i.e. larger galaxies live in more massive dark\nmatter haloes. The $\\eta$ is strongest for high mass luminous red galaxies\n(LRGs). Investigation of this relationship in hydrodynamical simulations\nsuggests that, at a fixed $M_{*}$, satellite galaxies have a larger $\\eta$ and\ngreater scatter in the $M_{\\mathrm{h}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ relationship\ncompared to central galaxies.\n", "  We disclose a novel phase transition in black hole physics by investigating\nthermodynamics of charged dilaton black holes in an extended phase space where\nthe charge of the black hole is regarded as a fixed quantity. Along with the\nusual critical (second-order) as well as the first-order phase transitions in\ncharged black holes, we find that a finite jump in Gibbs free energy is\ngenerated by dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant, $\\alpha$, for a certain\nrange of pressure. This novel behavior indicates a small/large black hole\n\\emph{zeroth-order} phase transition in which the response functions of black\nholes thermodynamics diverge e.g. isothermal compressibility. Such zeroth-order\ntransition separates the usual critical point and the standard first-order\ntransition curve. We show that increasing the dilaton parameter($\\alpha$)\nincreases the zeroth-order portion of the transition curve. Additionally, we\nfind that the second-order (critical) phase transition exponents are unaffected\nby the dilaton parameter, however, the condition of positive critical\ntemperature puts an upper bound on the dilaton parameter ($\\alpha<1$).\n", "  We present monitoring campaign observations at optical and near-infrared\n(NIR) wavelengths for a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z=0.840,\nSDSS~J110006.07+442144.3 (hereafter, J1100+4421), which was identified during a\nflare phase in late February, 2014. The campaigns consist of three intensive\nobserving runs from the discovery to March, 2015, mostly within the scheme of\nthe OISTER collaboration. Optical-NIR light curves and simultaneous spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) are obtained. Our measurements show the strongest\nbrightening in March, 2015. We found that the optical-NIR SEDs of J1100+4421\nshow an almost steady shape despite the large and rapid intranight variability.\nThis constant SED shape is confirmed to extend to $\\sim5~\\mu$m in the observed\nframe using the archival WISE data. Given the lack of absorption lines and the\nsteep power-law spectrum of $\\alpha_{\\nu}\\sim-1.4$, where\n$f_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha_{\\nu}}$, synchrotron radiation by a relativistic jet\nwith no or small contributions from the host galaxy and the accretion disk\nseems most plausible as an optical-NIR emission mechanism. The steep\noptical-NIR spectral shape and the large amplitude of variability are\nconsistent with this object being a low $\\nu_{\\rm{peak}}$ jet-dominated AGN. In\naddition, sub-arcsec resolution optical imaging data taken with Subaru Hyper\nSuprime-Cam does not show a clear extended component and the spatial scales are\nsignificantly smaller than the large extensions detected at radio wavelengths.\nThe optical spectrum of a possible faint companion galaxy does not show any\nemission lines at the same redshift and hence a merging hypothesis for this\nAGN-related activity is not supported by our observations.\n", "  We examine the magnetic correlations in quantum spin models that were derived\nrecently as effective low-energy theories for electronic correlation effects on\nthe edge states of graphene nanoribbons. For this purpose, we employ quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations to access the large-distance properties, accounting for\nquantum fluctuations beyond mean-field-theory approaches to edge magnetism. For\ncertain chiral nanoribbons, antiferromagnetic inter-edge couplings were\npreviously found to induce a gapped quantum disordered ground state of the\neffective spin model. We find that the extended nature of the intra-edge\ncouplings in the effective spin model for zigzag nanoribbons leads to a quantum\nphase transition at a large, finite value of the inter-edge coupling. This\nquantum critical point separates the quantum disordered region from a gapless\nphase of stable edge magnetism at weak intra-edge coupling, which includes the\nground states of spin-ladder models for wide zigzag nanoribbons. To study the\nquantum critical behavior, the effective spin model can be related to a model\nof two antiferromagnetically coupled Haldane-Shastry spin-half chains with\nlong-ranged ferromagnetic intra-chain couplings. The results for the critical\nexponents are compared also to several recent renormalization group\ncalculations for related long-ranged interacting quantum systems.\n", "  We discuss the optimal matching solution for both the assignment problem and\nthe matching problem in one dimension for a large class of convex cost\nfunctions. We consider the problem in a compact set with the topology both of\nthe interval and of the circumference. Afterwards, we assume the points'\npositions to be random variables identically and independently distributed on\nthe considered domain. We analytically obtain the average optimal cost in the\nasymptotic regime of very large number of points $N$ and some correlation\nfunctions for a power-law type cost function in the form $c(z)=z^p$, both in\nthe $p>1$ case and in the $p<0$ case. The scaling of the optimal mean cost with\nthe number of points is $N^{-\\frac{p}{2}}$ for the assignment and $N^{-p}$ for\nthe matching when $p>1$, whereas in both cases it is a constant when $p<0$.\nFinally, our predictions are compared with the results of numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  The venerable NOD2 data reduction software package for single-dish radio\ncontinuum observations, developed for use at the 100-m Effelsberg radio\ntelescope, has been successfully applied over many decades. Modern computing\nfacilities call for a new design.\n  We aim to develop an interactive software tool with a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) for the reduction of single-dish radio continuum maps. Special\neffort is given on the reduction of distortions along the scanning direction\n(scanning effects) by combining maps scanned in orthogonal directions or dual-\nor multiple-horn observations that need to be processed in a restoration\nprocedure. The package should also process polarisation data and offer the\npossibility to include special tasks written by the individual user.\n  Based on the ideas of the NOD2 package we developed NOD3, which includes all\nnecessary tasks from the raw maps to the final maps in total intensity and\nlinear polarisation. Furthermore, plot routines and several methods for map\nanalysis are available. The NOD3 package is written in Python which allows to\nextend the package by additional tasks. The required data format for the input\nmaps is FITS.\n  NOD3 is a sophisticated tool to process and analyse maps from single-dish\nobservations that are affected by 'scanning effects' due to clouds, receiver\ninstabilities, or radio-frequency interference (RFI). The 'basket-weaving' tool\ncombines orthogonally scanned maps to a final map that is almost free of\nscanning effects. The new restoration tool for dual-beam observations reduces\nthe noise by a factor of about two compared to the NOD2 version. Combining\nsingle-dish with interferometer data in the map plane ensures the full recovery\nof the total flux density.\n", "  The bi-circular scheme for high harmonic generation, which combines two\ncounter-rotating circular fields with frequency ratio 2:1, has recently\npermitted to generate high harmonics with essentially circular polarization,\nopening the way for ultrafast chiral studies. This scheme produces harmonic\nlines at 3N + 1 and 3N + 2 multiples of the fundamental driving frequency,\nwhile the 3N lines are forbidden owing to the three-fold symmetry of the field.\nIt is generally established that the routinely observed signals at these\nforbidden harmonic lines come from a slight ellipticity in the driving fields,\nwhich breaks the three-fold symmetry. We find that this is neither the only nor\nit is the dominant mechanism responsible. The forbidden lines can be observed\neven for perfectly circular, long driving pulses. We show that they encode rich\ninformation on the sub-cycle electronic dynamics that occur during the\ngeneration process. By varying the time delay and relative intensity between\nthe two drivers, we demonstrate that when the second harmonic either precedes\nor is more intense than the fundamental field, the dynamical symmetry of the\nsystem is broken by electrons trapped in Rydberg orbits (i.e., Freeman\nresonances), and that the forbidden harmonic lines are a witness of this.\n", "  We monitored the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1750.8-2900 after\nthe end of its 2015/2016 outburst using the X-ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Swift\nto detect possible post-outburst 'rebrightenings', similar to those seen after\nits 2008 outburst. We did not detect any rebrightening behaviour, suggesting\nthat the physical mechanism behind the rebrightening events is not always\nactive after each outburst of the source. Any model attempting to explain these\nrebrightenings should thus be able to reproduce the different outburst profiles\nof the source at different times. Surprisingly, our Swift/XRT observations were\nunable to detect the source, contrary to previous Swift/XRT observations in\nquiescence. We determined a temperature upper limit of $\\leq$ 106 eV, much\ncolder than the post 2008 outburst value of $\\sim$ 145 eV. We also report on an\narchival Chandra observation of the source after its 2011 outburst and found a\ntemperature of $\\sim$ 126 eV. These different temperatures, including the\nnon-detection very close after the end of the 2015/2016 outburst, are difficult\nto explain in any model assuming we observe the cooling emission from a neutron\nstar core or an accretion-heated crust. We discuss our observations in the\ncontext of a change in envelope (the outer $\\sim$ 100 m of the crust)\ncomposition and (possibly in combination with) a cooling crust. Both hypotheses\ncannot explain our results unless potentially unrealistic assumptions are made.\nIrrespective of what causes the temperature variability, it is clear that the\nneutron star in SAX J1750.8-2900 may not be as hot as previously assumed.\n", "  We use multifractal finite-size scaling to perform a high-precision numerical\nstudy of the critical properties of the Anderson localization-delocalization\ntransition in the unitary symmetry class, considering the Anderson model\nincluding a random magnetic flux. We demonstrate the scale invariance of the\ndistribution of wavefunction intensities at the critical point and study its\nbehavior across the transition. Our analysis, involving more than $4\\times10^6$\nindependently generated wavefunctions of system sizes up to $L^3=150^3$, yields\naccurate estimates for the critical exponent of the localization length,\n$\\nu=1.446 (1.440,1.452)$, the critical value of the disorder strength and the\nmultifractal exponents.\n", "  In network science, the interplay between dynamical processes and the\nunderlying topologies of complex systems has led to a diverse family of models\nwith different interpretations. In graph signal processing, this is manifested\nin the form of different graph shifts and their induced algebraic systems. In\nthis paper, we propose the unifying Z-Laplacian framework, whose instances can\nact as graph shift operators. As a generalization of the traditional graph\nLaplacian, the Z-Laplacian spans the space of all possible Z-matrices, i.e.,\nreal square matrices with nonpositive off-diagonal entries. We show that the\nZ-Laplacian can model general continuous-time dynamical processes, including\ninformation flows and epidemic spreading on a given graph. It is also closely\nrelated to general nonnegative graph filters in the discrete time domain. We\nshowcase its flexibility by considering two applications. First, we consider a\nwireless communications networking problem modeled with a graph, where the\nframework can be applied to model the effects of the underlying communications\nprotocol and traffic. Second, we examine a structural brain network from the\nperspective of low- to high-frequency connectivity.\n", "  In this proceeding we shall explore the potential of a future $e^- \\,p$\ncollider to probe the CP-even scalars in a two Higgs doublet model. We consider\nType-I in this study. The mass of the lighter scalar particle is considered to\nbe the Higgs-boson, $m_h = 125$ GeV, and a heavy scalar $m_H = 270$ GeV. The\ncentre of mass energy for the $e^-\\,p$ collision is considered as in the Large\nHadron Electron Collider and the Future Circular Hadron Electron Collider\nconfigurations, by fixing the proton beam energy to be $E_p = 7$ and 50 TeV,\nrespectively, and an electron beam energy of $E_e = 60$ GeV. Production cross\nsections of these scalars are also shown at higher electron beam energies.\nFuture prospects of these studies are also discussed.\n", "  Very high-energy gamma-rays (VHE, E>100 GeV) propagating over cosmological\ndistances can interact with the low-energy photons of the extragalactic\nbackground light (EBL) and produce electron-positron pairs. The transparency of\nthe universe to VHE gamma-rays is then directly related to the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the EBL. The observation of features in the VHE energy\nspectra of extragalactic sources allows the EBL to be measured, which otherwise\nis very difficult to determine. An EBL-model independent measurement of the EBL\nSED with the H.E.S.S. array of Cherenkov telescopes is presented. It is\nobtained by extracting the EBL absorption signal from the reanalysis of\nhigh-quality spectra of blazars. From H.E.S.S. data alone the EBL signature is\ndetected at a significance of 9.5 sigma, and the intensity of the EBL obtained\nin different spectral bands is presented together with the associated gamma-ray\nhorizon.\n", "  We report a nontrivial transition in the core structure of vortices in\ntwo-band superconductors as a function of interband impurity scattering. We\ndemonstrate that, in addition to singular zeros of the order parameter, the\nvortices there can acquire a circular nodal line around the singular point in\none of the superconducting components. It results in the formation of the\npeculiar \"moat\"-like profile in one of the superconducting gaps. The moat-core\nvortices occur generically in the vicinity of the impurity-induced crossover\nbetween $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.\n", "  A low cost scheme to determine the frequency sweep nonlinearity using atomic\nsaturated absorption spectroscopy is demonstrated. The frequency modulation\nrate is determined by directly measuring the interference fringe number and\nfrequency gap between two atomic transition peaks of rubidium atom.\nExperimental results show that the frequency sweep nonlinearity is ~7.68%, with\nthe average frequency modulation rate of ~28.95 GHz/s, which is in good\nagreement with theoretical expectation. With this method, the absolute optical\nfrequency and optical path difference between two laser beams are\nsimultaneously measured. This novel technique can be used for applications such\nas optical frequency sweep nonlinearity correction and real-time frequency\nmonitor.\n", "  Regarding the strong magnetic field of neutron stars and high energy regime\nscenario which is based on high curvature region near the compact objects, one\nis motivated to study magnetic neutron stars in an energy dependent spacetime.\nIn this paper, we show that such strong magnetic field and energy dependency of\nspacetime have considerable effects on the properties of neutron stars. We\nexamine the variations of maximum mass and related radius, Schwarzschild\nradius, average density, gravitational redshift, Kretschmann scalar and\nBuchdahl theorem due to magnetic field and also energy dependency of metric.\nFirst, it will be shown that the maximum mass and radius of neutron stars are\nincreasing function of magnetic field while average density, redshift, the\nstrength of gravity and Kretschmann scalar are decreasing functions of it.\nThese results are due to a repulsive-like force behavior for the magnetic\nfield. Next, the effects of the gravity's rainbow will be studied and it will\nbe shown that by increasing the rainbow function, the neutron stars could enjoy\nan expansion in their structures. Then, we obtain a new relation for the upper\nmass limit of a static spherical neutron star with uniform density in gravity's\nrainbow (Buchdahl limit) in which such upper limit is modified as\n$M_{eff}<\\frac{4c^{2}R}{9G}$. In addition, stability and energy conditions for\nthe equation of state of neutron star matter are also investigated and a\ncomparison with empirical results is done. It is notable that the numerical\nstudy in this paper is conducted by using the lowest order constrained\nvariational (LOCV) approach in the presence of magnetic field employing AV18\npotential.\n", "  We construct new solutions of the Faddeev-Skyrme model with a symmetry\nbreaking potential admitting $S^1$ vacuum. It includes, as a limiting case, the\nusual $SO(3)$ symmetry breaking mass term, another limit corresponds to the\npotential $m^2 \\phi_1^2$, which gives a mass to the corresponding component of\nthe scalar field. However we find that the spacial distribution of the energy\ndensity of these solutions has more complicated structure, than in the case of\nthe usual Hopfions, typically it represents two separate linked tubes with\ndifferent thicknesses and positions. In order to classify these configurations\nwe define a counterpart of the usual position curve, which represents a\ncollection of loops $\\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_{-1}$ corresponding to the\npreimages of the points $\\vec \\phi = (\\pm 1 \\mp \\mu, 0,0)$, respectively. Then\nthe Hopf invariant can be defined as $Q= {\\rm link}\n(\\mathcal{C}_1,\\mathcal{C}_{-1})$. In this model, in the sectors of degrees\n$Q=5,6,7$ we found solutions of new type, for which one or both of these tubes\nrepresent trefoil knots. Further, some of these solutions possess different\ntypes of curves $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{-1}$.\n", "  Resistive switching is one of the foremost candidates for building novel\ntypes of non-volatile random access memories. Any practical implementation of\nsuch a memory cell calls for a strong miniaturization, at which point\nfluctuations start playing a role that cannot be neglected. A detailed\nunderstanding of switching mechanisms and reliability is essential. For this\nreason, we formulate a particle model based on the stochastic motion of oxygen\nvacancies. It allows us to investigate fluctuations in the resistance states of\na switch with two active zones. The vacancies' dynamics is governed by a master\nequation. Upon the application of a voltage pulse, the vacancies travel\ncollectively through the switch. By deriving a generalized Burgers equation we\ncan interpret this collective motion as nonlinear traveling waves, and\nnumerically verify this result. Further, we define binary logical states by\nmeans of the underlying vacancy distributions, and establish a framework of\nwriting and reading such memory element with voltage pulses. Considerations\nabout the dis- criminability of these operations under fluctuations together\nwith the markedness of the resistive switching effect itself lead to the\nconclusion, that an intermediate vacancy number is optimal for performance.\n", "  Remanent magnetization in geological samples may record the past intensity\nand direction of planetary magnetic fields. Traditionally, this magnetization\nis analyzed through measurements of the net magnetic moment of bulk millimeter\nto centimeter sized samples. However, geological samples are often\nmineralogically and texturally heterogeneous at submillimeter scales, with only\na fraction of the ferromagnetic grains carrying the remanent magnetization of\ninterest. Therefore, characterizing this magnetization in such cases requires a\ntechnique capable of imaging magnetic fields at fine spatial scales and with\nhigh sensitivity. To address this challenge, we developed a new instrument,\nbased on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which enables direct imaging of\nmagnetic fields due to both remanent and induced magnetization, as well as\noptical imaging, of room-temperature geological samples with spatial resolution\napproaching the optical diffraction limit. We describe the operating principles\nof this device, which we call the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), and report\nits optimized image-area-normalized magnetic field sensitivity (20\nuT.um/Hz^1/2), spatial resolution (5 um), and field of view (4 mm), as well as\ntrade-offs between these parameters. We also perform an absolute magnetic field\ncalibration for the device in different modes of operation, including\nthree-axis (vector) and single-axis (projective) magnetic field imaging.\nFinally, we use the QDM to obtain magnetic images of several terrestrial and\nmeteoritic rock samples, demonstrating its ability to resolve spatially\ndistinct populations of ferromagnetic carriers.\n", "  Observational solar physics is entering a new era with the advent of new 1.5\nm class telescopes with adaptive optics, as well as the Daniel K. Inouye 4 m\ntelescope which will become operational in 2019. Major outstanding problems in\nsolar physics all relate to the solar magnetic field. Spectropolarimetry offers\nthe best, and sometimes only, method for accurate measurements of the magnetic\nfield. In this paper we highlight how certain atomic transitions can help us\nprovide both calibration data, as well as diagnostic information on solar\nmagnetic fields, in the presence of residual image distortions through the\natmosphere close to, but not at the diffraction limits of large and polarizing\ntelescopes. Particularly useful are spectral lines of neutrals and singly\ncharged ions of iron and other complex atoms. As a proof-of-concept, we explore\natomic transitions that might be used to study magnetic fields without the need\nfor an explicit calibration sequence, offering practical solutions to the\ndifficult challenges of calibrating the next generation of solar\nspectropolarimetric telescopes. Suggestions for additional work on atomic\ntheory and measurements, particularly at infrared wavelengths, are given. There\nis some promise for continued symbiotic advances between solar physics and\natomic physics.\n", "  In this paper, based on simple analytic techniques, we explore the\nintegrability conditions for classical stringy configurations defined over $\n\\eta $ as well as $ \\lambda $- deformed backgrounds. We perform our analysis\nconsidering classical string motions within various subsectors of the full\ntarget space geometry. It turns out that classical string configurations\ndefined over $ \\eta $- deformed backgrounds are non-integrable whereas on the\nother hand, the corresponding configurations are integrable over the $ \\lambda\n$- deformed background. Our analysis therefore imposes a strong constraint on\nthe operator spectrum associated with the corresponding dual gauge theories at\nstrong coupling.\n", "  Precise molecular transition frequencies are of great interest in the test of\nfundamental physics and also in various applications. Two well isolated\nro-vibrational transitions of $^{12}$C$^{16}$O at 1.57 $\\mu$m, R(9) and R(10)\nin the second overtone band molecule, were measured by a comb-locked cavity\nring-down spectrometer. Despite the weakness of the lines (Einstein coefficient\n$A\\simeq 0.008$ s$^{-1}$), Lamb-dip spectra were recorded with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio over 1000, and the line positions were determined to be\n191 360 212 763.7 and 191 440 612 664.8 kHz respectively, with an uncertainty\nof 0.5 kHz ($\\delta\\nu/\\nu=2.6\\times 10^{-12}$). The present work demonstrated\nthe possibility to explore extensive molecular lines in the near-infrared with\nsub-kHz accuracy.\n", "  Using a remarkable mapping from the original (3+1)dimensional Skyrme model to\nthe Sine-Gordon model, we construct the first analytic examples of Skyrmions as\nwell as of Skyrmions--anti-Skyrmions bound states within a finite box in 3+1\ndimensional flat space-time. An analytic upper bound on the number of these\nSkyrmions--anti-Skyrmions bound states is derived. We compute the critical\nisospin chemical potential beyond which these Skyrmions cease to exist. With\nthese tools, we also construct topologically protected time-crystals:\ntime-periodic configurations whose time-dependence is protected by their\nnon-trivial winding number. These are striking realizations of the ideas of\nShapere and Wilczek. The critical isospin chemical potential for these\ntime-crystals is determined.\n", "  In this paper, we consider an infinite derivative scalar field action with\ninfinite derivative kinetic and interaction terms. We establish that the theory\nis unitary if the correlation functions are formulated in Euclidean space and\nthen analytically continued in their external momenta to Minkowski space.\n", "  The detection of change points is a pivotal task in statistical analysis. In\nthe quantum realm, it is a new primitive where one aims at identifying the\npoint where a source that supposedly prepares a sequence of particles in\nidentical quantum states starts preparing a mutated one. We obtain the optimal\nprocedure to identify the change point with certainty---naturally at the price\nof having a certain probability of getting an inconclusive answer. We obtain\nthe analytical form of the optimal probability of successful identification for\nany length of the particle sequence. We show that the conditional success\nprobabilities of identifying each possible change point show an unexpected\noscillatory behaviour. We also discuss local (online) protocols and compare\nthem with the optimal procedure.\n", "  We investigate the detectability as well as reconstructibility of a light\npseudoscalar particle $A$, of mass in the 50 - 60 GeV range, which is still\nallowed in a Type-X (lepton-specific) two-Higgs doublet scenario. Such a\npseudoscalar can be pair-produced in the decay $h\\to AA$ of the 125 GeV scalar\n$h$. The light pseudoscalar in the aforementioned range, helpful in explaining\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment, has not only substantial branching ratio in\nthe $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel but also one of about $0.35\\%$ in the $\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nfinal state. We show how to faithfully reconstruct the $A$ mass using the\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ mode, and establish the existence of a pseudoscalar around 50 - 60\nGeV, using the process $pp\\to h \\to AA\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-\\,\\tau^+\\tau^-$. This is\nthe most reliable way of reconstructing the light $A$ mass, and is possible for\nan integrated luminosity of about $100~\\rm{fb}^{-1}$ or less at 14 TeV, with a\nstatistical significance that amounts to discovery.\n", "  Charge transfer plays a crucial role in many processes of interest in\nphysics, chemistry, and bio-chemistry. In many applications the size of the\nsystems involved calls for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to\nbe used in their computational modeling, due to its unprecedented balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. However, although exact in principle, in\npractise approximations must be made for the exchange-correlation functional in\nthis theory, and the standard functional approximations perform poorly for\nexcitations which have a long-range charge-transfer component. Intense progress\nhas been made in developing more sophisticated functionals for this problem,\nwhich we review. We point out an essential difference between the properties of\nthe exchange-correlation kernel needed for an accurate description of\ncharge-transfer between open-shell fragments and between closed-shell\nfragments. We then turn to charge-transfer dynamics, which, in contrast to the\nexcitation problem, is a highly non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, process\ninvolving a transfer of one full electron in space. This turns out to be a much\nmore challenging problem for TDDFT functionals. We describe dynamical step and\npeak features in the exact functional evolving over time, that are missing in\nthe functionals currently used. The latter underestimate the amount of charge\ntransferred and manifest a spurious shift in the charge transfer resonance\nposition. We discuss some explicit examples.\n", "  Photoacoustic signal enhancements were observed with a pair of time-delayed\nfemtosecond pulses upon excitation of gold nanosphere colloidal suspension. A\nsystematic experimental investigation of photoacoustic intensity within the\ndelay time, t = 0 to 15 ns, was carried out. The results revealed a significant\nenhancement factor of ~2 when the pre-pulse energy is 20-30% of the total\nenergy. Pre-pulse and main pulse energy ratios, E(1)p-pol. :E(2)s-pol. were\nvaried to determine the optimal ratio that yields to maximum photoacoustic\nsignal enhancement. This enhancement was ascribed to the initial stage of\nthermalization and bubble generation in the nanosecond time scale. Pre-pulse\nscattering intensity measurements and numerical finite-difference time-domain\ncalculations were performed to reveal dynamics and light field enchancement,\nrespectively.\n", "  Using cosmic voids to probe the growth rate of cosmic structure, and hence\nthe nature of dark energy, is particularly interesting in the context of\nmodified gravity theories that rely on the screening mechanism. In this work we\nimprove the modelling of redshift-space distortions around voids in the dark\nmatter density field, and thus reduce systematic errors in the derivation of\ncosmological parameters. We also show how specific types of voids can be used\nto better probe the growth rate, using a flexible void finder. We apply our\nresults to test for a quintessence type of dark energy vs. a LCDM model, and\nfind a good agreement with the fiducial cosmology after implementing an\nanalytical correction to the radial velocity profiles around voids. We\nadditionally outline characteristic imprints of dark energy in the dark matter\nvelocity distributions around voids.\n", "  We present a detail theoretical study of the Drude weight and optical\nconductivity of 8-$Pmmn$ borophene having tilted anisotropic Dirac cones. We\nprovide exact analytical expressions of $xx$ and $yy$ components of the Drude\nweight as well as maximum optical conductivity. We also obtain exact analytical\nexpressions of the minimum energy ($\\epsilon_1$) required to trigger the\noptical transitions and energy ($\\epsilon_2$) needed to attain maximum optical\nconductivity. We find that the Drude weight and optical conductivity are highly\nanisotropic as a consequence of the anisotropic Dirac cone. The optical\nconductivities have a nonmonotonic behavior with photon energy in the regime\nbetween $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$, as a result of the tilted parameter\n$v_t$. The tilted parameter can be extracted by knowing $\\epsilon_1$ and\n$\\epsilon_2$ from optical measurements. The maximum values of the components of\nthe optical conductivity do not depend on the carrier density and the tilted\nparameter. The product of the maximum values of the anisotropic conductivities\nhas the universal value $(e^2/4\\hbar)^2$. The tilted anisotropic Dirac cones in\n8-$Pmmn$ borophene can be realized by the optical conductivity measurement.\n", "  We investigate the emergence and consequences of odd-frequency spin-triplet\ns-wave pairing in superconducting hybrid junctions at the edge of a\ntwo-dimensional topological insulator without any magnetism. More specifically,\nwe consider several different normal-superconductor hybrid systems at the\ntopological insulator edge, where spin-singlet s-wave superconducting pairing\nis proximity-induced from an external conventional superconductor. We perform\nfully analytical calculations and show that odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet\ns-wave pairing arises due to the unique spin-momentum locking in the\ntopological insulator edge state and the naturally non-constant pairing\npotential profile in hybrid systems. Importantly, we establish a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the local density of states (LDOS) at low energies and\nthe odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing in NS, NSN and SNS junctions along the\ntopological insulator edge; at interfaces the enhancement in the LDOS can\ndirectly be attributed to the contribution of odd-frequency pairing.\nFurthermore, in SNS junctions we show that the emergence of the zero-energy\nLDOS peak at the superconducting phase $\\phi=\\pi$ is associated purely with\nodd-frequency pairing in the middle of the junction.\n", "  Predominantly, harmonic oscillator single-particle wave functions are the\nchoice as a basis in ab-initio nuclear many-body calculations. These\nwave-functions, although very convenient in order to evaluate the matrix\nelements of the interaction in the laboratory frame, have a too fast fall-off\nat large distances. In the past, in alternative to the harmonic oscillator,\nother single-particle wave functions have been proposed. In this work we\npropose a new single-particle basis, directly linked to the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction. This new basis is orthonormal and complete, has the proper\nasymptotic behavior at large distances and does not contain the continuum which\nwould pose severe convergence problems in nuclear many body calculations. We\nconsider the newly proposed NNLO-opt nucleon-nucleon interaction, without any\nrenormalization.\n  We show that unlike other basis, this single-particle representation has a\ncomputational cost similar to the harmonic oscillator basis with the same space\ntruncation and it gives lower energies for ${}^6He$ and ${}^6Li$.\n", "  ${\\bf Background:}$ Weakly bound and unbound nuclear states appearing around\nparticle thresholds are prototypical open quantum systems. Theories of such\nstates must take into account configuration mixing effects in the presence of\nstrong coupling to the particle continuum space.\n  ${\\bf Purpose:}$ To describe structure and decays of three-body systems, we\ndeveloped a Gamow coupled-channel (GCC) approach in Jacobi coordinates by\nemploying the complex-momentum formalism. We benchmarked the new framework\nagainst the complex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM).\n  ${\\bf Methods:}$ The GCC formalism is expressed in Jacobi coordinates, so\nthat the center-of-mass motion is automatically eliminated. To solve the\ncoupled-channel equations, we use hyperspherical harmonics to describe the\nangular wave functions while the radial wave functions are expanded in the\nBerggren ensemble, which includes bound, scattering and Gamow states.\n  ${\\bf Results:}$ We show that the GCC method is both accurate and robust. Its\nresults for energies, decay widths, and nucleon-nucleon angular correlations\nare in good agreement with the GSM results.\n  ${\\bf Conclusions:}$ We have demonstrated that a three-body GSM formalism\nexplicitly constructed in cluster-orbital shell model coordinates provides\nsimilar results to a GCC framework expressed in Jacobi coordinates, provided\nthat a large configuration space is employed. Our calculations for $A=6$\nsystems and $^{26}$O show that nucleon-nucleon angular correlations are\nsensitive to the valence-neutron interaction. The new GCC technique has many\nattractive features when applied to bound and unbound states of three-body\nsystems: it is precise, efficient, and can be extended by introducing a\nmicroscopic model of the core.\n", "  We explain the fast-moving, ripple-like features in the edge-on debris disk\norbiting the young M dwarf AU Mic. The bright features are clouds of sub-micron\ndust repelled by the host star's wind. The clouds are produced by avalanches:\nradial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass as they shatter\nbackground disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are\ntriggered from a region a few AU across -- the \"avalanche zone\" -- located on\nAU Mic's primary \"birth\" ring, at a true distance of $\\sim$35 AU from the star\nbut at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller: the avalanche\nzone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring\nnearest Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the\nsoutheast, as observed. The avalanche zone marks where the primary ring\nintersects a secondary ring of debris left by the catastrophic disruption of a\nprogenitor up to Varuna in size, less than tens of thousands of years ago. Only\nwhere the rings intersect are particle collisions sufficiently violent to spawn\nthe sub-micron dust needed to seed the avalanches. We show that this picture\nworks quantitatively, reproducing the masses, sizes, and velocities of the\nobserved escaping clouds. The Lorentz force exerted by the wind's magnetic\nfield, whose polarity reverses periodically according to the stellar magnetic\ncycle, promises to explain the observed vertical undulations. The timescale\nbetween avalanches, about 10 yr, might be set by time variability of the wind\nmass-loss rate or, more speculatively, by some self-regulating limit cycle.\n", "  Orientation mapping is a widely used technique for revealing the\nmicrostructure of a polycrystalline sample. The crystalline orientation at each\npoint in the sample is determined by analysis of the diffraction pattern, a\nprocess known as pattern indexing. A recent development in pattern indexing is\nthe use of a brute-force approach, whereby diffraction patterns are simulated\nfor a large number of crystalline orientations, and compared against the\nexperimentally observed diffraction pattern in order to determine the most\nlikely orientation. Whilst this method can robust identify orientations in the\npresence of noise, it has very high computational requirements. In this\narticle, the computational burden is reduced by developing a method for\nnearly-optimal sampling of orientations. By using the quaternion representation\nof orientations, it is shown that the optimal sampling problem is equivalent to\nthat of optimally distributing points on a four-dimensional sphere. In doing\nso, the number of orientation samples needed to achieve a indexing desired\naccuracy is significantly reduced. Orientation sets at a range of sizes are\ngenerated in this way for all Laue groups, and are made available online for\neasy use.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics around an obstacle potential moving in the\nplane-wave state of a pseudospin-$1/2$ Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling. We numerically investigate the dynamics of the system and\nfind that it depends not only on the velocity of the obstacle but also\nsignificantly on the direction of obstacle motion, which are verified by a\nBogoliubov analysis. The excitation diagram with respect to the velocity and\ndirection is obtained. The dependence of the critical velocity on the strength\nof the spin-orbit coupling and the size of the obstacle is also investigated.\n", "  We derive the profile of a vector field coupled to matter on a static and\nspherically symmetric background in the context of generalized Proca theories.\nThe cubic Galileon self-interaction leads to the suppression of a longitudinal\nvector component due to the operation of the Vainshtein mechanism. For quartic\nand sixth-order derivative interactions, the solutions consistent with those in\nthe continuous limit of small derivative couplings correspond to the branch\nwith the vanishing longitudinal mode. We compute the corrections to\ngravitational potentials outside a compact body induced by the vector field in\nthe presence of cubic, quartic, and sixth-order derivative couplings, and show\nthat the models can be consistent with local gravity constraints under mild\nbounds on the temporal vector component. The quintic Galileon interaction does\nnot allow regular solutions of the longitudinal mode for a rapidly decreasing\nmatter density outside the body.\n", "  We report on the insulator-to-metal transition in Se-hyperdoped Si layers\ndriven by manipulating the Se concentration via non-equilibrium material\nprocessing, i.e. ion implantation followed by millisecond-flash lamp annealing.\nElectrical transport measurements reveal an increase of carrier concentration\nand conductivity with increasing Se concentration. For the semi-insulating\nsample with Se concentrations below the Mott limit, quantitative analysis of\nthe temperature dependence of conductivity indicates a variable-range hopping\nmechanism with an exponent of s = 1/2 rather than 1/4, which implies a Coulomb\ngap at the Fermi level. The observed insulator-to-metal transition is\nattributed to the formation of an intermediate band in the Se-hyperdoped Si\nlayers.\n", "  The cosmic-ray (CR) $e^\\pm$ excess observed by AMS-02 can be explained by\ndark matter (DM) annihilation. However, the DM explanation requires a large\nannihilation cross section which is strongly disfavored by other observations,\nsuch as the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observation of dwarf galaxies and the Planck\nobservation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Moreover, the DM\nannihilation cross section required by the CR $e^\\pm$ excess is also too large\nto generate the correct DM relic density with thermal production. In this work\nwe use the Breit-Wigner mechanism with a velocity dependent DM annihilation\ncross section to reconcile these tensions. If DM particles accounting for the\nCR $e^\\pm$ excess with $v\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ are very close to a\nresonance in the physical pole case, their annihilation cross section in the\nGalaxy reaches a maximal value. On the other hand, the annihilation cross\nsection would be suppressed for DM particles with smaller relative velocities\nin dwarf galaxies and at recombination, which may affect the gamma-ray and CMB\nobservations, respectively. We find a proper parameter region that can\nsimultaneously explain the AMS-02 results and the thermal relic density, while\nsatisfying the Fermi-LAT and Planck constraints.\n", "  We present an X-ray imaging and spectroscopic study of the molecular cloud\ninteracting mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnant (SNR) G346.6-0.2 using\nXMM-Newton. The X-ray spectrum of the remnant is well described by a\nrecombining plasma that most likely arises from adiabatic cooling, and has\nsub-solar abundances of Mg, Si, and S. Our fits also suggest the presence of\neither an additional power-law component with a photon index of $\\sim$2, or an\nadditional thermal component with a temperature of $\\sim$2.0 keV. We\ninvestigate the possible origin of this component and suggest that it could\narise from either the Galactic ridge X-ray emission, an unidentified pulsar\nwind nebula or X-ray synchrotron emission from high-energy particles\naccelerated at the shock. However, deeper, high resolution observations of this\nobject are needed to shed light on the presence and origin of this feature.\nBased on its morphology, its Galactic latitude, the density of the surrounding\nenvironment and its association with a dense molecular cloud, G346.6-0.2 most\nlikely arises from a massive progenitor that underwent core-collapse.\n", "  Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with s-process enrichment (CEMP-s) are\nbelieved to be the products of mass transfer from an AGB companion, which has\nlong since become a white dwarf. The surface abundances of CEMP-s stars are\nthus commonly assumed to reflect the nucleosynthesis output of the first AGB\nstars. We have previously shown that, for this to be the case, some physical\nmechanism must counter atomic diffusion in these nearly fully radiative stars,\nwhich otherwise leads to surface abundance anomalies clearly inconsistent with\nobservations. Here we take into account angular momentum accretion by these\nstars. We compute in detail the evolution of typical CEMP-s stars from the\nZAMS, through the mass accretion, and up the RGB for a wide range of specific\nangular momentum of the accreted material, corresponding to rotation velocities\nbetween about 0.3 and 300 km/s. We find that only for specific angular momentum\nabove 1e+17 cm2/s (rotation velocities above 20 km/s) angular momentum\naccretion directly causes chemical dilution of the accreted material. This\ncould nevertheless be relevant to CEMP-s stars, which are observed to rotate\nmore slowly, if they undergo continuous angular momentum loss akin to\nsolar-like stars. In models with rotation velocities characteristic of CEMP-s\nstars, rotational mixing primarily serves to inhibit atomic diffusion, such\nthat the maximal surface abundance variations (with respect to the composition\nof the accreted material) prior to first dredge-up remain within about 0.4 dex\nwithout thermohaline mixing or about 0.5-1.5 dex with thermohaline mixing. Even\nin models with the lowest rotation velocities (under a km/s), rotational mixing\nis able to severely inhibit atomic diffusion, compared to non-rotating models.\nWe thus conclude that it offers a natural solution to the problem posed by\natomic diffusion and cannot be neglected in models of CEMP-s stars.\n", "  We evaluate nonperturbatively the quark quasidistribution amplitude and the\nvalence quark quasidistribution function of the pion in the framework of chiral\nquark models, namely the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and the Spectral Quark\nModel. We arrive at simple analytic expressions, where the nonperturbative\ndependence on the longitudinal momentum of the pion can be explicitly assessed.\nThe model results for the quark quasidistribution amplitude of the pion compare\nfavorably to the data obtained from the Euclidean lattice simulations. The\nquark distribution amplitude, arising in the limit of infinite longitudinal\nmomentum of the pion, agrees, after suitable QCD evolution, to the recent data\nextracted from Euclidean lattices, as well as to the old data from transverse\nlattice simulations.\n", "  We present a finite-difference method for the topology optimization of\npermanent magnets that is based on the FFT accelerated computation of the\nstray-field. The presented method employs the density approach for topology\noptimization and uses an adjoint method for the gradient computation.\nComparsion to various state-of-the-art finite-element implementations shows a\nsuperior performance and accuracy. Moreover, the presented method is very\nflexible and easy to implement due to various preexisting FFT stray-field\nimplementations that can be used.\n", "  We show that, contrary to popular belief, non only diffraction-free beams may\nreconstruct themselves after hitting an opaque obstacle but also, for example,\nGaussian beams. We unravel the mathematics and the physics underlying the\nself-reconstruction mechanism and we provide for a novel definition for the\nminimum reconstruction distance beyond geometric optics, which is in principle\napplicable to any optical beam that admits an angular spectrum representation.\nMoreover, we propose to quantify the self-reconstruction ability of a beam via\na newly established degree of self-healing. This is defined via a comparison\nbetween the amplitudes, as opposite to intensities, of the original beam and\nthe obstructed one. Such comparison is experimentally accomplished by tailoring\nan innovative experimental technique based upon Shack-Hartmann wave front\nreconstruction. We believe that these results can open new avenues in this\nfield.\n", "  We present a systematic ab initio investigation of the longitudinal and\ntransverse spin relaxation times of magnetic single adatoms deposited on\nmetallic substrates. Our analysis based on time-dependent density functional\ntheory shows that the longitudinal time, $T_{\\parallel}$, is of order\nfemtosecond while the transverse time, $T_{\\perp}$, is of order picosecond,\ni.e. $T_{\\perp}\\gg T_{\\parallel}$. This comes as a consequence of the different\nenergy scales of the corresponding processes: $T_{\\parallel}$ involves\nspin-density excitations of order eV, while $T_{\\perp}$ is governed by atomic\nspin-excitations of order meV. Comparison to available inelastic scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy $\\mathrm{d}I/\\mathrm{d}V$ experimental curves shows that\nthe order of magnitude of $T_{\\perp}$ agrees well with our results. Regarding\n$T_{\\parallel}$, the time scale calculated here is several orders of magnitude\nfaster than what has been measured up to now; we therefore propose that an\nultrafast laser pulse measuring technique is required in order to access the\nultrafast spin-dynamics described in this work.\n", "  Understanding the atomic level interactions and the resulting structural\ncharacteristics is required for developing beta-cyclodextrin ($\\beta$CD)\nderivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications. The effect of four\ndifferent solvents on the structures of the native $\\beta$CD and its\nhydrophilic (methylated $\\beta$CD; ME$\\beta$CD and hydroxypropyl $\\beta$CD;\nHP$\\beta$CD) and hydrophobic derivatives (ethylated $\\beta$CD; ET$\\beta$CD)\nwere explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvation free\nenergy calculations. The native $\\beta$CD, 2-ME$\\beta$CD, 6-ME$\\beta$CD,\n2,6-DM$\\beta$CD, 2,3,6-TM$\\beta$CD, 6-HP$\\beta$CD, 2,6-HP$\\beta$CD and\n2,6-ET$\\beta$CD in non-polar solvents (cyclohexane; CHX and octane; OCT) were\nstably formed in symmetric cyclic cavity shape through their intramolecular\nhydrogen bonds. In contrast, $\\beta$CDs in polar solvents (methanol; MeOH and\nwater; WAT) exhibited large structural changes and fluctuations leading to\nsignificant deformations of their cavities. Hydrogen bonding with polar\nsolvents was found to be one of the major contributors to this behavior:\nsolvent-\\b{eta}CD hydrogen bonding strongly competes with intramolecular\nbonding leading to significant changes in structural stability of $\\beta$CDs.\nThe exception to this is the hydrophobic 2,6-ET$\\beta$CD which retained its\nspherical cavity in all solvents. Based on this, it is proposed that\n2,6-ET$\\beta$CD can act as a sustained release drug carrier.\n", "  We propose a two-qubit gate for neutral atoms in which one of the logical\nstate components adiabatically follows a two-atom dark state formed by the\nlaser coupling to a Rydberg state and a strong, resonant dipole-dipole exchange\ninteraction between two Rydberg excited atoms. Our gate exhibits optimal\nscaling of the intrinsic error probability $E \\propto (B\\tau)^{-1}$ with the\ninteratomic interaction strength $B$ and the Rydberg state lifetime $\\tau$.\nMoreover, the gate is resilient to variations in the interaction strength, and\neven for finite probability of double Rydberg excitation, the gate does not\nexcite atomic motion and experiences no decoherence due to\ninternal-translational entanglement.\n", "  The O6 Vn star HD 64315 is believed to belong to the star-forming region\nknown as NGC 2467, but previous distance estimates do not support this\nassociation. We explore the multiple nature of this star with the aim of\ndetermining its distance, and understanding its connection to NGC 2467. A total\nof 52 high-resolution spectra have been gathered over a decade. We use their\nanalysis, in combination with the photometric data from All Sky Automated\nSurvey and Hipparcos catalogues, to conclude that HD 64315 is composed of at\nleast two spectroscopic binaries, one of which is an eclipsing binary. HD 64315\ncontains two binary systems, one of which is an eclipsing binary. The two\nbinaries are separated by 0.09 arcsec (or 500 AU) if the most likely distance\nto the system, around 5 kpc, is considered. The presence of fainter companions\nis not excluded by current observations. The non-eclipsing binary (HD 64315\nAaAb) has a period of 2.70962901+/-0.00000021 d. Its components are hotter than\nthose of the eclipsing binary, and dominate the appearance of the system. The\neclipsing binary (HD 64315 BaBb) has a shorter period of 1.0189569+/-0.0000008\nd. We derive masses of 14.6+-2.3 M$_\\odot$ for both components of the BaBb\nsystem. They are almost identical; both stars are overfilling their respective\nRoche lobes, and share a common envelope in an overcontact configuration. The\nnon-eclipsing binary is a detached system composed of two stars with spectral\ntypes around O6 V with minimum masses of 10.8 M$_\\odot$ and 10.2 M$_\\odot$, and\nlikely masses aprox. 30 M$_\\odot$. HD 64315 provides a cautionary tale about\nhigh-mass star isolation and multiplicity. Its total mass is likely above 90\nM$_\\odot$,but it seems to have formed without an accompanying cluster. It\ncontains one the most massive overcontact binaries known, a likely merger\nprogenitor in a very wide multiple system.\n", "  The estimation of phase errors from digital-holography data is critical for\napplications such as imaging or wave-front sensing. Conventional techniques\nrequire multiple i.i.d. data and perform poorly in the presence of high noise\nor large phase errors. In this paper we propose a method to estimate\nisoplanatic phase errors from a single data realization. We develop a\nmodel-based iterative reconstruction algorithm which computes the maximum a\nposteriori estimate of the phase and the speckle-free object reflectance. Using\nsimulated data, we show that the algorithm is robust against high noise and\nstrong phase errors.\n", "  Context.The Kepler mission has provided a large sample to statistically\nanalyze the orbital properties of the super-Earth planets. We hypothesize that\nthese planets formed early and consider the problem of matching planet\nformation theory to the current observations. Two scenarios, disk migration and\nin-situ formation, have been proposed to explain their origin. In the migration\nscenario planets migrate inward due to planet-disk interaction, whereas in the\nin-situ scenario planets assemble locally. Therefore, planets formed by\nmigration are expected to end up in resonances, whereas those formed in-situ\nare expected to stay in short period ratios and in non-resonant orbits. Both\npredictions are at odds with observations. Aims. We investigate whether a\npreferred formation scenario can be identified through a comparison between the\nmagnetospheric rebound model and the Kepler data. Methods. We conduct N-body\nsimulations of two-planet systems during the disk dispersal phase, and make a\nstatistical comparison between the simulations and the Kepler observations.\nResults. Comparing the two scenarios, we find that magnetospheric rebound tends\nto erase the difference in the orbital configuration that was initially\npresented. After disk dispersal, not all planets are in resonance in the\nmigration scenario, whereas planets do not remain in compact configurations in\nthe in-situ scenario. In both scenarios, the orbits of planets increase with\nthe cavity expansion, and their period ratios have a wider distribution.\nConclusions. From a statistical perspective, the magnetospheric rebound model\nreproduces several observed properties of Kepler planets, such as the\nsignificant number of planets are not in resonances and planet pairs can end up\nat large period ratios. The disparity in orbital configuration between the two\nformation scenarios is substantially reduced after disk dispersal.\n", "  Context: Stars with about 1$-$2 solar masses at the red giant branch (RGB)\nrepresent an intriguing period of stellar evolution, i.e. when the convective\nenvelope interacts with the fast-rotating core. During these mixing episodes\nfreshly synthesized lithium can come up to the stellar surface along with high\nangular momentum material. This high angular momentum may alter the surface\nrotation pattern.\n  Aims: The single rapidly rotating K-giant V1192 Ori is revisited to determine\nits surface differential rotation, lithium abundance, and basic stellar\nproperties such as a precise rotation period. The aim is to independently\nverify the antisolar differential rotation of the star and possibly find a\nconnection to the surface lithium abundance.\n  Methods: We applied time-series Doppler imaging to a new multi-epoch data\nset. Altogether we reconstructed 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data\ncollected with the STELLA robotic telescope between 2007--2016. We used our\ninversion code iMap to reconstruct all stellar surface maps. We extracted the\ndifferential rotation from these images by tracing systematic spot migration as\na function of stellar latitude from consecutive image cross-correlations.\n  Results: The position of V1192 Ori in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nsuggests that the star is in the helium core-burning phase just leaving the RGB\nbump. We measure $A({\\rm Li})_{\\rm NLTE}=1.27$, i.e. a value close to the\nanticipated transition value of 1.5 from Li-normal to Li-rich giants. Doppler\nimages reveal extended dark areas arranged quasi-evenly along an equatorial\nbelt. No cool polar spot is found during the investigated epoch. Spot\ndisplacements clearly suggest antisolar surface differential rotation with\n$\\alpha=-0.11\\pm0.02$ shear coefficient.\n  Conclusions: The surface Li enrichment and the peculiar surface rotation\npattern may indicate a common origin.\n", "  Young protostellar discs provide the initial conditions for planet formation.\nThe properties of these discs may be different from those of late-phase (T\nTauri) discs due to continuing infall from the envelope and protostellar\nvariability resulting from irregular gas accretion. We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar\nsystem mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by\nup to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the\ngas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the\nprotostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of\nthe protostar alone. The enhanced radial pressure gradient expected in young\ndiscs may lead to an increased rate of dust depletion due to gas drag, and\ntherefore to a reduced dust-to-gas ratio.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the itinerant antiferromagnet\n(AFM) CaCo$_{\\mathrm{2}-y}$As$_{2}$ at a temperature of 8 K reveal two\northogonal planes of scattering perpendicular to the Co square lattice in\nreciprocal space, demonstrating the presence of effective one-dimensional spin\ninteractions. These results are shown to arise from near-perfect bond\nfrustration within the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with\nferromagnetic $J_1$, and hence indicate that the extensive previous\nexperimental and theoretical study of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on\nlocal-moment square spin lattices should be expanded to include itinerant spin\nsystems.\n", "  In coalescing neutron star (NS) binaries, tidal force can resonantly excite\nlow-frequency (< 500 Hz) oscillation modes in the NS, transferring energy\nbetween the orbit and the NS. This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected\nby stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a\nsmall but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,\nin fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited.\n", "  We examine three point functions with two scalar operators and a higher spin\ncurrent in 2d W_N minimal model to the next non-trivial order in 1/N expansion.\nThe minimal model was proposed to be dual to a 3d higher spin gauge theory, and\n1/N corrections should be interpreted as quantum effects in the dual gravity\ntheory. We develop a simple and systematic method to obtain three point\nfunctions by decomposing four point functions of scalar operators with Virasoro\nconformal blocks. Applying the method, we reproduce known results at the\nleading order in 1/N and obtain new ones at the next leading order. As\nconfirmation, we check that our results satisfy relations among three point\nfunctions conjectured before.\n", "  Alfven Eigenmodes (AE) can be destabilized by energetic particles in neutral\nbeam injection (NBI) heated plasmas through inverse Landau damping and\ncouplings with gap modes in the shear Alfven continua. We describe the linear\nevolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component of the vorticity in a\nfull 3D system using the reduced MHD equations, density and parallel velocity\nmoments for the energetic particles as well as the geodesic acoustic wave\ndynamics. A closure relation adds the Landau damping and resonant\ndestabilization effects in the model. We apply the model to study the Alfven\nmodes stability in TJ-II, performing a parametric analysis in a range of\nrealistic values of energetic particle $\\beta$ (beta_f), ratios of\nthermal/Alfven velocities (Vth/VA0), energetic particle density profiles and\ntoroidal modes (n) including toroidal and helical couplings. The study predicts\na large helical coupling between different toroidal modes and the\ndestabilization of helical Alfven Eigenmodes (HAE) with frequencies similar to\nthe AE activity measured in TJ-II, between 50 - 400 kHz. The analysis has also\nrevealed the destabilization of GAE (Global Alfven Eigenmodes), TAE (Toroidal\nAlfven Eigenmodes) and EPM (Energetic Particle Modes). For the modes considered\nhere, optimized TJ-II operations require a iota profile in the range of [0.845,\n0.979] to stabilize AEs in the inner and middle plasma. AEs in the plasma\nperiphery cannot be fully stabilized, although for a configuration with iota =\n[0.945, 1.079], only n=7,11,15 AE are unstable with a growth rate 4 times\nsmaller compared to the standard iota = [1.54,1.68] case and a frequency of 100\nkHz. We reproduce the frequency sweeping evolution of the AE frequency observed\nin TJ-II as the iota profile is varied. The AE frequency sweeping is caused by\nconsecutive changes of the instability dominant modes between different helical\nfamilies.\n", "  In our theoretical study where we combine a nonequilibrium Green's function\n(NEGF) approach with density functional theory (DFT) we investigate branched\ncompounds containing ferrocene moieties in both branches which due to their\nmetal centers are designed to allow for asymmetry induced by local charging. In\nthese compounds the ferrocene moieties are connected to pyridyl anchor groups\neither directly or via acetylenic spacers in a meta-connection where we also\ncompare our results with those obtained for the respective single-branched\nmolecules with both meta- and para-connections between the metal center and the\nanchors. We find a destructive quantum interference (DQI) feature in the\ntransmission function slightly below the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\n(LUMO) which dominates the conductance even for the uncharged branched compound\nwith spacer groups inserted. In an analysis based on mapping the structural\ncharacteristics of the range of molecules in our article onto tight-binding\nmodels, we identify the structural source of the DQI minimum as the\nthrough-space coupling between the pyridyl anchor groups. We also find that\nlocal charging on one of the branches only changes the conductance by about one\norder of magnitude which we explain in terms of the spatial distributions of\nthe relevant molecular orbitals for the branched compounds.\n", "  We present a catalogue of 618 high amplitude infrared variable stars (1 <\nDeltaK < 5 mag) detected by the two widely separated epochs of 2.2 um data in\nthe UKIDSS Galactic plane survey, from searches covering 1470 deg^2. Most were\ndiscovered by a search of all fields at 30 < l < 230 deg. Sources include new\ndusty Mira variables, three new CV candidates, a blazar and a peculiar source\nthat may be an interacting binary system. However, c. 60 per cent are YSOs,\nbased on spatial association with star forming regions at distances ranging\nfrom 300 pc to over 10 kpc. This confirms our initial result in Contreras Pena\net al.(Paper I) that YSOs dominate the high amplitude infrared variable sky in\nthe Galactic disc. It is also supported by recently published VVV results at\n295 < l < 350 deg. The spectral energy distributions of the YSOs indicate class\nI or flat spectrum systems in most cases, as in the VVV sample. A large number\nof variable YSOs are associated with the Cygnus X complex and other groups are\nassociated with the North America/Pelican nebula, the Gemini OB1 molecular\ncloud, the Rosette complex, the Cone nebula, the W51 star forming region and\nthe S86 and S236 HII regions. Most of the YSO variability is likely due to\nvariable/episodic accretion on timescales of years, albeit usually less extreme\nthan classical FUors and EXors. Luminosities at the 2010 WISE epoch range from\nc. 0.1 Lsun to 10^3 Lsun but only rarely exceed 10^2.5 Lsun.\n", "  We built a multi-wavelength dataset for galaxies from the Local Volume HI\nSurvey (LVHIS), which comprises 82 galaxies. We also select a sub-sample of ten\nlarge galaxies for investigating properties in the galactic outskirts. The\nLVHIS sample covers nearly four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and two\norders of magnitude in HI mass fraction (fHI). The radial distribution of HI\ngas with respect to the stellar disc is correlated with fHI but with a large\nscatter. We confirm the previously found correlations between the total HI mass\nand star formation rate (SFR), and between HI surface densities and SFR surface\ndensities beyond R25. However, the former correlation becomes much weaker when\nthe average surface densities rather than total mass or rate are considered,\nand the latter correlation also becomes much weaker when the effect of stellar\nmass is removed or controlled. Hence the link between SFR and HI is\nintrinsically weak in these regions, consistent with what was found on kpc\nscales in the galactic inner regions. We find a strong correlation between the\nSFR surface density and the stellar mass surface density, which is consistent\nwith the star formation models where the gas is in quasi-equilibrium with the\nmid-plane pressure. We find no evidence for HI warps to be linked with\ndecreasing star forming efficiencies.\n", "  The relation between braid and exclusion statistics is examined in\none-dimensional systems, within the framework of Chern-Simons statistical\ntransmutation in gauge invariant form with an appropriate dimensional\nreduction. If the matter action is anomalous, as for chiral fermions, a\nrelation between braid and exclusion statistics can be established explicitly\nfor both mutual and nonmutual cases. However, if it is not anomalous, the\nexclusion statistics of emergent low energy excitations is not necessarily\nconnected to the braid statistics of the physical charged fields of the system.\nFinally, we also discuss the bosonization of one-dimensional anyonic systems\nthrough T-duality.\n", "  This paper focuses on NGC 454, a nearby interacting pair of galaxies\n(AM0112-554, RR23), composed of an early-type (NGC 454 E) and a star forming\nlate-type companion (NGC 454 W). We aim at characterizing this wet merger\ncandidate via a multi-lambda analysis, from near-UV to optical using\nSWIFT-UVOT, and mapping the Halpha intensity (I) distribution, velocity (Vr),\nand velocity dispersion (sigma) fields with SAM+Perot-Fabry at SOAR\nobservations. Luminosity profiles suggest that NGC 454 E is an S0. Distortions\nin its outskirts caused by the on-going interaction are visible in both optical\nand near-UV frames. In NGC 454 W, the NUV-UVOT images and the Halpha show a set\nof star forming complexes connected by a faint tail. Halpha emission is\ndetected along the line connecting NGC 454 E to the NGC 454 main HII complex.\nWe investigate the (I-sigma), (I-Vr ) (Vr-sigma) diagnostic diagrams of the HII\ncomplexes, most of which can be interpreted in a framework of expanding\nbubbles. In the main HII complex, enclosed in the UV brightest region, the gas\nvelocity dispersion is highly supersonic reaching 60 km/s. However, Halpha\nemission profiles are mostly asymmetric indicating the presence of multiple\ncomponents with an irregular kinematics. Observations point towards an advanced\nstage of the encounter. Our SPH simulations with chemophotometric\nimplementation suggest that this mixed pair can be understood in terms of a 1:1\ngas/halos encounter giving rise to a merger in about 0.2 Gyr from the present\nstage.\n", "  We study properties of quantim wires with spin-orbit coupling and time\nreversal symmetry breaking, in normal and superconducting states. Electronic\nband structures are classified according to quasi-one-dimensional magnetic\npoint groups, or magnetic classes. The latter belong to one of three distinct\ntypes, depending on the way the time reversal operation appears in the group\nelements. The superconducting gap functions are constructed using antiunitary\noperations and have different symmetry properties depending on the type of the\nmagnetic point group. We obtain the spectrum of the Andreev boundary modes near\nthe end of the wire in a model-independent way, using the semiclassical\napproach with the boundary conditions described by a phenomenological\nscattering matrix. Explicit expressions for the bulk topological invariants\ncontrolling the number of the boundary zero modes are presented in the general\nmultiband case for two types of the magnetic point groups, corresponding to\nDIII and BDI symmetry classes.\n", "  Unlike the neutral gas density, which remains largely constant over redshifts\nof 0 < z < 5, the star formation density exhibits a strong redshift dependence,\nincreasing from the present day before peaking at a redshift of z ~ 2.5. Thus,\nthere is a stark contrast between the star formation rate and the abundance of\nraw material available to fuel it. However, using the ratio of the strength of\nthe HI 21-cm absorption to the total neutral gas column density to quantify the\nspin temperature of the gas, it has recently been shown that its reciprocal may\ntrace the star formation density. This would be expected on the grounds that\nthe cloud of gas must be sufficiently cool to collapse under its own gravity.\nThis, however, relies on very limited data and so here we explore the potential\nof applying the above method to absorbers for which individual column densities\nare not available (primarily MgII absorption systems). By using the mean value\nas a proxy to the column density of the gas at a given redshift, we do, again,\nfind that 1/T (degenerate with the absorber-emitter size ratio) traces the SF\ndensity. If confirmed by higher redshift data, this could offer a powerful tool\nfor future surveys for cool gas throughout the Universe with the Square\nKilometre Array.\n", "  The statistical properties are presented for the direct numerical simulation\n(DNS) of a self-similar adverse pressure gradient (APG) turbulent boundary\nlayer (TBL) at the verge of separation. The APG TBL has a momentum thickness\nbased Reynolds number range from $Re_{\\delta_2}=570$ to $13800$, with a\nself-similar region from $Re_{\\delta_2} = 10000$ to $12300$. Within this domain\nthe average non-dimensional pressure gradient parameter $\\beta=39$, where for a\nunit density $\\beta=\\delta_1 P_e^\\prime / \\tau_w$, with $\\delta_1$ the\ndisplacement thickness, $\\tau_w$ the mean shear stress at the wall, and\n$P_e^\\prime$ the farfield pressure gradient. This flow is compared to previous\nzero pressure gradient (ZPG) and mild APG TBL ($\\beta=1$) results of similar\nReynolds number. All flows are generated via the DNS of a TBL on a flat surface\nwith farfield boundary conditions tailored to apply the desired pressure\ngradient. The conditions for self-similarity, and the appropriate length and\nvelocity scales are derived. The mean and Reynolds stress profiles are shown to\ncollapse when non-dimensionalised on the basis of these length and velocity\nscales. As the pressure gradient increases the flow has properties less like a\nZPG TBL and more akin to a free shear layer.\n", "  We systematically construct a distinct class of complex potentials including\nparity-time ($\\cal PT$) symmetric potentials for the stationary Schr\\\"odinger\nequation by using the soliton and periodic solutions of the four integrable\nreal nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) namely the sine-Gordon (sG)\nequation, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, combined mKdV-sG\nequation and the Gardner equation. These potentials comprise of kink, breather,\nbion, elliptic bion, periodic and soliton potentials which are explicitly\nconstructed from the various respective solutions of the NLEEs. We demonstrate\nthe relevance between the identified complex potentials and the potential of\nthe graphene model from an application point of view.\n", "  We present results for the nonequilibrium dynamics of collapse for a model\nflexible homopolymer on simple cubic lattices with fixed and fluctuating bonds\nbetween the monomers. Results from our Monte Carlo simulations show that,\nphenomenologically, the sequence of events observed during the collapse are\nindependent of the bond criterion. While the growth of the clusters (of\nmonomers) at different temperatures exhibits a nonuniversal power-law behavior\nwhen the bonds are fixed, the introduction of fluctuations in the bonds by\nconsidering the existence of diagonal bonds produces a temperature independent\ngrowth, which can be described by a universal nonequilibrium finite-size\nscaling function with a non-universal metric factor. We also examine the\nrelated aging phenomenon, probed by a suitable two-time density-density\nautocorrelation function showing a simple power-law scaling with respect to the\ngrowing cluster size. Unlike the cluster-growth exponent $\\alpha_c $, the\nnonequilibrium autocorrelation exponent $\\lambda_C$ governing the aging during\nthe collapse, however, is independent of the bond type and strictly follows the\nbounds proposed by two of us in Phys. Rev. E 93, 032506 (2016) at all\ntemperatures.\n", "  Although the title seems self-contradictory, it does not contain a misprint.\nThe model we study is a seemingly minor modification of the \"true self-avoiding\nwalk\" (TSAW) model of Amit, Parisi, and Peliti in two dimensions. The walks in\nit are self-repelling up to a characteristic time $T^*$ (which depends on\nvarious parameters), but spontaneously (i.e., without changing any control\nparameter) become self-trapping after that. For free walks, $T^*$ is\nastronomically large, but on finite lattices the transition is easily\nobservable. In the self-trapped regime, walks are subdiffusive and\nintermittent, spending longer and longer times in small areas until they escape\nand move rapidly to a new area. In spite of this, these walks are extremely\nefficient in covering finite lattices, as measured by average cover times.\n", "  High energy neutrino astrophysics has come of age with the discovery by\nIceCube of neutrinos in the TeV to PeV energy range attributable to\nextragalactic sources at cosmological distances. At such energies,\nastrophysical neutrinos must have their origin in cosmic ray interactions,\nproviding information about the sources of high energy cosmic rays, as well as\nleading to the co-production of high energy gamma-rays. The intimate link with\nthese latter two independently observed types of radiation provides important\ntools in the search for identifying and understanding the nature of their\nastrophysical sources. These neutrinons can provide important constraints about\nthe cosmic ray acceleration process, and since they travel essentially\nunimpeded they can probe our Universe out to the farthest cosmological\ndistances.\n", "  We confirm, quantify, and provide a table of the coherent velocity\nsubstructure of the Milky Way disk within 2 kpc of the Sun towards the Galactic\nanticenter, with 0.2 kpc resolution. We use the radial velocities of ~340,000\nF-type stars obtained with the Guoshoujing Telescope (also known as the Large\nSky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, LAMOST), and proper\nmotions derived from the PPMXL catalog. The PPMXL proper motions have been\ncorrected to remove systematic errors by subtracting the average proper motions\nof galaxies and QSOs that have been confirmed in the LAMOST spectroscopic\nsurvey, and that are within 2.5 degrees of the star's position. We provide the\nresulting table of systematic offsets derived from the PPMXL proper motion\nmeasurements of extragalactic objects identified in the LAMOST spectroscopic\nsurvey. Using the corrected phase- space stellar sample, we find statistically\nsignificant deviations in the bulk disk velocity of 20 km/s or more in the\nthree dimensional velocities of Galactic disk stars. The bulk velocity varies\nsignificantly over length scales of half a kpc or less. The rotation velocity\nof the disk increases by 20 km/s from the Sun's position to 1.5 kpc outside the\nsolar circle. Disk stars in the second quadrant, within 1 kpc of the Sun, are\nmoving radially towards the Galactic center and vertically towards a point a\nfew tenths of a kpc above the Galactic plane; looking down on the disk, the\nstars appear to move in a circular streaming motion with a radius of order 1\nkpc.\n", "  The entropy of the observable universe is increasing. Thus, at earlier times\nthe entropy was lower. However, the cosmic microwave background radiation\nreveals an apparently high entropy universe close to thermal and chemical\nequilibrium. A two-part solution to this cosmic initial entropy problem is\nproposed. Following Penrose, we argue that the evenly distributed matter of the\nearly universe is equivalent to low gravitational entropy. There are two\ncompeting explanations for how this initial low gravitational entropy comes\nabout. (1) Inflation and baryogenesis produce a virtually homogeneous\ndistribution of matter with a low gravitational entropy. (2) Dissatisfied with\nexplaining a low gravitational entropy as the product of a 'special' scalar\nfield, some theorists argue (following Boltzmann) for a 'more natural' initial\ncondition in which the entire universe is in an initial equilibrium state of\nmaximum entropy. In this equilibrium model, our observable universe is an\nunusual low entropy fluctuation embedded in a high entropy universe. The\nanthropic principle and the fluctuation theorem suggest that this low entropy\nregion should be as small as possible and have as large an entropy as possible,\nconsistent with our existence. However, our low entropy universe is much larger\nthan needed to produce observers, and we see no evidence for an embedding in a\nhigher entropy background. The initial conditions of inflationary models are as\nnatural as the equilibrium background favored by many theorists.\n", "  The propagation of plasmonic waves in various metallic quantum nanostructures\nhave considered attention for their applications in technology. The quantum\nplasmonic properties of metallic nanostructures in the quantum size regime have\nbeen difficult to describe by an appropriate model. Here the nonlocal quantum\nplasmons are investigated in the most important metals of copper, gold, and\nsilver. Dispersion properties of these metals and propagation of longitudinal\nquantum plasmons in the high photon energy regime are studied by a new model of\nnonlocal quantum dielectric permittivity. The epsilon near zero properties are\ninvestigated and the spectrum and the damping rate of the longitudinal quantum\nplasmons are obtained in these metals. The quantum plasmon s wave function is\nshown for both classical and quantum limits. It is shown that silver is the\nmost appropriate for quantum metallic structures in the development of next\ngeneration of quantum optical and sensing technologies, due to low intrinsic\nloss.\n", "  This paper presents an a-posteriori goal-oriented error analysis for a\nnumerical approximation of the steady Boltzmann equation based on a\nmoment-system approximation in velocity dependence and a discontinuous Galerkin\nfinite-element (DGFE) approximation in position dependence. We derive\ncomputable error estimates and bounds for general target functionals of\nsolutions of the steady Boltzmann equation based on the DGFE moment\napproximation. The a-posteriori error estimates and bounds are used to guide a\nmodel adaptive algorithm for optimal approximations of the goal functional in\nquestion. We present results for one-dimensional heat transfer and shock\nstructure problems where the moment model order is refined locally in space for\noptimal approximation of the heat flux.\n", "  In this work we study the possible QCD exotic states in the doubly charmed\nbaryon sector. Within chiral effective theory, it is predicted that several\nexcited baryons result from the $S$-wave scattering of ground-state doubly\ncharmed baryons ($\\Xi_{cc}^{++}, \\Xi_{cc}^{+}, \\Omega_{cc}^{+}$) and light\npseudoscalar mesons ($\\pi, K, \\eta$). The excited doubly charmed baryons can be\nclassified by the strangeness ($S$) and isospin ($I$) quantum numbers. Two of\nthe excited states are clearly exotic, in the sense that they cannot be\nexplained by the conventional baryons with three quarks, since their quantum\nnumbers are $(S,I)=(1,0)$ and $(-1,1)$. Similar to the charmed scalar meson\n$D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ in $DK$ scattering and the hyperon $\\Lambda(1405)$ in\n$\\bar{K}N$ scattering, one bound state below the $\\Xi_{cc} \\bar{K}$ threshold\nis predicted in the $(S,I)=(-1,0)$ channel. In addition, two resonant\nstructures are found in the $\\Xi_{cc}\\pi, \\Xi_{cc}\\eta$ and $\\Omega_{cc} K$\ncoupled-channel scattering with $(S,I)=(0,1/2)$. The corresponding pole\npositions and coupling strengths of the excited doubly charmed baryons are\ngiven. The scattering lengths of the ground-state doubly charmed baryons and\nlight pseudoscalar mesons are also predicted. The current study may provide\nuseful guides for future experimental measurements and lattice simulations.\n", "  We present a timing analysis of threeRossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations\nof the black hole binary Cygnus X-1 with the propagating mass accretion rate\nfluctuations model PROPFLUC. The model simultaneously predicts power spectra,\ntime lags, and coherence of the variability as a function of energy. The\nobservations cover the soft and the hard state of the source, and the\ntransition between the two. We find good agreement between model pre-dictions\nand data in the hard and in the soft state. Our analysis suggests that in the\nsoft state the fluctuations propagate in an optically thin hot flow extending\nup to large radii above and below a stable optically thick disc. In the hard\nstate, our results are consistent with a truncated disc geometry, where the hot\nflow extends radially inside the inner radius of the disc. In the transition\nfrom soft to hard state, the characteristics of the rapid variability are too\ncomplex to be successfully described with PROPFLUC. The surface density profile\nof the hot flow predicted by our model and the lack of QPOs in the soft and\nhard state, suggest that the spin of the black hole is aligned with the inner\naccretion disc and therefore probably with the rotational axis of the binary\nsystem.\n", "  We use a new contiguous imaging survey conducted using the Dark Energy Camera\nto investigate the distribution and properties of young stellar populations in\nthe Magellanic inter-Cloud region. These young stars are strongly spatially\nclustered, forming a narrow chain of low-mass associations that trace the\ndensest HI gas in the Magellanic Bridge and extend, in projection, from the SMC\nto the outer disk of the LMC. The associations in our survey footprint have\nages $\\lesssim 30$ Myr, masses in the range $\\sim 100-1200\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, and\nvery diffuse structures with half-light radii of up to $\\sim 100$ pc. The two\nmost populous are strongly elliptical, and aligned to $\\approx 10^{{\\rm o}}$\nwith the axis joining the centres of the LMC and SMC. These observations\nstrongly suggest that the young inter-Cloud populations formed in situ, likely\ndue to the compression of gas stripped during the most recent close LMC-SMC\nencounter. The associations lie at distances intermediate between the two\nClouds, and we find no evidence for a substantial distance gradient across the\nimaged area. Finally, we identify a vast shell of young stars surrounding a\ncentral association, that is spatially coincident with a low column density\nbubble in the HI distribution. The properties of this structure are consistent\nwith a scenario where stellar winds and supernova explosions from massive stars\nin the central cluster swept up the ambient gas into a shell, triggering a new\nburst of star formation. This is a prime location for studying stellar feedback\nin a relatively isolated environment.\n", "  In this paper, we present an overview of concepts and data concerning inverse\ncascades of excitation towards scales larger than the forcing scale in a\nvariety of contexts, from two-dimensional fluids and wave turbulence, to\ngeophysical flows in the presence of rotation and stratification. We briefly\ndiscuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such\ncascades. We then show that the cascade of some invariant, for example the\ntotal energy, may be transferred through nonlinear interactions to both the\nsmall scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This is\nin contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in\nthe context of atmospheric and oceanic observations, direct numerical\nsimulations and modeling. We also show that this dual cascade of total energy\ncan in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic\nand potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small\nenough. In all cases, the potential energy flux remains small, of the order of\n10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux. Finally, we demonstrate that,\nin the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between potential\nand kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with\nstrong departure at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse\ncascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial frequency, and at small scales due\nto unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl number is equal to\none.\n", "  We examine an electric double layer containing an antagonistic salt in an\naqueous mixture, where the cations are small and hydrophilic but the anions are\nlarge and hydrophobic. In this situation, a strong coupling arises between the\ncharge density and the solvent composition. As a result, the anions are trapped\nin an oil-rich adsorption layer on a hydrophobic wall. % while the cations are\nexpelled from it. We then vary the surface charge density $\\sigma$ on the wall.\nFor $\\sigma>0$ the anions remain accumulated, but for $\\sigma<0$ the cations\nare attracted to the wall with increasing $|\\sigma|$. Furthermore, the electric\npotential drop $\\Psi(\\sigma)$ is nonmonotonic when the solvent interaction\nparameter $\\chi(T)$ exceeds a critical value $\\chi_c$ determined by the\ncomposition and the ion density in the bulk. This leads to a first order phase\ntransition between two kinds of electric double layers with different $\\sigma$\nand common $\\Psi$. In equilibrium such two layer regions can coexist. The\nsteric effect due to finite ion sizes is crucial in these phenomena.\n", "  We present a new charge self-consistent scheme combining Density Functional\nand Dynamical Mean Field Theory, which uses Green's function of multiple\nscattering-type. In this implementation the many-body effects are incorporated\ninto the Kohn-Sham iterative scheme without the need for the numerically\nill-posed analytic continuation of the Green's function and of the self-energy.\nThis is achieved by producing the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian in the sub-space of\ncorrelated partial waves and allows to formulate the Green's function directly\non the Matsubara axis. The spectral moments of the Matsubara Green's function\nenable us to put together the real space charge density, therefore the charge\nself-consistency can be achieved. Our results for the spectral functions\n(density of states) and equation of state curves for transition metal elements,\nFe, Ni and FeAl compound agree very well with those of Hamiltonian based\nLDA+DMFT implementations. The current implementation improves on numerical\naccuracy, requires a minimal effort besides the multiple scattering formulation\nand can be generalized in several ways that are interesting for applications to\nreal materials.\n", "  Spectral signatures of surface spots were recently discovered from high\ncadence observations of the A star Vega. We aim at constraining the surface\ndistribution of these photospheric inhomogeneities, and investigating a\npossible short term evolution of the spot pattern. Using data collected over\nfive consecutive nights, we employ the Doppler Imaging method to reconstruct\nthree different maps of the stellar surface, from three consecutive subsets of\nthe whole time-series. The surface maps display a complex distribution of dark\nand bright spots, covering most of the visible fraction of the stellar surface.\nA number of surface features are consistently recovered in all three maps, but\nother features seem to evolve over the time span of observations, suggesting\nthat fast changes can affect the surface of Vega within a few days at most. The\nshort-term evolution is observed as emergence or disappearance of individual\nspots, and may also show up as zonal flows, with low-latitude and high latitude\nbelts rotating faster than intermediate latitudes. It is tempting to relate the\nsurface brightness activity to the complex magnetic field topology previously\nreconstructed for Vega, although strictly simultaneous brightness and magnetic\nmaps will be necessary to assess this potential link.\n", "  We demonstrate a thermodynamic formulation to quantify defect formation\nenergetics in an insulator under high electric field. As a model system, we\nanalyzed neutral oxygen vacancies (color centers) in alkaline-earth-metal\nbinary oxides using density functional theory, Berry phase calculations, and\nmaximally localized Wannier functions. Work of polarization lowers the field\ndependent electric Gibbs energy of formation of this defect. This is attributed\nmainly to the ease of polarizing the two electrons trapped in the vacant site,\nand secondarily to the defect induced reduction in bond stiffness and softening\nof phonon modes. The formulation and analysis have implications for\nunderstanding the behavior of insulating oxides in electronic, magnetic,\ncatalytic, and electrocaloric devices under high electric field.\n", "  In this paper we derive new static phantom traversable wormholes by assuming\na shape function with a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate r. We\nmainly focus our study on wormholes sustained by exotic matter with positive\nenergy density (as seen by any static observer) and a variable equation of\nstate $p_r/\\rho<-1$, dubbed phantom matter. Among phantom wormhole spacetimes\nextending to infinity, we show that a quadratic shape function allows us to\nconstruct static spacetimes of finite size, composed by a phantom wormhole\nconnected to an anisotropic spherically symmetric distribution of dark energy.\nThe wormhole part of the full spacetime does not fulfill the dominant energy\ncondition, while the dark energy part does.\n", "  Cu(pyz)(NO3)2 is a quasi one-dimensional molecular antiferromagnet that\nexhibits three dimensional long-range magnetic order below TN=110 mK due to the\npresence of weak inter-chain exchange couplings. Here we compare calculations\nof the three largest exchange coupling constants in this system using two\ntechniques based on plane-wave basis-set density functional theory: (i) a dimer\nfragment approach and (ii) an approach using periodic boundary conditions. The\ncalculated values of the large intrachain coupling constant are found to be\nconsistent with experiment, showing the expected level of variation between\ndifferent techniques and implementations. However, the interchain coupling\nconstants are found to be smaller than the current limits on the resolution of\nthe calculations. This is due to the computational limitations on convergence\nof absolute energy differences with respect to basis set, which are larger than\nthe inter-chain couplings themselves. Our results imply that errors resulting\nfrom such limitations are inherent in the evaluation of small exchange\nconstants in systems of this sort, and that many previously reported results\nshould therefore be treated with caution.\n", "  Sco X-1 is the brightest persistent X-ray in the sky. It is generally\nbelieved that Sco X-1 is a low-mass X-ray binary containing a neutron star\naccreting from a low-mass donor star where mass transfer is driven by the\nmagnetic braking. However, the mass transfer rate predicted by the standard\nmagnetic braking model is at least one order of magnitude lower than the one\ninferred by X-ray luminosity. In this work, we investigate whether this source\ncould evolved from an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including Ap/Bp stars with\na slightly strong magnetic field of 300 - 1000 G. The coupling between the\nmagnetic field and an irradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from\nthe accretor can yield a strong magnetic braking, which could give rise to a\nrelatively high mass transfer rate. According to the observed orbital period,\nthe mass transfer rate, the mass ratio, and the donor star spectral type, the\nprogenitor of Sco X-1 should be an intermediate-mass X-ray binary including a\n1.6 $-$ 1.8 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ Ap/Bp donor star in a 1.3 $-$ 1.5 day orbit.\nTherefore, we propose that anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars provides\nan alternative evolutionary channel to a part of luminous X-ray sources.\n", "  Under the framework of soft-collinear effective theory, we analyze the\ncharmless $B\\to VV$ decays in a global way at leading power in $1/m_b$ and\nleading order in $\\alpha_s$ with $V$ denoting a light vector meson. In the\nflavor SU(3) symmetry, decay amplitudes for the 28 decay modes are expressed in\nterms of 8 nonperturbative parameters. With 35 experimental results, we fit\nthese 8 nonperturbative parameters. Annihilation contributions are neglected\ndue to power suppression in the $m_b\\to \\infty$ limit, so we include in the fit\nthe nonperturbative charm penguins, which will play an important role in\nunderstanding the direct CP asymmetries. Charming penguins are also responsible\nfor the large transverse polarizations of penguin-dominated and\ncolor-suppressed decays. With the best fitted parameters, we calculate all\npossible physical observables of 28 decay modes, including branching fractions,\ndirect CP asymmetries, and the complete set of polarization observables. Most\nof our results are compatible with the present experimental data when\navailable, while the others can be examined on the ongoing LHCb experiment and\nthe forthcoming Belle-II experiment. Moreover, the agreements and differences\nwith results in QCD factorization and perturbative QCD approach are also\ndiscussed. A few observables are suggested to discriminate these different\napproaches.\n", "  The quiescent periodic photometric modulations of two low-inclination\ncataclysmic variables observed in Kepler K2 Campaigns 0 and 1, KZ Gem and TW\nVir, are investigated. A phase-correcting method was successfully used to\ndetect the orbital modulations of KZ Gem and TW Vir and improve their orbital\nperiods. The light curve morphologies of both CVs were further analyzed by\ndefining flux ratios and creating colormaps. KZ Gem shows ellipsoidal\nmodulations with an orbital period of 0.22242(1) day, twice the period listed\nin the updated RK catalogue (Edition 7.24). With this newly determined period,\nKZ Gem is no longer a CV in the period gap, but a long-period CV. A part of the\nquiescent light curve of TW Vir that had the highest stability was used to\ndeduce its improved orbital period of 0.182682(3) day. The flat patterns shown\nin the colormaps of the flux ratios for KZ Gem demonstrate the stability of\ntheir orbital modulations, while TW Vir show variable orbital modulations\nduring the K2 datasets. In TW Vir, the single versus double-peaked nature of\nthe quiescent orbital variations before and after superoutburst may be related\nto the effect of the superoutburst on the accretion disk.\n", "  Observations of the meridional circulation of the Sun, which plays a key role\nin the operation of the solar dynamo, indicate that its speed varies with the\nsolar cycle, becoming faster during the solar minima and slower during the\nsolar maxima. To explain this variation of the meridional circulation with the\nsolar cycle, we construct a theoretical model by coupling the equation of the\nmeridional circulation (the $\\phi$ component of the vorticity equation within\nthe solar convection zone) with the equations of the flux transport dynamo\nmodel. We consider the back reaction due to the Lorentz force of the\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields and study the perturbations produced in the\nmeridional circulation due to it. This enables us to model the variations of\nthe meridional circulation without developing a full theory of the meridional\ncirculation itself. We obtain results which reproduce the observational data of\nsolar cycle variations of the meridional circulation reasonably well. We get\nthe best results on assuming the turbulent viscosity acting on the velocity\nfield to be comparable to the magnetic diffusivity (i.e. on assuming the\nmagnetic Prandtl number to be close to unity). We have to assume an appropriate\nbottom boundary condition to ensure that the Lorentz force cannot drive a flow\nin the subadiabatic layers below the bottom of the tachocline. Our results are\nsensitive to this bottom boundary condition. We also suggest a hypothesis how\nthe observed inward flow towards the active regions may be produced.\n", "  In contrast to simple monatomic alkali and halide ions, complex polyatomic\nions like nitrate, acetate, nitrite, chlorate etc. have not been studied in any\ngreat detail. Experiments have shown that diffusion of polyatomic ions exhibits\nmany remarkable anomalies, notable among them is the fact that polyatomic ions\nwith similar size show large difference in their diffusivity values. This fact\nhas drawn relatively little interest in scientific discussions. We show here\nthat a mode-coupling theory (MCT) can provide a physically meaningful\ninterpretation of the anomalous diffusivity of polyatomic ions in water, by\nincluding the contribution of rotational jumps on translational friction. The\ntwo systems discussed here, namely aqueous nitrate ion and aqueous acetate ion,\nalthough have similar ionic radii exhibit largely different diffusivity values\ndue to the differences in the rate of their rotational jump motions. We have\nfurther verified the mode-coupling theory formalism by comparing it with\nexperimental and simulation results that agrees well with the theoretical\nprediction.\n", "  Weyl fermions are shown to exist inside a parabolic band, where the kinetic\nenergy of carriers is given by the non-relativistic Schroedinger equation.\nThere are Fermi arcs as a direct consequence of the folding of a ring shaped\nFermi surface inside the first Brillouin zone. Our results stem from the\ndecomposition of the kinetic energy into the sum of the square of the Weyl\nstate, the coupling to the local magnetic field and the Rashba interaction. The\nWeyl fermions break the time and reflection symmetries present in the kinetic\nenergy, thus allowing for the onset of a weak three-dimensional magnetic field\naround the layer. This field brings topological stability to the current\ncarrying states through a Chern number. In the special limit that the Weyl\nstate becomes gapless this magnetic interaction is shown to be purely\nattractive, thus suggesting the onset of a superconducting condensate of zero\nhelicity states.\n", "  Pulsar death line can be defined in $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram. Traditionally,\nradio-loud pulsars are supposed to locate above the death line where is the\nradio-loud region. With the development of observational equipment, the\nobservational properties of the neutron star are remarkably diverse. In\n$P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, some of the special sources are radio-quiet but lie above\nthe death line. From the definition of the pulsar death line, different\nequation of states for neutron star or strange star results in different death\nlines. We discuss the influence of the equation of state on the pulsar death\nline and the possible link between different neutron star groups. The results\nshow that central compact objects would be the small mass of self-bound strange\nstars, and rotating radio transients might be old pulsars on the verge of\ndeath. We suggest that PSR J2144-3933 is likely to be a large mass pulsar,\nwhich would be larger than $2.0\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. Multiple observational facts\nwould help us to reveal the nature of pulsars.\n", "  We solve an adaptive search model where a random walker or L\\'evy flight\nstochastically resets to previously visited sites on a $d$-dimensional lattice\ncontaining one trapping site. Due to reinforcement, a phase transition occurs\nwhen the resetting rate crosses a threshold above which non-diffusive\nstationary states emerge, localized around the inhomogeneity. The threshold\ndepends on the trapping strength and on the walker's return probability in the\nmemoryless case. The transition belongs to the same class as the\nself-consistent theory of Anderson localization. These results show that\nsimilarly to many living organisms and unlike the well-studied Markovian walks,\nnon-Markov movement processes can allow agents to learn about their environment\nand promise to bring adaptive solutions in search tasks.\n", "  Gravitational waves emitted by high redshift sources propagate through\nvarious epochs of the Universe including the current era of measurable,\naccelerated expansion. Historically, the calculation of gravitational wave\npower on cosmological backgrounds is based on various simplifications,\nincluding a $1/r$-expansion and the use of an algebraic projection to retrieve\nthe radiative degrees of freedom. On a de Sitter spacetime, recent work has\ndemonstrated that many of these calculational techniques and approximations do\nnot apply. Here we calculate the power emitted by a binary system on a de\nSitter background using techniques tailored to de Sitter spacetime. The common\nexpression for the power radiated by this source in an FLRW spacetime,\ncalculated using far wave-zone techniques, gives the same expression as the\nlate time expansion specialized to the de Sitter background in the\nhigh-frequency approximation.\n", "  The existence of localized, approximately stationary, lumps of the classical\ngravitational and electromagnetic field -- $geons$ -- was conjectured more than\nhalf a century ago. If one insists on exact stationarity, topologically trivial\nconfigurations in electro-vacuum are ruled out by no-go theorems for solitons.\nBut stationary, asymptotically flat geons found a realization in scalar-vacuum,\nwhere everywhere non-singular, localized field lumps exist, known as (scalar)\nboson stars. Similar geons have subsequently been found in Einstein-Dirac\ntheory and, more recently, in Einstein-Proca theory. We identify the common\nconditions that allow these solutions, which may also exist for other spin\nfields. Moreover, we present a comparison of spherically symmetric geons for\nthe spin $0,1/2$ and $1$, emphasising the mathematical similarities and\nclarifying the physical differences, particularly between the bosonic and\nfermonic cases. We clarify that for the fermionic case, Pauli's exclusion\nprinciple prevents a continuous family of solutions for a fixed field mass;\nrather only a discrete set exists, in contrast with the bosonic case.\n", "  The cosmic merger rate density of black hole binaries (BHBs) can give us an\nessential clue to constraining the formation channels of BHBs, in light of\ncurrent and forthcoming gravitational wave detections. Following a Monte Carlo\napproach, we couple new population-synthesis models of BHBs with the Illustris\ncosmological simulation, to study the cosmic history of BHB mergers. We explore\nsix population-synthesis models, varying the prescriptions for supernovae,\ncommon envelope, and natal kicks. In most considered models, the cosmic BHB\nmerger rate follows the same trend as the cosmic star formation rate. The\nnormalization of the cosmic BHB merger rate strongly depends on the treatment\nof common envelope and on the distribution of natal kicks. We find that most\nBHBs merging within LIGO's instrumental horizon come from relatively metal-poor\nprogenitors (<0.2 Zsun). The total masses of merging BHBs span a large range of\nvalues, from ~6 to ~82 Msun. In our fiducial model, merging BHBs consistent\nwith GW150914, GW151226 and GW170104 represent ~6, 3, and 12 per cent of all\nBHBs merging within the LIGO horizon, respectively. The heavy systems, like\nGW150914, come from metal-poor progenitors (<0.15 Zsun). Most GW150914-like\nsystems merging in the local Universe appear to have formed at high redshift,\nwith a long delay time. In contrast, GW151226-like systems form and merge all\nthe way through the cosmic history, from progenitors with a broad range of\nmetallicities. Future detections will be crucial to put constraints on common\nenvelope, on natal kicks, and on the BHB mass function.\n", "  We present a method for identifying the coherent structures associated with\nindividual Lagrangian flow trajectories even where only sparse particle\ntrajectory data is available. The method, based on techniques in spectral graph\ntheory, uses the Coherent Structure Coloring vector and associated eigenvectors\nto analyze the distance in higher-dimensional eigenspace between a selected\nreference trajectory and other tracer trajectories in the flow. By analyzing\nthis distance metric in a hierarchical clustering, the coherent structure of\nwhich the reference particle is a member can be identified. This algorithm is\nproven successful in identifying coherent structures of varying complexities in\ncanonical unsteady flows. Additionally, the method is able to assess the\nrelative coherence of the associated structure in comparison to the surrounding\nflow. Although the method is demonstrated here in the context of fluid flow\nkinematics, the generality of the approach allows for its potential application\nto other unsupervised clustering problems in dynamical systems such as neuronal\nactivity, gene expression, or social networks.\n", "  We study a sample of 19 galaxy clusters in the redshift range $0.15<z<0.30$\nwith highly complete spectroscopic membership catalogues (to $K < K^{\\ast}(\\rm\nz)+1.5$) from the Arizona Cluster Redshift Survey (ACReS); individual\nweak-lensing masses and near-infrared data from the Local Cluster Substructure\nSurvey (LoCuSS); and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS). We fit the scaling relations between total cluster luminosity in each\nof six bandpasses (${\\it grizJK}$) and cluster mass, finding cluster luminosity\nto be a promising mass proxy with low intrinsic scatter $\\sigma_{\\ln L|M}$ of\nonly $\\sim 10-20$ per cent for all relations. At fixed overdensity radius, the\nintercept increases with wavelength, consistent with an old stellar population.\nThe scatter and slope are consistent across all wavelengths, suggesting that\ncluster colour is not a function of mass. Comparing colour with indicators of\nthe level of disturbance in the cluster, we find a narrower variety in the\ncluster colours of 'disturbed' clusters than of 'undisturbed' clusters. This\ntrend is more pronounced with indicators sensitive to the initial stages of a\ncluster merger, e.g. the Dressler Schectman statistic. We interpret this as\npossible evidence that the total cluster star formation rate is 'standardised'\nin mergers, perhaps through a process such as a system-wide shock in the\nintracluster medium.\n", "  We present a search for optical bursts from the repeating fast radio burst\nFRB 121102 using simultaneous observations with the high-speed optical camera\nULTRASPEC on the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope and radio observations with the\n100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. A total of 13 radio bursts were detected, but\nwe found no evidence for corresponding optical bursts in our 70.7-ms frames.\nThe 5-sigma upper limit to the optical flux density during our observations is\n0.33 mJy at 767nm. This gives an upper limit for the optical burst fluence of\n0.046 Jy ms, which constrains the broadband spectral index of the burst\nemission to alpha < -0.2. Two of the radio pulses are separated by just 34 ms,\nwhich may represent an upper limit on a possible underlying periodicity (a\nrotation period typical of pulsars), or these pulses may have come from a\nsingle emission window that is a small fraction of a possible period.\n", "  We use computer simulations to study the phase behaviour for hard, right\nrhombic prisms as a function of the angle of their rhombic face (the \"slant\"\nangle). More specifically, using a combination of event-driven molecular\ndynamics simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, and free-energy calculations, we\ndetermine and characterize the equilibrium phases formed by these particles for\nvarious slant angles and densities. Surprisingly, we find that the equilibrium\ncrystal structure for a large range of slant angles and densities is the simple\ncubic crystal - despite the fact that the particles do not have cubic symmetry.\nMoreover, we find that the equilibrium vacancy concentration in this simple\ncubic phase is extremely high and depends only on the packing fraction, and not\nthe particle shape. At higher densities, a rhombic crystal appears as the\nequilibrium phase. We summarize the phase behaviour of this system by drawing a\nphase diagram in the slant angle - packing fraction plane.\n", "  We study the magnetic interactions in atomic layers of Fe and 5d\ntransition-metals such as Os, Ir, and Pt on the (001) surface of Rh using\nfirst-principles calculations based on density functional theory. For both\nstackings of the 5d-Fe bilayer on Rh(001) we observe a transition from an\nantiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange interaction upon\n5d band filling. In the sandwich structure 5d/Fe/Rh(001) the nearest neighbor\nexchange is significantly reduced. For FeIr bilayers on Rh(001) we consider\nspin spiral states in order to determine exchange constants beyond nearest\nneighbors. By including spin-orbit coupling we obtain the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI). The magnetic interactions in Fe/Ir/Rh(001) are similar to\nthose of Fe/Ir(001) for which an atomic scale spin lattice has been predicted.\nHowever, small deviations between both systems remain due to the different\nlattice constants and the Rh vs. Ir surface layers. This leads to slightly\ndifferent exchange constants and DMI and the easy magnetization direction\nswitches from out-of-plane for Fe/Ir(001) to in-plane for Fe/Ir/Rh(001).\nTherefore a fine tuning of magnetic interactions is possible by using single 5d\ntransition-metal layers which may allow to tailor antiferromagnetic skyrmions\nin this type of ultrathin films. In the sandwich structure Ir/Fe/Rh(001) we\nfind a strong exchange frustration due to strong hybridization of the Fe layer\nwith both Ir and Rh which drastically reduces the nearest-neighbor exchange.\nThe energy contribution from the DMI becomes extremely large and DMI beyond\nnearest neighbors cannot be neglected. We attribute the large DMI to the low\ncoordination of the Ir layer at the surface. We demonstrate that higher- order\nexchange interactions are significant in both systems which may be crucial for\nthe magnetic ground state.\n", "  We study the molecular and the ionized gas in a possible precursor of an UC\nHII region to contribute to the understanding of how high-mass stars build-up\ntheir masses once they have reached the zero-age main secuence. We carried out\nmolecular observations toward the position of the Red MSX source\nG052.9221-00.4892, using ASTE in the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=3-2, and HCO+ J=4-3\nlines. We also present radio continuum observations at 6 GHz carried out with\nthe JVLA interferometer. Combining these observations with public infrared data\nallowed us to inquire about the nature of the source. The analysis of the\nmolecular observations reveals the presence of a kinetic temperature and H2\ncolumn density gradients across the molecular clump in which the source is\nembedded, with the hotter and less dense gas in the inner region. The 12CO\nJ=3-2 emission shows evidence of misaligned massive molecular outflows, with\nthe blue lobe in positional coincidence with a jet-like feature seen at 8 um.\nThe radio continuum emission shows a slightly elongated compact radio source in\npositional coincidence with the Red MSX source. The polar-like morphology of\nthis compact radio source perfectly matches the hourglass-like morphology\nexhibited by the source in the Ks-band. The axes of symmetry of the radio\nsource and the near-IR nebula are perfectly aligned. Based on the\nmultiwavelength analysis, we suggest that the analyzed source could be\ntransiting a HC HII region phase, in which the young central star emits winds\nand ionizing radiation through the poles. By the other hand, according to a\ncomparison between the Br-gamma and the radio flux density, the source would be\nin a more evolved evolutionary stage of an optically thin UC HII region in\nphotoionization equilibrium. If this is the case, from the radio continuum\nemission, we can conjecture upon the spectral type of its exciting star which\nwould be a B0.5V.\n", "  Aims: In the present work we search for a new model of compact star within\nembedding class one spacetime i.e., four dimensional spacetime embedded in five\ndimensional Pseudo Euclidean space.\n  Methods: In particular we propose a new mass function to obtain an exact\nanalytic solutions of the Einstein field equations. For this specific? mass\nfunction, obtained solutions are well-behaved at the centre of the star,\nsatisfy all energy conditions and the mass-radius relation fall within the\nlimit proposed by Buchdahl [1].\n  Results: The static equilibrium condition has been maintained under different\nforces. We have discussed the solutions in detail and compare with a set of\nastrophysical objects like 4U1608-52, PSR J1903+327, PSR J1614-2230 and X-ray\npulsar Vela X-1 is also explored.\n", "  A polarizable body moving in an external electromagnetic field will slow\ndown. This effect is referred to as radiation damping and is analogous to\nDoppler cooling in atomic physics. Using the principles of special relativity\nwe derive an expression for the radiation damping force and find that it solely\ndepends on the scattered power. The cooling of the particle's center-of-mass\nmotion is balanced by heating due to radiation pressure shot noise, giving rise\nto an equilibrium that depends on the ratio of the field's frequency and the\nparticle's mass. While damping is of relativistic nature heating has it's roots\nin quantum mechanics.\n", "  We study the spontaneous generation and evolution of bending waves in\n$N$-body simulations of two isolated Milky Way-like galaxy models. The models\ndiffer by their disc-to-halo mass ratios, and hence by their susceptibility to\nthe formation of a bar and spiral structure. Seeded from shot noise in the\nparticle distribution, bending waves rapidly form in both models and persist\nfor many billions of years. Waves at intermediate radii manifest as corrugated\nstructures in vertical position and velocity that are tightly wound,\nmorphologically leading, and dominated by the $m=1$ azimuthal Fourier\ncomponent. A spectral analysis of the waves suggests they are a superposition\nof modes from two continuous branches in the Galactocentric radius-rotational\nfrequency plane. The lower-frequency branch is dominant and is responsible for\nthe corrugated, leading, and warped structure. Over time, power in this branch\nmigrates outward, lending credence to an inside-out formation scenario for the\nwarp. Our power spectra qualitatively agree with results from linear\nperturbation theory and a WKB analysis, both of which include self-gravity.\nThus, we conclude that the waves in our simulations are self-gravitating and\nnot purely kinematic. These waves are reminiscent of the wave-like pattern\nrecently found in Galactic star counts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nsmoothly transition to a warp near the disc's edge. Velocity measurements from\n\\textit{Gaia} data will be instrumental in testing the true wave nature of the\ncorrugations. We also compile a list of \"minimum requirements\" needed to\nobserve bending waves in external galaxies.\n", "  Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are dynamic instruments.\nChanging gravitational-wave strains influence the trajectories of null\ngeodesics and therefore modify the interferometric response. These effects will\nbe important when the associated frequencies are comparable to the round-trip\nlight travel time down the detector arms. The arms of advanced detectors\ncurrently in operation are short enough that the strain can be approximated as\nstatic, but planned 3$^\\mathrm{rd}$ generation detectors, with arms an order of\nmagnitude longer, will need to account for these effects. We investigate the\nimpact of neglecting the frequency-dependent detector response for compact\nbinary coalescences and show that it can introduce large systematic biases in\nlocalization, larger than the statistical uncertainty for 1.4-1.4$M_\\odot$\nneutron star coalescences at $z\\lesssim1.7$. Analysis of $3^\\mathrm{rd}$\ngeneration detectors therefore must account for these effects.\n", "  Difference-sideband generation in an optomechanical system coupled to a\ncharged object is investigated beyond the conventional linearized description\nof optomechanical interactions. An exponential decay law for\ndifference-sideband generation in the presence of electric interaction is\nidentified which exhibits more sensitivity to electrical charges than the\nconventional linearized effects. Using exact the same parameters with previous\nwork based on the linearized dynamics of the optomechanical interactions, we\nshow that optomechanically induced difference-sideband generation may enable an\nall-optical sensor for precision measurement of electrical charges with higher\nprecision and lower power. The proposed mechanism is especially suited for\non-chip optomechanical devices, where nonlinear optomechanical interaction in\nthe weak coupling regime is within current experimental reach.\n", "  We present the largest spectroscopic investigation of one of the faintest and\nleast studied stellar clusters of the Milky Way, ESO452-SC11. Using the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope AAOmega and Keck HIRES spectrographs we have\nidentified 11 members of the cluster and found indications of star-to-star\nlight element abundance variation, primarily using the blue cyanogen (CN)\nabsorption features. From a stellar density profile, we estimate a total\ncluster mass of $(6.8\\pm3.4)\\times10^3$ solar masses. This would make\nESO452-SC11 the lowest mass cluster with evidence for multiple populations.\nThese data were also used to measure the radial velocity of the cluster\n($16.7\\pm0.3$ km s$^{-1}$) and confirm that ESO452-SC11 is relatively\nmetal-rich for a globular cluster ([Fe/H]$=-0.81\\pm0.13$). All known massive\nclusters studied in detail show multiple populations of stars each with a\ndifferent chemical composition, but many low-mass globular clusters appear to\nbe chemically homogeneous. ESO452-SC11 sets a lower mass limit for the multiple\nstellar population phenomenon.\n", "  Electronic, magnetic, and transport properties of the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nCuMnAs alloy with tetragonal structure, promising for the AFM spintronics, are\nstudied from first principles using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package. We\ninvestigate the site-occupation of sublattices and the lattice parameters of\nthree competing phases. We analyze the factors that determine which of the\nthree conceivable structures will prevail. We then estimate formation energies\nof possible defects for the experimentally prepared lattice structure. Mn$_{\\rm\nCu}$- and Cu$_{\\rm Mn}$-antisites as well as Mn$\\leftrightarrow$Cu swaps and\nvacancies on Mn or Cu sublattices were identified as possible candidates for\ndefects in CuMnAs. We find that the interactions of the growing thin film with\nthe substrate and with vacuum as well as the electron correlations are\nimportant for the phase stability while the effect of defects is weak. In the\nnext step, using the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital method for the\nexperimental structure, we estimate transport properties for systems containing\ndefects with low formation energies. Finally, we determine the exchange\ninteractions and estimate the N\\'eel temperature of the AFM-CuMnAs alloy using\nthe Monte Carlo approach. A good agreement of the calculated resistivity and\nN\\'eel temperature with experimental data makes possible to draw conclusions\nconcerning the competing phases.\n", "  We present high-sensitivity eMERLIN radio images of the Seyfert galaxy NGC\n4151 at 1.5 GHz. We compare the new eMERLIN images to those from archival\nMERLIN observations in 1993 to determine the change in jet morphology in the 22\nyears between observations. We report an increase by almost a factor of 2 in\nthe peak flux density of the central core component, C4, thought to host the\nblack hole, but a probable decrease in some other components, possibly due to\nadiabatic expansion. The core flux increase indicates an AGN which is currently\nactive and feeding the jet. We detect no significant motion in 22 years between\nC4 and the component C3, which is unresolved in the eMERLIN image. We present a\nspectral index image made within the 512 MHz band of the 1.5 GHz observations.\nThe spectrum of the core, C4, is flatter than that of other components further\nout in the jet. We use HST emission line images (H$\\alpha$, [O III] and [O II])\nto study the connection between the jet and the emission line region. Based on\nthe changing emission line ratios away from the core and comparison with the\neMERLIN radio jet, we conclude that photoionisation from the central AGN is\nresponsible for the observed emission line properties further than 4\" (360 pc)\nfrom the core, C4. Within this region, several evidences (radio-line\nco-spatiality, low [O III]/H$\\alpha$ and estimated fast shocks) suggest\nadditional ionisation from the jet.\n", "  We generalize the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, providing an entropic\nupper bound for average fluxes in time-continuous steady-state systems\n(Gingrich et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 120601 (2016)), to time-discrete Markov\nchains and to systems under time-symmetric, periodic driving.\n", "  The Sun's outer atmosphere is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees,\nand solar plasma flows out into interplanetary space at supersonic speeds. This\npaper reviews our current understanding of these interrelated problems: coronal\nheating and the acceleration of the ambient solar wind. We also discuss where\nthe community stands in its ability to forecast how variations in the solar\nwind (i.e., fast and slow wind streams) impact the Earth. Although the last few\ndecades have seen significant progress in observations and modeling, we still\ndo not have a complete understanding of the relevant physical processes, nor do\nwe have a quantitatively precise census of which coronal structures contribute\nto specific types of solar wind. Fast streams are known to be connected to the\ncentral regions of large coronal holes. Slow streams, however, appear to come\nfrom a wide range of sources, including streamers, pseudostreamers, coronal\nloops, active regions, and coronal hole boundaries. Complicating our\nunderstanding even more is the fact that processes such as turbulence,\nstream-stream interactions, and Coulomb collisions can make it difficult to\nunambiguously map a parcel measured at 1 AU back down to its coronal source. We\nalso review recent progress -- in theoretical modeling, observational data\nanalysis, and forecasting techniques that sit at the interface between data and\ntheory -- that gives us hope that the above problems are indeed solvable.\n", "  We reduce the equations governing the spherically symmetric perturbations of\nstatic spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Vlasov system (with\neither massive or massless particles) to a single stratified wave equation\n$-\\psi_{,tt}=H\\psi$, with $H$ containing second derivatives in radius, and\nintegrals over energy and angular momentum. We identify an inner product with\nrespect to which $H$ is symmetric, and use the Ritz method to approximate the\nlowest eigenvalues of $H$ numerically. For two representative background\nsolutions with massless particles we find a single unstable mode with a growth\nrate consistent with the universal one found by Akbarian and Choptuik in\nnonlinear numerical time evolutions.\n", "  In a sufficiently hot and dense astrophysical environment the rate of the\ntriple-alpha (3alpha) reaction can increase greatly over the value appropriate\nfor helium burning stars owing to hadronically induced de-excitation of the\nHoyle state. In this paper we use a statistical model to evaluate the\nenhancement as a function of temperature and density. For a density of $10^6 gm\ncm^{-3}$ enhancements can exceed a factor of one-hundred. In high\ntemperature/density situations, the enhanced 3alpha rate is a better estimate\nof this rate and should be used in these circumstances. We then examine the\neffect of these enhancements on production of $^{12}$C in the neutrino wind\nfollowing a supernova explosion and in an x-ray burster.\n", "  We present $BVI$ surface photometry of 31 dwarf galaxy candidates discovered\nin a deep image stack from the KMTNet Supernova Program of $\\sim$ 30 square\ndegrees centered on the nearby NGC 2784 galaxy group. Our final images have a\n3$\\sigma$ surface brightness detection limit of $\\mu_V\\approx 28.5$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$. The faintest central surface brightness that we measure is\n$\\mu_{0,V} = 26.1$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If these candidates are at the distance\nof NGC 2784, then they have absolute magnitudes greater than $M_V = -9.5$ mag\nand effective radii larger than 170 pc. Their radial number density decreases\nexponentially with distance from the center of NGC 2784 until it flattens\nbeyond a radius of 0.5 Mpc. We interpret the baseline density level to\nrepresent the background contamination and so estimate that 22 of the 31 new\ncandidates are dwarf members of the group. The candidate's average color,\n$\\langle (B-V)_0\\rangle\\approx 0.7$, and Sersic structural parameters are\nconsistent with those parameters for the dwarf populations of other groups. We\nfind that the central population of dwarfs is redder and brighter than the rest\nof the population. The measured faint end slope of the luminosity function,\n$\\alpha\\approx-1.33$, is steeper than that of the Local Group but consistent\nwith published results for other groups. Such comparisons are complicated by\nsystematic differences among different studies, but will be simpler when the\nKMTNet survey, which will provide homogenous data for 15 to 20 groups, is\ncompleted.\n", "  We study a pair of capacitively coupled singlet-triplet spin qubits. We\ncharacterize the two-qubit decoherence through two complementary measures, the\ndecay time of coupled-qubit oscillations and the fidelity of entangled state\npreparation. We provide a quantitative map of their dependence on charge noise\nand field noise, and we highlight the magnetic field gradient across each\nsinglet-triplet qubit as an effective tool to suppress decoherence due to\ncharge noise.\n", "  To test alternative hypotheses for the behavior of KIC 8462852, we obtained\nmeasurements of the star over a wide wavelength range from the UV to the\nmid-infrared from October 2015 through December 2016, using Swift, Spitzer and\nat AstroLAB IRIS. The star faded in a manner similar to the long-term fading\nseen in Kepler data about 1400 days previously. The dimming rate for the entire\nperiod reported is 22.1 +\\- 9.7 milli-mag/yr in the Swift wavebands, with\namounts of 21.0 +\\- 4.5 mmag in the groundbased B measurements, 14.0 +\\- 4.5\nmmag in V, and 13.0 +\\- 4.5 in R, and a rate of 5.0 +\\- 1.2 mmag/yr averaged\nover the two warm Spitzer bands. Although the dimming is small, it is seen at\n>= 3 sigma by three different observatories operating from the UV to the IR.\nThe presence of long-term secular dimming means that previous SED models of the\nstar based on photometric measurements taken years apart may not be accurate.\nWe find that stellar models with T_{eff} = 7000 - 7100 K and A_V ~ 0.73 best\nfit the Swift data from UV to optical. These models also show no excess in the\nnear-simultaneous Spitzer photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, although a longer\nwavelength excess from a substantial debris disk is still possible (e.g., as\naround Fomalhaut). The wavelength dependence of the fading favors a relatively\nneutral color (i.e., R_V >= 5, but not flat across all the bands) compared with\nthe extinction law for the general ISM (R_V = 3.1), suggesting that the dimming\narises from circumstellar material.\n", "  Surface properties are examined in a chiral d-wave superconductor with\nhexagonal symmetry, whose one-body Hamiltonian possesses the intrinsic\nspin-orbit coupling identical to the one characterizing the topological nature\nof the Kane-Mele honeycomb insulator. In the normal state spin-orbit coupling\ngives rise to spontaneous surface spin currents, whereas in the superconducting\nstate there exist besides the spin currents also charge surface currents, due\nto the chiral pairing symmetry. Interestingly, the combination of these two\ncurrents results in a surface spin polarization, whose spatial dependence is\nmarkedly different on the zigzag and armchair surfaces. We discuss various\npotential candidate materials, such as SrPtAs, which may exhibit these surface\nproperties.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the dynamic response of a confined superfluid\nFermi gas to a rapid change of the scattering length (i.e., an interaction\nquench). Based on a fully microscopic time-dependent density-matrix approach\nwithin the full Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism that includes a 3D harmonic\nconfinement we simulate and identify the emergence of a Goldstone mode of the\nBCS gap in a cigar-shaped $^6$Li gas. By analyzing this Goldstone mode over a\nwide range of parameters, we show that its excitation spectrum is gapless and\nthat its main frequency is not fixed by the trapping potential but that it is\ndetermined by the details of the quench. Thus, we report the emergence of a\npure Goldstone mode of the BCS gap that --in contrast to situations in many\nprevious studies-- maintains its gapless excitation spectrum predicted by the\nGoldstone theorem. Furthermore, we observe that the size-dependent superfluid\nresonances resulting from the atypical BCS-BEC crossover have a direct impact\non this Goldstone mode. Finally, we find that the interaction quench-induced\nGoldstone mode leads to a low-frequency in-phase oscillation of the\nsingle-particle occupations with complete inversion of the lowest-lying\nsingle-particle states which could provide a convenient experimental access to\nthe pure gapless Goldstone mode.\n", "  Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, i.e. 1T-TiSe$_2$ and\n2H-NbSe$_2$, harbor a second order charge density wave (CDW) transition where\nphonons play a key role for the periodic modulations of conduction electron\ndensities and associated lattice distortions. We systematically study the\ntransport and capacitance characteristics over a wide temperature range of\nSchottky barriers formed by intimately contacting freshly exfoliated flakes of\n1T-TiSe$_2$ and 2H-NbSe$_2$ to \\textit{n}-type GaAs semiconductor substrates.\nThe extracted temperature-dependent parameters (zero-bias barrier height,\nideality and built-in potential) reflect changes at the TMD/GaAs interface\ninduced by CDW formation for both TMD materials. The measured built-in\npotential reveals chemical-potential shifts relating to CDW formation. With\ndecreasing temperature a peak in the chemical-potential shifts during CDW\nevolution indicates a competition between electron energy re-distributions and\na combination of lattice strain energies and Coulomb interactions. These\nmodulations of chemical potential in CDW systems, such as 1T-TiSe$_2$ and\n2H-NbSe$_2$ harboring second-order phase transitions, reflect a corresponding\nconversion from short to long-range order.\n", "  We present new photometric data of 11 hot Jupiter transiting exoplanets\n(CoRoT-12b, HAT-P-5b, HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-33b, HAT-P-37b, WASP-2b, WASP-24b,\nWASP-60b, WASP-80b, WASP-103b, XO-3b) in order to update their planetary\nparameters and to constrain information about their atmospheres. These\nobservations of CoRoT-12b, HAT-P-37b and WASP-60b are the first follow-up data\nsince their discovery. Additionally, the first near-UV transits of WASP-80b and\nWASP-103b are presented. We compare the results of our analysis with previous\nwork to search for transit timing variations (TTVs) and a wavelength dependence\nin the transit depth. TTVs may be evidence of a third body in the system and\nvariations in planetary radius with wavelength can help constrain the\nproperties of the exoplanet's atmosphere. For WASP-103b and XO-3b, we find a\npossible variation in the transit depths that may be evidence of scattering in\ntheir atmospheres. The B-band transit depth of HAT-P-37b is found to be smaller\nthan its near-IR transit depth and such a variation may indicate TiO/VO\nabsorption. These variations are detected from 2-4.6$\\sigma$, so follow-up\nobservations are needed to confirm these results. Additionally, a flat spectrum\nacross optical wavelengths is found for 5 of the planets (HAT-P-5b, HAT-P-12b,\nWASP-2b, WASP-24b, WASP-80b), suggestive that clouds may be present in their\natmospheres. We calculate a refined orbital period and ephemeris for all the\ntargets, which will help with future observations. No TTVs are seen in our\nanalysis with the exception of WASP-80b and follow-up observations are needed\nto confirm this possible detection.\n", "  Optical high-resolution spectra of V652 Her and HD 144941, the two extreme\nhelium stars with exceptionally low C/He ratios, have been subjected to a\nnon-LTE abundance analysis using the tools TLUSTY and SYNSPEC. Defining\natmospheric parameters were obtained from a grid of non-LTE atmospheres and a\nvariety of spectroscopic indicators including He I and He II line profiles,\nionization equilibrium of ion pairs such as C II/C III and N II/N III. The\nvarious indicators provide a consistent set of atmospheric parameters: $T_{\\rm\neff}$=25000$\\pm$300K, $\\log g$ = 3.10$\\pm$0.12(cgs), and $\\xi=13\\pm2 {\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$ are provided for V652 Her, and $T_{\\rm eff}$=22000$\\pm$600K, $\\log\ng$ = 3.45$\\pm$0.15 (cgs), and $\\xi=10 {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ are provided for HD\n144941. In contrast to the non-LTE analyses, the LTE analyses - LTE atmospheres\nand a LTE line analysis - with the available indicators do not provide a\nconsistent set of atmospheric parameters. The principal non-LTE effect on the\nelemental abundances is on the neon abundance. It is generally considered that\nthese extreme helium stars with their very low C/He ratio result from the\nmerger of two helium white dwarfs. Indeed, the derived composition of V652 Her\nis in excellent agreement with predictions by Zhang & Jeffery (2012) who model\nthe slow merger of helium white dwarfs; a slow merger results in the merged\nstar having the composition of the accreted white dwarf. In the case of HD\n144941 which appears to have evolved from metal-poor stars a slow merger is\nincompatible with the observed composition but variations of the merger rate\nmay account for the observed composition. More detailed theoretical studies of\nthe merger of a pair of helium white dwarfs are to be encouraged.\n", "  Here we show that a massive spin-3/2 field can hide in the SM spectrum in a\nway revealing itself only virtually. We study collider signatures and loop\neffects of this field, and determine its role in Higgs inflation and its\npotential as Dark Matter. We show that this spin-3/2 field has a rich linear\ncollider phenomenology and motivates consideration of a neutrino-Higgs\ncollider. We also show that study of Higgs inflation, dark matter and dark\nenergy can reveal more about the neutrino and dark sector.\n", "  We have measured the resistivity, the thermopower, and the specific heat of\nthe weak ferromagnetic oxide CaRu0.8Sc0.2O3 in external magnetic fields up to\n140 kOe below 80 K. We have observed that the thermopower Q is significantly\nsuppressed by magnetic fields at around the ferromagnetic transition\ntemperature of 30 K, and have further found that the magneto-thermopower\n{\\Delta}Q(H, T) = Q(H, T) - Q(0, T) is roughly proportional to the\nmagneto-entropy {\\Delta}S(H, T) = S(H, T)-S(0, T).We discuss this relationship\nbetween the two quantities in terms of the Kelvin formula, and find that the\nobserved {\\Delta}Q is quantitatively consistent with the values expected from\nthe Kelvin formula, a possible physical meaning of which is discussed.\n", "  Controlling functionalities, such as magnetism or ferroelectricity, by means\nof oxygen vacancies (VO) is a key issue for the future development of\ntransition metal oxides. Progress in this field is currently addressed through\nVO variations and their impact on mainly one order parameter. Here we reveal a\nnew mechanism for tuning both magnetism and ferroelectricity simultaneously by\nusing VO. Combined experimental and density-functional theory studies of\nEu0.5Ba0.5TiO3-{\\delta}, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies create Ti3+ 3d1\ndefect states, mediating the ferromagnetic coupling between the localized Eu\n4f7 spins, and increase an off-center displacement of Ti ions, enhancing the\nferroelectric Curie temperature. The dual function of Ti sites also promises a\nmagnetoelectric coupling in the Eu0.5Ba0.5TiO3-{\\delta}.\n", "  We investigate measuring the peculiar motions of galaxies up to $z=0.5$ using\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from LSST, and predict the subsequent constraints\non the growth rate of structure. We consider two cases. Our first is based on\nmeasurements of the volumetric SNe Ia rate and assumes we can obtain\nspectroscopic redshifts and light curves for varying fractions of objects that\nare detected pre-peak luminosity by LSST (some of which may be obtained by LSST\nitself and others which would require additional follow-up). We find that these\nmeasurements could produce growth rate constraints at $z<0.5$ that\nsignificantly outperform those using Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) with DESI\nor 4MOST, even though there are $\\sim4\\times$ fewer objects. For our second\ncase, we use semi-analytic simulations and a prescription for the SNe Ia rate\nas a function of stellar mass and star formation rate to predict the number of\nLSST SNe IA whose host redshifts may already have been obtained with the\nTaipan+WALLABY surveys, or with a future multi-object spectroscopic survey. We\nfind $\\sim 18,000$ and $\\sim 160,000$ SN Ia with host redshifts for these cases\nrespectively. Whilst this is only a fraction of the total LSST-detected SNe Ia,\nthey could be used to significantly augment and improve the growth rate\nconstraints compared to only RSD. Ultimately, we find that combining LSST SNe\nIa with large numbers of galaxy redshifts will provide the most powerful probe\nof large scale gravity in the $z<0.5$ regime over the coming decades.\n", "  We consider the full effective theory for quantum gravity at second order in\ncurvature including non-local terms. We show that the theory contains two new\ndegrees of freedom beyond the massless graviton: namely a massive spin-2 ghost\nand a massive scalar field. Furthermore, we show that it is impossible to\nfine-tune the parameters of the effective action to eliminate completely the\nclassical spin-2 ghost because of the non-local terms in the effective action.\nBeing a classical field, it is not clear anyway that this ghost is problematic.\nIt simply implies a repulsive contribution to Newton's potential. We then\nconsider how to extract the parameters of the effective action and show that it\nis possible to measure, at least in principle, the parameters of the local\nterms independently of each other using a combination of observations of\ngravitational waves and measurements performed by pendulum type experiments\nsearching for deviations of Newton's potential.\n", "  We use stellar proper motions from the TGAS catalog to study the kinematics\nof OB-associations. The TGAS proper motions of OB-associations generally agree\nwell with the Hipparcos proper motions. The parameters of the Galactic rotation\ncurve obtained with TGAS and Hipparcos proper motions agree within the errors.\nThe average one-dimensional velocity dispersion inside 18 OB-associations with\nmore than 10 TGAS stars is sigma_v=3.9 km s-1, which is considerably smaller,\nby a factor of 0.4, than the velocity dispersions derived from Hipparcos data.\nThe effective contribution from orbital motions of binary OB-stars into the\nvelocity dispersion sigma_v inside OB-associations is sigma_b=1.2 km s-1. The\nmedian virial and stellar masses of OB-associations are equal to 7.1 10^5 and\n9.0 10^3 Ms, respectively. Thus OB-associations must be unbound objects\nprovided they do not include a lot of dense gas. The median star-formation\nefficiency is epsilon=2.1 percent. Nearly one third of stars of OB-associations\nmust lie outside their tidal radius. We found that the Per OB1 and Car OB1\nassociations are expanding with the expansion started in a small region of\n11--27 pc 7--10 Myr ago. The average expansion velocity is 6.3 km s-1.\n", "  Supermassive black holes and/or very dense stellar clusters are found in the\ncentral regions of galaxies. Nuclear star clusters are present mainly in faint\ngalaxies while upermassive black holes are common in galaxies with masses $\\geq\n10^{10}$ M$_\\odot $. In the intermediate galactic mass range both types of\ncentral massive objects (CMOs) are found. Here we present our collection of a\nhuge set of nuclear star cluster and massive black hole data that enlarges\nsignificantly already existing data bases useful to investigate for\ncorrelations of their absolute magnitudes, velocity dispersions and masses with\nstructural parameters of their host galaxies. In particular, we directed our\nattention to some differences between the correlations of nuclear star clusters\nand massive black holes as subsets of CMOs with hosting galaxies. In this\ncontext, the mass-velocity dispersion relation plays a relevant role because it\nseems the one that shows a clearer difference between the supermassive black\nholes and nuclear star clusters. The $M_{MBH}-{\\sigma}$ has a slope of $5.19\\pm\n0.28$ while $M_{NSC}-{\\sigma}$ has the much smaller slope of $1.84\\pm 0.64$.\nThe slopes of the CMO mass- host galaxy B magnitude of the two types of CMOs\nare indistinguishable within the errors while that of the NSC mass-host galaxy\nmass relation is significantly smaller than for supermassive black holes.\nAnother important result is the clear depauperation of the NSC population in\nbright galaxy hosts, which reflects also in a clear flattening of the NSC mass\nvs host galaxy mass at high host masses.\n", "  The exclusive photoproduction of $\\Upsilon (nS)$ states were calculated in\nultra-peripheral collisions for coherent and incoherent process in PbPb at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.5 TeV. Different dipole models were compared in the\ntheoretical framework of light-cone color dipole formalism. Moreover, it was\ncalculated the differential cross section for the Upsilon states and their\ntotal cross section for two intervals of rapidity: $|y|\\leq 4$ 4 and $ 2 \\le$ y\n$\\le 4.5$. A systematic study is done on the theoretical uncertainties\nassociated to the production and predictions are presented for the first time\nfor the incoherent cross section of the radially excited states.\n", "  Nuclear dynamics at short distances is one of the most fascinating topics of\nstrong interaction physics. The physics of it is closely related to the\nunderstanding the role of the QCD in generating nuclear forces at short\ndistances as well as understanding the dynamics of the super-dense cold nuclear\nmatter relevant to the interior of neutron stars. With an emergence of high\nenergy electron and proton beams there is a significant recent progress in high\nenergy nuclear scattering experiments aimed at studies of short-range structure\nof nuclei. This in turn stimulated new theoretical studies resulting in the\nobservation of several new phenomena specific to the short range structure of\nnuclei. In this work we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in\nstudies of short-range correlations in nuclei and their importance for\nadvancing our understanding of the dynamics of nuclear interactions at small\ndistances.\n", "  We analyze a confined multiple-ribbon M2.1 flare (SOL2015-01-29T11:42) that\noriginated from a fan-spine coronal magnetic field configuration, within active\nregion NOAA 12268. The observed ribbons form in two steps. First, two primary\nribbons form at the main flare site, followed by the formation of secondary\nribbons at remote locations. We observe a number of plasma flows at\nextreme-ultraviolet temperatures during the early phase of the flare (as early\nas 15 min before the onset) propagating towards the formation site of the\nsecondary ribbons. The secondary ribbon formation is co-temporal with the\narrival of the pre-flare generated plasma flows. The primary ribbons are\nco-spatial with RHESSI hard X-ray sources, whereas no enhanced X-ray emission\nis detected at the secondary ribbons sites. The (E)UV emission, associated with\nthe secondary ribbons, peaks ~1 min after the last RHESSI hard X-ray\nenhancement. A nonlinear force-free model of the coronal magnetic field reveals\nthat the secondary flare ribbons are not directly connected to the primary\nribbons, but to regions nearby. Detailed analysis suggests that the secondary\nbrightenings are produced due to dissipation of kinetic energy of the plasma\nflows (heating due to compression), and not due to non-thermal particles\naccelerated by magnetic reconnection, as is the case for the primary ribbons.\n", "  We investigate isospin-symmetry breaking effects in the sd-shell region with\nlarge-scale shell-model calculations, aiming to understand the recent anomalies\nobserved in superallowed Fermi beta-decay. We begin with calculations of\nCoulomb displacement energies (CDE's) and triplet displacement energies (TDE's)\nby adding the T=1,J=0 isospin nonconserving (INC) interaction into the usual\nisospin-invariant Hamiltonian. It is found that CDE's and TDE's can be\nsystematically described with high accuracy. A total number of 122 one- and\ntwo-proton separation energies are predicted accordingly, and locations of the\nproton drip-line and candidates for proton-emitters are thereby suggested.\nHowever, attempt to explain the anomalies in the superallowed Fermi beta-decay\nfails because these well-fitted T=1,J=0 INC interactions are found no effects\non the nuclear matrix elements. It is demonstrated that the observed large\nisospin-breaking correction in the 32Cl beta-decay, the large isospin-mixing in\nthe 31Cl beta-decay, and the small isospin-mixing in the 23Al beta-decay can be\nconsistently understood by introducing additional T=1,J=2 INC interactions\nrelated to the s1/2 orbit.\n", "  We carried out inelastic neutron scattering experiments on a buckled\nhoneycomb lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_{2}$NiTeO$_{6}$ exhibiting a stripe\nstructure at a low temperature. Magnetic excitations are observed in the energy\nrange of $\\hbar \\omega \\lesssim 10$ meV having an anisotropy gap of 2 meV at 2\nK. We perform spin-wave calculations to identify the spin model. The obtained\nmicroscopic parameters are consistent with the location of the stripe structure\nin the classical phase diagram. Furthermore, the Weiss temperature\nindependently estimated from a bulk magnetic susceptibility is consistent with\nthe microscopic parameters. The results reveal that a competition between the\nNN and NNN interactions that together with a relatively large single ion\nmagnetic anisotropy stabilize the stripe magnetic structure.\n", "  Under the commonly used spherical collapse model, we study how dark energy\naffects the growth of large scale structures of the Universe in the context of\nagegraphic dark energy models. The dynamics of the spherical collapse of dark\nmatter halos in nonlinear regimes is determined by the properties of the dark\nenergy model. We show that the main parameters of the spherical collapse model\nare directly affected by the evolution of dark energy in the agegraphic dark\nenergy models. We compute the spherical collapse quantities for different\nvalues of agegraphic model parameter $\\alpha$ in two different scenarios:\nfirst, when dark energy does not exhibit fluctuations on cluster scales, and\nsecond, when dark energy inside the overdense region collapses similar to dark\nmatter. Using the Sheth-Tormen and Reed mass functions, we investigate the\nabundance of dark matter halos in the framework of agegraphic dark energy\ncosmologies. The model parameter $\\alpha$ is a crucial parameter in order to\ncount the abundance of dark matter halos. Specifically, the present analysis\nsuggests that the agegraphic dark energy model with bigger (smaller) value of\n$\\alpha$ predicts less (more) virialized halos with respect to that of\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We also show that in agegraphic dark energy models, the\nnumber of halos strongly depends on clustered or uniformed distributions of\ndark energy.\n", "  We present new ALMA observations tracing the morphology and velocity\nstructure of the molecular gas in the central galaxy of the cluster Abell 1795.\nThe molecular gas lies in two filaments that extend 5 - 7 kpc to the N and S\nfrom the nucleus and project exclusively around the outer edges of two inner\nradio bubbles. Radio jets launched by the central AGN have inflated bubbles\nfilled with relativistic plasma into the hot atmosphere surrounding the central\ngalaxy. The N filament has a smoothly increasing velocity gradient along its\nlength from the central galaxy's systemic velocity at the nucleus to -370 km/s,\nthe average velocity of the surrounding galaxies, at the furthest extent. The S\nfilament has a similarly smooth but shallower velocity gradient and appears to\nhave partially collapsed in a burst of star formation. The close spatial\nassociation with the radio lobes, together with the ordered velocity gradients\nand narrow velocity dispersions, show that the molecular filaments are gas\nflows entrained by the expanding radio bubbles. Assuming a Galactic\n$X_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ factor, the total molecular gas mass is\n$3.2\\pm0.2\\times10^{9}$M$_{\\odot}$. More than half lies above the N radio\nbubble. Lifting the molecular clouds appears to require an infeasibly efficient\ncoupling between the molecular gas and the radio bubble. The energy required\nalso exceeds the mechanical power of the N radio bubble by a factor of two.\nStimulated feedback, where the radio bubbles lift low entropy X-ray gas that\nbecomes thermally unstable and rapidly cools in situ, provides a plausible\nmodel. Multiple generations of radio bubbles are required to lift this\nsubstantial gas mass. The close morphological association then indicates that\nthe cold gas either moulds the newly expanding bubbles or is itself pushed\naside and shaped as they inflate.\n", "  We propose a new efficient permanent magnet, SmCoNiFe3, that is a\nbreakthrough development of the well-known SmCo5 prototype. More modern\nneodymium magnets of the Nd-Fe-B type have an advantage over SmCo5 because of\ntheir greater maximum energy products due to their iron-rich stoichiometry. Our\nnew magnet, however, removes most of this disadvantage of SmCo5 while\npreserving its superior high-temperature efficiency over the neodymium magnets.\n", "  The study of photonic crystals, artificial materials whose dielectric\nproperties can be tailored according to the stacking of its constituents,\nremains an attractive research area. In this article we have employed a\ntransfer matrix treatment to study the propagation of light waves in Fibonacci\nquasiperiodic dieletric multilayers with graphene embedded. We calculated their\ndispersion and transmission spectra in order to investigate the effects of the\ngraphene monolayers and quasiperiodic disorder on the system physical behavior.\nThe quasiperiodic dieletric multilayer is composed of two building blocks,\nsilicon dioxide (building block A = SiO2) and titanium dioxide (building block\nB = TiO2). Our numerical results show that the presence of graphene monolayers\nreduces the transmissivity on the whole range of frequency and induces a\ntransmission gap in the low frequency region. Regarding the polarization of the\nlight wave, we found that the transmission coefficient is higher for the\ntransverse magnetic (TM) case than for the transverse electric (TE) one. We\nalso conclude from our numerical results that the graphene induced photonic\nbandgaps (GIPBGs) do not depend on the polarization (TE or TM) of the light\nwave nor on the Fibonacci generation index n. Moreover, the GIPBGs are\nomnidirectional photonic band gaps, therefore light cannot propagate in this\nstructures for frequencies lower than a certain value, whatever the incidence\nangle. Finally, a plot of the transmission spectra versus chemical potential\nshows that one can, in principle, adjust the width of the photonic band gap by\ntuning the chemical potential via a gate voltage.\n", "  The ultracompact low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 situated in the globular\ncluster NGC 6624 has an orbital period of only $\\approx$11.4 min which likely\nimplies a white dwarf companion. The observed X-ray bursts demonstrate a\nphotospheric radius expansion phase and therefore are believed to reach the\nEddington luminosity allowing us to estimate the mass and the radius of the\nneutron star (NS) in this binary. Here we re-analyse all Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer observations of the system and confirm that almost all the bursts took\nplace during the hard persistent state of the system. This allows us to use the\nrecently developed direct cooling tail method to estimate the NS mass and\nradius. However, because of the very short, about a second, duration of the\ncooling tail phases that can be described by the theoretical atmosphere models,\nthe obtained constraints on the NS radius are not very strict. Assuming a pure\nhelium NS atmosphere we found that the NS radius is in the range 10-12 km, if\nthe NS mass is below 1.7 $M_\\odot$, and in a wider range of 8-12 km for a\nhigher 1.7-2.0 $M_\\odot$ NS mass. The method also constrains the distance to\nthe system to be 6.5$\\pm$0.5 kpc, which is consistent with the distance to the\ncluster. For the solar composition atmosphere, the NS parameters are in strong\ncontradiction with the generally accepted range of possible NS masses and\nradii.\n", "  The velocity and density distribution of $e^\\pm$ in the pulsar wind are\ncrucial distinction among magnetosphere models, and contains key parameters\ndetermining the high energy emission of pulsar binaries. In this work, a direct\nmethod is proposed, which might probe the properties of the wind from one\npulsar in a double-pulsar binary. When the radio signals from the first-formed\npulsar travel through the relativistic $e^\\pm$ flow in the pulsar wind from the\nyounger companion, the components of different radio frequencies will be\ndispersed. It will introduce an additional frequency-dependent time-of-arrival\ndelay of pulses, which is function of the orbital phase. In this paper, we\nformulate the above-mentioned dispersive delay with the properties of the\npulsar wind. As examples, we apply the formula to the double pulsar system PSR\nJ0737-3039A/B and the pulsar-neutron star binary PSR B1913+16. For PSR\nJ0737-3039A/B, the time delay in 300\\,MHz is $\\lesssim10\\mu$s near the\nsuperior-conjunction, under the optimal pulsar wind parameters, which is $\\sim$\nhalf of the current timing accuracy. For PSR B1913+16, with the assumption that\nthe neutron star companion has a typical spin down luminosity of\n$10^{33}$\\,ergs/s, the time delay is as large as $10\\sim20\\mu$s in 300\\,MHz.\nThe best timing precision of this pulsar is $\\sim5\\mu$s in 1400\\,MHz.\nTherefore, it is possible that we can find this signal in archival data.\nOtherwise, we can set an upper-limit on the spin down luminosity. Similar\nanalysis can be apply to other eleven known pulsar-neutron star binaries\n", "  Period-luminosity (PL) sequences of long period variables (LPVs) are commonly\ninterpreted as different pulsation modes, but there is disagreement on the\nmodal assignment. Here, we re-examine the observed PL sequences in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud, including the sequence of long secondary periods (LSPs), and\ntheir associated pulsation modes. Firstly, we theoretically model the sequences\nusing linear, radial, non-adiabatic pulsation models and a population synthesis\nmodel of the LMC red giants. Then, we use a semi-empirical approach to assign\nmodes to the pulsation sequences by exploiting observed multi-mode pulsators.\nAs a result of the combined approaches, we consistently find that sequences B\nand C$^{\\prime}$ both correspond to first overtone pulsation, although there\nare some fundamental mode pulsators at low luminosities on both sequences. The\nmasses of these fundamental mode pulsators are larger at a given luminosity\nthan the mass of the first overtone pulsators. These two sequences B and\nC$^{\\prime}$ are separated by a small period interval in which large amplitude\npulsation in a long secondary period (sequence D variability) occurs, meaning\nthat the first overtone pulsation is not seen as the primary mode of pulsation.\nObservationally, this leads to the splitting of the first overtone pulsation\nsequence into the two observed sequences B and C$^{\\prime}$. Our two\nindependent examinations also show that sequences A$^{\\prime}$, A and C\ncorrespond to third overtone, second overtone and fundamental mode pulsation,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present an analysis of the evolutionary and pulsation properties of the\nextremely low-mass white dwarf precursor (B) component of the double-lined\neclipsing system WASP 0247-25. Given that the fundamental parameters of that\nstar have been obtained previously at a unique level of precision, WASP\n0247-25B represents the ideal case for testing evolutionary models of this\nnewly-found category of pulsators. Taking into account the known constraints on\nthe mass, orbital period, effective temperature, surface gravity, and\natmospheric composition, we present a model that is compatible with these\nconstraints and show pulsation modes that have periods very close to the\nobserved values. Importantly, these modes are predicted excited. Although the\noverall consistency remains perfectible, the observable properties of WASP\n0247-25B are closely reproduced. A key ingredient of our binary evolutionary\nmodels is represented by rotational mixing as the main competitor against\ngravitational settling. Depending on assumptions made about the values of the\ndegree index l for the observed pulsation modes, we found three possible\nseismic solutions. We discuss two tests, rotational splitting and multicolor\nphotometry, that should readily identify the modes and discriminate between\nthese solutions. However, this will require improved temporal resolution and\nhigher S/N observations than currently available.\n", "  We report on the development of a versatile cryogen-free laboratory cryostat\nbased upon a commercial pulse tube cryocooler. It provides enough cooling power\nfor continuous recondensation of circulating $^4$He gas at a condensation\npressure of approximately 250~mbar. Moreover, the cryostat allows for exchange\nof different cryostat-inserts as well as fast and easy \"wet\" top-loading of\nsamples directly into the 1 K pot with a turn-over time of less than 75~min.\nStarting from room temperature and using a $^4$He cryostat-insert, a base\ntemperature of 1.0~K is reached within approximately seven hours and a cooling\npower of 250~mW is established at 1.24~K.\n", "  We present an optical and near-infrared (hereafter NIR) polarimetric study of\na comet C/2013 US10 (Catalina) observed on UT 2015 December 17-18 at phase\nangles of $\\alpha$=52.1 deg - 53.1 deg. Additionally, we obtained an optical\nspectrum and multi-band images to examine the influence of gas emission. We\nfind that the observed optical signals are significantly influenced by gas\nemission, that is, the gas-to-total intensity ratio varies from 5 to 30 % in\nthe $R_{\\rm C}$ and 3 to 18 % in the $I_{\\rm C}$ bands, depending on the\nposition in the coma. We derive the `gas-free dust polarization degrees' of\n13.8$\\pm$1.0 % in the $R_{\\rm C}$ and 12.5$\\pm$1.1 % in the $I_{\\rm C}$ bands\nand a gray polarimetric color, i.e., -8.7$\\pm$9.9 % $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$$^{-1}$ in\noptical and 1.6$\\pm$0.9 % $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$$^{-1}$ in NIR. The increments of\npolarization obtained from the gas correction show that the polarimetric\nproperties of the dust in this low-polarization comet are not different from\nthose in high-polarization comets. In this process, the cometocentric distance\ndependence of polarization has disappeared. We also find that the $R_{\\rm\nC}$-band polarization degree of the southeast dust tail, which consists of\nlarge dust particles (100 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ - 1 mm), is similar to that in the\nouter coma where small and large ones are mixed. Our study confirms that the\ndichotomy of cometary polarization does not result from the difference of dust\nproperties, but from depolarizing gas contamination. This conclusion can\nprovide a strong support for similarity in origin of comets.\n", "  Mn$_3$GaC undergoes a ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic, volume\ndiscontinuous cubic-cubic phase transition as a function of temperature,\npressure and magnetic field. Through a series of temperature dependent x-ray\nabsorption fine structure spectroscopy experiments at the Mn K and Ga K edge,\nit is shown that the first order magnetic transformation in Mn$_3$GaC is\nentirely due to distortions in Mn sub-lattice and with a very little role for\nMn-C interactions. The distortion in Mn sub-lattice results in long and short\nMn-Mn bonds with the longer Mn-Mn bonds favoring ferromagnetic interactions and\nthe shorter Mn-Mn bonds favoring antiferromagnetic interactions. At the first\norder transition, the shorter Mn-Mn bonds exhibit an abrupt decrease in their\nlength resulting in an antiferromagnetic ground state and a strained lattice.\n", "  In order to study a molecular-cloud-scale chemical composition, we have\nconducted a mapping spectral line survey toward the Galactic molecular cloud\nW3(OH), which is one of the most active star forming regions in the Perseus\narm, with the NRO 45 m telescope. We have observed the area of 16' $\\times$\n16', which corresponds to 9.0 pc $\\times$ 9.0 pc. The observed frequency ranges\nare 87--91, 96--103, and 108--112 GHz. We have prepared the spectrum averaged\nover the observed area, in which 8 molecular species CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC,\nCS, SO, C$^{18}$O, and $^{13}$CO are identified. On the other hand, the\nspectrum of the W3(OH) hot core observed at a 0.17 pc resolution shows the\nlines of various molecules such as OCS, H$_2$CS CH$_3$CCH, and CH$_3$CN, in\naddition to the above species. In the spatially averaged spectrum, emission of\nthe species concentrated just around the star-forming core such as CH$_3$OH and\nHC$_3$N is fainter than in the hot core spectrum, whereas emission of the\nspecies widely extended over the cloud such as CCH is relatively brighter. We\nhave classified the observed area into 5 subregions according to the integrated\nintensity of $^{13}$CO, and have evaluated the contribution to the averaged\nspectrum from each subregion. The CCH, HCN, HCO$^+$, and CS lines can be seen\neven in the spectrum of the subregion with the lowest $^{13}$CO integrated\nintensity range ($< 10$ K km s$^{-1}$). Thus, the contributions of the\nspatially extended emission is confirmed to be dominant in the spatially\naveraged spectrum.\n", "  To better understand how planets form, it is important to study planet\noccurrence rates as a function of stellar mass. However, estimating masses of\nfield stars is often difficult. Over the past decade, a controversy has arisen\nabout the inferred occurrence rate of gas-giant planets around evolved\nintermediate-mass stars -- the so-called `retired A-stars'. The high masses of\nthese red-giant planet hosts, derived using spectroscopic information and\nstellar evolution models, have been called into question. Here we address the\ncontroversy by determining the masses of eight evolved planet-hosting stars\nusing asteroseismology. We compare the masses with spectroscopic-based masses\nfrom the Exoplanet Orbit Database that were previously adopted to infer\nproperties of the exoplanets and their hosts. We find a significant one-sided\noffset between the two sets of masses for stars with spectroscopic masses above\nroughly 1.6Msun, suggestive of an average 15--20% overestimate of the adopted\nspectroscopic-based masses. The only star in our sample well below this mass\nlimit is also the only one not showing this offset. Finally, we note that the\nscatter across literature values of spectroscopic-based masses often exceed\ntheir formal uncertainties, making it comparable to the offset we report here.\n", "  The energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) principle of compromise in\ncompetition is believed to be generally applicable for all mesoscale problems\nat different levels in the real world, spanning from elementary particles to\nthe universe. This stimulated a fundamental proposition of the concept of\nmesoscience. This article discusses a potential universality of the\nregime-specific multi-objective variational feature of this underlying\nprinciple through case studies in chemical engineering. It is also elucidated\nwhy the currently available variational principles are not applicable to the\nmesoscale problems. The paper concludes with prospects on future study.\n", "  We present the molecular gas mass fraction ($f_\\mathrm{H_2}$) and\nstar-formation efficiency (SFE) of local galaxies on the basis of our new\nCO($J=1-0$) observations with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope, combined with\nthe COLDGASS galaxy catalog, as a function of galaxy environment defined as the\nlocal number density of galaxies measured with SDSS DR7 spectroscopic data. Our\nsample covers a wide range in the stellar mass and SFR, and covers wide\nenvironmental range over two orders of magnitude. This allows us to conduct the\nfirst, systematic study of environmental dependence of molecular gas properties\nin galaxies from the lowest- to the highest-density environments in the local\nuniverse. We confirm that both $f_\\mathrm{H_2}$ and SFE have strong positive\ncorrelations with the SFR offset from the star-forming main sequence\n($\\Delta$MS), and most importantly, we find that these correlations are\nuniversal across all environments. Our result demonstrates that star-formation\nactivity within individual galaxies is primarily controlled by their molecular\ngas content, regardless of their global environment. Therefore, we claim that\none always needs to be careful about the $\\Delta$MS distribution of the sample\nwhen investigating the environmental effects on the H$_2$ gas content in\ngalaxies.\n", "  We report on magnetotransport properties of a MgZnO/ZnO heterostructure\nsubjected to weak direct currents. We find that in the regime of overlapping\nLandau levels, the differential resistivity acquires a quantum correction\nproportional to both the square of the current and the Dingle factor. The\nanalysis shows that the correction to the differential resistivity is dominated\nby a current-induced modification of the electron distribution function and\nallows us to access both quantum and inelastic scattering rates.\n", "  We report on Hall field-induced resistance oscillations (HIRO) in a 60\nnm-wide GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well with an \\emph{in situ} grown back gate, which\nallows tuning the carrier density $n$. At low $n$, when all electrons are\nconfined to the lowest subband (SB1), the HIRO frequency, proportional to the\nproduct of the cyclotron diameter and the Hall field, scales with $n^{-1/2}$,\nas expected. Remarkably, population of the second subband (SB2) significantly\nenhances HIRO, while their frequency now scales as $n^{-1}$. We demonstrate\nthat in this two-subband regime HIRO still originate solely from backscattering\nof SB1 electrons. The unusual density dependence occurs because the population\nof SB2 steadily increases, while that of SB1 remains essentially unchanged. The\nenhancement of HIRO manifests an unexpected, step-like increase of the quantum\nlifetime of SB1 electrons, which reaches a record value of 52 ps in the\ntwo-subband regime.\n", "  The Chromospheric Lyman Alpha Spectropolarimeter (CLASP) observed the Sun in\nH I Lyman-{\\alpha} during a suborbital rocket flight on September 3, 2015. The\nInterface Region Imaging Telescope (IRIS) coordinated with the CLASP\nobservations and recorded nearly simultaneous and co-spatial observations in\nthe Mg II h&k lines. The Mg II h and Ly-{\\alpha} lines are important\ntransitions, energetically and diagnostically, in the chromosphere. The\ncanonical solar atmosphere model predicts that these lines form in close\nproximity to each other and so we expect that the line profiles will exhibit\nsimilar variability. In this analysis, we present these coordinated\nobservations and discuss how the two profiles compare over a region of quiet\nsun at viewing angles that approach the limb. In addition to the observations,\nwe synthesize both line profiles using a 3D radiation-MHD simulation. In the\nobservations, we find that the peak width and the peak intensities are well\ncorrelated between the lines. For the simulation, we do not find the same\nrelationship. We have attempted to mitigate the instrumental differences\nbetween IRIS and CLASP and to reproduce the instrumental factors in the\nsynthetic profiles. The model indicates that formation heights of the lines\ndiffer in a somewhat regular fashion related to magnetic geometry. This\nvariation explains to some degree the lack of correlation, observed and\nsynthesized, between Mg II and Ly-{\\alpha}. Our analysis will aid in the\ndefinition of future observatories that aim to link dynamics in the\nchromosphere and transition region.\n", "  The extremely young Class 0 object B1b-S and the first hydrostatic core\n(FSHC) candidate, B1b-N, provide a unique opportunity to study the chemical\nchanges produced in the elusive transition from the prestellar core to the\nprotostellar phase. We present 40\"x70\" images of Barnard 1b in the 13CO 1->0,\nC18O 1->0, NH2D 1_{1,1}a->1_{0,1}s, and SO 3_2->2_1 lines obtained with the\nNOEMA interferometer. The observed chemical segregation allows us to unveil the\nphysical structure of this young protostellar system down to scales of ~500au.\nThe two protostellar objects are embedded in an elongated condensation, with a\nvelocity gradient of ~0.2-0.4 m s^{-1} au^{-1} in the east-west direction,\nreminiscent of an axial collapse. The NH2D data reveal cold and dense\npseudo-disks (R~500-1000 au) around each protostar. Moreover, we observe\nevidence of pseudo-disk rotation around B1b-S. We do not see any signature of\nthe bipolar outflows associated with B1b-N and B1b-S, which were previously\ndetected in H2CO and CH3OH, in any of the imaged species. The non-detection of\nSO constrains the SO/CH3OH abundance ratio in the high-velocity gas.\n", "  Superconducting (SC) gap symmetry and magnetic response of cubic\nU0.97Th0.03Be13 are studied by means of high-precision heat-capacity and dc\nmagnetization measurements using a single crystal, in order to address the\nlong-standing question of its second phase transition at Tc2 in the SC state\nbelow Tc1. The absence (presence) of an anomaly at Tc2 in the field-cooling\n(zero-field-cooling) magnetization indicates that this transition is between\ntwo different SC states. There is a qualitative difference in the field\nvariation of the transition temperatures; Tc2(H) is isotropic whereas Tc1(H)\nexhibits a weak anisotropy between [001] and [111] directions. In the low\ntemperature phase below Tc2(H), the angle-resolved heat-capacity $C(T,H, \\phi)$\nreveals that the gap is fully opened over the Fermi surface, narrowing down the\npossible gap symmetry.\n", "  We report the effect of symmetry-broken contacts on quantum transport in\nquasi-one-dimensional lattices. In contrast to 1D chains, transport in\nquasi-one-dimensional lattices, which are made up of a finite number of 1D\nchain layers, is strongly influenced by contacts. Contact symmetry depends on\nwhether the contacts maintain or break the parity symmetry between the layers.\nWith balanced on-site potential, a flat band can be detected by asymmetric\ncontacts, but not by symmetric contacts. In the case of asymmetric contacts\nwith imbalanced on-site potential, transmission is suppressed at certain\nenergies. We elucidate these energies of transmission suppression related to\nantiresonance using reduced lattice models and Feynman paths. These results\nprovide a nondestructive measurement of flat band energy which it is difficult\nto detect.\n", "  High-precision angle-resolved dc magnetization and magnetic torque studies\nwere performed on a single-crystalline sample of URhGe, an orthorhombic Ising\nferromagnet with the $c$ axis being the magnetization easy axis, in order to\ninvestigate the phase diagram around the ferromagnetic (FM) reorientation\ntransition in a magnetic field near the $b$ axis. We have clearly detected\nfirst-order transition in both the magnetization and the magnetic torque at low\ntemperatures, and determined detailed profiles of the wing structure of the\nthree-dimensional $T$-$H_{b}$-$H_{c}$ phase diagram, where $H_{c}$ and $H_{b}$\ndenotes the field components along the $c$ and the $b$ axes, respectively. The\nquantum wing critical points are located at $\\mu_0H_c\\sim\\pm$1.1 T and\n$\\mu_0H_b\\sim$13.5 T. Two second-order transition lines at the boundaries of\nthe wing planes rapidly tend to approach with each other with increasing\ntemperature up to $\\sim 3$ K. Just at the zero conjugate field ($H_c=0$),\nhowever, a signature of the first-order transition can still be seen in the\nfield derivative of the magnetization at $\\sim 4$ K, indicating that the\ntricritical point exists in a rather high temperature region above 4 K. This\nfeature of the wing plane structure is consistent with the theoretical\nexpectation that three second-order transition lines merge tangentially at the\ntriciritical point.\n", "  We present calibrations for star formation rate indicators in the\nultraviolet, mid-infrared and radio continuum bands, including one of the first\ndirect calibrations of 150 MHz as a star formation rate indicator. Our\ncalibrations utilize 66 nearby star forming galaxies with Balmer decrement\ncorrected H-alpha luminosities, which span 5 orders of magnitude in star\nformation rate and have absolute magnitudes of -24<M_r<-12. Most of our\nphotometry and spectrophotometry is measured from the same region of each\ngalaxy, and our spectrophotometry has been validated with SDSS photometry, so\nour random and systematic errors are small relative to the intrinsic scatter\nseen in star formation rate indicator calibrations. We find WISE W4 (22.8\nmicron), Spitzer 24 micron and 1.4 GHz have tight correlations with Balmer\ndecrement corrected H-alpha luminosity, with scatter of only 0.2 dex. Our\ncalibrations are comparable to those from the prior literature for L* galaxies,\nbut for dwarf galaxies our calibrations can give star formation rates that are\nfar greater than those derived from much of the prior literature.\n", "  The streaming instability is often invoked as solution to the fragmentation\nand drift barriers in planetesimal formation, catalyzing the aggregation of\ndust on kyr timescales to grow km-sized cores. However there remains a lack of\nconsensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One\npotential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of\nrelatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc\nlifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in\nthe depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a\nlocal pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then\nbecome susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional\nviscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,\nwe explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range\nof parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals\nis often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We\nconclude that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of\ndebris discs, rather than a common mechanism for the formation of planetary\ncores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar investigation that\nconsidered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation of\ntens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily\na consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until\nobservations more tightly constrain photoevaporation models, the relevance of\nthis process to the formation of planets remains uncertain.\n", "  Massive circumstellar disks are prone to gravitational instabilities, which\ntrigger the formation of spiral arms that can fragment into bound clumps under\nthe right conditions. Two dimensional simulations of self-gravitating disks are\nuseful starting points for studying fragmentation, allowing for high-resolution\nsimulations of thin disks. However, convergence issues can arise in 2D from\nvarious sources. One of these sources is the 2D approximation of self-gravity,\nwhich exaggerates the effect of self-gravity on small scales when the potential\nis not smoothed to account for the assumed vertical extent of the disk. This\neffect is enhanced by increased resolution, resulting in fragmentation at\nlonger cooling timescales $\\beta$. If true, it suggests that the 3D simulations\nof disk fragmentation may not have the same convergence problem and could be\nused to examine the nature of fragmentation without smoothing self-gravity on\nscales similar to the disk scale height. To that end, we have carried out local\n3D self-gravitating disk simulations with simple $\\beta$ cooling with fixed\nbackground irradiation to determine if 3D is necessary to properly describe\ndisk fragmentation. Above a resolution of $\\sim 40$ grid cells per scale\nheight, we find that our simulations converge with respect to the cooling\ntimescale. This result converges in agreement with analytic expectations which\nplace a fragmentation boundary at $\\beta_\\mathrm{crit} = 3$.\n", "  The Sun, aside from its eleven year sunspot cycle is additionally subject to\nlong term variation in its activity. In this work we analyse a solar-like\nconvective dynamo simulation, containing approximately 60 magnetic cycles,\nexhibiting equatorward propagation of the magnetic field, multiple frequencies,\nand irregular variability, including a missed cycle and complex parity\ntransitions between dipolar and quadrupolar modes. We compute the turbulent\ntransport coefficients, describing the effects of the turbulent velocity field\non the mean magnetic field, using the test-field method. The test-field\nanalysis provides a plausible explanation of the missing cycle in terms of the\nreduction of $\\alpha_{\\phi\\phi}$ in advance of the reduced surface activity,\nand enhanced downward turbulent pumping during the event to confine some of the\nmagnetic field at the bottom of the convection zone, where local maximum of\nmagnetic energy is observed during the event. At the same time, however, a\nquenching of the turbulent magnetic diffusivities is observed, albeit\ndifferently distributed in depth compared to the other transport coefficients.\nTherefore, dedicated mean-field modelling is required for verification.\n", "  Circuit QED techniques have been instrumental to manipulate and probe with\nexquisite sensitivity the quantum state of superconducting quantum bits coupled\nto microwave cavities. Recently, it has become possible to fabricate new\ndevices where the superconducting quantum bits are replaced by hybrid\nmesoscopic circuits combining nanoconductors and metallic reservoirs. This\nmesoscopic QED provides a new experimental playground to study the light-matter\ninteraction in electronic circuits. Here, we present the experimental state of\nthe art of Mesoscopic QED and its theoretical description. A first class of\nexperiments focuses on the artificial atom limit, where some quasiparticles are\ntrapped in nanocircuit bound states. In this limit, the Circuit QED techniques\ncan be used to manipulate and probe electronic degrees of freedom such as\nconfined charges, spins, or Andreev pairs. A second class of experiments\nconsists in using cavity photons to reveal the dynamics of electron tunneling\nbetween a nanoconductor and fermionic reservoirs. For instance, the Kondo\neffect, the charge relaxation caused by grounded metallic contacts, and the\nphoto-emission caused by voltage-biased reservoirs have been studied. The\ntunnel coupling between nanoconductors and fermionic reservoirs also enable one\nto obtain split Cooper pairs, or Majorana bound states. Cavity photons\nrepresent a qualitatively new tool to study these exotic condensed matter\nstates.\n", "  The bright, nearby DA-type white dwarf (WD) 40 Eridani B is orbited by the M\ndwarf 40 Eri C, allowing determination of the WD's mass. Until recently,\nhowever, the mass depended on orbital elements determined four decades ago, and\nthat mass was so low that it created several astrophysical puzzles. Using new\nastrometric measurements, the binary-star group at the U.S. Naval Observatory\nhas revised the dynamical mass upward, to $0.573\\pm0.018\\,M_\\odot$. In this\npaper we use model-atmosphere analysis to update other parameters of the WD,\nincluding effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, and luminosity. We\nthen compare these results with WD interior models. Within the observational\nuncertainties, theoretical cooling tracks for CO-core WDs of its measured mass\nare consistent with the position of 40 Eri B in the H-R diagram; equivalently,\nthe theoretical mass-radius relation (MRR) is consistent with the star's\nlocation in the mass-radius plane. This consistency is, however, achieved only\nif we assume a \"thin\" outer hydrogen layer, with $q_{\\rm H}=M_{\\rm H}/M_{\\rm\nWD}\\simeq10^{-10}$. We discuss other evidence that a significant fraction of DA\nWDs have such thin H layers, in spite of expectation from canonical\nstellar-evolution theory of \"thick\" H layers with $q_{\\rm H}\\simeq10^{-4}$. The\ncooling age of 40 Eri B is $\\sim$122 Myr, and its total age is $\\sim$1.8 Gyr.\nWe present the MRRs for 40 Eri B and three other nearby WDs in visual binaries\nwith precise mass determinations, and show that the agreement of current theory\nwith observation is excellent in all cases.\n", "  Planetary rings produce a distinct shape distortion in transit lightcurves.\nHowever, to accurately model such lightcurves the observations need to cover\nthe entire transit, especially ingress and egress, as well as an out-of-transit\nbaseline. Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover\nring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a\nsmall part of the transit. Substructure in the rings, e.g. gaps, can be\nrecovered if the width of the features ($\\delta W$) relative to the size of the\nstar is similar to the intrinsic velocity resolution (set by the width of the\nlocal stellar profile, $\\gamma$) relative to the stellar rotation velocity ($v$\nsin$i$, i.e. $\\delta W / R_* \\gtrsim v$sin$i$/$\\gamma$). This opens up a new\nway to study the ring systems around planets with long orbital periods, where\nobservations of the full transit, covering the ingress and egress, are not\nalways feasible.\n", "  AX J1745.6-2901 is a Low Mass X-ray Binary with an accreting neutron star,\nshowing clear evidence for highly ionized absorption. Strong ionized Fe\nK$\\alpha$ and K$\\beta$ absorption lines are always observed during the soft\nstate, whereas they disappear during the hard states. We computed\nphotoionization stability curves for the hard and the soft state, under\ndifferent assumptions on the adopted spectral energy distributions and the\nphysical parameters of the plasma. We observe that the ionized absorber lies\nalways on a stable branch of the photoionization stability curve during the\nsoft state, while it becomes unstable during the hard state. This suggests that\nphotoionization instability plays a key role in defining the observable\nproperties of the ionized absorber. The same process might explain the\ndisappearance of the high ionization absorber/wind, during the hard state in\nother accreting neutron stars and black holes.\n", "  The influence of the large scale structure on host halos may be studied by\nexamining the angular infall pattern of subhalos. In particular, since warm and\ncold dark matter cosmologies predict different abundances and internal\nproperties for halos at the low mass end of the mass function, it is\ninteresting to examine if there are differences in how these low mass halos are\naccreted. The accretion events are defined as the moment a halo becomes a\nsubstructure, namely when it crosses its host's virial radius. We quantify the\ncosmic web at each point by the shear tensor and examine where, with respect to\nits eigenvectors, such accretion events occur in cold ($\\Lambda$CDM) and warm\n(1keV sterile neutrino WDM) dark matter cosmological models. We find that the\nCDM and WDM subhalos are preferentially accreted along the principal axis of\nthe shear tensor corresponding to the direction of weakest collapse. The\nbeaming strength is modulated by the host and subhalo masses and by the\nredshift at which the accretion event occurs. Although strongest for the most\nmassive hosts and subhalos at high redshift, the preferential infall is found\nto be always aligned with the axis of weakest collapse, thus we say that it has\nuniversal nature. We compare the strength of beaming in the WDM cosmology with\nthe one found in the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario. While the main findings remain the\nsame, the accretion in the WDM model for the most massive host halos appears\nmore beamed than in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology across all the redshifts.\n", "  We present a three dimensional (3D) extinction analysis in the region toward\nthe supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0-1.7) using multi-band photometric data\nfrom the Xuyi Schmidt Telescope Photometric Survey of the Galactic Anticentre\n(XSTPS-GAC), 2MASS and WISE. We isolate a previously unrecognised dust\nstructure likely to be associated with SNR S147. The structure, which we term\nas \"S147 dust cloud\", is estimated to have a distance $d$ = 1.22 $\\pm$ 0.21\nkpc, consistent with the conjecture that S147 is associated with pulsar PSR\nJ0538 + 2817. The cloud includes several dense clumps of relatively high\nextinction that locate on the radio shell of S147 and coincide spatially with\nthe CO and gamma-ray emission features. We conclude that the usage of CO\nmeasurements to trace the SNR associated MCs is unavoidably limited by the\ndetection threshold, dust depletion, and the difficulty of distance estimates\nin the outer Galaxy. 3D dust extinction mapping may provide a better way to\nidentify and study SNR-MC interactions.\n", "  We compare eight sources of reddening and extinction estimates for\napproximately 60,000 {\\it Gaia} DR1 Tycho--Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)\nmain sequence stars younger than 3~Gyr with a relative error of the {\\it Gaia}\nparallax less than 0.1. For the majority of the stars, the best 2D dust\nemission-based reddening maps show considerable differences between the\nreddening to infinity and the one calculated to the stellar distance using the\nbarometric law of the dust distribution. This proves that the majority of the\nTGAS stars are embedded in to the Galactic dust layer and a proper 3D treatment\nof the reddening/extinction is required to reliably calculate their de-reddened\ncolors and absolute magnitudes. The sources with the 3D estimates of reddening\nare tested in their ability to put the stars among the PARSEC and MIST\ntheoretical isochrones in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram based on the precise\n{\\it Gaia}, {\\it Tycho-2}, 2MASS and {\\it WISE} photometry. Only the\nreddening/extinction estimates by Arenou et al. (1992), Gontcharov (2012), and\nGontcharov (2017), being appropriate for nearby stars within 280~pc, provide\nboth the minimal number of outliers bluer than any reasonable isochrone and the\ncorrect number of stars younger than 3~Gyr in agreement with the Besan\\c{c}on\nGalaxy model.\n", "  The outburst of V404 Cyg during the summer of 2015 reached unparalleled\nintensities at X-ray and soft gamma-ray energies with fluxes \\( > 50\\) Crab in\nthe \\(20-50\\) keV energy band. To date, studies in the hard X-ray/soft\ngamma-ray energy domain have focused primarily on the energy spectra. In this\nwork, timing analysis has been performed with \\textit{INTEGRAL}/SPI data in the\n\\(20-300\\) keV energy range for \\textit{INTEGRAL} revolution 1557, which\ncorresponds to the brightest flare of V404 Cyg (on June, 26). The power spectra\nare fit with broken power-law and multi-Lorentzian models and compared with\npreviously reported results of V404 Cyg flaring activity from 1989 and 2015.\nAlso, we took advantage of the good signal-to-noise ratio obtained above 70 keV\nto quantify the timing/fast-variability properties of the source as a function\nof energy. We then point out similarities of V404 Cyg with the black hole\ntransient V4641 Sgr. Like V4641 Sgr, we found the power spectra of V404 Cyg\nduring high flux periods did not possess the expected flat-top feature\ntypically seen in a hard spectral state. Interpretations are proposed in the\nframework of the fluctuating-propagation model to explain the observed\nproperties.\n", "  Integrating high-mobility graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\ninto spin transport devices is one of the key tasks in graphene spintronics. We\nuse a van der Waals pickup technique to transfer CVD graphene by hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) from the copper growth substrate onto predefined Co/MgO\nelectrodes to build inverted spin valve devices. Two approaches are presented:\n(i) a process where the CVD-graphene/hBN stack is first patterned into a bar\nand then transferred by a second larger hBN crystal onto spin valve electrodes\nand (ii) a direct transfer of a CVD-graphene/hBN stack. We report record high\nspin lifetimes in CVD graphene of up to 1.75 ns at room temperature. Overall,\nthe performances of our devices are comparable to devices fabricated from\nexfoliated graphene also revealing nanosecond spin lifetimes. We expect that\nour dry transfer methods pave the way towards more advanced device geometries\nnot only for spintronic applications but also for CVD-graphene-based\nnanoelectronic devices in general where patterning of the CVD graphene is\nrequired prior to the assembly of final van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  We present multi-epoch, $R-$band imaging obtained from the Palomar Transient\nFactory of a small, fan-shaped reflection nebula in NGC 1333 that experiences\nprominent brightness fluctuations. Photometry of HBC 340 (K7e) and HBC 341\n(M5e), a visual pair of late-type, young stellar objects lying near the apex of\nthe nebula, demonstrates that while both are variable, the former has\nbrightened by more than two magnitudes following a deep local minimum in\nSeptember 2014. Keck high dispersion (R$\\sim$45,000-66,000), optical\nspectroscopy of HBC 340 suggests that the protostar is a spectroscopic binary\n(HBC 340Aa + HBC 340Ab). Both HBC 340 and HBC 341 exhibit strong H$\\alpha$ and\nforbidden line emission, consistent with accretion and outflow. We conclude\nthat the brightness fluctuations in the reflection nebula represent light echos\nproduced by varying incident radiation emanating from HBC 340. The short-term\nvariability observed in the protostar is attributed to irregular accretion\nactivity, while correlated, dipping behavior on a several hundred day time\nscale may be due to eclipse-like events caused by orbiting circumstellar\nmaterial. Archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the region reveals a\nsecond, faint (F814W$\\sim$20.3 mag) companion to HBC 340 that lies 1.02\"\n($\\sim$235 AU) east of the protostar. If associated, this probable substellar\nmass object (20-50 Jupiter masses), HBC 340B, is likely unrelated to the\nobserved brightness variations. The sustained brightening of HBC 340 since late\n2014 can be explained by an EXor-like outburst, the recovery from a long\nduration eclipse event caused by obscuring circumstellar dust, or by the\ngradual removal of extincting material from along the line of sight. Our\nanalysis here favors one of the extinction scenarios.\n", "  Bloch oscillations of spatio-temporal light wave packets in arrays of\nnonlinear fibers with high-order dispersion are studied. The light wave\nexperiences discrete spatial diffraction along the waveguide array coordinate\ntogether with continuous temporal dispersion including higher order terms. When\na gradient in the waveguide light confinement strength is considered, the wave\npacket features robust long-lived Bloch oscillations with temporal and spatial\nspreading in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity. The effect of the spatial\nBloch oscillations on the emission of the dispersive radiation by the solitary\nwave is studied. It is shown that Bloch oscillations result in the generation\nof new frequencies. The condition of resonant emission of dispersive waves is\nderived and it is demonstrated that it matches very well with the results of\ndirect numerical simulations.\n", "  Recent observations confirm the existence of ultra-massive black holes (UMBH)\nin the nuclei of compact galaxies, with physical properties similar to NGC\n1277. The nature of these objects poses a new puzzle to the `black hole-host\ngalaxy co-evolution' scenario. We discuss the potential link between UMBH and\ngalaxy compactness, possibly connected via extreme active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) feedback at early times ($z > 2$). In our picture, AGN feedback is driven\nby radiation pressure on dust. We suggest that early UMBH feedback blows away\nall the gas beyond a $\\sim$kpc or so, while triggering star formation at inner\nradii, eventually leaving a compact galaxy remnant. Such extreme UMBH feedback\ncan also affect the surrounding environment on larger scales, e.g. the\noutflowing stars may form a diffuse stellar halo around the compact galaxy, or\neven escape into the intergalactic or intracluster medium. On the other hand,\nless massive black holes will drive less powerful feedback, such that the stars\nformed within the AGN feedback-driven outflow remain bound to the host galaxy,\nand contribute to its size growth over cosmic time.\n", "  We perform a reflection study on a new observation of the neutron star\nlow-mass X-ray binary Aquila X-1 taken with NuSTAR during the August 2016\noutburst and compare with the July 2014 outburst. The source was captured at\n$\\sim32\\%\\ L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$, which is over four times more luminous than the\nprevious observation during the 2014 outburst. Both observations exhibit a\nbroadened Fe line profile. Through reflection modeling, we determine that the\ninner disk is truncated $R_{in,\\ 2016}=11_{-1}^{+2}\\ R_{g}$ (where\n$R_{g}=GM/c^{2}$) and $R_{in,\\ 2014}=14\\pm2\\ R_{g}$ (errors quoted at the 90%\nconfidence level). Fiducial neutron star parameters (M$_{NS}=1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$,\n$R_{NS}=10$ km) give a stellar radius of $R_{NS}=4.85\\ R_{g}$; our measurements\nrule out a disk extending to that radius at more than the $6\\sigma$ level of\nconfidence. We are able to place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength\nof $B\\leq3.0-4.5\\times10^{9}$ G at the magnetic poles, assuming that the disk\nis truncated at the magnetospheric radius in each case. This is consistent with\nprevious estimates of the magnetic field strength for Aquila X-1. However, if\nthe magnetosphere is not responsible for truncating the disk prior to the\nneutron star surface, we estimate a boundary layer with a maximum extent of\n$R_{BL,\\ 2016}\\sim10\\ R_{g}$ and $R_{BL,\\ 2014}\\sim6\\ R_{g}$. Additionally, we\ncompare the magnetic field strength inferred from the Fe line profile of Aquila\nX-1 and other neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries to known accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars.\n", "  Partial differential equations for the electric potential at finite\ntemperature, taking into account the thermal Euler-Heisenberg contribution to\nthe electromagnetic Lagrangian are derived. This complete temperature\ndependence introduces quantum corrections to several well known equations such\nas the Thomas-Fermi and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Our unified approach\nallows at the same time to derive other similar equations which take into\naccount the effect of the surrounding heat bath on electric fields. We vary our\napproach by considering a neutral plasma as well as the screening caused by\nelectrons only. The effects of changing the statistics from Fermi-Dirac to the\nTsallis statistics and including the presence of a magnetic field are also\ninvestigated. Some useful applications of the above formalism are presented.\n", "  Some exact, nonlinear, vacuum gravitational wave solutions are derived for\ncertain polynomial $f(R)$ gravities. We show that the boundaries of the\ngravitational domain of dependence, associated with events in polynomial $f(R)$\ngravity, are not null as they are in general relativity. The implication is\nthat electromagnetic and gravitational causality separate into distinct notions\nin modified gravity, which may have observable astrophysical consequences. The\nlinear theory predicts that tachyonic instabilities occur, when the quadratic\ncoefficient $a_{2}$ of the Taylor expansion of $f(R)$ is negative, while the\nexact, nonlinear, cylindrical wave solutions presented here can be superluminal\nfor all values of $a_{2}$. Anisotropic solutions are found, whose wave-fronts\ntrace out time- or space-like hypersurfaces with complicated geometric\nproperties. We show that the solutions exist in $f(R)$ theories that are\nconsistent with Solar System and pulsar timing experiments.\n", "  The recent synthesis of two-dimensional staggered materials opens up\nburgeoning opportunities to study optical spin-orbit interactions in\nsemiconducting Dirac-like systems. We unveil topological phase transitions in\nthe photonic spin Hall effect in the graphene family materials. It is shown\nthat an external static electric field and a high frequency circularly\npolarized laser allow for active on-demand manipulation of electromagnetic beam\nshifts. The spin Hall effect of light presents a rich dependence with radiation\ndegrees of freedom, material properties, and features non-trivial topological\nproperties. We discover that photonic Hall shifts are sensitive to spin and\nvalley properties of the charge carries, providing a unprecedented pathway to\ninvestigate spintronics and valleytronics in staggered 2D semiconductors.\n", "  We propose a mechanism of state transition in wind-fed black hole binaries\n(high-mass X-ray binaries) such as Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1. Modeling a line-driven\nstellar wind from the companion by two-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations,\nwe investigate the processes of wind capture by and accretion onto the black\nhole. We assume that the wind acceleration is terminated at the He II\nionization front because ions responsible for line-driven acceleration are\nionized within the front, i.e. He III region. It is found that the mass\naccretion rate inferred from the luminosity is remarkably smaller than the\ncapture rate. Considering the difference, we construct a model for the state\ntransition based on the accretion flow being controlled by magneto-rotational\ninstability. The outer flow is torus like, and plays an important role to\ntrigger the transition. The model can explain why state transition does occur\nin Cyg X-1, while not in LMC X-1. Cyg X-1 exhibits a relatively low luminosity,\nand then the He II ionization front is located and can move between the\ncompanion and black hole, depending on its ionizing photon flux. On the other\nhand, LMC X-1 exhibits too high luminosity for the front to move considerably;\nthe front is too close to the companion atmosphere. The model also predicts\nthat each state of high-soft or low-hard would last fairly long because the\nluminosity depends weakly on the wind velocity. In the context of the model,\nthe state transition is triggered by a fluctuation of the magnetic field when\nits amplitude becomes comparable to the field strength in the torus-like outer\nflow.\n", "  We present early-time Swift and Chandra X-ray data along with late-time\noptical and near-infrared observations of SN 2013by, a Type IIL supernova (SN)\nthat occurred in the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 138$-$G10 (D $\\sim 14.8$ Mpc).\nOptical and NIR photometry and spectroscopy follow the late-time evolution of\nthe supernova from days +89 to +457 post-maximum brightness. The optical\nspectra and X-ray light curves are consistent with the picture of a SN having\nprolonged interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) that accelerates the\ntransition from supernova to supernova remnant (SNR). Specifically, we find SN\n2013by's H$\\alpha$ profile exhibits significant broadening ($\\sim$ 10,000 km\ns$^{-1}$) on day +457, the likely consequence of high-velocity, H-rich material\nbeing excited by a reverse shock. A relatively flat X-ray light curve is\nobserved that cannot be modeled using inverse-Compton scattering processes\nalone but requires an additional energy source most likely originating from the\nSN-CSM interaction. In addition, we see the first overtone of CO emission near\n2.3 $\\mu$m on day +152, signaling the formation of molecules and dust in the SN\nejecta and is the first time CO has been detected in a Type IIL supernova. We\ncompare SN 2013by to Type IIP supernovae whose spectra show the rarely observed\nSN-to-SNR transition in varying degrees and conclude that Type IIL SNe may\nenter the remnant phase at earlier epochs than their Type IIP counterparts.\n", "  In the present work we study the branon dark matter particles impact on\ncompact objects, and we provide the first constraints of the parameter space\nusing white dwarf stars. The branon dark matter model is characterized by two\nfree parameters, namely the branon mass particle M and the brane tension factor\n$f$. The latter determines the strength of the interaction of branon dark\nmatter particles with baryons. By considering a typical white dwarf star we\nwere able to obtain constraints on branon dark matter and compare with current\nlimits obtained by direct detection searches and dark matter abundance. In\nparticular our results show that i) for heavy branons with a mass $M > 10 GeV$\nwhite dwarfs fail to provide us with bounds better than current limits from DM\ndirect detection searches, and ii) for light branons in the mass range $2 keV <\nM < 1 GeV$, which cannot be probed neither with current dark matter experiments\nnor with the next generation of detectors, the dark matter abundance constrain\ndetermines $f$ as a function of $M$ in the range $0.1 GeV < M < 1 GeV$ for the\nbranon mass and $1 GeV < f < 5 GeV$ for the brane tension factor. Furthermore,\nour findings indicate that the limits from white dwarfs are not stronger than\nthe dark matter abundance constrain.\n", "  Density perturbations in the cosmic microwave background within general\n$f(R,\\phi)$ models of gravity are investigated. The general dynamical equations\nfor the tensor and scalar modes in any $f(R,\\phi)$ gravity model are derived.\nAn application of the equations to the (varying power)-law modified gravity\ntoy-model is then made. Formulas and numerical values for the tensor-to-scalar\nratio, the scalar tilt and the tensor tilt are all obtained within this\nspecific model. While the model cannot provide a theoretical reason for the\nvalue of the energy scale at which inflation should occur, it is found, based\non the latest observations of the density perturbations in the sky, that the\nmodel requires inflation to occur at an energy scale less than the GUT-scale;\nnamely, $\\sim10^{14}\\,{\\rm GeV}$. The different energy intervals examined here\nshow that the density perturbations recently obtained from observations are\nrecovered naturally, with very high precision, and without fine tuning the\nmodel's parameters.\n", "  An alternative cooling approach to prevent rf breakdown in magnetic fields is\ndescribed that simultaneously reduces all six phase-space dimensions of a muon\nbeam. In this process, cooling is accomplished by reducing the beam momentum\nthrough ionization energy loss in discrete absorbers and replenishing the\nmomentum loss only in the longitudinal direction through gas-filled rf\ncavities. The advantage of gas filled cavities is that they can run at high\ngradients in magnetic fields without breakdown. With this approach, we show\nthat our channel can achieve a decrease of the 6-dimensional phase-space volume\nby several orders of magnitude. With the aid of numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the transmission of our proposed channel is comparable to that\nof an equivalent channel with vacuum rf cavities. Finally, we discuss the\nsensitivity of the channel performance to the choice of gas and operating\npressure.\n", "  It is known that statistical model selection as well as identification of\ndynamical equations from available data are both very challenging tasks.\nPhysical systems behave according to their underlying dynamical equations\nwhich, in turn, can be identified from experimental data. Explaining data\nrequires selecting mathematical models that best capture the data regularities.\nThe existence of fundamental links among physical systems, dynamical equations,\nexperimental data and statistical modeling motivate us to present in this\narticle our theoretical modeling scheme which combines information geometry and\ninductive inference methods to provide a probabilistic description of complex\nsystems in the presence of limited information. Special focus is devoted to\ndescribe the role of our entropic information geometric complexity measure. In\nparticular, we provide several illustrative examples wherein our modeling\nscheme is used to infer macroscopic predictions when only partial knowledge of\nthe microscopic nature of a given system is available. Finally, limitations,\npossible improvements, and future investigations are discussed.\n", "  Roles of paramagnetic and diamagnetic pair-breaking effects in\nsuperconductivity in electric-field-induced surface metallic state are studied\nby Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, when magnetic fields are applied parallel to\nthe surface. The multi-gap states of sub-bands are related to the depth\ndependence and the magnetic field dependence of superconductivity. In the\nFermi-energy density of states and the spin density, sub-band contributions\nsuccessively appear from higher-level sub-bands with increasing magnetic\nfields. The characteristic magnetic field dependence may be a key feature to\nidentify the multi-gap structure of the surface superconductivity.\n", "  As part of on an extensive data mining effort, we have compiled a database of\n162 Galactic rotation speed measurements at $R_0$ (the solar Galactocentric\ndistance), $\\Theta_0$. Published between 1927 and 2017 June, this represents\nthe most comprehensive set of $\\Theta_0$ values since the 1985 meta analysis\nthat led to the last revision of the International Astronomical Union's\nrecommended Galactic rotation constants. Although we do not find any compelling\nevidence of the presence of `publication bias' in recent decades, we find clear\ndifferences among the $\\Theta_0$ values and the $\\Theta_0/R_0$ ratios resulting\nfrom the use of different tracer populations. Specifically, young tracers\n(including OB and supergiant stars, masers, Cepheid variables, H{\\sc ii}\nregions, and young open clusters), as well as kinematic measurements of Sgr A*\nnear the Galactic Center, imply a significantly larger Galactic rotation speed\nat the solar circle and a higher $\\Theta_0/R_0$ ratio (i.e., $\\Theta_0 = 247\n\\pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\\Theta_0/R_0 = 29.81 \\pm 0.32$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$;\nstatistical uncertainties only) than any of the tracers dominating the Galaxy's\nmass budget (i.e., field stars and the H{\\sc i}/CO distributions). Using the\nlatter as most representative of the bulk of the Galaxy's matter distribution,\nwe arrive at an updated set of Galactic rotation constants, $\\Theta_0 = 225 \\pm\n3 \\mbox{ (statistical)} \\pm 10 \\mbox{ (systematic) km s}^{-1}$, $R_0 = 8.3 \\pm\n0.2 \\mbox{ (statistical)} \\pm 0.4 \\mbox{ (systematic) kpc}$, and $\\Theta_0 /\nR_0 = 27.12 \\pm 0.39 \\mbox{ (statistical)} \\pm 1.78 \\mbox{ (systematic) km\ns}^{-1} \\mbox{ kpc}^{-1}$.\n", "  We report on a single-crystal neutron diffraction study of the evolution of\nthe antiferromagnetic order in the heavy-fermion compound CePd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$Al\nwhich exhibits partial geometric frustration due to its distorted Kagom\\'e\nstructure. The magnetic structure is found to be unchanged with a propagation\nvector $Q_\\mathrm{AF} \\approx (0.5~0~0.35)$ for all Ni concentrations $x$ up to\n$x_c \\approx 0.14$. Upon approaching the quantum critical concentration $x_c$,\nthe ordered moment vanishes linearly with N\\'eel temperature $T_{\\rm N}$, in\ngood agreement with CePdAl under hydrostatic pressure. For all Ni\nconcentrations, substantial short-range magnetic correlations are observed\nabove $T_{\\rm N}$ as a result of frustration.\n", "  Recently, magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetized electrodes\ncombined with exchange bias films have attracted large interest. In this paper\nwe examine the tunnel magnetoresistance of\nTa/Pd/IrMn/Co-Fe/Ta/Co-Fe-B/MgO/Co-Fe-B/capping/Pd magnetic tunnel junctions in\ndependence on the capping layer, i.e., Hf or Ta. In these stacks perpendicular\nexchange bias fields of -500\\,Oe along with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nare combined. A tunnel magnetoresistance of $(47.2\\pm 1.4)\\%$ for the Hf-capped\nsample was determined compared to the Ta one $(42.6\\pm 0.7)\\%$ at room\ntemperature. Interestingly, this observation is correlated to the higher boron\nabsorption of Hf compared to Ta which prevents the suppression of\n$\\Delta_{\\textrm{1}}$ channel and leads to higher tunnel magnetoresistance\nvalues. Furthermore, the temperature dependent coercivities of the soft\nelectrodes of both samples are mainly described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model\nincluding thermal fluctuations. Slight deviations at low temperatures can be\nattributed to a torque on the soft electrode that is generated by the pinned\nmagnetic layer system.\n", "  At the triple point of a repulsive screened Coulomb system, a\nface-centered-cubic (fcc) crystal, a body-centered-cubic (bcc) crystal and a\nfluid phase coexist. At their intersection, these three phases form a liquid\ngroove, the triple junction. Using confocal microscopy, we resolve the triple\njunction on a single particle level in a model system of charged PMMA colloids\nin a nonpolar solvent. The groove is found to be extremely deep and the\nincommensurate solid-solid interface to be very broad. Thermal fluctuations\nhence appear to dominate the solid-solid interface. This indicates a very low\ninterfacial energy. The fcc-bcc interfacial energy is quantitatively determined\nbased on Young's equation and, indeed, it is only about 1.3 times higher than\nthe fcc-fluid interfacial energy close to the triple point.\n", "  Hydrogen diffusion on metals exhibits rich quantum behavior, which is not yet\nfully understood. Using simulations, we show that many hydrogen diffusion\nbarriers can be categorized into those with \"parabolic-tops\" and those with\n\"broad-tops\". With parabolic-top barriers, hydrogen diffusion evolves gradually\nfrom classical hopping to shallow tunneling to deep tunneling as the\ntemperature decreases, and noticeable quantum effects persist at moderate\ntemperatures. In contrast, with broad-top barriers quantum effects become\nimportant only at low temperatures and the classical to quantum transition is\nsharp, at which classical hopping and deep tunneling both occur. This\ncoexistence indicates that more than one mechanism contributes to the quantum\nreaction rate. The conventional definition of the classical to quantum\ncrossover temperature is invalid for the broad-tops, and we give a new\ndefinition. Extending this we propose a model to predict the transition\ntemperature for broad-top diffusion, providing a general guide for theory and\nexperiment.\n", "  We introduce quantum sensing protocol for detection spatially varying fields\nby using two coupled harmonic oscillators as a quantum probe. We discuss a\nphysical implementation of the sensing technique with two trapped ions coupled\nvia Coulomb mediated phonon hopping. Our method relies on using the coupling\nbetween the localized ion oscillations and the internal states of the trapped\nions which allows to measure spatially varying electric and magnetic fields.\nFirst we discuss an adiabatic sensing technique which is capable to detect a\nvery small force difference simply by measuring the ion spin population. We\nalso show that the adiabatic method can be used for detection magnetic field\ngradient which is independent of the magnetic offset. Second, we show that the\nstrong spin phonon coupling could leads to improve sensitivity to force as well\nas to phase estimations. We quantify the sensitivity in terms of quantum Fisher\ninformation and show that it diverges by approaching the critical coupling.\n", "  Almost since the beginning, massive stars and their resultant supernovae have\nplayed a crucial role in the Universe. These objects produce tremendous amounts\nof energy and new, heavy elements that enrich galaxies, encourage new stars to\nform and sculpt the shapes of galaxies we see today. The end of millions of\nyears of massive star evolution and the beginning of hundreds or thousands of\nyears of supernova evolution are separated by a matter of a few seconds, in\nwhich some of the most extreme physics found in the Universe causes the\nexplosive and terminal disruption of the star. Key questions remain unanswered\nin both the studies of how massive stars evolve and the behaviour of\nsupernovae, and it appears the solutions may not lie on just one side of the\nexplosion or the other or in just the domain of the stellar evolution or the\nsupernova astrophysics communities. The need to view massive star evolution and\nsupernovae as continuous phases in a single narrative motivated the Theo Murphy\ninternational scientific meeting \"Bridging the gap: from massive stars to\nsupernovae\" at Chicheley Hall in June 2016, with the specific purpose to\nsimultaneously address the scientific connections between theoretical and\nobservational studies of massive stars and their supernovae, through engaging\nastronomers from both communities.\n", "  We analyze a detailed Nice model simulation of Kuiper Belt emplacement from\nBrasser & Morbidelli (2013), where Neptune undergoes a high eccentricity phase\nand migrates outward. In this work, which follows from Pike et al. (2017), we\nspecifically focus on the details of structures within Neptune's mean motion\nresonances and in the high pericenter population of simulated trans-Neptunian\nObjects (TNOs). We find several characteristics of these populations which\nshould be observable in the distant Solar System in future large-scale TNO\nsurveys as a diagnostic of whether or not this mode of Neptune migration\noccurred in the early Solar System. We find that the leading asymmetric\nlibration islands of the $n$:1 resonances are generally much more populated\nthan the trailing islands. We also find the non-resonant high-$q$ population of\nTNOs should have higher inclinations than the low-$q$ population due to the\nimportance of Kozai cycling during their emplacement histories. Finally,\nhigh-$q$ TNOs should be present in roughly equal numbers on either side of\ndistant mean-motion resonances. These predictions contrast with predictions\nfrom other Kuiper Belt emplacement simulations, and will be testable by\nupcoming surveys.\n", "  The total and angular differential cross sections of the coherent process\n$\\bar p + {}^AZ \\to {}^A_\\Lambda(Z-1) + \\bar{\\Lambda}$ are evaluated at the\nbeam momenta $1.5\\div20$ GeV/c within the meson exchange model with bound\nproton and $\\Lambda$-hyperon wave functions. It is shown that the shape of the\nbeam momentum dependence of the hypernucleus production cross sections with\nvarious discrete $\\Lambda$ states is strongly sensitive to the presence of the\nscalar $\\kappa$-meson exchange in the $\\bar p p \\to \\bar\\Lambda \\Lambda$\namplitude. This can be used as a clean test of the exchange by scalar $\\pi K$\ncorrelation in coherent $\\bar p A$ reactions.\n", "  By means of a multiband effective mass Hamiltonian, a theoretical\ncharacterization of the effect of the geometrical features of the confinement\nprofile --in particular, a longitudinal groove-- on the subbands dispersion and\nspin-related properties of a rectangular HgTe/CdTe nanowire is presented.\nThrough an external electric field applied perpendicular to the wire, the\ninterplay of the induced Rashba spin splitting and these geometrical features\nis investigated. It is found that by exploiting this interplay a rich\ncomplexity of the subband structure arises, permitting the generation and\nmodulation of spin-polarized currents without magnetic fields.\n", "  The L\\'evy walk process with rests is discussed. The jumping time is governed\nby an $\\alpha$-stable distribution with $\\alpha>1$ while a waiting time\ndistribution is Poissonian and involves a position-dependent rate which\nreflects a nonhomogeneous trap distribution. The master equation is derived and\nsolved in the asymptotic limit for a power-law form of the jumping rate. The\nrelative density of resting and flying particles appears time-dependent and the\nasymptotic form of both distribution obey a stretched-exponential shape at\nlarge time. The diffusion properties are discussed and it is demonstrated that,\ndue to the heterogeneous trap structure, the enhanced diffusion, observed for\nthe homogeneous case, may turn to a subdiffusion. The density distributions and\nmean squared displacements are also evaluated from Monte Carlo simulations of\nindividual trajectories.\n", "  Detailed modeling of stellar evolution requires a better understanding of the\n(magneto-)hydrodynamic processes which mix chemical elements and transport\nangular momentum. Understanding these pro- cesses is crucial if we are to\naccurately interpret observations of chemical abundance anomalies, surface\nrotation measurements and asteroseismic data. Here, we use two-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simula- tions of the generation and propagation of internal\ngravity waves (IGW) in an intermediate mass star to measure the chemical mixing\ninduced by these waves. We show that such mixing can generally be treated as a\ndiffusive process. We then show that the local diffusion coefficient does not\ndepend on the local fluid velocity, but rather on the wave amplitude. We then\nuse these findings to provide a simple parametrization for this diffusion which\ncan be incorporated into stellar evolution codes and tested against\nobservations.\n", "  We report the occurrence of reentrant metallic behavior in the Weyl semimetal\nNbP. When the applied magnetic field $H$ is above a critical value $H_c$, a\nreentrance appears as a peak in the temperature dependent resistivity\n$\\rho_{xx}(T)$ at $T$ = $T_p$, similar to that observed in graphite where it\nwas attributed to local superconductivity. The $T_p(H)$ relationship follows a\npower-law dependence $T_p\\sim(H-H_c)^{1/v}$ where $v$ can be derived from the\ntemperature dependence of the zero-field resistivity $\\rho_0(T) \\sim T^v$. From\nconcurrent measurements of the transverse $\\rho_{xx}(T)$ and Hall\n$\\rho_{xy}(T)$ magnetoresistivities, we reveal a clear correlation between the\nrapidly increasing $\\rho_{xy}(T)$ and the occurrence of a peak in the\n$\\rho_{xx}(T)$ curve. Quantitative analysis indicates that the reentrant\nmetallic behavior arises from the competition of the magneto conductivity\n$\\sigma_{xx}(T)$ with an additional component\n$\\Delta\\sigma_{xx}(T)=\\kappa_H\\sigma_{xx}(T)$ where\n$\\kappa_H=[\\rho_{xy}(T)/\\rho_{xx}(T)]^2$ is the Hall factor. We find that the\nHall factor ($\\kappa_H \\approx 0.4$) at peak temperature $T_p$ is nearly\nfield-independent, leading to the observed $T_p(H)$ relationship. Furthermore,\nthe reentrant metallic behavior in $\\rho_{xx}(T)$ also is reflected in the\nbehavior of $\\rho_{xx}(H)$ that ranges from non-saturating at $T>70$ K to\nsaturation at liquid helium temperatures. The latter can be explained with the\nmagnetic field dependence of the Hall factor $\\kappa_H(H)$. Our studies\ndemonstrate that a semiclassical theory can account for the 'anomalies' in the\nmagnetotransport phenomena of NbP without invoking an exotic mechanism.\n", "  We build on a long-standing tradition in astronomical adaptive optics (AO) of\nspecifying performance metrics and error budgets using linear systems modeling\nin the spatial-frequency domain. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive tool\nfor the calculation of error budgets in terms of residual temporally filtered\nphase power spectral densities and variances. In addition, the fast simulation\nof AO-corrected point spread functions (PSFs) provided by this method can be\nused as inputs for simulations of science observations with next-generation\ninstruments and telescopes, in particular to predict post-coronagraphic\ncontrast improvements for planet finder systems. We extend the previous results\nand propose the synthesis of a distributed Kalman filter to mitigate both\naniso-servo-lag and aliasing errors whilst minimizing the overall residual\nvariance. We discuss applications to (i) analytic AO-corrected PSF modeling in\nthe spatial-frequency domain, (ii) post-coronagraphic contrast enhancement,\n(iii) filter optimization for real-time wavefront reconstruction, and (iv) PSF\nreconstruction from system telemetry. Under perfect knowledge of wind\nvelocities, we show that $\\sim$60 nm rms error reduction can be achieved with\nthe distributed Kalman filter embodying anti- aliasing reconstructors on 10 m\nclass high-order AO systems, leading to contrast improvement factors of up to\nthree orders of magnitude at few ${\\lambda}/D$ separations\n($\\sim1-5{\\lambda}/D$) for a 0 magnitude star and reaching close to one order\nof magnitude for a 12 magnitude star.\n", "  We examine the linear stability of an isothermal filamentary cloud permeated\nby a perpendicular magnetic field. Our model cloud is assumed to be supported\nby gas pressure against the self-gravity in the unperturbed state. For\nsimplicity, the density distribution is assumed to be symmetric around the\naxis. Also for simplicity, the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform\nand turbulence is not taken into account. The perturbation equation is\nformulated to be an eigenvalue problem. The growth rate is obtained as a\nfunction of the wavenumber for fragmentation along the axis and the magnetic\nfield strength. The growth rate depends critically on the outer boundary. If\nthe displacement vanishes in the region very far from the cloud axis (fixed\nboundary), cloud fragmentation is suppressed by a moderate magnetic field,\nwhich means the plasma beta is below 1.67 on the cloud axis. If the\ndisplacement is constant along the magnetic field in the region very far from\nthe cloud, the cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is infinitely\nstrong. The cloud is deformed by circulation in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. The unstable mode is not likely to induce dynamical collapse,\nsince it is excited even when the whole cloud is magnetically subcritical. For\nboth the boundary conditions the magnetic field increases the wavelength of the\nmost unstable mode. We find that the magnetic force suppresses compression\nperpendicular to the magnetic field especially in the region of low density.\n", "  A density functional of fundamental measure type for a lattice model of\nanisotropic particles with hard-core repulsions and effective attractions is\nderived in the spirit of the Asakura-Oosawa model. Through polymeric lattice\nparticles of various size and shape, effective attractions of different\nstrength and range between the colloids can be generated. The functional is\napplied to the determination of phase diagrams for sticky rods of length $L$ in\ntwo dimensions, in three dimensions and in a monolayer system on a neutral\nsubstrate. In all cases, there is a competition between ordering and gas-liquid\ntransitions. In two dimensions, this gives rise to a tricritical point, whereas\nin three dimensions, the isotropic-nematic transition crosses over smoothly to\na gas-nematic liquid transition. The richest phase behavior is found for the\nmonolayer system. For $L = 2$, two stable critical points are found\ncorresponding to a standard gas-liquid transition and a nematic liquid-liquid\ntransition. For $L = 3$, the gas-liquid transition becomes metastable.\n", "  Studies have shown that UV/optical light curves of quasars can be described\nwith the prevalent damped random walk (DRW, also known as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess) model. A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable. Meanwhile, quasars show too large scatter in their DRW parameters to\nbe attributed to the uncertainties in the measurements and the dependence of\nvariation to known physical factors. In this work we present simulations\nshowing that, if the low frequency PSD deviates from DRW, the red noise leakage\ncan naturally produce large scatter in variation parameters measured from\nsimulated light curves. The steeper the low frequency PSD slope is, the larger\nscatter we expect. Based on the observations of SDSS Stripe 82 quasars, we find\nthe low frequency PSD slope should be no steeper than -1.3. The actual slope\ncould be flatter, which consequently requires that quasar variabilities should\nbe influenced by other unknown factors. We speculate that magnetic field and/or\nmetallicity could be such additional factors.\n", "  The manner in which transport properties vary over the entire parameter-space\nof coupling and magnetization strength is explored for the first time. Four\nregimes are identified based on the relative size of the gyroradius compared to\nother fundamental length scales: the collision mean free path, Debye length,\ndistance of closest approach and interparticle spacing. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations of self-diffusion and temperature anisotropy relaxation spanning\nthe parameter space are found to agree well with the predicted boundaries.\nComparison with existing theories reveals regimes where they succeed, where\nthey fail, and where no theory has yet been developed.\n", "  Ductile fracture through void growth and coalescence depends significantly on\nthe plastic anisotropy of the material and on void size, as shown by\nexperiments and/or numerical simulations through several studies. Macroscopic\n(homogenized) yield criteria aiming at modeling nanoporous materials have been\nproposed only for the growth regime, i.e. non-interacting voids. The aim of\nthis study is thus to provide a yield criterion for nanoporous materials\nrelevant for the coalescence regime, i.e. when plastic flow is localized\nbetween voids. Through homogenization and limit analysis, and accounting for\ninterface stresses at the void-matrix interface, analytical coalescence\ncriterion is derived under the following conditions: axisymmetric loading,\northotropic material obeying Hill's plasticity, cylindrical voids in\ncylindrical unit-cell. Incidentally, an orthotropic extension of the existing\nisotropic modeling of interface stresses through limit analysis is described\nand used. The proposed coalescence criterion is then extended to account for\ncombined tension and shear loading conditions. Numerical limit analyses have\nbeen performed under specific conditions / materials parameters to get\nsupposedly exact (up to numerical errors) results of coalescence stress. A good\nagreement between the analytical coalescence criteria derived in this study and\nnumerical results is found for elongated spheroidal voids, making them usable\nto predict the onset of void coalescence in ductile fracture modeling of\nnanoporous materials.\n", "  Magnetization reversal of interconnected Kagome artificial spin ice was\nstudied by the first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique based on the\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetoresistance measurements. The\nmagnetization reversal exhibits a distinct six-fold symmetry with the external\nfield orientation. When the field is parallel to one of the nano-bar branches,\nthe domain nucleation/propagation and annihilation processes sensitively depend\non the field cycling history and the maximum field applied. When the field is\nnearly perpendicular to one of the branches, the FORC measurement reveals the\nmagnetic interaction between the Dirac strings and orthogonal branches during\nthe magnetization reversal process. Our results demonstrate that the FORC\napproach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the magnetic\ninteraction in the magnetization reversal processes of spin-frustrated systems.\n", "  Topological defects in magnetism have attracted great attention due to\nfundamental research interests and potential novel spintronics applications.\nRich examples of topological defects can be found in nanoscale non-uniform spin\ntextures, such as monopoles, domain walls, vortices, and skyrmions. Recently,\nskyrmions stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction have been studied\nextensively. However, the stabilization of antiskyrmions is less\nstraightforward. Here, using numerical simulations we demonstrate that\nantiskyrmions can be a stable spin configuration in the presence of anisotropic\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find current-driven antiskyrmion motion\nthat has a transverse component, namely antiskyrmion Hall effect. The\nantiskyrmion gyroconstant is opposite to that for skyrmion, which allows the\ncurrent-driven propagation of coupled skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs without\napparent skyrmion Hall effect. The antiskyrmion Hall angle strongly depends on\nthe current direction, and a zero antiskyrmion Hall angle can be achieved at a\ncritic current direction. These results open up possibilities to tailor the\nspin topology in nanoscale magnetism, which may be useful in the emerging field\nof skyrmionics.\n", "  Transmission spectroscopy provides a window to study exoplanetary\natmospheres, but that window is fogged by clouds and hazes. Clouds and haze\nintroduce a degeneracy between the strength of gaseous absorption features and\nplanetary physical parameters such as abundances. One way to break that\ndegeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published HST/WFC3\ntransit spectra for 1.1-1.65 $\\mu$m water vapor absorption, and perform a\nstatistical study on potential correlations between the water absorption\nfeature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template\ncalculated for each planet using the Exo-Transmit code. We express the\nmagnitude of the water absorption in scale heights, thereby removing the known\ndependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find\nthat the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with\nplanetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud\ncondensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline\nslope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the\nsense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile\nthe distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this\ndistribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that\nthe distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is\nsimilarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by\nobservational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample\nof the hottest planets.\n", "  We consider the Fermi polaron problem at zero temperature, where a single\nimpurity interacts with non-interacting host fermions. We approach the problem\nstarting with a Frohlich-like Hamiltonian where the impurity is described with\ncanonical position and momentum operators. We apply the Lee-Low-Pine (LLP)\ntransformation to change the fermionic Frohlich Hamiltonian into the fermionic\nLLP Hamiltonian which describes a many-body system containing host fermions\nonly. We adapt the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) approach, first proposed\nby Edwards, to the fermionic LLP Hamiltonian in which a pair of host fermions\nwith momenta $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{k}'$ interact with a potential\nproportional to $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}'$. We apply the HF theory, which has\nthe advantage of not restricting the number of particle-hole pairs, to\nrepulsive Fermi polarons in one dimension. When the impurity and host fermion\nmasses are equal our variational ansatz, where HF orbitals are expanded in\nterms of free-particle states, produces results in excellent agreement with\nMcGuire's exact analytical results based on the Bethe ansatz. This work raises\nthe prospect of using the HF ansatz and its time-dependent generalization as\nbuilding blocks for developing all-coupling theories for both equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium Fermi polarons in higher dimensions\n", "  The formation epoch of protostellar disks is debated because of the competing\nroles of rotation, turbulence, and magnetic fields in the early stages of\nlow-mass star formation. Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of collapsing cores\npredict that rotationally supported disks may form in strongly magnetized cores\nthrough ambipolar diffusion or misalignment between the rotation axis and the\nmagnetic field orientation. Detailed studies of individual sources are needed\nto cross check the theoretical predictions. We present 0.06-0.1\" resolution\nimages at 350 GHz toward B1b-N and B1b-S, which are young class 0 protostars,\npossibly first hydrostatic cores. The images have been obtained with ALMA, and\nwe compare these data with magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a collapsing\nturbulent and magnetized core. The submillimeter continuum emission is\nspatially resolved by ALMA. Compact structures with optically thick 350 GHz\nemission are detected toward both B1b-N and B1b-S, with 0.2 and 0.35\" radii (46\nand 80 au at the Perseus distance of 230 pc), within a more extended envelope.\nThe flux ratio between the compact structure and the envelope is lower in B1b-N\nthan in B1b-S, in agreement with its earlier evolutionary status. The size and\norientation of the compact structure are consistent with 0.2\" resolution 32 GHz\nobservations obtained with the Very Large Array as a part of the VANDAM survey,\nsuggesting that grains have grown through coagulation. The morphology,\ntemperature, and densities of the compact structures are consistent with those\nof disks formed in numerical simulations of collapsing cores. Moreover, the\nproperties of B1b-N are consistent with those of a very young protostar,\npossibly a first hydrostatic core. These observations provide support for the\nearly formation of disks around low-mass protostars.\n", "  To reflect the asymptotic freedom in the thermal direction, a\ntemperature-dependent coupling was proposed in the literature. We investigate\nits effect on QCD matter with and without strong magnetic fields. Compared with\nthe fixed coupling constant, the running coupling leads to a drastic change in\nthe dynamical quark mass, entropy density, sound velocity, and specific heat.\nThe crossover transition of QCD matter at finite temperature is characterized\nby the pseudocritical temperature $T_\\mathrm{pc}$, which is generally\ndetermined by the peak of the derivative of the quark condensate with respect\nto the temperature $d\\phi/dT$, or equivalently, by the derivative of the quark\ndynamical mass $d M/dT$. In a strong magnetic field, the temperature- and\nmagnetic-field-dependent coupling $G(eB,T)$ was recently introduced to account\nfor inverse magnetic catalysis. We propose an analytical relation between the\ntwo criteria $d\\phi/dT$ and $dM/dT$ and show a discrepancy between them in\nfinding the pseudocritical temperature. The magnitude of the discrepancy\ndepends on the behavior of $dG/dT$.\n", "  Seismic maps of the Sun's far hemisphere, computed from Doppler data from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) are now being used routinely to detect strong magnetic regions on the far\nside of the Sun (http:/jsoc.stanford.edu/data/farside/). To test the\nreliability of this technique, the helioseismically inferred active region\ndetections are compared with far-side observation of solar activity from the\nSolar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), using brightness in extreme\nultraviolet light (EUV) as a proxy for magnetic fields. Two approaches are used\nto analyze nine months of STEREO and HMI data. In the first approach, we\ndetermine whether or not new large east-limb active regions are detected\nseismically on the far side before they appear Earth side and study how the\ndetectability of these regions relates to their EUV intensity. We find that,\nwhile there is a range of EUV intensities for which far-side regions may or may\nnot be detected seismically, there appears to be an intensity level above which\nthey are almost always detected and an intensity level below which they are\nnever detected. In the second approach, we analyze concurrent extreme\nultraviolet and helioseismic far-side observations. We find that 100% (22) of\nthe far-side seismic regions correspond to an extreme ultraviolet plage; 95% of\nthese either became a NOAA-designated magnetic region when reaching the east\nlimb or were one before crossing to the far side. A low but significant\ncorrelation is found between the seismic signature strength and the EUV\nintensity of a farside region.\n", "  We report on an optical frequency comb with 14nm (~1.8 THz) spectral\nbandwidth at -3 dB level that is generated using a passively mode-locked\nquantum-well (QW) laser in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) fabricated\nthrough an InP generic photonic integration technology platform. This 21.5-GHz\ncolliding-pulse mode-locked laser cavity is defined by on-chip reflectors\nincorporating intracavity phase modulators followed by an extra-cavity SOA as\nbooster amplifier. A 1.8-THz-wide optical comb spectrum is presented with\nultrafast pulse that is 0.35-ps-wide. The radio frequency beat note has a 3-dB\nlinewidth of 450 kHz and 35-dB SNR.\n", "  We numerically solved the boundary-value problem for Tamm waves (which may\nalso be classified as Uller-Zenneck waves here) guided by the planar interface\nof a homogeneous isotropic dissipative dielectric (HIDD) material and a\nperiodically multilayered isotropic dielectric material. The HIDD material was\nchosen to be VO${}_2$ which, at optical wavelengths, has a\ntemperature-dependent refractive index with a hysteresis feature, i.e., the\ntemperature-dependence of its refractive index varies depending upon whether\nthe temperature is increasing or decreasing. A numerical code was implemented\nto extract solutions of the dispersion equation at a fixed wavelength for both\n$p$- and $s$-polarization states over the temperature range [50,80] degrees. A\nmultitude of Tamm waves of both linear polarization states were found,\ndemonstrating a clear demarcation of the heating and cooling phases in terms of\nwavenumbers and propagation distances. Thereby, the signatures of thermal\nhysteresis in Tamm-wave propagation were revealed.\n", "  Aims. We aimed at investigating the structure and kinematics of the gaseous\ndisk and outflows around the massive YSO S255 NIRS3 in the S255IR-SMA1 dense\nclump. Methods. Observations of the S255IR region were carried out with ALMA at\ntwo epochs in the compact and extended configurations. Results. We\nserendipitously detected a new, never predicted, bright maser line at about\n349.1 GHz, which most probably represents the CH$_3$OH $14_{1} - 14_{0}$ A$^{-\n+}$ transition. The emission covers most of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission\narea of almost 1$^{\\prime\\prime}$ in size and shows a velocity gradient in the\nsame sense as the disk rotation. No variability was found on the time interval\nof several months. It is classified as Class II maser and probably originates\nin a ring at a distance of several hundreds AU from the central star.\n", "  Recently, the study of the influence of solar activity on the Earth's climate\nreceived strong attention, mainly due to the possibility, proposed by several\nauthors, that global warming is not anthropogenic, but is due to an increase in\nsolar activity. Although this possibility has been ruled out, there are strong\nevidences that solar variability has an influence on Earth's climate, in\nregional scales.\n  Here we review some of these evidences, focusing in a particular aspect of\nclimate: atmospheric moisture and related quantities like precipitation. In\nparticular, we studied the influence of activity on South American\nprecipitations during centuries. First, we analyzed the stream flow of the\nParan\\'a and other rivers of the region, and found a very strong correlation\nwith Sunspot Number in decadal time scales. We found a similar correlation\nbetween Sunspot Number and tree-ring chronologies, which allows us to extend\nour study to cover the last two centuries.\n", "  The star V766 Cen (=HR 5171A) was originally classified as a yellow\nhypergiant but lately found to more likely be a 27-36 Msun red supergiant\n(RSG). Recent observations indicated a close eclipsing companion in the contact\nor common-envelope phase. Here, we aim at imaging observations of V766 Cen to\nconfirm the presence of the close companion. We used near-infrared H -band\naperture synthesis imaging at three epochs in 2014, 2016, and 2017, employing\nthe PIONIER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The\nvisibility data indicate a mean Rosseland angular diameter of 4.1+/-0.8 mas,\ncorresponding to a radius of 1575+/-400 Rsun. The data show an extended shell\n(MOLsphere) of about 2.5 times the Rosseland diameter, which contributes about\n30% of the H-band flux. The reconstructed images at the 2014 epoch show a\ncomplex elongated structure within the photospheric disk with a contrast of\nabout 10%. The second and third epochs show qualitatively and quantitatively\ndifferent structures with a single very bright and narrow feature and high\ncontrasts of 20-30%. This feature is located toward the south-western limb of\nthe photospheric stellar disk. We estimate an angular size of the feature of\n1.7+/-0.3 mas, corresponding to a radius of 650+/-150 Rsun, and giving a radius\nratio of 0.42+0.35/-0.10} compared to the primary stellar disk. We interpret\nthe images at the 2016 and 2017 epochs as showing the close companion, or a\ncommon envelope toward the companion, in front of the primary. At the 2014\nepoch, the close companion is behind the primary and not visible. Instead, the\nstructure and contrast at the 2014 epoch are typical of a single RSG harboring\ngiant photospheric convection cells. The companion is most likely a cool giant\nor supergiant star with a mass of 5+15/-3 Msun.\n", "  In this paper we perform Direct Statistical Simulations of a model of\ntwo-dimensional flow that exhibits a transition from jets to vortices. The\nmodel employs two-scale Kolmogorov forcing, with energy injected directly into\nthe zonal mean of the flow. We compare these results with those from Direct\nNumerical Simulations. For square domains the solution takes the form of jets,\nbut as the aspect ratio is increased a transition to isolated coherent vortices\nis found. We find that a truncation at second order in the equal-time but\nnonlocal cumulants that employs zonal averaging (zonal CE2) is capable of\ncapturing the form of the jets for a range of Reynolds numbers as well as the\ntransition to the vortex state, but, unsurprisingly, is unable to reproduce the\ncorrelations found for the fully nonlinear (non-zonally symmetric) vortex\nstate. This result continues the program of promising advances in statistical\ntheories of turbulence championed by Kraichnan.\n", "  The global survey of star clusters in the Milky Way (MWSC) is a comprehensive\nlist of 3061 objects that provides, among other parameters, distances to\nclusters based on isochrone fitting. The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)\ncatalogue, which is a part of Gaia data release 1 (Gaia DR1), delivers accurate\ntrigonometric parallax measurements for more than 2 million stars, including\nthose in star clusters. We compare the open cluster photometric distance scale\nwith the measurements given by the trigonometric parallaxes from TGAS to\nevaluate the consistency between these values. The average parallaxes of\nprobable cluster members available in TGAS provide the trigonometric distance\nscale of open clusters, while the photometric scale is given by the distances\npublished in the MWSC. Sixty-four clusters are suited for comparison as they\nhave more than 16 probable members with parallax measurements in TGAS. We\ncomputed the average parallaxes of the probable members and compared these to\nthe photometric parallaxes derived within the MWSC. We find a good agreement\nbetween the trigonometric TGAS-based and the photometric MWSC-based distance\nscales of open clusters, which for distances less than 2.3 kpc coincide at a\nlevel of about 0.1 mas with no dependence on the distance. If at all, there is\na slight systematic offset along the Galactic equator between $30^\\circ$ and\n$160^\\circ$ galactic longitude.\n", "  We investigate a class of cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous\n$\\Lambda$-dust spacetimes which have a regular axis and some zero expansion\ncomponent. For $\\Lambda\\ne 0$, we obtain new exact solutions to the Einstein\nequations and show that they are unique, within that class. For $\\Lambda=0$, we\nrecover the Senovilla-Vera metric and show that it can be locally matched to an\nEinstein-Rosen type of exterior. Finally, we explore some consequences of the\nmatching, such as trapped surface formation and gravitational radiation in the\nexterior.\n", "  We present the variability and time lag measurements of PG 0934+013 based on\na photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign over a two year period. We\nobtained 46 epochs of data from the spectroscopic campaign, which was carried\nout using the Southern African Large Telescope with $\\sim$1 week cadence over\ntwo sets of 4 month-long observing period, while we obtained 80 epochs of\n\\textit{B}-band imaging data using a few 1-m class telescopes. Due to the seven\nmonth gap between the two observing periods, we separately measured the time\nlags of broad emission lines including H$\\beta$, by comparing the emission line\nlight curve with the \\textit{B}-band continuum light curve using the\ncross-correlation function techniques. We determined the H$\\beta$ lag,\n$\\tau_{\\rm cent} = 8.46^{+2.08}_{-2.14}$ days in the observed-frame based on\nYear 2 data, while the time lag from Year 1 data was not reliably determined.\nUsing the rms spectrum of Year 2 data, we measured the \\Hb\\ line dispersion\n\\sigmaline = 668 $\\pm$ 44 \\kms\\ after correcting for the spectral resolution.\nAdopting a virial factor f = 4.47 from Woo et al. 2015, we determined the black\nhole mass M$_{BH}$ = $3.13 ^{+0.91} _{-0.93} \\times 10^{6}$ \\msun based on the\n\\Hb\\ time lag and velocity.\n", "  Abundance anomalies in globular clusters provide strong evidence for multiple\nstellar populations within each cluster. These populations are usually\ninterpreted as distinct generations, with the currently observed\nsecond-generation stars having formed in part from the ejecta of massive,\nfirst-generation \"polluter\" stars, giving rise to the anomalous abundance\npatterns. The precise nature of the polluters and their enrichment mechanism\nare still unclear. Even so, the chemical abundances measured in\nsecond-generation stars within the globular cluster NGC 2419 provide insight\ninto this puzzling process. Previous work used Monte Carlo nuclear reaction\nnetwork calculations to constrain the temperature-density conditions that could\nreproduce the observed abundances, thereby placing robust limits on the origins\nof the polluter material. The effect of individual reaction rates on these\nconditions has not been studied, however. Thus, we perform an exhaustive\nsensitivity study on the nuclear physics input to determine which reactions\nhave the greatest impact on these predictions. We find that the\n$^{30}$Si(p,$\\gamma$)$^{31}$P, $^{37}$Ar(p,$\\gamma$)$^{38}$K,\n$^{38}$Ar(p,$\\gamma$)$^{39}$K, and $^{39}$K(p,$\\gamma$)$^{40}$Ca reactions are\nall critical in determining the temperature-density conditions, and ultimately,\nthe origin of the polluter material. We conclude with recommendations for\nfuture experiments.\n", "  We show that, by monitoring the free carrier reservoir in a GaAs-based\nquantum well microcavity under nonresonant pulsed optical pumping, lasing\nsupported by a fermionic reservoir (photon lasing) can be distinguished from\nlasing supported by a reservoir of bosons (polariton lasing). Carrier densities\nare probed by measuring the photocurrent between lateral contacts deposited\ndirectly on the quantum wells of a microcavity that are partially exposed by\nwet chemical etching. We identify two clear thresholds in the input-output\ncharacteristic of the photoluminescence signal which can be attributed to\npolariton and photon lasing, respectively. The power dependence of the probed\nphotocurrent shows a distinct kink at the threshold power for photon lasing due\nto an increased radiative recombination of free carriers as stimulated emission\ninto the cavity mode sets in. At the polariton lasing threshold, on the other\nhand, the nonlinear increase of the luminescence is caused by stimulated\nscattering of exciton polaritons to the ground state which do not contribute\ndirectly to the photocurrent.\n", "  The wake behind a cube with a face normal to the flow was investigated\nexperimentally in a water tunnel using laser induced fluorescence visualisation\n(LIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Measurements were\ncarried out for moderate Reynolds numbers between 100 and 400 and in this range\na sequence of two flow bifurcations was confirmed. Values for both onsets were\ndetermined in the framework of Landau`s instability model. The measured\nlongitudinal vorticity was separated into three components corresponding to\neach of the identified regimes. It was shown that the vorticity associated with\na basic flow regime originates from corners of the bluff body, in contrast to\nthe two other contributions which are related to instability effects. The\npresent experimental results are compared with numerical simulation carried out\nearlier by Saha (Phys. Fluids, vol. 16, 2004, pp. 1630-1646).\n", "  We analyze age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) from kinematics of\nindividual stars in eight Local Group galaxies ranging in mass from Carina\n($M_{*} \\sim 10^{6}$) to M31 ($M_{*} \\sim 10^{11}$). Observationally the\n$\\sigma$ vs. stellar age trends can be interpreted as dynamical heating of the\nstars by GMCs, bars/spiral arms, or merging subhalos; alternatively the stars\ncould have simply been born out of a more turbulent ISM at high redshift and\nretain that larger velocity dispersion till present day - consistent with\nrecent IFU studies. To ascertain the dominant mechanism and better understand\nthe impact of instabilities and feedback, we develop models based on observed\nSFHs of these Local Group galaxies in order to create an evolutionary formalism\nwhich describes the ISM velocity dispersion due to a galaxy's evolving gas\nfraction. These empirical models relax the common assumption that the stars are\nborn from gas which has constant velocity dispersion at all redshifts. Using\nonly the observed SFHs as input, the ISM velocity dispersion and a mid-plane\nscattering model fits the observed AVRs of low mass galaxies without fine\ntuning. Higher mass galaxies above $M_{vir} > 10^{11}$ need a larger\ncontribution from latent dynamical heating processes (for example minor\nmergers), in excess of the ISM model. Using the SFHs we also find that\nsupernovae feedback does not appear to be a dominant driver of the gas velocity\ndispersion compared to gravitational instabilities - at least for dispersions\n$\\sigma \\gtrsim 25$ km/s. Together our results point to stars being born with a\nvelocity dispersion close to that of the gas at the time of their formation,\nwith latent dynamical heating operating with a galaxy mass-dependent\nefficiency. These semi-empirical relations may help constrain the efficiency of\nfeedback and its impact on the physics of disk settling in galaxy formation\nsimulations.\n", "  Knowing the correlation between grain boundary mobility and oxygen potential\nin yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), we have utilized the grain size as a\nmicrostructural marker to map local oxygen potential. Abrupt oxygen potential\ntransition is established under a large current density and in thicker samples.\nCathodically depressed oxygen potential can be easily triggered by poor\nelectrode kinetics or in an oxygen-lean environment. Widespread cavitation in\nthe presence of highly reducing oxygen potential suggests oxygen vacancy\ncondensation instead of oxygen bubble formation as commonly assumed for solid\noxide fuel/electrolysis cells. These results also suggest electrode kinetics\nhas a direct influence on the microstructure and properties of ceramics\nsintered under a large electric current.\n", "  We demonstrate a path to hitherto unachievable differential photometric\nprecisions from the ground, both in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), using\ncustom-fabricated beam-shaping diffusers produced using specialized\nnanofabrication techniques. Such diffusers mold the focal plane image of a star\ninto a broad and stable top-hat shape, minimizing photometric errors due to\nnon-uniform pixel response, atmospheric seeing effects, imperfect guiding, and\ntelescope-induced variable aberrations seen in defocusing. This PSF reshaping\nsignificantly increases the achievable dynamic range of our observations,\nincreasing our observing efficiency and thus better averages over\nscintillation. Diffusers work in both collimated and converging beams. We\npresent diffuser-assisted optical observations demonstrating\n$62^{+26}_{-16}$ppm precision in 30 minute bins on a nearby bright star\n16-Cygni A (V=5.95) using the ARC 3.5m telescope---within a factor of $\\sim$2\nof Kepler's photometric precision on the same star. We also show a transit of\nWASP-85-Ab (V=11.2) and TRES-3b (V=12.4), where the residuals bin down to\n$180^{+66}_{-41}$ppm in 30 minute bins for WASP-85-Ab---a factor of $\\sim$4 of\nthe precision achieved by the K2 mission on this target---and to 101ppm for\nTRES-3b. In the NIR, where diffusers may provide even more significant\nimprovements over the current state of the art, our preliminary tests have\ndemonstrated $137^{+64}_{-36}$ppm precision for a $K_S =10.8$ star on the 200\"\nHale Telescope. These photometric precisions match or surpass the expected\nphotometric precisions of TESS for the same magnitude range. This technology is\ninexpensive, scalable, easily adaptable, and can have an important and\nimmediate impact on the observations of transits and secondary eclipses of\nexoplanets.\n", "  We present a list of open questions in mathematical physics. After a\nhistorical introduction, a number of problems in a variety of different fields\nare discussed, with the intention of giving an overall impression of the\ncurrent status of mathematical physics, particularly in the topical fields of\nclassical general relativity, cosmology and the quantum realm. This list is\nmotivated by the recent article proposing 42 fundamental questions (in physics)\nwhich must be answered on the road to full enlightenment. But paraphrasing a\nfamous quote by the British football manager Bill Shankly, in response to the\nquestion of whether mathematics can answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the\nUniverse, and Everything, mathematics is, of course, much more important than\nthat.\n", "  A large separation of scales is frequently required by theories describing\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. In mass-split models with some massless\n(light) and some heavy flavors, large scale separation arises by construction\nif the system is conformal in the ultraviolet but chirally broken in the\ninfrared. Due to the presence of a conformal fixed point, such chirally broken\nsystems show hyperscaling and have a highly constrained resonance spectrum that\nis significantly different from the QCD spectrum. We present numerical evidence\nfor hyperscaling of both light-light and heavy-heavy meson resonances and show\nthat they only depend on the ratio of the light and heavy flavor masses. The\nheavy-heavy spectrum is qualitatively different from QCD. The mass of\nheavy-heavy quarkonia e.g. is not proportional to the constituent quark mass.\n", "  A comparison theorem is proved for a pair of solutions that satisfy in a weak\nsense opposite differential inequalities with nonlinearity of the form $f (u)$\nwith $f$ belonging to the class $L^p_{loc}$. The solutions are assumed to have\nnon-vanishing gradients in the domain, where the inequalities are considered.\nThe comparison theorem is applied to the problem describing steady, periodic\nwater waves with vorticity in the case of arbitrary free-surface profiles\nincluding overhanging ones. Bounds for these profiles as well as\nstreamfunctions and admissible values of the total head are obtained.\n", "  We present results from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on\nbroad flux from the nebular emission lines H$\\alpha$, [NII], [OIII], H$\\beta$,\nand [SII]. The sample consists of 127 star-forming galaxies at $1.37 < z <\n2.61$ and 84 galaxies at $2.95 < z < 3.80$. We decompose the emission lines\nusing narrow ($\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\ \\text{km s}^{-1}$) and broad ($\\text{FWHM} >\n300 \\ \\text{km s}^{-1}$) Gaussian components for individual galaxies and\nstacks. Broad emission is detected at $>3\\sigma$ in $<10$% of galaxies and the\nbroad flux accounts for 10-70% of the total flux. We find a slight increase in\nbroad to narrow flux ratio with mass but note that we cannot reliably detect\nbroad emission with $\\text{FWHM} < 275 \\ \\text{km s}^{-1}$, which may be\nsignificant at low masses. Notably, there is a correlation between higher\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) spectra and a broad component detection indicating a S/N\ndependence in our ability to detect broad flux. When placed on the N2-BPT\ndiagram ([OIII]/H$\\beta$ vs. [NII]/H$\\alpha$) the broad components of the\nstacks are shifted towards higher [OIII]/H$\\beta$ and [NII]/$\\alpha$ ratios\ncompared to the narrow component. We compare the location of the broad\ncomponents to shock models and find that the broad component could be due to\nshocks, but we do not rule out other possibilities such as the presence of an\nAGN. We estimate the mass loading factor (mass outflow rate/star formation\nrate) assuming the broad component is a photoionized outflow and find that the\nmass loading factor increases as a function of mass which agrees with previous\nstudies. We show that adding emission from shocked gas to $z\\sim0$ SDSS spectra\nshifts galaxies towards the location of $z\\sim2$ galaxies on several emission\nline diagnostic diagrams.\n", "  In the present work, we explore the potential of spin-orbit (SO) coupled\nBose-Einstein condensates to support multi-component solitonic states in the\nform of dark-bright (DB) solitons. In the case where Raman linear coupling\nbetween components is absent, we use a multiscale expansion method to reduce\nthe model to the integrable Mel'nikov system. The soliton solutions of the\nlatter allow us to reconstruct approximate traveling DB solitons for the\nreduced SO coupled system. For small values of the formal perturbation\nparameter, the resulting waveforms propagate undistorted, while for large\nvalues thereof, they shed some dispersive radiation, and subsequently distill\ninto a robust propagating structure. After quantifying the relevant radiation\neffect, we also study the dynamics of DB solitons in a parabolic trap,\nexploring how their oscillation frequency varies as a function of the bright\ncomponent mass and the Raman laser wavenumber.\n", "  This is an overview article of the mathematics of gravitational waves. We\nexplain the mathematics and physics of these waves in general relativity\ntheory, discuss the gravitational wave experiment aLIGO and their detection of\ngravitational waves as well as its implications for astrophysics. A version of\nthis article was published in the AMS Notices, Vol. 64, Issue 07, 2017, (August\nissue 2017).\n", "  We derive fitting formulae for the quick determination of the existence of\nS-type and P-type habitable zones in binary systems. Based on previous work, we\nconsider the limits of the climatological habitable zone in binary systems\n(which sensitively depend on the system parameters) based on a joint constraint\nencompassing planetary orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible\nsystem planet. Additionally, we employ updated results on planetary climate\nmodels obtained by Kopparapu and collaborators. Our results are applied to four\nP-type systems (Kepler-34, Kepler-35, Kepler-413, and Kepler-1647) and two\nS-type systems (TrES-2 and KOI-1257). Our method allows to gauge the existence\nof climatological habitable zones for these systems in a straightforward manner\nwith detailed consideration of the observational uncertainties. Further\napplications may include studies of other existing systems as well as systems\nto be identified through future observational campaigns.\n", "  Contributed paper to the Conference \"Francesco's Legacy: Star Formation in\nSpace and Time\", in memory of Francesco Palla (1954-2016), held in Florence,\nJune 5-9, 2017\n", "  Working entirely within the Schroedinger paradigm, meaning wavefunction only,\nI present a modification of his theory that prevents formation of macroscopic\ndispersion (MD; \"cats\"). The proposal is to modify the Hamiltonian based on a\nmethod introduced by Steven Weinberg in 1989, as part of a program to test\nquantum mechanics at the atomic or nuclear level. By contrast, the intent here\nis to eliminate MD without affecting the predictions of quantum mechanics at\nthe microscopic scale. This restores classical physics at the macro level.\nPossible experimental tests are indicated and the differences from previous\ntheories discussed. In a second paper, I will address the other difficulty of\nwavefunction physics without the statistical (Copenhagen) interpretation: how\nto explain random outcomes in experiments such as Stern-Gerlach, and whether a\nSchroedingerist theory with a random component can violate Bell's inequality.\n", "  In the paper we analyze 26 communities across the United States with the\nobjective to understand what attaches people to their community and how this\nattachment differs among communities. How different are attached people from\nunattached? What attaches people to their community? How different are the\ncommunities? What are key drivers behind emotional attachment? To address these\nquestions, graphical, supervised and unsupervised learning tools were used and\ninformation from the Census Bureau and the Knight Foundation were combined.\nUsing the same pre-processed variables as Knight (2010) most likely will drive\nthe results towards the same conclusions than the Knight foundation, so this\npaper does not use those variables.\n", "  In this paper we study the (2 + 1)-dimensional Dirac oscillator in the\nnoncommutative phase space and the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding\nwave functions of the system are obtained through the sl(2) algebraization. It\nis shown that the results are in good agreement with those obtained previously\nvia a different method.\n", "  Quantum particle bound in an infinite, one-dimensional square potential well\nis one of the problems in Quantum Mechanics (QM) that most of the textbooks\nstart from. There, calculating an allowed energy spectrum for an arbitrary wave\nfunction often involves Riemann zeta function resulting in a $\\pi$ series. In\nthis work, two \"$\\pi$ formulas\" are derived when calculating a spectrum of\npossible outcomes of the momentum measurement for a particle confined in such a\nwell, the series, $\\frac{\\pi^2}{8} = \\sum_{k=1}^{k=\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2k-1)^2}$,\nand the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{sin^2 x}{x^2} dx =\\pi$. The\nspectrum of the momentum operator appears to peak on classically allowed\nmomentum values only for the states with even quantum number. The present\narticle is inspired by another quantum mechanical derivation of $\\pi$ formula\nin \\cite{wallys}.\n", "  We present abundance measurements of elements O, C, Si and Fe for three\ngas-rich galaxies at z~5 using observations from the Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nand the Keck telescope in order to better constrain the early chemical\nenrichment of gas-rich galaxies. These galaxies show strong Lyman-{\\alpha}\nabsorption in the spectra of background quasars, with neutral hydrogen column\ndensities log N${_H{}_I}$(cm$^{-2}$)=20.10$\\pm$0.15, 20.10$\\pm$0.15, and\n20.80$\\pm$0.15. Using the undepleted element O, we find the metallicities [O/H]\nto be in the range of -2.51 to -2.05 dex. Our study has doubled the existing\nsample of measurements of undepleted elements at z>4.5. Combining our\nmeasurements with those from the literature, we find that the\nN${_H{}_I}$-weighted mean metallicity of z~5 absorbers is consistent with the\nprediction based on z<4.5 DLAs. Thus, we find no significant evidence of a\nsudden drop in metallicity at z>4.7 as reported by some prior studies. We also\ndetermine the extent of dust depletion using a combination of both the volatile\nelement O and the refractory elements Si and/or Fe. Some of the absorbers show\nevidence of depletion of elements on dust grains, e.g. low [Si/O] or [Fe/O].\nThe relative abundances of these absorbers along with other z~5 absorbers from\nthe literature show some peculiarities, e.g. low [C/O] in several absorbers and\nhigh [Si/O] in one absorber. Finally, we find that the metallicity vs. velocity\ndispersion relation of z~5 absorbers may be different from that of\nlower-redshift absorbers.\n", "  Dirac in 1931 gave a beautiful argument for the quantization of electric\ncharge, which required only the existence in the universe of one magnetic\nmonopole, because gauge invariance of the interaction between the pole and any\ncharge could hold only if the product of the charge and the pole strength were\nquantized in half-integer multiples of the reduced Planck constant. However, if\nthe photon had a nonzero mass, implying exponential decrease of the flux out of\nan electric charge, then Dirac's argument might seem to fail. We demonstrate\nthat the result still should hold. The key point is that magnetic charge,\nunlike electric charge, cannot be screened, so that on any surface enclosing\nthe pole Dirac's string, or equally the Wu-Yang gauge shift, must be present,\nand to make either of these invisible to charged particles the quantization\ncondition is required.\n", "  Mechanical force regulates the formation and growth of cell-cell junctions.\nCadherin is a prominent homotypic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial\nrole in establishment of intercellular adhesion. It is known that the\ntransmitted force through the cadherin-mediated junctions directly correlates\nwith the growth and enlargement of the junctions. In this paper, we propose a\nphysical model for the structural evolution of cell-cell junctions subjected to\npulling tractions, using the Bell-Dembo-Bongard thermodynamic model. Cadherins\nhave multiple adhesive states and may establish slip or catch bonds depending\non the Ca 2+ concentration. We conducted a comparative study between the\nforce-dependent behavior of clusters of slip and catch bonds. The results show\nthat the clusters of catch bonds feature some hallmarks of cell\nmechanotransduction in response to the pulling traction. This is a passive\nthermodynamic response and is entirely controlled by the effect of mechanical\nwork of the pulling force on the free energy landscape of the junction.\n", "  PET image reconstruction is challenging due to the ill-poseness of the\ninverse problem and limited number of detected photons. Recently deep neural\nnetworks have been widely and successfully used in computer vision tasks and\nattracted growing interests in medical imaging. In this work, we trained a deep\nresidual convolutional neural network to improve PET image quality by using the\nexisting inter-patient information. An innovative feature of the proposed\nmethod is that we embed the neural network in the iterative reconstruction\nframework for image representation, rather than using it as a post-processing\ntool. We formulate the objective function as a constraint optimization problem\nand solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)\nalgorithm. Both simulation data and hybrid real data are used to evaluate the\nproposed method. Quantification results show that our proposed iterative neural\nnetwork method can outperform the neural network denoising and conventional\npenalized maximum likelihood methods.\n", "  During the start of a survey program using FORS2 long slit spectroscopy on\nplanetary nebulae (PN) and their haloes, we serendipitously discovered six\nbackground emission line galaxies (ELG) with redshifts of z = 0.2057, 0.3137,\n0.37281, 0.4939, 0.7424 and 0.8668. Thus they clearly do not belong to a common\ncluster structure. We derived the major physical properties of the targets.\nSince the used long slit covers a sky area of only 570 arcsec^2, we discuss\nfurther potential of serendipitous discoveries in archival data, beside the\ndeep systematic work of the ongoing and upcoming big surveys. We conclude that\narchival data provide a decent potential for extending the overall data on ELGs\nwithout any selection bias.\n", "  In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying games on\nmultiplex networks that account for interactions across linked social contexts.\nHowever, little is known about how potential cross-context interference, or\nspillover, of individual behavioural strategy impact overall cooperation. We\nconsider three plausible spillover modes, quantifying and comparing their\neffects on the evolution of cooperation. In our model, social interactions take\nplace on two network layers: one represents repeated interactions with close\nneighbours in a lattice, the other represents one-shot interactions with random\nindividuals across the same population. Spillover can occur during the social\nlearning process with accidental cross-layer strategy transfer, or during\nsocial interactions with errors in implementation due to contextual\ninterference. Our analytical results, using extended pair approximation, are in\ngood agreement with extensive simulations. We find double-edged effects of\nspillover on cooperation: increasing the intensity of spillover can promote\ncooperation provided cooperation is favoured in one layer, but too much\nspillover is detrimental. We also discover a bistability phenomenon of\ncooperation: spillover hinders or promotes cooperation depending on initial\nfrequencies of cooperation in each layer. Furthermore, comparing strategy\ncombinations that emerge in each spillover mode provides a good indication of\ntheir co-evolutionary dynamics with cooperation. Our results make testable\npredictions that inspire future research, and sheds light on human cooperation\nacross social domains and their interference with one another.\n", "  Laser induced plasmas have found numerous applications including\nplasma-assisted combustion, combustion diagnostics, laser induced breakdown\nspectroscopy, light detection and ranging techniques (LIDAR), microwave\nguiding, reconfigurable plasma antennae etc. Multiphoton ionization (MPI) is a\nfundamental first step in high-energy laser-matter interaction and is important\nfor understanding of the mechanism of plasma formation. With the discovery of\nMPI more than 50 years ago, there were numerous attempts to determine basic\nphysical constants of this process in the direct experiments, namely\nphotoionization rates and cross-sections of the MPI, however, no reliable data\nis available until today and spread in the literature values often reaches 2-3\norders of magnitude. This is due to inability to conduct absolute measurements\nof plasma electron numbers generated by MPI which leads to uncertainties and,\nsometimes, contradictions between the MPI cross-section values utilized by\ndifferent researchers across the field. Here we report first direct measurement\nof absolute plasma electron numbers generated at MPI of air and subsequently we\nprecisely determine ionization rate and cross-section of eight-photon\nionization of oxygen molecule by 800 nm photons\n${\\sigma}_8=(3.32{\\pm}0.3)*10^{-130} W^{-8}m^{16}s^{-1}$. Method is based on\nthe absolute measurement of electron number created by MPI using elastic\nscattering of microwaves off the plasma volume in Rayleigh regime and\nestablishes a general approach to directly measure and tabulate basic constants\nof the MPI process for various gases and photon energies.\n", "  We have performed $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic resonance/nuclear quadrupole\nresonance measurements to investigate the magnetic and superconducting (SC)\nproperties on a \"superconductivity dominant\" ($S$-type) single crystal of\nCeCu$_2$Si$_2$. Although the development of antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nfluctuations down to 1~K indicated that the AFM criticality was close, Korringa\nbehavior was observed below 0.8~K, and no magnetic anomaly was observed above\n$T_{\\rm c} \\sim$ 0.6 K. These behaviors were expected in $S$-type\nCeCu$_2$Si$_2$. The temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate $1/T_1$ at zero field was almost identical to that in the\nprevious polycrystalline samples down to 130~mK, but the temperature dependence\ndeviated downward below 120~mK. In fact, $1/T_1$ in the SC state could be\nfitted with the two-gap $s_{\\pm}$-wave rather than the two-gap $s_{++}$-wave\nmodel down to 90~mK. Under magnetic fields, the spin susceptibility in both\ndirections clearly decreased below $T_{\\rm c}$, indicative of the formation of\nspin singlet pairing. The residual part of the spin susceptibility was\nunderstood by the field-induced residual density of states evaluated from\n$1/T_1T$, which was ascribed to the effect of the vortex cores. No magnetic\nanomaly was observed above the upper critical field $H_{c2}$, but the\ndevelopment of AFM fluctuations was observed, indicating that superconductivity\nwas realized in strong AFM fluctuations.\n", "  Particles with electric charge 10^(-12)e in bulk mass are not excluded by\npresent experiments. In the present letter we provide a feasible scheme to\nmeasure the millicharged particles via the optical cavity coupled to a\nlevitated microsphere. The results show that the optical probe spectrum of the\nmicro-oscillator presents a distinct shift due to the existence of millicharged\nparticles. Owing to the very narrow linewidth(10^(-7) Hz) of the optical Kerr\neffect, this shift will be more obvious, which makes the millicharges more easy\nto be detectable. We propose a method to eliminate the polarization force\nbackground via the homogeneously charged ring, which makes the scheme displays\nstrong advantages in precision than the current experiments. The technique\nproposed here paves the way for new applications for probing dark matter and\nnonzero charged neutrino in the condensed matter.\n", "  We prepare a triple quantum dot with a separate contact lead to each dot to\nstudy Pauli spin blockade in the tunnel-coupled three dots in a row. We measure\nthe tunneling current flowing between the center dot and either the left or\nright dot with the left and right leads as a common source and the center lead\nas a drain. In the biased stability diagram, we establish Pauli spin blockade\nin the respective neighboring dots, with features similarly obtained in double\nquantum dot systems. We further realize Pauli spin blockade with two different\nconditions by tuning the inter-dot coupling gates: strong and weak inter-dot\ntunnel coupling regimes. In the strong-coupling regime we observe significant\nsuppression of co-tunneling through the respective double dots due to Pauli\nspin blockade. We reveal the influence from the third dot in the triple dot\ndevice on this co-tunneling Pauli spin blockade and clarify that the\nco-tunneling Pauli spin blockade is lifted by the resonant coupling of excited\nstates to the third dot level as well as spin exchange of the left and right\ndots with the adjacent reservoir.\n", "  Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a valuable\ntool to localize, characterize, and evaluate anomalous prostate tissue.\nUltrafast gradient-echo acquisitions of MRI volumes are generated at regular\ntime intervals while the patient receives a paramagnetic contrast agent. The\nresult is a time series where each voxel exhibits a particular behavior of\ncontrast uptake (wash-in) and posterior wash-out. In this work, a segmentation\nmethod is proposed that groups together neighboring voxels with similar\ncontrast wash-out responses, using a variant of the region growing GrowCut\ncellular automaton algorithm, that evolves iteratively according to the\nrelationship of a cell to its neighboring cells. Initially, seed cells are\ndetermined through morphological filters that identify homogeneous regions in\nthe volume that are representatives of the clinically relevant types of tissues\nin the prostate. Each cell is characterized by three parameters: a label that\nidentifies the type of tissue in the associated voxel, a vector with the values\nof the DCE-MRI time series, and a strength coefficient with values between 0\nand 1 that represents the probability with which the cell belongs to its\nassigned label. Every non-seed cell can modify its state; this occurs when each\ncell is attacked by its neighbors with a strength of attack that is inversely\nproportional to the similarity of the values of the time series between the\ncells. If the strength of the attacked cell is less than the strength of the\nattack of one of its neighbors, its state changes to the one of the attacking\ncell. The attacked cell also updates its strength making it equal to the\nstrength of the attack with which it was conquered. To perform a clinical\nvalidation of the resulting segmentations, we used various cases from the\ndatabase of The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), National Cancer Institute (NCI).\n", "  Type 1 active galactic nuclei display broad emission lines, regarded as\narising from photoionized gas moving in the gravitational potential of a\nsupermassive black hole. The origin of this broad-line region gas is unresolved\nso far, however. Another component is the dusty torus beyond the broad-line\nregion, likely an assembly of discrete clumps that can hide the region from\nsome viewing angles and make them observationally appear as Type 2 objects.\nHere we report that these clumps moving within the dust sublimation radius,\nlike the molecular cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic center, will be tidally\ndisrupted by the hole, resulting in some gas becoming bound at smaller radii\nwhile other gas is ejected and returns to the torus. The clumps fulfill\nnecessary conditions to be photoionized. Specific dynamical components of\ntidally disrupted clumps include spiral-in gas as inflow, circularized gas, and\nejecta as outflow. We calculate various profiles of emission lines from these\nclouds, and find they generally agree with H$\\beta$ profiles of Palomar-Green\nquasars. We find that asymmetry, shape and shift of the profiles strongly\ndepend on [O III], luminosity, which we interpret as a proxy of dusty torus\nangles. Tidally disrupted clumps from the torus may represent the source of the\nbroad-line region gas.\n", "  We consider the phase-integral method applied to an arbitrary linear ordinary\nsecond-order differential equation with non-analytical coefficients. We propose\na universal technique based on the Frobenius method which allows to obtain new\nexact relation between connection matrices associated with its general\nsolution. The technique allows the reader to write an exact algebraic equation\nfor the Stokes constants provided the differential equation has at most one\nregular singular point in a finite area of the complex plane. We also propose a\nway to write approximate relations between Stokes constants in case of multiple\nregular singular points located far away from each other. The well-known Budden\nproblem is solved with help of this technique as an illustration of its usage.\n", "  NOvA is a long-baseline accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment\nthat is optimized for electron-neutrino appearance measurements. It uses the\nupgraded NuMI beam from Fermilab and consists of a Far Detector in Ash River,\nMinnesota and a Near Detector at Fermilab. An accurate prediction of the\nneutrino flux is key to both oscillation and cross-section measurements. The\nprecisely known neutrino-electron elastic scattering cross section provides an\nin situ constraint on the absolute flux. This talk discusses the status of the\nmeasurement of the rate of neutrino-electron elastic scattering in the NOvA\nNear Detector.\n", "  The defocusing Davey-Stewartson II equation has been shown in numerical\nexperiments to exhibit behavior in the semiclassical limit that qualitatively\nresembles that of its one-dimensional reduction, the defocusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, namely the generation from smooth initial data of\nregular rapid oscillations occupying domains of space-time that become\nwell-defined in the limit. As a first step to study this problem analytically\nusing the inverse-scattering transform, we consider the direct spectral\ntransform for the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II equation for smooth initial\ndata in the semiclassical limit. The direct spectral transform involves a\nsingularly-perturbed elliptic Dirac system in two dimensions. We introduce a\nWKB-type method for this problem, prove that it makes sense formally for\nsufficiently large values of the spectral parameter $k$ by controlling the\nsolution of an associated nonlinear eikonal problem, and we give numerical\nevidence that the method is accurate for such $k$ in the semiclassical limit.\nProducing this evidence requires both the numerical solution of the\nsingularly-perturbed Dirac system and the numerical solution of the eikonal\nproblem. The former is carried out using a method previously developed by two\nof the authors and we give in this paper a new method for the numerical\nsolution of the eikonal problem valid for sufficiently large $k$. For a\nparticular potential we are able to solve the eikonal problem in closed form\nfor all $k$, a calculation that yields some insight into the failure of the WKB\nmethod for smaller values of $k$. Informed by numerical calculations of the\ndirect spectral transform we then begin a study of the singularly-perturbed\nDirac system for values of $k$ so small that there is no global solution of the\neikonal problem.\n", "  It is well known that viable architectural structures can be identified by\nlocating the critical points of the gravitational potential energy congruent\nwith some fixed surface metric. This is because, if the walls are thin, the\nlowest energy modes of deformation are strain-free, and thus described by\nsurface isometries. If it is to stand, however, an arch had better possess some\nminimum rigidity. The bending energy consistent with this construction\nprotocol, we will show, can only depend on curvature deviations away from the\nreference equilibrium form. The question of stability, like the determination\nof equilibrium, turns on the geometry. We show how to construct the\nself-adjoint operator controlling the response to deformations consistent with\nisometry. As illustration, we reassess the stability of a simple catenary arch\nin terms of the behavior of the ground state of this operator. The energy of\nthis state increases monotonically with the bending rigidity and it is possible\nto identify the critical rigidity above which the arch is rendered stable.\nWhile this dependence may be monotonic, it exhibits a number of subcritical\nkinks indicating significant qualitative changes in the ground state associated\nwith eigenvalue crossovers among the unstable modes in the spectrum; the number\nof such competing modes increasing rapidly as the rigidity is lowered. The\ninitial collapse of a subcritical arch is controlled by the ground state; on\nthe critical threshold, there are two unstable modes of equal energy, one\nraising the arch at its center, the other lowering it. The latter dominates as\nthe instability grows. The qualitative behavior of the ground state changes as\nthe rigidity is lowered---its nodal pattern as well as its parity undergoing\nabrupt changes as the intervals between crossovers converge---complicating the\nprediction of the dominant initial mode of collapse.\n", "  We consider the problem of stability of anti-de Sitter spacetime in five\ndimensions under small purely gravitational perturbations satisfying the\ncohomogeneity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz. In analogy to spherically\nsymmetric scalar perturbations, we observe numerically a black hole formation\non the time-scale $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the\nsize of the perturbation.\n", "  In previous publications we have shown that long-ignored approximations in\nstandard model calculations could have significant implications for very low\nmass particles such as neutrinos and photons. In particular we showed that, in\na dilute plasma such as that in the solar corona, a significant decay\nprobability of $\\nu' \\rightarrow \\nu + \\gamma$ will be possible as a\nconsequence of the terms ignored in making the approximations. Here the $\\nu'$\nand $\\nu$ are high and low mass eigenstates of the neutrino. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effect in the vicinity of an expanding supernovae remnant such\nas SN1987A. We show that, in the dilute plasma external to the remnant, such\ndecays are possible and significant. We describe a calculation of effects of\nsuch decays on the anti-neutrinos from SN1987A. The calculated anti-neutrino\nenergy against arrival time agrees reasonably well with that observed, assuming\nthat the expansion velocity of the remnant is $\\approx 0.2 c$ and that the\nplasma density is high within the expanding remnant.\n", "  We demonstrate an ab-initio predictive approach to computing the thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa$) of InAs/GaAs superlattices (SLs) of varying period,\nthickness, and composition. Our new experimental results illustrate how this\nmethod can yield good agreement with experiment when realistic composition\nprofiles are used as inputs for the theoretical model. Due to intrinsic\nlimitations to the InAs thickness than can be grown, bulk-like SLs show limited\nsensitivity to the details of their composition profile, but the situation\nchanges significantly when finite-thickness effects are considered. If In\nsegregation could be minimized during the growth process, SLs with\nsignificantly higher $\\kappa$ than that of the random alloy with the same\ncomposition would be obtained, with the potential to improve heat dissipation\nin InAs/GaAs-based devices.\n", "  Strongly localized vorticity is a key ingredient of a broad variety of fluid\nphenomena, and its quantized version is considered to be the hallmark of\nsuperfluidity. Flows that correspond to vortices of a large topological charge,\ntermed \"giant vortices\", are notoriously difficult to realise and even when\nexternally imprinted, they are unstable, breaking into many vortices of a\nsingle charge. In spite of many theoretical proposals on the formation and\nstabilisation of giant vortices in ultra cold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\nand other superfluid systems, their experimental realisation remains illusive.\nPolariton condensates stand out from other superfluid systems due to their\nparticularly strong interparticle interactions combined with their\nnon-equilibrium nature, and as such provide an alternative test-bed for the\nstudy of non-trivial vortices. Here, we show that by injecting an odd number of\npolariton condensates at the vertices of a regular polygon and imposing\nfrustration into the system by controlling the interactions across vertices,\nstable spatially localized circular energy flows can be formed of non-trivial\nangular momentum. Multiply-quantized vortices, formed at the centre of a\npolygon on a non-zero density background, allow for the study of vorticity with\nlarge topological charges in superfluids and create a promising platform for\nanalogue gravity.\n", "  The asteroids are primitive solar system bodies which evolve both\ncollisionally and through disruptions due to rapid rotation [1]. These\nprocesses can lead to the formation of binary asteroids [2-4] and to the\nrelease of dust [5], both directly and, in some cases, through uncovering\nfrozen volatiles. In a sub-set of the asteroids called main-belt comets (MBCs),\nthe sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity\n[6-8]. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of\nactive comets [9] and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei\n[10]. The kilometer-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for\nseveral months around its perihelion 2011 [11], suspected to be sustained by\nthe sublimation of water ice [12] and supported by rapid rotation [13], while\nat least one component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours [14]. 288P is\npart of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a ~10km\ndiameter precursor during a shattering collision 7.5 million years ago [15].\nHere we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from the\nknown asteroid binaries for its combination of wide separation, near-equal\ncomponent size, high eccentricity, and comet-like activity. The observations\nalso provide strong support for sublimation as the driver of activity in 288P\nand show that sublimation torques may play a significant role in binary orbit\nevolution.\n", "  The compound Bi14Rh3I9 has recently been suggested as a weak\nthree-dimensional topological insulator on the basis of angle-resolved\nphotoemission and scanning-tunneling experiments in combination with density\nfunctional (DF) electronic structure calculations. These methods unanimously\nsupport the topological character of the headline compound, but a compelling\nconfirmation could only be obtained by dedicated transport experiments. The\nlatter, however, are biased by an intrinsic n-doping of the materials surface\ndue to its polarity. Electronic reconstruction of the polar surface shifts the\ntopological gap below the Fermi energy, which would also prevent any future\ndevice application. Here, we report the results of DF slab calculations for\nchemically gated and counter-doped surfaces of Bi14Rh3I9. We demonstrate that\nboth methods can be used to compensate the surface polarity without closing the\nelectronic gap.\n", "  At the SASE-FEL user facilities FLASH and European XFEL, superconducting\nTESLA type cavities are used for acceleration of the driving electron bunches.\nThe high achievable duty cycle allows for operating with long bunch trains,\nhence considerably increasing the efficiency of the machine. However,\nmultibunch free electron lasers (FEL) operation requires longitudinal and\ntransverse stability within the bunch train. The purpose of this work is to\ninvestigate the intra-bunch-train transverse dynamics at FLASH and European\nXFEL. Key relationships of superconducting rf cavity operation and the\nresulting impact on the intrabunch-train trajectory variation are described.\nThe observed trajectory variation during multibunch user runs at FLASH is\nanalyzed and related to both, intrabunch-train variations of the rf and the\nfollowing impact on the multibunch FEL performance.\n", "  In the present work, ultrathin films of Zinc oxide (ZnO) and Aluminum doped\nzinc oxide (AZO) with 20 nm thick were fabricated at 300 K on glass and\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates by means of directcurrent\nsputtering method. The structural morphology of the films were analyzed by\n(XRD) diffractometry. The average transmittance of films deposited on different\nsubstrates showed high transparency (over 80%) in the visible spectrum. The\nobjective of the present work is to investigate the thicknesses and optical\nconstants of ZnO and AZO ultrathin films prepared by DC sputtering onto (glass\nand PET) substrates using two methods (UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer and\nellipsometer (SE) by new amorphous dispersion formula) with comparison to check\nand confirm the results that obtained from UV with those obtained from SE\nmeasurements. The optical constants of films were extracted and compared using\nUV and SE techniques in the range of (200- 2200 nm) with increment of 1 nm in\norder to confirm the accuracy of the UV and shown an excellent agreement.\n", "  Interaction between microwave power, used for local heating and mode control,\nand density fluctuations can produce a broadening of the injected beam, as\nconfirmed in experiment and simulation. Increased power deposition width could\nimpact suppression of tearing mode structures on ITER. This work discusses the\nexperimental portion of an effort to understand scattering of injected\nmicrowaves by turbulence on the DIII-D tokamak. The corresponding theoretical\nmodeling work can be found in M.B. Thomas et. al.: Submitted to Nuclear Fusion\n(2017)[Author Note - this paper to be published in same journal]. In a set of\nperturbative heat transport experiments, tokamak edge millimeter-scale\nfluctuation levels and microwave heat deposition are measured simultaneously.\nBeam broadening is separated from heat transport through fitting of modulated\nfluxes. Electron temperature measurements from a 500 kHz, 48-channel ECE\nradiometer are Fourier analyzed and used to calculate a deposition-dependent\nflux. Consistency of this flux with a transport model is evaluated. A diffusive\nand convective transport solution is linearized and compared with energy\nconservation-derived fluxes. Comparison between these two forms of heat flux is\nused to evaluate the quality of ECRF deposition profiles, and fitting finds a\nsignificant broadening of 1D equilibrium ray tracing calculations from the\nbenchmarked TORAY-GA ray tracing code is needed. The physical basis,\ncross-validation, and application of the heat flux method is presented. The\nmethod is applied to a range of DIII-D discharges and finds a broadening factor\nof the deposition profile width which scales linearly with edge density\nfluctuation level. These experimental results are found to be consistent with\nthe full-wave beam broadening measured by the 3D full wave simulations in the\nsame discharges.\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanet systems requires the use of coronagraphs to reach\nhigh contrast levels (10^-8 to 10^-11) at small angular separations (0.1\").\nHowever, the performance of these devices is drastically limited by aberrations\n(in phase or in amplitude, introduced either by atmosphere or by the optics).\nCoronagraphs must therefore be combined with extreme adaptive optic systems,\ncomposed of a focal plane wavefront sensor and of a high order deformable\nmirror. These adaptive optic systems must reach a residual error in the\ncorrected wavefront of less than 0.1 nm (RMS) with a rate of 1 kHz. In\naddition, the surface defects of the deformable mirror, inherent from the\nfabrication process, must be limited in order to avoid the introduction of\namplitude aberrations. An experimental high contrast bench has been developed\nat the Paris Observatory (LESIA). This bench includes a Boston Micromachine\ndeformable mirror composed of 1024 actuators. For a precise analysis of its\nsurface and performance, we characterized this mirror on the interferometric\nbench developed since 2004 at the Marseille Observatory (LAM). In this paper,\nwe present this interferometric bench as well as the results of the analysis.\nThis will include a precise surface characterization and a description of the\nbehavior of the actuators, on a 10 by 10 actuator range (behavior of a single\nactuator, study of the cross-talk between neighbor actuators, influence of a\nstuck actuator) and on full mirror scale (general surface shape).\n", "  As the performance of coronagraphs improves, the achievable contrast is more\nand more dependent of the shape of the pupil. The future generation of space\nand ground based coronagraphic instruments will have to achieve high contrast\nlevels on on-axis and/or segmented telescopes. To correct for the high\namplitude aberrations introduced by secondary mirror structures and\nsegmentation of the primary mirror, we explore a two deformable mirror (DM)\nmethod. The major difficulty of several DM methods is the non-linear relation\nlinking actuator strokes to the point spread function in the coronagraph focal\nplane. The Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities (ACAD) method is\nachieving this minimization by solving a non linear differential Monge Ampere\nequation. Once this open loop method have reached the minimum, a close-loop\nstroke minimization method can be applied to correct for phase and amplitude\naberrations to achieve the ultimate contrast. In this paper, I describe the\nresults of the parametric analysis that that I have undertaken on this method.\nAfter recalling the principle of the method, I will described the explored\nparameter space (deformable mirror set-up, shape of the pupil, bandwidth,\ncoronagraph designs). I will precisely described the way I simulated the Vortex\ncoronagraph for this numerical simulation. Finally I will present the\npreliminary results of this parametric analysis for space telescope pupils\nonly.\n", "  The current generation of ground-based coronagraphic instruments uses\ndeformable mirrors to correct for phase errors and to improve contrast levels\nat small angular separations. Improving these techniques, several space and\nground based instruments are currently developed using two deformable mirrors\nto correct for both phase and amplitude errors. However, as wavefront control\ntechniques improve, more complex telescope pupil geometries will soon be a\nlimiting factor for these next generation coronagraphic instru- ments. The\ntechnique presented in this proceeding, the Active Correction of Aperture\nDiscontinuities method, is taking advantage of the fact that most future\ncoronagraphic instruments will include two deformable mirrors, and is proposing\nto find the shapes and actuator movements to correct for the effect introduced\nby these complex pupil geometries. We here present the results of the\nparametric analysis realized on the WFIRST pupil for which we obtained high\ncontrast levels with several deformable mirror setups (size, separation between\nthem), coronagraphs (Vortex charge 2, vortex charge 4, APLC) and spectral\nbandwidths. However, because contrast levels and separation are not the only\nmetrics to maximize the scientific return of an instrument, we also included in\nthis study the influence of these deformable mirror shapes on the throughput of\nthe instrument and sensitivity to pointing jitters. Finally, we present results\nobtained on another potential space based telescope segmented aperture. The\nmain result of this proceeding is that we now obtain comparable performance\nthan the coronagraphs previously designed for WFIRST. First result from the\nparametric analysis strongly suggest that the 2 deformable mirror set up (size\nand distance between them) has a important impact on the performance in\ncontrast and throughput of the final instrument.\n", "  Direct detection is a very promising field in exoplanet science. It allows\nthe detection of companions with large separation and allows their spectral\nanalysis. A few planets have already been detected and are under spectral\nanalysis. But the full spectral characterization of smaller and colder planets\nrequires higher contrast levels over large spectral bandwidths. Coronagraphs\ncan be used to reach these contrasts, but their efficiency is limited by\nwavefront aberrations. These deformations induce speckles, star lights leaks,\nin the focal plane after the coronagraph. The wavefront aberrations should be\nestimated directly in the science image to avoid usual limitations by\ndifferential aberrations in classical adaptive optics. In this context, we\nintroduce the Self- Coherent Camera (SCC). The SCC uses the coherence of the\nstar light to produce a spatial modulation of the speckles in the focal plane\nand estimate the associated electric complex field. Controlling the wavefront\nwith a deformable mirror, high contrasts have already been reached in\nmonochromatic light with this technique. The performance of the current version\nof the SCC is limited when widening the spectral bandwidth. We will present a\ntheoretical analysis of these issues and their possible solution. Finally, we\nwill present test bench performance in polychromatic light.\n", "  The post-Newtonian (PN) perturbative framework has been successful in\nunderstanding the slow-motion, weak field limit of Einstein's theory of gravity\non solar system scales, and for isolated astrophysical systems. The\nparameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism extended the PN framework to put\nvery tight constraints on deviations from Einstein's theory on the\naforementioned scales and systems. In this work, we extended and applied the\npost-Newtonian formalism to cosmological scales. We first used it to construct\na cosmological model to understand the effect of regularly arranged point\nsources on the background expansion. Here we found that at higher orders we\nobtained a small radiation-like correction to the standard\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, for a\nmatter-dominated universe. This radiation-like correction was purely due to the\ninhomogeneity of our model, and the non-linearity of Einstein's field\nequations. We also extended the post-Newtonian formalism to include other forms\nof matter that are cosmologically relevant, such as radiation and a\ncosmological constant, and studied the non-linear effects they might have on\nthe background expansion. Then we constructed an extension of the parameterized\npost-Newtonian formalism (PPN) to cosmological scales. We used it to\nparameterize the background expansion of the universe as well as first-order\nperturbations in cosmology, using four functions of time. We gave examples of\nhow our parameterization would work for dark energy models and scalar-tensor\nand vector-tensor theories of gravity. In the final part of this work, we\nstudied how light propagation behaves in an inhomogeneous post-Newtonian\ncosmology with matter and a cosmological constant. We used it to understand the\neffect that inhomogeneities would have on observables.\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanets requires the detection of very faint objects\norbiting close to very bright stars. In this context, the SPICES mission was\nproposed to the European Space Agency for planet characterization at visible\nwavelength. SPICES is a 1.5m space telescope which uses a coronagraph to\nstrongly attenuate the central source. However, small optical aberrations,\nwhich appear even in space telescopes, dramatically decrease coronagraph\nperformance. To reduce these aberrations, we want to estimate, directly on the\ncoronagraphic image, the electric field, and, with the help of a deformable\nmirror, correct the wavefront upstream of the coronagraph. We propose an\ninstrument, the Self-Coherent Camera (SCC) for this purpose. By adding a small\n\"reference hole\" into the Lyot stop, located after the coronagraph, we can\nproduce interferences in the focal plane, using the coherence of the stellar\nlight. We developed algorithms to decode the information contained in these\nFizeau fringes and retrieve an estimation of the field in the focal plane.\nAfter briefly recalling the SCC principle, we will present the results of a\nstudy, based on both experiment and numerical simulation, analyzing the impact\nof the size of the reference hole.\n", "  Cross sections for inclusive dijet production in diffractive deep-inelastic\nscattering are calculated for the first time in next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO) accuracy. These cross sections are compared to several HERA measurements\npublished by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. We computed the total cross\nsections, 49 single-differential and five double-differential distributions for\nsix HERA measurements. The NNLO corrections are found to be large and positive.\nThe normalization of the resulting predictions typically exceeds the data,\nwhile the kinematical shape of the data is described better at NNLO than at\nnext-to-leading order (NLO). Our results use the currently available NLO\ndiffractive parton distributions, and the discrepancy in normalization\nhighlights the need for a consistent determination of these distributions at\nNNLO accuracy.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on\ninternationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable\nperformance indicators on the process of how firms sequentially enter external\nmarkets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool that can be\nused as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external\nmarkets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms'\nexport volume, number of years of exporting, geographic areas targeted for\nexport, and when exports were initiated for each area. Additionally, the\nindicator is tested empirically in the Spanish wine sector. The main\ncontribution of this study is the creation of an international priority index\nwhich serves as a valuable and reliable tool because of its potential use in\nother industry sectors and geographic areas, allowing us to analyze how\ngeographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.\n", "  Complex networks have gained much attention from different areas of knowledge\nin recent years. Particularly, the structures and dynamics of such systems have\nattracted considerable interest. Complex networks may have characteristics of\nmultifractality. In this study, we analyze fractal and multifractal properties\nof a novel network: the large scale economic network of payments of Estonia,\nwhere companies are represented by nodes and the payments done between\ncompanies are represented by links. We present a fractal scaling analysis and\nexamine the multifractal behavior of this network by using a sandbox algorithm.\nOur results indicate the existence of multifractality in this network and\nconsequently, the existence of multifractality in the Estonian economy. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes multifractality of\na complex network of payments.\n", "  Two-dimensional semiconducting materials are particularly appealing for many\napplications. Although theory predicts a large number of two-dimensional\nmaterials, experimentally only a few of these materials have been identified\nand characterized comprehensively in the ultrathin limit. Lead iodide, which\nbelongs to the transition metal halides family and has a direct bandgap in the\nvisible spectrum, has been known for a long time and has been well\ncharacterized in its bulk form. Nevertheless, studies of this material in the\nnanometer thickness regime are rather scarce. In this article we demonstrate an\neasy way to synthesize ultrathin, highly crystalline flakes of PbI2 by\nprecipitation from a solution in water. We thoroughly characterize the produced\nthin flakes with different techniques ranging from optical and Raman\nspectros-copy to temperature-dependent photoluminescence and electron\nmicroscopy. We compare the results to ab initio calculations of the band\nstructure of the material. Finally, we fabricate photodetectors based on PbI2\nand study their optoelectronic properties.\n", "  We pursue a novel morphometric analysis to detect sources in very-high-energy\ngamma-ray counts maps by structural deviations from the background noise.\nBecause the Minkowski functionals from integral geometry quantify the shape of\nthe counts map itself, the morphometric analysis includes unbiased structure\ninformation without prior knowledge about the source. Their distribution\nprovides access to intricate geometric information about the background. We\ncombine techniques from stochastic geometry and statistical physics to\ndetermine the joint distribution of all Minkowski functionals. We achieve an\naccurate characterization of the background structure for large scan windows\n(with up to $15\\times15$ pixels), where the number of microstates varies over\nup to 64 orders of magnitude. Moreover, in a detailed simulation study, we\nconfirm the statistical significance of features in the background noise and\ndiscuss how to correct for trial effects. We also present a local correction of\ndetector effects that can considerably enhance the sensitivity of the analysis.\nIn the third paper of this series, we will use the here derived refined\nstructure characterization for a more sensitive data analysis that can detect\nformerly undetected sources.\n", "  We pursue a novel morphometric analysis to detect sources in very-high-energy\ngamma-ray counts maps by structural deviations from the background noise\nwithout assuming any prior knowledge about potential sources. The rich and\ncomplex structure of the background noise is characterized by Minkowski\nfunctionals from integral geometry. By extracting more information out of the\nsame data, we aim for an increased sensitivity. In the first two papers, we\nderived accurate estimates of the joint distribution of all Minkowski\nfunctionals. Here, we use this detailed structure characterization to detect\nstructural deviations from the background noise in a null hypothesis test. We\ncompare the analysis of the same simulated data with either a single or all\nMinkowski functionals. The joint structure quantification can detect formerly\nundetected sources. We show how the additional shape information leads to the\nincrease in sensitivity. We explain the very unique concepts and possibilites\nof our analysis compared to a standard counting method in gamma-ray astronomy,\nand we present in an outlook further improvements especially for the detection\nof diffuse background radiation and generalizations of our technique.\n", "  MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) is an integral-field spectrograph\nmounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and made available to the\nEuropean community since October 2014. The Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de\nLyon has developed a dedicated software to help MUSE users analyze the reduced\ndata. In this paper we introduce MPDAF, the MUSE Python Data Analysis\nFramework, based on several well-known Python libraries (Numpy, Scipy,\nMatplotlib, Astropy) which offers new tools to manipulate MUSE-specific data.\nWe present different examples showing how this Python package may be useful for\nMUSE data analysis.\n", "  We analysed a selected sample of exoplanets with orbital periods close to 1\nyear to study the effects of the spectral window on the data, affected by the 1\ncycle/year aliasing due to the Earth motion around the Sun. We pointed out a\nfew cases where a further observational effort would largely improve the\nreliability of the orbital solutions.\n", "  In this letter, we study the limit behavior of the evolution of Tsallis\nentropy in self-gravitating systems. The study is carried out under two\ndifferent situations, drawing the same conclusion. No matter in the energy\ntransfer process or in the mass transfer process inside the system, when\nnonextensive parameter q is more than unity, the total entropy is bounded; on\nthe contrary, when this parameter is less than unity, the total entropy is\nunbounded. There are proofs in both theory and observation that the q is always\nmore than unity. So the Tsallis entropy in self-gravitating system generally\nexhibits a bounded property. This indicates the existence of global maximum of\nTsallis entropy. It is possible for self-gravitating systems to evolve to\nthermodynamically stable states.\n", "  We consider two specific thermodynamic cycles of engine operating in a finite\ntime coupled to two thermal reservoirs with a finite heat capacity: The\nCarnot-type cycle and the Lorenz-type cycle. By means of the endo-reversible\nthermodynamics, we then discuss the power output of engine and its\noptimization. In doing so, we treat the temporal duration of a single cycle\nrigorously, i.e., without neglecting the duration of its adiabatic parts. Then\nwe find that the maximally obtainable power output P_m and the engine\nefficiency \\eta_m at the point of P_m explicitly depend on the heat conductance\nand the compression ratio. From this, it is immediate to observe that the\nwell-known results available in many references, in particular the\n(compression-ratio-independent) Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov expressions such as\n\\eta_m --> \\eta_{CAN} = 1 - (T_L/T_H)^(1/2) with the temperatures (T_H, T_L) of\nhot and cold reservoirs only, can be recovered, but, significantly enough, in\nthe limit of a vanishingly small heat conductance and an infinitely large\ncompression ratio only. Our result implies that the endo-reversible model of a\nthermal machine operating in a finite time and so producing a finite power\noutput with the Curzon-Ahlborn-Novikov results should be limited in its own\nvalidity regime.\n", "  We report here on the results from the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle\n(WIMP) search with the LUX dark matter experiment. LUX, a two-phase xenon time\nprojection chamber (TPC) with 250 kg of active mass, has been operated from\n2012 until 2016. During the operation, we observed no evidence for WIMP elastic\nscattering events. LUX achieved the most stringent limit on both the\nWIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section (1.1$\\times{10}^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for a\n50 GeV/c${}^{2}$, 90% C.L.) and on the WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross\nsection (1.6$\\times{10}^{-41}$ cm$^2$ for a 35 GeV/c${}^{2}$, 90% C.L.).\n", "  We obtain solutions of the (2 + 1) dimensional k deformed Dirac equation in\nthe presence of crossed magnetic and electric fields. It is shown that the k\ndeformed Landau levels are modified in the presence of the electric field.\nContraction of Landau levels has also been examined and it has been shown that\nthe contraction depends on a critical magnetic field which is independent of\nthe deformation parameter in first order approximation.\n", "  The measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson are presented in the\nH$\\rightarrow$ZZ$\\rightarrow$4$\\ell$ ($\\ell$=e,$\\mu$) decay channel using a\ndata sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the\nCMS detector at the LHC. The signal-strength modifier $\\mu$, defined as the\nproduction cross section of the Higgs boson times its branching fraction to\nfour leptons relative to the standard model expectation, is measured to be\n$\\mu=1.05^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$ at $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=125.09~\\mathrm{GeV}$. Constraints\nare set on the strength modifiers for the main Higgs boson production modes.\nThe mass is measured to be $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=125.26 \\pm 0.21~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and\nthe width is constrained using on-shell production to be\n$\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{H}}<1.10~\\mathrm{GeV}$, at $95\\%$ CL. The fiducial cross\nsection is measured to be $2.90^{+0.48}_{-0.44}({\\rm\nstat.})^{+0.27}_{-0.22}({\\rm sys.})~{\\mathrm{fb}}$, which is compatible with\nthe standard model prediction of $2.72\\pm0.14~{\\mathrm{fb}}$.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab is being designed to study the coherent\nneutrino-less conversion of a negative muon into an electron in the field of a\nnucleus. This process has an extremely low probability in the Standard Model\nand its observation would provide unambiguous evidence for BSM physics. The\nMu2e design aims to reach a single-event-sensitivity of about $2.5 \\times\n10^{17}$ and will probe effective new physics mass scales in the 103-104 TeV\nrange, well beyond the reach of the LHC. This work examines the maximum beam\npower that can be tolerated for beam energies in the 0.5-8 GeV range exploring\nvariations in the geometry in the region of the production target using the\nMARS15 code. This has implications for how the sensitivity might be further\nimproved with a second generation experiment using an upgraded proton beam from\nthe PIP-II project, which will be capable of providing MW beams to Fermilab\nexperiments later in the next decade.\n", "  On-chip measurement of thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) of samples along with\non-chip temperature measurements can be used to compensate for thermal\nfluctuation induced noise in refractometry using integrated photonic sensors.\nIn this article we demonstrate a device design and describe the method to\nextract TOCs of liquid samples using resonant wavelength shifts of a silicon\nmicroring resonator. The TOCs of three standard fluids; De-ionized water,\nEthanol and Isopropanol, were determined using our sensor and show a good\nagreement with values reported in literature. A mechanism for tracking of\non-chip temperature variations is also included for ensuring accuracy of TOC\nmeasurements. Potential applications of the demonstrated on-chip TOC sensor\ninclude improvements in accuracy of refractive index measurements and\nmultiparametric analysis of biochemical analytes.\n", "  We study the 19-vertex model of Statistical Mechanics in a square with the\ndomain wall boundary condition. Using the minimal set of generating flip\nactions we build a parametrized dynamic version of the model. For all observed\ndynamic weight values the equilibrium states exhibit clear limit shapes.\nAlthough the model in a way incorporates the 6-vertex model, the reason for the\nexistence of the limit shape is fundamentally more general. We conclude with a\nfurther study relating the local path geometry to the macroscopic shape\ngeometry.\n", "  We discuss an efficient physical realization of topological quantum walks on\na finite lattice. The $N$-point lattice is realized with $\\log_2 N$ qubits, and\nthe quantum circuit utilizes a number of quantum gates which is polynomial in\nthe number of qubits. In a certain scaling limit, we show that a large number\nof steps is implemented with a number of quantum gates which is independent of\nthe number of steps. We ran the quantum algorithm on the IBM-Q five-qubit\nquantum computer, thus experimentally demonstrating topological features, such\nas boundary bound states, on a lattice with $N=4$ points.\n", "  We established and estimate the full asymptotic expansion in integer powers\nof 1 N of the [ $\\sqrt$ N ] first marginals of N-body evolutions lying in a\ngeneral paradigm containing Kac models and non-relativistic quantum evolution.\nWe prove that the coefficients of the expansion are, at any time, explicitly\ncomputable given the knowledge of the linearization on the one-body meanfield\nkinetic limit equation. Instead of working directly with the corresponding\nBBGKY-type hierarchy, we follows a method developed in [22] for the meanfield\nlimit, dealing with error terms analogue to the v-functions used in previous\nworks. As a by-product we get that the rate of convergence to the meanfield\nlimit in 1 N is optimal.\n", "  Magnetic confinement fusion researches are an approach to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of nuclear fusion power for energy production. In these\nexperiments, mega-watt range power Radio-Frequency waves, from tens of MHz to\nhundreds of GHz, are injected into magnetically confined plasmas in order to\nincrease its temperature and to extend its duration. These RF systems are\nsubjected to the magnetic field environment of the experiments, ranging from\nfew tenth of Tesla to Tesla, and various orientations depending of their\nlocations. As these RF systems made of copper, silver or ceramics are located\nin vacuum environments, they are subject to multipactor discharges. These\ndischarges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned\nRF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage\nRF sources or components. In some case, especially in the MHz range of\nfrequency, multipactor discharges can be desired for vacuum conditioning. This\npaper presents the various RF systems used in magnetic fusion experiments and\nreview the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor\ndischarges for high power coaxial (MHz) and rectangular waveguides (GHz)\ntransmission lines, with their practical implications on power delivery into\nthe plasma.\n", "  Tin sulfides SnxSy are important class of materials that are actively\ninvestigated as novel photovoltaic and water splitting materials.\nFirst-principles evolutionary crystal structure search is performed with the\ngoal of constructing the complete phase diagram of SnxSy and discover new\nphases as well as new compounds of varying stoichiometry at ambient conditions\nand pressures up to 100 GPa. The ambient phase of SnS2 with P3m1 symmetry\nremains stable up to 30 GPa. Another ambient phase, SnS experiences a series of\nphase transformations: including \\alpha-SnS to \\beta-SnS at 9 GPa, followed by\n\\beta-SnS to \\gamma-SnS at 40 GPa. \\gamma-SnS is a new high-pressure metallic\nphase with Pm3m space group symmetry stable up to 100 GPa, which becomes a\nsuperconductor with a maximum Tc= 9.6 K at 40 GPa. Another new metallic\ncompound, Sn3S4 with I43d space group symmetry, is predicted to be stable at\npressures above 15 GPa, which also becomes a superconductor with a maximum\nTc=21.8 K at 30 GPa.\n", "  We study the behaviour of a Modica-Mortola phase transition type problem with\na non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. According to the parameters of\nthe problem, this leads to the existence of either one component occupying most\nof the condensate with an outer boundary layer containing the other component,\nor to many interfaces, on a periodic pattern. This is related to the striped\nbehaviour of a two component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin orbit coupling\nin one dimension. We prove that minimizers of the full Gross-Pitaevskii energy\nin 1D converge, in the Thomas-Fermi limit of strong intra-component\ninteraction, to those of the simplified Modica-Mortola problem we have studied\nin the first part.\n", "  Standard model of electropration (EP) has long emphasized a single pore\nlifetime to explain post-pulse transport across cell membranes. However, pore\nlifetimes estimated from molecular dynamics (MD) models and and those measured\nfrom experimental data differ by several orders of magnitude. We hypothesize\nthat a broad distribution of lifetimes may describe the post-pulse behavior.\nHere, we show that pore distribution, number and size of pores, show\ninteresting behavior in different ranges of pore lifetimes. Interestingly, for\nlarge electric fields (greater than 1 kV/cm) and short pore lifetimes\n(approximately 100 ns), an significant loss in pore number occurs during the\npulse. Given the large number of EP applications that apply such fields, this\nphenomenon may be crucial to post-pulse response of cell membrane to such\nfields.\n", "  Ternary C_{x}N_{y}O_{z} compounds are actively researched as novel high\nenergy density and ultrahard materials. Although some synthesis work has been\nperformed at ambient conditions, very little is known about the high pressure\nchemistry of of C_{x}N_{y}O_{z} compounds. In this work, first principles\nvariable-composition evolutionary structure prediction calculations are\nperformed with the goal of discovering novel mixed C_{x}N_{y}O_{z} materials at\nambient and high pressure conditions. By systematically searching ternary\nvariable composition crystalline materials, the full ternary phase diagram is\nconstructed in the range of pressures from 0 to 100 GPa. The search finds the\nC_{2}N_{2}O crystal containing extended covalent network of C, N, and O atoms,\nhaving space group symmetry Cmc2_{1}, and stable above just 10 GPa. Several\nother novel metastable (CO)_{x}-(N)_{y} crystalline compounds discovered during\nthe search, including two polymorphs of C_{2}NO_{2} and two polymorphs of\nC_{3}N_{2}O_{3} crystals are found to be energetically favorable compared to\npolymeric carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen. Predicted new compounds are\ncharacterized by their Raman spectra and equations of state.\n", "  It is well known that dark matter density measurements, indirect and direct\ndetection experiments, importantly complement the LHC in setting strong\nconstraints on new physics scenarios. Yet, dark matter searches are subject to\nlimitations which need to be considered for realistic analyses. For\nillustration, we explore the parameter space of the phenomenological MSSM and\ndiscuss the interplay of the constraints from dark matter searches and the LHC,\nand analyse the impact of the astrophysical uncertainties in some detail.\n", "  We present results of studying the post-pulse transport properties of single\npores. Single pores exhibit active transport (drift), and not just passive\ntransport (diffusion) at early post-pulse times. In addition, we suggest\nexperimental design methods obtained from model parameters that would enable\nexperimentalists to find localized regions of a few pores.\n", "  We perform an average case analysis of the generalization dynamics of large\nneural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the\npractically-relevant \"high-dimensional\" regime where the number of free\nparameters in the network is on the order of or even larger than the number of\nexamples in the dataset. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in\nlinear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics\nof learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and\nsignal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of\ngradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and\noverfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network\nsizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of\nsamples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.\nAdditionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires\nstarting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural\nnetworks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their\ngeneralization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce\novertraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort. We\nidentify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete models:\nfirst, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no learning occurs\nunder gradient descent; and second, the statistical properties of the\nhigh-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input correlations which\nprotect against overtraining. We demonstrate that naive application of\nworst-case theories such as Rademacher complexity are inaccurate in predicting\nthe generalization performance of deep neural networks, and derive an\nalternative bound which incorporates the frozen subspace and conditioning\neffects and qualitatively matches the behavior observed in simulation.\n", "  A comprehensive uncertainty quantification framework has been developed for\nintegrating computational and experimental kinetic data and to identify active\nsites and reaction mechanisms in catalysis. Three hypotheses regarding the\nactive site for the water-gas shift reaction on Pt/TiO2 catalysts are tested -\nPt(111), an edge interface site, and a corner interface site. Uncertainties\nassociated with DFT calculations and model errors of microkinetic models of the\nactive sites are informed and verified using Bayesian inference and predictive\nvalidation. Significant evidence is found for the role of the oxide support in\nthe mechanism. Positive evidence is found in support of the edge interface\nactive site over the corner interface site. For the edge interface site, the\nCO-promoted redox mechanism is found to be the dominant pathway and only at\ntemperatures above 573 K does the classical redox mechanism contribute\nsignificantly to the overall rate. At all reaction conditions, water and\nsurface O-H bond dissociation steps at the Pt/TiO2 interface are the main rate\ncontrolling steps.\n", "  Local constitutive relations, i.e. a weak spatial dispersion, are usually\nconsidered in the effective description of metamaterials. However, they are\noften insufficient and effects due to a nonlocality, i.e. a strong spatial\ndispersion, are encountered. Recently (K.~Mnasri et al., arXiv:1705.10969), a\ngeneric form for a nonlocal constitutive relation has been introduced that\ncould accurately describe the bulk properties of a metamaterial in terms of a\ndispersion relation. However, the description of functional devices made from\nsuch nonlocal metamaterials also requires the identification of suitable\ninterface conditions. In this contribution, we derive the interface conditions\nfor such nonlocal metamaterials.\n", "  The so-called \"minimum uncertainty\" or mu-wavelet approach has been shown to\nbe very effective. Prior work has shown that using special algorithms based on\na mu-wavelet decomposition of a seismic signal allows for arrival detection of\nvarious waves on a single-component seismogram with good precision. However,\nthe question of interpretation of the type of wave arriving has not been\naddressed. The problem lies in the fact that the algorithm detects more than\ntwo arrivals even on seismograms with little noise, the peaks corresponding to\nP and S wave arrivals on the indicator function are not always the strongest,\nand the peak corresponding to the P wave arrival is not always the first peak\ndetected. We propose to use a signal/noise relationship function in a running\nwindow as a weight coefficient of the indicator function obtained using the\nmu-wavelet transformation, which allows to isolate specifically those arrivals\nwhich correspond to significant changes in the signal amplitude. To interpret\nwave arrivals on linear registration systems (well observation systems for\nmonitoring hydrolic fracturing, ultrasound investigations on models and samples\nof geological material), an algorithm was also developed to isolate arrivals\nthat best correspond to arrivals on all registration points that have\nobservation systems. As a result, we propose an algorithm that allows to\nautomatically isolate arrivals of S and P waves on \"frac\" event recordings of a\nwell observation system, and provides agreement with manual detection that\ndoesn't exceed four discretes.\n", "  Moore and Montgomery have argued that planar periodic orbits of three bodies\nmoving in the Jacobi-Poincare, or the \"strong\" pairwise potential\n$\\sum_{i>j}\\frac{-1}{r_{ij}^2}$, can have all possible topologies. Here we\nsearch systematically for such orbits with vanishing angular momentum and find\n24 topologically distinct orbits, 22 of which are new, in a small section of\nthe allowed phase space, with a tendency to overcrowd, due to overlapping\ninitial conditions. The topologies of these 24 orbits belong to three algebraic\nsequences defined as functions of integer $n=0,1,2, \\ldots$. Each sequence\nextends to $n \\to \\infty$, but the separation of initial conditions for orbits\nwith $n \\geq 10$ becomes practically impossible with a numerical precision of\n16 decimal places. Nevertheless, even with a precision of 16 decimals, it is\nclear that in each sequence both the orbit's initial angle $\\phi_n$ and its\nperiod $T_n$ approach finite values in the asymptotic limit ($n \\to \\infty$).\nTwo of three sequences are overlapping in the sense that their initial angles\n$\\phi$ occupy the same segment on the circle and their asymptotic values\n$\\phi_{\\infty}$ are (very) close to each other. The actions of these orbits\nrise linearly with the index $n$ that describes the orbit's topology, which is\nin agreement with the Newtonian case. We show that this behaviour is consistent\nwith the assumption of analyticity of the action as a function of period.\n", "  Spin coating technique was used to synthesize pure ZnO and Cu doped ZnO films\non amorphous and conducting glass substrates. The doped amount of Cu in ZnO was\nvaried up to 5% in atomic percentage. Speed of spin coating system, coating\ntime, initial chemical solution and annealing conditions were varied to\noptimize the properties of samples. Transmittance of samples was measured for\nZnO doped with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% of Cu. Absorbance, reflectance and refractive\nindex were derived from the measured transmittance. Film thickness of each film\nwas calculated using the graphs of refractive index versus wavelength. Film\nthickness varies in a random manner depending on the amount of ZnO or Cu doped\nZnO solutions spread on the substrate. The energy gap of each film was\ncalculated using the graph of square of absorption coefficient time photon\nenergy versus photon energy. The calculated energy gap values of Cu doped ZnO\nfilm samples decrease with the Cu concentration in ZnO. This means that the\nconductivity of ZnO can be increased by adding a trace amount of conducting\nmaterial such as Cu.\n", "  Polymer nanocomposites based on 2D materials as fillers are the target in the\nindustrial sector, but the ability to manufacture them on a large scale is very\nlimited, and there is a lack of tools to scale up the manufacturing process of\nthese nanocomposites. Here, for the first time, a systematic and fundamental\nstudy showing how 2D materials are inserted into the polymeric matrix in order\nto obtain nanocomposites using conventional and industrially scalable polymer\nprocessing machines leading to large-scale manufacturing are described. Two new\nstrategies were used to insert pre-exfoliated 2D material into the polymer\nmatrix, liquid-phase feeder, and solid-solid deposition. Characterizations were\nbeyond micro and nanoscale, allowing the evaluation of the morphology for\nmillimeter samples size. The methodologies described here are extendable to all\nthermoplastic polymers and 2D materials providing nanocomposites with suitable\nmorphology to obtain singular properties and also triggering the start of the\nmanufacturing process on a large scale.\n", "  The well-known \"Sommerfeld radiation problem\" of a small -Hertzian- vertical\ndipole above flat lossy ground is reconsidered. The problem is examined in the\nspectral domain, through which it is proved to yield relatively simple integral\nexpressions for the received Electromagnetic (EM) field. Then, using the Saddle\nPoint method, novel analytical expressions for the scattered EM field are\nobtained, including sliding observation angles. As a result, a closed form\nsolution for the subject matter is provided. Also, the necessary conditions for\nthe emergence of the so-called Surface Wave are discussed as well. A complete\nmathematical formulation is presented, with detailed derivations where\nnecessary.\n", "  This paper describes the simulation studies done for the standard NOvA target\nand the proposed new minimal NOvA target design, in forward and reverse horn\ncurrent for studying the neutrino and antineutrino event yield and the\nbackground contamination at the near and far detector. The standard NOvA target\nis segmented into 48 graphite segments (fins) with two magnetic horns, Horn 1\nplaced at MCZERO and Horn 2 placed at 19.18 m from MCZERO. The new minimal\ntarget design has 24 graphite fins extended into Horn 1. It shows the study for\nthe position optimization of the Horn 2 relative to Horn 1 for the standard and\nthe new minimal target design. The effect of introducing an additional horn\n(identical to Horn 2) with the new minimal target design, on the neutrino yield\nand the energy spectra, has also been explored.\n", "  We present the concept of magnetic gas detection by the Extraordinary Hall\neffect (EHE). The technique is compatible with the existing conductometric gas\ndetection technologies and allows simultaneous measurement of two independent\nparameters: resistivity and magnetization affected by the target gas.\nFeasibility of the approach is demonstrated by detecting low concentration\nhydrogen using thin CoPd films as the sensor material. The Hall effect\nsensitivity of the optimized samples exceeds 240% per 104 ppm at hydrogen\nconcentrations below 0.5% in the hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere, which is more\nthan two orders of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of the conductance\ndetection.\n", "  Total capacitance of a dielectric filled circular disc configuration (radius\nr and separation d) has been numerically evaluated over relative permittivities\nranging from 1 to 80 and aspect ratios ranging from 0.001 to 10. A new\nperspective is presented by which, the total capacitance, for a given disc\nradius r, is found to depend only on a simple scaled disc separation for the\nwhole range of aspect ratios and relative permittivities considered. The\nscaling notion stems from noting that the path length has to be larger than\nwhat it would be in free space to have the same potential difference across the\ncharged discs since the electric field strength is reduced within a homogenous\ndielectric medium by the relative permittivity. This scaling permits\ntranslation of practical measurements across a range of aspect ratios and\nrelative permittivities. Further, the scaling feature allows for any\ncomputational approach that determines the total capacitance in free space, to\nbe applicable for dielectric media having relative permittivities in the range\n1 to 80. It is believed that the scaling would become better with increasing\nrelative permittivities for practically relevant separations.\n", "  A systematic way of improving exchange-correlation energy functionals of\ndensity functional theory has been to make them satisfy more and more exact\nrelations. Starting from the initial GGA functionals, this has culminated into\nthe recently proposed SCAN(Strongly constrained and appropriately normed)\nfunctional that satisfies several known constraints and is appropriately\nnormed. The ultimate test for the functionals developed is the accuracy of\nenergy calculated by employing them. In this paper, we test these\nexchange-correlation functionals -the GGA hybrid functionals B3LYP and PBE0,\nand the meta-GGA functional SCAN- from a different perspective. We study how\naccurately these functionals reproduce the exchange-correlation energy when\nelectron-electron interaction is scaled as scaling parameter times Vee with\nthis parameter varying between 0 and 1. Our study reveals interesting\ncomparison between these functionals and the associated difference Tc between\nthe interacting and the non-interacting kinetic energy for the same density.\n"]}
