This free energy supports a tricritical point which\nis different from the conventional one and this change offers a correct\nunderstanding of the experimental phase diagram of imbalanced Fermi systems\n(Shin et al, Nature, 2008). The specific heat also happens to be different than\nin standard theory.\n", "  This paper defines an angular velocity for time-dependent functions on the\nsphere, and applies it to gravitational waveforms from compact binaries.\nBecause it is geometrically meaningful and has a clear physical motivation, the\nangular velocity is uniquely useful in helping to solve an important---and\nlargely ignored---problem in models of compact binaries: the inverse problem of\ndeducing the physical parameters of a system from the gravitational waves\nalone. It is also used to define the corotating frame of the waveform. When\ndecomposed in this frame, the waveform has no rotational dynamics and is\ntherefore as slowly evolving as possible. The resulting simplifications lead to\nstraightforward methods for accurately comparing waveforms and constructing\nhybrids. As formulated in this paper, the methods can be applied robustly to\nboth precessing and nonprecessing waveforms, providing a clear, comprehensive,\nand consistent framework for waveform analysis. Explicit implementations of all\nthese methods are provided in accompanying computer code.\n", "  A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) is developed to investigate the hydrodynamic\nand thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects in phase separation processes.\nThe interparticle force drives changes and the gradient force, induced by\ngradients of macroscopic quantities, opposes them. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the interplay between them by providing detailed inspection of\nvarious non-equilibrium observables. Based on the TNE features, we define a TNE\nstrength which roughly estimates the deviation amplitude from the thermodynamic\nequilibrium. The time evolution of the TNE intensity provides a convenient and\nefficient physical criterion to discriminate the stages of the spinodal\ndecomposition and domain growth. Via the DBM simulation and this criterion, we\nquantitatively study the effects of latent heat and surface tension on phase\nseparation. It is found that, the TNE strength attains its maximum at the end\nof the spinodal decomposition stage, and it decreases when the latent heat\nincreases from zero. The surface tension effects are threefold, to prolong the\nduration of the spinodal decomposition stage, decrease the maximum TNE\nintensity, and accelerate the speed of the domain growth stage.\n", "  This aim of this article is to explore the potential use of Wikipedia page\nview data for predicting electoral results. Responding to previous critiques of\nwork using socially generated data to predict elections, which have argued that\nthese predictions take place without any understanding of the mechanism which\nenables them, we first develop a theoretical model which highlights why people\nmight seek information online at election time, and how this activity might\nrelate to overall electoral outcomes, focussing especially on how different\ntypes of parties such as new and established parties might generate different\ninformation seeking patterns. We test this model on a novel dataset drawn from\na variety of countries in the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections. We\nshow that while Wikipedia offers little insight into absolute vote outcomes, it\noffers a good information about changes in both overall turnout at elections\nand in vote share for particular parties. These results are used to enhance\nexisting theories about the drivers of aggregate patterns in online information\nseeking.\n", "  The paper attempts to develop a suitable accessibility index for networks\nwhere each link has a value such that a smaller number is preferred like\ndistance, cost, or travel time. A measure called distance sum is characterized\nby three independent properties: anonymity, an appropriately chosen\nindependence axiom, and dominance preservation, which requires that a node not\nfar to any other is at least as accessible.\n  We argue for the need of eliminating the independence property in certain\napplications. Therefore generalized distance sum, a family of accessibility\nindices, will be suggested. It is linear, considers the accessibility of\nvertices besides their distances and depends on a parameter in order to control\nits deviation from distance sum. Generalized distance sum is anonymous and\nsatisfies dominance preservation if its parameter meets a sufficient condition.\nTwo detailed examples demonstrate its ability to reflect the vulnerability of\naccessibility to link disruptions.\n", "  In this paper we generalize the definition of the FKMM-invariant introduced\nin [DG2] for the case of \"Quaternionic\" vector bundles over involutive base\nspaces endowed with free involution or with a non-finite fixed-point set. In\n[DG2] it has already be shown how the FKMM-invariant provides a cohomological\ndescription of the Fu-Kane-Mele index used to classify topological insulators\nin class AII. It follows that the FKMM-invariant described in this paper\nprovides a cohomological generalization of the Fu-Kane-Mele index which is\napplicable to the classification of protected phases for other type of\ntopological quantum systems (TQS) which are not necesarily related to models\nfor topological insulators (e.g. the two-dimensional models of adiabatically\nperturbed systems discussed in [GR]). As a byproduct we provide the complete\nclassification of \"Quaternionic\" vector bundles over a big class of low\ndimensional involutive spheres and tori.\n", "  The Fourier transform of the observed magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) in\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\\delta }$ high-temperature superconductors has a\nprominent low-frequency peak with two smaller neighbouring peaks. The\nseparation and positions of these three peaks are almost independent of doping.\nThis pattern has been explained previously by rather special, exquisitely\ndetailed, Fermi-surface reconstruction. We propose that these MQO have a\ndifferent origin, and their frequencies are related to the bilayer and\ninter-bilayer electron hopping rather than directly to the areas of tiny\nFermi-surface pockets. Such so-called \"slow oscillations\" explain more\nnaturally many features of the observed oscillations and allow us to estimate\nthe inter-layer transfer integrals and in-plane Fermi momentum.\n", "  Standard quantum theory represents a composite system at a given time by a\njoint state, but it does not prescribe a joint state for a composite of systems\nat different times. If a more even-handed treatment of space and time is\npossible, then such a joint state should be definable, and one might expect it\nto satisfy the following five conditions: that it is a Hermitian operator on\nthe tensor product of the single-time Hilbert spaces; that it represents\nprobabilistic mixing appropriately; that it has the appropriate classical\nlimit; that it has the appropriate single-time marginals; that composing over\nmultiple time-steps is associative. We show that no construction satisfies all\nthese requirements. If an even-handed treatment of space and time is possible,\ntherefore, one or more axioms must be dropped. In particular, if Hermiticity is\ndropped, then we show that the construction is fixed uniquely up to an ordering\nconvention.\n", "  It has been shown recently that local four-fermion interactions on the edges\nof two-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological insulators give rise to\na new non-Fermi-liquid phase, called helical Luttinger liquid (HLL). In this\nwork, we provide a first-principle derivation of this non-Fermi-liquid phase\nbased on the gauge-theory approach. Firstly, we derive a gauge theory for the\nedge states by simply assuming that the interactions between the Dirac fermions\nat the edge are mediated by a quantum dynamical electromagnetic field. Here,\nthe massless Dirac fermions are confined to live on the one-dimensional\nboundary, while the (virtual) photons of the U(1) gauge field are free to\npropagate in all the three spatial dimensions that represent the physical space\nwhere the topological insulator is embedded. We then determine the effective\n1+1-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) given by the conformal quantum\nelectrodynamics (CQED). By integrating out the gauge field in the corresponding\npartition function, we show that the CQED gives rise to a 1+1-dimensional\nThirring model. The bosonized Thirring Hamiltonian describes exactly a HLL with\na parameter K and a renormalized Fermi velocity that depend on the value of the\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$.\n", "  Methylammonium lead iodide perovskites are considered direct bandgap\nsemiconductors. Here we show that in fact they present a weakly indirect\nbandgap 60 meV below the direct bandgap transition. This is a consequence of\nspin-orbit coupling resulting in Rashba-splitting of the conduction band. The\nindirect nature of the bandgap explains the apparent contradiction of strong\nabsorption and long charge carrier lifetime. Under hydrostatic pressure from\nambient to 325 MPa, Rashba splitting is reduced due to a pressure induced\nordering of the crystal structure. The nature of the bandgap becomes\nincreasingly more direct, resulting in five times faster charge carrier\nrecombination, and a doubling of the radiative efficiency. At hydrostatic\npressures above 325 MPa, MAPI undergoes a reversible phase transition resulting\nin a purely direct bandgap semiconductor. The pressure-induced changes suggest\nepitaxial and synthetic routes to higher efficiency optoelectronic devices.\n", "  We contribute another anisotropy study to this field of research using Type\nIa supernovae (SNe Ia). In this work, we utilise the power spectrum calculation\nmethod and apply it to both the current SNe Ia data and simulation. Using the\nUnion2.1 data set at all redshifts, we compare the spectrum of the residuals of\nthe observed distance moduli to that expected from an isotropic universe\naffected by the Union2.1 observational uncertainties at low multipoles. Through\nthis comparison we find a dipolar anisotropy with tension of less that\n$2\\sigma$ towards $l =171^\\circ \\pm 21^\\circ$ and $b=-26^\\circ \\pm 28^\\circ$\nwhich is mainly induced by anisotropic spatial distribution of the SNe with $z\n> 0.2$ rather than being a cosmic effect. Furthermore, we find a tension of\n$\\sim 4\\sigma$ at $\\ell=4$ between the two spectra. Our simulations are\nconstructed with the characteristics of the upcoming surveys like the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which shall bring us the largest SNe Ia\ncollection to date. We make predictions for the amplitude of a possible dipolar\nanisotropy that would be detectable by future SNe Ia surveys.\n", "  Isospin-symmetry-violating class II and III contact terms are introduced into\nthe Skyrme energy density functional to account for charge dependence of the\nstrong nuclear interaction. The two new coupling constants are adjusted to\navailable experimental data on triplet and mirror displacement energies,\nrespectively. We present preliminary results of the fit, focusing on its\nnumerical stability with respect to the basis size.\n", "  We propose the existence of a lower bound on the energy of pure neutron\nmatter (PNM) on the basis of unitary-gas considerations. We discuss its\njustification from experimental studies of cold atoms as well as from\ntheoretical studies of neutron matter. We demonstrate that this bound results\nin limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference\nbetween the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this\nbound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In\naddition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies\nboth upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which\ndescribes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower\nbound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds\nare found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM\nand constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because\nseveral equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations\nof supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that\nviolate these bounds. Furthermore, below the nuclear saturation density, the\nbound on neutron-matter energies leads to a lower limit to the\ndensity-dependent symmetry energy, which leads to upper limits to the nuclear\nsurface symmetry parameter and the neutron-star crust-core boundary. We also\nobtain a lower limit to the neutron-skin thicknesses of neutron-rich nuclei.\nAbove the nuclear saturation density, the bound on neutron-matter energies also\nleads to an upper limit to the symmetry energy, with implications for\nneutron-star cooling via the direct Urca process.\n", "  Photonic integration is an enabling technology for photonic quantum science,\noffering greater scalability, stability, and functionality than traditional\nbulk optics. Here, we describe a scalable, heterogeneous III-V/silicon\nintegration platform to produce Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic circuits incorporating\nGaAs-based nanophotonic devices containing self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum\ndots. We demonstrate pure singlephoton emission from individual quantum dots in\nGaAs waveguides and cavities - where strong control of spontaneous emission\nrate is observed - directly launched into Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides with > 90 %\nefficiency through evanescent coupling. To date, InAs/GaAs quantum dots\nconstitute the most promising solidstate triggered single-photon sources,\noffering bright, pure and indistinguishable emission that can be electrically\nand optically controlled. Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides offer low-loss propagation,\ntailorable dispersion and high Kerr nonlinearities, desirable for linear and\nnonlinear optical signal processing down to the quantum level. We combine these\ntwo in an integration platform that will enable a new class of scalable,\nefficient and versatile integrated quantum photonic devices\n", "  We propose to use two-body regularized finite-range pseudopotential to\ngenerate nuclear energy density functional (EDF) in both particle-hole and\nparticle-particle channels, which makes it free from self-interaction and\nself-pairing, and also free from singularities when used beyond mean field. We\nderive a sequence of pseudopotentials regularized up to next-to-leading order\n(NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO), which fairly well describe\ninfinite-nuclear-matter properties and finite open-shell paired and/or deformed\nnuclei. Since pure two-body pseudopotentials cannot generate sufficiently large\neffective mass, the obtained solutions constitute a preliminary step towards\nfuture implementations, which will include, e.g., EDF terms generated by\nthree-body pseudopotentials.\n", "  In Landau theory of Fermi liquids, the particle-hole interaction near the\nFermi energy in different spin-isospin channels is probed in terms of an\nexpansion over the Legendre polynomials. This provides a useful and efficient\nway to constrain properties of nuclear energy density functionals in symmetric\nnuclear matter and finite nuclei. In this study, we present general expressions\nfor Landau parameters corresponding to a two-body central local regularized\npseudopotential. We also show results obtained for two recently adjusted NLO\nand N$^2$LO parametrizations. Such pseudopotentials will be used to determine\nmean-field and beyond-mean-field properties of paired nuclei across the entire\nnuclear chart.\n", "  The emergence of large stores of transactional data generated by increasing\nuse of digital devices presents a huge opportunity for policymakers to improve\ntheir knowledge of the local environment and thus make more informed and better\ndecisions. A research frontier is hence emerging which involves exploring the\ntype of measures that can be drawn from data stores such as mobile phone logs,\nInternet searches and contributions to social media platforms, and the extent\nto which these measures are accurate reflections of the wider population. This\npaper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which\nlocal commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter. It\nmakes three contributions in particular. First, it shows that simple heuristics\ndrawn from geolocated Twitter data offer a good proxy for local commuting\npatterns; one which outperforms the major existing method for estimating these\npatterns (the radiation model). Second, it investigates sources of error in the\nproxy measure, showing that the model performs better on short trips with\nhigher volumes of commuters; it also looks at demographic biases but finds\nthat, surprisingly, measurements are not significantly affected by the fact\nthat the demographic makeup of Twitter users differs significantly from the\npopulation as a whole. Finally, it looks at potential ways of going beyond\nsimple heuristics by incorporating temporal information into models.\n", "  We analyze the radiative and nonradiative linearized variables in a gravity\ntheory within the familiy of the nonprojectable Horava theories, the Horava\ntheory at the kinetic-conformal point. There is no extra mode in this\nformulation, the theory shares the same number of degrees of freedom with\ngeneral relativity. The large-distance effective action, which is the one we\nconsider, can be given in a generally-covariant form under asymptotically flat\nboundary conditions, the Einstein-aether theory under the condition of\nhypersurface orthogonality on the aether vector. In the linearized theory we\nfind that only the transverse-traceless tensorial modes obey a sourced wave\nequation, as in general relativity. The rest of variables are nonradiative. The\nresult is gauge-independent at the level of the linearized theory. For the case\nof a weak source, we find that the leading mode in the far zone is exactly\nEinstein's quadrupole formula of general relativity, if some coupling constants\nare properly identified. There are no monopoles nor dipoles in this\nformulation, in distinction to the nonprojectable Horava theory outside the\nkinetic-conformal point. We also discuss some constraints on the theory arising\nfrom the observational bounds on Lorentz-violating theories.\n", "  The initial theoretical connections between Leontief input-output models and\nMarkov chains were established back in 1950s. However, considering the wide\nvariety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, there has not been a full\ninvestigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism.\nUsing the recently available world input-output database, we modeled the\nevolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a\nseries of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving\nsystem via different properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time,\nKemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the\ntransition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and\nKemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we\nfocused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of\nthe economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional\nindex of economies. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk,\ncalled systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio\nof number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock\nin the activity of a node and the latter is based on the number of times a\nspecific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the\nother nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of\nmonetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect\nof a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the\nnetwork. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high\nstructural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network,\nthere are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the\nnetwork in terms of connectivity and the average monetary flow.\n", "  Gate-tunable semiconductor nanowires with superconducting leads have great\npotential for quantum computation and as model systems for mesoscopic Josephson\njunctions. The supercurrent, $I$, versus the phase, $\\phi$, across the junction\nis called the current-phase relation (CPR). It can reveal not only the\namplitude of the critical current, but also the number of modes and their\ntransmission. We measured the CPR of many individual InAs nanowire Josephson\njunctions, one junction at a time. Both the amplitude and shape of the CPR\nvaried between junctions, with small critical currents and skewed CPRs\nindicating few-mode junctions with high transmissions. In a gate-tunable\njunction, we found that the CPR varied with gate voltage: Near the onset of\nsupercurrent, we observed behavior consistent with resonant tunneling through a\nsingle, highly transmitting mode. The gate dependence is consistent with\nmodeled subband structure that includes an effective tunneling barrier due to\nan abrupt change in the Fermi level at the boundary of the gate-tuned region.\nThese measurements of skewed, tunable, few-mode CPRs are promising both for\napplications that require anharmonic junctions and for Majorana readout\nproposals.\n", "  Accurate and efficient control of quantum systems is one of the central\nchallenges for quantum information processing. Current state-of-the-art\nexperiments rarely go beyond 10 qubits and in most cases demonstrate only\nlimited control. Here we demonstrate control of a 12-qubit system, and show\nthat the system can be employed as a quantum processor to optimize its own\ncontrol sequence by using measurement-based feedback control (MQFC). The final\nproduct is a control sequence for a complex 12-qubit task: preparation of a\n12-coherent state. The control sequence is about 10% more accurate than the one\ngenerated by the standard (classical) technique, showing that MQFC can correct\nfor unknown imperfections. Apart from demonstrating a high level of control\nover a relatively large system, our results show that even at the 12-qubit\nlevel, a quantum processor can be a useful lab instrument. As an extension of\nour work, we propose a method for combining the MQFC technique with a twirling\nprotocol, to optimize the control sequence that produces a desired Clifford\ngate.\n", "  We analyze the full statistics of a stochastic squeeze process. The model's\ntwo parameters are the bare stretching rate~$w$, and the angular diffusion\ncoefficient~$D$. We carry out an exact analysis to determine the drift and the\ndiffusion coefficient of $\\log(r)$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. The\nresults go beyond the heuristic lognormal description that is implied by the\ncentral limit theorem. Contrary to the common \"Quantum Zeno\" approximation, the\nradial diffusion is not simply $D_r = (1/8)w^2/D$, but has a non-monotonic\ndependence on $w/D$. Furthermore, the calculation of the radial moments is\ndominated by the far non-Gaussian tails of the $\\log(r)$ distribution.\n", "  In monolayer semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides, the\nexciton-phonon interaction is expected to strongly affect the photocarrier\ndynamics. Here, we report on an unusual oscillatory enhancement of the neutral\nexciton photoluminescence with the excitation laser frequency in monolayer\nMoSe2. The frequency of oscillation matches that of the M-point longitudinal\nacoustic phonon, LA(M). Oscillatory behavior is also observed in the\nsteady-state emission linewidth and in timeresolved photoluminescence\nexcitation data, which reveals variation with excitation energy in the exciton\nlifetime. These results clearly expose the key role played by phonons in the\nexciton formation and relaxation dynamics of two-dimensional van der Waals\nsemiconductors.\n", "  We consider the effect of introducing a small number of non-aligning agents\nin a well-formed flock. To this end, we modify a minimal model of active\nBrownian particles with purely repulsive (excluded volume) forces to introduce\nan alignment interaction that will be experienced by all the particles except\nfor a small minority of \"dissenters\". We find that even a very small fraction\nof dissenters disrupts the flocking state. Strikingly, these motile dissenters\nare much more effective than an equal number of static obstacles in breaking up\nthe flock. For the studied system sizes we obtain clear evidence of scale\ninvariance at the flocking-disorder transition point and the system can be\neffectively described with a finite-size scaling formalism. We develop a\ncontinuum model for the system which reveals that dissenters act like annealed\nnoise on aligners, with a noise strength that grows with the persistence of the\ndissenters' dynamics.\n", "  Investigation of HV-CMOS sensors for use as a tracking detector in the ATLAS\nexperiment at the upgraded LHC (HL-LHC) has recently been an active field of\nresearch. A potential candidate for a pixel detector built in\nSilicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology has already been characterized in terms\nof radiation hardness to TID (Total Ionizing Dose) and charge collection after\na moderate neutron irradiation. In this article we present results of an\nextensive irradiation hardness study with neutrons up to a fluence of 1x10e16\nneq/cm2. Charge collection in a passive pixelated structure was measured by\nEdge Transient Current Technique (E-TCT). The evolution of the effective space\ncharge concentration was found to be compliant with the acceptor removal model,\nwith the minimum of the space charge concentration being reached after 5x10e14\nneq/cm2. An investigation of the in-pixel uniformity of the detector response\nrevealed parasitic charge collection by the epitaxial silicon layer\ncharacteristic for the SOI design. The results were backed by a numerical\nsimulation of charge collection in an equivalent detector layout.\n", "  Fluctuation Theorems are central in stochastic thermodynamics, as they allow\nfor quantifying the irreversibility of single trajectories. Although they have\nbeen experimentally checked in the classical regime, a practical demonstration\nin the framework of quantum open systems is still to come. Here we propose a\nrealistic platform to probe fluctuation theorems in the quantum regime. It is\nbased on an effective two-level system coupled to an engineered reservoir, that\nenables the detection of the photons emitted and absorbed by the system. When\nthe system is coherently driven, a measurable quantum component in the entropy\nproduction is evidenced. We quantify the error due to photon detection\ninefficiency, and show that the missing information can be efficiently\ncorrected, based solely on the detected events. Our findings provide new\ninsights into how the quantum character of a physical system impacts its\nthermodynamic evolution.\n", "  The presence of undesirable dominating signals in geophysical experimental\ndata is a challenge in many subfields. One remarkable example is surface\ngravimetry, where frequencies from Earth tides correspond to time-series\nfluctuations up to a thousand times larger than the phenomena of major\ninterest, such as hydrological gravity effects or co-seismic gravity changes.\nThis work discusses general methods for removal of unwanted dominating signals\nby applying them to 8 long-period gravity time-series of the International\nGeodynamics and Earth Tides Service, equivalent to the acquisition from 8\ninstruments in 5 locations representative of the network. We compare three\ndifferent conceptual approaches for tide removal: frequency filtering, physical\nmodelling and data-based modelling. Each approach reveals a different\nlimitation to be considered depending on the intended application. Vestiges of\ntides remain in the residues for the modelling procedures, whereas the signal\nwas distorted in different ways by the filtering and data-based procedures. The\nlinear techniques employed were power spectral density, spectrogram,\ncross-correlation and classical harmonics decomposition, while the system\ndynamics was analysed by state-space reconstruction and estimation of the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent. Although the tides could not be completely\neliminated, they were sufficiently reduced to allow observation of geophysical\nevents of interest above the $10 \\text{ nm s}^{-2}$ level, exemplified by a\nhydrology-related event of $60 \\text{ nm s}^{-2}$. The implementations adopted\nfor each conceptual approach are general, so that their principles could be\napplied to other kinds of data affected by undesired signals composed mainly by\nperiodic or quasi-periodic components.\n", "  We propose an Analytical method of Blind Separation (ABS) of cosmic\nmagnification from the intrinsic fluctuations of galaxy number density in the\nobserved galaxy number density distribution. The ABS method utilizes the\ndifferent dependences of the signal (cosmic magnification) and contamination\n(galaxy intrinsic clustering) on galaxy flux, to separate the two. It works\ndirectly on the measured cross galaxy angular power spectra between different\nflux bins. It determines/reconstructs the lensing power spectrum analytically,\nwithout assumptions of galaxy intrinsic clustering and cosmology. It is\nunbiased in the limit of infinite number of galaxies. In reality the lensing\nreconstruction accuracy depends on survey configurations, galaxy biases, and\nother complexities, due to finite number of galaxies and the resulting shot\nnoise fluctuations in the cross galaxy power spectra. We estimate its\nperformance (systematic and statistical errors) in various cases. We find that,\nstage IV dark energy surveys such as SKA and LSST are capable of reconstructing\nthe lensing power spectrum at $z\\simeq 1$ and $\\ell\\la 5000$ accurately. This\nlensing reconstruction only requires counting galaxies, and is therefore highly\ncomplementary to the cosmic shear measurement by the same surveys.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the quantum Hall liquid in a half-filled second\nLandau level ($n=1$) as a function of band mass anisotropy using numerical\nexact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nmethods. We find increasing the mass anisotropy induces a quantum phase\ntransition from the Moore-Read state to a charge density wave state. By\nanalyzing the energy spectrum, guiding center structure factors and by adding\nweak pinning potentials, we show that this charge density wave is a\nuni-directional quantum Hall stripe, which has a periodicity of a few magnetic\nlengths and survives in the thermodynamic limit. We find smooth profiles for\nthe guiding center occupation function that reveal the strong coupling nature\nof the array of chiral Luttinger liquids residing at the stripe edges.\n", "  We introduce a universal scheme to divide the power output of a periodically\ndriven quantum heat engine into a classical contribution and one stemming\nsolely from quantum coherence. Specializing to Lindblad-dynamics and small\ndriving amplitudes, we derive general upper bounds on both, the coherent and\nthe total power. These constraints imply that, in the linear-response regime,\ncoherence inevitably leads to power losses. To illustrate our general analysis,\nwe explicitly work out the experimentally relevant example of a single-qubit\nengine.\n", "  MXB 1659-298 is a transient neutron star Low-Mass X-ray binary system that\nshows eclipses with a periodicity of 7.1 hr. The source went to outburst in\nAugust 2015 after 14 years of quiescence. We investigate the orbital properties\nof this source with a baseline of 40 years obtained combining the eight eclipse\narrival times present in literature with 51 eclipse arrival times collected\nduring the last two outbursts. A quadratic ephemeris does not fit the delays\nassociated with the eclipse arrival times and the addition of a sinusoidal term\nwith a period of $2.31 \\pm 0.02$ yr is required. We infer a binary orbital\nperiod of $P=7.1161099(3)$ hr and an orbital period derivative of\n$\\dot{P}=-8.5(1.2) \\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. We show that the large orbital\nperiod derivative can be explained with a highly non conservative mass transfer\nscenario in which more than 98\\% of the mass provided by the companion star\nleaves the binary system. We predict an orbital period derivative value of\n$\\dot{P}=-6(3) \\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$ and constrain the companion star\nmass between $\\sim$0.3 and $ 0.9 \\pm 0.3$ M$_{\\odot}$. Assuming that the\ncompanion star is in thermal equilibrium the periodic modulation can be due to\neither a gravitational quadrupole coupling due to variations of the oblateness\nof the companion star or with the presence of a third body of mass M$_3 >21 $\nJovian masses.\n", "  The first detected gravitational wave signal, GW150914, was produced by the\ncoalescence of a stellar-mass binary black hole. Along with the subsequent\ndetection of GW151226, GW170104 and the candidate event LVT151012, this gives\nus evidence for a population of black hole binaries with component masses in\nthe tens of solar masses. As detector sensitivity improves, this type of source\nis expected to make a large contribution to the overall number of detections,\nbut has received little attention compared to binary neutron star systems in\nstudies of projected network performance. We simulate the observation of a\nsystem like GW150914 with different proposed network configurations, and study\nthe precision of parameter estimates, particularly source location, orientation\nand masses. We find that the improvements to low frequency sensitivity that are\nexpected with continued commissioning will improve the precision of chirp mass\nestimates by an order of magnitude, whereas the improvements in sky location\nand orientation are driven by the expanded network configuration. This\ndemonstrates that both sensitivity and number of detectors will be important\nfactors in the scientific potential of second generation detector networks.\n", "  Electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role in the structure and\nfunction of proteins. Due to ionizable amino acid residues present on the\nsolvent-exposed surfaces of proteins, the protein charge is not constant but\nvaries with the changes in the environment -- most notably, the pH of the\nsurrounding solution. We study the effects of pH on the charge of four globular\nproteins by expanding their surface charge distributions in terms of\nmultipoles. The detailed representation of the charges on the proteins is in\nthis way replaced by the magnitudes and orientations of the multipole moments\nof varying order. Focusing on the three lowest-order multipoles -- the total\ncharge, dipole, and quadrupole moment -- we show that the value of pH\ninfluences not only their magnitudes, but more notably and importantly also the\nspatial orientation of their principal axes. Our findings imply important\nconsequences for the study of protein-protein interactions and the assembly of\nboth proteinaceous shells and patchy colloids with dissociable charge groups.\n", "  Very recently, the experimental demonstration of Quantum Secure Direct\nCommunication (QSDC) with state-of-the-art atomic quantum memory has been\nreported (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2017). Quantum Dialogue (QD) falls under QSDC where\nthe secrete messages are communicated simultaneously between two legitimate\nparties. The successful experimental demonstration of QSDC opens up the\npossibilities for practical implementation of QD protocols. Thus, it is\nnecessary to analyze the practical security issues of QD protocols for future\nimplementation. Since the very first proposal for QD by Nguyen (Phys. Lett. A,\n2004) a large number of variants and extensions have been presented till date.\nHowever, all of those leak half of the secret bits to the adversary through\nclassical communications of the measurement results. In this direction,\nmotivated by the idea of Lo et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2012), we propose a\nMeasurement Device Independent Quantum Dialogue (MDI-QD) scheme which is\nresistant to such information leakage as well as side channel attacks. In the\nproposed protocol, Alice and Bob, two legitimate parties, are allowed to\nprepare the states only. The states are measured by an untrusted third party\n(UTP) who may himself behave as an adversary. We show that our protocol is\nsecure under this adversarial model. The current protocol does not require any\nquantum memory and thus it is inherently robust against memory attacks. Such\nrobustness might not be guaranteed in the QSDC protocol with quantum memory\n(Phys. Rev. Lett., 2017).\n", "  A fundamental issue concerning iron-based superconductivity is the roles of\nelectronic nematicity and magnetism in realising high transition temperature\n($T_{\\rm c}$). To address this issue, FeSe is a key material, as it exhibits a\nunique pressure phase diagram involving nonmagnetic nematic and\npressure-induced antiferromagnetic ordered phases. However, as these two phases\nin FeSe overlap with each other, the effects of two orders on superconductivity\nremain perplexing. Here we construct the three-dimensional electronic phase\ndiagram, temperature ($T$) against pressure ($P$) and isovalent S-substitution\n($x$), for FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$, in which we achieve a complete separation of\nnematic and antiferromagnetic phases. In between, an extended nonmagnetic\ntetragonal phase emerges, where we find a striking enhancement of $T_{\\rm c}$.\nThe completed phase diagram uncovers two superconducting domes with similarly\nhigh $T_{\\rm c}$ on both ends of the dome-shaped antiferromagnetic phase. The\n$T_{\\rm c}(P,x)$ variation implies that nematic fluctuations unless\naccompanying magnetism are not relevant for high-$T_{\\rm c}$ superconductivity\nin this system.\n", "  It is well-known that if we gauge a $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry in two\ndimensions, a dual $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry appears, such that re-gauging this\ndual $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry leads back to the original theory. We describe how\nthis can be generalized to non-Abelian groups, by enlarging the concept of\nsymmetries from those defined by groups to those defined by unitary fusion\ncategories. We will see that this generalization is also useful when studying\nwhat happens when a non-anomalous subgroup of an anomalous finite group is\ngauged: for example, the gauged theory can have non-Abelian group symmetry even\nwhen the original symmetry is an Abelian group. We then discuss the\naxiomatization of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories whose\nsymmetry is given by a category. We see explicitly that the gauged version is a\ntopological quantum field theory with a new symmetry given by a dual category.\n", "  We consider a baryogenesis scenario via the oscillation of right-handed\nneutrinos with Majorana masses of the order of GeV, which are also responsible\nfor neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism. We study how the initial condition\nalters the prediction of the present baryon asymmetry by this mechanism. It is\nusually assumed that the abundance of right-handed neutrinos is zero after the\nreheating of the inflationary universe and they are produced in scattering\nprocesses by the renomalizable Yukawa interaction. However, the\nhigher-dimensional operator with right-handed neutrinos may provide an\nadditional production which is most effective at the reheating epoch. It is\nshown that such an initial abundance of right-handed neutrinos can\nsignificantly modify the prediction when the strong washout of the asymmetry is\nabsent. This leads to the parameter space of the model for the successful\nbaryogenesis being enlarged.\n", "  With the introduction of superconducting circuits into the field of quantum\noptics, many novel experimental demonstrations of the quantum physics of an\nartificial atom coupled to a single-mode light field have been realized.\nEngineering such quantum systems offers the opportunity to explore extreme\nregimes of light-matter interaction that are inaccessible with natural systems.\nFor instance the coupling strength $g$ can be increased until it is comparable\nwith the atomic or mode frequency $\\omega_{a,m}$ and the atom can be coupled to\nmultiple modes which has always challenged our understanding of light-matter\ninteraction. Here, we experimentally realize the first Transmon qubit in the\nultra-strong coupling regime, reaching coupling ratios of $g/\\omega_{m}=0.19$\nand we measure multi-mode interactions through a hybridization of the qubit up\nto the fifth mode of the resonator. This is enabled by a qubit with 88% of its\ncapacitance formed by a vacuum-gap capacitance with the center conductor of a\ncoplanar waveguide resonator. In addition to potential applications in quantum\ninformation technologies due to its small size and localization of electric\nfields in vacuum, this new architecture offers the potential to further explore\nthe novel regime of multi-mode ultra-strong coupling.\n", "  Metal--organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of chemically diverse\nmaterials, with applications in a wide range of fields covering engineering,\nphysics, chemistry, biology and medicine. Research so far has focused almost\nentirely on crystalline structures, yet a clear trend has emerged shifting the\nemphasis onto disordered states of MOFs, including \"defective by design\"\ncrystals, as well as amorphous phases such as glasses and gels. Here we\nintroduce a MOF liquid, a strongly associated liquid obtained by melting a\nzeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), with retention of chemical configuration,\ncoordinative bonding modes, and porosity of the parent crystalline framework.\nWe combine in-situ variable temperature X-ray, ex-situ neutron pair\ndistribution function experiments, and first principles molecular dynamics\nsimulations to study the melting phenomenon and the nature of the liquid\nobtained, focusing on structural characterization at the molecular scale,\ndynamics of the species, and thermodynamics of the solid--liquid transition.\n", "  Supernova cosmology without spectra will be an important component of future\nsurveys such as LSST. This lack of supernova spectra results in uncertainty in\nthe redshifts which, if ignored, leads to significantly biased estimates of\ncosmological parameters. Here we present a hierarchical Bayesian formalism --\nzBEAMS -- that addresses this problem by marginalising over the unknown or\nuncertain supernova redshifts to produce unbiased cosmological estimates that\nare competitive with supernova data with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts.\nzBEAMS provides a unified treatment of both photometric redshifts and host\ngalaxy misidentification (occurring due to chance galaxy alignments or faint\nhosts), effectively correcting the inevitable contamination in the Hubble\ndiagram. Like its predecessor BEAMS, our formalism also takes care of non-Ia\nsupernova contamination by marginalising over the unknown supernova type. We\nillustrate this technique with simulations of supernovae with photometric\nredshifts and host galaxy misidentification. A novel feature of the photometric\nredshift case is the important role played by the redshift distribution of the\nsupernovae.\n", "  With the increase in energy of the Large Hadron Collider to a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV for Run 2, events with dense environments, such as in the\ncores of high-energy jets, became a focus for new physics searches as well as\nmeasurements of the Standard Model. These environments are characterized by\ncharged-particle separations of the order of the tracking detectors sensor\ngranularity. Basic track quantities are compared between 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of data\ncollected by the ATLAS experiment and simulation of proton-proton collisions\nproducing high-transverse-momentum jets at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.\nThe impact of charged-particle separations and multiplicities on the track\nreconstruction performance is discussed. The efficiency in the cores of jets\nwith transverse momenta between 200 GeV and 1600 GeV is quantified using a\nnovel, data-driven, method. The method uses the energy loss, dE/dx, to identify\npixel clusters originating from two charged particles. Of the charged particles\ncreating these clusters, the measured fraction that fail to be reconstructed is\n$0.061 \\pm 0.006 \\textrm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.014 \\textrm{(syst.)}$ and $0.093 \\pm\n0.017 \\textrm{(stat.)}\\pm 0.021 \\textrm{(syst.)}$ for jet transverse momenta of\n200-400 GeV and 1400-1600 GeV, respectively.\n", "  We study graphene quantum point contacts (QPC) and imaging of the\nbackscattering of the Fermi level wave function by potential introduced by a\nscanning probe. We consider both etched single-layer QPCs as well as the ones\nformed by bilayer patches deposited at the sides of the monolayer conducting\nchannel using an atomistic tight binding approach. A computational method is\ndeveloped to effectively simulate an infinite graphene plane outside the QPC\nusing a computational box of a finite size. We demonstrate that in spite of the\nKlein phenomenon interference due to the backscattering at a circular n-p\njunction induced by the probe potential is visible in spatial maps of\nconductance as functions of the probe position.\n", "  We demonstrate the reduction of the inhomogeneous linewidth of the free\nexcitons in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)\nMoSe$_{2}$, WSe$_{2}$ and MoS$_{2}$ by encapsulation within few nanometer thick\nhBN. Encapsulation is shown to result in a significant reduction of the 10K\nexcitonic linewidths down to $\\sim3.5 \\text{ meV}$ for n-MoSe$_{2}$, $\\sim5.0\n\\text{ meV}$ for p-WSe$_{2}$ and $\\sim4.8 \\text{ meV}$ for n-MoS$_{2}$.\nEvidence is obtained that the hBN environment effectively lowers the Fermi\nlevel since the relative spectral weight shifts towards the neutral exciton\nemission in n-doped TMDCs and towards charged exciton emission in p-doped\nTMDCs. Moreover, we find that fully encapsulated MoS$_{2}$ shows resolvable\nexciton and trion emission even after high power density excitation in contrast\nto non-encapsulated materials. Our findings suggest that encapsulation of\nmechanically exfoliated few-monolayer TMDCs within nanometer thick hBN\ndramatically enhances optical quality, producing ultra-narrow linewidths that\napproach the homogeneous limit.\n", "  We report high resolution ARPES measurements of detwinned FeSe single\ncrystals. The application of a mechanical strain is used to promote the volume\nfraction of one of the orthorhombic domains in the sample, which we estimate to\nbe 80$\\%$ detwinned. While the full structure of the electron pockets\nconsisting of two crossed ellipses may be observed in the tetragonal phase at\ntemperatures above 90~K, we find that remarkably, only one peanut-shaped\nelectron pocket oriented along the longer $a$ axis contributes to the ARPES\nmeasurement at low temperatures in the nematic phase, with the expected pocket\nalong $b$ being not observed. Thus the low temperature Fermi surface of FeSe as\nexperimentally determined by ARPES consists of one elliptical hole pocket and\none orthogonally-oriented peanut-shaped electron pocket. Our measurements\nclarify the long-standing controversies over the interpretation of ARPES\nmeasurements of FeSe.\n", "  We consider the eternal inflation scenario of the slow-roll/chaotic type with\nthe additional element of an objective collapse of the wave function. The\nincorporation of this new agent to the traditional inflationary setting might\nrepresent a possible solution to the quantum measurement problem during\ninflation, a subject that has not reached a consensus among the community.\nSpecifically, it could provide an explanation for the generation of the\nprimordial anisotropies and inhomogeneities, starting from a perfectly\nsymmetric background and invoking symmetric dynamics. We adopt the continuous\nspontaneous localization model, in the context of inflation, as the dynamical\nreduction mechanism that generates the primordial inhomogeneities. Furthermore,\nwhen enforcing the objective reduction mechanism, the condition for eternal\ninflation can be bypassed. In particular, the collapse mechanism incites the\nwave function, corresponding to the inflaton, to localize itself around the\nzero mode of the field. Then the zero mode will evolve essentially unperturbed,\ndriving inflation to an end in any region of the Universe where inflation\noccurred. Also, our approach achieves a primordial spectrum with an amplitude\nand shape consistent with the one that best fits the observational data.\n", "  Many body localization (MBL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nunderstanding non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Folklore based on perturbative\narguments holds that MBL only arises in systems with short range interactions.\nHere we advance non-perturbative arguments indicating that MBL can arise in\nsystems with long range (Coulomb) interactions. In particular, we show using\nbosonization that MBL can arise in one dimensional systems with ~ r\ninteractions, a problem that exhibits charge confinement. We also argue that\n(through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism) MBL can arise in two dimensional systems\nwith log r interactions, and speculate that our arguments may even extend to\nthree dimensional systems with 1/r interactions. Our arguments are `asymptotic'\n(i.e. valid up to rare region corrections), yet they open the door to\ninvestigation of MBL physics in a wide array of long range interacting systems\nwhere such physics was previously believed not to arise.\n", "  We study the time evolution after a quantum quench in a family of models\nwhose degrees of freedom are fermions coupled to spins, where quenched disorder\nappears neither in the Hamiltonian parameters nor in the initial state.\nFocussing on the behaviour of entanglement, both spatial and between\nsubsystems, we show that the model supports a state exhibiting combined\narea/volume law entanglement, being characteristic of the quantum disentangled\nliquid. This behaviour appears for one set of variables, which is related via a\nduality mapping to another set, where this structure is absent. Upon adding\ndensity interactions between the fermions, we identify an exact mapping to an\nXXZ spin-chain in a random binary magnetic field, thereby establishing the\nexistence of many-body localization with its logarithmic entanglement growth in\na fully disorder-free system.\n", "  The strong decays of the two resonances $\\eta(2225)$ and $\\phi(2170)$ are\ndiscussed for selected decay channels. The two resonances are considered as the\n$\\Lambda \\bar{\\Lambda}$ bound states in the molecular scenario. The\nphenomenological hadronic molecular approach is employed for the calculation of\nrespective decay modes using effective Lagrangians. Our results show that the\ndecay modes $\\eta(2225)\\to K^*K$ and $\\phi(2175) \\to KK$ dominate over the\npartial decay widths of $\\eta(2275)\\to VV (\\phi\\phi, \\omega\\omega, K^*K^*)$ and\n$\\phi(2175)\\to VS (\\omega\\sigma, K^*K^*_0(800), \\phi f_0(980))$ due to phase\nspace and couplings.\n", "  We calculate the corrections for constant radial magnetic field in muon g--2\nand electric-dipole-moment experiments in storage rings. While the correction\nis negligible for the current generation of g--2 experiments, it affects the\nupcoming muon electric-dipole-moment experiment at Fermilab.\n", "  The general theoretical description of the influence of oscillating\nhorizontal magnetic and quasimagnetic fields on the spin evolution in storage\nrings is presented. Previous results are generalized to the case when both of\nthe horizontal components of the oscillating field are nonzero and the vector\nof this field circumscribes an ellipse. General equations describing a behavior\nof all components of the polarization vector are derived and the case of an\narbitrary initial polarization is considered. The derivation is fulfilled in\nthe case when the oscillation frequency is nonresonant. The general spin\nevolution in storage rings conditioned by vertical betatron oscillations is\ncalculated as an example.\n", "  Using a numerically exact method we study the stability of dynamical\nlocalization to the addition of interactions in a periodically driven isolated\nquantum system which conserves only the total number of particles. We find that\nwhile even infinitesimally small interactions destroy dynamical localization,\nfor weak interactions density transport is significantly suppressed and is\nasymptotically diffusive, with a diffusion coefficient proportional to the\ninteraction strength. For systems tuned away from the dynamical localization\npoint, even slightly, transport is dramatically enhanced and within the largest\naccessible systems sizes a diffusive regime is only pronounced for sufficiently\nsmall detunings.\n", "  This introductory paper studies a class of real analytic functions on the\nupper half plane satisfying a certain modular transformation property. They are\nnot eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and are quite distinct from Maass forms.\nThese functions are modular equivariant versions of real and imaginary parts of\niterated integrals of holomorphic modular forms, and are modular analogues of\nsingle-valued polylogarithms. The coefficients of these functions in a suitable\npower series expansion are periods. They are related both to mixed motives\n(iterated extensions of pure motives of classical modular forms), as well as\nthe modular graph functions arising in genus one string perturbation theory. In\nan appendix, we use weakly holomorphic modular forms to write down modular\nprimitives of cusp forms. Their coefficients involve the full period matrix\n(periods and quasi-periods) of cusp forms.\n", "  The light absorption due to the transitions between the edge and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) states of a 2D topological insulator (TI) is considered in\nthe Volkov-Pankratov model. It is shown that the transitions are allowed only\nfor the in-plane electric field orthogonal to the edge of the TI. It is found\nthat the absorption is accompanied by the pure spin photocurrent along the TI\nedge. The possibility of the spin current measurement using polarized\nluminescence from 2D TI quantum dots is discussed.\n", "  The structure and density dependence of the pairing gap in infinite matter is\nrelevant for astrophysical phenomena and provides a starting point for the\ndiscussion of pairing properties in nuclear structure. Short-range correlations\ncan significantly deplete the available single-particle strength around the\nFermi surface and thus provide a reduction mechanism of the pairing gap. Here,\nwe study this effect in the singlet and triplet channels of both neutron matter\nand symmetric nuclear matter. Our calculations use phase-shift equivalent\ninteractions and chiral two-body and three-body interactions as a starting\npoint. We find an unambiguous reduction of the gap in all channels with very\nsmall dependence on the NN force in the singlet neutron matter and the triplet\nnuclear matter channel. In the latter channel, short range correlations alone\nprovide a 50% reduction of the pairing gap.\n", "  The main result of this paper states that if $(N, \\Pi)$ is a pair of\nindependent point processes on a common ground space with $N$ Poisson and $\\Pi$\ndeterminantal induced by a locally trace class (not necessarily self-adjoint)\ncorrelation kernel, then their independent superposition $N + \\Pi$ determines\nuniquely the distributions of $N$ and $\\Pi$.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the sine-Gordon model after a quantum quench into\nthe attractive regime, where the spectrum consists of solitons, antisolitons\nand breathers. In particular, we analyse the time-dependent expectation value\nof the vertex operator, $\\exp\\left({\\rm i}\\beta\\Phi/2\\right)$, starting from an\ninitial state in the \"squeezed state form\" corresponding to integrable boundary\nconditions. Using an expansion in terms of exact form factors, we compute\nanalytically the leading contributions to this expectation value at late times.\nWe show that form factors containing breathers only contribute to the late-time\ndynamics if the initial state exhibits zero-momentum breather states. The\nleading terms at late times exponentially decay, and we compute the different\ndecay rates. In addition, the late-time contributions from the zero-momentum\nbreathers display oscillatory behaviour, with the oscillation frequency given\nby the breather mass renormalised by interaction effects. Using our result, we\ncompute the low-energy contributions to the power spectrum of the vertex\noperator. The oscillatory terms in the expectation value are shown to produce\nsmooth peaks in the power spectrum located near the values of the bare breather\nmasses.\n", "  The local crystal structures of many perovskite-structured materials deviate\nfrom the average space group symmetry. We demonstrate, from lattice-dynamics\ncalculations based on quantum chemical force constants, that all the\ncaesium-lead and caesium-tin halide perovskites exhibit vibrational\ninstabilities associated with octahedral titling in their high-temperature\ncubic phase. Anharmonic double-well potentials are found for zone-boundary\nphonon modes in all compounds with barriers ranging from 108 to 512 meV. The\nwell depth is correlated with the tolerance factor and the chemistry of the\ncomposition, but is not proportional to the imaginary harmonic phonon\nfrequency. We provide quantitative insights into the thermodynamic driving\nforces and distinguish between dynamic and static disorder based on the\npotential-energy landscape. A positive band gap deformation (spectral\nblueshift) accompanies the structural distortion, with implications for\nunderstanding the performance of these materials in applications areas\nincluding solar cells and light-emitting diodes.\n", "  We consider the three dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system that is equipped with\nan external magnetic field to describe a plasma. The aim of various concrete\napplications is to control a plasma in a desired fashion. This can be modeled\nby an optimal control problem. For that reason the basics for calculus of\nvariations will be introduced in this paper. We have to find a suitable class\nof fields that are admissible for this procedure as they provide unique global\nsolutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system. Then we can define a field-state\noperator that maps any admissible field onto its corresponding distribution\nfunction. We will show that this field-state operator is Lipschitz continuous\nand (weakly) compact. Last we will consider a model problem with a tracking\ntype cost functional and we will show that this optimal control problem has at\nleast one globally optimal solution.\n", "  In the paper \"Optimal control of a Vlasov-Poisson plasma by an external\nmagnetic field - The basics for variational calculus\" [arXiv:1708.02464] we\nhave already introduced a set of admissible magnetic fields and we have proved\nthat each of those fields induces a unique strong solution of the\nVlasov-Poisson system. We have also established that the field-state operator\nthat maps any admissible field onto its corresponding solution is continuous\nand weakly compact. In this paper we will show that this operator is also\nFr\\'echet differentiable and we will continue to analyze the optimal control\nproblem that was introduced in [arXiv:1708.02464]. More precisely, we will\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for local optimality and we will\nshow that an optimal solution is unique under certain conditions.\n", "  We show that the inferred merger rate and chirp masses of binary black holes\n(BBHs) detected by advanced LIGO (aLIGO) can be used to constrain the rate of\ndouble neutron star (DNS) and neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers in the\nuniverse. We explicitly demonstrate this by considering a set of publicly\navailable population synthesis models of \\citet{Dominik:2012kk} and show that\nif all the BBH mergers, GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, and GW170104, observed\nby aLIGO arise from isolated binary evolution, the predicted DNS merger rate\nmay be constrained to be $2.3-471.0$~\\rate~ and that of NSBH mergers will be\nconstrained to $0.2-48.5$~\\rate. The DNS merger rates are not constrained much\nbut the NSBH rates are tightened by a factor of $\\sim 4$ as compared to their\nprevious rates. Note that these constrained DNS and NSBH rates are extremely\nmodel dependent and are compared to the unconstrained values $2.3-472.5$ \\rate~\nand $0.2-218$ \\rate, respectively, using the same models of\n\\citet{Dominik:2012kk}. These rate estimates may have implications for short\nGamma Ray Burst progenitor models assuming they are powered (solely) by DNS or\nNSBH mergers. While these results are based on a set of open access population\nsynthesis models which may not necessarily be the representative ones, the\nproposed method is very general and can be applied to any number of models\nthereby yielding more realistic constraints on the DNS and NSBH merger rates\nfrom the inferred BBH merger rate and chirp mass.\n", "  We determine the hyperon vector couplings $f_1(0)$ for $\\Sigma^{-}\\rightarrow\nnl^-\\bar{\\nu_l}$ and $\\Xi^0\\rightarrow\\Sigma^{+}l^-\\bar{\\nu_l}$ semileptonic\ndecays in the continuum limit with (2+1)-flavors of dynamical domain-wall\nfermions, using the Iwasaki gauge action at two different lattice spacings of\n$a$=0.114(2) and 0.086(2) fm. A theoretical estimation of flavor SU(3)-breaking\neffect on the vector coupling is required to extract $V_{us}$ from the\nexperimental rate of hyperon beta decays. We obtain the vector couplings\n$f_1(0)$ for $\\Sigma\\rightarrow N$ and $\\Xi\\rightarrow \\Sigma$ beta-decays with\nan accuracy of less than one percent. We then find that lattice results of\n$f_1(0)$ combined with the best estimate of $|V_{us}|$ with imposing\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity are slightly deviated from the\nexperimental result of $|V_{us}f_1(0)|$ for the $\\Sigma\\rightarrow N$\nbeta-decay. This discrepancy can be attributed to an assumption made in the\nexperimental analysis on $|V_{us}f_1(0)|$, where the induced second-class form\nfactor $g_2$ is set to be zero regardless of broken SU(3) symmetry. We report\non this matter and then estimate the possible value of $g_2(0)$, which is\nevaluated from the experimental decay rate with our lattice result of $f_1(0)$\nunder the first-row CKM-unitarity condition.\n", "  We investigate the particle production from thermal gravitational\nannihilation in the very early universe, which is an important contribution for\nparticles that might not be in thermal equilibrium or/and only have\ngravitational interaction, such as dark matter (DM). For particles with spin 0,\n1/2 and 1 we calculate the relevant cross sections through gravitational\nannihilation and give the analytic formulas with full mass-dependent terms. We\nfind that DM with mass between TeV and $10^{16}$GeV could have the relic\nabundance that fits the observation, with small dependence on its spin. We also\ndiscuss the effects of gravitational annihilation from inflatons.\nInterestingly, contributions from inflatons could be dominant and have the same\npower dependence on Hubble parameter of inflation as that from vacuum\nfluctuation. Also, fermion production from inflatons, in comparison to boson,\nis suppressed by its mass due to helicity selection.\n", "  We propose a new class of tight-binding models where a flat band is either\ngapped from or crossing right through a dispersive band on two-band (i.e., two\nsites/unit cell) tetragonal and honeycomb lattices. By imposing a condition on\nthe hopping parameters for generic models with up to third-neighbor hoppings,\nwe first obtain models having a rigorously flat band isolated from a dispersive\nband with a gap, which accommodate both rank-reducing and non-rank-reducing of\nthe Hamiltonian. The class of models include Tasaki's flat-band models, but the\npresent model has a nonzero flat-band energy, whose gap from the dispersive\nband is controllable as well. We then modify the models by appropriately\nchanging the second- or third-neighbor hoppings, leading to a new class of\ntwo-dimensional lattices where a (slightly warped) flat band pierces a\ndispersive one. As with the known flat-band models, the connectivity condition\nis satisfied in the present models, so that we have unusual, unorthogonalizable\nWannier orbitals. We have also shown that the present flat-band model can be\nextended to three (or higher) dimensions. Implications on possible high-$T_{C}$\nsuperconductivity are discussed when a repulsive electron-electron interaction\nis introduced, where the flat band is envisaged to be utilized as intermediate\nstates in pair scattering processes.\n", "  Polymer bottlebrushes provide intriguing features being relevant both in\nnature and in synthetic systems. While their presence in the articular\ncartilage optimizes synovial joint lubrication, bottlebrushes offer pathways\nfor fascinating applications, such as within super- soft elastomers or for drug\ndelivery. However, the current theoretical understanding lacks completeness,\nprimarily due to the complicated interplay of many length scales. Herein, we\ndevelop an analytical model that demonstrates how structural properties of\nbottlebrushes depend on the concentration, ranging from dilute solutions to\nhighly concentrated melts. The validity of our model is supported by data from\nextensive molecular dynamics simulation. We demonstrate that the hierarchical\nstructure of bottlebrushes dictates a sequence of conformational changes as the\nsolution concentration increases. The effect is mediated by screening\nofexcluded volume interactions atsubsequent structural parts ofthe\nbottlebrushes. Our findings provide important insights that should enable\nimproved customization of novel materials based on the architectural design of\npolymer bottlebrushes.\n", "  In this paper we compare the mass function slopes of Galactic globular\nclusters recently determined by Sollima & Baumgardt (2017) with a set of\ndedicated N-body simulations of star clusters containing between 65,000 to\n200,000 stars. We study clusters starting with a range of initial mass\nfunctions (IMFs), black hole retention fractions and orbital parameters in the\nparent galaxy. We find that the present-day mass functions of globular clusters\nagree well with those expected for star clusters starting with Kroupa or\nChabrier IMFs, and are incompatible with clusters starting with single\npower-law mass functions for the low-mass stars. The amount of mass segregation\nseen in the globular clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt (2017) can be\nfully explained by two-body relaxation driven mass segregation from initially\nunsegregated star clusters. Based on the present-day global mass functions, we\nexpect that a typical globular cluster in our sample has lost about 75% of its\nmass since formation, while the most evolved clusters have already lost more\nthan 90% of their initial mass and should dissolve within the next 1 to 2 Gyr.\nMost clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt also show a large difference\nbetween their central and global MF slopes, implying that the majority of\nGalactic globular clusters is either near or already past core collapse. The\nstrong mass segregation seen in most clusters also implies that only a small\nfraction of all black holes formed in globular clusters still reside in them.\n", "  The development of two-dimensional (2D) bulge-to-disk decomposition\ntechniques has shown their advantages over traditional one-dimensional (1D)\ntechniques, especially for galaxies with non-axisymmetric features. However,\nthe full potential of 2D techniques has yet to be fully exploited. Secondary\nmorphological features in nearby disk galaxies, such as bars, lenses, rings,\ndisk breaks, and spiral arms, are seldom accounted for in 2D image\ndecompositions, even though some image-fitting codes, such as GALFIT, are\ncapable of handling them. We present detailed, 2D multi-model and\nmulti-component decomposition of high-quality $R$-band images of a\nrepresentative sample of nearby disk galaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine\nGalaxy Survey, using the latest version of GALFIT. The sample consists of five\nbarred and five unbarred galaxies, spanning Hubble types from S0 to Sc.\nTraditional 1D decomposition is also presented for comparison. In detailed case\nstudies of the 10 galaxies, we successfully model the secondary morphological\nfeatures. Through a comparison of best-fit parameters obtained from different\ninput surface brightness models, we identify morphological features that\nsignificantly impact bulge measurements. We show that nuclear and inner\nlenses/rings and disk breaks must be properly taken into account to obtain\naccurate bulge parameters, whereas outer lenses/rings and spiral arms have a\nnegligible effect. We provide an optimal strategy to measure bulge parameters\nof typical disk galaxies, as well as prescriptions to estimate realistic\nuncertainties of them, which will benefit subsequent decomposition of a larger\ngalaxy sample.\n", "  At zero temperature, the charge current operator appears to be conserved,\nwithin linear response, in certain holographic probe brane models of strange\nmetals. At small but finite temperature, we analytically show that the weak\nnon-conservation of this current leads to both a collective \"zero sound\" mode\nand a Drude peak in the electrical conductivity. This simultaneously resolves\ntwo outstanding puzzles about probe brane theories. The nonlinear dynamics of\nthe current operator itself appears qualitatively different.\n", "  The analysis of two-ordinary-meson scattering amplitudes in the limit of a\nlarge number $N_{\\rm c}$ of the colour degrees of freedom of quantum\nchromodynamics, with suitably decreasing strong coupling and all quarks\ntransforming according to the gauge group's fundamental representation, enables\nus to establish a set of rigorous consistency conditions for the emergence of a\ntetraquark (i.e., a bound state of two quarks and two antiquarks) as a pole in\nthese amplitudes. For genuinely flavour-exotic tetraquarks, these constraints\nrequire the existence of two tetraquark states distinguishable by their\npreferred couplings to two ordinary mesons, whereas, for cryptoexotic\ntetraquarks, our constraints may be satisfied by a single tetraquark state,\nwhich then, however, may mix with ordinary mesons. For elucidation of the\ntetraquark features, the consideration of the subleading contributions proves\nto be mandatory: for both variants of tetraquarks, their decay widths fall off\nlike $1/N_{\\rm c}^2$ for large $N_{\\rm c}.$\n", "  Based on a recent numerical simulation of the temporal evolution of a\nspherically perturbed BPS monopole, SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics, Louis de\nBroglie's deliberations on the disparate Lorentz transformations of the\nfrequency of an internal \"clock\" on one hand and the associated quantum energy\non the other hand, and postulating that the electron is represented by a\nfigure-eight shaped, self-intersecting center vortex loop in SU(2) Quantum\nYang-Mills theory we estimate the spatial radius $R_0$ of this\nself-intersection region in terms of the electron's Compton wave length\n$\\lambda_C$. This region, which is immersed into the confining phase,\nconstitutes a blob of deconfining phase of temperature $T_0$ mildly above the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ carrying a frequently perturbed BPS monopole (with a\nmagnetic-electric dual interpretation of its charge w.r.t. U(1)$\\subset$SU(2)).\nWe also establish a quantitative relation between rest mass $m_0$ of the\nelectron and SU(2) Yang-Mills scale $\\Lambda$, which in turn is defined via\n$T_c$. Surprisingly, $R_0$ turns out to be comparable to the Bohr radius while\nthe core size of the monopole matches $\\lambda_C$, and the correction to the\nmass of the electron due to Coulomb energy is about 2\\,\\%.\n", "  This paper presents the first item response theory (IRT) analysis of the\nnational data set on introductory, general education, college-level astronomy\nteaching using the Light and Spectroscopy Concept Inventory (LSCI). We used the\ndifference between students' pre- and post-instruction IRT-estimated abilities\nas a measure of learning gain. This analysis provides deeper insights than\nprior publications into both the LSCI as an instrument and into the\neffectiveness of teaching and learning in introductory astronomy courses. Our\nIRT analysis supports the classical test theory findings of prior studies using\nthe LSCI with this population. In particular, we found that students in classes\nthat used active learning strategies at least 25\\% of the time had average\nIRT-estimated learning gains that were approximately 1 logit larger than\nstudents in classes that spent less time on active learning strategies. We also\nfound that instructors who want their classes to achieve an improvement in\nabilities of average $\\Delta \\theta = 1$ logit must spend at least 25\\% of\nclass time on active learning strategies. However, our analysis also powerfully\nillustrates the lack of insight into student learning that is revealed by\nlooking at a single measure of learning gain, such as average $\\Delta \\theta$.\nEducators and researchers should also examine the distributions of students'\nabilities pre- and post-instruction in order to understand how many students\nactually achieved an improvement in their abilities and whether or not a\nmajority of students have moved to post-abilities significantly greater than\nthe national average.\n", "  We propose a method for finding an initial state vector which by ordinary\nHamiltonian time evolution follows a single branch of many-worlds quantum\nmechanics. The resulting deterministic system appears to exhibit random\nbehavior as a result of the successive emergence over time of information\npresent in the initial state but not previously observed.\n", "  We analyse the emergence of Kovacs-like memory effects in athermal systems\nwithin the linear response regime. This is done by starting from both the\nmaster equation for the probability distribution and the equations for the\nphysically relevant moments. The general results are applied to a general class\nof models with conserved momentum and non-conserved energy. Our theoretical\npredictions, obtained within the first Sonine approximation, show an excellent\nagreement with the numerical results.\n", "  A recent derivation of the interpolation between the free energy and\nconformal anomaly for free fields on spheres is generalised to hemispheres with\nNeumann (N) and Dirichlet (D) conditions at the rim for GJMS scalar fields. It\nis shown that the N minus D interpolation is minus a quarter of that for a\nhigher derivative fermion on the spherical rim. In particular, since, for\nordinary bosons k=1, the related fermion is irregular propagating according to\na second order (pseudo) operator. (2k is the derivative order in the equation\nof motion.)\n  It is suggested that the relation has a role to play in the Type--B AdS/CFT\nmismatch. The DN boundary value problem is enlarged upon in the context of\nBranson and Gover's construction of the D to N operator. Contact is made with a\nresult of Park and Wojciechowski which is then related to a duality relation of\nBarvinsky and Nesterov.\n", "  TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are nowadays considered fundamental building blocks\nfor many technological applications. Morphology is found to play a key role\nwith spherical NPs presenting higher binding properties and chemical activity.\nFrom the experimental point of view, the characterization of these nano-objects\nis extremely complex, opening a large room for computational investigations. In\nthis work, TiO2 spherical NPs of different size (from 300 to 4000 atoms) have\nbeen studied with a two-scale computational approach. Global optimization to\nobtain stable and equilibrated NSs was performed with a self-consistent charge\ndensity functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) simulated annealing process,\ncausing a considerable atomic rearrangement within the nanospheres. Those\nSCC-DFTB relaxed structures have been then optimized at DFT(B3LYP) level of\ntheory. We present a systematic and comparative SCC-DFTB vs DFT(B3LYP) study of\nthe structural properties, with particular emphasis on the surface-to-bulk\nsites ratio, coordination distribution of surface sites and surface energy.\nFrom the electronic point of view, we compare HOMO-LUMO and Kohn-Sham gaps,\ntotal and projected density of states. Overall, the comparisons between DFTB\nand hybrid DFT show that DFTB provides a rather accurate geometrical and\nelectronic description of these nanospheres of realistic size (up to a diameter\nof 4.4 nm) at an extremely reduced computational cost. This opens for new\nchallenges in simulations of very large systems and more extended molecular\ndynamics.\n", "  The theory of mirror matter predicts a hidden sector made up of a copy of the\nStandard Model particles and interactions but with opposite parity. If mirror\nmatter interacts with ordinary matter, there could be experimentally accessible\nimplications in the form of neutral particle oscillations. Direct searches for\nneutron oscillations into mirror neutrons in a controlled magnetic field have\npreviously been performed using ultracold neutrons in storage/disappearance\nmeasurements, with some inconclusive results consistent with characteristic\noscillation time of $\\tau$$\\sim$10~s. Here we describe a proposed disappearance\nand regeneration experiment in which the neutron oscillates to and from a\nmirror neutron state. An experiment performed using the existing General\nPurpose-Small Angle Neutron Scattering instrument at the High Flux Isotope\nReactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory could have the sensitivity to exclude\nup to $\\tau$$<$15~s in 1 week of beamtime and at low cost.\n", "  Is the hydrodynamics of an interacting many-body system fundamentally limited\nby basic principles of quantum mechanics? Starting with the conjecture that\nviscosity is at least as large as entropy density (as measured in fundamental\nunits), there has been a long search for a precise answer to this question. In\nthis work, we identify a simple relationship between hydrodynamics and\nmany-body quantum chaos in a broad class of experimentally realizable systems.\nConsistency with the quantum butterfly effect leads to upper bounds on the\nspeed of sound and diffusion constants of hydrodynamics. These bounds link two\nvery different theories of quantum many-body dynamics, clarify the relationship\nbetween classical hydrodynamics and quantum information loss, and provide a\nsimple way to constrain theories of thermalization and quantum chaos in\nexperiments.\n", "  Graphs and recently hypergraphs have been known as an important tool for\nconsidering different properties of quantum many-body systems. In this paper,\nwe study a mapping between an important class of quantum systems namely quantum\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and Ising-like systems by using hypergraphs.\nWe show that the Hamiltonian corresponding to a CSS code on a hypergraph $H$\nwhich is perturbed by a uniform magnetic field is mapped to Hamiltonian of a\nIsing-like system on dual hypergraph $\\tilde{H}$ in a transverse field.\nInterestingly, we show that a strong regime of couplings in one of the systems\nis mapped to a weak regime of couplings in another one. We also give some\napplications for such a mapping where we study robustness of different\ntopological CSS codes against a uniform magnetic field including Kitaev's toric\ncodes defined on graphs and color codes in different dimensions. We show that a\nperturbed Kitaev's toric code on an arbitrary graph is mapped to an Ising model\nin a transverse field on the same graph and a perturbed color code on a D-colex\nis mapped to a Ising-like model on a D-simplicial lattice in a transverse\nfield. In particular, we use these results to explicitly compare the robustness\nof TC on different graphs in different dimensions. Interestingly, our results\nshow that the robustness of such topological codes defined on graphs decreases\nwith increasing dimension. Furthermore, we also use the duality mapping for\nsome self-dual models where we exactly derive the point of phase transition.\n", "  We apply Rademacher's method in order to compute the Fourier coefficients of\na large class of $\\eta$-quotients.\n", "  Microscopic quantum theory of nonlinear stimulated scattering of 2D Dirac\nparticles in doped graphene on Coulomb field of impurity ions at the presence\nof an external strong coherent electromagnetic radiation is developed. We\nconsider high Fermi energies and low frequencies (actually terahertz radiation)\nto exclude the valence electrons excitations. The Liouville-von Neumann\nequation for the density matrix is solved analytically, taking into account the\ninteraction of electrons with the scattering potential in the Born\napproximation. With the help of this solution, the nonlinear\ninverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rate for a grand canonical ensemble of 2D\nDirac fermions is calculated. It is shown that one can achieve the efficient\nabsorption coefficient by this mechanism.\n", "  This is a pedagogical review on the integrability-based approach to the\nthree-point function in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We first discuss\nthe computation of the structure constant at weak coupling and show that the\nresult can be recast as a sum over partitions of the rapidities of the magnons.\nWe then introduce a non-perturbative framework, called the \"hexagon approach\",\nand explain how one can use the symmetries (i.e. superconformal and gauge\nsymmetries) and integrability to determine the structure constants. This\narticle is based on the lectures given in Les Houches Summer School\n\"Integrability: From statistical systems to gauge theory\" in June 2016.\n", "  The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether a proposed\nmathematical formula should be used to detect unconstitutional partisan\ngerrymandering. We show that in some cases, this formula will only flag\nbizarrely shaped districts as potentially constitutional.\n", "  We present a study on the impact of Mn$^{3+}$ substitution in the\ngeometrically frustrated Ising garnet Ho$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ using bulk magnetic\nmeasurements and low temperature powder neutron diffraction. We find that the\ntransition temperature, $T_N$ = 5.8 K, for Ho$_3$MnGa$_4$O$_{12}$ is raised by\nalmost 20 when compared to Ho$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$. Powder neutron diffraction on\nHo$_3$Mn$_x$Ga$_{5-x}$O$_{12}$ ($x$ = 0.5, 1) below $T_N$ shows the formation\nof a long range ordered ordered state with $\\mathbf{k}$ = (0,0,0). Ho$^{3+}$\nspins are aligned antiferromagnetically along the six crystallographic axes\nwith no resultant moment while the Mn$^{3+}$ spins are oriented along the body\ndiagonals, such that there is a net moment along [111]. The magnetic structure\ncan be visualised as ten-membered rings of corner-sharing triangles of\nHo$^{3+}$ spins with the Mn$^{3+}$ spins ferromagnetically coupled to each\nindividual Ho$^{3+}$ spin in the triangle. Substitution of Mn$^{3+}$ completely\nrelieves the magnetic frustration with $f = \\theta_{CW}/T_N \\approx 1.1$ for\nHo$_3$MnGa$_4$O$_{12}$.\n", "  In this paper, we perform the initial and comprehensive study on the problem\nof measuring node relevance on signed social networks. We design numerous\nrelevance measurements for signed social networks from both local and global\nperspectives and investigate the connection between signed relevance\nmeasurements, balance theory and signed network properties. Experimental\nresults are conducted to study the effects of signed relevance measurements\nwith four real-world datasets on signed network analysis tasks.\n", "  Aspects of the preparation process and performance degradation are two major\nproblems of photocathodes. The lack of a means for dynamic quantum efficiency\nmeasurements results in the inability to observe the inhomogeneity of the\ncathode surface by fine structural analysis and in real time.Here we present a\nsimple and scalable technique for in situ real-time quantum efficiency\ndiagnosis. An incoherent light source provides uniform illumination on the\ncathode surface, and solenoid magnets are used as lens for focusing and imaging\nthe emitted electron beam on a downstream scintillator screen, which converts\nthe quantum efficiency information into fluorescence intensity distribution.\nThe microscopic discontinuity and the dynamic changes of the quantum efficiency\nof a gallium arsenide photocathode are observed at a resolution of a few\nmicrons. An unexpected uneven decrease of the quantum efficiency is also\nrecorded. The work demonstrates a new observation method for photoemission\nmaterials research.\n", "  In this paper we study a general framework to perform leading log high energy\nresummation with complete dependence from the rapidity and the transverse\nmomentum of the studied system. As an application, high energy resummed\nexpression for the Higgs boson production in the effective field theory\nframework will be derived. Explicit result for this process will be\ncross-checked against fixed order evaluations up to NNLO. Consistency with\nknown high energy resummation for single differential rapidity or transverse\nmomentum distribution, as well as for inclusive cross section, will also be\nshown.\n", "  The main topic of this thesis is the proof of two fundamental entropic\ninequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels model the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves through optical fibers and free space in\nthe quantum regime, and provide the mathematical model to determine the maximum\nrates achievable by quantum communication devices for communication and quantum\nkey distribution. The first inequality proven in this thesis is the quantum\nEntropy Power Inequality, which provides a lower bound to the output entropy of\nthe beam-splitter or of the squeezing in terms of the entropies of the two\ninputs. The second inequality states that Gaussian states minimize the output\nentropy of the one-mode quantum Gaussian attenuator among all the input states\nwith a given entropy, and was a longstanding conjecture in quantum\ncommunication theory. The generalization of this inequality to the multimode\nattenuator would determine its triple trade-off region and its capacity region\nfor broadcast communication to two receivers. The thesis contains further\nresults in Gaussian quantum information, quantum statistical mechanics and\nrelativistic quantum information. The most important of these results concerns\nthe Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH is an assumption in\nquantum statistical mechanics stating that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian\nof a system+bath compound look as thermal states if we can access only the\nsystem. We prove that the ETH must hold if the system thermalizes for any\ninitial product state of the system+bath compound with a well-defined\ntemperature.\n", "  We introduce a framework for coverings of noncommutative spaces. Moreover, we\nstudy noncommutative coverings of irrational quantum tori and characterize all\nsuch coverings that are connected in a reasonable sense.\n", "  We propose a technique for calculating and understanding the eigenvalue\ndistribution of sums of random matrices from the known distribution of the\nsummands. The exact problem is formidably hard. One extreme approximation to\nthe true density amounts to classical probability, in which the matrices are\nassumed to commute; the other extreme is related to free probability, in which\nthe eigenvectors are assumed to be in generic positions and sufficiently large.\nIn practice, free probability theory can give a good approximation of the\ndensity.\n  We develop a technique based on eigenvector localization/delocalization that\nworks very well for important problems of interest where free probability is\nnot sufficient, but certain uniformity properties apply. The\nlocalization/delocalization property appears in a convex combination parameter\nthat notably, is independent of any eigenvalue properties and yields accurate\neigenvalue density approximations.\n  We demonstrate this technique on a number of examples as well as discuss a\nmore general technique when the uniformity properties fail to apply.\n", "  We develop a theoretical and computational approach to deal with systems that\ninvolve a disparate range of spatio-temporal scales, such as those comprised of\ncolloidal particles or polymers moving in a fluidic molecular environment. Our\napproach is based on a multiscale modeling that combines the slow dynamics of\nthe large particles with the fast dynamics of the solvent into a unique\nframework. The former is numerically solved via Molecular Dynamics and the\nlatter via a multi-component Lattice Boltzmann. The two techniques are coupled\ntogether to allow for a seamless exchange of information between the\ndescriptions. Being based on a kinetic multi-component description of the fluid\nspecies, the scheme is flexible in modeling charge flow within complex\ngeometries and ranging from large to vanishing salt concentration. The details\nof the scheme are presented and the method is applied to the problem of\ntranslocation of a charged polymer through a nanopores. In the end, we discuss\nthe advantages and complexities of the approach.\n", "  The role of interfacial nonidealities and disorder on thermal transport\nacross interfaces is traditionally assumed to add resistance to heat transfer,\ndecreasing the thermal boundary conductance (TBC).$^1$ However, recent\ncomputational works have suggested that interfacial defects can enhance this\nthermal boundary conductance through emergence of unique vibrations that are\nintrinsic to the material interface and defect atoms,$^{2-6}$ a finding that\ncontradicts traditional theory and conventional understanding. By manipulating\nthe local heat flux of atomic vibrations that comprise these interfacial modes,\nin principle, the TBC can be increased. In this work, we provide evidence that\ninterfacial defects can enhance the TBC across interfaces through the emergence\nof unique high frequency vibrational modes that arise from atomic mass defects\nat the interface with relatively small masses. We demonstrate ultrahigh TBC at\namorphous SiOC:H/SiC:H interfaces, approaching 1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, that is\nfurther increased through the introduction of nitrogen defects. The fact that\ndisordered interfaces can exhibit such high conductances, which can be further\nincreased with additional defects offers a unique direction in controlling\ninterfacial thermal transport that becomes important in manipulating heat\ntransfer across materials with high densities of interfaces.\n", "  Spin filtering is an essential operation in spintronics that allows creation\nand detection of spin polarized carriers. Transition metal ferromagnets are\nused as spin filters in most cases, though their spin filtering efficiency is\nonly around ~50%, thereby limiting the efficiency of spintronic devices.\nRecently, chiral systems such as DNA have been shown to exhibit efficient spin\nfiltering, a phenomenon often dubbed as \"chirality induced spin selectivity\"\n(CISS). In this work, we consider single wall carbon nanotubes helically\nwrapped with single stranded poly-T DNA. By magnetoresistance measurements we\nshow that this system exhibits significant spin polarization of ~80%, which\ncould be attributed to the Rashba spin-orbit interaction induced by the\ninversion asymmetric helical potential of the DNA. Observed spin polarization\nis larger than that reported before for d(GT)15 strands. Such systems allow\ntailoring spin polarization by chemical means and also allow extremely\nlocalized creation and detection of spin polarization without any magnetic\nelement and could lead to extreme miniaturization and compact integration of\nspintronic devices and circuits.\n", "  The main objective of this thesis is to discuss scalar-tensor theories in the\nPalatini approach. Both scalar-tensor theories and Palatini formalism are means\nof alternating classical theory of gravity, general relativity, in order to\naccount for phenomena being seemingly unexplainable on the ground of the\nEinstein theory or to serve as toy models used to test limitations of the\ntheory in question. In the literature, both Palatini approach and scalar-tensor\ntheories have been widely discussed, but there are very few - if none - authors\nwriting about a merge of these two ideas. The present paper is a result of an\ninsufficient attention given to the topic of scalar-tensor theories in Palatini\nformalism.\n  In the course of the thesis action functional for scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity will be introduced. This action functional differs significantly from\nthe action defined in case of scalar-tensor theories in metric approach. We aim\nat analysing the theory using the language of invariants, allowing us to write\ndown all equations in a frame-independent manner. We discover that invariants\ndefined for the metric case do not always have their counterparts in Palatini\nformalism. Also, two frames most frequently used in the literature are\ndiscussed: Einstein and Jordan frame. Possible applications of the theory\ndeveloped in the first part of the thesis are presented. We show the\nequivalence between $f(R)$ and scalar-tensor theories of gravity and exploit\nthis fact by analysing the former using methods developed for scalar-tensor\ntheories. We conclude the thesis with calculating the Friedmann equations for\nan empty universe of vanishing spatial curvature and preparing set-up for\nanalysing inflationary behaviour.\n", "  We study the gravitational effects of two celestrial bodies on a typical\nobject of the Kuyper Belt. The first body is a kuyperian object itself with\nfairly large eccentricity and perihelion but with a large mass, about 16 times\nthe mass of the Earth. The second body is a star whose mass is 30% - 50% of the\nmass of the sun that passes by our solar system at a speed between 25 km/sec\nand 100 km/sec and at a distance of closest approach between 0.05 and 0.5 light\nyear. As a measure of the perturbations caused by these bodies on the light\nkuyperian object, we analyse its eccentricity. We find that the effects due to\nthe passage of the wandering star are permanent in the sense that the\neccentricity of the kuyperian object remains anomalous long after the passage\nof the star. The same is true of the heavy kuyperian object: it can perturb\ngreatly the orbit of the lighter kuyperian object, which leads to a permanent,\nanomalous eccentricity.\n", "  We show that by a simple two-steps measurement protocol one can extract the\nthermal properties of anisotropic insulator materials. We focus on Bi2Se3\nsingle crystal, a layered crystal with individual sheets held together by Van\nder Waals force, presenting strong heat diffusion anisotropy. Since the shape\nof the sample does not allow experiments in the perpendicular direction the\nchallenge is to measure the in plane and out of plane thermal properties by in\nplane measurements. The optical properties of Bi2Se3 being known (opaque sample\nfor the pump and probe beams), thermoreflectance microscopy experiments can be\ndone on the bare substrate. In this case, the lateral heat diffusion is\ngoverned by the in plane thermal diffusivity. A 100 nm gold layer is then\ndeposited on the sample. In this second experiment it is straightforward to\ndemonstrate that the perpendicular thermal properties of the layer rule the\nlateral diffusivity. The good agreement of theoretical curves obtained by\nthermal models with experimental data permit us to evaluate the thermal\nconductivity coefficients of bulk Bi2Se3.\n", "  Many current and future exoplanet missions are pushing to infrared (IR)\nwavelengths where the flux contrast between the planet and star is more\nfavorable (Deming et al. 2009), and the impact of stellar magnetic activity is\ndecreased. Indeed, a recent analysis of starspots and faculae found these forms\nof stellar activity do not substantially impact the transit signatures or\nscience potential for FGKM stars with JWST (Zellem et al. 2017). However, this\nis not true in the case of flares, which I demonstrate can be a hinderance to\ntransit studies in this note.\n", "  A two-dimensional bidisperse granular fluid is shown to exhibit pronounced\nlong-ranged dynamical heterogeneities as dynamical arrest is approached. Here\nwe focus on the most direct approach to study these heterogeneities: we\nidentify clusters of slow particles and determine their size, $N_c$, and their\nradius of gyration, $R_G$. We show that $N_c\\propto R_G^{d_f}$, providing\ndirect evidence that the most immobile particles arrange in fractal objects\nwith a fractal dimension, $d_f$, that is observed to increase with packing\nfraction $\\phi$. The cluster size distribution obeys scaling, approaching an\nalgebraic decay in the limit of structural arrest, i.e., $\\phi\\to\\phi_c$.\nAlternatively, dynamical heterogeneities are analyzed via the four-point\nstructure factor $S_4(q,t)$ and the dynamical susceptibility $\\chi_4(t)$.\n$S_4(q,t)$ is shown to obey scaling in the full range of packing fractions,\n$0.6\\leq\\phi\\leq 0.805$, and to become increasingly long-ranged as\n$\\phi\\to\\phi_c$. Finite size scaling of $\\chi_4(t)$ provides a consistency\ncheck for the previously analyzed divergences of $\\chi_4(t)\\propto\n(\\phi-\\phi_c)^{-\\gamma_{\\chi}}$ and the correlation length $\\xi\\propto\n(\\phi-\\phi_c)^{-\\gamma_{\\xi}}$. We check the robustness of our results with\nrespect to our definition of mobility. The divergences and the scaling for\n$\\phi\\to\\phi_c$ suggest a non-equilibrium glass transition which seems\nqualitatively independent of the coefficient of restitution.\n", "  This paper describes a quantum programming environment, named $Q|SI\\rangle$.\nIt is a platform embedded in the .Net language that supports quantum\nprogramming using a quantum extension of the $\\mathbf{while}$-language. The\nframework of the platform includes a compiler of the quantum\n$\\mathbf{while}$-language and a suite of tools for simulating quantum\ncomputation, optimizing quantum circuits, and analyzing and verifying quantum\nprograms. Throughout the paper, using $Q|SI\\rangle$ to simulate quantum\nbehaviors on classical platforms with a combination of components is\ndemonstrated. The scalable framework allows the user to program customized\nfunctions on the platform. The compiler works as the core of $Q|SI\\rangle$\nbridging the gap from quantum hardware to quantum software. The built-in\ndecomposition algorithms enable the universal quantum computation on the\npresent quantum hardware.\n", "  We propose the lead sulphide (PbS) monolayer as a 2D semiconductor with a\nlarge Rashba-like spin-orbit effect controlled by the out-of-plane buckling.\nThe buckled PbS conduction band is found to possess Rashba-like dispersion and\nspin texture at the $M$ and $\\Gamma$ points, with large effective Rashba\nparameters of $\\lambda\\sim5~$eV$\\AA~$ and $\\lambda\\sim1~$eV$~\\AA$,\nrespectively. Using a tight-binding formalism, we show that the Rashba effect\noriginates from the very large spin-orbit interaction and the hopping term that\nmixes the in-plane and out-of-plane $p$ orbitals of Pb and S atoms. The latter,\nwhich depends on the buckling angle, can be controlled by applying strain to\nvary the spin texture as well as the Rashba parameter at $\\Gamma$ and $M$. Our\ndensity functional theory results together with tight-binding formalism provide\na unifying framework for designing Rashba monolayers and for manipulating their\nspin properties.\n", "  A new type of absorbing boundary conditions for molecular dynamics\nsimulations are presented. The exact boundary conditions for crystalline solids\nwith harmonic approximation are expressed as a dynamic Dirichlet- to-Neumann\n(DtN) map. It connects the displacement of the atoms at the boundary to the\ntraction on these atoms. The DtN map is valid for a domain with general\ngeometry. To avoid evaluating the time convo- lution of the dynamic DtN map, we\napproximate the associated kernel function by rational functions in the Laplace\ndomain. The parameters in the approximations are determined by interpolations.\nThe explicit forms of the zeroth, first, and second order approximations will\nbe presented. The stability of the molecular dynamics model, supplemented with\nthese absorbing boundary conditions is established. Two numerical simulations\nare performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.\n", "  We present experimental measurements of the thermal boundary conductance\n(TBC) from $77 - 500$ K across isolated heteroepitaxially grown ZnO films on\nGaN substrates. These data provide an assessment of the assumptions that drive\nthe phonon gas model-based diffuse mismatch models (DMM) and atomistic Green's\nfunction (AGF) formalisms for predicting TBC. Our measurements, when compared\nto previous experimental data, suggest that the TBC can be influenced by long\nwavelength, zone center modes in a material on one side of the interface as\nopposed to the \"vibrational mismatch\" concept assumed in the DMM; this\ndisagreement is pronounced at high temperatures. At room temperature, we\nmeasure the ZnO/GaN TBC as $490\\lbrack +150, -110\\rbrack$ MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$.\nThe disagreement among the DMM and AGF and the experimental data these elevated\ntemperatures suggests a non-negligible contribution from additional modes\ncontributing to TBC that not accounted for in the fundamental assumptions of\nthese harmonic formalisms, such as inelastic scattering. Given the high quality\nof these ZnO/GaN interface, these results provide an invaluable critical and\nquantitive assessment of the accuracy of assumptions in the current state of\nthe art of computational approaches for predicting the phonon TBC across\ninterfaces.\n", "  We here report an identification of SDSS J090152.04+624342.6 as a new\n\"overlapping-trough\" iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasar at\nredshift of $z\\sim2.1$. No strong variation of the broad absorption lines can\nbe revealed through the two spectra taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with\na time interval of $\\sim6$yr. Further optical and infrared spectroscopic study\non this object is suggested.\n", "  In this paper, a wetting boundary scheme used to describe the interactions\namong ternary fluids and solid is proposed in the framework of the lattice\nBoltzmann method. This scheme for three-phase fluids can preserve the reduction\nconsistency property with the diphasic situation such that it could give\nphysically relevant results. Combining this wetting boundary scheme and the\nlattice Boltzmann (LB) ternary fluid model based on the multicomponent\nphase-field theory, we simulated several ternary fluid flow problems involving\nsolid substrate, including the spreading of binary drops on the substrate, the\nspreading of a compound drop on the substrate, and the shear of a compound\nliquid drop on the substrate. The numerical results are found to be good\nagreement with the analytical solutions or some available results. Finally, as\nan application, we use the LB model coupled with the present wetting boundary\nscheme to numerically investigate the impact of a compound drop on a solid\ncircular cylinder. It is found that the dynamics of a compound drop can be\nremarkably influenced by the wettability of the solid surface and the\ndimensionless Weber number.\n", "  We report detailed investigation of nulling and drifting behavior of two\npulsars PSRs J1741-0840 and J1840-0840 observed from the Giant Meterwave Radio\nTelescope at 625 MHz. PSR J1741-840 was found to show nulling fraction (NF) of\naround 30(5)% while PSR J1840-0840 was shown to have NF of around 50(6)%. We\nmeasured drifting behavior from different profile components in PSR J1840-0840\nfor the first time with the leading component showing drifting with 13.5(0.7)\nperiods while the weak trailing component showed drifting of around 18(1)\nperiods. Large nulling do hamper accuracy of these quantities derived using\nstandard Fourier techniques. A more accurate comparison was drawn from\ndriftband slopes, measured after sub-pulse modeling. These measurements\nrevealed interesting sporadic and irregular drifting behavior in both pulsars.\nWe conclude that the previously reported different drifting periodicities in\nthe trailing component of PSR J1741-0840 is likely due to the spread in these\ndriftband slopes. We also find that both components of PSR J1840-0840 show\nsimilar driftband slopes within the uncertainties. Unique nulling-drifting\ninteraction is identified in PSR J1840-0840 where, in most occasions, the\npulsar tends to start nulling after what appears to be an end of a driftband.\nSimilarly, when the pulsar switches back to an emission phase, in most\noccasions it starts at the beginning of a new driftband in both components.\nSuch behaviors have not been detected in any other pulsars to our knowledge. We\nalso found that PSR J1741-0840 seems to have no memory of its previous burst\nphase while PSR J1840-0840 clearly exhibits memory of its previous state even\nafter longer nulls for both components. We discuss possible explanations for\nthese intriguing nulling-drifting interactions seen in both pulsars based on\nvarious pulsar nulling models.\n", "  We investigate algebraic properties of weakly commutative triples, appearing\nin the theory of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations. Algebraic\ntechnique of skew fields of formal pseudodifferential operators as well as skew\nOre fields of fractions are applied to this problem, relating weakly\ncommutative triples to commuting elements of skew Ore field of formal fractions\nof ordinary differential operators. A version of Burchnall-Chaundy theorem for\nweakly commutative triples is proved by algebraic means avoiding analytical\ncomplications typical for its proofs known in the theory of integrable\nequations.\n", "  Room temperature ionic liquids (ILs) at solid surfaces have been recognized\nfor their significant interfacial properties in electrochemical and electronic\ndevices. To ascertain the interface effects, we investigate dynamical and\nstructural properties of two ILs in nanoscale confinement at various\ntemperatures. Specifically, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations\nfor ILs composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cations and hexafluorophosphate\n([Bmim][PF6]) or tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]) anions sandwiched between\namorphous silica slabs. Density profiles of the ionic species across the slit\nreveal that [PF6] and [BF4] anions tend to stay closer to the slab wall than\n[Bmim] cations resulting in a bi-layered arrangement in the interfacial region.\nFor the cations, we observe a preferred orientation at the surface with the\nmethyl groups pointing towards the wall and the butyl tails projected inwards.\nMean square displacements and incoherent scattering function reveal slowed and\nheterogeneous dynamics of all ionic species in the slit pore. In particular,\nspatially resolved analyses show that the structural relaxation times increase\nby about two orders of magnitude when approaching the silica surfaces, an\neffect to be considered when designing applications. The altered structural and\ndynamical features of the confined ILs can be related to an existence of\npreferred sites for the anions on the amorphous silica surfaces. Detailed\nanalyses of relations between the broadly distributed site and surface\nproperties show that particularly stable anion sites result when triangular\narrangements of silanol groups enable multiple hydrogen bonds with the various\nfluorine atoms of a given anion, elucidating an important trapping mechanism at\nthe silica surface.\n", "  Massive stars, which terminate their evolution as core collapse supernovae,\nare theoretically predicted to eject more than 1E-5 solar masses of the\nradioisotope 60Fe. If such an event occurs sufficiently close to our solar\nsystem, traces of the supernova debris could be deposited on Earth. Herein, we\nreport a time resolved 60Fe signal residing, at least partially, in a biogenic\nreservoir. Using accelerator mass spectrometry, this signal was found through\nthe direct detection of live 60Fe atoms contained within secondary iron oxides,\namong which are magnetofossils, the fossilized chains of magnetite crystals\nproduced by magnetotactic bacteria. The magnetofossils were chemically\nextracted from two Pacific Ocean sediment drill cores. Our results show that\nthe 60Fe signal onset occurs around 2.6 Ma to 2.8 Ma, near the lower\nPleistocene boundary, terminates around 1.7 Ma, and peaks at about 2.2 Ma.\n", "  The motion of time-like test particles in the Fisher/Janis-Newman-Winicour\n(F/JNW) spacetime is studied with the Hamiltonian formulation of the geodesic\nequations. The spacetime is characterised by its mass parameter $r_g$ and\nscalar field parameter $\\nu$. The innermost bound and stable circular orbits\nare calculated and the effective potential is analysed. Consistent with\nnumerical results in earlier literature, for $\\nu<1/2$, particles with non-zero\nangular momentum encounter an infinite potential barrier, preventing them from\nreaching the naked singularity at $r=r_g$. Periodic orbits in the spacetime are\nalso obtained. Compared to the periodic orbits around the Schwarzschild black\nhole, it is found that typically lower energies are required for the same\norbits in the F/JNW spacetime.\n", "  We describe reshaping of active textiles actuated by bending of Janus fibres\ncomprising both active and passive components. A great variety of shapes,\ndetermined by minimising the overall energy of the fabric, can be produced by\nvarying bending directions determined by the orientation of Janus fibres. Under\ncertain conditions, alternative equilibrium states, one absolutely stable and\nthe other metastable coexist, and their relative energy may flip its sign as\nsystem parameters, such as the extension upon actuation, change. A snap-through\nreshaping in a specially structured textile reproduces the Venus flytrap\neffect.\n", "  The orbital motion of non-contact double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2),\nwith periods of a few tens of days to several years, holds unique accurate\ninformations on individual stellar masses, that only long-term monitoring can\nunlock. The combination of radial velocity measurements from high-resolution\nspectrographs and astrometric measurements from high-precision interferometers\nallows the derivation of SB2 components masses down to the percent precision.\nSince 2010, we observed a large sample of SB2 with the SOPHIE spectrograph at\nthe Observatoire de Haute-Provence, aiming at the derivation of orbital\nelements with sufficient accuracy to obtain masses of components with relative\nerrors as low as 1$\\%$ when the astrometric measurements of the Gaia satellite\nwill be taken into account. In this paper we present the results from six years\nof observations of 14 SB2 systems with periods ranging from 33 to 4185 days.\nUsing the TODMOR algorithm we computed radial velocities from the spectra, and\nthen derived the orbital elements of these binary systems. The minimum masses\nof the 28 stellar components are then obtained with a sample average accuracy\nof 1.0$\\pm$0.2$\\,\\%$. Combining the radial velocities with existing\ninterferometric measurements, we derived the masses of the primary and\nsecondary components of HIP 61100, HIP 95995 and HIP 101382 with relative\nerrors for components (A,B) of respectively (2.0, 1.7)$\\,\\%$, (3.7, 3.7)$\\,\\%$,\nand (0.2, 0.1)$\\,\\%$. Using the Cesam2k stellar evolution code, we could\nconstrain the initial He-abundance, age and metallicity for HIP 61100 and HIP\n95995.\n", "  We address the long-standing controversy regarding the correct description of\nthe electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor in media and its consequences for\nthe Casimir force. The latter being due to the zero-point momentum of the\nelectromagnetic field, competing approaches based on the Abraham or Maxwell\nstress tensor lead to different predictions. We consider the test scenario of\ntwo colloidal spherical particles submerged in a dielectric medium and use\nthree criteria to distinguish the two approaches: we show that the Abraham\nstress tensor, and not the Maxwell stress tensor, leads to a Casimir force that\nis form-equivalent to Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces, obeys duality as\na fundamental symmetry and is consistent with microscopic many-body\ncalculations.\n", "  We discuss the quarkonium hybrid spectrum from the perspective of\nnonrelativistic effective field theories combined with lattice QCD.\n", "  The suppression of quarkonium production with respect to pp collisions is one\nof the most distinctive signatures of the formation of quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP), a hot nuclear medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.\nHowever, the suppression of heavy quarkonium production with respect to pp\ncollisions can also take place in p-A collisions, where QGP is not expected to\nbe created and only cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, such as nuclear\nabsorption, parton shadowing and parton energy loss in initial and final states\noccur. The study of p-A collisions is therefore important to disentangle the\neffects of QGP from the CNM ones, and to provide essential input to understand\nthe nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n  The ALICE Collaboration at the LHC has studied inclusive J/$\\psi$ production,\nin the dimuon decay channel, at forward rapidity (2.03 $<$ $y_{\\rm cms}$ $<$\n3.53) and backward rapidity ($-$4.46 $<$ $y_{\\rm cms}$ $<$ $-$2.96) in p-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 8.16$ TeV with the Muon Spectrometer. In\nthis contribution, we present the measurement of the nuclear modification\nfactor of inclusive J/$\\psi$ as a function of the centrality and we show the\ncomparison of this result with the one at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.\n", "  A reversible thermotropic phase transition in an adsorption melissic acid\nfilm at the interface between n-hexane and an aqueous solution of potassium\nhydroxide (pH=10) is investigated by X-ray reflectometry and diffuse scattering\nusing synchrotron radiation. The experimental data indicate that the interface\n\"freezing\" transition is accompanied not only by the crystallization of the\nGibbs monolayer but also by the formation of a planar smectic structure in the\n~300-Angstrom-thick adsorption film; this structure is formed by\n~50-Angstrom-thick layers.\n", "  In recent years, there have been a large number of studies which support\nviolation of statistical isotropy. Meanwhile, there are some studies which also\nfound inconsistency. We use the power tensor method defined earlier in the\nliterature to study the new CMBR data. The orientation of these three\northogonal vectors, as well as the power associated with each vector, contains\ninformation about possible violation of statistical isotropy. This information\nis encoded in two entropy measures, the power-entropy and alignment- entropy.\nWe apply this method to WMAP 9-year and PLANCK data. Here, we also revisit the\nstatistics to test high-l anomaly reported in our earlier paper and find that\nthe high degree of isotropy seen in earlier WMAP 5-year data is absent in the\nrevised WMAP 9-year data.\n", "  An extended immersed boundary method utilizing a semi-implicit direct forcing\napproach for the simulation of confined incompressible viscous thermal flow\nproblems is presented. The method utilizes a Schur complement approach to\nenforce the kinematic constraints of no-slip and the corresponding thermal\nboundary conditions for immersed surfaces. The developed methodology can be\nstraightforwardly adapted to any existing incompressible time marching solver\nbased on a segregated pressure-velocity coupling. The method accurately meets\nthe thermal and the no-slip boundary conditions on the surfaces of immersed\nbodies for the entire range of Rayleigh numbers $10^3\\leqslant\nRa\\leqslant10^6$. Strategies for further increasing the computational\nefficiency of the developed approach are discussed. The method has been\nextensively verified by applying it for the simulation of a number of\nrepresentative fully 3D confined natural convection steady and periodic flows.\nComplex dynamic phenomena typical of this kind of flow including vortical\nstructures and convection cells and instability characteristics, were simulated\nand visualized and the results were found to compare favorably with results\nknown from literature.\n", "  We implement several quantum algorithms in real five-qubit superconducting\nquantum processor IBMqx4 to perform quantum computation of the dynamics of\nspin-1/2 particles interacting directly and indirectly through the boson field.\nParticularly, we focus on effects arising due to the presence of entanglement\nin the initial state of the system. The dynamics is implemented in a digital\nway using Trotter expansion of evolution operator. Our results demonstrate that\ndynamics in our modeling based on real device is governed by quantum\ninterference effects being highly sensitive to phase parameters of the initial\nstate. We also discuss limitations of our approach due to the device\nimperfection as well as possible scaling towards larger systems.\n", "  The inclusive spectra of secondaries produced in soft (minimum-bias) p+Pb\ncollisions at LHC energy are calculated in the frame of the Quark-Gluon String\nModel, by including the inelastic screening corrections (percolation effects).\nThese effects are expected to be quite large at the very high energies, and\nthey should drive down the spectra in the midrapidity region more than 2 times,\nat sqrt(sNN)=5 TeV.\n", "  In this study, we report a different strategy to prepare graphene nanopapers\nfrom direct vacuum filtration. Instead of the conventional method, i.e. thermal\nannealing nanopapers at extremely high temperatures prepared from graphene\noxide (GO) or partially reduced GO, we fabricate our graphene nanopapers\ndirectly from suspensions of fully reduced graphene oxide (RGO), obtained after\nRGO and thermally annealing at 1700 {\\deg}C in vacuum. By using this approach,\nwe studied the effect of thermal annealing on the physical properties of the\nmacroscopic graphene-based papers. Indeed, we demonstrated that the enhancement\nof the thermal and electrical properties of graphene nanopapers prepared from\nannealed RGO is strongly influenced by the absence of oxygen functionalities\nand the morphology of the nanoflakes. Hence, our methodology can be considered\nas a valid alternative to the classical approach.\n", "  New physics beyond the Standard Model is required to give mass to the light\nneutrinos. One of the simplest ideas is to introduce new heavy, gauge singlet\nfermions that play the role of right-handed neutrinos in a seesaw mechanism.\nThey could have large Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson, affecting the Higgs\ncouplings and in particular the triple Higgs coupling $\\lambda_{HHH}^{}$, the\nmeasure of which is one of the major goals of the LHC and of future colliders.\nWe present a study of the impact of these heavy neutrinos on $\\lambda_{HHH}^{}$\nat the one-loop level, first in a simplified 3+1 model with one heavy Dirac\nneutrino and then in the inverse seesaw model. Taking into account all possible\nexperimental constraints, we find that sizeable deviations of the order of 35%\nare possible, large enough to be detected at future colliders, making the\ntriple Higgs coupling a new, viable observable to constrain neutrino mass\nmodels. The effects are generic and are expected in any new physics model\nincluding TeV-scale fermions with large Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson,\nsuch as those using the neutrino portal.\n", "  We study the norm approximation to the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics of $N$ bosons\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2$) with an interaction potential of the form\n$N^{d\\beta-1}w(N^{\\beta}(x-y))$. Here we are interested in the focusing case\n$w\\le 0$. Assuming that there is complete Bose-Einstein condensation in the\ninitial state, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the evolution of the\ncondensate is effectively described by a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and\nthe evolution of the fluctuations around the condensate is governed by a\nquadratic Hamiltonian, resulting from Bogoliubov approximation. Our result\nholds true for all $\\beta>0$ when $d=1$ and for all $0<\\beta<1$ when $d=2$.\n", "  In the present work, the microcrystalline characteristics of KBr thin films\nhave been investigated by evaluating the breadth of diffraction peak. The\nWilliamson-Hall, the Size-Strain Plot and the single line Voigt methods are\nemployed to deconvolute the finite crystallite size and microstrain\ncontribution from the broaden X-ray profile. The texture coefficient and\ndislocation density have been determined along each diffraction peak. Other\nrelevant physical parameters such as stress, Young's modulus and energy density\nare also estimated using Uniform Stress-Deformation and Uniform Deformation\nEnergy Density approximation of Williamson-Hall method.\n", "  We present an accurate computational study of the electronic structure and\nlattice dynamics of solid molecular hydrogen at high pressure. The band-gap\nenergies of the $C2/c$, $Pc$, and $P6_3/m$ structures at pressures of 250, 300,\nand 350 GPa are calculated using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC)\nmethod. The atomic configurations are obtained from ab-initio path-integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations at 300 K and 300 GPa to investigate the\nimpact of zero-point energy and temperature-induced motion of the protons\nincluding anharmonic effects. We find that finite temperature and nuclear\nquantum effects reduce the band-gaps substantially, leading to metallization of\nthe $C2/c$ and $Pc$ phases via band overlap; the effect on the band-gap of the\n$P6_3/m$ structure is less pronounced. Our combined DMC-PIMD simulations\npredict that there are no excitonic or quasiparticle energy gaps for the $C2/c$\nand $Pc$ phases at 300 GPa and 300 K. Our results also indicate a strong\ncorrelation between the band-gap energy and vibron modes. This strong coupling\ninduces a band-gap reduction of more than 2.46 eV in high-pressure solid\nmolecular hydrogen. Comparing our DMC-PIMD with experimental results available,\nwe conclude that none of the structures proposed is a good candidate for phases\nIII and IV of solid hydrogen.\n", "  We introduce PULSEDYN, a particle dynamics program in $C++$, to solve\nmany-body nonlinear systems in one dimension. PULSEDYN is designed to make\ncomputing accessible to non-specialists in the field of nonlinear dynamics of\nmany-body systems and to ensure transparency and easy benchmarking of numerical\nresults for an integrable model (Toda chain) and three non-integrable models\n(Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou, Morse and Lennard-Jones). To achieve the latter, we\nhave made our code open source and free to distribute. We examine (i) soliton\npropagation and two-soliton collision in the Toda system, (ii) the recurrence\nphenomenon in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou system and the decay of a single\nlocalized nonlinear excitation in the same system through quasi-equilibrium to\nan equipartitioned state, and SW propagation in chains with (iii) Morse and\n(iv) Lennard-Jones potentials. We recover well known results from theory and\nother numerical results in the literature. We have obtained these results by\nsetting up a parameter file interface which allows the code to be used as a\nblack box. Therefore, we anticipate that the code would prove useful to\nstudents and non-specialists. At the same time, PULSEDYN provides\nscientifically accurate simulations thus making the study of rich dynamical\nprocesses broadly accessible.\n", "  We briefly review the current status of the hadronic light-by-light\nscattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Based on\nvarious model calculations in the literature, we obtain the estimate\na_{mu}^{HLbL} = (102 \\pm 39) x 10^{-11}. Recent developments including more\nmodel-independent approaches using dispersion relations and lattice QCD, that\ncould lead to a more reliable estimate, are also discussed.\n", "  Using f frequency instead of {\\omega} frequency for earthquake magnitude\ncomputing is discussed.\n", "  Ultra-thin layers of liquids on a surface behave differently from bulk\nliquids due to liquid-surface interactions. Some examples are significant\nchanges in diffusion properties and the temperature at which the liquid-solid\nphase transition takes place. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations suggest\nthat thin layers of water on a diamond surface may remain solid even well above\nroom temperature. However, because of the small volumes that are involved, it\nis exceedingly difficult to examine these phenomena experimentally with current\ntechnologies. In this context, shallow NV centers promise a highly sensitive\ntool for the investigation of magnetic signals emanating from liquids and\nsolids that are deposited on the surface of a diamond. Moreover, NV centers are\nnon-invasive sensors with extraordinary performance even at room-temperature.\nTo that end, we present here a theoretical work, complemented with numerical\nevidence based on bosonization techniques, that predicts the measurable signal\nfrom a single NV center when interacting with large spin baths in different\nconfigurations. We therefore propose single NV centers as sensors capable to\nresolve structural water features at the nanoscale and even sensitive to phase\ntransitions.\n", "  We present a novel method to solve the Maxwell-Liouville-von Neumann (MLN)\nequations in an accurate and efficient way without invoking the rotating wave\napproximation (RWA). The method is a combination of two established concepts,\nnamely the operator splitting method as well as the adjoint representation of\nthe Lie algebra SU(N) (or pseudospin representation). The former concept\nensures the accuracy of the approach, but is computationally expensive. The\nlatter concept provides an efficient representation of the problem and two\noptimization possibilities. We have implemented and verified both optimization\napproaches and demonstrate that substantial speedup can be achieved.\n", "  We obtain a more accurate statistical estimation of the mass of double\ngalaxies moving in circular orbits, including confidence intervals for\ndifferent confidence levels.\n", "  We present preliminary results from our analysis of the form factors for the\n$\\overline{B}\\rightarrow D^\\ast\\ell\\overline{\\nu}$ decay at non-zero recoil.\nOur analysis includes 15 MILC asqtad ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavors of sea\nquarks and lattice spacings ranging from $a\\approx 0.15$ fm down to $0.045$ fm.\nThe valence light quarks employ the asqtad action, whereas the heavy quarks are\ntreated using the Fermilab action. We conclude with a discussion of future\nplans and phenomenological implications. When combined with experimental\nmeasurements of the decay rate, our calculation will enable a determination of\nthe CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$.\n", "  Interlayer magnetoresistance (ILMR) effect is explored in a vertical stack of\nweakly coupled multilayer graphene as grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).\nThis effect has been characterized as a function of temperature and tilt angle\nof the magnetic field with respect to the interlayer current. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first experimental report on angle dependent ILMR effect in\ngraphitic systems. Our data agrees qualitatively with the existing theories of\nILMR in multilayer massless Dirac Fermion systems. However, a sharper change in\nILMR has been observed as the tilt angle of the magnetic field is varied. A\nphysical explanation of this effect is proposed, which is consistent with our\nexperimental scenario.\n", "  First-principles studies often rely on the assumption of equilibrium, which\ncan be a poor approximation, e.g., for growth. Here, an effective chemical\npotential method for non-equilibrium systems is developed. A salient feature of\nthe theory is that it maintains the equilibrium limits as the correct limit. In\napplication to molecular beam epitaxy, rate equations are solved for the\nconcentrations of small clusters, which serve as feedstock for growth. We find\nthat the effective chemical potential is determined by the most probable,\nrather than by the lowest-energy, cluster. In the case of Bi2Se3, the chemical\npotential is found to be highly supersaturated, leading to a high nucleus\nconcentration in agreement with experiment.\n"]}
