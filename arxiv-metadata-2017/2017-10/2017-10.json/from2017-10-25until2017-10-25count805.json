that the elastic\nproperties of mantle minerals are known as a function of temperature at mantle\npressures. At present, however, such information is difficult to obtain\ndirectly through laboratory experiments. We have therefore taken advantage of\nrecent advances in computer technology, and have performed finite-temperature\nab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the elastic properties of MgSiO3\nperovskite, the major mineral of the lower mantle, at relevant thermodynamic\nconditions. When combined with the results from tomographic images of the\nmantle, our results indicate that the lower mantle is either significantly\nanelastic or compositionally heterogeneous on large scales. We found the\ntemperature contrast between the coldest and hottest regions of the mantle, at\na given depth, to be about 800K at 1000 km, 1500K at 2000 km, and possibly over\n2000K at the core-mantle boundary.\n", "  Zirconium alloys are used as nuclear fuel cladding material due to their\nmechanical and corrosion resistant properties together with their favorable\ncross-section for neutron scattering. At running conditions, however, there\nwill be an increase of hydrogen in the vicinity of the cladding surface at the\nwater side of the fuel. The hydrogen will diffuse into the cladding material\nand at certain conditions, such as lower temperatures and external load,\nhydrides will precipitate out in the material and cause well known\nembrittlement, blistering and other unwanted effects. Using phase-field methods\nit is now possible to model precipitation build-up in metals, for example as a\nfunction of hydrogen concentration, temperature and external load, but the\ntechnique relies on input of parameters, such as the formation energy of the\nhydrides and matrix. To that end, we have computed, using the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) code GPAW, the latent heat of fusion as well as solved\nthe crystal structure for three zirconium hydride polymorphs: \\delta-ZrH1.6,\n\\gamma-ZrH, and \\epsilon-ZrH2.\n", "  We evaluate the production cross sections of $X(3872)$ at the LHC and\nTevatron at NLO in $\\alpha_s$ in NRQCD by assuming that the short-distance\nproduction proceeds dominantly through its $\\chi_{c1}'$ component in our\n$\\chi_{c1}'\\mbox{-}D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ mixing model for $X(3872)$. The outcomes of\nthe fits to the CMS $p_T$ distribution can well account for the recent ATLAS\ndata in a much larger range of transverse momenta\n($10~\\mbox{GeV}<p_T<70~\\mbox{GeV}$), and the CDF total cross section data, and\nare also consistent with the value of $k=Z_{c\\bar c}\\cdot Br(X\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-)$ constrained by the $B$-meson decay data. %It can also well\ndescribe the behavior of the CDF $\\psi(2S)$ data, which show a strong\n%resemblance to that of the X(3872). For LHCb the predicted X(3872) total cross\nsection is larger than the data by a factor of 2, which is due to the problem\nof the fixed-order NRQCD calculation that may not be applicable for the region\nwith small $p_T$ ($p_T\\sim 5 ~\\mbox{GeV}$) and large forward rapidity\n$(2.5<y<4.5)$. In comparison, the prediction of molecule production mechanism\nfor $X(3872)$ is inconsistent with both $p_T$ distributions and total cross\nsections of CMS and ATLAS, and the total cross section of CDF.\n", "  A closed form PT symmetric quadrimer optical waveguide structure, reminiscent\nof the four-state quantum system found in quantum optics, is studied. The beam\ndynamics of the structure is studied numerically. The effect of inclusion of\nnonlinearity and dispersion is also briefly investigated and discussed\n", "  In this work, we have studied the traveling wave solution in a nonlinear\nBragg grating structure in which the core of the optical fiber is having\nParity-time (PT) symmetric refractive index distribution. We have found bright\nsolitary wave solution below the PT-threshold for forward wave and dark\nsolitary wave solution above the PT-threshold for backward wave. The effects of\nincreasing the traveling wave speed on the spatio-temporal evolutions of the\nanalytical solutions have been shown and the emergence of the Optical Rogue\nWaves (ORWs) has been explored based on the system parameters.\n", "  Anderson's theorem states that non-magnetic impurities do not change the bulk\nproperties of conventional superconductors. However, as the dimensionality is\nreduced, the effect of impurities becomes more significant. Here we investigate\nsuperconducting nanowires with diameter less than the superconducting coherence\nlength by using a microscopic description based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nmethod. We find that: 1) impurities strongly affect the superconducting\nproperties, 2) the effect is impurity position-dependent, and 3) it exhibits\nopposite behavior for resonant and off-resonant wire widths. We show that this\nis due to the interplay between the shape resonances of the order parameter and\nthe sub-band energy spectrum induced by the lateral quantum confinement. These\neffects can be used to manipulate the Josephson current, filter electrons by\nsubband and investigate the symmetries of the superconducting subbands.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the dynamical behavior of large dust grains in the\nvicinity of a cometary nucleus. To this end we consider the gravitational field\nof the irregularly shaped body, as well as its electric and magnetic fields.\nWithout considering the effect of gas friction and solar radiation, we find\nthat there exist grains which are static relative to the cometary nucleus; the\npositions of these grains are the stable equibria. There also exist grains in\nthe stable periodic orbits close to the cometary nucleus. The grains in the\nstable equibria or the stable periodic orbits will not escape or impact on the\nsurface of the cometary nucleus. The results are applicable for large charge\ndusts with small area-mass ratio which are near the cometary nucleus and far\nfrom the Solar. It is found that the resonant periodic orbit can be stable, and\nthere exist stable non-resonant periodic orbits, stable resonant periodic\norbits and unstable resonant periodic orbits in the potential field of cometary\nnuclei. The comet gravity force, solar gravity force, electric froce, magnetic\nforce, solar radiation pressure, as well as the gas drag force are all\nconsidered to analyze the order of magnitude of these forces acting on the\ngrains with different parameters. Let the distance of the dust grain relative\nto the mass centre of the cometary nucleus, the charge and the mass of the dust\ngrain vary, respectively, fix other parameters, we clacluated the strengths of\ndifferent forces.\n", "  In an $SU(3)_{c}\\times SU(2)_{L}\\times SU(2)_{R}\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ left-right\nsymmetric framework, we present a new leptogenesis scenario parametrized by\nDirac neutrino mass matrix. Benefited from the parity symmetry motivated to\nsolve the strong CP problem, the dimensionless couplings of the mirror fields\nare identified to those of the ordinary fields. In particular, the mirror Dirac\nneutrinos have a heavy mass matrix proportional to the light mass matrix of the\nordinary Dirac neutrinos. Through the $SU(2)_R$ gauge interactions, the mirror\nneutrinos can decay to generate a lepton asymmetry in the mirror muons and an\nopposite lepton asymmetry in the mirror electrons. Before the $SU(2)_L$\nsphaleron processes stop working, the mirror muons can efficiently decay into\nthe ordinary right-handed leptons with a dark matter scalar and hence the\nmirror muon asymmetry can be partially converted to a desired baryon asymmetry.\n", "  We propose a model of multispecies populations surviving on distributed\nresources. System dynamics are investigated under changes in abiotic factors\nsuch as the climate, as parameterized through environmental temperature. In\nparticular, we introduce a feedback between species abundances and resources\nvia abiotic factors. This model is apparently the first of its kind to include\na feedback mechanism coupling climate and population dynamics. Moreover, we\ntake into account self-limitation effects. The model explains the coexistence\nof many species, yet also displays the possibility of catastrophic\nbifurcations, where all species become extinct under the influence of abiotic\nfactors. We show that as these factors change there are different regimes of\necosystem behavior, including a possibly chaotic regime when abiotic influences\nare sufficiently strong.\n", "  We show the possibility of controlling the dynamical behavior of a single\nfiber ring (SFR) resonator system with the fiber being an amplified (gain)\nchannel and the ring being attenuated (loss) nonlinear dielectric medium. Our\nmodel is based on the simple alterations in the parity time symmetric synthetic\ncoupler structures proposed recently [A. Regensburger et al., Nature 488, 167\n(2012)]. The system has been modeled using the transfer matrix formalism. We\nfind that this results in a dynamically controllable algorithm for the chaotic\ndynamics inherent in the system. We have also shown the dependence of the\nperiod doubling point on the input amplitude, emphasizing on the dynamical\naspects. Moreover, the fact that the resonator essentially plays the role of a\ndamped harmonic oscillator has been elucidated with the non-zero intensity\ninside the resonator due to constant influx of input light.\n", "  Some anisotropic Bianchi V dark energy models are investigated in a scale\ninvariant theory of gravity. We consider two non interacting fluids such as\ndark energy and a bulk viscous fluid. Dark energy pressure is considered to be\nanisotropic in different spatial directions. A dynamically evolving pressure\nanisotropy is obtained from the models. The models favour phantom behaviour. It\nis observed that, in presence of dark energy, bulk viscosity has no appreciable\naffect on the cosmic dynamics.\n", "  In present paper the Duane-Hunt relation for direct measurement of the Planck\nconstant is improved by including of relativistic corrections. New relation to\ndetermine the Planck constant, suggested in this paper contains Duane-Hunt\nrelation as first term and can be applied in a wide range of energies.\n", "  In this work, we have studied the peregrine rogue wave dynamics, with a\nsolitons on finite background (SFB) ansatz, in the recently proposed (Phys.\nRev. Lett. 110 (2013) 064105) continuous nonlinear Schrodinger system with\nparity-time symmetric Kerr nonlinearity. We have found that the continuous\nnonlinear Schrodinger system with PT-symmetric nonlinearity also admits\nPeregrine Soliton solution. Motivated by the fact that Peregrine solitons are\nregarded as prototypical solutions of rogue waves, we have studied Peregrine\nrogue wave dynamics in the c-PTNLSE model. Upon numerical computation, we\nobserve the appearance of low-intense Kuznetsov-Ma (KM) soliton trains in the\nabsence of transverse shift (unbroken PT-symmetry) and well-localized\nhigh-intense Peregrine Rogue waves in the presence of transverse shift (broken\nPT-symmetry) in a definite parametric regime.\n", "  We consider standing waves in the focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS)\nequation on a dumbbell graph (two rings attached to a central line segment\nsubject to the Kirchhoff boundary conditions at the junctions). In the limit of\nsmall $L^2$ norm, the ground state (the orbitally stable standing wave of the\nsmallest energy at a fixed $L^2$ norm) is represented by a constant solution.\nHowever, when the $L^2$ norm is increased, this constant solution undertakes\ntwo bifurcations, where the first is the pitchfork (symmetry breaking)\nbifurcation and the second one is the symmetry preserving bifurcation. As a\nresult of the first symmetry breaking bifurcation, the standing wave becomes\nmore localized in one of the two rings. As a result of the second symmetry\npreserving bifurcation, the standing wave becomes localized in the central line\nsegment. In the limit of large norm solutions, both standing waves are\nrepresented by a truncated solitary wave localized in either the ring or the\ncentral line segment. Although the asymmetric wave supported in the ring is a\nground state near the symmetry breaking bifurcation of the constant solution,\nit is the symmetric wave supported in the central line segment which becomes\nthe ground state in the limit of large $L^2$ norm. The analytical results are\nconfirmed by numerical approximations of the ground state on the dumbbell\ngraph.\n", "  The extended Bose-Hubbard model captures the essential properties of a wide\nvariety of physical systems including ultracold atoms and molecules in optical\nlattices, Josephson junction arrays, and certain narrow band superconductors.\nIt exhibits a rich phase diagram including a supersolid phase where a lattice\nsolid coexists with a superfluid. We use quantum Monte Carlo to study the\nsupersolid part of the phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the\nsimple cubic lattice. We add disorder to the extended Bose-Hubbard model and\nfind that the maximum critical temperature for the supersolid phase tends to be\nsuppressed by disorder. But we also find a narrow parameter window in which the\nsupersolid critical temperature is enhanced by disorder. Our results show that\nsupersolids survive a moderate amount of spatial disorder and thermal\nfluctuations in the simple cubic lattice.\n", "  The dynamical invariant, whose expectation value is constant, is generalized\nto open quantum system. The evolution equation of dynamical invariant (the\ndynamical invariant condition) is presented for Markovian dynamics. Different\nwith the dynamical invariant for the closed quantum system, the evolution of\nthe dynamical invariant for the open quantum system is no longer unitary, and\nthe eigenvalues of it are time-dependent. Since any hermitian operator\nfulfilling dynamical invariant condition is a dynamical invariant, we propose a\nsort of special dynamical invariant (decoherence free dynamical invariant) in\nwhich a part of eigenvalues are still constant. The dynamical invariant in the\nsubspace spanned by the corresponding eigenstates evolves unitarily. Via the\ndynamical invariant condition, the results demonstrate that this dynamical\ninvariant exists under the circumstances of emergence of decoherence free\nsubspaces.\n", "  Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries emit a compact, optically thick, mildy\nrelativistic radio jet when they are in the hard and hard-intermediate states.\nIn a series of papers, we have developed a jet model and have shown, through\nMonte Carlo simulations, that our model can explain many observational results.\nIn this work, we investigate one more constraining relationship between the\ncutoff energy and the phase lag during the early stages of an X-ray outburst of\nthe black-hole X-ray binary GX 339-4: the cutoff energy decreases while the\nphase lag increases during the brightening of the hard state. We demonstrate\nthat our jet model naturally explains the above correlation, with a minor\nmodification consisting of introducing an acceleration zone at the base of the\njet. The observed correlation between the cutoff energy and the phase lag\nsuggests that the lags are produced by the hard component. Here we show that\nthis correlation arises naturally if Comptonization in the jet produces these\ntwo quantities.\n", "  A multi-platform validation and analysis framework for public Monte Carlo\nsimulation for high-energy particle collisions is discussed. The front-end of\nthis framework uses the Python programming language, while the back-end is\nwritten in Java, which provides a multi-platform environment that can be run\nfrom a web browser and can easily be deployed at the grid sites. The analysis\npackage includes all major software tools used in high-energy physics, such as\nLorentz vectors, jet algorithms, histogram packages, graphic canvases, and\ntools for providing data access. This multi-platform software suite, designed\nto minimize OS-specific maintenance and deployment time, is used for online\nvalidation of Monte Carlo event samples through a web interface.\n", "  We consider a first order formulation of relativistic fluids with bulk\nviscosity based on a stress-energy tensor introduced by Lichnerowicz. Choosing\na barotropic equation of state, we show that this theory satisfies basic\nphysical requirements and, under the further assumption of vanishing vorticity,\nthat the equations of motion are causal, both in the case of a fixed background\nand when the equations are coupled to Einstein's equations. Furthermore,\nLichnerowicz's proposal does not fit into the general framework of first order\ntheories studied by Hiscock and Lindblom, and hence their instability results\ndo not apply. These conclusions apply to the full-fledged non-linear theory,\nwithout any equilibrium or near equilibrium assumptions. Similarities and\ndifferences between the approach here explored and other theories of\nrelativistic viscosity, including the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation, are\naddressed. Cosmological models based on the Lichnerowicz stress-energy tensor\nare studied. Finally, it is also shown how the present model can be generalized\nto a second order formulation.\n", "  A deformation of the combinatorial Laplacian is proposed, consisting in a\ngeneralization of several existing Laplacians. As particular cases of this\nconstruction, the dilation Laplacians are shown to be useful tools for ranking\nin directed networks of pairwise comparisons. The eigenvector with the smallest\neigenvalue of the dilation Laplacians has the same sign on any connected graph,\nand provides directly a ranking score of its nodes. The ranking method, phrased\nin terms of a group synchronization problem, is applied to artificial and real\ndata, and its performance is compared with other ranking strategies. A main\nfeature of this approach is the presence of a deformation parameter enabling\nthe emphasis of the top-$k$ objects in the ranking. Furthermore, inspired by\nthese results, a family of random walks interpolating between the undirected\nrandom walk and the Pagerank random walk is also proposed.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a system defined by the Navier-Stokes equations for\na non-compressible fluid with Marangoni boundary conditions in the two\ndimensional case. We show that more complicated bifurcations can appear in this\nsystem for a certain nonlinear temperature profile as compared to bifurcations\nin the classical Rayleigh-B\\'enard and B\\'enard-Marangoni systems with simple\nlinear vertical temperature profiles. In terms of the B\\'enard-Marangoni\nconvection, the obtained mathematical results lead to our understanding of\ncomplex spatial patterns at a free liquid surface, which can be induced by a\ncomplicated profile of temperature or a chemical concentration at that surface.\nIn addition, we discuss some possible applications of the results to turbulence\ntheory and climate science.\n", "  We consider mean-field interactions corresponding to Gibbs measures on\ninteracting Brownian paths in three dimensions. The interaction is\nself-attractive and is given by a singular Coulomb potential. The logarithmic\nasymptotics of the partition function for this model were identified in the\n1980s by Donsker and Varadhan [6] in terms of the {\\it{Pekar variational\nformula}}, which coincides with the behavior of the partition function of the\n{\\it{polaron problem}} under strong coupling. Based on this, in 1986 Spohn [14]\nmade a heuristic observation that the strong coupling behavior of the polaron\npath measure, on certain time scales, should resemble a process, named as the\n{\\it{Pekar process}}, whose distribution could somehow be guessed from the\nlimiting asymptotic behavior of the mean-field measures under interest, whose\nrigorous analysis remained open. The present paper is devoted to a precise\nanalysis of these mean-field path measures and convergence of the normalized\noccupation measures towards an explicit mixture of the maximizers of the Pekar\nvariational problem. This leads to a rigorous construction of the\naforementioned Pekar process and hence, is a contribution to the understanding\nof the \"mean-field approximation\" of the polaron problem on the level of path\nmeasures.\n  The method of our proof is based on the compact large deviation theory\ndeveloped in [11], its extension to the uniform strong metric for the singular\nCoulomb interaction carried out in [8], as well as an idea inspired by a\n{\\it{partial path exchange}} argument appearing in [1].\n", "  The topological properties of interbank networks have been discussed widely\nin the literature mainly because of their relevance for systemic risk. Here we\npropose to use the Stochastic Block Model to investigate and perform a model\nselection among several possible two block organizations of the network: these\ninclude bipartite, core-periphery, and modular structures. We apply our method\nto the e-MID interbank market in the period 2010-2014 and we show that in\nnormal conditions the most likely network organization is a bipartite\nstructure. In exceptional conditions, such as after LTRO, one of the most\nimportant unconventional measures by ECB at the beginning of 2012, the most\nlikely structure becomes a random one and only in 2014 the e-MID market went\nback to a normal bipartite organization. By investigating the strategy of\nindividual banks, we explore possible explanations and we show that the\ndisappearance of many lending banks and the strategy switch of a very small set\nof banks from borrower to lender is likely at the origin of this structural\nchange.\n", "  The Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system is often used to govern the motion of\nplasmas consisting of electrons and ions with disparate masses when collisions\nof charged particles are described by the two-component Boltzmann collision\noperator. The perturbation theory of the system around global Maxwellians\nrecently has been well established in [42]. It should be more interesting to\nfurther study the existence and stability of nontrivial large time asymptotic\nprofiles for the system even with slab symmetry in space, particularly\nunderstanding the effect of the self-consistent potential on the non-trivial\nlong-term dynamics of the binary system. In the paper, we consider the problem\nin the setting of rarefaction waves. The analytical tool is based on the\nmacro-micro decomposition introduced in [59] that we can be able to develop\ninto the case for the two-component Boltzmann equations around local\nbi-Maxwellians. Our focus is to explore how the disparate masses and charges of\nparticles play a role in the analysis of the approach of the complex coupling\nsystem time-asymptotically toward a non-constant equilibrium state whose\nmacroscopic quantities satisfy the quasineutral nonisentropic Euler system.\n", "  The $q$-theory formalism aims to describe the thermodynamics and dynamics of\nthe deep quantum vacuum. The thermodynamics leads to an exact cancellation of\nthe quantum-field zero-point-energies in equilibrium, which partly solves the\nmain cosmological constant problem. But, with reversible dynamics, the\nspatially-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe asymptotically approaches\nthe Minkowski vacuum only if the Big Bang already started out in an initial\nequilibrium state. Here, we extend $q$-theory by introducing dissipation from\nirreversible processes. Neglecting the possible instability of a de-Sitter\nvacuum, we obtain different scenarios with either a de-Sitter asymptote or\ncollapse to a final singularity. The Minkowski asymptote still requires\nfine-tuning of the initial conditions. This suggests that, within the\n$q$-theory approach, the decay of the de-Sitter vacuum is a necessary condition\nfor the dynamical solution of the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  We compute genus-zero Gromov--Witten invariants of Calabi--Yau complete\nintersection 3-folds in Grassmannians using supersymmetric localization in\nA-twisted non-Abelian gauged linear sigma models. We also discuss a\nSeiberg-like duality interchanging Gr(n,m) and Gr(m-n,m).\n", "  We demonstrate that SDYM equations for the Lie algebra of one-dimensional\nvector fields represent a natural reduction in the framework of general\nlinearly degenerate dispersionless hierarchy. We define the reduction in terms\nof wave functions, introduce generating relation, Lax-Sato equations and the\ndressing scheme for the reduced hierarchy. Multidimensional case is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Using a perturbative treatment, we quantify the influence of non-adiabatic\nleakage and system dissipation on the transfer fidelity of a stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) process. We find that, optimizing transfer time\nrather than coupling profiles, leads to a significant improvement of the\ntransfer fidelity. The upper bound of the fidelity has been found as a simple\nanalytical function of system cooperativities. We also provide a systematic\napproach to reach this upper bound efficiently.\n", "  The study of interacting spin systems is of fundamental importance for modern\ncondensed matter physics. On frustrated lattices, magnetic exchange\ninteractions cannot be simultaneously satisfied, and often give rise to\ncompeting exotic ground states. The frustrated 2D Shastry-Sutherland lattice\nrealized by SrCu2(BO3)2 is an important test to our understanding of quantum\nmagnetism. It was constructed to have an exactly solvable 2-spin dimer singlet\nground state within a certain range of exchange parameters and frustration.\nWhile the exact dimer state and the antiferromagnetic order at both ends of the\nphase diagram are well known, the ground state and spin correlations in the\nintermediate frustration range have been widely debated. We report here the\nfirst experimental identification of the conjectured plaquette singlet\nintermediate phase in SrCu2(BO3)2. It is observed by inelastic neutron\nscattering after pressure tuning at 21.5 kbar. This gapped plaquette singlet\nstate with strong 4-spin correlations leads to a transition to an ordered Neel\nstate above 40 kbar, which can realize a deconfined quantum critical point.\n", "  For a grand canonical ensemble of classical point-like particles at\nequilibrium in continuous space we investigate the functional relationship\nbetween a stable and regular pair potential describing the interaction of the\nparticles and the thermodynamical limit of the Ursell or pair correlation\nfunction. For certain admissible perturbations of the pair potential and\nsufficiently small activity we rigorously establish Frechet differentiability\nof the Ursell function in the $L^1$ norm. Furthermore, concerning the\nthermodynamical limit of the pair distribution function we explicitly compute\nits Fr\\'echet derivative as a sum of a multiplication operator and an integral\noperator.\n", "  We propose a practical approach to manipulate the counter-rotating (CR)\ninteractions in the quantum Rabi model by introducing a sinusoidal modulation\nto the transition frequency of the quantum two-level system in this model. By\nchoosing appropriate modulation frequency and amplitude, enhancement and\nsuppression of the CR interactions can be achieved in the Jaynes-Cummings\nregime (including both weak- and strong-coupling cases) as well as the\nultrastrong-coupling regime. In particular, we calculate the output photon\nemission of the cavity vacuum state under enhanced CR terms. Our results show\nthat continuous and steady photon emission from the cavity vacuum can be\nobserved in the Jaynes-Cummings regime as a consequence of this enhancement.\nOur approach can be realized in superconducting quantum circuits.\n", "  The enigmatic cuprate superconductors have attracted resurgent interest with\nseveral recent reports and discussions of competing orders in the underdoped\nside. Motivated by this, here we address the natural question of fragility of\nthe d-wave superconducting state in underdoped cuprates. Using a combination of\ntheoretical approaches we study t-J like models, and discover an - as yet\nunexplored - instability that is brought about by an \"internal\" (anti-symmetric\nmode) fluctuation of the d-wave state. This new theoretical result is in good\nagreement with recent STM and ARPES studies of cuprates. We also suggest\nexperimental directions to uncover this physics.\n", "  It is shown that the Bethe ansatz formulation of the easy-plane 1D Heisenberg\nmodel thermodynamics (TBA) by Takahashi and Suzuki and the subsequent analysis\nof the spin Drude weight, also reproduces the thermal Drude weight and\nmagnetothermal coefficient obtained by the Quantum Transfer Matrix method\n(QTM). It can also be extended to study the far-out of equilibrium energy\ncurrent generated at the interface between two semi-infinite chains held at\ndifferent temperatures.\n", "  In this paper, a detailed analysis for superradiant stability of the system\ncomposed by a $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS)\nblack hole and a reflecting mirror under charged scalar perturbations are\npresented in the linear regime. It is found that the stability of the system is\nheavily affected by the mirror radius as well as the mass of the scalar\nperturbation, AdS radius and the dimension of space-time. In a higher\ndimensional space-time, the degree of instability of the superradiant modes\nwill be severely weakened. Nevertheless, the degree of instability can be\nmagnified significantly by choosing a suitable value of the mirror radius.\nRemarkably, when the mirror radius is smaller than a threshold value the system\nbecomes stable. We also find that massive charged scalar fields cannot trigger\nthe instabilities in the background of $D$-dimensional asymptotically flat RN\nblack hole. For a given scalar charge, a small RN-AdS black hole can be\nsuperradiantly unstable, while a large one may be always stable under charged\nscalar field with or without a reflecting mirror. We also show that these\nresults can be easily expounded and understood with the help of factorized\npotential analysis.\n", "  We demonstrate with an experiment how molecules are a natural test-bed for\nprobing fundamental quantum thermodynamics. Single-molecule spectroscopy has\nundergone transformative change in the past decade with the advent of\ntechniques permitting individual molecules to be distinguished and probed. By\nconsidering the time-resolved emission spectrum of organic molecules as arising\nfrom quantum jumps between states, we demonstrate that the quantum Jarzynski\nequality is satisfied in this set-up. This relates the heat dissipated into the\nenvironment to the free energy difference between the initial and final state.\nWe demonstrate also how utilizing the quantum Jarzynski equality allows for the\ndetection of energy shifts within a molecule, beyond the relative shift.\n", "  We define `astromaterial science' as the study of materials in astronomical\nobjects that are qualitatively denser than materials on earth. Astromaterials\ncan have unique properties related to their large density, though they may be\norganized in ways similar to more conventional materials. By analogy to\nterrestrial materials, we divide our study of astromaterials into hard and soft\nand discuss one example of each. The hard astromaterial discussed here is a\ncrystalline lattice, such as the Coulomb crystals in the interior of cold white\ndwarfs and in the crust of neutron stars, while the soft astromaterial is\nnuclear pasta found in the inner crusts of neutron stars. In particular, we\ndiscuss how molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the\nproperties of astromaterials to interpret observations of white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. Coulomb crystals are studied to understand how compact stars\nfreeze. Their incredible strength may make crust \"mountains\" on rotating\nneutron stars a source for gravitational waves that the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) may detect. Nuclear pasta is expected\nnear the base of the neutron star crust at densities of $10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$.\nCompetition between nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion rearranges\nneutrons and protons into complex non-spherical shapes such as sheets (lasagna)\nor tubes (spaghetti). Semi-classical molecular dynamics simulations of nuclear\npasta have been used to study these phases and calculate their transport\nproperties such as neutrino opacity, thermal conductivity, and electrical\nconductivity. Observations of neutron stars may be sensitive to these\nproperties, and can be be used to interpret observations of supernova\nneutrinos, magnetic field decay, and crust cooling of accreting neutron stars.\nWe end by comparing nuclear pasta shapes with some similar shapes seen in\nbiological systems.\n", "  We present the first stable release of Halotools (v0.2), a community-driven\nPython package designed to build and test models of the galaxy-halo connection.\nHalotools provides a modular platform for creating mock universes of galaxies\nstarting from a catalog of dark matter halos obtained from a cosmological\nsimulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe\ngalaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution (HOD), the conditional\nluminosity function (CLF), abundance matching, and alternatives to these models\nthat include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy\nassembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos, or to\nfollow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial\nand/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has\nan optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy\npopulation, including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy group\nidentification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and\nothers, allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is\nobject-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple,\ninterchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has\nan automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on\nhttp://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code\nnotes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an\nonline textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation\nwith Python.\n", "  We provide a systematic treatment of the tenfold way of classifying fermionic\nsystems that naturally allows for the study of those with arbitrary $N$-body\ninteractions. We identify four types of symmetries that such systems can\npossess, which consist of one ordinary type (usual unitary symmetries), and\nthree non-ordinary symmetries (such as time reversal, charge conjugation and\nsublattice). Focusing on systems that possess no non-trivial ordinary\nsymmetries, we demonstrate that the non-ordinary symmetries are strongly\nconstrained. This approach not only leads very naturally to the tenfold\nclasses, but also obtains the canonical representations of these symmetries in\neach of the ten classes. We also provide a group cohomological perspective of\nour results in terms of projective representations. We then use the canonical\nrepresentations of the symmetries to obtain the structure of Hamiltonians with\narbitrary $N$-body interactions in each of the ten classes. We show that the\nspace of $N$-body Hamiltonians has an affine subspace (of a vector space)\nstructure in classes which have either or both charge conjugation and\nsublattice symmetries. Our results can help address open questions on the\ntopological classification of interacting fermionic systems.\n", "  We compute the modular data (that is, the $S$ and $T$ matrices) for the\ncentre of the extended Haagerup subfactor. The full structure (i.e. the\nassociativity data, also known as 6-$j$ symbols or $F$ matrices) still appears\nto be inaccessible. Nevertheless, starting with just the number of simple\nobjects and their dimensions (obtained by a combinatorial argument in\narXiv:1404.3955) we find that it is surprisingly easy to leverage knowledge of\nthe representation theory of $SL (2, \\mathbb Z)$ into a complete description of\nthe modular data. We also investigate the possible character vectors associated\nwith this modular data.\n", "  We propose a framework for the visualization of directed networks relying on\nthe eigenfunctions of the magnetic Laplacian, called here Magnetic Eigenmaps.\nThe magnetic Laplacian is a complex deformation of the well-known combinatorial\nLaplacian. Features such as density of links and directionality patterns are\nrevealed by plotting the phases of the first magnetic eigenvectors. An\ninterpretation of the magnetic eigenvectors is given in connection with the\nangular synchronization problem. Illustrations of our method are given for both\nartificial and real networks.\n", "  The system with externally polarized dipole molecules at half-filling moving\nalong a one-dimensional zig-zag chain is studied theoretically, including the\nground-state phase diagram. The dipoles are oriented in-plane. Together with\nthe geometry of the chain this gives rise to a bond-alternating nearest\nneighbor interaction due to simultaneous attractive and repulsive interactions.\nBecause of the quantum Zeno effect due to the reactive nature of molecules the\nsystem can be treated as hard-core. By tuning the ratio between the\nnearest-neighbor interaction and hopping, various phases can be accessed by\ncontrolling the polarization angle. In the ultra-strong coupling limit, the\nsystem simplifies to a frustrated extended axial Ising model. For the small\ncoupling limit, qualitative discussion of the ordering behavior using effective\nfield theory arguments is provided. We show that when chain angle is small, the\nsystem mostly exhibits BKT-type phase transitions, whereas large chain angle\nwould drive the system into a gapped (Ising) dimerized phase, where the hopping\nstrength is closely related to the orientation of dimerized pairs.\n", "  In this study, we focus on the bosonic decays of light charged Higgs bosons\nin the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I. We quantify the Branching Ratios\n(BRs) of the $H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm h$ and $H^\\pm\\to W^\\pm A$ channels and show that\nthey could be substantial over several areas of the parameter space of the 2HDM\nType-I that are still allowed by Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other\nexperimental data as well as theoretical constraints. We suggest that $H^\\pm\n\\to W^\\pm h$ and/or $H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm A$ could be used as a feasible discovery\nchannel alternative to $H^\\pm \\to \\tau\\nu$.\n", "  We consider weakly-coupled theories of massive higher-spin particles. This\nclass of models includes, for instance, tree-level String Theory and Large-N\nYang-Mills theory. The S-matrix in such theories is a meromorphic function\nobeying unitarity and crossing symmetry. We discuss the (unphysical) regime\n$s,t \\gg 1$, in which we expect the amplitude to be universal and exponentially\nlarge. We develop methods to study this regime and show that the amplitude\nnecessarily coincides with the Veneziano amplitude there. In particular, this\nimplies that the leading Regge trajectory, $j(t)$, is asymptotically linear in\nYang-Mills theory. Further, our analysis shows that any such theory of\nhigher-spin particles has stringy excitations and infinitely many\nasymptotically parallel subleading trajectories. More generally, we argue that,\nunder some assumptions, any theory with at least one higher-spin particle must\nhave strings.\n", "  We develop methods to probe the excitation spectrum of topological phases of\nmatter in two spatial dimensions. Applying these to the Fibonacci string nets\nperturbed away from exact solvability, we analyze a topological phase\ntransition driven by the condensation of non-Abelian anyons. Our numerical\nresults illustrate how such phase transitions involve the spontaneous breaking\nof a topological symmetry, generalizing the traditional Landau paradigm. The\nmain technical tool is the characterization of the ground states using tensor\nnetworks and the topological properties using matrix-product-operator\nsymmetries. The topological phase transition manifests itself by symmetry\nbreaking in the entanglement degrees of freedom of the quantum transfer matrix.\n", "  We present the first scientific results from the luminous red galaxy sample\n(LRG) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). We\nmeasure the small and intermediate scale clustering from a sample of more than\n61,000 galaxies in the redshift range $0.6 < z < 0.9$. We interpret these\nmeasurements in the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution. The bias of\neBOSS LRGs is $2.30 \\pm 0.03$, with a satellite fraction of $13\\pm3$\\% and a\nmean halo mass of $2.5\\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$. These results are\nconsistent with expectations, demonstrating that eBOSS galaxies will be\nreliable tracers of large scale structure at $z\\sim 0.7$. The eBOSS galaxy bias\nimplies a scatter of luminosity at fixed halo mass, $\\sigma_{\\log L}$, of 0.19\ndex. Using the clustering of massive galaxies from BOSS-CMASS, BOSS-LOWZ, and\nSDSS, we find that $\\sigma_{\\log L}=0.19$ is consistent with observations over\nthe full redshift range that these samples cover. The addition of eBOSS to\nprevious surveys allows investigation of the evolution of massive galaxies over\nthe past $\\sim 7$ Gyr.\n", "  This is the foreword to the special volume on localization techniques in\nquantum field theory. We summarize the individual chapters and their relation.\n", "  This is the introductory chapter to the volume. We review the main idea of\nthe localization technique and its brief history both in geometry and in QFT.\nWe discuss localization in diverse dimensions and give an overview of the major\napplications of the localization calculations for supersymmetric theories. We\nexplain the focus of the present volume.\n", "  Review of localization in geometry: equivariant cohomology, characteristic\nclasses, Atiyah-Bott formula, Atiyah-Singer equivariant index formula,\nMathai-Quillen formalism\n", "  This is an introductory review to localization techniques in supersymmetric\ntwo-dimensional gauge theories. In particular we describe how to construct\nLagrangians of N=(2,2) theories on curved spaces, and how to compute their\npartition functions and certain correlators on the sphere, the hemisphere and\nother curved backgrounds. We also describe how to evaluate the partition\nfunction of N=(0,2) theories on the torus, known as the elliptic genus. Finally\nwe summarize some of the applications, in particular to probe mirror symmetry\nand other non-perturbative dualities.\n", "  We give a pedagogical review of the computation of Gromov-Witten invariants\nvia localization in 2D gauged linear sigma models. We explain the relationship\nbetween the two-sphere partition function of the theory and the Kahler\npotential on the conformal manifold. We show how the Kahler potential can be\nassembled from classical, perturbative, and non-perturbative contributions, and\nexplain how the non-perturbative contributions are related to the Gromov-Witten\ninvariants of the corresponding Calabi-Yau manifold. We then explain how\nlocalization enables efficient calculation of the two-sphere partition function\nand, ultimately, the Gromov-Witten invariants themselves.\n", "  In this review, we give a pedagogical introduction to a systematic framework\nfor constructing and analyzing supersymmetric field theories on curved\nspacetime manifolds. The framework is based on the use of off-shell\nsupergravity background fields. We present the general principles, which\nbroadly apply to theories with different amounts of supersymmetry in diverse\ndimensions, as well as specific applications to N=1 theories in four dimensions\nand their three-dimensional cousins with N=2 supersymmetry.\n", "  In this review article we describe the localization of three dimensional N=2\nsupersymmetric theories on compact manifolds, including the squashed sphere,\nS^3_b, the lens space, S^3_b/Z_p, and S^2 x S^1. We describe how to write\nsupersymmetric actions on these spaces, and then compute the partition\nfunctions and other supersymmetric observables by employing the localization\nargument. We briefly survey some applications of these computations.\n", "  We review some exact results for the matrix models appearing in the\nlocalization of Chern-Simons-matter theories, focusing on the structure of\nnon-perturbative effects and onthe M-theory expansion of ABJM theory. We also\nsummarize some of the results obtained for other Chern-Simons-matter theories,\nas well as recent applications to topological strings.\n", "  This contribution contains a review of the role of the three-sphere free\nenergy F in recent developments related to the F-theorem and F-maximization.\nThe F-theorem states that for any Lorentz-invariant RG trajectory connecting a\nconformal field theory CFT_UV in the ultraviolet to a conformal field theory\nCFT_IR, the F-coefficient decreases: F_UV > F_IR. I provide many examples of\nCFTs where one can compute F, approximately or exactly, and discuss various\nchecks of the F-theorem. F-maximization is the principle that in an N=2 SCFT,\nviewed as the deep IR limit of an RG trajectory preserving N=2 supersymmetry,\nthe superconformal R-symmetry maximizes F within the set of all R-symmetries\npreserved by the RG trajectory. I review the derivation of this result and\nprovide examples.\n", "  We present an elementary review of some aspects of Chern-Simons theory with\ncomplex gauge group SL(N,C). We discuss some of the challenges in defining the\ntheory as a full-fledged TQFT, as well as some successes inspired by the 3d-3d\ncorrespondence. The 3d-3d correspondence relates partition functions (and other\naspects) of complex Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold M to supersymmetric\npartition functions (and other observables) in an associated 3d theory T[M].\nMany of these observables may be computed by supersymmetric localization. We\npresent several prominent applications to 3-manifold topology and number theory\nin light of the 3d-3d correspondence.\n", "  We review exact results in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories defined on S^4\nand its deformation. We first summarize the construction of rigid SUSY theories\non curved backgrounds based on off-shell supergravity, then explain how to\napply localization principle to supersymmetric path integrals. Closed formulae\nfor partition function as well as expectation values of non-local BPS\nobservables are presented.\n", "  An interplay between localization and holography is reviewed with the\nemphasis on the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence.\n", "  An elementary introduction to the 2d/4d correspondences is given. After\nquickly reviewing the 2d q-deformed Yang-Mills theory and the Liouville theory,\nwe will introduce 4d theories obtained by coupling trifundamentals to SU(2)\ngauge fields. We will then see concretely that the supersymmetric partition\nfunction of these theories on S^3 x S^1 and on S^4 is given respectively by the\nq-deformed Yang-Mills theory and the Liouville theory. After giving a short\ndiscussion on how this correspondence may be understood from the viewpoint of\nthe 6d N=(2,0) theory, we conclude the review by enumerating future directions.\nMost of the technical points will be referred to more detailed review articles.\n", "  We review the calculation and properties of the supersymmetric index for four\ndimensional N=1 theories, illustrating its physical significance in several\nexamples.\n", "  We give a pedagogical review of the localization of supersymmetric gauge\ntheory on 5d toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. We construct the cohomological\ncomplex resulting from supersymmetry and consider its natural toric\ndeformations with all equivariant parameters turned on. We also give detailed\ndiscussion on how the Sasaki-Einstein geometry permeates every aspect of the\ncalculation, from Killing spinor, vanishing theorems to the index theorems.\n", "  In this contribution to the review on localization in gauge theories we\ninvestigate the matrix models derived from localizing N=1 super Yang-Mills on\nS^5. We consider the large-N limit and attempt to solve the matrix model by a\nsaddle-point approximation. In general it is not possible to find an analytic\nsolution, but at the weak and the strong limits of the 't Hooft coupling there\nare dramatic simplifications that allows us to extract most of the interesting\ninformation. At weak coupling we show that the matrix model is close to the\nGaussian matrix model and that the free-energy scales as N^2. At strong\ncoupling we show that if the theory contains one adjoint hypermultiplet then\nthe free-energy scales as N^3. We also find the expectation value of a\nsupersymmetric Wilson loop that wraps the equator. We demonstrate how to\nextract the effective couplings and reproduce results of Seiberg. Finally, we\ncompare to results for the six-dimensional (2,0) theory derived using the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. We show that by choosing the hypermultiplet mass such\nthat the supersymmetry is enhanced to N=2, the Wilson loop result matches the\nanalogous calculation using AdS/CFT. The free-energies differ by a rational\nfraction.\n", "  We review the holomorphic block factorisation of partition functions of\nsupersymmetric theories on compact manifolds in various dimensions. We then\nshow how to interpret 3d and 5d partition functions as correlation functions\nwith underlying symmetry given by a deformation of the Virasoro algebra.\n", "  We review some recent developments in the 6 dimensional (2, 0) superconformal\nfield theories, focusing on their BPS spectra in the Coulomb and symmetric\nphases computed by various Witten indices. We shall discuss the instanton\npartition function of 5d maximal super-Yang-Mills theory, and the 6d\nsuperconformal index.\n", "  We investigate the ground state energies of vector $\\rho^{\\pm}$ and $K^{\\pm\n*}$ mesons depending on the magnetic field value in the $SU(3)$ lattice gauge\ntheory. It has been shown that the energy of a vector particle depends on its\nspin projection on the field axis. The magnetic dipole polarizability and\nhyperpolarizabilities give significant contributions to the energy value which\nprevents the formation of the charged vector meson condensate at high magnetic\nfields. We calculate the g-factor of $\\rho^{\\pm}$ and $K^{\\pm*}$ mesons and the\ndipole magnetic polarizability of $\\rho^{\\pm}$ mesons.\n", "  We find exact solutions to Maxwell equations written in terms of four-vector\npotentials in non--rotating, as well as in G\\\"odel and Kerr spacetimes. We show\nthat Maxwell equations can be reduced to two uncoupled second-order\ndifferential equations for combinations of the components of the four-vector\npotential. Exact electromagnetic waves solutions are written on given\ngravitational field backgrounds where they evolve. We find that in\nnon--rotating spherical symmetric spacetimes, electromagnetic waves travel\nalong null geodesics. However, electromagnetic waves on G\\\"odel and Kerr\nspacetimes do not exhibit that behavior.\n", "  According to a recent classification of 6d (1,0) theories within F-theory\nthere are only six \"pure\" 6d gauge theories which have a UV superconformal\nfixed point. The corresponding gauge groups are $SU(3),SO(8),F_4,E_6,E_7$, and\n$E_8$. These exceptional models have BPS strings which are also instantons for\nthe corresponding gauge groups. For $G$ simply-laced, we determine the 2d\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ worldsheet theories of such BPS instanton strings by a\nsimple geometric engineering argument. These are given by a twisted $S^2$\ncompactification of the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of type $H_2, D_4, E_6,\nE_7$ and $E_8$ (and their higher rank generalizations), where the 6d instanton\nnumber is mapped to the rank of the corresponding 4d SCFT. This determines\ntheir anomaly polynomials and, via topological strings, establishes an\ninteresting relation among the corresponding $T^2 \\times S^2$ partition\nfunctions and the Hilbert series for moduli spaces of $G$ instantons. Such\nrelations allow to bootstrap the corresponding elliptic genera by modularity.\nAs an example of such procedure, the elliptic genera for a single instanton\nstring are determined. The same method also fixes the elliptic genus for case\nof one $ F_4 $ instanton. These results unveil a rather surprising relation\nwith the Schur index of the corresponding 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ models.\n", "  We report the dynamics of soft phonon modes and their role towards the\nvarious structural transformations in Aurivillius materials by employing\nterahertz frequency-domain spectroscopy, atomic pair distribution function\nanalysis, and first-principles calculations. We have chosen Bi4Ti3O12 as a\nmodel system and identified soft phonon modes associated with the paraelectric\ntetragonal to the ferroelectric monoclinic transition. Three soft phonon modes\nhave been discovered which exhibit a strong temperature dependence. We have\ndetermined that the anharmonicity in Bi-O bonds plays a significant role in\nphonon softening and that Bi cations play an important role in the emergence of\nferroelectricity.\n", "  For near-Sun missions, the spacecraft approaches very close to the Sun and\nspace environmental effects become relevant. Strong restrictions on how much\nclose it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials\ncan stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and\nfunctionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given\nmission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The\ntemperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:\nreflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is\nconsidered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are\nconstant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the\ntemperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the\naerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on\nthe heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical\nproperties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly\nproportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as\n$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the\nsame temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,\neventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun\nwithout compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace\nstructures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of\ncomposite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity -\nare defined.\n", "  We theoretically analyze the eigenfunction fluctuation measures for a\nHermitian ensemble which appears as an intermediate state of the perturbation\nof a stationary ensemble by another stationary ensemble of Laguerre type.\nSimilar to the perturbation by a Gaussian stationary ensemble, the measures\nundergo a diffusive dynamics in terms of the pertubation parameter along with a\ndrift due to level-repulsion. The energy-dependences of the fluctuations for\nthe Laguerre case is in general different from the Gaussian case but locally\nthey can be expressed in a same mathematical form.\n", "  Phase-tunable hybrid devices, built upon nanostructures combining normal\nmetal and superconductors, have been the subject of intense studies due to\ntheir numerous combinations of different charge and heat transport\nconfigurations. They exhibit solid applications in quantum metrology and\ncoherent caloritronics. Here we propose and realize a new kind of hybrid device\nwith potential application in single charge manipulation and quantized current\ngeneration. We show that by tuning superconductivity on two proximized\nnanowires, coupled via a Coulombic normal metal island, we are able to control\nits charge state configuration. This device supports a\none-control-parameter-cycle being actuated by the sole magnetic flux. In a\nvoltage biased regime, the phase-tunable superconducting gaps can act as energy\nbarriers for charge quanta leading to an additional degree of freedom in single\nelectronics. The resulting configuration is fully electrostatic and the current\nacross the device is governed by the quasiparticle populations in the source\nand drain leads. Notably, the proposed device can be realized using standard\nnanotechniques opening the possibility to a straightforward coupling with the\nnowadays well developed superconducting electronics.\n", "  We present a numerical simulation of the dynamical interaction between the\nproposed Planet Nine and a debris disk around the Sun for $4{\\rm Gyr}$,\naccounting for the secular perturbation of the four giant planets in two\nscenarios: (a) an initially thin circular disk around the Sun (b) inclined and\neccentric disk. We show, in both scenarios, that Planet Nine governs the\ndynamics in between $1000{\\rm -5000{\\rm AU}}$ and forms spherical structure in\nthe inner part ($\\sim1000{\\rm AU}$) and inclined disk. This structure is the\noutcome of mean motion resonances and secular interaction with Planet Nine. We\ncompare the morphology of this structure with the outcome from a fly-by\nencounter of a star with the debris disk and show distinct differences between\nthe two cases. We predict that this structure serves as a source of comets and\ncalculate the resulting comet production rate to be detectable.\n", "  To understand the rich electronic phase diagram in FeSe under pressure that\nvividly demonstrates the strong interplay between the nematicity, magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, we analyze the electronic states by including the\nhigher-order many-body effects called the vertex correction (VC). We predict\nthe pressure-induced emergence of xy-orbital hole-pocket based on the\nfirst-principles analysis. Due to this pressure-induced Lifshitz transition,\nthe spin fluctuations on the xy orbital are enhanced, whereas those on xz,yz\norbitals are gradually reduced. For this reason, nonmagnetic orbital order $O =\nn_{xz} - n_{yz}$, which is driven by the spin fluctuations on xz,yz orbitals\nthrough the intra-orbital VCs, is suppressed, and it is replaced with the\nmagnetism of xy-orbital d-electrons. The nodal s-wave state at ambient pressure\n($O > 0$) and the enhancement of Tc under pressure are driven by the\ncooperation between the spin and orbital fluctuations.\n", "  Tunneling between two classically disconnected regular regions can be\nstrongly affected by the presence of a chaotic sea in between. This phenomenon,\nknown as chaos-assisted tunneling, gives rise to large fluctuations of the\ntunneling rate. Here we study chaos-assisted tunneling in the presence of\nAnderson localization effects in the chaotic sea. Our results show that the\nstandard tunneling rate distribution is strongly modified by localization,\ngoing from the known Cauchy distribution in the ergodic regime to a log-normal\ndistribution in the strongly localized case. We develop an analytical\nsingle-parameter scaling theory which accurately describes the numerical data,\nfor both a deterministic and a disordered model. Several possible experimental\nimplementations using cold atoms, photonic lattices or microwave billiards are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the capability of the DUNE experiment, which will be the first beam\nbased experiment with a wide band flux profile, to uncover the octant of the\nleptonic mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ (i.e., $\\theta_{23}$ is $< 45^\\circ$ or\n$>45^\\circ$). In this work, we find that for the DUNE baseline of 1300 km, due\nto enhanced matter effect, the neutrino and antineutrino probabilities are\ndifferent which creates a tension in the case of combined runs because of which\noctant sensitivity also can come from disappearance channel. In view of this,\nwe study the physics of antineutrinos in DUNE and explore the role of\nantineutrinos run that is required to resolve the octant degeneracy at a\ncertain confidence levels.\n", "  What is the meaning of entanglement in a theory of extended objects such as\nstrings? To address this question we consider the spatial entanglement between\ntwo intervals in the Gross-Taylor model, the string theory dual to\ntwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory at large $N$. The string diagrams that\ncontribute to the entanglement entropy describe open strings with endpoints\nanchored to the entangling surface, as first argued by Susskind. We develop a\ncanonical theory of these open strings, and describe how closed strings are\ndivided into open strings at the level of the Hilbert space. We derive the\nModular hamiltonian for the Hartle-Hawking state and show that the\ncorresponding reduced density matrix describes a thermal ensemble of open\nstrings ending on an object at the entangling surface that we call an E-brane.\n", "  We discuss several phenomenological implications of Very Special Relativity\n(VSR). It is assumed that there is a small violation of Lorentz invariance and\nthe true symmetry group of nature is a subgroup called SIM(2). This symmetry\ngroup postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in\nspace-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which\nviolates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of\nfinding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the\npresence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we\npursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum\nexperiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a\nsignal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a\ndedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming\nthat signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on\nthe VSR parameters. We also study the implications of VSR in particle decay\nexperiments taking the charged pion and kaon decay as an example. The effective\ninteraction between the charged pion and the final state leptons is related to\nthe fundamental VSR mass terms through a loop calculation. We also predict a\nshift in the angular dependence of the decay products due to VSR. In particular\nwe find that these no longer display azimuthal symmetry with respect to the\nmomentum of the pion. Furthermore the azimuthal and polar angle distributions\nshow time dependence with a period of a sidereal day. This time dependence\nprovides us with a novel method to test VSR in future experiments.\n", "  Graph partitioning problems emerge in a wide variety of complex systems,\nranging from biology to finance, but can be rigorously analyzed and solved only\nfor a few graph ensembles. Here, an ensemble of equitable graphs, i.e. random\ngraphs with a block-regular structure, is studied, for which analytical results\ncan be obtained. In particular, the spectral density of this ensemble is\ncomputed exactly for a modular and bipartite structure. Kesten-McKay's law for\nrandom regular graphs is found analytically to apply also for modular and\nbipartite structures when blocks are homogeneous. Exact solution to graph\npartitioning for two equal-sized communities is proposed and verified\nnumerically, and a conjecture on the absence of an efficient recovery\ndetectability transition in equitable graphs is suggested. Final discussion\nsummarizes results and outlines their relevance for the solution of graph\npartitioning problems in other graph ensembles, in particular for the study of\ndetectability thresholds and resolution limits in stochastic block models.\n", "  The prospects for the habitability of M-dwarf planets have long been debated,\ndue to key differences between the unique stellar and planetary environments\naround these low-mass stars, as compared to hotter, more luminous Sun-like\nstars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space-\nand ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to\norbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs\nare hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of\nJupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a\nthird of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where\nthey have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical\nstudies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the\ninteraction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the\natmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill\nin knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers\npublished nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007).\nIn this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of\nM-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over\nthe past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly\nevolving field.\n", "  I propose a quantum gravity model in which geometric space emerges from\nrandom bits in a quantum phase transition driven by the combinatorial\nOllivier-Ricci curvature and corresponding to the condensation of short cycles\nin random graphs. This quantum critical point defines quantum gravity\nnon-perturbatively. In the ordered geometric phase at large distances the\naction reduces to the standard Einstein-Hilbert term.\n", "  For systems of unstable particles that mix with each other, an approximation\nof the fully momentum-dependent propagator matrix is presented in terms of a\nsum of simple Breit-Wigner propagators that are multiplied with finite on-shell\nwave function normalisation factors. The latter are evaluated at the complex\npoles of the propagators. The pole structure of general propagator matrices is\ncarefully analysed, and it is demonstrated that in the proposed approximation\nimaginary parts arising from absorptive parts of loop integrals are properly\ntaken into account. Applying the formalism to the neutral MSSM Higgs sector\nwith complex parameters, very good numerical agreement is found between cross\nsections based on the full propagators and the corresponding cross sections\nbased on the described approximation. The proposed approach does not only\ntechnically simplify the treatment of propagators with non-vanishing\noff-diagonal contributions, it is shown that it can also facilitate an improved\ntheoretical prediction of the considered observables via a more precise\nimplementation of the total widths of the involved particles. It is also\nwell-suited for the incorporation of interference effects arising from\noverlapping resonances.\n", "  We consider Gibbs measures on the configuration space $S^{\\mathbb{Z}^d}$,\nwhere mostly $d\\geq 2$ and $S$ is a finite set. We start by a short review on\nconcentration inequalities for Gibbs measures. In the Dobrushin uniqueness\nregime, we have a Gaussian concentration bound, whereas in the Ising model (and\nrelated models) at sufficiently low temperature, we control all moments and\nhave a stretched-exponential concentration bound. We then give several\napplications of these inequalities whereby we obtain various new results.\nAmongst these applications, we get bounds on the speed of convergence of the\nempirical measure in the sense of Kantorovich distance, fluctuation bounds in\nthe Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem, fluctuation bounds for the first\noccurrence of a pattern, as well as almost-sure central limit theorems.\n", "  We propose separability criteria for three-qubit states in terms of diagonal\nand anti-diagonal entries to detect entanglement with positive partial\ntransposes. We report that the phases, that is, the angular parts of\nanti-diagonal entries, play a crucial role in determining whether a given\nthree-qubit state is separable or entangled, and they must obey even an\nidentity for separability in some cases. These criteria are strong enough to\ndetect PPT (positive partial transpose) entanglement with nonzero volume. In\nseveral cases when all the entries are zero except for diagonal and\nanti-diagonal entries, we characterize separability using phases. These include\nthe cases when anti-diagonal entries of such states share a common magnitude,\nand when ranks are less than or equal to six. We also compute the lengths of\nrank six cases, and find three-qubit separable states with lengths $8$ whose\nmaximum ranks of partial transposes are $7$.\n", "  The charge and magnetic form factors, FC and FM, of 3He have been extracted\nin the kinematic range 25 fm-2 < Q2 < 61 fm-2 from elastic electron scattering\nby detecting 3He recoil nuclei and electrons in coincidence with the High\nResolution Spectrometers of the Hall A Facility at Jefferson Lab. The\nmeasurements are indicative of a second diffraction minimum for the magnetic\nform factor, which was predicted in the Q2 range of this experiment, and of a\ncontinuing diffractive structure for the charge form factor. The data are in\nqualitative agreement with theoretical calculations based on realistic\ninteractions and accurate methods to solve the three-body nuclear problem.\n", "  The analytical solution of the boundary problem on behaviour (oscillations)\nof the electronic plasmas with arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic\ngas in a slab of the conducting medium is received. The kinetic\nVlasov---Boltzmann equation with integral of collisions type BGK (Bhatnagar,\nGross and Krook) and Maxwell equation for electric field are applied. Mirror\n(reflections) boundary conditions are used.\n", "  The picture of how a gap closes in a semiconductor has been radically\ntransformed by topological concepts. Instead of the gap closing and immediately\nre-opening, topological arguments predict that, in the absence of inversion\nsymmetry, a metallic phase protected by Weyl nodes persists over a finite\ninterval of the tuning parameter (e.g. pressure $P$) . The gap re-appears when\nthe Weyl nodes mutually annihilate. We report evidence that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te\nexhibits this topological metallic phase. Using pressure to tune the gap, we\nhave tracked the nucleation of a Fermi surface droplet that rapidly grows in\nvolume with $P$. In the metallic state we observe a large Berry curvature which\ndominates the Hall effect. Moreover, a giant negative magnetoresistance is\nobserved in the insulating side of phase boundaries, in accord with \\emph{ab\ninitio} calculations. The results confirm the existence of a topological\nmetallic phase over a finite pressure interval.\n", "  We compute the one-loop divergences in a higher-derivative theory of gravity\nincluding Ricci tensor squared and Ricci scalar squared terms, in addition to\nthe Hilbert and cosmological terms, on an (generally off-shell) Einstein\nbackground. We work with a two-parameter family of parametrizations of the\ngraviton field, and a two-parameter family of gauges. We find that there are\nsome choices of gauge or parametrization that reduce the dependence on the\nremaining parameters. The results are invariant under a recently discovered\n\"duality\" that involves the replacement of the densitized metric by a\ndensitized inverse metric as the fundamental quantum variable.\n", "  We propose three models for the traffic of vehicles within a network formed\nby sites (cities, car-rental agencies, parking lots, etc.) and connected by\ntwo-way arteries (roads, highways), that allow forecasting the vehicular flux\nin a sequence of $n$ consecutive steps, or units of time. An essential approach\nconsists in using, as an \"a priori\" information, previous observations and\nmeasurements. The formal tools used in our analysis consists in: (1)\nassociating a digraph to the network where the edges correspond to arteries and\nthe vertices with loops represent the sites. (2) From an initial set of\nnumbers, that are the distribution of vehicles within the network, we construct\na matrix that we transform into a stochastic matrix (SM) by normalizing the\nrows, whose entries are now transition probabilities. This matrix becomes the\ngenerator of the evolution of the traffic flow. And (3), we use the\nPerron-Frobenius theory for a formal analysis. We investigate three models: (a)\na closed four-site network having a conserved number of vehicles; (b) to this\nnetwork we add an influx and an outflux of vehicles to characterize an open\nsystem; asymptotically, $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the SM raised to the power $n$\ngoes to a unique stationary matrix. And (c), we construct a nonlinear model\nbecause the formal structure permits the existence of several ($L$) stationary\nstates for the distribution of vehicles at each site, that alternate cyclically\nwith time. Each state represents the traffic for $L$ different moments. These\nmodels were used to analyze the traffic in a sector of the city of Tigre,\nlocated in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results are presented\nin a following paper.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the quantum criticality and Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid (TLL) behavior within one-dimensional (1D) ultracold atomic gases. Based\non the measured density profiles at different temperatures, the universal\nscaling laws of thermodynamic quantities are observed. The quantum critical\nregime and the relevant crossover temperatures are determined through the\ndouble-peak structure of the specific heat. In the TLL regime, we obtain the\nLuttinger parameter by probing sound propagation. Furthermore, a characteristic\npower-law behavior emerges in the measured momentum distributions of the 1D\nultracold gas, confirming the existence of the TLL.\n", "  Translational and rotational swimming at small Reynolds number of a planar\nassembly of identical spheres immersed in an incompressible viscous fluid is\nstudied on the basis of a set of equations of motion for the individual\nspheres. The motion of the spheres is caused by actuating forces and forces\nderived from a direct interaction potential, as well as hydrodynamic forces\nexerted by the fluid as frictional and added mass hydrodynamic interactions.\nThe translational and rotational swimming velocities of the assembly are\ndeduced from momentum and angular momentum balance equations. The mean power\nrequired during a period is calculated from an instantaneous power equation.\nExpressions are derived for the mean swimming velocities and the power, valid\nto second order in the amplitude of displacements from the relative equilibrium\npositions. Hence these quantities can be evaluated for prescribed periodic\ndisplacements. Explicit calculations are performed for three spheres\ninteracting such that they form an equilateral triangle in the rest\nconfiguration.\n", "  Nematic elastomers and glasses deform spontaneously when subjected to\ntemperature changes. This property can be exploited in the design of\nheterogeneously patterned thin sheets that deform into a non-trivial shape when\nheated or cooled. In this paper, we start from a variational formulation for\nthe entropic elastic energy of liquid crystal elastomers and we derive an\neffective two-dimensional metric constraint, which links the deformation and\nthe heterogeneous director field. Our main results show that satisfying the\nmetric constraint is both necessary and sufficient for the deformation to be an\napproximate minimizer of the energy. We include several examples which show\nthat the class of deformations satisfying the metric constraint is quite rich.\n", "  We explore the connection between the process of relaxation in the BMN matrix\nmodel and the physics of black holes in AdS/CFT. Focusing on Dyson-fluid\nsolutions of the matrix model, we perform numerical simulations of the real\ntime dynamics of the system. By quenching the equilibrium distribution we study\nthe quasi-normal oscillations of scalar single trace observables, we isolate\nthe lowest quasi-normal mode, and we determine its frequencies as function of\nthe energy. Considering the BMN matrix model as a truncation of $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSYM, we also compute the frequencies of the quasi-normal modes of the dual\nscalar fields in the AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild background. We compare the results,\nand we find a surprising similarity.\n", "  We study D3-brane theories that are dually described as deformations of two\ndifferent $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal theories with massless monopoles and\ndyons. These arise at the self-intersection of a seven-brane in F-theory, which\ncuts out a link on a small three-sphere surrounding the self-intersection. The\nspectrum is studied by taking small loops in the three-sphere, yielding a\nlink-induced monodromy action on string junction D3-brane states, and\nsubsequently quotienting by the monodromy. This reduces the differing flavor\nalgebras of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories to the same flavor algebra, as\nrequired by duality, and projects out charged states, yielding an\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal theory on the D3-brane. In one, a deformation of\na rank one Argyres-Douglas theory retains its $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry and\nexhibits a charge neutral flavor triplet that is comprised of electron, dyon,\nand monopole string junctions. From duality we argue that the monodromy\nprojection should also be imposed away from the conformal point, in which case\nthe D3-brane field theory appears to exhibit confinement of electrons, dyons,\nand monopoles. We will address the mathematical counterparts in a companion\npaper.\n", "  The super-sensitivity attained in quantum phase estimation is known to be\ncompromised in the presence of decoherence. This is particularly patent at\nblind spots -- phase values at which sensitivity is totally lost. One remedy is\nto use a precisely known reference phase to shift the operation point of the\nsensor to a less vulnerable phase value. We present here an alternative\napproach based on combining the probe with an ancillary degree of freedom\ncontaining adjustable parameters to create an entangled quantum state of higher\ndimension. We validate this concept by simulating a configuration of a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer with a two-photon probe and a polarization ancilla\nof adjustable parameters, entangled at a polarizing beam splitter. At the\ninterferometer output, the photons are measured after an adjustable unitary\ntransformation in the polarization subspace. Through calculation of the Fisher\ninformation and simulation of an adaptive estimation procedure, we show that\noptimizing the adjustable polarization parameters using an adaptive measurement\nprocess provides globally super-sensitive unbiased phase estimates for a range\nof decoherence levels, without prior information or a reference phase.\n", "  We show that, when considering the scaling factor as an affine variable, the\ncoefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the spectral action on a\n(Euclidean) Robertson-Walker spacetime are periods of mixed Tate motives,\ninvolving relative motives of complements of unions of hyperplanes and quadric\nhypersurfaces and divisors given by unions of coordinate hyperplanes.\n", "  The formation of bosonic bound states underlies the formation of a superfluid\nground state in the many-body phase diagram of ultracold Fermi gases. We study\nbound-state formation in a spin- and mass-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas\nconfined in a box with hard-wall boundary conditions. Because of the presence\nof finite Fermi spheres, the center-of-mass momentum of the potentially formed\nbound states can be finite, depending on the parameters controlling mass and\nspin imbalance as well as the coupling strength. We exploit this observation to\nestimate the potential location of inhomogeneous phases in the many-body phase\ndiagram as a function of spin- and mass imbalance as well as the box size. Our\nresults suggest that a hard-wall box does not alter substantially the many-body\nphase diagram calculated in the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, such a box may\nserve as an ideal trap potential to bring experiment and theory closely\ntogether and facilitate the search for exotic inhomogeneous ground states.\n", "  We calculate the dispersion of spinor exciton-polaritons in a planar\nmicrocavity with its active region containing a single Transitional Metal\nDichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer, taking into account excitonic and photonic\nspin-orbit coupling. We consider the radial propagation of polaritons in\npresence of disorder. We show that the reduction of the disorder scattering\ninduced by the formation of polariton states allows to observe an optical\nValley Hall effect, namely the coherent precession of the locked valley and\npolarization pseudospins leading to the formation of spatial valley-polarized\ndomains.\n", "  We explore the question of which shape a manifold is compelled to take when\nimmersed in another one, provided it must be the extremum of some functional.\nWe consider a family of functionals which depend quadratically on the extrinsic\ncurvatures and on projections of the ambient curvatures. These functionals\ncapture a number of physical setups ranging from holography to the study of\nmembranes and elastica. We present a detailed derivation of the equations of\nmotion, known as the shape equations, placing particular emphasis on the issue\nof gauge freedom in the choice of normal frame. We apply these equations to the\nparticular case of holographic entanglement entropy for higher curvature three\ndimensional gravity and find new classes of entangling curves. In particular,\nwe discuss the case of New Massive Gravity where we show that non-geodesic\nentangling curves have always a smaller on-shell value of the entropy\nfunctional. Then we apply this formalism to the computation of the entanglement\nentropy for dual logarithmic CFTs. Nevertheless, the correct value for the\nentanglement entropy is provided by geodesics. Then, we discuss the importance\nof these equations in the context of classical elastica and comment on terms\nthat break gauge invariance.\n", "  Using the highly sensitive anomalous Hall effect (AHE) we have been able to\nmeasure the reversal of a single magnetic island, of diameter 220nm, in an\narray consisting of more than 80 of those islands. By repeatedly traversing the\nhysteresis loop, we measured the thermally actuated fluctuation of the\nswitching field of the islands at the lower and higher ends of the switching\nfield distribution. Based on a novel easy-to-use model, we determined the\nswitching field in the absence of thermal activation, and the energy barrier in\nthe absence of an external field from these fluctuations. By measuring the\nreversal of individual dots in the array as a function of temperature, we\nextrapolated the switching field and energy barrier down to 0K. The\nextrapolated values are not identical to those obtained from the fluctation of\nthe switching field at room temperature, because the properties of the magnetic\nmaterial are temperature dependent. As a result, extrapolating from temperature\ndependent measurements overestimates the energy barrier by more than a factor\nof two. To determine fundamental parameters of the energy barrier between\nmagnetisation states, measuring the fluctuation of the reversal field at the\ntemperature of application is therefore to be preferred. This is of primary\nimportance to applications in data storagea and magnetic logic. For instance in\nfast switching, where the switching field in the absence of thermal activation\nplays a major role, or in long term data stability, which is determined by the\nenergy barrier in the absence of an external field.\n", "  In this paper, we treat quantum walks in a two-dimensional lattice with\ncutting edges along a straight boundary introduced by Asboth and Edge (2015\nPhys.Rev. A 91 022324) in order to study one-dimensional edge states\noriginating from topological phases of matter and to obtain collateral evidence\nof how a quantum walker reacts to the boundary. Firstly, we connect this model\nto the CMV matrix, which provides a 5-term recursion relation of the Laurent\npolynomial associated with spectral measure on the unit circle. Secondly,we\nexplicitly derive the spectra of bulk and edge states of the quantum walk with\nthe boundary using spectral analysis of the CMV matrix. Thirdly, while\ntopological numbers of the model studied so far are well-defined only when gaps\nin the bulk spectrum exist, we find a new topological number defined only when\nthere are no gaps in the bulk spectrum. We confirm that the existence of the\nspectrum for edge states derived from the CMV matrix is consistent with the\nprediction from a bulk-edge correspondence using topological numbers calculated\nin the cases where gaps in the bulk spectrum do or do not exist. Finally, we\nshow how the edge states contribute to the asymptotic behavior of the quantum\nwalk through limit theorems of the finding probability. Conversely, we also\npropose a differential equation using this limit distribution whose solution is\nthe underlying edge state.\n", "  Narrow-band intensity-difference squeezing beams have important applications\nin quantum metrology and gravitational wave detection. The best way to generate\nnarrow-band intensity-difference squeezing is to employ\nparametrically-amplified four-wave mixing process in high-gain atomic media.\nSuch IDS can be further enhanced by cascading multiple parametrically-amplified\nfour-wave mixing processes in separate atomic media. The complicated\nexperimental setup, added losses and required high-power pump laser with the\nincrease of number of stages can limit the wide uses of such scheme in\npractical applications. Here, we show that by modulating the internal energy\nlevel(s) with additional laser(s), the degree of original intensity-difference\nsqueezing can be substantially increased. With an initial intensity-difference\nsqueezing of $-8.5\\pm0.4$ dB using parametrically-amplified-non-degenerate\nfour-wave mixing process in a three-level $\\Lambda$-type configuration, the\ndegree of intensity-difference squeezing can be enhanced to $-11.9\\pm0.4$\ndB/$-13.9\\pm0.4$ dB (corrected for losses) when we use one/two laser beam(s) to\nmodulate the involved ground/excited state(s). More importantly, a maximal\nnoise reduction of $-9.7\\pm0.4$ dB (only corrected for electronic noise) is\nobserved below the standard quantum limit, which is the strongest reported to\ndate in phase insensitive amplification in four-wave mixing. Applying the model\nto quantum metrology, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 23 dB compared\nto the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the same phase-sensing\nintensity, which is a 14-fold enhancement in rms phase measurement sensitivity\nbeyond the shot noise limit. Our results show a low-loss, robust and efficient\nway to produce high degree of IDS and facilitate its potential applications.\n", "  The recent reports of the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in\nphotonic experiments [1-5] boosted the understanding of the role of disorder in\nmultimode lasers, as well as helped to settle enlightening connections [6-13]\nwith the statistical physics of complex systems. RSB manifests when\nidentically-prepared system replicas reach distinct states, yielding different\nmeasures of observable quantities [14]. Here we demonstrate the RSB in the\nspontaneous mode-locking regime of a conventional multimode Nd:YAG laser in a\nclosed cavity. The underlying mechanism is quite distinct from that of the RSB\nspinglass phase in cavityless random lasers with incoherently-oscillating\nmodes. Here, a specific nonuniform distribution of the gain takes place in each\npulse, and frustration is induced since the coherent oscillation of a given\nsubset of longitudinal modes dominates and simultaneously inhibits the others.\nNevertheless, when high losses are introduced only the replica-symmetric\namplified stimulation emission is observed. We therefore suggest that the RSB\ntransition can be used as an identifier of the threshold in standard multimode\nlasers, as recently proposed and demonstrated for random lasers [1,2].\n", "  We consider Supersymmetric (SUSY) and non-SUSY models of chaotic inflation\nbased on the phi^n potential with n=2 or 4. We show that the coexistence of an\nexponential nonminimal coupling to gravity, fR=Exp(cR phi^p), with a kinetic\nmixing of the form fK=cK fR^m can accommodate inflationary observables favored\nby the Planck and Bicep2/Keck Array results for p=1 and 2, 1<=m<=15 and\n2.6x10^(-3)<=rRK=cR/cK^(p/2)<=1, where the upper limit is not imposed for p=1.\nInflation is of hilltop type and it can be attained for subplanckian inflaton\nvalues with the corresponding effective theories retaining the perturbative\nunitarity up to the Planck scale. The supergravity embedding of these models is\nachieved employing two chiral gauge singlet supefields, a monomial\nsuperpotential and several (semi)logarithmic or semipolynomial Kaehler\npotentials.\n", "  We use the final data from the VIPERS redshift survey to extract an\nunparalleled sample of more than 2000 massive M > 10^11 M_sun passive galaxies\n(MPGs) at redshift 0.5 < z < 1.0, based on their NUVrK colours. This enables us\nto investigate how the population of these objects was built up over cosmic\ntime. We find that the evolution of the number density depends on the galaxy\nmean surface stellar mass density, Sigma. In particular, dense (Sigma > 2000\nM_sun pc^-2) MPGs show a constant comoving number density over this redshift\nrange, whilst this increases by a factor ~ 4 for the least dense objects,\ndefined as having Sigma < 1000 M_sun pc^-2. We estimate stellar ages for the\nMPG population both fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and through\nthe D4000_n index, obtaining results in good agreement. Our findings are\nconsistent with passive ageing of the stellar content of dense MPGs. We show\nthat at any redshift the less dense MPGs are younger than dense ones and that\ntheir stellar populations evolve at a slower rate than predicted by passive\nevolution. This points to a scenario in which the overall population of MPGs\nwas built up over the cosmic time by continuous addition of less dense\ngalaxies: on top of an initial population of dense objects that passively\nevolves, new, larger, and younger MPGs continuously join the population at\nlater epochs. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed increase in the number\ndensity of MPGs is totally accounted for by the observed decrease in the number\ndensity of correspondingly massive star forming galaxies (i.e. all the\nnon-passive M > 10^11 M_sun objects). Such systems observed at z ~ 1 in VIPERS,\ntherefore, represent the most plausible progenitors of the subsequent emerging\nclass of larger MPGs.\n", "  We examine a renormalizable SUSY SO(10) model without fine-tuning. We show\nhow to construct MSSM doublets and to predict proton decay. We find that in the\nminimal set of Yukawa couplings the model is consistent with the experiments,\nwhile including $120_H$ to fit the data there are inconsistencies.\n", "  A recent paper by Zaghoo et al. presents optical data at high-pressure and\nhigh-temperature and interprets the data as evidence for a first-order phase\ntransition to metallic hydrogen during heating. Here we argue that the\npresented data are contradictory with these claims. Elucidating this issue is\nimportant for building a coherent picture that is emerging as the results of\ntheoretical calculations of various levels and experimental investigations\nemploying static and dynamic compression techniques. In this context, the use\nof adequate probes of the electronic and chemical state is crucial. Optical\nprobes that do not address the energy dependent conductivity while making\nmultiple references to the Drude model are highly speculative. Indeed, the\navailable dynamic and static compression data and theoretical modeling show\nthat study of energy dependent conductivity is important for understanding the\nnature of hot dense hydrogen. Moreover, the most recent investigations suggest\nthat the critical point, which demarcates the regimes of crossover between\ninsulating and plasma state at low densities to the first order liquid-liquid\ntransition, is above 200 GPa. Below we concentrate on inconsistencies in the\ninterpretation of data in Zaghoo et al, which call for careful examination of\ntheir claims and further detailed investigations. We analyze their optical data\nand use finite element calculations and argue that the high-temperature state\nstudied in Zaghoo et al. is not metallic and that the data cannot discriminate\nbetween a first-order phase transition and a continuous phase transition, or\neven a bandgap drop within one phase\n", "  The purpose of this short note is to give a variation on the classical\nDonsker-Varadhan inequality, which bounds the first eigenvalue of a\nsecond-order elliptic operator on a bounded domain $\\Omega$ by the largest mean\nfirst exit time of the associated drift-diffusion process via $$\\lambda_1 \\geq\n\\frac{1}{\\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\mathbb{E}_x \\tau_{\\Omega^c}}.$$ Instead of\nlooking at the mean of the first exit time, we study quantiles: let $d_{p,\n\\partial \\Omega}:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ be the smallest time\n$t$ such that the likelihood of exiting within that time is $p$, then\n$$\\lambda_1 \\geq \\frac{\\log{(1/p)}}{\\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} d_{p,\\partial\n\\Omega}(x)}.$$ Moreover, as $p \\rightarrow 0$, this lower bound converges to\n$\\lambda_1$.\n", "  A new formalism is introduced to treat problems in quantum field theory,\nusing coherent functional expansions rather than path integrals. The basic\nresults and identities of this approach are developed. In the case of a Bose\ngas with point-contact interactions, this leads to a soluble functional\nequation in the weak interaction limit, where the perturbing term is part of\nthe kinetic energy. This approach has the potential to prevent the Dyson\nproblem of divergence in perturbation theory.\n", "  We present the latest developments to the CheckMATE program that allows\nmodels of new physics to be easily tested against the recent LHC data. To\nachieve this goal, the core of CheckMATE now contains over 60 LHC analyses of\nwhich 12 are from the 13 TeV run. The main new feature is that CheckMATE 2 now\nintegrates the Monte Carlo event generation via Madgraph and Pythia 8. This\nallows users to go directly from a SLHA file or UFO model to the result of\nwhether a model is allowed or not. In addition, the integration of the event\ngeneration leads to a significant increase in the speed of the program. Many\nother improvements have also been made, including the possibility to now\ncombine signal regions to give a total likelihood for a model.\n", "  We develop two algorithms, based on maximum likelihood (ML) inference, for\nestimating the parameters of polarized radio sources which emit at a single\nrotation measure (RM), e.g., pulsars. These algorithms incorporate the flux\ndensity spectrum of the source, either a power law or a scaled version of the\nStokes I spectrum, and a variation in sensitivity across the observing band. We\nquantify the detection significance and measurement uncertainties in the fitted\nparameters, and we derive weighted versions of the RM synthesis algorithm\nwhich, under certain conditions, maximize the likelihood. We use Monte Carlo\nsimulations to compare injected and recovered source parameters for a range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios, investigate the quality of standard methods for\nestimating measurement uncertainties, and search for statistical biases. These\nsimulations consider one frequency band each for the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and the Low Frequency\nArray (LOFAR). We find that results obtained for one frequency band cannot be\neasily generalized, and that methods which were developed in the past for\ncorrecting bias in individual frequency channels do not apply to wide-band data\nsets. The standard method for estimating the measurement uncertainty in RM is\nnot accurate for sources with non-zero spectral indices. Furthermore, dividing\nStokes Q and U by Stokes I to correct for spectral index effects, in\ncombination with RM synthesis, does not maximize the likelihood.\n", "  The propagation characteristics and interactions between the dust acoustic\n(DA) one and multi solitons in an unmagnetized dusty plasmas composing\nnegatively charged mobile dust, Boltzmann distributed electrons, nonextensive\ndistributed cold and nonthermal distributed hot ions are studied. The well\nknown extended Poincar Lighthill Kuo (PLK) method is employed to derive the two\nsided Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equations. The solutions of KdV equations are\nconstructed using the Hirota method both for one and multi solitons. The phase\nshifts are determined for the interaction of one, two and three DA solitons.\nThe effects of plasma parameters on the head on collision of DA one as well as\nmulti solitons and their corresponding phase shifts are investigated.\n", "  We consider finite collections of $N$ non-intersecting Brownian paths on the\nline and on the half-line with both absorbing and reflecting boundary\nconditions (corresponding to Brownian excursions and reflected Brownian\nmotions) and compute in each case the joint distribution of the maximal height\nof the top path and the location at which this maximum is attained. The\nresulting formulas are analogous to the ones obtained in [MFQR13] for the joint\ndistribution of $\\mathcal{M}={\\rm\nmax}_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\{\\mathcal{A}_2(x)-x^2\\}$ and $\\mathcal{T}={\\rm\nargmax}_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\{\\mathcal{A}_2(x)-x^2\\}$, where $\\mathcal{A}_2$ is the\nAiry$_2$ process, and we use them to show that in the three cases the joint\ndistribution converges, as $N\\to\\infty$, to the joint distribution of\n$\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$. In the case of non-intersecting Brownian\nbridges on the line, we also establish small deviation inequalities for the\nargmax which match the tail behavior of $\\mathcal{T}$. Our proofs are based on\nthe method introduced in [CQR13,BCR15] for obtaining formulas for the\nprobability that the top line of these line ensembles stays below a given\ncurve, which are given in terms of the Fredholm determinant of certain\n\"path-integral\" kernels.\n", "  We update the search for features in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\npower spectrum due to transient reductions in the speed of sound, using Planck\n2015 CMB temperature and polarisation data. We enlarge the parameter space to\nmuch higher oscillatory frequencies of the feature, and define a robust prior\nindependent of the ansatz for the reduction, guaranteed to reproduce the\nassumptions of the theoretical model and exhaustive in the regime in which the\nfeature is easily distinguishable from the baseline cosmology. We find a fit to\nthe $\\ell\\approx20$--$40$ minus/plus structure in Planck TT power spectrum, as\nwell as features spanning along the higher $\\ell$'s ($\\ell\\approx100$--$1500$).\nFor the last ones, we compute the correlated features that we expect to find in\nthe CMB bispectrum, and asses their signal-to-noise and correlation to the\nISW-lensing secondary bispectrum. We compare our findings to the shape-agnostic\noscillatory template tested in Planck 2015, and we comment on some tantalising\ncoincidences with some of the traits described in Planck's 2015 bispectrum\ndata.\n", "  We study the effect of non-standard interactions (NSIs) on the propagation of\nneutrinos through the Earth matter and how it affects the hierarchy sensitivity\nof the DUNE experiment. We emphasize on the special case when the diagonal NSI\nparameter $\\epsilon_{ee} = -1$, nullifying the standard matter effect. We show\nthat, if in addition, CP violation is maximal then this gives rise to an exact\nintrinsic hierarchy degeneracy in the appearance channel, irrespective of the\nbaseline and energy. Introduction of off-diagonal NSI parameter, $\\epsilon_{e\n\\tau}$, shifts the position of this degeneracy to a different $\\epsilon_{ee}$.\nMoreover the unknown magnitude and phases of the off-diagonal NSI parameters\ncan give rise to additional degeneracies. Overall, given the current model\nindependent limits on NSI parameters, the hierarchy sensitivity of DUNE can get\nseriously impacted. However, a more precise knowledge on the NSI parameters,\nspecially $\\epsilon_{ee}$, can give rise to an improved sensitivity.\nAlternatively, if NSI exists in nature, and still DUNE shows hierarchy\nsensitivity, certain ranges of the NSI parameters can be excluded.\nAdditionally, we briefly discussed the implications of $\\epsilon_{ee} = -1$ (in\nthe Earth) on MSW effect in the Sun.\n", "  When a physical system is subjected to a strong external multi-frequency\ndrive, its dynamics can be conveniently represented in the multi-dimensional\nFloquet lattice. The number of the Floquet lattice dimensions equals the number\nof {\\em irrationally}-related drive frequencies, and the evolution occurs in\nresponse to a built-in effective \"electric\" field, whose components are\nproportional to the corresponding drive frequencies. The mapping allows to\nengineer and study temporal analogs of many real-space phenomena. Here we focus\non the specific example of a two-level system under two-frequency drive that\ninduces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2D Floquet space. The\nobservable consequence of such construction is quantized pumping of energy\nbetween the sources with frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. When the system\nis initialized into a Floquet band with the Chern number $C$, the pumping\noccurs at the rate $P_{12} = -P_{21}= (C/2\\pi)\\hbar \\omega_1\\omega_2$, an exact\ncounterpart of the transverse current in a conventional topological insulator.\n", "  Brown dwarf spectra are rich in information revealing of the chemical and\nphysical processes operating in their atmospheres. We apply a recently\ndeveloped atmospheric retrieval tool to an ensemble of late T-dwarf (600-800K)\nnear infrared spectra. With these spectra we are able to place direct\nconstraints the molecular abundances of H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$,\nH$_2$S, and Na+K, gravity, thermal structure (and effective temperature),\nphotometric radius, and cloud optical depths. We find that ammonia, water,\nmethane, and the alkali metals are present and well constrained in all 11\nobjects. From the abundance constraints we find no significant trend in the\nwater, methane, or ammonia abundances with temperature, but find a very strong\n($>$25$\\sigma$) increasing trend in the alkali metal abundances with effective\ntemperature, indicative of alkali rainout. We also find little evidence for\noptically thick clouds. With the methane and water abundances, we derive the\nintrinsic atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratios. We find in our\nsample, that metallicities are typically sub solar and carbon-to-oxygen ratios\nare somewhat super solar, different than expectations from the local stellar\npopulation. We also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are\nconsistent with radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions. Finally,\nwe find that our retrieved effective temperatures are lower than previous\ninferences for some objects and that our radii are larger than expectations\nfrom evolutionary models, possibly indicative of un-resolved binaries. This\ninvestigation and methodology represents a paradigm in linking spectra to the\ndetermination of the fundamental chemical and physical processes governing cool\nbrown dwarf atmospheres.\n", "  The relativistic analysis of stochastic kinematics is developed in order to\ndetermine the transformation of the effective diffusivity tensor in inertial\nframes. Poisson-Kac stochastic processes are initially considered. For\none-dimensional spatial models, the effective diffusion coefficient $D$\nmeasured in a frame $\\Sigma$ moving with velocity $w$ with respect to the rest\nframe of the stochastic process can be expressed as $D= D_0 \\, \\gamma^{-3}(w)$.\nSubsequently, higher dimensional processes are analyzed, and it is shown that\nthe diffusivity tensor in a moving frame becomes non-isotropic with\n$D_\\parallel = D_0 \\, \\gamma^{-3}(w)$, and $D_\\perp = D_0 \\, \\gamma^{-1}(w)$,\nwhere $D_\\parallel$ and $D_\\perp$ are the diffusivities parallel and orthogonal\nto the velocity of the moving frame. The analysis of discrete Space-Time\nDiffusion processes permits to obtain a general transformation theory of the\ntensor diffusivity, confirmed by several different simulation experiments.\nSeveral implications of the theory are also addressed and discussed.\n", "  The structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of\nNdFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$ have been studied in detail using bulk\nmagnetization, neutron/x-ray diffraction and first principles density\nfunctional theory calculations. The material crystallizes in the orthorhombic\n$Pbnm$ structure, where both Mn and Fe occupy the same crystallographic site\n($4b$).\n  Mn/Fe sublattice of the compound orders in to a G-type antiferromagnetic\nphase close to 250\\,K where the magnetic structure belongs to ${\\Gamma}_{1}$\nirreducible representation with spins aligned along the crystallographic $b$\ndirection. This is unconventional in the sense that most of the orthoferrites\nand orthochromites order in the ${\\Gamma}_{4}$ representation below the\nN\\'{e}el temperature.This magnetic structure then undergoes a complete spin\nreorientation transition with temperature in the range 75\\,K$\\gtrsim$ T\n$\\gtrsim$ 25\\,K where the magnetic structure exists as a sum of two irreducible\nrepresentations (${\\Gamma}_{1}$+${\\Gamma}_{2}$) as seen from neutron\ndiffraction measurements. At 6\\,K, the magnetic structure belongs entirely to\n${\\Gamma}_{2}$ representation with spins aligned antiferromagnetically along\nthe crystallographic $c$ direction having a small ferromagnetic component\n($F_x$). The unusual spin reorientation and correlation between magnetic ground\nstate and electronic structure have been investigated using first principles\ncalculations within GGA+U and GGA+U+SO formalisms.\n", "  From the overlap lattice quark propagator calculated in the Landau gauge, we\ndetermine the quark chiral condensate by fitting operator product expansion\nformulas to the lattice data. The quark propagators are computed on domain wall\nfermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations with $N_f=2+1$\nflavors. Three ensembles with different light sea quark masses are used at one\nlattice spacing $1/a=1.75(4)$ GeV. We obtain\n$\\langle\\bar\\psi\\psi\\rangle^{\\overline{\\rm MS}}(2\\mbox{\nGeV})=(-305(15)(21)\\mbox{ MeV})^3$ in the SU(2) chiral limit.\n", "  We show that the fermionic and bosonic spectrum of $d=2$ fermions at finite\ndensity coupled to a critical boson can be determined non-perturbatively in the\ncombined limit $k_F\\rightarrow {\\infty}$, $N_f \\rightarrow 0$ with $N_fk_F$\nfixed. In this double scaling limit, the boson two-point function is corrected,\nbut only at one-loop. This double scaling limit therefore incorporates the\nleading effect of Landau damping. The fermion two-point function is determined\nanalytically in real space and numerically in (Euclidean) momentum space. The\nresulting spectrum is discontinuously connected to the quenched $N_f\\rightarrow\n0$ result. For $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$ with $k$ fixed the spectrum exhibits the\ndistinct non-Fermi-liquid behavior previously surmised from the RPA\napproximation. However, the exact answer obtained here shows that the RPA\nresult does not fully capture the IR of the theory.\n", "  As an intermediate state in the topological phase diagram, Dirac semimetals\nare of particular interest as a platform for studying topological phase\ntransitions under external modulations. Despite a growing theoretical interest\nin this topic, it remains a substantial challenge to experimentally tune the\nsystem across topological phase transitions. Here, we investigate the Fermi\nsurface evolution of Cd3As2 under high pressure through magnetotransport. A\nsudden change in Berry phase occurs at 1.3 GPa along with the unanticipated\nshrinkage of the Fermi surface, which occurs well below the structure\ntransition point (~2.5 GPa). High pressure X-ray diffraction also reveals an\nanisotropic compression of the Cd3As2 lattice around a similar pressure.\nCorroborated by the first-principles calculations we show that an axial\ncompression will shift the Dirac nodes towards the Brillouin zone center and\neventually introduces a finite energy gap. The ability to tune the node\nposition, a vital parameter of Dirac semimetals, can have dramatic impacts on\nthe corresponding topological properties such as the Fermi arc surface states\nand the chiral anomaly. Our study demonstrates axial compression as an\nefficient approach for manipulating the band topology and exploring the\ncritical phenomena near the topological phase transition in Cd3As2.\n", "  NORMA is a design for a normal-conducting race track fixed-field\nalternating-gradient accelerator (FFAG) for protons from 50 to 350 MeV. In this\narticle we show the development from an idealised lattice to a design\nimplemented with field maps from rigorous two-dimensional (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) FEM magnet modelling. We show that whilst the fields\nfrom a 2D model may reproduce the idealised field to a close approximation,\nadjustments must be made to the lattice to account for differences brought\nabout by the 3D model and fringe fields and full 3D models. Implementing these\nlattice corrections we recover the required properties of small tune shift with\nenergy and a sufficiently-large dynamic aperture. The main result is an\niterative design method to produce the first realistic design for a proton\ntherapy accelerator that can rapidly deliver protons for both treatment and for\nimaging at up to 350 MeV. The first iteration is performed explicitly and\ndescribed in detail in the text.\n", "  We propose a novel dark matter (DM) detection strategy for the models with\nnon-minimal dark sector. The main ingredients in the underlying DM scenario are\na boosted DM particle and a heavier dark sector state. The relativistic DM\nimpinged on target material scatters off inelastically to the heavier state\nwhich subsequently decays into DM along with lighter states including visible\n(Standard Model) particles. The expected signal event, therefore, accompanies a\nvisible signature by the secondary cascade process associated with a recoiling\nof the target particle, differing from the typical neutrino signal not\ninvolving the secondary signature. We then discuss various kinematic features\nfollowed by DM detection prospects at large volume neutrino detectors with a\nmodel framework where a dark gauge boson is the mediator between the Standard\nModel particles and DM.\n", "  We explore a two component dark matter model with a fermion and a scalar. In\nthis scenario the Standard Model (SM) is extended by a fermion, a scalar and an\nadditional pseudo scalar. The fermionic component is assumed to have a global\n${\\rm U(1)}_{\\rm DM}$ and interacts with the pseudo scalar via Yukawa\ninteraction while a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed on the other component\n-- the scalar. These ensure the stability of both the dark matter components.\nAlthough the Lagrangian of the present model is CP conserving, however the CP\nsymmetry breaks spontaneously when the pseudo scalar acquires a vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV). The scalar component of the dark matter in the present\nmodel also develops a VEV on spontaneous breaking of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry. Thus the various interactions of the dark sector and the SM sector\nare progressed through the mixing of the SM like Higgs boson, the pseudo scalar\nHiggs like boson and the singlet scalar boson. We show that the observed gamma\nray excess from the Galactic Centre, self-interaction of dark matter from\ncolliding clusters as well as the 3.55 keV X-ray line from Perseus, Andromeda\netc. can be simultaneously explained in the present two component dark matter\nmodel.\n", "  A continuous approximation framework for non-linear stochastic as well as\ndeterministic discrete maps is developed. For the stochastic map with\nuncorelated Gaussian noise, by successively applying the It\\^o lemma, we obtain\na Langevin type of equation. Specifically, we show how non-linear maps give\nrise to a Langevin description that involves multiplicative noise. The\nmultiplicative nature of the noise induces an additional effective force, not\npresent in the absence of noise. We further exploit the continuum description\nand provide an explicit formula for the stable distribution of the stochastic\nmap and conditions for its existence. Our results are in good agreement with\nnumerical simulations of several maps.\n", "  We classify and explicitly describe homomorphisms of Verma modules for\nconformal Galilei algebras $\\mathfrak{cga}_\\ell(d,{\\mathbb C})$ with $d=1$ for\nany integer value $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The homomorphisms are uniquely\ndetermined by singular vectors as solutions of certain differential operators\nof flag type, and identified with specific polynomials arising as coefficients\nin the expansion of a parametric family of symmetric polynomials into power sum\nsymmetric polynomials.\n", "  Crack nucleation is a ubiquitous phenomena during materials failure, because\nstress focuses on crack tips. It is known that exceptions to this general rule\narise in the limit of strong disorder or vanishing mechanical stability, where\nstress distributes over a divergent length scale and the material displays\ndiffusive damage. Here we show, using simulations, that a class of diluted\nlattices displays a new critical phase when they are below isostaticity, where\nstress never concentrates, damage always occurs over a divergent length scale,\nand catastrophic failure is avoided.\n", "  We propose that ultracold alkaline-earth-like atoms confined in\none-dimensional optical lattice can realize a Kondo lattice model which hosts a\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase and an associated quantum phase\ntransition in a controllable manner. The symmetry protection of the phase\ntransition is discussed from two different viewpoints: topological properties\nrelated to spatial patterns of Kondo singlets, and symmetry eigenvalues of the\nspin states. We uncover the role of various symmetries in the phase diagram of\nthis system by combining a weak-coupling approach by Abelian bosonization and\nstrong-coupling pictures of ground states. Furthermore, we show that the\nbosonization approach correctly describes a crossover from a fermionic SPT\nphase to a bosonic SPT phase and an associated change of protecting symmetries\nas the charge degrees of freedom are frozen by the Hubbard repulsion.\n", "  This paper presents three different constitutive approaches to model thin\nrotation-free shells based on the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis. One approach is\nbased on numerical integration through the shell thickness while the other two\napproaches do not need any numerical integration and so they are\ncomputationally more efficient. The formulation is designed for large\ndeformations and allows for geometrical and material nonlinearities, which\nmakes it very suitable for the modeling of soft tissues. Furthermore, six\ndifferent isotropic and anisotropic material models, which are commonly used to\nmodel soft biological materials, are examined for the three proposed\nconstitutive approaches. Following an isogeometric approach, NURBS-based finite\nelements are used for the discretization of the shell surface. Several\nnumerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the capabilities of the\nformulation. Those include the contact simulation during balloon angioplasty.\n", "  We find new universal factorization identities for generalized Macdonald\npolynomials on the topological locus. We prove the identities (which include\nall previously known forumlas of this kind) using factorization identities for\nmatrix model averages, which are themselves consequences of Ding-Iohara-Miki\nconstraints. Factorized expressions for generalized Macdonald polynomials are\nidentified with refined topological string amplitudes containing a toric brane\non an intermediate preferred leg, surface operators in gauge theory and certain\ndegenerate CFT vertex operators.\n", "  We introduce a new geometric object, the correlahedron, which we conjecture\nto be equivalent to stress-energy correlators in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills.\nRe-expressing the Grassmann dependence of correlation functions of n chiral\nstress-energy multiplets with Grassmann degree 4k in terms of 4(n+k)-linear\nbosonic variables, the resulting expressions have an interpretation as volume\nforms on a Gr(n+k,4+n+k) Grassmannian, analogous to the expressions for planar\namplitudes via the amplituhedron. The resulting volume forms are to be\nnaturally associated with the correlahedron geometry. We construct such\nexpressions in this bosonised space both directly, in general, from Feynman\ndiagrams in twistor space, and then more invariantly from specific known\ncorrelator expressions in analytic superspace. We give a geometric\ninterpretation of the action of the consecutive lightlike limit and show that\nunder this the correlahedron reduces to the squared amplituhedron both as a\ngeometric object as well as directly on the corresponding volume forms. We give\nan explicit easily implementable algorithm via cylindrical decompositions for\nextracting the squared amplituhedron volume form from the squared amplituhedron\ngeometry with explicit examples and discuss the analogous procedure for the\ncorrelators.\n", "  The dispersal of cells from an initially constrained location is a crucial\naspect of many physiological phenomena ranging from morphogenesis to tumour\nspreading. In such processes, the way cell-cell interactions impact the motion\nof single cells, and in turn the collective dynamics, remains unclear. Here,\nthe spreading of micro-patterned colonies of non-cohesive cells is fully\ncharacterized from the complete set of individual trajectories. It shows that\ncontact interactions, chemically mediated interactions and cell proliferation\neach dominates the dispersal process on different time scales. From data\nanalysis and simulation of an active particle model, we demonstrate that\ncontact interactions act to speed up the early population spreading by\npromoting individual cells to a state of higher persistence, which constitutes\nan as-yet unreported contact enhancement of locomotion. Our findings suggest\nthat the current modeling paradigm of memoryless interacting active particles\nmay need to be extended to account for the possibility of internal states and\nhistory-dependent behaviour of motile cells.\n", "  The paper deals with the asymptotic properties of a symmetric random walk in\na high contrast periodic medium in $\\mathbb Z^d$, $d\\geq 1$. We show that under\nproper diffusive scaling the random walk exhibits a non-standard limit\nbehaviour. In addition to the coordinate of the random walk in $\\mathbb Z^d$ we\nintroduce an extra variable that characterizes the position of the random walk\nin the period and show that this two-component process converges in law to a\nlimit Markov process. The components of the limit process are mutually coupled,\nthus we cannot expect that the limit behaviour of the coordinate process is\nMarkov. We also prove the convergence in the path space for the said random\nwalk.\n", "  The gravitational radiation driven capture (GR capture) between unequal mass\nblack holes without spins has been investigated with numerical relativistic\nsimulations. We adopt the parabolic approximation which assumes that the\ngravitational wave radiation from a weakly hyperbolic orbit is the same as that\nfrom the parabolic orbit having the same pericenter distance. Using the\nradiated energies from the parabolic orbit simulations, we have obtained the\ncritical impact parameter ($b_{\\rm crit}$) for the GR capture for weakly\nhyperbolic orbit as a function of initial energy. The most energetic encounters\noccur around the boundary between the direct merging and the fly-by orbits, and\ncan emit several percent of initial total ADM energy at the peak. When the\ntotal mass is fixed, energy and angular momentum radiated in the case of\nunequal mass black holes are smaller than those of equal mass black holes\nhaving the same initial orbital angular momentum for the fly-by orbits. We have\ncompared our results with two different Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations, the\nexact parabolic orbit (EPO) and PN corrected orbit (PNCO). We find that the\nagreement between the EPO and the numerical relativity breaks down for very\nclose encounters ($\\it{e.g.}$, $b_{\\rm crit} \\lesssim 100$ M), and it becomes\nworse for higher mass ratios. For instance, the critical impact parameters can\ndiffer by more than $50\\%$ from those obtained in EPO if the relative velocity\nat infinity $v_{\\infty}$ is larger than 0.1 for the mass ratio of\n$m_{1}/m_{2}=16$. The PNCO gives more consistent results than EPO, but it also\nunderestimates the critical impact parameter for the GR capture at $b_{\\rm\ncrit} \\lesssim40$ M.\n", "  We propose a new implementation of a quantum speed meter QND measurement\nscheme. It employs two independent optical readouts of the interferometer test\nmasses, featuring strongly different values of the bandwidths $\\gamma_{1,2}$\nand of the optical circulating power $I_{1,2}$, with the special relationship\nof $I_1/I_2=\\gamma_1/\\gamma_2$. The outputs of these two position meters have\nto be combined by an additional beamsplitter. In this scheme, signals at the\ncommon and the differential outputs of the interferometer setup are\nproportional to the position and the velocity of the test masses, respectively.\nThe influence of the position meter-like back action force associated with the\nposition signal can be cancelled using the EPR approach by measuring the\namplitude quadrature of the beamsplitter common output correlated with this\nforce. In the standard signal-recycled Michelson interferometer topology of the\nmodern gravitational-wave detectors, two independent optical position meters\ncan be implemented by two orthogonal polarisations of the probe light. Our\nanalysis shows that the EPR speedmeter provides significantly improved\nsensitivity for all frequencies below $\\sim 30\\,{\\rm Hz}$ compared to an\nequivalent signal recycled Michelson interferometer. We believe the EPR\nspeedmeter scheme to be very attractive for future upgrades of gravitational\nwave detectors, because it requires only minor changes to be implemented in the\ninterferometer hardware and allows to switch between the position meter and the\nspeed meter modes within short time-scales and without any changes to the\nhardware.\n", "  Motivated by the three-dimensional topological field theory / two-dimensional\nconformal field theory (CFT) correspondence, we study a broad class of\none-dimensional quantum mechanical models, known as anyonic chains, that can\ngive rise to an enormously rich (and largely unexplored) space of\ntwo-dimensional critical theories in the thermodynamic limit. One remarkable\nfeature of these systems is the appearance of non-local microscopic\n\"topological symmetries\" that descend to topological defects of the resulting\nCFTs. We derive various model-independent properties of these theories and of\nthis topological symmetry / topological defect correspondence. For example, by\nstudying precursors of certain twist and defect fields directly in the anyonic\nchains, we argue that (under mild assumptions) the two-dimensional CFTs\ncorrespond to particular modular invariants with respect to their maximal\nchiral algebras and that the topological defects descending from topological\nsymmetries commute with these maximal chiral algebras. Using this map, we apply\nproperties of defect Hilbert spaces to show how topological symmetries give a\nhandle on the set of allowed relevant deformations of these theories.\nThroughout, we give a unified perspective that treats the constraints from\ndiscrete symmetries on the same footing as the constraints from topological\nones.\n", "  In this paper we solve the inverse problem for a class of mean field models\n(Curie-Weiss model and its multi-species version) when multiple thermodynamic\nstates are present, as in the low temperature phase where the phase space is\nclustered. The inverse problem consists in reconstructing the model parameters\nstarting from configuration data generated according to the distribution of the\nmodel. We show that the application of the inversion procedure without taking\ninto account the presence of many states produces very poor inference results.\nThis problem is overcomed using the clustering algorithm. When the system has\ntwo symmetric states of positive and negative magnetization, the parameter\nreconstruction can be also obtained with smaller computational effort simply by\nflipping the sign of the magnetizations from positive to negative (or\nviceversa). The parameter reconstruction fails when the system is critical: in\nthis case we give the correct inversion formulas for the Curie-Weiss model and\nwe show that they can be used to measuring how much the system is close to\ncriticality.\n", "  Motivated by cold atom and ultra-fast pump-probe experiments we study the\nmelting of long-range antiferromagnetic order of a perfect N\\'eel state in a\nperiodically driven repulsive Hubbard model. The dynamics is calculated for a\nBethe lattice in infinite dimensions with non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field\ntheory. In the absence of driving melting proceeds differently depending on the\nquench of the interactions to hopping ratio $U/J_0$ from the atomic limit. For\n$U \\gg J_0$ decay occurs due to mobile charge-excitations transferring energy\nto the spin sector, while for $J_0 \\gtrsim U$ it is governed by the dynamics of\nresidual quasi-particles. Here we explore the rich effects strong periodic\ndriving has on this relaxation process spanning three frequency $\\omega$\nregimes: (i) high-frequency $\\omega \\gg U,J_0$, (ii) resonant $l\\omega = U >\nJ_0$ with integer $l$, and (iii) in-gap $U > \\omega > J_0$ away from resonance.\nIn case (i) we can quickly switch the decay from quasi-particle to\ncharge-excitation mechanism through the suppression of $J_0$. For (ii) the\ninteraction can be engineered, even allowing an effective $U=0$ regime to be\nreached, giving the reverse switch from a charge-excitation to quasi-particle\ndecay mechanism. For (iii) the exchange interaction can be controlled with\nlittle effect on the decay. By combining these regimes we show how periodic\ndriving could be a potential pathway for controlling magnetism in\nantiferromagnetic materials. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate the\naccuracy and applicability of matrix product state techniques to the\nHamiltonian DMFT impurity problem subjected to strong periodic driving.\n", "  In a recent manuscript, we showed how an electron pocket in the shape of a\ndiamond with concave sides could potentially explain changes in sign of the\nHall coefficient R_H in the underdoped high-Tc cuprates as a function of\nmagnetic field and temperature. For simplicity, this Fermi surface is assumed\nto be constructed from arcs of a circle connected at vertices which is an idea\nborrowed from Banik and Overhauser. Such a diamond-shaped pocket is proposed to\nbe the product of biaxial charge-density wave order, which was subsequently\nconfirmed in x-ray scattering experiments. Since those x-ray scattering\nexperiments were performed, the biaxial Fermi surface reconstruction scheme has\ngarnered widespread support in the scientific literature. It has been shown to\naccurately account for the cross-section of the Fermi surface pocket observed\nin quantum oscillation measurements, the sign and behavior of the Hall\ncoefficient, the size of the high magnetic field electronic contribution to the\nheat capacity and more recently the form of the angle-dependent\nmagnetoresistance.In their comment, Chakravarty and Wang raise several\nimportant questions relating to the validity of the Hall coefficient we\ncalculated for such a diamond-shaped Fermi surface pocket. These questions\nconcern specifically (1) whether a change in sign of the Hall coefficient R_H\nwith magnetic field and temperature is dependent on a `special' form for the\nrounding of the vertices, (2) whether a pocket of such a geometry can produce\nquantum oscillations in R_H in the absence of other Fermi surface sections and\n(3) whether a reconstructed Fermi surface consisting of a single pocket is less\n`natural' than one consisting of multiple pockets. Below we consider each of\nthese in turn.\n", "  Based on numerical simulation and local stability analysis we describe the\nstructure of the phase space of the edge/triangle model of random graphs. We\nsupport simulation evidence with mathematical proof of continuity and\ndiscontinuity for many of the phase transitions. All but one of themany phase\ntransitions in this model break some form of symmetry, and we use this model to\nexplore how changes in symmetry are related to discontinuities at these\ntransitions.\n", "  We propose a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a\ncontinuous global $U(1)_R$ symmetry. The $R$-charges of the SM fields are\nidentified with that of their lepton numbers. As a result, both bilinear and\ntrilinear `$R$-parity violating' (RPV) terms could be present at the\nsuperpotential. However, $R$-symmetry is not an exact symmetry as it is broken\nby supergravity effects. Hence, sneutrinos acquire a small vacuum expectation\nvalue in this framework. However, a suitable choice of basis ensures that the\nbilinear RPV terms can be completely rotated away from the superpotential and\nthe scalar potential. On the other hand, the trilinear terms play a very\ncrucial role in generating neutrino masses and mixing at the tree level. This\nis noticeably different from the typical $R$-parity violating Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model. Also, gravitino mass turns out to be the order\nparameter of $R$-breaking and is directly related to the neutrino mass. We show\nthat such a gravitino, within the mass range $200~\\text{keV}\\lesssim\nm_{3/2}\\lesssim 0.1~\\text{GeV}$ can be an excellent dark matter candidate.\nFinally, we looked into the collider implications of our framework.\n", "  We show that a carbon nanotube can serve as a functional electric weak link\nperforming photo-spintronic transduction. A spin current, facilitated by strong\nspin-orbit interactions in the nanotube and not accompanied by a charge\ncurrent, is induced in a device containing the nanotube weak link by circularly\npolarized microwaves. Nanomechanical tuning of the photo-spintronic\ntransduction can be achieved due to the sensitivity of the spin-orbit\ninteraction to geometrical deformations of the weak link.\n", "  We show, that in contrast to the free electron model (standard BCS model), a\nparticular gap in the spectrum of multiband superconductors opens at some\ndistance from the Fermi energy, if conduction band is composed of hybridized\natomic orbitals of different symmetries. This gap has composite\nsuperconducting-hybridization origin, because it exists only if both the\nsuperconductivity and the hybridization between different kinds of orbitals are\npresent. So for many classes of superconductors with multiorbital structure\nsuch spectrum changes should take place. These particular changes in the\nspectrum at some distance from the Fermi level result in slow convergence of\nthe spectral weight of the optical conductivity even in quite conventional\nsuperconductors with isotropic s-wave pairing mechanism.\n", "  Kolmogorov's similarity turbulence theory in a Lagrangian frame is assessed\nwith new direct numerical simulations (DNS) of isotropic turbulence with and\nwithout hyperviscosity, which attain higher Reynolds numbers than previously\navailable. It is demonstrated that hyperviscous simulations can be used to\naccurately predict second order Lagrangian velocity structure function (LVSF-2)\nin the inertial range. The results give strong support for Kolmogorov's\nLagrangian similarity assumption and allow to compute the universal constant of\nthe LVSF-2, which gives $C_0=7.5 \\pm 0.2$, with a new level of confidence.\n", "  We study the stochastic distribution of spectator fields predicted in\ndifferent slow-roll inflation backgrounds. Spectator fields have a negligible\nenergy density during inflation but may play an important dynamical role later,\neven giving rise to primordial density perturbations within our observational\nhorizon today. During de-Sitter expansion there is an equilibrium solution for\nthe spectator field which is often used to estimate the stochastic distribution\nduring slow-roll inflation. However slow roll only requires that the Hubble\nrate varies slowly compared to the Hubble time, while the time taken for the\nstochastic distribution to evolve to the de-Sitter equilibrium solution can be\nmuch longer than a Hubble time. We study both chaotic (monomial) and plateau\ninflaton potentials, with quadratic, quartic and axionic spectator fields. We\ngive an adiabaticity condition for the spectator field distribution to relax to\nthe de-Sitter equilibrium, and find that the de-Sitter approximation is never a\nreliable estimate for the typical distribution at the end of inflation for a\nquadratic spectator during monomial inflation. The existence of an adiabatic\nregime at early times can erase the dependence on initial conditions of the\nfinal distribution of field values. In these cases, spectator fields acquire\nsub-Planckian expectation values. Otherwise spectator fields may acquire much\nlarger field displacements than suggested by the de-Sitter equilibrium\nsolution. We quantify the information about initial conditions that can be\nobtained from the final field distribution. Our results may have important\nconsequences for the viability of spectator models for the origin of structure,\nsuch as the simplest curvaton models.\n", "  A highly efficient simulation model for 2D and 3D grain growth and\nrecrystallization was developed based on the level-set method. The model\nintroduces modern computational concepts to achieve excellent performance on\nparallel computer architectures. Strong scalability was measured on ccNUMA\narchitectures. To achieve this, the proposed approach considers the application\nof local level-set functions at the grain level. Ideal and non-ideal grain\ngrowth was simulated in 3D with the objective to study the evolution of\nstatistical representative volume elements in polycrystals. In addition,\nmicrostructure evolution in an anisotropic magnetic material affected by an\nexternal magnetic field was simulated.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum of light glueballs and the string tension in a\nnumber of SO(N) lattice gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions, with N in the range\nfrom N=3 to N=16. After extrapolating to the continuum limit and then to N=oo\nwe compare to the spectrum and string tension of the SU(N=oo) gauge theory and\nfind that the most reliably and precisely calculated physical quantities are\nconsistent in that limit. We also compare the glueball spectra of those pairs\nof SO(N) and SU(N') theories that possess the same Lie algebra, i.e. SO(3) and\nSU(2), SO(4) and SU(2)xSU(2), SO(6) and SU(4), and find that for the very\nlightest glueballs the spectra are consistent within each such pair, as are the\nstring tensions and the couplings. Where there are apparent discrepancies they\nare typically for heavier glueballs, where the systematic errors are much\nharder to control. We calculate the SO(N) string tensions with a particular\nfocus on the confining properties of SO(2N+1) theories which, unlike SO(2N)\ntheories, possess a trivial centre. We find that for both the light glueballs\nand for the string tension SO(2N) and SO(2N+1) gauge theories appear to form a\nsingle smooth sequence.\n", "  A thermal colloid suspended in a liquid will transition from a short time\nballistic motion to a long time diffusive motion. However, the transition\nbetween ballistic and diffusive motion is highly dependent on the properties\nand structure of the particular liquid. We directly observe a free floating\ntracer particle's ballistic motion and its transition to the long time regime\nin both a Newtonian fluid and a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid. We examine the\nmotion of the free particle in a Newtonian fluid and demonstrate a high degree\nof agreement with the accepted Clercx-Schram model for motion in a dense fluid.\nMeasurements of the functional form of the ballistic-to-diffusive transition\nprovide direct measurements of the temperature, viscosity, and tracer radius.\nWe likewise measure the motion in a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid and find a\nsignificant disagreement between the theoretical asymptotic behavior and our\nmeasured values of the microscopic properties of the fluid. We observe a\ngreatly increased effective mass for a freely moving particle and a decreased\nplateau modulus.\n", "  Attenuating low-frequency sound remains a challenge, despite many advances in\nthis direction. Recently developed acoustic metamaterials enable efficient\nsubwavelength wave manipulation and attenuation due to exotic effects such as\nunusually high reflectivity, negative refraction or cloaking. In particular,\nlabyrinthine acoustic metamaterials can provide broadband sound reduction and\nexhibit extremely high effective refractive index values due to their\ncharacteristic topological architecture. In this paper, we design a novel\nlabyrinthine metamaterial with hybrid characteristics compared to previously\nproposed structures, by exploiting a spider web-inspired configuration. The\ndeveloped metamaterial structure is characterized by additional tunability of\nthe frequencies at which band gaps or negative group velocity modes occur, thus\nenabling versatility in the functionalities of the resulting structures. Time\ntransient simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmetamaterials in manipulating wave fields in terms of transmission/reflection\ncoefficients, amplitude attenuation and time delay properties in broadband\nfrequency ranges. Results could find applications in the development of\npractical lightweight acoustic shielding structures with enhanced broadband\nwave-reflecting performance.\n", "  Dipolar Dark Matter (DDM) is an alternative model motivated by the challenges\nfaced by the standard cold dark matter model to describe the right\nphenomenology at galactic scales. A promising realisation of DDM was recently\nproposed in the context of massive bigravity theory. The model contains dark\nmatter particles, as well as a vector field coupled to the effective composite\nmetric of bigravity. This model is completely safe in the gravitational sector\nthanks to the underlying properties of massive bigravity. In this work we\ninvestigate the exact decoupling limit of the theory, including the\ncontribution of the matter sector, and prove that it is free of ghosts in this\nlimit. We conclude that the theory is acceptable as an Effective Field Theory\nbelow the strong coupling scale.\n", "  In this paper we further develop the fluctuating hydrodynamics proposed in\narXiv:1511.03646 in a number of ways. We first work out in detail the classical\nlimit of the hydrodynamical action, which exhibits many simplifications. In\nparticular, this enables a transparent formulation of the action in physical\nspacetime in the presence of arbitrary external fields. It also helps to\nclarify issues related to field redefinitions and frame choices. We then\npropose that the action is invariant under a $Z_2$ symmetry to which we refer\nas the dynamical KMS symmetry. The dynamical KMS symmetry is physically\nequivalent to the previously proposed local KMS condition in the classical\nlimit, but is more convenient to implement and more general. It is applicable\nto any states in local equilibrium rather than just thermal density matrix\nperturbed by external background fields. Finally we elaborate the formulation\nfor a conformal fluid, which contains some new features, and work out the\nexplicit form of the entropy current to second order in derivatives for a\nneutral conformal fluid.\n", "  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide the most efficient\noptical gain materials and have potential for making nanolasers with the\nsmallest gain media with lowest energy consumption. But lasing demonstrations\nbased on TMDs have so far been limited to low temperatures. Here, we\ndemonstrate the first room-temperature laser operation in the infrared\nwavelengths from a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride on a silicon\nphotonic-crystal nanobeam cavity. Our demonstration is made possible by a\nunique choice of TMD material with emission wavelength below silicon\nabsorption, combined with the high Q-cavity design by silicon nanobeam. Lasing\nat 1132 nm is demonstrated at room-temperature pumped by a continuous-wave\nlaser, with a threshold density at 6.6 W/cm2. The room-temperature linewidth of\n0.202 nm is the narrowest with the corresponding Q of 5603, the largest\nobserved for a TMD laser. This demonstration establishes TMDs as practical\nnanolaser materials. The silicon structures provide additional benefits for\nsilicon-compatible nanophotonic applications in the important infrared\nwavelengths.\n", "  We demonstrate a high-purity source of indistinguishable single photons using\na quantum dot embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide. The source features a\nnear-unity internal coupling efficiency and the collected photons are\nefficiently coupled off-chip by implementing a taper that adiabatically couples\nthe photons to an optical fiber. By quasi-resonant excitation of the quantum\ndot, we measure a single-photon purity larger than 99.4% and a photon\nindistinguishability of up to 94+-1% by using p-shell excitation combined with\nspectral filtering to reduce photon jitter. A temperature-dependent study\nallows pinpointing the residual decoherence processes notably the effect of\nphonon broadening. Strict resonant excitation is implemented as well as another\nmean of suppressing photon jitter, and the additional complexity of suppressing\nthe excitation laser source is addressed. The study opens a clear pathway\ntowards the long-standing goal of a fully deterministic source of\nindistinguishable photons, which is integrated on a planar photonic chip.\n", "  Fractional topological insulators (FTI) are electronic topological phases in\n$(3+1)$ dimensions enriched by time reversal (TR) and charge $U(1)$\nconservation symmetries. We focus on the simplest series of fermionic FTI,\nwhose bulk quasiparticles consist of deconfined partons that carry fractional\nelectric charges in integral units of $e^\\ast=e/(2n+1)$ and couple to a\ndiscrete $\\mathbb{Z}_{2n+1}$ gauge theory. We propose massive symmetry\npreserving or breaking FTI surface states. Combining the long-ranged entangled\nbulk with these topological surface states, we deduce the novel topological\norder of quasi-$(2+1)$ dimensional FTI slabs as well as their corresponding\nedge conformal field theories.\n", "  This paper is intended both an introduction to the algebraic geometry of\nholomorphic Poisson brackets, and as a survey of results on the classification\nof projective Poisson manifolds that have been obtained in the past twenty\nyears. It is based on the lecture series delivered by the author at the Poisson\n2016 Summer School in Geneva. The paper begins with a detailed treatment of\nPoisson surfaces, including adjunction, ruled surfaces and blowups, and leading\nto a statement of the full birational classification. We then describe several\nconstructions of Poisson threefolds, outlining the classification in the\nregular case, and the case of rank-one Fano threefolds (such as projective\nspace). Following a brief introduction to the notion of Poisson subspaces, we\ndiscuss Bondal's conjecture on the dimensions of degeneracy loci on Poisson\nFano manifolds. We close with a discussion of log symplectic manifolds with\nsimple normal crossings degeneracy divisor, including a new proof of the\nclassification in the case of rank-one Fano manifolds.\n", "  We consider the inverse problem of recovering both an unknown electric\ncurrent and the surrounding electromagnetic parameters of a medium from\nboundary measurements. This inverse problem arises in brain imaging. We show\nthat under generic conditions one can recover both the source and the\nelectromagnetic parameters if these are piecewise constant and the current\nsource is invariant in a fixed direction or a harmonic function.\n", "  We consider the analogue of Kutasov-Schwimmer-Seiberg duality for\ntwo-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ $U(k)$ gauge theory with one adjoint $X$\nwith the superpotential $\\Tr X^{l+1}$ and with fundamental and anti-fundamantal\nchiral multiplets. We give the evidences for the proposed dualities by\nanalytically proving that the elliptic genus of dual pair coincides with each\nother. For some of the dual pairs flowing to the superconformal field theory,\nwe show the nonperturbative truncation of the chiral ring. For the theory with\none adjoint and $N_f >k$ fundamentals, we argue the theory exhibits mass gap.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is crucial for simulating and understanding exotic\nphysics of strongly correlated many-body systems, such as high--temperature\nsuperconductors, or fractional quantum Hall states. The entanglement of\nnon-identical particles exhibits richer physics of strong many-body\ncorrelations and offers more opportunities for quantum computation, especially\nwith neutral atoms where in contrast to ions the interparticle interaction is\nwidely tunable by Feshbach resonances. Moreover, the inter-species entanglement\nforms a basis for the properties of various compound systems, ranging from\nBose-Bose mixtures to photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. So far, the\ninter-species entanglement has only been obtained for trapped ions. Here we\nreport on the experimental realization of entanglement of two neutral atoms of\ndifferent isotopes. A ${}^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ atom and a ${}^{85}\\mathrm{Rb}$ atom\nare confined in two single--atom optical traps separated by 3.8 $\\mu$m.\nCreating a strong Rydberg blockade, we demonstrate a heteronuclear\ncontrolled--NOT (C--NOT) quantum gate and generate a heteronuclear entangled\nstate, with raw fidelities $0.73 \\pm 0.01$ and $0.59 \\pm 0.03$, respectively.\nOur work, together with the technologies of single--qubit gate and C--NOT gate\ndeveloped for identical atoms, can be used for simulating any many--body system\nwith multi-species interactions. It also has applications in quantum computing\nand quantum metrology, since heteronuclear systems exhibit advantages in low\ncrosstalk and in memory protection.\n", "  Quantum mechanics makes the otherwise stable vacua of a theory metastable\nthrough the nucleation of bubbles of the new vacuum. This in turn causes a\nfirst order phase transition. These cosmological phase transitions may have\nplayed an important role in settling our universe into its current vacuum, and\nthey may also happen in future. The most important frameworks where vacuum\ndecay happens contain a large number of fields. Unfortunately, calculating the\ntunneling rates in these models is very time-consuming. In this paper we\npresent a simple approximation for the tunneling rate by reducing it to a\none-field problem which is easy to calculate. We demonstrate the validity of\nthis approximation using our recent code \"Anybubble\" for several classes of\npotentials.\n", "  The remoteness of the Sun and the harsh conditions prevailing in the solar\ncorona have so far limited the observational data used in the study of solar\nphysics to remote-sensing observations taken either from the ground or from\nspace. In contrast, the `solar wind laboratory' is directly measured in situ by\na fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic\nfields at specific points in space. Since 2007, the solar-terrestrial relations\nobservatory (STEREO) has been providing images of the solar wind that flows\nbetween the solar corona and spacecraft making in-situ measurements. This has\nallowed scientists to directly connect processes imaged near the Sun with the\nsubsequent effects measured in the solar wind. This new capability prompted the\ndevelopment of a series of tools and techniques to track heliospheric\nstructures through space. This article presents one of these tools, a web-based\ninterface called the 'Propagation Tool' that offers an integrated research\nenvironment to study the evolution of coronal and solar wind structures, such\nas Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) and\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs). These structures can be propagated from the\nSun outwards to or alternatively inwards from planets and spacecraft situated\nin the inner and outer heliosphere. In this paper, we present the global\narchitecture of the tool, discuss some of the assumptions made to simulate the\nevolution of the structures and show how the tool connects to different\ndatabases.\n", "  We present a catalog of sources detected above 10 GeV by the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) in the first 7 years of data using the Pass 8 event-level\nanalysis. This is the Third Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT Sources (3FHL),\ncontaining 1556 objects characterized in the 10 GeV - 2 TeV energy range. The\nsensitivity and angular resolution are improved by factors of 3 and 2 relative\nto the previous LAT catalog at the same energies (1FHL). The vast majority of\ndetected sources (79%) are associated with extragalactic counterparts at other\nwavelengths, including 16 sources located at very high redshift ($z>2$). Eight\npercent of the sources have Galactic counterparts and 13% are unassociated (or\nassociated with a source of unknown nature). The high-latitude sky and the\nGalactic plane are observed with a flux sensitivity of 4.4 to 9.5$\\times\n10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively (this is approximately 0.5% and\n1% of the Crab Nebula flux above 10 GeV). The catalog includes 214 new\n$\\gamma$-ray sources. The substantial increase in the number of photons (more\nthan 4 times relative to 1FHL and 10 times to 2FHL) also allows us to measure\nsignificant spectral curvature for 32 sources and find flux variability for 163\nof them. Furthermore, we estimate that for the same flux limit of $10^{-12}$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, the energy range above 10 GeV has twice as many sources\nas above 50 GeV, highlighting the importance, for future Cherenkov telescopes,\nof lowering the energy threshold as much as possible.\n", "  The soliton solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation are derived by the\nimplementation of the dressing method. The form of the one and two soliton\nsolutions coincides with the form obtained by other methods.\n", "  In recent years, dielectric rod based metasurface lenses have been\nparticularly investigated for their potential applications in replacing the\ntraditional bulky lens with high efficiency. However, the isolated granular\nstructure may lead to robustness and chromatic aberration concerns. In this\nwork, a low refractive-index embedding medium was applied to solve the\nstructural stability problem that also enables the device to be transferable to\ndesired position or surface. Based on this, a compound metasurface lens\ncomposed of randomly interleaved frequency-selective zone sectors is proposed\nto broaden the bandwidth of the two-dimensional device. The validities of the\nproposed method and the application potentials for the multifunctional lens\nthat can manipulate RGB three colors have been numerically examined and\nverified. The current results are of essence in guiding the future design of\nmetasurface lenses for real practice.\n", "  An entropy of the Ising model in the mean field approximation is derived by\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We consider a grand canonical ensemble with\nrespect to the temperature and the external magnetic field. A cusp arises at\nthe critical point, which shows a simple and new geometrical aspect of this\nmodel. In educational sense, this curve with a cusp helps students acquire a\nmore intuitive view on statistical phase transitions.\n", "  A two-dimensional Sp($2N$) vector model with small $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsuperconformal symmetry is formulated, and its chiral algebra is shown to be\ngenerated by superprimary fields of even conformal weight. This vector model is\nthe large level limit of a coset theory with large $\\mathcal{N}=4$, whose\nproposed AdS$_3$ dual is a minimal Vasiliev higher spin theory with gauge\nalgebra generated by fields of even spin. The relation of this vector model to\nthe symmetric product orbifold, dual to tensionless strings in AdS$_3$ $\\times$\nS$^3$ $\\times$ $\\mathbb{T}^4$, is also worked out.\n", "  We have studied the Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions from $N=Z+2$ neighbors to\n$N=Z=$ odd nuclei in $p$-shell region by using isospin-projected and\n$\\beta\\gamma$-constraint antisymmetrized molecular dynamics combined with\ngenerator coordinate method. The calculated GT transition strengths from $0^+1$\nstates to $1^+0$ states such as ${}^{6} \\textrm{He}(0_1^+1)\\rightarrow{}^{6}\n\\textrm{Li}(1_1^+0)$, ${}^{10} \\textrm{Be}(0_1^+1)\\rightarrow{}^{10}\n\\textrm{B}(1_1^+0)$, and ${}^{14} \\textrm{C}(0_1^+1)\\rightarrow{}^{14}\n\\textrm{N}(1_2^+0)$ exhaust more than 50\\% of the sum rule. These $N=Z+2$\ninitial states and $N=Z=$ odd final states are found to dominantly have\n$S=0,T=1$ $nn$ pairs and $S=1,T=0$ $pn$ pairs, respectively. Based on\ntwo-nucleon ($NN$) pair picture, we can understand the concentration of the GT\nstrengths as the spin-isospin-flip transition $nn(S=0,T=1)\\rightarrow\npn(S=1,T=0)$ in $LS$-coupling scheme. The GT transition can be a good probe to\nidentify the spin-isospin partner states with $nn$ pairs and $pn$ pairs of\n$N=Z+2$ and $N=Z=$ odd nuclei, respectively.\n", "  The generating function of cubic Hodge integrals satisfying the local\nCalabi-Yau condition is conjectured to be a tau function of a new integrable\nsystem which can be regarded as a fractional generalization of the Volterra\nlattice hierarchy, so we name it the fractional Volterra hierarchy. In this\npaper, we give the definition of this integrable hierarchy in terms of Lax pair\nand Hamiltonian formalisms, construct its tau functions, and present its\nmulti-soliton solutions.\n", "  We describe a theoretical approach for finding spontaneously symmetry-broken\nelectronic phases due to strong electronic interactions when using recently\ndeveloped slave-particle (slave-boson) approaches based on occupation numbers.\nWe describe why, to date, spontaneous symmetry breaking has proven difficult to\nachieve in such approaches. We then provide a total-energy based approach for\nintroducing auxiliary symmetry breaking fields into the solution of the\nslave-particle problem that leads to lowered total energies for symmetry broken\nphases. We point out that not all slave-particle approaches yield to energy\nlowering: the slave-particle model being used must explicitly describe the\ndegrees of freedom that break symmetry. Finally, our total energy approach\npermits us to greatly simplify the formalism used to achieve a self-consistent\nsolution between spinon and slave modes while increasing numerical stability\nand greatly speeding up the calculations.\n", "  Random phase approximation ground state contains electronic configurations\nwhere two (and more) identical electrons can occupy the same molecular\nspin-orbital violating the Pauli exclusion principle. This overcounting of\nelectronic configurations happens due to quasiboson approximation in the\ntreatment of electron-hole pair operators. We describe the method to restore\nthe Pauli principle in the RPA wavefunction. The proposed theory is illustrated\nby the calculations of molecular dipole moments and electronic kinetic\nenergies. The Hartree-Fock based RPA, which is corrected for the Pauli\nprinciple, gives the results of comparable accuracy with M{\\o}ller-Plesset\nsecond order perturbation theory and coupled-cluster singles and doubles\nmethod.\n", "  Higgsinos and Wino have strong motivations for being Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates in supersymmetry, but their annihilation cross sections are quite\nlarge. For thermal generation and a single component DM setup the higgsinos or\nwino may have masses of around 1 or 2-3 TeV respectively. For such DM\ncandidates, a small amount of slepton coannihilation may decrease the effective\nDM annihilation cross section. This, in turn reduces the lower limit of the\nrelic density satisfied DM mass by more than 50%. Almost a similar degree of\nreduction of the same limit is also seen for squark coannihilations. However,\non the contrary, for near degeneracy of squarks and higgsino DM, near its\ngeneric upper limit, the associated coannihilations may decrease the relic\ndensity, thus extending the upper limit towards higher DM masses. We also\ncompute the direct and indirect detection signals. Here, because of the\nquasi-mass degeneracy of the squarks and the LSP, we come across a situation\nwhere squark exchange diagrams may contribute significantly or more strongly\nthan the Higgs exchange contributions in the spin-independent direct detection\ncross section of DM. For the higgsino-DM scenario, we observe that a DM mass of\n600 GeV to be consistent with WMAP/PLANCK and LUX data for sfermion\ncoannihilations. The LUX data itself excludes the region of 450 to 600 GeV, by\na half order of magnitude of the cross-section, well below the associated\nuncertainty. The similar combined lower limit for a wino DM is about 1.1 TeV.\nThere is hardly any collider bound from the LHC for squarks and sleptons in\nsuch a compressed scenario where sfermion masses are close to the mass of a\nhiggsino/wino LSP.\n", "  We report results of an investigation of the temperature dependence of the\nmagnon and phonon frequencies in NiO. A combination of Brillouin - Mandelstam\nand Raman spectroscopies allowed us to elucidate the evolution of the phonon\nand magnon spectral signatures from the Brillouin zone center (GHz range) to\nthe second-order peaks from the zone boundary (THz range). The\ntemperature-dependent behavior of the magnon and phonon bands in the NiO\nspectrum indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic (AF) order fluctuation or\na persistent AF state at temperatures above the Neel temperature (T=523 K).\nTuning the intensity of the excitation laser provides a method for\ndisentangling the features of magnons from acoustic phonons without the\napplication of a magnetic field. Our results are useful for interpretation of\nthe inelastic-light scattering spectrum of NiO, and add to the knowledge of its\nmagnon properties important for THz spintronic devices.\n", "  Quantum physics in one spatial dimension is remarkably rich, yet even with\nstrong interactions and disorder, surprisingly tractable. This is due to the\nfact that the low-energy physics of nearly all one-dimensional systems can be\ncast in terms of the Luttinger liquid, a key concept that parallels that of the\nFermi liquid in higher dimensions. Although there have been many theoretical\nproposals to use linear chains and ladders of Josephson junctions to create\nnovel quantum phases and devices, only modest progress has been made\nexperimentally. One major roadblock has been understanding the role of disorder\nin such systems. We present experimental results that establish the insulating\nstate of linear chains of sub-micron Josephson junctions as Luttinger liquids\npinned by random offset charges, providing a one-dimensional implementation of\nthe Bose glass, strongly validating the quantum many-body theory of\none-dimensional disordered systems. The ubiquity of such an electronic glass in\nJosephson-junction chains has important implications for their proposed use as\na fundamental current standard, which is based on synchronisation of coherent\ntunnelling of flux quanta (quantum phase slips).\n", "  The Thirring model with random couplings is a translationally invariant\ngeneralisation of the SYK model to 1+1 dimensions, which is tractable in the\nlarge N limit. We compute its two point function, at large distances, for any\nstrength of the random coupling. For a given realisation, the couplings contain\nboth irrelevant and relevant marginal operators, but statistically, in the\nlarge N limit, the random couplings are overall always marginally irrelevant,\nin sharp distinction to the usual Thirring model. We show the leading term to\nthe $\\beta$ function in conformal perturbation theory, which is quadratic in\nthe couplings, vanishes, while its usually subleading cubic term matches our RG\nflow.\n", "  We perform particle resolved experimental studies on the heterogeneous\ncrystallisation process of two compo- nent mixtures of hard spheres. The\ncomponents have a size ratio of 0.39. We compared these with molecular dynamics\nsimulations of homogenous nucleation. We find for both experiments and\nsimulations that the final assemblies are interstitial solid solutions, where\nthe large particles form crystalline close-packed lattices, whereas the small\nparticles occupy random interstitial sites. This interstitial solution\nresembles that found at equilibrium when the size ratios are 0.3 [Filion et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 168302 (2011)] and 0.4 [Filion, PhD Thesis, Utrecht\nUniversity (2011)]. However, unlike these previous studies, for our system sim-\nulations showed that the small particles are trapped in the octahedral holes of\nthe ordered structure formed by the large particles, leading to long-lived\nnon-equilibrium structures in the time scales studied and not the equilibrium\ninterstitial solutions found earlier. Interestingly, the percentage of small\nparticles in the crystal formed by the large ones rapidly reaches a maximum of\naround 14% for most of the packing fractions tested, unlike previous\npredictions where the occupancy of the interstitial sites increases with the\nsystem concentration. Finally, no further hopping of the small particles was\nobserved.\n", "  Forecasting fault failure is a fundamental but elusive goal in earthquake\nscience. Here we show that by listening to the acoustic signal emitted by a\nlaboratory fault, machine learning can predict the time remaining before it\nfails with great accuracy. These predictions are based solely on the\ninstantaneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal, and do not\nmake use of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal\nemitted from the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that\nenables failure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We\nhypothesize that applying this approach to continuous seismic data may lead to\nsignificant advances in identifying currently unknown signals, in providing new\ninsights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on fault failure times.\n", "  The Elementary Goldstone Higgs (EGH) model is a perturbative extension of the\nstandard model (SM), which identifies the EGH boson as the observed Higgs\nboson. In this paper, we study pair production of the EGH boson via gluon\nfusion at the LHC and find that the resonant contribution of the heavy scalar\nis very small and the SM-like triangle diagram contribution is strongly\nsuppressed. The total production cross section mainly comes from the box\ndiagram contribution and its value can be significantly enhanced with respect\nto the SM prediction.\n", "  The free electron laser (FEL), as a next-generation light source, is an\nattractive tool in scientific frontier research because of its advantages of\nfull coherence, ultra-short pulse duration, and controllable polarization.\nOwing to the demand of real-time bunch diagnosis during FEL experiments,\nprecise nondestructive measurements of the polarization and X-ray energy\nspectrum using one instrument are preferred. In this paper, such an instrument\nbased on the electron time-of-flight technique is proposed. By considering the\ncomplexity and nonlinearity, a numerical model in the framework of Geant4 has\nbeen developed for optimization. Taking the Shanghai Soft X-ray FEL user\nfacility as an example, its measurement performances' dependencies on the\ncritical parameters were studied systematically, and, finally, an optimal\ndesign was obtained, achieving resolutions of 0.5% for the polarization degree\nand 0.3 eV for the X-ray energy spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the star formation history and chemical evolution of isolated\nanalogues of Local Group (LG) ultra faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs; stellar mass\nrange of 10^2 solar mass < M_star <10^5 solar mass) and gas rich, low mass\ndwarfs (Leo P analogs; stellar mass range of 10^5 solar mass < M_star <10^6\nsolar mass). We perform a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in\nsimulations to follow their evolution from the era of the first generation of\nstars down to z=0. We confirm that reionization, combined with supernova (SN)\nfeedback, is primarily responsible for the truncated star formation in UFDs.\nSpecifically, haloes with a virial mass of M_vir < 2 x 10^9 solar mass form>\n90\\% of stars prior to reionization. Our work further demonstrates the\nimportance of Population~III (Pop~III) stars, with their intrinsically high\n$\\rm [C/Fe]$ yields, and the associated external metal-enrichment, in producing\nlow-metallicity stars ($\\rm [Fe/H]\\lesssim-4$) and carbon-enhanced metal-poor\n(CEMP) stars. We find that UFDs are composite systems, assembled from multiple\nprogenitor haloes, some of which hosted only Population~II (Pop~II) stars\nformed in environments externally enriched by SNe in neighboring haloes,\nnaturally producing, extremely low-metallicity Pop~II stars. We illustrate how\nthe simulated chemical enrichment may be used to constrain the star formation\nhistories (SFHs) of true observed UFDs. We find that Leo P analogs can form in\nhaloes with M_vir ~ 4 x 10^9 solar mass (z=0). Such systems are less affected\nby reionization and continue to form stars until z=0, causing higher\nmetallicity tails. Finally, we predict the existence of extremely\nlow-metallicity stars in LG UFD galaxies that preserve the pure chemical\nsignatures of Pop~III nucleosynthesis.\n", "  The thermal relic density of dark matter is conventionally set by two-body\nannihilations. We point out that in many simple models, $3 \\to 2$ annihilations\ncan play an important role in determining the relic density over a broad range\nof model parameters. This occurs when the two-body annihilation is\nkinematically forbidden, but the $3\\to 2$ process is allowed; we call this\nscenario \"Not-Forbidden Dark Matter\". We illustrate this mechanism for a vector\nportal dark matter model, showing that for a dark matter mass of $m_\\chi \\sim\n\\text{MeV - 10 GeV}$, $3 \\to 2$ processes not only lead to the observed relic\ndensity, but also imply a self-interaction cross section that can solve the\ncusp/core problem. This can be accomplished while remaining consistent with\nstringent CMB constraints on light dark matter, and can potentially be\ndiscovered at future direct detection experiments.\n", "  Thermodynamics is based on the notions of energy and entropy. While energy is\nthe elementary quantity governing physical dynamics, entropy is the fundamental\nconcept in information theory. In this work, starting from first principles, we\ngive a detailed didactic account on the relations between energy and entropy\nand thus physics and information theory. We show that thermodynamic process\ninequalities, like the Second Law, are equivalent to the requirement that an\neffective description for physical dynamics is strongly relaxing. From the\nperspective of information theory, strongly relaxing dynamics govern the\nirreversible convergence of a statistical ensemble towards the maximally\nnon-commital probability distribution that is compatible with thermodynamic\nequilibrium parameters. In particular, Markov processes that converge to a\nthermodynamic equilibrium state are strongly relaxing. Our framework\ngeneralizes previous results to arbitrary open and driven systems, yielding\nnovel thermodynamic bounds for idealized and real processes.\n", "  We use a magnetothermal resistance method to measure lattice thermal\nconductivity of pure single crystal metals over a wide range of temperatures.\nLarge transverse magnetic fields are applied to suppress electronic thermal\nconduction. The total thermal conductivity and the electrical conductivity are\nmeasured as functions of applied magnetic field. The lattice thermal\nconductivity is then extracted by extrapolating the thermal conductivity versus\nelectrical conductivity curve at zero electrical conductivity. We used this\nmethod to experimentally measure the lattice thermal conductivity and Lorenz\nnumber in single crystal Al (100), Cu (100) and Zn (001) in a temperature range\nof 5 to 60 K. Our results show that the measured phonon thermal conductivity\nversus temperature plot has a peak around one tenth of the Debye Temperature,\nand the Lorenz number is found to deviate from the Sommerfeld value in the\nintermediate temperature range.\n", "  We investigate M-theory and heterotic compactifications to 7 and 3\ndimensions. In 7 dimensions we discuss a class of massive supergravities that\narise from M-theory on K3 and point out obstructions to realizing these\ntheories in a dual heterotic framework with a geometric description. Taking\nM-theory further down to 3 dimensions on K3xK3 with a choice of flux leads to a\nrich landscape of theories with various amounts of supersymmetry, including\nthose preserving 6 supercharges. We explore possible heterotic realizations of\nthese vacua and prove a no--go theorem: every heterotic geometry that preserves\n6 supercharges preserves 8 supercharges.\n", "  The EFT coefficients in any gapped, scalar, Lorentz invariant field theory\nmust satisfy positivity requirements if there is to exist a local, analytic\nWilsonian UV completion. We apply these bounds to the tree level scattering\namplitudes for a massive Galileon. The addition of a mass term, which does not\nspoil the non-renormalization theorem of the Galileon and preserves the\nGalileon symmetry at loop level, is necessary to satisfy the lowest order\npositivity bound. We further show that a careful choice of successively higher\nderivative corrections are necessary to satisfy the higher order positivity\nbounds. There is then no obstruction to a local UV completion from\nconsiderations of tree level 2-to-2 scattering alone. To demonstrate this we\ngive an explicit example of such a UV completion.\n", "  Earlier it was shown that the entropy of an ideal gas, contained in a box and\nmoving in a gravitational field, develops an area dependence when it approaches\nthe horizon of a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Here we extend the\nabove result in two directions; viz., to (a) the stationary axisymmteric\nspacetimes and (b) time dependent cosmological spacetimes evolving\nasymptotically to the de Sitter or the Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes.\nWhile our calculations are exact for the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes,\nfor the cosmological case we present an analytical expression of the entropy\nwhen the spacetime is close to the de Sitter or the Schwarzschild de Sitter\nspacetime. Unlike the static spacetimes, there is no hypersurface orthogonal\ntimelike Killing vector field in these cases. Nevertheless, the results hold\nand the entropy develops an area dependence in the appropriate limit.\n", "  Topological ordered phases are related to changes in the properties of their\nquasi-particle excitations (anyons). We study these relations in the framework\nof projected entanglement pair states (\\textsf{PEPS}) and show how condensing\nand confining anyons reduces a local gauge symmetry to a global on-site\nsymmetry. We also study the action of this global symmetry over the\nquasiparticle excitations. As a byproduct, we observe that this symmetry\nreduction effect can be applied to one-dimensional systems as well, and brings\nabout appealing physical interpretations on the classification of phases with\nsymmetries using matrix product states (\\textsf{MPS}). The case of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on-site symmetry is studied in detail.\n", "  The quantum Liouville equation, which describes the phase space dynamics of a\nquantum system of fermions, is analyzed from statistical point of view as a\nparticular example of the Kramers-Moyal expansion. Quantum mechanics is\nextended to the relativistic domain by generalizing the Wigner-Moyal equation.\nThus, an expression is derived for the relativistic mass in the Wigner quantum\nphase space presentation. The diffusion with an imaginary diffusion coefficient\nis also discussed. An imaginary stochastic process is proposed as the origin of\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  We study simple effective models of fermionic WIMP dark matter, where the\ndark matter candidate is a mixture of a Standard Model singlet and an n-plet of\nSU(2) with n >= 3, stabilized by a discrete symmetry. The dark matter mass is\nassumed to be around the electroweak scale, and the mixing is generated by\nhigher-dimensional operators, with a cutoff scale > 1 TeV. For appropriate\nvalues of the mass parameters and the mixing we find that the observed dark\nmatter relic density can be generated by coannihilation. Direct detection\nexperiments have already excluded large parts of the parameter space, and the\nnext-generation experiments will further constrain these models.\n", "  We consider the correlation function of an arbitrary number of local\nobservables in quantum field theory. We show that, at tree level in the strong\nfield regime, these correlations arise solely from fluctuations in the initial\nstate. We obtain the general expression of these correlation functions in terms\nof the classical solution of the field equation of motion and its derivatives\nwith respect to its initial conditions, that can be arranged graphically as the\nsum of labeled trees where the nodes are the individual observables, and the\nlinks are pairs of derivatives acting on them. For 3-point (and higher)\ncorrelation functions, there are additional tree-level terms beyond from the\nstrong field approximation, generated throughout the evolution of the system.\n", "  We consider novel implementation of quantum teleportation protocol of unknown\nqubit by superposition of displacement operators with equal modulo but opposite\nin sign amplitudes. Entangled hybrid state with coherent components of small\namplitude is used as quantum channel. Coherent components of the quantum\nchannel displace the teleported qubit at the same absolute but opposite in sign\nvalues, so that any information about amount by which the qubit is displaced is\nlost despite the fact that one of these events has definitely occurred. Alice\nunambiguously distinguishes her measurement outcomes and Bob obtains at his\ndisposal two states of a single photon in superposition state of two modes. The\nsuperposition of the displacement operators is nonunitary, so success\nprobability of the protocol depends on the amplitude parameters of the\nteleported qubit. Remarkably, the success probability of the teleportation can\nbe made arbitrary high for some amplitude values of the teleported state by\nmeans of initial amplitude modulation of unknown qubit and bits of classical\ninformation for Bob to identify the states. The scheme is realized by linear\noptics methods and works without photon number resolving measurement.\n", "  Entanglement in quantum mechanics contradicts local realism, and is a\nmanifestation of quantum non-locality. Its presence can be detected through the\nviolation of Bell, or CHSH inequalities. Paradigmatic quantum systems provide\nexamples of both, non-entangled and entangled states. Here we consider a\nminimal complexity setup consisting of 6 Majorana bound states. We find that\nany allowed state in the degenerate Majorana space is non-locally entangled. We\nshow how to measure (with available techniques) the CHSH-violating\ncorrelations, using either intermediate strength or weak measurement protocols.\n", "  We investigate the potential of single Higgs boson production at the LHC and\nat egamma mode of future linear electron-positron collider to probe\nnon-standard HZgamma and Hgammagamma couplings. We consider the semi-elastic\nproduction process pp-> p gamma p-> pHqX at the LHC where q represents the\nquarks and X represents the remnants of one of the initial protons. We also\nstudy the single Higgs production through gamma e-> He in the egamma collision\nat the future linear collider. We perform a model-independent analysis and\nobtain the sensitivity bounds on the non-standard Higgs couplings for both\ncolliders.\n", "  It is interesting and of significant importance to investigate how network\nstructures co-evolve with opinions. The existing models of such co-evolution\ntypically lead to the final states where network nodes either reach a global\nconsensus or break into separated communities, each of which holding its own\ncommunity consensus. Such results, however, can hardly explain the richness of\nreal-life observations that opinions are always diversified with no global or\neven community consensus, and people seldom, if not never, totally cut off\nthemselves from dissenters. In this article, we show that, a simple model\nintegrating consensus formation, link rewiring and opinion change allows\ncomplex system dynamics to emerge, driving the system into a dynamic\nequilibrium with co-existence of diversified opinions. Specifically, similar\nopinion holders may form into communities yet with no strict community\nconsensus; and rather than being separated into disconnected communities,\ndifferent communities remain to be interconnected by non-trivial proportion of\ninter-community links. More importantly, we show that the complex dynamics may\nlead to different numbers of communities at steady state with a given tolerance\nbetween different opinion holders. We construct a framework for theoretically\nanalyzing the co-evolution process. Theoretical analysis and extensive\nsimulation results reveal some useful insights into the complex co-evolution\nprocess, including the formation of dynamic equilibrium, the phase transition\nbetween different steady states with different numbers of communities, and the\ndynamics between opinion distribution and network modularity, etc.\n", "  One of the most well-studied young stellar associations, Taurus-Auriga, will\nbe observed by the extended Kepler mission, K2, in the spring of 2017. K2\nCampaign 13 (C13) will be a unique opportunity to study many stars in this\nyoung association at high photometric precision and cadence. Using observations\nfrom the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey, we identify\n\"dippers\", stochastic variables, and periodic variables among K2 C13 target\nstars. This release of the KELT data (lightcurve data in e-tables) provides the\ncommunity with long-time baseline observations to assist in the understanding\nof the more exotic variables in the association. Transient-like phenomena on\ntimescales of months to years are known characteristics in the light curves of\nyoung stellar objects, making contextual pre- and post-K2 observations critical\nto understanding their underlying processes. We are providing a comprehensive\nset of the KELT light curves for known Taurus-Auriga stars in K2 C13. The\ncombined data sets from K2 and KELT should permit a broad array of\ninvestigations related to star formation, stellar variability, and\nprotoplanetary environments.\n", "  We show that in the 3-polytropes model of Hebeler et al.\n\\cite{Hebeler:2013nza} for the neutron star equation of state at\nsupersaturation densities a third family of compact stars can be obtained which\nconfirms the possibility of high-mass twin stars that have coincident masses\n$M_1=M_2\\approx 2~M_\\odot$ and significantly different radii $|R_1-R_2|>2-3 $\nkm. We show that the causality constraint puts severe limitations on the\nmaximum mass of the third family sequence which can be relaxed when this scheme\nis extended to four polytropes thus mimicking a realistic high-density matter\nEoS.\n", "  Understanding the correlation between structure and rheology in colloidal\nsuspensions is important as these suspensions are crucial in industrial\napplications. Moreover, colloids exhibit a wide range of structures under\nconfinement that could considerably alter the viscosity. Here, we use a\ncombination of experiments and simulations to elucidate how confinement induced\nstructures alter the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and repulsive\nforces to produce up to a ten fold change in the viscosity. We use a custom\nbuilt confocal rheoscope to image the particle configurations of a colloidal\nsuspension while simultaneously measuring the viscosity. We find a\nnon-monotonic trend to the viscosity under confinement that is strongly\ncorrelated with the microstructure. As the gap decreases below 15 particle\ndiameters, the viscosity first decreases from its bulk value, shows\nfluctuations with the gap, and then sharply increases for gaps below three\nparticle diameters. Further, we compare our experimental results to two\nsimulations techniques that enables us to determine the relative contributions\nof hydrodynamic and short range repulsive stresses. The first method uses the\nlubrication approximation to find the hydrodynamic stress and includes a short\nrange repulsive force between the particles and the second is a Stokesian\ndynamics simulation that calculates the full hydrodynamic stress in the\nsuspension. We find that the decrease in the viscosity at moderate confinements\nhas a significant contribution from both the hydrodynamic and repulsive forces\nwhereas the increase in viscosity at gaps less than three particle diameters\narises primarily from short range repulsive forces. These results provide new\ninsights to the unique rheological behavior of confined suspensions and further\nenable us to tune the viscosity by changing properties such as the gap,\npolydispersity, and the volume fraction.\n", "  Starting from 6D superconformal field theories (SCFTs) realized via F-theory,\nwe show how reduction on a circle leads to a uniform perspective on the phase\nstructure of the resulting 5D theories, and their possible conformal fixed\npoints. Using the correspondence between F-theory reduced on a circle and\nM-theory on the corresponding elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau threefold, we\nshow that each 6D SCFT with minimal supersymmetry directly reduces to a\ncollection of between one and four 5D SCFTs. Additionally, we find that in most\ncases, reduction of the tensor branch of a 6D SCFT yields a 5D generalization\nof a quiver gauge theory. These two reductions of the theory often correspond\nto different phases in the 5D theory which are in general connected by a\nsequence of flop transitions in the extended Kahler cone of the Calabi--Yau\nthreefold. We also elaborate on the structure of the resulting conformal fixed\npoints, and emergent flavor symmetries, as realized by M-theory on a canonical\nsingularity.\n", "  Recently holographic prescriptions are proposed to compute quantum complexity\nof a given state in the boundary theory. A specific proposal known as\n`holographic subregion complexity' is supposed to calculate the the complexity\nof a reduced density matrix corresponding to a static subregion. We study\ndifferent families of singular subregions in the dual field theory and find the\ndivergence structure and universal terms of holographic subregion complexity\nfor these singular surfaces. We find that there are new universal terms,\nlogarithmic in the UV cutoff, due to the singularities of a family of surfaces\nincluding a kink in (2+1)-dimension and cones in even dimensional field\ntheories. We find examples of new divergent terms such as square logarithm and\nnegative powers times the logarithm of the UV cut-off parameter.\n", "  We perform the spectral analysis of the evolution operator U of quantum walks\nwith an anisotropic coin, which include one-defect models, two-phase quantum\nwalks, and topological phase quantum walks as special cases. In particular, we\ndetermine the essential spectrum of U, we show the existence of locally\nU-smooth operators, we prove the discreteness of the eigenvalues of U outside\nthe thresholds, and we prove the absence of singular continuous spectrum for U.\nOur analysis is based on new commutator methods for unitary operators in a\ntwo-Hilbert spaces setting, which are of independent interest.\n", "  There have been increasing reports that the diffusion coefficient of\nmacromolecules depends on time and fluctuates randomly. Here, a novel method to\nelucidate the fluctuating diffusivity from trajectory data is developed. The\ntime-averaged mean square displacement (MSD), a common tool in\nsingle-particle-tracking (SPT) experiments, is generalized into a second order\ntensor, with which information on both magnitude fluctuations and orientational\nfluctuations of the diffusivity can be clearly detected. This new method is\nutilized to analyze the center-of-mass motion of four polymer models, the Rouse\nmodel, the Zimm model, a reptation model, and a rigid rodlike polymer, and it\nis found that these models exhibit distinctly different types of magnitude and\norientational fluctuations of the diffusivity. This method of the time-averaged\nMSD tensor can be applied also to the trajectory data obtained in SPT\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the influence of a charged-Higgs on the excess of branching fraction\nratio, $R_M = BR(\\bar B \\to M \\tau \\bar\\nu_\\tau)/BR(\\bar B \\to M \\ell \\bar\n\\nu_\\ell)$ $(M=D, D^*)$, in a generic two-Higgs-doublet model. In order to\ninvestigate the lepton polarization, the detailed decay amplitudes with lepton\nhelicity are given. When the charged-Higgs is used to resolve excesses, it is\nfound that two independent Yukawa couplings are needed to explain the $R_D$ and\n$R_{D^*}$ anomalies. We show that when the upper limit of $BR(B_c \\to \\tau \\bar\n\\nu_\\tau)<30\\%$ is included, $R_D$ can be significantly enhanced while\n$R_{D^*}<0.27$. With the $BR(B_c\\to \\tau \\bar \\nu_\\tau)$ constraint, we find\nthat the $\\tau$-lepton polarizations can be still affected by the charged-Higgs\neffects, where the standard model (SM) predictions are obtained as: $P^\\tau_{D}\n\\approx 0.324$ and $P^\\tau_{D^*}\\approx -0.500$, and they can be enhanced to be\n$P^\\tau_{D} \\approx 0.5$ and $P^\\tau_{D^*} \\approx -0.41$ by the charged-Higgs.\nThe integrated lepton froward-backward asymmetry (FBA) is also studied, where\nthe SM result is $\\bar A^{D^{(*)},\\tau}_{FB} \\approx -0.359(0.064)$, and they\ncan be enhanced (decreased) to be $\\bar A^{D^{(*)},\\tau}_{FB} \\approx -0.33\n(0.02)$.\n", "  In the meeting SN 1987A 30 years later, I presented my minority view that the\nmajority (or even all) of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are driven by jets\nrather than by neutrinos, and that the majority of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia)\nreach their explosion via the core degenerate scenario. New simulations\npresented at the meeting did not achieve an explosion of CCSNe. I critically\nexamine other arguments that where presented in support of the neutrino-driven\nmodel, and present counter arguments that support the jet-driven explosion\nmechanism. The jets operate via a negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). The\nnegative feedback mechanism explains the explosion energy being several times\nthe binding energy of the core in most CCSNe. At the present time when we do\nnot know yet what mechanism explodes massive stars and we do not know yet what\nevolutionary route leads white dwarfs to explode as SN Ia, we must be open to\ndifferent ideas and critically examine old notions.\n", "  A software package, called DFTBaby, is published, which provides the\nelectronic structure needed for running non-adiabatic molecular dynamics\nsimulations at the level of charge-consistent tight-binding DFT. A long-range\ncorrection is incorporated to avoid spurious charge transfer states. Excited\nstate energies, their analytic gradients and scalar non-adiabatic couplings are\ncomputed using tight-binding TD-DFT. These quantities are fed into a molecular\ndynamics code, which integrates Newton's equations of motion for the nuclei\ntogether with the electronic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Non-adiabatic effects\nare included by surface hopping. As an example, the program is applied to the\noptimization of excited states and non-adiabatic dynamics of polyfluorene. The\npython and Fortran source code is available at\nhttp://www.dftbaby.chemie.uni-wuerzburg.de/.\n", "  The SYK model is a quantum mechanical model that has been proposed to be\nholographically dual to a $1+1$-dimensional model of a quantum black hole. An\nemergent \"gravitational\" mode of this model is governed by an unusual action\nthat that has been called the Schwarzian action. It governs a reparametrization\nof a circle. We show that the path integral of the Schwarzian theory is\none-loop exact. The argument uses a method of fermionic localization, even\nthough the model itself is purely bosonic.\n", "  We establish a connection between recent developments in the study of\nvortices in the abelian Higgs models, and in the theory of structure-preserving\ndiscrete conformal maps. We explain how both are related via conformal mapping\nproblems involving prescribed linear combinations of the curvature and volume\nform, and show how the discrete conformal theory can be used to construct\ndiscrete vortex solutions.\n", "  Bird, et. al. and Sasaki, et. al. have recently proposed the intriguing\npossibility that the black holes detected by LIGO could be all or part of the\ncosmological dark matter. This offers an alternative to WIMPs and axions, where\ndark matter could be comprised solely of Standard Model particles. The mass\nrange lies within an observationally viable window and the predicted merger\nrate can be tested by future LIGO observations. In this paper, we argue that\nnon-thermal histories favor production of black holes near this mass range --\nwith heavier ones unlikely to form in the early universe and lighter black\nholes being diluted through late-time entropy production. We discuss how this\nprediction depends on the primordial power spectrum, the likelihood of black\nhole formation, and the underlying model parameters. We find the prediction for\nthe preferred mass range to be rather robust assuming a blue spectral index\nless than two. We consider the resulting relic density in black holes, and\nusing recent observational constraints, establish whether they could account\nfor all of the dark matter today.\n", "  We propose a new variable, the charm fraction, for collider searches for new\nphysics. We analyze this variable in the context of searches for simplified\nsupersymmetry models with squarks, the gluino, and the bino, assuming that only\nthe lightest mass-degenerate squarks can be produced at the high-luminosity\nLHC. The charm fraction complements event counting and kinematic information,\nincreasing the sensitivity of the searches for models with heavy gluinos, for\nwhich squark production is flavor-blind. If squarks are discovered at the LHC,\nthis variable can help discriminate between different underlying models. In\nparticular, with improved charm tagging, the charm fraction can provide\ninformation on the gluino mass, and in some scenarios, on whether this mass is\nwithin the reach of a future 100 TeV hadron collider.\n", "  Lots of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been predicted theoretically, and\nfurther confirmed in experiment, which have wide applications in nanoscale\nelectronic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Here, the thermoelectric\nproperties of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are systematically investigated,\nbased on semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. It is found that spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) has important effects on electronic transport coefficients in\np-type doping, but neglectful influences on n-type ones. The room-temperature\nsheet thermal conductance is 14.2 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for SbTeI and 12.6\n$\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for BiTeI, which are lower than one of most well-known 2D\nmaterials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide, group IV-VI, group-VA and\ngroup-IV monolayers. By analyzing group velocities and phonon lifetimes, the\nvery low sheet thermal conductance of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers is mainly\ndue to small group velocities. It is found that the high-frequency optical\nbranches contribute significantly to the total thermal conductivity, being\nobviously different from usual picture with little contribution from optical\nbranches. According to cumulative lattice thermal conductivity with respect to\nphonon mean free path (MFP), it is difficulty to further reduce lattice thermal\nconductivity by nanostructures. Finally, possible thermoelectric figure of\nmerit $ZT$ of ATeI (A=Sb and Bi) monolayers are calculated. It is found that\nthe p-type doping has more excellent thermoelectric properties than n-type\ndoping, and at room temperature, the peak $ZT$ can reach 1.11 for SbTeI and\n0.87 for BiTeI, respectively. These results make us believe that ATeI (A=Sb and\nBi) monolayers may be potential 2D thermoelectric materials, and can stimulate\nfurther experimental works to synthesize these monolayers.\n", "  In this paper, we have applied the Lorentz-invariance-violation (LIV) class\nof dispersion relations (DR) with the dimensionless parameter n = 2 and the\n\"sign of LIV\" {\\eta}_+ = 1, to phenomenologically study the effect of quantum\ngravity in the strong gravitational field. Specifically, we have studied the\neffect of the LIV-DR induced quantum gravity on the Schwarzschild black hole\nthermodynamics. The result shows that the effect of the LIV-DR induced quantum\ngravity speeds up the black hole evaporation, and its corresponding black hole\nentropy undergoes a leading logarithmic correction to the \"reduced\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy\", and the ill defined situations (i.e. the\nsingularity problem and the critical problem) are naturally bypassed when the\nLIV-DR effect is present. Also, to put our results in a proper perspective, we\nhave compared with the earlier findings by another quantum gravity candidate,\ni.e. the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Finally, we conclude from the\ninert remnants at the final stage of the black hole evaporation that, the GUP\nas a candidate for describing quantum gravity can always do as well as the\nLIV-DR by adjusting the model-dependent parameters, but in the same\nmodel-dependent parameters the LIV-DR acts as a more suitable candidate.\n", "  Understanding the relationship between spontaneous stochastic fluctuations\nand the topology of the underlying gene regulatory network is of fundamental\nimportance for the study of single-cell stochastic gene expression. Here by\nsolving the analytical steady-state distribution of the protein copy number in\na general kinetic model of stochastic gene expression with nonlinear feedback\nregulation, we reveal the relationship between stochastic fluctuations and\nfeedback topology at the single-molecule level, which provides novel insights\ninto how and to what extent a feedback loop can enhance or suppress molecular\nfluctuations. Based on such relationship, we also develop an effective method\nto extract the topological information of a gene regulatory network from\nsingle-cell gene expression data. The theory is demonstrated by numerical\nsimulations and, more importantly, validated quantitatively by single-cell data\nanalysis of a synthetic gene circuit integrated in human kidney cells.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically investigate plasmon propagation\ncharacteristics in AB and AA stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) in the presence of\nenergy asymmetry due to an electrostatic field oriented perpendicularly to the\nplane of the graphene sheet. We first derive the optical conductivity of BLG\nusing the Kubo formalism incorporating energy asymmetry and finite electron\nscattering. All results are obtained for room temperature (300K) operation. By\nsolving Maxwell's equations in a dual gate device setup, we obtain the\nwavevector of propagating plasmon modes in the transverse electric (TE) and\ntransverse magnetic (TM) directions at terahertz frequencies. The plasmon\nwavevector allows us to compare the compression factor, propagation length, and\nthe mode confinement of TE and TM plasmon modes in bilayer and monolayer\ngraphene sheets and also study the impact of material parameters on plasmon\ncharacteristics. Our results show that the energy asymmetry can be harnessed to\nincrease the propagation length of TM plasmons in BLG. AA stacked BLG shows a\nlarger increase in propagation length than AB stacked BLG; conversely, it is\nvery insensitive to the Fermi level variations. Additionally, the dual gate\nstructure allows independent modulation of the energy asymmetry and the Fermi\nlevel in BLG, which is advantageous for reconfiguring plasmon characteristics\npost device fabrication.\n", "  Quantum behavior of the John Lagrangian from the Fab Four class of Covariant\nGalileons is stud- ied. We consider one-loop corrections to the John\ninteraction due to cubic scalar field interactions. Counter Terms are\ncalculated, one of them belongs to the Fab Four class, the other one to\nCovariant Galileons. The role of quantum corrections in context of cosmological\napplications is discussed.\n", "  Are the initial conditions for clustered star formation the same as for\nnon-clustered star formation? To investigate the initial gas properties in\nyoung proto-clusters we carried out a comprehensive and high-sensitivity study\nof the internal structure, density, temperature, and kinematics of the dense\ngas content of the NGC1333 region in Perseus, one of the nearest and best\nstudied embedded clusters. The analysis of the gas velocities in the\nPosition-Position-Velocity space reveals an intricate underlying gas\norganization both in space and velocity. We identified a total of 14\nvelocity-coherent, (tran-)sonic structures within NGC1333, with similar\nphysical and kinematic properties than those quiescent, star-forming (aka\nfertile) fibers previously identified in low-mass star-forming clouds. These\nfibers are arranged in a complex spatial network, build-up the observed total\ncolumn density, and contain the dense cores and protostars in this cloud. Our\nresults demonstrate that the presence of fibers is not restricted to low-mass\nclouds but can be extended to regions of increasing mass and complexity. We\npropose that the observational dichotomy between clustered and non-clustered\nstar-forming regions might be naturally explained by the distinct spatial\ndensity of fertile fibers in these environments.\n", "  Determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and measuring the CP-violating phase\n$\\delta_{CP}$ are two of the main aims in neutrino physics today. The upcoming\nT2HK (with small matter effects and high statistics) and DUNE (with large\nmatter effects) experiments have been shown to have excellent sensitivity to\n$\\delta_{CP}$ and the neutrino mass hierarchy, respectively. The recent T2HKK\nproposal aims to improve the hierarchy sensitivity of T2HK by placing one of\nthe two tanks of the HK detector at a site in Korea, to collect data at $\\sim\n1100$ km baseline. In light of the fact that DUNE will anyway collect data at\n$\\sim 1300$ km, we explore whether it is advantageous to collect additional\nlong-baseline data as proposed with T2HKK, or to enhance the\n$\\delta_{CP}$-precision with the `conventional' T2HK by keeping both detector\ntanks in Japan. We do this by comparing the physics reach of these two options\nin conjunction with DUNE. We find that DUNE+T2HKK is better at excluding the\nwrong hierarchy, reaching $\\Delta\\chi^2 > 175$ irrespective of the true\nparameters. While DUNE+T2HK can measure $\\delta_{CP}$ with more precision in\nsome parts of the parameter space, both DUNE+T2HK and DUNE+T2HKK perform\nequally well near the current best-fit point, giving a $\\delta_{CP}$ width of\naround $15^\\circ$. The T2HKK setup allows us to correlate and constrain the\nsystematic errors between the two detectors collecting data from the same\nsource, which can increase the sensitivity of the experiment by up to 25\\%.\nSuch a reduction of the systematic errors is crucial for determining the\noscillation parameters with greater significance.\n", "  The spin splitting of conduction band electrons in inversion-asymmetric\nInGaAs/InP quantum wells is studied by Shubnikov-de Haas measurements combining\nthe analysis of beating patterns and coincidence measurements in doubly tilted\nmagnetic fields. The method allows us to determine the absolute values of the\nRashba and linear Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction coefficients, their\nrelative sign and the full Land\\'e g-tensor. This is achieved by analyzing the\nanisotropy of the beat node positions with respect to both polar and azimuthal\nangles between the magnetic field direction and the quantum well normal. We\nshow that the spin-orbit interaction is dominated by a large Rashba coefficient\ntogether with a linear Dresselhaus coefficient that is 10 $\\%$ of the Rashba\ncoefficient. Their relative sign is found to be positive. The g-tensor is found\nto have a marked out-of-plane anisotropy and a smaller but distinct in-plane\nanisotropy due to spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  Thanks to an expansion with respect to densities of energy, mass and entropy,\nwe discuss the concept of thermocapillary fluid for inhomogeneous fluids. The\nnon-convex state law valid for homogeneous fluids is modified by adding terms\ntaking into account the gradients of these densities. This seems more realistic\nthan Cahn and Hilliard's model which uses a density expansion in mass-density\ngradient only. Indeed, through liquid-vapor interfaces, realistic potentials in\nmolecular theories show that entropy density and temperature do not vary with\nthe mass density as it would do in bulk phases. In this paper, we prove using a\nrescaling process near the critical point that liquid-vapor interfaces behave\nessentially in the same way as in Cahn and Hilliard's model.\n", "  The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group is the asymptotic symmetry\ngroup of asymptotically flat gravity. Recently, Donnay et al. have derived an\nanalogous symmetry group acting on black hole event horizons. For a certain\nchoice of boundary conditions, it is a semidirect product of ${\\rm Diff}(S^2)$,\nthe smooth diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere, acting on $C^\\infty(S^2)$, the\nsmooth functions on the two-sphere. We observe that the same group appears in\nfluid dynamics as symmetries of the compressible Euler equations. We relate\nthese two realizations of ${\\rm Diff}(S^2)\\ltimes C^\\infty(S^2)$ using the\nblack hole membrane paradigm. We show that the Lie-Poisson brackets of membrane\nparadigm fluid charges reproduce the near-horizon BMS algebra. The perspective\npresented here may be useful for understanding the BMS algebra at null\ninfinity.\n", "  We study models in which the inflaton is coupled to two otherwise decoupled\nsectors, and the effect of preheating and related processes on their energy\ndensities during the evolution of the universe. Over most of parameter space,\npreheating is not disrupted by the presence of extra sectors, and even\ncomparatively weakly coupled sectors can get an order 1 fraction of the total\nenergy at this time. If two sectors are both preheated, the high number\ndensities could also lead to inflaton mediated thermalisation. If only one\nsector is preheated, Bose enhancement of the late time inflaton decays may\ncause significant deviations from the perturbative prediction for their\nrelative reheat temperatures. Meanwhile, in Non-Oscillatory inflation models\nresonant effects can result in exponentially large final temperature\ndifferences between sectors that have similar couplings to the inflaton.\nAsymmetric reheating is potentially relevant for a range of beyond the Standard\nModel physics scenarios. We show that in dark matter freeze-in models, hidden\nsector temperatures a factor of 10 below that of the visible sector are\ntypically needed for the relic abundance to be set solely by freeze-in\ndynamics.\n", "  Minimal Composite Higgs Models (MCHM) have long provided a solution to the\nhierarchy problem of the Standard Model, yet suffer from various sources of\nfine tuning that are becoming increasingly problematic with the lack of new\nphysics observations at the LHC. We develop a new fine tuning measure that\naccurately counts each contribution to fine tuning (single, double, triple,\netc) that can occur in a theory with $n_p$ parameters, that must reproduce\n$n_o$ observables. We then use a novel scanning procedure to perform a\ncomprehensive study of three different two-site, 4D, $SO(5)\\rightarrow SO(4)$\nMCHMs with all third generation fermions included, distinguished by the choice\nof the lepton embeddings. These are the\nMCHM$^{\\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\\textbf{5-5-5}}$,\nMCHM$^{\\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\\textbf{14-14-10}}$ and\nMCHM$^{\\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\\textbf{14-1-10}}$, where MCHM$^{q-t-b}_{l-\\tau-\\nu}$\nhas the lepton doublet partner in representation $l$, tau partner in\nrepresentation $\\tau$, and so on. We find that embedding at least one massive\nlepton in the symmetric $\\textbf{14}$ of $SO(5)$ reduces the tuning for the\ncase of low top partner masses (in line with previous results), but that this\nis balanced against the increased complexity of the model when one properly\naccounts for all sources of fine tuning. We study both the current relative\nfine-tuning of each scenario, and the future prospects. Noting that the\ndifferent scenarios behave differently with respect to future improvements in\ncollider measurements, we find that the\nMCHM$^{\\textbf{5-5-5}}_{\\textbf{14-1-10}}$ enjoys a relatively low increase in\nfine tuning even for a future lower bound on the top partner masses of 3.4 TeV\n(or equivalently a maximum Higgs-fermion or Higgs-gluon coupling deviation of\n2%).\n", "  Dark matter with momentum- or velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei has\nshown significant promise for explaining the so-called Solar Abundance Problem,\na longstanding discrepancy between solar spectroscopy and helioseismology. The\nbest-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5\nGeV. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun\ncan be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of\nsuch models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the\nfirst time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions,\nthermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically\nthin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that\ndepending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass\nbelow which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 GeV. This has the\neffect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance\nProblem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also\nprovide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account\nthermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly\nmatched to the well-known saturation limit.\n", "  Benchmark reactions involving molecular hydrogen, such as H$_2$+D or\nH$_2$+Cl, provide the ideal platforms to investigate the effect of Near\nThreshold Resonances (NTR) on scattering processes. Due to the small reduced\nmass of those systems, shape resonances due to particular partial waves can\nprovide features at scattering energies up to a few Kelvins, reachable in\nrecent experiments. We explore the effect of NTRs on elastic and inelastic\nscattering for higher partial waves $\\ell$ in the case of H$_2$+Cl for $s$-wave\nand H$_2$+D for $p$-wave scattering, and find that NTRs lead to a different\nenergy scaling of the cross sections as compared to the well known Wigner\nthreshold regime. We give a theoretical analysis based on Jost functions for\nshort range interaction potentials. To explore higher partial waves, we adopt a\nthree channel model that incorporates all key ingredients, and explore how the\nNTR scaling is affected by $\\ell$. A short discussion on the effect of the\nlong-range form of the interaction potential is also provided.\n", "  The lack of energy dissipation and abrupt electrical phase transition of\nsuperconductors favorite them for nanoscale technologies, including radiation\ndetectors, and quantum technologies. Moreover, understanding the nanoscale\nbehavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of\ncollective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of\naccessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting\nproperties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting\nnanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and\nmore efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these\nadvantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable\nspeed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are\nfaster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we\noptimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We\nshowed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)\nmade of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous\ncoexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and\nefficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the\ngoverning mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual\nsuperconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and\nsuperconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity\neffect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest\nthat such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting\nproperties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this\nhybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting\nfilms and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near\nthe superconducting-to-insulating transition.\n", "  The spontaneous transformations associated with symmetry-breaking phase\ntransitions generate domain structures and defects that may be topological in\nnature. The formation of these defects can be described according to the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism, which provides a generic relation that applies from\ncosmological to interatomic lengthscales. Its verification is challenging,\nhowever, in particular at the cosmological scale where experiments are\nimpractical. While it has been demonstrated for selected condensed-matter\nsystems, major questions remain regarding e.g. its degree of universality. Here\nwe develop a global Kibble-Zurek picture from the condensed-matter level. We\nshow theoretically that a transition between two fluctuation regimes (Ginzburg\nand mean-field) can lead to an intermediate region with reversed scaling, and\nwe verify experimentally this behavior for the structural transition in the\nseries of multiferroic hexagonal manganites. Trends across the series allow us\nto identify additional intrinsic features of the defect formation beyond the\noriginal Kibble-Zurek paradigm.\n", "  The pulsar J1203+0038 rotates with a frequency $\\nu\\approx 592$ Hz and has\nbeen observed to transition between a radio state, during which it is visible\nas a millisecond radio pulsar, and and a Low Mass X-ray Binary state, during\nwhich accretion powered X-ray pulsations are visible. Timing during the two\nphases reveals that during the LMXB phase the neutron star is spinning down at\na rate of $\\dot{\\nu}\\approx -3 \\times 10^{-15}$ Hz/s, which is approximately\n27\\% faster than the rate measured during the radio phase, $\\dot{\\nu}\\approx\n-2.4 \\times 10^{-15}$ Hz/s, and at odds with the predictions of accretion\nmodels. In this letter we suggest that the increase in spin-down rate is\ncompatible with gravitational wave emission, and in particular to the creation\nof a `mountain' during the accretion phase. We show that asymmetries in\npycno-nuclear reaction rates in the crust can lead to a large enough mass\nquadrupole to explain the observed spin-down rate, which so far has no other\nself-consistent explanation, and that radio timing at the onset of the next\nmillisecond radio pulsar phase can test this scenario. Another possibility is\nthat an unstable $r$-mode with amplitude $\\alpha\\approx 5\\times10^{-8}$ may be\npresent in the system.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of quantum Hall bilayer systems with total filing\n$\\nu_T=1/2+1/2$ of the lowest Landau level as a function of layer distances\n$d$. Based on numerical exact diagonalization calculations, we obtain three\ndistinct phases, including an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous\ninterlayer coherence at small $d$, a composite Fermi liquid at large $d$, and\nan intermediate phase for $1.1<d/l_B<1.8$ ($l_B$ is the magnetic length). The\ntransition from the exciton superfluid to the intermediate phase is identified\nby (i) a dramatic change in the Berry curvature of the ground state under\ntwisted boundary conditions on the two layers; (ii) an energy level crossing of\nthe first excited state. The transition from the intermediate phase to the\ncomposite Fermi liquid is identified by the vanishing of the exciton superfluid\nstiffness. Furthermore, from our finite-size study, the energy cost of\ntransferring one electron between the layers shows an even-odd effect and\npossibly extrapolates to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating\nthe enhanced intralayer correlation. Our identification of an intermediate\nphase and its distinctive features shed new light on the theoretical\nunderstanding of the quantum Hall bilayer system at total filling $\\nu_T=1$.\n", "  Dirac and Weyl fermions appear as quasi-particle excitations in many\ndifferent condensed-matter systems. They display various quantum transitions\nwhich represent unconventional universality classes related to the variants of\nthe Gross-Neveu model. In this work we study the bosonized version of the\nstandard Gross-Neveu model -- the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory -- at three-loop\norder, and compute critical exponents in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions for general\nnumber of fermion flavors. Our results fully encompass the previously known\ntwo-loop calculations, and agree with the known three-loop results in the\npurely bosonic limit of the theory. We also find the exponents to satisfy the\nemergent super-scaling relations in the limit of a single-component fermion,\norder by order up to three loops. Finally, we apply the computed series for the\nexponents and their Pad\\'e approximants to several phase transitions of current\ninterest: metal-insulator transitions of spin-1/2 and spinless fermions on the\nhoneycomb lattice, emergent supersymmetric surface field theory in topological\nphases, as well as the disorder-induced quantum transition in Weyl semimetals.\nComparison with the results of other analytical and numerical methods is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Recent controversy regarding the meaning and usefulness of weak values is\nreviewed. It is argued that in spite of recent statistical arguments by Ferrie\nand Combes, experiments with anomalous weak values provide a useful\namplification techniques for precision measurements of small effects in many\nrealistic situations. The statistical nature of weak vales was questioned.\nAlthough measuring weak value requires an ensemble, it is argued that the weak\nvalue, similarly to an eigenvalue, is a property of a single pre- and\npost-selected quantum system.\n", "  We chart the breakdown of semiclassical gravity by analyzing the Virasoro\nconformal blocks to high numerical precision, focusing on the heavy-light limit\ncorresponding to a light probe propagating in a BTZ black hole background. In\nthe Lorentzian regime, we find empirically that the initial exponential\ntime-dependence of the blocks transitions to a universal $t^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$\npower-law decay. For the vacuum block the transition occurs at $t \\approx\n\\frac{\\pi c}{6 h_L}$, confirming analytic predictions. In the Euclidean regime,\ndue to Stokes phenomena the naive semiclassical approximation fails completely\nin a finite region enclosing the `forbidden singularities'. We emphasize that\nlimitations on the reconstruction of a local bulk should ultimately stem from\ndistinctions between semiclassical and exact correlators.\n", "  We construct four-center bubbled BPS solutions with a Gibbons-Hawking base\nspace. We give a systematic procedure to build scaling solutions: starting from\nthree-supertube configurations and using generalized spectral flows and gauge\ntransformations to extend to solutions with four Gibbons-Hawking centers. This\nallows us to construct very large families of smooth horizonless solutions that\nhave the same charges and angular momentum as supersymmetric black holes with a\nmacroscopically large horizon area. Our construction reveals that all scaling\nsolutions with four Gibbons Hawking centers have an angular momentum at around\n99% of the cosmic censorship bound. We give both an analytical and a numerical\nexplanation for this unexpected feature.\n", "  The advent of large scale multi-epoch surveys raises the need for automated\nlight curve (LC) processing. This is particularly true for eclipsing binaries\n(EBs), which form one of the most populated types of variable objects. The Gaia\nmission, launched at the end of 2013, is expected to detect of the order of few\nmillion EBs over a 5-year mission.\n  We present an automated procedure to characterize EBs based on the geometric\nmorphology of their LCs with two aims: first to study an ensemble of EBs on a\nstatistical ground without the need to model the binary system, and second to\nenable the automated identification of EBs that display atypical LCs. We model\nthe folded LC geometry of EBs using up to two Gaussian functions for the\neclipses and a cosine function for any ellipsoidal-like variability that may be\npresent between the eclipses. The procedure is applied to the OGLE-III data set\nof EBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as a proof of concept. The bayesian\ninformation criterion is used to select the best model among models containing\nvarious combinations of those components, as well as to estimate the\nsignificance of the components.\n  Based on the two-Gaussian models, EBs with atypical LC geometries are\nsuccessfully identified in two diagrams, using the Abbe values of the original\nand residual folded LCs, and the reduced $\\chi^2$. Cleaning the data set from\nthe atypical cases and further filtering out LCs that contain non-significant\neclipse candidates, the ensemble of EBs can be studied on a statistical ground\nusing the two-Gaussian model parameters. For illustration purposes, we present\nthe distribution of projected eccentricities as a function of orbital period\nfor the OGLE-III set of EBs in the LMC, as well as the distribution of their\nprimary versus secondary eclipse widths.\n", "  Dark state as a consequence of interference between different quantum states\nhas great importance in the fields of chip-scale atomic clock and quantum\ninformation. For the $\\Lambda$-type three-level system, this dark state is\ngenerally regarded as being dissipation-free because it is a superposition of\ntwo lowest states without dipole transition between them. However, previous\nstudies are based on the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) by neglecting the\ncounter-rotating terms in the system-environment interaction. In this work, we\nstudy non-Markovian quantum dynamics of the dark state in a $\\Lambda$-type\nthree-level system coupled to two bosonic baths and reveal the effect of\ncounter-rotating terms on the dark state. In contrast to the dark state within\nthe RWA, leakage of the dark state occurs even at zero temperature, as a result\nof these counter-rotating terms. Also, we present a method to restore the\nquantum coherence of the dark state by applying a leakage elimination operator\nto the system.\n", "  In this paper, we study and predict flow observables in 2.76 A TeV and 5.02 A\nTeV Pb +Pb collisions, using the iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model with TRENto and AMPT\ninitial conditions and with different forms of the QGP transport coefficients.\nWith properly chosen and tuned parameter sets, our model calculations can\nnicely describe various flow observables in 2.76 A TeV Pb +Pb collisions, as\nwell as the measured flow harmonics of all charged hadrons in 5.02 A TeV Pb +Pb\ncollisions. We also predict other flow observables, including $v_n(p_T)$ of\nidentified particles, event-by-event $v_n$ distributions, event-plane\ncorrelations, (Normalized) Symmetric Cumulants, non-linear response\ncoefficients and $p_T$-dependent factorization ratios, in 5.02 A TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions. We find many of these observables remain approximately the same\nvalues as the ones in 2.76 A TeV Pb+Pb collisions. Our theoretical studies and\npredictions could shed light to the experimental investigations in the near\nfuture.\n", "  When combining cosmological and oscillations results to constrain the\nneutrino sector, the question of the propagation of systematic uncertainties is\noften raised. We address this issue in the context of the derivation of an\nupper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses ($\\Sigma m_\\nu$) with recent\ncosmological data. This work is performed within the\n${{\\mathrm{\\Lambda{CDM}}}}$ model extended to $\\Sigma m_\\nu$, for which we\nadvocate the use of three mass-degenerate neutrinos. We focus on the study of\nsystematic uncertainties linked to the foregrounds modelling in CMB data\nanalysis, and on the impact of the present knowledge of the reionisation\noptical depth. This is done through the use of different likelihoods built from\nPlanck data. Limits on $\\Sigma m_\\nu$ are derived with various combinations of\ndata, including the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia\nSupernovae (SN) results. We also discuss the impact of the preference for\ncurrent CMB data for amplitudes of the gravitational lensing distortions higher\nthan expected within the ${{\\mathrm{\\Lambda{CDM}}}}$ model, and add the Planck\nCMB lensing. We then derive a robust upper limit: $\\Sigma m_\\nu< 0.17\\hbox{ eV\nat }95\\% \\hbox{CL}$, including 0.01 eV of foreground systematics. We also\ndiscuss the neutrino mass repartition and show that today's data do not allow\none to disentangle normal from inverted hierarchy. The impact on the other\ncosmological parameters is also reported, for different assumptions on the\nneutrino mass repartition, and different high and low multipole CMB\nlikelihoods.\n", "  We present BPS black hole solutions in a four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupergravity with an abelian dyonic gauging of the universal hypermultiplet\nmoduli space. This supergravity arises as the SU(3)-invariant subsector in the\nreduction of massive IIA supergravity on a six-sphere. The solutions are\nsupported by non-constant scalar, vector and tensor fields and interpolate\nbetween a unique $\\textrm{AdS}_{2} \\,\\times\\, \\textrm{H}^2$ geometry in the\nnear-horizon region and the domain-wall DW$_{4}$ (four-dimensional) description\nof the D2-brane at the boundary. Some special solutions with charged AdS$_{4}$\nor non-relativistic scaling behaviours in the ultraviolet are also presented.\n", "  We proposed to introduce general messenger-matter interactions in the\ndeflected anomaly mediated SUSY breaking scenario to explain the $g_\\mu-2$\nanomaly. Scenarios with complete or incomplete GUT multiplet messengers are\ndiscussed, respectively. The introduction of incomplete GUT mulitiplets can be\nadvantageous in various aspects. We found that the $g_\\mu-2$ anomaly can be\nsolved in both scenarios under current constraints including the gluino mass\nbounds, while the scenarios with incomplete GUT representation messengers are\nmore favored by the $g_\\mu-2$ data. We also found that the gluino is upper\nbounded by about 2.5 TeV (2.0 TeV) in Scenario A and 3.0 TeV (2.7 TeV) in\nScenario B if the generalized deflected AMSB scenarios are used to fully\naccount for the $g_\\mu-2$ anomaly at $3\\sigma$ ($2\\sigma$) level. Such a gluino\nshould be accessible in the future LHC searches. Dark matter constraints,\nincluding DM relic density and direct detection bounds, favor the scenario B\nwith incomplete GUT multiplets. Much of the allowed parameter space for the\nscenario B could be covered by the future DM direct detection experiments.\n", "  We observe and explain theoretically a dramatic evolution of the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the series of isostructural weak\nferromagnets, MnCO$_3$, FeBO$_3$, CoCO$_3$ and NiCO$_3$. The sign of the\ninteraction is encoded in the phase of x-ray magnetic diffraction amplitude,\nobserved through interference with resonant quadrupole scattering. We find very\ngood quantitative agreement with first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations, reproducing both sign and magnitude through the series, and\npropose a simplified `toy model' to explain the change in sign with 3 d shell\nfilling. The model gives a clue for qualitative understanding of the evolution\nof the DMI in Mott and charge transfer insulators.\n", "  The solution space of many classical optimization problems breaks up into\nclusters which are extensively distant from one another in the Hamming metric.\nHere, we show that an analogous quantum clustering phenomenon takes place in\nthe ground state subspace of a certain quantum optimization problem. This\ninvolves extending the notion of clustering to Hilbert space, where the\nclassical Hamming distance is not immediately useful. Quantum clusters\ncorrespond to macroscopically distinct subspaces of the full quantum ground\nstate space which grow with the system size. We explicitly demonstrate that\nsuch clusters arise in the solution space of random quantum satisfiability\n(3-QSAT) at its satisfiability transition. We estimate both the number of these\nclusters and their internal entropy. The former are given by the number of\nhardcore dimer coverings of the core of the interaction graph, while the latter\nis related to the underconstrained degrees of freedom not touched by the\ndimers. We additionally provide new numerical evidence suggesting that the\n3-QSAT satisfiability transition may coincide with the product satisfiability\ntransition, which would imply the absence of an intermediate entangled\nsatisfiable phase.\n", "  Three dimensional electron-magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) simulations of electron\ncurrent sheet dynamics in a background of stationary and unmagnetized ions and\nthe subsequent generation of electromagnetic fluctuations are carried out. The\nphysical parameters and initial magnetic configuration in the simulations are\nchosen to be similar to those in the \\textsc{Vineta}.II magnetic reconnection\nexperiment. Consistent with the experimental results, our 3D EMHD simulations\nshow the formation of an elongated electron scale current sheet together with\nthe excitation of electromagnetic fluctuations within this sheet. The\nfluctuations in the simulations are generated by an electron shear flow\ninstability growing on the in-plane (perpendicular to the direction of the main\ncurrent in the sheet) electron shear flow (or current) developed during the\ncurrent sheet evolution. Similar to the experiments, the magnetic field\nfluctuations perpendicular to the guide magnetic field exhibit a broadband\nfrequency spectrum following a power law and a positive correlation with the\naxial current density. Although the experimental results show that ions\ninfluence the spectral properties of the fluctuations, the simulations suggest\nthat the electron dynamics, even in the absence of ion motion, primarily\ndetermines the formation of the current sheet and the generation of\nelectromagnetic fluctuations observed in the experiments.\n", "  We present GiRaFFE, the first open-source general relativistic force-free\nelectrodynamics (GRFFE) code for dynamical, numerical-relativity generated\nspacetimes. GiRaFFE adopts the strategy pioneered by McKinney and modified by\nPaschalidis and Shapiro to convert a GR magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code into a\nGRFFE code. In short, GiRaFFE exists as a modification of IllinoisGRMHD, a\nuser-friendly, open-source, dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code. Both GiRaFFE and\nIllinoisGRMHD leverage the Einstein Toolkit's highly-scalable infrastructure to\nmake possible large-scale simulations of magnetized plasmas in strong,\ndynamical spacetimes on adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) grids. We demonstrate\nthat GiRaFFE passes a large suite of both flat and curved-spacetime code tests\npassed by a number of other state-of-the-art GRFFE codes, and is thus ready for\nproduction-scale simulations of GRFFE phenomena of key interest to relativistic\nastrophysics.\n", "  The observed dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature is much larger than the fluctuations observed on smaller scales and\nis dominated by the kinematic contribution from the Doppler shifting of the\nmonopole due to our motion with respect to the CMB rest frame. In addition to\nthis kinematic component, there is expected to be an intrinsic contribution\nwith an amplitude about two orders of magnitude smaller. Here we explore a\nmethod whereby the intrinsic CMB dipole can be reconstructed through\nobservation of temperature fluctuations on small scales which result from\ngravitational lensing. Though the experimental requirements pose practical\nchallenges, we show that one can in principle achieve a cosmic variance limited\nmeasurement of the primary dipole using the reconstruction method we describe.\nSince the primary CMB dipole is sensitive to the largest observable scales,\nsuch a measurement would have a number of interesting applications for early\nuniverse physics, including testing large-scale anomalies, extending the\nlever-arm for measuring local non-Gaussianity, and constraining isocurvature\nfluctuations on super-horizon scales.\n", "  Piezoelectric coefficients of $\\alpha$-Quartz are derived from symmetry\narguments based on Neumann's Principle with three different methods: Fumi,\nLandau-Lifshitz and Royer-Dieulesaint. While Fumi method is tedious and\nLandau-Lifshitz requires additional physical principles to evaluate the\npiezoelectric coefficients, Royer-Dieulesaint is the most elegant and most\nefficient of the three techniques.\n", "  The SU(3) quark model encounters a great challenge in describing even-parity\nmesons. Specifically, the $q\\bar q$ quark model has difficulties in\nunderstanding the light scalar mesons below 1 GeV, scalar and axial-vector\ncharmed mesons and $1^+$ charmonium-like state $X(3872)$. A common wisdom for\nthe resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which\nwill distort the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near\nmass degeneracy of scalar charmed mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its\nimplications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory,\nwe show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence\nof self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the\ncloseness of $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting\ntwo relevant strong couplings and the renormalization scale appearing in the\nloop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$ and\n$B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is\ncrucial for understanding the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy\nquark symmetry in conjunction with corrections from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we\nobtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,\n$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$,\n$M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$ with $\\delta\\Delta_S$ being\n$1/m_Q$ corrections. We find that the predicted mass difference of 48 MeV\nbetween $B'_{s1}$ and $B_{s0}^*$ is larger than that of $20\\sim 30$ MeV\ninferred from the relativistic quark models, whereas the difference of 15 MeV\nbetween the central values of $M_{B'_{s1}}$ and $M_{B'_1}$ is much smaller than\nthe quark model expectation of $60-100$ MeV.\n", "  FELiChEM is an infrared free electron laser (FEL) facility under\nconstruction, which consists of two oscillators generating middle-infrared and\nfar-infrared laser covering the spectral range of 2.5-200 ${\\rm{\\mu m}}$. In\nthis paper, we numerically study the output characteristics of the\nmiddle-infrared oscillator with the accurate cavity length detuning. Emphasis\nis put on the temporal structure of the micropulse and the corresponding\nspectral bandwidth. Taking the radiation wavelengths of 50 ${\\rm{\\mu m}}$ and 5\n${\\rm{\\mu m}}$ as examples, we show that the output pulse duration can be tuned\nin the range of 1-6 ps with corresponding bandwidth of 13-0.2\\% by adjusting\nthe cavity length detuning. In addition, a special discussion on the comb\nstructure is presented, and it is indicated that the comb structure may arise\nin the output optical pulse when the normalized slippage length is much smaller\nthan unity. This work has reference value for the operation of FELiChEM and\nother FEL oscillators.\n", "  We have experimentally quantified the temporal structural diversity from the\ncoordinate fluctuations of a laser beam propagating through isotropic optical\nturbulence. The main focus here is on the characterization of the long-range\ncorrelations in the wandering of a thin Gaussian laser beam over a screen after\npropagating through a turbulent medium. To fulfill this goal, a\nlaboratory-controlled experiment was conducted in which coordinate fluctuations\nof the laser beam were recorded at a sufficiently high sampling rate for a wide\nrange of turbulent conditions. Horizontal and vertical displacements of the\nlaser beam centroid were subsequently analyzed by implementing the symbolic\ntechnique based on ordinal patterns to estimate the well-known permutation\nentropy. We show that the permutation entropy estimations at multiple time\nscales evidence an interplay between different dynamical behaviors. More\nspecifically, a crossover between two different scaling regimes is observed. We\nconfirm a transition from an integrated stochastic process contaminated with\nelectronic noise to a fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst exponent H = 5/6\nas the sampling time increases. Besides, we are able to quantify, from the\nestimated entropy, the amount of electronic noise as a function of the\nturbulence strength. We have also demonstrated that these experimental\nobservations are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of noisy\nfractional Brownian motions with a well-defined crossover between two different\nscaling regimes.\n", "  The recent direct observation of gravitational waves (GW) from merging black\nholes opens up the possibility of exploring the theory of gravity in the strong\nregime at an unprecedented level. It is therefore interesting to explore which\nextensions to General Relativity (GR) could be detected. We construct an\nEffective Field Theory (EFT) satisfying the following requirements. It is\ntestable with GW observations; it is consistent with other experiments,\nincluding short distance tests of GR; it agrees with widely accepted principles\nof physics, such as locality, causality and unitarity; and it does not involve\nnew light degrees of freedom. The most general theory satisfying these\nrequirements corresponds to adding to the GR Lagrangian operators constructed\nout of powers of the Riemann tensor, suppressed by a scale comparable to the\ncurvature of the observed merging binaries. The presence of these operators\nmodifies the gravitational potential between the compact objects, as well as\ntheir effective mass and current quadrupoles, ultimately correcting the\nwaveform of the emitted GW.\n", "  We point out a unique mechanism to produce the relic abundance for glueball\ndark matter from a gauged $SU(N)_d$ hidden sector which is bridged to the\nstandard model sector through heavy vectorlike quarks colored under gauge\ninteractions from both sides. A necessary ingredient of our assumption is that\nthe vectorlike quarks, produced either thermally or non-thermally, are abundant\nenough to dominate the universe for some time in the early universe. They later\nundergo dark color confinement and form unstable vectorlike-quarkonium states\nwhich annihilate decay and reheat the visible and dark sectors. The ratio of\nentropy dumped into two sectors and the final energy budget in the dark\nglueballs is only determined by low energy parameters, including the intrinsic\nscale of the dark $SU(N)_d$, $\\Lambda_d$, and number of dark colors, $N_d$, but\ndepend weakly on parameters in the ultraviolet such as the vectorlike quark\nmass or the initial condition. We call this a cosmic selection rule for the\nglueball dark matter relic density.\n", "  Influence of magnitude and direction of static magnetic field applied on a\ndrying drop of a laboratory synthesized water base ferrofluid placed on a plane\nglass plate is investigated. Like all other multi-component fluid this drop\nalso exhibited familiar coffee ring pattern in absence of field while, this\npattern is modulated by applying magnetic field and thickness of the ring\nmodulated by the applied field and thickness of the ring decreases\nexponentially with increase in field when direction of field is normal to the\nplane of the substrate. Effect of the field on the evaporation rate and\ntemporal variation of contact angle is also studied. Results are analysed in\nlight of available models. The findings may be useful in applications like\nink-jet printing, painting and display devices involving ferrofluids.\n", "  We perform the renormalization of different types of Two-Higgs-Doublet Models\nfor the calculation of observables at next-to-leading order. In detail, we\nsuggest four different renormalization schemes based on on-shell\nrenormalization conditions as far as possible and on MSbar prescriptions for\nthe remaining field-mixing parameters where no distinguished on-shell condition\nexists and make contact to existing schemes in the literature. In particular,\nwe treat the tadpole diagrams in different ways and discuss issues of gauge\nindependence and perturbative stability in the considered schemes. The\nrenormalization group equations for the MSbar parameters are solved in each\nscheme, so that a consistent renormalization scale variation can be performed.\nWe have implemented all Feynman rules including counterterms and the\nrenormalization conditions into a FeynArts model file, so that amplitudes and\nsquared matrix elements can be generated automatically. As an application we\ncompute the decay of the light, CP-even Higgs boson of the Two-Higgs-Doublet\nModel into four fermions at next-to-leading order. The comparison of different\nschemes and the investigation of the renormalization scale dependence allows us\nto test the perturbative consistency in each of the renormalization schemes,\nand to get a better estimate of the theoretical uncertainty that arises due to\nthe truncation of the perturbation series.\n", "  We study the inner-most stable circular orbit(ISCO) of Kerr black hole in\nMOdified gravity(Kerr-MOG black hole) which is one of the exact solution of the\nfield equation of modified gravity in strong gravity regime. Kerr-MOG black\nhole is constructed commonly known kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinate by\nadding repulsive parameter like Yukawa force which explained in quantum\ngravity. We explore what is some differences of the ISCOs of Kerr-MOG black\nhole and kerr black hole.\n", "  This work studies wave propagation in the most general scalar-tensor\ntheories, particularly focusing on the causal structure realized in these\ntheories and also the shock formation process induced by nonlinear effects. For\nthese studies we use the Horndeski theory and its generalization to the two\nscalar field case. We show that propagation speeds of gravitational wave and\nscalar field wave in these theories may differ from the light speed depending\non background field configuration, and find that a Killing horizon becomes a\nboundary of causal domain if the scalar fields share the symmetry of the\nbackground spacetime. About the shock formation, we focus on transport of\ndiscontinuity in second derivatives of the metric and scalar field in the\nshift-symmetric Horndeski theory. We find that amplitude of the discontinuity\ngenerically diverges within finite time, which corresponds to shock formation.\nIt turns out that the canonical scalar field and the scalar DBI model, among\nother theories described by the Horndeski theory, are free from such shock\nformation even when the background geometry and scalar field configuration are\nnontrivial. We also observe that gravitational wave is protected against shock\nformation when the background has some symmetries at least. This fact may\nindicate that the gravitational wave in this theory is more well-behaved\ncompared to the scalar field, which typically suffers from shock formation.\n", "  The unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) is a direct modeling method based on\nthe gas dynamical model on the mesh size and time step scales. With the\nimplementation of particle transport and collision in a time-dependent flux\nfunction, the UGKS can recover multiple flow physics from the kinetic particle\ntransport to the hydrodynamic wave propagation. In comparison with direct\nsimulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), the equations-based UGKS can use the implicit\ntechniques in the updates of macroscopic conservative variables and microscopic\ndistribution function. The implicit UGKS significantly increases the\nconvergence speed for steady flow computations, especially in the highly\nrarefied and near continuum regime. In order to further improve the\ncomputational efficiency, for the first time a geometric multigrid technique is\nintroduced into the implicit UGKS, where the prediction step for the\nequilibrium state and the evolution step for the distribution function are both\ntreated with multigrid acceleration. The multigrid implicit UGKS (MIUGKS) is\nused in the non-equilibrium flow study, which includes microflow, such as\nlid-driven cavity flow and the flow passing through a finite-length flat plate,\nand high speed one, such as supersonic flow over a square cylinder. The MIUGKS\nshows 5 to 9 times efficiency increase over the previous implicit scheme. For\nthe low speed microflow, the efficiency of MIUGKS is several orders of\nmagnitude higher than the DSMC. Even for the hypersonic flow at Mach number 5\nand Knudsen number 0.1, the MIUGKS is still more than 100 times faster than the\nDSMC method for a convergent steady state solution.\n", "  We study the response of low-dimensional semiconductor superlattices to\nstrong terahertz fields on condition of a strong suppression of inelastic\nscattering processes of electrons caused by the polar-optical phonons. For our\nstudy we employ a balance equations approach which allows investigating the\nresponse of the superlattices to strong terahertz fields taking account of both\nthe inelastic and the strongly pronounced elastic scattering of electrons. Our\napproach provides a way to analyze the influence of the Bloch dynamics of\nelectrons in a superlattice miniband side by side with the effects of the\nelectron heating on the magnitude and the frequency dependence of a\nsuperlattice current responsivity in the terahertz frequency band. Our study\nshows that the suppression of the inelastic scattering caused either by a\nreduction of the superlattice dimensionality by lateral quantization or by a\nstrong magnetic field application can give rise to a huge enhancement of the\ncurrent responsivity. This enhancement can be interpreted in terms of the well\npronounced electronic bolometric effect occurring due to the efficient electron\nheating in the low-dimensional superlattices by the incident terahertz fields.\n", "  Memory effects in scattering processes are described in terms of the\nasymptotic retarded fields. These fields are completely determined by the\nscattering data and the zero mode part is set by the soft photon theorem. The\ndressed asymptotic states defining an infrared finite S- matrix for charged\nparticles can be defined as quantum coherent states using the corpuscular\nresolution of the asymptotic retarded fields. Im- posing that the net radiated\nenergy in the scattering is zero leads to the new set of conservation laws for\nthe scattering S-matrix which are equivalent to the decoupling of the soft\nmodes. The actual observabil- ity of the memory requires a non vanishing\nradiated energy and could be described using the infrared part of the\ndifferential cross section that only depends on the scattering data and the\nradiated energy. This is the IR safe cross section with any number of emitted\npho- tons carrying total energy equal to the energy involved in the actual\nmemory detection.\n", "  We present a new cubic scaling algorithm for the calculation of the RPA\ncorrelation energy. Our scheme splits up the dependence between the occupied\nand virtual orbitals in $\\chi^0$ by use of Cauchy's integral formula. This\nintroduces an additional integral to be carried out, for which we provide a\ngeometrically convergent quadrature rule. Our scheme also uses the newly\ndeveloped Interpolative Separable Density Fitting algorithm to further reduce\nthe computational cost in a way analogous to that of the Resolution of Identity\nmethod.\n", "  We examine the four dimensional path integral for Euclidean quantum gravity\nin the context of the EPRL-FK spin foam model. The state sum is restricted to\ncertain symmetric configurations which resembles the geometry of a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic universe. The vertex structure is specially chosen so\nthat a basic concept of expansion and contraction of the lattice universe is\nallowed.\n  We compute the asymptotic form of the spin foam state sum in the symmetry\nrestricted setting, and recover a Regge-type action, as well as an explicit\nform of the Hessian matrix, which captures quantum corrections. We investigate\nthe action in the three cases of vacuum, a cosmological constant, and coupled\nto dust, and find that in all cases, the corresponding FRW dynamics is\nrecovered in the limit of large lattices. While this work demonstrates a large\nintersection with computations done in the context of cosmological modelling\nwith Regge Calculus, it is ultimately a setup for treating curved geometries in\nthe renormalization of the EPRL-FK spin foam model.\n", "  Adopting a model independent approach, we constrain the various effective\ninteractions of leptophilic DM particle with the visible world from the WMAP\nand Planck data. The thermally averaged indirect DM annihilation cross-section\nand the DM-electron direct-detection cross-section for such a DM candidate are\nobserved to be consistent with the respective experimental data.\n  We study the production of cosmologically allowed leptophilic DM in\nassociation with $Z\\, (Z\\to f\\bar f)$, $f\\equiv q,\\,e^-,\\, \\mu^-$ at the ILC.\nWe perform the $\\chi^2$ analysis and compute the 99\\% C.L. acceptance contours\nin the $m_\\chi$ and $\\Lambda$ plane from the two dimensional differential\ndistributions of various kinematic observables obtained after employing parton\nshowering and hadronization to the simulated data. We observe that the dominant\nhadronic channel provides the best kinematic reach of 2.62 TeV ($m_\\chi$ = 25\nGeV), which further improves to 3.13 TeV for polarized beams at $\\sqrt{s} = 1$\nTeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$.\n", "  Prior change is discussed in observational constraints studies of nonlocally\nmodified gravity. In the latter, a model characterized by a modification of the\nform $\\sim m^2 R\\Box^{-2}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action was compared against\nthe base $\\Lambda$CDM one in a Bayesian way. It was found that the competing\nmodified gravity model is significantly disfavored (at $22 \\,$:$\\, 1$ in terms\nof betting-odds) against $\\Lambda$CDM given CMB+SNIa+BAO data, because of a\ndominant tension appearing in the $H_0 \\,$-$\\, \\Omega_M$ plan. We identify the\nunderlying mechanism generating such a tension and show that it is mostly\ncaused by the late-time, quite smooth, phantom nature of the effective dark\nenergy described by the nonlocal model. We find possible solutions for it to be\nresolved and explore a given one that consists in extending the initial\nbaseline from one massive neutrino eigenstate to three degenerate ones, whose\nabsolute mass $\\sum m_\\nu \\, / \\, 3$ is allowed to take values within a\nreasonable prior interval. As a net effect, the absolute neutrino mass is\ninferred to be non-vanishing at $2 \\sigma$ level, best-fitting at $\\sum m_\\nu\n\\approx 0.21 {\\, \\rm eV}$, and the Bayesian tension disappears rendering the\nnonlocal gravity model statistically equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM, given recent\nCMB+SNIa+BAO data. We also discuss constraints from growth rate measurements $f\n\\sigma_8$ whose fit is found to be improved by a larger massive neutrino\nfraction as well. The $\\nu$-extended nonlocal model also prefers a higher value\nof $H_0$ than $\\Lambda$CDM, therefore in better agreement with local\nmeasurements.\n", "  The application of numerical relativity to cosmological spacetimes is\nproviding new insights into the behavior of Einstein's equations, beyond common\napproximations. In order for simulations to be performed as accurately and\nefficiently as possible, we investigate a novel formulation of Einstein's\nequations. This formulation evolves differences from a \"reference\" solution\ndescribing the dominant behavior of the spacetime, which mitigates error due to\nboth truncation and approximate finite difference calculations. We find that\nthe error in solutions obtained using the reference formulation can be smaller\nby an order of magnitude or more, with the level of improvement depending on\nhow well the reference solution approximates the exact solution.\n", "  We list operators of the superpotential of the effective MSSM that emerges\nfrom the NMSGUT up to sextic degree. We give illustrative expressions for the\ncoefficients in terms of NMSGUT parameters. We also estimate the impact of GUT\nscale threshold corrections on these effective operators in view of the\ndemonstration that $B$ violation via quartic superpotential terms can be\nsuppressed to acceptable levels after including such corrections in the NMSGUT.\nWe find a novel $B, B-L$ violating quintic operator that leads to the decay\nmode $n\\to e^- K^+$. We also remark that the threshold corrections to the Type\nI seesaw mechanism make the deviation of right handed neutrino masses from the\nGUT scale more natural while Type II seesaw neutrino masses, which earlier\ntended to utterly negligible receive threshold enhancement. Our results are of\nrelevance for analyzing $B-L$ violating operator based, sphaleron safe,\nBaryogenesis.\n", "  The total correlations in a bipartite quantum system are measured by the\nquantum mutual information $\\mathcal{I}$, which consists of quantum discord and\nclassical correlation. However, recent results in quantum information shows\nthat coherence, which is a part of total correlation, is more general and more\nfundamental than discord. The role of coherence in quantum resource theories is\nworthwhile to investigate. We first study the relation between quantum discord\nand coherence by reducing the difference between them. And then, we consider\nthe dynamics of quantum discord, classical correlations and quantum coherence\nunder incoherent quantum channels. We discover that coherence indicate the\nbehavior of quantum discord (classical correlation) for times $t<\\bar t$, and\nindicate the decoherence of classical correlation (quantum discord) for times\n$t>\\bar t$. What is more, the coherence frozen and decay indicate the quantum\ndiscord and classical correlation frozen and decay respectively.\n", "  Hexagonal FeSe thin films were grown on SrTiO3 substrates and the temperature\nand thickness dependence of their electronic structures were studied. The\nhexagonal FeSe is found to be metallic and electron doped, whose Fermi surface\nconsists of six elliptical electron pockets. With decreased temperature, parts\nof the bands shift downward to high binding energy while some bands shift\nupwards to EF. The shifts of these bands begin around 300 K and saturate at low\ntemperature, indicating a magnetic phase transition temperature of about 300 K.\nWith increased film thickness, the Fermi surface topology and band structure\nshow no obvious change except some minor quantum size effect. Our paper reports\nthe first electronic structure of hexagonal FeSe, and shows that the possible\nmagnetic transition is driven by large scale electronic structure\nreconstruction.\n", "  Studying the molecular component of the interstellar medium in metal-poor\ngalaxies has been challenging because of the faintness of carbon monoxide\nemission, the most common proxy of H2. Here we present new detections of\nmolecular gas at low metallicities, and assess the physical conditions in the\ngas through various CO transitions for 8 galaxies. For one, NGC 1140 (Z/Zsun ~\n0.3), two detections of 13CO isotopologues and atomic carbon, [CI](1-0), and an\nupper limit for HCN(1-0) are also reported. After correcting to a common beam\nsize, we compared 12CO(2-1)/12CO(1-0) (R21) and 12CO(3-2)/12CO(1-0) (R31) line\nratios of our sample with galaxies from the literature and find that only NGC\n1140 shows extreme values (R21 ~ R31 ~ 2). Fitting physical models to the 12CO\nand 13CO emission in NGC 1140 suggests that the molecular gas is cool (kinetic\ntemperature Tkin<=20 K), dense (H2 volume density nH2 >= $10^6$ cm$^{-3}$),\nwith moderate CO column density (NCO ~ $10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$) and low filling\nfactor. Surprisingly, the [12CO]/[13CO] abundance ratio in NGC 1140 is very low\n(~ 8-20), lower even than the value of 24 found in the Galactic Center. The\nyoung age of the starburst in NGC 1140 precludes 13C enrichment from evolved\nintermediate-mass stars; instead we attribute the low ratio to charge-exchange\nreactions and fractionation, because of the enhanced efficiency of these\nprocesses in cool gas at moderate column densities. Fitting physical models to\n12CO and [CI](1-0) emission in NGC 1140 gives an unusually low [12CO]/[12C]\nabundance ratio, suggesting that in this galaxy atomic carbon is at least 10\ntimes more abundant than 12CO.\n", "  We construct the rings of generalized differential operators on the ${\\bf\nh}$-deformed vector space of ${\\bf gl}$-type. In contrast to the $q$-deformed\nvector space, where the ring of differential operators is unique up to an\nisomorphism, the general ring of ${\\bf h}$-deformed differential operators\n$\\operatorname{Diff}_{{\\bf h},\\sigma}(n)$ is labeled by a rational function\n$\\sigma$ in $n$ variables, satisfying an over-determined system of\nfinite-difference equations. We obtain the general solution of the system and\ndescribe some properties of the rings $\\operatorname{Diff}_{{\\bf\nh},\\sigma}(n)$.\n", "  We identify the differential cross sections for $t\\bar t$ production and the\ntotal cross section for Higgs production through gluon fusion as the processes\nin which the two effective operators describing the leading non-standard\ninteractions of the top quark with the gluon can be disentangled and studied in\nan independent fashion. Current data on the Higgs production and the $ {\\rm\nd}\\sigma/{\\rm d} {p^t_T}$ differential cross section provide limits comparable,\nbut not more stringent, than those from the total $t\\bar t$ cross sections\nmeasurements at the LHC and Tevatron, where however the two operators enter on\nthe same footing and can only be constrained together. Given the present\nuncertainties, we find that the most stringent bounds are provided by a\ncombination of data on the $t \\bar t$ total cross sections together with those\nfrom the Higgs production. We conclude by stating the (modest) reduction in the\nuncertainties necessary to provide more stringent limits by means of the Higgs\nproduction and $t\\bar t$ differential cross section observables at the LHC with\nthe future luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  This review provides a brief introduction to the physics of coupled\nexciton-plasmon systems, the theoretical description and experimental\nmanifestation of such phenomena, followed by an account of the state-of-the-art\nmethodology for the numerical simulations of such phenomena and supplemented by\na number of FORTRAN codes, by which the interested reader can introduce\nhimself/herself to the practice of such simulations. Applications to CW light\nscattering as well as transient response and relaxation are described.\nParticular attention is given to so-called strong coupling limit, where the\nhybrid exciton-plasmon nature of the system response is strongly expressed.\nWhile traditional descriptions of such phenomena usually rely on analysis of\nthe electromagnetic response of inhomogeneous dielectric environments that\nindividually support plasmon and exciton excitations, here we explore also the\nconsequences of a more detailed description of the molecular environment in\nterms of its quantum density matrix (applied in a mean field approximation\nlevel). Such a description makes it possible to account for characteristics\nthat cannot be described by the dielectric response model: the effects of\ndephasing on the molecular response on one hand, and nonlinear response on the\nother. It also highlights the still missing important ingredients in the\nnumerical approach, in particular its limitation to a classical description of\nthe radiation field and its reliance on a mean field description of the\nmany-body molecular system. We end our review with an outlook to the near\nfuture, where these limitations will be addressed and new novel applications of\nthe numerical approach will be pursued.\n", "  We reconsider a model introducing a scalar leptoquark $\\phi \\sim (\\mathbf{3},\n\\mathbf{1}, -1/3)$ to explain recent deviations from the standard model in\nsemileptonic $B$ decays. The leptoquark can accommodate the persistent tension\nin the decays $\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D^{(*)}\\tau \\bar{\\nu}$ as long as its mass is\nlower than approximately $10 \\text{ TeV}$, and we show that a sizeable Yukawa\ncoupling to the right-chiral tau lepton is necessary for an acceptable\nexplanation. Agreement with the measured $\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D^{(*)}\\tau\n\\bar{\\nu}$ rates is mildly compromised for parameter choices addressing the\ntensions in $b \\to s \\mu \\mu$, where the model can significantly reduce the\ndiscrepancies in angular observables, branching ratios and the\nlepton-flavor-universality observables $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. The leptoquark can\nalso reconcile the predicted and measured value of the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon and appears naturally in models of radiative neutrino mass\nderived from lepton-number violating effective operators. As a representative\nexample, we incorporate the particle into an existing two-loop neutrino mass\nscenario derived from a dimension-nine operator. In this specific model, the\nstructure of the neutrino mass matrix provides enough freedom to explain the\nsmall masses of the neutrinos in the region of parameter space dictated by\nagreement with the anomalies in $\\bar{B}\\rightarrow D^{(*)}\\tau \\bar{\\nu}$, but\nnot the $b \\to s$ transition. This is achieved without excessive fine-tuning in\nthe parameters important for neutrino mass.\n", "  Gamma ray lines are expected to be emitted as part of the afterglow of\nsupernova explosions, because radioactive decay of freshly synthesised nuclei\noccurs. Significant radioactive gamma ray line emission is expected from 56Ni\nand 44Ti decay on time scales of the initial explosion (56Ni, tau~days) and the\nyoung supernova remnant (44Ti,tau~90 years). Less specific, and rather\ninformative for the supernova population as a whole, are lessons from longer\nlived isotopes such as 26Al and 60Fe. From isotopes of elements heavier than\niron group elements, any interesting gamma-ray line emission is too faint to be\nobservable. Measurements with space-based gamma-ray telescopes have obtained\ninteresting gamma ray line emissions from two core collapse events, Cas A and\nSN1987A, and one thermonuclear event, SN2014J. We discuss INTEGRAL data from\nall above isotopes, including all line and continuum signatures from these two\nobjects, and the surveys for more supernovae, that have been performed by gamma\nray spectrometry. Our objective here is to illustrate what can be learned from\ngamma-ray line emission properties about the explosions and their astrophysics.\n", "  In contact with a superconductor, a normal metal modifies its properties due\nto Andreev reflection. In the current work, the local density of states (LDOS)\nof superconductor - normal metal Mo$_{78}$Ge$_{22}$ - Au bilayers are studied\nby means of STM applied from the Au side. Three bilayers have been prepared on\nsilicate glass substrate consisting of 100, 10 and 5 nm MoGe thin films covered\nalways by 5 nm Au layer. The tunneling spectra were measured at temperatures\nfrom 0.5 K to 7 K. The two-dimensional cross-correlation between topography and\nnormalized zero-bias conductance (ZBC) indicates a proximity effect between 100\nand 10 nm MoGe thin films and Au layer where a superconducting gap slightly\nsmaller than that of bulk MoGe is observed. The effect of the thinnest 5 nm\nMoGe layer on Au leads to much smaller gap moreover the LDOS reveals almost\ncompletely suppressed coherence peaks. This is attributed to a strong\npair-breaking effect of spin-flip processes at the interface between MoGe films\nand the substrate.\n", "  The fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) plus random phase approximation\n(RPA) based on Skyrme-type interaction is used to study the existence problem\nof proton semi-bubble structure in the $2_1^+$ state of $^{34}$Si. The\nexperimental excitation energy and the B(E2) strength of the $2_1^+$ state in\n$^{34}$Si can be reproduced quite well. The tensor effect is also studied. It\nis shown that the tensor interaction has a notable impact on the excitation\nenergy of the $2_1^+$ state and a small effect on the B(E2) value. Besides, its\neffect on the density distributions in the ground and $2_1^+$ state of\n$^{34}$Si is negligible. Our present results with T36 and T44 show that the\n$2_1^+$ state of $^{34}$Si is mainly caused by proton transiton from $\\pi\n1d_{5/2}$ orbit to $\\pi 2s_{1/2}$ orbit, and the existence of a proton\nsemi-bubble structure in this state is very unlikely.\n", "  Maintaining the synchronous motion of dynamical systems interacting on\ncomplex networks is often critical to their functionality. However, real-world\nnetworked dynamical systems operating synchronously are prone to random\nperturbations driving the system to arbitrary states within the corresponding\nbasin of attraction, thereby leading to epochs of desynchronized dynamics with\na priori unknown durations. Thus, it is highly relevant to have an estimate of\nthe duration of such transient phases before the system returns to synchrony,\nfollowing a random perturbation to the dynamical state of any particular node\nof the network. We address this issue here by proposing the framework of\n\\emph{single-node recovery time} (SNRT) which provides an estimate of the\nrelative time scales underlying the transient dynamics of the nodes of a\nnetwork during its restoration to synchrony. We utilize this in differentiating\nthe particularly \\emph{slow} nodes of the network from the relatively\n\\emph{fast} nodes, thus identifying the critical nodes which when perturbed\nlead to significantly enlarged recovery time of the system before resuming\nsynchronized operation. Further, we reveal explicit relationships between the\nSNRT values of a network, and its \\emph{global relaxation time} when starting\nall the nodes from random initial conditions. We employ the proposed concept\nfor deducing microscopic relationships between topological features of nodes\nand their respective SNRT values. The framework of SNRT is further extended to\na measure of resilience of the different nodes of a networked dynamical system.\nWe demonstrate the potential of SNRT in networks of R\\\"{o}ssler oscillators on\nparadigmatic topologies and a model of the power grid of the United Kingdom\nwith second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics illustrating the conceivable\npractical applicability of the proposed concept.\n", "  Recent LHCb results on $R_{K^*}$, the ratio of the branching fractions of $B\n\\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ to that of $B \\to K^* e^+ e^-$, for the dilepton invariant\nmass bins $q^2 \\equiv m_{\\ell\\ell}^2 = [0.045 - 1.1]$ GeV$^2$ and $[1.1 - 6]$\nGeV$^2$ show approximately $2.5 \\sigma$ deviations from the corresponding\nStandard Model prediction in each of the bins. This, when combined with the\nmeasurement of $R_K \\, (q^2=[1-6]\\, \\rm GeV^2)$, a similar ratio for the decay\nto a pseudo scalar meson, highly suggests for lepton non-universal new physics\nin semi-leptonic $B$ meson decays. In this work, we perform a model independent\nanalysis of these potential new physics signals and identify the operators that\ndo the best job in satisfying all these measurements. We show that heavy new\nphysics, giving rise to $q^2$ independent local 4-Fermi operators of scalar,\npseudo-scalar, vector or axial-vector type, is unable to explain all the three\nmeasurements simultaneously, in particular $R_{K^*}$ in the bin [0.045 - 1.1],\nwithin their experimental $1\\sigma$ regions. We point out the possibility to\nexplain $R_{K^*}$ in the low bin by an additional light ($\\lesssim 20 \\, \\rm\nMeV$) vector boson with appropriate coupling strengths to ($\\bar b \\, s$) and\n($\\bar e \\, e$).\n", "  Charged track multiplicity is among the most powerful observables for\ndiscriminating quark- from gluon-initiated jets. Despite its utility, it is not\ninfrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to\nstudying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe\nobservables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions\noften exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power\nis limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance\nexceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity.\n", "  Numerical simulations of magnetization reversal of a quantum uniaxial magnet\nunder a swept magnetic field [Hatomura, \\textit{et al}., \\textit{Quantum\nStoner-Wohlfarth Model}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{116}, 037203 (2016)] are\nextended. In particular, how the \"wave packet\" describing the time-evolution of\nthe system is scattered in the successive avoided level crossings is\ninvestigated from the viewpoint of the distribution of the eigenstate\npopulations. It is found that the peak of the distribution as a function of the\nmagnetic field does not depend on spin-size $S$, which indicates that the delay\nof magnetization reversal due to the finite sweeping rate is the same in both\nthe quantum and classical cases. The peculiar synchronized oscillations of all\nthe spin components result in the beating of the spin-length. Here, dissipative\neffects on this beating are studied by making use of the generalized\nLindblad-type master equation. The corresponding experimental situations are\nalso discussed in order to find conditions for experimental observations.\n", "  We propose a systematic programme to search for long-lived neutral particle\nsignatures through a minimal set of displaced searches requiring significant\nmissing transverse energy (dMETs).\n  Our approach is to extend the well-established dark matter simplified models\nto include displaced vertices. The dark matter simplified models are used to\ndescribe the primary production vertex. A displaced secondary vertex,\ncharacterised by the mass of the long-lived particle and its lifetime, is added\nfor the displaced signature. We show how these models can be motivated by, and\nmapped onto, complete models such as gauge-mediated SUSY breaking and models of\nneutral naturalness. We also outline how this approach may be used to extend\nother simplified models to incorporate displaced signatures and to characterise\nsearches for long-lived charged particles. Displaced vertices are a striking\nsignature with virtually no backgrounds from SM processes, and thus provide an\nexcellent target for the high-luminosity run of the Large Hadron Collider. The\nproposed models and searches provide a first step towards a systematic\nbroadening of the displaced dark matter search programme.\n", "  We extend one component Gross-Pitaevskii equation to two component coupled\ncase with the damping term, linear and parabolic density profiles, then give\nthe Lax pair and infinitely-many conservations laws of this coupled system. The\nsystem is nonautonomous, that is, it admits a nonisospectral linear eigenvalue\nproblem. In fact, the Darboux transformation for this kind of inhomogeneous\nsystem which is essentially different from the isospectral case, we reconstruct\nthe Darboux transformation for this coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Multi\nnonautonomous solitons, one breather and the first-order rogue wave are also\nobtained by the Darboux transformation. When $\\beta >0$, the amplitudes and\nvelocities of solitons decay exponentially as $t$ increases, otherwise, they\nincrease exponentially as $t$ increases. Meanwhile, the real part\n$Re(\\xi_j)$'s~$(j=1,2,3,\\dots)$ of new spectral parameters determine the\ndirection of solitions' propagation and $\\alpha$ affects the localization of\nsolitons. Choosing $Re(\\xi_1)=Re(\\xi_2)$, the two-soliton bound state is\nobtained. From nonzero background seed solutions, we construct one\nnonautonomous breather on curved background and find that this breather has\nsome deformations along the direction of $t$ due to the exponential decaying\nterm. Besides, $\\beta$ determines the degree of this curved background, if we\nset $\\beta>0$, the amplitude of the breather becomes small till being zero as\n$t$ increases. Through taking appropriate limit about the breather, the\nfirst-order rogue wave can be acquired. Finally, we give multi-component\ngeneralization of Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its Lax pair with\nnonisospectral parameter, meanwhile, Darboux transformation about this\nmulti-component generalization is also constructed.\n", "  We use an optical centrifuge to excite coherent rotational wave packets in\nN$_2$O, CS$_2$ and OCS molecules with rotational quantum numbers reaching up to\nJ=465, 690 and 1186, respectively. Time-resolved rotational spectroscopy at\nsuch ultra-high levels of rotational excitation can be used as a sensitive tool\nto probe the molecular potential energy surface at inter-nuclear distances far\nfrom their equilibrium values. Significant bond stretching in the centrifuged\nmolecules results in the growing period of the rotational revivals, which are\nexperimentally detected using coherent Raman scattering. We measure the revival\nperiod as a function of the centrifuge-induced rotational frequency and compare\nit with the numerical calculations based on the known Morse-cosine potentials.\n", "  Self-powered motion in catalytic colloidal particles provides a compelling\nexample of active matter, i.e. systems that engage in single-particle and\ncollective behavior far from equilibrium. The long-time, long-distance behavior\nof such systems is of particular interest, since it connects their individual\nmicro-scale behavior to macro-scale phenomena. In such analyses, it is\nimportant to distinguish motion due to subtle advective effects -- which also\nhas long time scales and length scales -- from phenomena that derive from\nintrinsically powered motion. Here, we develop a methodology to analyze the\nstatistical properties of the translational and rotational motions of powered\ncolloids to distinguish, for example, active chemotaxis from passive advection\nby bulk flow.\n", "  Complex networks are usually characterized in terms of their topological,\nspatial, or information-theoretic properties and combinations of the associated\nmetrics are used to discriminate networks into different classes or categories.\nHowever, even with the present variety of characteristics at hand it still\nremains a subject of current research to appropriately quantify a network's\ncomplexity and correspondingly discriminate between different types of complex\nnetworks, like infrastructure or social networks, on such a basis. Here, we\nexplore the possibility to classify complex networks by means of a statistical\ncomplexity measure that has formerly been successfully applied to distinguish\ndifferent types of chaotic and stochastic time series. It is composed of a\nnetwork's averaged per-node entropic measure characterizing the network's\ninformation content and the associated Jenson-Shannon divergence as a measure\nof disequilibrium. We study 29 real world networks and show that networks of\nthe same category tend to cluster in distinct areas of the resulting\ncomplexity-entropy plane. We demonstrate that within our framework, connectome\nnetworks exhibit among the highest complexity while, e.g, transportation and\ninfrastructure networks display significantly lower values. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to families of random\nscale-free and Watts-Strogatz model networks. We then show in a second\napplication that the proposed framework is useful to objectively construct\nthreshold-based networks, such as functional climate networks or recurrence\nnetworks, by choosing the threshold such that the statistical network\ncomplexity is maximized.\n", "  For the search for charginos and neutralinos in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses of these\nparticles an accurate knowledge of their production and decay properties is\nmandatory. We evaluate the cross sections for the chargino and neutralino\nproduction at e+e- colliders in the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The\nevaluation is based on a full one-loop calculation of the production mechanisms\ne+e- -> cha_c cha_c' and e+e- -> neu_n neu_n', including soft and hard photon\nradiation. We mostly restricted ourselves to a version of our renormalization\nscheme which is valid for |M_1| < |M_2|, |mu| and M_2 != mu to simplify the\nanalysis, even though we are able to switch to other parameter regions and\ncorrespondingly different renormalization schemes. The dependence of the\nchargino/neutralino cross sections on the relevant cMSSM parameters is analyzed\nnumerically. We find sizable contributions to many production cross sections.\nThey amount roughly 10-20% of the tree-level results, but can go up to 40% or\nhigher in extreme cases. Also the complex phase dependence of the one-loop\ncorrections was found non-negligible. The full one-loop contributions are thus\ncrucial for physics analyses at a future linear e+e- collider such as the ILC\nor CLIC.\n", "  Using diagrammatic techniques, we provide explicit functional relations\nbetween the cumulant generating functions for the biunitarily invariant\nensembles in the limit of large size of matrices. The formalism allows to map\ntwo distinct areas of free random variables: Hermitian positive definite\noperators and non-normal R-diagonal operators. We also rederive the\nHaagerup-Larsen theorem and show how its recent extension to the eigenvector\ncorrelation function appears naturally within this approach.\n", "  The clockwork mechanism is a means of naturally generating exponential\nhierarchies in theories without significant hierarchies among fundamental\nparameters. We emphasize the role of interactions in the clockwork mechanism,\ndemonstrating that clockwork is an intrinsically abelian phenomenon precluded\nin non-abelian theories such as Yang-Mills, non-linear sigma models, and\ngravity. We also show that clockwork is not realized in extra-dimensional\ntheories through purely geometric effects, but may be generated by appropriate\nlocalization of zero modes.\n", "  We study the equation of state of QCD using an improved version of the\nthree-flavor Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model beyond the mean-field\napproximation. It incorporates the effects of unquenched quarks into the\nPolyakov-loop effective potential, as well as mesonic contributions to the\ngrand-canonical potential. We study in full detail the calculation of the\nthermodynamical potential in this approach and compare the resulting pressure\nand entropy density with the most-recent lattice-QCD calculations at zero\nbaryochemical potential. Finally, we present some exploratory results at finite\nchemical potential which include the phase diagram of the model, the quark and\nmeson masses, and finally, the thermodynamical pressure.\n", "  The charge transport in a dirty 2-dimensional electron system biased in the\npresence of a lateral potential barrier under magnetic field is theoretically\nstudied. The quantum tunneling across the barrier provides the quantum\ninterference of the edge states localized on its both sides that results in\ngiant oscillations of the charge current flowing perpendicular to the lateral\njunction. Our theoretical analysis is in a good agreement with the experimental\nobservations presented in Ref.8. In particular, positions of the conductance\nmaxima coincide with the Landau levels while the conductance itself is\nessentially suppressed even at the energies at which the resonant tunneling\noccurs and hence these puzzling observations can be resolved without taking\ninto account the electron-electron interaction.\n", "  The largest global symmetry that can be made local in the Standard Model +\n3$\\nu_R$ while being compatible with Pati-Salam unification is $SU(3)_H\\times\nU(1)_{B-L}$. The gauge bosons of this theory would induce flavour effects\ninvolving both quarks and leptons, and are a potential candidate to explain the\nrecent reports of lepton universality violation in rare B meson decays. In this\nletter we characterise this type of models and show how they can accommodate\nthe data and naturally be within reach of direct searches.\n", "  We compute genus two partition functions in two dimensional conformal field\ntheories at large central charge, focusing on surfaces that give the third\nRenyi entropy of two intervals. We compute this for generalized free theories\nand for symmetric orbifolds, and compare it to the result in pure gravity. We\nfind a new phase transition if the theory contains a light operator of\ndimension $\\Delta\\leq0.19$. This means in particular that unlike the second\nRenyi entropy, the third one is no longer universal.\n", "  Gravitational waves encode invaluable information about the nature of the\nrelatively unexplored extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational\ninteraction is strong, non-linear and highly dynamical. Recent gravitational\nwave observations by advanced LIGO have provided the first glimpses into this\nregime, allowing for the extraction of new inferences on different aspects of\ntheoretical physics. For example, these detections provide constraints on the\nmass of the graviton, Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector, the\nexistence of large extra dimensions, the temporal variability of Newton's\ngravitational constant, and modified dispersion relations of gravitational\nwaves. Many of these constraints, however, are not yet competitive with\nconstraints obtained, for example, through Solar System observations or binary\npulsar observations. In this paper, we study the degree to which theoretical\nphysics inferences drawn from gravitational wave observations will strengthen\nwith detections from future detectors. We consider future ground-based\ndetectors, such as the LIGO-class expansions A+, Voyager, Cosmic Explorer and\nthe Einstein Telescope, as well as various configurations the space-based\ndetector LISA. We find that space-based detectors will place constraints on\nGeneral Relativity up to 12 orders of magnitude more stringently than current\naLIGO bounds, but these space-based constraints are comparable to those\nobtained with the ground-based Cosmic Explorer or the Einstein Telescope. We\nalso generically find that improvements in the instrument sensitivity band at\nlow frequencies lead to large improvements in certain classes of constraints,\nwhile sensitivity improvements at high frequencies lead to more modest gains.\nThese results strengthen the case for the development of future detectors,\nwhile providing additional information that could be useful in future design\ndecisions.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a spinor polariton condensate under nonresonant\npumping, based on driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equations coupled to the\nrate equation of a spin-unpolarized reservoir. We find the homogeneous\npolariton condensate can transit from the spin-unpolarized phase, where it is\nlinearly polarized, to the spin-polarized phase, where it is elliptically\npolarized, depending on the cross-spin versus same-spin interactions and the\nlinear polarization splitting. In both phases, we study elementary excitations\nusing Bogoliubov approach, in a regime where the decay rate of total exciton\ndensity in reservoir crosses over from the slow to the fast limit. Depending on\nreservoir parameters, the global-phase mode can be either diffusive or gapped.\nBy contrast, the relative-phase mode always possesses a gapped energy, undamped\nin the spin-unpolarized phase but weakly damped in the spin-polarized phase. In\nthe spin-unpolarized phase, both modes are linearly polarized despite pumping\nand decay. However, in the spin-polarized phase, the mode polarization can be\nsignificantly affected by the reservoir and depends strongly on the circular\npolarization degree of the condensate. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the\n`ghost' branch of the Bogoliubov spectrum of the relative-phase mode can be\nvisualized in the photoluminescence emission, distinguishable from that of the\nglobal-phase mode and thus allowing for experimental observation, when the\nspinor polariton condensate is elliptically polarized.\n", "  We present Monte Carlo (MC) simulation studies of phase separation in binary\n(AB) mixtures with bond-disorder that is introduced in two different ways: (i)\nat randomly selected lattice sites and (ii) at regularly selected sites. The\nIsing model with spin exchange (Kawasaki) dynamics represents the segregation\nkinetics in conserved binary mixtures. We find that the dynamical scaling\nchanges significantly by varying the number of disordered sites in the case\nwhere bond-disorder is introduced at the randomly selected sites. On the other\nhand, when we introduce the bond-disorder in a regular fashion, the system\nfollows the dynamical scaling for the modest number of disordered sites. For\nhigher number of disordered sites, the evolution morphology illustrates a\nlamellar pattern formation. Our MC results are consistent with the\nLifshitz-Slyozov (LS) power-law growth in all the cases.\n", "  Tunneling of electrons through a barrier with complex potential is\ninvestigated. We focus on two cases, symmetric double rectangular barrier and\ndouble delta potential barrier, and give expressions for resonant transmission\nprobability for both cases. Expressions for reflection amplitude and absorption\nare also obtained in the case of delta potential. It will be shown that for\ngiven dimensions of the potential barrier and the real part of the potential,\nresonant transmission probability approaches infinity for only one positive\nvalue of the imaginary part of the potential.\n", "  We present a detailed analytic study on the three-dimensional sphere of the\nmost popular candidates for $C$-functions, both for Dirac and scalar free\nmassive fields. We discuss to which extent the effective action, the R\\'enyi\nentanglement entropy and the renormalized entanglement entropy fulfill the\nconditions expected from $C$-functions. In view of the absence of a good\ncandidate in the case of the scalar field, we introduce a new candidate, which\nwe call the modified effective action, and analyze its pros and cons.\n", "  We discuss the application of the Agapito Curtarolo and Buongiorno Nardelli\n(ACBN0) pseudo-hybrid Hubbard density functional to several transition metal\noxides. ACBN0 is a fast, accurate and parameter-free alternative to traditional\nDFT+$U$ and hybrid exact exchange methods. In ACBN0, the Hubbard energy of\nDFT+$U$ is calculated via the direct evaluation of the local Coulomb and\nexchange integrals in which the screening of the bare Coulomb potential is\naccounted for by a renormalization of the density matrix. We demonstrate the\nsuccess of the ACBN0 approach for the electronic properties of a series\ntechnologically relevant mono-oxides (MnO, CoO, NiO, FeO, both at equilibrium\nand under pressure). We also present results on two mixed valence compounds,\nCo$_3$O$_4$ and Mn$_3$O$_4$. Our results, obtained at the computational cost of\na standard LDA/PBE calculation, are in excellent agreement with hybrid\nfunctionals, the GW approximation and experimental measurements.\n", "  The Poincar\\'e invariance of GR is usually interpreted as Lorentz invariance\nplus diffeomorphism invariance. In this paper, by introducing the local\ninertial coordinates (LIC), it is shown that a theory with Lorentz and\ndiffeomorphism invariance is not necessarily Poincar\\'e invariant. Actually,\nthe energy-momentum conservation is violated there. On the other hand, with the\nhelp of the LIC, the Poincar\\'e invariance is reinterpreted as an internal\nsymmetry. In this formalism, the conservation law is derived, which has not\nbeen sufficiently explored before.\n", "  Application of the phase modulated pulsed light for advance spectroscopic\nmeasurements is the area of growing interest. The phase modulation of the light\ncauses modulation of the signal. Separation of the spectral components of the\nmodulations allows to distinguish the contributions of various interaction\npathways. The lasers with high repetition rate used in such experiments can\nlead to appearance of the accumulation effects, which become especially\npronounced in systems with long-living excited states. Recently it was shown,\nthat such accumulation effects can be used to evaluate parameters of the\ndynamical processes in the material. In this work we demonstrate that the\naccumulation effects are also important in the quantum characteristics\nmeasurements provided by modulation spectroscopy. In particular, we consider a\nmodel of quantum two-level system driven by a train of phase-modulated light\npulses, organised in analogy with the 2D spectroscopy experiments. We evaluate\nthe harmonics' amplitudes in the fluorescent signal and calculate corrections\nappearing from the accumulation effects. We show that the corrections can be\nsignificant and have to be taken into account at analysis of experimental data.\n", "  Field patterns, first proposed by the authors in [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc\nA. 2017], are orderly patterns of characteristic lines that arise in specific\nspace-time microstructures whose geometry in one spatial dimension plus time is\nsomehow commensurate to the slope of the characteristic lines. In particular,\nin [Milton, Mattei. Proc R Soc A. 2017] the authors propose two examples of\nspace-time geometries in which field patterns occur: they are two-phase\nmicrostructures in which rectangular space-time inclusions of one material are\nembedded in another material. After a sufficient large period of time, the\nfield patterns in both microstructures have local periodicity both in time and\nspace, due to the PT-symmetry of the chosen space-time geometries. This allows\none to focus only on solving the problem on a discrete network and to define a\nsuitable transfer matrix that, given the solution at a certain time, provides\nthe solution after one time period. Many of the eigenvalues of this transfer\nmatrix have unit norm and hence the corresponding eigenvectors correspond to\npropagating modes. However, there are also modes that blow up exponentially\nwith time coupled with modes that decrease exponentially with time. The\nquestion as to whether there are space-time microstructures such that the\ntransfer matrix only has eigenvalues on the unit circle finds answer in this\npaper where we see that certain space-time checkerboards have the property that\nall the modes are propagating modes, within a certain range of the material\nparameters. Interestingly, when there is no blow-up, the waves generated by an\ninstantaneous disturbance at a point look like shocks with a wake of\noscillatory waves. This sets an arrow of time in the sense that it would be\nextremely difficult to produce the initial conditions necessary to create the\ncorresponding time-reversed waves.\n", "  We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a cellular automaton with\na von Neumann neighborhood of range one to be number-conserving. The conditions\nare formulated for any dimension and for any set of states containing zero. The\nuse of the geometric structure of the von Neumann neighborhood allows for\ncomputationally tractable conditions even in higher dimensions.\n", "  We study the Andreev reflections (ARs) at the interface of the type-II Weyl\nsemimetal-superconductor junctions and find double ARs when the superconductor\nis put in the Weyl semimetal band tilting direction, which is similar to the\ndouble reflections of light in anisotropic crystals. The directions of the\ndouble (retro and specular) ARs are symmetric about the normal due to the\nhyperboloidal Fermi surface near the Weyl nodes, but with different AR\namplitudes depending on the direction and energy of the incident electron. When\nthe normal direction of the Weyl semimetal-superconductor interface is changed\nfrom parallel to perpendicular with the tilt direction, the double ARs\ngradually evolve from one retro-AR and one specular AR, passing through double\nretro-ARs, one specular AR and one retro-AR, into one retro AR and one normal\nreflection, resulting in an anisotropic conductance which can be observed in\nexperiments.\n", "  Recent work on a family of boson-fermion mappings has emphasized the\ninterplay of symmetry and duality: Phases related by a particle-vortex duality\nof bosons (fermions) are related by time-reversal symmetry in their fermionic\n(bosonic) formulation. We present exact mappings for a number of concrete\nmodels that make this property explicit on the operator level. We illustrate\nthe approach with one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models, and then\nsimilarly explore the duality web of complex bosons and Dirac fermions in (2+1)\ndimensions.\n", "  Fostered by the possibilities of multi-dimensional computational modeling, in\nparticular the advent of three-dimensional (3D) simulations, our understanding\nof the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (SNe)\nhas experienced remarkable progress over the past decade. First\nself-consistent, first-principle models have shown successful explosions in 3D,\nand even failed cases may be cured by moderate changes of the microphysics\ninside the neutron star (NS), better grid resolution, or more detailed\nprogenitor conditions at the onset of core collapse, in particular large-scale\nperturbations in the convective Si and O burning shells. 3D simulations have\nalso achieved to follow neutrino-driven explosions continuously from the\ninitiation of the blast wave, through the shock breakout from the progenitor\nsurface, into the radioactively powered evolution of the SN, and towards the\nfree expansion phase of the emerging remnant. Here we present results from such\nsimulations, which form the basis for direct comparisons with observations of\nSNe and SN remnants in order to derive constraints on the still disputed\nexplosion mechanism. It is shown that predictions based on hydrodynamic\ninstabilities and mixing processes associated with neutrino-driven explosions\nyield good agreement with measured NS kicks, light-curve properties of SN\n1987A, and asymmetries of iron and 44Ti distributions observed in SN 1987A and\nCassiopeia A.\n", "  Deep narrow-band HST imaging of the iconic spiral galaxy M101 has revealed\nover a thousand new Wolf Rayet (WR) candidates. We report spectrographic\nconfirmation of 10 HeII emission line sources hosting 15 WR stars. We find WR\nstars present at both sub- and super-solar metalicities with WC stars favouring\nmore metal-rich regions compared to WN stars. We investigate the association of\nWR stars with HII regions using archival HST imaging and conclude that the\nmajority of WR stars are in or associated with HII regions. Of the 10 emission\nlines sources, only one appears to be unassociated with a star-forming region.\nOur spectroscopic survey provides confidence that our narrow-band photometric\ncandidates are in fact bonafide WR stars, which will allow us to characterise\nthe progenitors of any core-collapse supernovae that erupt in the future in\nM101.\n", "  The adiabatic theorem and \"shortcuts to adiabaticity\" for the adiabatic\ndynamics of time-dependent decoherence-free subspaces are explored in this\npaper. Starting from the definition of the dynamical stable decoherence-free\nsubspaces, we show that, under a compact adiabatic condition, the quantum state\nfollows time-dependent decoherence-free subspaces (the adiabatic decoherence\nfree subspaces) into the target subspace with extremely high purity, even\nthough the dynamics of the quantum system may be non-adiabatic. The adiabatic\ncondition mentioned in the adiabatic theorem is very similar with the adiabatic\ncondition for closed quantum systems, except that the operators required to be\n\"slowness\" is on the Lindblad operators. We also show that the adiabatic\ndecoherence-free subspaces program depends on the existence of instantaneous\ndecoherence-free subspaces, which requires that the Hamiltonian of open quantum\nsystems has to be engineered according to the incoherent control program.\nBesides, \"the shortcuts to adiabaticity\" for the adiabatic decoherence-free\nsubspaces program is also presented based on the transitionless quantum driving\nmethod. Finally, we provide an example of physical systems that support our\nprograms. Our approach employs Markovian master equations and applies primarily\nto finite-dimensional quantum systems.\n", "  We study a system of particles which jump on the sites of the interval\n$[1,L]$ of $\\mathbb Z$. The density at the boundaries is kept fixed to simulate\nthe action of mass reservoirs. The evolution depends on two parameters\n$\\lambda'\\ge 0$ and $\\lambda\"\\ge 0$ which are the strength of an external\npotential and respectively of an attractive potential among the particles. When\n$\\lambda'=\\lambda\"= 0$ the system behaves diffusively and the density profile\nof the final stationary state is linear, Fick's law is satisfied. When\n$\\lambda'> 0$ and $\\lambda\"= 0$ the system models the diffusion of carbon in\nthe presence of silicon as in the Darken experiment: the final state of the\nsystem is in qualitative agreement with the experimental one and uphill\ndiffusion is present at the weld. Finally if $\\lambda'=0$ and $\\lambda\">0$ is\nsuitably large, the system simulates a vapor-liquid phase transition and we\nhave a surprising phenomenon. Namely when the densities in the reservoirs\ncorrespond respectively to metastable vapor and metastable liquid we find a\nfinal stationary current which goes uphill from the reservoir with smaller\ndensity (vapor) to that with larger density (liquid). Our results are mainly\nnumerical, we have convincing theoretical explanations yet we miss a complete\nmathematical proof.\n", "  We describe a large family of nonequilibrium steady states (NESS)\ncorresponding to forced flows over obstacles. The spatial structure at large\ndistances from the obstacle is shown to be universal, and can be quantitatively\ncharacterised in terms of certain collective modes of the strongly coupled many\nbody system, which we define in this work. In holography, these modes are\nspatial analogues of quasinormal modes, which are known to be responsible for\nuniversal aspects of relaxation of time dependent systems. These modes can be\nboth hydrodynamical or non-hydrodynamical in origin. The decay lengths of the\nhydrodynamic modes are set by $\\eta/s$, the shear viscosity over entropy\ndensity ratio, suggesting a new route to experimentally measuring this ratio.\nWe also point out a new class of nonequilibrium phase transitions, across which\nthe spatial structure of the NESS undergoes a dramatic change, characterised by\nthe properties of the spectrum of these spatial collective modes.\n", "  We study the Dark Matter (DM) discovery prospect and its spin discrimination\nin the theoretical framework of gauge invariant and renormalizable Higgs portal\nDM models at the ILC with $\\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV. In such models, the DM pair is\nproduced in association with a $Z$ boson. In case the singlet scalar DM, the\nmediator is just the SM Higgs boson, whereas for the fermion or vector DM there\nis an additional singlet scalar mediator that mixes with the SM Higgs boson,\nwhich produces significant observable differences. After careful investigation\nof the signal and backgrounds both at parton level and at detector level, we\nfind the signal with hadronically decaying $Z$ boson provides a better search\nsensitivity than the signal with leptonically decaying $Z$ boson. Taking the\nfermion DM model as a benchmark scenario, when the DM-mediator coupling\n$g_\\chi$ is relatively small, the DM signals are discoverable only for\nbenchmark points with relatively light scalar mediator $H_2$. And the spin\ndiscriminating from scalar DM is always promising while it is difficult to\ndiscriminate from vector DM. As for $g_\\chi$ approaching the perturbative\nlimit, benchmark points with the mediator $H_2$ in the full mass region of\ninterest are discoverable. And the spin discriminating from both the scalar and\nfermion DM are quite promising.\n", "  An intriguing phenomenon in topological semimetals and topological insulators\nis the negative magnetoresistance (MR) observed when a magnetic field is\napplied along the current direction. A prevailing understanding to the negative\nMR in topological semimetals is the chiral anomaly, which, however, is not well\ndefined in topological insulators. We calculate the MR of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator, by using the semiclassical equations of motion, in which\nthe Berry curvature explicitly induces an anomalous velocity and orbital\nmoment. Our theoretical results are in quantitative agreement with the\nexperiments. The negative MR is not sensitive to temperature and increases as\nthe Fermi energy approaches the band edge. The orbital moment and g factors\nalso play important roles in the negative MR. Our results give a reasonable\nexplanation to the negative MR in 3D topological insulators and will be helpful\nin understanding the anomalous quantum transport in topological states of\nmatter.\n", "  The most popular and widely used subtract-with-borrow generator, also known\nas RANLUX, is reimplemented as a linear congruential generator using large\ninteger arithmetic with the modulus size of 576 bits. Modern computers, as well\nas the specific structure of the modulus inferred from RANLUX, allow for the\ndevelopment of a fast modular multiplication -- the core of the procedure. This\nwas previously believed to be slow and have too high cost in terms of computing\nresources. Our tests show a significant gain in generation speed which is\ncomparable with other fast, high quality random number generators. An\nadditional feature is the fast skipping of generator states leading to a\nseeding scheme which guarantees the uniqueness of random number sequences.\n", "  In tunnel junctions between ferromagnets and heavy elements with strong spin\norbit coupling the magnetoresistance is often dominated by tunneling\nanisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). This makes conventional DC spin injection\ntechniques impractical for determining the spin relaxation time ($\\tau_s$).\nHere, we show that this obstacle for measurements of $\\tau_s$ can be overcome\nby 2nd harmonic spin-injection-magnetoresistance (SIMR). In the 2nd harmonic\nsignal the SIMR is comparable in magnitude to TAMR, thus enabling Hanle-induced\nSIMR as a powerful tool to directly determine $\\tau_s$. Using this approach we\ndetermined the spin relaxation time of Pt and Ta and their temperature\ndependences. The spin relaxation in Pt seems to be governed by Elliott-Yafet\nmechanism due to a constant resistivity $\\times$spin relaxation time product\nover a wide temperature range.\n", "  We report on a new time-resolved analysis of the GRB 090926A broad-band\nspectrum during its prompt phase, and on its interpretation in the framework of\nprompt emission models. We characterize the high-energy extra component of GRB\n090926A using Pass 8 data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), which\noffer a greater sensitivity than any data set used in previous studies of this\nburst, particularly in the 30-100 MeV energy band. Then, we combine the LAT\ndata with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) in joint spectral fits in\norder to characterize the time evolution of the broad-band spectrum from keV to\nGeV energies. Careful attention is paid to the LAT systematic effects. Finally,\nwe perform a temporal analysis of the light curves and we compute the\nvariability time scales during and after the bright spike at ~10 s\npost-trigger. Our analysis confirms and better constrains the spectral break in\nthe high-energy extra component, which has been previously reported during the\nbright spike. Furthermore, it reveals that the spectral attenuation persists at\nlater times, with an increase of the break characteristic energy up to the GeV\ndomain until the end of the prompt phase. We interpret the high-energy spectral\nbreak as caused by photon opacity to pair creation. Requiring that all\nemissions are produced above the photosphere of GRB 090926A, we compute the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the outflow, $\\Gamma$. The latter decreases from 230\nduring the spike to 100 at the end of the prompt emission. Assuming, instead,\nthat the spectral break reflects the natural curvature of the inverse Compton\nspectrum, lower limits corresponding to larger values of $\\Gamma$ are also\nderived. Combined with the extreme temporal variability of GRB 090926A, these\nLorentz factors lead to emission radii $R\\sim10^{14}$ cm which are consistent\nwith an internal origin of both the keV-MeV and GeV prompt emissions.\n", "  We show that, in all metric theories of gravity with a general covariant\naction, gravity couples to the gravitational energy-momentum tensor in the same\nway it couples to the matter energy-momentum tensor order by order in the weak\nfield approximation around flat spacetime. We discuss the relation of this\nproperty to the Strong Equivalence Principle. We also study the gauge\ntransformation properties of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor.\n", "  For passive electromagnetic scatterers, we explore a variety of extreme\nlimits on directional scattering patterns in phase diagram, regardless of\ndetails on the geometric configurations and material properties. By\ndemonstrating the extinction cross-sections with the power conservation\nintrinsically embedded in phase diagram, we give an alternative interpretation\nfor Kerker first and second conditions, associated with zero backward\nscattering (ZBS) and nearly zero forward scattering (NZFS). The physical\nboundary and limitation for these directional radiations are illustrated, along\nwith a generalized Kerker condition with implicit parameters. By taking the\ndispersion relations of gold-silicon core-shell nanoparticles into account,\nbased on the of phase diagram, we reveal the realistic parameters to\nexperimentally implement ZBS and NZFS at optical frequencies.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are diffuse extended sources characterized by a\ncomplex morphology and a non-uniform distribution of ejecta. Such a morphology\nreflects pristine structures and features of the progenitor supernova (SN) and\nthe early interaction of the SN blast wave with the inhomogeneous circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). Deciphering the observations of SNRs might open the possibility\nto investigate the physical properties of both the interacting ejecta and the\nshocked CSM. This requires accurate numerical models which describe the\nevolution from the SN explosion to the remnant development and which connect\nthe emission properties of the remnants to the progenitor SNe. Here we show how\nmulti-dimensional SN-SNR hydrodynamic models have been very effective in\ndeciphering observations of SNR Cassiopeia A and SN 1987A, thus unveiling the\nstructure of ejecta in the immediate aftermath of the SN explosion and\nconstraining the 3D pre-supernova structure and geometry of the environment\nsurrounding the progenitor SN.\n", "  The Lax representation for different matrix generalizations of Short Pulse\nEquations (SPE) is considered. The four-dimensional Lax representations of\nfour-component Matsuno, Feng and Dimakis-M\\\"{u}ller-Hoissen-Matsuno equations\nis obtained. The four-component Feng system is defined by generalization of the\ntwo-dimensional Lax representation to the four-component case. This system\nreduces to the original Feng equation or to the two-component Matsuno equation\nor to the Yao-Zang equation. The three component version of Feng equation is\npresented.\n  The four-component version of Matsuno equation with its Lax representation is\ngiven .\n  This equation reduces the new two-component Feng system.\n  The two-component Dimakis-M\\\"{u}ller-Hoissen-Matsuno equations are\ngeneralized to the four parameter family of the four-component SPE. The\nbi-Hamiltonian structure of this generalization, for special values of\nparameters, is defined. This four-component SPE in special case reduces to the\nnew two-component SPE.\n", "  We develop general counting formulae for primary fields in free four\ndimensional (4D) scalar conformal field theory (CFT). Using a duality map\nbetween primary operators in scalar field theory and multi-variable polynomial\nfunctions subject to differential constraints, we identify a sector of\nholomorphic primary fields corresponding to polynomial functions on a class of\npermutation orbifolds. These orbifolds have palindromic Hilbert series, which\nindicates they are Calabi-Yau. We construct the top-dimensional holomorphic\nform expected from the Calabi-Yau property. This sector includes and extends\nprevious constructions of infinite families of primary fields. We sketch the\ngeneralization of these results to free 4D vector and matrix CFTs.\n", "  In this note we report two versions of Gilbert-Varshamov type existential\nbounds for asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes.\n", "  To understand the formation and evolution of the different stellar\npopulations within our Galaxy it is essential to combine detailed kinematical\nand chemical information for large samples of stars. We derive chemical\nabundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu for a large sample of more\nthan 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution ($R \\sim$\\,115000) and\nhigh-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are derived by\na standard Local Thermodinamyc Equilibrium (LTE) analysis using measured\nEquivalent Widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9\natmospheres. We find that thick disk stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and\nEu and also show on average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y when compared to the\nthin disk stars. We also discovered that the previously identified\nhigh-$\\alpha$ metal-rich population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd and Eu with\nrespect to the thin disk but presents Ba and Y abundances lower on average,\nfollowing the trend of thick disk stars towards higher metallities and further\nsupporting the different chemical composition of this population. The ratio of\nheavy-s to light-s elements of thin disk stars presents the expected behaviour\n(increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be explained by a major\ncontribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process production at disk\nmetallicities. However, the opposite trend found for thick disk stars suggests\nthat intermediate-mass AGB stars played an important role in the enrichment of\nthe gas from where these stars formed. Previous works in the literature also\npoint to a possible primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities\nto explain this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements\nin the thin disk at super solar metallicities which could be caused by the\ncontribution of metal-rich AGB stars. (short version)\n", "  We review instrumentation for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in zero and\nultra-low magnetic field (ZULF, below 0.1 $\\mu$T) where detection is based on a\nlow-cost, non-cryogenic, spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) $^{87}$Rb atomic\nmagnetometer. The typical sensitivity is 20-30 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ for signal\nfrequencies below 1 kHz and NMR linewidths range from Hz all the way down to\ntens of mHz. These features enable precision measurements of chemically\ninformative nuclear spin-spin couplings as well as nuclear spin precession in\nultra-low magnetic fields.\n", "  Within gauge/gravity duality, we consider the local quench-like time\nevolution obtained by joining two 1+1-dimensional heat baths at different\ntemperatures at time t=0. A steady state forms and expands in space. For the\n2+1-dimensional gravity dual, we find that the shockwaves expanding the\nsteady-state region are of spacelike nature in the bulk despite being null at\nthe boundary. However, they do not transport information. Moreover, by adapting\nthe time-dependent Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi prescription, we holographically\ncalculate the entanglement entropy and also the mutual information for\ndifferent entangling regions. For general temperatures, we find that the\nentanglement entropy increase rate satisfies the same bound as in the\n\"entanglement tsunami\" setups. For small temperatures of the two baths, we\nderive an analytical formula for the time dependence of the entanglement\nentropy. This replaces the entanglement tsunami-like behaviour seen for high\ntemperatures. Finally, we check that strong subadditivity holds in this\ntime-dependent system, as well as further more general entanglement\ninequalities for five or more regions recently derived for the static case.\n", "  In Poincare gauge theory of gravity, in addition to mass-energy content, spin\nis also a source for gravitational interactions. Although the effects of spin\nare negligible at low energies, they can play a crucial role at very early\nuniverse when the spin density was very high. In this paper by choosing a\nsuitable Lagrangian for Poincare gauge theory of gravity, and suitable\nenergy-momentum and spin density tensors, we show that the effects of spin and\ntorsion can lead to a inflationary phase without the need for any additional\nfields. No fine tuning of parameters is required in this setup. We also\ncalculate the scalar spectral index at the end of inflation and show that it\nagrees with the most recent observational data.\n", "  We consider stability in a class of random non-linear dynamical systems\ncharacterised by a relaxation rate together with a Gaussian random vector field\nwhich is white-in-time and spatial homogeneous and isotropic. We will show that\nin the limit of large dimension there is a stability-complexity phase\ntransition analogue to the so-called May-Wigner transition known from linear\nmodels. Our approach uses an explicit derivation of a stochastic description of\nthe finite-time Lyapunov exponents. These exponents are given as a system of\ncoupled Brownian motions with hyperbolic repulsion called geometric Dyson\nBrownian motions. We compare our results with known models from the literature.\n", "  We present the mathematical model of decision making (DM) of agents acting in\na complex and uncertain environment (combining huge variety of economical,\nfinancial, behavioral, and geo-political factors). To describe interaction of\nagents with it, we apply the formalism of quantum field theory (QTF). Quantum\nfields are of the purely informational nature. The QFT-model can be treated as\na far relative of the expected utility theory, where the role of utility is\nplayed by adaptivity to an environment (bath). However, this sort of\nutility-adaptivity cannot be represented simply as a numerical function. The\noperator representation in Hilbert space is used and adaptivity is described as\nin quantum dynamics. We are especially interested in stabilization of solutions\nfor sufficiently large time. The outputs of this stabilization process,\nprobabilities for possible choices, are treated in the framework of classical\nDM. To connect classical and quantum DM, we appeal to Quantum Bayesianism\n(QBism). We demonstrate the quantum-like interference effect in DM which is\nexhibited as a violation of the formula of total probability and hence the\nclassical Bayesian inference scheme.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics requires Yukawa matrices with\neigenval- ues that differ by orders of magnitude. We propose a novel way to\nexplain this fact without any small or large parameters. The mechanism is based\non the observation that products of matrices of random order one-numbers have\nhierarchical spectra. The same mechanism can easily account for the\nhierarchical structure of the quark mixing matrix.\n", "  We have observed the oxygen-rich SNR 1E 0102.2-7219 with the integral field\nspectrograph WiFeS at Siding Spring Observatory and discovered sulfur-rich\nejecta for the first time. Follow-up deep DDT observations with MUSE on the VLT\n(8100 s on source) have led to the additional discovery of fast- moving\nhydrogen as well as argon-rich and chlorine-rich material. The detection of\nfast-moving hydrogen knots challenges the interpretation that the progenitor of\n1E 0102 was a compact core of a Wolf-Rayet star that had shed its entire\nenvelope. In addition to the detection of hydrogen and the products of\noxygen-burning, this unprecedented sharp (0.2\" spaxel size at ~0.7\" seeing) and\ndeep MUSE view of an oxygen-rich SNR in the Magellanic Clouds reveals further\nexciting discoveries, including [Fe xiv]{\\lambda}5303 and [Fe xi]{\\lambda}7892\nemission, which we associate with the forward shock. We present this exciting\ndata set and discuss some of its implications for the explosion mechanism and\nnucleosynthesis of the associated supernova.\n", "  We present an approach to generate chimera dynamics (localized frequency\nsynchrony) in oscillator networks with two populations of (at least) two\nelements using a general method based on delayed interactions with linear and\nquadratic terms. The coupling design yields robust chimeras through a\nphase-model-based design of the delay and the ratio of linear and quadratic\ncomponents of the interactions. We demonstrate the method in the Brusselator\nmodel and experiments with electrochemical oscillators. The technique opens the\nway to directly bridge chimera dynamics in phase models and real-world\noscillator networks.\n", "  A model of ice floe breakup under ocean wave forcing in the marginal ice zone\n(MIZ) is proposed to investigate how floe size distribution (FSD) evolves under\nrepeated wave breakup events. A three-dimensional linear model of ocean wave\nscattering by a finite array of compliant circular ice floes is coupled to a\nflexural failure model, which breaks a floe into two floes provided the\ntwo-dimensional stress field satisfies a breakup criterion. A closed-feedback\nloop algorithm is devised, which (i)~solves wave scattering problem for a given\nFSD under time-harmonic plane wave forcing, (ii)~computes the stress field in\nall the floes, (iii)~fractures the floes satisfying the breakup criterion and\n(iv)~generates an updated FSD, initialising the geometry for the next iteration\nof the loop.The FSD after 50 breakup events is uni-modal and near normal, or\nbi-modal. Multiple scattering is found to enhance breakup for long waves and\nthin ice, but to reduce breakup for short waves and thick ice. A breakup front\nmarches forward in the latter regime, as wave-induced fracture weakens the ice\ncover allowing waves to travel deeper into the MIZ.\n", "  We construct the phase space of 3-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes\nthat forms the bulk metric representation of the BMS group consisting of both\nsupertranslations and superrotations. The asymptotic symmetry group is a unique\ncopy of the BMS group at both null infinities and spatial infinity. The BMS\nphase space obeys a notion of holographic causality and can be parametrized by\nboundary null fields. This automatically leads to the antipodal identification\nof bulk fields between past and future null infinity in the absence of a global\nconical defect.\n", "  Two-particle backscattering in time-reversal invariant interacting helical\nelectron systems can lead to the formation of quasiparticles with charge $e/2$.\nWe propose a way to detect such states by means of the Josephson effect in the\npresence of proximity-induced superconductivity. In this case, the existence of\n$e/2$ charges leads to an $8 \\pi$-periodic component of the Josephson current\nwhich can be identified through measurement of Shapiro steps in Josephson\njunctions. In particular, we show that even when there is weak explicit\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking, which causes the two-particle backscattering\nto be a sub-leading effect at low energies, its presence can still be detected\nin driven, current-biased Shapiro step measurements. The disappearance of some\nof these steps as a function of the drive frequency is directly related to the\nexistence of non-Abelian zero-energy states. We suggest that this effect can be\nmeasured in current state-of-the-art Rashba wires.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of two coupled identical populations of quadratic\nintegrate-and-fire neurons, which represent the canonical model for class I\nneurons near the spiking threshold. The populations are heterogeneous; they\ninclude both inherently spiking and excitable neurons. The coupling within and\nbetween the populations is global via synapses that take into account the\nfinite width of synaptic pulses. Using a recently developed reduction method\nbased on the Lorentzian ansatz, we derive a closed system of equations for the\nneuron's firing rates and the mean membrane potentials in both populations. The\nreduced equations are exact in the infinite-size limit. The bifurcation\nanalysis of the equations reveals a rich variety of non-symmetric patterns,\nincluding a splay state, antiphase periodic oscillations, chimera-like states,\nalso chaotic oscillations as well as bistabilities between various states. The\nvalidity of the reduced equations is confirmed by direct numerical simulations\nof the finite-size networks.\n", "  Thermodynamics of quantum coherence has attracted growing attention recently,\nwhere the thermodynamic advantage of quantum superposition is characterized in\nterms of quantum thermodynamics. We investigate thermodynamic effects of\nquantum coherent driving in the context of the fluctuation theorem. We adopt a\nquantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback\ncontrol. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process\nplays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum\nmeasurement and post-selection must be considered in the backward process in\nsharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with\nquantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space\nof quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong\nirreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute\nirreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down.\nIn the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute\nirreversibility because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region\ncompatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems,\nabsolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective\nmeasurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically\nforbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of\nabsolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum\ncoherent driving. Absolute irreversibility is shown to emerge in the absence of\ncoherent driving after the measurement, especially in systems under\ntime-delayed feedback control. We show that absolute irreversibility is\nmitigated by increasing the duration of quantum coherent driving or decreasing\nthe delay time of feedback control.\n", "  We consider a scenario inspired by natural supersymmetry, where neutrino data\nis explained within a low-scale seesaw scenario. We extend the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model by adding light right-handed neutrinos and their\nsuperpartners, the R-sneutrinos, and consider the lightest neutralinos to be\nhiggsino-like. We consider the possibilities of having either an R-sneutrino or\na higgsino as lightest supersymmetric particle. Assuming that squarks and\ngauginos are heavy, we systematically evaluate the bounds on slepton masses due\nto existing LHC data.\n", "  Lidar is a well known optical technology for measuring a target's range and\nradial velocity. We describe two lidar systems that use entanglement between\ntransmitted signals and retained idlers to obtain significant quantum\nenhancements in simultaneous measurement of these parameters. The first\nentanglement-enhanced lidar circumvents the Arthurs-Kelly uncertainty relation\nfor simultaneous measurement of range and radial velocity from detection of a\nsingle photon returned from the target. This performance presumes there is no\nextraneous (background) light, but is robust to the roundtrip loss incurred by\nthe signal photons. The second entanglement-enhanced lidar---which requires a\nlossless, noiseless environment---realizes Heisenberg-limited accuracies for\nboth its range and radial-velocity measurements, i.e., their root-mean-square\nestimation errors are both proportional to $1/M$ when $M$ signal photons are\ntransmitted. These two lidars derive their entanglement-based enhancements from\nuse of a unitary transformation that takes a signal-idler photon pair with\nfrequencies $\\omega_S$ and $\\omega_I$ and converts it to a signal-idler photon\npair whose frequencies are $(\\omega_S + \\omega_I)/2$ and $\\omega_S-\\omega_I$.\nInsight into how this transformation provides its benefits is provided through\nan analogy to superdense coding.\n", "  We report on THz time-domain spectroscopy on multiferroic GeV4S8, which\nundergoes orbital ordering at a Jahn-Teller transition at 30.5 K and exhibits\nantiferromagnetic order below 14.6 K. The THz experiments are complemented by\ndielectric experiments at audio and radio frequencies. We identify a low-lying\nexcitation close to 15 cm-1, which is only weakly temperature dependent and\nprobably corresponds to a molecular excitation within the electronic level\nscheme of the V4 clusters. In addition, we detect complex temperature-dependent\nbehavior of a low-lying phononic excitation, closely linked to the onset of\norbitally-driven ferroelectricity. In the high-temperature cubic phase, which\nis paramagnetic and orbitally disordered, this excitation is of relaxational\ncharacter, becomes an overdamped Lorentzian mode in the orbitally ordered phase\nbelow the Jahn-Teller transition, and finally appears as well-defined phonon\nexcitation in the antiferromagnetic state. Abrupt changes in real and imaginary\nparts of the complex dielectric permittivity show that orbital ordering appears\nvia a structural phase transition with strong first-order character and that\nthe onset of antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by significant structural\nchanges, which are of first-order character, too. Dielectric spectroscopy\ndocuments that, at low frequencies, significant dipolar relaxations are present\nin the orbitally ordered, paramagnetic phase only. In contrast to the closely\nrelated GaV4S8, this relaxation dynamics that most likely mirrors coupled\norbital and polar fluctuations does not seem to be related to the dynamic\nprocesses detected in the THz regime.\n", "  We show that the inclusion of higher curvature terms in the gravitational\naction can lead to phase transitions and critical behaviour for charged black\nbranes. The higher curvature terms considered here belong to the recently\nconstructed generalized quasi-topological class [ArXiv: 1703.01631], which\npossess a number of interesting properties, such as being ghost-free on\nconstant curvature backgrounds and non-trivial in four dimensions. We show that\ncritical behaviour is a generic feature of the black branes in all dimensions\n$d \\ge 4$, and contextualize the results with a review of the properties of\nblack branes in Lovelock and quasi-topological gravity, where critical\nbehaviour is not possible. These results may have interesting implications for\nthe CFTs dual to this class of theories.\n", "  We generalize, in a manifestly Weyl-invariant way, our previous expressions\nfor irregular singularity wave functions in two-dimensional SU(2) q-deformed\nYang-Mills theory to SU(N). As an application, we give closed-form expressions\nfor the Schur indices of all (A_{N-1}, A_{N(n-1)-1}) Argyres-Douglas (AD)\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs), thus completing the computation of these\nquantities for the (A_N, A_M) SCFTs. With minimal effort, our wave functions\nalso give new Schur indices of various infinite sets of \"Type IV\" AD theories.\nWe explore the discrete symmetries of these indices and also show how highly\nintricate renormalization group (RG) flows from isolated theories and conformal\nmanifolds in the ultraviolet to isolated theories and (products of) conformal\nmanifolds in the infrared are encoded in these indices. We compare our flows\nwith dimensionally reduced flows via a simple \"monopole vev RG\" formalism.\nFinally, since our expressions are given in terms of concise Lie algebra data,\nwe speculate on extensions of our results that might be useful for probing the\nexistence of hypothetical SCFTs based on other Lie algebras. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of some open problems.\n", "  We show that under local detailed balance the expected entropy production\nrate is always bounded in terms of the dynamical activity. The activity refers\nto the time-symmetric contribution in the action functional for path-space\nprobabilities and relates to escape rates and unoriented traffic. Under global\ndetailed balance we get a lower bound on the decrease of free energy which is\nknown from gradient flow analysis. For stationary driven systems we recover\nsome of the recently studied \"uncertainty\" relations for the entropy\nproduction, appearing in studies about the effectiveness of mesoscopic machines\nand that refine the positivity of the entropy production rate by providing\nlower bounds in terms of a positive and even function of the current(s). We\nextend these lower bounds for the entropy production rate to include\nunderdamped diffusions.\n", "  Exploring the leptonic sector in frontier experiments is more of importance\nnowadays, since the conservation of lepton flavor and total lepton number are\nnot guaranteed anymore in the Standard Model after the discovery of neutrino\noscillations. $\\mu^- + N(A,Z) \\rightarrow e^+ + N(A,Z-2)$ conversion in a\nmuonic atom is one of the most promising channels to investigate the lepton\nnumber violation process, and the measurement of this process is planned in\nfuture $\\mu^--e^-$ conversion experiments with a muonic atom in a muon-stopping\ntarget. This paper discusses how to maximize the experimental sensitivity of\nthe $\\mu^--e^+$ conversion by introducing the new requirement of the mass\nrelation of $M(A,Z-2)<M(A,Z-1)$, where $M(A,Z)$ is the mass of the\nmuon-stopping target nucleus, to get rid of the background from radiative muon\ncapture. The sensitivity of the $\\mu^--e^+$ conversion is anticipated to have\nfour orders of magnitude of improvement in forthcoming experiments using a\nproper target nucleus, which satisfies the mass relation. The most promising\nisotopes found are $^{40}$Ca and $^{32}$S.\n", "  The evolutions of the flat FLRW universe and its linear perturbations are\nstudied systematically in the dressed metric approach of LQC. When it is\ndominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the quantum bounce, the\nevolution of the background can be divided into three different phases prior to\nthe preheating, {\\em bouncing, transition and slow-roll inflation}. During the\nbouncing phase, the evolution is independent of not only the initial\nconditions, but also the inflationary potentials. In particular, the expansion\nfactor can be well described by the same exact solution in all the cases\nconsidered. In contrast, in the potential dominated case such a universality is\nlost. It is because of this universality that the linear perturbations are also\nindependent of the inflationary models and obtained exactly. During the\ntransition phase, the evolutions of the background and its linear perturbations\nare found explicitly, and then matched to the ones given in the other two\nphases. Hence, once the initial conditions are imposed, the linear scalar and\ntensor perturbations will be uniquely determined. Considering two different\nsets of initial conditions, one imposed during the contracting phase and the\nother at the bounce, we calculate the Bogoliubov coefficients and find that the\ntwo sets yield the same results and all lead to particle creations at the onset\nof the inflation. Due to the pre-inflationary dynamics, the scalar and tensor\npower spectra become scale-dependent. Comparing with the Planck 2015 data, we\nfind constraints on the total e-folds that the universe must have expanded\nsince the bounce, in order to be consistent with current observations.\n", "  Recently, a nilpotent real scalar superfield $V$ was introduced in\narXiv:1702.02423 as a model for the Goldstino. It contains only two independent\ncomponent fields, the Goldstino and the auxiliary $D$-field. Here we first show\nthat $V$ can equivalently be realised as a constrained three-form superfield.\nWe demonstrate that every irreducible Goldstino superfield (of which the\nGoldstino is the only independent component field) can be realised as a\ndescendant of $V$ which is invariant under local rescalings $V \\to {\\rm e}^\\tau\nV$, where $\\tau$ is an arbitrary real scalar superfield. We next propose a new\nGoldstino supermultiplet which is described by a nilpotent three-form\nsuperfield $\\cal Y$ that is a variant formulation for the nilpotent chiral\nsuperfield, which is often used in off-shell models for spontaneously broken\nsupergravity. It is shown that the action describing the dynamics of $\\cal Y$\nmay be obtained from a supersymmetric nonlinear $\\sigma$-model in the infrared\nlimit. Unlike $V$, the Goldstino superfield $\\cal Y$ contains two independent\nauxiliary fields, $F= H+{\\rm i} G$, of which $H$ is a scalar and $G$ is the\nfield strength of a gauge three-form. When $\\cal Y$ is coupled to supergravity,\nboth $H$ and $G$ produce positive contributions to the cosmological constant.\nWhile the contribution from $H$ is uniquely determined by the parameter of the\nsupersymmetry breaking in the action, the contribution from $G$ is dynamical.\n", "  Solutions to the electroweak hierarchy problem typically introduce a new\nsymmetry to stabilize the quadratic ultraviolet sensitivity in the self-energy\nof the Higgs boson. The new symmetry is either broken softly or collectively,\nas for example in supersymmetric and little Higgs theories. At low energies\nsuch theories contain naturalness partners of the Standard Model fields which\nare responsible for canceling the quadratic divergence in the squared Higgs\nmass. Post the discovery of any partner-like particles, we propose to test the\naforementioned cancellation by measuring relevant Higgs couplings. Using the\nfermionic top partners in little Higgs theories as an illustration, we\nconstruct a simplified model for naturalness and initiate a study on testing\nnaturalness. After electroweak symmetry breaking, naturalness in the top sector\nrequires $a_T = - \\lambda_t^2$ at leading order, where $\\lambda_t$ and $a_T$\nare the Higgs couplings to a pair of top quarks and top partners, respectively.\nUsing a multivariate method of Boosted Decision Tree to tag boosted particles\nin the Standard Model, we show that, with a luminosity of 30 $ab^{-1}$ at a 100\nTeV $pp$-collider, naturalness could be tested with a precision of 10 % for a\ntop partner mass up to 2.5 TeV.\n", "  The multi-component nature of bilayer graphene (BLG), together with the\nability to controllably tune between the various ground state orders, makes it\na rich system in which to explore interaction driven phenomena. In the\nfractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, the unique Landau level spectrum\nof BLG is anticipated to support a non-Abelian even-denominator state that is\ntunable by both electric and magnetic fields. However, observation of this\nstate, which is anticipated to be stronger than in conventional systems, has\nbeen conspicuously difficult. Here we report transport measurements of a robust\neven denominator FQHE in high-mobility, dual gated BLG devices. We confirm that\nthe stability of the energy gap can be sensitively tuned and map the phase\ndiagram. Our results establish BLG as a dynamic new platform to study\ntopological ground states with possible non-Abelian excitations.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a technique for coupling phonons\nout of an optomechanical crystal cavity. By designing a perturbation that\nbreaks a symmetry in the elastic structure, we selectively induce phonon\nleakage without affecting the optical properties. It is shown experimentally\nvia cryogenic measurements that the proposed cavity perturbation causes loss of\nphonons into mechanical waves on the surface of silicon, while leaving photon\nlifetimes unaffected. This demonstrates that phonon leakage can be engineered\nin on-chip optomechanical systems. We experimentally observe large fluctuations\nin leakage rates that we attribute to fabrication disorder and verify this\nusing simulations. Our technique opens the way to engineering more complex\non-chip phonon networks utilizing guided mechanical waves to connect quantum\nsystems.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of topologically protected edge\nwaves in a two-dimensional elastic hexagonal lattice. The lattice is designed\nto feature K point Dirac cones that are well separated from the other numerous\nelastic wave modes characterizing this continuous structure. We exploit the\narrangement of localized masses at the nodes to break mirror symmetry at the\nunit cell level, which opens a frequency bandgap. This produces a non-trivial\nband structure that supports topologically protected edge states along the\ninterface between two realizations of the lattice obtained through mirror\nsymmetry. Detailed numerical models support the investigations of the\noccurrence of the edge states, while their existence is verified through\nfull-field experimental measurements. The test results show the confinement of\nthe topologically protected edge states along pre-defined interfaces and\nillustrate the lack of significant backscattering at sharp corners. Experiments\nconducted on a trivial waveguide in an otherwise uniformly periodic lattice\nreveal the inability of a perturbation to propagate and its sensitivity to\nbackscattering, which suggests the superior waveguiding performance of the\nclass of non-trivial interfaces investigated herein.\n", "  Galaxy-scale outflows are nowadays observed in many active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs); however, their characterisation in terms of (multi-) phase nature,\namount of flowing material, effects on the host galaxy, is still unsettled. In\nparticular, ionized gas mass outflow rate and related energetics are still\naffected by many sources of uncertainties. In this respect, outflowing gas\nplasma conditions, being largely unknown, play a crucial role.\n  Taking advantage of the spectroscopic analysis results we obtained studying\nthe X-ray/SDSS sample of 563 AGNs at z $<0.8$ presented in our companion paper,\nwe analyse stacked spectra and sub-samples of sources with high signal-to-noise\ntemperature- and density-sensitive emission lines to derive the plasma\nproperties of the outflowing ionized gas component. For these sources, we also\nstudy in detail various diagnostic diagrams to infer information about\noutflowing gas ionization mechanisms. We derive, for the first time, median\nvalues for electron temperature and density of outflowing gas from medium-size\nsamples ($\\sim 30$ targets) and stacked spectra of AGNs. Evidences of shock\nexcitation are found for outflowing gas.\n  We measure electron temperatures of the order of $\\sim 1.7\\times10^4$ K and\ndensities of $\\sim 1200$ cm$^{-3}$ for faint and moderately luminous AGNs\n(intrinsic X-ray luminosity $40.5<log(L_X)<44$ in the 2-10 keV band). We\ncaution that the usually assumed electron density ($N_e=100$ cm$^{-3}$) in\nejected material might result in relevant overestimates of flow mass rates and\nenergetics and, as a consequence, of the effects of AGN-driven outflows on the\nhost galaxy.\n", "  We present the phase diagram in a magnetic field of a 2D isotropic Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on a triangular lattice. We consider spin-$S$ model with\nnearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) interactions. We\nfocus on the range of $1/8<J_2/J_1<1$, where the ordered states are different\nfrom those in the model with only nearest neighbor exchange. A classical ground\nstate in this range has four sublattices and is infinitely degenerate in any\nfield. The actual order is then determined by quantum fluctuations via \"order\nfrom disorder\" phenomenon. We argue that the phase diagram is rich due to\ncompetition between competing four-sublattice quantum states which break either\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ orientational symmetry or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ sublattice symmetry. At\nsmall and high fields, the ground state is a $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-breaking canted\nstripe state, but at intermediate fields the ordered states break\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ sublattice symmetry. The most noticeable of such states is\n\"three up, one down\" state in which spins in three sublattices are directed\nalong the field and in one sublattice opposite to the field. Such a state\nbreaks no continuous symmetry and has gapped excitations. As the consequence,\nmagnetization has a plateau at exactly one half of the saturation value. We\nidentify gapless states, which border the \"three up, one down\" state and\ndiscuss the transitions between these states and the canted stripe state.\n", "  This Letter introduces unexpected diffusion properties in dense granular\nflows, and shows that they result from the development of partially jammed\nclusters of grains, or granular vortices. Transverse diffusion coefficients $D$\nand average vortex sizes $\\ell$ are systematically measured in simulated plane\nshear flows at differing internal numbers $I$ revealing (i) a strong deviation\nfrom the expected scaling $D\\propto d^2 \\dot \\gamma$ involving the grain size\n$d$ and shear rate $\\dot \\gamma$ and (ii) an increase in average vortex size\n$\\ell$ at low $I$, following $\\ell\\propto dI^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ but limited by the\nsystem size. A general scaling $D\\propto \\ell d \\dot \\gamma $ is introduced\nthat captures all the measurements and highlights the key role of vortex size.\nThis leads to establishing a scaling for the diffusivity in dense granular flow\nas $D\\propto d^2 \\sqrt{\\dot \\gamma/ t_i}$ involving the geometric average of\nshear time $1/\\dot\\gamma$ and inertial time $t_i$ as the relevant time scale.\nAnalysis of grain trajectories further evidence that this diffusion process\narises from a vortex-driven random walk.\n", "  Recently two of the authors proposed a mechanism of vacuum energy sequester\nas a means of protecting the observable cosmological constant from quantum\nradiative corrections. The original proposal was based on using global Lagrange\nmultipliers, but later a local formulation was provided. Subsequently other\ninteresting claims of a different non-local approach to the cosmological\nconstant problem were made, based again on global Lagrange multipliers. We\nexamine some of these proposals and find their mutual relationship. We explain\nthat the proposals which do not treat the cosmological constant counterterm as\na dynamical variable require fine tunings to have acceptable solutions.\nFurthermore, the counterterm often needs to be retuned at every order in the\nloop expansion to cancel the radiative corrections to the cosmological\nconstant, just like in standard GR. These observations are an important\nreminder of just how the proposal of vacuum energy sequester avoids such\nproblems.\n", "  In this paper, we have constructed dark energy models in an anisotropic\nBianchi-V space-time and studied the role of anisotropy in the evolution of\ndark energy. We have considered anisotropic dark energy fluid with different\npressure gradients along different spatial directions. In order to obtain a\ndeterministic solution, we have considered three general forms of scale factor.\nThe different forms of scale factors considered here produce time varying\ndeceleration parameters in all the cases that simulates the cosmic transition.\nThe variable equation of state (EoS) parameter, skewness parameters for all the\nmodels are obtained and analyzed. The physical properties of the models are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We investigate entangled photon pair generation in a lossy microring\nresonator using an input-output formalism based on the work of Raymer and\nMcKinstrie (Phys. Rev. A 88, 043819 (2013)) and Alsing, et al. (Phys. Rev. A\n95, 053828 (2017)) that incorporates circulation factors that account for the\nmultiple round trips of the fields within the cavity. We consider the nonlinear\nprocesses of spontaneous parametric down conversion and spontaneous four wave\nmixing, and we compute the generated biphoton signal-idler state from a single\nbus microring resonator, along with the generation, coincidence-to-accidental,\nand heralding efficiency rates. We compare these generalized results to those\nobtained by previous works employing the standard Langevin input-output\nformalism.\n", "  The AdS/CFT duality maps supersymmetric heavy operators with conformal\ndimension of the order of the central charge to asymptotically AdS supergravity\nsolutions. We show that by studying the quadratic fluctuations around such\nbackgrounds it is possible to derive the 4-point correlators of two light and\ntwo heavy states in the supergravity approximation. We provide an explicit\nexample in the AdS$_3$ setup relevant for the duality with the D1-D5 CFT.\nContrary to previously studied examples, the supergravity correlator derived in\nthis work differs from the result obtained at the CFT orbifold point. Our\nmethod bypasses the difficulties of applying the standard Witten's diagrams\napproach to correlators with operators of large conformal dimension and also\navoids some technical steps that have made the computation of dynamical 4-point\ncorrelators in the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ context unfeasible until now.\n", "  The optical properties of a multilayer system of dielectric media with\narbitrary $N$ layers is investigated. Each layer is one of two dielectric\nmedia, with thickness one-quarter the wavelength of light in that medium,\ncorresponding to a central frequency. Using the transfer matrix method, the\ntransmittance $T$ is calculated for all possible $2^N$ sequences for small $N$.\nUnexpectedly, it is found that instead of $2^N$ different values of $T$ at the\ncentral frequency ($T_0$), there are either $(N/2+1)$ or $(N+1)$ discrete\nvalues of $T_0$ for even or odd $N$, respectively. We explain the high\ndegeneracy in the $T_0$ values by defining new symmetry operations that do not\nchange $T_0$. Analytical formulae were derived for the $T_0$ values and their\ndegeneracy as functions of $N$ and an integer parameter for each sequence we\ncall \"charge\". Additionally, the bandwidth of the transmission spectra at $f_0$\nis investigated, revealing some asymptotic behavior at large $N$.\n", "  In this work we analyze the ground-state properties of the $s=1/2$\none-dimensional ANNNI model in a transverse field using the quantum fidelity\napproach. We numerically determined the fidelity susceptibility as a function\nof the transverse field $B_x$ and the strength of the next-nearest-neighbor\ninteraction $J_2$, for systems of up to 24 spins. We also examine the\nground-state vector with respect to the spatial ordering of the spins. The\nground-state phase diagram shows ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, floating,\n$\\Braket{2,2}$ phases, and we predict an infinite number of modulated phases in\nthe thermodynamic limit ($L \\rightarrow \\infty$). The transition lines\nseparating the modulated phases seem to be of second-order, whereas the line\nbetween the floating and the $\\Braket{2,2}$ phases is possibly of first-order.\n", "  We investigate the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking at finite\ntemperature and in an external magnetic field with four-fermion interactions of\ndifferent channels. Quantum and thermal fluctuations are included within the\nfunctional renormalization group approach, and properties of the set of flow\nequations for different couplings, such as its fixed points, are discussed. It\nis found that external parameters, e.g. the temperature and the external\nmagnetic field and so on, do not change the structure of the renormalization\ngroup flows for the couplings. The flow strength is found to be significantly\ndependent on the route and direction in the plane of couplings of different\nchannels. Therefore, the critical temperature for the chiral phase transition\nshows a pronounced dependence on the direction as well. Given fixed initial\nultraviolet couplings, the critical temperature increases with the increasing\nmagnetic field, viz., the magnetic catalysis is observed with initial couplings\nfixed.\n", "  We present first evidence for the Landau level structure of Dirac eigenmodes\nin full QCD for nonzero background magnetic fields, based on first principles\nlattice simulations using staggered quarks. Our approach involves the\nidentification of the lowest Landau level modes in two dimensions, where\ntopological arguments ensure a clear separation of these modes from\nenergetically higher states, and an expansion of the full four-dimensional\nmodes in the basis of these two-dimensional states. We evaluate various\nfermionic observables including the quark condensate and the spin polarization\nin this basis to find how much the lowest Landau level contributes to them. The\nresults allow for a deeper insight into the dynamics of quarks and gluons in\nbackground magnetic fields and may be directly compared to low-energy models of\nQCD employing the lowest Landau level approximation.\n", "  We analyze the factorization to subleading power in the flavor changing\nneutral current process $\\bar B\\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. In particular, we\ncompute the so-called resolved contributions and explore the numerical impact\non observables. In these contributions the virtual photon couples to light\npartons instead of connecting directly to the effective weak-interaction\nvertex. They represent an irreducible uncertainty in the inclusive $\\bar B \\to\nX_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decay which cannot be removed by relaxing the experimentally\nnecessary cuts in the hadronic mass spectrum.\n", "  Isolated Weyl cones in a disordered environment do not show the phenomenon of\nAnderson localization due to the abscence of backscattering processes. However,\nbesides the conventional three dimensional diffusive metal, an additional\nsemimetallic phase can form. In this paper we study the effect of tilt on the\nphysics of disorder in isolated Weyl cones. Our main finding is that while the\nsemimetallic phase remains a stable phase, tilt decreases the size of the\nsemimetallic region. Conversely, disorder increases the effective tilt of the\nquasiparticle excitations.\n", "  The transverse stratification of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets is\nsuggested by observations and theoretical arguments, as a consequence of\nintrinsic properties of the central engine (accretion disc + black hole) and\nexternal medium. On the other hand, the one-component jet approaches are\nheavily challenged by the various observed properties of plasmoids in radio\njets (knots), often associated with internal shocks. Given that such a\ntransverse stratification plays an important role on the jets acceleration,\nstability, and interaction with the external medium, it should also induce\ninternal shocks with various strengths and configurations, able to describe the\nobserved knots behaviours. By establishing a relation between the transverse\nstratification of the jets, the internal shock properties, and the multiple\nobserved AGN jet morphologies and behaviours, our aim is to provide a\nconsistent global scheme of the various AGN jet structures. Working on a large\nsample of AGN radio jets monitored in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)\nby the MOJAVE collaboration, we determined the consistency of a systematic\nassociation of the multiple knots with successive re-collimation shocks. We\nthen investigated the re-collimation shock formation and the influence of\ndifferent transverse stratified structures by parametrically exploring the two\nrelativistic outflow components with the specific relativistic hydrodynamic\n(SRHD) code AMRVAC. We were able to link the different spectral classes of AGN\nwith specific stratified jet characteristics, in good accordance with their\nVLBI radio properties and their accretion regimes.\n", "  We analyse the rare processes $K \\to \\pi\\nu\\bar\\nu$ in view of the recent\nhints of violations of Lepton Flavour Universality (LFU) observed in B meson\ndecays. If, as suggested by present data, the new interactions responsible for\nLFU violations couple mainly to the third generation of left-handed fermions,\n$K \\to \\pi\\nu\\bar\\nu$ decays turn out to be particularly interesting: these are\nthe only kaon decays with third-generation leptons (the $\\tau$ neutrinos) in\nthe final state. In order to relate B-physics anomalies and K decays we adopt\nan Effective Field Theory approach, assuming that the new interactions satisfy\nan approximate $U(2)_q\\times U(2)_\\ell$ flavour symmetry. In this framework we\nshow that O(1) deviations from the Standard Model predictions in $K \\to\n\\pi\\nu\\bar\\nu$ branching ratios, closely correlated to similar effects in $B\n\\to K^{(*)}\\nu\\bar\\nu$, are naturally expected. The correlation of\n$\\mathcal{B}(K \\to \\pi\\nu\\bar\\nu)$, $\\mathcal{B}(B \\to K^{(*)}\\nu\\bar\\nu)$, and\nthe LFU violations in B decays would provide a very valuable tool to shed more\nlight on this interesting phenomenon.\n", "  A rectangular grid formed by liquid filaments on a partially wetting\nsubstrate evolves in a series of breakups leading to arrays of drops with\ndifferent shapes distributed in a rather regular bidimensional pattern. Our\nstudy is focused on the configuration produced when two long parallel filaments\nof silicone oil, which are placed upon a glass substrate previously coated with\na fluorinated solution, are crossed perpendicularly by another pair of long\nparallel filaments. A remarkable feature of this kind of grids is that there\nare two qualitatively different types of drops. While one set is formed at the\ncrossing points, the rest are consequence of the breakup of shorter filaments\nformed between the crossings. Here, we analyze the main geometric features of\nall types of drops, such as shape of the footprint and contact angle\ndistribution along the drop periphery. The formation of a series of short\nfilaments with similar geometric and physical properties allows us to have\nsimultaneously quasi identical experiments to study the subsequent breakups. We\ndevelop a simple hydrodynamic model to predict the number of drops that results\nfrom a filament of given initial length and width. This model is able to yield\nthe length intervals corresponding to a small number of drops and its\npredictions are successfully compared with the experimental data as well as\nwith numerical simulations of the full Navier--Stokes equation that provide a\ndetailed time evolution of the dewetting motion of the filament till the\nbreakup into drops. Finally, the prediction for finite filaments is contrasted\nwith the existing theories for infinite ones.\n", "  A five-dimensional treatment of the Boltzmann equation is used to establish\nthe constitutive equations that relate thermodynamic fluxes and forces up to\nfirst order in the gradients for simple charged fluids in the presence of\nelectromagnetic fields. The formalism uses the ansatz first introduced by\nKaluza back in 1921, proposing that the particle charge-mass ratio is\nproportional to the fifth component of its velocity field. It is shown that in\nthis approach, space-time curvature yields thermodynamic forces leading to\ngeneralizations of the well-known cross-effects present in linear irreversible\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Motivated by the possibility of enhancing dark matter (DM) self-interaction\ncross-section $\\sigma_{\\rm self}$, we have revisited the issue of DM\nannihilation through a Breit-Wigner resonance. In this case thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section has strong temperature dependence, whereas elastic\nscattering of DM on the thermal bath particles is suppressed. This leads to the\nearly kinetic decoupling of DM and an interesting interplay in the evolution of\nDM density and temperature that can be described by a set of coupled Boltzmann\nequations. The standard Breit-Wigner parametrization of a resonance propagator\nis also corrected by including momentum dependence of the resonance width. It\nhas been shown that this effects may change predictions of DM relic density by\nmore than order of magnitude in some regions of the parameter space. Model\nindependent discussion is illustrated within a theory of Abelian vector dark\nmatter. The model assumes extra $U(1)$ symmetry group factor and an additional\ncomplex Higgs field needed to generate a mass for the dark vector boson, which\nprovides an extra neutral Higgs boson $h_2$. We discuss the resonance\namplification of $\\sigma_{\\rm self}$. It turns out that if DM abundance is\nproperly reproduced, the Fermi-LAT data favor heavy DM and constraint the\nenhancement of $\\sigma_{\\rm self}$ to the range, which cannot provide a\nsolution to the small-scale structure problems.}\n", "  The dynamics of thermally fluctuating conserved order parameters are\ndescribed by stochastic conservation laws. Thermal equilibrium in such systems\nrequires the dissipative and stochastic components of the flux to be related by\ndetailed balance. Preserving this relation in spatial and temporal\ndiscretization is necessary to obtain solutions that have fidelity to the\ncontinuum. Here, we propose a finite-difference discretization that preserves\ndetailed balance on the lattice, has spatial error that is isotropic to leading\norder in lattice spacing, and can be integrated accurately in time using a\ndelayed difference method. We benchmark the method for model B dynamics with a\n$\\phi^{4}$ Landau free energy and obtain excellent agreement with analytical\nresults.\n", "  We develop a generalized framework for constructing many-body-interaction\noperations either in linear time, or in logarithmic time with a linear number\nof ancilla qubits. Exact gate decompositions are given in particular for Pauli\nstrings, many-control Toffoli gates, number-~and parity-conserving\ninteractions, Unitary Coupled Cluster operations, and sparse matrix generators.\nWe provide a linear time protocol that works by creating a superposition of\nexponentially many different possible operator strings and then uses dynamical\ndecoupling methodology to undo all the unwanted terms. A logarithmic time\nprotocol overcomes the speed limit of the first by using ancilla registers to\ncondition evolution to the support of the desired many-body interaction before\nusing parallel chaining operations to expand the string length. The two\ntechniques improve substantially on current strategies (reductions in time and\nspace can range from linear to exponential), are applicable to different\nphysical interaction mechanisms such as CNOT, $XX$, and $XX+YY$, and generalize\nto a wide range of many-body operators.\n", "  Spin-orbit mediated phonon relaxation in a two-dimensional quantum dot is\ninvestigated using different confining potentials. Elliptical harmonic\noscillator and cylindrical well results are compared to each other in the case\nof a two-electron GaAs quantum dot subjected to a tilted magnetic field. The\nlowest energy set of two-body singlet and triplet states are calculated\nincluding spin-orbit and magnetic effects. These are used to calculate the\nphonon induced transition rate from the excited triplet to the ground state\nsinglet for magnetic fields up to where the states cross. The roll of the cubic\nDresselhaus effect and the positioning of \"spin hot-spots\" are discussed and\nrelaxation rates for a few different systems are exhibited.\n", "  The emergence of collective synchronization was reproduced long ago by\nWinfree in a classical model consisting of an ensemble of pulse-coupled phase\noscillators. By means of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we derive an exact\nlow-dimensional representation which is exhaustively investigated for a variety\nof pulse types and phase response curves (PRCs). Two structurally different\nsynchronization scenarios are found, which are linked via the mutation of a\nBogdanov-Takens point. From our results, we infer a general rule of thumb\nrelating pulse shape and PRC offset with each scenario. Finally, we compare the\nexact synchronization threshold with the prediction of the averaging\napproximation given by the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. At the leading order, the\ndiscrepancy appears to behave as an odd function of the PRC offset.\n", "  We have calculated the non-linear effects of generic fermionic and bosonic\nhot dark matter components in cosmological N-body simulations. For sub-eV\nmasses, the non-linear power spectrum suppression caused by thermal\nfree-streaming resembles the one seen for massive neutrinos, whereas for masses\nlarger than 1eV, the non-linear relative suppression of power is smaller than\nin linear theory. We furthermore find that in the non-linear regime, one can\nmap fermionic to bosonic models by performing a simple transformation.\n", "  We give a holographic description of global conformal blocks in two\ndimensional conformal field theory on the sphere and on the torus. We show that\nthe conformal blocks for one-point functions on the torus can be written as\nWitten diagrams in thermal AdS. This is accomplished by deriving a general\nconformal Casimir equation for global conformal blocks, and showing that Witten\ndiagrams obey the same equation. We study the semi-classical limit of n-point\nconformal blocks, and show that these equal the action of a network of bulk\nworld-lines obeying appropriate geodesic equations. We give an alternate\ndescription in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity, where the conformal\nblocks are described by networks of Wilson lines, and argue that these\nformulations are equivalent.\n", "  The MHV action is the Yang-Mills action quantized on the light-front, where\nthe two explicit physical gluonic degrees of freedom have been canonically\ntransformed to a new set of fields. This transformation leads to the action\nwith vertices being off-shell continuations of the MHV amplitudes. We show that\nthe solution to the field transformation expressing one of the new fields in\nterms of the Yang-Mills field is a certain type of the Wilson line. More\nprecisely, it is a straight infinite gauge link with a slope extending to the\nlight-cone minus and the transverse direction. One of the consequences of that\nfact is that certain MHV vertices reduced partially on-shell are gauge\ninvariant -- a fact discovered before using conventional light-front\nperturbation theory. We also analyze the diagrammatic content of the field\ntransformations leading to the MHV action. We found that the diagrams for the\nsolution to the transformation (given by the Wilson line) and its inverse\ndiffer only by light-front energy denominators. Further, we investigate the\ncoordinate space version of the inverse solution to the one given by the Wilson\nline. We find an explicit expression given by a power series in fields. We also\ngive a geometric interpretation to it by means of a specially defined vector\nfield. Finally, we discuss the fact that the Wilson line solution to the\ntransformation is directly related to the all-like helicity gluon wave\nfunction, while the inverse functional is a generating functional for solutions\nof self-dual Yang-Mills equations.\n", "  In {\\em{Holm}, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 471 (2015)} stochastic fluid equations were\nderived by employing a variational principle with an assumed stochastic\nLagrangian particle dynamics. Here we show that the same stochastic Lagrangian\ndynamics naturally arises in a multi-scale decomposition of the deterministic\nLagrangian flow map into a slow large-scale mean and a rapidly fluctuating\nsmall scale map. We employ homogenization theory to derive effective slow\nstochastic particle dynamics for the resolved mean part, thereby justifying\nstochastic fluid partial equations in the Eulerian formulation. To justify the\napplication of rigorous homogenization theory, we assume mildly chaotic fast\nsmall-scale dynamics, as well as a centering condition. The latter requires\nthat the mean of the fluctuating deviations is small, when pulled back to the\nmean flow.\n", "  The Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR) has been converted from a\nHigh Energy Physics electron-positron collider to operate as a dedicated\nsynchrotron light source for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)\nand to conduct accelerator physics research as a test accelerator, capable of\nstudying topics relevant to future damping rings, colliders and light sources.\nSome of the specific topics that were targeted for the initial phase of\noperation of the storage ring in this mode, labeled CesrTA (CESR as a Test\nAccelerator), included 1) tuning techniques to produce low emittance beams, 2)\nthe study of electron cloud development in a storage ring and 3) intra-beam\nscattering effects. The complete conversion of CESR to CesrTA occurred over a\nseveral year period, described elsewhere. As a part of this conversion the CESR\nbeam position monitoring (CBPM) system was completely upgraded to provide the\nneeded instrumental capabilities for these studies. This paper describes the\nnew CBPM system hardware, its function and representative measurements\nperformed by the upgraded system.\n", "  Water is a notoriously difficult substance to model both accurately and\nefficiently. Here, we focus on descriptions with a single coarse-grained\nparticle per molecule using the so-called Approximate Non-Conformal (ANC) and\ngeneralized Stockmayer potentials as the starting points. They are fitted using\nthe radial density function and the density of the atomistic SPC/E model by\ndownhill simplex optimization. We compare the results with monatomic water\n(mW), ELBA, as well as with direct Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) of\nSPC/E. The results show that symmetrical potentials result in non-transferable\nmodels, that is, they need to be reparametrized for new state-points. This\nindicates that transferability may require more complex models. Furthermore,\nthe results also show that the addition of a point dipole is not sufficient to\nmake the potentials accurate and transferable to different temperatures (300\nK-500 K) and pressures without an appropriate choice of properties as targets\nduring model optimization.\n", "  We consider large gauge transformations of gravity and electromagnetism in\nD=4 asymptotically flat spacetime. Already at the classical level, we identify\na canonical transformation that decouples the soft variables from the hard\ndynamics. We find that only the soft dynamics is constrained by BMS or large\nU(1) charge conservation. Physically this corresponds to the fact that\nsufficiently long-wavelength photons or gravitons that are added to the\nin-state will simply pass through the interaction region; they scatter\ntrivially in their own sector. This implies in particular that the large gauge\nsymmetries bear no relevance to the black hole information paradox. We also\npresent the quantum version of soft decoupling. As a consistency check, we show\nthat the apparent mixing of soft and hard modes in the original variables\narises entirely from the long range field of the hard charges, which is fixed\nby gauge invariance and so contains no additional information.\n", "  For many decades after the invention of the quark model in 1964 there was no\nevidence that hadrons are formed from anything other than the simplest pairings\nof quarks and antiquarks, mesons being formed of a quark-antiquark pair and\nbaryons from three quarks. In the last decade, however, in an explosion of data\nfrom both $e^+e^-$ and hadron colliders, there are many recently observed\nstates that do not fit into this picture. These new particles are called\ngenerically \"exotics\". They can be either mesons or baryons. Remarkably, they\nall decay into at least one meson formed of either a $c\\overline{c}$ or\n$b\\overline{b}$ pair. In this review, after the introduction, we explore each\nof these new discoveries in detail first from an experimental point of view,\nthen subsequently give a theoretical discussion. These exotics can be explained\nif the new mesons contain two-quarks and two-antiquarks (tetraquarks), while\nthe baryons contain four-quarks plus an antiquark (pentquarks). The theoretical\nexplanations for these states take three divergent tracks: tightly bound\nobjects, just as in the case of normal hadrons, but with more constituents, or\nloosely bound \"molecules\" similar to the deuteron, but formed from two mesons,\nor a meson or baryon, or more wistfully, they are not multiquark states but\nappear due to kinematic effects caused by different rescatterings of virtual\nparticles; most of these models have all been post-dictions. Both the tightly\nand loosely bound models predict the masses and related quantum numbers of new,\nas yet undiscovered states. Thus, future experimental discoveries are needed\nalong with theoretical advances to elucidate the structure of these new exotic\nstates.\n", "  For some theories where the degrees of freedom are tensors of rank $3$ or\nhigher, there exist solvable large $N$ limits dominated by the melonic\ndiagrams. Simple examples are provided by models containing one rank-$3$ tensor\nin the tri-fundamental representation of the $O(N)^3$ symmetry group. When the\nquartic interaction is assumed to have a special tetrahedral index structure,\nthe coupling constant $g$ must be scaled as $N^{-3/2}$ in the melonic large $N$\nlimit. In this paper we consider the combinatorics of a large $N$ theory of one\nfully symmetric and traceless rank-$3$ tensor with the tetrahedral quartic\ninteraction; this model has a single $O(N)$ symmetry group. We explicitly\ncalculate all the vacuum diagrams up to order $g^8$, as well as some diagrams\nof higher order, and find that in the large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held\nfixed only the melonic diagrams survive. While some non-melonic diagrams are\nenhanced in the $O(N)$ symmetric theory compared to the $O(N)^3$ one, we have\nnot found any diagrams where this enhancement is strong enough to make them\ncomparable with the melonic ones. Motivated by these results, we conjecture\nthat the model of a real rank-$3$ symmetric traceless tensor possesses a smooth\nlarge $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed and all the contributing diagrams\nare melonic. A feature of the symmetric traceless tensor models is that some\nvacuum diagrams containing odd numbers of vertices are suppressed only by\n$N^{-1/2}$ relative to the melonic graphs.\n", "  Observations of globular clusters (GCs) and field stars in the halos of the\ngiant elliptical galaxy Cen A and the spiral galaxy M31 show a large range of\ncluster-to-star number ratios ('specific frequencies'). The cluster-to-star\nratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100-1000, at all\ngalactocentric radii and with a slope that does not seem to depend on radius.\nIn dwarf galaxies, the GCs are also more metal-poor than the field stars on\naverage. These observations indicate a strong dependence of either the cluster\nformation efficiency or the cluster destruction rate on metallicity and\nenvironment. We aim to explain these trends by considering various effects that\nmay influence the observed cluster-to-star ratio as a function of metallicity,\nenvironment and cosmological history. We show that both the cluster formation\nefficiency and the maximum cluster mass increase with metallicity, so they\ncannot explain the observed trend. Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric\nradii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular\nclouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly\nefficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.\nThe predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high\nmetallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to\norbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the\nobservations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on\nmetallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be\nexplained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth. As a result,\nwe find that the metallicity-dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio does not\nreflect a GC formation efficiency, but a survival fraction. (Abridged)\n", "  We have incorporated the spin-dependent nucleon-nucleon cross sections into a\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model for the first time, using the\nspin-singlet and spin-triplet nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections\nextracted from the phase-shift analyses of nucleon-nucleon scatterings in free\nspace. We found that the spin splitting of the collective flows is not affected\nby the spin-dependent cross sections, justifying it as a good probe of the\nin-medium nuclear spin-orbit interaction. With the in-medium nuclear spin-orbit\nmean-field potential that leads to local spin polarization, we found that the\nspin-averaged observables, such as elliptic flows of free nucleons and light\nclusters, becomes smaller with the spin-dependent differential nucleon-nucleon\nscattering cross sections.\n", "  We present a Lorentz-covariant, Euclidean coordinate-space expression for the\nhadronic vacuum polarisation, the Adler function and the leading hadronic\ncontribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. The representation\noffers a lot of flexibility for an implementation in lattice QCD. We expect it\nto be particularly helpful for the quark-line disconnected contributions.\n", "  We present an embedded-cluster method, based on the TRILEX formalism. It\nturns the Fierz ambiguity, inherent to approaches based on a bosonic decoupling\nof local fermionic interactions, into a convergence criterion. It is based on\nthe approximation of the three-leg vertex by a coarse-grained vertex computed\nby solving a self-consistently determined multi-site effective impurity model.\nThe computed self-energies are, by construction, continuous functions of\nmomentum. We show that, in three interaction and doping regimes of parameters\nof the two-dimensional Hubbard model, self-energies obtained with clusters of\nsize four only are very close to numerically exact benchmark results. We show\nthat the Fierz parameter, which parametrizes the freedom in the\nHubbard-Stratonovich decoupling, can be used as a quality control parameter. By\ncontrast, the $GW$+extended dynamical mean field theory approximation with four\ncluster sites is shown to yield good results only in the weak-coupling regime\nand for a particular decoupling. Finally, we show that the vertex has spatially\nnonlocal components only at low Matsubara frequencies.\n", "  Compact stars may contain quark matter in their interiors at densities\nexceeding several times the nuclear saturation density. We explore models of\nsuch compact stars where there are two first-order phase transitions: the first\nfrom nuclear matter to a quark-matter phase, followed at higher density by\nanother first-order transition to a different quark matter phase [e.g., from\nthe two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) to the color-flavor-locked (CFL)\nphase). We show that this can give rise to two separate branches of hybrid\nstars, separated from each other and from the nuclear branch by instability\nregions and, therefore, to a new family of compact stars, denser than the\nordinary hybrid stars. In a range of parameters, one may obtain twin hybrid\nstars (hybrid stars with the same masses but different radii) and even triplets\nwhere three stars, with inner cores of nuclear matter, 2SC matter, and CFL\nmatter, respectively, all have the same mass but different radii.\n", "  The strong light-matter coupling attainable in optical cavities enables the\ngeneration of highly squeezed states of atomic ensembles. It was shown in\n[Phys. Rev. A 66, 022314 (2002)] how an effective one-axis twisting Hamiltonian\ncan be realized in a cavity setup. Here, we extend this work and show how an\neffective two-axis twisting Hamiltonian can be realized in a similar cavity\nsetup. We compare the two schemes in order to characterize their advantages. In\nthe absence of decoherence, the two-axis Hamiltonian leads to more squeezing\nthan the one-axis Hamiltonian. If limited by decoherence from spontaneous\nemission and cavity decay, we find roughly the same level of squeezing for the\ntwo schemes scaling as (NC)^(1/2) where C is the single atom cooperativity and\nN is the total number of atoms. When compared to an ideal squeezing operation,\nwe find that for specific initial states, a dissipative version of the one-axis\nscheme attains higher fidelity than the unitary one-axis scheme or the two-axis\nscheme. However, the unitary one-axis and two-axis schemes perform better for\ngeneral initial states.\n", "  A cosmic lepton asymmetry\n$\\eta_{\\text{l}}=(n_{\\text{l}}-n_{\\bar{\\text{l}}})/n_{\\gamma}$ affects the\nprimordial helium abundance and the expansion rate of the early Universe. Both\nof these effects have an impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). We derive constraints on the neutrino chemical potentials\nfrom the Planck 2015 data, assuming equal lepton flavour asymmetries and\nnegligible neutrino masses. We find $\\xi=-0.002 ^{+0.114}_{-0.111}$ (95\\% CL)\nfor the chemical potentials, which corresponds to $ -0.085 \\leq \\eta_{\\text{l}}\n\\leq 0.084$. Our constraints on the lepton asymmetry are significantly stronger\nthan previous constraints from CMB data analysis and we argue that they are\nmore robust than those from primordial light element abundances. The resulting\nconstraints on the primordial helium and deuterium abundances are consistent\nwith those from direct measurements.\n", "  In this article we construct the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant associated with\nthe Drinfeld Center of the spherical category arising from the $U(1)$ BF theory\non a closed $3$-manifold $M$. This invariant is shown to coincide with the\nTuraev-Viro invariant of $M$ thus providing an example of the Turaev-Virelizier\ntheorem. Finally we exhibit some surgery formulas for the abelian Turaev-Viro\ninvariant which are very similar to the surgery formulas of the abelian\nReshetikhin-Turaev invariant obtained in the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons context.\n", "  The low-energy expansion of one-loop amplitudes in type II string theory\ngenerates a series of world-sheet integrals whose integrands can be represented\nby world-sheet Feynman diagrams. These integrands are modular invariant and\nunderstanding the structure of the action of the modular Laplacian on them is\nimportant for determining their contribution to string scattering amplitudes.\nIn this paper we study a particular infinite family of such integrands\nassociated with three-loop scalar vacuum diagrams of tetrahedral topology and\nfind closed forms for the action of the Laplacian. We analyse the possible\neigenvalues and degeneracies of the Laplace operator by group- and\nrepresentation-theoretic means.\n", "  We report on a detailed study of the stellar populations and ionized gas\nproperties in the merger LIRG NGC 2623, analysing optical Integral Field\nSpectroscopy from the CALIFA survey and PMAS LArr, multiwavelength HST imaging,\nand OSIRIS narrow band H$\\alpha$ and [NII]$\\lambda$6584 imaging. The spectra\nwere processed with the STARLIGHT full spectral fitting code, and the results\ncompared with those for two early-stage merger LIRGs (IC 1623 W and NGC 6090),\ntogether with CALIFA Sbc/Sc galaxies. We find that NGC 2623 went through two\nperiods of increased star formation (SF), a first and widespread episode,\ntraced by intermediate-age stellar populations ISP (140 Myr-1.4 Gyr), and a\nsecond one, traced by young stellar populations YSP ($<$140 Myr), which is\nconcentrated in the central regions ($<$1.4 kpc). Our results are in agreement\nwith the epochs of the first peri-center passage ($\\sim$200 Myr ago) and\ncoalescence ($<$100 Myr ago) predicted by dynamical models, and with high\nresolution merger simulations in the literature, consistent with NGC 2623\nrepresenting an evolved version of the early-stage mergers. Most ionized gas is\nconcentrated within $<$2.8 kpc, where LINER-like ionization and high velocity\ndispersion ($\\sim$220 km/s) are found, consistent with the previously reported\noutflow. As revealed by the highest resolution OSIRIS and HST data, a\ncollection of HII regions is also present in the plane of the galaxy, which\nexplains the mixture of ionization mechanisms in this system. It is unlikely\nthat the outflow in NGC 2623 will escape from the galaxy, given the low SFR\nintensity ($\\sim$0.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$), the fact that the outflow\nrate is 3 times lower than the current SFR, and the escape velocity in the\ncentral areas higher than the outflow velocity.\n", "  We examine gravitational wave memory in the case where sources and detector\nare in a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We consider the case where the universe can be\nhighly inhomogeneous, but the gravitatational radiation is treated in the short\nwavelength approximation. We find results very similar to those of\ngravitational wave memory in an asymptotically flat spacetime; however, the\noverall magnitude of the memory effect is enhanced by a redshift-dependent\nfactor. In addition, we find the memory can be affected by lensing.\n", "  We first analyse the integrable scattering theory describing the massless\nexcitations of $AdS_2 \\times S^2 \\times T^6$ superstrings in the relativistic\nlimit. The matrix part of the S-matrix is obtained in the BMN limit from the\nconjectured exact expression, and compared with known S-matrices with N=1\nsupersymmetry. A dressing factor, yet unknown for the complete theory, is here\nconstructed based on relativistic crossing symmetry. We derive a Bethe-ansatz\ncondition by employing a transfer-matrix technique based on the so-called\nfree-fermion condition. This is known to overcome the problem of lack of a\nreference state. We then generalise the method to the massless non-relativistic\ncase, and compare the resulting Bethe-ansatz condition with a simple massless\nlimit of the one conjectured by Sorokin, Tseytlin, Wulff and Zarembo.\n", "  In the E6 inspired composite Higgs model (E6CHM) the strongly interacting\nsector possesses an SU(6) global symmetry which is expected to be broken down\nto its SU(5) subgroup at the scale f > 10 TeV. This breakdown results in a set\nof pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that includes one Standard Model (SM)\nsinglet scalar, a SM-like Higgs doublet and an SU(3)_C triplet of scalar\nfields, T. In the E6CHM the Z^L_{2} symmetry, which is a discrete subgroup of\nthe U(1)_L associated with lepton number conservation, can be used to forbid\noperators which lead to rapid proton decay. The remaining baryon number\nviolating operators are sufficiently strongly suppressed because of the large\nvalue of the scale f. We argue that in this variant of the E6CHM a sizeable\nbaryon number asymmetry can be induced if CP is violated. At the same time, the\npresence of the SU(3)_C scalar triplet with mass in the few TeV range may give\nrise to spectacular new physics signals that may be detected at the LHC in the\nnear future.\n", "  In theories of Einstein gravity coupled with a dilaton and a two-form, a soft\ntheorem for the two-form, known as the Kalb-Ramond B-field, has so far been\nmissing. In this work we fill the gap, and in turn formulate a unified soft\ntheorem valid for gravitons, dilatons and B-fields in any tree-level scattering\namplitude involving the three massless states. The new soft theorem is fixed by\nmeans of on-shell gauge invariance and enters at the subleading order of the\ngraviton's soft theorem. In contrast to the subsubleading soft behavior of\ngravitons and dilatons, we show that the soft behavior of B-fields at this\norder cannot be fully fixed by gauge invariance. Nevertheless, we show that it\nis possible to establish a gauge invariant decomposition of the amplitudes to\nany order in the soft expansion. We check explicitly the new soft theorem in\nthe bosonic string and in Type II superstring theories, and furthermore\ndemonstrate that, at the next order in the soft expansion, totally gauge\ninvariant terms appear in both string theories which cannot be factorized into\na soft theorem.\n", "  A notion of localization of information within quantum subsystems plays a key\nrole in describing the physics of quantum systems, and in particular is a\nprerequisite for discussing important concepts such as entanglement and\ninformation transfer. While subsystems can be readily defined for finite\nquantum systems and in local quantum field theory, a corresponding definition\nfor gravitational systems is significantly complicated by the apparent\nnonlocality arising due to gauge invariance, enforced by the constraints. A\nrelated question is whether \"soft hair\" encodes otherwise localized\ninformation, and the question of such localization also remains an important\npuzzle for proposals that gravity emerges from another structure such as a\nboundary field theory as in AdS/CFT. This paper describes different approaches\nto defining local subsystem structure, and shows that at least classically,\nperturbative gravity has localized subsystems based on a split structure,\ngeneralizing the split property of quantum field theory. This, and related\narguments for QED, give simple explanations that in these theories there is\nlocalized information that is independent of fields outside a region, in\nparticular so that there is no role for \"soft hair\" in encoding such\ninformation. Additional subtleties appear in quantum gravity. We argue that\nlocalized information exists in perturbative quantum gravity in the presence of\nglobal symmetries, but that nonperturbative dynamics is likely tied to a\nmodification of such structure.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to investigate the capillary\nfluctuations of steps on the surface of a model metal system. The fluctuation\nspectrum, characterized by the wave number ($k$) dependence of the mean squared\ncapillary-wave amplitudes and associated relaxation times, is calculated for\n$\\left<110\\right>$ and $\\left<112\\right>$ steps on the $\\{111\\}$ surface of\nelemental copper near the melting temperature of the classical potential model\nconsidered. Step stiffnesses are derived from the MD results, yielding values\nfrom the largest system sizes of $(37\\pm1) \\,\n\\mathrm{meV}/\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ for the different line orientations,\nimplying that the stiffness is isotropic within the statistical precision of\nthe calculations. The fluctuation lifetimes are found to vary by approximately\nfour orders of magnitude over the range of wave numbers investigated,\ndisplaying a $k$ dependence consistent with kinetics governed by step-edge\nmediated diffusion. The values for step stiffness derived from these\nsimulations are compared to step free energies for the same system and\ntemperature obtained in a recent MD-based thermodynamic-integration (TI) study\n[Freitas, Frolov, and Asta, Phys. Rev. B 95, 155444 (2017)]. Results from the\ncapillary-fluctuation analysis and TI calculations yield statistically\nsignificant differences that are discussed within the framework of\nstatistical-mechanical theories for configurational contributions to step free\nenergies.\n", "  In this paper, we address the motion of charged particles acted upon by a\nsinusoidal electrostatic wave, whose amplitude and phase velocity vary slowly\nenough in time for neo-adiabatic theory to apply. Moreover, we restrict to the\nsituation when only few separatrix crossings have occurred, so that the\nadiabatic invariant, $\\mathcal{I}$, remains nearly constant. We insist here on\nthe fact that $\\mathcal{I}$ is different from the dynamical action, $I$. In\nparticular, we show that $\\mathcal{I}$ depends on the whole time history of the\nwave variations, while the action is usually defined as a local function of the\nwave amplitude and phase velocity. Moreover, we provide several numerical\nresults showing how the action distribution function, $f(I)$, varies with time,\nand we explain how to derive it analytically. The derivation is then\ngeneralized to the situation when the wave is weakly inhomogeneous.\n", "  We examine an opinion formation model, which is a mixture of Voter and Ising\nagents. Numerical simulations show that even a very small fraction ($\\sim 1\\%$)\nof the Ising agents drastically changes the behaviour of the Voter model. The\nVoter agents act as a medium, which correlates sparsely dispersed Ising agents,\nand the resulting ferromagnetic ordering persists up to a certain temperature.\nUpon addition of the Ising agents, a logarithmically slow coarsening of the\nVoter model ($d=2$), or its active steady state ($d=3$), change into an\nIsing-type power-law coarsening.\n", "  Using the chiral algebra bootstrap, we revisit the simplest Argyres-Douglas\n(AD) generalization of Argyres-Seiberg S-duality. We argue that the exotic AD\nsuperconformal field theory (SCFT), $T_{3,{3\\over2}}$, emerging in this duality\nsplits into a free piece and an interacting piece, T_X, even though this\nfactorization seems invisible in the Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve derived from the\ncorresponding M5-brane construction. Without a Lagrangian, an associated\ntopological field theory, a BPS spectrum, or even an SW curve, we nonetheless\nobtain exact information about T_X by bootstrapping its chiral algebra,\nchi(T_X), and finding the corresponding vacuum character in terms of Affine\nKac-Moody characters. By a standard 4D/2D correspondence, this result gives us\nthe Schur index for T_X and, by studying this quantity in the limit of small\nS^1, we make contact with a proposed S^1 reduction. Along the way, we discuss\nvarious properties of T_X: as an N=1 theory, it has flavor symmetry\nSU(3)XSU(2)XU(1), the central charge of chi(T_X) matches the central charge of\nthe bc ghosts in bosonic string theory, and its global SU(2) symmetry has a\nWitten anomaly. This anomaly does not prevent us from building conformal\nmanifolds out of arbitrary numbers of T_X theories (giving us a surprisingly\nclose AD relative of Gaiotto's T_N theories), but it does lead to some open\nquestions in the context of the chiral algebra / 4D N=2 SCFT correspondence.\n", "  We show how masses for singlet fermions can be generated by interactions with\na D-particle model of space-time foam inspired by brane theory. It has been\nshown previously by one of the authors (N.E.M.) such interactions may generate\ngenerate dynamically small masses for charged fermions via the recoils of\nD-particle defects interacting with photons. In this work we consider the\ndirect interactions of D-particle with uncharged singlet fermions such as\nright-handed neutrinos. Quantum fluctuations of the lattice of D-particles have\nmassless vector (spin-one) excitations that are analogues of phonons. These\nmediate forces between the singlet fermions, generating large dynamical masses\nthat may be communicated to light neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism.\n", "  The design and characterization of a new laser-desorption molecular beam\nsource, tailored for use in x-ray-free-electron-laser and\nultrashort-pulse-laser imaging experiments, is presented. It consists of a\nsingle mechanical unit containing all source components, including the\nmolecular-beam valve, the sample, and the fiber-coupled desorption laser, which\nis movable in five axes, as required for experiments at central facilities.\nUtilizing strong-field ionization, we characterize the produced molecular beam\nand evaluate the influence of desorption laser pulse energy, relative timing of\nvalve opening and desorption laser, sample bar height, and which part of the\nmolecular packet is probed on the sample properties. Strong-field ionization\nacts as a universal probe and allows to detect all species present in the\nmolecular beam, and hence enables us to analyze the purity of the produced\nmolecular beam, including molecular fragments. We present optimized\nexperimental parameters for the production of the purest molecular beam,\ncontaining the highest yield of intact parent ions, which we find to be very\nsensitive to the placement of the desorbed-molecules plume within the\nsupersonic expansion.\n", "  We present an analysis of far--infrared (FIR) [CII] and [OI] fine structure\nline and continuum observations obtained with $Herschel$/PACS, and CO(1-0)\nobservations obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, of Lyman\nBreak Analogs (LBAs) at $z\\sim 0.2$. The principal aim of this work is to\ndetermine the typical ISM properties of $z\\sim 1-2$ Main Sequence (MS)\ngalaxies, with stellar masses between $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$,\nwhich are currently not easily detectable in all these lines even with ALMA and\nNOEMA. We perform PDR modeling and apply different IR diagnostics to derive the\nmain physical parameters of the FIR emitting gas and dust and we compare the\nderived ISM properties to those of galaxies on and above the MS at different\nredshifts. We find that the ISM properties of LBAs are quite extreme (low gas\ntemperature, high density and thermal pressure) with respect to those found in\nlocal normal spirals and more active local galaxies. LBAs have no [CII] deficit\ndespite having the high specific star formation rates (sSFRs) typical of\nstarbursts. Although LBAs lie above the local MS, we show that their ISM\nproperties are more similar to those of high-redshift MS galaxies than of local\ngalaxies above the main sequence. This data set represents an important\nreference for planning future ALMA [CII] observations of relatively low-mass MS\ngalaxies at the epoch of the peak of the cosmic star formation.\n", "  We show how the dense shells of circumstellar gas immediately outside the red\nsupergiants (RSGs) can affect the early optical light curves of Type II-P SNe\ntaking the example of SN 2013ej. The peak in V, R and I bands, decline rate\nafter peak and plateau length are found to be strongly influenced by the dense\nCSM formed due to enhanced mass loss during the oxygen and silicon burning\nstage of the progenitor. We find that the required explosion energy for the\nprogenitors with CSM is reduced by almost a factor of 2.\n", "  We investigate the holographic Smarr relation beyond the large N limit. By\nmaking use of the holographic dictionary, we find that the bulk correlates of\nsub-leading 1/N corrections to this relation are related to the couplings in\nLovelock gravity theories. We likewise obtain a holographic equation of state,\nand check its validity for a variety of interesting and non-trivial black\nholes, including rotating planar black holes in Gauss-Bonnet-Born-Infeld\ngravity, and non-extremal rotating black holes in minimal 5d gauged\nsupergravity. We provide an explanation of the N-dependence of the holographic\nSmarr relation in terms of contributions due to planar and non-planar diagrams\nin the dual theory.\n", "  Harmonic decompositions of multivariate time series are considered for which\nwe adopt an integral operator approach with periodic semigroup kernels.\nSpectral decomposition theorems are derived that cover the important cases of\ntwo-time statistics drawn from a mixing invariant measure.\n  The corresponding eigenvalues can be grouped per Fourier frequency, and are\nactually given, at each frequency, as the singular values of a cross-spectral\nmatrix depending on the data. These eigenvalues obey furthermore a variational\nprinciple that allows us to define naturally a multidimensional power spectrum.\nThe eigenmodes, as far as they are concerned, exhibit a data-adaptive character\nmanifested in their phase which allows us in turn to define a multidimensional\nphase spectrum.\n  The resulting data-adaptive harmonic (DAH) modes allow for reducing the\ndata-driven modeling effort to elemental models stacked per frequency, only\ncoupled at different frequencies by the same noise realization. In particular,\nthe DAH decomposition extracts time-dependent coefficients stacked by Fourier\nfrequency which can be efficiently modeled---provided the decay of temporal\ncorrelations is sufficiently well-resolved---within a class of multilayer\nstochastic models (MSMs) tailored here on stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators.\n  Applications to the Lorenz 96 model and to a stochastic heat equation driven\nby a space-time white noise, are considered. In both cases, the DAH\ndecomposition allows for an extraction of spatio-temporal modes revealing key\nfeatures of the dynamics in the embedded phase space. The multilayer\nStuart-Landau models (MSLMs) are shown to successfully model the typical\npatterns of the corresponding time-evolving fields, as well as their statistics\nof occurrence.\n", "  Based on gauge-gravity duality, by using holographic entanglement entropy, we\nhave done a phenomenological study to probe confinement-deconfinement phase\ntransition in the QCD-like gauge theory. Our outcomes are in perfect agreement\nwith the expected results, qualitatively and quantitatively. We find out that\nthe (holographic) entanglement entropy is a reliable order parameter for\nprobing the phase transition.\n", "  We describe the Survey for Pulsars and Extragalactic Radio Bursts (SUPERB),\nan ongoing pulsar and fast transient survey using the Parkes radio telescope.\nSUPERB involves real-time acceleration searches for pulsars and single-pulse\nsearches for pulsars and fast radio bursts. We report on the observational\nsetup, data analysis, multi-wavelength/messenger connections, survey\nsensitivities to pulsars and fast radio bursts and the impact of radio\nfrequency interference. We further report on the first 10 pulsars discovered in\nthe project. Among these is PSR~J1306$-$40, a millisecond pulsar in a binary\nsystem where it appears to be eclipsed for a large fraction of the orbit.\nPSR~J1421$-$4407 is another binary millisecond pulsar; its orbital period is\n$30.7$ days. This orbital period is in a range where only highly eccentric\nbinaries are known, and expected by theory; despite this its orbit has an\neccentricity of $10^{-5}$.\n", "  The clockwork mechanism is a novel method for generating a large separation\nbetween the dynamical scale and interaction scale of a theory. We demonstrate\nhow the mechanism can arise from a sequence of strongly-coupled sectors. This\nframework avoids elementary scalar fields as well as ad hoc continuous global\nsymmetries, both of which are subject to serious stability issues. The\nclockwork factor, $q$, is determined by the consistency of the strong dynamics.\nThe preserved global $U(1)$ of the clockwork appears as an accidental symmetry,\nresulting from discrete or $U(1)$ gauge symmetries, and it is spontaneously\nbroken by the chiral condensates. We apply such a dynamical clockwork to\nconstruct models with an effectively invisible QCD axion from TeV-scale strong\ndynamics. The axion couplings are determined by the localisation of the\nStandard Model interactions along the clockwork sequence. The TeV spectrum\nincludes either coloured hadrons or vector-like quarks. Dark matter can be\naccounted for by the axion or the lightest neutral baryons, which are\naccidentally stable.\n", "  Minimal scalar Higgs portal dark matter model is increasingly in tension with\nrecent results form direct detection experiments like LUX and XENON. In this\npaper we make a systematic study of minimal extension of the $ \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nstabilised singlet scalar Higgs portal scenario in terms of their prospects at\ndirect detection experiments. We consider both enlarging the stabilising\nsymmetry to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and incorporating multipartite features in the dark\nsector. We demonstrate that in these non-minimal models the interplay of\nannihilation, co-annihilation and semi-annihilation processes considerably\nrelax constraints from present and proposed direct detection experiments while\nsimultaneously saturating observed dark matter relic density. We explore in\nparticular the resonant semi-annihilation channel within the multipartite\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ framework which results in new unexplored regions of parameter\nspace that would be difficult to constrain by direct detection experiments in\nthe near future. The role of dark matter exchange processes within\nmulti-component $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3'$ framework is illustrated.\nWe make quantitative estimates to elucidate the role of the various\nannihilation processes in the different allowed regions of parameter space of\nthese models.\n", "  We compare the characteristics of phase-pure MOCVD grown ZB and WZ InAs\nnanowire transistors in several atmospheres: air, dry pure N$_2$ and O$_2$, and\nN$_2$ bubbled through liquid H$_2$O and alcohols to identify whether\nphase-related structural/surface differences affect their response. Both WZ and\nZB give poor gate characteristics in dry state. Adsorption of polar species\nreduces off-current by 2-3 orders of magnitude, increases on-off ratio and\nsignificantly reduces sub-threshold slope. The key difference is the greater\nsensitivity of WZ to low adsorbate level. We attribute this to facet structure\nand its influence on the separation between conduction electrons and surface\nadsorption sites. We highlight the important role adsorbed species play in\nnanowire device characterisation. WZ is commonly thought superior to ZB in InAs\nnanowire transistors. We show this is an artefact of the moderate humidity\nfound in ambient laboratory conditions: WZ and ZB perform equally poorly in the\ndry gas limit yet equally well in the wet gas limit. We also highlight the\nvital role density-lowering disorder has in improving gate characteristics, be\nit stacking faults in mixed-phase WZ or surface adsorbates in pure-phase\nnanowires.\n", "  We report the observation of the optomechanical strain applied to thermal and\nto quantum degenerate $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ atomic clouds when illuminated by an\nintense, far detuned homogenous laser beam. In this regime the atomic cloud\nacts as a lens which focuses the laser beam. As a back action, the atoms\nexperience a force opposite to the beam deflection, which depends on the atomic\ncloud density profile. We experimentally demonstrate the basic features of this\nforce, distinguishing it from the well-established scattering and dipole\nforces. The observed strain saturates, ultimately limiting the momentum impulse\nthat can be transferred to the atoms. This optomechanical force may effectively\ninduce inter-particle interactions, which can be optically tuned.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous phenomenon in turbulent plasmas. It is\nan important part of the turbulent dynamics and heating of space and\nastrophysical plasmas. We examine the statistics of magnetic reconnection using\na quantitative local analysis of the magnetic vector potential, previously used\nin magnetohydrodynamics simulations, and now generalized to fully kinetic PIC\nsimulations. Different ways of reducing the particle noise for analysis\npurposes including multiple smoothing techniques are explored. We find that a\nFourier filter applied at the Debye scale is an optimal choice for analyzing\nPIC data. Finlay, we find a broader distribution of normalized reconnection\nrates compared to the MHD limit with rates as large as 0.5 but with an average\nof approximately 0.1.\n", "  Spin transport through magnetic insulators via magnons has recently been\nexplored for a growing variety of magnetic systems with long-range order and\nwell-understood spin excitation spectra. Here we show dramatic effects of spin\ntransport through an amorphous magnetic insulator, which is both magnetically\nand structurally disordered. We generate and detect spin flow though amorphous\nyttrium-iron-garnet ($a$-YIG) thin films in a non-local geometry by use of the\nspin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects in platinum strips separated by 10 or\nmore microns. By comparing non-local spin transport in $a$-YIG on suspended\nmicromachined thermal isolation platforms to the same experiment performed on a\nbulk substrate, we show strong effects of in-plane thermal gradients on spin\ntransport in the disordered magnetic insulator. The resulting non-local voltage\nsignals are orders of magnitude larger than those seen in crystalline magnetic\ninsulators, with easily measurable spin signals seen even at distances in\nexcess of $100$ microns. In analogy to heat transport, where disordered\nmaterials support a range of vibrational excitations that can allow large\nthermal conductivities, we suggest that efficient spin transport in disordered\nmagnetic systems can occur via a similar spectrum of excitations that relies on\nstrong local exchange interactions and does not require long-range order. This\nwork not only opens a new area for fundamental experimental and theoretical\nstudies of spin transport, but also sets a new direction in materials science\nfor magnonic and spintronic devices.\n", "  We calculate the strong isospin breaking and QED corrections to meson masses\nand the hadronic vacuum polarization in an exploratory study on a\n$64\\times24^3$ lattice with an inverse lattice spacing of $a^{-1}=1.78$ GeV and\nan isospin symmetric pion mass of $m_\\pi=340$ MeV. We include QED in an\nelectro-quenched setup using two different methods, a stochastic and a\nperturbative approach. We find that the electromagnetic correction to the\nleading hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is\nsmaller than $1\\%$ for the up quark and $0.1\\%$ for the strange quark, although\nit should be noted that this is obtained using unphysical light quark masses.\nIn addition to the results themselves, we compare the precision which can be\nreached for the same computational cost using each method. Such a comparison is\nalso made for the meson electromagnetic mass-splittings.\n", "  Using E-strings, we can analyze not only six-dimensional superconformal field\ntheories but also probe vacua of non-perturabative heterotic string. We study\nstrings made of D3-branes wrapped on various two-cycles in the global F-theory\nsetup. We claim that E-strings are elementary in the sense that various\ncombinations of E-strings can form M-strings as well as heterotic strings and\nnew kind of strings, called G-strings. Using them, we show that emissions and\ncombinations of heterotic small instantons generate most of known\nsix-dimensional superconformal theories, their affinizations and little string\ntheories. Taking account of global structure of compact internal geometry, we\nalso show that special combinations of E-strings play an important role in\nconstructing six-dimensional theories of $D$- and $E$-types. We check global\nconsistency conditions from anomaly cancellation conditions, both from\nfive-branes and strings, and show that they are given in terms of elementary\nE-string combinations.\n", "  We consider two copies of the Standard Model, interchanged by an exact parity\nsymmetry, P. The observed fermion mass hierarchy is described by suppression\nfactors $\\epsilon^{n_i}$ for charged fermion $i$, as can arise in\nFroggatt-Nielsen and extra-dimensional theories of flavor. The corresponding\nflavor factors in the mirror sector are $\\epsilon'^{n_i}$, so that spontaneous\nbreaking of the parity P arises from a single parameter $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$,\nyielding a tightly constrained version of Minimal Mirror Twin Higgs, introduced\nin our previous paper. Models are studied for simple values of $n_i$, including\nin particular one with SU(5)-compatibility, that describe the observed fermion\nmass hierarchy. The entire mirror quark and charged lepton spectrum is broadly\npredicted in terms of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$, as are the mirror QCD scale and the\ndecoupling temperature between the two sectors. Helium-, hydrogen- and\nneutron-like mirror dark matter candidates are constrained by self-scattering\nand relic ionization. In each case, the allowed parameter space can be fully\nprobed by proposed direct detection experiments. Correlated predictions are\nmade as well for the Higgs signal strength and the amount of dark radiation.\n", "  We explore the sensitivity of displaced vertex searches at LHCb for testing\nsterile neutrino extensions of the Standard Model towards explaining the\nobserved neutrino masses. We derive estimates for the constraints on sterile\nneutrino parameters from a recently published displaced vertex search at LHCb\nbased on run 1 data. They yield the currently most stringent limit on\nactive-sterile neutrino mixing in the sterile neutrino mass range between 4.5\nGeV and 10 GeV. Furthermore, we present forecasts for the sensitivities that\ncould be obtained from the run 2 data and also for the high-luminosity phase of\nthe LHC.\n", "  Finite-length one-dimensional topological superconductor wires host localized\nMajorana zero modes at their ends. In realistic models, these appear only after\na topological quantum critical point is crossed by external tuning of\nparameters. Thus, there is a universal finite-size scaling, governed by the\ncritical point, that dictates the evolution of the energy of the Majorana modes\nnear the transition. We first describe this scaling, then apply it in detail to\nan explicit synthetic topological superconductor model. Our work not only\nconnects Ising quantum criticality with realistic nanowires in the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling, Zeeman splitting and superconductivity, but also provides\na viable experimental route for discerning the existence of the topological\nquantum critical point.\n", "  We study the eigenstate phases of disordered spin chains with on-site finite\nnon-Abelian symmetry. We develop a general formalism based on standard group\ntheory to construct local spin Hamiltonians invariant under any on-site\nsymmetry. We then specialize to the case of the simplest non-Abelian group,\n$S_3$, and numerically study a particular two parameter spin-1 Hamiltonian. We\nobserve a thermal phase and a many-body localized phase with a spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking (SSB) from $S_3$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ in our model Hamiltonian.\nWe diagnose these phases using full entanglement distributions and level\nstatistics. We also use a spin-glass diagnostic specialized to detect\nspontaneous breaking of the $S_3$ symmetry down to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Our observed\nphases are consistent with the possibilities outlined by Potter and Vasseur\n[Phys. Rev. B 94, 224206 (2016)], namely thermal/ ergodic and spin-glass\nmany-body localized (MBL) phases. We also speculate about the nature of an\nintermediate region between the thermal and MBL+SSB regions where full $S_3$\nsymmetry exists.\n", "  Context: Planetary embryos can continue to grow by pebble accretion until\nthey become giant planet cores. Simultaneously, these embryos mutually interact\nand also migrate due to torques arising from the protoplanetary disk.\n  Aims: Our aim is to investigate how pebble accretion alters the orbital\nevolution of embryos undergoing the Type-I migration. In particular, we study\nwhether they establish resonant chains, whether these chains are prone to\ninstabilities and if giant planet cores form through embryo merging, thus\noccurring more rapidly than by pebble accretion alone.\n  Methods: For the first time, we perform self-consistent global-scale\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations of a two-fluid protoplanetary disk\nconsisting of gas and pebbles, the latter being accreted by embedded embryos.\nAccretion heating, along with other radiative processes, is accounted for to\ncorrectly model the Type-I migration.\n  Results: We track the evolution of four super-Earth-like embryos, initially\nlocated in a region where the disk structure allows for a convergent migration.\nGenerally, embryo merging is facilitated by rapidly increasing embryo masses\nand breaks the otherwise oligarchic growth. Moreover, we find that the orbital\neccentricity of each embryo is considerably excited ($\\simeq0.03$) due to the\npresence of an asymmetric underdense lobe of gas, a so-called `hot trail',\nproduced by accretion heating of the embryo's vicinity. Eccentric orbits lead\nthe embryos to frequent close encounters and make resonant locking more\ndifficult.\n  Conclusions: Embryo merging typically produces one massive core ($\\gtrsim\n10\\,\\mathrm{M_{E}}$) in our simulations, orbiting near $10\\,\\mathrm{AU}$.\nPebble accretion is naturally accompanied by occurrence of eccentric orbits\nwhich should be considered in future efforts to explain the structure of\nexoplanetary systems.\n", "  In this work, we study neutron stars (NSs) in an ungravity (UG) inspired\nmodel. We examine the UG effects on the static properties of the selected NSs,\nin different mass and radius regimes, i.e., mini, moderate, and heavy NSs,\nusing a polytropic equation of state approach. Based on the observational data,\nwe obtain bounds on the characteristic length and scaling dimension of the UG\nmodel. Furthermore, we obtain dynamic properties, such as inertial moment (I),\nLove number (Love), and quadrupole moment (Q) of a slowly rotating NS in the\npresence of the exterior gravity and ungravity fields. The UG model is also\nexamined with respect to the I-Love-Q universal relation.\n", "  Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars bear important imprints of the early\nchemical enrichment of any stellar system. While these stars are known to exist\nin copious amounts in the Milky Way halo, detailed chemical abundance data from\nthe faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites are still sparse, although the\nrelative fraction of these stars increases with decreasing metallicity. Here,\nwe report the abundance analysis of a metal-poor ([Fe/H]=$-2.5$ dex),\ncarbon-rich ([C/Fe]=1.4 dex) star, ALW-8, in the Carina dSph using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the ESO/UVES instrument. Its\nspectrum does not indicate any over-enhancements of neutron capture elements.\nThus classified as a CEMP-no star, this is the first detection of this kind of\nstar in Carina. Another of our sample stars, ALW-1, is shown to be a CEMP-$s$\nstar, but its immediate binarity prompted us to discard it from a detailed\nanalysis. The majority of the 18 chemical elements we measured are typical of\nCarina's field star population and also agree with CEMP stars in other dSph\ngalaxies. Similar to the only known CEMP-no star in the Sculptor dSph and the\nweak-$r$-process star HD 122563, the lack of any strong barium-enhancement is\naccompanied by a moderate overabundance in yttrium, indicating a weak\n$r$-process activity. The overall abundance pattern confirms that, also in\nCarina, the formation site for CEMP-no stars has been affected by both faint\nsupernovae and by standard core collapse supernovae. Whichever process was\nresponsible for the heavy element production in ALW-8 must be a ubiquitous\nsource to pollute the CEMP-no stars, acting independently of the environment\nsuch as in the Galactic halo or in dSphs.\n", "  In the near future, neutrino telescopes are expected to improve their\nsensitivity to the flux of monochromatic neutrinos produced by dark matter (DM)\nin our galaxy. This is illustrated by a new limit on the corresponding cross\nsection that we derive from public IceCube data. In this context, we study\nwhich DM models could produce an observable flux of monochromatic neutrinos\nfrom DM annihilations. To this end, we proceed in two steps. First, within a\nset of simple and minimal assumptions concerning the properties of the DM\nparticle, we determine the models that could give rise to a significant\nannihilation into monochromatic neutrinos at the freeze-out epoch. The list of\nmodels turns out to be very limited as a result of various constraints, in\nparticular direct detection and neutrino masses at loop level. Given the fact\nthat, even if largely improved, the sensitivities will be far from reaching the\nthermal annihilation cross section soon, a signal could only be observed if the\nannihilation into neutrinos today is boosted with respect to the freeze-out\nepoch. This is why, in a second step, we analyze the possibility of having such\na large enhancement from the Sommerfeld effect. For each scenario, we also\ncompute the cross sections into other annihilation products and confront our\nresults with experimental constraints. We find that, within our simple and\nminimal assumptions, the expectation to observe monochromatic neutrinos is only\npossible in very specific scenarios. Some will be confirmed or excluded in the\nnear future because they predict signals slightly below the current\nexperimental sensitivities. We also discuss how these prospects change by\nrelaxing our assumptions as well as by considering other types of sharp\nspectral features. For the latter, we consider boxed-shaped and bremsstrahlung\nspectra and provide the corresponding limits from IceCube data.\n", "  A multidimensional generalization of Melvin's solution for an arbitrary\nsimple Lie algebra $\\cal G$ is considered. The gravitational model in $D$\ndimensions, $D \\geq 4$, contains $n$ 2-forms and $l \\geq n$ scalar fields,\nwhere $n$ is the rank of $\\cal G$. The solution is governed by a set of $n$\nfunctions $H_s(z)$ obeying $n$ ordinary differential equations with certain\nboundary conditions imposed. It was conjectured earlier that these functions\nshould be polynomials (the so-called fluxbrane polynomials). The polynomials\n$H_s(z)$, $s = 1,\\dots,6$, for the Lie algebra $E_6$ are obtained and a\ncorresponding solution for $l = n = 6$ is presented. The polynomials depend\nupon integration constants $Q_s$, $s = 1,\\dots,6$. They obey symmetry and\nduality identities. The latter ones are used in deriving asymptotic relations\nfor solutions at large distances. The power-law asymptotic relations for\n$E_6$-polynomials at large $z$ are governed by integer-valued matrix $\\nu =\nA^{-1} (I + P)$, where $A^{-1}$ is the inverse Cartan matrix, $I$ is the\nidentity matrix and $P$ is permutation matrix, corresponding to a generator of\nthe $Z_2$-group of symmetry of the Dynkin diagram. The 2-form fluxes $\\Phi^s$,\n$s = 1,\\dots,6$, are calculated.\n", "  A self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism in tokamaks that maintains\nthe core safety factor at $q\\approx 1$, thus preventing sawteeth, is analyzed\nin nonlinear 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the M3D-C$^1$ code. In\nthese simulations, the most important mechanism responsible for the flux\npumping is that a saturated $(m=1,n=1)$ quasi-interchange instability generates\nan effective negative loop voltage in the plasma center via a dynamo effect. It\nis shown that sawtoothing is prevented in the simulations if $\\beta$ is\nsufficiently high to provide the necessary drive for the $(m=1,n=1)$\ninstability that generates the dynamo loop voltage. The necessary amount of\ndynamo loop voltage is determined by the tendency of the current density\nprofile to centrally peak which, in our simulations, is controlled by the\npeakedness of the applied heat source profile.\n", "  Loop regularization (LORE) is a novel regularization scheme in modern quantum\nfield theories. It makes no change to the spacetime structure and respects both\ngauge symmetries and supersymmetry. As a result, LORE should be useful in\ncalculating loop corrections in supersymmetry phenomenology. To demonstrate\nfurther its power, in this article we revisit in the light of LORE the old\nissue of the absence of quadratic contributions (quadratic divergences) in\nsoftly broken supersymmetric field theories. It is shown explicitly by Feynman\ndiagrammatic calculations that up to two loops the Wess-Zumino model with soft\nsupersymmetry breaking terms (WZ' model), one of the simplest models with the\nexplicit supersymmetry breaking, is free of quadratic contributions. All the\nquadratic contributions cancel with each other perfectly, which is consistent\nwith results dictated by the supergraph techniques.\n", "  The glueball spectrum has attracted much attention since the formulation of\nQuantum Chromodynamics. Different approaches give very different results for\ntheir masses. We revisit the problem from the perspective of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\n", "  We analyze the collider sensitivity for new colored resonances in $t\\bar{t}$,\n$b \\bar{b}$, and $jj$ final states. While searches in the single production\nchannel are model-dependent, the pair production rate is model independent and\nthe existing $(JJ)(JJ)$ and $4t$ searches impose strong constraints on the\nrelevant branching fractions, where $J = j$ or $b$. We point out the missing,\ncomplementary searches in the mixed decay modes, $t\\bar{t}(jj)$,\n$t\\bar{t}(b\\bar{b})$, and $(b\\bar{b})(jj)$. We propose analysis strategies for\nthe $t\\bar{t}(jj)$ and $t\\bar{t}(b\\bar{b})$ decays and find their sensivity\nsurpasses that of existing searches when the decay widths to tops and light\njets are comparable. If no other decays are present, collective lower limits on\nthe resonance mass can be set at 1.5~TeV using 37~fb$^{-1}$ of 13~TeV data.\n", "  We investigate the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the\nstellar mass (M), i.e. the Main Sequence (MS) relation of star-forming\ngalaxies, at 1.3<=z<6 in the first four HST Frontier Fields, based on\nrest-frame UV observations. Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST\nobservations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to stellar masses\nas low as logM/Msun~7.5 at z<~4 and logM/Msun~8 at higher redshifts, a factor\nof ~10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take\ninto account the effect of observational uncertainties on the MS and correct\nfor the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in\nparticular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit\nan unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses\nthe results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and\nby making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of\nthe dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter\ndecreases with increasing stellar masses, suggesting a larger variety of star\nformation histories in low mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical\npredictions, and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of\nprogenitors of low mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the\nefficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low mass halos.\nFinally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift\nmilder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete\nunderstanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.\n", "  Recently it has been aroused a great interest about explosive (i.e.,\ndiscontinuous) transitions. They manifest in distinct systems, such as\nsynchronization in coupled oscillators, percolation regime, absorbing phase\ntransitions and more recently, in the majority-vote (MV) model with inertia. In\nthe latter, the model rules are slightly modified by the inclusion of a term\ndepending on the local spin (an inertial term). In such case, Chen et al. (Phys\nRev. E {5}, 042304 (2017)) have found that relevant inertia changes the nature\nof the phase transition in complex networks, from continuous to discontinuous.\nHere we give a further step by embedding inertia only in vertices with degree\nlarger than a threshold value $\\langle k \\rangle k^*$, $\\langle k \\rangle$\nbeing the mean system degree and $k^*$ the fraction restriction. Our results,\nfrom mean-field analysis and extensive numerical simulations, reveal that an\nexplosive transition is presented in both homogeneous and heterogeneous\nstructures for small and intermediate $k^*$'s. Otherwise, large restriction can\nsustain a discontinuous transition only in the heterogeneous case. This shares\nsome similarity with recent results for the Kuramoto model (Phys Rev. E {91},\n022818 (2015)). Surprisingly, intermediate restriction and large inertia are\nresponsible for the emergence of an extra phase, in which the system is\npartially synchronized and the classification of phase transition depends on\nthe inertia and the lattice topology. In this case, the system exhibits two\nphase transitions.\n", "  We analyze quantum criticality at finite temperature for a class of non-Fermi\nliquids with massless bosons. Finite temperature gives rise to new infrared\nsingularities that invalidate standard perturbative treatments. We show how\nsuch divergences are resolved at a non-perturbative level, and obtain the\nresulting fermion self-energy. This leads to a new \"thermal\" non-Fermi liquid\nregime that extends over a wide range of frequencies, and which is absent from\nthe zero temperature critical point. We analyze the resulting quantum critical\nregion and properties of the retarded Green's function. More generally, such\neffects dominate in the nearly static limit and are expected to have a\nnontrivial impact on superconductivity and transport.\n", "  Analytic expressions for the two dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SLFT blocks in\nthe light semi-classical limit are found for both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond\nsectors. The calculations are done by using the duality between $SU(2)$\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ super-symmetric gauge theories living on $R^4/Z_2$ space and\ntwo dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ super Liouville field theory. It is shown that\nin the light asymptotic limit only a restricted set of Young diagrams\ncontribute to the partition function. This enables us to sum up the instanton\nseries explicitly and find closed expressions for the corresponding\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ SLFT four point blocks in the light asymptotic limit.\n", "  We generalized our model for the description of hard processes, and calculate\nthe value of the azimuthal angle correlations ( Fourier harmonics $v_n$ ), for\nproton-proton scattering.The energy and multiplicity independence, as well as\nthe value of $v_n$, turn out the be in accord with the experimental data, or\nslightly larger.\n  Therefore, before making extreme assumptions on proton-proton collisions,\nsuch as the production of quark-gluon plasma in the large multiplicity events,\nwe need to explain how these effect theBose-Einstein correlations which are so\nlarge, that have to be taken into account, and which are able to describe the\nangular correlations in proton-proton collisions, without including final state\ninteractions\n", "  Using non-relativistic effective Lagrangians in the particle-dimer picture,\nwe rederive the expression for the energy shift of a loosely bound\nthree-particle bound state of identical bosons in the unitary limit. The\neffective field theory formalism allows us to investigate the role of the\nthree-particle force, which has not been taken into account in the earlier\ntreatment of the problem. Moreover, we are able to relax the requirement of the\nunitary limit of infinite scattering length and demonstrate a smooth transition\nfrom the weakly bound three-particle state to a two-particle bound state of a\nparticle and a deeply bound dimer.\n", "  We introduce a mirror copy of the ordinary fermions and Higgs scalars for\nembedding the $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ electroweak gauge symmetry into an\n$SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ left-right gauge symmetry. We then\nshow the spontaneous left-right symmetry breaking can automatically break the\nparity symmetry motivated by solving the strong CP problem. Through the\n$SU(2)_R$ gauge interactions, a mirror Majorana neutrino can decay into a\nmirror charged lepton and two mirror quarks. Consequently we can obtain a\nlepton asymmetry stored in the mirror charged leptons. The Yukawa couplings of\nthe mirror and ordinary charged fermions to a dark matter scalar then can\ntransfer the mirror lepton asymmetry to an ordinary lepton asymmetry which\nprovides a solution to the cosmic baryon asymmetry in association with the\n$SU(2)_L$ sphaleron processes. In this scenario, the baryon asymmetry can be\nwell described by the neutrino mass matrix up to an overall factor.\n", "  We study different phenomenological signatures associated with new spin-2\nparticles. These new degrees of freedom, that we call hidden gravitons, arise\nin different high-energy theories such as extra-dimensional models or\nextensions of General Relativity. At low energies, hidden gravitons can be\ngenerally described by the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian. Their phenomenology is\nparameterized by two dimensionful constants: their mass and their coupling\nstrength. In this work, we analyze two different sets of constraints. On the\none hand, we study potential deviations from the inverse-square law on\nsolar-system and laboratory scales. To extend the constraints to scales where\nthe laboratory probes are not competitive, we also study consequences on\nastrophysical objects. We analyze in detail the processes that may take place\nin stellar interiors and lead to emission of hidden gravitons, acting like an\nadditional source of energy loss.\n", "  A generalized Melvin solution for an arbitrary simple finite-dimensional Lie\nalgebra $\\cal G$ is considered. The solution contains a metric, $n$ Abelian\n2-forms and $n$ scalar fields, where $n$ is the rank of $\\cal G$. It is\ngoverned by a set of $n$ moduli functions $H_s(z)$ obeying $n$ ordinary\ndifferential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. It was\nconjectured earlier that these functions should be polynomials - the so-called\nfluxbrane polynomials. These polynomials depend upon integration constants\n$q_s$, $s = 1,\\dots,n$. In the case when the conjecture on the polynomial\nstructure for the Lie algebra $\\cal G$ is satisfied, it is proved that 2-form\nflux integrals $\\Phi^s$ over a proper $2d$ submanifold are finite and obey the\nrelations: $q_s \\Phi^s = 4 \\pi n_s h_s$, where $h_s > 0$ are certain constants\n(related to dilatonic coupling vectors) and $n_s$ are powers of the\npolynomials, which are components of a twice dual Weyl vector in the basis of\nsimple (co-)roots, $s = 1,\\dots,n$. The main relations of the paper are valid\nfor a solution corresponding to a finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra\n$\\cal G$. Examples of polynomials and fluxes for the Lie algebras $A_1$, $A_2$,\n$A_3$, $C_2$, $G_2$ and $A_1 + A_1$ are presented.\n", "  We study the time development of strongly coupled ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric\nYang Mills (SYM) theory on cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nbackgrounds via the AdS/CFT correspondence. We implement the cosmological\nbackground as a boundary metric fulfilling the Friedmann equation with a\nfour-dimensional cosmological constant and a dark radiation term. We analyze\nthe dual bulk solution of the type IIB supergravity and find that the\ntime-dependence of the FRW background strongly influences the dynamical\nproperties of the SYM theory. We in particular find a phase transition between\na confined and a deconfined phase. We also argue that some cosmological\nsolutions could be related to the inflationary scenario.\n", "  The magnetic properties and magnetic structure are presented for CoPS$_3$, a\nquasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice with a N\\'eel\ntemperature of $T_N \\sim 120$ K. The compound is shown to have XY-like\nanisotropy in its susceptibility, and the anisotropy is analysed to extract\ncrystal field parameters. For temperatures between 2 K and 300 K, no phase\ntransitions were observed in the field-dependent magnetization up to 10 Tesla.\nSingle-crystal neutron diffraction shows that the magnetic propagation vector\nis {\\bf{k}}= $\\left[010\\right]$ with the moments mostly along the $\\mathbf{a}$\naxis and with a small component along the $\\mathbf{c}$ axis, which largely\nverifies the previously-published magnetic structure for this compound. The\nmagnetic Bragg peak intensity decreases with increasing temperature as a power\nlaw with exponent $2\\beta = 0.60 \\pm 0.01$ for $T > 0.9~T_N$.\n", "  We have measured the magnetization of the organic compound BIP-BNO\n(3,5'-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3',5-dibromobiphenyl) up to 76 T where the\nmagnetization is saturated. The S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg two-leg\nspin-ladder model accounts for the obtained experimental data regarding the\nmagnetization curve, which is clarified using the quantum Monte Carlo method.\nThe exchange constants on the rung and the side rail of the ladder are\nestimated to be J(rung)/kB = 65.7 K and J(leg)/kB = 14.1 K, respectively,\ndeeply in the strong coupling region: J(rung)/J(leg) > 1.\n", "  We calculate the (semi-)static hard-loop self-energy and propagator using the\nKeldysh formalism in a momentum-space anisotropic quark-gluon plasma. The\nstatic retarded, advanced, and Feynman (symmetric) self-energies and\npropagators are calculated to all orders in the momentum-space anisotropy\nparameter $\\xi$. For the retarded and advanced self-energies/propagators, we\npresent a concise derivation and comparison with previously-obtained results\nand extend the calculation of the self-energies to next-to-leading order in the\ngluon energy, $\\omega$. For the Feynman self-energy/propagator, we present new\nresults which are accurate to all orders in $\\xi$. We compare our exact results\nwith prior expressions for the Feynman self-energy/propagator which were\nobtained using Taylor-expansions around an isotropic state. We show that,\nunlike the Taylor-expanded results, the all-orders expression for the Feynman\npropagator is free from infrared singularities. Finally, we discuss the\napplication of our results to the calculation of the imaginary-part of the\nheavy-quark potential in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  Linearized gravity is considered as an ordinary gauge field theory. This\nimplies the need for gauge fixing in order to have well defined propagators.\nOnly after having achieved this, the most general mass term is added. The aim\nof this paper is to study of the degrees of freedom of the gauge fixed theory\nof linearized gravity with mass term. The main result is that, even outside the\nusual Fierz-Pauli constraint on the mass term, it is possible to choose a gauge\nfixing belonging to the Landau class, which leads to a massive theory of\ngravity with the five degrees of freedom of a spin two massive particle.\n", "  The Cosmic Ray (CR) physics has entered a new era driven by high precision\nmeasurements coming from direct detection (especially AMS-02 and PAMELA) and\nalso from gamma-ray observations (Fermi-LAT). In this review we focus our\nattention on how such data impact the understanding of the supernova remnant\nparadigm for the origin of CRs. In particular we discuss advancement in the\nfield concerning the three main stages of the CR life: the acceleration\nprocess, the escape from the sources and the propagation throughout the Galaxy.\nWe show how the new data reveal a phenomenology richest than previously thought\nthat could even challenge the current understanding of CR origin.\n", "  N=4 supersymmetric extensions of the l-conformal Galilei algebra are\nconstructed by properly extending the Lie superalgebra associated with the most\ngeneral N=4 superconformal group in one dimension D(2,1;a). If the acceleration\ngenerators in the superalgebra form analogues of the irreducible (1,4,3)-,\n(2,4,2)-, (3,4,1)-, and (4,4,0)-supermultiplets of D(2,1;a), the parameter a\nturns out to be constrained by the Jacobi identities. In contrast, if the tower\nof the acceleration generators resembles a component decomposition of a generic\nreal superfield, which is a reducible representation of D(2,1;a), a remains\narbitrary. An N=4 l-conformal Galilei superalgebra recently proposed in [Phys.\nLett. B 771 (2017) 401] is shown to be a particular instance of a more general\nconstruction in this work.\n", "  We provide a systematic renormalization group formalism for the mass effects\nin the relation of the pole mass $m_Q^{\\rm pole}$ and short-distance masses\nsuch as the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ mass $\\overline{m}_Q$ of a heavy quark $Q$,\ncoming from virtual loop insertions of massive quarks lighter than $Q$. The\nformalism reflects the constraints from heavy quark symmetry and entails a\ncombined matching and evolution procedure that allows to disentangle and\nsuccessively integrate out the corrections coming from the lighter massive\nquarks and the momentum regions between them and to precisely control the large\norder asymptotic behavior. With the formalism we systematically sum logarithms\nof ratios of the lighter quark masses and $m_Q$, relate the QCD corrections for\ndifferent external heavy quarks to each other, predict the ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s^4)$ virtual quark mass corrections in the pole-$\\overline{\\rm MS}$\nmass relation, calculate the pole mass differences for the top, bottom and\ncharm quarks with a precision of around $20$ MeV and analyze the decoupling of\nthe lighter massive quark flavors at large orders. The summation of logarithms\nis most relevant for the top quark pole mass $m_t^{\\rm pole}$, where the\nhierarchy to the bottom and charm quarks is large. We determine the ambiguity\nof the pole mass for top, bottom and charm quarks in different scenarios with\nmassive or massless bottom and charm quarks in a way consistent with heavy\nquark symmetry, and we find that it is $250$ MeV. The ambiguity is larger than\ncurrent projections for the precision of top quark mass measurements in the\nhigh-luminosity phase of the LHC.\n", "  We have studied, in bilayer graphene (BLG), the hot electron cooling power\n$F_{VP} (T, n_s)$ due to acoustic phonons via vector potential (VP) coupling.\nIt is calculated as a function of electron concentration $ns$ and temperature\n$T$ and compared with $F_{DP} (T, n_s)$ that due to deformation potential\ncoupling. For the $n_s$ around $1\\times10^{12} cm^{-2}$, $F_{VP} (T, n_s)$ is\nmuch smaller than $F_{DP} (T, n_s)$ . With increase of $n_s$, $F_{DP} (T, n_s)$\ndecreases faster than $F_{VP} (T, n_s)$ does. A cross over is predicted and\ndominant contribution of $F_{VP} (T, n_s)$ can be observed at large $n_s$. In\nthe Bloch- Gr\\\"uneisen (BG) regime $F_{VP} (T, n_s)~ n_s^{-1/2}$ and $F_{DP}\n(T, n_s)~ n_s^{-3/2}$. Both $F_{VP} (T, n_s)$ and $F_{DP} (T, n_s)$ have the\nsame $T$ dependence with $T^4$ power law in BG regime. Behaviour of $F_{DP} (T,\nn_s)~ n_s^{-3/2}$ and $T^4$ is in agreement with the experimental results at\nmoderate $n_s$. Besides, in BG regime, we have predicted, for both the VP and\nDP coupling, a relation between $F(T, n_s)$ and the acoustic phonon limited\nmobility $\\mu_p$, opening a new door to determine $\\mu_p$ from the measurements\nof $F(T, n_s)$.\n", "  Extremely strong magnetic fields of the order of $10^{15}\\,{\\rm G}$ are\nrequired to explain the properties of magnetars, the most magnetic neutron\nstars. Such a strong magnetic field is expected to play an important role for\nthe dynamics of core-collapse supernovae, and in the presence of rapid rotation\nmay power superluminous supernovae and hypernovae associated to long gamma-ray\nbursts. The origin of these strong magnetic fields remains, however, obscure\nand most likely requires an amplification over many orders of magnitude in the\nprotoneutron star. One of the most promising agents is the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI), which can in principle amplify exponentially fast a weak\ninitial magnetic field to a dynamically relevant strength. We describe our\ncurrent understanding of the MRI in protoneutron stars and show recent results\non its dependence on physical conditions specific to protoneutron stars such as\nneutrino radiation, strong buoyancy effects and large magnetic Prandtl number.\n", "  The fast Ewald methods are widely used to compute the point-charge\nelectrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. The key step that\nintroduces errors in the computation is the particle-mesh interpolation. In\nthis work, the optimal interpolation basis is derived by minimizing the\nestimated error of the fast Ewald method. The basis can be either general or\nmodel specific, depending on whether or not the charge correlation has been\ntaken into account. By using the TIP3P water as an example system, we\ndemonstrate that the general optimal basis is always more accurate than the\nB-spline basis in the investigated parameter range, while the computational\ncost is at most 5\\% more expensive. In some cases, the optimal basis is found\nto be two orders of magnitude more accurate. The model specific optimal basis\nfurther improves the accuracy of the general optimal basis, but requires more\ncomputational effort in the optimization, and may not be transferable to\nsystems with different charge correlations. Therefore, the choice between the\ngeneral and model specific optimal bases is a trade-off between the generality\nand the accuracy.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an array of nearest-neighbor coupled spatially\ndistributed systems each generating a periodic sequence of short pulses. We\ndemonstrate that unlike a solitary system generating a train of equidistant\npulses, an array of such systems can produce a sequence of clusters of closely\npacked pulses, with the distance between individual pulses depending on the\ncoupling phase. This regime associated with the formation of locally coupled\npulse trains bounded due to a balance of attraction and repulsion between them\nis different from the pulse bound states reported earlier in different laser,\nplasma, chemical, and biological systems. We propose a simplified analytical\ndescription of the observed phenomenon, which is in a good agreement with the\nresults of direct numerical simulations of a model system describing an array\nof coupled mode-locked lasers.\n", "  By following the evolution of several observed exoplanetary systems we show\nthat by lowering the mass loss rate of single solar-like stars during their two\ngiant branches, these stars will swallow their planets at the tip of their\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. This will most likely lead the stars to\nform elliptical planetary nebulae (PNe). Under the traditional mass loss rate\nthese stars will hardly form observable PNe. Stars with a lower mass loss rate\nas we propose, about 15 per cent of the traditional mass loss rate of single\nstars, leave the AGB with much higher luminosities than what traditional\nevolution produces. Hence, the assumed lower mass loss rate might also account\nfor the presence of bright PNe in old stellar populations. We present the\nevolution of four exoplanetary systems that represent stellar masses in the\nrange of 0.9-1.3 Mo. The justification for this low mass loss rate is our\nassumption that the stellar samples that were used to derive the traditional\naverage single-star mass loss rate were contaminated by stars that suffer\nbinary interaction.\n", "  Aims. Infrared dark clouds represent the earliest stages of high-mass star\nformation. Detailed observations of their physical conditions on all physical\nscales are required to improve our understanding of their role in fueling star\nformation.\n  Methods. We investigate the large-scale structure of the IRDC G035.39-00.33,\nprobing the dense gas with the classical ammonia thermometer. This allows us to\nput reliable constraints on the temperature of the extended, pc-scale dense gas\nreservoir and to probe the magnitude of its non-thermal motions. Available\nfar-infrared observations can be used in tandem with the observed ammonia\nemission to estimate the total gas mass contained in G035.39-00.33.\n  Results. We identify a main velocity component as a prominent filament,\nmanifested as an ammonia emission intensity ridge spanning more than 6 pc,\nconsistent with the previous studies on the Northern part of the cloud. A\nnumber of additional line-of-sight components are found, and a large scale,\nlinear velocity gradient of ~0.2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is found along the ridge\nof the IRDC. In contrast to the dust temperature map, an ammonia-derived\nkinetic temperature map, presented for the entirety of the cloud, reveals local\ntemperature enhancements towards the massive protostellar cores. We show that\nwithout properly accounting for the line of sight contamination, the dust\ntemperature is 2-3 K larger than the gas temperature measured with NH$_3$.\n  Conclusions. While both the large scale kinematics and temperature structure\nare consistent with that of starless dark filaments, the kinetic gas\ntemperature profile on smaller scales is suggestive of tracing the heating\nmechanism coincident with the locations of massive protostellar cores.\n", "  We study the problem of the crystal formation in the vacuum.\n", "  The thermodynamical properties of a neutral vector boson gas in a constant\nmagnetic field are studied starting from the spectrum given by Proca formalism.\nBose Einstein Condensation (BEC) and magnetization are obtained, for the three\nand one dimensional cases, in the limit of low temperatures. In three\ndimensions the gas undergoes a phase transition to an usual BEC in which the\ncritical temperature depends on the magnetic field. In one dimension a diffuse\ncondensate appears as for the charged vector boson gas. In both cases, the\ncondensation is reached not only by decreasing the temperature but also by\nincreasing the magnetic field. In three and one dimensions self-magnetization\nis possible. The anisotropy in the pressures due to axial symmetry imposed to\nthe system by the magnetic field is also discussed. The astrophysical\nimplications are commented.\n", "  To analyze spectra of hot stars, advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) model-atmosphere techniques are mandatory. Reliable atomic data is for\nthe calculation of such model atmospheres.\n  We aim to calculate new Sr IV - VII oscillator strengths to identify for the\nfirst time Sr spectral lines in hot white dwarf (WD) stars and to determine the\nphotospheric Sr abundances. o measure the abundances of Se, Te, and I in hot\nWDs, we aim to compute new Se V, Te VI, and I VI oscillator strengths.\n  To consider radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions of Se V, Sr IV\n- VII, Te VI, and I VI in our NLTE atmosphere models, we calculated oscillator\nstrengths for these ions.\n  We newly identified four Se V, 23 Sr V, 1 Te VI, and three I VI lines in the\nultraviolet (UV) spectrum of RE0503-289. We measured a photospheric Sr\nabundance of 6.5 +3.8/-2.4 x 10**-4 (mass fraction, 9500 - 23800 times solar).\nWe determined the abundances of Se (1.6 +0.9/-0.6 x 10**-3, 8000 - 20000), Te\n(2.5 +1.5/-0.9 x 10**-4, 11000 - 28000), and I (1.4 +0.8/-0.5 x 10**-5, 2700 -\n6700). No Se, Sr, Te, and I line was found in the UV spectra of G191-B2B and we\ncould determine only upper abundance limits of approximately 100 times solar.\n  All identified Se V, Sr V, Te VI, and I VI lines in the UV spectrum of\nRE0503-289 were simultaneously well reproduced with our newly calculated\noscillator strengths.\n", "  The response of a quadrupolar nucleus (nuclear spin with I>1/2) to an\noscillating radio-frequency (RF) pulse/field is delicately dependent on the\nratio of the quadrupolar coupling constant to the amplitude of the pulse in\naddition to its duration and oscillating frequency. Consequently, analytic\ndescription of the excitation process in the density operator formalism has\nremained less transparent within existing theoretical frameworks. As an\nalternative, the utility of the \"concept of effective Floquet Hamiltonians\" is\nexplored in the present study to explicate the nuances of the excitation\nprocess in multilevel systems. Employing spin I=3/2 as a case study, a unified\ntheoretical framework for describing the excitation of multiple-quantum (MQ)\ntransitions in static isotropic and anisotropic solids is proposed within the\nframework of perturbation theory. The challenges resulting from the anisotropic\nnature of the quadrupolar interactions are addressed within the effective\nHamiltonian framework. The possible role of the various interaction frames on\nthe convergence of the perturbation corrections is discussed along with a\nproposal for a \"hybrid method\" for describing the excitation process in\nanisotropic solids. Employing suitable model systems, the validity of the\nproposed hybrid method is substantiated through a rigorous comparison between\nsimulations emerging from exact numerical and analytic methods.\n", "  The present paper deals with the numerical solution of the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations using high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods\nfor discretization in space. For DG methods applied to the dual splitting\nprojection method, instabilities have recently been reported that occur for\ncoarse spatial resolutions and small time step sizes. By means of numerical\ninvestigation we give evidence that these instabilities are related to the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin formulation of the velocity divergence term and the\npressure gradient term that couple velocity and pressure. Integration by parts\nof these terms with a suitable definition of boundary conditions is required in\norder to obtain a stable and robust method. Since the intermediate velocity\nfield does not fulfill the boundary conditions prescribed for the velocity, a\nconsistent boundary condition is derived from the convective step of the dual\nsplitting scheme to ensure high-order accuracy with respect to the temporal\ndiscretization. This new formulation is stable in the limit of small time steps\nfor both equal-order and mixed-order polynomial approximations. Although the\ndual splitting scheme itself includes inf-sup stabilizing contributions, we\ndemonstrate that spurious pressure oscillations appear for equal-order\npolynomials and small time steps highlighting the necessity to consider inf-sup\nstability explicitly.\n", "  Phonon-assisted tunneling plays a crucial role for electronic device\nperformance and even more so with future size down-scaling. We show how one can\ninclude this effect in large-scale first-principles calculations using a single\n\"special thermal displacement\" (STD) of the atomic coordinates at almost the\nsame cost as elastic transport calculations. We apply the method to\nultra-scaled silicon devices and demonstrate the importance of phonon-assisted\nband-to-band and source-to-drain tunneling. In a diode the phonons lead to a\nrectification ratio suppression in good agreement with experiments, while in an\nultra-thin body transistor the phonons increase off-currents by four orders of\nmagnitude, and the subthreshold swing by a factor of four, in agreement with\nperturbation theory.\n", "  In this paper we study a modified version of unimodular general relativity in\nthe context of $f(G)$, $G$ denoting the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We attach\nattention to Bianchi-type I and Friendmann-Robertson-Walker universes and\nsearch for unimodular $f(G)$ models according to the de Sitter and power-law\nsolutions. Assuming unimodular $f(G)$ gravity as perfect fluid and making use\nof the slow-roll parameters, inflationary model has been reconstructed in\nconcordance with the Planck observational data. Moreover, we investigate the\nrealization of the bounce and loop quantum cosmological ekpyrotic paradigms.\nAssuming suitable and appropriated scale factors, unimodular $f(G)$ models able\nto reproduce superbounce and ekpyrotic scenarios have been reconstructed.\n", "  In this work, we study the accuracy and efficiency of hierarchical matrix\n($\\mathcal{H}$-matrix) based fast methods for solving dense linear systems\narising from the discretization of the 3D elastodynamic Green's tensors. It is\nwell known in the literature that standard $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix based methods,\nalthough very efficient tools for asymptotically smooth kernels, are not\noptimal for oscillatory kernels. $\\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix and directional\napproaches have been proposed to overcome this problem. However the\nimplementation of such methods is much more involved than the standard\n$\\mathcal{H}$-matrix representation. The central questions we address are\ntwofold. (i) What is the frequency-range in which the $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix\nformat is an efficient representation for 3D elastodynamic problems? (ii) What\ncan be expected of such an approach to model problems in mechanical\nengineering? We show that even though the method is not optimal (in the sense\nthat more involved representations can lead to faster algorithms) an efficient\nsolver can be easily developed. The capabilities of the method are illustrated\non numerical examples using the Boundary Element Method.\n", "  We relate the recent derivation of the linearised Einstein equation on an AdS\nbackground from holographic entanglement entropy arguments to the Sparling\nconstruction: we derive the differential form whose exterior derivative gives\nthe Einstein equation from the Sparling formalism. We develop the study of\nperturbations within the context of the Sparling formalism and find that the\nSparling form vanishes for linearised perturbations on flat space.\n", "  Recent experiments studying the meson-nucleus interaction to extract\nmeson-nucleus potentials are reviewed. The real part of the potentials\nquantifies whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive while the\nimaginary part describes the meson absorption in nuclei. The review is focused\non mesons which are sufficiently long-lived to potentially form meson-nucleus\nquasi-bound states. The presentation is confined to meson production off nuclei\nin photon-, pion-, proton-, and light-ion induced reactions and heavy-ion\ncollisions at energies near the production threshold. Tools to extract the\npotential parameters are presented. In most cases, the real part of the\npotential is determined by comparing measured meson momentum distributions or\nexcitation functions with collision model or transport model calculations. The\nimaginary part is extracted from transparency ratio measurements. Results on\n$K^+, K^0, K^-, \\eta, \\eta^\\prime, \\omega$, and $\\phi$ mesons are presented and\ncompared with theoretical predictions. The interaction of $K^+$ and $K^0$\nmesons with nuclei is found to be weakly repulsive, while the $K^-,\n\\eta,\\eta^\\prime, \\omega$ and $\\phi$ meson-nucleus potentials are attractive,\nhowever, with widely different strengths. Because of meson absorption in the\nnuclear medium the imaginary parts of the meson-nucleus potentials are all\nnegative, again with a large spread. An outlook on planned experiments in the\ncharm sector is given. In view of the determined potential parameters, the\ncriteria and chances for experimentally observing meson-nucleus quasi-bound\nstates are discussed. The most promising candidates appear to be the $\\eta$ and\n$\\eta^\\prime$ mesons.\n", "  We construct solutions of IIB supergravity dual to non-supersymmetric states\nof the D1D5 system. These solutions are constructed as perturbations carrying\nboth left and right moving momentum around the maximally rotating D1D5 ground\nstate at linear order. They are found by extending to the asymptotically flat\nregion the geometry generated in the decoupling limit by the action of left and\nright R-currents on a known D1D5 microstate. The perturbations are regular\neverywhere and do not carry any global charge. We also study the near-extremal\nlimit of the solutions and derive the first non-trivial correction to the\nextremal geometry.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction between two magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals with arbitrary\nmonopole charge $Q$. We find that the RKKY interaction becomes intrinsically\nanisotropic for $Q\\geq2$, and its dependence on Fermi energy and impurity\nseparation is directly controlled by the monopole charge. With the increase of\n$Q$, the RKKY interaction becomes more long-ranged and more anisotropic, which\nmakes interesting magnetic orders easier to form and thus may have important\napplications in spintronics.\n", "  Hamiltonian Truncation (a.k.a. Truncated Spectrum Approach) is a numerical\ntechnique for solving strongly coupled QFTs, in which the full Hilbert space is\ntruncated to a finite-dimensional low-energy subspace. The accuracy of the\nmethod is limited only by the available computational resources. The\nrenormalization program improves the accuracy by carefully integrating out the\nhigh-energy states, instead of truncating them away. In this paper we develop\nthe most accurate ever variant of Hamiltonian Truncation, which implements\nrenormalization at the cubic order in the interaction strength. The novel idea\nis to interpret the renormalization procedure as a result of integrating out\nexactly a certain class of high-energy \"tail states\". We demonstrate the power\nof the method with high-accuracy computations in the strongly coupled\ntwo-dimensional quartic scalar theory, and benchmark it against other existing\napproaches. Our work will also be useful for the future goal of extending\nHamiltonian Truncation to higher spacetime dimensions.\n", "  Traditional data cleaning identifies dirty data by classifying original data\nsequences, which is a class$-$imbalanced problem since the proportion of\nincorrect data is much less than the proportion of correct ones for most\ndiagnostic systems in Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices. When using\nmachine learning algorithms to classify diagnostic data based on\nclass$-$imbalanced training set, most classifiers are biased towards the major\nclass and show very poor classification rates on the minor class. By\ntransforming the direct classification problem about original data sequences\ninto a classification problem about the physical similarity between data\nsequences, the class$-$balanced effect of Time$-$Domain Global Similarity\n(TDGS) method on training set structure is investigated in this paper.\nMeanwhile, the impact of improved training set structure on data cleaning\nperformance of TDGS method is demonstrated with an application example in EAST\nPOlarimetry$-$INTerferometry (POINT) system.\n", "  The soft anomalous dimension governs the infrared singularities of scattering\namplitudes to all orders in perturbative quantum field theory, and is a crucial\ningredient in both formal and phenomenological applications of non-abelian\ngauge theories. It has recently been computed at three-loop order for massless\npartons by explicit evaluation of all relevant Feynman diagrams. In this paper,\nwe show how the same result can be obtained, up to an overall numerical factor,\nusing a bootstrap procedure. We first give a geometrical argument for the fact\nthat the result can be expressed in terms of single-valued harmonic\npolylogarithms. We then use symmetry considerations as well as known properties\nof scattering amplitudes in collinear and high-energy (Regge) limits to\nconstrain an ansatz of basis functions. This is a highly non-trivial\ncross-check of the result, and our methods pave the way for greatly simplified\nhigher-order calculations.\n", "  Chern insulators exhibit fascinating properties which originate from the\ntopologically nontrivial state characterized by the Chern number. How these\nproperties change if the system is quenched between topologically distinct\nphases has however not been systematically explored. In this work, we\ninvestigate the quench dynamics of the prototypical massive Dirac model for\ntopological insu- lators in two dimensions. We consider both dissipation-less\ndynamics and the effect of electron- phonon interactions, and ask how the\ntransient dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states affect simple observables.\nSpecifically, we discuss a time-dependent generalization of the Hall effect and\nthe dichroism of the photoexcitation probability between left and right\ncircularly polarized light. We present optimized schemes based on these\nobservables, which can reveal the evolution of the topological state of the\nquenched system.\n", "  Coulometric measurements on salt-water-immersed nanoporous carbon electrodes\nreveal, at a fixed voltage, a charge decrease with increasing temperature.\nDuring far-out-of-equilibrium charging of these electrodes, calorimetry\nindicates the production of both irreversible Joule heat and reversible heat,\nthe latter being associated with entropy changes during electric double layer\n(EDL) formation in the nanopores. These measurements grant experimental access\n--for the first time-- to the entropic contribution of the grand potential; for\nour electrodes, this amounts to roughly 25% of the total grand potential energy\ncost of EDL formation at large applied potentials, in contrast with\npoint-charge model calculations that predict 100%. The coulometric and\ncalorimetric experiments show a consistent picture of the role of heat and\ntemperature in EDL formation and provide hitherto unused information to test\nagainst EDL models.\n", "  We investigate the role that nonlinearity in the interatomic potential has on\nthe thermal conductance of a suspended nanoribbon when it is subjected to a\nlongitudinal strain. To focus on the first cubic and quartic nonlinear terms of\na general potential, we propose an atomic system based on an $\\alpha$-$\\beta$\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam nearest neighbor interaction.\n  We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the\ncontribution of longitudinal, transversal and flexural modes to the thermal\nconductance as a function of the $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ parameters and the applied\nstrain. We compare the cases where atoms are allowed to vibrate only {\\it in}\nplane (2D) with the case of vibrations {\\it in} and {\\it out} of plane (3D). We\nfind that the dependence of conductance on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ relies on a\ncrossover phenomenon between linear/nonlinear delocalized/localized flexural\nand transversal modes, driven by an on/off switch of the strain.\n", "  In this paper we address the indirect method, which can provide a powerful\ntechnique to obtain information about radiative capture reactions at\nastrophysically relevant energies. The idea of the indirect method is to use\nthe indirect reaction $A(a, s\\,\\gamma)F$ to obtain information about the\nradiative capture reaction $A(x,\\,\\gamma)F$, where $a=(s\\,x)$ and $F=(x\\,A)$.\nThe main advantage of using the indirect reactions is the absence of the\npenetrability factor in the channel $x+A$, which suppresses the low-energy\ncross sections of the $A(x,\\,\\gamma)F$ reactions and does not allow to measure\nthese reactions at astrophysical energies. A general formalism to treat\nindirect resonant radiative capture reactions is developed when only a few\nintermediate states do contribute and statistical approach cannot be applied.\nAngular dependence of the triple differential cross section at fixed scattering\nangle of the spectator $s$ is the angular $\\gamma-s$ correlation function.\nUsing indirect resonant radiative capture reactions one can obtain the\ninformation about important astrophysical resonant radiative capture reactions,\nlike $(p,\\,\\gamma), \\,\\,(\\alpha,\\,\\gamma)$ and $(n,\\,\\gamma)$ on stable and\nunstable isotopes. The indirect technique makes accessible low-lying\nresonances, which are close to the threshold, and even subthreshold bound\nstates located at negative energies. In this paper, after developing the\ngeneral formalism, we demonstrated the application of the indirect reaction\n${}^{12}{\\rm C}({}^{6}{\\rm Li},d\\,\\gamma){}^{16}{\\rm O}$ proceeding through\n$1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ subthreshold bound states and resonances to obtain the\ninformation about the ${}^{12}{\\rm C}(\\alpha,\\,\\gamma){}^{16}{\\rm O}$ radiative\ncapture at astrophysically most effective energy $0.3$ MeV what is impossible\nusing standard direct measurements.\n", "  The super 0-brane action on the coset space of $D(2,1;\\alpha)$ supergroup is\nconstructed which involves a set of parameters related by $\\kappa$-symmetry. It\ndescribes a massive superparticle propagating near the horizon of the extreme\nReissner-Nordstr$\\\"o$m-AdS-dS black hole which is linked to the recently\nconstructed $D(2,1;\\alpha)$-superparticle [JHEP 1703 (2017) 054] by a canonical\ntransformation.\n", "  It is well known that Brunel's vacuum heating mechanism is operative for\nlaser energy absorption when the target plasma density rises sharply. For\nnon-relativistic laser intensities and planar targets it is also necessary that\nthe laser should strike the target at oblique incidence. The laser electric\nfield at oblique incidence has a component normal to the surface to extract\nelectrons from the target in the vacuum region for Brunel's mechanism to be\noperative. At relativistic laser intensities, oblique incidence is not\nnecessarily required as the J x B force is significant and can extract\nelectrons from the target even when the laser is at normal incidence. In this\nmanuscript, the interaction of short and intense laser pulse with structured\noverdense plasma targets have been studied using 2D particle-in-cell\nsimulations. It is shown that for structured targets the absorption increases\nmany fold. A detailed study and understanding of the absorption process for the\nstructured targets in terms of structure scale length and amplitude have been\nprovided.\n", "  The efficiency of nanopore-based polymer sensing devices depends on the fast\ncapture of anionic polyelectrolytes by negatively charged pores. This requires\nthe cancellation of the electrostatic barrier associated with repulsive\npolymer-pore interactions. We develop a correlation-corrected theory to show\nthat the barrier experienced by the polymer can be efficiently overcome by the\naddition of multivalent cations into the electrolyte solution. Cation\nadsorption into the pore enhances the screening ability of the pore medium with\nrespect to the bulk reservoir which translates into an attractive force on the\npolymer. Beyond a critical multivalent cation concentration, this\ncorrelation-induced attraction overcomes the electrostatic barrier and triggers\nthe adsorption of the polymer by the like-charged pore. It is shown that\nlike-charge polymer-pore attraction is suppressed by monovalent salt but\nenhanced by the membrane charge strength and the pore confinement. Our\npredictions may provide enhanced control over polymer motion in translocation\nexperiments.\n", "  We utilize machine learning to study the string landscape. Deep data dives\nand conjecture generation are proposed as useful frameworks for utilizing\nmachine learning in the landscape, and examples of each are presented. A\ndecision tree accurately predicts the number of weak Fano toric threefolds\narising from reflexive polytopes, each of which determines a smooth F-theory\ncompactification, and linear regression generates a previously proven\nconjecture for the gauge group rank in an ensemble of $\\frac43 \\times 2.96\n\\times 10^{755}$ F-theory compactifications. Logistic regression generates a\nnew conjecture for when $E_6$ arises in the large ensemble of F-theory\ncompactifications, which is then rigorously proven. This result may be relevant\nfor the appearance of visible sectors in the ensemble. Through conjecture\ngeneration, machine learning is useful not only for numerics, but also for\nrigorous results.\n", "  We present a complete (non-redundant) basis of CP- and flavour-conserving\nsix-dimensional operators in a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM). We include\nZ_2-violating operators as well. In such a 2HDM effective field theory\n(2HDMEFT), we estimate how constraining the 2HDM parameter space from\nexperiments can get disturbed due to these operators. Our basis is motivated by\nthe strongly interacting light Higgs (SILH) basis used in the standard model\neffective field theory (SMEFT). We find out bounds on combinations of Wilson\ncoefficients of such operators from precision observables, signal strengths of\nHiggs decaying into vector bosons etc. In 2HDMEFT, the 2HDM parameter space can\nplay a significant role while deriving such constraints, by leading to reduced\nor even enhanced effects compared to SMEFT in certain processes. We also\ncomment on the implications of the SILH suppressions in such considerations.\n", "  We use the framework of dark matter effective field theories to study the\ncomplementarity of bounds for a dark matter particle with mass in the MeV\nrange. Taking properly into account the mixing between operators induced by the\nrenormalization group running, we impose experimental constraints coming from\nthe CMB, BBN, LHC, LEP, direct detection experiments and meson decays. In\nparticular, we focus on the case of a vector coupling between the dark matter\nand the standard model fermions, and study to which extent future experiments\ncan hope to probe regions of parameters space which are not already ruled out\nby current data.\n", "  Parton distribution functions (PDFs) with QED corrections extracted from the\nQED$\\otimes$QCD DGLAP evolution equations in the framework of \"valon\" model.\nOur results for the PDFs with QED corrections in this phenomenological model\nare in good agreement with the newly related CT14QED global fit code [Phys.\nRev. D93, 114015 (2016)] and APFEL (NNPDF2.3QED) [Computer Physics\nCommunications 185, 1647 (2014)] program in a wide range of $x=[10^{-5}, 1]$\nand $Q^2=[0.283, 10^8] \\, {\\rm GeV}^2$. The model calculations agree rather\nwell with those codes. We also proposed the new method for studying the\nsymmetry breaking of the sea quarks distribution functions inside proton. Then\nthese PDFs set can be used to explore the proton-proton scattering at the LHC\nera.\n", "  We use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly determine the lines of\nrenormalization group fixed points invariant under the permutational symmetry\n$S_q$ in two dimensions, and show how one of these scattering solutions\ndescribes the ferromagnetic and square lattice antiferromagnetic critical lines\nof the $q$-state Potts model. Other solutions we determine should correspond to\nnew critical lines. In particular, we obtain that a $S_q$-invariant fixed point\ncan be found up to the maximal value $q=(7+\\sqrt{17})/2$. This is larger than\nthe usually assumed maximal value 4 and leaves room for a second order\nantiferromagnetic transition at $q=5$.\n", "  We extend the recent bounds of Sason and Verd\\'u relating R\\'enyi entropy and\nBayesian hypothesis testing [arXiv:1701.01974] to the quantum domain and show\nthat they have a number of different applications. First, we obtain a sharper\nbound relating the optimal probability of correctly distinguishing elements of\nan ensemble of states to that of the pretty good measurement, and an analogous\nbound for optimal and pretty good entanglement recovery. Second, we obtain\nbounds relating optimal guessing and entanglement recovery to the fidelity of\nthe state with a product state, which then leads to tight tripartite\nuncertainty and monogamy relations.\n", "  Photometric observations of planetary transits may show localized bumps,\ncalled transit anomalies, due to the possible crossing of photospheric\nstarspots. The aim of this work is to analyze the transit anomalies and derive\nthe temperature profile inside the transit belt along the transit direction. We\ndevelop the algorithm TOSC, a tomographic inverse-approach tool which, by means\nof simple algebra, reconstructs the flux distribution along the transit belt.\nWe test TOSC against some simulated scenarios. We find that TOSC provides\nrobust results for light curves with photometric accuracies better than 1~mmag,\nreturning the spot-photosphere temperature contrast with an accuracy better\nthan 100~K. TOSC is also robust against the presence of unocculted spots,\nprovided that the apparent planetary radius given by the fit of the transit\nlight curve is used in place of the true radius. The analysis of real data with\nTOSC returns results consistent with previous studies.\n", "  Early-type dwarf galaxies are not simply featureless, old objects, but were\nfound to be much more diverse, hosting substructures and a variety of stellar\npopulation properties. To explore the stellar content of faint early-type\ngalaxies, and to investigate in particular those with recent central star\nformation, we study colours and colour gradients within one effective radius in\noptical (g-r) and near-infrared (i-H) bands for 120 Virgo cluster early types\nwith -19 mag < $M_{r}$ < -16 mag. Twelve galaxies turn out to have blue cores,\nwhen defined as g-r colour gradients larger than 0.10 mag/$R_{\\rm eff}$, which\nrepresents the positive tail of the gradient distribution. For these galaxies,\nwe find that they have the strongest age gradients, and that even outside the\nblue core, their mean stellar population is younger than the mean of ordinary\nfaint early types. The metallicity gradients of these blue-cored early-type\ndwarf galaxies are, however, in the range of most normal faint early types,\nwhich we find to have non-zero gradients with higher central metallicity. The\nblue central regions are consistent with star formation activity within the\nlast few 100 Myr. We discuss that these galaxies could be explained by\nenvironmental quenching of star formation in the outer galaxy regions, while\nthe inner star formation activity has continued.\n", "  We show that there exist infinite number of recurrence relations valid for\nall energies among the open bosonic string scattering amplitudes (SSA) of three\ntachyons and one arbitrary string state, or the Lauricella SSA. Moreover, these\ninfinite number of recurrence relations can be used to solve all the Lauricella\nSSA and express them in terms of one single four tachyon amplitude. These\nresults extend the solvability of SSA at the high energy, fixed angle\nscattering limit and those at the Regge scattering limit discovered previously.\n", "  It is widely accepted that nuclear Gamow-Teller transitions are quenched;\nshell-model calculations also showed a clear anticorrelation between the\nGamow-Teller strength and the transition rate of the collective quadrupole\nexcitation from the ground state. We discuss the physics beyond this\nobservation. It is based on the existence of spin-orbit coupling that is\nresponsible for the non-zero probabilities of Gamow-Teller transitions in\nself-conjugate nuclei (N = Z). The shell-model calculations in the f p-space\ndemonstrate the effects of the gradual artificial removal of the spin-orbit\ncoupling that influences Gamow-Teller and quadrupole modes in opposite way. The\nrealistic spin-orbit splitting moves the cumulative Gamow-Teller strength up\nand leads to stronger fragmentation; both trends are discussed in terms of\nsimple symmetry arguments. Along with this process, the Gamow-Teller operator\nexcites, in addition to the main line of L = 0 states, states with L = 2 which\nshould be added, with the interference terms, to account for the total\nstrength.\n", "  Multiphoton pair production is investigated by focusing on the momentum\nstructures of produced pairs in the polarization plane for the two circularly\npolarized fields. Upon the momentum spectra, different from the concentric\nrings with the familiar Ramsey interference fringes for the same handedness,\nhowever, the obvious vortex structures are found constituted by the Archimedean\nspirals for two opposite handedness fields. The underlying physical reasons are\nanalyzed and discussed. It is also found that the vortex patterns are sensitive\nto the relative carrier envelope phase, the time delay, and the handedness of\ntwo fields, which can be used to detect the applied laser field characteristics\nas a probe way.\n", "  In this paper, we study the deflection of light by a class of charged\nwormholes within the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. The\nprimordial wormholes are predicted to exist in the early universe, where\ninflation driven by the dilaton field. We perform our analysis through optical\ngeometry using the Gibbons-Werner method (GW), by adopting the Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem and the standard geodesics approach. We report an interesting result\nfor the deflection angle in leading-order terms--namely, the deflection angle\nincreases due to the electric charge $Q$ and the magnetic charge $P$, whereas\nit decreases due to the dilaton charge $\\Sigma$. Finally, we confirm our\nfindings by means of geodesics equations. Our computations show that the GW\nmethod gives an exact result in leading order terms.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT-20b, a hot Jupiter transiting a V~7.6 early A\nstar with an orbital period of P~3.47 days. We identified the initial transit\nsignal in KELT-North survey data. Archival and follow-up photometry, the Gaia\nparallax, radial velocities, Doppler tomography, and adaptive optics imaging\nwere used to confirm the planetary nature of the companion and characterize the\nsystem. From global modeling we infer that the host star HD 185603 is a\nrapidly-rotating (VsinI~120 km/s) A2V star with an effective temperature of\n$T_{eff}$=8730K, mass of $M_{star}=1.76M_{sun}$, radius of\n$R_{star}=1.561R_{sun}$, surface gravity of logg=4.292, and age of <600 Myr.\nThe planetary companion has a radius of $1.735^{+0.070}_{-0.075}~R_{J}$, a\nsemimajor axis of $a=0.0542^{+0.0014}_{-0.0021}$AU, and a linear ephemeris of\n$BJD_{TDB}=2457503.120049 \\pm 0.000190 + E(3.4741070\\pm0.0000019)$. We place a\n$3\\sigma$ upper limit of ~3.5 $M_{J}$ on the mass of the planet. The Doppler\ntomographic measurement indicates that the planetary orbit is well aligned with\nthe projected spin-axis of the star ($\\lambda= 3.4\\pm {2.1}$ degrees). The\ninclination of the star is constrained to be $24.4<I_*<155.6$ degrees, implying\na true (three-dimensional) spin-orbit alignment of $1.3<\\psi<69.8$ degrees. The\nplanet receives an insolation flux of $\\sim 8\\times 10^9~{\\rm\nerg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, implying an equilibrium temperature of of ~ 2250 K,\nassuming zero albedo and complete heat redistribution. Due to the high stellar\n$T_{eff}$, the planet also receives an ultraviolet (wavelengths $d\\le 91.2$~nm)\ninsolation flux of $\\sim 9.1\\times 10^4~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$, which may\nlead to significant ablation of the planetary atmosphere. Together with\nWASP-33, Kepler-13 A, HAT-P-57, KELT-17, and KELT-9, KELT-20 is the sixth A\nstar host of a transiting giant planet, and the third-brightest host (in V) of\na transiting planet.\n", "  We report on the observation of cold collisions between $^6$Li atoms and\nYb$^+$ ions. This combination of species has recently been proposed as the most\nsuitable for reaching the quantum limit in hybrid atom-ion systems, due to its\nlarge mass ratio. For atoms and ions prepared in the $^2S_{1/2}$ ground state,\nthe charge transfer and association rate is found to be at least~10$^{3}$ times\nsmaller than the Langevin collision rate. These results confirm the excellent\nprospects of $^6$Li--Yb$^+$ for sympathetic cooling and quantum information\napplications. For ions prepared in the excited electronic states $^2P_{1/2}$,\n$^2D_{3/2}$ and $^2F_{7/2}$, we find that the reaction rate is dominated by\ncharge transfer and does not depend on the ionic isotope nor the collision\nenergy in the range $\\sim$~1--120~mK. The low charge transfer rate for ground\nstate collisions is corroborated by theory, but the $4f$ shell in the Yb$^+$\nion prevents an accurate prediction for the charge transfer rate of the\n$^2P_{1/2}$, $^2D_{3/2}$ and $^2F_{7/2}$ states. Using \\textit{ab initio}\nmethods of quantum chemistry we calculate the atom-ion interaction potentials\nup to energies of 30$\\times 10^3$~cm$^{-1}$, and use these to give qualitative\nexplanations of the observed rates.\n", "  We study the production of a Higgs boson in association to a top-antitop pair\nat the Large Hadron Collider. We show how precise predictions for the\ndifferential distributions with respect to the transverse momentum of the Higgs\nboson, to the invariant mass of the top-antitop-Higgs system and to the\ninvariant mass of the top-antitop pair can provide useful information on the\npossible presence of a pseudoscalar component in the coupling of the top quark\nwith the Higgs boson. We evaluate the production of a top-antitop pair and a\nHiggs boson to next-to-leading order in fixed order perturbation theory and we\ncarry out the resummation of soft emission corrections to\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy for the LHC operating at a center of mass\nenergy of $13$ TeV. We discuss how the shape of these distributions can be\nemployed experimentally, making a physics case for the kinematic reconstruction\nof dilepton channels.\n", "  One of the best ways to improve our understanding of the stellar\nactivity-induced signal in radial velocity (RV) measurements is through\nsimultaneous high-precision photometric and RV observations. This is of prime\nimportance to mitigate the RV signal induced by stellar activity and therefore\nunveil the presence of low-mass exoplanets. The K2 Campaign 7 and 8\nfield-of-views were located in the southern hemisphere, and provided a unique\nopportunity to gather unprecedented simultaneous high precision photometric\nobservation with K2 and high-precision RV measurements with the HARPS\nspectrograph to study the relationship between photometric variability and RV\njitter. We observed nine stars with different levels of activity; from quiet to\nvery active. We probe the presence of any meaningful relation between measured\nRV jitter and the simultaneous photometric variation, and also other activity\nindicators (e.g. BIS, FWHM, $logR'_{HK}$, and F8), by evaluating the strength\nand significance of the correlation between RVs and each indicator. We found\nthat for the case of very active stars, strong and significant correlations\nexist between almost all the observables and measured RVs; however, for lower\nactivity levels the correlations become random. Except for the F8 which its\nstrong correlation with RV jitter persists over a wide range of stellar\nactivity level, and thus our result suggests that F8 might be a powerful proxy\nfor activity induced RV jitter. Moreover, we examine the capability of two\nstate-of-the-art modeling techniques, namely the FF' method and SOAP2.0, in\naccurately predicting the RV jitter amplitude using the simultaneous\nphotometric observation. We found that for the very active stars both\ntechniques can reasonably well predict the amplitude of the RV jitter, however,\nat lower activity levels the FF' method underpredicts the RV jitter amplitude.\n", "  We present a new approach to study the mass-metallicity relation and its\ndependency on time. We used the star formation history (SFH) derived from\ncolor-magnitude diagram fitting techniques of a sample of Local Group (LG)\ndwarfs to obtain stellar masses, metallicities, and star-formation rates (SFR)\nto analyze the mass-metallicity relation as a function of the ages of their\nstellar populations. The accurate SFHs allow a time resolution of about 2 Gyr\nat the oldest ages for a total redshift range of 0<~z<~3. The mass-metallicity\nrelation retrieved for the sample of LG dwarfs was compared with a large\ndataset of literature data obtained in a wide redshift range. Neither of the\ntwo independent datasets shows a clear evolution of the mass-metallicity\nrelation slope with redshift. However, when the star-formation rate is added as\nan additional parameter in the relation, it shows a dependence on the redshift\nin the sense that the coefficient of the mass decreases with increasing\nredshift, while the coefficient for the SFR is almost constant with time. This\nresult suggests an increasing contribution with time of the galaxy stellar mass\nto the metalliticy of the stars that formed most recently, but it also shows\nthat the SFR can play a fundamental role in shaping the mass-metallicity\nrelation.\n", "  The time delays of gravitationally lensed quasars are generally believed to\nbe unique numbers whose measurement is limited only by the quality of the light\ncurves and the models for the contaminating contribution of gravitational\nmicrolensing to the light curves. This belief is incorrect -- gravitational\nmicrolensing also produces changes in the actual time delays on the ~day(s)\nlight-crossing time scale of the emission region. This is due to a combination\nof the inclination of the disk relative to the line of sight and the\ndifferential magnification of the temperature fluctuations producing the\nvariability. We demonstrate this both mathematically and with direct\ncalculations using microlensing magnification patterns. Measuring these delay\nfluctuations can provide a physical scale for microlensing observations,\nremoving the need for priors on either the microlens masses or the component\nvelocities. That time delays in lensed quasars are themselves time variable\nlikely explains why repeated delay measurements of individual lensed quasars\nappear to vary by more than their estimated uncertainties. This effect is also\nan important new systematic problem for attempts to use time delays in lensed\nquasars for cosmology or to detect substructures (satellites) in lens galaxies.\n", "  In this work we conduct a close-up investigation into the nature of\nnear-field heat transfer (NFHT) of two graphene sheets in parallel-plate\ngeometry. We develop a fully microscopic and quantum approach using\nnonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. A Caroli formula for heat flux\nis proposed and numerically verified. We show our near-field-to-black-body heat\nflux ratios generally exhibit $1/d^{\\alpha}$ dependence, with an effective\nexponent $\\alpha \\approx 2.2$, at long distances exceeding 100 nm and up to one\nmicron; in the opposite $d\\rightarrow 0$ limit, the values converge to a range\nwithin an order of magnitude. Furthermore, from the numerical result, we find\nin addition to thermal wavelength, $\\lambda_{th}$, a shorter distance scale\n$\\sim$ 10 - 100 nm, comparable to the graphene thermal length ($\\hbar\nv_{F}/k_{B} T$) or Fermi wavelength ($k_{F}^{-1}$), marks the transition point\nbetween the short- and long-distance transfer behaviors, within that point,\nrelatively large variation of heat flux in response to doping level becomes a\ntypical character. The emergence of such large variation is tied to relative\nNFHT contributions from the intra- and inter-band transitions. Beyond that\npoint, scaling of thermal flux $\\propto 1/d^{\\alpha}$ can be generally\nobserved.\n", "  We study gapless quantum spin chains with spin 1/2 and 1: the Fredkin and\nMotzkin models. Their entangled groundstates are known exactly but not their\nexcitation spectra. We first express the groundstates in the continuum which\nallows for the calculation of spin and entanglement properties in a unified\nfashion. Doing so, we uncover an emergent conformal-type symmetry, thus\nconsolidating the connection to a widely studied family of Lifshitz quantum\ncritical points in 2d. We then obtain the low lying excited states via\nlarge-scale DMRG simulations and find that the dynamical exponent is z = 3.2 in\nboth cases. Other excited states show a different z, indicating that these\nmodels have multiple dynamics. Moreover, we modify the spin-1/2 model by adding\na ferromagnetic Heisenberg term, which changes the entire spectrum. We track\nthe resulting non-trivial evolution of the dynamical exponents using DMRG.\nFinally, we exploit an exact map from the quantum Hamiltonian to the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a classical spin chain to shed light on the quantum\ndynamics.\n", "  We consider the one-parameter generalization $S^4_q$ of 4-sphere with a\nconical singularity due to identification $\\tau=\\tau + 2 \\pi q$ in one\nisometric angle. We compute the value of the spectral zeta-function at zero\n$z(q) = \\zeta(0, q)$ that controls the coefficient of the logarithmic UV\ndivergence of the one-loop partition function on $S^4_q$. While the value of\nthe conformal anomaly a-coefficient is proportional to $z(1)$, we argue that in\ngeneral the second $c = C_T$ anomaly coefficient is related to a particular\ncombination of the second and first derivatives of $z(q) $ at $q=1$. The\nuniversality of this relation for $C_T$ is supported also by examples in 6 and\n2 dimensions. We use it to compute the c-coefficient for conformal higher spins\nfinding that it coincides with the \"$r=-1$\" value of the one-parameter Ansatz\nsuggested in arXiv:1309.0785. Like the sums of $a_s$ and $c_s$ coefficients,\nthe regularized sum of $z_s(q)$ over the whole tower of conformal higher spins\n$s=1,2, ...$ is found to vanish, implying UV finiteness on $S^4_q$ and thus\nalso the vanishing of the associated Re'nyi entropy. Similar conclusions are\nfound to apply to the standard 2-derivative massless higher spin tower. We also\npresent an independent computation of the full set of conformal anomaly\ncoefficients of the 6d Weyl graviton theory defined by a particular combination\nof the three 6d Weyl invariants that has a (2,0) supersymmetric extension.\n", "  The chiral corrections to the magnetic moments of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\ndoubly charmed baryons are systematically investigated up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order with heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory\n(HBChPT). The numerical results are calculated up to next-to-leading order:\n$\\mu_{\\Xi^{++}_{cc}}=-0.25\\mu_{N}$, $\\mu_{\\Xi^{+}_{cc}}=0.85\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Omega^{+}_{cc}}=0.78\\mu_{N}$. We also calculate the magnetic moments of\nthe other doubly heavy baryons, including the doubly bottomed baryons (bbq) and\nthe doubly heavy baryons containing a light quark, a charm quark and a bottom\nquark ($\\{bc\\}q$ and $[bc]q$): $\\mu_{\\Xi^{0}_{bb}}=-0.84\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Xi^{-}_{bb}}=0.26\\mu_{N}$, $\\mu_{\\Omega^{-}_{bb}}=0.19\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Xi^{+}_{\\{bc\\}q}}=-0.54\\mu_{N}$, $\\mu_{\\Xi^{0}_{\\{bc\\}q}}=0.56\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Omega^{0}_{\\{bc\\}q}}=0.49\\mu_{N}$, $\\mu_{\\Xi^{+}_{[bc]q}}=0.69\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Xi^{0}_{[bc]q}}=-0.59\\mu_{N}$, $\\mu_{\\Omega^{0}_{[bc]q}}=0.24\\mu_{N}$.\n", "  We use AdS/CFT holography to study how a strongly-coupled plasma polarizes\nwhen the geometry where it resides is not flat. We compute the linear-response\npolarization coefficients, which are directly related to the static two-point\ncorrelation function of the stress-energy tensor. In the gravitational dual\ndescription, these parameters correspond to the tidal deformation\ncoefficients---the Love numbers---of a black brane. We also compute the\ncoefficients of static electric polarization of the plasma.\n", "  Meson spectroscopy at finite gauge coupling - whereat any perturbative QCD\ncomputation would break down - and finite number of colors, from a top-down\nholographic string model, has thus far been entirely missing in the literature.\nThis paper fills in this gap. Using the delocalized type IIA SYZ mirror (with\n$SU(3)$ structure) of the holographic type IIB dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD of\narXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 as constructed in arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at finite\ncoupling and number of colors ($N_c$ = Number of $D5(\\overline{D5}$)-branes\nwrapping a vanishing two-cycle in the top-down holographic construct of\narXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 = ${\\cal O}(1)$ in the IR in the MQGP limit of\narXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at the end of a Seiberg duality cascade), we obtain\nanalytical (not just numerical) expressions for the vector and scalar meson\nspectra and compare our results with previous calculations of hep-th/0412141,\narXiv:1409.0559 [hep-th], and obtain a closer match with the Particle Data\nGroup (PDG) results (Chin. Phys. C, 38, 090001 (2014) and 2015 update). Through\nexplicit computations, we verify that the vector and scalar meson spectra\nobtained by the gravity dual with a black hole for all temperatures (small and\nlarge) are nearly isospectral with the spectra obtained by a thermal gravity\ndual valid for only low temperatures; the isospectrality is much closer for\nvector mesons than scalar mesons. The black hole gravity dual (with a horizon\nradius smaller than the deconfinement scale) also provides the expected\nlarge-$N$ suppressed decrease in vector meson mass with an increase of\ntemperature.\n", "  Plaquette models are short range ferromagnetic spin models that play a key\nrole in the dynamic facilitation approach to the liquid glass transition. In\nthis paper we perform a rigorous study of the thermodynamic properties of two\ndimensional plaquette models, the square and triangular plaquette models. We\nprove that for any positive temperature both models have a unique infinite\nvolume Gibbs measure with exponentially decaying correlations. We analyse the\nscaling of three a priori different static correlation lengths in the small\ntemperature regime, the mixing, cavity and multispin correlation lengths.\nFinally, using the symmetries of the model we determine an exact self\nsimilarity property for the infinite volume Gibbs measure.\n", "  Cryogenic buffer-gas beam sources are capable of producing intense beams of a\nwide variety of molecules, and have a number of advantages over traditional\nsupersonic expansion sources. In this work, we report on a neon matrix\nisolation study of carbon clusters produced with a cryogenic buffer-gas beam\nsource. Carbon clusters created by laser ablation of graphite are trapped in a\nneon matrix and detected with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the\nspectral range $4000-1000~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. Through a study of carbon cluster\nproduction as a function of various system parameters, we characterize the\nbehavior of the buffer-gas beam source and find that approximately\n$10^{11}-10^{12}$ of each cluster is produced with each pulse of the ablation\nlaser. These measurements demonstrate the usefulness of cryogenic buffer-gas\nbeam sources for producing molecular beams of clusters.\n", "  The presence of weak-scale colored top partners is among the simplest\nsolutions to the Higgs hierarchy problem and allows for a natural electroweak\nscale. We examine the constraints on generic colored top partners coming solely\nfrom their effect on the production and decay rates of the observed Higgs with\na mass of 125 GeV. We use the latest Higgs precision data from the Tevatron and\nthe LHC as of EPS 2017 to derive the current limits on spin-0, spin-1/2, and\nspin-1 colored top partners. We also investigate the expected sensitivity from\nthe Run 3 and Run 4 of the LHC, as well from possible future electron-positron\nand proton-proton colliders, including the ILC, CEPC, FCC-ee, and FCC-hh. We\ndiscuss constraints on top partners in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel and Little Higgs theories. We also consider various model-building\naspects--multiple top partners, modified couplings between the Higgs and\nStandard-Model particles, and non-Standard-Model Higgs sectors--and evaluate\nhow these weaken the current limits and expected sensitivities. By modifying\nother Standard-Model Higgs couplings, we find that the best way to hide\nlow-mass top partners from current data is through modifications of the\ntop-Yukawa coupling, although future measurements of top-quark-pair production\nin association with a Higgs will extensively probe this possibility. We also\ndemonstrate that models with multiple top partners can generically avoid\ncurrent and future Higgs precision measurements. Nevertheless, some of the\nmodel parameter space can be probed with precision measurements at future\nelectron-positron colliders of, for example, the e+ e- -> Zh cross section.\n", "  We show that a subdominant component of dissipative dark matter resembling\nthe Standard Model can form many intermediate-mass black hole seeds during the\nfirst structure formation epoch. We also observe that, in the presence of this\nmatter sector, the black holes will grow at a much faster rate with respect to\nthe ordinary case. These facts can explain the observed abundance of\nsupermassive black holes feeding high-redshift quasars. The scenario will have\ninteresting observational consequences for dark substructures and gravitational\nwave production.\n", "  Self-interacting dark matter has been proposed as a solution to small scale\nproblems in cosmological structure formation, and hints of dark matter self\nscattering have been observed in mergers of galaxy clusters. One of the\nsimplest models for self-interacting dark matter is a particle that is charged\nunder dark electromagnetism, a new gauge interaction analogous to the usual\nelectromagnetic force, but operating on the dark matter particle instead of the\nvisible particles. In this case, the collisional behaviour of dark matter is\nprimarily due to the formation of collisionless shocks, that should affect the\ndistribution of DM in merging galaxy clusters. We evaluate the time and length\nscales of shock formation in cluster mergers, and discuss the implications for\nmodelling charged dark matter in cosmological simulations.\n", "  Developing avoidance or mitigation strategies of runaway electrons (RE) in\nmagnetic confinement fusion (MCF) plasmas is of crucial importance for the safe\noperation of ITER. In order to develop these strategies, an accurate diagnostic\ncapability that allows good estimates of the RE distribution function in these\nplasmas is needed. Synchrotron radiation (SR) of RE in MCF, besides of being\none of the main damping mechanisms for RE in the high energy relativistic\nregime, is routinely used in current MCF experiments to infer the parameters of\nRE energy and pitch angle distribution functions. In the present paper we\naddress the long standing question about what are the relationships between\ndifferent RE distribution functions and their corresponding synchrotron\nemission simultaneously including: full-orbit effects, information of the\nspectral and angular distribution of SR of each electron, and basic geometric\noptics of a camera. We study the spatial distribution of the SR on the poloidal\nplane, and the statistical properties of the expected value of the synchrotron\nspectra of runaway electrons. We observe a strong dependence of the synchrotron\nemission measured by the camera on the pitch angle distribution of RE, namely\nwe find that crescent shapes of the spatial distribution of the SR as measured\nby the camera relate to RE distributions with small pitch angles, while ellipse\nshapes relate to distributions of runaways with larger the pitch angles. A weak\ndependence of the synchrotron emission measured by the camera with the RE\nenergy, value of the q-profile at the edge, and the chosen range of wavelengths\nis observed. Furthermore, we find that oversimplifying the angular dependence\nof the SR changes the shape of the synchrotron spectra, and overestimates its\namplitude by approximately 20 times for avalanching RE and by approximately 60\ntimes for mono-energetic distributions of runaways.\n", "  It was recently shown that an interacting Kitaev topological superconductor\nmodel is exactly solvable based on two-step Jordan-Wigner transformations\ntogether with one spin rotation. We generalize this model by including the\ndimerization, which is shown also to be exactly solvable. We analytically\ndetermine the topological phase diagram containing seven distinct phases. It is\nargued that the system is topological when a fermionic many-body Majorana\nzero-energy edge state emerges. It is intriguing that there are two\ntetra-critical points, at each of which four distinct phases touch.\n", "  We study (non-)integrability and the presence of chaos in gravity dual\nbackgrounds of strongly coupled gauge theories with unquenched flavor,\nspecifically of the four-dimensional N=2 super Yang-Mills theory and the\nthree-dimensional ABJM theory. By examining string motion on the geometries\ncorresponding to backreacted D3/D7 and D2/D6 systems, we show that integrable\ntheories with quenched flavor become non-integrable when the virtual quark\nloops are taken into account. For the string solutions in the backreacted D3/D7\nsystem, we compute the leading Lyapunov exponent which turns out to saturate to\na positive value as the number of flavors increases. The exponent depends very\nweakly on the number of flavors when they approach the number of colors. This\nsuggests that once a particular flavor number in the theory is reached, a\nfurther increase does not lead to more severe chaotic phenomena, implying\ncertain saturation effects on chaos.\n", "  We demonstrate that the planar real-$\\beta$-deformed Super-Yang--Mills theory\npossesses an infinitely-dimensional Yangian symmetry algebra and thus is\nclassically integrable. This is achieved by the introduction of the twisted\ncoproduct which allows us to lift the apparent $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry\nfirst to the full $\\mathcal{N}=4$ symmetry of the parent $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM\ntheory, and subsequently to its Yangian.\n", "  We consider a few number of identical bosons trapped in a 2D isotropic\nharmonic potential and also the $N$-boson system when it is feasible. The\natom-atom interaction is modelled by means of a finite-range Gaussian\ninteraction. The spectral properties of the system are scrutinized, in\nparticular, we derive analytic expressions for the degeneracies and their\nbreaking for the lower-energy states at small but finite interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the degeneracy of the low-energy states is independent of the\nnumber of particles in the noninteracting limit and also for sufficiently weak\ninteractions. In the strongly interacting regime, we show how the many-body\nwave function develops holes whenever two particles are at the same position in\nspace to avoid the interaction, a mechanism reminiscent of the Tonks-Girardeau\ngas in 1D. The evolution of the system as the interaction is increased is\nstudied by means of the density profiles, pair correlations and fragmentation\nof the ground state for $N=2$, $3$, and $4$ bosons.\n", "  We calculate 1-loop radiative corrections to the $hZZ$ and $hWW$ couplings in\nmodels with next--to--simplest Higgs sectors satisfying the electroweak $\\rho$\nparameter equal to 1 at tree level: the Higgs singlet model, the two-Higgs\ndoublet models, and the Georgi-Machacek model. Under theoretical and current\nexperimental constraints, the three models have different correlations between\nthe deviations in the $hZZ$ and $hWW$ couplings from the standard model\npredictions. In particular, we find for each model predictions with no overlap\nwith the other two models.\n", "  Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) is a mesoscopic particle method\nwhich allows to select the level of resolution at which a fluid is simulated.\nThe numerical integration of its equations of motion still suffers from the\nlack of numerical schemes satisfying all the desired properties: energy\nconservation, parallelizability and stability. The similarities between SDPD\nand Dissipative Particle Dynamics with Energy conservation (DPDE), which is\nanother coarse-grained model, enable the adaptation of recent numerical schemes\ndeveloped for DPDE to the SDPD setting. In this article, we introduce a\nMetropolis step in the integration of the fluctuation/dissipation part of SDPD\nto improve its stability.\n", "  The phenomenon of avalanche-gain variations over time, particularly in Micro\nPattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGD) incorporating insulator materials, have been\ngenerally attributed to electric-field modifications resulting from\n\"charging-up\" effects of the insulator. A robust methodology for\ncharacterization of gain-transients in such detectors is presented. It\ncomprises three guidelines: detector initialization, long-gain stabilization\nmonitoring and imposing transients by applying abrupt changes in operation\nconditions. Using THWELL and RPWELL detectors, we validated the proposed\nmethodology by assessing a charging-up/charging-down model describing the\ngoverning processes of gain stabilization. The results provide a deeper insight\ninto these processes, reflected by different transients upon abrupt variations\nof detector gain or the irradiation rate. This methodology provides a handle\nfor future investigations of the involved physics phenomena in MPGD detectors\ncomprising insulating components.\n", "  We consider the 6d superconformal field theory realized on M5-branes probing\nthe $E_8$ end-of-the-world brane on the deformed and resolved\n$\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_k$ singularity. We give an explicit algorithm which\ndetermines, for arbitrary holonomy at infinity, the 6d quiver gauge theory on\nthe tensor branch, the type-A class S description of the $T^2$\ncompactification, and the star-shaped quiver obtained as the mirror of the\n$T^3$ compactification.\n", "  Approximate full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations have recently\nbecome tractable for systems of unforeseen size thanks to stochastic and\nadaptive approximations to the exponentially scaling FCI problem. The result of\nan FCI calculation is a weighted set of electronic configurations, which can\nalso be expressed in terms of excitations from a reference configuration. The\nexcitation amplitudes contain information on the complexity of the electronic\nwave function, but this information is contaminated by contributions from\ndisconnected excitations, i.e. those excitations that are just products of\nindependent lower-level excitations. The unwanted contributions can be removed\nvia a cluster decomposition procedure, making it possible to examine the\nimportance of connected excitations in complicated multireference molecules\nwhich are outside the reach of conventional algorithms. We present an\nimplementation of the cluster decomposition analysis and apply it to both true\nFCI wave functions, as well as wave functions generated from the adaptive\nsampling CI (ASCI) algorithm. The cluster decomposition is useful for\ninterpreting calculations in chemical studies, as a diagnostic for the\nconvergence of various excitation manifolds, as well as as a guidepost for\npolynomially scaling electronic structure models. Applications are presented\nfor (i) the double dissociation of water, (ii) the carbon dimer, (iii) the\n{\\pi} space of polyacenes, as well as (iv) the chromium dimer. While the\ncluster amplitudes exhibit rapid decay with increasing rank for the first three\nsystems, even connected octuple excitations still appear important in Cr$_2$,\nsuggesting that spin-restricted single-reference coupled-cluster approaches may\nnot be tractable for some problems in transition metal chemistry.\n", "  We study the impact of finite-size effects on the key rate of\ncontinuous-variable (CV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key\ndistribution (QKD). Inspired by the parameter estimation technique developed in\n[Rupert \\textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{90}, 062310 (2014)]~we adapt it to\nstudy CV-MDI-QKD and, assuming realistic experimental conditions, we analyze\nthe impact of finite-size effects on the key rate. We find that, increasing the\nblock-size, the performance of the protocol converges towards the ideal one,\nand that block-sizes between $10^{6}$ and $10^{9}$ data points can already\nprovide a key rate $\\sim10^{-2}$ bit/use over metropolitan distances.\n", "  We construct globally-defined $SU(3)$ structures on smooth compact toric\nvarieties (SCTV) in the class of $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ bundles over $M$, where $M$ is\nan arbitrary SCTV of complex dimension two. The construction can be extended to\nthe case where the base is K\\\"ahler-Einstein of positive curvature, but not\nnecessarily toric, and admits a parameter space which includes $SU(3)$\nstructures of LT type.\n", "  We propose and analyse a nonlinear optical apparatus in which the direction\nof asymmetric steering is controllable within the apparatus, rather than by\nadding noise to measurements. Using a nondegenerate parametric oscillator with\nan injected signal field, we show how the directionality and extent of the\nsteering can be readily controlled for output modes which can be up to one\noctave apart. The two downconverted modes, which exhibit the greater violations\nof the steering inequalities, can also be controlled to exhibit asymmetric\nsteering in some regimes.\n", "  We discuss the susceptibility of the Cooper condensate in the s-wave $2+1$\nsuperconductor in the external magnetic field and in the rotating frame. The\nextended holographic model involving the charged rank-two field is considered\nand it is argued that the susceptibility does not vanish. We interpret\nnon-vanishing susceptibilities as the admixture of the p-wave triplet component\nin the Cooper condensate in the external field.\n", "  We develop a unified description, via the Boltzmann equation, of damping of\ngravitational waves by matter, incorporating collisions. We identify two\nphysically distinct damping mechanisms -- collisional and Landau damping. We\nfirst consider damping in flat spacetime, and then generalize the results to\nallow for cosmological expansion. In the first regime, maximal collisional\ndamping of a gravitational wave, independent of the details of the collisions\nin the matter is, as we show, significant only when its wavelength is\ncomparable to the size of the horizon. Thus damping by intergalactic or\ninterstellar matter for all but primordial gravitational radiation can be\nneglected. Although collisions in matter lead to a shear viscosity, they also\nact to erase anisotropic stresses, thus suppressing the damping of\ngravitational waves. Damping of primordial gravitational waves remains\npossible. We generalize Weinberg's calculation of gravitational wave damping,\nnow including collisions and particles of finite mass, and interpret the\ncollisionless limit in terms of Landau damping. While Landau damping of\ngravitational waves cannot occur in flat spacetime, the expansion of the\nuniverse allows such damping by spreading the frequency of a gravitational wave\nof given wavevector.\n", "  We investigate the correlation between a possible deviation in the discovered\nHiggs boson $h(125)$ couplings from the Standard Model prediction and the mass\nscale ($M_{\\text{2nd}}$) of the next-to-lightest Higgs boson in models with\nnon-minimal Higgs sectors. In particular, we comprehensively study a class of\nnext-to-minimal Higgs sectors which satisfy the electroweak $\\rho$ parameter to\nbe one at tree level. We derive an upper limit on $M_{\\text{2nd}}$ by imposing\nbounds from perturbative unitarity, vacuum stability, triviality and\nelectroweak precision data as functions of the deviation in the $hVV$ ($V=W,Z$)\ncouplings. Furthermore, we discuss the complementarity between these bounds and\nthe current LHC data, e.g., by considering direct searches for additional Higgs\nbosons and indirect constraints arising from the measured $h(125)$ signal\nstrengths.\n", "  We present a formula for the information metric on $\\mathbb{R} \\times\n{S}^{d-1}$ for a scalar primary operator of integral dimension $\\Delta \\, (\\,\\,\n> \\frac{d+1}{2})$. This formula is checked for various space-time dimensions\n$d$ and $\\Delta$ in the field theory side. We check the formula in the gravity\nside using the holographic setup. We clarify the regularization and\nrenormalization involved in these computations. We also show that the quantum\ninformation metric of an exactly marginal operator agrees with the leading\norder of the interface free energy of the conformal Janus on Euclidean ${S}^d$,\nwhich is checked for $d=2, 3$.\n", "  We study Gutzwiller-correlated wave functions as variational ground states\nfor the two-impurity Anderson model (TIAM) at particle-hole symmetry as a\nfunction of the impurity separation ${\\bf R}$. Our variational state is\nobtained by applying the Gutzwiller many-particle correlator to a\nsingle-particle product state. We determine the optimal single-particle product\nstate fully variationally from an effective non-interacting TIAM that contains\na direct electron transfer between the impurities as variational degree of\nfreedom. For a large Hubbard interaction $U$ between the electrons on the\nimpurities, the impurity spins experience a Heisenberg coupling proportional to\n$V^2/U$ where $V$ parameterizes the strength of the on-site hybridization. For\nsmall Hubbard interactions we observe weakly coupled impurities. In general,\nfor a three-dimensional simple cubic lattice we find discontinuous quantum\nphase transitions that separate weakly interacting impurities for small\ninteractions from singlet pairs for large interactions.\n", "  We describe the design, fabrication, and validation of a\ncryogenically-compatible quasioptical thermal source designed to be used for\ncharacterization of detector arrays. The source is constructed using a\ngraphite-loaded epoxy mixture that is molded into a tiled pyramidal structure.\nThe mold is fabricated using a hardened steel template produced via a wire EDM\nprocess. The absorptive mixture is bonded to a copper backplate enabling\nthermalization of the entire structure. The source reflectance is measured from\n30-300 GHz and compared to models.\n", "  The main goal of this work is to compare the results of three dynamical mass\nestimators to the X-ray hydrostatic values, focussing on massive galaxy\nclusters at intermediate redshifts $z\\sim0.3$. We estimated dynamical masses\nwith the virial theorem, the Jeans equation, and the caustic method using\nwide-field VIMOS spectroscopy. We investigated the role of colour selection and\nthe impact of substructures on the dynamical estimators. The Jeans and caustic\nmethods give consistent results, whereas the virial theorem leads to masses\n$\\sim15\\%$ larger. The Jeans, caustic, and virial masses are respectively\n$\\sim20\\%$, $\\sim30\\%$, and $\\sim50\\%$ larger than the hydrostatic values.\nLarge scatters of $\\gtrsim50\\%$ are mainly due to the two outliers RXCJ0014 and\nRXCJ1347; excluding the latter increases the mass ratios by $\\sim10\\%$, giving\na fractional mass bias significant at $\\gtrsim2\\sigma$. We found a correlation\nbetween the dynamical-to-hydrostatic mass ratio and two substructure\nindicators, suggesting a bias in the dynamical measurements. The velocity\ndispersions of blue galaxies are $\\sim15\\%$ ($\\sim25\\%$ after removing the\nsubstructures) larger than that of the red-sequence galaxies; using the latter\nleads to dynamical masses $\\sim10\\%-15\\%$ smaller. Discarding the galaxies part\nof substructures reduces the masses by $\\sim15\\%$; the effect is larger for the\nmore massive clusters, owing to a higher level of substructures. After the\nsubstructure analysis, the dynamical masses are in perfect agreement with the\nhydrostatic values and the scatters around the mean ratios are divided by\n$\\sim2$.\n", "  Through a survey of (sub-)millimetre emission lines of various\nsulphur-bearing molecules, we aim to determine which molecules are the primary\ncarriers of sulphur in different types of AGB stars. In this paper, the first\nin a series, we investigate the occurrence of H$_2$S in AGB circumstellar\nenvelopes and determine its abundance, where possible. We have surveyed 20 AGB\nstars with a range of mass-loss rates and of different chemical types using the\nAPEX telescope to search for rotational transition lines of five key\nsulphur-bearing molecules: CS, SiS, SO, SO$_2$ and H$_2$S. Here we present our\nresults for H$_2$S, including detections, non-detections and detailed radiative\ntransfer modelling of the detected lines. We compare results based on different\ndescriptions of the molecular excitation of H$_2$S and different abundance\ndistributions, including those derived from chemical modelling results. We\ndetected H$_2$S towards five AGB stars, all of which have high mass-loss rates\nof $\\dot{M}\\geq 5\\times 10^{-6}M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and are oxygen-rich. H$_2$S\nwas not detected towards the carbon or S-type stars that fall in a similar\nmass-loss range. For the stars in our sample with detections, we find peak\no-H$_2$S abundances relative to H$_2$ between $4\\times 10^{-7}$ and $2.5\\times\n10^{-5}$. Overall, we conclude that H$_2$S can play a significant role in\noxygen-rich AGB stars with higher mass-loss rates, but is unlikely to play a\nkey role in stars of other chemical types or the lower mass-loss rate\noxygen-rich stars. For two sources, V1300 Aql and GX Mon, H$_2$S is most likely\nthe dominant sulphur-bearing molecule in the circumstellar envelope.\n", "  We study the cosmological particle creation in the tachyon inflation based on\nthe D-brane dynamics in the RSII model extended to include matter in the bulk.\nThe presence of matter modifies the warp factor which results in two effects: a\nmodification of the RSII cosmology and a modification of the tachyon potential.\nBesides, a string theory D-brane supports among other fields a U(1) gauge field\nreflecting open strings attached to the brane. We demonstrate how the\ninteraction of the tachyon with the U(1) gauge field drives cosmological\ncreation of massless particles and estimate the resulting reheating at the end\nof inflation.\n", "  The time delay between gravitational wave signals arriving at widely\nseparated detectors can be used to place upper and lower bounds on the speed of\ngravitational wave propagation. Using a Bayesian approach that combines the\nfirst three gravitational wave detections reported by the LIGO collaboration we\nconstrain the gravitational waves propagation speed c_gw to the 90% credible\ninterval 0.55 c < c_gw < 1.42 c, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. These\nbounds will improve as more detections are made and as more detectors join the\nworldwide network. Of order twenty detections by the two LIGO detectors will\nconstrain the speed of gravity to within 20% of the speed of light, while just\nfive detections by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra network will constrain the speed of\ngravity to within 1% of the speed of light.\n", "  Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) by relativistic shocks is thought to\ngenerate the $dN/dE\\propto E^{-p}$ spectra of charged particles in various\nastronomical relativistic flows. We show that for test particles in one\ndimension (1D),\n$p^{-1}=1-\\ln\\left[\\gamma_d(1+\\beta_d)\\right]/\\ln\\left[\\gamma_u(1+\\beta_u)\\right]$,\nwhere $\\beta_u$ ($\\beta_d)$ is the upstream (downstream) normalized velocity,\nand $\\gamma$ is the respective Lorentz factor. This analytically captures the\nmain properties of relativistic DSA in higher dimensions, with no assumptions\non the diffusion mechanism. Unlike 2D and 3D, here the spectrum is sensitive to\nthe equation of state even in the ultra-relativistic limit, and (for a\nJ{\\\"u}ttner-Synge equation of state) noticeably hardens with increasing\n$1<\\gamma_u<57$, before logarithmically converging back to\n$p(\\gamma_u\\to\\infty)=2$. The 1D spectrum is sensitive to drifts, but only in\nthe downstream, and not in the ultra-relativistic limit.\n", "  Mixed action lattice QCD with Borici-Creutz valence quarks on staggered sea\nis investigated. The counter terms in Borici-Creutz action are fixed\nnonperturbatively to restore the broken parity and time symmetries. On symmetry\nrestoration, the usual signatures of partial quenching / unitarity violation\nlike negative scalar correlator are observed. The size of unitarity violation\ndue to different discretization of valence and sea quark is determined by\nmeasuring $\\Delta_{\\rm mix}$ and is found to be comparable with other mixed\naction studies.\n", "  The formation pathways of deuterated species trace different regions of\nprotoplanetary disks and may shed light into their physical structure. We aim\nto constrain the radial extent of main deuterated species; we are particularly\ninterested in spatially characterizing the high and low temperature pathways\nfor enhancing deuteration of these species. We observed the disk surrounding\nthe Herbig Ae star HD 163296 using ALMA in Band 6 and obtained resolved\nspectral imaging data of DCO$^+$ ($J$=3-2), DCN ($J$=3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$\n($J$=3-2). We model the radial emission profiles of DCO$^+$, DCN and\nN$_2$D$^+$, assuming their emission is optically thin, using a parametric model\nof their abundances and radial excitation temperature estimates. DCO$^+$ can be\ndescribed by a three-region model, with constant-abundance rings centered at 70\nAU, 150 AU and 260 AU. The DCN radial profile peaks at about ~60 AU and\nN$_2$D$^+$ is seen in a ring at ~160 AU. Simple models of both molecules using\nconstant abundances reproduce the data. Assuming reasonable average excitation\ntemperatures for the whole disk, their disk-averaged column densities (and\ndeuterium fractionation ratios) are 1.6-2.6$\\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$\n(0.04-0.07), 2.9-5.2$\\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($\\sim$0.02) and 1.6-2.5 $\\times\n10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ (0.34-0.45) for DCO$^+$, DCN and N$_2$D$^+$, respectively.\nOur simple best-fit models show a correlation between the radial location of\nthe first two rings in DCO$^+$ and the DCN and N$_2$D$^+$ abundance\ndistributions that can be interpreted as the high and low temperature\ndeuteration pathways regimes. The origin of the third DCO$^+$ ring at 260 AU is\nunknown but may be due to a local decrease of ultraviolet opacity allowing the\nphotodesorption of CO or due to thermal desorption of CO as a consequence of\nradial drift and settlement of dust grains.\n", "  The Be X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 was in an extended low luminosity state\nduring most of 2016. We observed this state with NuSTAR and Swift, supported by\nINTEGRAL observations as well as optical spectroscopy with the NOT. We present\na comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of these data here to study the\naccretion geometry and investigate a possible onset of the propeller effect.\nThe H-alpha data show that the circumstellar disk of the Be-star is still\npresent. We measure equivalent widths similar to values found during more\nactive phases in the past, indicating that the low-luminosity state is not\nsimply triggered by a smaller Be disk. The NuSTAR data, taken at a 3-78 keV\nluminosity of ~6.8e35 erg/s (for a distance of 7.1 kpc), are well described by\nstandard accreting pulsar models, such as an absorbed power-law with a\nhigh-energy cutoff. We find that pulsations are still clearly visible at these\nluminosities, indicating that accretion is continuing despite the very low mass\ntransfer rate. In phase-resolved spectroscopy we find a peculiar variation of\nthe photon index from ~1.5 to ~2.5 over only about 3% of the rotational period.\nThis variation is similar to that observed with XMM-Newton at much higher\nluminosities. It may be connected to the accretion column passing through our\nline of sight. With Swift/XRT we observe luminosities as low as 1e34 erg/s\nduring which the data quality did not allow us to search for pulsations, but\nthe spectrum is much softer and well described by either a blackbody or soft\npower-law continuum. This softer spectrum might be due to the fact that\naccretion has been stopped by the propeller effect and we only observe the\nneutron star surface cooling.\n", "  We prove that both the liquid drop model in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with an attractive\nbackground nucleus and the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von Weizs\\\"{a}cker (TFDW) model\nattain their ground-states \\emph{for all} masses as long as the external\npotential $V(x)$ in these models is of long range, that is, it decays slower\nthan Newtonian (e.g., $V(x)\\gg |x|^{-1}$ for large $|x|$.) For the TFDW model\nwe adapt classical concentration-compactness arguments by Lions, whereas for\nthe liquid drop model with background attraction we utilize a recent\ncompactness result for sets of finite perimeter by Frank and Lieb.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may disturb the solar wind either by overtaking\nit, or by expanding into it, or both. CMEs whose front moves faster in the\nsolar wind frame than the fast magnetosonic speed, drive shocks. Such shocks\nare important contributors to space weather, by triggering substorms,\ncompressing the magnetosphere and accelerating particles. In general, near 1\nAU, CMEs with speed greater than about 500 km s$^{-1}$ drive shocks, whereas\nslower CMEs do not. However, CMEs as slow as 350 km s$^{-1}$ may sometimes,\nalthough rarely, drive shocks. Here, we study these slow CMEs with shocks and\ninvestigate the importance of CME expansion in contributing to their ability to\ndrive shocks and in enhancing shock strength. Our focus is on CMEs with average\nspeeds under 375 km s$^{-1}$. From Wind measurements from 1996 to 2016, we find\n22 cases of such shock-driving slow CMEs, and, for about half of them (11 out\nof the 22), the existence of the shock appears to be strongly related to CME\nexpansion. We also investigate the proportion of all CMEs with speeds under 500\nkm s$^{-1}$ with and without shocks in solar cycles 23 and 24, depending on\ntheir speed. We find no systematic difference, as might have been expected on\nthe basis of the lower solar wind and Alfv\\'en speeds reported for solar cycle\n24 vs. 23. The slower expansion speed of CMEs in solar cycle 24 might be an\nexplanation for this lack of increased frequency of shocks, but further studies\nare required.\n", "  Models for light dark matter particles with masses below 1 GeV/c$^2$ are a\nnatural and well-motivated alternative to so-far unobserved weakly interacting\nmassive particles. Gram-scale cryogenic calorimeters provide the required\ndetector performance to detect these particles and extend the direct dark\nmatter search program of CRESST. A prototype 0.5 g sapphire detector developed\nfor the $\\nu$-cleus experiment has achieved an energy threshold of\n$E_{th}=(19.7\\pm 0.9)$ eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than previous\nresults and independent of the type of particle interaction. The result\npresented here is obtained in a setup above ground without significant\nshielding against ambient and cosmogenic radiation. Although operated in a\nhigh-background environment, the detector probes a new range of light-mass dark\nmatter particles previously not accessible by direct searches. We report the\nfirst limit on the spin-independent dark matter particle-nucleon cross section\nfor masses between 140 MeV/c$^2$ and 500 MeV/c$^2$.\n", "  We explore broadband and omnidirectional low frequency sound screening based\non locally resonant acoustic metamaterials. We show that the coupling of\ndifferent resonant modes supported by Fabry-Perot cavities can efficiently\ngenerate asymmetric lineshapes in the transmission spectrum, leading to a\nbroadband sound opacity. The Fabry-Perot cavities are space-coiled in order to\nshift the resonant modes under the diffraction edge, which guaranty the opacity\nband for all incident angles. Indeed, the deep subwavelength feature of the\ncavities leads to avoid diffraction that have been proved to be the main\nlimitation of omnidirectional capabilities of locally resonant perforated\nplates. We experimentally reach an attenuation of few tens of dB at low\nfrequency, with a metamaterial thickness fifteen times smaller than the\nwavelength (lambda / 15). The proposed design can be considered as a new\nbuilding block for acoustic metasurfaces having a high level of manipulation of\nacoustic waves.\n", "  We study Pfaffians that appear in non-perturbative superpotential terms\narising from worldsheet instantons in heterotic theories. A result by Beasley\nand Witten shows that these instanton contributions cancel among curves within\na given homology class for Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be described as\nhypersurfaces or complete intersections in projective or toric ambient spaces.\nWe provide a prescription that identifies all $\\mathbb{P}^1$ curves in certain\nhomology classes of complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds in products of\nprojective spaces (CICYs) and cross-check our results by a comparison with the\ngenus zero Gromov-Witten invariants. We then use this construction to study\ninstanton superpotentials on those manifolds and their quotients. We identify a\nnon-toric quotient of a non-favorable CICY with a single genus zero curve in a\ncertain homology class, so that a cancellation \\`a la Beasley-Witten is not\npossible. In another example, we study a non-toric quotient of a favorable CICY\nand check that the superpotential still vanishes. From this and related\nexamples, we conjecture that the Beasley-Witten cancellation result can be\nextended to toric and non-toric quotients of CICYs, but can be avoided if the\nCICY is non-favorable.\n", "  Context: Although type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a key role in\nastrophysics, the companions of the exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO\nWDs) are still not completely identified. It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities.\n", "  The z=0.89 molecular absorber toward PKS1830-211 provides us with the\nopportunity to probe the chemical and physical properties of the interstellar\nmedium in the disk of a galaxy at a look-back time of half the present age of\nthe Universe. Recent ALMA observations of hydrides have unveiled the\nmulti-phase composition of this source's interstellar medium along two\nabsorbing sightlines. Here, we report ALMA observations of CH+ and SH+, and of\ntheir 13C- and 34S- isotopologues, as potential tracers of energetic processes\nin the interstellar medium. CH+ and 13CH+ are detected toward both images of\nPKS1830-211, CH+ showing the deepest and broadest absorption among all species\nobserved so far. The [CH+]/[13CH+] abundance ratio is ~100 in the south-west\nline of sight. [...] Toward the north-east image, we find an even larger value\nof [CH+]/[13CH+], 146 +/- 43, although with a large uncertainty. This sightline\nintercepts the absorber at a larger galactocentric radius than the southwestern\none, where material might be less processed in stellar nucleosynthesis. In\ncontrast to CH+ and its 13C isotopologue, SH+ and 34SH+ are only detected on\nthe south-west sightline. These are the first detections of extragalactic SH+\nand interstellar 34SH+. The spectroscopic parameters of SH+ are reevaluated and\nimproved rest frequencies of 34SH+ are obtained. The [CH+]/[SH+] column density\nratios show a large difference between the two lines of sight: ~25 and >600\ntoward the SW and NE image, respectively. We are not able to shed light on the\nformation process of CH+ and SH+ with these data, but the differences in the\ntwo sightlines toward PKS1830-211 suggest that their absorptions arise from gas\nwith molecular fraction gtrsim 10%, with SH+ tracing significantly higher\nmolecular fractions than CH+.\n", "  We present the first images of the 28SiO v=1, J=2-1 maser emission around the\nclosest known massive young stellar object Orion Source I observed at 86 GHz\n(3mm) with the VLBA. These images have high spatial (~0.3 mas) and spectral\n(~0.054 km/s) resolutions. We find that the 3mm masers lie in an X-shaped locus\nconsisting of four arms, with blue-shifted emission in the south and east arms\nand red-shifted emission in the north and west arms. Comparisons with previous\nimages of the 28SiO v=1,2, J=1-0 transitions at 7mm (observed in 2001-2002)\nshow that the bulk of the J=2-1 transition emission follows the streamlines of\nthe J=1-0 emission and exhibits an overall velocity gradient consistent with\nthe gradient at 7mm. While there is spatial overlap between the 3mm and 7mm\ntransitions, the 3mm emission, on average, lies at larger projected distances\nfrom Source I (~44 AU compared with ~35 AU for 7mm). The spatial overlap\nbetween the v=1, J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions is suggestive of a range of\ntemperatures and densities where physical conditions are favorable for both\ntransitions of a same vibrational state. However, the observed spatial offset\nbetween the bulk of emission at 3mm and 7mm possibly indicates different ranges\nof temperatures and densities for optimal excitation of the masers. We discuss\ndifferent maser pumping models that may explain the observed offset. We\ninterpret the 3mm and 7mm masers as being part of a single wide-angle outflow\narising from the surface of an edge-on disk rotating about a\nnortheast-southwest axis, with a continuous velocity gradient indicative of\ndifferential rotation consistent with a Keplerian profile in a high-mass\nproto-binary.\n", "  We propose a new type of a Heisenberg-limited quantum interferometer, whose\ninput is indistinguishably photon-subtracted twin beams. Such an interferometer\ncan yield Heisenberg-limited performance while at the same time giving a direct\nfringe reading, unlike for the twin-beam input of the Holland-Burnett\ninterferometer. We propose a feasible experimental realization, using a\nnondegenerate optical parametric oscillator above threshold.\n", "  A crucial process in Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) transport is the spatial\ndiffusion due to the interaction with the interstellar turbulent magnetic\nfield. Usually, CR diffusion is assumed to be uniform and isotropic all across\nthe Galaxy. However, this picture is clearly inaccurate: Several data-driven\nand theoretical arguments, as well as dedicated numerical simulations, show\nthat diffusion exhibits highly anisotropic properties with respect to the\ndirection of a background (ordered) magnetic field (i.e., parallel or\nperpendicular to it). In this paper we focus on a recently discovered anomaly\nin the hadronic CR spectrum inferred by the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data at\ndifferent positions in the Galaxy, i.e. the progressive hardening of the proton\nslope at low Galactocentric radii. We propose the idea that this feature can be\ninterpreted as a signature of anisotropic diffusion in the complex Galactic\nmagnetic field: In particular, the harder slope in the inner Galaxy is due, in\nour scenario, to the parallel diffusive escape along the poloidal component of\nthe large-scale, regular, magnetic field. We implement this idea in a numerical\nframework, based on the DRAGON code, and perform detailed numerical tests on\nthe accuracy of our setup. We discuss how the effect proposed depends on the\nrelevant free parameters involved. Based on low-energy extrapolation of the few\nfocused numerical simulations aimed at determining the scalings of the\nanisotropic diffusion coefficients, we finally present a set of plausible\nmodels that reproduce the behavior of the CR proton slopes inferred by\ngamma-ray data.\n", "  A new QCD sum rule determination of the leading order hadronic vacuum\npolarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\n$a_{\\mu}^{\\rm hvp}$, is proposed. This approach combines data on $e^{+}e^{-}$\nannihilation into hadrons, perturbative QCD and lattice QCD results for the\nfirst derivative of the electromagnetic current correlator at zero momentum\ntransfer, $\\Pi_{\\rm EM}^\\prime(0)$. The idea is based on the observation that,\nin the relevant kinematic domain, the integration kernel $K(s)$, entering the\nformula relating $a_{\\mu}^{\\rm hvp}$ to $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation data, behaves\nlike $1/s$ times a very smooth function of $s$, the squared energy. We find an\nexpression for $a_{\\mu}$ in terms of $\\Pi_{\\rm EM}^\\prime(0)$, which can be\ncalculated in lattice QCD. Using recent lattice results we find a good\napproximation for $a_{\\mu}^{\\rm hvp}$, but the precision is not yet sufficient\nto resolve the discrepancy between the $R(s)$ data-based results and the\nexperimentally measured value.\n", "  In spite of the absence of viscous drag, the neutron superfluid permeating\nthe inner crust of a neutron star cannot flow freely, and is entrained by the\nnuclear lattice similarly to laboratory superfluid atomic gases in optical\nlattices. The role of entrainment on the neutron superfluid dynamics is\nreviewed. For this purpose, a minimal hydrodynamical model of superfluidity in\nneutron-star crusts is presented. This model relies on a fully\nfour-dimensionally covariant action principle. The equivalence of this\nformulation with the more traditional approach is demonstrated. In addition,\nthe different treatments of entrainment in terms of dynamical effective masses\nor superfluid density are clarified. The nuclear energy density functional\ntheory employed for the calculations of all the necessary microscopic inputs is\nalso reviewed, focusing on superfluid properties. In particular, the\nmicroscopic origin of entrainment and the different methods to estimate its\nimportance are discussed.\n", "  The sigma-model of closed strings spinning in the $\\eta$-deformation of\n$AdS_{5} \\times S^{5}$ leads to an integrable deformation of the\none-dimensional Neumann-Rosochatius mechanical system. In this article we\nconstruct general solutions to this system that can be written in terms of\nelliptic functions. The solutions correspond to closed strings with\nnon-constant radii rotating with two different angular momenta in an\n$\\eta$-deformed three-sphere. We analyse the reduction of the elliptic\nsolutions for some limiting values of the deformation parameter. For the case\nof solutions with constant radii we find the dependence of the classical energy\nof the string on the angular momenta as an expansion in the 't Hooft coupling.\n", "  Finding better ways to prove the Standard Model Effective Field Theory is a\nvery important direction of research. This paper focuses on measurements of\nElectroweak triple gauge couplings, paying special attention on the regime of\nvalidity of the Effective Field Theory (EFT). In this regard, one of our goals\nis to find measurements leading to a large increase of the interference between\nthe SM amplitude and the contribution of irrelevant operators in the EFT. We\npropose two such distributions that will lead to a better accuracy.\nImprovements compared to the traditional methods as well as LHC high luminosity\nprospects are discussed.\n", "  The chemically peculiar barium stars, CH stars, and most CEMP stars are all\nbelieved to be the products of mass transfer in binary systems from a now\nextinct AGB primary star. The mass of the AGB star and the orbital parameters\nof the system are the key factors usually considered when determining how much\nmass is transferred onto the lower-mass main-sequence companion. What is\nusually neglected, however, is the angular momentum of the accreted material,\nwhich should spin up the accreting star. If the star reaches critical rotation,\nfurther accretion should cease until the excess angular momentum is somehow\ndealt with. If the star cannot redistribute or lose the angular momentum while\nthe primary is on the AGB, the amount of mass accreted could be much lower than\notherwise expected. Here we present calculations, based on detailed stellar\nevolution models, of the mass that can be accreted by putative progenitors of\nBa and CEMP stars before they reach critical rotation under the assumption that\nno angular momentum loss occurs during the mass transfer. We consider different\naccretion rates and values of specific angular momentum. The most stringent\nlimits on the accreted masses result from considering accretion from a\nKeplerian accretion disk, which is likely present during the formation of most\nextrinsically-polluted carbon-enriched stars. Our calculations indicate that in\nthis scenario only about 0.05 solar masses of material can be added to the\naccreting star before it reaches critical rotation, which is much too low to\nexplain the chemical enrichment of many Ba and CEMP stars. Either the specific\nangular momentum of the accreted material has to effectively be lower by about\na factor of ten than the Keplerian value, or significant angular momentum\nlosses must occur for substantial accretion to take place.\n", "  We present the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N^3LO) contributions to\nthe non-singlet splitting functions for both parton distribution and\nfragmentation functions in perturbative QCD. The exact expressions are derived\nfor the terms contributing in the limit of a large number of colours. For the\nremaining contributions, approximations are provided that are sufficient for\nall collider-physics applications. From their threshold limits we derive\nanalytical and high-accuracy numerical results, respectively, for all\ncontributions to the four-loop cusp anomalous dimension for quarks, including\nthe terms proportional to quartic Casimir operators. We briefly illustrate the\nnumerical size of the four-loop corrections, and the remarkable\nrenormalization-scale stability of the N^3LO results, for the evolution of the\nnon-singlet parton distribution and the fragmentation functions. Our results\nappear to provide a first point of contact of four-loop QCD calculations and\nthe so-called wrapping corrections to anomalous dimensions in N=4 super\nYang-Mills theory.\n", "  We calculate several differential distributions for the production of charm\nand dijets. Both single-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton scattering\n(DPS) contributions are calculated in the $k_T$-factorization approach. The\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated parton distributions are used in our\ncalculations. Relatively low cuts on jet transverse momenta are imposed to\nenhance the double-parton scattering mechanism contribution. We find dominance\nof the DPS contribution over the SPS one. We have found regions of the phase\nspace where the SPS contribution is negligible compared to the DPS\ncontribution. The distribution in transverse momentum of charm quark/antiquark\nor charmed mesons can be used to observe transition from the dominance of DPS\nat low transvsverse momenta to the dominance of SPS at large transverse\nmomenta. Very distinct azimuthal correlation patterns (for $c \\bar{c}$,\n$c\\mathrm{\\textit{-jet}}$, $\\mathrm{\\textit{jet-jet}}$,\n$D^0\\mathrm{\\textit{-jet}}$, $D^0 D^0$) are predicted as a result of the\ncompetition of the SPS and DPS mechanisms.\n", "  As the foundation for a new computational implementation, we survey the\ncalculation of the complex electrical conductivity tensor based on the\nKubo-Greenwood (KG) formalism (J.\\ Phys.\\ Soc.\\ Jpn. \\textbf{12}, 570 (1957);\nProc.\\ Phys.\\ Soc.\\ \\textbf{71}, 585 (1958)), with emphasis on derivations and\ntechnical aspects pertinent to use of projector augmented wave datasets with\nplane wave basis sets (Phys.\\ Rev.\\ B \\textbf{50}, 17953 (1994)). New\nanalytical results and a full implementation of the KG approach in an\nopen-source Fortran 90 post-processing code for use with Quantum Espresso (J.\\\nPhys.\\ Cond.\\ Matt.\\ \\textbf{21}, 395502 (2009)) are presented.Named KGEC\n([K]ubo [G]reenwood [E]lectronic [C]onductivity), the code calculates the full\ncomplex conductivity tensor (not just the average trace). It supports use of\neither the original KG formula or the popular one approximated in terms of a\nDirac delta function. It provides both Gaussian and Lorentzian representations\nof the Dirac delta function (thoughthe Lorentzian is preferable on basic\ngrounds). KGEC provides decomposition of the conductivity into intra- and\ninter-band contributions as well as degenerate state contributions. It\ncalculates the dc conductivity tensor directly. It is MPI parallelized over\nk-points, bands, and plane waves, with an option to recover the plane wave\nprocesses for their use in band parallelization as well. It is designed to\nprovide rapid convergence with respect to $\\mathbf k$-point density. Examples\nof its use are given.\n", "  In a recent article, Kleidis and Spyrou (2015) proposed that both dark matter\n(DM) and dark energy (DE) can be treated as a single component, if accommodated\nin the context of a polytropic DM fluid with thermodynamical content. Depending\nonly on the polytropic exponent, $-0.103 < \\Gamma \\leq 0$, this unified DM\nmodel reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements performed with the\naid of the supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) standard candles, without suffering\neither from the age or from the coincidence problem. To demonstrate also its\ncompatibility with current observational data concerning structure formation,\nin the present article we discuss the evolution of cosmological perturbations\nin the $\\Lambda$ CDM-like (i.e., $\\Gamma = 0$) limit of the polytropic DM\nmodel. The corresponding results are quite encouraging, since, such a model\nreproduces every major effect already known from conventional (i.e.,\npressureless cold dark matter - CDM) structure formation theory, such as the\nconstancy of metric perturbations in the vicinity of recombination and the\n(late-time) Meszaros effect on their rest-mass density counterparts (Meszaros\n1974). The non-zero (polytropic) pressure, on the other hand, drives the\nevolution of small-scale velocity perturbations along the lines of the\nroot-mean-square velocity law of conventional Statistical Physics. As a\nconsequence, in this model \"peculiar velocities\" slightly increase, instead of\nbeing redshifted away by cosmic expansion. What is more important is that, upon\nconsideration of scale-invariant metric perturbations, the spectrum of their\nrest-mass density counterparts exhibits an effective power-law dependence on\nthe (physical) wavenumber, with the associated scalar spectral index being\nequal to $n_s = 0.970$; a theoretical value that actually reproduces the\ncorresponding observational (Planck) result (Ade et al. 2016).\n", "  We prove that, for a given spherically symmetric fluid distribution with\ntangential pressure on an initial spacelike hypersurface with a timelike\nboundary, there exists a unique, local in time solution to the Einstein\nequations in a neighbourhood of the boundary. As an application, we consider a\nparticular elastic fluid interior matched to a vacuum exterior.\n", "  Elastic anomalies produced by the spin crossover in ferropericlase have been\ndocumented by both first principles calculations and high pressure-temperature\nexperiments. The predicted signature of this spin crossover in the lower mantle\nis, however, subtle and difficult to geophysically observe within the mantle.\nIndeed, global seismic anomalies associated with spin transitions have not yet\nbeen recognized in seismologic studies of the deep mantle. A sensitive seismic\nparameter is needed to determine the presence and amplitude of such a spin\ncrossover signature. The effects of spin crossovers on Bullen's parameter,\n$\\eta$, are assessed here for a range of compositions, thermal profiles, and\nlateral variations in temperature within the lower mantle. Velocity anomalies\nassociated with the spin crossover in ferropericlase span a depth range near\n1,000 km for typical mantle temperatures. Positive excursions of Bullen's\nparameter with a maximum amplitude of $\\sim$ 0.03 are calculated to be present\nover a broad depth range within the mid-to-deep lower mantle: these are largest\nfor peridotitic and harzburgitic compositions. These excursions are highest in\namplitude for model lower mantles with large lateral thermal variations, and\nwith cold downwellings having longer lateral length-scales relative to hot\nupwellings. We conclude that predicted deviations in Bullen's parameter due to\nthe spin crossover in ferropericlase for geophysically relevant compositions\nmay be sufficiently large to resolve in accurate seismic inversions of this\nparameter, and could shed light on both the lateral variations in temperature\nat depth within the lower mantle, and the amount of ferropericlase at depth.\n", "  The observation of PeV neutrinos is an open window to study New Physics\nprocesses. Among all possible neutrino observables, the neutrino flavor\ncomposition can reveal underlying interactions during the neutrino propagation.\nWe study the effects on neutrino oscillations of dark matter-neutrino\ninteractions. We estimate the size of the interaction strength to produce a\nsizable deviation with respect to the flavor composition from oscillations in\nvacuum. We found that the dark matter distribution produces flavor compositions\nnon reproducible by other New Physics phenomena. Besides, the dark matter\neffect predicts flavor compositions which depend on the neutrino's arrival\ndirection. This feature might be observed in neutrino telescopes like IceCube\nand KM3NET with access to different sky sections. This effect presents a novel\nway to test Dark Matter particle models.\n", "  We calculate the vacuum stability conditions and renormalisation group\nequations for the extensions of standard model with a higher colour multiplet\nscalar up to the representation $\\mathbf{15'}$ that leaves the strong\ninteraction asymptotically free. In order to find the vacuum stability\nconditions, we calculate the orbit spaces for the self-couplings of the higher\nmultiplets, which for the representations $\\mathbf{15}$ and $\\mathbf{15'}$ of\n$SU(3)_c$ are highly complicated. However, if the scalar potential is linear in\norbit space variables, it is sufficient to know the convex hull of the orbit\nspace. In contrast to the self-couplings of other multiplets, we find that the\nscalar quartic couplings of the representations $\\mathbf{3}$ and $\\mathbf{8}$\nwalk rather than run, remaining nearly constant and perturbative over a vast\nenergy range. We describe the conditions for walking couplings using a\nschematic model. With these technical results at hand we revise earlier results\nof generation of new scales with large $SU(3)_c$ scalar multiplets. Our results\nare easily extendable to models of new physics with additional $SU(3)$ or\nSU($N$) gauge symmetries.\n", "  We have designed and tested experimentally a morphing structure consisting of\na neutrally stable thin cylindrical shell driven by a multiparameter\npiezoelectric actuation. The shell is obtained by plastically deforming an\ninitially flat copper disk, so as to induce large isotropic and almost uniform\ninelastic curvatures. Following the plastic deformation, in a perfectly\nisotropic system, the shell is theoretically neutrally stable, owning a\ncontinuous manifold of stable cylindrical shapes corresponding to the rotation\nof the axis of maximal curvature. Small imperfections render the actual\nstructure bistable, giving preferred orientations. A three-parameter\npiezoelectric actuation, exerted through micro-fiber-composite actuators,\nallows us to add a small perturbation to the plastic inelastic curvature and to\ncontrol the direction of maximal curvature. This actuation law is designed\nthrough a geometrical analogy based on a fully non-linear inextensible\nuniform-curvature shell model. We report on the fabrication, identification,\nand experimental testing of a prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe piezoelectric actuators in controlling its shape. The resulting motion is\nan apparent rotation of the shell, controlled by the voltages as in a\n\"gear-less motor\", which is, in reality, a precession of the axis of principal\ncurvature.\n", "  We derive an expression for the chemical potential of an associating solute\nin a solvent relative to the value in a reference fluid using the quasichemical\norganization of the potential distribution theorem. The fraction of times the\nsolute is not associated with the solvent, the monomer fraction, is expressed\nin terms of (a) the statistics of occupancy of the solvent around the solute in\nthe reference fluid and (b) the Widom factors that arise because of turning on\nsolute-solvent association. Assuming pair-additivity, we expand the Widom\nfactor into a product of Mayer f-functions and the resulting expression is\nrearranged to reveal a form of the monomer fraction that is analogous to that\nused within the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT). The present\nformulation avoids all graph-theoretic arguments and provides a fresh, more\nintuitive, perspective on Wertheim's theory and SAFT. Importantly, multi-body\neffects are transparently incorporated into the very foundations of the theory.\nWe illustrate the generality of the present approach by considering examples of\nmultiple solvent association to a colloid solute with bonding domains that\nrange from a small patch on the sphere, a Janus particle, and a solute whose\nentire surface is available for association.\n", "  We present wide-field, spatially and highly resolved spectroscopic\nobservations of Balmer filaments in the northeastern rim of Tycho's supernova\nremnant in order to investigate the signal of cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration. The\nspectra of Balmer-dominated shocks (BDSs) have characteristic narrow (FWHM\n$\\sim$ 10 kms$^{-1}$) and broad (FWHM $\\sim$ 1000 kms$^{-1}$) H$\\alpha$\ncomponents. CRs affect the H$\\alpha$-line parameters: heating the cold neutrals\nin the interstellar medium results in broadening of the narrow H$\\alpha$-line\nwidth beyond 20 kms$^{-1}$, but also in reduction of the broad H$\\alpha$-line\nwidth due to energy being removed from the protons in the post-shock region.\nFor the first time we show that the width of the narrow H$\\alpha$ line, much\nlarger than 20 kms$^{-1}$, is not a resolution or geometric effect nor a\nspurious result of a neglected intermediate (FWHM $\\sim$ 100 kms$^{-1}$)\ncomponent resulting from hydrogen atoms undergoing charge exchange with warm\nprotons in the broad-neutral precursor. Moreover, we show that a narrow line\nwidth $\\gg$ 20 kms$^{-1}$ extends across the entire NE rim, implying CR\nacceleration is ubiquitous, and making it possible to relate its strength to\nlocally varying shock conditions. Finally, we find several locations along the\nrim, where spectra are significantly better explained (based on Bayesian\nevidence) by inclusion of the intermediate component, with a width of 180\nkms$^{-1}$ on average.\n", "  We consider three different continuum polymer models, that all depend on a\ntunable parameter r that determines the strength of the excluded-volume\ninteractions. In the first model chains are obtained by concatenating hard\nspherocylinders of height b and diameter rb (we call them thick self- avoiding\nchains). The other two models are generalizations of the tangent hard-sphere\nand of the Kremer-Grest models. We show that, for a specific value r*, all\nmodels show an optimal behavior: asymptotic long-chain behavior is observed for\nrelatively short chains. For r < r*, instead, the behavior can be parametrized\nby using the two-parameter model that also describes the thermal crossover\nclose to the {\\theta} point. The bonds of thick self-avoiding chains cannot\ncross each other and, therefore, the model is suited for the investigation of\ntopological properties and for dynamical studies. Such a model also provides a\ncoarse-grained description of double-stranded DNA, so that we can use our\nresults to discuss under which conditions DNA can be considered as a model\ngood-solvent polymer.\n", "  We use the covariant spectator theory with an effective quark-antiquark\ninteraction, containing Lorentz scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector contributions,\nto calculate the masses and vertex functions of, simultaneously, heavy and\nheavy-light mesons. We perform least-square fits of the model parameters,\nincluding the quark masses, to the meson spectrum and systematically study the\nsensitivity of the parameters with respect to different sets of fitted data. We\ninvestigate the influence of the vector confining interaction by using a\ncontinuous parameter controlling its weight. We find that vector contributions\nto the confining interaction between 0% and about 30% lead to essentially the\nsame agreement with the data. Similarly, the light quark masses are not very\ntightly constrained. In all cases, the meson mass spectra calculated with our\nfitted models agree very well with the experimental data. We also calculate the\nmesons wave functions in a partial wave representation and show how they are\nrelated to the meson vertex functions in covariant form.\n", "  We investigate the room temperature electronic properties of MnTiO3\nsynthesised by different preparation conditions. For this purpose, we prepared\nMnTiO3 under two different cooling rates, one is naturally cooled while the\nother is quenched in liq.nitrogen. The samples were studied using optical\nabsorbance, photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations.We\nobserve significant changes in the structural parameters as a result of\nquenching. Interestingly, in the parent compound, our combined core level,\nvalence band and optical absorbance studies show the evidence of Mn existing in\nboth 2+ and 3+ states. The fraction of Mn3+ ions has been found to increase on\nquenching. The increase in the fraction of the Mn3+ ions has been manifested\n(a) as slight enhancement in the intensity of the optical absorbance in the\nvisible region.There occurs persistent photo-resistance when the incident light\nis terminated after shining; (b) in the behaviour of the features (close to\nfermi level) in the valence band spectra. Hence, the combined analysis of the\ncore level, valence band and optical absorbance spectra suggest the charge\ncarriers are hole like which further leads to the increase in the electrical\nconductivity of the quenched sample. The present results provide recipe to tune\nthe optical absorption in the visible range for its applications in optical\nsensors, solar cell, etc.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are powerful particle accelerators. As a supernova\n(SN) blast wave propagates through the circumstellar medium (CSM), electrons\nand protons scatter across the shock and gain energy by entrapment in the\nmagnetic field. The accelerated particles generate further magnetic field\nfluctuations and local amplification, leading to cosmic ray production. The\nwealth of data from Supernova 1987A is providing a template of the SN-CSM\ninteraction, and an important guide to the radio detection and identification\nof core-collapse SNe based on their spectral properties. Thirty years after the\nexplosion, radio observations of SNR 1987A span from 70 MHz to 700 GHz. We\nreview extensive observing campaigns with the Australia Telescope Compact Array\n(ATCA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and\nfollow-ups with other radio telescopes. Observations across the radio spectrum\nindicate rapid changes in the remnant morphology, while current ATCA and ALMA\nobservations show that the SNR has entered a new evolutionary phase.\n", "  The electronic transport properties in magnetically doped ultra-thin films of\ntopological-insulators is investigated by using Landauer-buttiker formalism.\nThe chiral selective tunneling is addressed in such systems which leads to\ntransport gap and as a consequence current blocking. This quantum blocking of\ntransport occurs when the magnetic states with opposite chirality are aligned\nenergetically. This can be obsereved when an electron tunnels through a barrier\nor well of magnetic potential induced by the exchange field. It is proved and\ndemonstrated that this chiral transition rule fails when structural inversion\nasymmetric potential or an in-plane magnetization is turning on. This new\nfinding is useful to interpret quantum transport through topological-insulator\nthin films especially to shed light on longitudinal conductance behavior of\nquantum anomalous Hall effect. Besides, one can design electronic devices by\nmeans of magnetic topological-insulator thin films based on the chiral\nselective tunneling leading to negative differential resistance.\n", "  In supersymmetric theories like the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (NMSSM), the lightest neutralino with bino or singlino as its dominant\ncomponent is customarily taken as dark matter (DM) candidate. Since light\nHiggsinos favored by naturalness can strength the couplings of the DM and thus\nenhance the DM-nucleon scattering rate, the tension between naturalness and DM\ndirect detection results becomes more and more acute with the improved\nexperimental sensitivity. In this work, we extend the NMSSM by inverse seesaw\nmechanism to generate neutrino mass, and show that in certain parameter space\nthe lightest sneutrino may act as a viable DM candidate, i.e. it can annihilate\nby multi-channels to get correct relic density and meanwhile satisfy all\nexperimental constraints. The most striking feature of the extension is that\nthe DM-nucleon scattering rate can be naturally below its current experimental\nbounds regardless of the higgsino mass, and hence it alleviates the tension\nbetween naturalness and DM experiments. Other interesting features include that\nthe Higgs phenomenology becomes much richer than that of the original NMSSM due\nto the relaxed constraints from DM physics and also due to the presence of\nextra neutrinos, and that the signatures of sparticles at colliders are quite\ndifferent from those with neutralino as DM candidate.\n", "  We study the black string solutions in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) theory\nat large $D$. By using the $1/D$ expansion in the near horizon region we derive\nthe effective equations that describe the dynamics of the EGB black strings.\nThe uniform and non-uniform black strings are obtained as the static solutions\nof the effective equations. From the perturbation analysis of the effective\nequations, we find that thin EGB black strings suffer from the Gregory-Laflamme\ninstablity and the GB term weakens the instability when the GB coefficient is\nsmall, however, when the GB coefficient is large the GB term enhances the\ninstability. Furthermore, we numerically solve the effective equations to study\nthe non-linear instability. It turns out that the thin black strings are\nunstable to developing inhomogeneities along their length, and at late times\nthey asymptote to the stable non-uniform black strings. The behavior is\nqualitatively similar to the case in the Einstein gravity. Compared with the\nblack string instability in the Einstein gravity at large D, when the GB\ncoefficient is small the time needed to reach to final state increases, but\nwhen the GB coefficient is large the time to reach to final state decreases.\nStarting from the point of view in which the effective equations can be\ninterpreted as the equations for the dynamical fluid, we evaluate the transport\ncoefficients and find that the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy\ndensity agrees with that obtained previously in the membrane paradigm after\ntaking the large $D$ limit.\n", "  Higgs plus multi-gluon amplitudes in QCD can be computed in an effective\nLagrangian description. In the infinite top-mass limit, an amplitude with a\nHiggs and $n$ gluons is computed by the form factor of the operator ${\\rm Tr}\\,\nF^2$. Up to two loops and for three gluons, its maximally transcendental part\nis captured entirely by the form factor of the protected stress tensor\nmultiplet operator $\\mathcal{T}_2$ in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory. The next order correction involves the calculation of the form factor\nof the higher-dimensional, trilinear operator ${\\rm Tr}\\, F^3$. We present\nexplicit results at two loops for three gluons, including the subleading\ntranscendental terms derived from a particular descendant of the Konishi\noperator that contains ${\\rm Tr}\\, F^3$. These are expressed in terms of a few\nuniversal building blocks already identified in earlier calculations. We show\nthat the maximally transcendental part of this quantity, computed in\nnon-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, is identical to the form factor of\nanother protected operator, $\\mathcal{T}_3$, in the maximally supersymmetric\ntheory. Our results suggest that the maximally transcendental part of Higgs\namplitudes in QCD can be entirely computed through $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super\nYang-Mills.\n", "  We investigate here the effect of the selection function on the metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) and on the vertical metallicity gradient by\nstudying similar lines of sight using four different spectroscopic surveys\n(APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE, and Gaia-ESO), which have different targeting strategies\nand therefore different selection functions. We use common fields between the\nspectroscopic surveys of APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE (ALR) and APOGEE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO\n(AGR) and use two stellar population synthesis models, GALAXIA and TRILEGAL, to\ncreate mock fields for each survey. We apply the selection function in the form\nof colour and magnitude cuts of the respective survey to the mock fields to\nreplicate the observed source sample. We make a basic comparison between the\nmodels to check which best reproduces the observed sample distribution. We\ncarry out a quantitative comparison between the synthetic MDF from the mock\ncatalogues using both models to understand the effect of the selection function\non the MDF and on the vertical metallicity gradient. Using both models, we find\na negligible effect of the selection function on the MDF for APOGEE, LAMOST,\nand RAVE. We find a negligible selection function effect on the vertical\nmetallicity gradients as well, though GALAXIA and TRILEGAL have steeper and\nshallower slopes, respectively, than the observed gradient. After applying\ncorrection terms on the metallicities of RAVE and LAMOST with respect to our\nreference APOGEE sample, our observed vertical metallicity gradients between\nthe four surveys are consistent within 1-sigma. We also find consistent\ngradient for the combined sample of all surveys in ALR and AGR. We estimated a\nmean vertical metallicity gradient of -0.241+/-0.028 dex kpc-1. There is a\nsignificant scatter in the estimated gradients in the literature, but our\nestimates are within their ranges.\n", "  The physical state of cold cloud clumps has a great impact on the process and\nefficiency of star formation and the masses of the forming stars inside these\nobjects. The sub-millimetre survey of the Planck space observatory and the\nfar-infrared follow-up mapping of the Herschel space telescope provide an\nunbiased, large sample of these cold objects. We have observed $^{12}$CO(1$-$0)\nand $^{13}$CO(1$-$0) emission in 35 clumps in 26 Herschel fields sampling\ndifferent environments in the Galaxy. Densities and temperatures were\ncalculated from both the dust continuum and the molecular line data, kinematic\ndistances were derived using $^{13}$CO line velocities and clump sizes and\nmasses were calculated by fitting 2D Gaussian functions to the optical depth\ndistribution maps. Clump masses and virial masses were estimated assuming an\nupper and lower limit on the kinetic temperatures and considering uncertainties\ndue to distance limitations. The excitation temperatures are between 8.5$-$19.5\nK, while the Herschel-derived dust colour temperatures are 12$-$16 K. The sizes\n(0.1$-$3 pc), $^{13}$CO column densities (0.5$-$44$\\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$)\nand masses (from less than 0.1 $M_{\\odot}$ to more than 1500 $M_{\\odot}$) of\nthe objects span broad ranges. Eleven gravitationally unbound clumps were\nfound, many of them smaller than 0.3 pc, but large, parsec-scale clouds with a\nfew hundred solar masses appear as well. Colder clumps have generally high\ncolumn densities but warmer objects appear at both low and higher column\ndensities. The clump column densities derived from the line and dust\nobservations correlate well, but are heavily affected by uncertainties of the\ndust properties, varying molecular abundances and optical depth effects.\n", "  Breaking the symmetry in a coupled wave system can result in unusual\namplification behavior. In the case of difference parametric amplification the\nresonant pump frequency is equal to the difference, instead of the sum,\nfrequency of the normal modes. We show that sign reversal in the symmetry\nrelation of parametric coupling give rise to difference parametric\namplification as a dual of optical parametric amplification. For optical\nsystems, our result can potentially be used for efficient XUV amplification.\n", "  We theoretically predict a giant quantized Goos-H\\\"{a}nchen (GH) effect on\nthe surface of graphene in quantum Hall regime. The giant quantized GH effect\nmanifests itself as an angular shift whose quantized step reaches the order of\nmrad for light beams impinging on a graphene-on-substrate system. The quantized\nGH effect can be attributed to quantized Hall conductivity, which corresponds\nto the discrete Landau levels in quantum Hall regime. We find that the\nquantized step can be greatly enhanced for incident angles near the Brewster\nangle. Moreover, the Brewster angle is sensitive to the Hall conductivity, and\ntherefore the quantized GH effect can be modulated by the Fermi energy and the\nexternal magnetic field. The giant quantized GH effect offers a convenient way\nto determine the quantized Hall conductivity and the discrete Landau levels by\na direct optical measurement.\n", "  A truncation scheme of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy for\nreduced density matrices, where a three-body density matrix is approximated by\ntwo-body density matrices, is improved to take into account a normalization\neffect. The truncation scheme is tested for the Lipkin model. It is shown that\nthe obtained results are in good agreement with the exact solutions.\n", "  We compared positions of the Gaia first data release (DR1) secondary data set\nat its faint limit with CCD positions of stars in 20 fields observed with the\nVLT/FORS2 camera. The FORS2 position uncertainties are smaller than one\nmilli-arcsecond (mas) and allowed us to perform an independent verification of\nthe DR1 astrometric precision. In the fields that we observed with FORS2, we\nprojected the Gaia DR1 positions into the CCD plane, performed a polynomial fit\nbetween the two sets of matching stars, and carried out statistical analyses of\nthe residuals in positions. The residual RMS roughly matches the expectations\ngiven by the Gaia DR1 uncertainties, where we identified three regimes in terms\nof Gaia DR1 precision: for G = 17-20 stars we found that the formal DR1\nposition uncertainties of stars with DR1 precisions in the range of 0.5-5 mas\nare underestimated by 63 +/- 5\\%, whereas the DR1 uncertainties of stars in the\nrange 7-10 mas are overestimated by a factor of two. For the best-measured and\ngenerally brighter G = 16-18 stars with DR1 positional uncertainties of <0.5\nmas, we detected 0.44 +/- 0.13 mas excess noise in the residual RMS, whose\norigin can be in both FORS2 and Gaia DR1. By adopting Gaia DR1 as the absolute\nreference frame we refined the pixel scale determination of FORS2, leading to\nminor updates to the parallaxes of 20 ultracool dwarfs that we published\npreviously. We also updated the FORS2 absolute parallax of the Luhman 16 binary\nbrown dwarf system to 501.42 +/- 0.11 mas\n", "  Solar neutrinos interact within double-beta decay (\\BB) detectors and\ncontribute to backgrounds for \\BB\\ experiments. Background contributions due to\ncharge-current solar neutrino interactions with \\BB\\ nuclei of $^{76}$Ge,\n$^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, $^{136}$Xe, and $^{150}$Nd are evaluated.\nThey are shown to be significant for future high-sensitivity \\BB\\ experiments\nthat may search for Majorana neutrino masses in the inverted-hierarchy mass\nregion. The impact of solar neutrino backgrounds and their reduction are\ndiscussed for future \\BB\\ experiments.\n", "  A Floquet systems is a periodically driven quantum system. It can be\ndescribed by a Floquet operator. If this unitary operator has a gap in the\nspectrum, then one can define associated topological bulk invariants which can\neither only depend on the bands of the Floquet operator or also on the time as\na variable. It is shown how a K-theoretic result combined with the\nbulk-boundary correspondence leads to edge invariants for the half-space\nFloquet operators. These results also apply to topological quantum walks.\n", "  In this paper we discuss geodesic Witten diagrams in generic holographic\nconformal field theories with boundary or defect. Boundary CFTs allow two\ndifferent decompositions of two-point functions into conformal blocks: boundary\nchannel and ambient channel. Building on earlier work, we derive a holographic\ndual of the boundary channel decomposition in terms of bulk-to-bulk propagators\non lower dimensional AdS slices. In the situation in which we can treat the\nboundary or defect as a perturbation around pure AdS spacetime, we obtain the\nleading corrections to the two-point function both in boundary and ambient\nchannel in terms of geodesic Witten diagrams which exactly reproduce the\ndecomposition into corresponding conformal blocks on the field theory side.\n", "  In this work we examine the entanglement of the output signal-idler squeezed\nvacuum state in the Heisenberg picture as a function of the coupling and\ninternal propagation loss parameters of a microring resonator. Using the\nlog-negativity as a measure of entanglement for a mixed Gaussian state, we\nexamine the competitive effects of the transfer matrix that encodes the\nclassical phenomenological loss, as well as the matrix that that incorporates\nthe coupling and internal propagation loss due to the quantum Langevin noise\nfields required to preserve unitarity of the composite system,(signal-idler)\nand environment (noise) structure.\n", "  In this work we present numerical simulations of $10^5$ sub-Kolmogorov\ndeformable bubbles dispersed in Taylor-Couette flow (a wall-bounded shear\nsystem) with rotating inner cylinder and outer cylinder at rest. We study the\neffect of deformability of the bubbles on the overall drag induced by the\ncarrier fluid in the two-phase system. We find that an increase in\ndeformability of the bubbles results in enhanced drag reduction due to a more\npronounced accumulation of the deformed bubbles near the driving inner wall.\nThis preferential accumulation is induced by an increase in the resistance on\nthe motion of the bubbles in the wall-normal direction. The increased\nresistance is linked to the strong deformation of the bubbles near the wall\nwhich makes them prolate (stretched along one axes) and orient along the\nstream-wise direction. A larger concentration of the bubbles near the driving\nwall implies that they are more effective in weakening the plume ejections\nwhich results in stronger drag reduction effects. These simulations which are\npractically impossible with fully resolved techniques are made possible by\ncoupling a sub-grid deformation model with two-way coupled Euler-Lagrangian\ntracking of sub-Kolmogorov bubbles dispersed in a turbulent flow field which is\nsolved through direct numerical simulations. The bubbles are considered to be\nellipsoidal in shape and their deformation is governed by an evolution equation\nwhich depends on the local flow conditions and their surface tension.\n", "  The theory of Bloch electron dynamics for carriers in homogeneous electric\nand magnetic fields of arbitrary time dependence is developed in the framework\nof the Liouville equation. The Wigner distribution function (WDF) is determined\nfrom the single particle density matrix in the ballistic regime, i.e.,\ncollision effects are excluded. The single particle transport equation is\nestablished with the electric field described in the vector potential gauge,\nand the magnetic field is treated in the symmetric gauge.\n  The general approach is to employ the accelerated Bloch state representation\n(ABR) as a basis so that the dependence upon the electric field, including\nmultiband Zener tunneling, is treated exactly. In the formulation of the WDF,\nwe transform to a new set of variables so that the final WDF is gauge invariant\nand is expressed explicitly in terms of the position, kinetic momentum, and\ntime.\n  The methodology for developing the WDF is illustrated by deriving the exact\nWDF equation for free electrons in homogeneous electric and magnetic fields.\nThe methodology is then extended to the case of electrons described by an\neffective Hamiltonian corresponding to an arbitrary energy band function. In\ntreating the problem of Bloch electrons in a periodic potential, the\nmethodology for deriving the WDF reveals a multiband character due to the\ninherent nature of the Bloch states. In examining the single-band WDF, it is\nfound that the collisionless WDF equation matches the equivalent Boltzmann\ntransport equation to first order in the magnetic field. These results are\nnecessarily extended to second order in the magnetic field by employing a\nunitary transformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian using the ABR to\nsecond order. The work includes a discussion of the multiband WDF transport\nanalysis and the identification of the combined Zener-magnetic field induced\ntunneling.\n", "  In the random acceleration process a point particle moving in one dimension\nis accelerated by Gaussian white noise with zero mean. Although several\nfundamental statistical properties of the motion have been analyzed in detail,\nthe statistics of occupation times is still not well understood. We consider\nthe occupation or residence time $T_+$ on the positive $x$ axis of a particle\nwhich is randomly accelerated on the unbounded $x$ axis for a time $t$. The\nfirst two moments of $T_+$ were recently derived by Ouandji Boutcheng et al.\n\\cite{OB}. With an alternate approach utilizing basis functions which have\nproved useful in other studies of randomly accelerated motion, results for the\nfirst five moments are obtained in this paper.\n", "  We show the emergence of a new class of superconductivity in multiorbital\nsystems, focusing on non-Kramers f$^2$ states. The Cooper pairs in this class\nof superconductivity mainly consist of local pairs with the same symmetry as\nthe local f$^2$ ground states. When the local ground state is an anisotropic\nrepresentation, the superconducting gap has nodes on the Fermi surface. This\nnodal superconductivity is mediated by the strong onsite inter-orbital\nattractions as a consequence of negative-$U$ physics generalized to\nmultiorbital systems. We show that this is indeed realized in a simple\ntwo-orbital model with antiferro Hund's coupling and enhanced inter-orbital\ninteraction derived via a systematic local down folding. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss superconductivity in Pr-1-2-20 compounds, UBe$_{13}$, and\nPrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ in view of the present mechanism.\n", "  The phase of radio galaxy evolution after the jets have switched off, often\nreferred to as the remnant phase, is poorly understood and very few sources in\nthis phase are known. In this work we present an extensive search for remnant\nradio galaxies in the Lockman Hole, a well-studied extragalactic field. We\ncreate mock catalogues of low-power radio galaxies based on Monte Carlo\nsimulations to derive first-order predictions of the fraction of remnants in\nradio flux limited samples for comparison with our Lockman-Hole sample. We have\ncombined LOFAR observations at 150 MHz with public surveys at higher\nfrequencies to perform a complete selection and have used, for the first time,\na combination of spectral criteria (e.g. the classical ultra-steep spectral\nindex and high spectral curvature) as well as morphological criteria (e.g. low\nradio core prominence and relaxed shapes). Mock catalogues of radio galaxies\nare created based on existing spectral and dynamical evolution models combined\nwith observed source properties. We have identified 23 candidate remnant radio\ngalaxies which cover a variety of morphologies and spectral characteristics. We\nsuggest that these different properties are related to different stages of the\nremnant evolution. We find that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a\nfraction of our remnant sample suggesting a very rapid luminosity evolution of\nthe radio plasma. Results from mock catalogues demonstrate the importance of\ndynamical evolution in the remnant phase of low-power radio galaxies to obtain\nfractions of remnant sources consistent with our observations. Moreover, these\nresults confirm that ultra-steep spectrum remnants represent only a subset of\nthe entire population ($\\sim$50%) when frequencies higher than 1400 MHz are not\nincluded in the selection process, and that they are biased towards old ages.\n", "  Recent theory has demonstrated a novel physics regime for magnetic\nreconnection in high-energy-density plasmas where the magnetic field is\nadvected by heat flux via the Nernst effect. Here we elucidate the physics of\nthe electron dissipation layer in this regime. Through fully kinetic simulation\nand a generalized Ohm's law derived from first principles, we show that\nmomentum transport due to a nonlocal effect, the heat-flux-viscosity, provides\nthe dissipation mechanism for magnetic reconnection. Scaling analysis and\nsimulations show that the reconnection process is comprised of a magnetic field\ncompression stage and quasi-steady reconnection stage, and the characteristic\nwidth of the current sheet in this regime is several electron mean-free-paths.\nThese results show the important interplay between nonlocal transport effects\nand generation of anisotropic components to the distribution function.\n", "  The transfer reaction between two nuclei in the superfluid phase is studied\nwith the Time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) theory. In order to\nrestore the symmetry of the relative gauge angle a set of independent TDHFB\nevolutions is done. Then the transfer probability is computed using a triple\nprojection method. This method is first tested to determine the transfer\nprobabilities on a toy model and compared to the exact solution. It is then\napplied to the reactions $^{20}$O+$^{20}$O and $^{14}$O+$^{20}$O in a realistic\nframework with a Gogny interaction.\n", "  Conjugate metamaterials, in which the permittivity and the permeability are\ncomplex conjugates of each other, possess the elements of loss and gain\nsimultaneously. By employing a conjugate metamaterial with a purely imaginary\nform, we propose a mechanism for realizing both coherent perfect absorber (CPA)\nand laser modes, which have been widely investigated in parity-time symmetric\nsystems. Moreover, the general conditions for obtaining CPA and laser modes,\nincluding obtaining them simultaneously, are revealed by analyzing the wave\nscattering properties of a slab made of purely imaginary conjugate\nmetamaterials. Specifically, in a purely imaginary conjugate metamaterial slab\nwith a sub-unity effective refractive index, perfect absorption can be realized\nfor the incident wave from air.\n", "  It has recently been shown that the phenomenologically successful pattern of\ncobimaximal neutrino mixing ($\\theta_{13} \\neq 0$, $\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$, and\n$\\delta_{CP} = \\pm \\pi/2$) may be achieved in the context of the non-Abelian\ndiscrete symmetry $A_4$, if the neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by an\northogonal matrix ${\\cal O}$. We study how this pattern would deviate if ${\\cal\nO}$ is replaced by an unitary matrix.\n", "  We employ the Noether procedure to derive a general formula for the radially\nconserved heat current in AdS planar black holes with certain transverse and\ntraceless perturbations, for a general class of gravity theories. For Einstein\ngravity, the general higher-order Lovelock gravities and also a class of\nHorndeski gravities, we derive the boundary stress tensor and show that the\nresulting boundary heat current matches precisely the bulk Noether current.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of two nonets of excited vector mesons,\n$\\{\\rho(1450)$, $K^{\\ast}(1410)$, $\\omega(1420)$, $\\phi(1680)\\}$ and\n$\\{\\rho(1700),$ $K^{\\ast}(1680),\\omega(1650),$ $\\phi(???)\\},$ which (roughly)\ncorrespond to radially excited $2^{3}S_{1}$ and to orbitally excited\n$1^{3}D_{1}$ vector mesons. We evaluate the strong and radiative decays of\nthese mesons into pseudoscalar and ground-state vector mesons by using an\neffective relativistic QFT model based on flavour symmetry. We compare decay\nwidths and branching ratios with various experimental results listed in the\nPDG. An overall agreement of theory with experiment reinforces the standard\nquark-antiquark assignment of the resonances mentioned above. Predictions for\nnot yet measured quantities are also made. In particular, we shall also make\npredictions for the not-yet discovered $s\\bar{s}$ state of the $1^{3}D_{1}$\nnonet, denoted as $\\phi(???)$. Its mass can be estimated to be about $1930$\nMeV, hence we shall call this putative state $\\phi(1930).$ Its main decays are\ninto $KK^{\\ast}(892)$ (about $200$ MeV) and $KK$ (about $100$ MeV). Since this\nstate couples also to $\\gamma\\eta,$ it can be searched in the near future in\nthe photoproduction-based experiments GlueX and CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab.\n", "  Cold collisions of $^{14}$N$^{16}$O molecules in the $^{2}\\Pi_{1/2}$ ground\nstate, subject to electric and magnetic fields, are investigated. It is found\nthat elastic collision rates significantly exceed state-changing inelastic\nrates only at temperatures above 0.5 K at laboratory strength fields. It is\nfound, however, that in very large fields $> 10^{4}$ V/cm, inelastic rates can\nbe somewhat suppressed. Magnetic fields have negligible influence on scattering\nfor this nearly non-magnetic state.\n", "  We describe a method for coupling an embedded domain in a magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulation with a particle-in-cell (PIC) method. In this two-way coupling\nwe follow the work of Daldorff et al. in which the PIC domain receives its\ninitial and boundary conditions from MHD variables (MHD to PIC coupling) while\nthe MHD simulation is updated based on the PIC variables (PIC to MHD coupling).\nThis method can be useful for simulating large plasma systems, where kinetic\neffects captured by particle-in-cell simulations are localized but affect\nglobal dynamics. We describe the numerical implementation of this coupling, its\ntime-stepping algorithm, and its parallelization strategy, emphasizing the\nnovel aspects of it. We test the stability and energy/momentum conservation of\nthis method by simulating a steady-state plasma. We test the dynamics of this\ncoupling by propagating plasma waves through the embedded PIC domain. Coupling\nwith MHD shows satisfactory results for the fast magnetosonic wave, but\nsignificant distortion for the circularly polarized Alfv\\'en wave. Coupling\nwith Hall-MHD shows excellent coupling for the whistler wave. We also apply\nthis methodology to simulate a Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) challenge\ntype of reconnection with the diffusion region simulated by PIC coupled to\nlarger scales with MHD and Hall-MHD. In both these cases we see the expected\nsignatures of kinetic reconnection in the PIC domain, implying that this method\ncan be used for reconnection studies.\n", "  Perturbative anticrossings have long been identified as a potential\ncomputational bottleneck for quantum annealing. This bottleneck can appear, for\nexample, when a uniform transverse driver Hamiltonian is applied to each qubit.\nPrevious theoretical research sought to alleviate such anticrossings by\nadjusting the transverse driver Hamiltonians on individual qubits according to\na perturbative approximation. Here we apply this principle to a physical\nimplementation of quantum annealing in a D-Wave 2000Q system. We use samples\nfrom the quantum annealing hardware and per-qubit anneal offsets to produce\nnonuniform driver Hamiltonians. On small instances with severe perturbative\nanticrossings, our algorithm yields an increase in minimum eigengaps, ground\nstate success probabilities, and escape rates from metastable valleys. We also\ndemonstrate that the same approach can mitigate biased sampling of degenerate\nground states.\n", "  We present explicit, analytical heating formulas that predict the heating\nrates of spherical, nonneutral plasmas stored in a Paul trap as a function of\ncloud size $S$, particle number $N$, and Paul-trap control parameter $q$ in the\nlow-temperature regime close to the cloud $\\rightarrow$ crystal phase\ntransition. We find excellent agreement between our analytical heating formulas\nand detailed, time-dependent molecular-dynamics simulations of the trapped\nplasmas. We also present the results of our numerical solutions of a\ntemperature-dependent mean-field equation, which are consistent with our\nnumerical simulations and our analytical results. This is the first time that\nanalytical heating formulas are presented that predict heating rates with\nreasonable accuracy, uniformly for all $S$, $N$, and $q$.\n", "  We have developed a computational code, DynaPhoPy, that allow us to extract\nthe microscopic anharmonic phonon properties from molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations using the normal-mode-decomposition technique as presented by Sun\net al. [T. Sun, D. Zhang, R. Wentzcovitch, 2014]. Using this code we calculated\nthe quasiparticle phonon frequencies and linewidths of crystalline silicon at\ndifferent temperatures using both of first-principles and the Tersoff empirical\npotential approaches. In this work we show the dependence of these properties\non the temperature using both approaches and compare them with reported\nexperimental data obtained by Raman spectroscopy [M. Balkanski, R. Wallis, E.\nHaro, 1983 and R. Tsu, J. G. Hernandez, 1982].\n", "  A novel algorithm for the ultrashort laser pulse characterization method of\ninterferometric frequency-resolved optical gating (iFROG) is presented. Based\non a genetic method, namely differential evolution, the algorithm can exploit\nall available information of an iFROG measurement to retrieve the complex\nelectric field of a pulse. The retrieval is subjected to a series of numerical\ntests to prove robustness of the algorithm against experimental artifacts and\nnoise. These tests show that the integrated error-correction mechanisms of the\niFROG method can be successfully used to remove the effect from timing errors\nand spectrally varying efficiency in the detection. Moreover, the accuracy and\nnoise resilience of the new algorithm are shown to outperform retrieval based\non the generalized projections algorithm, which is widely used as the standard\nmethod in FROG retrieval. The differential evolution algorithm is further\nvalidated with experimental data, measured with unamplified three-cycle pulses\nfrom a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. Additionally introducing group delay\ndispersion in the beam path, the retrieval results show excellent agreement\nwith independent measurements with a commercial pulse measurement device based\non spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field retrieval. Further\nexperimental tests with strongly attenuated pulses indicate resilience of\ndifferential evolution based retrieval against massive measurement noise.\n", "  In this paper we undertake an analysis of the eigenstates of two non\nself-adjoint operators $\\hat q$ and $\\hat p$ similar, in a suitable sense, to\nthe self-adjoint position and momentum operators $\\hat q_0$ and $\\hat p_0$\nusually adopted in ordinary quantum mechanics. In particular we discuss\nconditions for these eigenstates to be {\\em biorthogonal distributions}, and we\ndiscuss few of their properties. We illustrate our results with two examples,\none in which the similarity map between the self-adjoint and the non\nself-adjoint is bounded, with bounded inverse, and the other in which this is\nnot true. We also briefly propose an alternative strategy to deal with $\\hat q$\nand $\\hat p$, based on the so-called {\\em quasi *-algebras}.\n", "  We propose characterization of the three-dimensional topological insulator by\nusing the Chern number for the entanglement Hamiltonian (entanglement Chern\nnumber). Here we take the extensive spin partition of the system, that pulls\nout the quantum entanglement between up spin and down spin of the many-body\nground state. In three dimensions, the topological insulator phase is described\nby the section entanglement Chern number, which is the entanglement Chern\nnumber for a periodic plane in the Brillouin zone. The section entanglement\nChern number serves as an interpolation of the $Z_2$ invariants defined on\ntime-reversal invariant planes. We find that the change of the section\nentanglement Chern number protects the Weyl point of the entanglement\nHamiltonian and the parity of the number of Weyl points distinguishes the\nstrong topological insulator phase from the weak topological insulator phase.\n", "  We currently live in the age of the CKM paradigm. The $3\\times 3$ matrix that\nlinks $(d,\\ s,\\ b)$ quarks to $(u,\\ c,\\ t)$ in the charged current weak\ninteraction, being complex and nominally with 18 parameters, can be accounted\nfor by just 3 rotation angles and one $CP$ violating (CPV) phase, with\nunitarity and the CKM phases triumphantly tested at the B factories. But the\nCKM picture is unsatisfactory and has too many parameters. The main aim of\nFlavor Physics and $CP$ violation (FPCP) studies is the pursuit to uncover New\nPhysics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Two highlights of LHC Run~1 period are\nthe CPV phase $\\phi_s$ of $B_s$ mixing and $B_s \\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, which\nwere found to be again consistent with SM, though the saga is yet unfinished.\nWe also saw the emergence of the $P_5'$ angular variable anomaly in $B^0 \\to\nK^{*0}\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomaly in $B \\to K^{(*)}\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nto $B \\to K^{(*)}e^+e^-$ rate ratios, and the BaBar anomaly in $B \\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ decays, which suggest possible New Physics in these flavor\nprocesses, pointing to extra $Z'$, charged Higgs, or leptoquarks. Charmless\nhadronic, semileptonic, purely leptonic and radiative $B$ decays continue to\noffer various further windows on New Physics. Away from $B$ physics, the rare\n$K \\to \\pi\\nu\\nu$ decays and $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ in the kaon sector,\n$\\mu \\to e$ transitions, muon $g-2$ and electric dipole moments of the neutron\nand electron, $\\tau \\to \\mu\\gamma,\\ \\mu\\mu\\mu,\\ eee$, and a few charm physics\nprobes, offer broadband frontier windows on New Physics. (See the document for\nthe full abstract.)\n", "  The so-called $\\Gamma\\Gamma$-form of the gravitational Lagrangian, long known\nto provide its most compact expression as well as the most efficient generation\nof the graviton vertices, is taken as the starting point for discussing General\nRelativity as a theory of the self-interacting graviton. A straightforward but\ngeneral method of converting to a covariant formulation by the introduction of\na reference metric is given. It is used to recast the Einstein field equation\nas the equation of motion of a spin-2 particle interacting with the canonical\nenergy-momentum tensor symmetrized by the standard Belinfante method applicable\nto any field carrying nonzero spin. This represents the graviton field equation\nin a form complying with the precepts of standard field theory. It is then\nshown how representations based on other, at face value completely unrelated\ndefinitions of energy-momentum (pseudo)tensors are all related by the addition\nof appropriate superpotential terms. Specifically, the superpotentials are\nexplicitly constructed which connect to: i) the common definition consisting\nsimply of the nonlinear part of the Einstein tensor; ii) the Landau-Lifshitz\ndefinition.\n", "  Fermi operator expansion (FOE) methods are powerful alternatives to\ndiagonalization type methods for solving Kohn-Sham density functional theory\n(KSDFT). One example is the pole expansion and selected inversion (PEXSI)\nmethod, which approximates the Fermi operator by rational matrix functions and\nreduces the computational complexity to at most quadratic scaling for solving\nKSDFT. Unlike diagonalization type methods, the chemical potential often cannot\nbe directly read off from the result of a single step of evaluation of the\nFermi operator. Hence multiple evaluations are needed to be sequentially\nperformed to compute the chemical potential to ensure the correct number of\nelectrons within a given tolerance. This hinders the performance of FOE methods\nin practice. In this paper we develop an efficient and robust strategy to\ndetermine the chemical potential in the context of the PEXSI method. The main\nidea of the new method is not to find the exact chemical potential at each\nself-consistent-field (SCF) iteration iteration, but to dynamically and\nrigorously update the upper and lower bounds for the true chemical potential,\nso that the chemical potential reaches its convergence along the SCF iteration.\nInstead of evaluating the Fermi operator for multiple times sequentially, our\nmethod uses a two-level strategy that evaluates the Fermi operators in\nparallel. In the regime of full parallelization, the wall clock time of each\nSCF iteration is always close to the time for one single evaluation of the\nFermi operator, even when the initial guess is far away from the converged\nsolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method using examples\nwith metallic and insulating characters, as well as results from ab initio\nmolecular dynamics.\n", "  The impact of impurities on the generation of zonal flow (ZF) driven by\ncollisonless trapped electron mode (CTEM) turbulence in deuterium (D)-tritium\n(T) plasmas is investigated. The expression for ZF growth rate with impurities\nis derived by balancing the ZF potential shielded by polarization effects and\nthe ZF modulated radial turbulent current. Then, it is shown that the maximum\nnormalized ZF growth rate is reduced by the presence of the fully ionized\nnon-trace light impurities with relatively flat density profile, and slightly\nreduced by highly ionized trace tungsten (W). While, the maximum normalized ZF\ngrowth rate can be also enhanced by fully ionized non-trace light impurities\nwith relatively steep density profile. In particular, the effects of high\ntemperature helium from D-T reaction on ZF depend on the temperature ratio\nbetween electron and high temperature helium. The possible relevance of our\nfindings to recent experimental results and future burning plasmas is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We derive an all-order factorization theorem for the narrow jet broadening\nevent shape, a measure of the transverse momentum in jet events. This is a\nnon-global observable which receives logarithmically enhanced contributions\nassociated with the large rapidity difference between soft and collinear\nradiation and which is also sensitive to soft recoil effects. Our work is the\nfirst factorization analysis of an observable of this type and we show that\nwith regard to the non-global nature, the rapidity logarithms do not constitute\nan essential complication since they can be tied to the jet function, which is\nthe same as for global observables. As a consequence, the leading non-global\nlogarithms in narrow jet broadening are encoded in the same overall factor\nrelevant for the hemisphere soft function and light jet mass.\n", "  HW Vir systems are rare evolved eclipsing binaries composed by a hot compact\nstar and a low-mass main-sequence star in a close orbit. These systems provide\na direct way to measure the fundamental properties, e.g. masses and radii, of\ntheir components, hence they are crucial to study the formation of sdB stars\nand low-mass white dwarfs, the common-envelope phase, and the pre-phase of\ncataclysmic variables. Here we present a detailed study of HS 2231+2441, an HW\nVir type system, by analysing BVR$_C$I$_C$ photometry and phase-resolved\noptical spectroscopy. The spectra of this system, which are dominated by the\nprimary component features, were fitted using NLTE models providing effective\ntemperature Teff = 28500$\\pm$500 K, surface gravity log g = 5.40$\\pm$0.05 cm\ns$^{-2}$, and helium abundance log(n(He)/n(H)) = -2.52$\\pm$0.07. Geometrical\norbit and physical parameters were derived by modelling simultaneously the\nphotometric and spectroscopic data using the Wilson-Devinney code. We derive\ntwo possible solutions for HS 2231+2441 that provide component's masses: M$_1$\n= 0.19 M$_{\\odot}$ and M$_2$ = 0.036 M$_{\\odot}$ or M$_1$ = 0.288 M$_{\\odot}$\nand M$_2$ = 0.046 M$_{\\odot}$. Considering the possible evolutionary channels\nto form a compact hot star, the primary of HS 2231+2441 probably evolved\nthrough the red-giant branch scenario and does not have a helium-burning core,\nwhich is consistent with a low-mass white dwarf. Both solutions are consistent\nwith a brown dwarf as the secondary.\n", "  Compared to traditional pn-junction photovoltaics, hot carrier solar cells\noffer potentially higher efficiency by extracting work from the kinetic energy\nof photogenerated \"hot carriers\" before they cool to the lattice temperature.\nHot carrier solar cells have been demonstrated in high-bandgap ferroelectric\ninsulators and GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, but so far not in low-bandgap\nmaterials, where the potential efficiency gain is highest. Recently, a high\nopen-circuit voltage was demonstrated in an illuminated wurtzite InAs nanowire\nwith a low bandgap of 0.39 eV, and was interpreted in terms of a\nphotothermoelectric effect. Here, we point out that this device is a hot\ncarrier solar cell and discuss its performance in those terms. In the\ndemonstrated devices, InP heterostructures are used as energy filters in order\nto thermoelectrically harvest the energy of hot electrons photogenerated in\nInAs absorber segments. The obtained photovoltage depends on the\nheterostructure design of the energy filter and is therefore tunable. By using\na high-resistance, thermionic barrier an open-circuit voltage is obtained that\nis in excess of the Shockley-Queisser limit. These results provide\ngeneralizable insight into how to realize high voltage hot carrier solar cells\nin low-bandgap materials, and therefore are a step towards the demonstration of\nhigher efficiency hot carrier solar cells.\n", "  We present an example of an interpolation code of the SAHA-S equation of\nstate that has been adapted for use in the stellar evolution code CESAM2k. The\naim is to provide the necessary data and numerical procedures for its\nimplementation in a stellar code. A technical problem is the discrepancy\nbetween the sets of thermodynamic quantities provided by the SAHA-S equation of\nstate and those necessary in the CESAM2k computations. Moreover, the\nindependent variables in a practical equation of state (like SAHA-S) are\ntemperature and density, whereas for modelling calculations the variables\ntemperature and pressure are preferable. Specifically for the CESAM2k code,\nsome additional quantities and their derivatives must be provided. To provide\nthe bridge between the equation of state and stellar modelling, we prepare\nauxiliary tables of the quantities that are demanded in CESAM2k. Then we use\ncubic spline interpolation to provide both smoothness and a good approximation\nof the necessary derivatives. Using the B-form of spline representation\nprovides us with an efficient algorithm for three-dimensional interpolation.\nThe table of B-spline coefficients provided can be directly used during stellar\nmodel calculations together with the module of cubic spline interpolation. This\nimplementation of the SAHA-S equation of state in the CESAM2k stellar structure\nand evolution code has been tested on a solar model evolved to the present. A\ncomparison with other equations of state is briefly discussed. The choice of a\nregular net of mesh points for specific primary quantities in the SAHA-S\nequation of state, together with accurate and consistently smooth tabulated\nvalues, provides an effective algorithm of interpolation in modelling\ncalculations. The proposed module of interpolation procedures can be easily\nadopted in other evolution codes.\n", "  The production of high-quality electron bunches in Laser Wake Field\nAcceleration relies on the possibility to inject ultra-low emittance bunches in\nthe plasma wave. In this paper we present a new bunch injection scheme in which\nelectrons extracted by ionization are trapped by a large-amplitude plasma wave\ndriven by a train of resonant ultrashort pulses. In the REsonant Multi-Pulse\nIonization (REMPI) injection scheme, the main portion of a single ultrashort\n(e.g Ti:Sa) laser system pulse is temporally shaped as a sequence of resonant\nsub-pulses, while a minor portion acts as an ionizing pulse. Simulations show\nthat high-quality electron bunches with normalized emittance as low as $0.08$\nmm$\\times$mrad and $0.65\\%$ energy spread can be obtained with a single\npresent-day 100TW-class Ti:Sa laser system.\n", "  The effective action for reggeized gluons is based on the gluodynamic\nYang-Mills Lagrangian with external current for longitudinal gluons added, see\n[1]. On the base of classical solutions, obtained in [2], the one-loop\ncorrections to this effective action in light-cone gauge are calculated. The\nRFT calculus for reggeized gluons similarly to the RFT introduced in [3] is\nproposed and discussed. The correctness of the results is verified by\ncalculation of the propagator of $A_{+}$ and $A_{-}$ reggeized gluons fields\nand application of the obtained results is discussed as well.\n", "  The eROSITA mission will provide the largest sample of galaxy clusters\ndetected in X-ray to date (one hundred thousand expected). This sample will be\nused to constrain cosmological models by measuring cluster masses. An important\nmass proxy is the electron temperature of the hot plasma detected in X-rays. We\nwant to understand the detection properties and possible bias in temperatures\ndue to unresolved substructures in the cluster halos. We simulated a large\nnumber of galaxy cluster spectra with known temperature substructures and\ncompared the results from analysing eROSITA simulated observations to earlier\nresults from Chandra. We were able to constrain a bias in cluster temperatures\nand its impact on cluster masses as well as cosmological parameters derived\nfrom the survey. We found temperatures in the eROSITA survey to be biased low\nby about five per cent due to unresolved temperature substructures (compared to\nemission-weighted average temperatures from the Chandra maps). This bias would\nhave a significant impact on the eROSITA cosmology constraints if not accounted\nfor in the calibration. We isolated the bias effect that substructures in\ngalaxy clusters have on temperature measurements and their impact on derived\ncosmological parameters in the eROSITA cluster survey.\n", "  We study the conductance fluctuation in topological semimetals. Through\nstatistic distribution of energy levels of topological semimetals, we determine\nthe dominant parameters of universal conductance fluctuation (UCF), i.e., the\nnumber of uncorrelated bands $k$, the level degeneracy $s$, and the symmetry\nparameter $\\beta$. These parameters allow us to predict the zero-temperature\nintrinsic UCF of topological semimetals by the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory.\nThen, we obtain numerically the conductance fluctuations for topological\nsemimetals of quasi-1D geometry. We find that for Dirac/Weyl semimetals, the\ntheoretical prediction coincides with the numerical results. However, a\nnon-universal conductance fluctuation behavior is found for topological nodal\nline semimetals, i.e., the conductance fluctuation amplitude increases with the\nenlargement of SOC strength. We find that such unexpected parameter-dependent\nphenomena of conductance fluctuation are related to Fermi surface shape of 3D\ntopological semimetals. These results will help us to understand the existing\nand future experimental results of UCF in 3D topological semimetals.\n", "  Number of known symbiotic stars (SySt) is still significantly lower than\ntheir predicted population. One of the main problems in finding complete\npopulation of SySt is the fact that their spectrum can be confused with other\nobjects, such as planetary nebulae (PNe) or dense H II regions. The problem is\nreinforced by a fact that in significant fraction of established SySt the\nemission lines used to distinguish them from other objects are not present. We\naim at finding new diagnostic diagrams that could help separate SySt from PNe.\nAdditionally, we examine known sample of extragalactic PNe for candidate SySt.\nWe employed emission line fluxes of known SySt and PNe from the literature. We\nfound that among the forbidden lines in the optical region of spectrum, only\nthe [O III] and [N II] lines can be used as a tool for distinguishing between\nSySt and PNe, which is consistent with the fact that they have the highest\ncritical densities. The most useful diagnostic that we propose is based on He I\nlines which are more common and stronger in SySt than forbidden lines. All\nthese useful diagnostic diagrams are electron density indicators that better\ndistinguishes PNe and ionized symbiotic nebulae. Moreover, we found six new\ncandidate SySt in the Large Magellanic Cloud and one in M81. If confirmed, the\ncandidate in M81 would be the furthest known SySt thus far.\n", "  In our recent work, we demonstrated that a novel X-ray scaling method,\noriginally introduced for Galactic black holes, could be reliably extended to\nestimate the mass of supermassive black holes accreting at moderate to high\nlevel. Here, we apply this X-ray scaling method to ultraluminous X-ray sources\n(ULXs) to constrain their \\mbh. Using 49 ULXs with multiple \\xmm\\ observations,\nwe infer that ULXs host both stellar mass BHs and intermediate mass BHs. The\nmajority of the sources of our sample seem to be consistent with the hypothesis\nof highly accreting massive stellar BHs with $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim100\\,M_{\\odot}$.\nOur results are in general agreement with the \\mbh\\ values obtained with\nalternative methods, including model-independent variability methods. This\nsuggests that the X-ray scaling method is an actual scale-independent method\nthat can be applied to all BH systems accreting at moderate-high rate.\n", "  Single-cell gene expression is inherently stochastic; its emergent behavior\ncan be defined in terms of the chemical master equation describing the\nevolution of the mRNA and protein copy numbers as the latter tends to infinity.\nWe establish two types of \"macroscopic limits\": the Kurtz limit is consistent\nwith the classical chemical kinetics, while the L\\'{e}vy limit provides a\ntheoretical foundation for an empirical equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n97:168302, 2006]. Furthermore, we clarify the biochemical implications and\nranges of applicability for various macroscopic limits and calculate a\ncomprehensive analytic expression for the protein concentration distribution in\nautoregulatory gene networks. The relationship between our work and modern\npopulation genetics is discussed.\n", "  The Juno Orbiter has provided improved estimates of the even gravitational\nharmonics J2 to J8 of Jupiter. To compute higher-order moments, new methods\nsuch as the Concentric Maclaurin Spheroids (CMS) method have been developed\nwhich surpass the so far commonly used Theory of Figures (ToF) method in\naccuracy. This progress rises the question whether ToF can still provide a\nuseful service for deriving the internal structure of giant planets in the\nSolar system. In this paper, I apply both the ToF and the CMS method to compare\nresults for polytropic Jupiter and for the physical equation of state\nH/He-REOS.3 based models. An accuracy in the computed values of J2 and J4 of\n0.1% is found to be sufficient in order to obtain the core mass safely within\n0.5 Mearth numerical accuracy and the atmospheric metallicity within about\n0.0004. ToF to 4th order provides that accuracy, while ToF to 3rd order does\nnot for J4. Furthermore, I find that the assumption of rigid rotation yields J6\nand J8 values in agreement with the current Juno estimates, and that higher\norder terms (J10 to J18) deviate by about 10% from predictions by polytropic\nmodels. This work suggests that ToF4 can still be applied to infer the deep\ninternal structure, and that the zonal winds on Jupiter reach less deep than\n0.9 RJup.\n", "  We present a more refined version of rational extended thermodynamics of\nrarefied polyatomic gases in which molecular rotational and vibrational\nrelaxation processes are treated individually. In this case we need a triple\nhierarchy of the moment system and the system of balance equations is closed\nvia the maximum entropy principle. Three different types of the production\nterms in the system, which are suggested by a generalized BGK-type collision\nterm in the Boltzmann equation, are adopted. In particular, the rational\nextended thermodynamic theory with seven independent fields (ET7) is analyzed\nin detail. Finally, the dispersion relation of ultrasonic wave derived from the\nET7 theory is confirmed by the experimental data for CO2, Cl2, and Br2 gases.\n", "  We classify the meson and baryon long lived resonances considering quarks\nwith electric charge 5/3 and $-4/3$ (in units of $\\vert e\\vert$) predicted by\nsome 3-3-1 models. Some of these exotic resonances have the usual electric\ncharges $0,\\pm1$, others have $\\pm(3,4,5)$, and the lightest ones decaying only\ninto leptons plus known resonances. We propose another heavy $SU(3)_H$ global\nsymmetry under which hadrons involving only exotic quarks can be constructed.\n", "  We present several families of nonlinear reaction diffusion equations with\nvariable coefficients including Fisher-KPP and Burgers type equations. Special\nexact solutions such as traveling wave, rational, triangular wave and N-wave\ntype solutions are shown. By means of similarity transformations the variable\ncoefficients are conditioned to satisfy Riccati or Ermakov systems of\nequations. When the Riccati system is used, conditions are established so that\nfinite-time singularities might occur. The solutions presented contain\nmulti-parameters providing a control on the dynamics of the solutions. In the\nsuplementary material, we provide a computer algebra verification of the\nsolutions and exemplify nontrivial dynamics of the solutions.\n", "  We consider a system of clusters made of elementary building blocks,\nmonomers, and evolving via collisions between diffusing monomers and immobile\ncomposite clusters. In our model, the cluster-monomer collision can lead to the\nattachment of the monomer to the cluster (addition process) or to the total\nbreak-up of the cluster (shattering process). A phase transition, separating\nqualitatively different behaviors, occurs when the probability of shattering\nevents exceeds a certain threshold. The novel feature of the phase transition\nis the dramatic dependence on the initial conditions.\n", "  We present an explicitly correlated formalism for the second-order\nsingle-particle Green's function method (GF2-F12) that does not assume the\npopular diagonal approximation, and describes the energy dependence of the\nexplicitly correlated terms. For small and medium organic molecules the basis\nset errors of ionization potentials of GF2-F12 are radically improved relative\nto GF2: the performance of GF2-F12/aug- cc-pVDZ is better than that of\nGF2/aug-cc-pVQZ, at a significantly lower cost.\n", "  The electrical conductivity in dense plasmas can be calculated with the\nrelaxation-time approximation provided that the interaction potential between\nthe scattering electron and the ion is known. To date there has been\nconsiderable uncertainty as to the best way to define this interaction\npotential so that it correctly includes the effects of ionic structure,\nscreening by electrons and partial ionization. Current approximations lead to\nsignificantly different results with varying levels of agreement when compared\nto bench-mark calculations and experiments. We present a new way to define this\npotential, drawing on ideas from classical fluid theory to define a potential\nof mean force. This new potential results in significantly improved agreement\nwith experiments and bench mark calculations, and includes all the\naforementioned physics self-consistently.\n", "  A fluid system bounded by a flat bottom and a flat surface with an internal\nwave and depth-dependent current is considered. The Hamiltonian of the system\nis presented and the dynamics of the system are discussed. A long-wave regime\nis then considered and extended to produce a KdV approximation. Finally, a\nsolitary wave solution is obtained.\n", "  The statistical significance of a candidate gravitational-wave (GW) event is\ncrucial to the prospects for a confirmed detection, or for its selection as a\ncandidate for follow-up electromagnetic observation. To determine the\nsignificance of a GW candidate, a ranking statistic is evaluated and compared\nto an empirically-estimated background distribution, yielding a false alarm\nprobability or p-value. The reliability of this background estimate is limited\nby the number of background samples and by the fact that GW detectors cannot be\nshielded from signals, making it impossible to identify a pure background data\nset. Different strategies have been proposed: in one method, all samples,\nincluding potential signals, are included in the background estimation, whereas\nin another method, coincidence removal is performed in order to exclude\npossible signals from the estimated background. Here we report on a mock data\nchallenge, performed prior to the first detections of GW signals by Advanced\nLIGO, to compare these two methods. The all-samples method is found to be\nself-consistent in terms of the rate of false positive detection claims, but\nits p-value estimates are systematically conservative and subject to higher\nvariance. Conversely, the coincidence-removal method yields a mean-unbiased\nestimate of the p-value but sacrifices self-consistency. We provide a simple\nformula for the uncertainty in estimate significance and compare it to mock\ndata results. Finally, we discuss the use of different methods in claiming the\ndetection of GW signals.\n", "  The production of a neutral and a charged vector boson with subsequent decays\ninto three charged leptons and a neutrino is a very important process for\nprecision tests of the Standard Model of elementary particles and in searches\nfor anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings. In this article, the first\ncomputation of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to the production\nof the four-lepton final states $\\mu^+\\mu^- e^+ \\nu_e$, $\\mu^+\\mu^- e^-\n\\bar\\nu_e$, $\\mu^+\\mu^- \\mu^+\\nu_\\mu$, and $\\mu^+\\mu^- \\mu^- \\bar\\nu_\\mu$ at\nthe Large Hadron Collider is presented. We use the complete matrix elements at\nleading and next-to-leading order, including all off-shell effects of\nintermediate massive vector bosons and virtual photons. The relative\nelectroweak corrections to the fiducial cross sections from quark-induced\npartonic processes vary between $-3\\%$ and $-6\\%$, depending significantly on\nthe event selection. At the level of differential distributions, we observe\nlarge negative corrections of up to $-30\\%$ in the high-energy tails of\ndistributions originating from electroweak Sudakov logarithms. Photon-induced\ncontributions at next-to-leading order raise the leading-order fiducial cross\nsection by $+2\\%$. Interference effects in final states with equal-flavour\nleptons are at the permille level for the fiducial cross section, but can lead\nto sizeable effects in off-shell sensitive phase-space regions.\n", "  We report the first results from a search for transiting warm Jupiter\nexoplanets - gas giant planets receiving stellar irradiation below about $10^8$\nerg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, equivalent to orbital periods beyond about 10 days\naround Sun-like stars. We have discovered two transiting warm Jupiter\nexoplanets initially identified as transiting candidates in ${\\it K2}$\nphotometry. K2-114b has a mass of $1.85^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\\ M_J$, a radius of\n$0.942^{+0.032}_{-0.020}\\ R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.4 days. K2-115b has\na mass of $0.84^{+0.18}_{-0.20}\\ M_J$, a radius of $1.115^{+0.057}_{-0.061}\\\nR_J$, and an orbital period of 20.3 days. Both planets are among the longest\nperiod transiting gas giant planets with a measured mass, and they are orbiting\nrelatively old host stars. Both planets are not inflated as their radii are\nconsistent with theoretical expectations. Their position in the planet radius -\nstellar irradiation diagram is consistent with the scenario where the radius -\nirradiation correlation levels off below about 10$^8$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,\nsuggesting that for warm Jupiters the stellar irradiation does not play a\nsignificant role in determining the planet radius. We also report our\nidentification of another ${\\it K2}$ transiting warm Jupiter candidate, EPIC\n212504617, as a false positive.\n", "  Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to address numerous\nquestions in astrophysics and cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and\nphotometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to study gas and dust along the\nlines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral\ncontinuum of SNe Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust\nalong the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which occurred in an unusual location, in\na tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods. Using a\ntime-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K\nabsorption features for variations in time, which would be indicative for\ncircumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore, we take advantage of the well known\nphotometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to dust along the\nline-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we\ndetermine that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS\nmedium of iPTF16abc. While the Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be\noptically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points to a small column of\ninterstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight to\niPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwithin a galaxy. It suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally\nstripped during an interaction of NGC 5221 with one of its neighbouring\ngalaxies in the past $\\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds could\nbecome the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds\nmight diffuse, enriching the circum-galactic medium (CGM) with metals. The gas\nprofile along the line-of-sight should be useful for future studies of the\ndynamics of the galaxy group containing NGC 5221.\n", "  A Double Field Theory (DFT) description of gauge symmetry enhancing-breaking\nin the heterotic string is presented. The construction, based on previous\nresults for the bosonic string, relies on the extension of the tangent frame of\nDFT. The fluxes of a Scherk-Schwarz like generalized toroidal compactification\nare moduli dependent and become identified with the structure constants of the\nenhanced group at fixed \"self-dual\" points in moduli space. Slight\ndisplacements from such points provide the breaking of the symmetry, gauge\nbosons acquiring masses proportional to fluxes. The inclusion of fermions is\nalso discussed.\n", "  X-ray emission is one of the signposts of circumstellar interaction in\nsupernovae (SNe), but until now, it has been observed only in core-collapse\nSNe. The level of thermal X-ray emission is a direct measure of the density of\nthe circumstellar medium (CSM), and the absence of X-ray emission from Type Ia\nSNe has been interpreted as a sign of a very low density CSM. In this paper, we\nreport late-time (500--800 days after discovery) X-ray detections of SN 2012ca\nin {\\it Chandra} data. The presence of hydrogen in the initial spectrum led to\na classification of Type Ia-CSM, ostensibly making it the first SN~Ia detected\nwith X-rays. Our analysis of the X-ray data favors an asymmetric medium, with a\nhigh-density component which supplies the X-ray emission. The data suggest a\nnumber density $> 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the higher-density medium, which is\nconsistent with the large observed Balmer decrement if it arises from\ncollisional excitation. This is high compared to most core-collapse SNe, but it\nmay be consistent with densities suggested for some Type IIn or superluminous\nSNe. If SN 2012ca is a thermonuclear SN, the large CSM density could imply\nclumps in the wind, or a dense torus or disk, consistent with the\nsingle-degenerate channel. A remote possibility for a core-degenerate channel\ninvolves a white dwarf merging with the degenerate core of an asymptotic giant\nbranch star shortly before the explosion, leading to a common envelope around\nthe SN.\n", "  We have studied strong-field enhanced dissociative ionization of D$_{2}$O in\n40 fs, 800 nm laser pulses with focused intensities of $< 1 - 3 \\times\n10^{15}W/cm^2$ by resolving the charged fragment momenta with respect to the\nlaser polarization. We observe dication dissociation into OD$^{+}$/D$^{+}$\ndominates when the polarization is out of the plane of the molecule, whereas\ntrication dissociation into O$^{+}$/D$^{+}$/D$^{+}$ is strongly dominant when\nthe polarization is aligned along the D-D axis. Dication dissociation into\nO/D$^{+}$/D$^{+}$, and O$^{+}$/D$_2$$^{+}$ is not seen, nor is there any\nsignificant fragmentation into multiple ions when the laser is polarized along\nthe C$_{2v}$ symmetry axis of the molecule. Even below the saturation intensity\nfor OD$^{+}$/D$^{+}$, the O$^{+}$/D$^{+}$/D$^{+}$ channel has higher yield. By\nanalyzing how the laser field is oriented within the molecular frame for both\nchannels, we show that enhanced ionization is driving the triply charged three\nbody breakup, but is not active for the doubly charged two body breakup. We\nconclude that laser-induced distortion of the molecular potential suppresses\nmultiple ionization along the C$_{2v}$ axis, but enhances ionization along the\nD-D direction.\n", "  Graphene is a fascinating 2D material that is being widely investigated for\nuse in electronic devices due to its unique electronic and materials\nproperties. Also, because of its high thermal stability and inertness, it is\nconsidered a promising candidate for use as a protection layer for metal\nsubstrates. Here, graphene films grown on Ru(0001) are held at 600 K while\nreacted with oxygen (O$_2$) and then investigated with helium low energy ion\nscattering (LEIS). LEIS spectra collected at different scattering angles\nconfirm that oxygen does not adsorb to graphene, but instead intercalates\nbetween the graphene and the substrate. The intercalated O$_2$ desorbs when the\nsample is annealed to 800 K. It is shown that this is a much lower temperature\nthan is needed to remove chemisorbed atomic oxygen from Ru, thus inferring that\nthe intercalated oxygen is molecular. During the desorption process, some of\nthe graphene is etched away via a chemical reaction with the oxygen, with the\nproportion desorbing as O$_2$ or reacting to etch the graphene being dependent\non the amount of intercalated O$_2$.\n", "  The main focus of this work is to test the ideas related to the oblique\nconfinement in a theoretically controllable manner using the \"deformed QCD\" as\na toy model. We explicitly show that the oblique confinement in the weakly\ncoupled gauge theories emerges as a result of condensation of $N$ types of\nmonopoles shifted by the phase $\\exp(i\\frac{\\theta+2\\pi m}{N})$ in Bloch type\nconstruction. It should be contrasted with conventional and commonly accepted\nviewpoint that the confinement at $\\theta\\neq 0$ is due to the condensation of\nthe electrically charged dyons which indeed normally emerge in the systems with\n$\\theta\\neq 0$ as a result of Witten's effect. We explain the basic reason why\nthe \"dyon\" mechanism does not materialize-- it is because the Witten's effect\nholds for a static magnetic monopole treated as an external source. It should\nbe contrasted with our case when $N$- types of monopoles are not static, but\nrather the dynamical degrees of freedom which fluctuate and themselves\ndetermine the ground state of the system.\n", "  Perturbative QCD in the small Bjorken $x$ limit can be formulated as an\neffective theory known as the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism. The CGC\nformalism takes into account the dynamics of large gluon densities at small $x$\nand has been successfully applied to Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and\nparticle production in high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions in the small\n$x$ kinematic region. The effective degrees of of freedom in CGC are Wilson\nlines which enter in the effective quark (and gluon) propagators and re-sum\nmultiple soft scatterings from the small $x$ gluon field of the target. It is\nhowever known that the CGC effective theory breaks down when one probes the\nmoderately large $x$ (high $p_t$) kinematics where collinear factorization and\nDGLAP evolution of parton distribution functions should be the right framework.\nHere we propose a general framework which may allow one to eventually unify the\ntwo approaches and to calculate pQCD cross sections in both small and large\nBjorken $x$ regions. We take the first step towards this goal by deriving an\nexpression for the quark propagator in a background field which includes\nscatterings from both small and large $x$ modes of the gluon field of the\ntarget. We describe how this quark propagator can be used to calculate QCD\nstructure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ at all $x$ and thus generalize the dipole\nmodel of DIS. We outline this approach can also be used to extend the so-called\nhybrid approach to particle production in the forward rapidity region of high\nenergy hadronic and nuclear collisions to all $x$ and $p_t$ regions and\nspeculate on how one may apply the same techniques to extend the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan effective action used in high energy heavy ion collisions\nto include high $p_t$ physics.\n", "  In the high-eccentricity migration (HEM) scenario, close-in planets reach the\nvicinity of the central star on high-eccentricity orbits that become\ncircularized---with a concomitant decrease in the semimajor axis---through a\ntidal interaction with the star. Giant planets that arrive with periastron\ndistances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\\mathrm{R}$ lose their\ngaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets'\ndistribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is\nnonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay.\nHere we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of\na spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization\ntime becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous\nstudies already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its\nproperties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by\ntidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}$). Our work extends these treatments by constructing\nexplicit model distributions for comparison with the data and by carrying out\nbackward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters. We show that\ncircularization generally occurs outside the distribution's inner edge (which\ndefines the boundary of the so-called sub-Jovian desert) and that typically\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}\\approx10^6$ in the circularization zone (to within a\nfactor of 3). We also find tentative evidence for an eccentricity gradient in\nlower-mass planets, indicating that formation through HEM may be relevant down\nto Neptune scales.\n", "  The $\\eta$ mesic nucleus is considered to be one of the interesting exotic\nmany body systems and has been studied since 1980's theoretically and\nexperimentally. Recently, the formation of the $\\eta$ mesic nucleus in the\nfusion reactions of the light nuclei such as $d + d \\rightarrow (\\eta + \\alpha)\n\\rightarrow X$ has been proposed and the experiments have been performed by\nWASA-at-COSY. We develop a theoretical model to evaluate the formation rate of\nthe $\\eta$ mesic nucleus in the fusion reactions and show the calculated\nresults. We find that the $\\eta$ bound states could be observed in the\nreactions in cases with the strong attractive and small absorptive\n$\\eta$-nucleus interactions. We compare our results with existing data of the\n$d + d \\rightarrow \\eta + \\alpha$ and the $d + d \\rightarrow {^3 \\rm He} + N +\n\\pi$ reactions. We find that the analyses by our theoretical model with the\nexisting data can provide new information on the $\\eta$-nucleus interaction.\n", "  We numerically compute the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a\nTaylor-Couette geometry where the rotation rates of the inner and outer\ncylinders satisfy $\\Omega_o/\\Omega_i=(r_o/r_i)^{-3/2}$. In this quasi-Keplerian\nregime a non-magnetic system would be Rayleigh-stable for all Reynolds numbers\n$Re$, and the resulting purely azimuthal flow incapable of kinematic dynamo\naction for all magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$. For $Re=10^4$ and $Rm=10^5$ we\ndemonstrate the existence of a finite-amplitude dynamo, whereby a suitable\ninitial condition yields mutually sustaining turbulence and magnetic fields,\neven though neither could exist without the other. This dynamo solution results\nin significantly increased outward angular momentum transport, with the bulk of\nthe transport being by Maxwell rather than Reynolds stresses.\n", "  Within the scope of Bianchi type-$II$ cosmological model we have studied the\nrole of spinor field in the evolution of the Universe. It is found that in this\ncase the components of energy-momentum tensor of spinor field along the\nprincipal axis are different, i.e. $T_1^1 \\ne T_2^2 \\ne T_3^3$, even in absence\nof spinor field nonlinearity. The presence of nontrivial non-diagonal\ncomponents of energy-momentum tensor of the spinor field imposes severe\nrestrictions both on geometry of space-time and on the spinor field itself.\nDepending on the choice of $f(x_3)$ the space-time might be either locally\nrotationally symmetric or isotropic. In this paper we considered the Bianchi\ntype-$II$ space-time both for a trivial and nontrivial $b$. It was found that\nwhile a positive $\\lambda_1$ in case of $f^\\prime \\ne 0$ gives rise to\noscillatory mode of evolution, in case of $f^\\prime = 0$ it leads to\naccelerated mode of expansion.\n", "  We present new high resolution and dynamic range dust column density and\ntemperature maps of the California Molecular Cloud derived from a combination\nof Planck and Herschel dust-emission maps, and 2MASS NIR dust-extinction maps.\nWe used these data to determine the ratio of the 2.2 micron extinction\ncoefficient to the 850 micron opacity and found the value to be close to that\nfound in similar studies of the Orion B and Perseus clouds but higher than that\ncharacterizing the Orion A cloud, indicating that variations in the fundamental\noptical properties of dust may exist between local clouds. We show that over a\nwide range of extinction, the column density probability distribution function\n(PDF$_N$) of the cloud can be well described by a simple power law with an\nindex that represents a steeper decline with column density than found in\nsimilar studies of the Orion and Perseus clouds. Using only the protostellar\npopulation of the cloud and our extinction maps we investigate the Schmidt\nrelation within the cloud. We show that the protostellar surface density,\n$\\Sigma_*$, is directly proportional to the ratio of the protostellar and cloud\npdfs. We use the cumulative distribution of protostars to infer the functional\nforms for both $\\Sigma_*$ and PDF$_*$. We find that $\\Sigma_*$ is best\ndescribed by two power-law functions with steeper indicies than found in other\nlocal GMCs. We find that the protostellar pdf is a declining function of\nextinction also best described by two power-laws whose behavior mirrors that of\n$\\Sigma_*$. Our observations suggest that variations both in the slope of the\nSchmidt relation and in the sizes of the protostellar populations between GMCs\nare largely driven by variations in the slope of the cloud pdf. This confirms\nearlier studies suggesting that cloud structure plays a major role in setting\nthe global star formation rates in GMCs.\n", "  We study Anderson localization in a generalized discrete time quantum walk -\na unitary map related to a Floquet driven quantum lattice. It is controlled by\na quantum coin matrix which depends on four angles with the meaning of\npotential and kinetic energy, and external and internal synthetic flux. Such\nquantum coins can be engineered with microwave pulses in qubit chains. The\nordered case yields a two-band eigenvalue structure on the unit circle which\nbecomes completely flat in the limit of vanishing kinetic energy. Disorder in\nthe external magnetic field does not impact localization. Disorder in all the\nremaining angles yields Anderson localization. In particular, kinetic energy\ndisorder leads to logarithmic divergence of the localization length at spectral\nsymmetry points. Strong disorder in potential and internal magnetic field\nenergies allows to obtain analytical expressions for spectrally independent\nlocalization length which is highly useful for various applications.\n", "  Spatially anisotropic solitary vortices (AVSs), supported by anisotropic\ndipole-dipole interactions, were recently predicted in spin-orbit-coupled\nbinary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in the form of two-dimensional\nsemi-vortices (complexes built of zero-vorticity and vortical components). We\ndemonstrate that the shape of the AVSs -- horizontal or vertical, with respect\nto the in-plane polarization of the atomic dipole moments in the underlying BEC\n-- may be effectively controlled by strength $\\Omega$ of the Zeeman splitting\n(ZS). A transition from the horizontal to vertical shape with the increase of\n$\\Omega$ is found numerically and explained analytically. At the transition\npoint, the AVS assumes the shape of an elliptical ring. Mobility of horizontal\nAVSs is studied too, with a conclusion that, with the increase of $\\Omega $,\ntheir negative effective mass changes the sign into positive via a point at\nwhich the effective mass diverges. Lastly, we report a new species of\n\\textit{inverted} AVSs, with the zero-vorticity and vortex component placed in\nlower- and higher-energy components, as defined by the ZS. They are excited\nstates, with respect to the ground states provided by the usual AVSs. Quite\nsurprisingly, inverted AVSs are stable in a large parameter region.\n", "  [Abridged] We use the WINGS database to select a sample of 67 nearby galaxy\nclusters with at least 30 spectroscopic members each. 53 of these clusters do\nnot show evidence of substructures in phase-space, while 14 do. We estimate the\nvirial radii and circular velocities of the 67 clusters by a variety of proxies\n(velocity dispersion, X-ray temperature, and richness) and use these estimates\nto build stack samples from these 53 and 14 clusters ('Reg' and 'Irr' stacks,\nrespectively). We determine the number-density and velocity-dispersion profiles\n(VDPs) of E, S0, and Sp+Irr (S) galaxies in the Reg and Irr samples,\nseparately, and fit models to these profiles. The number density profiles of E,\nS0, and S galaxies are adequately described by either a NFW or a cored King\nmodel, both for the Reg and Irr samples, with a slight preference for the NFW\nmodel. The spatial distribution concentration increases from the S to the S0\nand to the E populations, both in the Reg and the Irr stacks, reflecting the\nwell-known morphology-radius relation. Reg clusters have a more concentrated\nspatial distribution of E and S0 galaxies than Irr clusters, while the spatial\ndistributions of S galaxies in Reg and Irr clusters are similar. We propose a\nnew phenomenological model that provides acceptable fits to the VDP of all our\ngalaxy samples. The VDPs become steeper and with a higher normalization from E\nto S0 to S galaxies. The S0 VDP is close to that of E galaxies in Reg clusters,\nand intermediate between those of E and S galaxies in Irr clusters. Our results\nsuggest that S galaxies are a recently accreted cluster population, that take\nless than 3 Gyr to evolve into S0 galaxies after accretion, and in doing so\nmodify their phase-space distribution, approaching that of cluster ellipticals.\nWhile in Reg clusters this evolutionary process is mostly completed, it is\nstill ongoing in Irr clusters.\n", "  When the upper layer of an accreting neutron star experiences a thermonuclear\nrunaway of helium and hydrogen, it exhibits an X-ray burst of a few keV with a\ncool-down phase of typically 1~minute. When there is a surplus of hydrogen,\nhydrogen fusion is expected to simmer during that same minute due to the rp\nprocess, which consists of rapid proton captures and slow beta-decays of\nproton-rich isotopes. We have analyzed the high-quality light curves of 1254\nX-ray bursts, obtained with the Proportional Counter Array on the Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer between 1996 and 2012, to systematically study the cooling and\nrp process. This is a follow-up of a study on a selection of 37 bursts from\nsystems that lack hydrogen and show only cooling during the bursts. We find\nthat the bolometric light curves are well described by the combination of a\npower law and a one-sided Gaussian. The power-law decay index is between 1.3\nand 2.1 and similar to that for the 37-bursts sample. There are individual\nbursters with a narrower range. The Gaussian is detected in half of all bursts,\nwith a typical standard deviation of 50~s and a fluence ranging up to 60% of\nthe total fluence. The Gaussian appears consistent with being due to the rp\nprocess. The Gaussian fluence fraction suggests that the layer where the rp\nprocess is active is underabundant in H by a factor of at least five with\nrespect to cosmic abundances. Ninety-four percent of all bursts from\nultracompact X-ray binaries lack the Gaussian component, and the remaining 6%\nare marginal detections. This is consistent with a hydrogen deficiency in these\nbinaries. We find no clear correlation between the power law and Gaussian\nlight-curve components.\n", "  The primary goal of this paper is to make a direct comparison between the\nmeasured and model-predicted abundances of He, C and N in a sample of 35\nwell-observed Galactic planetary nebulae (PN). All observations, data\nreductions, and abundance determinations were performed in house to ensure\nmaximum homogeneity. Progenitor star masses (M < 4M_sun) were inferred using\ntwo published sets of post-AGB model tracks and L and T_eff values. We conclude\nthe following: 1) the mean values of N/O across the progenitor mass range\nexceeds the solar value, indicating significant N enrichment in the majority of\nour objects; 2) the onset of hot bottom burning appears to begin around 2 solar\nmasses, i.e., lower than ~5 M_sun implied by theory; 3) most of our objects\nshow a clear He enrichment, as expected from dredge-up episodes; 4) the average\nsample C/O value is 1.23, consistent with the effects of third dredge-up; and\n5) model grids used to compare to observations successfully span the\ndistribution over metallicity space of all C/O and many He/H data points but\nmostly fail to do so in the case of N/O. The evident enrichment of N in PN and\nthe general discrepancy between the observed and model-predicted N/O abundance\nratios signal the need for extra-mixing as an effect of rotation and/or\nthermohaline mixing in the models. The unexpectedly high N enrichment that is\nimplied here for low mass stars, if confirmed, will likely impact our\nconclusions about the source of N in the Universe.\n", "  We present measurements of the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) in AuW and AuTa alloys\nfor a large range of W or Ta concentrations by combining experiments on lateral\nspin valves and Ferromagnetic-Resonance/spin pumping technique. The main result\nis the identification of a large enhancement of the Spin Hall Angle (SHA) by\nthe side-jump mechanism on Ta impurities, with a SHA as high as + 0.5 (i.e\n$50\\%$) for about 10\\% of Ta. In contrast the SHA in AuW does not exceed + 0.15\nand can be explained by intrinsic SHE of the alloy without significant\nextrinsic contribution from skew or side-jump scattering by W impurities. The\nAuTa alloys, as they combine a very large SHA with a moderate resistivity\n(smaller than $85\\,\\mu\\Omega.cm$), are promising for spintronic devices\nexploiting the SHE.\n", "  A detailed perturbative construction of globally regular, asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) time-periodic solutions of Einstein's equations with a\nnegative cosmological constant (AdS geons) is presented. Starting with the most\ngeneral superposition of the $l=2$ even parity (scalar) eigenmodes of AdS at\nlinear order, it is shown that at the fifth order in perturbation theory one\nobtains five one-parameter geon families, two of which have a helical Killing\nvector, one with axial symmetry, and two others without continuous symmetries.\nThe details and some subtle aspects of the perturbative expansions are also\npresented.\n", "  We report and discuss JHKs photometry for Sgr dIG, a very metal-deficient\ngalaxy in the Local Group, obtained over 3.5 years with the Infrared Survey\nFacility in South Africa. Three large amplitude asymptotic giant branch\nvariables are identified. One is an oxygen-rich star that has a pulsation\nperiod of 950 days, that was until recently undergoing hot bottom burning, with\nMbol~-6.7. It is surprising to find a variable of this sort in Sgr dIG, given\ntheir rarity in other dwarf irregulars. Despite its long period the star is\nrelatively blue and is fainter, at all wavelengths shorter than 4.5microns,\nthan anticipated from period-luminosity relations that describe hot bottom\nburning stars. A comparison with models suggests it had a main sequence mass\nMi~5 times solar and that it is now near the end of its AGB evolution. The\nother two periodic variables are carbon stars with periods of 670 and 503 days\n(Mbol~-5.7 and -5.3). They are very similar to other such stars found on the\nAGB of metal deficient Local Group Galaxies and a comparison with models\nsuggests Mi~3 times solar. We compare the number of AGB variables in Sgr dIG to\nthose in NGC6822 and IC1613, and suggest that the differences may be due to the\nhigh specific star formation rate and low metallicity of Sgr dIG.\n", "  We advance a theory of quasistatic approximation and investigate the\nexcitation of nonlinear plasma waves by the driving beam of ultrarelativistic\nelectrons using novel electrostatic-like particle- in-cell code. Assuming that\nthe beam occupies an infinitesimally small volume, we find the radius and\nlength of the plasma bubble formed in the wake of the driver for varying values\nof the beam charge. The mechanism of the bubble formation is explained by\ndeveloping simple models of the bubble at large charges. Plasma electrons\nexpelled by the driver charge excite secondary plasma waves which complicate\nthe plasma electron flow near the bubble boundary.\n", "  We consider the vector emissivity of the polarized radiation transfer in a\n$\\Lambda$-type atomic transition, which we recently proposed in order to\naccount for both CRD and PRD contributions to the scattered radiation. This\nexpression can concisely be written as\n  $$\\varepsilon=\\left(\\varepsilon^{(1)}\n  -\\varepsilon^{(2)}_{\\rm f.s.} \\right)\n  +\\varepsilon^{(2)}\\;$$\n  where $\\varepsilon^{(1)}$ and $\\varepsilon^{(2)}$ are the emissivity terms\ndescribing, respectively, one-photon and two-photon processes in a\n$\\Lambda$-type atom, %the fully and partially redistributed radiations, and\nwhere \"f.s.\" means that the corresponding term must be evaluated assuming an\nappropriate \"flat spectrum\" average of the incident radiation across the\nspectral line. In this follow up study, we explicitly consider the expressions\nof these various terms for the case of a polarized multi-term atom, in order to\nderive the algebraic forms of the branching ratios between the CRD and PRD\ncontributions to the emissivity. In the limit of a two-term atom with\nnon-coherent lower-term, our results are shown to be in full agreement with\nthose recently derived by Bommier (2017)\n", "  The Mollow spectrum for the light scattered by a driven two-level atom is\nderived in the resolvent operator formalism. The derivation is based on the\nconstruction of a master equation from the resolvent operator of the atom-field\nsystem. We show that the natural linewidth of the excited atomic level remains\nessentially unmodified, to a very good level of approximation, even in the\nstrong-field regime, where Rabi flopping becomes relevant inside the\nself-energy loop that yields the linewidth. This ensures that the obtained\nmaster equation and the spectrum derived matches that of Mollow.\n", "  Brain plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, is a fundamental mechanism\nof neuronal adaptation in response to changes in the environment or due to\nbrain injury. In this review, we show our results about the effects of synaptic\nplasticity on neuronal networks composed by Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We show\nthat the final topology of the evolved network depends crucially on the ratio\nbetween the strengths of the inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Excitation of\nthe same order of inhibition revels an evolved network that presents the\nrich-club phenomenon, well known to exist in the brain. For initial networks\nwith considerably larger inhibitory strengths, we observe the emergence of a\ncomplex evolved topology, where neurons sparsely connected to other neurons,\nalso a typical topology of the brain. The presence of noise enhances the\nstrength of both types of synapses, but if the initial network has synapses of\nboth natures with similar strengths. Finally, we show how the synchronous\nbehaviour of the evolved network will reflect its evolved topology.\n", "  We estimate the current extinction-corrected H$\\alpha$ star formation rate\n(SFR) of the different morphological components that shape galaxies (bulges,\nbars, and disks). We use a multi-component photometric decomposition based on\nSDSS imaging to CALIFA Integral Field Spectroscopy datacubes for a sample of\n219 galaxies. This analysis reveals an enhancement of the central SFR and\nspecific SFR (sSFR $=$ SFR/$M_{\\star}$) in barred galaxies. Along the Main\nSequence, we find more massive galaxies in total have undergone efficient\nsuppression (quenching) of their star formation, in agreement with many\nstudies. We discover that more massive disks have had their star formation\nquenched as well. We evaluate which mechanisms might be responsible for this\nquenching process. The presence of type-2 AGNs plays a role at damping the sSFR\nin bulges and less efficiently in disks. Also, the decrease in the sSFR of the\ndisk component becomes more noticeable for stellar masses around 10$^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$; for bulges, it is already present at $\\sim$10$^{9.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThe analysis of the line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersions ($\\sigma$) for\nthe bulge component and of the corresponding Faber-Jackson relation shows that\nAGNs tend to have slightly higher $\\sigma$ values than star-forming galaxies\nfor the same mass. Finally, the impact of environment is evaluated by means of\nthe projected galaxy density, $\\Sigma$$_{5}$. We find that the SFR of both\nbulges and disks decreases in intermediate-to-high density environments. This\nwork reflects the potential of combining IFS data with 2D multi-component\ndecompositions to shed light on the processes that regulate the SFR.\n", "  We present modeling and analysis of the ejecta of nova V723 Cas based on\nspatially resolved IR spectroscopic data from Keck-OSIRIS, with LGSAO (adaptive\noptics module). The 3D photoionization models include the shell geometry taken\nfrom the observations and an anisotropic radiation field, composed by a\nspherical central source and an accretion disk. Our simulations indicate\nrevised abundances $log(N_{Al}/N_{H})=-5.4$, $log(N_{Ca}/N_{H})=-6.4$ and\n$log(N_{Si}/N_{H})=-4.7$ in the shell. The total ejected mass was found as\n$M_{shell}=1.1\\times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\\odot}$ and the central source temperature\nand luminosity are $T=280,000$ $K$ and $L=10^{38}$ $erg/s$. The 3D models are\ncompared to basic 1D simulations to demonstrate the importance of using more\nrealistic treatments, stressing the differences in the shell mass, abundances\nand characterization of the central source. The possibility of V723 Cas being a\nneon nova and the puzzling central source features found are discussed.\n", "  We report 192 previously unpublished optical linear polarization measurements\nof quasars obtained in April 2003, April 2007, and October 2007 with the\nEuropean Southern Observatory Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2)\ninstrument attached to the 3.6m telescope at the La Silla Observatory. Each\nquasar was observed once. Among the 192 quasars, 89 have a polarization degree\n$p \\geq 0.6\\%$, 18 have $p \\geq 2\\%$, and two have $p \\geq 10\\%$.\n", "  While structures and bifurcations controlling tracer particle transport and\nmixing have been studied extensively for systems with only\nstretching-and-folding, and to a lesser extent for systems with only\ncutting-and-shuffling, few studies have considered systems with a combination\nof both. We demonstrate two bifurcations for non-mixing islands associated with\nelliptic periodic points that only occur in systems with combined\ncutting-and-shuffling and stretching-and-folding, using as an example a map\napproximating biaxial rotation of a less-than-half-full spherical granular\ntumbler. First, we characterize a bifurcation of elliptic island containment,\nfrom containment by manifolds associated with hyperbolic periodic points to\ncontainment by cutting line tangency. As a result, the maximum size of the\nnon-mixing region occurs when the island is at the bifurcation point. We also\ndemonstrate a bifurcation where periodic points are annihilated by the\ncutting-and-shuffling action. Chains of elliptic and hyperbolic periodic points\nthat arise when invariant tori surrounding an elliptic point break up\n[according to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory] can annihilate when they\nmeet a cutting line. Consequently, the Poincar\\'{e} index (a topological\ninvariant of smooth systems) is not preserved.\n", "  The typical methodology for comparing simulated galaxies with observational\nsurveys is usually to apply a spatial selection to the simulation to mimic the\nregion of interest covered by a comparable observational survey sample. In this\nwork we compare this approach with a more sophisticated post-processing in\nwhich the observational uncertainties and selection effects (photometric,\nsurface gravity and effective temperature) are taken into account. We compare a\n`solar neighbourhood analogue' region in a model Milky Way-like galaxy\nsimulated with RAMSES-CH with fourth release Gaia-ESO survey data. We find that\na simple spatial cut alone is insufficient and that observational uncertainties\nmust be accounted for in the comparison. This is particularly true when the\nscale of uncertainty is large compared to the dynamic range of the data, e.g.\nin our comparison, the [Mg/Fe] distribution is affected much more than the more\naccurately determined [Fe/H] distribution. Despite clear differences in the\nunderlying distributions of elemental abundances between simulation and\nobservation, incorporating scatter to our simulation results to mimic\nobservational uncertainty produces reasonable agreement. The quite complete\nnature of the Gaia-ESO survey means that the selection function has minimal\nimpact on the distribution of observed age and metal abundances but this would\nbecome increasingly more important for surveys with narrower selection\nfunctions.\n", "  We describe new results on two supernova impostors in NGC 2403, SN 1954J(V12)\nand SN 2002kg(V37). For the famous object SN 1954J we combine four critical\nobservations: its current SED, its Halpha emission line profile, the Ca II\ntriplet in absorption in its red spectrum, and the brightness compared to its\npre-event state. Together these strongly suggest that the survivor is now a hot\nsupergiant with T ~ 20000 K, a dense wind, substantial circumstellar\nextinction, and a G-type supergiant companion. The hot star progenitor of V12's\ngiant eruption was likely in the post-red supergiant stage and had already shed\na lot of mass. V37 is a classical LBV/S Dor variable. Our photometry and\nspectra observed during and after its eruption show that its outburst was an\napparent transit on the HR Diagram due to enhanced mass loss and the formation\nof a cooler, dense wind. V37 is an evolved hot supergiant at ~10^6 Lsun with a\nprobable initial mass of 60 -80 Msun.\n", "  We present an X-ray study of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS\nF00183-7111 (z=0.327), using data obtained from NuSTAR, Chandra X-ray\nObservatory, Suzaku and XMM-Newton. The Chandra imaging shows that a point-like\nX-ray source is located at the nucleus of the galaxy at energies above 2 keV.\nHowever, the point source resolves into diffuse emission at lower energies,\nextending to the east, where the extranuclear [O III] emission, presumably\ninduced by a galactic-scale outflow, is present. The nuclear source is detected\nby NuSTAR up to the rest-frame 30 keV. The strong, high-ionization Fe K line,\nfirst seen by XMM-Newton, and subsequently by Suzaku and Chandra, is not\ndetected in the NuSTAR data. The line flux appears to have been declining\ncontinuously between 2003 and 2016, while the continuum emission remained\nstable to within 30%. The X-ray continuum below 10 keV is characterised by a\nhard spectrum caused by cold absorption of nH ~1e23 cm-2, compatible to that of\nthe silicate absorption at 9.7 micron, and a broad absorption feature around 8\nkeV which we attribute to a high-ionization Fe K absorption edge. The latter is\nbest described by a blueshifted, high-ionization (log xi ~3) absorber. No extra\nhard component, which would arise from a Compton-thick source, is seen in the\nNuSTAR data. While a pure reflection scenario (with a totally hidden central\nsource) is viable, direct emission from the central source of L(2-10 keV) =\n2e44 erg/s, behind layers of cold and hot absorbing gas may be an alternative\nexplanation. In this case, the relative X-ray quietness (Lx/L_AGN ~6e-3), the\nhigh-ionization Fe line, strong outflows inferred from various observations,\nand other similarities to the well-studied ULIRG/QSO Mrk 231 point that the\ncentral source in this ULIRG might be accreting close to the Eddington limit.\n", "  This work presents a study of galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback.\nWe extract main sequence disc galaxies with stellar mass $10^9\\le$\nM$_{\\star}/$M$_{\\odot} \\le 5.7\\times10^{10}$ at redshift $z=0$ from the highest\nresolution cosmological simulation of the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies\nand their Environments (EAGLE) set. Synthetic gas rotation velocity and\nvelocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) maps are created and compared to observations of\ndisc galaxies obtained with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field\nspectrograph (SAMI), where $\\sigma$-values greater than $150$ km s$^{-1}$ are\nmost naturally explained by bipolar outflows powered by starburst activity. We\nfind that the extension of the simulated edge-on (pixelated) velocity\ndispersion probability distribution depends on stellar mass and star formation\nrate surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$), with\nlow-M$_{\\star}/$low-$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ galaxies showing a narrow peak at low\n$\\sigma$ ($\\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$) and more active,\nhigh-M$_{\\star}/$high-$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ galaxies reaching $\\sigma>150$ km\ns$^{-1}$. Although supernova-driven galactic winds in the EAGLE simulations may\nnot entrain enough gas with T $<10^5$ K compared to observed galaxies, we find\nthat gas temperature is a good proxy for the presence of outflows. There is a\ndirect correlation between the thermal state of the gas and its state of motion\nas described by the $\\sigma$-distribution. The following equivalence relations\nhold in EAGLE: $i)$ low-$\\sigma$ peak $\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,$ disc of the galaxy\n$\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,$ gas with T $<10^5$ K; $ii)$ high-$\\sigma$ tail\n$\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,$ galactic winds $\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,$ gas with T $\\ge\n10^5$ K.\n", "  We study the Casimir potential between two impurities immersed in a\nspin-orbit coupled BoseEinstein condensate (BEC) with plane-wave order. We find\nthat, by exchanging the virtual phonons/excitations, a remarkable anisotropic\noscillating potential with both positive and negative parts can be induced\nbetween the impurities, with the period of the oscillation depending on the\nspin-orbit coupling strength. As a consequence, this would inevitably lead to a\nnon-central Casimir force, which can be tuned by varying the strength of\nspin-orbit coupling . These results are elucidated for BECs with\none-dimensional Raman-induced and two-dimensional Rashba-type SOC.\n", "  Emergent phenomena at polar-nonpolar oxide interfaces have been studied\nintensely in pursuit of next-generation oxide electronics and spintronics. Here\nwe report the disentanglement of critical thicknesses for electron\nreconstruction and the emergence of ferromagnetism in polar-mismatched\nLaMnO3/SrTiO3 (001) heterostructures. Using a combination of element-specific\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy and dichroism, and first-principles calculations,\ninterfacial electron accumulation and ferromagnetism have been observed within\nthe polar, antiferromagnetic insulator LaMnO3. Our results show that the\ncritical thickness for the onset of electron accumulation is as thin as 2 unit\ncells (UC), significantly thinner than the observed critical thickness for\nferromagnetism of 5 UC. The absence of ferromagnetism below 5 UC is likely\ninduced by electron over-accumulation. In turn, by controlling the doping of\nthe LaMnO3, we are able to neutralize the excessive electrons from the polar\nmismatch in ultrathin LaMnO3 films and thus enable ferromagnetism in films as\nthin as 3 UC, extending the limits of our ability to synthesize and tailor\nemergent phenomena at interfaces and demonstrating manipulation of the\nelectronic and magnetic structures of materials at the shortest length scales.\n", "  We introduce a single generative mechanism with which it is able to describe\ndiverse non-stationary diffusions. A non-stationary Markovian replication\nprocess for steps is considered, for which we analytically derive\ntime-evolution of the probability distribution of the walker's displacement and\nthe generalized telegrapher equation with time-varying coefficients, and find\nthat diffusivity can be determined by temporal changes of replication of a\nimmediate step. By controlling the replications, we realize the diverse\ndiffusions such as alternating diffusions, superdiffusions, subdiffusions, and\nmarginal diffusions which are originated from oscillating,\nincreasing,decreasing, and slowly increasing or decreasing replications with\ntime, respectively.\n", "  In this paper it is shown that the mathematical form which most precisely\ndescribes the Blazhko RR Lyrae light curves is connected to almost periodic\nfunctions and not to the mathematics of modulation. That is, the Blazhko effect\nis more than a simple external modulation of the pulsation signal. The\nmathematical framework of almost periodic functions predicts a new observable\neffect: a shift of the Fourier harmonics of the main pulsation frequency from\nthe exact harmonic position. This phenomenon is called as harmonic detuning\neffect (HDE).The published deviations of the harmonics of V445 Lyr are\nexplained with this effect. HDE is also found for V2178 Cyg, another Blazhko\nstar observed by the Kepler space telescope. HDE is detectable only if the\nphase variation part of the Blazhko effect is of large amplitude and\nnon-periodic enough, additionally, the time span of the observed light curve is\nsufficiently long for obtaining precise frequencies. These three conditions\nrestrict the number of stars showing detectable HDE and explain why this effect\nhas not been discovered up to now.\n", "  Tundra lakes are key components of the Arctic climate system because they\nrepresent a source of methane to the atmosphere. In this paper, we aim to\nanalyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large ($>0.8$ km$^2$) tundra\nlakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in\nhistorical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale\n$0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google\nEarth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). The G.E.E. is a\ncloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis on over four\ndecades of Landsat data. We developed an image-processing algorithm to segment\nthese maps and images, measure the area and perimeter of each lake, and compute\nthe fractal dimension of the lakes in the images we have studied. Our results\nindicate that as lake size increases, their fractal dimension bifurcates. For\nlakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger\nthan $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in\nsatellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\\sim$100\nkm$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal\ndimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their\narea--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes\nwith a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed.\nPreliminary analysis of changes in lake size over time in paired lakes (lakes\nthat were visually matched in both the historical map and the satellite\nimagery) indicate that some lakes in our study region have increased in size\nover time, whereas others have decreased in size over time. Lake size change\nduring this 39-year time interval can be up to half the size of the lake as\nrecorded in the historical map.\n", "  Type-C QPOs in X-ray binaries have been often interpreted as a consequence of\nrelativistic Lense-Thirring precession around a spinning black hole and they\npotentially offer a way to measure black hole spins and masses. The connection\nbetween relativistic precession and the resulting QPO has been made either in\nterms of a simplified model involving a single test particle producing the QPO,\nor in terms of a global model where a geometrically thick accretion flow\nprecesses coherently as a rigid body. In this paper, we analyse similarities\nand differences between these two models, sometimes considered as in opposition\nto each other. We demonstrate that the former is the limiting case of the\nlatter when the radial extent of the precessing flow is very small, and that\nsolid lower limits to the black hole spin can be obtained by considering the\ntest particle model alone. We also show that the global precession model\nnaturally accounts for the range of frequencies observed for Type-C QPOs\nwithout the need to invoke a truncation of the inner accretion flow before it\nreaches the innermost stable circular orbit. Finally, we show that, in order to\nmaintain rigid precession, the thick accretion flow should be radially narrow,\nand that if it extends beyond $10-10^2$ gravitational radii it aligns with the\nblack hole spin too fast to produce a coherent QPO.\n", "  Parallaxes, proper motions, and optical photometry are presented for 51\nsystems made up 37 cool subdwarf and 14 additional high proper motion systems.\nThirty-seven systems have parallaxes reported for the first time, 15 of which\nhave proper motions of at least 1\"/yr. The sample includes 22 newly identified\ncool subdwarfs within 100 pc, of which three are within 25 pc, and an\nadditional five subdwarfs from 100-160 pc. Two systems --- LSR 1610-0040 AB and\nLHS 440 AB --- are close binaries exhibiting clear astrometric perturbations\nthat will ultimately provide important masses for cool subdwarfs.\n  We use the accurate parallaxes and proper motions provided here, combined\nwith additional data from our program and others to determine that effectively\nall nearby stars with tangential velocities greater than 200 km s$^{-1}$ are\nsubdwarfs. We compare a sample of 167 confirmed cool subdwarfs to nearby main\nsequence dwarfs and Pleiades members on an observational Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram using $M_V$ vs.~$(V-K_{s})$ to map trends of age and metallicity. We\nfind that subdwarfs are clearly separated for spectral types K5--M5, indicating\nthat the low metallicities of subdwarfs set them apart in the H-R diagram for\n$(V-K_{s})$ = 3--6. We then apply the tangential velocity cutoff and the\nsubdwarf region of the H-R diagram to stars with parallaxes from {\\it Gaia}\nData Release 1 and the MEarth Project to identify a total of 29 new nearby\nsubdwarf candidates that fall clearly below the main sequence.\n", "  We study the sub-Keplerian rotation and dust content of the circumstellar\nmaterial around the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star L$_2$ Puppis. We find\nthat the thermal pressure gradient alone cannot explain the observed rotation\nprofile. We find that there is a family of possible dust populations for which\nradiation pressure can drive the observed sub-Keplerian rotation. This set of\nsolutions is further constrained by the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe system, and we find that a dust-to-gas mass ratio of $\\sim10^{-3}$ and a\nmaximum grain size that decreases radially outwards can satisfy both the\nrotation curve and SED. These dust populations are dynamically tightly coupled\nto the gas azimuthally. However grains larger than $\\sim0.5\\mu$m are driven\noutward radially by radiation pressure at velocities $\\sim5$kms$^{-1}$, which\nimplies a dust replenishment rate of $\\sim3\\times10^{-9}$M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$.\nThis replenishment rate is consistent with observational estimates to within\nuncertainties. Coupling between the radial motion of the dust and gas is weak\nand hence the gas does not share in this rapid outward motion. Overall we\nconclude that radiation pressure is a capable and necessary mechanism to\nexplain the observed rotation profile of L$_2$ Pup, and offers other additional\nconstraints on the dust properties.\n", "  The nonextensive kinetic theory for degenerate quantum gases is discussed in\nthe general relativistic framework. By incorporating nonadditive modifications\nin the collisional term of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and entropy\ncurrent, it is shown that Tsallis entropic framework satisfies a H-theorem in\nthe presence of gravitational fields. Consistency with the 2nd law of\nthermodynamics is obtained only whether the entropic q-parameter lies in the\ninterval $q \\in [0,2]$. As occurs in the absence of gravitational fields, it is\nalso proved that the local collisional equilibrium is described by the extended\nBose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) q-distributions.\n", "  We systematically investigate the phenomena of coherence resonance in\ntime-delay coupled networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo elements in the excitable\nregime. Using numerical simulations, we examine the interplay of noise,\ntime-delayed coupling and network topology in the generation of coherence\nresonance. In the deterministic case, we show that the delay-induced dynamics\nis independent of the number of nearest neighbors and the system size. In the\npresence of noise, we demonstrate the possibility of controlling coherence\nresonance by varying the time-delay and the number of nearest neighbors. For a\nlocally coupled ring, we show that the time-delay weakens coherence resonance.\nFor nonlocal coupling with appropriate time-delays, both enhancement and\nweakening of coherence resonance are possible.\n", "  List of contributions from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Consortium presented\nat the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference, July 12-20 2017, Busan, Korea.\n", "  In contrast to internal symmetries, there is no general proof that the coset\nconstruction for spontaneously broken spacetime symmetries leads to universal\ndynamics. One key difference lies in the role of Goldstone bosons, which for\nspacetime symmetries includes a subset which are inessential for the non-linear\nrealisation and hence can be eliminated. In this paper we address two important\nissues that arise when eliminating inessential Goldstones.\n  The first concerns the elimination itself, which is often performed by\nimposing so-called inverse Higgs constraints. Contrary to claims in the\nliterature, there are a series of conditions on the structure constants which\nmust be satisfied to employ the inverse Higgs phenomenon, and we discuss which\nparametrisation of the coset element is the most effective in this regard. We\nalso consider generalisations of the standard inverse Higgs constraints, which\ncan include integrating out inessential Goldstones at low energies, and prove\nthat under certain assumptions these give rise to identical effective field\ntheories for the essential Goldstones.\n  Secondly, we consider mappings between non-linear realisations that differ\nboth in the coset element and the algebra basis. While these can always be\nrelated to each other by a point transformation, remarkably, the inverse Higgs\nconstraints are not necessarily mapped onto each other under this\ntransformation. We discuss the physical implications of this non-mapping, with\na particular emphasis on the coset space corresponding to the spontaneous\nbreaking of the Anti-De Sitter isometries by a Minkowski probe brane.\n", "  Coupled semiconductor lasers are systems possessing complex dynamics that are\ninteresting for numerous applications in photonics. In this work, we\ninvestigate the existence and the stability of asymmetric phase-locked states\nof the fundamental active photonic dimer consisting of two coupled lasers. We\nshow that stable phase-locked states of arbitrary asymmetry exist for extended\nregions of the parameter space of the system and that their field amplitude\nratio and phase difference can be dynamically controlled by appropriate current\ninjection. The model includes the important role of carrier density dynamics\nand shows that the phase-locked state asymmetry is related to operation\nconditions providing, respectively, gain and loss in the two lasers.\n", "  We study the CO line luminosity ($L_{\\rm CO}$), the shape of the CO Spectral\nLine Energy Distribution (SLED), and the value of the CO-to-$\\rm H_2$\nconversion factor in galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To this aim,\nwe construct a model that simultaneously takes into account the radiative\ntransfer and the clumpy structure of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) where the CO\nlines are excited. We then use it to post-process state-of-the-art zoomed, high\nresolution ($30\\, \\rm{pc}$), cosmological simulation of a main-sequence\n($M_{*}\\approx10^{10}\\, \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, $SFR\\approx 100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}\\,\nyr^{-1}}$) galaxy, \"Alth{\\ae}a\", at $z\\approx6$. We find that the CO emission\ntraces the inner molecular disk ($r\\approx 0.5 \\,\\rm{kpc}$) of Alth{\\ae}a with\nthe peak of the CO surface brightness co-located with that of the [CII] 158$\\rm\n\\mu m$ emission. Its $L_{\\rm CO(1-0)}=10^{4.85}\\, \\rm{L_{\\odot}}$ is comparable\nto that observed in local galaxies with similar stellar mass. The high\n($\\Sigma_{gas} \\approx 220\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}\\, pc^{-2}$) gas surface density in\nAlth{\\ae}a, its large Mach number (\\mach$\\approx 30$), and the warm kinetic\ntemperature ($T_{k}\\approx 45 \\, \\rm K$) of GMCs yield a CO SLED peaked at the\nCO(7-6) transition, i.e. at relatively high-$J$, and a CO-to-$\\rm H_2$\nconversion factor $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}\\approx 1.5 \\, \\rm M_{\\odot} \\rm (K\\, km\\,\ns^{-1}\\, pc^2)^{-1} $ lower than that of the Milky Way. The ALMA observing time\nrequired to detect (resolve) at 5$\\sigma$ the CO(7-6) line from galaxies\nsimilar to Alth{\\ae}a is $\\approx13$ h ($\\approx 38$ h).\n", "  In $SU(N)$ gauge theory, it is argued recently that there exists a \"mixed\nanomaly\" between the CP symmetry and the 1-form $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry at\n$\\theta=\\pi$, and the anomaly matching requires CP to be spontaneously broken\nat $\\theta=\\pi$ if the system is in the confining phase. In this paper, we\nelaborate on this discussion by examining the large volume behavior of the\npartition functions of the $SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory on $T^4$ a la 't Hooft.\nThe periodicity of the partition function in $\\theta$, which is not $2\\pi$ due\nto fractional instanton numbers, suggests the presence of a phase transition at\n$\\theta=\\pi$. We propose lattice simulations to study the distribution of the\ninstanton number in $SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_N$ theories. A characteristic shape of\nthe distribution is predicted when the system is in the confining phase. The\nmeasurements of the distribution may be useful in understanding the phase\nstructure of the theory.\n", "  We investigate ultrafast demagnetization due to electron-phonon interaction\nin a model band-ferromagnet. We show that the microscopic mechanism behind the\nspin dynamics due to electron-phonon interaction is the interplay of scattering\nand the precession around momentum-dependent effective internal spin-orbit\nmagnetic fields. The resulting magnetization dynamics can only be mimicked by\nspin-flip transitions if the spin precession around the internal fields is\nsufficiently fast (compared to the scattering time) so that it averages out the\ntransverse spin components.\n", "  The microscopic approach of fission rates and neutron emission rates in\ncompound nuclei have been applied to $^{258}$No and $^{286}$Cn. The microscopic\nframework is based on the finite-temperature Skyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS\ncalculations, in which the fission barriers and mass parameters are\nself-consistently temperature dependent. The fission rates from low to high\ntemperatures can be obtained based on the imaginary free energy method. The\nneutron emission rates are obtained with neutron gases at surfaces. Finally the\nsurvival probabilities of superheavy nuclei can be calculated microscopically.\nThe microscopic approach has been compared with the widely used statistical\nmodels. Generally, there are still large uncertainties in descriptions of\nfission rates.\n", "  A quasiparticle band structure of a single layer 2H-NbSe$_2$ is reported by\nusing first-principles $GW$ calculation. We show that a self-energy correction\nincreases the width of a partially occupied band and alters its Fermi surface\nshape when comparing those using conventional mean-field calculation methods.\nOwing to a broken inversion symmetry in the trigonal prismatic single layer\nstructure, the spin-orbit interaction is included and its impact on the Fermi\nsurface and quasiparticle energy bands are discussed. We also calculate the\ndoping dependent static susceptibilities from the band structures obtained by\nthe mean-field calculation as well as $GW$ calculation with and without\nspin-orbit interactions. A complete tight-binding model is constructed within\nthe three-band third nearest neighbour hoppings and is shown to reproduce our\n$GW$ quasiparticle energy bands and Fermi surface very well. Considering\nvariations of the Fermi surface shapes depending on self-energy corrections and\nspin-orbit interactions, we discuss the formations of charge density wave (CDW)\nwith different dielectric environments and their implications on recent\ncontroversial experimental results on CDW transition temperatures.\n", "  The 95Zr(n,gamma)96Zr reaction cross section is crucial in the modelling of\ns-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch stars because it controls\nthe operation of the branching point at the unstable 95Zr and the subsequent\nproduction of 96Zr. We have carried out the measurement of the 94Zr(18O,16O)\nand 90Zr(18O,16O) reactions and obtained the gamma-decay probability ratio of\n96Zr* and 92Zr* to determine the 95Zr(n,gamma)96Zr reaction cross sections with\nthe surrogate ratio method. Our deduced maxwellian-averaged cross section of\n66+-16 mb at 30 keV is close to the value recommended by Bao et al. (2000), but\n30% and more than a factor of two larger than the values proposed by Toukan &\nKappeler (1990) and Lugaro et al. (2014), respectively, and routinely used in\ns-process models. We tested the new rate in stellar models with masses between\n2 and 6 Msun and metallicities 0.014 and 0.03. The largest changes - up 80%\nvariations in 96Zr - are seen in models of mass 3-4 Msun, where the 22Ne\nneutron source is mildly activated. The new rate can still provide a match to\ndata from meteoritic stardust silicon carbide grains, provided the maximum mass\nof the parent stars is below 4 Msun, for a metallicity of 0.03.\n", "  We investigated theoretically water evaporation from concentrated\nsupramolecular mixtures, such as solutions of polymers or amphiphilic\nmolecules, using numerical resolutions of a one dimensional model based on mass\ntransport equations. Solvent evaporation leads to the formation of a\nconcentrated solute layer at the drying interface, which slows down evaporation\nin a long-time scale regime. In this regime, often referred to as the falling\nrate period, evaporation is dominated by diffusive mass transport within the\nsolution, as already known. However, we demonstrate that, in this regime, the\nrate of evaporation does not also depend on the ambient humidity for many\nmolecular complex fluids. Using analytical solutions in some limiting cases, we\nfirst demonstrate that a sharp decrease of the water chemical activity at high\nsolute concentration, leads to evaporation rates which depend weakly on the\nhumidity, as the solute concentration at the drying interface slightly depends\non the humidity. However, we also show that a strong decrease of the mutual\ndiffusion coefficient of the solution enhances considerably this effect,\nleading to nearly independent evaporation rates over a wide range of humidity.\nThe decrease of the mutual diffusion coefficient indeed induces strong\nconcentration gradients at the drying interface, which shield the concentration\nprofiles from humidity variations, except in a very thin region close to the\ndrying interface.\n", "  Diffusion in cell membranes is not just simple two-dimensional Brownian\nmotion, but typically depends on the timescale of the observation. The physical\norigins of this anomalous sub-diffusion are unresolved, and model systems\ncapable of quantitative and reproducible control of membrane diffusion have\nbeen recognised as a key experimental bottleneck. Here we control anomalous\ndif- fusion using supported lipids bilayers containing lipids derivatized with\npolyethylene glycol (PEG) headgroups. Bilayers with specific excluded area\nfractions are formed by control of PEG-lipid mole fraction. These bilayers\nexhibit a switch in diffusive behaviour, becoming anomalous as bilayer\ncontinuity is disrupted. Diffusion in these bilayers is well-described by a\npower-law dependence of the mean-square displacement with observation time. The\nparameters describing this diffusion can be tailored by simply controlling the\nmole fraction of PEG-lipid, producing bilayers that exhibit diffusive behaviour\nwith similar characteristics to those observed in biological membranes.\n", "  Mini-Neptunes seem to be common planets. In this work we investigate the\npossible formation histories and predicted occurrence rates of mini-Neptunes\nassuming the planets form beyond the iceline. We consider pebble and\nplanetesimal accretion accounting for envelope enrichment and two different\nopacity conditions. We find that the formation of mini-Neptunes is a relatively\nfrequent output when envelope enrichment by volatiles is included, and that\nthere is a \"sweet spot\" for mini-Neptune formation with a relatively low solid\naccretion rate of ~10^{-6} Earth masses per year. This rate is typical for\nlow/intermediate-mass protoplanetary disks and/or disks with low metallicities.\nWith pebble accretion, envelope enrichment and high opacity favor the formation\nof mini-Neptunes, with more efficient formation at large semi-major axes (~30\nAU) and low disk viscosity. For planetesimal accretion, such planets can form\nalso without enrichment, with the opacity being a key aspect in the growth\nhistory and favorable formation location. Finally, we show that the formation\nof Neptune-like planets remains a challenge for planet formation theories.\n", "  We propose an efficient scheme for a coherent quantum interface between\nmicrowave and optical photons using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.\nIn this setup, an NV center ensemble is simultaneously coupled to an optical\nand a microwave cavity. We show that, by using the collective spin excitation\nmodes as an intermediary, quantum states can be transferred between the\nmicrowave cavity and the optical cavity through either a double-swap scheme or\na dark-state protocol. This hybrid quantum interface may provide interesting\napplications in single microwave photon detections or quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  The recent LIGO observation of gravitational waves from a binary black hole\nmerger triggered several follow-up searches from both electromagnetic wave as\nwell as neutrino observatories. Since in general, it is expected that all\nmatter has been removed from the binary black hole environment long before the\nmerger, no neutrino emission is expected from such mergers. Still, it remains\ninteresting to test this hypothesis. The ratio of the energy emitted in\nneutrinos with respect to gravitational waves represents a useful parameter to\nconstrain the environment of such astrophysical events. In addition to putting\nconstraints by use of the non-detection of counterpart neutrinos, it is also\npossible to consider the diffuse neutrino flux measured by the IceCube\nobservatory as the maximum contribution from an extrapolated full class of\nBBHs. Both methods currently lead to similar bounds on the fraction of energy\nthat can be emitted in neutrinos. Nevertheless, combining both methods should\nallow to strongly constrain the source population in case of a future neutrino\ncounterpart detection. The proposed approach can and will be applied to\npotential upcoming LIGO events, including binary neutron stars and black\nhole-neutron star mergers, for which a neutrino counterpart is expected.\n", "  Ion implantation of Mn combined with pulsed laser melting is employed to\nobtain two representative compounds of dilute ferromagnetic semiconductors\n(DFSs): Ga1-xMnxAs and In1-xMnxAs. In contrast to films deposited by the widely\nused molecular beam epitaxy, neither Mn interstitials nor As antisites are\npresent in samples prepared by the method employed here. Under these conditions\nthe influence of localization on the hole-mediated ferromagnetism is examined\nin two DFSs with a differing strength of p-d coupling. On the insulating side\nof the transition, ferromagnetic signatures persist to higher temperatures in\nIn1-xMnxAs compared to Ga1-xMnxAs with the same Mn concentration x. This\nsubstantiates theoretical suggestions that stronger p-d coupling results in an\nenhanced contribution to localization, which reduces hole-mediated\nferromagnetism. Furthermore, the findings support strongly the heterogeneous\nmodel of electronic states at the localization boundary and point to the\ncrucial role of weakly localized holes in mediating efficient spin-spin\ninteractions even on the insulator side of the metal-insulator transition.\n", "  We present Adaptive Optics-aided speckle observations of 47 young stars in\nthe $\\epsilon$ Cha association, made at the 4-m Southern Astrophysical Research\nTelescope in the $I$-band. We resolved 10 new binary pairs, 5 previously known\nbinaries and two triple systems, also previously known. In the separation range\nbetween 4 and 300 AU, the 30 association members of spectral types G0 and later\nhost 6 binary companions, leading to the raw companion frequency of\n$0.010\\pm0.04$ per decade of separation, comparable to the main sequence dwarfs\nin the field. On the other hand, all 5 massive association members of spectral\ntypes A and B have companions in this range. We discuss the newly resolved and\nknown binaries in our sample. Observed motions in the triple system $\\epsilon$\nCha, composed of three similar B9V stars, can be described by tentative orbits\nwith periods 13 and $\\sim 900$ years, and a large mutual inclination.\n", "  The candidate black hole X-ray binary Swift J1753.5-0127 faded to quiescence\nin 2016 November, after a prolonged outburst that was discovered in 2005.\nNearly three months later the system displayed renewed activity that lasted\nthrough 2017 July. Here, we present radio and X-ray monitoring over ~3 months\nof the renewed activity to study the coupling between the jet and the inner\nregions of the disk/jet system. Our observations cover low X-ray luminosities\nthat have not historically been well-sampled (Lx~2e33 - 1e36 erg/s; 1-10 keV),\nincluding time periods when the system was both brightening and fading. At\nthese low luminosities Swift J1753.5-0127 occupies a parameter space in the\nradio/X-ray luminosity plane that is comparable to \"canonical\" systems (e.g.,\nGX 339-4), regardless of whether the system was brightening or fading, even\nthough during its >11-year outburst Swift J1753.5-0127 emitted less radio\nemission from its jet than expected. We discuss implications for the existence\nof a single radio/X-ray luminosity correlation for black hole X-ray binaries at\nthe lowest luminosities (Lx < 1e35 erg/s), and we compare to supermassive black\nholes. Our campaign includes the lowest luminosity quasi-simultaneous\nradio/X-ray detection to date for a black hole X-ray binary during its rise out\nof quiescence, thanks to early notification from optical monitoring combined\nwith fast responses from sensitive multiwavelength facilities.\n", "  With N-body simulations of a planetary system with an asteroid belt we\ninvestigate how the asteroid impact rate on the Earth is affected by the\narchitecture of the planetary system. We find that the $\\nu_6$ secular\nresonance plays an important role in the asteroid collision rate with the\nEarth. Compared to exoplanetary systems, the solar system is somewhat special\nin its lack of a super-Earth mass planet in the inner solar system. We\ntherefore first consider the effects of the presence of a super-Earth in the\nterrestrial planet region. We find a significant effect for super-Earths with a\nmass of around $10\\,\\rm M_\\oplus$ and a separation greater than about $0.7\\,\\rm\nAU$. For a super-Earth that is interior to the Earth's orbit, the number of\nasteroids colliding with Earth increases the closer the super-Earth is to the\nEarth's orbit. This is the result of multiple secular resonance locations\ncausing more asteroids to be perturbed onto Earth-crossing orbits. When the\nsuper-Earth is placed exterior to Earth's orbit, the collision rate decreases\nsubstantially because the $\\nu_6$ resonance no longer exists in the asteroid\nbelt region. We also find that changing the semi-major axis of Saturn leads to\na significant decrease in the asteroid collision rate, while increasing its\nmass increases the collision rate. These results may have implications for the\nhabitability of exoplanetary systems.\n", "  We analyzed images of comet 49P/Arend-Rigaux on 33 nights between 2012\nJanuary and May and obtained R-band lightcurves of the nucleus. Through usual\nphasing of the data we found a double-peaked lightcurve having a synodic\nrotation period of 13.450 +/- 0.005 hr. Similarly, phase dispersion\nminimization and the Lomb-Scargle method both revealed rotation periods of\n13.452 hr. Throughout the 2011/12 apparition, the rotation period was found to\nincrease by a small amount, consistent with a retrograde rotation of the\nnucleus. We also reanalyzed the publicly available data from the 1984/85\napparition by applying the same techniques, finding a rotation period of 13.45\n+/- 0.01 hr. Based on these findings we show that the change in rotation period\nis less than 14 seconds per apparition. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the\nlight curves from the two apparitions are comparable, to within reasonable\nerrors, even though the viewing geometries differ, implying that we are seeing\nthe comet at a similar sub-Earth latitude. We detected the presence of a short\nterm jet-like feature in 2012 March which appears to have been created by a\nshort duration burst of activity on March 15. Production rates obtained in\n2004/05, along with reanalysis of previous results from 1984/85 imply a strong\nseasonal effect and a very steep fall-off after perihelion. This, in turn,\nimplies that a single source region dominates activity, rather than leakage\nfrom the entire nucleus.\n", "  We utilize the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large\nTelescope (VLT) to search for extended Lyman-Alpha emission around the z~6.6\nQSO J0305-3150. After carefully subtracting the point-spread-function, we reach\na nominal 5-sigma surface brightness limit of SB = 1.9x10$^{-18}$\nerg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$ over a 1 arcsec$^2$ aperture, collapsing 5 wavelength\nslices centered at the expected location of the redshifted Lyman-Alpha emission\n(i.e. at 9256 Ang.). Current data suggest the presence (5-sigma, accounting for\nsystematics) of a Lyman-Alpha nebula that extends for 9 kpc around the QSO.\nThis emission is displaced and redshifted by 155 km/s with respect to the\nlocation of the QSO host galaxy traced by the [CII] emission line. The total\nluminosity is L = 3.0x10$^{42}$ erg/s. Our analysis suggests that this emission\nis unlikely to rise from optically thick clouds illuminated by the ionizing\nradiation of the QSO. It is more plausible that the Lyman-Alpha emission is due\nto fluorescence of the highly ionized optically thin gas. This scenario implies\na high hydrogen volume density of n$_H$ ~ 6 cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we detect a\nLyman-Alpha emitter (LAE) in the immediate vicinity of the QSO: i.e., with a\nprojected separation of 12.5 kpc and a line-of-sight velocity difference of 560\nkm/s. The luminosity of the LAE is L = 2.1x10$^{42}$ erg/s and its inferred\nstar-formation-rate is SFR ~ 1.3 M$_\\odot$/yr. The probability of finding such\na close LAE is one order of magnitude above the expectations based on the\nQSO-galaxy cross-correlation function. This discovery is in agreement with a\nscenario where dissipative interactions favour the rapid build-up of\nsuper-massive black holes at early Cosmic times.\n", "  GRB 110721A was detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite and the Gamma-ray Burst Polarimeter\nonboard the IKAROS solar mission. Previous analysis done of this burst showed:\ni) a linear polarization signal with position angle stable ($\\phi_p=\n160^\\circ\\pm11$) and high degree of $\\Pi=84^{+16}_{-28}$, ii) an extreme peak\nenergy of a record-breaking at 15$\\pm$2 MeV, and iii) a subdominant prompt\nthermal component observed right after the onset of this burst. In this paper,\nthe LAT data around the reported position of GRB 110721A are analysed with the\nmost recent software and then, the LAT light curve above 100 MeV was obtained.\nThe LAT light curve is modelled in terms of adiabatic early-afterglow external\nshocks when the outflow propagates into a stellar wind. Additionally, we\ndiscuss the possible origins and also study the implications of the\nearly-afterglow external shocks on the extreme peak energy observed at 15$\\pm$2\nMeV, the polarization observations and the subdominant prompt thermal\ncomponent.\n", "  In this work we apply relativistic mean-field theory in neutron stars\nassuming that fermionic dark matter is trapped inside the star and interacts\ndirectly with neutrons by exchanging Standard Model Higgs bosons. For realistic\nvalues of the parameters of the model we compute numerically the equation of\nstate, and we compare it to the standard one. Furthermore, the mass-to-radius\nrelation for both equations of state (pure neutron matter as well as admixed\nDM-neutron star) is shown, and the highest star mass for both cases is\nreported.\n", "  The main ideas of the NLO calculations in Parton Reggeization Approach are\nillustrated on the example of the simplest NLO subprocess, which contributes to\nDIS: $\\gamma^\\star+R\\to q + \\bar{q}$. The double counting with the LO\ncontribution $\\gamma^\\star + Q \\to q$ is resolved. The problem of matching of\nthe NLO results for single-scale observables in the Parton Reggeization\nApproach on the corresponding NLO results in the Collinear Parton Model is\nconsidered. In the developed framework, the usual NLO PDFs in the\n$\\overline{MS}$-scheme can be consistently used as the collinear input for the\nNLO calculation in the Parton Reggeization Approach.\n", "  We investigate the stationary and dynamic properties of the celebrated\nNos\\'e-Hoover dynamics of many-body interacting Hamiltonian systems, with an\nemphasis on the effect of inter-particle interactions. To this end, we consider\na model system with both short- and long-range interactions. The Nos\\'e-Hoover\ndynamics aims to generate the canonical equilibrium distribution of a system at\na desired temperature by employing a set of time-reversible, deterministic\nequations of motion. A signature of canonical equilibrium is a single-particle\nmomentum distribution that is Gaussian. We find that the equilibrium properties\nof the system within the Nos\\'e-Hoover dynamics coincides with that within the\ncanonical ensemble. Moreover, starting from out-of-equilibrium initial\nconditions, the average kinetic energy of the system relaxes to its target\nvalue over a {\\it size-independent} timescale. However, quite surprisingly, our\nresults indicate that under the same conditions and with only long-range\ninteractions present in the system, the momentum distribution relaxes to its\nGaussian form in equilibrium over a scale that {\\it diverges with the system\nsize}. On adding short-range interactions, the relaxation is found to occur\nover a timescale that has a much weaker dependence on system size. This\nsystem-size dependence of the timescale vanishes when only short-range\ninteractions are present in the system. An implication of such an ultra-slow\nrelaxation when only long-range interactions are present in the system is that\nmacroscopic observables other than the average kinetic energy when estimated in\nthe Nos\\'e-Hoover dynamics may take an unusually long time to relax to its\ncanonical equilibrium value. Our work underlines the crucial role that\ninteractions play in deciding the equivalence between Nos\\'e-Hoover and\ncanonical equilibrium.\n", "  The Galactic object MWC 137 was suggested to belong to the group of B[e]\nsupergiants. However, with its large-scale optical bipolar ring nebula and the\nhigh velocity jet and knots, it is a rather atypical representative of this\nclass. We performed multi-wavelength observations spreading from the optical to\nthe radio regime. Based on optical imaging and long-slit spectroscopic data we\nfound that the northern parts of the large-scale nebula are predominantly\nblue-shifted, while the southern regions appear mostly red-shifted. We\ndeveloped a geometrical model consisting of two double-cones. While various\nobservational features can be approximated with such a scenario, the observed\nvelocity pattern is more complex. Using near-infrared integral-field unit\nspectroscopy we studied the hot molecular gas in the close vicinity of the\nstar. The emission from the hot CO gas arises in a small-scale disk revolving\naround the star on Keplerian orbits. While the disk itself cannot be spatially\nresolved, its emission is reflected by dust arranged in arc-like structures and\nclumps surrounding MWC 137 on small scales. In the radio regime we mapped the\ncold molecular gas in the outskirts of the optical nebula. We found that large\namounts of cool molecular gas and warm dust embrace the optical nebula in the\neast, south and west. No cold gas or dust were detected in the north and\nnorth-western regions. Despite the new insights on the nebula kinematics gained\nfrom our studies, the real formation scenario of the large-scale nebula remains\nan open issue.\n", "  We present orbital elements and mass sums for eighteen visual binary stars of\nspectral types B to K (five of which are new orbits) with periods ranging from\n20 to more than 500 yr. For two double-line spectroscopic binaries with no\nprevious orbits, the individual component masses, using combined astrometric\nand radial velocity data, have a formal uncertainty of ~0.1 MSun. Adopting\npublished photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes, plus our own measurements,\nwe place these objects on an H-R diagram, and discuss their evolutionary\nstatus. These objects are part of a survey to characterize the binary\npopulation of stars in the Southern Hemisphere, using the SOAR 4m\ntelescope+HRCAM at CTIO. Orbital elements are computed using a newly developed\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that delivers maximum likelihood estimates\nof the parameters, as well as posterior probability density functions that\nallow us to evaluate the uncertainty of our derived parameters in a robust way.\nFor spectroscopic binaries, using our approach, it is possible to derive a\nself-consistent parallax for the system from the combined astrometric plus\nradial velocity data (\"orbital parallax\"), which compares well with the\ntrigonometric parallaxes. We also present a mathematical formalism that allows\na dimensionality reduction of the feature space from seven to three search\nparameters (or from ten to seven dimensions - including parallax - in the case\nof spectroscopic binaries with astrometric data), which makes it possible to\nexplore a smaller number of parameters in each case, improving the\ncomputational efficiency of our Markov Chain Monte Carlo code.\n", "  There are two covariant descriptions of massless spin-2 particles in $D=3+1$\nvia a symmetric rank-2 tensor: the linearized Einstein-Hilbert (LEH) theory and\nthe Weyl plus transverse diffeomorphism (WTDIFF) invariant model. From the LEH\ntheory one can obtain the linearized New Massive Gravity (NMG) in $D=2+1$ via\nKaluza-Klein dimensional reduction followed by a dual master action. Here we\nshow that a similar route takes us from the\n  WTDIFF model to a linearized scalar tensor NMG which belongs to a larger\nclass of consistent spin-0 modifications of NMG. We also show that a traceless\nmaster action applied to a parity singlet furnishes two new spin-2 selfdual\nmodels.\n  Moreover, we examine the singular replacement $h_{\\mu\\nu} \\to h_{\\mu\\nu} -\n\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}h/D$ and prove that it leads to consistent massive spin-2 models\nin $D=2+1$. They include linearized versions of unimodular topologically\nmassive gravity (TMG) and unimodular NMG. Although the free part of those\nunimodular theories are Weyl invariant, we do not expect any improvement in the\nrenormalizability. Both the linearized K-term (in NMG) and the linearized\ngravitational Chern-Simons term (in TMG) are invariant under longitudinal\nreparametrizations $\\delta h_{\\mu\\nu} = \\p_{\\mu}\\p_{\\nu}\\zeta$ which is not a\nsymmetry of the WTDIFF Einstein-Hilbert term. Therefore, we still have one\ndegree of freedom whose propagator behaves like $1/p^2$ for large momentum.\n", "  In this letter, we study Langevin diffusion coefficients for the five\ndimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ STU model in presence of higher derivative\ncorrections. We obtained effect of black hole charge, corresponding to the\nchemical potential, on the Langevin diffusion coefficients ratio. We confirm\nuniversal behavior of transverse to longitudinal ratio of coefficients.\n", "  A brief review of double beta decay to the excited states of daughter nuclei\nis given. Results of the most sensitive experiments are presented.\n", "  Before an exoplanet transit, atmospheric refraction bends light into the line\nof sight of an observer. The refracted light forms a stellar mirage, a\ndistorted secondary image of the host star. I model this phenomenon and the\nresultant out-of-transit flux increase across a comprehensive exoplanetary\nparameter space. At visible wavelengths, Rayleigh scattering limits the\ndetectability of stellar mirages in most exoplanetary systems with semi-major\naxes $\\lesssim$6 AU. A notable exception is almost any planet orbiting a late M\nor ultra-cool dwarf star at $\\gtrsim$0.5 AU, where the maximum relative flux\nincrease is greater than 50 parts-per-million. Based partly on previous work, I\npropose that the importance of refraction in an exoplanet system is governed by\ntwo angles: the orbital distance divided by the stellar radius and the total\ndeflection achieved by a ray in the optically thin portion of the atmosphere.\nAtmospheric lensing events caused by non-transiting exoplanets, which allow for\nexoplanet detection and atmospheric characterization, are also investigated. I\nderive the basic formalism to determine the total signal-to-noise ratio of an\natmospheric lensing event, with application to Kepler data. It is unlikely that\nout-of-transit refracted light signals are clearly present in Kepler data due\nto Rayleigh scattering and the bias toward short-period exoplanets. However,\nobservations at long wavelengths (e.g., the near-infrared) are significantly\nmore likely to detect stellar mirages. Lastly, I discuss the potential for the\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to detect refracted light and consider\nnovel science cases enabled by refracted light spectra from the James Webb\nSpace Telescope.\n", "  Fomalhaut A is among the most well-studied nearby stars and has been\ndiscovered to possess a putative planetary object as well as a remarkable\neccentric dust belt. This eccentric dust belt has often been interpreted as the\ndynamical signature of one or more planets that elude direct detection.\nHowever, the system also contains two other stellar companions residing\n~100,000 AU from Fomalhaut A. We have designed a new symplectic integration\nalgorithm to model the evolution of Fomalhaut A's planetary dust belt in\nconcert with the dynamical evolution of its stellar companions to determine if\nthese companions are likely to have generated the dust belt's morphology. Using\nour numerical simulations, we find that close encounters between Fomalhaut A\nand B are expected, with a ~25% probability that the two stars have passed\nwithin at least 400 AU of each other at some point. Although the outcomes of\nsuch encounter histories are extremely varied, these close encounters nearly\nalways excite the eccentricity of Fomalhaut A's dust belt and occasionally\nyield morphologies very similar to the observed belt. With these results, we\nargue that close encounters with Fomalhaut A's stellar companions should be\nconsidered a plausible mechanism to explain its eccentric belt, especially in\nthe absence of detected planets capable of sculpting the belt's morphology.\nMore broadly, we can also conclude from this work that very wide binary stars\nmay often generate asymmetries in the stellar debris disks they host.\n", "  Iglesias et al. (2002) showed that the Rayleigh scattering from helium atoms\ndecreases by collective effects in the atmospheres of cool white dwarf stars.\nTheir study is here extended to consider an accurate evaluation of the atomic\npolarizability and the density effects involved in the Rayleigh cross section\nover a wide density-temperature region. The dynamic dipole polarizability of\nhelium atoms in the ground state is determinated with the oscillator-strength\ndistribution approach. The spectral density of oscillator strength considered\nincludes most significant single and doubly excited transitions to discrete and\ncontinuum energies. Static and dynamic polarizability results are confronted\nwith experiments and other theoretical evaluations shown a very good agreement.\nIn addition, the refractive index of helium is evaluated with the\nLorentz-Lorenz equation and shows a satisfactory agreement with the most recent\nexperiments. The effect of spatial correlation of atoms on the Rayleigh\nscattering is calculated with Monte Carlo simulations and effective energy\npotentials that represent the particle interactions, covering fluid densities\nbetween 0.005 and a few g/cm$^3$ and temperatures between $1000$ K and $15000$\nK. We provide analytical fits from which the Rayleigh cross section of fluid\nhelium can be easily calculated at wavelength $\\lambda>505.35$ \\AA.\nCollision-induced light scattering was estimated to be the dominant scattering\nprocess at densities greater than 1-2 g/cm$^3$ depending on the temperature.\n", "  We report the high-field induced magnetic phase in single crystal of\nU(Ru0.92Rh0.08)2Si2. Our neutron study combined with high-field magnetization,\nshows that the magnetic phase above the first metamagnetic transition at Hc1 =\n21.6 T has an uncompensated commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with\npropagation vector Q2 = ( 2/3 0 0) possessing two single-Q domains. U moments\nof 1.45 (9) muB directed along the c axis are arranged in an up-up-down\nsequence propagating along the a axis, in agreement with bulk measurements. The\nU magnetic form factor at high fields is consistent with both the U3+ and U4+\ntype. The low field short-range order that emerges from the pure URu2Si2 due to\nRh-doping is initially strengthened by the field but disappears in the\nfield-induced phase. The tetragonal symmetry is preserved across the transition\nbut the a axis lattice parameter increases already at low fields. Our results\nare in agreement with itinerant electron model with 5f states forming bands\npinned in the vicinity of the Fermi surface that is significantly reconstructed\nby the applied magnetic field.\n", "  We report on observational evidence of an extra-tidal clumpy structure around\nNGC 288 from an homogeneous coverage of a large area with the Pan-STARRS PS1\ndatabase. The extra-tidal star population has been disentangled from that of\nthe Milky Way field by using a cleaning technique that successfully reproduced\nthe stellar density, luminosity function and colour distributions of MW field\nstars. We have produced the cluster stellar density radial profile and a\nstellar density map from independent approaches, from which we found results in\nexcellent agreement : the feature extends up to 3.5 times the cluster tidal\nradius. Previous works based on shallower photometric data sets have speculated\non the existence of several long tidal tails, similar to that found in Pal 5.\nThe present outcome shows that NGC 288 could hardly have such tails, but\nfavours the notion that interactions with the MW tidal field has been a\nrelatively inefficient process for stripping stars off the cluster. These\nresults point to the need of a renewed overall study of the external regions of\nGalactic globular clusters (GGCs) in order to reliably characterise them.\nHence, it will be possible to investigate whether there is any connection\nbetween detected tidal tails, extra-tidal stellar populations, extent diffuse\nhalo-like structures with the GGCs' dynamical histories in the Galaxy.\n", "  Surfaces of homoepitaxially grown TiO2-terminated SrTiO3(001) were studied in\nsitu with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. By controlling the\nTi/Sr ratio, two-dimensional domains of highly ordered linear nanostructures,\nso-called \"nanolines\", are found to form on the surface. To further study how\nthe surface structure affects the band structure, spectroscopic studies of\nthese surfaces were performed. Our results reveal significantly more band\nbending for surfaces with the nanolines, indicative of an acceptor state\nassociated with these features. Additionally, an in-gap state is observed on\nnanoline surfaces grown under high oxygen deficient conditions. This state\nappears to be the same as that observed previously, arising from the (++/+)\ntransition level of surface oxygen vacancies.\n", "  The search for new materials, based on computational screening, relies on\nmethods that accurately predict, in an automatic manner, total energy,\natomic-scale geometries, and other fundamental characteristics of materials.\nMany technologically important material properties directly stem from the\nelectronic structure of a material, but the usual workhorse for total energies,\nnamely density-functional theory, is plagued by fundamental shortcomings and\nerrors from approximate exchange-correlation functionals in its prediction of\nthe electronic structure. At variance, the $GW$ method is currently the\nstate-of-the-art {\\em ab initio} approach for accurate electronic structure. It\nis mostly used to perturbatively correct density-functional theory results, but\nis however computationally demanding and also requires expert knowledge to give\naccurate results. Accordingly, it is not presently used in high-throughput\nscreening: fully automatized algorithms for setting up the calculations and\ndetermining convergence are lacking. In this work we develop such a method and,\nas a first application, use it to validate the accuracy of $G_0W_0$ using the\nPBE starting point, and the Godby-Needs plasmon pole model\n($G_0W_0^\\textrm{GN}$@PBE), on a set of about 80 solids. The results of the\nautomatic convergence study utilized provides valuable insights. Indeed, we\nfind correlations between computational parameters that can be used to further\nimprove the automatization of $GW$ calculations. Moreover, we find that\n$G_0W_0^\\textrm{GN}$@PBE shows a correlation between the PBE and the\n$G_0W_0^\\textrm{GN}$@PBE gaps that is much stronger than that between $GW$ and\nexperimental gaps. However, the $G_0W_0^\\textrm{GN}$@PBE gaps still describe\nthe experimental gaps more accurately than a linear model based on the PBE\ngaps.\n", "  In this work, the magnetism of the single crystal Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$, which\nexhibits chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL) state, is investigated. The\nmagnetization displays strong magnetic anisotropy when the field is applied\nperpendicularly and parallel to the $c$-axis in low field region ($H<H_{S}$,\n$H_{S}$ is the saturation field). The critical exponents of Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$\nare obtained as $\\beta=$ 0.370(4), $\\gamma=$ 1.380(2), and $\\delta=$ 4.853(6),\nwhich are close to the theoretical prediction of three-dimensional Heisenberg\nmodel. Based on the scaling equation and the critical exponents, the $H-T$\nphase diagram in the vicinity of the phase transition is constructed, where two\ncritical points are determined. One is a tricritical point which locates at the\nintersection between the CSL, forced ferromagnetic (FFM), and paramagnetic (PM)\nstates. The other one is a critical point situated at the boundaries between\nCSL, helimagnetic (HM), and PM states.\n", "  Fiber bursts are a type of fine structure that is often superposed on type IV\nradio continuum emission during solar flares. Although studied for many\ndecades, its physical exciter, emission mechanism, and association with the\nflare energy release remain unclear, partly due to the lack of simultaneous\nimaging observations. We report the first dynamic spectroscopic imaging\nobservations of decimetric fiber bursts, which occurred during the rise phase\nof a long-duration eruptive flare on 2012 March 3, as obtained by the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array in 1--2 GHz. Our results show that the fiber sources\nare located near and above one footpoint of the flare loops. The fiber source\nand the background continuum source are found to be cospatial and share the\nsame morphology. It is likely that they are associated with nonthermal\nelectrons trapped in the converging magnetic fields near the footpoint, as\nsupported by a persistent coronal hard X-ray source present during the flare\nrise phase. We analyze three groups of fiber bursts in detail with dynamic\nimaging spectroscopy and obtain their mean frequency-dependent centroid\ntrajectories in projection. By using a barometric density model and magnetic\nfield based on a potential-field extrapolation, we further reconstruct the 3-D\nsource trajectories of fiber bursts, for comparison with expectations from the\nwhistler wave model and two MHD-based models. We conclude that the observed\nfiber burst properties are consistent with an exciter moving at the propagation\nvelocity expected for whistler waves, or models that posit similar exciter\nvelocities.\n", "  Criteria defining higher-order sub-Poissonian-like fields are given using\nfive different quantities: moments of (I) integrated intensity, (II) photon\nnumber, (III) integrated-intensity fluctuation, (IV) photon-number fluctuation,\nand (V) elements of photocount and photon-number distributions. Relations among\nthe moment criteria are revealed. Performance of the criteria is experimentally\ninvestigated using a set of potentially sub-Poissonian fields obtained by\npost-selection from a twin beam. The criteria based on moments of integrated\nintensity and photon number and those using the elements of photocount\ndistribution are found as the most powerful. States nonclassical up to the\nfifth order are experimentally reached in the former case, even the ninth-order\nnon-classicality is observed in the latter case.\n", "  A general algorithm for computing the quadrupole-hyperfine effects in the\nrovibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules is presented for the case of\nammonia (NH$_3$). The method extends the general variational approach TROVE by\nadding the extra term in the Hamiltonian that describes the nuclear quadrupole\ncoupling, with no inherent limitation on the number of quadrupolar nuclei in a\nmolecule. We applied the new approach to compute the\nnitrogen-nuclear-quadrupole hyperfine structure in the rovibrational spectrum\nof NH$_3$. These results agree very well with recent experimental spectroscopic\ndata for the pure rotational transitions in the ground vibrational and $\\nu_2$\nstates, and the rovibrational transitions in the $\\nu_1$, $\\nu_3$, $2\\nu_4$,\nand $\\nu_1+\\nu_3$ bands. The computed hyperfine-resolved rovibrational spectrum\nof ammonia will be beneficial for the assignment of experimental rovibrational\nspectra, further detection of ammonia in interstellar space, and studies of the\nproton-to-electron mass variation.\n", "  In symmetric gravitating systems experiencing rapid mass loss, particle\norbits change almost instantaneously, which can lead to the development of a\nsharply contoured density profile, including singular caustics for\ncollisionless systems. This framework can be used to model a variety of\ndynamical systems, such as accretion disks following a massive black hole\nmerger and dwarf galaxies following violent early star formation feedback.\nParticle interactions in the high-density peaks seem a promising source of\nobservable signatures of these mass loss events (i.e. a possible EM counterpart\nfor black hole mergers or strong gamma-ray emission from dark matter\nannihilation around young galaxies), because the interaction rate depends on\nthe square of the density. We study post-mass-loss density profiles, both\nanalytic and numerical, in idealised cases and present arguments and methods to\nextend to any general system. An analytic derivation is presented for particles\non Keplerian orbits responding to a drop in the central mass. We argue that\nthis case, with initially circular orbits, gives the most sharply contoured\nprofile possible. We find that despite the presence of a set of singular\ncaustics, the total particle interaction rate is reduced compared to the\nunperturbed system; this is a result of the overall expansion of the system\ndominating over the steep caustics. Finally we argue that this result holds\nmore generally, and the loss of central mass decreases the particle interaction\nrate in any physical system.\n", "  We discuss how one calculates the coherent path integrals for locally\ninteracting systems, where some inconsistencies with exact results have been\nreported previously. It is shown that the operator ordering subtlety that is\nhidden in the local interaction term modifies the Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation in the continuous time formulation, and it helps reproduce known\nresults by the operator method. We also demonstrate that many-body effects in\nthe strong interaction limit can be well characterized by the free-particle\ntheory that is subject to annealed random potentials and dynamical gauge (or\nphase) fields. The present treatment expands the conventional paradigm of the\none-particle description, and it provides a simple, viable picture for strongly\ncorrelated materials of either bosonic or fermionic systems.\n", "  We experimentally and numerically investigate the effect of wind forcing on\nthe spectral dynamics of Akhmediev breathers, a wave-type known to model the\nmodulation instability. We develop the wind model to the same order in\nsteepness as the higher order modifcation of the nonlinear Schroedinger\nequation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an\nasymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind\nforcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory\nexperiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading\norder forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only\na broadening of the spectrum while the asymmetric higher order term in the\nmodel enhances higher frequencies more than lower ones. Thus, the latter term\ninduces a permanent upshift of the spectral mean. On the other hand, in\ncontrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to\nfrequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such as wave breaking, or\nthrough amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe\nequation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up- and downshift in terms of\npeak- and mean frequencies, that are critical to relate our work to previous\nresults, are highlighted and discussed.\n", "  We did a model independent phenomenological study of baryogenesis via\nleptogenesis, neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) and charged lepton flavour\nviolation (CLFV) in a generic left-right symmetric model (LRSM) where neutrino\nmass originates from the type I + type II seesaw mechanism. We studied the new\nphysics contributions to NDBD coming from the left-right gauge boson mixing and\nthe heavy neutrino contribution within the framework of LRSM. We have\nconsidered the mass of the RH gauge boson to be specifically 5 TeV, 10 TeV and\n18 TeV and studied the effects of the new physics contributions on the\neffective mass and baryogenesis and compared with the current experimental\nlimit. We tried to correlate the cosmological BAU from resonant leptogenesis\nwith the low energy observables, notably, NDBD and LFV with a view to finding a\ncommon parameter space where they coexists.\n", "  We find exact solutions describing bidirectional pulses propagating in fiber\nBragg gratings. They are derived by solving the coupled-mode theory equations\nand are expressed in terms of products of modified Bessel functions with\nalgebraic functions. Depending on the values of the two free parameters the\ngeneral bidirectional X-wave solution can also take the form of a\nunidirectional pulse. We analyze the symmetries and the asymptotic properties\nof the solutions and also discuss about additional waveforms that are obtained\nby interference of more than one solutions. Depending on their parameters such\npulses can create a sharp focus with high contrast.\n", "  Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes for\nquantum simulations of materials using state-of-the art electronic-structure\ntechniques, based on density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation\ntheory, and many-body perturbation theory, within the plane-wave\npseudo-potential and projector-augmented-wave approaches. Quantum ESPRESSO owes\nits popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to\nsimulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware\narchitectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities\nas a core open-source development platform to implement theirs ideas. In this\npaper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new\nmethodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code\nmodularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and\nwith external software.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional (2D) Dirac quantum ring systems formed by the\ninfinite mass constraint. When an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux is present, e.g.,\nthrough the center of the ring domain, persistent currents, i.e., permanent\ncurrents without dissipation, can arise. In real materials, impurities and\ndefects are inevitable, raising the issue of robustness of the persistent\ncurrents. Using localized random potential to simulate the disorders, we\ninvestigate how the ensemble averaged current magnitude varies with the\ndisorder density. For comparison, we study the nonrelativistic quantum\ncounterpart by analyzing the solutions of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation under\nthe same geometrical and disorder settings. We find that, for the Dirac ring\nsystem, as the disorder density is systematically increased, the average\ncurrent decreases slowly initially and then plateaus at a finite nonzero value,\nindicating remarkable robustness of the persistent currents. The physical\nmechanism responsible for the robustness is the emergence of a class of\nboundary states - whispering gallery modes. In contrast, in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nring system, such boundary states cannot form and the currents diminish rapidly\nto zero with increase in the disorder density. We develop a physical theory\nbased on a quasi one-dimensional approximation to understand the striking\ncontrast in the behaviors of the persistent currents in the Dirac and\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger rings. Our 2D Dirac ring systems with disorders can be\nexperimentally realized, e.g., on the surface of a topological insulator with\nnatural or deliberately added impurities from the fabrication process.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory will probe the non-thermal\nuniverse above 20 GeV up to several hundreds of TeV with a significant\nimprovement in sensitivity and angular resolution compared to current\nexperiments. Its outstanding capabilities will allow to increase the number of\nextragalactic cosmic accelerators detected at very high energy (VHE) and\ntherefore to better constrain the population of VHE accelerators and the\ngamma-ray absorption processes in the intergalactic medium. For the first time\nin the history of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), CTA will be\nan open observatory and high-level data will be made available to the\nastronomical community. Gammapy is an open-source Python package developed by\nthe Cherenkov telescope community that provides tools to simulate the gamma-ray\nsky and analyse IACT data. The versatile architecture of, and steady user\ncontributions to Gammapy enable a large variety of high-level data analyses.\nExamples of Gaammapy applications are presented, particularly in the context of\nextragalactic science with CTA.\n", "  Unintentional but unavoidable fabrication imperfections in state-of-the-art\nphotonic-crystal waveguides lead to the spontaneous formation of\nAnderson-localized modes thereby limiting slowlight propagation and its\npotential applications. On the other hand, disorder-induced cavities offer an\napproach to cavity-quantum electrodynamics and random lasing at the nanoscale.\nThe key statistical parameter governing the disorder effects is the\nlocalization length, which together with the waveguide length determines the\nstatistical transport of light through the waveguide. In a disordered\nphotonic-crystal waveguide, the localization length is highly dispersive, and\ntherefore, by controlling the underlying lattice parameters, it is possible to\ntune the localization of the mode. In the present work, we study the\nlocalization length in a disordered photonic-crystal waveguide using numerical\nsimulations. We demonstrate two different localization regimes in the\ndispersion diagram where the localization length is linked to the density of\nstates and the photon effective mass, respectively. The two different\nlocalization regimes are identified in experiments by recording the\nphotoluminescence from quantum dots embedded in photonic-crystal waveguides.\n", "  Nuclear spins and precise values of the magnetic dipole and electric\nquadrupole moments of the ground-states of neutron-rich $^{76-78}$Cu isotopes\nwere measured using the Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (CRIS)\nexperiment at ISOLDE, CERN. The nuclear moments of the less exotic $^{73,75}$Cu\nisotopes were re-measured with similar precision, yielding values that are\nconsistent with earlier measurements. The moments of the odd-odd isotopes, and\n$^{78}_{29}$Cu ($N=49$) in particular, are used to investigate excitations of\nthe assumed doubly-magic $^{78}$Ni core through comparisons with large-scale\nshell-model calculations. Despite the narrowing of the $Z=28$ shell gap between\n$N\\sim45$ and $N=50$, the magicity of $Z=28$ and $N=50$ is restored towards\n$^{78}$Ni. This is due to weakened dynamical correlations, as clearly probed by\nthe present moment measurements.\n", "  The interaction of dense plasmas with an intense laser under a strong\nexternal magnetic field has been investigated. When the cyclotron frequency for\nthe ambient magnetic field is higher than the laser frequency, the laser's\nelectromagnetic field is converted to the whistler mode that propagates along\nthe field line. Because of the nature of the whistler wave, the laser light\npenetrates into dense plasmas with no cutoff density, and produces superthermal\nelectrons through cyclotron resonance. It is found that the cyclotron resonance\nabsorption occurs effectively under the broadened conditions, or a wider range\nof the external field, which is caused by the presence of relativistic\nelectrons accelerated by the laser field. The upper limit of the ambient field\nfor the resonance increases in proportion to the square root of the\nrelativistic laser intensity. The propagation of a large-amplitude whistler\nwave could raise the possibility for plasma heating and particle acceleration\ndeep inside dense plasmas.\n", "  La0.9Ba0.1MnO3 is a ferromagnetic insulator in its bulk form, but exhibits\nmetallicity in thin film form. It has a wide potential in a range of\nspintronic-related applications, and hence it is critical to understand\nthickness-dependent electronic structure in thin films as well as\nsubstrate/film interface effects. Here, using electrical and in-situ\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements, we report the electronic structure and\ninterface band profile of high-quality layer-by-layer-grown La0.9Ba0.1MnO3 on\nsingle crystal Nb:SrTiO3 substrates. A transition from insulating-to-conducting\nwas observed with increasing La0.9Ba0.1MnO3 thickness, which was explained by\nthe determined interface band diagram of La0.9Ba0.1MnO3/Nb: SrTiO3, where a\ntype II heterojunction was formed.\n", "  We present precise values of the dipole polarizabilities ($\\alpha$) of the\nground $\\rm [4f^{14}6s] ~ ^2S_{1/2}$ and metastable $\\rm [4f^{14} 5d] ~\n^2D_{3/2}$ states of Yb$^+$, that are %vital {\\bf important} in reducing\nsystematics in the clock frequency of the $\\rm[4f^{14}6s] ~ ^2S_{1/2}\n\\rightarrow [4f^{14}5d] ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ transition. The static values of $\\alpha$\nfor the ground and $\\rm [4f^{14} 5d] ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ states are estimated to be\n$9.8(1) \\times 10^{-40} \\,\\,\\rm Jm^2V^{-2}$ and $17.6(5) \\times 10^{-40}\\,\\,\n\\rm Jm^2V^{-2}$, respectively, while the tensor contribution to the $\\rm\n[4f^{14} 5d] ~ ^2D_{3/2}$ state as $- 12.3(3) \\times 10^{-40}\\,\\, \\rm\nJm^2V^{-2}$ compared to the experimental value $-13.6(2.2) \\times\n10^{-40}\\,\\,\\rm Jm^2V^{-2}$. This corresponds to the differential scalar\npolarizability value of the above transition as $-7.8$(5)$\\,\\times\\,\n10^{-40}\\,\\rm Jm^2 V^{-2}$ in contrast to the available experimental value\n$-6.9$(1.4)$\\,\\times\\, 10^{-40}$\\,\\, $\\rm Jm^2V^{-2}$. This results in the\nblack-body radiation (BBR) shift of the clock transition as $-0.44(3)$ Hz at\nthe room temperature, which is large as compared to the previously estimated\nvalues. Using the dynamic $\\alpha$ values, we report the tune-out and magic\nwavelengths that could be of interest to subdue %major systematics due to the\nStark shifts and for constructing lattice optical clock using Yb$^+$.\n", "  We report numerical investigations of wave turbulence in a vibrating plate.\nThe possibility to implement advanced measurement techniques and long time\nnumerical simulations makes this system extremely valuable for wave turbulence\nstudies. The purely 2D character of dynamics of the elastic plate makes it much\nsimpler to handle compared to much more complex 3D physical systems that are\ntypical of geo- and astrophysical issues (ocean surface or internal waves,\nmagnetized plasmas or strongly rotating and/or stratified flows). When the\nforcing is small the observed wave turbulence is consistent with the\npredictions of the Weak Turbulent Theory. Here we focus on the case of stronger\nforcing for which coherent structures can be observed. These structures look\nsimilar to the folds and D-cones that are commonly observed for strongly\ndeformed static thin elastic sheets (crumpled paper) except that they evolve\ndynamically in our forced system. We describe their evolution and show that\ntheir emergence is associated with statistical intermittency (lack of self\nsimilarity) of strongly nonlinear wave turbulence. This behavior is reminiscent\nof intermittency in Navier-Stokes turbulence. Experimental data show hints of\nthe weak to strong turbulence transition. However, due to technical limitations\nand dissipation, the strong nonlinear regime remains out of reach of\nexperiments and therefore has been explored numerically.\n", "  We report the first detections of associated H{\\sc i} 21\\,cm absorption in\nGigahertz-peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources at high redshifts, $z > 1$, using the\nGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Our GMRT search for associated H{\\sc i}\n21\\,cm absorption in a sample of 12 GPS sources yielded two new detections of\nabsorption, towards TXS~1200+045 at $z = 1.226$ and TXS~1245$-$197 at $z =\n1.275$, and five non-detections. These are only the sixth and seventh\ndetections of associated H{\\sc i} 21\\,cm absorption in active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) at $z > 1$. Both H{\\sc i} 21\\,cm absorption profiles are wide, with\nvelocity spans between nulls of $\\approx 600$~km~s$^{-1}$ (TXS~1200+045) and\n$\\approx 1100$~km~s$^{-1}$ (TXS~1245$-$197). In both absorbers, the large\nvelocity spread of the absorption and its blueshift from the AGN, suggests that\nit arises in outflowing neutral gas, perhaps driven by the radio jets to high\nvelocities. We derive mass outflow rates of ${\\dot M} \\approx 32 \\; {\\rm\nM}_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ (TXS~1200+045) and ${\\dot M} \\approx 18 \\; {\\rm\nM}_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ (TXS~1245$-$197), comparable to the mass outflow rates seen\nearlier in low-redshift active galactic nuclei.\n", "  We study the electronic contribution to the main thermoelectric properties of\na molecular junction consisting of a single quantum dot coupled to graphene\nexternal leads. The system electrical conductivity (G), Seebeck coefficient\n($S$), and the thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$), are numerically calculated\nbased on a Green's function formalism that includes contributions up to the\nHartree-Fock level. We consider the system leads to be made either of pure or\ngapped-graphene. To describe the free electrons in the gapped-graphene\nelectrodes we used two possible scenarios, the massive gap scenario, and the\nmassless gap scenario, respectively. In all cases, the Fano effect is\nresponsible for a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law and we found a\nsubstantial increase of the system figure of merit $ZT$ due to a drastic\nreduction of the system thermal coefficient. In the case of gapped-graphene\nelectrodes, the system figure of merit presents a maximum at an optimal value\nof the energy gap of the order of $\\Delta/D\\sim$ 0.002 (massive gap scenario)\nand $\\Delta/D\\sim$ 0.0026 (massless gap scenario). Additionally, for all cases,\nthe system figure of merit is temperature dependent.\n", "  There have been several spectral bounds for the percolation transition in\nnetworks, using spectrum of matrices associated with the network such as the\nadjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. However they are far from\nbeing tight when the network is sparse and displays clustering or transitivity,\nwhich is represented by existence of short loops e.g. triangles. In this work,\nfor the bond percolation, we first propose a message passing algorithm for\ncalculating size of percolating clusters considering effects of triangles, then\nrelate the percolation transition to the leading eigenvalue of a matrix that we\nname the triangle-non-backtracking matrix, by analyzing stability of the\nmessage passing equations. We establish that our method gives a tighter\nlower-bound to the bond percolation transition than previous spectral bounds,\nand it becomes exact for an infinite network with no loops longer than 3. We\nevaluate numerically our methods on synthetic and real-world networks, and\ndiscuss further generalizations of our approach to include higher-order\nsub-structures.\n", "  Single photon emitters are indispensable to photonic quantum technologies.\nHere we demonstrate waveform-controlled high-purity single photons from\nroom-temperature colloidal quantum dots. The purity of the single photons does\nnot vary with the excitation power, thereby allowing the generation rate to be\nincreased without compromising the single-photon quality.\n", "  All-optical spin switching is a potential trailblazer for information storage\nand communication at an unprecedented fast rate and free of magnetic fields.\nHowever, the current wisdom is largely based on semiempirical models of\neffective magnetic fields and heat pulses, so it is difficult to provide\nhigh-speed design protocols for actual devices. Here, we carry out a massively\nparallel first-principles and model calculation for thirteen spin systems and\nmagnetic layers, free of any effective field, to establish a simpler and\nalternative paradigm of laser-induced ultrafast spin reversal and to point out\na path to a full-integrated photospintronic device. It is the interplay of the\noptical selection rule and sublattice spin orderings that underlines seemingly\nirreconcilable helicity-dependent/independent switchings. Using realistic\nexperimental parameters, we predict that strong ferrimagnets, in particular,\nLaves phase C15 rare-earth alloys, meet the telecommunication energy\nrequirement of 10 fJ, thus allowing a cost-effective subpicosecond laser to\nswitch spin in the GHz region.\n", "  The long-term X-ray lightcurves of classical supergiant X-ray binaries and\nsupergiant fast X-ray transients show relatively similar super-orbital\nmodulations, which are still lacking a sound interpretation. We propose that\nthese modulations are related to the presence of corotating interaction regions\n(CIRs) known to thread the winds of OB supergiants. To test this hypothesis, we\ncouple the outcomes of 3-D hydrodynamic models for the formation of CIRs in\nstellar winds with a simplified recipe for the accretion onto a neutron star.\nThe results show that the synthetic X-ray light curves are indeed modulated by\nthe presence of the CIRs. The exact period and amplitude of these modulations\ndepend on a number of parameters governing the hydrodynamic wind models and on\nthe binary orbital configuration. To compare our model predictions with the\nobservations, we apply the 3-D wind structure previously shown to well explain\nthe appearance of discrete absorption components in the UV time series of a\nprototypical B0.5I-type supergiant. Using the orbital parameters of\nIGRJ16493-4348 which has the same B0.5I donor spectral type, the period and\nmodulations in the simulated X-ray light-curve are similar to the observed\nones, thus providing support to our scenario. We propose, that the presence of\nCIRs in donor star winds should be considered in future theoretical and\nsimulation efforts of wind-fed X-ray binaries.\n", "  We prove that special functions of bounded deformation with small jump set\nare close in energy to functions which are smooth in a slightly smaller domain.\nThis permits to generalize the decay estimate by De Giorgi, Carriero, and Leaci\nto the linearized context in dimension n and to establish the closedness of the\njump set for local minimizers of the Griffith energy.\n", "  Models and observations suggest that ice-particle aggregation at and beyond\nthe snowline dominates the earliest stages of planet-formation, which therefore\nis subject to many laboratory studies. However, the pressure-temperature\ngradients in proto-planetary disks mean that the ices are constantly processed,\nundergoing phase changes between different solid phases and the gas phase. Open\nquestions remain as to whether the properties of the icy particles themselves\ndictate collision outcomes and therefore how effectively collision experiments\nreproduce conditions in pro- toplanetary environments. Previous experiments\noften yielded apparently contradictory results on collision outcomes, only\nagreeing in a temperature dependence setting in above $\\approx$ 210 K. By\nexploiting the unique capabilities of the NIMROD neutron scattering instrument,\nwe characterized the bulk and surface structure of icy particles used in\ncollision experiments, and studied how these structures alter as a function of\ntemperature at a constant pressure of around 30 mbar. Our icy grains, formed\nunder liquid nitrogen, undergo changes in the crystalline ice-phase,\nsublimation, sintering and surface pre-melting as they are heated from 103 to\n247 K. An increase in the thickness of the diffuse surface layer from $\\approx$\n10 to $\\approx$ 30 {\\AA} ($\\approx$ 2.5 to 12 bilayers) proves increased\nmolecular mobility at temperatures above $\\approx$ 210 K. As none of the other\nchanges tie-in with the temperature trends in collisional outcomes, we conclude\nthat the surface pre-melting phenomenon plays a key role in collision\nexperiments at these temperatures. Consequently, the pressure-temperature\nenvironment, may have a larger influence on collision outcomes than previously\nthought.\n", "  We present a hard X-ray observation of the TeV gamma-ray binary candidate\nHESS J1832-093 coincident with supernova remnant (SNR) G22.7-0.2 using the\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). Non-thermal X-ray emission from\nXMMU J183245-0921539, the X-ray source associated with HESS J1832-093, is\ndetected up to ~30 keV and is well-described by an absorbed power-law model\nwith the best-fit photon index $\\Gamma = 1.5\\pm0.1$. A re-analysis of archival\nChandra and XMM-Newton data finds that the long-term X-ray flux increase of\nXMMU J183245-0921539 is $50^{+40}_{-20}$% (90% C.L.), much less than previously\nreported. A search for a pulsar spin period or binary orbit modulation yields\nno significant signal to a pulse fraction limit of fp < 19% in the range 4 ms <\nP < 40 ks. No red noise is detected in the FFT power spectrum to suggest active\naccretion from a binary system. While further evidence is required, we argue\nthat the X-ray and gamma-ray properties of XMMU J183245-0921539 are most\nconsistent with a non-accreting binary generating synchrotron X- rays from\nparticle acceleration in the shock formed as a result of the pulsar and stellar\nwind collision. We also report on three nearby hard X-ray sources, one of which\nmay be associated with diffuse emission from a fast-moving supernova fragment\ninteracting with a dense molecular cloud.\n", "  In this paper, we report on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy\n(STM/STS) measurements on iron doped 1$T$-Ta$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$S$_2$. A novel domain\nstructure composed of the domains with localized nature divided by the walls is\nobserved in Ta$_{0.99}$Fe$_{0.01}$S$_2$, where the Mott transition is\ncompletely suppressed. This indicates that the melting of the Mott state\naccompanies the appearance of the domain structure. Since the number of walls\nincrease in superconducting Ta$_{0.98}$Fe$_{0.02}$S$_2$, the domain walls seem\nto be responsible for superconductivity in iron doped 1$T$-TaS$_2$.\n", "  Most substances can crystallise into two or more different crystal lattices,\ncalled polymorphs. Despite this, there are no systems in which we can\nquantitatively predict the probability of one competing polymorph forming,\ninstead of the other. We address this problem using large scale (hundreds of\nevents) studies of the competing nucleation of the alpha and gamma polymorphs\nof glycine. In situ Raman spectroscopy is used to identify the polymorph of\neach crystal. We find that the nucleation kinetics of the two polymorphs is\nvery different. Nucleation of the alpha polymorph starts off slowly but\naccelerates, while nucleation of the gamma polymorph starts off fast but then\nslows. We exploit this difference to increase the purity with which we obtain\nthe gamma polymorph by a factor of ten. The statistics of the nucleation of\ncrystals is analogous to that of human mortality, and using a result from\nmedical statistics we show that conventional nucleation data can say nothing\nabout what, if any, are the correlations between competing nucleation\nprocesses. Thus we can show that, with data of our form, it is impossible to\ndisentangle the competing nucleation processes. We also find that the growth\nrate and the shape of a crystal depends on when it nucleated. This is new\nevidence that nucleation and growth are linked.\n", "  In our work we consider the following problem in the context of\nteleportation: an unknown pure state have to be teleported and there are two\nlaboratories which can perform the task. One laboratory uses a pure non\nmaximally entangled channel but has a capability of performing the joint\nmeasurement on bases with a constrained degree of entanglement; the other lab\nmakes use of a mixed X-state channel but can perform a joint measurement on\nbases with higher entanglement degrees. We compare the average teleportation\nfidelity achieved in both cases, finding that the fidelity achieved with the\nX-state can surpass the obtained with a pure channel, even though the X-state\nis less entangled than the latter. We find the conditions under which this\neffect occurs. Our results evidence that the entanglement of the joint\nmeasurement plays a role as important as the entanglement of the channel in\norder to optimize the teleportation process. We include an example showing that\nthe average fidelity of teleportation obtained with a Werner state channel can\nbe grater than that obtained with a Bell state channel.\n", "  A quantum particle in a slowly-changing potential well\n$V(x,t)=V(x-x_0(\\epsilon t))$, periodically shaken in time at a slow frequency\n$\\epsilon$, provides an important quantum mechanical system where the adiabatic\ntheorem fails to predict the asymptotic dynamics over time scales longer than $\n\\sim 1 / \\epsilon$. Specifically, we consider a double-well potential $V(x)$\nsustaining two bound states spaced in frequency by $\\omega_0$ and\nperiodically-shaken in complex plane. Two different spatial displacements\n$x_0(t)$ are assumed: the real spatial displacement $x_0(\\epsilon t)=A \\sin\n(\\epsilon t)$, corresponding to ordinary Hermitian shaking, and the complex one\n$x_0(\\epsilon t)=A-A \\exp( -i \\epsilon t)$, corresponding to non-Hermitian\nshaking. When the particle is initially prepared in the ground state of the\npotential well, breakdown of adiabatic evolution is found for both Hermitian\nand non-Hermitian shaking whenever the oscillation frequency $\\epsilon$ is\nclose to an odd-resonance of $\\omega_0$. However, a different physical\nmechanism underlying nonadiabatic transitions is found in the two cases. For\nthe Hermitian shaking, an avoided crossing of quasi-energies is observed at odd\nresonances and nonadiabatic transitions between the two bound states, resulting\nin Rabi flopping, can be explained as a multiphoton resonance process. For the\ncomplex oscillating potential well, breakdown of adiabaticity arises from the\nappearance of Floquet exceptional points at exact quasi energy crossing.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an approach to accelerate the dissipation dynamics\nfor quantum state generation with Lyapunov control. The strategy is to add\ntarget-state-related coherent control fields into the dissipation process to\nintuitively improve the evolution speed. By applying the current approach,\nwithout losing the advantages of dissipation dynamics, the target stationary\nstates can be generated in a much shorter time as compared to that via\ntraditional dissipation dynamics. As a result, the current approach containing\nthe advantages of coherent unitary dynamics and dissipation dynamics allows for\nsignificant improvement in quantum state generation.\n", "  We present an analysis of the host-galaxy environment of Swope Supernova\nSurvey 2017a (SSS17a), the discovery of an electromagnetic counterpart to a\ngravitational wave source, GW170817. SSS17a occurred 1.9 kpc (in projection;\n10.2\") from the nucleus of NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 Mpc. We\npresent a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-trigger image of NGC 4993, Magellan\noptical spectroscopy of the nucleus of NGC 4993 and the location of SSS17a, and\nbroad-band UV through IR photometry of NGC 4993. The spectrum and broad-band\nspectral-energy distribution indicate that NGC 4993 has a stellar mass of log\n(M/M_solar) = 10.49^{+0.08}_{-0.20} and star formation rate of 0.003\nM_solar/yr, and the progenitor system of SSS17a likely had an age of >2.8 Gyr.\nThere is no counterpart at the position of SSS17a in the HST pre-trigger image,\nindicating that the progenitor system had an absolute magnitude M_V > -5.8 mag.\nWe detect dust lanes extending out to almost the position of SSS17a and >100\nlikely globular clusters associated with NGC 4993. The offset of SSS17a is\nsimilar to many short gamma-ray burst offsets, and its progenitor system was\nlikely bound to NGC 4993. The environment of SSS17a is consistent with an old\nprogenitor system such as a binary neutron star system.\n", "  We present a new two-snapshot structured light illumination (SLI)\nreconstruction algorithm for fast image acquisition. The new algorithm, which\nonly requires two mutually {\\pi} phase-shifted raw structured images, is\nimplemented on a custom-built temporal focusing fluorescence microscope (TFFM)\nto enhance its axial resolution via a digital micromirror device (DMD). First,\nthe orientation of the modulated sinusoidal fringe patterns is automatically\nidentified via spatial frequency vector detection. Subsequently, the modulated\nin-focal-plane images are obtained via rotation and subtraction. Lastly, a\nparallel amplitude demodulation method, derived based on Hilbert transform, is\napplied to complete the decoding processes. To demonstrate the new SLI\nalgorithm, a TFFM is custom-constructed, where a DMD replaces the generic\nblazed grating in the system and simultaneously functions as a diffraction\ngrating and a programmable binary mask, generating arbitrary fringe patterns.\nThe experimental results show promising depth-discrimination capability with an\naxial resolution enhancement factor of 1.25, which matches well with the\ntheoretical estimation, i.e, 1.27. Imaging experiments on pollen grain samples\nhave been performed. The results indicate that the two-snapshot algorithm\npresents comparable contrast reconstruction and optical cross-sectioning\ncapability with those adopting the conventional root-mean-square (RMS)\nreconstruction method. The two-snapshot method can be readily applied to any\nsinusoidally modulated illumination systems to realize high-speed 3D imaging as\nless frames are required for each in-focal-plane image restoration, i.e., the\nimage acquisition speed is improved by 2.5 times for any two-photon systems.\n", "  On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later\ndesignated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through\ngravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The\nFermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB\n170817A) with a time delay of $\\sim$1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From\nthe gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky\nregion of 31 deg$^2$ at a luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-8}$ Mpc and with\ncomponent masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later\nmeasured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 Msun. An extensive observing campaign\nwas launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a\nbright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT\n2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at $\\sim$40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by\nthe One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The\noptical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour.\nSubsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early\nultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours.\nOptical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over $\\sim$10\ndays. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered\nat the transient's position $\\sim$9 and $\\sim$16 days, respectively, after the\nmerger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process\nthat is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared\nemission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent\nwith the source were found in follow-up searches. (Abridged)\n", "  We present an implementation of the Gehrels et al. (2016) galaxy-targeted\nstrategy for gravitational-wave (GW) follow-up using the Las Cumbres\nObservatory global network of telescopes. We use the Galaxy List for the\nAdvanced Detector Era (GLADE) galaxy catalog, which we show is complete (with\nrespect to a Schechter function) out to ~300 Mpc for galaxies brighter than the\nmedian Schechter function galaxy luminosity. We use a prioritization algorithm\nto select the galaxies with the highest chance of containing the counterpart\ngiven their luminosity, their position, and their distance relative to a GW\nlocalization, and in which we are most likely to detect a counterpart given its\nexpected brightness compared to the limiting magnitude of our telescopes. This\nalgorithm can be easily adapted to any expected transient parameters and\ntelescopes. We implemented this strategy during the second Advanced Detector\nObserving Run (O2) and followed the black hole merger GW170814 and the neutron\nstar merger GW170817. For the latter, we identified an optical\nkilonova/macronova counterpart thanks to our algorithm selecting the correct\nhost galaxy fifth in its ranked list among 182 galaxies we identified in the\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory LIGO-Virgo localization.\nThis also allowed us to obtain some of the earliest observations of the first\noptical transient ever triggered by a GW detection (as presented in a companion\npaper).\n", "  We present the results of prompt optical follow-up of the electromagnetic\ncounterpart of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 by the Transient Optical\nRobotic Observatory of the South Collaboration (TOROS). We detected highly\nsignificant dimming in the light curves of the counterpart (Delta g=0.17+-0.03\nmag, Delta r=0.14+-0.02 mag, Delta i=0.10 +- 0.03 mag) over the course of only\n80 minutes of observations obtained ~35 hr after the trigger with the T80-South\ntelescope. A second epoch of observations, obtained ~59 hr after the event with\nthe EABA 1.5m telescope, confirms the fast fading nature of the transient. The\nobserved colors of the counterpart suggest that this event was a \"blue\nkilonova\" relatively free of lanthanides.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss dynamical instability of charged dissipative\ncylinder under radial oscillations. For this purpose, we follow the Eulerian\nand Lagrangian approaches to evaluate linearized perturbed equation of motion.\nWe formulate perturbed pressure in terms of adiabatic index by applying the\nconservation of baryon numbers. A variational principle is established to\ndetermine characteristic frequencies of oscillation which define stability\ncriteria for gaseous cylinder. We compute the ranges of radii as well as\nadiabatic index for both charged and uncharged cases in Newtonian and\npost-Newtonian limits. We conclude that dynamical instability occurs in the\npresence of charge if the gaseous cylinder contracts to the radius $R_{*}$.\n", "  We present a project dedicated to hot plasma spectroscopy based on a\nMulti-Configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) code, initially developed by J. Bruneau.\nThe code is briefly described and the use of the transition-state method for\nplasma spectroscopy is detailed. Then an opacity code for\nlocal-thermodynamic-equilibrium plasmas using MCDF data, named OPAMCDF, is\npresented. Transition arrays for which the number of lines is too large to be\nhandled in a Detailed-Line-Accounting calculation can be modeled within the\nPartially-Resolved-Transition-Array method or using the\nUnresolved-Transition-Arrays formalism in jj-coupling. An improvement of the\noriginal Partially-Resolved-Transition-Array method is presented which gives a\nbetter agreement with Detailed-Line-Accounting computations. Comparisons with\nsome absorption and emission experimental spectra are shown. Finally, the\ncapability of the MCDF code to compute atomic data required for\ncollisional-radiative modeling of plasma at non local thermodynamic equilibrium\nis illustrated. Additionally to photoexcitation, this code can be used to\ncalculate photoionization, electron impact excitation and ionization\ncross-sections as well as autoionization rates in the Distorted-Wave or Close\nCoupling approximations. Comparisons with cross-sections and rates available in\nthe literature are discussed.\n", "  We present a scenario where the stability of dark matter and the\nphenomenology of neutrinos are related by the breaking of a flavour symmetry.\nWe propose two models based on this idea for which we have obtained interesting\nneutrino and dark matter phenomenology.\n", "  A next-to-leading order correction to the high-energy factorization limit of\nradiation spectrum from an ultrarelativistic electron scattering in an external\nfield is evaluated. Generally, it does not express through scattering\ncharacteristics, and accounts for smoothness of the crossover between the\ninitial and final electron asymptotes. A few examples of application of this\nformula are given, including bremsstrahlung in amorphous matter and undulator\nradiation.\n", "  We present a new precision radial velocity dataset that reveals a\nmulti-planet system orbiting the G0V star HD 34445. Our 18-year span consists\nof 333 precision radial velocity observations, 56 of which were previously\npublished, and 277 which are new data from Keck Observatory, Magellan at Las\nCampanas Observatory, and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory.\nThese data indicate the presence of six planet candidates in Keplerian motion\nabout the host star with periods of 1057, 215, 118, 49, 677, and 5700 days, and\nminimum masses of 0.63, 0.17, 0.1, 0.05, 0.12 and 0.38 Jupiter masses\nrespectively. The HD 34445 planetary system, with its high degree of\nmultiplicity, its long orbital periods, and its induced stellar radial velocity\nhalf-amplitudes in the range $2 \\,{\\rm m\\, s^{-1}} \\lesssim K \\lesssim 5\\,{\\rm\nm\\, s^{-1}}$ is fundamentally unlike either our own solar system (in which only\nJupiter and Saturn induce significant reflex velocities for the Sun), or the\nKepler multiple-transiting systems (which tend to have much more compact\norbital configurations)\n", "  Continuous wavelet transform approach has been applied to the pseudo-rapidity\ndistribution of shower particles produced in 16O-AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV\nand 32S-AgBr interactions at 200 AgeV. Multiscale analysis of wavelet\npseudo-rapidity spectra has been performed in order to find out the presence of\nring-like correlation, which could be either due to production of Cherenkov\ngluons or due to propagation of Mach Shock wave through excited nuclear matter.\nThis approach fulfils the basic requirement of both effects that they lead to\nan overabundance of considered particles at some typical pseudo-rapidities.\nComparison of experimental results with that obtained from analyzing events\ngenerated by FRITIOF code are not reproduced.\n", "  An algorithm for finding the bound-state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a\nHermitian Hamiltonian operator using Green's method, developed by\nWaxman\\cite{W98},has been extended to include non-Hermitian Hamiltonian\noperators.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a cosmological model of the flat and homogeneous\nuniverse for the Starobinsky model $F(R)=\\alpha R + \\beta R^{2}$, which is\nnon-minimally coupled with f-essence. For this model we obtained the field\nequations and considered particular solutions of the coupling and fermionic\nfield functions. It is shown that the fermionic field can describe a nature of\nthe universe.\n", "  From $5.5$ months of dual-band optical photometric monitoring at the $1$ mmag\nlevel, BRITE-Constellation has revealed two simultaneous types of variability\nin the O4I(n)fp star $\\zeta$ Puppis: one single periodic non-sinusoidal\ncomponent superimposed on a stochastic component. The monoperiodic component is\nthe $1.78$ d signal previously detected by Coriolis/SMEI, but this time along\nwith a prominent first harmonic. The shape of this signal changes over time, a\nbehaviour that is incompatible with stellar oscillations but consistent with\nrotational modulation arising from evolving bright surface inhomogeneities. By\nmeans of a constrained non-linear light curve inversion algorithm we mapped the\nlocations of the bright surface spots and traced their evolution. Our\nsimultaneous ground-based multi-site spectroscopic monitoring of the star\nunveiled cyclical modulation of its He II $\\lambda4686$ wind emission line with\nthe $1.78$-day rotation period, showing signatures of Corotating Interaction\nRegions (CIRs) that turn out to be driven by the bright photospheric spots\nobserved by BRITE. Traces of wind clumps are also observed in the He II\n$\\lambda4686$ line and are correlated with the amplitudes of the stochastic\ncomponent of the light variations probed by BRITE at the photosphere,\nsuggesting that the BRITE observations additionally unveiled the photospheric\ndrivers of wind clumps in $\\zeta$ Pup and that the clumping phenomenon starts\nat the very base of the wind. The origins of both the bright surface\ninhomogeneities and the stochastic light variations remain unknown, but a\nsubsurface convective zone might play an important role in the generation of\nthese two types of photospheric variability.\n", "  Mesoporous silica particles have been synthesized by sol-gel method from\ntetraethoxysilane (tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS) and methyltriethoxysilane\n(MTES), in ethanol and water mixture, at different ratios of the of the silica\nprecursors. Ammonia was used as catalyst at room temperature and\nhexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) as\nthe structure directing agent. Nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction and\nsmall-angle neutron scattering gave information on the evolution of the gel\nstructure and pore morphologies in the function of MTES/TEOS molar ratio.\nThermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis showed that with addition\nof MTES the exothermic peak indicating the oxidation of the low molecular\nweight organic fragments shift to higher temperature. A room-temperature,\none-pot synthesis of MCM-41 type materials is presented, in which the variation\nof the MTES concentration allows to change the hydrophobicity, preserving the\nspecific properties materials, like the ordered pore structure, large specific\nsurface area and high porosity, making them suitable for selective uptake of\nguest species in drug loading applications. Specifically, the obtained\nmaterials had cylindrical pores, specific surface areas up to 1101 m2/g and\ntotal pore volumes up to 0.473 cm3/g. The obtained mesoporous materials are\nsusceptible for further functionalization to improve their selective uptake of\nguest species in drug delivery applications.\n", "  Among solutions of the strong CP problem, the \"invisible\" axion in the narrow\naxion window is argued to be the remaining possibility among natural solutions\non the smallness of $\\bar{\\theta}$. Related to the gravity spoil of global\nsymmetries, some prospective \"invisible\" axions from theory point of view are\ndiscussed. In all these discussions including the observational possibility and\ncosmological constraints, including a safe domain wall problem, must be\nincluded.\n", "  We discuss black hole spacetimes with a geometrically defined quasi-local\nhorizon on which the curvature tensor is algebraically special relative to the\nalignment classification. Based on many examples and analytical results, we\nconjecture that a spacetime horizon is always more algebraically special (in\nall of the orders of specialization) than other regions of spacetime. Using\nrecent results in invariant theory, such geometric black hole horizons can be\nidentified by the alignment type $\\textbf{II}$ or $\\textbf{D}$ discriminant\nconditions in terms of scalar curvature invariants, which are not dependent on\nspacetime foliations. The above conjecture is, in fact, a suite of conjectures\n(isolated vs dynamical horizon; four vs higher dimensions; zeroth order\ninvariants vs higher order differential invariants). However, we are\nparticularly interested in applications in four dimensions and especially the\nlocation of a black hole in numerical computations.\n", "  The viscous spreading of planetary rings is believed to be counteracted by\nsatellite torques, either through an individual resonance or through\noverlapping resonances. For the A ring of Saturn, it has been commonly believed\nthat the satellite Janus alone can prevent the ring from spreading via its 7:6\nLindblad resonance. We discuss this common misconception and show that, in\nreality, the A ring is confined by the contributions from the group of\nsatellites Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas, whose\ncumulative torques from various resonances gradually decrease the angular\nmomentum flux transported outward through the ring via density and bending\nwaves. We further argue that this decrease in angular momentum flux occurs\nthrough 'flux reversal'.\n  Furthermore, we use the magnitude of the satellites' resonance torques to\nestimate the effective viscosity profile across the A ring, showing that it\ndecreases with radius from ~50 cm2 s-1 to less than ~10 cm2 s-1. The gradual\nestimated decrease of the angular momentum flux and effective viscosity are\nroughly consistent with results obtained by balancing the shepherding torques\nfrom Pan and Daphnis with the viscous torque at the edges of the Encke and\nKeeler gaps, as well as the edge of the A ring.\n  On the other hand, the Mimas 2:1 Lindblad resonance alone seems to be capable\nof confining the edge of the B ring, and contrary to the situation in the A\nring, we show that the effective viscosity across the B ring is relatively\nconstant at ~24-30 cm2 s-1.\n", "  Particle correlations at small relative momenta can be used to measure the\nspace$-$time characteristics of particle production on the femtoscopic\n(fm=10$^{-15}$ m) level in high-energy collisions. Such correlations arise due\nto quantum statistics and final state interactions. We report correlations of\ntwo charged identical kaons measured in p$-$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=5.02$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The femtoscopic invariant\nradii and correlation strengths are extracted from the one-dimensional kaon\ncorrelation functions and are compared to those obtained in pp and Pb$-$Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV, respectively.\nKaon femtoscopy in p$-$Pb collisions is an important supplement to that in pp\nand Pb$-$Pb collisions because it allows one to understand the particle\nproduction mechanisms in different collision systems. It also complements the\nexisting pion correlation results. The obtained radii increase with increasing\nmultiplicity and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum. At\ncomparable multiplicity, the radii measured in p$-$Pb collisions are close to\nthose observed in pp collisions, whereas it is difficult to compare them with\nthe results from Pb$-$Pb collisions because of a big multiplicity gap.\n", "  We aim at studying gasodynamic vortex cooling in an analytically solvable,\nthermodynamically consistent model that can explain limitations on the cooling\nefficiency. To this end, we study a angular plus radial flow between two\n(co-axial) rotating permeable cylinders. Full account is taken of\ncompressibility, viscosity and heat conductivity. For a weak inward radial flow\nthe model qualitatively describes the vortex cooling effect|both in terms of\ntemperature and of decrease of the stagnation enthalpy|seen in short uniflow\nvortex (Ranque) tubes. The cooling does not result from external work, and its\nefficiency is defined as the ratio of the lowest temperature reached\nadiabatically (for the given pressure gradient) to the actually reached lowest\ntemperature. We show that for the vortex cooling the efficiency is strictly\nsmaller than 1, but in another configuration with an outward radial flow, we\nfound that the efficiency can be larger than 1. This is related to both the\ngeometry and the finite heat conductivity.\n", "  The distribution of coherence in multipartite systems is one of the\nfundamental problems in the resource theory of coherence. To quantify the\ncoherence in multipartite systems more precisely, we introduce new coherence\nmeasures, incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures, on bipartite systems by\nthe max- and min- relative entropies and provide the operational interpretation\nin certain subchannel discrimination problem. By introducing the smooth max-\nand min- relative entropies of incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence on bipartite\nsystems, we exhibit the distribution of coherence in multipartite systems: the\ntotal coherence is lower bounded by the sum of local coherence and genuine\nmultipartite entanglement. Besides, we find the monogamy relationship for\ncoherence on multipartite systems by incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence\nmeasures. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced here truly capture the\nnon-sharability of quantumness of coherence in multipartite context.\n", "  Statistical sampling with the complex Langevin (CL) equation is applied to\n(0+1)-dimensional Thirring model, and its uniform-field variant, at finite\nfermion chemical potential $\\mu$. The CL simulation reproduces a crossover\nbehavior which is similar to but actually deviating from the exact solution in\nthe transition region, where we confirm that the CL simulation becomes\nsusceptible to the drift singularities, i.e., zeros of the fermion determinant.\nIn order to simulate the transition region with the CL method correctly, we\nexamine two approaches, a reweighting method and a model deformation, in both\nof which a single thimble with an attractive fixed point practically covers the\nintegration domain and the CL sampling avoids the determinant zeros. It turns\nout that these methods can reproduce the correct crossover behavior of the\noriginal model with using reference ensembles in the complexified space.\nHowever, they need evaluation of the reweighting factor, which scales with the\nsystem size exponentially. We discuss feasibility of applying these methods to\nthe Thirring model and to more realistic theories.\n", "  Cells forming various epithelial tissues have a strikingly universal\ndistribution for the number of their edges. It is generally assumed that this\ntopological feature is predefined by the statistics of individual cell\ndivisions in growing tissue but existing theoretical models are unable to\npredict the observed distribution. Here we show experimentally, as well as in\nsimulations, that the probability of cellular division increases exponentially\nwith the number of edges of the dividing cell and show analytically that this\nis responsible for the observed shape of cell-edge distribution.\n", "  We detail the calibration of the D-dot probes used on the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory DARHT Axis 1 LIA compensation cans (CCs). We hope this will serve\nnot only as a record of this calibration, but also as a guide on how to perform\nsimilar calibrations on other systems where D-dots are deployed. Although a\nsimple measurement, its difficulty lies in the fact that the same geometry used\nwhen fielded must be used during calibration, the ultimate goal being to\nmeasure the capacitance between the probe sensor and the component whose\nvoltage one intends to measure. Because of its linearity with voltage, this can\nbe done at a lower voltage than during fielding, the only caveat being that\nthis lower voltage pulse must still provide enough signal to noise. After a\nbrief summary of our results, we include a description of a compensation can,\nthe D-dot probe and its operation. We then provide 3D simulation results of the\ncapacitance of this probe to the high voltage bushing under test inside of the\ncompensation can. Finally, we describe our calibration setup and discuss our\nresults.\n", "  The critical behavior of $U(n)$-$\\chi^{4}$-model with antisymmetric tensor\norder parameter at charged regime is studied by means of the field theoretic\nrenormalization group at the leading order of $\\varepsilon$-expansion (one-loop\napproximation). It is shown that renormalization group equations have no\ninfrared attractive charged fixed points. It is also shown that anomalous\ndimension of the order parameter in charged regime appears to be gauge\ndependent.\n", "  Coupling light to ensembles of strongly interacting particles has emerged as\na promising route toward achieving few photon nonlinearities. One specific way\nto implement this kind of nonlinearity is to interface light with highly\nexcited atomic Rydberg states by means of electromagnetically induced\ntransparency, an approach which allows freely propagating photons to acquire\nsynthetic interactions of hitherto unprecedented strength. Here, we present an\noverview of this rapidly developing field, from classical effects to quantum\nmanifestations of the nonlocal nonlinearities emerging in such systems. With an\nemphasis on underlying theoretical concepts, we describe the many experimental\nbreakthroughs so far demonstrated and discuss potential applications looming on\nthe horizon.\n", "  In some instances, e.g. near phase transitions, thermodynamic fluctuations\nbecome macroscopically relevant, and relative amplitudes grow far above the\nstandard $N^{-1/2}$ scale, with $N$ the number of particles. Such large\nfluctuations are characterised by a scale invariant Gaussian power spectrum. In\nthis letter I show that the abrupt drop in the baryonic sound speed across\nrecombination leads to conditions resulting in such large thermodynamic\nGaussian fluctuations in the ionisation fraction of the baryons. Under pressure\nequilibrium, this will result in a mechanism for generating scale invariant\ndensity and temperature fluctuations in the baryonic component, inherent to the\nthermodynamics of the baryons themselves. Within a $\\Lambda$CDM framework, this\nextra random fluctuation source leads to a decoupling of the inflationary relic\nsmall wave number spectrum and the amplitude of the Gaussian random\nfluctuations at frequencies higher than the first acoustic peak, an effect\nwhich could explain the mismatch between cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ninferences and local kinetic determinations of the Hubble constant. Within\nmodified gravity theories in absence of dark matter, the mechanism proposed\nserves as a source for random Gaussian density fluctuations in the acoustic\npeak region.\n", "  In the paper it is argued that the Kochen-Specker theorem necessitates a\nconclusion that for a quantum system it is possible to find a set of projection\noperators which is not truth-value bivalent; that is, a bivalent truth-value\nassignment function imposed on such a set cannot be total. This means that at\nleast one proposition associated with the said set must be neither true nor\nfalse.\n", "  The family of three-dimensional topological insulators opens new avenues to\ndiscover novel photophysics and to develop novel types of photodetectors. ZrTe5\nhas been shown to be a Dirac semimetal possessing unique topological electronic\nand optical properties. Here we present spatially-resolved photocurrent\nmeasurements on devices made of nanoplatelets of ZrTe5, demonstrating the\nphotothermoelectric origin of the photoresponse. Due to the high electrical\nconductivity and good Seebeck coefficient, we obtain noise-equivalent powers as\nlow as 42 pW/Hz1/2 at room temperature for visible light illumination at zero\nbias. We also show that these devices suffer from significant ambient\nreactivity such as the formation of a Te-rich surface region driven by Zr\noxidation, as well as severe reactions with the metal contacts. This reactivity\nresults in significant stresses in the devices, leading to unusual geometries\nthat are useful for gaining insight into the photocurrent mechanisms. Our\nresults indicate that both the large photothermoelectric response and\nreactivity must be considered when designing or interpreting photocurrent\nmeasurements in these systems.\n", "  The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) is being upgraded to increase the\nreceiver sensitivity. This makes the receiver more susceptible to man-made\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI). To improve the receiver performance in\npresence of RFI, real-time RFI excision (filtering) is incorporated in the GMRT\nwideband backend (GWB). The RFI filtering system is implemented on FPGA and\nCPU-GPU platforms to detect and remove broadband and narrowband RFI. The RFI is\ndetected using a threshold-based technique where the threshold is computed\nusing Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) estimator. The filtering is carried out\nby replacing the RFI samples by either noise samples or constant value or\nthreshold. This paper describes the status of the real-time broadband RFI\nexcision system in the wideband receiver chain of the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT).\nThe test methodology for carrying out various tests to demonstrate the\nperformance of broadband RFI excision at the system level and on radio\nastronomical imaging experiments are also described.\n", "  We present the analysis and computational results for the inclination\nrelative effect of moonlets of triple asteroidal systems. Perturbations on\nmoonlets due to the primarys non-sphericity gravity, the solar gravity, and\nmoonlets relative gravity are discussed. The inclination vector for each\nmoonlet follows a periodic elliptical motion; the motion period depends on the\nmoonlets semi-major axis and the primarys J2 perturbations. Perturbation on\nmoonlets from the Solar gravity and moonlets relative gravity makes the motion\nof the x component of the inclination vector of moonlet 1 and the y component\nof the inclination vector of moonlet 2 to be periodic.The mean motion of x\ncomponent and the y component of the inclination vector of each moonlet forms\nan ellipse. However, the instantaneous motion of x component and the y\ncomponent of the inclination vector may be an elliptical disc due to the\ncoupling effect of perturbation forces. Furthermore, the x component of the\ninclination vector of moonlet 1 and the y component of the inclination vector\nof moonlet 2 form a quasi-periodic motion. Numerical calculation of dynamical\nconfigurations of two triple asteroidal systems (216) Kleopatra and (153591)\n2001 SN263 validates the conclusion.\n", "  Scattering of electromagnetic waves by subwavelength objects is accompanied\nby the excitation of electric and magnetic Mie resonances, that may modify\nsubstantially the scattering intensity and radiation pattern. Scattered fields\ncan be decomposed into electric and magnetic multipoles, and the magnetic\nmultipoles define magnetic response of structured materials underpinning the\nnew field of all-dielectric resonant meta-optics. Here we review the recent\ndevelopments in meta-optics and nanophotonics, and demonstrate that the Mie\nresonances can play a crucial role offering novel ways for the enhancement of\nmany optical effects near magnetic and electric multipolar resonances, as well\nas driving a variety of interference phenomena which govern recently discovered\nnovel effects in nanophotonics. We further discuss the frontiers of\nall-dielectric meta-optics for flexible and advanced control of light with full\nphase and amplitude engineering, including nonlinear nanophotonics, anapole\nnanolasers, quantum tomography, and topological photonics.\n", "  We present electrical and structural characterization of epitaxial\nLaTiO3/SrTiO3 quantum wells integrated directly on Si(100). The quantum wells\nexhibit metallic transport described by Fermi-liquid behavior. Carriers arise\nfrom both charge transfer from the LaTiO3 to SrTiO3 and oxygen vacancies in the\nlatter. By reducing the thickness of the quantum wells, an enhancement in\ncarrier-carrier scattering is observed, and insulating transport emerges.\nConsistent with a Mott-driven transition in bulk rare-earth titanates, the\ninsulating behavior is described by activated transport, and the onset of\ninsulating transport occurs near 1 electron per Ti occupation within the SrTiO3\nwell. We also discuss the role that structure and gradients in strain may play\nin enhancing the carrier density. The manipulation of metal-insulator behavior\nin oxides grown directly on Si opens the pathway to harnessing strongly\ncorrelated phenomena in device technologies.\n", "  Ultrafast electrically driven nanoscale light sources are critical components\nin nanophotonics. Compound semiconductor-based light sources for the\nnanophotonic platforms have been extensively investigated over the past\ndecades. However, monolithic ultrafast light sources with a small footprint\nremain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven ultrafast graphene\nlight emitters that achieve light pulse generation with up to 10 GHz bandwidth,\nacross a broad spectral range from the visible to the near-infrared. The fast\nresponse results from ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in graphene, and weak\nelectron-acoustic phonon-mediated coupling between the electronic and lattice\ndegrees of freedom. We also find that encapsulating graphene with hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) layers strongly modifies the emission spectrum by changing\nthe local optical density of states, thus providing up to 460 % enhancement\ncompared to the grey-body thermal radiation for a broad peak centered at 720\nnm. Furthermore, the hBN encapsulation layers permit stable and bright visible\nthermal radiation with electronic temperatures up to 2,000 K under ambient\nconditions, as well as efficient ultrafast electronic cooling via near-field\ncoupling to hybrid polaritonic modes. These high-speed graphene light emitters\nprovide a promising path for on-chip light sources for optical communications\nand other optoelectronic applications.\n", "  Thin films of optimally-doped (001)-oriented YBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta} are\nepitaxially integrated on silicon (001) through growth on a single crystalline\nSrTiO3 buffer. The former is grown using pulsed-laser deposition and the latter\nis grown on Si using oxide molecular beam epitaxy. The single crystal nature of\nthe SrTiO3 buffer enables high quality YBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta} films exhibiting high\ntransition temperatures to be integrated on Si. For a 30 nm thick SrTiO3\nbuffer, 50 nm thick YBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta} films that exhibit a transition\ntemperature of ~ 93 K, and a narrow transition width (< 5 K) are achieved. The\nintegration of single crystalline YBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta} on Si (001) paves the way\nfor the potential exploration of cuprate materials in a variety of\napplications.\n", "  The kinetics of phase transformations at cooling of carbon steel in\ndependence on the temperature of preliminary annealing T$_{an}$ is studied. It\nis shown that the cooling from T$_{an}$ > A$_3$ (i. e. above the temperature of\nferrite start) with the rate 90 - 100 K/s results in structural state which\nessentially dependent on T$_{an}$; at 750$^0$C < T$_{an}$ < 830$^0$C the\ntransformation is of perlite type whereas at T$_{an}$ > 830$^0$C the\nmartensitic structure arises. Our results evidence the formation of a special\nstructural state in a certain range of temperatures near and above the boundary\nof two phase region which is characterized by a substantially nanoscale\nheterogeneity in carbon distribution, lattice distortions, and magnetic\nshort-range order.\n", "  The manuscript investigates the entropy squeezing of a qubit (two-level atom)\ninteracting with the cavity field in the Schr\\\"odinger cat states. The effects\nof the Schr\\\"odinger cat states of the field on the squeezing are examined. Our\nresults suggest that entropy squeezing is not sensitive to the superposition\nfeatures of two coherent states of the Schr\\\"odinger cat states. Furthermore,\nit is found that entropy squeezing occurs as the qubit initially close to its\nmaximally coherent state, and the qubit initially in the maximally coherent\nstate can generate optimal squeezing. This also demonstrates that the atomic\ncoherence has a remarkable effect on the atomic squeezing. On the other hand,\nwe also show how the entropy squeezing is related to the intensity of the\ninitial field.\n", "  Observational data about human behavior is often heterogeneous, i.e.,\ngenerated by subgroups within the population under study that vary in size and\nbehavior. Heterogeneity predisposes analysis to Simpson's paradox, whereby the\ntrends observed in data that has been aggregated over the entire population may\nbe substantially different from those of the underlying subgroups. I illustrate\nSimpson's paradox with several examples coming from studies of online behavior\nand show that aggregate response leads to wrong conclusions about the\nunderlying individual behavior. I then present a simple method to test whether\nSimpson's paradox is affecting results of analysis. The presence of Simpson's\nparadox in social data suggests that important behavioral differences exist\nwithin the population, and failure to take these differences into account can\ndistort the studies' findings.\n", "  We suggested an algorithm for searching the recursion operators for nonlinear\nintegrable equations. It was observed that the recursion operator $R$ can be\nrepresented as a ratio of the form $R=L_1^{-1}L_2$ where the linear\ndifferential operators $L_1$ and $L_2$ are chosen in such a way that the\nordinary differential equation $(L_2-\\lambda L_1)U=0$ is consistent with the\nlinearization of the given nonlinear integrable equation for any value of the\nparameter $\\lambda\\in \\textbf{C}$. For constructing the operator $L_1$ we use\nthe concept of the invariant manifold which is a generalization of the\nsymmetry. Then for searching $L_2$ we take an auxiliary linear equation\nconnected with the linearized equation by the Darboux transformation.\nConnection of the invariant manifold with the Lax pairs and the\nDubrovin-Weierstrass equations is discussed.\n", "  We study the problem of decoding classical information encoded on quantum\nstates at the output of a quantum channel, with particular focus on increasing\nthe communication rates towards the maximum allowed by Quantum Mechanics. After\na brief introduction to the main theoretical formalism employed in the rest of\nthe thesis, i.e., continuous-variable Quantum Information Theory and Quantum\nCommunication Theory, we consider several decoding schemes. First, we treat the\nproblem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any\nquantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a\nbinary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to\nbuild a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on\nquantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of\nquantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum\nmeasurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and\nexperimentally-oriented fashion. Second, we consider a more practical approach\nand describe three receiver structures for coherent states of the\nelectromagnetic field with applications to single-mode state discrimination and\nmulti-mode decoding at the output of a quantum channel. We treat the problem\nbearing in mind the technological limitations faced nowadays in the field of\noptical communications: we evaluate the performance of general decoding schemes\nbased on such technology and report increased performance of two schemes, the\nfirst one employing a non-Gaussian transformation and the second one employing\na code tailored to be read out easily by the most common detectors. Eventually\nwe characterize a large class of multi-mode adaptive receivers based on common\ntechnological resources, obtaining a no-go theorem for their capacity.\n", "  This document is the final report by the Committee on the Scientific Case of\nthe ILC Operating at 250 GeV as a Higgs Factory. This committee was\ncommissioned by the Japan Association of High Energy Physicists. The purpose of\nthis committee is to investigate and compare the capability to determine the\nenergy scale of new phenomena and new principles and the capability to uncover\nthe origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry.\n", "  Inverted type-I heterostructure core/crown quantum rings (QRs) are\nquantum-efficient luminophores, whose spectral characteristics are highly\ntunable. Here, we study the optoelectronic properties of type-I core/crown\nCdS/CdSe QRs in the zincblende phase - over contrasting lateral size and crown\nwidth. For this we inspect their strain profiles, transition energies,\ntransition matrix elements, spatial charge densities, electronic bandstructure,\nband-mixing probabilities, optical gain spectra, maximum optical gains and\ndifferential optical gains. Our framework uses an effective-mass envelope\nfunction theory based on the 8-band k$\\cdot$p method employing the valence\nforce field model for calculating the atomic strain distributions. The gain\ncalculations are based on the density-matrix equation and take into\nconsideration the excitonic effects with intraband scattering. Variations in\nthe QR lateral size and relative widths of core and crown (ergo the\ncomposition) affect their energy levels, band-mixing probabilities, optical\ntransition matrix elements, emission wavelengths/intensity, etc. The optical\ngain of QRs is also strongly dimension and composition dependent with further\ndependency on the injection carrier density causing band-filling effect. They\nalso affect the maximum and differential gain at varying dimensions and\ncompositions.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate thermodynamical quantity of Kerr-Newman-AdS black\nhole solution in quintessence matter. Then, we show that how the rotation and\ncosmological parameters effect to the thermodynamics properties of black hole.\nAlso, we investigate both types of phase transition for different values of\n$\\omega$ parameter in extended phase space. We notice that type one of phase\ntransition occurs for $P<0.42$ and $a<0.5$. And also we see that the phase\ntransition point shifts to higher entropy when pressure $P$, rotation parameter\n$a$ and $\\alpha$ increase. Also, we find that by changing parameter $\\omega$\nfrom -1 to $-\\frac{1}{3}$, the critical point shifts to higher entropy. Then we\nstudy type two of phase transition and show critical points increase by\nincreasing parameter $\\alpha$. Also, we show that the critical point shifts to\nhigher entropy when $\\alpha$, $\\omega$ and rotation parameter $a$ decrease.\nFinally, we find that by decreasing pressure the first critical point shifts to\nlower entropy and second critical point shifts to higher entropy.\n", "  We aim to investigate the nature and occurrence characteristics of grand\nsolar minimum and maximum periods, which are observed in the solar proxy\nrecords such as 10Be and 14C, using a fully non-linear Babcock-Leighton type\nflux-transport dynamo including momentum and entropy equations. The\ndifferential rotation and meridional circulation are generated from the effect\nof turbulent Reynolds stress and are subjected to back-reaction from the\nmagnetic field. To generate grand minimum and maximum-like periods in our\nsimulations, we used random fluctuations in the angular momentum transport\nprocess, namely the Lambda-mechanism, and in the Babcock-Leighton mechanism. To\ncharacterise the nature and occurrences of the identified grand minima and\nmaxima in our simulations, we used the waiting time distribution analyses,\nwhich reflects whether the underlying distribution arises from a random or a\nmemory-bearing process. The results show that, in majority of the cases, the\ndistributions of grand minima and maxima reveal that the nature of these events\noriginates from memoryless processes. We also found that in our simulations the\nmeridional circulation speed tends to be smaller during grand maximum, while it\nis faster during grand minimum periods. The radial differential rotation tend\nto be larger during grand maxima, while it is smaller during grand minima. The\nlatitudinal differential rotation on the other hand is found to be larger\nduring grand minima.\n", "  COMPASS is a fixed target experiment at CERN SPS aimed to study Hadron\nStructure and Spectroscopy. Hadron Identification in the momentum range between\n3 and 55 GeV/c is provided by a large gaseous Ring Imaging Cherenkov Counter\n(RICH-1). To cope with the challenges imposed by the new physics program of\nCOMPASS, RICH-1 have been upgraded by replacing four MWPCs based photon\ndetectors with newly developed MPGD based photon detectors. The architecture of\nthe novel detectors is a hybrid combination of two layers of THGEMs and a\nMicroMegas. The top of the first THGEM is coated with CsI acting as a\nreflective photo-cathode. The anode is segmented in pads capacitively coupled\nto the APV-25 based readout. The new hybrid detectors have been commissioned\nduring 2016 COMPASS data taking and stably operated during 2017 run. In this\npaper all aspects of the novel photon detectors for COMPASS RICH-1 are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Secondary batteries are important energy storage devices for a mobile\nequipment, an electric car, and a large-scale energy storage. Nevertheless,\nvariation of the local electronic state of the battery materials in the charge\n(or oxidization) process are still unclear. Here, we investigated the local\nelectronic state of cobalt-hexacyanoferrate (Na$_x$Co[Fe(CN)$_6$]$_{0.9}$), by\nmeans of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with high energy resolution\n(~100 meV). The L-edge RIXS is one of the most powerful spectroscopic technique\nwith element- and valence-selectivity. We found that the local electronic state\naround Co$^{2+}$ in the partially-charged\nNa$_{1.1}$Co$^{2+}$$_{0.5}$Co$^{3+}$$_{0.5}$[Fe$^{2+}$(CN)$_6$]$_{0.9}$ film (x\n= 1.1) is the same as that of the discharged\nNa$_{1.6}$Co$^{2+}$[Fe$^{2+}$(CN)$_6$]$_{0.9}$ film (x = 1.6) within the energy\nresolution, indicating that the local electronic state around Co$^{2+}$ is\ninvariant against the partial oxidization. In addition, the local electronic\nstate around the oxidized Co$^{3+}$ is essentially the same as that of the\nfully-charged film\nCo$^{3+}$[Fe$^{2+}$(CN)$_6$]$_{0.3}$[Fe$^{3+}$(CN)$_6$]$_{0.6}$ (x = 0.0) film.\nSuch a strong localization of the oxidized Co$^{3+}$ state is advantageous for\nthe reversibility of the redox process, since the localization reduces extra\nreaction within the materials and resultant deterioration.\n", "  We propose the exact solution of the equation in separated variable which\nappears in the process of constructing solutions to the quantum Calogero-Moser\nthree-particle problem with elliptic two-particle potential $g(g-1)\\wp(q)$.\nThis solution is found for special values of coupling constants $g\\in {\\mathbb\nZ}, \\, g>1$. It can be used for solving three-paricle CM problem under\nappropriate boundary conditions.\n", "  Star-planet tidal interactions play a significant role in the dynamical\nevolution of close-in planetary systems. We investigate the propagation and\ndissipation of tidal inertial waves in a stellar/planetary convective region.\nWe take into account a latitudinal differential rotation for the background\nflow, similar to what is observed in the envelope of low-mass stars like the\nSun. Previous works have shown that differential rotation significantly alters\nthe propagation and dissipation properties of inertial waves. In particular,\nwhen the Doppler-shifted tidal frequency vanishes in the fluid, a critical\nlayer forms where tidal dissipation can be greatly enhanced. Our present work\ndevelops a local analytic model to better understand the propagation and\ndissipation properties of tidally forced inertial waves at critical layers.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a kind of optical-electrical-optical (OEO) repeater\nstation for the time transfer based on bidirectional time division multiplexing\ntransmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength (BTDM-SFSW). Along\nthe main fiber link, the forward and backward time signals alternatively pass\nthrough the same OEO repeater via a 2X2 optical switch (OS). By this means, the\noptical powers of bidirectional time signals increase. And parts of excess\nnoises, suffered from the main link, are sufficiently blocked owing to the OEO\nprocess. Simultaneously, the bidirectional time signals can be decoded and\nutilized for multi-access time transfer. As a result of the same devices for\nboth directions, the maximum delay symmetry is maintained, and the performance\nfor multi-access time transfer is guaranteed. With the OEO repeater stations,\nwe successfully demonstrate multi-access time transfer in our time transfer\ntestbeds with the main links up to 13,200 km. The time deviations of less than\n80 ps/s and 11 ps/10^5 s, respectively, are obtained. Furthermore, the combined\nstandard uncertainties of less than 70 ps are reached, which agree well with\nthe experimental verifications over non-calibrated fiber links.\n", "  The identification of abnormal behaviour in mechanical systems is key to\nanticipate and avoid their potential failure. Thus wind turbine health is\ncommonly assessed monitoring series of $10$-minute SCADA and high frequency\ndata from sensors. To monitor wind turbine vibrations, normal behaviour models\nare built to predict tower top accelerations and drive-train vibrations. Signal\ndeviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further\ninvestigated. More efficient models are expected to help enhancing the\nidentification of abnormal behaviour. In this paper we assess a stochastic\napproach to reconstruct the $1$ Hz tower top acceleration signal, which was\nmeasured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German\nNorth Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model\nbased on a neural network, which has been previously reported as a data-mining\nalgorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. In order to focus the\ndiscussion on the similarities and differences of both approaches, we limit our\nevaluation to a single input-output system; in doing so, we avoid other\ndifferences, i.e. loading type, pre-processing or model complexity. Our results\npresent evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in\nthe high frequency domain ($1$ Hz). Although neural network retrieve accurate\nstep-forward predictions, with low mean square errors, the stochastic approach\npredictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the\noriginal signal, remaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our\nstochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted\nfor other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our\nfindings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal\nreconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.\n", "  Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we\nsystematically investigate the structural, electronic and vibrational\nproperties of bulk and potential single-layer structures of perovskite-like\nCsPb2Br5 crystal. It is found that while Cs atoms have no effect on the\nelectronic structure, their presence is essential for the formation of stable\nCsPb2Br5 crystals. Calculated vibrational spectra of the crystal reveal that\nnot only the bulk form but also the single-layer forms of CsPb2Br5 are\ndynamically stable. Predicted single-layer forms can exhibit either\nsemiconducting or metallic character. Moreover, modification of the structural,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of single-layer CsPb2Br5 upon formation of\nvacancy defects is investigated. It is found that the formation of Br vacancy\n(i) has the lowest formation energy, (ii) significantly changes the electronic\nstructure, and (iii) leads to ferromagnetic ground state in the single-layer\nCsPb2Br5 . However, the formation of Pb and Cs vacancies leads to p-type doping\nof the single-layer structure. Results reported herein reveal that single-layer\nCsPb2Br5 crystal is a novel stable perovskite with enhanced functionality and a\npromising candidate for nanodevice applications.\n", "  We study the strongly magnetized white dwarf configurations in a\nself-consistent manner as a progenitor of the over-luminous type-Ia supernovae.\nWe compute static equilibria of white dwarf stars containing a strong magnetic\nfield and present the modification of white dwarf mass-radius relation caused\nby the magnetic field. From a static equilibrium study, we find that a maximum\nwhite dwarf mass of about 1.9 M$_\\odot$ may be supported if the interior\npoloidal field is as strong as approximately $10^{10}$ T. On the other hand if\nthe field is purely toroidal the maximum mass can be more than 5 M$_\\odot$. All\nthese modifications are mainly from the presence of Lorenz force. The effects\nof i) modification of equation of state due to Landau quantization, ii)\nelectrostatic interaction due to ions, iii) general relativistic calculation on\nthe stellar structure and, iv) field geometry are also considered. These\nstrongly magnetised configurations are sensitive to magnetic instabilities\nwhere the perturbations grow at the corresponding Alfven time scales.\n", "  New two-component soliton solutions of the coupled high-frequency (HF) -\nlow-frequency (LF) system, based on Schr\\\"odinger - Korteweg - de Vries (KdV)\nsystem with the Zakharov's coupling, are obtained for arbitrary relative\nstrengths of the nonlinearity and dispersion in the LF component. The complex\nHF field is governed by the linear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a potential\ngenerated by the real LF component, which, in turn, is governed by the KdV\nequation including the ponderomotive coupling term, representing the feedback\nof the HF field onto the LF component. First, we study the evolution of\npulse-shaped pulses by means of direct simulations. In the case when the\ndispersion of the LF component is weak in comparison to its nonlinearity, the\ninput gives rise to several solitons in which the HF component is much broader\nthan its LF counterpart. In the opposite case, the system creates a single\nsoliton with approximately equal widths of both components. Collisions between\nstable solitons are studied too, with a conclusion that the collisions are\ninelastic, with a greater soliton getting still stronger, and the smaller one\nsuffering further attenuation. Robust intrinsic modes are excited in the\ncolliding solitons. A new family of approximate analytical two-component\nsoliton solutions with two free parameters is found for an arbitrary relative\nstrength of the nonlinearity and dispersion of the LF component, assuming weak\nfeedback of the HF field onto the LF component. Further, a one-parameter\n(non-generic) family of exact bright-soliton solutions, with mutually\nproportional HF and LF components, is produced too. Intrinsic dynamics of the\ntwo-component solitons, induced by a shift of their HF component against the LF\none, is also studied, by means of numerical simulations, demonstrating\nexcitation of a robust intrinsic mode\n", "  A monopolist faces a partially uninformed population of consumers,\ninterconnected through a directed social network. In the network, the\nmonopolist offers rewards to informed consumers (influencers) conditional on\ninforming uninformed consumers (influenced). Rewards are needed to bear a\ncommunication cost. We investigate the incentives for the monopolist to move to\na denser network and the impact of this decision on social welfare. Social\nwelfare increases in information diffusion which, for given communication\nincentives, is higher in denser networks. However, the monopolist internalizes\ntransfers and thus may prefer an environment with less competition between\ninformed consumers. The presence of highly connected influencers (hubs) is the\nmain driver that aligns monopolist incentives and welfare.\n", "  We propose a thought experiment, based on a mechanism that is reminiscent of\nCavendish's torsion balance, to investigate the possible quantum nature of the\ngravitational field generated by the quantum superposition state of a massive\nsystem. Our proposal makes use of the dynamics of a ultra-stable optically\nlevitated nanomechanical rotor endowed with a spin to generate a quantum\nangular superposition that is then tested through standard Ramsey-like scheme.\nGravity manifests itself as an effective decoherence mechanism, whose strength\nis different-and, as we show, appreciable-in the classical and quantum case. By\nincorporating both the source for decoherence and the mechanism to probe it,\nthe experiment that we propose allows for a much reduced degree of control and\ndynamical engineering.\n", "  Elastic proton-proton scattering is reviewed starting from the results of the\nLHC experiments conducted by the TOTEM and ATLAS collaborations, and the HEGS\nmodel and a simple phenomenological parametrisation are compared with the new\ndata on the differential elastic proton-proton scattering cross section, which\ndetect a non-exponential behaviour of the differential cross sections in the\nfirst diffraction cone. We consider the influence of various assumptions on the\nextraction of the elastic scattering parameters, and on the deduction of the\ntotal cross section.\n", "  We demonstrate an atom interferometer operating on the $^1S_0-{}^3P_0$ clock\ntransition of $^{87}$Sr atoms in a \"magic\" optical guide, where the light shift\nperturbations of the guiding potential are canceled. As a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is set horizontally to map the\nacceleration introduced by the focused optical guide. This magic guide\ninterferometer on the clock transition is applicable to atomic elements where\nmagic wavelengths can be found. Possible applications of the magic guide\ninterferometer, including a hollow-core fiber interferometer and gradiometer,\nare discussed.\n", "  We consider a symmetric spin-1/2 Ising-XXZ double sawtooth spin ladder\nobtained from distorting a spin chain, with the XXZ interaction between the\ninterstitial Heisenberg dimers (which are connected to the spins based on the\nlegs via an Ising-type interaction), the Ising coupling between\nnearest-neighbor spins of the legs and rungs spins, respectively, and\nadditional cyclic four-spin exchange (ring exchange) in square plaquette of\neach block. The presented analysis supplemented by results of the exact\nsolution of the model with infinite periodic boundary implies a rich ground\nstate phase diagram. As well as the quantum phase transitions, the\ncharacteristics of some of the thermodynamic parameters such as heat capacity,\nmagnetization and magnetic susceptibility are investigated. We here prove that\namong the considered thermodynamic and thermal parameters, solely the heat\ncapacity is sensitive versus the changes of the cyclic four-spin exchange\ninteraction. By using the heat capacity function, we obtain a singularity\nrelation between the cyclic four-spin exchange interaction and the exchange\ncoupling between pair spins on each rung of the spin ladder. All thermal and\nthermodynamic quantities under consideration should investigate by regarding\nthose points which satisfy the singularity relation. The thermal entanglement\nwithin the Heisenberg spin dimers is investigated by using the concurrence,\nwhich is calculated from a relevant reduced density operator in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  General high-order rogue waves of the NLS-Boussinesq equation are obtained by\nthe KP-hierarchy reduction theory. These rogue waves are expressed with the\ndeterminants, whose entries are all algebraic forms. It is found that the\nfundamental rogue waves can be classified three patterns: four-petals state,\ndark state, bright state by choosing different parameter $\\alpha$ values. As\nthe evolution of the parameter $\\alpha$. An interesting phenomena is\ndiscovered: the rogue wave changes from four-petals state to dark state,\nwhereafter to the bright state, which are consistent with the change of the\ncorresponding critical points to the function of two variables. Furthermore,\nthe dynamics of second-order and third-order rogue waves are presented in\ndetail, which can be regarded as the nonlinear superposition of the fundamental\nrogue waves.\n", "  We use Schwinger boson mean field theory (SBMFT) to study the ground state of\nthe spin-$S$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg model with nearest ($J_1$) and\nnext-nearest ($J_2$) neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions. Previous work on\nthe $S=1/2$ model leads us to consider two spin liquid Ans\\\"{a}tze, one\nsymmetric and one nematic, which upon spinon condensation give magnetically\nordered states with 120$^{\\circ}$ order and collinear stripe order,\nrespectively. The SBMFT contains the parameter $\\kappa$, the expectation value\nof the number of bosons per site, which in the exact theory equals $2S$. For\n$\\kappa=1$ there is a direct, first-order transition between the ordered states\nas $J_2/J_1$ increases. Motivated by arguments that in SBMFT, smaller $\\kappa$\nmay be more appropriate for describing the $S=1/2$ case qualitatively, we find\nthat in a $\\kappa$ window around 0.6, a region with the (gapped $Z_2$)\nsymmetric spin liquid opens up between the ordered states. As a consequence,\nthe static structure factor has the same peak locations in the spin liquid as\nin the 120$^{\\circ}$ ordered state, and the phase transitions into the\n120$^{\\circ}$ and collinear stripe ordered states are continuous and\nfirst-order, respectively.\n", "  The Higgs-portal model with a singlet scalar Dark Matter particle is one of\nthe simplest extensions to the Standard Model that can reproduce the relic\ndensity. Unfortunately this model is strongly constrained by direct and\nindirect DM detection, as well as by collider physics. Most of the parameter\nspace is already ruled-out and the rest will be explored in the next future. We\nshow that a simple extension of the DM sector with a second scalar singlet\nenables a substantial opening of the allowed window in the parameter space.\n", "  Pattern transfer by deep anisotropic etch is a well-established technique for\nfabrication of nanoscale devices and structures. For this technique to be\neffective, the resist material plays a key role and must have high resolution,\nreasonable sensitivity and high etch selectivity against the conventional\nsilicon substrate or underlayer film. In this work, the lithographic\nperformance of two high etch resistance materials was evaluated: ZEP520A\n(Nippon Zeon Co.) and mr-PosEBR (micro resist technology GmbH). Both materials\nare positive tone, polymer-based and non-chemically amplified resists. Two\nexposure techniques were used: electron beam lithography (EBL) and extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These resists were originally designed for EBL\npatterning, where high quality patterning at sub-100 nm resolution was\npreviously demonstrated. In the scope of this work, we also aim to validate\ntheir extendibility to EUV for high resolution and large area patterning. To\nthis purpose, the same EBL process conditions were employed at EUV. The figures\nof merit, i.e. dose to clear, dose to size, and resolution, were extracted and\nthese results are discussed systematically. It was found that both materials\nare very fast at EUV (dose to clear lower than 12 mJ/cm2) and are capable of\nresolving dense lines/space arrays with a resolution of 25 nm half-pitch. The\nquality of patterns was also very good and the sidewall roughness was below 6\nnm. Interestingly, the general-purpose process used for EBL can be extended\nstraightforwardly to EUV lithography with comparable high quality and yield.\nOur findings open new possibilities for lithographers who wish to devise novel\nfabrication schemes exploiting EUV for fabrication of nanostructures by deep\netch pattern transfer.\n", "  CO2 capture and storage is an important technology for mitigating climate\nchange. Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the\ncapability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different\ntemporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the\nsame as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal\nscales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens\nof kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2\nneeds to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which\nit can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales\ninvolved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally\nunfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine\nmeans that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and\ndepth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represents a\nbetter strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer\nsystems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock\nformations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In\nparticular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic\ngeology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable\nlayers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in\nterms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer\nsystems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations\nfor multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage\nbetween individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a\nstate-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model.\n", "  In this paper we construct Darboux transformations for the supersymmetric\nTwo-boson equation. Two Darboux transformations and associated B\\\"acklund\ntransformations are presented. For one of them, we also obtain the\ncorresponding the nonlinear superposition formula.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the oscillations and optical properties for\nvacuum, in a model for the dark sector that contains axion-like particles and\nhidden photons. In this model, both can couple to photons. We provide bounds\nfor the couplings versus the mass, using current results from ALPS-I and PVLAS.\nWe also discuss the challenges for the detection of models with more than one\nhidden particle in light shining trough wall-like experiments.\n", "  A dissipative stochastic sandpile model is constructed on one and two\ndimensional small-world networks with different shortcut densities $\\phi$ where\n$\\phi=0$ and $1$ represent a regular lattice and a random network respectively.\nIn the small-world regime ($2^{-12} \\le \\phi \\le 0.1$), the critical behaviour\nof the model is explored studying different geometrical properties of the\navalanches as a function of avalanche size $s$. For both the dimensions, three\nregions of $s$, separated by two crossover sizes $s_1$ and $s_2$ ($s_1<s_2$),\nare identified analyzing the scaling behaviour of average height and area of\nthe toppling surface associated with an avalanche. It is found that avalanches\nof size $s<s_1$ are compact and follow Manna scaling on the regular lattice\nwhereas the avalanches with size $s>s_1$ are sparse as they are on network and\nfollow mean-field scaling. Coexistence of different scaling forms in the\nsmall-world regime leads to violation of usual finite-size scaling, in contrary\nto the fact that the model follows the same on the regular lattice as well as\non the random network independently. Simultaneous appearance of multiple\nscaling forms are characterized by developing a coexistence scaling theory. As\nSWN evolves from regular lattice to random network, a crossover from diffusive\nto super-diffusive nature of sand transport is observed and scaling forms of\nsuch crossover is developed and verified.\n", "  Self-phase modulation (SPM) of light pulses is found to occur strongly, at\nlow incident intensities, in the coupling of light with superconductors. We\ndevelop a theory from a synthesis of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL)\nequation and basic electrodynamics which shows the strongly non-linear phase\naccumulated in the interaction. Unusually, the SPM of the pulse in this system\nis found to be highly asymmetric, producing a strongly redshifted spectrum when\ninteracting with a superconducting thin film, and it develops in just a few\nnanometers of propagation. In this paper we present theoretical results and\nsimulations in the THz regime, for both hyperbolic secant and\nsupergaussian-shaped pulses.\n", "  Given a graph with millions of nodes, what patterns exist in the\ndistributions of node characteristics, and how can we detect them and separate\nanomalous nodes in a way similar to human vision? In this paper, we propose a\nvision-guided algorithm, EagleMine, to summarize micro-cluster patterns in\ntwo-dimensional histogram plots constructed from node features in a large\ngraph. EagleMine utilizes a water-level tree to capture cluster structures\naccording to vision-based intuition at multi-resolutions. EagleMine traverses\nthe water-level tree from the root and adopts statistical hypothesis tests to\ndetermine the optimal clusters that should be fitted along the path, and\nsummarizes each cluster with a truncated Gaussian distribution. Experiments on\nreal data show that our method can find truncated and overlapped elliptical\nclusters, even when some baseline methods split one visual cluster into pieces\nwith Gaussian spheres. To identify potentially anomalous microclusters,\nEagleMine also a designates score to measure the suspiciousness of outlier\ngroups (i.e. node clusters) and outlier nodes, detecting bots and anomalous\nusers with high accuracy in the real Microblog data.\n", "  Low-mass M stars are plentiful in the Universe and often host small, rocky\nplanets detectable with the current instrumentation. Recently, seven small\nplanets have been discovered orbiting the ultracool dwarf\nTRAPPIST-1\\cite{Gillon16,Gillon17}. We examine the role of electromagnetic\ninduction heating of these planets, caused by the star's rotation and the\nplanet's orbital motion. If the stellar rotation and magnetic dipole axes are\ninclined with respect to each other, induction heating can melt the upper\nmantle and enormously increase volcanic activity, sometimes producing a magma\nocean below the planetary surface. We show that induction heating leads the\nthree innermost planets, one of which is in the habitable zone, to either\nevolve towards a molten mantle planet, or to experience increased outgassing\nand volcanic activity, while the four outermost planets remain mostly\nunaffected.\n", "  This expository article, written for the proceedings of the Journ\\'ees EDP\n(Roscoff, June 2017), presents recent work joint with Jean Bourgain\n[arXiv:1612.09040] and Long Jin [arXiv:1705.05019]. We in particular show that\neigenfunctions of the Laplacian on hyperbolic surfaces are bounded from below\nin $L^2$ norm on each nonempty open set, by a constant depending on the set but\nnot on the eigenvalue.\n", "  In conventional gravitational wave scattering theory, a large-distance\nasymptotic approximation is employed. In this approximation, the gravitational\nwave is approximated by its large-distance asymptotics. In this paper, we\nestablish a rigorous gravitational wave scattering theory without the\nlarge-distance asymptotic approximation.\n", "  Well known weakness of Gravity in particle physics is an illusion caused by\nunderestimation of the role of spin in gravity. Relativistic rotation is\ninseparable from spin, which for elementary particles is extremely high and\nexceeds mass on 20-22 orders (in natural Planck units). Such a huge spin\ngenerates frame-dragging that distorts space much stronger than mass, and\neffective scale of gravitational interaction is shifted from Planck to Compton\ndistances. We show that compatibility between gravity and quantum theory can be\nachieved without modifications of Einstein-Maxwell equations, by coupling to a\nsupersymmetric Higgs model of symmetry breaking and forming a non-perturbative\nsuper-bag solution, which generates a gravity-free Compton zone necessary for\nconsistent work of quantum theory. Super-bag is naturally upgraded to\nWess-Zumino supersymmetric QED model, forming a bridge to perturbative\nformalism of conventional QED.\n", "  Even though the LHC searches did not unveil the new physics particles so far,\nLHCb hints towards deviations from lepton flavor universality in exclusive\ndecays based on the transition $b\\to s\\ell\\ell$. In this proceeding, we present\na new leptoquark model that can explain both\n$R_{K}^{\\mathrm{exp}}<R_{K}^{\\mathrm{SM}}$ and\n$R_{K^\\ast}^{\\mathrm{exp}}<R_{K^\\ast}^{\\mathrm{SM}}$ via loop effects,\nconsistent with observations made by LHCb. We discuss the main predictions of\nthis scenario that can be tested experimentally, which include the bounds on\nlepton flavor violating decays $\\mathcal{B}(Z\\to\\mu\\tau) \\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ and $\\mathcal{B}(B\\to K\\mu\\tau)\\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$.\n", "  Wounding is a severe impairment of function, especially for an exposed\norganism like the network-forming true slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The\ntubular network making up the organism's body plan is entirely interconnected\nand shares a common cytoplasm. Oscillatory contractions of the enclosing tube\nwalls drive the shuttle streaming of the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic flows underlie\nthe reorganization of the network for example by movement toward attractive\nstimuli or away from repellants. Here, we follow the reorganization of Physarum\npolycephalum networks after severe wounding. Spatial mapping of the contraction\nchanges in response to wounding reveal a multi-step pattern. Phases of\nincreased activity alternate with cessation of contractions and stalling of\nflows, giving rise to coordinated transport and growth at the severing site.\nOverall, severing surprisingly acts like an attractive stimulus enabling\nhealing of severed tubes. The reproducible cessation of contractions arising\nduring this wound-healing response may open up new venues to investigate the\nbiochemical wiring underlying Physarum polycephalum's complex behaviours.\n", "  Positron Emission Tomography scan images are extensively used in radiotherapy\nplanning, clinical diagnosis, assessment of growth and treatment of a tumor.\nThese all rely on fidelity and speed of detection and delineation algorithm.\nDespite intensive research, segmentation remained a challenging problem due to\nthe diverse image content, resolution, shape, and noise. This paper presents a\nfast positron emission tomography tumor segmentation method in which\nsuperpixels are extracted first from the input image. Principal component\nanalysis is then applied on the superpixels and also on their average. Distance\nvector of each superpixel from the average is computed in principal components\ncoordinate system. Finally, k-means clustering is applied on distance vector to\nrecognize tumor and non-tumor superpixels. The proposed approach is implemented\nin MATLAB 2016 which resulted in an average Dice similarity of 84.2% on the\ndataset. Additionally, a very fast execution time was achieved as the number of\nsuperpixels and the size of distance vector on which clustering was done was\nvery small compared to the number of raw pixels in dataset images.\n", "  We report an exchange bias of more than $2700\\,$Oe at room temperature in\nMnN/CoFe bilayers after high-temperature annealing. We studied the dependence\nof exchange bias on the annealing temperature for different MnN thicknesses in\ndetail and found that samples with $t_{\\text{MnN}}>32\\,$nm show an increase of\nexchange bias for annealing temperatures higher than\n$T_{\\text{A}}=400\\,^{\\circ}$C. Maximum exchange bias values exceeding\n$2000\\,$Oe with reasonably small coercive fields around $600\\,$Oe are achieved\nfor $t_{\\text{MnN}}= 42, 48\\,$nm. The median blocking temperature of those\nsystems is determined to be $180\\,^{\\circ}$C after initial annealing at\n$T_{\\text{A}}=525\\,^{\\circ}$C. X-ray diffraction measurements and Auger depth\nprofiling show that the large increase of exchange bias after high-temperature\nannealing is accompanied by strong nitrogen diffusion into the Ta buffer layer\nof the stacks.\n", "  In principle, higher-order networks that have multiple edge types are more\ninformative than their lower-order counterparts. In practice, however,\nexcessively rich information may be algorithmically infeasible to extract. It\nrequires an algorithm that assumes a high-dimensional model and such an\nalgorithm may perform poorly or be extremely sensitive to the initial estimate\nof the model parameters. Herein, we address this problem of community detection\nthrough a detectability analysis. We focus on the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm with belief propagation (BP), and analytically derive its algorithmic\ndetectability threshold, i.e., the limit of the modular structure strength\nbelow which the algorithm can no longer detect any modular structures. The\nresults indicate the existence of a phase in which the community detection of a\nlower-order network outperforms its higher-order counterpart.\n", "  For the quadratic helicity $\\chi^{(2)}$ we present a generalization of the\nArnol'd inequality which relates the magnetic energy to the quadratic helicity,\nwhich poses a lower bound. We then introduce the quadratic helicity density\nusing the classical magnetic helicity density and its derivatives along\nmagnetic field lines. For practical purposes we also compute the flow of the\nquadratic helicity and show that for an $\\alpha^2$-dynamo setting it coincides\nwith the flow of the square of the classical helicity. We then show how the\nquadratic helicity can be extended to obtain an invariant even under\ncompressible deformations. Finally, we conclude with the numerical computation\nof $\\chi^{(2)}$ which show cases the practical usage of this higher order\ntopological invariant.\n", "  We analyse the Bell paradox from the point of view of an inertial referential\nframe and from the one of an accelerated frame. We calculate the distance\nbetween the two accelerated spaceships as it appears in each referential and we\nshow that neither of the two values represent the \"real\" length of the thread.\nCalculating this latter gives a clear understanding of the so-called paradox.\n", "  We present explicitly a relation between the Nambu-Goldstone boson and the\norder parameter in non-relativistic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nWe show that the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are characterized by transformation\nproperty of the order parameter under symmetry transformation of a system. We\ngive an explicit formula for the Nambu-Goldstone boson for a general Lie group\n$G$, and then the number of the Nambu-Goldstone boson is derived\nstraightforwardly from the symmetry of the order parameter, i.e. the type of\nsymmetry breaking. We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity is modified in the\npresence of the Nambu-Goldstone boson, where the generalized Ward-Takahashi\nidentity includes the coupling (the vertex function) between fermions and\nNambu-Goldstone bosons. The closed equation for the Green's functions of\nNambu-Goldstone bosons is derived by introducing the fermion-Nambu-Goldstone\nboson vertex function. Examples are given for $G=SU(2)$ (ferromagnetic), $U(1)$\n(superconductor) and $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking.\n", "  We present a comparison of the modal-decomposition based field solver MINERVA\nto the grid-based solver GENESIS. The modal decomposition used employs a set of\nfixed-width, zero-curvature Gaussian modes, as opposed to the more-commonly\nused basis of vacuum-diffraction eigenmodes. Besides providing the dynamical\nequations for the field modal amplitudes, we give first-principle estimates of\nthe number of modes required to achieve completeness in terms of field and\nsource modal representation as a function of the electron-current and mode\nsize. As a practical application of this new framework, we present steady-state\nnumerical results for several configurations. The numerical results show a good\nagreement between the modal expansion and the grid-based solver, not only in\nterms of the total energy produced, but also in terms of the transverse\nradiation profile.\n", "  This report summarises studies of associated production of electroweak gauge\nbosons and jets in proton-proton collisions at LHC with center of mass energy\nof 8 and 13 TeV. It is based on a selection of results published by the ATLAS\nCollaboration in the first half of 2017.\n", "  I give an overview of recent theoretical results for exclusive\nHiggs-production cross sections, focusing in particular on processes where\nprecise predictions will be relevant in the near future.\n", "  We present a density-matrix model applicable to midinfrared quantum cascade\nlasers. The model is based on a Markovian master equation for the density\nmatrix that includes in-plane dynamics, preserves positivity and does not rely\non phenomenologically introduced dephasing times. Nonparabolicity in the\nbandstructure is accounted for with a 3-band k dot p model, which includes the\nconduction, light-hole and spin-orbit split-off bands. We compare the model to\nexperimental results for QCLs based on lattice-matched as well strain-balanced\nInGaAs/InAlAs heterostructures grown on InP. We find that our density-matrix\nmodel is in quantitative agreement with experiment up to threshold and is\ncapable of reproducing results obtained using the more computationally\nexpensive nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare our\ndensity-matrix model to a semiclassical model where off-diagonal elements of\nthe density matrix are ignored. We find that the semiclassical model\noverestimates the threshold current density by 29% for a 8.5-$\\mu$m-QCL based\non a lattice-matched heterostructure and 40% for a 4.6-$\\mu$m QCL based on a\nstrain-balanced heterostructure, demonstrating the need to include off diagonal\ndensity matrix elements for accurate description of midinfrared QCLs.\n", "  The cooperative resonance for a spin one half system interacting with dc and\nac magnetic field is considered. This interaction in the system collective\nregime can result in parametic resonance and rapid excitation of the excited\nspin state of the dense atomic gas. The phenomenon is studied using the density\nmatrix approach. We discuss the implementation of this effect and possible\napplications of the quantum amplification by superradiant emission of\nradiation.\n", "  In a recent article, Banerji et al. introduced a novel quantum state of\nlight, coined as the perfect quantum optical vortex state [Phys. Rev. A 94,\n053838 (2016)] due to its mathematical similarity with the classical perfect\nvortex beam. This state is obtained by means of the Fourier transform of a\nBessel-Gaussian vortex state, and the authors claim that this can be\naccomplished by means of a simple lens. Here, we will show that this statement\nis wrong since a lens cannot modify the quantum noise distribution related to\nthe input optical quantum state and this has to be exchanged by an \"effective\nlens\".\n", "  Understanding of the role of X-rays for driving the thermal evolution of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts is one of important questions in\nastrophysics. High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in early stellar populations are\nprime X-ray source; however, their formation efficiency is not well understood.\nUsing $N$-body simulations, we estimate the HMXB formation rate via mutual\ngravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the Population~III\nstars. We find that HMXBs form at a rate of one per $\\gtrsim 10^{4}M_{\\odot}$\nin newly born stars, and that they emit with a power of $\\sim 10^{41} {\\rm\nerg}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ in the $2-10$ keV band per star formation rate (SFR). This\nvalue is a factor $\\sim 10^{2}$ larger than what is observed in star forming\ngalaxies at lower redshifts; the X-ray production from early HMXBs would have\nbeen even more copious, if they also formed \\textit{in situ} or via migration\nin protostellar disks. Combining our results with earlier studies suggests that\nearly HMXBs were highly effective at heating the IGM and leaving a strong 21 cm\nsignature. We discuss broader implications of our results, such as the rate of\nlong gamma-ray bursts from Population~III stars and the direct collapse channel\nfor massive black hole formation.\n", "  We propose a further development of a multi-pomeron exchange model of pp and\np$\\bar p$ collisions at high energy. The model describes consistently\nmultiplicity, transverse momentum of charged particles and their correlation in\nwide energy range (from ISR to LHC) by introducing string collectivity effects\nin pp collisions. The particles species differentiation is implemented\naccording to Schwinger mechanism. Due to the influence of higher resonances on\nthe yields of observed particles, we implement the production of a large set of\nhadron resonances with cascade decays. We present the results on pion, kaon and\nproton yields as a function of the collision energy and the correlation of\nstrange and multi-strange hadrons with multiplicity and compare the results\nwith experimental data.\n"]}
