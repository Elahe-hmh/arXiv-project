In this\npaper, we report the second-order assortative mixing in social networks. If two\nnodes are connected, we measure the degree correlation between their most\nprominent neighbours, rather than between the two nodes themselves. We observe\nvery strong second-order assortative mixing in social networks, often\nsignificantly stronger than the first-order assortative mixing. This suggests\nthat if two people interact in a social network, then the importance of the\nmost prominent person each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also\ntrue if we measure the average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This\nproperty is weaker or negative in non-social networks. We investigate a number\nof possible explanations for this property. However, none of them was found to\nprovide an adequate explanation. We therefore conclude that second-order\nassortative mixing is a new property of social networks.\n", "  We study nonlinear wave phenomena in coupled ring resonator optical\nwaveguides in the tight coupling regime. A discrete model for the system\ndynamics is put forward and its steady state nonlinear Bloch modes are derived.\nThe switching behavior of the transmission system is addressed numerically and\nthe results are explained in the light of this analytical result. We also\npresent a numerical study on the spontaneous generation of Bragg solitons from\na continuous-wave input.\n", "  This interpretation establishes a completely classical ontology -- only the\nclassical trajectory in configuration space -- and interprets the wave function\nas describing incomplete information (in form of a probability flow) about this\ntrajectory. This combines basic ideas of de Broglie-Bohm theory and Nelsonian\nstochastics about the trajectory with a Bayesian interpretation of the wave\nfunction.\n  Various objections are considered and discussed. In particular a regularity\nprinciple for the zeros of the wave function allows to meet the Wallstrom\nobjection.\n", "  We present observations which probe the small-scale structure of the\ninterstellar medium using diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Towards HD\n168075/6 in the Eagle Nebula, significant differences in DIB absorption are\nfound between the two lines of sight, which are separated by 0.25 pc, and\n{\\lambda}5797 exhibits a velocity shift. Similar data are presented for four\nstars in the {\\mu} Sgr system. We also present a search for variations in DIB\nabsorption towards {\\kappa} Vel, where the atomic lines are known to vary on\nscales of ~10 AU. Observations separated by ~9 yr yielded no evidence for\nchanges in DIB absorption strength over this scale, but do reveal an unusual\nDIB spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the optical absorption and scattering properties of underwater\nmedia pertinent to our underwater free space quantum key distribution (QKD)\nchannel model. With the vector radiative transfer theory and Monte Carlo\nmethod, we obtain the attenuation of photons, the fidelity of the scattered\nphotons, the quantum bit error rate and the sifted key generation rate of\nunderwater quantum communication. It can be observed from our simulations that\nthe most secure single photon underwater free space QKD is feasible in the\nclearest ocean water.\n", "  We present some analytic results aiming at explaining the lack of\nthermalization observed by Fermi Pasta and Ulam in their celebrated numerical\nexperiment. In particular we focus on results which persist as the number $N$\nof particles tends to infinity. After recalling the FPU experiment and some\nclassical heuristic ideas that have been used for its explanation, we\nconcentrate on more recent rigorous results which are based on the use of (i)\ncanonical perturbation theory and KdV equation, (ii) Toda lattice, (iii) a new\napproach based on the construction of functions which are adiabatic invariants\nwith large probability in the Gibbs measure.\n", "  According to quantum mechanics, statements about the future made by sentient\nbeings like us are, in general, neither true nor false; they must satisfy a\nmany-valued logic. I propose that the truth value of such a statement should be\nidentified with the probability that the event it describes will occur. After\nreviewing the history of related ideas in logic, I argue that it gives an\nunderstanding of probability which is particularly satisfactory for use in\nquantum mechanics. I construct a lattice of future-tense propositions, with\ntruth values in the interval $[0,1]$, and derive logical properties of these\ntruth values given by the usual quantum-mechanical formula for the probability\nof a history.\n", "  The problem `human and work' in a model working group is investigated by\nmeans of cellular automata technique. Attitude of members of a group towards\nwork is measured by an indicator of loyalty to the group (the number of agents\nwho carry out their tasks), and lack of loyalty (the number of agents, who give\ntheir tasks to other agents). Initially, all agents realize scheduled tasks\none-by-one. Agents with the number of scheduled tasks larger than a given\nthreshold change their strategy to unloyal one and start avoiding completing\ntasks by passing them to their colleagues. Optionally, in some conditions, we\nallow agents to return to loyal state; hence the rule is hysteretic. Results\nare presented on an influence of i) the density of tasks, ii) the threshold\nnumber of tasks assigned to the agents' forcing him/her for strategy change on\nthe system efficiency. We show that a `black' scenario of the system stacking\nin a `jammed phase' (with all agents preferring unloyal strategy and having\nplenty tasks scheduled for realization) may be avoided when return to loyalty\nis allowed and either i) the number of agents chosen for task realization, or\nii) the number of assigned tasks, or iii) the threshold value of assigned\ntasks, which force the agent to conversion from loyal strategy to unloyal one,\nor iv) the threshold value of tasks assigned to unloyal agent, which force\nhim/her to task redistribution among his/her neighbors, are smartly chosen.\n", "  Natural and artificial light harvesting systems often operate in a regime\nwhere the flux of photons is relatively low. Besides absorbing as many photons\nas possible it is therefore paramount to prevent excitons from annihilation via\nphoton re-emission until they have undergone an irreversible energy conversion\nprocess. Taking inspiration from photosynthetic antenna structures, we here\nconsider ring-like systems and introduce a class of states we call ratchets:\nexcited states capable of absorbing but not emitting light. This allows our\nantennae to absorb further photons whilst retaining the excitations from those\nthat have already been captured. Simulations for a ring of four sites reveal a\npeak power enhancement by up to a factor of 35 under ambient conditions owing\nto a combination of ratcheting and the prevention of emission through\ndark-state population. In the slow extraction limit the achievable power\nenhancement due to ratcheting alone exceeds 20%.\n", "  Weyl (WSMs) evolve from Dirac semimetals in the presence of broken\ntime-reversal symmetry (TRS) or space-inversion symmetry. The WSM phases in\nTaAs-class materials and photonic crystals are due to the loss of\nspace-inversion symmetry. For TRS-breaking WSMs, despite numerous theoretical\nand experimental efforts, few examples have been reported. In this Article, we\nreport a new type of magnetic semimetal Sr1-yMn1-zSb2 (y,z<0.1) with nearly\nmassless relativistic fermion behaviour (m*=0.04-0.05m0, where m0 is the free\nelectron mass). This material exhibits a ferromagnetic order for 304K < T <\n565K, but a canted antiferromagnetic order with a ferromagnetic component for T\n< 304K. The combination of relativistic fermion behaviour and ferromagnetism in\nSr1-yMn1-zSb2 offers a rare opportunity to investigate the interplay between\nrelativistic fermions and spontaneous TRS breaking.\n", "  A system of harmonic oscillators coupled via nonlinear interaction is a\nfundamental model in many branches of physics, from biophysics to electronics\nand condensed matter physics. In quantum optics, weak nonlinear interaction\nbetween light modes has enabled, for example, the preparation of squeezed\nstates of light and generation of entangled photon pairs. While strong\nnonlinear interaction between the modes has been realized in circuit QED\nsystems, achieving significant interaction strength on the level of single\nquanta in other physical systems remains a challenge. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate such interaction that is equivalent to photon up- and\ndown-conversion using normal modes of motion in a system of two Yb ions. The\nnonlinearity is induced by the intrinsic anharmonicity of the Coulomb\ninteraction between the ions and can be used to simulate fully quantum\noperation of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator. We exploit this\ninteraction to directly measure the parity and Wigner functions of ion motional\nstates. The nonlinear coupling, combined with near perfect control of internal\nand motional states of trapped ions, can be applied to quantum computing,\nquantum thermodynamics, and even shed some light on the quantum information\naspects of Hawking radiation.\n", "  I propose an understanding of Everett and Wheeler's relative-state\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, which restores the feature of\nindeterminism to the theory. This incorporates a theory of probability as truth\nvalues in a many-valued logic for future statements, and a contextual theory of\ntruth which gives objective and subjective perspectives equal validity.\n", "  Community detection is the process of grouping strongly connected nodes in a\nnetwork. Many community detection methods for un-weighted networks have a\ntheoretical basis in a null model. Communities discovered by these methods\ntherefore have interpretations in terms of statistical signficance. In this\npaper, we introduce a null for weighted networks called the continuous\nconfiguration model. We use the model both as a tool for community detection\nand for simulating weighted networks with null nodes. First, we propose a\ncommunity extraction algorithm for weighted networks which incorporates\niterative hypothesis testing under the null. We prove a central limit theorem\nfor edge-weight sums and asymptotic consistency of the algorithm under a\nweighted stochastic block model. We then incorporate the algorithm in a\ncommunity detection method called CCME. To benchmark the method, we provide a\nsimulation framework incorporating the null to plant \"background\" nodes in\nweighted networks with communities. We show that the empirical performance of\nCCME on these simulations is competitive with existing methods, particularly\nwhen overlapping communities and background nodes are present. To further\nvalidate the method, we present two real-world networks with potential\nbackground nodes and analyze them with CCME, yielding results that reveal\nmacro-features of the corresponding systems.\n", "  The hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and to the\nshift of the electromagnetic fine structure constant at the scale of Z boson\nmass are evaluated within dispersively improved perturbation theory (DPT). The\nlatter merges the corresponding perturbative input with intrinsically\nnonperturbative constraints, which originate in the respective kinematic\nrestrictions. The obtained results conform with recent assessments of the\nquantities on hand.\n", "  We derive the formal Ward identities relating pseudoscalar susceptibilities\nand quark condensates in three-flavor QCD, including consistently the\n$\\eta$-$\\eta'$ sector and the $U_A(1)$ anomaly. These identities are verified\nin the low-energy realization provided by ChPT, both in the standard $SU(3)$\nframework for the octet case and combining the use of the $U(3)$ framework and\nthe large-$N_c$ expansion of QCD to account properly for the nonet sector and\nanomalous contributions. The analysis is performed including finite temperature\ncorrections as well as the calculation of $U(3)$ quark condensates and all\npseudoscalar susceptibilities, which together with the full set of Ward\nidentities, are new results of this work. Finally, the Ward identities are used\nto derive scaling relations for pseudoscalar masses, which explain the behavior\nwith temperature of lattice screening masses near chiral symmetry restoration.\n", "  We explore a general diagrammatic framework to understand qudits and their\nbraiding, especially in its relation to entanglement. This involves\nunderstanding the role of isotopy in interpreting diagrams that implement\nentangling gates as well as some standard quantum information protocols. We\ngive qudit Pauli operators $X,Y,Z$ and comment on their structure, both from an\nalgebraic and from a diagrammatic point of view. We explain alternative models\nfor diagrammatic interpretations of qudits and their transformations. We use\nour diagrammatic approach to define an entanglement-relay protocol for\nlong-distance entanglement. Our approach rests on algebraic and topological\nrelations discovered in the study of planar para algebras. In summary, this\nwork provides bridges between the new theory of planar para algebras and\nquantum information, especially in questions involving entanglement.\n", "  We study the structure of relativistic stars in $\\mathcal{R}+\\alpha\n\\mathcal{R}^{2}$ theory using the method of matched asymptotic expansion to\nhandle the higher order derivatives in field equations arising from the higher\norder curvature term. We find solutions, parametrized by $\\alpha$, for uniform\ndensity stars. We obtain the mass-radius relations and study the dependence of\nmaximum mass on $\\alpha$. We find that $M_{\\max}$ is almost linearly\nproportional to $\\alpha$. For each $\\alpha$ the maximum mass configuration has\nthe biggest compactness parameter ($\\eta = GM/Rc^2$), and we argue that the\ngeneral relativistic stellar configuration corresponding to $\\alpha=0$ is the\nleast compact among these.\n", "  A common problem in physics and engineering is determination of the\norientation of an object given its angular velocity. When the direction of the\nangular velocity changes in time, this is a nontrivial problem involving\ncoupled differential equations. Several possible approaches are examined, along\nwith various improvements over previous efforts. These are then evaluated\nnumerically by comparison to a complicated but analytically known rotation that\nis motivated by the important astrophysical problem of precessing black-hole\nbinaries. It is shown that a straightforward solution directly using\nquaternions is most efficient and accurate, and that the norm of the quaternion\nis irrelevant. Integration of the generator of the rotation can also be made\nroughly as efficient as integration of the rotation. Both methods will\ntypically be twice as efficient as naive vector- or matrix-based methods.\nImplementation by means of standard general-purpose numerical integrators is\nstable and efficient, so that such problems can be readily solved as part of a\nlarger system of differential equations. Possible generalization to integration\nin other Lie groups is also discussed.\n", "  In a previous paper we introduced holographic software for quantum networks,\ninspired by work on planar para algebras. This software suggests the definition\nof a compressed transformation. Here we utilize the software to find a CT\nprotocol to teleport compressed transformations. This protocol serves multiple\nparties with multiple persons.\n", "  An account of determinism and indeterminism in physics, addressed to\nnon-physicist readers, leading up to proposals for how to understand statements\nabout the future and single-event probability, motivated by quantum mechanics.\n", "  The electronic structure of WTe$_2$ and orthorhombic $\\gamma-$MoTe$_2$, are\nclaimed to contain pairs of Weyl type-II points. A series of ARPES experiments\nclaim a broad agreement with these predictions. We synthesized single-crystals\nof MoTe$_2$ through a Te flux method to validate these predictions through\nmeasurements of its bulk Fermi surface (FS) \\emph{via} quantum oscillatory\nphenomena. We find that the superconducting transition temperature of\n$\\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ depends on disorder as quantified by the ratio between the\nroom- and low-temperature resistivities, suggesting the possibility of an\nunconventional superconducting pairing symmetry. Similarly to WTe$_2$, the\nmagnetoresistivity of $\\gamma-$MoTe$_2$ does not saturate at high magnetic\nfields and can easily surpass $10^{6}$ \\%. Remarkably, the analysis of the de\nHaas-van Alphen (dHvA) signal superimposed onto the magnetic torque, indicates\nthat the geometry of its FS is markedly distinct from the calculated one. The\ndHvA signal also reveals that the FS is affected by the Zeeman-effect\nprecluding the extraction of the Berry-phase. A direct comparison between the\nprevious ARPES studies and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations reveals\na disagreement in the position of the valence bands relative to the Fermi level\n$\\varepsilon_F$. Here, we show that a shift of the DFT valence bands relative\nto $\\varepsilon_F$, in order to match the ARPES observations, and of the DFT\nelectron bands to explain some of the observed dHvA frequencies, leads to a\ngood agreement between the calculations and the angular dependence of the FS\ncross-sectional areas observed experimentally. However, this relative\ndisplacement between electron- and hole-bands eliminates their crossings and,\ntherefore, the Weyl type-II points predicted for $\\gamma-$MoTe$_2$.\n", "  Continuing the quest for exclusive Racah matrices, which are needed for\nevaluation of colored arborescent-knot polynomials in Chern-Simons theory, we\nsuggest to extract them from a new kind of a double-evolution -- that of the\nantiparallel double-braids, which is a simple two-parametric family of\ntwo-bridge knots, generalizing the one-parametric family of twist knots. In the\ncase of rectangular representations $R=[r^s]$ we found an evidence that the\ncorresponding differential expansion miraculously factorizes and can be\nobtained from that for the twist knots. This reduces the problem of rectangular\nexclusive Racah to constructing the answers for just a few twist knots. We\ndevelop a recent conjecture on the structure of differential expansion for the\nsimplest members of this family (the trefoil and the figure-eight knot) and\nprovide the exhaustive answer for the first unknown case of $R=[33]$. The\nanswer includes HOMFLY of arbitrary twist and double-braid knots and Racah\nmatrices $\\bar S$ and $S$ -- what allows to calculate $[33]$-colored\npolynomials for arbitrary arborescent (double-fat) knots. For generic\nrectangular representations described in detail are only the contributions of\nthe single- and two-floor pyramids, the way to proceed is explicitly\nillustrated by the examples of $R=[44]$ and $R=[55]$. This solves the difficult\npart of the problem, but the last tedious step towards explicit formulas for\ngeneric exclusive rectangular Racah matrices still remains to be made.\n", "  We derive a generic formalism for studying the energy conversion processes in\nbounded metals. Using this formalism we show that in the collision-less limit\nthe Fermi sea of metals should experience an instability against surface plasma\noscillations, which opens for the latter an intrinsic self-ampli cation\nchannel. The origin of the instability is clari ed as arising from novel\neffects resulting from the translation symetry breaking due to the very\npresence of surface. The ampli cation rate of this channel is analytically\nevaluated on the basis of energy conservation and the effects of losses are\ndiscussed. In particular, the unique role played by the surface in energy\nconversion is unveiled. In contrast with common wisdom and in line with\nobservations, Landau damping is shown as always overcompensated and therefore\nposes no serious issues in sub-wavelength plasmonics.\n", "  We study the effects of a vertical electric field on the electronic band\nstructure and transport in multilayer phosphorene and its nanoribbons. In\nphosphorene, at a critical value of the vertical electric field ($E_c$), the\nband gap closes and the band structure undergoes a massive-to-massless Dirac\nfermion transition along the armchair direction. This transition is observable\nin quantum Hall measurements, as the power-law dependence of the Landau-level\nenergy on the magnetic field $B$ goes from $\\sim (n+1/2)B$ below $E_c$, to\n$\\sim [(n+1/2)B]^{2/3}$ at $E_c$, to $\\sim [(n+1/2)B]^{1/2}$ above $E_c$. In\nmultilayer phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), the vertical electric field can be\nemployed to manipulate the midgap energy bands that are associated with edge\nstates, thereby giving rise to new device functionalities. We propose a\ndual-edge-gate PNR structure that works as a quantum switch.\n", "  Shale, like many other sedimentary rocks, is typically heterogeneous,\nanisotropic, and is characterized by partial alignment of anisotropic clay\nminerals and naturally formed bedding planes. In this study, a micromechanical\nframework based on the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) is formulated to\ncapture these features. Material anisotropy is introduced through an\napproximated geometric description of shale internal structure, which includes\nrepresentation of material property variation with orientation and explicit\nmodeling of parallel lamination. The model is calibrated by carrying out\nnumerical simulations to match various experimental data, including the ones\nrelevant to elastic properties, Brazilian tensile strength, and unconfined\ncompressive strength. Furthermore, parametric study is performed to investigate\nthe relationship between the mesoscale parameters and the macroscopic\nproperties. It is shown that the dependence of the elastic stiffness, strength,\nand failure mode on loading orientation can be captured successfully. Finally,\na homogenization approach based on the asymptotic expansion of field variables\nis applied to upscale the proposed micromechanical model, and the properties of\nthe homogenized model are analyzed.\n", "  We consider the generic quantum superintegrable system on the $d$-sphere with\npotential $V(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^{d+1}\\frac{b_k}{y_k^2}$, where $b_k$ are parameters.\nAppropriately normalized, the symmetry operators for the Hamiltonian define a\nrepresentation of the Kohno-Drinfeld Lie algebra on the space of polynomials\northogonal with respect to the Dirichlet distribution. The Gaudin subalgebras\ngenerated by Jucys-Murphy elements are diagonalized by families of Jacobi\npolynomials in $d$ variables on the simplex. We define a set of generators for\nthe symmetry algebra and we prove that their action on the Jacobi polynomials\nis represented by the multivariable Racah operators introduced in\narXiv:0705.1469. The constructions also yield a new Lie-theoretic\ninterpretation of the bispectral property for Tratnik's multivariable Racah\npolynomials.\n", "  Frauchiger and Renner have recently claimed to prove that \"Single-world\ninterpretations of quantum theory cannot be self-consistent\". This is\ncontradicted by a construction due to Bell, inspired by Bohmian mechanics,\nwhich shows that any quantum system can be modelled in such a way that there is\nonly one \"world\" at any time, but the predictions of quantum theory are\nreproduced. This Bell-Bohmian theory is applied to the experiment proposed by\nFrauchiger and Renner, and their argument is critically examined. It is\nconcluded that it is their version of \"standard quantum theory\", incorporating\nstate vector collapse upon measurement, that is not self-consistent.\n", "  Quantum hypothesis testing is one of the most basic tasks in quantum\ninformation theory and has fundamental links with quantum communication and\nestimation theory. In this paper, we establish a formula that characterizes the\ndecay rate of the minimal Type-II error probability in a quantum hypothesis\ntest of two Gaussian states given a fixed constraint on the Type-I error\nprobability. This formula is a direct function of the mean vectors and\ncovariance matrices of the quantum Gaussian states in question. We give an\napplication to quantum illumination, which is the task of determining whether\nthere is a low-reflectivity object embedded in a target region with a bright\nthermal-noise bath. For the asymmetric-error setting, we find that a quantum\nillumination transmitter can achieve an error probability exponent stronger\nthan a coherent-state transmitter of the same mean photon number, and\nfurthermore, that it requires far fewer trials to do so. This occurs when the\nbackground thermal noise is either low or bright, which means that a quantum\nadvantage is even easier to witness than in the symmetric-error setting because\nit occurs for a larger range of parameters. Going forward from here, we expect\nour formula to have applications in settings well beyond those considered in\nthis paper, especially to quantum communication tasks involving quantum\nGaussian channels.\n", "  The superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor nanowires has recently\nenabled the study of new superconducting architectures, such as gate-tunable\nsuperconducting qubits and multiterminal Josephson junctions. As opposed to\ntheir metallic counterparts, the electron density in semiconductor nanosystems\nis tunable by external electrostatic gates providing a highly scalable and\nin-situ variation of the device properties. In addition, semiconductors with\nlarge $g$-factor and spin-orbit coupling have been shown to give rise to exotic\nphenomena in superconductivity, such as $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junctions and the\nemergence of Majorana bound states. Here, we report microwave spectroscopy\nmeasurements that directly reveal the presence of Andreev bound states (ABS) in\nballistic semiconductor channels. We show that the measured ABS spectra are the\nresult of transport channels with gate-tunable, high transmission probabilities\nup to $0.9$, which is required for gate-tunable Andreev qubits and beneficial\nfor braiding schemes of Majorana states. For the first time, we detect\nexcitations of a spin-split pair of ABS and observe symmetry-broken ABS, a\ndirect consequence of the spin-orbit coupling in the semiconductor.\n", "  The nature of the scalar field responsible for the cosmological inflation,\nthe \\qo{inflaton}, is found to be rooted in the most fundamental concept of the\nWeyl's differential geometry: the parallel displacement of vectors in curved\nspace-time. The Euler-Lagrange theory based on a scalar-tensor Weyl-Dirac\nLagrangian leads straightforwardly to the Einstein equation admitting as a\nsource the characteristic energy-momentum tensor of the inflaton field. Within\nthe dynamics of the inflation, e.g. in the slow roll transition from a\n\\qo{false} toward a \\qo{true vacuum}, the inflaton's geometry implies a\ntemperature driven symmetry change between a highly symmetrical \\qo{Weylan} to\na low symmetry \\qo{Riemannian} scenario. Since the dynamics of the Weyl\ncurvature scalar, constructed over differentials of the inflaton field, has\nbeen found to account for the quantum phenomenology at the microscopic scale,\nthe present work suggests interesting connections between the \\qo{micro} and\nthe \\qo{macro} aspects of our Universe.\n", "  When the Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_L$ in a quantum chaotic system saturates\nthe bound $\\lambda_L\\leqslant 2\\pi k_BT$, it is proposed that this system has a\nholographic dual described by a gravity theory. In particular, the butterfly\neffect as a prominent phenomenon of chaos can ubiquitously exist in a black\nhole system characterized by a shockwave solution near the horizon. In this\npaper we propose that the butterfly velocity can be used to diagnose quantum\nphase transition (QPT) in holographic theories. We provide evidences for this\nproposal with an anisotropic holographic model exhibiting metal-insulator\ntransitions (MIT), in which the derivatives of the butterfly velocity with\nrespect to system parameters characterizes quantum critical points (QCP) with\nlocal extremes in zero temperature limit. We also point out that this proposal\ncan be tested by experiments in the light of recent progress on the measurement\nof out-of-time-order correlation function (OTOC).\n", "  We realize the 16 unbroken supersymmetries on a BPS D-brane as invariances of\nthe action of the corresponding open superstring field theory. We work in the\nsmall Hilbert space approach, where a symmetry of the action translates into a\nsymmetry of the associated cyclic $A_\\infty$ structure. We compute the\nsupersymmetry algebra, being careful to disentangle the components which\nproduce a translation, a gauge transformation, and a symmetry transformation\nwhich vanishes on-shell. Via the minimal model theorem, we illustrate how\nsupersymmetry of the action implies supersymmetry of the tree level open string\nscattering amplitudes.\n", "  We propose a new numerical scheme of evolution for the Einstein equations\nusing the discrete variational derivative method (DVDM). We derive the discrete\nevolution equation of the constraint using this scheme and show the constraint\npreserves in the discrete level. In addition, to confirm the numerical\nstability using this scheme, we perform some numerical simulations by\ndiscretized equations with the Crank-Nicolson scheme and with the new scheme,\nand we find that the new discretized equations have better stability than that\nof the Crank-Nicolson scheme.\n", "  Decomposing an arbitrary electron energy distribution into sums of Maxwellian\nand power law components is an efficient method to calculate synchrotron\nemission and absorption. We use this method to study the effect of non-thermal\nelectrons on submm images and spectra of the Galactic center black hole, Sgr\nA*. We assume a spatially uniform functional form for the electron distribution\nfunction and use a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow and a\n2D general relativistic MHD snapshot as example models of the underlying\naccretion flow structure. We develop simple analytic models which allow us to\ngeneralize from the numerical examples. A high energy electron component\ncontaining a small fraction (few per cent) of the total internal energy (e.g. a\n\"power law tail\") can produce a diffuse halo of emission, which modifies the\nobserved image size and structure. A population of hot electrons with a larger\nenergy fraction (e.g. resulting from a diffusion in electron energy space) can\ndominate the emission, so that the observed images and spectra are well\napproximated by considering only a single thermal component for a suitable\nchoice of the electron temperature. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for estimating accretion flow or black hole parameters from images and\nspectra, and for the identification of the black hole \"shadow\" in future\nmm-VLBI data. In particular, the location of the first minimum in visibility\nprofiles does not necessarily correspond to the shadow size as sometimes\nassumed.\n", "  The goal of this work is to elaborate on new geometric methods of\nconstructing exact and parametric quasiperiodic solutions for anamorphic\ncosmology models in modified gravity theories, MGTs, and general relativity,\nGR. There exist previously studied generic off-diagonal and diagonalizable\ncosmological metrics encoding gravitational and matter fields with quasicrystal\nlike structures, QC, and holonomy corrections from loop quantum gravity, LQG.\nWe apply the anholonomic frame deformation method, AFDM, in order to decouple\nthe (modified) gravitational and matter field equations in general form. This\nallows us to find integral varieties of cosmological solutions determined by\ngenerating functions, effective sources, integration functions and constants.\nThe coefficients of metrics and connections for such cosmological\nconfigurations depend, in general, on all spacetime coordinates and can be\nchosen to generate observable (quasi)-periodic/ aperiodic/ fractal / stochastic\n/ (super) cluster / filament / polymer like (continuous, stochastic, fractal\nand/or discrete structures) in MGTs and/or GR. In this work, we study new\nclasses of solutions for anamorphic cosmology with LQG holonomy corrections.\nSuch solutions are characterized by nonlinear symmetries of generating\nfunctions for generic off--diagonal cosmological metrics and generalized\nconnections, with possible nonholonomic constraints to Levi-Civita\nconfigurations and diagonalizable metrics depending only on a time like\ncoordinate. We argue that anamorphic quasiperiodic cosmological models\nintegrate the concept of quantum discrete spacetime, with certain gravitational\nQC-like vacuum and nonvacuum structures. And, that of a contracting universe\nthat homogenizes, isotropizes and flattens without introducing initial\nconditions or multiverse problems.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical behavior of rings around bodies whose shapes\ndepart considerably from that of a sphere. To this end, we have developed a new\nself-gravitating discrete element N-body code, and employed a local simulation\nmethod to simulate a patch of the ring. The central body is modeled as a\nsymmetric (oblate or prolate) ellipsoid, or defined through the characteristic\nfrequencies (circular, vertical, epicyclic) that represent its gravitational\nfield. Through our simulations we explore how a ring's behavior --\ncharacterized by dynamical properties like impact frequency, granular\ntemperature, number density, vertical thickness and radial width -- varies with\nthe changing gravitational potential of the central body. We also contrast\nproperties of rings about large central bodies (e.g. Saturn) with those of\nsmaller ones (e.g. Chariklo). Finally, we investigate how the characteristic\nfrequencies of a central body, restricted to being a solid of revolution with\nan equatorial plane of symmetry, affect the ring dynamics. The latter process\nmay be employed to qualitatively understand the dynamics of rings about any\nsymmetric solids of revolution.\n", "  The existing methods for measuring the orbital-angular-momentum (OAM)\nspectrum suffer from issues such as poor efficiency, strict interferometric\nstability requirements, and too much loss. Furthermore, most techniques\ninevitably discard part of the field and measure only a post-selected portion\nof the true spectrum. Here, we propose and demonstrate an interferometric\ntechnique for measuring the true OAM spectrum of optical fields in a\nsingle-shot manner. Our technique directly encodes the OAM-spectrum information\nin the azimuthal intensity profile of the output interferogram. In the absence\nof noise, the spectrum can be fully decoded using a single acquisition of the\noutput interferogram, and, in the presence of noise, acquisition of two\nsuitable interferograms is sufficient for the purpose. As an important\napplication of our technique, we demonstrate measurements of the angular\nSchmidt spectrum of the entangled photons produced by parametric\ndown-conversion and report a broad spectrum with the angular Schmidt number\n82.1.\n", "  We propose a quantum machine learning algorithm for efficiently solving a\nclass of problems encoded in quantum controlled unitary operations. The central\nphysical mechanism of the protocol is the iteration of a quantum time-delayed\nequation that introduces feedback in the dynamics and eliminates the necessity\nof intermediate measurements. The performance of the quantum algorithm is\nanalyzed by comparing the results obtained in numerical simulations with the\noutcome of classical machine learning methods for the same problem. The use of\ntime-delayed equations enhances the toolbox of the field of quantum machine\nlearning, which may enable unprecedented applications in quantum technologies.\n", "  In [Gallego and Aolita, Physical Review X 5, 041008 (2015)], the authors\nproposed a definition for the relative entropy of steering and showed that the\nresulting quantity is a convex steering monotone. Here we advocate for a\ndifferent definition for relative entropy of steering, based on well grounded\nconcerns coming from quantum Shannon theory. We prove that this modified\nrelative entropy of steering is a convex steering monotone. Furthermore, we\nestablish that it is uniformly continuous and faithful, in both cases giving\nquantitative bounds that should be useful in applications. We also consider a\nrestricted relative entropy of steering which is relevant for the case in which\nthe free operations in the resource theory of steering have a more restricted\nform (the restricted operations could be more relevant in practical scenarios).\nThe restricted relative entropy of steering is convex, monotone with respect to\nthese restricted operations, uniformly continuous, and faithful.\n", "  A search is presented for decays beyond the standard model of the 125 GeV\nHiggs bosons to a pair of light bosons, based on models with extended scalar\nsectors. Light boson masses between 5 and 62.5 GeV are probed in final states\ncontaining four tau leptons, two muons and two b quarks, or two muons and two\ntau leptons. The results are from data in proton-proton collisions\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns,\naccumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8\nTeV. No evidence for such exotic decays is found in the data. Upper limits are\nset on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for several\nsignal processes. The results are also compared to predictions of\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models, including those with an additional scalar singlet.\n", "  We study multi-matrix models which may be viewed as integrals of products of\ntau functions which depend on the eigenvalues of products of random matrices.\nIn the present paper we consider tau functions of the hierarchy the\ntwo-component KP (semiinfinite relativistic Toda lattice) and of hierarchy of\nthe BKP introduced by Kac and van de Leur. Sometimes such integrals are tau\nfunctions themselves. We consider models which generate Hurwitz numbers\n$H^{e},f$, where $e$ is the Euler characteristic of the base surface and $f$ is\nthe number of branch points. We show that in case the integrands contains the\nproduct of $n > 2$ matrices the integral generates Hurwitz numbers with $e\\le\n2$ and $f\\le n+2$, both numbers $e$ and $f$ depend both on $n$ and on the order\nof the multipliers in the matrix product. The Euler characteristic $ e $ can be\neither an even or an odd number, that is, match both orientable and\nnonorientable (Klein) base surfaces, depending on the presence of the tau\nfunction of the BKP hierarchy in the integrand. We study two cases: the\nproducts of complex and the products of unitary matrices.\n", "  The classical theory of enzymatic inhibition aims to quantitatively describe\nthe effect of certain molecules -- called inhibitors -- on the progression of\nenzymatic reactions, but growing signs indicate that it must be revised to keep\npace with the single-molecule revolution that is sweeping through the sciences.\nHere, we take the single enzyme perspective and rebuild the theory of enzymatic\ninhibition from the bottom up. We find that accounting for multi-conformational\nenzyme structure and intrinsic randomness cannot undermine the validity of\nclassical results in the case of competitive inhibition; but that it should\nstrongly change our view on the uncompetitive and mixed modes of inhibition.\nThere, stochastic fluctuations on the single-enzyme level could give rise to\ninhibitor-activator duality -- a phenomenon in which, under some conditions,\nthe introduction of a molecule whose binding shuts down enzymatic catalysis\nwill counter intuitively work to facilitate product formation. We state -- in\nterms of experimentally measurable quantities -- a mathematical condition for\nthe emergence of inhibitor-activator duality, and propose that it could explain\nwhy certain molecules that act as inhibitors when substrate concentrations are\nhigh elicit a non-monotonic dose response when substrate concentrations are\nlow. The fundamental and practical implications of our findings are thoroughly\ndiscussed.\n", "  A Markov decision process (MDP) framework is adopted to represent ensemble\ncontrol of devices with cyclic energy consumption patterns, e.g.,\nthermostatically controlled loads. Specifically we utilize and develop the\nclass of MDP models previously coined linearly solvable MDPs, that describe\noptimal dynamics of the probability distribution of an ensemble of many cycling\ndevices. Two principally different settings are discussed. First, we consider\noptimal strategy of the ensemble aggregator balancing between minimization of\nthe cost of operations and minimization of the ensemble welfare penalty, where\nthe latter is represented as a KL-divergence between actual and normal\nprobability distributions of the ensemble. Then, second, we shift to the demand\nresponse setting modeling the aggregator's task to minimize the welfare penalty\nunder the condition that the aggregated consumption matches the targeted\ntime-varying consumption requested by the system operator. We discuss a\nmodification of both settings aimed at encouraging or constraining the\ntransitions between different states. The dynamic programming feature of the\nresulting modified MDPs is always preserved; however, `linear solvability' is\nlost fully or partially, depending on the type of modification. We also\nconducted some (limited in scope) numerical experimentation using the\nformulations of the first setting. We conclude by discussing future\ngeneralizations and applications.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a key resource in quantum information processing\nscenarios, and quantifying coherence is an important task for both quantum\nfoundation and quantum technology. However, until now, all most of coherence\nmeasures are basis-dependent that does not accord with physical reality, since\nthe physical properties of the physical system should not be changed with the\ndifferent choice of coordinate systems. Here, we propose an \\textit{intrinsic\nbasis-independent quantum coherence measure} which satisfies all conditions for\nquantifying coherence. This measurement not only reveals physical essence of\nquantum coherence of the quantum state itself clearly, but also simplifies the\nmeasurement procedure by avoiding the optimization procedure of distance\nmeasure.\n", "  We discuss a quantum transition from a superfluid to a Mott glass phases in\ndisordered Bose-systems by the example of an isotropic spin-$\\frac12$\nantiferromagnet with spatial dimension $d\\ge2$ and with disorder in tunable\nexchange couplings. Our analytical consideration is based on general properties\nof a system in critical regime, on the assumption that the magnetically order\npart of the system shows fractal properties near the transition, and on a\nhydrodynamic description of long-wavelength magnons in the magnetically ordered\n(\"superfluide\") phase. Our results are fully consistent with a scaling theory\nbased on an ansatz for the free energy proposed by M.P. Fisher et al. (Phys.\nRev. B 40, 546 (1989)). We obtain $z=d-\\beta/\\nu$ for the dynamical critical\nexponent and $\\phi = z\\nu$, where $\\phi$, $\\beta$, and $\\nu$ are critical\nexponents of the critical temperature, the order parameter, and the correlation\nlength, respectively. The density of states of localized excitations (fractons)\nis found to show a superuniversal (i.e., independent of $d$) behavior.\n", "  We propose to implement a new kind of solid-state single-photon source based\non the recently observed Rydberg blockade effect for excitons in cuprous oxide.\nThe strong interaction between excitons in levels with high principal quantum\nnumbers prevents the creation of more than one exciton in a small crystal. The\nresulting effective two-level system is a good single-photon source. Our\nquantitative estimates suggest that GHz rates and values of the second-order\ncorrelation function $g_2(0)$ below the percent level should be simultaneously\nachievable.\n", "  In the early Universe finding massive galaxies that have stopped forming\nstars present an observational challenge as their rest-frame ultraviolet\nemission is negligible and they can only be reliably identified by extremely\ndeep near-infrared surveys. These have revealed the presence of massive,\nquiescent early-type galaxies appearing in the universe as early as z$\\sim$2,\nan epoch 3 Gyr after the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have now\nbeen explained by an improved generation of galaxy formation models where they\nform rapidly at z$\\sim$3-4, consistent with the typical masses and ages derived\nfrom their observations. Deeper surveys have now reported evidence for\npopulations of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier\ntimes, however the evidence for their existence, and redshift, has relied\nentirely on coarsely sampled photometry. These early massive, quiescent\ngalaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models.\nHere, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at\nredshift z=3.717 with a stellar mass of 1.7$\\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ whose\nabsorption line spectrum shows no current star-formation and which has a\nderived age of nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift. The\nobservations demonstrates that the galaxy must have quickly formed the majority\nof its stars within the first billion years of cosmic history in an extreme and\nshort starburst. This ancestral event is similar to those starting to be found\nby sub-mm wavelength surveys pointing to a possible connection between these\ntwo populations. Early formation of such massive systems is likely to require\nsignificant revisions to our picture of early galaxy assembly.\n", "  We present a study of the effects of collisional dynamics on the formation\nand detectability of cold tidal streams. A semi-analytical model for the\nevolution of the stellar mass function was implemented and coupled to a fast\nstellar stream simulation code, as well as the synthetic cluster evolution code\nEMACSS for the mass evolution as a function of a globular cluster orbit. We\nfind that the increase in the average mass of the escaping stars for clusters\nclose to dissolution has a major effect on the observable stream surface\ndensity. As an example, we show that Palomar 5 would have undetectable streams\n(in an SDSS-like survey) if it was currently three times more massive, despite\nthe fact that a more massive cluster loses stars at a higher rate. This bias\ndue to the preferential escape of low-mass stars is an alternative explanation\nfor the absence of tails near massive clusters, than a dark matter halo\nassociated with the cluster. We explore the orbits of a large sample of Milky\nWay globular clusters and derive their initial masses and remaining mass\nfraction. Using properties of known tidal tails we explore regions of parameter\nspace that favour the detectability of a stream. A list of high probability\ncandidates is discussed\n", "  We measured the Josephson radiation emitted by an InSb semiconductor nanowire\njunction utilizing photon assisted quasiparticle tunneling in an AC-coupled\nsuperconducting tunnel junction. We quantify the action of the local microwave\nenvironment by evaluating the frequency dependence of the inelastic Cooper-pair\ntunneling of the nanowire junction and find the zero frequency impedance\n$Z(0)=492\\,\\Omega$ with a cutoff frequency of $f_0=33.1\\,$GHz. We extract a\ncircuit coupling efficiency of $\\eta\\approx 0.1$ and a detector quantum\nefficiency approaching unity in the high frequency limit. In addition to the\nJosephson radiation, we identify a shot-noise contribution with a Fano factor\n$F\\approx1$, consistently with the presence of single electron states in the\nnanowire channel.\n", "  In three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), the nontrivial topology in\ntheir electronic bands casts a gapless state on their solid surfaces, using\nwhich dissipationless TI edge devices based on the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)\neffect and quantum Hall (QH) effect have been demonstrated. Practical TI\ndevices present a pair of parallel-transport topological surface states (TSSs)\non their top and bottom surfaces. However, due to the no-go theorem, the two\nTSSs always appear as a pair and are expected to quantize synchronously.\nQuantized transport of a separate Dirac channel is still desirable, but has\nnever been observed in graphene even after intense investigation over a period\nof 13 years, with the potential aim of half-QHE. By depositing Co atomic\nclusters, we achieved stepwise quantization of the top and bottom surfaces in\nBiSbTeSe2 (BSTS) TI devices. Renormalization group flow diagrams13, 22 (RGFDs)\nreveal two sets of converging points (CVPs) in the (Gxy, Gxx) space, where the\ntop surface travels along an anomalous quantization trajectory while the bottom\nsurface retains 1/2 e2/h. This results from delayed Landau-level (LL)\nhybridization (DLLH) due to coupling between Co clusters and TSS Fermions.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the dynamical analysis to a coupled phantom field\nwith scaling potential taking particular forms of the coupling (linear and\ncombination of linear), and present phase space analysis. We investigate if\nthere exist late time accelerated scaling attractor that has the ratio of dark\nenergy and dark matter densities of the order one. We observe that the\nscrutinized couplings cannot alleviate the coincidence problem, however acquire\nstable late time accelerated solutions. We also discuss coupled tachyon field\nwith inverse square potential assuming linear coupling.\n", "  New monodromy relations of loop amplitudes are derived in open string theory.\nWe particularly study N-point one-loop amplitudes described by a world-sheet\ncylinder (planar and non-planar) and derive a set of relations between\nsubamplitudes of different color orderings. Various consistency checks are\nperformed by matching alpha'-expansions of planar and non-planar amplitudes\ninvolving elliptic iterated integrals with the resulting periods giving rise to\ntwo sets of multiple elliptic zeta values. The latter refer to the two homology\ncycles on the once-punctured complex elliptic curve and the monodromy equations\nprovide relations between these two sets of multiple elliptic zeta values.\nFurthermore, our monodromy relations involve new objects for which we present a\ntentative interpretation in terms of open string scattering amplitudes in the\npresence of a non-trivial gauge field flux. Finally, we provide an outlook on\nhow to generalize the new monodromy relations to the non-oriented case and\nbeyond the one-loop level. Comparing a subset of our results with recent\nfindings in the literature we find therein several serious issues related to\nthe structure and significance of monodromy phases and the relevance of missed\ncontributions from contour integrations.\n", "  The established spin splitting in monolayer (ML) of transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) that is caused by inversion symmetry breaking is\ndictated by mirror symmetry operations to exhibit fully out-of-plane direction\nof spin polarization. Through first-principles density functional theory\ncalculations, we show that polarity-induced mirror symmetry breaking leads to\nnew sizable spin splitting having in-plane spin polarization. These splittings\nare effectively controlled by tuning the polarity using biaxial strain.\nFurthermore, the admixtures of the out-of-plane and in-plane spin-polarized\nstates in the strained polar systems are identified, which is expected to\ninfluence the spin relaxation through the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. Our study\nclarified that the polarity-induced mirror symmetry breaking plays an important\nrole in controlling the spin splitting and spin relaxation in the TMDs ML,\nwhich is useful for designing future spintronic devices.\n", "  The SYK model, a quantum mechanical model of $N \\gg 1$ Majorana fermions\n$\\chi_i$, with a $q$-body, random interaction, is a novel realization of\nholography. It is known that the AdS$_2$ dual contains a tower of massive\nparticles, yet there is at present no proposal for the bulk theory. As SYK is\nsolvable in the $1/N$ expansion, one can systematically derive the bulk. We\ninitiate such a program, by analyzing the fermion two, four and six-point\nfunctions, from which we extract the tower of singlet, large $N$ dominant,\noperators, their dimensions, and their three-point correlation functions. These\ndetermine the masses of the bulk fields and their cubic couplings. We present\nthese couplings, analyze their structure and discuss the simplifications that\narise for large $q$.\n", "  The identification of the crystalline axis of anisotropic black phosphorus\n(BP) is key for the study of its physical properties and for its optical and\nelectronic applications. Herein, we show that by applying an in-plane uniaxial\nstrain and measuring the changes of Raman shifts, the crystalline axis of BP\ncan be reliably determined. The strain effects on Raman shifts are\nangle-dependent, which can be expressed as a combination of Raman responses\nunder zigzag and armchair strains. Different from previous polarized optical\nspectroscopic means, the proposed method does not rely on the laser\npolarization, the excitation wavelength, the sample thickness and the material\nof the stretchable substrate. Besides, the effective strain applied on BP from\nthe stretched substrate is estimated, showing that only 20% to 40% of the\nstrain can be effectively transferred to BP flakes from polyethylene\nterephthalate substrates. Our method provides not only an effective and\nuniversal approach to identify the crystalline orientation of layered BP, but\nalso a model to extract additional information in strain-related studies, and\ncan be extended to other 2D anisotropic materials.\n", "  We propose a superconducting spin-triplet valve, which consists of a\nsuperconductor and an itinerant magnetic material, with the magnet showing an\nintrinsic non-collinear order characterized by a wave vector that may be\naligned in a few equivalent preferred directions under control of a weak\nexternal magnetic field. Re-orienting the spiral direction allows one to\ncontrollably modify long-range spin-triplet superconducting correlations,\nleading to spin-valve switching behavior. Our results indicate that the\nspin-valve effect may be noticeable. This bilayer may be used as a magnetic\nmemory element for cryogenic nanoelectronics. It has the following advantages\nin comparison to superconducting spin valves proposed previously: (i) it\ncontains only one magnetic layer, which may be more easily fabricated and\ncontrolled, (ii) its ground states are separated by a potential barrier, which\nsolves the \"half-select\" problem of the addressed switch of memory elements.\n", "  We study the dynamics of thermalization following a quantum quench using\ntensor-network methods. Contrary to the common belief that the rapid growth of\nentanglement and the resulting exponential growth of the bond dimension\nrestricts simulations to short times, we demonstrate that the long time limit\nof local observables can be well captured using the time-dependent variational\nprinciple. This allows to extract transport coefficients such as the energy\ndiffusion constant from simulations with rather small bond dimensions. We\nfurther study the characteristic of the chaotic wave that precedes the\nemergence of hydrodynamics, to find a ballistic diffusively-broadening\nwave-front.\n", "  In this paper, we study properties of the algebras of planar\nquasi-invariants. These algebras are Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein in\ncodimension one. Using the technique of matrix problems, we classify all\nCohen-Macaulay modules of rank one over them and determine their Picard groups.\nIn terms of this classification, we describe the spectral modules of the planar\nrational Calogero-Moser systems. Finally, we elaborate the theory of the\nalgebraic inverse scattering method, computing a new unexpected explicit\nexample of a deformed Calogero-Moser system.\n", "  Quantum theory predicts that entanglement can also persist in macroscopic\nphysical systems, albeit difficulties to demonstrate it experimentally remain.\nRecently, significant progress has been achieved and genuine entanglement\nbetween up to 2900 atoms was reported. Here we demonstrate 16 million genuinely\nentangled atoms in a solid-state quantum memory prepared by the heralded\nabsorption of a single photon. We develop an entanglement witness for\nquantifying the number of genuinely entangled particles based on the collective\neffect of directed emission combined with the nonclassical nature of the\nemitted light. The method is applicable to a wide range of physical systems and\nis effective even in situations with significant losses. Our results clarify\nthe role of multipartite entanglement in ensemble-based quantum memories as a\nnecessary prerequisite to achieve a high single-photon process fidelity crucial\nfor future quantum networks. On a more fundamental level, our results reveal\nthe robustness of certain classes of multipartite entangled states, contrary\nto, e.g., Schr\\\"odinger-cat states, and that the depth of entanglement can be\nexperimentally certified at unprecedented scales.\n", "  Resolving the microscopic pairing mechanism and its experimental\nidentification in unconventional superconductors is among the most vexing\nproblems of contemporary condensed matter physics. We show that Raman\nspectroscopy provides an avenue for this quest by probing the structure of the\npairing interaction at play in an unconventional superconductor. As we study\nthe spectra of the prototypical Fe-based superconductor ${\\rm\nBa_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2}$ for $0.22\\le x \\le 0.70$ in all symmetry channels, Raman\nspectroscopy allows us to distill the leading $s$-wave state. In addition, the\nspectra collected in the $B_{1g}$ symmetry channel reveal the existence of two\ncollective modes which are indicative of the presence of two competing, yet\nsub-dominant, pairing tendencies of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry type. A\ncomprehensive functional Renormalization Group (fRG) and random-phase\napproximation (RPA) study on this compound confirms the presence of the two\nsub-leading channels, and consistently matches the experimental doping\ndependence of the related modes. The synopsis of experimental evidence and\ntheoretical modelling supports a spin-fluctuation mediated superconducting\npairing mechanism.\n", "  A novel photonic thermal diode concept operating in the near field and\ncapitalizing on the temperature-dependence of coupled surface polariton modes\nin nanostructures is proposed. The diode concept utilizes terminals made of the\nsame material supporting surface polariton modes in the infrared, but with\ndissimilar structures. The specific diode design analyzed in this Letter\ninvolves a thin film and a bulk, both made of 3C silicon carbide, separated by\na subwavelength vacuum gap. High rectification efficiency is obtained by tuning\nthe antisymmetric resonant modes of the thin film, resulting from surface\nphonon-polariton coupling, on- and off-resonance with the resonant mode of the\nbulk as a function of the temperature bias direction. Rectification efficiency\nis investigated by varying structural parameters, namely the vacuum gap size,\nthe dielectric function of the substrate onto which the film is coated, and the\nfilm thickness to gap size ratio. Calculations based on fluctuational\nelectrodynamics reveal that high rectification efficiencies in the 80% to 87%\nrange can be maintained in a wide temperature band (~ 700 K to 1000 K). The\nrectification efficiency of the proposed diode concept can be potentially\nfurther enhanced by investigating more complex nanostructures such as gratings\nand multilayered media.\n", "  In the absence of external material deposition, crystal surfaces usually\nrelax to become flat by decreasing their free energy. We study an asymmetry in\nthe relaxation of macroscopic plateaus, facets, of a periodic surface\ncorrugation in 1+1 dimensions via a continuum model below the roughening\ntransition temperature. The model invokes a highly degenerate parabolic partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) for surface diffusion, which is related to the\nweighted-$H^{-1}$ (nonlinear) gradient flow of a convex, singular surface free\nenergy in homoepitaxy. The PDE is motivated both by an atomistic broken-bond\nmodel and a mesoscale model for steps. By constructing an explicit solution to\nthe PDE, we demonstrate the lack of symmetry in the evolution of top and bottom\nfacets in periodic surface profiles. Our explicit, analytical solution is\ncompared to numerical simulations of the PDE via a regularized surface free\nenergy.\n", "  Randomness is an essential tool in many disciplines of modern sciences, such\nas cryptography, black hole physics, random matrix theory and Monte Carlo\nsampling. In quantum systems, random operations can be obtained via random\ncircuits thanks to so-called q-designs, and play a central role in the fast\nscrambling conjecture for black holes. Here we consider a more physically\nmotivated way of generating random evolutions by exploiting the many-body\ndynamics of a quantum system driven with stochastic external pulses. We combine\ntechniques from quantum control, open quantum systems and exactly solvable\nmodels (via the Bethe-Ansatz) to generate Haar-uniform random operations in\ndriven many-body systems. We show that any fully controllable system converges\nto a unitary q-design in the long-time limit. Moreover, we study the\nconvergence time of a driven spin chain by mapping its random evolution into a\nsemigroup with an integrable Liouvillean and finding its gap. Remarkably, we\nfind via Bethe-Ansatz techniques that the gap is independent of q. We use\nmean-field techniques to argue that this property may be typical for other\ncontrollable systems, although we explicitly construct counter-examples via\nsymmetry breaking arguments to show that this is not always the case. Our\nfindings open up new physical methods to transform classical randomness into\nquantum randomness, via a combination of quantum many-body dynamics and random\ndriving.\n", "  A stochastic method is introduced for geometric modeling aerosol surface\nroughness with random field and discrete differential geometry theory. Optical\nscattering properties are computed for randomly oriented spheroidal particles\nwith uniformly random surface roughness. Invariant imbedding T-Matrix and\ngeometric optics method are applied to compute light scattering properties of\naerosol particles covered from Rayleigh to geometric optics region. We\nsimulatied scattering phase matrix of model particles, better performace is\nobtained than smooth particles. We aslo introduce introduce entropy and\nrelative entropy as measures to distinguish the optical scattering similarities\nbetween different particles.\n", "  The extent to which time-dependent fracture criteria affect the dynamic\nbehavior of fracture in a discrete structure is discussed in this work. The\nsimplest case of a semi-infinite isotropic chain of oscillators has been\nstudied. Two history-dependent criteria are compared to the classical one of\nthreshold elongation for linear bonds. The results show that steady-state\nregimes can be reached in the low subsonic crack speed range where it is\nimpossible according to the classical criterion. Repercussions in terms of load\nand crack opening versus velocity are explained in detail. A strong qualitative\ninfluence of history-dependent criteria is observed at low subsonic crack\nvelocities, especially in relation to achievable steady-state propagation\nregimes.\n", "  We present a degenerate four-wave mixing experiment on a silicon nitride\n(SiN) waveguide covered with gated graphene. We observe strong dependencies on\nsignal-pump detuning and Fermi energy, i.e. the optical nonlinearity is\ndemonstrated to be electrically tunable. In the vicinity of the interband\nabsorption edge ($2|E_F|\\approx \\hbar\\omega$) a peak value of the waveguide\nnonlinear parameter of $\\approx$ 6400 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$, corresponding to a\ngraphene nonlinear sheet conductivity $|\\sigma_s^{(3)}|\\approx4.3\\cdot\n10^{-19}$ A m$^2$V$^{-3}$ is measured.\n", "  We study topological excitations in two-component nematic superconductors,\nwith a particular focus on Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ as a candidate material. We find\nthat the lowest-energy topological excitations are coreless vortices: a bound\nstate of two spatially separated half-quantum vortices. These objects are\nnematic Skyrmions, since they are characterized by an additional topological\ncharge. The inter-Skyrmion forces are dipolar in this model, i.e. attractive\nfor certain relative orientations of the Skyrmions, hence forming\nmulti-Skyrmion bound states.\n", "  This paper presents transient numerical simulations of hydraulic systems in\nengineering applications using the spectral element method (SEM). Along with a\ndetailed description of the underlying numerical method, it is shown that the\nSEM yields highly accurate numerical approximations at modest computational\ncosts, which is in particular useful for optimization-based control\napplications. In order to enable fast explicit time stepping methods, the\nboundary conditions are imposed weakly using a numerically stable upwind\ndiscretization. The benefits of the SEM in the area of hydraulic system\nsimulations are demonstrated in various examples including several simulations\nof strong water hammer effects. Due to its exceptional convergence\ncharacteristics, the SEM is particularly well suited to be used in real-time\ncapable control applications. As an example, it is shown that the time\nevolution of pressure waves in a large scale pumped-storage power plant can be\nwell approximated using a low-dimensional system representation utilizing a\nminimum number of dynamical states.\n", "  Correlated Basis Function (CBF) perturbation theory and the formalism of\ncluster expansions have been recently employed to obtain an effective\ninteraction from a nuclear Hamiltonian strongly constrained by phenomenology.\nWe report the results of a study of the superfluid gap in pure neutron matter,\nassociated with the formation of Cooper pairs in the $^1S_0$ channel. The\ncalculations have been carried out using an improved version of the CBF\neffective interaction, in which three-nucleon forces are taken into account\nusing a microscopic model. Our results show that a non-vanishing superfluid gap\ndevelops at densities in the range $2 \\times 10^{-4} \\lesssim \\rho/\\rho_0\n\\lesssim 0.1 $, where $\\rho_0 = 2.8 \\times 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$ is the\nequilibrium density of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter, corresponding mainly\nto the neutron star inner crust.\n", "  We address diffusion processes in a bounded domain, while focusing on\nsomewhat unexplored affinities between the presence of absorbing and/or\ninaccessible boundaries. For the Brownian motion (L\\'{e}vy-stable cases are\nbriefly mentioned) model-independent features are established, of the dynamical\nlaw that underlies the short time behavior of these random paths, whose overall\nlife-time is predefined to be long. As a by-product, the limiting regime of a\npermanent trapping in a domain is obtained. We demonstrate that the adopted\nconditioning method, involving the so-called Bernstein transition function,\nworks properly also in an unbounded domain, for stochastic processes with\nkilling (Feynman-Kac kernels play the role of transition densities), provided\nthe spectrum of the related semigroup operator is discrete. The method is shown\nto be useful in the case, when the spectrum of the generator goes down to zero\nand no isolated minimal (ground state) eigenvalue is in existence, like e.g. in\nthe problem of the long-term survival on a half-line with a sink at origin.\n", "  Characterization and certification of nonlocal correlations is one of the the\ncentral topics in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop the\ndetection methods of entanglement and steering based on the universal\nuncertainty relations and fine-grained uncertainty relations. In the course of\nour study, the uncertainty relations are formulated in majorization form, and\nthe uncertainty quantifier can be chosen as any convex Schur concave functions,\nthis leads to a large set of inequalities, including all existing criteria\nbased on entropies. We address the question that if all steerable states (or\nentangled states) can be witnessed by some uncertainty-based inequality, we\nfind that for pure states and many important families of states, this is the\ncase.\n", "  The notion of a holographic entropy cone has recently been introduced and it\nhas been proven that this cone is polyhedral. However, the original definition\nwas fully geometric and did not strictly require a holographic duality. We\nintroduce a new definition of the cone, insisting that the geometries used for\nits construction should be dual to states of a CFT. As a result, the\npolyhedrality of this holographic cone does not immediately follow. A numerical\nevaluation of the Euclidean action for the geometries that realize extremal\nrays of the original cone indicates that these are subdominant bulk phases of\nnatural path integrals. The result challenges the expectation that such\ngeometries are in fact dual to CFT states.\n", "  Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) are believed to arise from compact binary\nmergers (either neutron star-neutron star or black hole-neutron star). If so\ntheir jets must penetrate outflows that are ejected during the merger. As a jet\ncrosses the ejecta it dissipates its energy, producing a hot cocoon which\nsurrounds it. We present here 3D numerical simulations of jet propagation in\nmergers' outflows and we calculate the resulting emission. This emission\nconsists of two components: the cooling emission, the leakage of the thermal\nenergy of the hot cocoon, and the cocoon macronova that arises from the\nradioactive decay of the cocoon's material. This emission gives a brief (~ one\nhour) blue, wide angle signal. While the parameters of the outflow and jet are\nuncertain, for the configurations we have considered the signal is bright (~\n-14 $-$ -15 absolute magnitude) and outshines all other predicted UV-optical\nsignals. The signal is brighter when the jet breakout time is longer and its\npeak brightness does not depend strongly on the highly uncertain opacity. A\nrapid search for such a signal is a promising strategy to detect an\nelectromagnetic merger counterpart. A detected candidate could be then followed\nby deep IR searches for the longer but weaker macronova arising from the rest\nof the ejecta.\n", "  The pairing state and critical temperature (T$_c$) of a thin s-wave\nsuperconductor (S) on two or more ferromagnets (F) are controllable through the\nmagnetization-alignment of the F layers. Magnetization misalignment can lead to\nspin-polarized triplet pair creation, and since such triplets are compatible\nwith spin-polarized materials they are able to pass deeply into the F layers\nand so, cause a decrease in T$_c$. Various experiments on S/F$_1$/F$_2$\n\"triplet spin-valves\" have been performed with the most pronounced suppression\nof T$_c$ reported in devices containing the half-metal ferromagnet (HMF)\nCrO$_2$ (F$_2$) albeit using out-of-plane magnetic fields to tune magnetic\nnon-collinearity [Singh et al., Phys. Rev. X 5, 021019 (2015)]. Routine\ntransfer of spin-polarized triplets to HMFs is a major goal for superconducting\nspintronics so as to maximize triplet-state spin-polarization. However, CrO$_2$\nis chemically unstable and out-of-plane fields are undesirable for\nsuperconductivity. Here, we demonstrate magnetization-tuneable pair conversion\nand transfer of spin-polarized triplet pairs to the chemically stable mixed\nvalence manganite La$_{2/3}$Ca$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in a pseudo spin-valve device\nusing in-plane magnetic fields. The results match microscopic theory and offer\nfull control over the pairing state.\n", "  Nonreciprocal circuit elements form an integral part of modern measurement\nand communication systems. Mathematically they require breaking of\ntime-reversal symmetry, typically achieved using magnetic materials and more\nrecently using the quantum Hall effect, parametric permittivity modulation or\nJosephson nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip magnetic-free\ncirculator based on reservoir engineered optomechanical interactions.\nDirectional circulation is achieved with controlled phase-sensitive\ninterference of six distinct electro-mechanical signal conversion paths. The\npresented circulator is compact, its silicon-on-insulator platform is\ncompatible with both superconducting qubits and silicon photonics, and its\nnoise performance is close to the quantum limit. With a high dynamic range, a\ntunable bandwidth of up to 30 MHz and an in-situ reconfigurability as beam\nsplitter or wavelength converter, it could pave the way for superconducting\nqubit processors with integrated and multiplexed on-chip signal processing and\nreadout.\n", "  We find that the quark propagator constructed from the domain-wall fermion\noperator has $L_s-1$ extra poles as well as the pole that realizes the physical\nquark in the continuum limit. We show the energy-momentum dispersion relation\nfor the physical and unphysical poles of M\\\"obius domain-wall fermions in free\nfield theory at finite $L_s$. The dependence of extra pole energies on the\nM\\\"obius parameter $b-c$ and on the domain-wall height $M_5$ is investigated.\nOur result suggests that small values of $b-c$ set a large lower bound on the\nunphysical pole masses and the contribution of these poles could be suppressed\nwell by calculating with small $b-c$.\n", "  Jet charge is an estimator of the electric charge of a quark, antiquark, or\ngluon initiating a jet. It is based on the momentum-weighted sum of the\nelectric charges of the jet constituents. Measurements of three charge\nobservables of the leading jet in transverse momentum pT are performed with\ndijet events. The analysis is carried out with data collected by the CMS\nexperiment at the CERN LHC in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The\nresults are presented as a function of the pT of the leading jet and compared\nto predictions from leading- and next-to-leading-order event generators\ncombined with parton showers. Measured jet charge distributions, unfolded for\ndetector effects, are reported, which expand on previous measurements of the\njet charge average and standard deviation in pp collisions.\n", "  We point out that there is a simple variant of the SYK model, which we call\ncSYK, that is $SL(2,R)$ invariant for all values of the coupling. The\nmodification consists of replacing the UV part of the SYK action with a\nquadratic bilocal term. The corresponding bulk dual is a non-gravitational\ntheory in a rigid AdS$_2$ background. At weak coupling cSYK is a generalized\nfree field theory; at strong coupling, it approaches the infrared of SYK. The\nexistence of this line of fixed points explains the previously found connection\nbetween the three-point function of bilinears in these two theories at large\n$q$.\n", "  Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows have been observed across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, and physical parameters of GRB jets and their\nsurroundings have been derived using broadband modeling. While well-sampled\nlightcurves across the broadband spectrum are necessary to constrain all the\nphysical parameters, some can be strongly constrained by the right combination\nof just a few observables, almost independently of the other unknowns. We\npresent a method involving the peaks of radio lightcurves to constrain the\nfraction of shock energy that resides in electrons, $\\epsilon_e$. This\nparameter is an important ingredient for understanding the microphysics of\nrelativistic shocks; Based on a sample of 36 radio afterglows, we find\n$\\epsilon_e$ has a narrow distribution centered around $0.13-0.15$. Our method\nis suggested as a diagnostic tool for determining $\\epsilon_e$, and to help\nconstrain the broadband modeling of GRB afterglows. Some earlier measurements\nof the spreads in parameter values for $\\epsilon_e$, the kinetic energy of the\nshock, and the density of the circumburst medium, based on broadband modeling\nacross the entire spectrum, are at odds with our analysis of radio peaks. This\ncould be due to different modeling methods and assumptions, and possibly\nmissing ingredients in past and current modeling efforts. Furthermore, we show\nthat observations at $\\gtrsim10$~GHz performed $0.3-30$ days after the GRB\ntrigger, are best suited for pinpointing the synchrotron peak frequency, and\nconsequently $\\epsilon_e$. At the same time, observations at lower radio\nfrequencies can pin down the synchrotron self-absorption frequency and help\nconstrain the other physical parameters of GRB afterglows.\n", "  We analyze an open many-body system that is strongly coupled at its\nboundaries to interacting quantum baths. We show that the two-body interactions\ninside the baths induce emergent phenomena in the spin transport. The system\nand baths are modeled as independent spin chains resulting in a global\nnon-homogeneous XXZ model. The evolution of the system-bath state is simulated\nusing matrix-product-states methods. We present two phase transitions induced\nby bath interactions. For weak bath interactions we observe ballistic and\ninsulating phases. However, for strong bath interactions a diffusive phase\nemerges with a distinct power-law decay of the time-dependent spin current\n$Q\\propto t^{-\\alpha}$. Furthermore, we investigate long-lasting current\noscillations arising from the non-Markovian dynamics in the homogeneous case,\nand find a sharp change in their frequency scaling coinciding with the triple\npoint of the phase diagram.\n", "  The generalization of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem for resonance states in\nquantum field theory is derived. On the basis of this theorem, a criterion is\nproposed to study the possible exotic nature of certain hadronic states\nemerging in QCD. It is shown that this proposal is supported by explicit\ncalculations in Chiral Perturbation Theory and by large-$N_c$ arguments.\nAnalyzing recent lattice data on the quark mass dependence in the pseudoscalar,\nvector meson, baryon octet and baryon decuplet sectors, we conclude that, as\nexpected, these are predominately quark-model states, albeit the corrections\nare non-negligible.\n", "  We show initial data for gravitational axial waves, that are twice\ndifferentiable but which are not $C^{2}$. They generate wave pulses that\ninteract with matter in the radiation cosmological era. This forces the\nradiation matter to rotate. This rotation is permanent - it persists after the\npassage of the gravitational pulse. The observed inhomogeneities of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation put a bound onto discontinuities of superhorizon\nmetric perturbations. We explicitly show that a class of smooth initial metrics\nthat are at least $C^{2}$ gives rise to gravitational wave pulses that do not\ninteract with the background during the radiation epoch.\n", "  In a simplified model of Multiple Parton Interactions the inclusive cross\nsections, of processes with large momentum transfer exchange, acquire the\nstatistical meaning of factorial moments of the distribution in multiplicity of\ninteractions, while more exclusive cross sections, which can provide\ncomplementary information on the interaction dynamics, become experimentally\nviable. Inclusive and exclusive cross sections are linked by sum rules, which\ncan be tested experimentally.\n", "  Predicting the amount of time required for a transient groundwater response\nto take place is a practical question that is of interest in many situations.\nThis time scale is often called the response time. In the groundwater hydrology\nliterature there are two main methods used to calculate the response time: (i)\nboth the transient and steady state groundwater flow equations are solved, and\nthe response time is taken to be amount of time required for the transient\nsolution to approach the steady solution within some tolerance; and (ii) simple\nscaling arguments are adopted. Certain limitations restrict both of these\napproaches. Here we outline a third method, based on the theory of mean action\ntime. We derive the governing boundary value problem for both the mean and\nvariance of action time for confined flow in two-dimensional heterogeneous\nporous media. Importantly, we show that these boundary value problems can be\nsolved using widely available software. Applying these methods to a test case\nreveals the advantages of the theory of mean action time relative to standard\nmethods.\n", "  Fluctuations of conserved quantities are believed to be sensitive observables\nto probe the signature of the QCD phase transition and critical point. It was\nargued recently that measuring the genuine correlation functions (CFs) could\nprovide cleaner information on possible nontrivial dynamics in heavy-ion\ncollisions.With the AMPT (a multiphase transport) model, the centrality and\nenergy dependence of various orders of CFs of net protons in Au + Au collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV are\ninvestigated. The model results show that the number of antiprotons is\nimportant and should be taken into account in the calculation of CFs at high\nenergy and/or in peripheral collisions. It is also found that the contribution\nof antiprotons is more important for higher order correlations than for lower\nones. The CFs of antiprotons and mixed correlations play roles comparable to\nthose of protons at high energies. Finally, we make comparisons between the\nmodel calculation and experimental data measured in the STAR experiment at the\nBNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.\n", "  For a digital quantum simulator (DQS) imitating a target system, we ask the\nfollowing question: Under what conditions is the simulator dynamics similar to\nthat of the target in the presence of coupling to a bath? In this paper, we\nderive conditions for close simulation for three different physical regimes,\nreplacing previous heuristic arguments on the subject with rigorous statements.\nIn fact, we find that the conventional wisdom that the simulation cycle time\nshould always be short for good simulation need not always hold up. Numerical\nsimulations of two specific examples strengthen the evidence for our analysis,\nand go beyond to explore broader regimes.\n", "  Recently solvers for the Anderson impurity model (AIM) working directly on\nthe real-frequency axis have gained much interest. A simple and yet frequently\nused impurity solver is exact diagonalization (ED), which is based on a\ndiscretization of the AIM bath degrees of freedom. Usually, the bath parameters\ncannot be obtained directly on the real-frequency axis, but have to be\ndetermined by a fit procedure on the Matsubara axis. In this work we present an\napproach where the bath degrees of freedom are first discretized directly on\nthe real-frequency axis using a large number of bath sites ($\\approx 50$).\nThen, the bath is optimized by unitary transformations such that it separates\ninto two parts that are weakly coupled. One part contains the impurity site and\nits interacting Green's functions can be determined with ED. The other (larger)\npart is a non-interacting system containing all the remaining bath sites.\nFinally, the Green's function of the full AIM is calculated via coupling these\ntwo parts with cluster perturbation theory.\n", "  A class of $AdS_2\\times \\Sigma_2$, with $\\Sigma_2$ being a two-sphere or a\nhyperbolic space, solutions within four-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity\ncoupled to three-vector multiplets with dyonic gauging is identified. The\ngauged supergravity has non-semisimple $SO(3)\\ltimes\n(\\mathbf{T}^3,\\hat{\\mathbf{T}}^3)$ gauge group and can be obtained from a\nconsistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a tri-sasakian\nmanifold. The maximally symmetric vacua contain $AdS_4$ geometries with $N=1,3$\nsupersymmetry corresponding to $N=1$ and $N=3$ superconformal field theories\n(SCFTs) in three dimensions. We find supersymmetric solutions of the form\n$AdS_2\\times \\Sigma_2$ preserving two supercharges. These solutions describe\ntwisted compactifications of the dual $N=1$ and $N=3$ SCFTs and should arise as\nnear horizon geometries of dyonic black holes in asymptotically $AdS_4$\nspace-time. Most solutions have hyperbolic horizons although some of them\nexhibit spherical horizons. These provide a new class of $AdS_2\\times \\Sigma_2$\ngeometries with known M-theory origin.\n", "  The very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) extragalactic sky is dominated by\nblazars, a class of active galactic nuclei which show rapid variability at all\nwavelengths. Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations triggered by flaring\nactivity detected at longer wavelengths are, thus, an important part of the\nblazar observing strategy of H.E.S.S., an array of five imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes sensitive to VHE photons. In this contribution we detail\nthe H.E.S.S. extragalactic ToO program, describing the specific procedures\ncurrently in place to follow up on multi-wavelength alerts. The program is\nillustrated by discussing a few recent noteworthy targets observed with the\nH.E.S.S. phase II array over the last two years of blazar ToO observations.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the hysteresis observed in the transfer\ncharacteristics of back-gated field-effect transistors with an exfoliated MoS2\nchannel. We find that the hysteresis is strongly enhanced by increasing either\ngate voltage, pressure, temperature or light intensity. Our measurements reveal\na step-like behavior of the hysteresis around room temperature, which we\nexplain as water-facilitated charge trapping at the MoS2/SiO2 interface. We\nconclude that intrinsic defects in MoS2, such as S vacancies, which result in\neffective positive charge trapping, play an important role, besides H2O and O2\nadsorbates on the unpassivated device surface. We show that the bistability\nassociated to the hysteresis can be exploited in memory devices.\n", "  Recent studies of radio data put strong constraints on annihilation cross\nsection for dark matter. In this article, we provide the first analysis of\nusing M33 radio data in constraining annihilating dark matter. The resulting\nconstraints of annihilation cross sections for some channels are more stringent\nthan that obtained from 6 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT)\ngamma-ray observations of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. In\nparticular, the conservative lower limits of dark matter mass annihilating via\n$e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels are 190 GeV, 120 GeV and 70\nGeV respectively with the thermal relic annihilation cross section. These\nresults are in large tensions with some of the recent quantitative analyses of\nthe AMS-02 and Fermi-LAT data of the Milky Way center.\n", "  The Monster CFT plays an important role in moonshine and is also conjectured\nto be the holographic dual to pure gravity in AdS3. We investigate the\nentanglement and Renyi entropies of this theory along with other extremal CFTs.\nThe Renyi entropies of a single interval on the torus are evaluated using the\nshort interval expansion. Each order in the expansion contains closed form\nexpressions of the modular parameter. The leading terms in the q-series are\nshown to precisely agree with the universal corrections to Renyi entropies at\nlow temperatures. Furthermore, these results are shown to match with bulk\ncomputations of Renyi entropy using the one-loop partition function on\nhandlebodies. We also explore some features of Renyi entropies of two intervals\non the plane.\n", "  The differential equation with free boundary conditions on the unit disk that\nwas proposed by Frits Zernike in 1934 to find Jacobi polynomial solutions\n(indicated as I), serves to define a classical and a quantum system which have\nbeen found to be superintegrable. We have determined two new orthogonal\npolynomial solutions (indicated as II and III) that are separable, and which\ninvolve Legendre and Gegenbauer polynomials.\n  Here we report on their three interbasis expansion coefficients: between the\nI--II and I--III bases they are given by $_3F_2(\\cdots|1)$ polynomials that are\nalso special su($2$) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Hahn polynomials. Between\nthe II--III bases, we find an xpansion expressed by $_4F_3(\\cdots|1)$'s and\nRacah polynomials that are related to the Wigner $6j$ coefficients.\n", "  The simplest cyanobenzene, benzonitrile (c-C6H5CN) have been possibly\ndetected toward the cyanopolyyne peak in TMC-1. We used the results of the 8.8\n-- 50 GHz spectral survey of TMC-1 by Kaifu et al. (2004) and stacked the lines\nof benzonitrile that fall within the range of this survey. The obtained\nspectrum strongly suggests the presence of this molecule. Benzonitrile is a\nderivative of the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons\nare thought to be ubiquitous in the ISM, but it is difficult to study them in\nmolecular cloud interiors, since they are nonpolar and have no allowed\ntransitions at radio frequencies. Therefore it is important to search for their\nderivatives, such as cyanobenzenes. Thus, the detection of benzonitrile might\nbe important for astrochemistry, but additional sensitive observations are\nnecessary in order to confirm it.\n", "  The LHCb Collaboration recently observed five narrow $\\Omega_c^{0}$\nresonances, and measured their masses and widths through the decays $\n\\Omega_c^{0} \\to \\Xi_c^{+}K^{-}$. Motivated by this discovery, and also by the\nfact that the ground-state bottom baryon $\\Omega_b^{-}$ with spin-1/2 was\nalready found experimentally, we perform theoretical investigation of the\nspin-1/2 and spin-3/2, $\\Omega_b$, baryons by calculating decay width of their\nfirst orbitally and radially excited states to $\\Xi_b^{0} K^{-}$. For this\npurpose, we employ QCD sum rule method on the light-cone by including into\nanalysis the $K$ meson distribution amplitudes up to twist-4. Obtained\nanalytical expressions are utilized to extract parameters of these decay\nprocesses which may be useful for forthcoming experimental studies of bottom\nbaryons.\n", "  We study the fidelity susceptibility of quantum antiferromagnetic Ising chain\nwith a long-range power law interaction $1/r^{\\alpha}$ using the large-scale\ndensity matrix renormalization group method. We find that the critical\nadiabatic dimension $\\mu=2$ and the critical exponent of the correlation length\n$\\nu=1$ for arbitrary $\\alpha>0$, indicating all quantum phase transitions are\nsecond-order Ising transitions. In addition, we numerically determine the\ncomplete phase diagram for $0 < \\alpha \\le 3$ from the data collapse of the\nfidelity susceptibility and show that the critical point $h_c$ changes\nmonotonously with respect to $\\alpha$. This work will shed light on the nature\nof phase transitions in the quantum long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain\nfrom a quantum information perspective.\n", "  We report on a detailed analysis of the $\\gamma$-ray light curve of NGC 1275\nusing the Fermi large area telescope data accumulated in 2008-2017. Major\n$\\gamma$-ray flares were observed in October 2015 and December 2016/January\n2017 when the source reached a daily peak flux of\n$(2.21\\pm0.26)\\times10^{-6}\\:{\\rm photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}}$, achieving a flux\nof $(3.48\\pm0.87)\\times10^{-6}\\:{\\rm photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}}$ within 3 hours,\nwhich corresponds to an apparent isotropic $\\gamma$-ray luminosity of\n$\\simeq3.84\\times10^{45}\\:{\\rm erg\\:s^{-1}}$. The most rapid flare had\ne-folding time as short as $1.21\\pm0.22$ hours which had never been previously\nobserved for any radio galaxy in $\\gamma$-ray band. Also $\\gamma$-ray spectral\nchanges were observed during these flares: in the flux versus photon index\nplane the spectral evolution follows correspondingly a counter clockwise and a\nclockwise loop inferred from the light curve generated by an adaptive binning\nmethod. On December 30, 2016 and January 01, 2017 the X-ray photon index\nsoftened ($\\Gamma_{\\rm X}\\simeq 1.75-1.77$) and the flux increased nearly\n$\\sim3$ times as compared with the quiet state. The observed hour-scale\nvariability suggests a very compact emission region\n($R_\\gamma\\leq5.22\\times10^{14}\\:(\\delta/4)\\:{\\rm cm}$) implying that the\nobserved emission is most likely produced in the subparsec-scale jet if the\nentire jet width is responsible for the emission. During the active periods the\n$\\gamma$-ray photon index hardened, shifting the peak of the high energy\nspectral component to $>{\\rm GeV}$, making it difficult to explain the observed\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray data in the standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton\nmodel.\n", "  We propose a hybrid class of theories for higher spin gravity and matrix\nmodels, i.e. which handle simultaneously higher spin gravity fields and matrix\nmodels. The construction is similar to Vasiliev's higher spin gravity but part\nof the equations of motion are provided by the action principle of a matrix\nmodel. In particular we construct a higher spin (gravity) matrix model related\nto type IIB matrix models/string theory which have a well defined classical\nlimit, and which is compatible with higher spin gravity in $AdS$ space. As it\nhas been suggested that higher spin gravity should be related to string theory\nin a high energy (tensionless) regime, and therefore to M-Theory, we expect\nthat our construction will be useful to explore concrete connections.\n", "  Getting signatures of quantum gravity is one of the topical lines of research\nin modern theoretical physics and cosmology. This short review faces this\nchallenge under a novel perspective. Instead of separating quantum-gravity\neffects of a specific model between UV and IR regimes, we consider a general\nfeature, possibly common to many frameworks, where all scales are affected and\nspacetime geometry is characterized by a complex critical exponent. This leaves\na log-oscillating modulation pattern in the cosmic microwave background\nspectrum and gives a unique opportunity, illustrated with the example of a\nmulti-fractional theory, to test quantum gravities at cosmological scales.\n", "  Recurrence analysis is a well settled method allowing to discern chaos from\norder, and determinism from noise. We apply this tool to study time series\nrepresenting geodesic and inspiraling motion of a test particle in a deformed\nKerr spacetime, when deterministic chaos and different levels of stochastic\nnoise are present. In particular, we suggest a recurrence-based criterion to\nreveal whether the time series comes from a deterministic source and find a\nnoise-level threshold of its applicability.\n", "  Organic Solid-Solid Wetting Deposition (OSWD) enables the fabrication of\nsupramolecular architectures without the need for solubility or vacuum\nconditions. The technique is based on a process which directly generates\ntwo-dimensional monolayers from three-dimensional solid organic powders.\nConsequently, insoluble organic pigments and semiconductors can be made to\ninduce monolayer self-assembly on substrate surfaces, such as graphene and\ncarbon nanotubes, under ambient conditions. The above factuality hence opens up\nthe potential of the OSWD for bandgap engineering applications within the\ncontext of carbon based nanoelectronics. However, the doping of graphene via\nOSWD has not yet been verified, primarily owing to the fact that the classical\nOSWD preparation procedures do not allow for the analysis via Raman\nspectroscopy, one of the main techniques to determine graphene doping. Hence,\nhere we describe a novel approach to induce OSWD on graphene leading to samples\nsuitable for Raman spectroscopy. The analysis reveals peak shifts within the\nRaman spectrum of graphene, which are characteristics for p-type doping.\nAdditional evidence for chemical doping is found via Scanning Tunneling\nSpectroscopy. The results open up a very easily applicable, low-cost, and\neco-friendly way for doping graphene via commercially available organic\npigments.\n", "  During the last years there has been an increasing excitement in nanomotors\nand particularly in current-driven nanomotors. Despite the broad variety of\nstimulating results found, the regime of strong Coulomb interactions has not\nbeen fully explored for this application. Here we consider\nnanoelectromechanical devices composed by a set of coupled quantum dots\ninteracting with mechanical degrees of freedom taken in the adiabatic limit and\nweakly coupled to electronic reservoirs. We use a real-time diagrammatic\napproach to derive general expressions for the current-induced forces, friction\ncoefficients, and zero-frequency force noise in the Coulomb blockade regime of\ntransport. We prove our expressions accomplish with Onsager's reciprocity\nrelations and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the energy dissipation of\nthe mechanical modes. The obtained results are illustrated in a nanomotor\nconsisting of a double quantum dot capacitively coupled to some rotating\ncharges. We analyze the dynamics and performance of the motor as function of\nthe applied voltage and loading force for trajectories encircling different\ntriple points in the charge stability diagram.\n", "  The dismantling network problem only asks the minimal vertex set of a graph\nafter removing which the remaining graph will break into connected components\nof sub-extensive size, but we should also consider the efficiency of\nintermediate states during the entire dismantling process, which is measured by\nthe general performance R in this paper. In order to improve the general\nperformance of the belief-propagation decimation (BPD) algorithm, we introduce\na compound algorithm (CA) mixing the BPD and the node explosive percolation\n(NEP) algorithm. In this CA, the NEP algorithm will rearrange and optimize the\nhead part of a dismantling sequence given by the BPD. Two ancestor algorithms\nare connected at the joint point where the general performance can be\noptimized. It dismantles a graph to small pieces as quickly as the BPD, and it\nis with the efficiency of the NEP during the entire dismantling process. We\nfind that a wise joint point is where the BPD breaks the original graph to\nsubgraphs no longer larger than the 1% of the original one. We refer the CA\nwith this settled joint point as the fast CA and the fast CA is in the same\ncomplexity class with the BPD algorithm. The computation on some real-world\ninstances also exhibits that using the fast CA to optimize the intermediate\nprocess of a dismantling algorithm is an effective approach.\n", "  In this paper, we present the algorithm for the simulation of a single bubble\nrising in a stagnant liquid using Euler-Lagrangian (EL) approach. The\ncontinuous liquid phase is modeled using BGK approximation of lattice Boltzmann\nmethod (LBM), and a Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) approach has been used\nto model the dispersed gas (bubble) phase. A two-way coupling scheme is\nimplemented for the interface interaction between two phases. The simulation\nresults are compared with the theoretical and experimental data reported in the\nliterature and it was found that the presented modeling technique is in good\nagreement with the theoretical and experimental data for the relative and\nterminal velocity of a bubble. We also performed the grid independence test for\nthe current model and the results show that the grid size does not affect the\nrationality of the results. The stability test has been done by finding the\nrelative velocity of a bubble as a function of time for the different value of\ndimensionless relaxation frequency. The present study is relevant for\nunderstanding the bubble-fluid interaction module and helps to develop the\naccurate numerical model for bioreactor simulation.\n", "  Pulsed Laser Deposition allows to obtain W and W-Ta alloy coatings with\ndifferent nanostructures, monitored by X-ray diffraction. The correlation\nbetween such structures and the elastic properties is investigated for\namorphous-like, ultra-nano- and nano-crystalline coatings obtained by tuning\nthe gas pressure during deposition, annealing temperature and Ta concentration.\nThe full elastic characterization is achieved by surface Brillouin\nspectroscopy, interpreted by isotropic and anisotropic film models. Amorphous\nlike coatings are obtained with He pressures of tens of Pa. In comparison with\nbulk W, they have lower stiffness, by about 60\\%, closely correlated to the\nmass density (lower by about 40\\%). In the nanocrystalline regime the stiffness\nis more correlated to the average grain size, approaching the bulk values for\nincreasing crystallite size. Vacuum annealing of amorphous like coatings leads\nto the nucleation of ultra-nano crystalline seeds, embedded in an amorphous\nmatrix with intermediate values for mass density and stiffness. Here, the\nstiffness results from an interplay between the crystal size and the density.\nAlloying with Ta leads to properties which are consistent with the lever rule\nin the nanocrystalline regime, and deviate from it when the higher Ta\nconcentration, interfering with crystal growth, induces an ultra-nano\ncrystalline structure.\n", "  Endovascular sealing is a new technique for the repair of abdominal aortic\naneurysms. Commercially available in Europe since~2013, it takes a\nrevolutionary approach to aneurysm repair through minimally invasive\ntechniques. Although aneurysm sealing may be thought as more stable than\nconventional endovascular stent graft repairs, post-implantation movement of\nthe endoprosthesis has been described, potentially leading to late\ncomplications. The paper presents for the first time a model, which explains\nthe nature of forces, in static and dynamic regimes, acting on sealed abdominal\naortic aneurysms, with references to real case studies. It is shown that\nelastic deformation of the aorta and of the endoprosthesis induced by static\nforces and vibrations during daily activities can potentially promote undesired\nmovements of the endovascular sealing structure.\n", "  In Kondo lattice systems with mixed valence, such as YbAl3, interactions\nbetween localized electrons in a partially filled f shell and delocalized\nconduction electrons can lead to fluctuations between two different valence\nconfigurations with changing temperature or pressure. The impact of this change\non the momentum-space electronic structure and Fermi surface topology is\nessential for understanding their emergent properties, but has remained\nenigmatic due to a lack of appropriate experimental probes. Here by employing a\ncombination of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and in situ angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we show that valence fluctuations can lead\nto dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topology, even resulting in a Lifshitz\ntransition. As the temperature is lowered, a small electron pocket in YbAl3\nbecomes completely unoccupied while the low-energy ytterbium (Yb) 4f states\nbecome increasingly itinerant, acquiring additional spectral weight, longer\nlifetimes, and well-defined dispersions. Our work presents the first unified\npicture of how local valence fluctuations connect to momentum space concepts\nincluding band filling and Fermi surface topology in the longstanding problem\nof mixed-valence systems.\n", "  In an imaginary conversation with Guido Altarelli, I express my views on the\nstatus of particle physics beyond the Standard Model and its future prospects.\n", "  Photometric observations and analysis of FY Lac were performed in order to\ndetermine the variability characteristics, using measurements taken at Loiano\nsite of Bologna Astronomical Observatory and AAVSO data. The star shows a Long\nTerm variability with a preliminary period of about 274 +/- 28 days and\nphotometric characteristics compatible with a red M5 III giant star, with a\ntemperature of 3420 K degrees.\n", "  On 2015 November 13, the small artificial object designated WT1190F entered\nthe Earth atmosphere above the Indian Ocean offshore Sri Lanka after being\ndiscovered as a possible new asteroid only a few weeks earlier. At ESA's\nSSA-NEO Coordination Centre we took advantage of this opportunity to organize a\nground-based observational campaign, using WT1190F as a test case for a\npossible similar future event involving a natural asteroidal body.\n", "  The fall of the Annama meteorite occurred early morning (local time) on April\n19, 2014 on the Kola Peninsula (Russia). Based on mineralogy and physical\nproperties, Annama is a typical H chondrite. It has a high Ar-Ar age of 4.4 Ga.\nIts cosmic ray exposure history is atypical as it is not part of the large\ngroup of H chondrites with a prominent 7 - 8 Ma peak in the exposure age\nhistograms. Instead, its exposure age is within uncertainty of a smaller peak\nat 30 \\pm 4 Ma. The results from short-lived radionuclides are compatible with\nan atmosperic pre-entry radius of 30 - 40 cm. However, based on noble gas and\ncosmogenic radionuclide data, Annama must have been part of a larger body\n(radius >65 cm) for a large part of its cosmic ray exposure history. The 10Be\nconcentration indicates a recent (3 - 5 Ma) breakup which may be responsible\nfor the Annama parent body size reduction to 30 - 35 cm pre-entry radius.\n", "  We demonstrate that a numerical linked cluster expansion method is a powerful\ntool to calculate quantum dynamics. We calculate the dynamics of the\nmagnetization and spin correlations in the two-dimensional transverse field\nIsing and XXZ models evolved from a product state. Such dynamics are directly\nprobed in ongoing experiments in ultracold atoms, molecules, and ions. We show\nthat a numerical linked cluster expansion gives dramatically more accurate\nresults at short-to-moderate times than exact diagonalization, and\nsimultaneously requires fewer computational resources. More specifically, the\ncluster expansion frequently produces more accurate results than an exact\ndiagonalization calculation that would require $10^{5}$--$10^{10}$ more\ncomputational operations and memory.\n", "  The present numerical study aims at shedding light on the mechanism\nunderlying the precessional instability in a sphere. Precessional instabilities\nin the form of parametric resonance due to topographic coupling have been\nreported in a spheroidal geometry both analytically and numerically. We show\nthat such parametric resonances can also develop in spherical geometry due to\nthe conical shear layers driven by the Ekman pumping singularities at the\ncritical latitudes. Scaling considerations lead to a stability criterion of the\nform, $|P_o|>O(E^{4/5})$, where $P_o$ represents the Poincar\\'e number and $E$\nthe Ekman number. The predicted threshold is consistent with our numerical\nsimulations as well as previous experimental results. When the precessional\nforcing is supercriticial, our simulations show evidence of an inverse cascade,\ni.e. small scale flows merging into large scale cyclones with a retrograde\ndrift. Finally, it is shown that this instability mechanism may be relevant to\nprecessing celestial bodies such as the Earth and Earth's moon.\n", "  Posturography is routinely used to qualitatively assess one of the cardinal\nsymptoms of Parkinson's disease -- postural instability. While most measures of\nbalance control are derived from displacement of the center of pressure there\nis evidence that such control is more likely to be velocity-based. We performed\nstatic posturographic tests (eyes open and eyes closed) during quiet standing\nin narrow stance for n=30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PDP) in the ON\nstate and compared the results with those of n=30 age-matched senior controls\n(HSC) and n=60 young controls (HYC). We used differentiator filters to generate\ntime series of low-frequency fluctuations of sway velocity and calculated their\nLempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). With eyes closed, the mediolateral LZC of HSC 0.21\n(0.02) was significantly higher than those of HYC 0.19 (0.02) and PDP 0.18\n(002). Thus aging and PD have opposite effects on mediolateral LZC which\nstrongly differentiates between HSC and PDP (92% sensitivity and 87%\nspecificity).\n", "  This paper describes the effect of PYTHIA8 tunes on event simulation of\n$e^+e^-$ collisions with center-of-mass (CM) energies of 380 GeV and 3 TeV at\nthe proposed CLIC collider. Event shapes, such as thrust, thrust major, thrust\nminor, oblateness, as well as particle multiplicities have been analyzed and\nrelative differences with respect to the default PYTHIA8 tune were determined.\nThe effect of tunes on top-mass reconstruction in the resolved and boosted\nregimes was analyzed. No statistically significant variation for reconstructed\ntop masses using invariant masses of three jets was found for events with a CM\nenergy of 380 GeV. For the fully boosted top reconstruction at a CM energy of 3\nTeV, a significant shift in reconstructed top mass of about 700 MeV for the\n\"Montull\" tune was observed. This shift correlates with an increase in particle\nmultiplicity compared to all other PYTHIA8 tunes.\n", "  For words, rank-frequency distributions have long been heralded for adherence\nto a potentially-universal phenomenon known as Zipf's law. The hypothetical\nform of this empirical phenomenon was refined by Ben\\^{i}ot Mandelbrot to that\nwhich is presently referred to as the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. Parallel to this,\nHerbet Simon proposed a selection model potentially explaining Zipf's law.\nHowever, a significant dispute between Simon and Mandelbrot, notable empirical\nexceptions, and the lack of a strong empirical connection between Simon's model\nand the Zipf-Mandelbrot law have left the questions of universality and\nmechanistic generation open. We offer a resolution to these issues by\nexhibiting how the dark matter of word segmentation, i.e., space, punctuation,\netc., connect the Zipf-Mandelbrot law to Simon's mechanistic process. This\nexplains Mandelbrot's refinement as no more than a fudge factor, accommodating\nthe effects of the exclusion of the rank-frequency dark matter. Thus,\nintegrating these non-word objects resolves a more-generalized rank-frequency\nlaw. Since this relies upon the integration of space, etc., we find support for\nthe hypothesis that $all$ are generated by common processes, indicating from a\nphysical perspective that space is a word, too.\n", "  We present arguments demonstrating that the application of the\nNikiforov-Uvarov polynomial method to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the\nTietz-Hua potential is valid only when $e^{-b_{h}r_{e}}\\leq c_{h}<1$ and\n$r_{0}<r<+\\infty $. In particular, it is pointed out that the numerical results\nwith $c_{h}\\neq 0$ for the diatomic molecules $\\mathrm{HF}$, $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$,\n$\\mathrm{I}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}$\ngiven in Tables 3-5 by Hamzavi and co-workers are wrong. When $-1\\leq c_{h}<0$\nor $0<c_{h}<e^{-b_{h}r_{e}}$, this approach is not suitable. In both cases, it\nis shown that the solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation are expressed in\nterms of the generalized hypergeometric functions $_{2}F_{1}\\left(\na,b,c;z\\right) $. The determination of the energy levels requires the solution\nof transcendantal equations involving the hypergeometric function by means of\nthe numerical procedure.\n", "  In this study, we investigate thermospheric neutral mass density heating\nassociated with 168 CME-driven geomagnetic storms in the period of May 2001 to\nSeptember 2011. We use neutral density measured by two low-Earth orbit\nsatellites: CHAMP and GRACE. For each storm, we superpose geomagnetic and\ndensity data for the time when the IMF B$_\\mathrm{z}$ component turns sharply\nsouthward chosen as the zero epoch time. This indicates the storm main phase\nonset. We find that the average SYM-H index reaches the minimum of $-$42 nT\nnear 12 hours after storm main phase onset. The Joule heating is enhanced by\napproximately 200\\% in comparison to quiet values. In respect to thermosphere\ndensity, on average, high latitude regions (auroral zones and polar caps) of\nboth hemispheres are highly heated in the first 1.5 hour of the storm. The\nequatorial response is presumably associated with direct equator-ward\npropagation of TADs (traveling atmospheric disturbances). A slight north-south\nasymmetry in thermosphere heating is found and is most likely due to a positive\nB$_\\mathrm{y}$ component in the first hours of the storm main phase.\n", "  We formulate Bayesian updates in Markov processes by means of path integral\ntechniques and derive the imaginary-time Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with\nlikelihood to direct the inference incorporated as a potential for the\nposterior probability distribution\n", "  In addition to nucleophile and solvent, the leaving group has a significant\ninfluence on nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions. Its role is frequently\ndiscussed with respect to reactivity, but its influence on the reaction\ndynamics remains obscured. Here, we uncover the influence of the leaving group\non the gas phase dynamics of SN2 reactions in a combined approach of\ncrossed-beam imaging and dynamics simulations. We have studied the reaction F-\n+ CH3Cl and compared it to F- + CH3I. For the two leaving groups Cl and I we\nfind very similar structures and energetics, but the dynamics show\nqualitatively different features. Simple scaling of the leaving group mass does\nnot explain these differences. Instead, the relevant impact parameters for the\nreaction mechanisms are found to be crucial, which is attributed to the\nrelative orientation of the approaching reactants. This effect occurs on short\ntime scales and may also prevail under solution phase conditions.\n", "  The charge transfer reaction of Ar+ with H2 and D2 has been investigated in\nan experiment combining crossed beams with three-dimensional velocity map\nimaging. Angle-differential cross sections for two collision energies have been\nobtained for both neutral species. We find that the product ions are highly\ninternally excited. In the reaction with H2 the spin-orbit excited Ar+ state's\ncoupling to the 'resonant' vibrationally excited product H2+(v=2) dominates for\nboth investigated energies, in line with previous investigations. The observed\nangular distributions, however, show significantly less back-scattering than\nwas found previously. Furthermore, we discovered that the product ions are\nhighly rotationally excited. In the case of Ar+ reacting with D2 the\nenergetically closest lying vibrational levels are not strictly preferred and\nhigher-lying vibrational levels are also populated. For both species the\nbackward-scattered products show higher internal excitation.\n", "  A single unit cell contains all the information about the bulk system,\nincluding the topological feature. The topological invariant can be extracted\nfrom a finite system, which consists of several unit cells under certain\nenvironment, such as a non-Hermitian external field. We investigate a non-\nHermitian finite-size Kitaev chain with PT-symmetric chemical potentials. Exact\nsolution at the symmetric point shows that Majorana edge modes can emerge as\nthe coalescing states at exceptional points and PT symmetry breaking states.\nThe coalescing zero mode is the finite-size projection of the conventional\ndegenerate zero modes in a Hermitian infinite system with the open boundary\ncondition. It indicates a variant of the bulk-edge correspondence: The number\nof Majorana edge modes in a finite non-Hermitian system can be the topological\ninvariant to identify the topological phase of the corresponding bulk Hermitian\nsystem.\n", "  Molecular reflections on usual wall surfaces can be statistically described\nby the Maxwell diffuse reflection model, which has been successfully applied in\nthe DSBGK simulations. We develop the DSBGK algorithm to implement the\nCercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) reflection model, which is widely applied to\npolished surfaces and used particularly in modeling space shuttles to predict\nthe heat and force loads exerted by the high-speed flows around the surfaces.\nWe also extend the DSBGK method to simulate gas mixtures and high contrast of\nnumber densities of different components can be handled at a cost of memory\nusage much lower than that needed by the DSMC simulations because the average\nnumbers of simulated molecules of different components per cell can be equal in\nthe DSBGK simulations.\n", "  Exceptional point in non-Hermitian system possesses fascinating properties.\nWe present an exactly solvable attractor dynamics for the first time from a\ntwo-level time dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It allows a way to evolve\nto the coalescence state from a pure or mixed initial state through varying the\nimaginary parameter along a specific diabatic passage. Contrast to a chaotic\nattractor that is ultrasensitive to the initial condition, the designed\nattractor is insensitive to the initial conditions. The attractor-like behavior\nstill exists for several adiabatic processes.\n", "  Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a prefabricated solid engineered wood product\nmade of at least three orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber that are\nlaminated by gluing longitudinal and transverse layers with structural\nadhesives to form a solid panel. Previous studies have shown that the CLT\nbuildings can perform well in seismic loading and are recognized as the\nessential role of connector performance in structural design, modelling, and\nanalysis of CLT buildings. When CLT is composed of high-grade/high-density\nlayers for the outer lamellas and low-grade/low-density for the core of the\npanels, the CLT panels are herein designated as hybrid CLT panels as opposed to\nconventional CLT panels that are built using one lumber type for both outer and\ncore lamellas. This paper presents results of a testing program developed to\nestimate the cyclic performance of CLT connectors applied on hybrid CLT layups.\nTwo connectors are selected, which can be used in wall-to-floor connections.\nThese are readily available in the North American market. Characterization of\nthe performance of connectors is done in two perpendicular directions under a\nmodified CUREE cyclic loading protocol. Depending on the mode of failure, in\nsome cases, testing results indicate that when the nails or screws penetrate\nthe low-grade/low-density core lumber, a statistically significant difference\nis obtained between hybrid and conventional layups. However, in other cases,\ndue to damage in the face layer or in the connection, force-displacement\nresults for conventional and hybrid CLT layups were not statistically\nsignificant.\n", "  The stability of the stored information in recording media depends on the\nanisotropy energy Ea = KeffV of nanoparticles (NPs) of volume V or diameter D.\nTherefore, the knowledge of how the effective magnetic anisotropy Keff varies\nwith D for a given system is important for technological applications. In a\nrecent paper [Appl. Phys. Lett. 110 (22), 222409 (2017)], the variation of Keff\nversus D in NPs of maghemite ({\\gamma}-Fe2O3) was best described by the Eq.:\nKeff = Kb + (6KS/D) +Ksh{[1-(2d/D)]-3 -1}, where Kb, KS, and Ksh are the\nanisotropy constants of spins in the core, surface layer, and a shell of\nthickness d, respectively. This core-shell-surface layer (CSSL) model is an\nextension of the often used core-surface layer (CSL) model described by Keff =\nKb + (6KS/D) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 282 (1994)]. The additional term involving\nKsh was found to be necessary to fit the data for smaller NPs of {\\gamma}-Fe2O3\nwith D < 5 nm. Here we check the validity of the CSSL model for metallic\nmagnetic NPs of Co, Ni, Fe and magnetite using Keff vs. D data from published\nliterature. Care was taken in selecting data only for those NPs for which the\neffects of interparticle interactions has been taken into account in\ndetermining Keff. The importance of the new CSSL model is that it describes\nwell the Keff vs. D variation for all particles sizes whereas the core-surface\nlayer model often fails for smaller particles with the notable exception of Fe\nNPs. The verification of the CSSL model for metallic NPs of Co, Ni, and\nmagnetite along with NPs of NiO and {\\gamma}-Fe2O3 validates its general\napplicability.\n", "  We study the flow of a thixotropic fluid around a cylinder. The rheology of\nthe fluid is described by means of a structural viscoplastic model based on the\nBingham constitutive equation, regularised using the Papanastasiou\nregularisation. The yield stress is assumed to vary linearly with the\nstructural parameter, which varies from zero (completely broken structure) to\none (fully developed skeleton structure), following a first-order rate equation\nwhich accounts for material structure break-down and build-up. The results were\nobtained numerically using the Finite Element Method. Simulations were\nperformed for a moderate Reynolds number of 45, so that flow recirculation is\nobserved behind the cylinder, but vortex shedding does not occur. The effects\nof the Bingham number and of the thixotropy parameters are studied. The results\nshow that the viscous character of the flow can be controlled within certain\nlimits through these parameters, despite the fact that the Reynolds number is\nfixed.\n", "  Can there be `peaceful coexistence' between quantum theory and special\nrelativity? Thirty years ago, Shimony hoped that isolating the culprit (i.e.\nthe false assumption) in proofs of Bell inequalities as Outcome Independence\nwould secure such peaceful coexistence: or, if not secure it, at least show a\nway---maybe the best or only way---to secure it.\n  In this paper, I begin by being sceptical of Shimony's approach, urging that\nwe need a relativistic solution to the quantum measurement problem (Section 2).\nThen I analyse Outcome Independence in Kent's realist one-world\nLorentz-invariant interpretation of quantum theory (Sections 3 and 4). Then I\nconsider Shimony's other condition, Parameter Independence, both in Kent's\nproposal and more generally, in the light of recent remarkable theorems by\nColbeck, Renner and Leegwater (Section 5).\n  For both Outcome Independence and Parameter Independence, there is a striking\nanalogy with the situation in pilot-wave theory. Finally, I will suggest that\nthese recent theorems make some kind of peaceful coexistence mandatory for\nsomeone who, like Shimony, endorses Parameter Independence.\n", "  A new non-universal abelian extension $\\mathrm{G_{SM}}\\otimes\n\\mathrm{U(1)}_{X}$ to the Standard Model free from chiral anomalies is\npresented. The new $X$ charges distinguish among generations so as the fermion\nmass matrices get zero-textures from the fermion mass hierarchy can be\nobtained. Regarding to neutrino physics, the model inclues Majorana fermions\nwhich induce see-saw mechanisms to get small neutrino masses. Moreover, the\nsuitability of the model is tested by searching for regions in the parameter\nspace which reproduce current neutrino oscillation data.\n", "  Diversity has an important, multifaceted role in the success of education. I\nhave used a corpus analysis of the first ten years of Physical Review Physics\nEducation Research to investigate the diversity, broadly defined, of physics\neducation research. The results show that the physics education research\ncommunity has extensively investigated the diversity of physics students,\nespecially with respect to gender. However, some less visible but still\nnumerous groups of students are little studied. On the whole, the contents of\nPhysical Review Physics Education Research reveals a robust research community\nin physics education, but there is room for growth with respect to working with\ndifferent kinds of students and the interactions between student attributes and\nteaching methods.\n", "  The interrogation of a sensor based on a highly birefringent film irradiated\nby an incident beam whose polarization is oriented 45o with respect to the\nnormal film axes is shown to display exceptional features and resolve some\noutstanding issues in interferometric sensing. The measured pattern as a\nfunction of wavelength is complicated displaying a superposition of Fabri-Perot\nand birefringence oscillations. By means of appropriate optical signal\nprocessing based on Fourier analysis, three different periodicity patterns can\nbe elucidated when sensing a single event, improving the sensing process in\nseveral ways: it allows sensing at several sensitivity scales, and it clears\nout the problems of phase and direction ambiguities. A novel effect is observed\nin which the phase displacement of different patterns move in opposite\ndirections as sensing takes place\n", "  This letter investigates the effect of shear on Rayleigh-Taylor instability\n(RTI). Even simple uniform shear strongly influences the instability; longer\nwaves are completely stabilized when density stratification is large (higher\nAtwood numbers). This apparently counter-intuitive result is due to the\npresence of Atwood number in the shear term. When the unstable density\ninterface is embedded in a shear layer, shear is again found to stabilize the\nRTI. However, this configuration introduces additional unstable shear\ninstability modes in the lower wavenumber regime. A new type of shear\ninstability, whose growth rate increases with Atwood number, plays a dominant\nrole, while Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), which was previously understood\nto be the only possible shear instability in this context, has little\nsignificance. Hence the billows observed in the nonlinear stages of RTI, which\nare usually attributed to KHI, may actually be the nonlinear manifestation of\nthis new instability.\n", "  Growth of the world population and the world economic growth were hyperbolic\nin the past 2,000,000 years. Recently, from around 1950, they started to be\ndiverted to slower trajectories but they are still close to the historical\nhyperbolic trajectories. Regional growth of population and regional economic\ngrowth were also hyperbolic. Hyperbolic growth can be slow over a long time and\nfast over a short time but it is still the same, monotonically increasing,\ngrowth. It is incorrect to interpret slow growth as stagnation and fast growth\nas explosion, each controlled by different mechanisms of growth. Hyperbolic\ngrowth has to be interpreted as a whole and the same mechanism has to be\napplied to the slow and to the fast growth. The Anthropocene is characterised\nby the rapid growth of population, rapid economic growth and rapid consumption\nof natural resources. The origin of the Anthropocene can be explained as the\nnatural consequence of hyperbolic growth. However, while its dramatic impacts\nbecame apparent only recently its starting point cannot be mathematically\ndetermined. Its beginning could be traced to the dawn of the existence of\nhominines. Its future is insecure because it is dictated by many critical\ntrends shaping the future or our planet, but notably because the size of the\nworld population is predicted to continue to increase at least until the end of\nthe current century to a possibly unsustainable level and because the world\neconomic growth follows now an unsustainable trajectory.\n", "  Local minimum appearing in the interionic pair interactions, when derived\nfrom local model pseudopotential, for Al (and some other polyvalent metals)\nremains as a long standing problem of clear understanding although some\nattempts are made by different authors. The origin of this feature of local\nminimum is systematically investigated in this article, considering both the\nchemical valence, Z, and the core radius, $R_{c}$ as variables. Ashcroft's\nempty core model is used to describe the interionic pair-potential, because, it\ndepends on these two parameters only. Results of this investigation show that\nmonovalent metals do not exhibit a local minimum at small $r$ but some\npolyvalent metals does where, the core radius plays the major role.\n", "  The reactor antineutrino energy spectra and flux were reevaluated during the\npreparation of the recent experiments devoted to the measurement of\n$\\theta_{13}$. Consequently some discrepancies between data and the theoretical\npredictions in reactor antineutrino experiments at short distances were\nobserved when using the new predicted flux and spectra. This problem has been\ncalled the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly (RAA), which together with the gallium\nanomaly, both show discrepancies with respect to the expectations at the $\\sim$\n3 $\\sigma$ level. Oscillations into a light sterile neutrino state ($\\Delta\nm^{2} \\sim 1eV^{2}$) could account for such deficits. The SoLid experiment has\nbeen conceived to give an unambiguous response to the hypothesis of a light\nsterile neutrino as the origin of the RAA. To this end, SoLid is searching for\nan oscillation pattern at short baselines (6-9 m) in the energy spectrum of the\n$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$'s emitted by the\nSCK\\raisebox{-0.9ex}{\\scalebox{2.8}{$\\cdot$}}CEN BR2 reactor in Belgium. The\ndetector uses a novel technology, combining PVT (cubes of 5$\\times$5$\\times$5\ncm$^3$) and $^6$LiF:ZnS (sheets $\\sim$ 250 $\\mu$m thickness) scintillators. It\nis highly segmented (modules of 10 planes of 16$\\times$16 cubes), and it's read\nout by a network of wavelength shifting fibers and SiPMs. The fine segmentation\nand the hybrid technology of the detector allows the clear identification of\nthe neutrino signals, reducing significantly backgrounds. Thus, a high\nexperimental sensitivity can be achieved. A 288 kg prototype was deployed in\n2015, showing the feasibility of the detection principle. A full scale detector\n(1.6 tons) is currently under construction, the data taking with the first\ndetector modules is expected by the end of 2017.\n", "  As an exotic quantum condensed matter, the topological insulator (TI) is a\nbulk-insulating material with a Dirac-type conducting surface state. Such\ndissipationless transport of topological surface states (TSSs) is protected by\nthe time-reversal symmetry, which leads to the potential applications in\nspintronics and quantum computations. Understanding the topological symplectic\ntransport of the Dirac fermions is a key issue to study and design the TI-based\ndevices. In this review, we introduce the progress on the universal conductance\nfluctuation (UCF) of TSSs. Firstly, we report the two dimensional UCF\nphenomenon in TIs, and its topological nature is demonstrated based on the\ninvestigations of UCF by angle-varying, in-plane field tuning and scaling\nanalysis. Secondly, we discuss the statistical symmetry of UCF in TIs. For a\nsingle TSS, the applied magnetic field will drive the system from a Gaussian\nsymplectic ensemble into a Gaussian unitary ensemble. It results a 2^0.5 fold\nincrease of the UCF amplitude. However, the experiment reveals a decreasing of\nthe UCF amplitude of 2^0.5 times. This is contradictory to the theoretical\nprediction. Actually, there are two TSSs and they are coherently coupled to\neach other in TIs since the sample's thickness is shorter than its bulk\ndephasing length. This leads to a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of the interface\ncoupling system without an external field. In such situation, the UCF amplitude\nwill decrease by 2^0.5 times with the field increasing. It is consistent with\nthe experimental results. Finally, the other progress on UCFs is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We propose a mean-field model of intermittent particle transport, where a\nparticle may be in one of two phases: the first is an active (ballistic) phase,\nwhen a particle runs with constant velocity in some direction, and the second\nis a passive (diffusive) phase, when the particle diffuses freely. The particle\ncan instantly change the phase of motion. When the particle is in the active\nphase the rate of transition to the passive phase depends, in general, on time\nfrom the beginning of the run, so the distribution of the free path is not\nexponential. When the particle is in the passive phase the transition rate is\nconstant, and diffusion is non-anomalous Brownian.\n", "  Available form factor parametrizations for $B\\rightarrow D^*l\\nu$ imply\ndifferent theoretical assumptions and different treatments of theoretical\nuncertainties. They give results for $\\vert V_{cb}\\vert$ whose central values\nare apart by up to $8\\%$. The way the Caprini Lellouch Neubert (CLN)\nparametrization has been used in experimental analyses sets theoretical\nuncertainties of the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) results on slope and\ncurvature of the form factor ratios $R_1$ and $R_2$ to zero. Furthermore, the\nrelation of curvature and slope of the axial form factor $A_1$ is fixed to the\nHQET central value. In view of the current experimental precision these\nuncertainties cannot be neglected any more. Using the Boyd Grinstein Lebed\n(BGL) parametrization and taking into account theoretical uncertainties in a\nconservative way, we extract $\\vert V_{cb}\\vert$ from recent preliminary Belle\ndata and the world average of the total branching ratio. We include an\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\%-20\\%)$ theoretical uncertainty of HQET input due to unknown\ncorrections beyond NLO which were neglected in all previous analyses. This is\nimportant for reliable extractions of $\\vert V_{cb}\\vert$ as well as precision\ntests of the Standard Model with robust predictions of the lepton flavor\nnonuniversality observable $R(D^*)$ and the $\\tau$ polarization asymmetry\n$P_{\\tau}$. Including input from Light Cone Sum Rules (LCSRs) we find $\\vert\nV_{cb}\\vert = 40.6\\left(^{+1.2}_{-1.3}\\right)\\cdot 10^{-3}$, $R(D^*) =\n0.260(8)$ and $P_{\\tau}=-0.47(4)$. Without LCSRs we find $\\vert V_{cb}\\vert =\n41.5(1.3)\\cdot 10^{-3}$ and the same results for $R(D^*)$ and $P_{\\tau}$. The\n$R(D^*)$ anomaly is persistent, but its statistical significance is slightly\nreduced to 2.6$\\sigma$.\n", "  Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is an important quantum\ncommunication branch, which realizes the secure information transmission\ndirectly without encryption and decryption processes. Recently, two table-top\nexperiments have demonstrated the principle of QSDC. Here, we report the first\nlong-distance QSDC experiment, including the security test, information\nencoding, fiber transmission and decoding. After the fiber transmission of 0.5\nkm, quantum state fidelities of the two polarization entangled Bell states are\n91% and 88%, respectively, which are used for information coding. We\ntheoretically analyze the performance of the QSDC system based on current\noptical communication technologies, showing that QSDC over fiber links of\nseveral tens kilometers could be expected. It demonstrates the potential of\nlong-distance QSDC and supports its future applications on quantum\ncommunication networks.\n", "  We review (anti)evaporation phenomena within the context of quantum gravity\nand extended theories of gravity. The (anti)evaporation effect is an\ninstability of the black hole horizon discovered in many different scenarios:\nquantum dilaton-gravity, $f(R)$-gravity, $f(T)$-gravity, string inspired black\nholes and brane-world cosmology. Evaporating and antievaporating black holes\nseem to have completely different thermodynamical features compared to standard\nsemiclassical black holes. The purpose of this review is to provide an\nintroduction to conceptual and technical aspects of (anti)evaporation effects,\nwhile discussing problems that are still open.\n", "  We construct a $6$ derivative holographic superconductor model in the\n$4$-dimensional bulk spacetimes, in which the normal state describes a quantum\ncritical (QC) phase. The phase diagram $(\\gamma_1,\\hat{T}_c)$ and the\ncondensation as the function of temperature are worked out numerically. We\nobserve that with the decrease of the coupling parameter $\\gamma_1$, the\ncritical temperature $\\hat{T}_c$ decreases and the formation of charged scalar\nhair becomes harder. We also calculate the optical conductivity. An appealing\ncharacteristic is a wider extension of the superconducting energy gap,\ncomparing with that of $4$ derivative theory. It is expected that this\nphenomena can be observed in the real materials of high temperature\nsuperconductor. Also the Homes' law in our present models with $4$ and $6$\nderivative corrections is explored. We find that in certain range of parameters\n$\\gamma$ and $\\gamma_1$, the experimentally measured value of the universal\nconstant $C$ in Homes' law can be obtained.\n", "  The aim of this letter is to {present analytical method to} quantitatively\naddress the influence of a focusing illumination on the transmission\n/reflection properties of a {metasurface illuminated by a finite-size beam}. In\nfact, most theoretical and numerical studies are performed by considering an\ninfinite periodic structure illuminated by a plane wave. In practice, one deals\nwith a finite-size illumination and structure. Combination of the angular\nspectrum expansion with a monomodal modal method is performed to determine the\nbeam size needed to acquire efficient properties of a Metasurface that behaves\nas Anisotropic Plate MAP Interesting results show that the beam-size can be as\nsmall as 5X5 periods to recover the results of a plane wave. Other results also\nshow that the beam-size could be used as an extrinsic parameter to enhance the\nMAP performance and to finely adjust its expected properties (birefringence\nand/or transmission coefficient).\n", "  We propose the method for obtaining invariants of arbitrary representations\nof Lie groups that reduces this problem to known problems of linear algebra.\nThe basis of this method is the idea of a special extension of the\nrepresentation space, which allows us to regard it as a coalgebra of some Lie\nalgebra. In its turn, this allows us to reduce the problem of constructing\ninvariants of a given representation to the problem of constructing invariants\nof the coadjoint representation of the corresponding Lie group. In our previous\npaper it was shown that this problem can always be solved in a natural way by\nthe methods of linear algebra.\n", "  A layer of vegetation over the soil surface absorbs microwave radiation\nemitted from the soil and some objects located under the vegetation canopy.\nThis paper investigates the microwave propagation process within the vegetation\nlayer and evaluate the attenuation coefficients. For this purpose, laboratory\nexperimental test bench is synthesized. It is based on the special rectangular\ncamera-waveguide with transmission and receiving wide band horn antennas and\nallows the study of the attenuation coefficient dependence on the frequency of\n0.8-10 GHz range and water content in the different vegetation elements.\nEvaluations of attenuation coefficients are implemented over a wide frequency\nrange for deciduous and coniferous forests with separation consideration of the\nbranches and trunks as the canopy fragments.\n", "  Electronic stopping of slow protons in ZnO, VO2 (metal and semiconductor\nphases), HfO2, and Ta2O5 was investigated experimentally. As a comparison of\nthe resulting stopping cross sections (SCS) to data for Al2O3 and SiO2 reveals,\nelectronic stopping of slow protons does not correlate with electronic\nproperties of the specific material such as band gap energies. Instead, the\noxygen 2p states are decisive, as corroborated by density functional theory\ncalculations of the electronic densities of states. Hence, at low ion\nvelocities the SCS of an oxide primarily scales with its oxygen density.\n", "  Calculations of the emission spectrum of a homogeneous plane layer of pure\nhydrogen plasma taking into account nonlinear effects (the influence of\nbremsstrahlung and recombination radiation of the layer itself on its Menzel\nfactors) [Morchenko et al., Ap&SS, Vol. 357, article id. 119 (2015)] show that\nthe blue component of the optical continuum during the impulsive phase of large\nflares on dMe stars originates from the near-photospheric layers [Grinin and\nSobolev, Afz, Vol. 13, 587 (1977)]. The gas behind the front of a stationary\nradiative shock wave propagating in the red dwarf chromosphere toward the\nphotosphere is not capable of generating the blackbody radiation observed at\nthe maximum brightness of the flares.\n", "  Quantum phase slips are the primary excitations in one-dimensional\nsuperfluids and superconductors at low temperatures. They have been well\ncharacterized in most condensed-matter systems, and signatures of their\nexistence has been recently observed in superfluids based on quantum gases too.\nIn this review we briefly summarize the main results obtained on the\ninvestigation of phase slips from superconductors to quantum gases. In\nparticular we focus our attention on recent experimental results of the\ndissipation in one-dimensional Bose superfluids flowing along a shallow\nperiodic potential, which show signatures of quantum phase slips.\n", "  Motivated by the M-theory compactification physics, we study a type IIA\nsuperstring quiver model with an open string axion field associated with the\nU(1)_{PQ} Peccei-Quinn global symmetry using D6-brane physics. This realization\nextends the symmetry of the SM-Like and contributes to the mediation of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. The associated axion energy scales are\napproached in terms of D2 and D6-branes in type IIA compactifications on\nCalabi-Yau threeforlds. Using the fermion mass scales as well as string theory\nresults, the allowed axion window is discussed in terms of intersecting\nD6-branes wrapping 3-cycles belonging to the middle cohomology of the type IIA\ninternal space. The non-perturbative effect of the open string axion sector is\ndealt with using a D2-brane wrapping a 3-cycle producing (1+3)-dimensional\nstringy instantons. According to the known data, the vacuum expectation value\nof the axion and the mass scale of the involved scalar provide a probe of the\nstringy physics effect in the SM and a possible axionic dark matter candidate.\n", "  Flavor physics has been crucial in the development of particle physics and it\nwill keep being so in the future. Nowadays, this kind of processes, in\nparticular lepton flavor changing observed in neutrino oscillations, give us\nthe clearest evidence of the fact that the Standard Model of fundamental\ninteractions needs to be modified. Some of the most popular theories that try\nto asses this issue postulate the existence of new heavy right-handed\nneutrinos, with masses in the energy range that the LHC experiment is currently\nexploring. In this thesis, we study the connection between the possible\nexistence of these neutrinos and charged lepton flavor changing physics. We\nconsider the inverse seesaw model as a particular realization of a low scale\nseesaw model and analyze its lepton flavor violating phenomenology, in\nparticular the Higgs and Z boson decays to two charged leptons of different\nflavor. Moreover, we also explore the possibility of having new exotic lepton\nflavor violating signals at the LHC, coming from the production and decay of\nthese new heavy neutrinos.\n", "  A multi-bit digital weight cell for high-performance, inference-only\nnon-GPU-like neuromorphic accelerators is presented. The cell is designed with\nsimplicity of peripheral circuitry in mind. Non-volatile storage of weights\nwhich eliminates the need for DRAM access is based on FeFETs and is purely\ndigital. The Multiply-and-Accumulate operation is performed using passive\nresistors, gated by FeFETs. The resulting weight cell offers a high degree of\nlinearity and a large ON/OFF ratio. The key performance tradeoffs are\ninvestigated, and the device requirements are elucidated.\n", "  Current status of experimental investigations of rare single beta decays\n(48Ca, 50V, 96Zr, 113Cd, 113mCd, 115In, 123Te, 180mTa, 222Rn) is reviewed.\nNuclei which decay through single beta decay very often constitute backgrounds\nin studies of rare effects like double beta decay, solar neutrinos or dark\nmatter. Summary of correction factors used in description of forbidden beta\ndecays is also briefly given.\n", "  Rapid expansions of their size and frequent changes of their topology make it\ndifficult to observe and analyze complex networks. We explore the properties of\nthe Hankel matrix and propose an algorithm for calculating the final\nsynchronization state that uses a local observation of a single node for a time\nperiod significantly shorter than the synchronization process. We find that\nsynchronization can be achieved more quickly than the routine rhythm. This\nfinding refines our understanding of the abundant ultrafast synchronization\nphenomena observed in nature, and it enables the efficient design of\nself-aligned robots.\n", "  We demonstrate that a generative adversarial network can be trained to\nproduce Ising model configurations in distinct regions of phase space. In\ntraining a generative adversarial network, the discriminator neural network\nbecomes very good a discerning examples from the training set and examples from\nthe testing set. We demonstrate that this ability can be used as an anomaly\ndetector, producing estimations of operator values along with a confidence in\nthe prediction.\n", "  We study the critical point for finite temperature Nf=3 QCD using several\ntemporal lattice sizes up to 10. In the study, the Iwasaki gauge action and\nnon-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson fermions are employed. We estimate the\ncritical temperature and the upper bound of the critical pseudo-scalar meson\nmass.\n", "  The QCD Axion is a particle postulated to exist since the 1970s to explain\nthe Strong-CP problem in particle physics. It could also account for all of the\nobserved Dark Matter in the universe. The Axion Resonant InterAction DetectioN\nExperiment (ARIADNE) experiment intends to detect the QCD axion by sensing the\nfictitious \"magnetic field\" created by its coupling to spin. The experiment\nmust be sensitive to magnetic fields below the $10^{-19}$ T level to achieve\nits design sensitivity, necessitating tight control of the experiment's\nmagnetic environment. We describe a method for controlling three aspects of\nthat environment which would otherwise limit the experimental sensitivity.\nFirstly, a system of superconducting magnetic shielding is described to screen\nordinary magnetic noise from the sample volume at the $10^8$ level. Secondly, a\nmethod for reducing magnetic field gradients within the sample up to $10^2$\ntimes is described, using a simple and cost-effective design geometry. Thirdly,\na novel coil design is introduced which allows the generation of fields similar\nto those produced by Helmholtz coils in regions directly abutting\nsuperconducting boundaries. The methods may be generally useful for magnetic\nfield control near superconducting boundaries in other experiments where\nsimilar considerations apply.\n", "  The introduction of manganite buffer layers, La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 (LSMO) in\nparticular, at the metallic interface between SrTiO3 (STO) and another band\ninsulator suppresses the carrier density of the interfacial two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG) and improves significantly the electron mobility. However,\nthe mechanisms underlying the extreme mobility enhancement remain elusive.\nHerein, we used 18O isotope exchanged SrTi18O3 as substrates to create 2DEG at\nroom temperature with and without the LSMO buffer layer. By mapping the oxygen\nprofile across the interface between STO18 and disordered LaAlO3 or\nyttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), we provide unambiguous evidence that redox\nreactions occur at oxide interfaces even grown at room temperature. Moreover,\nthe manganite buffer layer not only suppresses the carrier density but also\nstrongly suppresses the oxygen exchange dynamics of the STO substrate, which\nlikely prevents the reduction of STO during the formation of the 2DEG. The\nunderlying mechanism on the enhanced electron mobility at buffered oxide\ninterfaces is also discussed.\n", "  Polar discontinuities and redox reactions provide alternative paths to create\ntwo-dimensional electron liquids (2DELs) at oxide interfaces. Herein, we report\nhigh mobility 2DELs at interfaces involving SrTiO3 (STO) achieved using polar\nLa7/8Sr1/8MnO3 (LSMO) buffer layers to manipulate both polarities and redox\nreactions from disordered overlayers grown at room temperature. Using resonant\nx-ray reflectometry experiments, we quantify redox reactions from oxide\noverlayers on STO as well as polarity induced electronic reconstruction at\nepitaxial LSMO/STO interfaces. The analysis reveals how these effects can be\ncombined in a STO/LSMO/disordered film trilayer system to yield high mobility\nmodulation doped 2DELs, where the buffer layer undergoes a partial\ntransformation from perovskite to brownmillerite structure. This uncovered\ninterplay between polar discontinuities and redox reactions via buffer layers\nprovides a new approach for the design of functional oxide interfaces.\n", "  The classical Galois theory deals with certain finite algebraic extensions\nand establishes a bijective order reversing correspondence between the\nintermediate fields and the subgroups of a group of permutations called the\nGalois group of the extension. It has been the dream of many mathematicians at\nthe end of the nineteenth century to generalize these results to systems of\nalgebraic partial differential (PD) equations and the corresponding finitely\ngenerated differential extensions, in order to be able to add the word\ndifferential in front of any classical statement. The achievement of the\nPicard-Vessiot theory by E. Kolchin between 1950 and 1970 is now well known.\nThe purpose of this paper is to sketch the general theory for such differential\nextensions and algebraic pseudogroups by means of new methods mixing\ndifferential algebra, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. As already\ndiscovered by E. Vessiot in 1904 through the use of automorphic systems, a\nconcept never acknowledged, the main point is to notice that the Galois theory\n(old and new) is mainly a study of principal homogeneous spaces (PHS) for\nalgebraic groups or pseudogroups. Hence, all the formal theory of PD equations\ndevelopped by D.C. Spencer around 1970 must be used together with modern\nalgebraic geometry, in particular tensor products of rings and fields. However,\nthe combination of these new tools is not sufficient and we have to create the\nanalogue for Lie pseudogroups of the so-called invariant derivations introduced\nby A. Bialynicki-Birula after 1960 in the study of algebraic groups and fields\nwith derivations. We shall finally prove the usefulness of the resulting\ndifferential Galois theory through striking applications to mechanics,\nrevisiting shell theory, chain theory, the Frenet-Serret formulas and the\nintegration of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.\n", "  Currently, lower limb robotic rehabilitation is widely developed, However,\nthe devices used so far seem to not have a uniform criteria for their design,\nbecause, on the contrary, each developed mechanism is often presented as if it\ndoes not take into account the criteria used in previous designs. On the other\nhand, the diagnosis of lower limb from robotic devices has been little studied.\nThis chapter presents a guide for the design of robotic devices in diagnosis of\nlower limbs, taking into account the mobility of the human leg and the\ntechniques used by physiotherapists in the execution of exercises and the\nrehabilitation of rehabilitation and diagnosis tests, as well as the\nrecommendations made by various authors, among other aspects. The proposed\nguide is illustrated through a case study based on a parallel robot RPU+3UPS\nable to make movements that are applied during the processes of rehabilitation\nand diagnosis. The proposal presents advantages over some existing devices such\nas its load capacity that can support, and also allows you to restrict the\nmovement in directions required by the rehabilitation and the diagnosis\nmovements.\n", "  Reaction constants in traditional Michaelis-Menten type enzyme kinetics are\nmost often determined through a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot. While such a\ngraphical plot is sometimes good to achieve the end, it is always better to go\nfor a few numerical tests that can assess the quality of the data set being\nused and hence offer more reliable measures of the quantities sought,\nfurnishing along with appropriate error estimates. In this context, we\nspecifically highlight how cases may appear with negative reaction constants\nand explore the origin of such bizarre findings.\n", "  A novel plastic scintillator, referred to as J-PET scintillator, has been\ndeveloped for the application in the digital positron emission tomography\n(PET). The novelty of the concept lies in application of the\n2-(4-styrylphenyl)benzoxazole as a wavelength shifter. To date, the chemical\ncompound has not been used as scintillator additive. A role of wavelength\nshifter is to shift the scintillation spectrum towards longer wavelengths\nmaking it more suitable for applications in scintillators of long strips\ngeometry because of larger attenuation length, and light detection with digital\nsilicon photomultipliers. In the thesis method of scintillators development and\ncharacterization of their properties are presented as well as synthesis method\nof the novel wavelength shifter. The optimal concentration of the novel\nwavelength shifter was established by maximizing the light output. Performance\nof scintillator, considering light emission spectrum, light emission\nefficiency, rising and decay times of the scintillation pulses were analyzed\nand compared to state of the art commercially available plastic scintillators.\nStructure of J-PET scintillators was studied and discussed.\n", "  We review the recent progress in the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis which includes\nthe standard and non-standard theory of cosmology, effects of neutrino\ndegeneracy, and inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis within the framework of a\nFriedmann model. As for a non-standard theory of gravitation, we adopt a\nBrans-Dicke theory which incorporate a cosmological constant. We constrain\nvarious parameters associated with each subject.\n", "  Fast radio bursts are a new class of transient radio phenomena currently\ndetected as millisecond radio pulses with very high dispersion measures. As new\nradio surveys begin searching for FRBs a large population is expected to be\ndetected in real-time, triggering a range of multi-wavelength and\nmulti-messenger telescopes to search for repeating bursts and/or associated\nemission. Here we propose a method for disseminating FRB triggers using Virtual\nObservatory Events (VOEvents). This format was developed and is used\nsuccessfully for transient alerts across the electromagnetic spectrum and for\nmulti-messenger signals such as gravitational waves. In this paper we outline a\nproposed VOEvent standard for FRBs that includes the essential parameters of\nthe event and where these parameters should be specified within the structure\nof the event. An additional advantage to the use of VOEvents for FRBs is that\nthe events can automatically be ingested into the FRB Catalogue (FRBCAT)\nenabling real-time updates for public use. We welcome feedback from the\ncommunity on the proposed standard outlined below and encourage those\ninterested to join the nascent working group forming around this topic.\n", "  We show that the interaction between a superconducting order parameter and\nthe magnetic moment of an atomic cluster in a two-dimensional s-wave\nsuperconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling generates magnetic anisotropy\nthat can be stronger or comparable to the magnetic anisotropy due to the\ncrystal field and the shape of the cluster. Transport current through the\nsuperconductor produces the effective magnetic field acting on the cluster's\nmagnetic moment. The direction of the effective field depends on the direction\nof the current, thus allowing one to manipulate the magnetic moment by the\nsuperconducting current. Due to the large density of the superconducting\ncurrent this method of magnetization reversal can be more advantageous at low\ntemperatures than the spin-transfer torque method that requires a large\nspin-polarized current through a normal metal.\n", "  Recent theory results on direct production of resonances with positive charge\nconjugation in electron-positron annihilation are reviewed. The strong model\ndependence is emphasized, with predictions varying between 0.03 eV and 0.43 eV\nfor the charmonium state with $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ and between 0.16 eV and 4.25 eV\nfor the state with $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. For the state with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ the\ncross section is of $\\cal{O}$ $(m^2_e/M^2_{\\chi})$ and thus negligeable for all\npractical purpose. The importance of the relative phase of the production\namplitude is emphasized.\n", "  Topological and geometrical methods are used to calculate the\npseudorotational part of the vibronic spectrum for an electronic triplet of an\noctahedral, tetrahedral, or icosahedral molecule. The calculations take into\naccount the nontrivial geometry inherent in the Jahn-Teller effect. It is shown\nthat the Jahn-Teller effect gives rise to a geometry, which is related to the\nisoparametric geometry of E. Cartan. The pseudorotational spectra correspond to\nthe spectra of connection Laplacians on nontrivial line bundles over base\nspaces with this geometry. Globally, the isoparametric submanifolds form a\ntotally geodesic foliation of S^4 and the spectral flow of these connection\nLaplacians on this foliation is computed.\n", "  In this work, we present a new method for predicting bioaccumulation factor\nof organic molecules. The approach utilizes 3D convolutional neural network\n(ActivNet4) that uses solvent spatial distributions around solutes as input.\nThese spatial distributions are obtained by a molecular theory called\nthree-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM). We have shown\nthat the method allows one to achieve a good accuracy of prediction. Our\nresearch demonstrates that combination of molecular theories with modern\nmachine learning approaches can be effectively used for predicting properties\nthat are otherwise inaccessible to purely physics-based models.\n", "  The parallel-magnetic-field $H_\\parallel$ dependence of the superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_c$ is studied for ultrathin films of In, Bi, and Al\ngrown on GaAs(110). In the case of In films in the monolayer regime, $T_c$\nexhibits a quadratic-like $H_\\parallel$ dependence, which is one order of\nmagnitude stronger than that previously observed in monolayer Pb films by the\npresent authors [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 057005 (2013)]. The results are well\nreproduced by a model developed for an inhomogeneous two-dimensional\nsuperconducting state in the presence of a moderate Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction. The Rashba spin splitting is estimated to be 0.04 eV, which is\nmuch smaller than that expected for monolayer Pb films. In a few-monolayer Bi\nfilm, the suppression of $T_c$ with increasing $H_\\parallel$ is comparable to\nthat in monolayer Pb films. On the other hand, much stronger suppression, which\nis attributed to the Pauli paramagnetic effect, was observed for the Al film.\n", "  A comparative experimental study of pulsed laser ablation in vacuum of two\nbinary semiconductors, zinc oxide and indium phosphide, has been performed\nusing IR-and visible laser pulses with particular attention to cluster\ngeneration. Neutral and cationic Zn\\_n O\\_m and In\\_n P\\_m particles of various\nstoichiometry have been produced and investigated by time-of-flight mass\nspectrometry. At ZnO ablation, large cationic (n>9) and all neutral clusters\nare mainly stoichiometric in the ablation plume. In contrast, indium phosphide\nclusters are strongly indium-rich with In\\_4 P being a magic cluster. Analysis\nof the plume composition upon laser exposure has revealed congruent\nvaporization of ZnO and a disproportionate loss of phosphorus by the irradiated\nInP surface. Plume expansion conditions under ZnO ablation are shown to be\nfavourable for stoichiometric cluster formation. A delayed vaporization of\nphosphorus under InP ablation has been observed that results in generation of\noff-stoichiometric clusters.\n", "  In an Euclidean SU(2) $\\otimes$ U(1) gauge theory without fermions, we\nidentify scalar-field variables, functionals of the gauge fields and coming in\ndifferent representations of isospin, which (i) are of mass dimension one in\n$d=4$, (ii) couple to their parent gauge fields through suitable\ngauge-covariant derivatives, and (iii) can be endowed with a hypercharge\ndespite their parents having none. They can be interpreted as projections of\nthe gauge vectors onto an orthonormal basis that is defined by the fields\nthemselves. We inquire as to whether these scalars can perform the usual tasks,\nnormally fulfilled by external scalar fields, of spontaneous symmetry breaking\nand mass generation through vacuum expectation values. The gauge Lagrangian,\nexpressed in terms of these scalars, automatically has quartic and cubic terms;\nan extra coupling constant for quartic scalar self-interactions is not needed.\nThere are nine massive Higgs particles, a neutral triplet at a mass of $m_Z\n\\sqrt{2} \\,\\approx \\, 129$ GeV, and three pairs of conjugate charged ones at\n$m_W \\sqrt{2} \\, \\approx \\, 114$ GeV; another triplet of neutrals remains\nmassless. On the other hand among the four scalars populating the\npotential-energy minimum, there are now two electrically neutral fields capable\nof forming VEVs; the ratio between the latter is a new and unknown parameter.\nFormation of the heavy-vector masses is then possible, but the derivation is\nless predictive than in the standard scenario. It also requires a somewhat more\nelaborate mixing pattern in defining the physical, charged and neutral vector\nfields.\n", "  The detection of production of a pair of Higgs bosons before the end of LHC\noperation would be clear evidence of New Physics (NP). As searches for\nnon-resonant production of Higgs pairs are being designed it is of particular\nimportance to be able to conveniently present current experimental results in\nterms of limits in the most 'model-independent' fashion possible. In this\narticle we provide an analytic parametrization of the {\\it differential}\nHiggs-pair production at the LHC in the effective field theory (EFT) extension\nof the SM. It results from a fit to the theory prediction for the $gg \\to hh$\ncross section at the 13\\,TeV at the LHC. Subsequently the resulting formula is\nused for a reweighing technique that allows to recast exclusion bounds from\nATLAS and CMS HH$\\to\\gamma\\gamma\\,b\\bar{b}$ searches to any point of the\nconsidered EFT parameter space. We demonstrate with a fast simulation of the\nLHC detectors that with this approach it is possible to cover the continuously\nof the EFT parameter space, taking correctly into account the efficiencies of\nsignal selections, without the necessity of rerunning a large number of full\ndetector simulations. Finally, the resulting exclusion bounds are confronted to\nseveral explicit models such as setups with additional scalars, including 2HDM,\nvector-like fermions, and minimal composite Higgs models, mapped to the EFT.\n", "  We show that the general and numerically exact Hierarchy of Pure States\nmethod (HOPS) is very well applicable to calculate the reduced dynamics of an\nopen quantum system. In particular we focus on environments with a sub-Ohmic\nspectral density (SD) resulting in an algebraic decay of the bath correlation\nfunction (BCF). The universal applicability of HOPS, reaching from weak to\nstrong coupling for zero and non-zero temperature, is demonstrated by solving\nthe spin-boson model for which we find perfect agreement with other methods,\neach one suitable for a special regime of parameters. The challenges arising in\nthe strong coupling regime are not only reflected in the computational effort\nneeded for the HOPS method to converge but also in the necessity for an\nimportance sampling mechanism, accounted for by the non-linear variant of HOPS.\nIn order to include non-zero temperature effects in the strong coupling regime\nwe found that it is highly favorable for the HOPS method to use the zero\ntemperature BCF and include temperature via a stochastic Hermitian contribution\nto the system Hamiltonian.\n", "  Electron-acoustic waves occur in space and laboratory plasmas where two\ndistinct electron populations exist, namely cool and hot electrons. The\nobservations revealed that the hot electron distribution often has a\nlong-tailed suprathermal (non-Maxwellian) form. The aim of the present study is\nto investigate how various plasma parameters modify the electron-acoustic\nstructures. We have studied the electron-acoustic waves in a collisionless and\nunmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial electrons, hot suprathermal\nelectrons, and mobile ions. First, we started with a cold one-fluid model, and\nwe extended it to a warm model, including the electron thermal pressure.\nFinally, the ion inertia was included in a two-fluid model. The linear\ndispersion relations for electron-acoustic waves depicted a strong dependence\nof the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality. A nonlinear\n(Sagdeev) pseudopotential technique was employed to investigate the existence\nof electron-acoustic solitary waves, and to determine how their characteristics\ndepend on various plasma parameters. The results indicate that the thermal\npressure deeply affects the electron-acoustic solitary waves. Only negative\npolarity waves were found to exist in the one-fluid model, which become\nnarrower as deviation from the Maxwellian increases, while the wave amplitude\nat fixed soliton speed increases. However, for a constant value of the true\nMach number, the amplitude decreases for increasing suprathermality. It is also\nfound that the ion inertia has a trivial role in the supersonic domain, but it\nis important to support positive polarity waves in the subsonic domain.\n", "  We proposed a novel multilayer structure to realize the deterministic\nswitching of perpendicularly magnetized layers by spin orbital torque from the\nspin Hall effect through stray field engineering. In our design, a pinned\nmagnetic layer is introduced under the heave metal separated by an insulator,\ngenerating an in-plane stray field in the perpendicularly magnetized layer. We\nhave confirmed the deterministic switching of perpendicularly magnetized layers\nthrough micromagnetic simulation and theoretical analysis. The in-plane stray\nfield accounts for the deterministic switching exhibited in the structure and\nthe reversal ultimate state of the magnetic layer is predictable when the\napplied spin current density is above the critical spin current density.\nMoreover, the stray field is easily tunable in a wide range by adjusting the\nsaturation magnetization and dimensions of the pinned layer, and can\naccommodate different perpendicularly magnetized materials without any external\nmagnetic field.\n", "  For inhomogeneous interacting electronic systems under a time-dependent\nelectromagnetic perturbation, we derive the linear equation for response\nfunctions in a quantum mechanical manner. It is a natural extension of the\noriginal semi-classical Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjoelander (STLS) approach for an\nelectron gas. The factorization ansatz for the two-particle distribution is an\nindispensable ingredient in the STLS approaches for determination of the\nresponse function and the pair correlation function. In this study, we choose\nan analytically solvable interacting two-electron system as the target for\nwhich we examine the validity of the approximation. It is demonstrated that the\nSTLS response function reproduces well the exact one for low-energy\nexcitations. The interaction energy contributed from the STLS response function\nis also discussed.\n", "  We present an implementation of the relativistic quantum-chemical density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach based on a matrix-product\nformalism. Our approach allows us to optimize matrix product state (MPS) wave\nfunctions including a variational description of scalar-relativistic effects\nand spin-orbit coupling from which we can calculate, for example, first-order\nelectric and magnetic properties in a relativistic framework. While\ncomplementing our pilot implementation (S. Knecht et al., J. Chem. Phys., 140,\n041101 (2014)) this work exploits all features provided by its underlying\nnon-relativistic DMRG implementation based on an matrix product state and\noperator formalism. We illustrate the capabilities of our relativistic DMRG\napproach by studying the ground-state magnetization as well as current density\nof a paramagnetic $f^9$ dysprosium complex as a function of the active orbital\nspace employed in the MPS wave function optimization.\n", "  SiC/SiC composite tubes are studied as materials for nuclear fuel cladding. A\nthorough understanding on the mechanisms of damage to this material requires\nboth an experimental and a numerical study. In situ tensile tests were\nperformed under X-ray tomography at the SOLEIL synchrotron. Post processing\nmethods have been developed to analyze the microstructure, measure the\ndeformation and characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the damage\nmechanisms inside the material. The tomographic images provide 3D descriptions\non the microstructure, which are direct input data for the numerical simulation\nbased on FFT. The use of real microstructures makes it possible to combine the\nsimulation results directly with the experimental observations.\n", "  Terahertz (THz) radiation meaning electromagnetic radiation in the range from\n0.1 THz (3 mm) to 10 THz (30 mu) has the unique advantage of easily penetrating\nmany obstructions while being non-hazardous to organic tissue since it is\nnon-ionizing. A shortcoming of this domain is the limited availability of\nhigh-sensitivity detector arrays respective THz cameras with >1k pixels. To\novercome the imaging limitations of the THz domain, compressive imaging in\ncombination with an optically controllable THz spatial light modulator is a\npromising approach especially when used in a single-pixel imaging modality. The\nimaging fidelity, performance and speed of this approach depend crucially on\nthe imaging patterns also called masks and their properties used in the imaging\nprocess. Therefore, in this paper, it is investigated how the image quality\nafter reconstruction is specifically influenced by the different mask types and\ntheir properties in a compressive imaging modality. The evaluation derives\nspecific guidelines for the use in THz single-pixel imaging setups respective\nTHz single-pixel cameras employing optically controllable THz spatial light\nmodulators. As an outlook, a method is suggested that builds upon the results\npresented in this text and extends the discussed advantages to an improved\ncompressive imaging setting fit for stand-off security imaging applications aka\nsingle-pixel detector Body Scanners.\n", "  In finite many-body quantum systems such as nuclei, atoms, mesoscopic systems\nlike quantum dots and small metallic grains, interacting spin systems modeling\nquantum computing core and BEC, the interparticle interactions are essentially\ntwo-body in nature. Therefore, it is more appropriate to represent the complex\nHamiltonian of these systems by random ensembles that incorporate the two-body\nnature of interactions. These ensembles are generically called embedded\nGaussian ensembles (EGEs). The aim of the present thesis is to identify and\nsystematically analyze many different physically relevant EGEs with symmetries\nby considering a variety of quantities and measures that are important for\nisolated finite interacting quantum systems.\n", "  The effect of network chain distribution on the mechanical behavior of\nelastomers is one of the long-standing problems in rubber mechanics. The\nclassical theory of rubber elasticity is built upon the assumption of entropic\nelasticity of networks whose constitutive strands are of uniform length. The\nkinetic theories for vulcanization, computer simulations, and indirect\nexperimental measurements all indicate that the microstructure of vulcanizates\nis made of polymer strands with a random distribution of length. The\npolydispersity in strand length is expected to control the mechanical strength\nof rubber as the overloaded short strands break at small deformations and\ntransfer the load to the longer strands. The purpose of the contributions\npresented in this thesis is to present simple theories of rubber mechanics that\ntake into account the length distribution of strands and its effect on\nelasticity and the onset of bulk failure in unfilled and filled elastomers. In\nunfilled system, the population of short chains is identified as the culprits\nfor damage initiation. Upon deformation of a polydisperse network, shorter\nstrands break at considerably smaller stretches compared to the longer ones.\nThe network alteration continues concurrent with increasing deformation and\ncontrols the onset of mechanical failure. In the filled networks, the\ndegradation in network mechanical behavior is assumed to be controlled by the\nadhesive failure of the short strands adsorbed onto the filler surface. The\nfinite extensibility of the short adsorbed strands is a key determinant of\nmechanical strength.\n", "  The two-flavor quark-meson model is used as a low-energy effective model for\nQCD to study inhomogeneous chiral condensates at finite quark chemical\npotential $\\mu$ in a constant magnetic background $B$. We determine the\nparameters of the model by matching the meson and quark masses, and the pion\ndecay constant to their physical values using the on-shell and modified minimal\nsubtraction schemes. We calculate the free energy in the mean-field\napproximation for a chiral density wave using dimensional regularization. The\nsystem has a surprisingly rich phase structure.\n", "  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes study the highest energy (up to tens\nof TeV) photon emission coming from nearby and distant astrophysical sources,\nthus providing valuable results from searches for Lorentz Invariance Violation\n(LIV) effects. Highly variable, energetic and distant sources such as Pulsars\nand AGNs are the best targets for the Time-of-Flight LIV studies. However, the\nlimited number of observations of AGN flares or of high-energy pulsed emission\ngreatly restricts the potential of such studies, especially any potential LIV\neffects as a function of redshift. To address these issues, an inter-experiment\nworking group has been established by the three major collaborations taking\ndata with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC and\nVERITAS) with the aim to increase sensitivity to any effects of LIV, together\nwith an improved control of systematic uncertainties, by sharing data samples\nand developing joint analysis methods. This will allow an increase in the\nnumber of available sources and to perform a sensitive search for redshift\ndependencies. This presentation reviews the first combined maximum likelihood\nmethod analyses using simu- lations of published source observations done in\nthe past with H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS. The results from analyses based on\ncombined maximum likelihood methods, the strategies to deal with data from\ndifferent types of sources and instruments, as well as future plans will be\npresented.\n", "  Although it was demonstrated that discrete molecular levels determine the\nsign and magnitude of the thermoelectric effect in single-molecule junctions,\nfull electrostatic control of these levels has not been achieved to date. Here,\nwe show that graphene nanogaps combined with gold microheaters serve as a\ntestbed for studying single-molecule thermoelectricity. Reduced screening of\nthe gate electric field compared to conventional metal electrodes allows\ncontrol of the position of the dominant transport orbital by hundreds of meV.\nWe find that the power factor of graphene-fullerene junctions can be tuned over\nseveral orders of magnitude to a value close to the theoretical limit of an\nisolated Breit-Wigner resonance. Furthermore, our data suggest that the power\nfactor of an isolated level is only given by the tunnel coupling to the leads\nand temperature. These results open up new avenues for exploring\nthermoelectricity and charge transport in individual molecules and highlight\nthe importance of level alignment and coupling to the electrodes for optimum\nenergy conversion in organic thermoelectric materials.\n", "  With the confirmed detection of short gamma-ray burst (GRB) in association\nwith a gravitational wave signal, we present the first fully Bayesian {\\it\nFermi}-GBM short GRB spectral catalog. Both peak flux and time-resolved\nspectral results are presented. Additionally, we release the full posterior\ndistributions and reduced data from our sample. Following our previous study,\nwe introduce three variability classes based of the observed light curve\nstructure.\n", "  The search for a Fermi surface in the absence of a conventional Fermi liquid\nhas thus far yielded very few potential candidates. Among promising materials\nare spin-frustrated Mott insulators near the insulator-metal transition, where\ntheory predicts a Fermi surface associated with neutral low energy excitations.\nHere we reveal another route to experimentally realise a Fermi surface in the\nabsence of a Fermi liquid by the experimental study of a Kondo insulator\nSmB$_6$ positioned close to the insulator-metal transition. We present\nexperimental signatures down to low temperatures ($\\ll 1$ K) associated with a\nFermi surface in the bulk, including a sizeable linear specific heat\ncoefficient, and on the application of a finite magnetic field, bulk magnetic\nquantum oscillations, finite quantum oscillatory entropy, and substantial\nenhancement in thermal conductivity well below the charge gap energy scale.\nThus, the weight of evidence indicates that despite an extreme instance of\nFermi liquid breakdown in Kondo insulating SmB$_6$, a Fermi surface arises from\nnovel itinerant low energy excitations that couple to magnetic fields, but not\nweak DC electric fields.\n", "  In this work we report briefly on the gravitational wave (GW) signal computed\nin the context of a self-consistent, 3D simulation of a core-collapse supernova\n(CCSN) explosion of a 15M$_\\odot$ progenitor star. We present a short overview\nof the GW signal, including signal amplitude, frequency distribution, and the\nenergy emitted in the form of GWs for each phase of explosion, along with\nneutrino luminosities, and discuss correlations between them.\n", "  We consider a globally coupled network of active (oscillatory) and inactive\n(non-oscillatory) oscillators with distributed-delay coupling. Conditions for\naging transition, associated with suppression of oscillations, are derived for\nuniform and gamma delay distributions in terms of coupling parameters and the\nproportion of inactive oscillators. The results suggest that for the uniform\ndistribution increasing the width of distribution for the same mean delay\nallows aging transition to happen for a smaller coupling strength and a smaller\nproportion of inactive elements. For gamma distribution with sufficiently large\nmean time delay, it may be possible to achieve aging transition for an\narbitrary proportion of inactive oscillators, as long as the coupling strength\nlies in a certain range.\n", "  We undertook observations with the Green Bank Telescope, simultaneously with\nthe 300m telescope in Arecibo, as a follow-up of a possible flare of radio\nemission from Ross 128. We report here the non-detections from the GBT\nobservations in C band (4-8 GHz), as well as non-detections in archival data at\nL band (1.1-1.9 GHz). We suggest that a likely scenario is that the emission\ncomes from one or more satellites passing through the same region of the sky.\n", "  Recent STM measurements have revealed the existence of periodic charge\nmodulations at the surface of certain cuprate superconductors. Here we show\nthat the observed patterns are compatible with the formation of a\nthree-dimensional crystal of doped holes, with space correlations extending\nbetween different Cu-O layers. This puts severe constraints on the dynamical\nstability of the crystallised hole structure, resulting in a close relationship\nbetween the periodicity of the electronic modulation and the interlayer\ndistance.\n", "  We show a device with which, apparently, information (in the form of a\n\"slash-dot\" code) is instantly transmitted via Bell state collapse, over\narbitrary distance. We show then why the device does not actually work, and\ndiscuss about the \"no Bell telephone\" statement. We discuss also about the\ntroublesome relationship between the Copenhagen interpretation and special\nrelativity. In particular, we advocate the interpretation that the \"state\nspace\" cannot be a description of the state of the object studied alone, but\nthat the observer is inextricably involved even if no measurement is taking\nplace.\n", "  The aim of this note is to attract attention of the quantum foundational\ncommunity to the fact that in Bell's arguments one can not distinguish two\nhypotheses: a) quantum mechanics is {\\it nonlocal}, b) quantum mechanics is\n{\\it nonergodic.} Therefore experimental violations of Bell's inequality can be\nas well interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that stochastic processes\ninduced by quantum measurements are nonergodic. The latter hypothesis was\ndiscussed actively by Buonomano since 1980th. However, in contrast to Bell's\nhypothesis on nonlocality it did not attract so much attention. The only\nexperiment testing the hypothesis on nonergodicity was performed in neutron\ninterferometry (by Summhammer, in 1989). This experiment can be considered as\nrejecting this hypothesis. However, it cannot be considered as a decisive\nexperiment. New experiments are badly needed. We point out that a nonergodic\nmodel can be realistic, i.e., the distribution of hidden (local!) variables is\nwell defined. We also discuss coupling of violation of the Bell inequality with\nviolation of the condition of weak mixing for ergodic dynamical systems.\n"]}
