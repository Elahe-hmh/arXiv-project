For typical values of the control parameter of the system\n$\\rho$, an infinite number of marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs) exist\nmaking the system sticky in the sense that unstable orbits approach regular\nregions in phase space and thus exhibit regular behaviour for long periods of\ntime. The problem of finding these MUPOs is expressed as the well known problem\nof finding optimal rational approximations of a real number, subject to some\nsystem-specific constraints. By introducing a generalized mushroom and using\nproperties of continued fractions, we describe a zero measure set of control\nparameter values $\\rho\\in(0,1)$ for which all MUPOs are destroyed and therefore\nthe system is less sticky. The open mushroom (billiard with a hole) is then\nconsidered in order to quantify the stickiness exhibited and exact leading\norder expressions for the algebraic decay of the survival probability function\n$P(t)$ are calculated for mushrooms with triangular and rectangular stems.\n", "  Many complex networks exhibit a percolation transition involving a\nmacroscopic connected component, with universal features largely independent of\nthe microscopic model and the macroscopic domain geometry. In contrast, we show\nthat the transition to full connectivity is strongly influenced by details of\nthe boundary, but observe an alternative form of universality. Our approach\ncorrectly distinguishes connectivity properties of networks in domains with\nequal bulk contributions. It also facilitates system design to promote or avoid\nfull connectivity for diverse geometries in arbitrary dimension.\n", "  A particle driven by deterministic chaos and moving in a spatially extended\nenvironment can exhibit normal diffusion, with its mean square displacement\ngrowing proportional to the time. Here we consider the dependence of the\ndiffusion coefficient on the size and the position of areas of phase space\nlinking spatial regions (`holes') in a class of simple one-dimensional,\nperiodically lifted maps. The parameter dependent diffusion coefficient can be\nobtained analytically via a Taylor-Green-Kubo formula in terms of a functional\nrecursion relation. We find that the diffusion coefficient varies\nnon-monotonically with the size of a hole and its position, which implies that\na diffusion coefficient can increase by making the hole smaller. We derive\nanalytic formulas for small holes in terms of periodic orbits covered by the\nholes. The asymptotic regimes that we observe show deviations from the standard\nstochastic random walk approximation. The escape rate of the corresponding open\nsystem is also calculated. The resulting parameter dependencies are compared\nwith the ones for the diffusion coefficient and explained in terms of periodic\norbits.\n", "  A gas of noninteracting particles diffuses in a lattice of pulsating\nscatterers. In the finite horizon case with bounded distance between collisions\nand strongly chaotic dynamics, the velocity growth (Fermi acceleration) is well\ndescribed by a master equation, leading to an asymptotic universal\nnon-Maxwellian velocity distribution scaling as v ~ t. The infinite horizon\ncase has intermittent dynamics which enhances the acceleration, leading to v ~\nt ln t and a non-universal distribution.\n", "  We consider classical dynamical properties of a particle in a constant\ngravitational force and making specular reflections with circular, elliptic or\noval boundaries. The model and collision map are described and a detailed study\nof the energy regimes is made. The linear stability of fixed points is studied,\nyielding exact analytical expressions for parameter values at which a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation occurs. The dynamics is apparently ergodic at\ncertain energies in all three models, in contrast to the regularity of the\ncircular and elliptic billiard dynamics in the field-free case. This finding is\nconfirmed using a sensitive test involving Lyapunov weighted dynamics. In the\nlast part of the paper a time dependence is introduced in the billiard\nboundary, where it is shown that for the circular billiard the average velocity\nsaturates for zero gravitational force but in the presence of gravitational it\nincreases with a very slow growth rate, which may be explained using Arnold\ndiffusion. For the oval billiard, where chaos is present in the static case,\nthe particle has an unlimited velocity growth with an exponent of approximately\n1/6.\n", "  Nodes in ad hoc networks with randomly oriented directional antenna patterns\ntypically have fewer short links and more long links which can bridge together\notherwise isolated subnetworks. This network feature is known to improve\noverall connectivity in 2D random networks operating at low channel path loss.\nTo this end, we advance recently established results to obtain analytic\nexpressions for the mean degree of 3D networks for simple but practical\nanisotropic gain profiles, including those of patch, dipole and end-fire array\nantennas. Our analysis reveals that for homogeneous systems (i.e. neglecting\nboundary effects) directional radiation patterns are superior to the isotropic\ncase only when the path loss exponent is less than the spatial dimension.\nMoreover, we establish that ad hoc networks utilizing directional transmit and\nisotropic receive antennas (or vice versa) are always sub-optimally connected\nregardless of the environment path loss. We extend our analysis to investigate\nboundary effects in inhomogeneous systems, and study the geometrical reasons\nwhy directional radiating nodes are at a disadvantage to isotropic ones.\nFinally, we discuss multi-directional gain patterns consisting of many equally\nspaced lobes which could be used to mitigate boundary effects and improve\noverall network connectivity.\n", "  We study the survival probability for long times in an open spherical\nbilliard, extending previous work on the circular billiard. We provide details\nof calculations regarding two billiard configurations, specifically a sphere\nwith a circular hole and a sphere with a square hole. The constant terms of the\nlong-term survival probability expansions have been derived analytically. Terms\nthat vanish in the long time limit are investigated analytically and\nnumerically, leading to connections with the Riemann hypothesis.\n", "  The Lorentz gas, a point particle making mirror-like reflections from an\nextended collection of scatterers, has been a useful model of deterministic\ndiffusion and related statistical properties for over a century. This survey\nsummarises recent results, including periodic and aperiodic models, finite and\ninfinite horizon, external fields, smooth or polygonal obstacles, and in the\nBoltzmann-Grad limit. New results are given for several moving particles and\nfor obstacles with flat points. Finally, a variety of applications are\npresented.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise spectra\nof hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)\nmodel-atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the\nreliability of the atomic data that is used for their calculation. In a recent\nanalysis of the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the DA-type white dwarf G191-B2B,\n21 Zn IV lines were newly identified. Because of the lack of Zn IV data,\ntransition probabilities of the isoelectronic Ge VI were adapted for a first,\ncoarse determination of the photospheric Zn abundance.\n  We performed new calculations of Zn IV and Zn V oscillator strengths to\nconsider their radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions in detail in\nour NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of the Zn IV - V spectrum\nexhibited in high-resolution and high-S/N UV observations of G191-B2B and\nRE0503-289.\n  In the UV spectrum of G191-B2B, we identify 31 Zn IV and 16 Zn V lines. Most\nof these are identified for the first time in any star. We can reproduce well\nalmost all of them at log Zn = -5.52 +/- 0.2 (mass fraction, about 1.7 times\nsolar). In particular, the Zn IV / Zn V ionization equilibrium, which is a very\nsensitive indicator for the effective temperature, is well reproduced with the\npreviously determined Teff = 60000 +/- 2000 and log g = 7.60 +/- 0.05. In the\nspectrum of RE0503-289, we identified 128 Zn V lines for the first time and\ndetermined log Zn = -3.57 +/- 0.2 (155 times solar).\n  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a pre-requisite for\nstellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Zn IV and Zn V line profiles in two white\ndwarf (G191-B2B and RE0503-289) ultraviolet spectra were well reproduced with\nour newly calculated oscillator strengths. This allowed us to determine the\nphotospheric Zn abundance of these two stars precisely.\n", "  The roles of crystal-field splitting and Jahn-Teller distortions on the\norbital ordering transition are investigated in the single-layer manganites\nnear half doping. Crystal-field splitting of energy levels favoring the\n$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ occupancy provides not only the correct Fermi surface topology\nfor La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ having a circular electron pocket around the\n$\\Gamma$ point, but also enhances the flatness of the hole pocket around the M\npoint thereby improving the nesting. In the presence of the circular electron\npocket, Jahn-Teller distortions are found to be crucial for the transition to\nthe transverse orbital ordering with ordering wavevector ($0.5\\pi, 0.5\\pi$). In\nthe hole-doping regime $0.5 \\leq x \\leq 0.7$, the orbital ordering wavevector\nshows a linear dependence on the hole concentration in accordance with the\nexperiments.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N)\nspectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the\nreliability of the atomic data that is used for their calculation. Reliable Ba\nV - VII oscillator strengths are used to identify Ba lines in the spectra of\nthe DA-type white dwarf G191-B2B and the DO-type white dwarf RE0503-289 and to\ndetermine their photospheric Ba abundances. We newly calculated Ba V - VII\noscillator strengths to consider their radiative and collisional bound-bound\ntransitions in detail in our NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of\nBa lines exhibited in high-resolution and high-S/N UV observations of G191-B2B\nand RE0503-289. For the first time, we identified highly ionized Ba in the\nspectra of hot white dwarfs. We detected Ba VI and Ba VII lines in the Far\nUltraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectrum of RE0503-289. The Ba VI /\nBa VII ionization equilibrium is well reproduced with the previously determined\neffective temperature of 70000 K and surface gravity of $\\log g = 7.5$. The Ba\nabundance is $3.5 \\pm 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ (mass fraction, about 23000 times the\nsolar value). In the FUSE spectrum of G191-B2B, we identified the strongest Ba\nVII line (at 993.41 \\AA) only, and determined a Ba abundance of $4.0 \\pm 0.5\n\\times 10^{-6}$ (about 265 times solar). Reliable measurements and calculations\nof atomic data are a pre-requisite for stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Ba\nVI - VII line profiles in two white dwarfs' (G191-B2B and RE0503-289)\nfar-ultraviolet spectra were well reproduced with our newly calculated\noscillator strengths. This allowed to determine the photospheric Ba abundance\nof these two stars precisely.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) analogue of vacuum sector of the Brans Dicke (BD)\ngravity [1] is studied to obtain dynamics of anisotropic spherically symmetric\nperfect fluid. Our obtained static solutions behave as dark matter with state\nequation $\\gamma=\\frac{p(\\rho)}{\\varrho}=-0.25$ but in non-static regimes\nbehave as regular perfect fluid with barotropic index $\\gamma>0.$ Positivity\nproperty of total mass of the fluid causes that the BD parameter to be\n$\\omega>\\frac{2}{3}$ and/or $\\omega<-1$.\n  Locations of the event and apparent horizons of the collapsing fluid are\nobtained in its static regime. In case $\\omega>0$ the apparent horizon is\ncovered by event horizon where the cosmic censorship hypothesis is still valid.\nAccording to the model [1], we obtain de Broglie pilot wave of our metric\nsolution which describes particles ensemble which become distinguishable via\ndifferent values of $\\omega.$ Incident current density of particles ensemble on\nthe horizons is evaluated which describe the `Hawking radiation`. The de Brogle\n-Bohm quantum potential effect is calculated also on the event (apparent)\nhorizon which is independent (dependent) to values of $\\omega.$\n", "  Even photosynthesis -- the most basic natural phenomenon underlying Life on\nEarth -- involves the non-trivial processing of excitations at the pico- and\nfemtosecond scales during light-harvesting. The desire to understand such\nnatural phenomena, as well as interpret the output from ultrafast experimental\nprobes, creates an urgent need for accurate quantitative theories of open\nquantum systems. However it is unclear how best to generalize the\nwell-established assumptions of an isolated system, particularly under\nnon-equilibrium conditions. Here we compare two popular approaches: a\ndescription in terms of a direct product of the states of each individual\nsystem (i.e. a local approach) versus the use of new states resulting from\ndiagonalizing the whole Hamiltonian (i.e. a global approach). We show that\ntheir equivalence fails when the system is open, in particular under the\nexperimentally ubiquitous condition of a temperature gradient. By solving for\nthe steady-state populations and calculating the heat flux as a test\nobservable, we uncover stark differences between the formulations. This\ndivergence highlights the need to establish rigorous ranges of applicability\nfor such methods in modeling nanoscale transfer phenomena -- including during\nthe light-harvesting process in photosynthesis.\n", "  We investigate the orbital fluctuations in the ferromagnetic-metallic phase\nof La$_{1.2}$Sr$_{1.8}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ by considering a two orbital model within a\ntight-binding description which reproduces the ARPES Fermi surface. We find\nstrong antisymmetric transverse orbital fluctuations at wavevector ($ 0.5 \\pi,\n0.5 \\pi$) resulting from the Fermi-surface nesting between the portions of\nbonding and antibonding bands instead of the widely believed nesting between\nthe portions of bonding band despite their flat segments, which provide an\ninsight into the origin of so called CE-type orbital fluctuations in the\nferromagnetic-metallic phase. Subsequent renormalization of the phonons near\nwavevector ($0.5 \\pi,0.5 \\pi$) and the behavior of the phonon linewidth as a\nfunction of momentum are in agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments.\n", "  Galaxy-cluster merger shocks efficiently accelerate the ambient electrons\nthrough diffusive shock acceleration and amplify magnetic field by compressing\nthe Inter Cluster Medium. As a result, such objects produce a significant\namount of synchrotron radio emission. Radio halo and Mpc scale peripheral radio\nrelics thus help us to trace back the cluster formation history. To study the\ndynamical state of the galaxy clusters and their relation to the merging\nscenario, as a pilot project, we thus observed four suitable candidates from\nthe MACS (Massive Cluster Survey) cluster sample. Observations were carried out\nsimultaneously at 610 and 235 MHz with the GMRT. We observed a rare phenomena\nin the cluster MACSJ0014.3-3022, which hosts both a peripheral spectacular\nradio relic and an unusually flat spectrum central giant radio halo of more\nthan 1.5 Mpc dimension. We also report that another cluster MACSJ0152.5-2852 is\npossibly showing the sign of one of the earliest and young merging system\nwhere, we saw a faint 0.5 Mpc radio relic at the cluster periphery.\n", "  Motivated by the recent ARPES measurements (Evtushinsky et. al., PRL {\\bf\n105}, 147201 (2010)) and evidence for the density-wave state for the charge and\norbital ordering (Garc\\'{i}a et al., PRL {\\bf 109}, 107202 (2012)) in\nLa$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$, the issue of charge and orbital ordering in a two\norbital tight-binding model for layered manganite near half doping is\nrevisited. We find that the charge order with an ordering wavevector 2${\\bf Q}$\n= $(\\pi, \\pi)$ is induced by the orbital order of $B_{1g}$ representation with\na different ordering wavevector ${\\bf Q}$, where the primary order parameter\nresults from the strong Fermi-surface nesting. The orbital and charge order\nparameters develop according to $\\sqrt{T_{CO}-T}$ and $T_{CO}-T$, respectively,\nby decreasing the temperature below the orbital ordering temperature $T_{CO}$.\nMoreover, the orbital order is found to stabilize the CE-type spin arrangement\nobserved experimentally below $T_{CE} < T_{CO}$.\n", "  Recent research has demonstrated the importance of boundary effects on the\noverall connection probability of wireless networks but has largely focused on\nconvex deployment regions. We consider here a scenario of practical importance\nto wireless communications, in which one or more nodes are located outside the\nconvex space where the remaining nodes reside. We call these `external nodes',\nand assume that they play some essential role in the macro network\nfunctionality e.g. a gateway to a dense self-contained mesh network cloud.\nConventional approaches with the underlying assumption of only line-of-sight\n(LOS) or direct connections between nodes, fail to provide the correct analysis\nfor such a network setup. To this end we present a novel analytical framework\nthat accommodates for the non-convexity of the domain and explicitly considers\nthe effects of non-LOS nodes through reflections from the domain boundaries. We\nobtain analytical expressions in 2D and 3D which are confirmed numerically for\nRician channel fading statistics and discuss possible extensions and\napplications.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N)\nspectra of hot stars, advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model\natmospheres are mandatory. These atmospheres are strongly dependent on the\nreliability of the atomic data that are used to calculate them. Reliable Ga IV\n- VI oscillator strengths are used to identify Ga lines in the spectra of the\nDA-type white dwarf G191-B2B and the DO-type white dwarf RE0503-289 and to\ndetermine their photospheric Ga abundances. We newly calculated Ga IV - VI\noscillator strengths to consider their radiative and collisional bound-bound\ntransitions in detail in our NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for analyzing of Ga\nlines exhibited in high-resolution and high-S/N UV observations of G191-B2B and\nRE0503-289. We unambiguously detected 20 isolated and 6 blended (with lines of\nother species) Ga V lines in the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)\nspectrum of RE0503-289. The identification of Ga IV and Ga VI lines is\nuncertain because they are weak and partly blended by other lines. The\ndetermined Ga abundance is 3.5 +/- 0.5 x 10**-5 (mass fraction, about 625 times\nsolar). The Ga IV / GA V ionization equilibrium, which is a very sensitive\nindicator for the effective temperature, is well reproduced in RE0503-289. We\nidentified the strongest Ga IV lines (1258.801, 1338.129 A) in the HST/STIS\n(Hubble Space Telescope / Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) spectrum of\nG191-B2B and measured a Ga abundance of 2.0 +/- 0.5 x 10**-6 (about 22 times\nsolar). Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a\nprerequisite for stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Ga IV - V line profiles\nin two white dwarf (G191-B2B and RE0503-289) ultraviolet spectra were well\nreproduced with our newly calculated oscillator strengths. For the first time,\nthis allowed us to determine the photospheric Ga abundance in white dwarfs.\n", "  Systematic errors are inevitable in most measurements performed in real life\nbecause of imperfect measurement devices. Reducing systematic errors is crucial\nto ensuring the accuracy and reliability of measurement results. To this end,\ndelicate error-compensation design is often necessary in addition to device\ncalibration to reduce the dependence of the systematic error on the\nimperfection of the devices. The art of error-compensation design is well\nappreciated in nuclear magnetic resonance system by using composite pulses. In\ncontrast, there are few works on reducing systematic errors in quantum optical\nsystems. Here we propose an error-compensation design to reduce the systematic\nerror in projective measurements on a polarization qubit. It can reduce the\nsystematic error to the second order of the phase errors of both the half-wave\nplate (HWP) and the quarter-wave plate (QWP) as well as the angle error of the\nHWP. This technique is then applied to experiments on quantum state tomography\non polarization qubits, leading to a 20-fold reduction in the systematic error.\nOur study may find applications in high-precision tasks in polarization optics\nand quantum optics.\n", "  In this note, we answer the questions \"What does Chern-Simons theory assign\nto a point?\" and \"What kind of mathematical object does Chern-Simons theory\nassign to a point?\".\n  Our answer to the first question is representations of the based loop group.\nMore precisely, we identify a certain class of projective unitary\nrepresentations of the based loop group $\\Omega G$ that we locally normal\nrepresentations. We define the fusion product of such representations and we\nprove that, modulo certain conjectures, the Drinfel'd centre of that\nrepresentation category of $\\Omega G$ is equivalent to the category of positive\nenergy representations of the free loop group $LG$. The above mentioned\nconjectures are known to hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type $A_1$.\n  Our answer to the second question is bicommutant categories. The latter are\nhigher categorical analogs of von Neumann algebras: they are tensor categories\nthat are equivalent to their bicommutant inside $\\mathrm{Bim}(R)$, the category\nof bimodules over a hyperfinite $\\mathit{III}_1$ factor. We prove that, modulo\ncertain conjectures, the category of locally normal representations of the\nbased loop group is a bicommutant category. The relevant conjectures are known\nto hold when the gauge group is abelian or of type $A_n$.\n  Our work builds on the formalism of coordinate free conformal nets, developed\njointly with A. Bartels and C. Douglas.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of spectra of hot stars with a high resolution and\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory.

These strengths were used to consider\ntheir radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions in detail in our NLTE\nstellar-atmosphere models to analyze Xe VI lines exhibited in high-resolution\nand high S/N UV observations of RE0503-289.\n  We identify three hitherto unknown Xe VI lines in the ultraviolet spectrum of\nRE0503-289 and confirm the previously measured photospheric Xe abundance of\nthis white dwarf (log Xe = -4.2 +/- 0.6).\n  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are prerequisite for\nstellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Xe VI line profiles in the ultraviolet\nspectrum of the white dwarf RE0503-289 were well reproduced with the newly\ncalculated Xe VI oscillator strengths.\n", "  Orbital-ordering instability arising due to the intrapocket nesting is\ninvestigated for the tight-binding models of pnictides in the presence of\norbital-lattice coupling. The incommensurate instabilities with small momentum,\nwhich may play an important role in the nematic-ordering transition, vary from\nmodel to model besides being more favorable in comparison to the spin-density\nwave instability in the absence of good interpocket nesting. We also examine\nthe doping dependence of such instabilities. The electron-phonon coupling\nparameter required to induce them are compared with the first-principle\ncalculations.\n", "  In this work we have deformed regular black holes which possess a general\nmass term described by a function which generalizes the Bardeen and Hayward\nmass functions. By using linear constraints in the energy-momentum tensor to\ngenerate metrics, the solutions presented in this work are either regular or\nsingular. That is, within this approach, it is possible to generate regular or\nsingular black holes from regular or singular black holes. Moreover, contrary\nto the Bardeen and Hayward regular solutions, the deformed regular black holes\nmay violate the weak energy condition despite the presence of the spherical\nsymmetry. Some comments on accretion of deformed black holes in cosmological\nscenarios are made.\n", "  Thermal light sources can produce photons with strong spatial correlations.\nWe study the role that these correlations might potentially play in bacterial\nphotosynthesis. Our findings show a relationship between the transversal\ndistance between consecutive absorption and the efficiency of the\nphotosynthetic process. Furthermore, membranes where the clustering of core\ncomplexes (so-called RC-LH1) is high, display a range where the organism\nprofits maximally from the spatial correlation of the incoming light. By\ncontrast, no maximum is found for membranes with low core-core clustering. We\nemploy a detailed membrane model with state-of-the-art empirical inputs. Our\nresults suggest that the organization of the membrane's antenna complexes may\nbe well-suited to the spatial correlations present in an natural light source.\nFuture experiments will be needed to test this prediction.\n", "  We present a mathematically rigorous analysis of the superfluid properties of\na Bose-Einstein condensate in the many-body ground state of a one-dimensional\nmodel of interacting bosons in a random potential.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N)\nspectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory.

In addition, from the As V\nand Sn IV resonance lines, we measured mass fractions of arsenic (0.5 - 1.3 x\n10**-5, about 300 - 1200 times solar) and tin (1.3 - 3.2 x 10**-4, about 14300\n35200 times solar). For G191-B2B, upper limits were determined for the\nabundances of Mo (5.3 x 10**-7, 100 times solar) and, in addition, for Kr (1.1\nx 10**-6, 10 times solar) and Xe (1.7 x 10**-7, 10 times solar). The arsenic\nabundance was determined (2.3 - 5.9 x 10**-7, about 21 - 53 times solar). A\nnew, registered German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO) service, TOSS,\nhas been constructed to provide weighted oscillator strengths and transition\nprobabilities.\n  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for\nstellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Mo V - VI line profiles in the UV\nspectrum of the white dwarf RE0503-289 were well reproduced with our newly\ncalculated oscillator strengths. For the first time, this allowed to determine\nthe photospheric Mo abundance in a white dwarf.\n", "  Purpose: Electron density is the most important tissue property influencing\nphoton and ion dose distributions in radiotherapy patients. Dual-energy\ncomputed tomography (DECT) enables the determination of electron density by\ncombining the information on photon attenuation obtained at two different tube\nvoltages. Most algorithms suggested so far use the CT numbers provided after\nimage reconstruction as input parameters, i.e. are imaged-based. To explore the\naccuracy that can be achieved with these approaches, we quantify the intrinsic\nmethodological and calibration uncertainty of the seemingly simplest approach.\n", "  We have developed a simple cellular automata model for nonlinearly coupled\nphase oscillators which can exhibit many important collective dynamical states\nfound in other synchronizing systems. The state of our system is specified by a\nset of integers chosen from a finite set and defined on a lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions. The integers undergo coupled dynamics over discrete time\nsteps. Depending on the values of coupling strength and range of coupling, we\nobserved interesting collective dynamical phases namely: asynchronous, where\nall the integers oscillate incoherently; synchronized, where all integers\noscillate coherently and also other states of intermediate and time-dependent\nordering. We have adapted conventional order parameters used in coupled\noscillator systems to measure the amount of synchrony in our system. We have\nplotted phase diagrams of these order parameters in the plane of strength of\ncoupling and the radius of coupling. The phase diagrams reveal interesting\nproperties about the nature of the synchronizing transition. There are\npartially ordered states, where there are synchronized clusters which are shown\nto have a power law distribution of their sizes. The power law exponent is\nfound to be independent of the system parameters. We also discuss the\npossibility of chimera states in this model. A criterion of persistence of\nchimera is developed analytically and compared with numerical simulation.\n", "  We model information dissemination as a susceptible-infected epidemic process\nand formulate a problem to jointly optimize seeds for the epidemic and time\nvarying resource allocation over the period of a fixed duration campaign\nrunning on a social network with a given adjacency matrix. Individuals in the\nnetwork are grouped according to their centrality measure and each group is\ninfluenced by an external control function---implemented through\nadvertisements---during the campaign duration. The aim is to maximize an\nobjective function which is a linear combination of the reward due to the\nfraction of informed individuals at the deadline, and the aggregated cost of\napplying controls (advertising) over the campaign duration. We also study a\nproblem variant with a fixed budget constraint. We set up the optimality system\nusing Pontryagin's Maximum Principle from optimal control theory and solve it\nnumerically using the forward-backward sweep technique. Our formulation allows\nus to compare the performance of various centrality measures (pagerank, degree,\ncloseness and betweenness) in maximizing the spread of a message in the optimal\ncontrol framework. We find that degree---a simple and local measure---performs\nwell on the three social networks used to demonstrate results: scientific\ncollaboration, Slashdot and Facebook. The optimal strategy targets central\nnodes when the resource is scarce, but non-central nodes are targeted when the\nresource is in abundance. Our framework is general and can be used in similar\nstudies for other disease or information spread models---that can be modeled\nusing a system of ordinary differential equations---for a network with a known\nadjacency matrix.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N)\nspectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the\nreliability of the atomic data that is used for their calculation.\n  New of Kr IV - VII oscillator strengths for a large number of lines allow to\nconstruct more detailed model atoms for our NLTE model-atmosphere calculations.\nThis enables us to search for additional Kr lines in observed spectra and to\nimprove Kr abundance determinations.\n  We calculated Kr IV - VII oscillator strengths to consider radiative and\ncollisional bound-bound transitions in detail in our NLTE stellar-atmosphere\nmodels for the analysis of Kr lines exhibited in high-resolution and high-S/N\nultraviolet (UV) observations of the hot white dwarf RE 0503-289.\n  We reanalyzed the effective temperature and surface gravity and determined\nTeff = 70 000 +/- 2000 K and log (g / cm/s**2) = 7.5 +/- 0.1. We newly\nidentified ten Kr V lines and one Kr VI line in the spectrum of RE 0503-289. We\nmeasured a Kr abundance of -3.3 +/- 0.3 (logarithmic mass fraction). We\ndiscovered that the interstellar absorption toward RE 0503-289 has a\nmulti-velocity structure within a radial-velocity interval of -40 km/s < vrad <\n+18 km/s.\n  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for\nstate-of-the-art NLTE stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Kr V - VII line\nprofiles in the UV spectrum of the white dwarf RE 0503-289 were simultaneously\nwell reproduced with our newly calculated oscillator strengths.\n", "  We apply the framework of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics to the\nphysics of quenched small-sized bosonic quantum gases in a one-dimensional\nharmonic trap. We show that dynamical orthogonality can occur in these few-body\nsystems with strong interactions after a quench and we find its occurrence\nanalytically for an infinitely repulsive pair of atoms. We further show this\nphenomena is related to the fundamental excitations that dictate the dynamics\nfrom the spectral function. We establish a clear qualitative link between the\namount of (irreversible) work performed on the system and the establishment of\nentanglement. We extend our analysis to multipartite systems by examining the\ncase of three trapped atoms. We show the initial (pre-quench) interactions play\na vital role in determining the dynamical features, while the qualitative\nfeatures of the two particle case appear to remain valid. Finally, we propose\nthe use of the atomic density profile as a readily accessible indicator of the\nnon-equilibrium properties of the systems in question.\n", "  Narrow-band red-emitting phosphors are a critical component in\nphosphor-converted light-emitting diodes for highly efficient\nillumination-grade lighting. In this work, we report the discovery of a\nquantitative descriptor for narrow-band Eu2+-activated emission identified\nthrough a comparison of the electronic structure of known narrow-band and\nbroad-band phosphors. We find that a narrow emission bandwidth is characterized\nby a large splitting of more than 0.1 eV between the two highest Eu2+ 4f7\nbands. By incorporating this descriptor in a high throughput first principles\nscreening of 2,259 nitride compounds, we identify five promising new nitride\nhosts for Eu2+-activated red-emitting phosphors that are predicted to exhibit\ngood chemical stability, thermal quenching resistance and quantum efficiency,\nas well as narrow-band emission. Our findings provide important insights into\nthe emission characteristics of rare-earth activators in phosphor hosts, and a\ngeneral strategy to the discovery of phosphors with a desired emission peak and\nbandwidth.\n", "  The flux of visitors through popular places undoubtedly influences viral\nspreading -- from H1N1 and Zika viruses spreading through physical spaces such\nas airports, to rumors and ideas spreading though online spaces such as\nchatrooms and social media. However there is a lack of understanding of the\ntypes of viral dynamics that can result. Here we present a minimal dynamical\nmodel which focuses on the time-dependent interplay between the {\\em mobility\nthrough} and the {\\em occupancy of} such spaces. Our generic model permits\nanalytic analysis while producing a rich diversity of infection profiles in\nterms of their shapes, durations, and intensities. The general features of\nthese theoretical profiles compare well to real-world data of recent social\ncontagion phenomena.\n", "  We investigate the inflationary realization in the context of unimodular\n$F(T)$ gravity, which is based on the $F(T)$ modification of teleparallel\ngravity, in which one imposes the unimodular condition through the use of\nLagrange multipliers. We develop the general reconstruction procedure of the\n$F(T)$ form that can give rise to a given scale-factor evolution, and then we\napply it in the inflationary regime. We extract the Hubble slow-roll parameters\nthat allow us to calculate various inflation-related observables, such as the\nscalar spectral index and its running, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the\ntensor spectral index. Then, we examine the particular cases of de Sitter and\npower-law inflation, of Starobinsky inflation, as well as inflation in a\nspecific model of unimodular $F(T)$ gravity. As we show, in all cases the\npredictions of our scenarios are in a very good agreement with Planck\nobservational data. Finally, inflation in unimodular $F(T)$ gravity has the\nadditional advantage that it always allows for a graceful exit for specific\nregions of the model parameters.\n", "  Meson states with exotic quantum numbers arise naturally in a covariant\nbound-state framework in QCD. We investigate the consequences of shifting quark\nmasses such that the states are no longer restricted to certain C-parities, but\nonly by J^P. Then, a priori, one can no longer distinguish exotic or\nconventional states. In order to identify signatures of the different states to\nlook for experimentally, we provide the behavior of masses, leptonic decay\nconstants, and orbital-angular-momentum decomposition of such mesons, as well\nas the constellations in which they could be found. Most prominently, we\nconsider the case of charged quasi-exotic excitations of the pion.\n", "  We consider a model of fermions interacting via point interactions, defined\nvia a certain weighted Dirichlet form. While for two particles the interaction\ncorresponds to infinite scattering length, the presence of further particles\neffectively decreases the interaction strength. We show that the model becomes\ntrivial in the thermodynamic limit, in the sense that the free energy density\nat any given particle density and temperature agrees with the corresponding\nexpression for non-interacting particles.\n", "  Benefiting from the development of increasingly advanced high speed cameras,\nflow visualization and analysis nowadays yield detailed data of the flow field\nin many applications. Notwithstanding this progress, for high speed and\nsupersonic flows it is still not trivial to capture high quality images. In\nthis study we present a Schlieren setup that uses pulsed LEDs with high\ncurrents (up to 18 Ampere) to increase the optical output to sufficient levels.\nThe bright and short pulses, down to 130 nanoseconds, allow detailed and sharp\nimaging of the flow with a high spatial resolution adequate for supersonic\nflow. The pulse circuit and pulse width determination are explained in detail.\nAs a test case we studied the near field of a 2 mm diameter sonic jet injected\ntransversely into a supersonic cross flow. This is a model flow for fuel\ninjection in scramjet engines, which is not yet fully understood. Owing to the\nhigh resolution and accuracy of the images produced by the newly developed\nsystem we prove the existence of a large (density) gradient wave traveling in\nthe windward subsonic region between the Mach barrel and the bowshock, which\nhitherto was observed only in some numerical studies but not yet shown in\nexperiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate with this Schlieren setup that\ntime-correlated images can be obtained, with an interframe time of 2\nmicroseconds, so that also flow unsteadiness can be studied such as the\nmovement of shock waves and trajectories of vortices. The obtained results of\nthe jet penetration height are presented as a power law correlation. The\nresults of this study show that the designed setup using a low-cost LED and\nlow-cost control system is a high potential option for application in\nvisualization studies of high speed flows.\n", "  The dynamics of collisionless plasmas can be modelled by the Vlasov-Maxwell\nsystem of equations. An Eulerian approach is needed to accurately describe\nprocesses that are governed by high energy tails in the distribution function,\nbut is of limited efficiency for high dimensional problems. The use of an\nadaptive mesh can reduce the scaling of the computational cost with the\ndimension of the problem. Here, we present a relativistic Eulerian\nVlasov-Maxwell solver with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement in one\nspatial and one momentum dimension. The discretization of the Vlasov equation\nis based on a high-order finite volume method. A flux corrected transport\nalgorithm is applied to limit spurious oscillations and ensure the physical\ncharacter of the distribution function. We demonstrate a speed-up by a factor\nof 7x in a typical scenario involving laser-plasma interaction with an\nunderdense plasma due to the use of an adaptive mesh.\n", "  We present predictions for the total cross section for the production of a\ncharged Higgs boson in the intermediate-mass range ($m_{H^{\\pm}}\\sim m_t$) at\nthe LHC, focusing on a type-II two-Higgs-doublet model. Results are obtained at\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in QCD perturbation theory, by studying\nthe full process $pp\\to H^\\pm W^\\mp b \\bar b$ in the complex-(top)-mass scheme\nwith massive bottom quarks. Compared to lowest-order predictions, NLO\ncorrections have a sizeable impact: they increase the cross section by roughly\n50\\% and reduce uncertainties due to scale variations by more than a factor of\ntwo. Our computation reliably interpolates between the low- and high-mass\nregime. Our results provide the first NLO prediction for charged Higgs\nproduction in the intermediate-mass range and therefore allow to have NLO\naccurate predictions in the full $m_{H^{\\pm}}$ range. The extension of our\nresults to different realisations of the two-Higgs-doublet model or to the\nsupersymmetric case is also discussed.\n", "  We analyze the paper of Nathan D. Grubaugh et al. (Nature 546, 401-405, 2017)\nand find that it does not offer a convincing quantitative explanation for what\ngenerated the temporal distribution of human Zika virus (ZIKV) cases shown in\ntheir paper (Fig. 1d). We criticize this aspect because it is this\nunderstanding of how human cases develop from day-today and week-to-week within\nan area such as these Ground Zeros, that policymakers need in order to mitigate\nfuture outbreaks. We present results that strongly suggest that the missing\npiece is everyday human visit-revisit behavior. These results reproduce the\nhuman outbreak data in the key areas of Miami in 2016 very well, and give\npolicymakers specific predictions for how changes in human flow through these\nareas will affect, and hence can be used to mitigate, future ZIka outbreaks in\nMiami and beyond.\n", "  We determine the characteristic timescales associated with the linearized\nrelaxation dynamics of the composed\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system. To that\nend, the quasinormal resonant frequencies\n$\\{\\omega_n(\\mu,q,M,Q)\\}_{n=0}^{n=\\infty}$ which characterize the dynamics of a\ncharged scalar field of mass $\\mu$ and charge coupling constant $q$ in the\ncharged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole spacetime of mass $M$ and electric\ncharge $Q$ are determined {\\it analytically} in the eikonal regime $1\\ll\nM\\mu<qQ$. Interestingly, we find that, for a given value of the dimensionless\nblack-hole electric charge $Q/M$, the imaginary part of the resonant\noscillation frequency is a monotonically {\\it decreasing} function of the\ndimensionless ratio $\\mu/q$. In particular, it is shown that the quasinormal\nresonance spectrum is characterized by the asymptotic behavior $\\Im\\omega\\to0$\nin the limiting case $M\\mu\\to qQ$. This intriguing finding implies that the\ncomposed Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system is\ncharacterized by extremely long relaxation times $\\tau_{\\text{relax}}\\equiv\n1/\\Im\\omega\\to\\infty$ in the $M\\mu/qQ\\to 1^-$ limit.\n", "  In many quantum information applications, a minimum detection efficiency must\nbe exceeded to ensure success. Protocols depending on the violation of a Bell\ninequality, for instance, may be subject to the so-called detection loophole:\nimperfect detectors may yield spurious violations, which consequently cannot be\nused to ensure, say, quantum cryptographic security. Hence, we investigate the\npossibility of giving lower bounds on detector efficiency even if an adversary\nhas full control over both the source and the detectors. To this end, we\npresent a technique to systematically derive Bell inequalities free from the\ndetection loophole using only the observed measurements statistics. The\nviolation of these inequalities certifies that the detectors used exceed a\ncertain minimal efficiency.\n", "  The timing properties of radio pulsars provide a unique probe of neutron star\ninteriors. Recent observations have uncovered quasiperiodicities in the timing\nand pulse properties of some pulsars, a phenomenon that has often been\nattributed to free precession of the neutron star, with profound implications\nfor the distribution of superfluidity and superconductivity in the star. We\nadvance this program by developing consistency relations between free\nprecession and pulsars glitches, and we show that there are difficulties in\nreconciling the two phenomena in some precession candidates. This indicates\nthat the precession model used here needs to be modified or some other\nphenomenon is at work in producing the quasiperiodicities, or even that there\nis something missing in terms of our understanding of glitches.\n", "  In the past few decades, numerous searches have been made for the\nneutrinoless double-beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$) process, aiming to establish\nwhether neutrinos are their own antiparticles (Majorana neutrinos), but no\n0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay signal has yet been observed. A number of new\nexperiments are proposed but they ultimately suffer from a common problem: the\nsensitivity may not increase indefinitely with the target mass. We have\nperformed a detailed analysis of the physics potential by using the Jiangmen\nUnderground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to improve the sensitivity to\n0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ up to a few meV, a major step forward with respect to the\nexperiments currently being planned. JUNO is a 20 kton low-background liquid\nscintillator (LS) detector with 3\\%/$\\sqrt{E \\text{(MeV)}}$ energy resolution,\nnow under construction. It is feasible to build a balloon filled with enriched\nxenon gas (with $^{136}$Xe up to 80\\%) dissolved in LS, inserted into the\ncentral region of the JUNO LS. The energy resolution is $\\sim$1.9\\% at the\n$Q$-value of $^{136}$Xe 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. Ultra-low background is the key\nfor 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay searches. Detailed studies of background rates from\nintrinsic 2$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, natural radioactivity,\nand cosmogenic radionuclides (including light isotopes and $^{137}$Xe) were\nperformed and several muon veto schemes were developed. We find that JUNO has\nthe potential to reach a sensitivity (at 90\\% C. L.) to\n$T^{0\\nu\\beta\\beta}_{1/2}$ of $1.8\\times10^{28}$ yr ($5.6\\times10^{27}$ yr)\nwith $\\sim$50 tons (5 tons) of fiducial $^{136}$Xe and 5 years exposure, while\nin the 50-ton case the corresponding sensitivity to the effective neutrino\nmass, $m_{\\beta\\beta}$, could reach (5--12) meV, covering completely the\nallowed region of inverted neutrino mass ordering.\n", "  This paper aims at providing a statistical model for the preferred behavior\nof authors submitting a paper to a scientific journal. The electronic\nsubmission of (about 600) papers to the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society\nhas been recorded for every day from Jan. 01, 2013 till Dec. 31, 2014, together\nwith the acceptance or rejection paper fate. Seasonal effects and editor roles\n(through desk rejection and subfield editors) are examined. An ARCH-like\neconometric model is derived stressing the main determinants of the favorite\nday-of-week process.\n", "  Based on the studies in Type IIB string theory phenomenology, we conjecture\nthat a good fraction of the meta-stable de Sitter vacua in the cosmic stringy\nlandscape tend to have a very small cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ when\ncompared to either the string scale $M_S$ or the Planck scale $M_P$, i.e.,\n$\\Lambda \\ll M_S^4 \\ll M_P^4$. These low lying de Sitter vacua tend to be\naccompanied by very light scalar bosons/axions. Here we illustrate this\nphenomenon with the bosonic mass spectra in a set of Type IIB string theory\nflux compactification models. We conjecture that small $\\Lambda$ with light\nbosons is generic among de Sitter solutions in string theory; that is, the\nsmallness of $\\Lambda$ and the existence of very light bosons (may be even the\nHiggs boson) are results of the statistical preference for such vacua in the\nlandscape. We also discuss a scalar field $\\phi^3/\\phi^4$ model to illustrate\nhow this statistical preference for a small $\\Lambda$ remains when quantum loop\ncorrections are included, thus bypassing the radiative instability problem.\n", "  The mass-imbalanced Hubbard model represents a continuous evolution from the\nHubbard to the Falicov-Kimball model. We employ dynamical mean field theory and\nstudy the paramagnetic metal-insulator transition, which has a very different\nnature for the two limiting models. Our results indicate that the\nmetal-insulator transition rather resembles that of the Hubbard model as soon\nas a tiny hopping between the more localized fermions is switched on. At low\ntemperatures we observe a first-order metal-insulator transition and a three\npeak structure. The width of the central peak is the same for the more and less\nmobile fermions when approaching the phase transition, which agrees with our\nexpectation of a common Kondo temperature and phase transition for the two\nspecies.\n", "  We model the accretion of gas onto a population of massive primordial black\nholes in the Milky Way, and compare the predicted radio and X-ray emission with\nobservational data. We show that under conservative assumptions on the\naccretion process, the possibility that ${\\cal O}(10) \\, M_\\odot$ primordial\nblack holes can account for all of the dark matter in the Milky Way is excluded\nat $5\\sigma$ by a comparison with a VLA radio catalog at $1.4$ GHz, and at\n$\\simeq 40\\sigma$ by a comparison with a Chandra X-ray catalog ($0.5 - 8$ keV).\nWe argue that this method can be used to identify such a population of\nprimordial black holes with more sensitive future radio and X-ray surveys.\n", "  Potential Energy Surface for the ($\\mathrm{\\bar{p}} - \\mathrm{He}^{2+} -\n\\mathrm{He}$) system is calculated in the framework of the restricted (singlet\nspin state) Hartree-Fock method with subsequent account of the electronic\ncorrelations within the second order perturbation method (MP2). The geometry of\nheavy particles is described in variables of distance $r$ from nucleus $a$ to\nantiproton, distance $R$ from the center of mass of the $(\\bar{p} - a)$ pair to\n$\\mathrm{He}$ atom containing nucleus $b$, and an angle $\\theta$ between\n$\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$. The potential $V(R,r,\\cos\\theta)$ of the\ninteraction between $\\mathrm{He}$ atom and a $\\bar{p} - a$ subsystem involves a\ntotal energy of two electrons in the field of three heavy particles and Coulomb\ninteractions of the $b$ nucleus with antiproton and the $a$ nucleus. The\nexpansion of this potential in terms of Legendre polynomials\n$\\mathrm{P}_k(\\cos\\theta)$ is obtained. Matrices of the multipole terms\n$V^k(r,R)$ ($k=0,1,2$) are obtained in the basis of antiprotonic helium ion\nstates. The results are compared with the model potential that was used earlier\nin the calculations of collisional Stark transitions of\n$(\\mathrm{\\bar{p}He}^{2+})$ ion.Total cross sections of collisional Stark\ntransitions obtained with the PES potentials exceed the model results by 15 -\n20\\% at $E \\leq 12$ K.\n", "  A unified framework is presented for the solution structure of\nthree-dimensional discrete integrable systems, including the lattice AKP, BKP\nand CKP equations. This is done through the so-called direct linearising\ntransform which establishes a general class of integral transforms between\nsolutions. As a particular application, novel soliton-type solutions for the\nlattice CKP equation are obtained.\n", "  The microscopic nature of the XYZ states remains an unsettled topic. We show\nhow a thorough amplitude analysis of the data can help constraining models of\nthese states. Specifically, we consider the case of the Zc(3900) peak and\ndiscuss possible scenarios of a QCD state, virtual state, or a kinematical\nenhancement. We conclude that current data are not precise enough to\ndistinguish between these hypotheses, however, the method we propose, when\napplied to the forthcoming high-statistics measurements should shed light on\nthe nature of these exotic enhancements.\n", "  We prove that the category of solitons of a finite index conformal net is a\nbicommutant category, and that its Drinfel'd center is the category of\nrepresentations of the conformal net. In the special case of a chiral WZW\nconformal net with finite index, the second result specializes to the statement\nthat the Drinfel'd center of the category of representations of the based loop\ngroup is equivalent to the category of representations of the free loop group.\nThese results were announced in [arXiv:1503.06254].\n", "  An accurate closed-form expression is provided to predict the bending angle\nof light as a function of impact parameter for equatorial orbits around Kerr\nblack holes of arbitrary spin. This expression is constructed by assuring that\nthe weak- and strong-deflection limits are explicitly satisfied while\nmaintaining accuracy at intermediate values of impact parameter via the method\nof asymptotic approximants (Barlow et al, 2016 Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math.,\ndoi=10.1093/qjmam/hbw014). To this end, the strong deflection limit for a\nprograde orbit around an extremal black hole is examined, and the full\nnon-vanishing asymptotic behavior is determined. The derived approximant may be\nan attractive alternative to computationally expensive elliptical integrals\nused in black hole simulations.\n", "  Biochemical oscillations are prevalent in living organisms. Systems with a\nsmall number of constituents cannot sustain coherent oscillations for an\nindefinite time because of fluctuations in the period of oscillation. We show\nthat the number of coherent oscillations that quantifies the precision of the\noscillator is universally bounded by the thermodynamic force that drives the\nsystem out of equilibrium and by the topology of the underlying biochemical\nnetwork of states. Our results are valid for arbitrary Markov processes, which\nare commonly used to model biochemical reactions. We apply our results to a\nmodel for a single KaiC protein and to an activator-inhibitor model that\nconsists of several molecules. From a mathematical perspective, based on strong\nnumerical evidence, we conjecture a universal constraint relating the imaginary\nand real parts of the first non-trivial eigenvalue of a stochastic matrix.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers are direct bandgap\nsemiconductors that feature tightly bound excitons, strong spin-orbit coupling,\nand spin-valley degrees of freedom. Depending on the spin configuration of the\nelectron-hole pairs, intra-valley excitons of TMD monolayers can be either\noptically bright or dark. Dark excitons involve nominally spin-forbidden\noptical transitions with zero in-plane transition dipole moment, making their\ndetection with conventional far-field optical techniques challenging. Here, we\nintroduce a new method for probing the optical properties of two-dimensional\n(2D) materials via near-field coupling to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs),\nwhich selectively enhances optical transitions with dipole moments normal to\nthe 2D plane. We utilize this method to directly detect dark excitons in\nmonolayer TMDs. When a WSe2 monolayer is placed on top of a single-crystal\nsilver film, its emission into near-field-coupled SPPs displays new spectral\nfeatures whose energies and dipole orientations are consistent with dark\nneutral and charged excitons. The SPP-based near-field spectroscopy\nsignificantly enhances experimental capabilities for probing and manipulating\nexciton dynamics of atomically thin materials.\n", "  A stochastic birth-death competition model for particles with excluded volume\nis proposed. The particles move, reproduce, and die on a regular lattice. While\nthe death rate is constant, the birth rate is spatially nonlocal and implements\ninter-particle competition by a dependence on the number of particles within a\nfinite distance. The finite volume of particles is accounted for by fixing an\nupper value to the number of particles that can occupy a lattice node,\ncompromising births and movements. We derive closed macroscopic equations for\nthe density of particles and spatial correlation at two adjacent sites. Under\ndifferent conditions, the description is further reduced to a single equation\nfor the particle density that contains three terms: diffusion, a linear death,\nand a highly nonlinear and nonlocal birth term. Steady-state homogeneous\nsolutions, their stability which reveals spatial pattern formation, and the\ndynamics of time-dependent homogeneous solutions are discussed and compared, in\nthe one-dimensional case, with numerical simulations of the particle system.\n", "  The physical process whereby a carbon--oxygen white dwarf explodes as a Type\nIa supernova (SN Ia) remains highly uncertain. The degree of neutronization in\nSN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the\nmetallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior\nto the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization\nusing Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs).\nApplying this method to \\textit{Suzaku} data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397 and\nG337.2$-$0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find\nthat the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho\nand Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source\nof neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to\ninfer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied\nmetallicities of 3C 397, G337.2$-$0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to\nthe local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that\nprogenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for\nthese SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and\nequivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the\n$^{12}$C$\\,$+$^{16}$O reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our\nmain results are not sensitive to these details.\n", "  We consider the refined topological vertex of Iqbal et al, as a function of\ntwo parameters (x, y), and deform it by introducing Macdonald parameters (q,\nt), as in the work of Vuletic on plane partitions, to obtain 'a Macdonald\nrefined topological vertex'. In the limit q -> t, we recover the refined\ntopological vertex of Iqbal et al. In the limit x -> y, we obtain a\nqt-deformation of the topological vertex of Aganagic et al. Copies of the\nvertex can be glued to obtain qt-deformed 5D instanton partition functions that\nhave well-defined 4D limits and, for generic values of (q, t), contain\ninfinite-towers of poles for every pole in the limit q -> t.\n", "  Compton scattering off the proton in the third resonance region is analyzed\nfor the first time, owing to the full combined analysis of pion- and\nphoto-induced reactions in a coupled-channel effective Lagrangian model with\nK-matrix approximation. Two isospin $I=3/2$ resonances $D_{33}(1700)$ and\n$F_{35}(1930)$ are found to be essential in the range of 1.6 - 1.8 GeV. The\nrecent beam asymmetry data of Compton scattering from the GRAAL facility are\nused to determine the helicity couplings of these resonances, and strong\nconstraints are coming also from $\\pi N$ and $K\\Sigma$ photoproduction data.\nThe possible spin and parity of new narrow resonances is discussed.\n", "  The detection of the gravitational wave events GW150914, GW151226, LVT 151012\nand GW170104 by the Advanced LIGO antennas has opened a new possibility for the\nstudy of fundamental physics of gravitational interaction. We suggest a new\nmethod for determining the polarization state of a gravitational wave, which is\nindependent of the nature of a GW source. For this, we calculate the allowed\nsky positions of GW sources along apparent circles. This is done for each\npolarization state by considering the sensitivity pattern of each antenna and\nrelative amplitudes of detected signals. The positions of circles are\ncalculated with respect to the line joining both LIGO antennas using the\nobserved arrival time delay of the signal between them. The apparent circles\n(AC) on the sky for allowed positions of the GW sources for the GW150914,\nGW151226 and LVT151012 events are parallel to the plane of the disc-like large\nscale structure known as the Local Super-Cluster (LSC) of galaxies which\nextends up to radius $\\sim 100$ Mpc and having thickness $\\sim 30$ Mpc. For the\nGW170104 event, the AC is perpendicular to the LSC plane but the predicted\nposition of the source may also belong to the LSC plane, which is consistent\nwith detection of possible optical counterpart ATLAS17aeu. The next\naLIGO-aVirgo observing runs are proposed to test the possibility of clustering\nthe GW sources along the LSC plane.\n", "  Tributyl-phosphate (TBP), a ligand used in the PUREX liquid-liquid separation\nprocess of spent nuclear fuel, can form explosive mixture in contact with\nnitric acid, that might lead to violent explosive thermal runaway. In the\ncontext of safety of a nuclear reprocessing plant facility, it is crucial to\npredict the stability of TBP at elevated temperatures. So far, only the\nenthalpies of formation of TBP is available in the literature with a rather\nlarge uncertainties, while those of its degradation products, di-(HDBP) and\nmono-(H$_2$MBP}) are unknown. In this goal, we have used state-of-the art\nquantum chemical methods to compute the formation enthalpies and entropies of\nTBP and its degradation products di-(HDBP), mono-(H$_2$MBP) in gas and liquid\nphases. Comparisons of levels of quantum chemical theory revealed that there\nare significant effects of correlation on their electronic structures, pushing\nfor the need of not only high level of electronic correlation treatment, namely\nlocal coupled cluster with single and double excitation operators and\nperturbative treatment of triple excitations [LCCSD(T)], but also\nextrapolations to the complete basis to produce reliable and accurate\nthermodynamics data. Solvation enthalpies were computed with the conductor like\nscreening model for real solvents [COSMO-RS], for which we observe errors not\nexceeding 22 kJ mol$^{-1}$. We thus propose with final uncertainty of about 20\nkJ mol$^{-1}$ standard enthalpies of formation of TBP, HDBP, and H$_2$MBP which\namounts to -1281.7$\\pm$24.4, -1229.4$\\pm$19.6 and -1176.7$\\pm$14.8 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$, respectively, in the gas phase. In the liquid phase, the predicted\nvalues are -1367.3$\\pm$24.4, -1348.7$\\pm$19.6 and -1323.8$\\pm$14.8 kJ\nmol$^{-1}$, to which we may add about -22 kJ mol$^{-1}$ error from the COSMO-RS\nsolvent model. From these data, we predict the complete hydrolysis of TBP to be\nnearly thermoneutral.\n", "  We study the thermoelectric properties and heat-to-work conversion\nperformance of an interacting, multi-level quantum dot (QD) weakly coupled to\nelectronic reservoirs. We focus on the sequential tunneling regime. The\ndynamics of the charge in the QD is studied by means of master equations for\nthe probabilities of occupation. From here we compute the charge and heat\ncurrents in the linear response regime. Assuming a generic multi-terminal\nsetup, and for low temperatures (quantum limit), we obtain analytical\nexpressions for the transport coefficients which account for the interplay\nbetween interactions (charging energy) and level quantization. In the case of\nsystems with two and three terminals we derive formulas for the power factor Q\nand the figure of merit ZT for a QD-based heat engine, identifying optimal\nworking conditions which maximize output power and efficiency of heat-to-work\nconversion. Beyond the linear response we concentrate on the two-terminal\nsetup. We first study the thermoelectric non-linear coefficients assessing the\nconsequences of large temperature and voltage biases, focusing on the breakdown\nof the Onsager reciprocal relation between thermopower and Peltier coefficient.\nWe then investigate the conditions which optimize the performance of a heat\nengine, finding that in the quantum limit output power and efficiency at\nmaximum power can almost be simultaneously maximized by choosing appropriate\nvalues of electrochemical potential and bias voltage. At last we study how\nenergy level degeneracy can increase the output power.\n", "  We propose a new phenomenological framework for three classes of Kondo\nlattice materials that incorporates the interplay between the fluctuations\nassociated with the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point and those produced\nby the hybridization quantum critical point that marks the end of local moment\nbehavior. We show that these fluctuations give rise to two distinct regions of\nquantum critical scaling: hybridization fluctuations are responsible for the\nlogarithmic scaling in the density of states of the heavy electron Kondo liquid\nthat emerges below the coherence temperature T*; while the unconventional power\nlaw scaling in the resistivity that emerges at lower temperatures below T_QC\nmay reflect the combined effects of hybridization and antiferromagnetic quantum\ncritical fluctuations. Our framework is supported by experimental measurements\non CeCoIn5, CeRhIn5 and other heavy electron materials.\n", "  We investigate the validity of Huygens' principle for forward propagation in\nthe massless Dirac-Weyl equation. The principle holds for odd space dimension\nn, while it is invalid for even n. We explicitly solve the cases n=1,2 and 3\nand discuss generic $n$. We compare with the massless Klein-Gordon equation and\ncomment on possible generalizations and applications.\n", "  A renormalization group flow of Hamiltonians for two-dimensional classical\npartition functions is constructed using tensor networks. Similar to tensor\nnetwork renormalization ([G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 180405\n(2015)], [S. Yang, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 110504\n(2017)]) we obtain approximate fixed point tensor networks at criticality. Our\nformalism however preserves positivity of the tensors at every step and hence\nyields an interpretation in terms of Hamiltonian flows. We emphasize that the\nkey difference between tensor network approaches and Kadanoff's spin blocking\nmethod can be understood in terms of a change of local basis at every\ndecimation step, a property which is crucial to overcome the area law of mutual\ninformation. We derive algebraic relations for fixed point tensors, calculate\ncritical exponents, and benchmark our method on the Ising model and the\nsix-vertex model.\n", "  In heterostructures consisting of different transition-metal dichalcogenide\nmonolayers, a staggered band alignment can occur, leading to rapid charge\nseparation of optically generated electron-hole pairs into opposite monolayers.\nThese spatially separated electron-hole pairs are Coulomb-coupled and form\ninterlayer excitons. Here, we study these interlayer excitons in a\nheterostructure consisting of MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers using\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy. We observe a non-trivial temperature dependence\nof the linewidth and the peak energy of the interlayer exciton, including an\nunusually strong initial redshift of the transition with temperature, as well\nas a pronounced blueshift of the emission energy with increasing excitation\npower. By combining these observations with time-resolved photoluminescence\nmeasurements, we are able to explain the observed behavior as a combination of\ninterlayer exciton diffusion and dipolar, repulsive exciton-exciton\ninteraction.\n", "  We analyze the fermionic quasinormal modes of the BTZ black hole in the\npresence of space-time noncommutativity. Our analysis exploits a duality\nbetween a spinless and spinning BTZ black hole, the spin being proportional to\nthe noncommutative deformation parameter. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we\nshow that the horizon temperatures obtained from the dual CFT pick up\nnoncommutative contributions. We demonstrate the equivalence between the\nquasinormal and non-quasinormal modes for the noncommutative fermionic probes,\nwhich provides further evidence of holography in the noncommutative setting.\nFinally we present an analysis of the emission of Dirac fermions and the\ncorresponding tunneling amplitude within this noncommutative framework.\n", "  We present a simple model for estimating the probability of interplanetary\npanspermia in the recently discovered system of seven planets orbiting the\nultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, and find that panspermia is potentially orders\nof magnitude more likely to occur in the TRAPPIST-1 system compared to the\nEarth-to-Mars case. As a consequence, we argue that the probability of\nabiogenesis is enhanced on the TRAPPIST-1 planets compared to the Solar system.\nBy adopting models from theoretical ecology, we show that the number of species\ntransferred and the number of life-bearing planets is also likely to be higher,\nbecause of the increased rates of immigration. We propose observational metrics\nfor evaluating whether life was initiated by panspermia on multiple planets in\nthe TRAPPIST-1 system. These results are also applicable to habitable\nexoplanets and exomoons in other planetary systems.\n", "  We present a multipolar model of surface - lattice resonances (SLRs) in 2d\narrays of spheres including the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric\nquadrupole moments of the spheres. We identify SLRs of dipolar and multipolar\ncharacter, show the importance of non-resonant multipoles in their description,\nand discuss the sensitivity of SLRs to illumination conditions. We link SLRs to\nan excitation of modes supported by the array, and we propose a simplified\nmodel of the mode dispersion relations that explains the sensitivity of SLRs\nand the band gap in mode dispersion found at low frequencies. Finally we\ndiscuss the resonant features associated with a direct coupling to a mode which\ncan occur in addition to the diffractive coupling signalled by SLRs.\n", "  We provide a full analysis of ghost free higher derivative field theories\nwith coupled degrees of freedom. Assuming the absence of gauge symmetries, we\nderive the degeneracy conditions in order to evade the Ostrogradsky ghosts, and\nanalyze which (non)trivial classes of solutions this allows for. It is shown\nexplicitly how Lorentz invariance avoids the propagation of \"half\" degrees of\nfreedom. Moreover, for a large class of theories, we construct the field\nredefinitions and/or (extended) contact transformations that put the theory in\na manifestly first order form. Finally, we identify which class of theories\ncannot be brought to first order form by such transformations.\n", "  A novel algorithm to reconstruct neutrino-induced particle showers within the\nANTARES neutrino telescope is presented. The method achieves a median angular\nresolution of $6^\\circ$ for shower energies below 100 TeV. Applying this\nalgorithm to 6 years of data taken with the ANTARES detector, 8 events with\nreconstructed shower energies above 10 TeV are observed. This is consistent\nwith the expectation of about 5 events from atmospheric backgrounds, but also\ncompatible with diffuse astrophysical flux measurements by the IceCube\ncollaboration, from which 2 - 4 additional events are expected. A 90% C.L.\nupper limit on the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux with a value per\nneutrino flavour of $E^2\\cdot \\Phi^{90\\%} = 4.9 \\cdot 10^{-8}$ GeV $\\cdot$\ncm$^{-2} \\cdot$ s$^{-1} \\cdot$ sr$^{-1}$ is set, applicable to the energy range\nfrom 23 TeV to 7.8 PeV, assuming an unbroken $E^{-2}$ spectrum and neutrino\nflavour equipartition at Earth.\n", "  We briefly review the historical development of the ideas regarding the first\nsupermassive black hole seeds, the physics of their formation and radiative\nfeedback, recent theoretical and observational progress, and our outlook for\nthe future.\n", "  A quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator is a novel two-dimensional quantum state\nof matter that features quantized Hall conductance in the absence of magnetic\nfield, resulting from topologically protected dissipationless edge states that\nbridge the energy gap opened by band inversion and strong spin-orbit coupling.\nBy investigating electronic structure of epitaxially grown monolayer 1T'-WTe2\nusing angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and first principle calculations, we\nobserve clear signatures of the topological band inversion and the band gap\nopening, which are the hallmarks of a QSH state. Scanning tunneling microscopy\nmeasurements further confirm the correct crystal structure and the existence of\na bulk band gap, and provide evidence for a modified electronic structure near\nthe edge that is consistent with the expectations for a QSH insulator. Our\nresults establish monolayer 1T'-WTe2 as a new class of QSH insulator with large\nband gap in a robust two-dimensional materials family of transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs).\n", "  Dark matter seems to account for flat velocity curves in spiral galaxies,\nwith further evidence for dark matter from observations of the colliding\n\"bullet cluster\" galaxies 1E0657-56. However, the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation and the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation have been cited\n(arXiv:1112.3960) as \"challenges for the LambdaCDM model.\" MOND (MOdified\nNewtonian Dynamics), a modified law of gravity,is invoked in arXiv:1112.3960 to\naccount for those relations.\n  This note shows that the HLSS model in arXiv:1301.0304, employing the\nholographic principle within the standard LambdaCDM paradigm, readily accounts\nfor the MOND acceleration, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, and the mass\ndiscrepancy-acceleration relation. After first posting this note, I learned\nthat Man Ho Chan (arXiv:1310.6801) previously reached the same conclusion using\na dark matter based analysis independent of the holographic approach used in\nthis paper. These results indicate that the MOND hypothesis is unnecessary.\n", "  We extend the superconductor's free energy to include an interaction of the\norder parameter with the curvature of space-time. This interaction leads to\ngeometry dependent coherence length and Ginzburg-Landau parameter which\nsuggests that the curvature of space-time can change the superconductor's type.\nThe curvature of space-time doesn't affect the ideal diamagnetism of the\nsuperconductor but acts as chemical potential. In a particular circumstance,\nthe geometric field becomes order-parameter dependent, therefore the\nsuperconductor's order parameter dynamics affects the curvature of space-time\nand electrical or internal quantum mechanical energy can be channelled into the\ncurvature of space-time. Experimental consequences are discussed.\n", "  Atmospheric water vapour is an essential ingredient of weather and climate.\nKey features of its distribution can be represented by kinematic models which\ntreat it as a passive scalar advected by a prescribed flow and reacting through\ncondensation. Condensation acts as a sink that maintains specific humidity\nbelow a prescribed, space-dependent saturation value. In order to investigate\nhow the interplay between large-scale advection, small-scale turbulence and\ncondensation controls the moisture distribution, we develop simple kinematic\nmodels which combine a single circulating flow with a Brownian-motion\nrepresentation of turbulence. We first study the drying mechanism of a\nwater-vapour anomaly released inside a vortex at an initial time. Next, we\nconsider a cellular flow with a moisture source at a boundary. The\nstatistically steady state attained shows features reminiscent of the Hadley\ncell such as boundary layers, a region of intense precipitation and a relative\nhumidity minimum. Explicit results provide a detailed characterisation of these\nfeatures in the limit of strong flow.\n", "  Memristors based on a double barrier design have been analysed by various\nnano spectroscopic methods to unveil details about its microstructure and\nconduction mechanism. The device consists of an AlOx tunnel barrier and a\nNbOy/Au Schottky barrier sandwiched between Nb bottom electrode and Au top\nelectrode. As it was anticipated that the local chemical composition of the\ntunnel barrier, i.e. oxidation state of the metals as well as concentration and\ndistribution of oxygen ions, have a major influence on electronic conduction,\nthese factors were carefully analysed. A combined approach was chosen in order\nto reliably investigate electronic states of Nb and O by electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy as well as map elements whose transition edges exhibit a different\nenergy range by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy like Au and Al. The\nresults conclusively demonstrate significant oxidation of the bottom electrode\nas well as a small oxygen vacancy concentration in the Al oxide tunnel barrier.\nPossible scenarios to explain this unexpected additional oxide layer are\ndiscussed and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were applied in order to identify\nits influence on conduction mechanisms in the device. In light of the strong\ndeviations between observed and originally sought layout, this study highlights\nthe robustness in terms of structural deviations of the double barrier\nmemristor device.\n", "  The flow of the low energy eigenstates of a $U_q[sl(2|1)]$ superspin chain\nwith alternating fundamental ($3$) and dual ($\\bar{3}$) representations is\nstudied as function of a twist angle determining the boundary conditions. The\nfinite size spectrum is characterized in terms of scaling dimensions and quasi\nmomenta representing the two families of commuting transfer matrices for the\nmodel which are even and odd under the interchange $3\\leftrightarrow \\bar{3}$,\nrespectively. Based on the extrapolation of our finite size data we find that\nunder a variation of the boundary conditions from periodic to antiperiodic for\nthe fermionic degrees of freedom levels from the continuous part of the\nspectrum flow into discrete levels and vice versa.\n", "  We describe the fission dynamics of $^{240}$Pu within an implementation of\nthe Density Functional Theory (DFT) extended to superfluid systems and\nreal-time dynamics. We demonstrate the critical role played by the pairing\ncorrelations, which even though are not the driving force in this complex\ndynamics, are providing the essential lubricant, without which the nuclear\nshape evolution would come to a screeching halt. The evolution is found to be\nmuch slower than previously expected in this fully non-adiabatic treatment of\nnuclear dynamics, where there are no symmetry restrictions and all collective\ndegrees of freedom (CDOF) are allowed to participate in the dynamics.\n", "  We develop a magneto-elastic (ME) coupling model for the interaction between\nthe vortex lattice and crystal elasticity. The theory extends the Kogan-Clem's\nanisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model to include the elasticity effect. The\nanisotropies in superconductivity and elasticity are simultaneously considered\nin the GL theory frame. We compare the field and angular dependences of the\nmagnetization to the relevant experiments. The contribution of the ME\ninteraction to the magnetization is comparable to the vortex-lattice energy, in\nmaterials with relatively strong pressure dependence of the critical\ntemperature. The theory can give the appropriate slope of the field dependence\nof magnetization near the upper critical field. The magnetization ratio along\ndifferent vortex frame axes is independent with the ME interaction. The\ntheoretical description of the magnetization ratio is applicable only if the\napplied field moderately close to the upper critical field.\n", "  The outskirts of galaxy clusters are characterised by the interplay of gas\naccretion and dynamical evolution involving turbulence, shocks, magnetic fields\nand diffuse radio emission. The density and velocity structure of the gas in\nthe outskirts provide an effective pressure support and affect all processes\nlisted above. Therefore it is important to resolve and properly model the\nturbulent flow in these mildly overdense and relatively large cluster regions;\nthis is a challenging task for hydrodynamical codes. In this work, grid-based\nsimulations of a galaxy cluster are presented. The simulations are performed\nusing adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) based on the regional variability of\nvorticity, and they include a subgrid scale model (SGS) for unresolved\nturbulence. The implemented AMR strategy is more effective in resolving the\nturbulent flow in the cluster outskirts than any previously used criterion\nbased on overdensity. We study a cluster undergoing a major merger, which\ndrives turbulence in the medium. The merger dominates the cluster energy budget\nout to a few virial radii from the centre. In these regions the shocked\nintra-cluster medium is resolved and the SGS turbulence is modelled, and\ncompared with diagnostics on larger length scale. The volume-filling factor of\nthe flow with large vorticity is about 60% at low redshift in the cluster\noutskirts, and thus smaller than in the cluster core. In the framework of\nmodelling radio relics, this point suggests that upstream flow inhomogeneities\nmight affect pre-existing cosmic-ray population and magnetic fields, and the\nresulting radio emission.\n", "  Results are presented from a semi-coherent search for continuous\ngravitational waves from the brightest low-mass X-ray binary, Scorpius X-1,\nusing data collected during the first Advanced LIGO observing run (O1). The\nsearch combines a frequency domain matched filter (Bessel-weighted\n$\\mathcal{F}$-statistic) with a hidden Markov model to track wandering of the\nneutron star spin frequency. No evidence of gravitational waves is found in the\nfrequency range 60-650 Hz. Frequentist 95% confidence strain upper limits,\n$h_0^{95\\%} = 4.0\\times10^{-25}$, $8.3\\times10^{-25}$, and $3.0\\times10^{-25}$\nfor electromagnetically restricted source orientation, unknown polarization,\nand circular polarization, respectively, are reported at 106 Hz. They are $\\leq\n10$ times higher than the theoretical torque-balance limit at 106 Hz.\n", "  We study the loss of coherence of electrochemical oscillations on meso- and\nnanosized electrodes with numeric simulations of the electrochemical master\nequation for a prototypical electrochemical oscillator, the hydrogen peroxide\nreduction on Pt electrodes in the presence of halides. On nanoelectrodes, the\nelectrode potential changes whenever a stochastic electron-transfer event takes\nplace. Electrochemical reaction rate coefficients depend exponentially on the\nelectrode potential and become thus fluctuating quantities as well. Therefore,\nalso the transition rates between system states become time-dependent which\nconstitutes a fundamental difference to purely chemical nanoscale oscillators.\nThree implications are demonstrated: (a) oscillations and steady states shift\nin phase space with decreasing system size, thereby also decreasing\nconsiderably the oscillating parameter regions; (b) the minimal number of\nmolecules necessary to support correlated oscillations is more than 10 times as\nlarge as for nanoscale chemical oscillators; (c) the relation between\ncorrelation time and variance of the period of the oscillations predicted for\nchemical oscillators in the weak noise limit is only fulfilled in a very\nrestricted parameter range for the electrochemical nano-oscillator.\n", "  Transition metal oxides are promising candidates for thermoelectric\napplications, because they are stable at high temperature and because strong\nelectronic correlations can generate large Seebeck coefficients, but their\nthermoelectric power factors are limited by the low electrical conductivity. We\nreport transport measurements on Ca3Co4O9 films on various perovskite\nsubstrates and show that reversible incorporation of oxygen into SrTiO3 and\nLaAlO3 substrates activates a parallel conduction channel for p-type carriers,\ngreatly enhancing the thermoelectric performance of the film-substrate system\nat temperatures above 450 {\\deg}C. Thin-film structures that take advantage of\nboth electronic correlations and the high oxygen mobility of transition metal\noxides thus open up new perspectives for thermopower generation at high\ntemperature.\n", "  The principles of the thermoelectric phenomenon, including Seebeck effect,\nPeltier effect, and Thomson effect are discussed. The dependence of the\nthermoelectric devices on the figure of merit, Seebeck coefficient, electrical\nconductivity, and thermal conductivity are explained in details. The paper\nprovides an overview of the different types of thermoelectric materials,\nexplains the techniques used to grow thin films for these materials, and\ndiscusses future research and development trends for this technology.\n", "  The synthesis of non-magnetic 2D dielectric cloaks as proper solutions of an\ninverse scattering problem is addressed in this paper. Adopting the relevant\nintegral formulation governing the scattering phenomena, analytic and numerical\napproaches are exploited to provide new insights on how frequency and direction\nof arrival of the incoming wave may influence the cloaking mechanism in terms\nof permittivity distribution within the cover region. In quasi-static\n(subwavelength) regime a solution is analytically derived in terms of\nhomogeneous artificial dielectric cover with $\\varepsilon<\\varepsilon_0$ which\nis found to be a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving\nomnidirectional cloaking. On the other hand, beyond quasi-static regime, the\ncloaking problem is addressed as an optimization task looking for only natural\ndielectric coatings with $\\varepsilon>\\varepsilon_0$ able to hide the object\nfor a given number of directions of the incident field. Simulated results\nconfirm the validity of both analytic and numerical methodologies and allow to\nestimate effective bandwidths both in terms of frequency range and direction of\narrival of the impinging field.\n", "  We extend the classical results on the symmetry inheritance of the canonical\nelectromagnetic fields, described by the Maxwell's Lagrangian, to a much wider\nclass of models, which include those of the Born-Infeld, power Maxwell and the\nEuler-Heisenberg type. Symmetry inheriting fields allow the introduction of\nelectromagnetic scalar potentials and these are proven to be constant on the\nKilling horizons. Finally, using the relations obtained along the analysis, we\ngeneralize and simplify the recent proof for the symmetry inheritance of the\n3-dimensional case, as well as give the first constraint for the higher\ndimensional electromagnetic fields.\n", "  We present a fluctuation theorem for quantum bipartite systems in which the\nsubsystems exchange information with each other. Our information fluctuation\ntheorem includes correlations by introducing a quantum mechanical mutual\ninformation content and a statistical probability distribution which allows one\nto consider statistical averages when computing the thermodynamic and\ninformational quantities. The fundamental limit of heat transferred from a heat\nreservoir for quantum bipartite systems involving the quantum mutual\ninformation is then derived. We illustrate the use of our thermodynamic\ninequality in quantum computing and discuss our results in terms of Landauer's\nprinciple.\n", "  The influence of external magnetic field switching $\"$on$\"$ and $\"$off$\"$ on\nthe non-stationary spin-polarized currents in the system of correlated\nsingle-level quantum dot coupled to non-magnetic electronic reservoirs has been\nanalyzed. It was shown that considered system can be used for the effective\nspin filtering by analyzing its non-stationary characteristics in particular\nrange of applied bias voltage.\n", "  We theoretically study the dynamic time evolution following laser pulse\npumping in an antiferromagnetic insulator Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$. From the\nphotoexcited high-spin quartet states to the long-lived low-spin doublet\nstates, the ultrafast demagnetization processes are investigated by solving the\ndissipative Schr\\\"odinger equation. We find that the demagnetization times are\nof the order of hundreds of femtosecond, in good agreement with recent\nexperiments. The switching times could be strongly reduced by properly tuning\nthe energy gaps between the multiplet energy levels of Cr$^{3+}$. Furthermore,\nthe relaxation times also depend on the hybridization of atomic orbitals in the\nfirst photoexcited state. Our results suggest that the selective manipulation\nof electronic structure by engineering stress-strain or chemical substitution\nallows effective control of the magnetic state switching in photoexcited\ninsulating transition-metal oxides.\n", "  Many bosonic (fermionic) fractional quantum Hall states, such as Laughlin,\nMoore-Read and Read-Rezayi wavefunctions, belong to a special class of\northogonal polynomials: the Jack polynomials (times a Vandermonde determinant).\nThis fundamental observation allows to point out two different recurrence\nrelations for the coefficients of the permanent (Slater) decomposition of the\nbosonic (fermionic) states. Here we provide an explicit Fock space\nrepresentation for these wavefunctions by introducing a two-body squeezing\noperator which represents them as a Jastrow operator applied to reference\nstates, which are in general simple periodic one dimensional patterns.\nRemarkably, this operator representation is the same for bosons and fermions,\nand the different nature of the two recurrence relations is an outcome of\nparticle statistics.\n", "  The Shockley-Queisser limit is one of the most fundamental results in the\nfield of photovoltaics. Based on the principle of detailed balance, it defines\nan upper limit for a single junction solar cell that uses an absorber material\nwith a specific band gap. Although methods exist that allow a solar cell to\nexceed the Shockley-Queisser limit, here we show that it is possible to exceed\nthe Shockley-Queisser limit without considering any of these additions. Merely\nby introducing an absorptivity that does not assume that every photon with an\nenergy above the band gap is absorbed, efficiencies above the Shockley-Queisser\nlimit are obtained. This is related to the fact that assuming optimal\nabsorption properties also maximizes the recombination current within the\ndetailed balance approach. We conclude that considering a finite thickness for\nthe absorber layer allows the efficiency to exceed the Shockley-Queisser limit,\nand that this is more likely to occur for materials with small band gaps.\n", "  We investigated the effect of out-of-plane crumpling on the mechanical\nresponse of graphene membranes. In our experiments, stress was applied to\ngraphene membranes using pressurized gas while the strain state was monitored\nthrough two complementary techniques: interferometric profilometry and Raman\nspectroscopy. By comparing the data obtained through these two techniques, we\ndetermined the geometric hidden area which quantifies the crumpling strength.\nWhile the devices with hidden area $\\sim0~\\%$ obeyed linear mechanics with\nbiaxial stiffness $428\\pm10$ N/m, specimens with hidden area in the range\n$0.5-1.0~\\%$ were found to obey an anomalous Hooke's law with an exponent\n$\\sim0.1$.\n", "  We introduce and investigate new models of the Chern-Simons type in the\nthree-dimensional spacetime, focusing on the existence of compact vortices. The\nmodels are controlled by potentials driven by a single real parameter that can\nbe used to change the profile of the vortex solutions as they approach their\nboundary values. One of the models unveils an interesting new behavior, the\ntendency to make the vortex compact, as the parameter increases to larger and\nlarger values. We also investigate the behavior of the energy density and\ncalculate the total energy numerically.\n", "  I give a brief overview of arXiv history, and describe the current state of\narXiv practice, both technical and sociological. This commentary originally\nappeared in the EMBO Journal, 19 Oct 2016. It was intended as an update on\ncomments from the late 1990s regarding use of preprints by biologists (or lack\nthereof), but may be of interest to practitioners of other disciplines. It is\nbased largely on a keynote presentation I gave to the ASAPbio inaugural meeting\nin Feb 2016, and responds as well to some follow-up questions.\n", "  Super-Eddington accretion has been suggested as a possible formation pathway\nof $10^9 \\, M_\\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) 800 Myr after the Big\nBang. However, stellar feedback from BH seed progenitors and winds from BH\naccretion disks may decrease BH accretion rates. In this work, we study the\nimpact of these physical processes on the formation of $z \\sim 6$ quasar,\nincluding new physical prescriptions in the cosmological, data-constrained\nsemi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust. We find that the feedback produced by the\nfirst stellar progenitors on the surrounding does not play a relevant role in\npreventing SMBHs formation. In order to grow the $z \\gtrsim 6$ SMBHs, the\naccreted gas must efficiently lose angular momentum. Moreover disk winds,\neasily originated in super-Eddington accretion regime, can strongly reduce duty\ncycles. This produces a decrease in the active fraction among the progenitors\nof $z\\sim6$ bright quasars, reducing the probability to observe them.\n", "  Using a specially designed experimental set up, we have studied the so-called\ncontinuous to intermittent flow transition in sand piles confined in a\nHele-Shaw cell where the deposition height of the sand can be controlled.\nThrough systematic measurements varying the height and the input flow, we have\nestablished, for the first time, how the size of the pile at which the\ntransition takes place depends on the two parameters studied. The results\nobtained allows to explain, at least semi-quantitatively, the observations\ncommonly reported in the literature, carried out in experiments where the\ndeposition height is not controlled.\n", "  We point out that two of Milne's fourth-order integrators are well-suited to\nbit-reversible simulations. The fourth-order method improves on the accuracy of\nLevesque and Verlet's algorithm and simplifies the definition of the velocity\n$v$ and energy $e = (q^2 + v^2)/2$ . ( We use this one-dimensional oscillator\nproblem as an illustration throughout this paper ). Milne's integrator is\nparticularly useful for the analysis of Lyapunov ( exponential ) instability in\ndynamical systems, including manybody molecular dynamics. We include the\ndetails necessary to the implementation of Milne's Algorithms.\n", "  The investigation of single atoms in solids, with both optical and nuclear\nspin access is of particularly interest with applications ranging from\nnanoscale sensing to quantum computation. Here, we study the optical and spin\nproperties of single praseodymium ions in an yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)\ncrystal at cryogenic temperature. The single nuclear spin of single\npraseodymium ions is detected through a background-free optical upconverting\nreadout technique. Single ions show stable photoluminescence (PLE) with\nspectrally resolved hyperfine splitting of the praseodymium ground state. Based\non this measurement, optical Rabi and optically detected magnetic resonance\n(ODMR) measurements are performed to study the spin coherence properties. Our\nresults reveal that the spin coherence time of single praseodymium nuclear\nspins is limited by the strong spin-phonon coupling at experimental\ntemperature.\n", "  As shown in former papers, the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model presents a novel\nmechanism of Cooper pair formation which is not the result of an attractive\nelectron-electron interaction but can be described in terms of quantum\nmechanical constraining forces. This mechanism operates in narrow, roughly\nhalf-filled superconducting bands of special symmetry and is evidently\nresponsible for the formation of Cooper pairs in all superconductors. Here we\nconsider this new mechanism within an outer magnetic field. We show that in the\nmagnetic field the constraining forces produce Cooper pairs of non-vanishing\ntotal momentum with the consequence that an electric current flows within the\nsuperconductor. This current satisfies the London equations and, consequently,\nleads to the Meissner effect. This theoretical result is confirmed by the\nexperimental observation that all superconductors, whether conventional or\nunconventional, exhibit the Meissner effect.\n", "  Lithium niobate (LN) exhibits unique material characteristics that have found\nmany important applications. Scaling LN devices down to a nanoscopic scale can\ndramatically enhance light-matter interaction that would enable nonlinear and\nquantum photonic functionalities beyond the reach of conventional means.\nHowever, developing LN-based nanophotonic devices turns out to be nontrivial.\nAlthough significant efforts have been devoted in recent years, LN photonic\ncrystal structures developed to date exhibit fairly low quality. Here we\ndemonstrate LN photonic crystal nanobeam resonators with optical Q as high as\n10^5, more than two orders of magnitude higher than other LN nanocavities\nreported to date. The high optical quality together with tight mode confinement\nleads to extremely strong nonlinear photorefractive effect, with a resonance\ntuning rate of 0.64 GHz/aJ, or equivalently 84 MHz/photon, three orders of\nmagnitude greater than other LN resonators. In particular, we observed\nintriguing quenching of photorefraction that has never been reported before.\nThe devices also exhibit strong optomechanical coupling with gigahertz\nnanomechanical mode with a significant f*Q product of 1.47*10^12 Hz. The\ndemonstration of high-Q LN photonic crystal nanoresonators paves a crucial step\ntowards LN nanophotonics that could integrate the outstanding material\nproperties with versatile nanoscale device engineering for diverse intriguing\nfunctionalities.\n", "  We propose to study of the light speed isotropy and Lorentz invariance at\nJefferson Laboratory by means of the measurements of the Compton Edge using of\nthe Hall A/C existing experimental setup. Methodologically the same experiment\nhas already been successfully elaborated at GRAAL experiment at the European\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble with 6 GeV electron beam. This\nProposal states two goals expected to be reached at Jefferson Laboratory, both\non Lorentz invariance: (a) the one-way light speed isotropy testing accuracy,\nfollowing from conservative evaluations at numerical simulations, to about an\norder of magnitude better than was GRAAL's; (b) the dependence of the light\nspeed on the velocity of the apparatus (Kennedy-Thorndike measurement) will be\ntraced to an accuracy about 3 orders of magnitudes better than the available\nlimits.\n", "  The phenomenon of upconversion, in which a system sequentially absorbs two or\nmore photons and emits a photon of a higher frequency, has been used in\nnumerous applications. These include high-resolution non-destructive\nbioimaging, deep-penetrating photodynamic therapy, and photovoltaic devices.\nDue to the multi-photon mechanism of upconversion, its quantum yield cannot\nexceed 50%. We propose a new mechanism of upconversion, which is based on\nsingle-photon absorption; in this process, unlike in multiple-photon\nupconversion, the quantum yield can be higher than 50%. We show that in a\nsystem of two atoms interacting with a reservoir, a low-frequency excitation of\none atom can be upconverted into a high-frequency excitation of another atom.\nThe energy required for such an upconversion is drawn from the reservoir, which\ndestroys coherence. Decoherence leads to the transition of the system from the\npure state with a small energy dispersion to the mixed state with greater\ndispersion of energy, while the system entropy increases. The phenomenon of\nsingle-photon upconversion can be used to increase the efficacy of devices\nutilizing upconversion.\n", "  The Painleve-IV equation has three families of rational solutions generated\nby the generalized Hermite polynomials. Each family is indexed by two positive\nintegers m and n. These functions have applications to nonlinear wave\nequations, random matrices, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics. Numerical\nstudies suggest the zeros and poles form a deformed n by m rectangular grid.\nProperly scaled, the zeros and poles appear to densely fill certain curvilinear\nrectangles as m and n tend to infinity with r=m/n fixed. Generalizing a method\nof Bertola and Bothner used to study rational Painleve-II functions, we express\nthe generalized Hermite rational Painleve-IV functions in terms of certain\northogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear\nsteepest-descent method, we asymptotically analyze the associated\nRiemann-Hilbert problem in the limit as n tends to infinity with m=r*n for r\nfixed. We obtain an explicit characterization of the boundary curve and\ndetermine the leading-order asymptotic expansion of the functions in the\npole-free region.\n", "  Stabilizing defects in liquid-crystal systems is crucial for many physical\nprocesses and applications ranging from functionalizing liquid-crystal textures\nto recently reported command of chaotic behaviors of active matters. In this\nwork, we perform analytical calculations to study the curvature driven\nstability mechanism of defects based on the isotropic nematic disk model that\nis free of any topological constraint. We show that in a growing spherical disk\ncovering a sphere the accumulation of curvature effect can prevent typical +1\nand +1/2 defects from forming boojum textures where the defects are repelled to\nthe boundary of the disk. Our calculations reveal that the movement of the\nequilibrium position of the +1 defect from the boundary to the center of the\nspherical disk occurs in a very narrow window of the disk area, exhibiting the\nfirst-order phase-transition-like behavior. For the pair of +1/2 defects by\nsplitting a +1 defect, we find the curvature driven alternating repulsive and\nattractive interactions between the two defects. With the growth of the\nspherical disk these two defects tend to approach and finally recombine towards\na +1 defect texture. The sensitive response of defects to curvature and the\ncurvature driven stability mechanism demonstrated in this work in nematic disk\nsystems may have implications towards versatile control and engineering of\nliquid crystal textures in various applications.\n", "  We present a variational formulation for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system\nbased on a free energy Lagrangian. This formulation is a systematic infinite\ndimensional extension of the variational approach to the thermodynamics of\ndiscrete systems using the free energy, which complements the Lagrangian\nvariational formulation using the internal energy developed in \\cite{GBYo2016b}\nas one employs temperature, rather than entropy, as an independent variable.\nThe variational derivation is first expressed in the material (or Lagrangian)\nrepresentation, from which the spatial (or Eulerian) representation is deduced.\nThe variational framework is intrinsically written in a differential-geometric\nform that allows the treatment of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system on\nRiemannian manifolds.\n", "  The self-starting dynamics of a model for passively mode-locked lasers with\nsaturable absorber, in which the optical amplifier has a saturable\nnonlinearity, is examined. The basic assumption is that the laser will operate\nin the mode-locked regime when the continuous-wave regime becomes unstable.\nWithin the framework of the modulational-instability analysis, a global map for\nthe laser self-starting criteria is constructed. According to this map, the\nsaturable nonlinearity enhances the input-field intensity required for laser\nself-starting. Analytical expression of the zero modulation-frequency regime of\nthis threshold input field is derived, which turns out to be valid in the\nnormal as well as in the anomalous dispersion regime, where evidence of\nself-starting is also given.\n", "  Carbon dioxide fixation and storage constitute a drastically important\nproblem for the humanity nowadays. We hereby publish a new solution based on\nthe alkaline earth salts with a weakly coordinating anion,\ntetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. The proposed solution was validated using a\nrobust combination of global minimum search and molecular dynamics simulations\nutilizing a well-tested, reliable semiempirical Hamiltonian to monitor chemical\nreactions. Calcium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 5.5 CO2 molecules\nper mole, whereas barium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 3.6 CO2\nmolecules per mole. These capacities are much higher, as compared to the\nestablished carbonate technology, which fixes only one CO2 molecule per one\nmetal atom. The conducted simulations reveal that electrostatic binding of CO2\nto alkaline earth cations is more technologically interesting than formation of\ncarbonate salts. Our simulation results can be directly validated by sorption\nmeasurements.\n", "  Development of new greenhouse gas scavengers is actively pursued nowadays.\nVolatility caused solvent consumption and significant regeneration costs\nassociated with the aqueous amine solutions motivate search for more\ntechnologically and economically advanced solutions. We hereby used hybrid\ndensity functional theory to characterize thermodynamics, structure, electronic\nand solvation properties of amino and carboxamido functionalized C60 fullerene.\nC60 is non-volatile and supports a large density of amino groups on its\nsurface. Attachment of polar groups to fullerene C60 adjusts its dipole moment\nand band gap quite substantially, ultimately resulting in systematically better\nhydration thermodynamics. Reaction of polyaminofullerenes with CO2 is favored\nenthalpically, but prohibited entropically at standard conditions. Free energy\nof the CO2 capture by polyaminofullerenes is non-sensitive to the number of\namino groups per fullerene. This result fosters consideration of\npolyaminofullerenes for CO2 fixation.\n", "  In recent years, inverse spectra were investigated with imaging optics and a\nquantitative description with radiometric units was suggested (Rang 2015). It\ncould be shown that inverse spectra complement each other additively to a\nconstant intensity level. Since optical intensity in radiometric units is a\npower area density, it can be expected that energy densities of inverse spectra\nalso fulfill an inversion equation and complement each other. In this\ncontribution we report findings on a measurement of the power area density of\ninverse spectra for the near ultraviolet, visible and the infrared spectral\nrange. They show the existence of corresponding spectral regions ultra-yellow\n(UY) and infra-cyan (IC) in the inverted spectrum and thereby present\nadditional experimental evidence for equivalence of inverse spectra beyond the\nvisible range.\n", "  Measuring influence and determining what drives it are persistent questions\nin political science and in network analysis more generally. Herein we focus on\nthe domain of international relations. Our major substantive question is: How\ncan we determine what characteristics make an actor influential? To address the\ntopic of influence, we build on a multilinear tensor regression framework\n(MLTR) that captures influence relationships using a tensor generalization of a\nvector autoregression model. Influence relationships in that approach are\ncaptured in a pair of n x n matrices and provide measurements of how the\nnetwork actions of one actor may influence the future actions of another. A\nlimitation of the MLTR and earlier latent space approaches is that there are no\ndirect mechanisms through which to explain why a certain actor is more or less\ninfluential than others. Our new framework, social influence regression,\nprovides a way to statistically model the influence of one actor on another as\na function of characteristics of the actors. Thus we can move beyond just\nestimating that an actor influences another to understanding why. To highlight\nthe utility of this approach, we apply it to studying monthly-level conflictual\nevents between countries as measured through the Integrated Crisis Early\nWarning System (ICEWS) event data project.\n", "  The SDSS-III APOGEE DR12 is a unique resource to search for stars beyond the\ntidal radii of star clusters. We have examined the APOGEE DR12 database for new\ncandidates of the young star cluster Palomar 1, a system with previously\nreported tidal tails (Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010). The APOGEE ASPCAP\ndatabase includes spectra and stellar parameters for two known members of Pal 1\n(Stars I and II), however these do not agree with the stellar parameters\ndetermined from optical spectra by Sakari et al. (2011). We find that the\nAPOGEE analysis of these two stars is strongly affected by the known\npersistence problem (Majewski et al. 2015; Nidever et al. 2015). By\nre-examining the individual visits, and removing the blue (and sometimes green)\nAPOGEE detector spectra affected by persistence, then we find excellent\nagreement in a re-analysis of the combined spectra. These methods are applied\nto another five stars in the APOGEE field with similar radial velocities and\nmetallicities as those of Pal 1. Only one of these new candidates, Star F, may\nbe a member located in the tidal tail based on its heliocentric radial\nvelocity, metallicity, and chemistry. The other four candidates are not well\naligned with the tidal tails, and comparison to the Besancon model (Robin et\nal. 2003) suggests that they are more likely to be non-members, i.e. part of\nthe Galactic halo. This APOGEE field could be re-examined for other new\ncandidates if the persistence problem can be removed from the APOGEE spectral\ndatabase.\n", "  We review discoveries in the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime, largely\nmade possible by numerical solutions of Einstein's equations. We discuss\ncritical phenomena and self-similarity in gravitational collapse, the behavior\nof spacetime curvature near singularities, the instability of black strings in\n5 spacetime dimensions, and the collision of four-dimensional black holes. We\nalso discuss the prospects for further discoveries in geometrodynamics via\nobservation of gravitational waves.\n", "  At the 33rd ICRC, we reported the possible detection of solar gamma rays by a\nground level detector and later re-examined this event. On March 7, 2011, the\nsolar neutron telescope (SNT) located at Mt. Sierra Negra, Mexico (4,600 m)\nobserved enhancements of the counting rate from 19:49 to 20:02 UT and from\n20:50 to 21:01 UT. The statistical significance was 9.7sigma and 8.5sigma,\nrespectively. This paper discusses the possibility of using this mountain\ndetector to detect solar gamma rays. In association with this event, the solar\nneutron detector SEDA-FIB onboard the International Space Station has also\ndetected solar neutrons with a statistical significance of 7.5sigma. The\nFERMI-LAT detector also observed high-energy gamma rays from this flare with a\nstatistical significance of 6.7sigma. We thus attempted to make a unified model\nto explain this data. In this paper, we report on another candidate for solar\ngamma rays detected on September 25th, 2011 by the SNT located in Tibet (4,300\nm) from 04:37 to 04:47 UT with a statistical significance of 8.0sigma (by the\nLi-Ma method).\n", "  Disease, opinions, ideas, gossip, etc. all spread on social networks. How\nthese networks are connected (the network structure) influences the dynamics of\nthe spreading processes. By investigating these relationships one gains\nunderstanding both of the spreading itself and the structure and function of\nthe contact network. In this chapter, we will summarize the recent literature\nusing simulation of spreading processes on top of empirical contact data. We\nwill mostly focus on disease simulations on temporal proximity networks --\nnetworks recording who is close to whom, at what time -- but also cover other\ntypes of networks and spreading processes. We analyze 29 empirical networks to\nillustrate the methods.\n", "  Starting with the first-order singular Lagrangian describing the dynamical\nsystem with 2nd-class constraints, the noncommutative quantum mechanics on a\ncurved space is investigated by the constraint star-product quantization\nformalism of the projection operator method. Imposing the additional\nconstraints to eliminate the reduntant degrees of freedom, it is shown that the\nresultant noncommutative quantum system on the curved space is represented with\ntwo kinds of the constrained quantum systems, which are equivalent with each\nother. Then, it is shown that the resultant Hamiltonians contain the quantum\ncorrections caused by the uncertainty relations among the constraint-operators\nin addition to those due to the projections of operators, which are missed in\nthe usual approaches with the Dirac-bracket quantization formalism.\n", "  The aim of this thesis was to perform the drift chamber calibration and\ncharged particles 3d track reconstruction for the P349 antiproton polarization\nexperiment. A dedicated procedures were designed, implemented and tested on the\nexperimental data for the the D1 drift chamber. The calibration consisted of\nthe drift time offsets determination, estimation of the initial drift time -\nspace relations by means of the homogeneous irradiation method and the\niterative procedure for the time - space relations optimization. Calibration\ncurves for all wire planes of the detector were determined. The obtained\nuncertainties of the hit position reconstruction are in the range of 150 - 220\n$\\rm \\mu m$. Furthermore, based on the prepared 3d track reconstruction angular\ndistribution of tracks passing through the drift chamber were determined.\n", "  There is urgent clinical need to improve the clinical outcome of peripheral\nnerve injury. Many efforts are directed towards the fabrication of\nbioengineered conduits, which could deliver stem cells to the site of injury to\npromote and guide peripheral nerve regeneration. The aim of this study is to\nassess if graphene and related nanomaterials can be useful in the fabrication\nof such conduits. A comparison is made between GO and reduced GO substrates.\nOur results show that the graphene substrates are highly biocompatible, and the\nreduced GO substrates are more effective in ncreasing the gene expression of\nthe biomolecules involved in the regeneration process compared to the other\nsubstrates studied.\n", "  A nonadiabatic and robust method of excitation transfer in a non-Hermitian\ntight-binding linear chain, assisted by an imaginary gauge field, is\ntheoretically proposed. The gauge field undergoes a linear gradient in time,\nfrom a negative to a positive value, which results in an effective transfer of\nexcitation between the two edge sites of the chain. An imaginary (gain and\nloss) gradient of site energy potentials is introduced to exactly cancel\nnonadiabatic effects, thus providing an effective shortcut to adiabaticity and\npseudo-Hermitian dynamics. Numerical simulations indicate that the\nnon-Hermitian excitation transfer method is very robust against disorder in\nhopping rates and site energy of the chain.\n", "  Time reversal is one of the most intriguing yet elusive wave phenomenon of\nmajor interest in different areas of classical and quantum physics. Time\nreversal requires in principle to flip the sign of the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem, leading to a revival of the initial state (Loschmidt echo). Here it is\nshown that Loschmidt echo of photons can be observed in an optical setting\nwithout resorting to reversal of the Hamiltonian. We consider photonic\npropagation in a binary waveguide lattice and show that, by exchanging the two\nsublattices after some propagation distance, a Loschmidt echo can be observed.\nExamples of Loschmidt echoes for single photon and NOON states are given in\none- and two-dimensional waveguide lattices.\n", "  Time reversal in quantum or classical systems described by an Hermitian\nHamiltonian is a physically allowed process, which requires in principle\ninverting the sign of the Hamiltonian. Here we consider the problem of time\nreversal of a subsystem of discrete states coupled to an external environment\ncharacterized by a continuum of states, into which they generally decay. It is\nshown that, by flipping the discrete-continuum coupling from an Hermitian to a\nnon-Hermitian interaction, thus resulting in a non unitary dynamics, time\nreversal of the subsystem of discrete states can be achieved, while the\ncontinuum of states is not reversed. Exact time reversal requires frequency\ndegeneracy of the discrete states, or large frequency mismatch among the\ndiscrete states as compared to the strength of indirect coupling mediated by\nthe continuum. Interestingly, periodic and frequent switch of the\ndiscrete-continuum coupling results in a frozen dynamics of the subsystem of\ndiscrete states.\n", "  In the framework of the ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it is\nknown that a quantum particle in a rapidly-oscillating bound potential with\nvanishing time average can be scattered off or even trapped owing to the\nphenomenon of dynamical (Kapitza) stabilization. A similar phenomenon occurs\nfor scattering and trapping of optical waves. Such a remarkable result stems\nfrom the fact that, even though the particle is not able to follow the rapid\nexternal oscillations of the potential, these are still able to affect the\naverage dynamics by means of an effective -albeit small- nonvanishing potential\ncontribution. Here we consider the scattering and dynamical stabilization\nproblem for matter or classical waves by a bound potential with oscillating ac\namplitude $f(t)$ in the framework of a non-Hermitian extension of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, and predict that for a wide class of imaginary\namplitude modulations $f(t)$ possessing a one-sided Fourier spectrum the\noscillating potential is effectively canceled, i.e. it does not have any effect\nto the particle dynamics, contrary to what happens in the Hermitian case\n", "  In this paper, the behavior of a photovoltaic (PV) system, with maximum power\npoint tracking (MPPT) connected to three-phased grid has been investigated. A\nvoltage source inverter (VSI) has been used to connect the photovoltaic system\nto the grid. The control strategy applied to control inverter switches is based\non voltage mode method. Strategy of this project is that during sunlight the\nsystem sends active power to the grid and at the same time compensates the\nreactive power of the load. In case there is no sunlight, the inverter only\ncompensates the reactive of the load. So the photovoltaic system is operated\nthe whole day. In this paper the behavior of the photovoltaic system to provide\nactive power and compensate reactive power of the load is investigated. The\ntime domain simulation is performed using PSCAD/EMTDC software.\n", "  In this work, the author developed a multiple scattering model for\nheterogeneous elastic continua with strong property fluctuation and obtained\nthe exact solution to the dispersion equation derived from the Dyson equation\nunder the first-order smoothing approximation. The model establishes accurate\nquantitative relation between the microstructural properties and the coherent\nwave propagation parameters and can be used for characterization or inversion\nof microstructures. As applications of the new model, dispersion and\nattenuation curves for coherent waves in the Earth lithosphere, the porous and\ntwo-phase alloys, and human cortical bone are calculated. Detailed analysis\nshows the model can capture the major dispersion and attenuation\ncharacteristics, such as the longitudinal and transverse wave Q-factors and\ntheir ratios, existence of two propagation modes, anomalous negative\ndispersion, nonlinear attenuation-frequency relation, and even the\ndisappearance of coherent waves. Additionally, it helps gain new insights into\na series of longstanding problems, such as the dominant mechanism of seismic\nattenuation and the existence of the Mohorovicic discontinuity. This work\nprovides a general and accurate theoretical framework for quantitative\ncharacterization of microstructures in a broad spectrum of heterogeneous\nmaterials and it is anticipated to have vital applications in seismology,\nultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and biomedical ultrasound.\n", "  In this note we present an explicit realization of the affine vertex algebra\n$V^{cri}(\\frak{gl}(1 \\vert 1)) $ inside of the tensor product $F\\otimes M$\nwhere $F$ is a fermionic verex algebra and $M$ is a commutative vertex algebra.\nThis immediately gives an alternative description of the center of\n$V^{cri}(\\frak{gl}(1 \\vert 1) ) )$ as a subalgebra $M _ 0$ of $M$. We\nreconstruct the Molev-Mukhin formula for the Hilbert-Poincare series of the\ncenter of $V^ {cri}(\\frak{gl}(1 \\vert 1) )$. Moreover, we construct a family of\nirreducible $V^{cri}(\\frak{gl}(1 \\vert 1))$ -modules realized on $F$ and\nparameterized by $\\chi^+, \\chi ^- \\in {\\Bbb C}((z)). $ We propose a\ngeneralization of $V^ {cri}(\\frak{gl}(1 \\vert 1))$ as a critical level version\nof the super $\\mathcal W_{1+\\infty}$ vertex algebra.\n", "  We present experimental results obtained from pipe flows generated by fractal\nshaped orifices or openings. We compare different fractal orifices and their\nefficiencies to re-generate axi-symmetric flows and to return to the standard\nflow generated by a perforated plate or a circular orifice plate. We consider\ntwo families of fractal openings: mono-orifice and complex-orifice and\nemphasize the differences between the two fractal families. For the Reynolds\nnumber we use, we found that there is an optimum iteration for the fractal\nlevel above which no improvement for practical application such as flowmetering\nis to be expected. The main parameters we propose for the characterisation of\nthe fractal orifice are the connexity parameter, the symmetry angle and the gap\nto the wall $\\delta^*_g$. The results presented here are among the firsts for\nflows forced through fractal openings and will serve as reference for future\nstudies and bench marks for numerical applications.\n", "  A fiber-fed Echelle spectrograph at 2.3 m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT),\nKavalur, has been in operation since 2005. Owing to various technological\nadvancements in precision spectroscopy in recent years, several research\navenues have been opened in observational astronomy. These developments have\ncreated a demand to improve the Doppler precision of our spectrograph.\nCurrently, the stability of the instrument is compromised by the temperature\nand pressure fluctuations inside the Echelle room. Further, a better wavelength\ncalibration approach is needed to carefully track and disentangle the\ninstrumental effects from stellar spectra. While planning a possible upgrade\nwith an Iodine absorption gas cell, we measured the raw stability of the\nspectrograph using a series of calibration frames taken with the ThAr gas\ndischarge lamp. The time series data were analysed with cross-correlation\nmethod and the shift in ThAr emission lines was accurately measured across\ndifferent Echelle orders. In this paper, we present our stability analysis\nmethodology and results for the Kavalur spectrograph. We also identify possible\nsources of error and discuss our strategy to mitigate them.\n", "  Strong magnetic fields, synchrotron emission, and Compton scattering are\nomnipresent in compact celestial X-ray sources. Emissions in the X-ray energy\nband are consequently expected to be linearly polarized. X-ray polarimetry\nprovides a unique diagnostic to study the location and fundamental mechanisms\nbehind emission processes. The polarization of emissions from a bright\ncelestial X-ray source, the Crab, is reported here for the first time in the\nhard X-ray band (~20-160 keV). The Crab is a complex system consisting of a\ncentral pulsar, a diffuse pulsar wind nebula, as well as structures in the\ninner nebula including a jet and torus. Measurements are made by a\npurpose-built and calibrated polarimeter, PoGO+. The polarization vector is\nfound to be aligned with the spin axis of the pulsar for a polarization\nfraction, PF = (20.9 $\\pm$ 5.0)%. This is higher than that of the optical\ndiffuse nebula, implying a more compact emission site, though not as compact\nas, e.g., the synchrotron knot. Contrary to measurements at higher energies, no\nsignificant temporal evolution of phase-integrated polarisation parameters is\nobserved. The polarization parameters for the pulsar itself are measured for\nthe first time in the X-ray energy band and are consistent with observations at\noptical wavelengths.\n", "  Analytic approximations to and numerical results for the semi-classical\nstress-energy tensor outside the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole obtained\nin the 1980's and 1990's are re-examined in order to better understand the\norigin of Hawking radiation and the implications for the black hole information\nparadox. Polynomial fits to the numerical results for the tangential stress in\n4D are obtained for conformally coupled spin 0 and spin 1 fields in the\nHartle-Hawking and Unruh quantum states. What these results show is that the\norigin of the Hawking radiation is not pair creation or tunneling very close to\nthe black hole horizon, but rather is a nonlocal process extending beyond the\npotential barrier in the mode propagation equations centered around $r = 3M$.\nArguments are presented that the black hole information paradox cannot\nplausibly be addressed by processes occurring close to the horizon of a black\nhole whose geometry is close to Schwarzschild. However, a toy model for the\nevolution of the black hole geometry based on the Bousso covariant entropy\nbound suggests a possible resolution.\n", "  The Z-vector method in the relativistic coupled-cluster framework is employed\nto calculate the parallel and perpendicular components of the magnetic\nhyperfine structure constant of a few small alkaline earth hydrides (BeH, MgH,\nand CaH) and fluorides (MgF and CaF). We have compared our Z-vector results\nwith the values calculated by the extended coupled-cluster (ECC) method\nreported in Phys. Rev. A 91 022512 (2015). All these results are compared with\nthe available experimental values. The Z-vector results are found to be in\nbetter agreement with the experimental values than those of the ECC values.\n", "  Many biogeophysical processes continuously evolve in both space and time.\nSome of these processes change gradually enough across both space and time to\nbe oversampled by the satellite image archive. In these cases, image time\nseries of Earth observations can support robust spatiotemporal analysis. In\nthis analysis, we leverage the spectral differences of green vegetation, soil,\nand clouds to perform an EOF analysis which simultaneously characterizes\nmonsoon cloud cover and vegetation phenology in a temperate cloud forest in\nDhofar, southern Oman. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of daily\nMODIS reflectance clearly distinguishes clouds and bare soil from both\ngrassland and cloud forest vegetation. Using the temporal feature space of the\nlow order principal components of the NDVI time series, we identify distinct\nannual cycles of cloud cover and vegetation phenology corresponding to\ngeographically contiguous areas of coupled monsoon-phenological activity\n(phenoregions). The EOF analysis characterizes the temporal dynamics of these\nphenoregions. The wadi cloud forests of the Jabal Al Qara and Jabal Al Qamar\ncan each be described with 2 distinct spatiotemporal patterns of monsoon\nphenology, corresponding to the eastern and western portions of each range. In\naddition, the rangetop grasslands of the Jabal Al Qara show 3 distinct\nspatiotemporal patterns, corresponding to eastern, central, and western\nportions of the range. While each phenoregion has a clearly repeating annual\ncycle, each also demonstrates substantial interannual variability in both cloud\ncover and phenology. This interannual variability is of a sufficient magnitude\nto mask any trends in cloud cover or phenology in any of the regions in the\nDhofar Mountains. Finally, using the degree of asymmetry of the cumulative NDVI\ntime series, we infer a causal link between duration of cloud cover and\namplitude of phenology.\n", "  The scalar-pseudoscalar interaction constant of PbF in its ground state\nelectronic configuration is calculated using the Z-vector method in the\nrelativistic coupled-cluster framework. The precise calculated value is very\nimportant to set upper bound limit on P,T-odd scalar-pseudoscalar interaction\nconstant, k_s, from the experimentally observed P,T-odd frequency shift.\nFurther, the ratio of the effective electric field to the scalar-pseudoscalar\ninteraction constant is also calculated which is required to get an independent\nupper bound limit of electric dipole moment of electron, d_e, and k_s and how\nthese (d_e and k_s) are interrelated is also presented here.\n", "  The mechanism leading to an Auger transition is based on the residual Coulomb\ninteraction between the valence electron and the core electrons. On the\nassumption that the wave field is switched on adiabatically, the probability of\nthe Auger effect of the inner electrons of the atom is determined.\n", "  Nanoconfinement generally leads to drastic effect on the physical and\nchemical properties of ionic liquids. Here we investigate how the\nelectrochemical reactivity in such media may be impacted inside nanoporous\ncarbon electrodes. To this end, we study a simple electron transfer reaction\nusing molecular dynamics simulations. The electrodes are held at constant\nelectric potential by allowing the atomic charges on the carbon atoms to\nfluctuate. We show that the $\\mathrm{Fe^{3+}}/\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ couple\ndissolved in an ionic liquid exhibits a deviation with respect to Marcus\ntheory. This behavior is rationalized by the stabilization of a solvation state\nof the Fe$^{3+}$ cation in the disordered nanoporous electrode that is not\nobserved in the bulk. The simulation results are fitted with a recently\nproposed two solvation state model, which allows us to estimate the effect of\nsuch a deviation on the kinetics of electron transfer inside nanoporous\nelectrodes.\n", "  The complexity of knowledge production on complex systems is well-known, but\nthere still lacks knowledge framework that would both account for a certain\nstructure of knowledge production at an epistemological level and be directly\napplicable to the study and management of complex systems. We set a basis for\nsuch a framework, by first analyzing in detail a case study of the construction\nof a geographical theory of complex territorial systems, through mixed methods,\nnamely qualitative interview analysis and quantitative citation network\nanalysis. We can therethrough inductively build a framework that considers\nknowledge entreprises as perspectives, with co-evolving components within\ncomplementary knowledge domains. We finally discuss potential applications and\ndevelopments.\n", "  Quantum effects on a neutral particle (atom or molecule) with an induced\nelectric dipole moment are investigated when it is subject to the Kratzer\npotential and a scalar potential proportional to the radial distance. In\naddition, this neutral is placed in a region with electric and magnetic fields.\nThis system is analysed in both nonrotating and rotating reference frames.\nThen, it is shown that bound state solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger equation can\nbe achieved and, in the search for polynomial solutions to the radial wave\nfunction, a restriction on the values of the cyclotron frequency is analysed in\nboth references frames.\n", "  More than 23 million people are suffered by Heart failure worldwide. Despite\nthe modern transplant operation is well established, the lack of heart\ndonations becomes a big restriction on transplantation frequency. With respect\nto this matter, ventricular assist devices (VADs) can play an important role in\nsupporting patients during waiting period and after the surgery. Moreover, it\nhas been shown that VADs by means of blood pump have advantages for working\nunder different conditions. While a lot of work has been done on modeling the\nfunctionality of the blood pump, but quantifying uncertainties in a numerical\nmodel is a challenging task. We consider the Polynomial Chaos (PC) method,\nwhich is introduced by Wiener for modeling stochastic process with Gaussian\ndistribution. The Galerkin projection, the intrusive version of the generalized\nPolynomial Chaos (gPC), has been densely studied and applied for various\nproblems. The intrusive Galerkin approach could represent stochastic process\ndirectly at once with Polynomial Chaos series expansions, it would therefore\noptimize the total computing effort comparing with classical non-intrusive\nmethods. We compared different preconditioning techniques for a steady state\nsimulation of a blood pump configuration in our previous work, the comparison\nshows that an inexact multilevel preconditioner has a promising performance. In\nthis work, we show an instationary blood flow through a FDA blood pump\nconfiguration with Galerkin Projection method, which is implemented in our open\nsource Finite Element library Hiflow3. Three uncertainty sources are\nconsidered: inflow boundary condition, rotor angular speed and dynamic\nviscosity, the numerical results are demonstrated with more than 30 Million\ndegrees of freedom by using supercomputer.\n", "  There are several important solid-state systems, such as defects in solids,\nsuperconducting circuits and molecular qubits, for attractive candidates of\nquantum computations. Molecular qubits, which benefit from the power of\nchemistry for the tailored and inexpensive synthesis of new systems, face the\nchallenge from decoherence effect. The decoherence effect is due to the\nmolecular qubits' inevitable interactions to their environment. Strategies to\novercome decoherence effect have been developed, such as designing a nuclear\nspin free environment and working at atomic clock transitions. These chemical\napproaches, however, have some fundamental limitations. For example, chemical\napproach restricts the ligand selection and design to ligands with zero nuclear\nmagnetic dipole moment, such as carbon, oxygen, and sulfur. Herein, a physical\napproach, named Dynamical decoupling (DD), is utilized to combat decoherence,\nwhile the limitations of the chemical approaches can be avoided. The phase\nmemory time $T_2$ for a transition metal complex has been prolonged to exceed\none millisecond ($1.4~$ms) by employing DD. The single qubit figure of merit\n$Q_M $ reaches $ 1.4\\times 10^5$, which is $40$ times better than that\npreviously reported value for such system. Our results show that molecular\nqubits, with milliseconds $T_2$, are promising candidates for quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  Nanoporous carbon-based supercapacitors store electricity through adsorption\nof ions from the electrolyte at the surface of the electrodes. Room temperature\nionic liquids, which show the largest ion concentrations among organic liquid\nelectrolytes, should in principle yield larger capacitances. Here we show by\nusing electrochemical measurements that the capacitance is not significantly\naffected when switching from a pure ionic liquid to a conventional organic\nelectrolyte using the same ionic species. By performing additional molecular\ndynamics simulations, we interpret this result as an increasing difficulty of\nseparating ions of opposite charges when they are more concentrated, i.e. in\nthe absence of a solvent which screens the Coulombic interactions. The charging\nmechanism consistently changes with ion concentration, switching from\ncounter-ion adsorption in the diluted organic electrolyte to ion exchange in\nthe pure ionic liquid. Contrarily to the capacitance, in-pore diffusion\ncoefficients largely depend on the composition, with a noticeable slowing of\nthe dynamics in the pure ionic liquid.\n", "  I propose to use high brightness electron beam with 1 to 100 MeV energy as\ntool to combat tumor or cancerous tissues in deep part of body. The method is\nto directly deliver the electron beam to the tumor site via a small tube that\nconnected to a high brightness electron beam accelerator that is commonly\navailable around the world. Here I gave a basic scheme on the principle, I\nbelieve other issues people raises will be solved easily for those who are\ninterested in solving the problems.\n", "  We consider the quantum complexity of computing Schatten $p$-norms and\nrelated quantities, and find that the problem of estimating these quantities is\nclosely related to the one clean qubit model of computation. We show that the\nproblem of approximating $\\text{Tr}\\, (|A|^p)$ for a log-local $n$-qubit\nHamiltonian $A$ and $p=\\text{poly}(n)$, up to a suitable level of accuracy, is\ncontained in DQC1; and that approximating this quantity up to a somewhat higher\nlevel of accuracy is DQC1-hard. In some cases the level of accuracy achieved by\nthe quantum algorithm is substantially better than a natural classical\nalgorithm for the problem. The same problem can be solved for arbitrary sparse\nmatrices in BQP. One application of the algorithm is the approximate\ncomputation of the energy of a graph.\n", "  High entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent compounds whose high\nconfigurational entropy allows them to solidify into a single phase, with a\nsimple crystal lattice structure. Some HEA's exhibit desirable properties, such\nas high specific strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance, while\nchallenging the scientist to make confident predictions in the face of multiple\ncompeting phases. We demonstrate phase stability in the multicomponent alloy\nsystem of Cr-Mo-Nb-V, for which some of its binary subsystems are subject to\nphase separation and complex intermetallic-phase formation. Our\nfirst-principles calculation of free energy predicts that the configurational\nentropy stabilizes a single body-centered cubic (BCC) phase from T = 1,700K up\nto melting, while precipitation of a complex intermetallic is favored at lower\ntemperatures. We form the compound experimentally and confirm that it forms as\na single BCC phase from the melt, but that it transforms reversibly at lower\ntemperatures.\n", "  The applicability of the linear theory of elasticity to the Moon has been\nstudied. As a criterion was taken the smallness of the strain tensor. The\nelastic moduli are obtained from the data of the project \"Apollo\". The pressure\nwas calculated in the framework of the model of a homogeneous solid sphere\nunder the action of its own gravity. The strain tensor trace is of the order\n$0.02$, which indicates the applicability.\n  The strain tensor in the body of the Moon is calculated taking into account\nthe self-gravity and the Earth's tidal potential. Respectively the free energy\ndensity is calculated. Since the axis of the Moon rotation has its own non-zero\ndeclination to the ecliptic plane, the tidal potential variations take place\nduring the rotation of the Moon around the Earth.\n  The estimation of the corresponding free energy density variations are made.\nTheir dependence on the depth exhibit qualitative agreement with the data of\ndepth dependence in the energy of deep moonquakes obtained in the project\n\"Apollo.\"\n  Integral estimations of variations in the free energy for the year shows that\nit is many orders of magnitude greater than estimates of energy for the year of\ndeep moonquakes energy. Thus offering an answer to the fundamental question:\nwhere is the source of energy released in the deep moonquakes.\n", "  This doctoral work focuses on three main problems related to social networks:\n(1) Orchestrating Network Formation: We consider the problem of orchestrating\nformation of a social network having a certain given topology that may be\ndesirable for the intended usecases. Assuming the social network nodes to be\nstrategic in forming relationships, we derive conditions under which a given\ntopology can be uniquely obtained. We also study the efficiency and robustness\nof the derived conditions. (2) Multi-phase Influence Maximization: We propose\nthat information diffusion be carried out in multiple phases rather than in a\nsingle instalment. With the objective of achieving better diffusion, we\ndiscover optimal ways of splitting the available budget among the phases,\ndetermining the time delay between consecutive phases, and also finding the\nindividuals to be targeted for initiating the diffusion process. (3) Scalable\nPreference Aggregation: It is extremely useful to determine a small number of\nrepresentatives of a social network such that the individual preferences of\nthese nodes, when aggregated, reflect the aggregate preference of the entire\nnetwork. Using real-world data collected from Facebook with human subjects, we\ndiscover a model that faithfully captures the spread of preferences in a social\nnetwork. We hence propose fast and reliable ways of computing a truly\nrepresentative aggregate preference of the entire network. In particular, we\ndevelop models and methods for solving the above problems, which primarily deal\nwith formation and analysis of social networks.\n", "  The translocation of a short DNA fragment through a nanopore is addressed\nwhen the perforated membrane contains an embedded electrode. Accurate numerical\nsolutions of the coupled Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Stokes equations for a\nrealistic, fully three-dimensional setup as well as analytical approximations\nfor a simplified model are worked out. By applying a suitable voltage to the\nmembrane electrode, the DNA can be forced to preferably traverse the pore\neither along the pore axis or at a small but finite distance from the pore\nwall.\n", "  The surface a thin-film is attached to and the surrounding monolayer causes\ngeometrical confinement of a interrogated molecule; we look at the base case of\na SC$_{18}H_{37}$ in a SC$_{18}H_{37}$ monolayer on Au[111]. Normal mode\nanalysis was used to get vibrations, and these are analysed using mode\ncharacter indicators which can quantify: how active an element is in a mode;\nthe overall direction of the mode; and which chemical coordinates are relevant.\nWe examined the 4 possible packing structures. We find that the more\nthermodynamically stable structures were less perturbed by the surface and more\nsupported by the surrounding monolayer. The surface-perturbed modes were below\n100cm$^{-1}$, had a higher global, carbon, sulfur, longitudinal and torsional\ncharacters, indicating unit cell backbone motions, often with increased S\nmotion parallel to the surface, and an increased terminal methyl group motion.\nModes identified by this technique showed a difference between experimental\nvibrations (with and without the surface) that was twice as large as those not\nidentified. The surrounding monolayer had a larger effect on a single molecule\ndynamics than the surface, including stabilising the molecules enough for 12\nhigh energy modes to move $\\approx$425cm$^{-1}$ down in energy to below $k_B\nT$, allowing them to be populated at room temperature. These modes had higher\nlocal and higher H characters, and were highly modulated by the SAM structure.\nThis work shows novels ways to analyse vibrations, and demonstrates the crucial\nneed to include geometric confinement effects in SAM studies.\n", "  We consider the minimal discrete and continuous energy problems on the unit\nsphere $\\mathbb{S}^d$ in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ in the presence\nof an external field due to finitely many localized charge distributions on\n$\\mathbb{S}^d$, where the energy arises from the Riesz potential $1/r^s$ ($r$\nis the Euclidean distance) for the critical Riesz parameter $s = d - 2$ if $d\n\\geq 3$ and the logarithmic potential $\\log(1/r)$ if $d = 2$. Individually, a\nlocalized charge distribution is either a point charge or assumed to be\nrotationally symmetric. The extremal measure solving the continuous external\nfield problem for weak fields is shown to be the uniform measure on the sphere\nbut restricted to the exterior of spherical caps surrounding the localized\ncharge distributions. The radii are determined by the relative strengths of the\ngenerating charges. Furthermore, we show that the minimal energy points solving\nthe related discrete external field problem are confined to this support. For\n$d-2\\leq s<d$, we show that for point sources on the sphere, the equilibrium\nmeasure has support in the complement of the union of specified spherical caps\nabout the sources. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.\n", "  We present the methodology for and detail the implementation of the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) 3x2pt DES Year 1 (Y1) analysis, which combines\nconfiguration-space two-point statistics from three different cosmological\nprobes: cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, using data\nfrom the first year of DES observations. We have developed two independent\nmodeling pipelines and describe the code validation process. We derive\nexpressions for analytical real-space multi-probe covariances, and describe\ntheir validation with numerical simulations. We stress-test the inference\npipelines in simulated likelihood analyses that vary 6-7 cosmology parameters\nplus 20 nuisance parameters and precisely resemble the analysis to be presented\nin the DES 3x2pt analysis paper, using a variety of simulated input data\nvectors with varying assumptions.\n  We find that any disagreement between pipelines leads to changes in assigned\nlikelihood $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\le 0.045$ with respect to the statistical error of\nthe DES Y1 data vector. We also find that angular binning and survey mask do\nnot impact our analytic covariance at a significant level. We determine lower\nbounds on scales used for analysis of galaxy clustering (8 Mpc$~h^{-1}$) and\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing (12 Mpc$~h^{-1}$) such that the impact of modeling\nuncertainties in the non-linear regime is well below statistical errors, and\nshow that our analysis choices are robust against a variety of systematics.\nThese tests demonstrate that we have a robust analysis pipeline that yields\nunbiased cosmological parameter inferences for the flagship 3x2pt DES Y1\nanalysis. We emphasize that the level of independent code development and\nsubsequent code comparison as demonstrated in this paper is necessary to\nproduce credible constraints from increasingly complex multi-probe analyses of\ncurrent data.\n", "  The Robertson's formulation of the uncertainty relation is the most widely\naccepted form of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (HUR). It gets modified\nwhen we consider it for entangled particles. But this formulation does not\nconsider the measurement process itself. There are reformulation of the\nuncertainty relations called the generalized uncertainty relations by including\nthe measurement process into the uncertainty relation. HUR gets modified for\nthe case of entangled particles. Here it is shown that the limit of the\nGeneralized Uncertainty Relation (GUR) also reduces for entangled particles.\nSo, GUR also shows similar trend as that of the HUR for entangled particles.\nAlso as entanglement increases, the uncertainty reduces and measurement becomes\nmore precise.\n"]}
