The two-level systems are coupled\nto a common environment, where the excitation can be lost, which induces super\nand subradiant behavior, an example of cooperative quantum coherent effect. We\nconsider time-independent random fluctuations of the excitation energies. This\nstatic disorder, also called inhomogeneous broadening in literature, induces\nAnderson localization and is able to quench Superradiance. We identify two\ndifferent regimes: $i)$ weak opening, in which Superradiance is quenched at the\nsame critical disorder at which the states of the closed system localize; $ii)$\nstrong opening, with a critical disorder strength proportional to both the\nsystem size and the degree of opening, displaying robustness of cooperativity\nto disorder. Relevance to photosynthetic complexes is discussed.\n", "  This work reviews the present position of and surveys future perspectives in\nthe physics of chaotic advection: the field that emerged three decades ago at\nthe intersection of fluid mechanics and nonlinear dynamics, which encompasses a\nrange of applications with length scales ranging from micrometers to hundreds\nof kilometers, including systems as diverse as mixing and thermal processing of\nviscous fluids, microfluidics, biological flows, and oceanographic and\natmospheric flows.\n", "  With the advent of large scale galaxy surveys, constraints on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity (PNG) are expected to reach ${\\cal O}(f_\\text{NL}) \\sim 1$. In\norder to fully exploit the potential of these future surveys, a deep\ntheoretical understanding of the signatures imprinted by PNG on the large scale\nstructure of the Universe is necessary. In this paper, we explore the effect of\na stochastic moving barrier on the amplitude of the non-Gaussian bias induced\nby local quadratic PNG. We show that, in the peak approach to halo clustering,\nthe amplitude of the non-Gaussian bias will generally differ from the\npeak-background split prediction unless the barrier is flat and deterministic.\nFor excursion set peaks with a square-root barrier, which reproduce reasonably\nwell the linear bias $b_1$ and mass function $\\bar{n}_\\text{h}$ of SO haloes,\nthe non-Gaussian bias amplitude is $\\sim 40$% larger than the peak-background\nsplit expectation $d\\ln\\bar{n}_\\text{h}/d\\ln\\sigma_8$ for haloes of mass $\\sim\n10^{13} {\\it h}^{-1}M_\\odot$ at $z=0$. Furthermore, we argue that the effect of\nPNG on squeezed configurations of the halo bispectrum differs significantly\nfrom that predicted by standard local bias approaches. Our predictions can be\neasily confirmed, or invalidated, with N-body simulations.\n", "  We study the stability of cosmic string wakes against the disruption by the\ndominant Gaussian fluctuations which are present in cosmological models. We\nfind that for a string tension given by $G \\mu = 10^{-7}$ wakes remain locally\nstable until a redshift of $z = 6$, and for a value of $G \\mu = 10^{-14}$ they\nare stable beyond a redshift of $z = 20$. We study a global stability criterion\nwhich shows that wakes created by strings at times after $t_{eq}$ are\nidentifiable up to the present time, independent of the value of $G \\mu$.\nTaking into account our criteria it is possible to develop strategies to search\nfor the distinctive position space signals in cosmological maps which are\ninduced by wakes.\n", "  In this paper, we model the observable signatures of tidal disruptions of\nwhite dwarf (WD) stars by massive black holes (MBHs) of moderate mass, $\\approx\n10^3 - 10^5 M_\\odot$. When the WD passes deep enough within the MBH's tidal\nfield, these signatures include thermonuclear transients from burning during\nmaximum compression. We combine a hydrodynamic simulation that includes nuclear\nburning of the disruption of a $0.6 M_\\odot$ C/O WD with a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer calculation to synthesize the properties of a representative\ntransient. The transient's emission emerges in the optical, with lightcurves\nand spectra reminiscent of type I SNe. The properties are strongly\nviewing-angle dependent, and key spectral signatures are $\\approx 10,000$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the unbound ejecta.\nDisruptions of He WDs likely produce large quantities of intermediate-mass\nelements, offering a possible production mechanism for Ca-rich transients.\nAccompanying multiwavelength transients are fueled by accretion and arise from\nthe nascent accretion disk and relativistic jet. If MBHs of moderate mass exist\nwith number densities similar to those of supermassive MBHs, both high energy\nwide-field monitors and upcoming optical surveys should detect tens to hundreds\nof WD tidal disruptions per year. The current best strategy for their detection\nmay therefore be deep optical follow up of high-energy transients of\nunusually-long duration. The detection rate or the non-detection of these\ntransients by current and upcoming surveys can thus be used to place meaningful\nconstraints on the extrapolation of the MBH mass function to moderate masses.\n", "  We have developed an incandescent Mo source to fabricate large-area\nsingle-crystalline MoSe2 thin films. The as-grown MoSe2 thin films were\ncharacterized using transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray\nspectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence,\nreflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and angular resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). A new Raman characteristic peak at 1591\ncm-1 was identified. Results from Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, RHEED\nand ARPES studies consistently reveal that large-area single crystalline\nmono-layer of MoSe2 could be achieved by this technique. This technique enjoys\nseveral advantages over conventional approaches and could be extended to the\ngrowth of other two-dimensional layered materials containing a\nlow-vapor-pressure element.\n", "  Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols allow for the establishment of\na secret key between two users Alice and Bob, when one of the two users\n(typically Bob) is limited or \"classical\" in nature. Recently it was shown that\nprotocols exists when both parties are limited/classical in nature if they\nutilize the services of a quantum server. These protocols are called mediated\nSQKD protocols. This server, however, is untrusted and, in fact, adversarial.\nIn this paper, we reconsider a mediated SQKD protocol and derive a new proof of\nunconditional security for it. In particular, we derive a new lower bound on\nits key rate in the asymptotic scenario. Furthermore, we show this new lower\nbound is an improvement over prior work, thus showing that the protocol in\nquestion can tolerate higher rates of error than previously thought.\n", "  It's pointed out that the treatment of the resonant electromagnetic\nperturbation with the Lie transform method adopted in the gyrokinetic theory\ngenerates some nonphysical terms in the trajectory equations. By utilizing a\nmodified application of this transform method, the resonant terms in the\ntrajectory equations satisfying each resonant condition are found out up to the\nsecond harmonic resonance. Through separating the fast-dynamic terms from the\nslow-dynamic ones, the slow-dynamic trajectory equations including the resonant\nterms are derived for various resonant conditions. The slow-dynamic evolution\nequation of gyroangle reveals that the real gyrating frequency of the charged\nparticle around the magnetic field line under driving by the resonant wave has\na shift from the cyclotron frequency without the wave driving. To study the\neffect caused by the frequency shift, a simple example for the\nfundamental-frequency cyclotron resonance is presented.\n", "  We study a vortex chain in a thin film of a topological insulator with\nproximity-induced superconductivity---a promising platform to realize Majorana\nzero modes (MZMs)---by modeling it as a two-leg Majorana ladder. While each\npair of MZMs hybridizes through vortex tunneling, we hereby show that MZMs can\nbe stabilized on the ends of the ladder with the presence of tilted external\nmagnetic field and four-Majorana interaction. Furthermore, a fruitful phase\ndiagram is obtained by controlling the direction of magnetic field and the\nthickness of the sample. We reveal many-body Majorana states and\ninteraction-induced topological phase transitions and also identify\ntrivial-superconducting and commensurate/incommensurate charge-density-wave\nstates in the phase diagram.\n", "  We present $NuSTAR$ X-ray observations of the active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nin NGC 7674. The source shows a flat X-ray spectrum, suggesting that it is\nobscured by Compton-thick gas columns. Based upon long-term flux dimming,\nprevious work suggested the alternate possibility that the source is a recently\nswitched-off AGN with the observed X-rays being the lagged echo from the torus.\nOur high-quality data show the source to be reflection-dominated in hard\nX-rays, but with a relatively weak neutral Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line\n(equivalent width [EW] of $\\approx$ 0.4 keV) and a strong Fe XXVI ionised line\n(EW $\\approx$ 0.2 keV). We construct an updated long-term X-ray light curve of\nNGC 7674 and find that the observed 2-10 keV flux has remained constant for the\npast $\\approx$ 20 years, following a high flux state probed by $Ginga$. Light\ntravel time arguments constrain the minimum radius of the reflector to be\n$\\sim$ 3.2 pc under the switched-off AGN scenario, $\\approx$ 30 times larger\nthan the expected dust sublimation radius, rendering this possibility unlikely.\nA patchy Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN) solution is plausible, requiring a minimum\nline-of-sight column density ($N_{\\rm H}$) of 3 $\\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ at\npresent, and yields an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of (3-5) $\\times$\n10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Realistic uncertainties span the range of $\\approx$\n(1-13) $\\times$ 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The source has one of the weakest\nfluorescence lines amongst {\\em bona fide} CTAGN, and is potentially a local\nanalogue of bolometrically luminous systems showing complex neutral and ionised\nFe emission. It exemplifies the difficulty of identification and proper\ncharacterisation of distant CTAGN based on the strength of the neutral Fe\nK$\\alpha$ line.\n", "  The Kirchhoff-Plateau problem concerns the equilibrium shapes of a system in\nwhich a flexible filament in the form of a closed loop is spanned by a liquid\nfilm, with the filament being modeled as a Kirchhoff rod and the action of the\nspanning surface being solely due to surface tension. We establish the\nexistence of an equilibrium shape that minimizes the total energy of the system\nunder the physical constraint of non-interpenetration of matter, but allowing\nfor points on the surface of the bounding loop to come into contact. In our\ntreatment, the bounding loop retains a finite cross-sectional thickness and a\nnonvanishing volume, while the liquid film is represented by a set with finite\ntwo-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Moreover, the region where the liquid film\ntouches the surface of the bounding loop is not prescribed a priori. Our\nmathematical results substantiate the physical relevance of the chosen model.\nIndeed, no matter how strong is the competition between surface tension and the\nelastic response of the filament, the system is always able to adjust to\nachieve a configuration that complies with the physical constraints encountered\nin experiments.\n", "  We apply symmetric tensor network state (TNS) to study the nearest neighbor\nspin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on Kagome lattice. Our method keeps\ntrack of the global and gauge symmetries in TNS update procedure and in tensor\nrenormalization group (TRG) calculation. We also introduce a very sensitive\nprobe for the gap of the ground state -- the modular matrices, which can also\ndetermine the topological order if the ground state is gapped. We find that the\nground state of Heisenberg model on Kagome lattice is a gapped spin liquid with\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order (or toric code type), which has a long\ncorrelation length $\\xi\\sim 10$ unit cell length. We justify that the TRG\nmethod can handle very large systems with over thousands of spins. Such a long\n$\\xi$ explains the gapless behaviors observed in simulations on smaller systems\nwith less than 300 spins or shorter than 10 unit cell length. We also discuss\nexperimental implications of the topological excitations encoded in our\nsymmetric tensors.\n", "  An important open problem in Human Behaviour is to understand how\ncoordination emerges in human ensembles. This problem has been seldom studied\nquantitatively in the existing literature, in contrast to situations involving\ndual interaction. Here we study motor coordination (or synchronisation) in a\ngroup of individuals where participants are asked to visually coordinate an\noscillatory hand motion. We separately tested two groups of seven participants.\nWe observed that the coordination level of the ensemble depends on group\nhomogeneity, as well as on the pattern of visual couplings (who looked at\nwhom). Despite the complexity of social interactions, we show that networks of\ncoupled heterogeneous oscillators with different structures capture well the\ngroup dynamics. Our findings are relevant to any activity requiring the\ncoordination of several people, as in music, sport or at work, and can be\nextended to account for other perceptual forms of interaction such as sound or\nfeel.\n", "  We introduce and study a new class of Banded Random Matrix model describing\nsparse, long range quantum hopping in one dimension. Using a series of analytic\narguments, numerical simulations, and mappings to statistical physics models,\nwe establish the phase diagram of the model. A genuine localisation transition,\nwith well defined mobility edges, appears as the hopping rate decreases slower\nthan $\\ell^{-2}$, where $\\ell$ is the distance. Correspondingly, the decay of\nthe localised states evolves from a standard exponential shape to a stretched\nexponential and finally to a novel $\\exp(-C\\ln^\\kappa \\ell)$ behaviour, with\n$\\kappa > 1$.\n", "  We present a holographic method for computing the response of R\\'enyi\nentropies in conformal field theories to small shape deformations around a flat\n(or spherical) entangling surface. Our strategy employs the stress tensor\none-point function in a deformed hyperboloid background and relates it to the\ncoefficient in the two-point function of the displacement operator. We obtain\nexplicit numerical results for $d=3,\\dots,6$ spacetime dimensions, and also\nevaluate analytically the limits where the R\\'enyi index approaches 1 and 0 in\ngeneral dimensions. We use our results to extend the work of 1602.08493 and\ndisprove a set of conjectures in the literature regarding the relations between\nthe R\\'enyi shape dependence and the conformal weight of the twist operator. We\nalso extend our analysis beyond leading order in derivatives in the bulk theory\nby studying Gauss-Bonnet gravity.\n", "  We investigate the dust structure of gravitationally unstable disks\nundergoing mass accretion from the envelope envisioning the application to\nClass 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) We find that the dust disk quickly\nsettles into a steady state and that, compared to a disk with interstellar\nmedium (ISM) dust-to-gas mass ratio and micron-sized dust, the dust mass in the\nsteady-state decreases by a factor of 1/2 to 1/3, and the dust thermal emission\ndecreases by a factor of 1/3 to 1/5. The latter decrease is caused by dust\ndepletion and opacity decrease owing to dust growth. Our results suggest that\nthe masses of gravitationally unstable disks in the Class 0/I YSOs are\nunderestimated by a factor of 1/3 to 1/5 when calculated from the dust thermal\nemission assuming an ISM dust-to-gas mass ratio and micron-sized dust opacity,\nand that a larger fraction of disks in Class 0/I YSOs is gravitationally\nunstable than was previously believed. We also investigate the orbital radius\n$r_{\\rm P}$ within which planetesimals form via coagulation of porous dust\naggregates and show that $r_{\\rm P}$ becomes $\\sim 20$ AU for a gravitationally\nunstable disk around a solar mass star. Because $r_{\\rm P}$ increases as the\ngas surface density increases and a gravitationally unstable disk has a maximum\ngas surface density, $r_{\\rm P}\\sim 20$ AU is the theoretical maximum radius.\nWe suggest that planetesimals formation in the Class 0/I phase is preferable to\nthat in the Class II phase because large gas surface density is expected and\nlarge amount of dust is supplied by envelope-to-disk accretion.\n", "  In this paper, we derive key-rate expressions for different quantum key\ndistribution protocols. Our key-rate equations utilize multiple channel\nstatistics, including those gathered from mismatched measurement bases - i.e.,\nwhen Alice and Bob choose incompatible bases. In particular, we will consider\nan Extended B92 and a two-way semi-quantum protocol. For both these protocols,\nwe demonstrate that their tolerance to noise is higher than previously thought\n- in fact, we will show the semi-quantum protocol can actually tolerate the\nsame noise level as the fully quantum BB84 protocol. Along the way, we will\nalso consider an optimal QKD protocol for various quantum channels. Finally,\nall the key-rate expressions which we derive in this paper are applicable to\nany arbitrary, not necessarily symmetric, quantum channel.\n", "  Deep relations of dark energy scenario and string theory results into dilaton\ngravity, on one hand, and the connection between quantum gravity with gravity's\nrainbow, on the other hand, motivate us to consider three dimensional dilatonic\nblack hole solutions in gravity's rainbow. We obtain two classes of the\nsolutions which are polynomial and logarithmic forms. We also calculate\nconserved and thermodynamic quantities, and examine the first law of\nthermodynamics for both classes. In addition, we study thermal stability and\nshow that one of the classes is thermally stable while the other one is\nunstable.\n", "  Most large molecules are chiral in their structure: they exist as two\nenantiomers, which are mirror images of each other. Whereas the rovibronic\nsublevels of two enantiomers are almost identical, it turns out that the\nphotoelectric effect is sensitive to the absolute configuration of the ionized\nenantiomer - an effect termed Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD). Our\ncomprehensive study demonstrates that the origin of PECD can be found in the\nmolecular frame electron emission pattern connecting PECD to other fundamental\nphotophysical effects as the circular dichroism in angular distributions\n(CDAD). Accordingly, orienting a chiral molecule in space enhances the PECD by\na factor of about 10.\n", "  Game theory is a well established branch of mathematics whose formalism has a\nvast range of applications from the social sciences, biology, to economics.\nMotivated by quantum information science, there has been a leap in the\nformulation of novel game strategies that lead to new (quantum Nash)\nequilibrium points whereby players in some classical games are always\noutperformed if sharing and processing joint information ruled by the laws of\nquantum physics is allowed. We show that, for a bipartite non zero-sum game,\ninput local quantum correlations, and separable states in particular, suffice\nto achieve an advantage over any strategy that uses classical resources, thus\ndispensing with quantum nonlocality, entanglement, or even discord between the\nplayers' input states. This highlights the remarkable key role played by pure\nquantum coherence at powering some protocols. Finally, we propose an experiment\nthat uses separable states and basic photon interferometry to demonstrate the\nlocally-correlated quantum advantage.\n", "  A central topic in the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is the\ndefinition of thermodynamic work in the quantum regime. One widely used\nsolution is to define work for a closed system undergoing non-equilibrium\ndynamics according to the two-point energy measurement scheme. However, due to\nthe invasive nature of measurement the two-point quantum work probability\ndistribution leads to inconsistencies with two pillars of thermodynamics: it\nbreaks the first law and the time-reversal symmetry expected for closed\ndynamics. We here introduce the quantum histories framework as a method to\ncharacterise the thermodynamic properties of the unmeasured, closed dynamics.\nExtending the classical phase space trajectories to continuous power operator\ntrajectories allows us to derive an alternative quantum work distribution for\nclosed quantum dynamics that fulfils the first law and is time-reversal\nsymmetric. We find that the work distribution of the unmeasured dynamics leads\nto deviations from the classical Jarzynski equality and can have negative\nvalues highlighting distinctly non-classical features of quantum work.\n", "  Analysis of the saturation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is\nundertaken to determine the extent to which the conjugate linearly stable mode\nplays a role. For a piecewise-continuous mean flow profile with constant shear\nin a fixed layer, it is shown that the stable mode is nonlinearly excited,\nproviding an injection-scale sink of the fluctuation energy similar to what has\nbeen found for gyroradius-scale drift-wave turbulence. Quantitative evaluation\nof the contribution of the stable mode to the energy balance at the onset of\nsaturation shows that nonlinear energy transfer to the stable mode is as\nsignificant as energy transfer to small scales in balancing energy injected\ninto the spectrum by the instability. The effect of the stable mode on momentum\ntransport is quantified by expressing the Reynolds stress in terms of stable\nand unstable mode amplitudes at saturation, from which it is found that the\nstable mode can produce a sizable reduction in the momentum flux.\n", "  We consider logarithmic contributions to the free energy, instanton effective\naction and Laplace sum rules in QCD that are a consequence of radiative\ncorrections. Upon summing these contributions by using the renormalization\ngroup, all dependence on the renormalization scale parameter $\\mu$ cancels. The\nrenormalization scheme dependence in these processes is examined, and a\nrenormalization scheme is found in which the effect of higher order radiative\ncorrections is absorbed by the behaviour of the running coupling.\n", "  An exact mapping is established between the $c\\geq25$ Liouville field theory\n(LFT) and the Gibbs measure statistics of a thermal particle in a 2D Gaussian\nFree Field plus a logarithmic confining potential. The probability distribution\nof the position of the minimum of the energy landscape is obtained exactly by\ncombining the conformal bootstrap and one-step replica symmetry breaking\nmethods. Operator product expansions in LFT allow to unveil novel universal\nbehaviours of the log-correlated Random Energy class. High precision numerical\ntests are given.\n", "  The Mathematization project investigates students' use of mathematical tools\nacross the undergraduate physics curriculum. As a part of this project, we look\nat intermediate mechanics students' written homework solutions to understand\nhow they use these tools in approaching traditional mechanics problems. We use\na modified version of the ACER (Activation-Construction-Execution-Reflection)\nframework to analyze students' solutions and to identify patterns of\nmathematical skills used on traditional problems. We apply techniques borrowed\nfrom network analysis and the Resources Framework to build a \"fingerprint\" of\nstudents' mathematical tool use. In this paper, we present preliminary findings\non patterns that we identified in students' problem solving.\n", "  We report a precise measurement of hyperfine constants in the $\\rm{D_1} $\nline ($ \\rm {5\\,P_{1/2}} $ state) of the two stable isotopes of Rb. The\nmotivation for the work is to try and resolve discrepant values that exists in\nthe literature. We use a technique that is different from other methods---one\nwhere the laser is not locked to a particular transition but scanned around it.\nThis is advantageous because it overcomes frequency shifts due to servo-loop\nerrors and other sources of noise in the experiment. The values in the two\nisotopes are: $ A = 120.510(26) $ MHz in $\\rm {^{85}Rb}$, and $ A = 408.340(19)\n$ MHz in $\\rm {^{87}Rb}$. These values are at variance with earlier values\nreported from our lab, but consistent with other published measurements.\n", "  We study maximally supersymmetric Anti-de Sitter backgrounds in consistent\nN=2 truncations of type IIB supergravity compactified on the Sasaki-Einstein\nmanifold $T^{1,1}$. In particular, we focus on truncations that contain fields\ncoming from the nontrivial second and third cohomology forms on $T^{1,1}$.\nThese give rise to N=2 supergravity coupled to two vector- and two\nhypermultiplets (Betti-vector truncation) or one vector- and three\nhypermultiplets (Betti-hyper truncation), respectively. We find that both\ntruncations admit AdS$_5$ backgrounds with the gauge group always being broken\nbut containing at least an $U(1)_R$ factor. Moreover, in both cases we show\nthat the moduli space of AdS vacua is nontrivial and of maximal dimension.\nFinally, we explicitly compute the metrics on these moduli spaces.\n", "  Current measurements of the $\\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles (FB) are based on\nmodel-dependent tracers, carry substantial systematic uncertainties, and are at\nsome tension with each other. We show that gradient filters pick out the FB\nedges, which are found to smoothly connect to the bipolar X-ray structure\nemanating from the Galactic center, thus supporting the interpretation of the\nFBs as a Galactic-scale phenomenon. The sharp edges facilitate a direct,\nmodel-free measurement of the peripheral FB spectrum. The result is strikingly\nsimilar to the full FB-integrated spectrum, softened by a power law of index\n$\\eta\\simeq (0.2\\mbox{--}0.3)$. This is naturally explained, in both hadronic\nand leptonic models, if cosmic rays are injected at the edge, and diffuse away\npreferentially at higher energies $E$. The inferred, averaged diffusion\nfunction in the (more plausible) leptonic model, $D(E)\\simeq\n10^{29.5}(E/10\\mbox{ GeV})^{0.48\\pm0.02}\\mbox{ cm}^2\\mbox{ s}^{-1}$, is\nconsistent with estimates for Kraichnan-like turbulence. Our results, in\nparticular the minute spatial variations in $\\eta$, indicate that the FB edge\nis a strong, Mach $\\gtrsim5$, forward shock.\n", "  The number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling behavior of elliptic flow has\nbeen systematically studied at the LHC energy within the framework of a\nmultiphase transport model (AMPT) in this work. We find that the parameters\nused to generate the initial states and the collision centrality are important\nfor the existence of NCQ scaling even when hadronic rescattering contribution\nis off in Pb-Pb collisions of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. By turning on the\nhadron rescattering process, the hadronic evolution impacts are also found to\nbe significant. Extending the analysis to Pb-Pb collsions of\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, one would observe similar qualitative features.\n", "  We use the final catalogue of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey\n(VIPERS) to measure the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution at high\nredshift, presenting results that extend beyond $z=1$ for the first time. We\napply an FFT technique to four independent sub-volumes comprising a total of\n$51,728$ galaxies at $0.6<z<1.1$ (out of the nearly $90,000$ included in the\nwhole survey). We concentrate here on the shape of the direction-averaged power\nspectrum in redshift space, explaining the level of modelling of redshift-space\nanisotropies and the anisotropic survey window function that are needed to\ndeduce this in a robust fashion. We then use covariance matrices derived from a\nlarge ensemble of mock datasets in order to fit the spectral data. The results\nare well matched by a standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, with density parameter\n$\\Omega_M h =\\smash{0.227^{+0.063}_{-0.050}}$ and baryon fraction\n$\\smash{f_B=\\Omega_B/\\Omega_M=0.220^{+0.058}_{-0.072}}$. These inferences from\nthe high-$z$ galaxy distribution are consistent with results from local galaxy\nsurveys, and also with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Thus the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel gives a good match to cosmic structure at all redshifts so far accessible\nto observational study.\n", "  Particle-hole symmetry in the lowest Landau level of the two-dimensional\nelectron gas requires the electrical Hall conductivity to equal $\\pm e^2/2h$ at\nhalf-filling. We study the consequences of weakly broken particle-hole symmetry\nfor magnetoresistance oscillations about half-filling in the presence of an\napplied periodic one-dimensional electrostatic potential using the Dirac\ncomposite fermion theory proposed by Son. At fixed electron density, the\noscillation minima are asymmetrically biased towards higher magnetic fields,\nwhile at fixed magnetic field, the oscillations occur symmetrically as the\nelectron density is varied about half-filling. We find an approximate \"sum\nrule\" obeyed for all pairs of oscillation minima that can be tested in\nexperiment. The locations of the magnetoresistance oscillation minima for the\ncomposite fermion theory of Halperin, Lee, and Read (HLR) and its particle-hole\nconjugate agree exactly. Within the current experimental resolution, the\nlocations of the oscillation minima produced by the Dirac composite fermion\ncoincide with those of HLR. These results may indicate that all three composite\nfermion theories describe the same long wavelength physics.\n", "  We propose a generic construction of exactly soluble \\emph{local bosonic\nmodels} that realize various topological orders with gappable boundaries. In\nparticular, we construct an exactly soluble bosonic model that realizes a 3+1D\n$Z_2$ gauge theory with emergent fermionic Kramer doublet. We show that the\nemergence of such a fermion will cause the nucleation of certain topological\nexcitations in space-time without pin$^+$ structure. The exactly soluble model\nalso leads to a statistical transmutation in 3+1D. In addition, we construct\nexactly soluble bosonic models that realize 2 types of time-reversal symmetry\nenriched $Z_2$-topological orders in 2+1D, and 20 types of simplest\ntime-reversal symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders which have only one\nnon-trivial point-like and string-like topological excitations. Many physical\nproperties of those topological states are calculated using the exactly soluble\nmodels. We find that some time-reversal SET orders have point-like excitations\nthat carry Kramer doublet -- a fractionalized time-reversal symmetry. We also\nfind that some $Z_2$ SET orders have string-like excitations that carry\nanomalous (non-on-site) $Z_2$ symmetry, which can be viewed as a\nfractionalization of $Z_2$ symmetry on strings. Our construction is based on\ncochains and cocycles in algebraic topology, which is very versatile. In\nprinciple, it can also realize emergent topological field theory beyond the\ntwisted gauge theory.\n", "  We propose an optimized design for nanowire superconducting single photon\ndetectors, using the recently discovered position dependent detection\nefficiency in these devices. This knowledge allows an optimized the design of\nmeandering wire NbN detectors by altering the field distribution across the\nwire. In order to calculate the response of the detectors with different\ngeometries, we use a monotonic local detection efficiency from a nanowire and\noptical absorption distribution via finite-different-time-domain simulations.\nThe calculations predict a trade-off between average absorption and the edge\neffect leading to a predicted optimal wire width close to 100 nm for 1550 nm\nwavelength, which drops to 50 nm wire width for 600 nm wavelength. The\nabsorption at the edges can be enhanced by depositing a silicon nanowire on top\nof the superconducting nanowire, which improves both the total absorption\nefficiency as well as the internal detection efficiency of meandering wire\nstructures.\n", "  Semi-quantum key distribution protocols are allowed to set up a secure secret\nkey between two users. Compared with their full quantum counterparts, one of\nthe two users is restricted to perform some \"classical\" or \"semi-quantum\"\noperations, which makes them easily realizable by using less quantum resource.\nHowever, the semi-quantum key distribution protocols mainly rely on a two-way\nquantum channel. The eavesdropper has two opportunities to intercept the\nquantum states transmitted in the quantum communication stage. It may allow the\neavesdropper to get more information and make the security analysis more\ncomplicated. In the past ten years, many semi-quantum key distribution\nprotocols have been proposed and proved to be robust. But there are few works\nconcerned about their unconditional security. It is doubted that how secure the\nsemi-quantum ones are and how much noise can they tolerate to establish a\nsecure secret key. In this paper, we prove the unconditional security of a\nsingle-state semi-quantum key distribution protocol proposed by $Zou$ et al. in\n[Phys. Rev. A. 79]. We present a complete proof from information theory aspect\nby deriving a lower bound of the protocol's key rate in the asymptotic\nscenario. Using this bound, we figure out an error threshold value such that\nall error rates are less than this threshold value, the secure secret key can\nbe established between the legitimate users definitely. Otherwise, the users\nshould abort the protocol. we make an illustration of the protocol under the\ncircumstance of the reverse quantum channel is a depolarizing one with\nparameter $q$. Additionally, we compare the error threshold value with some\nfull quantum protocols and several existing semi-quantum ones whose\nunconditional security proofs have been provided recently.\n", "  We present a proof-of-concept study, based on numerical-relativity\nsimulations, of how gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star merger remnants\ncan probe the nature of matter at extreme densities. Phase transitions and\nextra degrees of freedom can emerge at densities beyond those reached during\nthe inspiral, and typically result in a softening of the equation of state\n(EOS). We show that such physical effects change the qualitative dynamics of\nthe remnant evolution, but they are not identifiable as a signature in the GW\nfrequency, with the exception of possible black-hole formation effects. The EOS\nsoftening is, instead, encoded in the GW luminosity and phase and is in\nprinciple detectable up to distances of the order of several Mpcs with advanced\ndetectors and up to hundreds of Mpcs with third generation detectors. Probing\nextreme-density matter will require going beyond the current paradigm and\ndeveloping a more holistic strategy for modeling and analyzing postmerger GW\nsignals.\n", "  We study analytically and numerical the growth rate of a crystal surface\ngrowing by several screw dislocations. To describe several spiral steps we use\nthe revised level set method for spirals by the authors (Journal of Scientific\nComputing 62, 831-874, 2015). We carefully compare our simulation results on\nthe growth rates with predictions in a classical paper by Burton et al. (Philos\nTrans R Soc Lond Ser A Math Phys Sci 243,299-358, 1951). Then, we propose\nimproved estimates on the growth rate with several different configurations,\nwhich are in agreement with our numerical simulations. The influence of\ndistribution of screw dislocations in a group on a line to the growth rate, and\nthe growth rate by a group including different rotational orientations of\nspirals are also studied in this paper.\n", "  We investigate the production of charm-baryon hypernucleus\n$^{16}_{\\Lambda_c^+}$O in the antiproton - $^{16}$O collisions within a fully\ncovariant model that is based on an effective Lagrangian approach. The explicit\n${\\bar \\Lambda}_c^ - \\Lambda_c^+$ production vertex is described by the\n$t$-channel $D^0$ and $D^{*0}$ meson-exchanges in the initial collision of the\nincident antiproton with one of the protons of the target nucleus. The\n$\\Lambda_c^+$ bound state spinors as well as the self-energies of the exchanged\nmesons employed in our calculations are derived from the quark-meson coupling\nmodel. The parameters of various vertices are taken to be the same as those\nused in our previous study of the elementary ${\\bar p} + p \\to {\\bar\n\\Lambda}_c^- + \\Lambda_c^+$ reaction. We find that for antiproton beam momenta\nof interest to the ${\\bar P}ANDA$ experiment, the 0$^\\circ$ differential cross\nsections for the formation of $^{16}_{\\Lambda_c^+}$O hypernuclear states with\nsimple particle-hole configurations, have magnitudes in the range of a few\n$\\mu$b/sr.\n", "  The classical procedure devised by Irving and Kirkwood in 1950 and completed\nslightly later by Noll produces counterparts of the basic balance laws of\nstandard continuum mechanics starting from an ordinary Hamiltonian description\nof the dynamics of a system of material points. Post-1980 molecular dynamics\nsimulations of the time evolution of such systems use extended Hamiltonians\nsuch as those introduced by Andersen, Nos\\'e, and Parrinello and Rahman. The\nadditional terms present in these extensions affect the statistical properties\nof the system so as to capture certain target phenomenologies that would\notherwise be beyond reach. We here propose a physically consistent application\nof the Irving-Kirkwood-Noll procedure to extended Hamiltonian systems of\nmaterial points. Our procedure produces balance equations at the continuum\nlevel featuring non-standard terms, because the presence of auxiliary degrees\nof freedom gives rise to additional fluxes and sources that influence the\nthermodynamic and transport properties of the continuum model. Being aware of\nthe additional contributions may prove crucial when designing multiscale\ncomputational schemes in which information is exchanged between the atomistic\nand continuum levels.\n", "  In a recent publication [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 034115 (2015)] we have derived a\nhierarchy of coupled differential equations in time domain to calculate the\nlinear optical properties of molecular aggregates. Here we provide details\nabout issues concerning the numerical implementation. In addition we present\nthe corresponding hierarchy in frequency domain.\n", "  Circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction of artificial\natoms, open transmission lines and electromagnetic resonators fabricated from\nsuperconducting electronics. While the theory of an artificial atom coupled to\none mode of a resonator is well studied, considering multiple modes leads to\ndivergences which are not well understood. Here, we introduce a\nfirst-principles model of a multimode resonator coupled to a Josephson junction\natom. Studying the model in the absence of any cutoff, in which the coupling\nrate to mode number $n$ scales as $\\sqrt{n}$ for $n$ up to $\\infty$, we find\nthat quantities such as the Lamb shift do not diverge due to a natural\nrescaling of the bare atomic parameters that arises directly from the circuit\nanalysis. Introducing a cutoff in the coupling from a non-zero capacitance of\nthe Josephson junction, we provide a physical interpretation of the decoupling\nof higher modes in the context of circuit analysis. In addition to explaining\nthe convergence of the quantum Rabi model with no cutoff, our work also\nprovides a useful framework for analyzing the ultra-strong coupling regime of\nmultimode circuit QED.\n", "  Pixel detectors currently in use by high energy physics experiments such as\nATLAS, CMS, LHCb, etc., are critical systems for tagging $B$ hadrons within\nparticle jets. However, the performance of standard tagging algorithms begins\nto fall in the case of highly boosted $B$ hadrons ($\\gamma \\beta = p/m >200$).\nThis paper builds on the work of our previous study that uses the jump in hit\nmultiplicity among the pixel layers when a $B$ hadron decays within the\ndetector volume. First, multiple $pp$ interactions within a finite luminous\nregion were found to have little effect. Second, the study has been extended to\nuse the multivariant techniques of an artificial neural network (ANN). After\ntraining, the ANN shows significant improvements to the ability to reject\nlight-quark and charm jets; thus increasing the expected significance of the\ntechnique.\n", "  Clouds have a strong impact on the climate of planetary atmospheres. The\npotential scattering greenhouse effect of CO2 ice clouds in the atmospheres of\nterrestrial extrasolar planets is of particular interest because it might\ninfluence the position and thus the extension of the outer boundary of the\nclassic habitable zone around main sequence stars. Here, the impact of CO2 ice\nclouds on the surface temperatures of terrestrial planets with CO2 dominated\natmospheres, orbiting different types of stars is studied. Additionally, their\ncorresponding effect on the position of the outer habitable zone boundary is\nevaluated. For this study, a radiative-convective atmospheric model is used the\ncalculate the surface temperatures influenced by CO2 ice particles. The clouds\nare included using a parametrised cloud model. The atmospheric model includes a\ngeneral discrete ordinate radiative transfer that can describe the anisotropic\nscattering by the cloud particles accurately. A net scattering greenhouse\neffect caused by CO2 clouds is only obtained in a rather limited parameter\nrange which also strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature. For\ncool M-stars, CO2 clouds only provide about 6 K of additional greenhouse\nheating in the best case scenario. On the other hand, the surface temperature\nfor a planet around an F-type star can be increased by 30 K if carbon dioxide\nclouds are present. Accordingly, the extension of the habitable zone due to\nclouds is quite small for late-type stars. Higher stellar effective\ntemperatures, on the other hand, can lead to outer HZ boundaries about 0.5 au\nfarther out than the corresponding clear-sky values.\n", "  The problem of construction of ladder operators for rationally extended\nquantum harmonic oscillator (REQHO) systems of a general form is investigated\nin the light of existence of different schemes of the Darboux-Crum-Krein-Adler\ntransformations by which such systems can be generated from the quantum\nharmonic oscillator. Any REQHO system is characterized by the number of\nseparated states in its spectrum, the number of `valence bands' in which the\nseparated states are organized, and by the total number of the missing energy\nlevels and their position. All these peculiarities of a REQHO system are shown\nto be detected and reflected by a trinity $(\\mathcal{A}^\\pm$,\n$\\mathcal{B}^\\pm$, $\\mathcal{C}^\\pm$) of the basic (primary) lowering and\nraising ladder operators related between themselves by certain algebraic\nidentities with coefficients polynomially-dependent on the Hamiltonian. We show\nthat all the secondary, higher-order ladder operators are obtainable by a\ncomposition of the basic ladder operators of the trinity which form the set of\nthe spectrum-generating operators. Each trinity, in turn, can be constructed\nfrom the intertwining operators of the two complementary minimal schemes of the\nDarboux-Crum-Krein-Adler transformations.\n", "  Background: Deuteron-induced one-neutron transfer reactions have been used to\nextract single-particle properties of nuclei, and the adiabatic (AD)\napproximation is often used to simply treat the deuteron breakup states.\nPurpose: The primary goal is to examine the validity of the AD approximation\nfor the ($d,p$) reaction systematically. We clarify also the role of the\nclosed-channels often ignored in the description of breakup reactions. Methods:\nWe calculate the ($d,p$) cross sections with the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels method (CDCC) for 128 reactions systems and compare the\nresults with those obtained by the CDCC calculation with the AD approximation.\nEffect of the closed channels are investigated by ignoring the closed channels\nin CDCC. Results: The AD approximation affects in general the ($d,p$) cross\nsection by less than 20 %, but some exceptional nonadiabatic cases for which\nthe AD approximation breaks down are found. The closed channels turn out to\ngive significant effects on the cross section at deuteron energies less than\nabout 10 MeV. Conclusions: The use of the AD approximation in the description\nof the ($d,p$) reaction can be justified in many cases, with the uncertainty of\nless than about 20 %. The existence of some nonadiabatic cases nevertheless\nshould be realized. The neglect of the closed channels without confirming the\nconvergence of the CDCC result is not recommended.\n", "  Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) occur when a compact object orbits a\nmuch larger one, like a solar-mass black hole around a supermassive black hole.\nThe orbit has 3 frequencies which evolve through the inspiral. If the orbital\nradial frequency and polar frequency become commensurate, the system passes\nthrough a transient resonance. Evolving through resonance causes a jump in the\nevolution of the orbital parameters. We study these jumps and their impact on\nEMRI gravitational-wave detection. Jumps are smaller for lower eccentricity\norbits; since most EMRIs have small eccentricities when passing through\nresonances, we expect that the impact on detection will be small. Neglecting\nthe effects of transient resonances leads to a loss of ~4% of detectable\nsignals for an astrophysically motivated population of EMRIs.\n", "  We have investigated the crystal structure and physical properties of\nLaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the\nBiCh2-based layered compound family. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and\nRietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters, we clearly found\nthat the in-plane disorder in the BiSSe layer was fully suppressed for all x.\nIn LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are suddenly\ninduced by electron doping even at x = 0.05 and 0.1 with a monoclinic\nstructure. In addition, x (F concentration) dependence of the transition\ntemperature (Tc) for x = 0.2-0.5 with a tetragonal structure shows an\nanomalously flat phase diagram. With these experimental facts, we have proposed\nthe intrinsic phase diagram of the ideal BiCh2-based superconductors with less\nin-plane disorder.\n", "  Valley polarization (VP), an induced imbalance in the populations of a\nmulti-valley electronic system, allows emission of second harmonic (SH) light\neven in centrosymmetric crystals such as graphene. Whereas in systems such as\nMoS$\\mathrm{_2}$ or BN this adds to their intrinsic quadratic response, SH\ngeneration in a multi-valley inversion-symmetric crystal can provide a direct\nmeasure of valley polarization. By computing the nonlinear response and\ncharacterizing theoretically the respective SH as a function of polarization,\ntemperature, electron density, and degree of VP, we demonstrate the possibility\nof disentangling and individually quantifying the intrinsic and valley\ncontributions to the SH. A specific experimental setup is proposed to obtain\ndirect quantitative information about the degree of VP and allow its remote\nmapping. This approach could prove useful for direct, contactless, real-space\nmonitoring of valley injection and other applications of valley transport and\nvalleytronics.\n", "  The lepton flavor violating decay of the Standard Model-like Higgs boson\n(LFVHD), h->\\mu\\tau, is discussed in seesaw models at the one-loop level. Based\non particular analytic expressions of Passarino-Veltman functions, the two\nunitary and 't Hooft Feynman gauges are used to compute the branching ratio of\nLFVHD and compare with results reported recently. In the minimal seesaw (MSS)\nmodel, the branching ratio was investigated in the whole valid range\n10^{-9}-10^{15} GeV of new neutrino mass scale m_{n_6}. Using the Casas-Ibarra\nparameterization, this branching ratio enhances with large and increasing\nm_{n_6}. But the maximal value can reach only order of 10^{-11}. Interesting\nrelations of LFVHD predicted by the MSS and inverse seesaw (ISS) model are\ndiscussed. The ratio between two LFVHD branching ratios predicted by the ISS\nand MSS is simply m^2_{n_6}\\mu^{-2}_X, where \\mu_X is the small neutrino mass\nscale in the ISS. The consistence between different calculations is shown\nprecisely from analytical approach.\n", "  What are the fundamental limitations of reconstructing the properties of dark\nenergy, given cosmological observations in the quasilinear regime in a range of\nredshifts, to be as precise as required? The aim of this paper is to address\nthis question by constructing model-independent observables, whilst completely\nignoring practical problems of real-world observations. Non-Gaussianities\nalready present in the initial conditions are not directly accessible from\nobservations, because of a perfect degeneracy with the non-Gaussianities\narising from the nonlinear matter evolution in generalized dark energy models.\nBy imposing a specific set of evolution equations that should cover a range of\ndark energy cosmologies, we however find a constraint equation for the linear\nstructure growth rate $f_1$ expressed in terms of model-independent\nobservables. Entire classes of dark energy models which do not satisfy this\nconstraint equation could be ruled out, and for models satisfying it we could\nreconstruct e.g. the nonlocal bias parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n", "  Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) are one of the largest astrophysical sources in\nthe Universe with an overall projected linear size of ~0.7 Mpc or more. Last\nsix decades of radio astronomy research has led to the detection of thousands\nof radio galaxies. But only ~ 300 of them can be classified as GRGs. The\nreasons behind their large size and rarity are unknown. We carried out a\nsystematic search for these radio giants and found a large sample of GRGs. In\nthis paper, we report the discovery of 25 GRGs from NVSS, in the redshift range\n(z) ~ 0.07 to 0.67. Their physical sizes range from ~0.8 Mpc to ~4 Mpc. Eight\nof these GRGs have sizes greater than 2Mpc which is a rarity. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we investigate the mid-IR properties of the optical hosts\nof the GRGs and classify them securely into various AGN types using the WISE\nmid-IR colours. Using radio and IR data, four of the hosts of GRGs were\nobserved to be radio loud quasars that extend up to 2 Mpc in radio size. These\nGRGs missed detection in earlier searches possibly because of their highly\ndiffuse nature, low surface brightness and lack of optical data. The new GRGs\nare a significant addition to the existing sample that will contribute to\nbetter understanding of the physical properties of radio giants.\n", "  We present a class of spherically symmetric spacetimes corresponding to\nbubbles separating two regions with constant values of the scalar curvature, or\nequivalently with two different cosmological constants, in quadratic F(R)\ntheory. The bubbles are obtained by means of the junction formalism, and the\nmatching hypersurface supports in general a thin shell and a gravitational\ndouble layer. In particular, we find that pure double layers are possible for\nappropriate values of the parameters of the model whenever the quadratic\ncoefficient is negative. This is the first example of a pure double layer in a\ngravitational theory.\n", "  We investigate minimal excitation states for heat transport into a fractional\nquantum Hall system driven out of equilibrium by means of time-periodic voltage\npulses. A quantum point contact allows for tunneling of fractional\nquasi-particles between opposite edge states, thus acting as a beam splitter in\nthe framework of the electron quantum optics. Excitations are then studied\nthrough heat and mixed noise generated by the random partitioning at the\nbarrier. It is shown that levitons, the single-particle excitations of a filled\nFermi sea recently observed in experiments, represent the cleanest states for\nheat transport, since excess heat and mixed shot noise both vanish only when\nLorentzian voltage pulses carrying integer electric charge are applied to the\nconductor. This happens in the integer quantum Hall regime and for Laughlin\nfractional states as well, with no influence of fractional physics on the\nconditions for clean energy pulses. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness\nof such excitations to the overlap of Lorentzian wavepackets. Even though mixed\nand heat noise have nonlinear dependence on the voltage bias, and despite the\nnon-integer power-law behavior arising from the fractional quantum Hall\nphysics, an arbitrary superposition of levitons always generates minimal\nexcitation states.\n", "  We train and apply convolutional neural networks, a machine learning\ntechnique developed to learn from and classify image data, to\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) imaging for the\nidentification of potential strong lensing systems. An ensemble of four\nconvolutional neural networks was trained on images of simulated galaxy-galaxy\nlenses. The training sets consisted of a total of 62,406 simulated lenses and\n64,673 non-lens negative examples generated with two different methodologies.\nThe networks were able to learn the features of simulated lenses with accuracy\nof up to 99.8% and a purity and completeness of 94-100% on a test set of 2000\nsimulations. An ensemble of trained networks was applied to all of the 171\nsquare degrees of the CFHTLS wide field image data, identifying 18,861\ncandidates including 63 known and 139 other potential lens candidates. A second\nsearch of 1.4 million early type galaxies selected from the survey catalog as\npotential deflectors, identified 2,465 candidates including 117 previously\nknown lens candidates, 29 confirmed lenses/high-quality lens candidates, 266\nnovel probable or potential lenses and 2097 candidates we classify as false\npositives. For the catalog-based search we estimate a completeness of 21-28%\nwith respect to detectable lenses and a purity of 15%, with a false-positive\nrate of 1 in 671 images tested. We predict a human astronomer reviewing\ncandidates produced by the system would identify ~20 probable lenses and 100\npossible lenses per hour in a sample selected by the robot. Convolutional\nneural networks are therefore a promising tool for use in the search for lenses\nin current and forthcoming surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope.\n", "  We propose a new concept, the transversely trapping surface (TTS), as an\nextension of the static photon surface characterizing the strong gravity region\nof a static/stationary spacetime in terms of photon behavior. The TTS is\ndefined as a static/stationary timelike surface $S$ whose spatial section is a\nclosed two-surface, such that arbitrary photons emitted tangentially to $S$\nfrom arbitrary points on $S$ propagate on or toward the inside of $S$. We study\nthe properties of TTSs for static spacetimes and axisymmetric stationary\nspacetimes. In particular, the area $A_0$ of a TTS is proved to be bounded as\n$A_0\\le 4\\pi(3GM)^2$ under certain conditions, where $G$ is the Newton constant\nand $M$ is the total mass. The connection between the TTS and the loosely\ntrapped surface proposed by us [arXiv:1701.00564] is also examined.\n", "  Experimental demonstrations of 1D van der Waals material tellurium have been\npresented by Raman spectroscopy under strain and magneto-transport. Raman\nspectroscopy measurements have been performed under strains along different\nprinciple axes. Pronounced strain response along c-axis is observed due to the\nstrong intra-chain covalent bonds, while no strain response is obtained along\na-axis due to the weak inter-chain van der Waals interaction. Magneto-transport\nresults further verify its anisotropic property, resulting in dramatically\ndistinct magneto-resistance behaviors in terms of three different magnetic\nfield directions. Specifically, phase coherence length extracted from weak\nantilocalization effect, L$_{\\Phi}$ ~ T$^{-0.5}$, claims its 2D transport\ncharacteristics when an applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the thin\nfilm. In contrast, L$_{\\Phi}$ ~ T$^{-0.33}$ is obtained from universal\nconductance fluctuations once the magnetic field is along c-axis of Te,\nindicating its nature of 1D transport along the helical atomic chains. Our\nstudies, which are obtained on high quality single crystal tellurium thin film,\nappear to serve as strong evidences of its 1D van der Waals structure from\nexperimental perspectives. It is the aim of this paper to address this special\nconcept that differs from the previous well-studied 1D nanowires or 2D van der\nWaals materials.\n", "  We perform three dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\nto study the parametric decay instability of Alfven waves in turbulent plasmas\nand explore its possible applications in the solar wind. We find that, over a\nbroad range of parameters in background turbulence amplitudes, the parametric\ndecay instability of an Alfven wave with various amplitudes can still occur,\nthough its growth rate in turbulent plasmas tends to be lower than both the\ntheoretical linear theory prediction and that in the non-turbulent situations.\nSpatial - temporal FFT analyses of density fluctuations produced by the\nparametric decay instability match well with the dispersion relation of the\nslow MHD waves. This result may provide an explanation of the generation\nmechanism of slow waves in the solar wind observed at 1 AU. It further\nhighlights the need to explore the effects of density variations in modifying\nthe turbulence properties as well as in heating the solar wind plasmas.\n", "  The work of Braginsky introduced radiation pressure dynamical backaction, in\nwhich a mechanical oscillator that is parametrically coupled to an\nelectromagnetic mode can experience a change in its rigidity and its damping\nrate. The finite cavity electromagnetic decay rate can lead to either\namplification or cooling of the mechanical oscillator, and lead in particular\nto a parametric oscillatory instability, associated with regenerative\noscillations of the mechanical oscillator, an effect limiting the circulating\npower in laser gravitational wave interferometers. These effects implicitly\nrely on an electromagnetic cavity whose dissipation rate vastly exceeds that of\nthe mechanical oscillator, a condition naturally satisfied in most\noptomechanical systems. Here we consider the opposite limit, where the\nmechanical dissipation is engineered to dominate over the electromagnetic one,\nessentially reversing role of electromagnetic and mechanical degree of freedom.\nAs a result, the electromagnetic field is now subject to dynamical backaction:\nthe mechanical oscillator provides a feedback mechanism which modifies the\ndamping rate of the electromagnetic cavity. We describe this phenomenon in the\nspirit of Braginsky's original description, invoking finite cavity delay and\nhighlighting the role of dissipation. Building on previous experimental work,\nwe demonstrate this dynamical backaction on light in a superconducting\nmicrowave optomechanical circuit. In particular, we drive the system above the\nparametric instability threshold of the microwave mode, leading to maser action\nand demonstrate injection locking of the maser, which stabilizes its frequency\nand reduces its noise.\n", "  We investigated the properties of a sample of red Quasi-stellar Objects\n(QSOs) using optical, radio, and infrared data. These QSOs were selected from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) quasar catalog. We only\nselected sources with sky coverage of the Very Large Array Faint Images of the\nRadio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (VLA FIRST) survey, and searched for sources\nwith Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) counterparts. We defined the\nspectral color of the QSOs based on the flux ratio of the rest frame 4000$\\AA$\nto 3000$\\AA$ continuum emission to select red QSOs and typical QSOs. In\naccordance with this criterion, only QSOs with redshifts between 0.3 and 1.2\ncould be selected. We found that the red QSOs have stronger infrared emission\nthan the typical QSOs do. We noted that the number ratios of the red QSOs to\nthe typical QSOs decrease with increasing redshifts, although the number of the\ntypical QSOs increase with redshifts. Furthermore, at high redshifts, the\nluminosity distributions of the typical QSOs and the red QSOs seem to have\nsimilar luminosity distribution peaks; however, at low redshifts, the\nluminosities of the red QSOs seem to be lower than those of the typical QSOs.\nThese findings suggest that there might be at least two types of red QSOs in\nour QSO samples.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenides (WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$) have drawn much\nattention, recently, because of the nonsaturating extremely large\nmagnetoresistance (XMR) observed in these compounds in addition to the\npredictions of likely type-II Weyl semimetals. Contrary to the topological\ninsulators or Dirac semimetals where XMR is linearly dependent on the field, in\nWTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ the XMR is nonlinearly dependent on the field, suggesting\nan entirely different mechanism. Electron-hole compensation has been proposed\nas a mechanism of this nonsaturating XMR in WTe$_2$, while it is yet to be\nclear in the case of MoTe$_2$ which has an identical crystal structure of\nWTe$_2$ at low temperatures. In this paper, we report low-energy electronic\nstructure and Fermi surface topology of MoTe$_2$ using angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectrometry (ARPES) technique and first-principle calculations,\nand compare them with that of WTe$_2$ to understand the mechanism of XMR. Our\nmeasurements demonstrate that MoTe$_2$ is an uncompensated semimetal, contrary\nto WTe$_2$ in which compensated electron-hole pockets have been identified,\nruling out the applicability of charge compensation theory for the\nnonsaturating XMR in MoTe$_2$. In this context, we also discuss the\napplicability of the existing other conjectures on the XMR of these compounds.\n", "  We first argue that the covalent bond and the various closed-shell\ninteractions can be thought of as symmetry broken versions of one and the same\ninteraction, viz., the multi-center bond. We use specially chosen molecular\nunits to show that the symmetry breaking is controlled by density and\nelectronegativity variation. We show that the bond order changes with bond\ndeformation but in a step-like fashion, regions of near constancy separated by\nelectronic localization transitions. These will often cause displacive\ntransitions as well so that the bond strength, order, and length are\nestablished self-consistently. We further argue on the inherent relation of the\ncovalent, closed-shell, and multi-center interactions with ionic and metallic\nbonding. All of these interactions can be viewed as distinct sectors on a phase\ndiagram with density and electronegativity variation as control variables; the\nionic and covalent/secondary sectors are associated with on-site and bond-order\ncharge density wave respectively, the metallic sectorwith an electronic fluid.\nWhile displaying a contiguity at low densities, the metallic and ionic\ninteractions represent distinct phases separated by discontinuous transitions\nat sufficiently high densities. Multi-center interactions emerge as a hybrid of\nthe metallic and ionic bond that results from spatial coexistence of\ndelocalized and localized electrons. In the present description, the issue of\nthe stability of a compound is that of mutual miscibility of electronic fluids\nwith distinct degrees of electron localization, supra-atomic ordering in\ncomplex inorganic compounds comes about naturally. The notions of electronic\nlocalization advanced hereby suggest a high throughput, automated procedure for\nscreening candidate compounds and structures with regard to stability, without\nthe need for computationally costly geometric optimization.\n", "  We consider periodic arrangements of metal nanostructures and study the\neffect of periodicity on the localised surface plasmon resonance of the\nstructures within an electrostatic eigenmode approximation. We show that within\nthis limit, the collective surface plasmon resonances of the periodic\nstructures can be expressed in terms of superpositions of the eigenmodes of\nuncoupled nanostructures that exhibit a standing--wave character delocalised\nacross the entire periodic structure. The formalism derived successfully\nenables the design and accounts for the observation of plasmonic edge-states in\nperiodic structures.\n", "  Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown using a CsCl/KCl flux. The\ngrown crystals have a plate-like shape with ~1-2 mm square size in a\nwell-developed ab-plane. The Cd doping in the crystals was successfully\ncharacterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron probe\nmicroanalysis techniques. The superconductivity of La(O,F)BiS2 was gradually\nsuppressed with Cd doping. The superconducting transition temperature with zero\nresistivity of La(O0.54F0.46)(Bi0.92Cd0.08)S2 was 2.3 K. The Cd doping does not\nchange the superconducting anisotropy so much, albeit the considerable\nsuppression of Tc.\n", "  The shapes of neutrino spectra and fluxes from representative stars in the\nsolar neighborhood up to 10 pc are calculated. The individual contribution of\nthe most important, specific stellar objects (the alpha-Centauri system, Sirius\nA, Procyon, Vega, Fomalhaut and Altair) are determined and investigated by\ndetailed stellar modeling. The possibility for a potential detection is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Brillouin light spectroscopy is a powerful and robust technique for measuring\nthe interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in thin films with broken\ninversion symmetry. Here we show that the magnon visibility, i.e. the intensity\nof the inelastically scattered light, strongly depends on the thickness of the\ndielectric seed material - SiO$_2$. By using both, analytical thin-film optics\nand numerical calculations, we reproduce the experimental data. We therefore\nprovide a guideline for the maximization of the signal by adapting the\nsubstrate properties to the geometry of the measurement. Such a boost-up of the\nsignal eases the magnon visualization in ultrathin magnetic films, speeds-up\nthe measurement and increases the reliability of the data.\n", "  We investigate the critical behavior and the duality property of the\nferromagnetic $q$-state clock model on the square lattice based on the\ntensor-network formalism. From the entanglement spectra of local tensors\ndefined in the original and dual lattices, we obtain the exact self-dual points\nfor the model with $q \\leq 5 $ and approximate self-dual points for $q \\geq 6$.\nWe calculate accurately the lower and upper critical temperatures for the\nsix-state clock model from the fixed-point tensors determined using the\nhigher-order tensor renormalization group method and compare with other\nnumerical results.\n", "  This paper explores the effects of finite width in processes of pair\nproduction of a heavy eXtra Quark (XQ) with charge 2/3 and its subsequent decay\ninto a Dark Matter (DM) candidate -- either scalar or vector -- and Standard\nModel (SM) up-type quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This dynamics has\nbeen ignored so far in standard experimental searches of heavy quarks decaying\nto DM and we assess herein the regions of validity of current approaches, based\non the assumption that the XQ has a narrow width. Further, we discuss the\nconfigurations of masses, widths and couplings where the latter breaks down.\n", "  Considered typical processes of rod bending under strong longitudinal\ncompression. The dynamic equation of bending correspponds to a perturbation of\nthe two- dimensional Laplace equation. It is established that, for these\nprocesses, expanding of do- mains of rapid increasing of bending begins in\nsmall neighborhoods of singularity points of solutions of the limiting\nLaplace's equation. The initial stages of these increases are described using\nthe Hardy integral.\n", "  The Cobalt-germanium (Co-Ge) is a fascinating complex alloy system that has\nunique structure and exhibit range of interesting magnetic properties which\nwould change when reduce to nanoscale dimension. At this experimental work, the\nhigh-aspect-ratio Co5Ge3 nanoparticle with average size of 8nm was synthesized\nby gas aggregation-type cluster-deposition technology. The nanostructure\nmorphology of the as-made binary Co5Ge3 nanoparticles demonstrate excellent\nsingle-crystalline hexagonal structure with mostly preferable growth along\n(110) and (102) directions. In contrast the bulk possess Pauli paramagnetic\nspin-order at all range of temperature, here we discover size-driven new\nmagnetic ordering of as-synthesized Co5Ge3 nanoparticles exhibiting\nferromagnetism at room temperature with saturation magnetization of Ms = 32.2\nemu/cm3. This is first report of observing such new magnetic spin ordering in\nthis kind of material at nano-size which the magnetization has lower\nsensitivity to thermal energy fluctuation and exhibit high Curie temperature\nclose to 850 K. This ferromagnetic behavior along with higher Curie temperature\nat Co5Ge3 nanoparticles are attributes to low-dimension and quantum-confinement\neffect which imposes strong spin coupling and provides a new set of size-driven\nspin structures in Co5Ge3 nanoparticle which no such magnetic behavior being\npresent in the bulk of same material. This fundamental scientific study\nprovides important insights into the formation, structural, and the magnetic\nproperty of sub 10nm Co5Ge3 nanostructure which shall lead to promising\npractical versatile applications for magneto- germanide based nano-devices.\n", "  Chlorine isotopologues of polychlorinated organic compounds are usually\nrecognized to follow binomial distribution. Is this recognition exactly true?\nThis study presents a solid theoretical derivation to prove whether the\nisotopologue distributions of organochlorines are binomial or not, and\ninvestigates the implications of the distributions to relevant experimental\nstudies. During synthetic reactions, the C-Cl bonds with stronger strengths are\nmore readily to be formed with heavy isotopes. The chlorine KIEs are higher\nduring the breakages of the stronger C-Cl bonds than during the breaking of the\nweaker ones. For a synthetic organochlorine, if the rate-limiting step during a\nchlorination reaction is the formation of C-Cl bonds, then chlorine KIE takes\neffect in the reaction, resulting in always higher chlorine isotope ratio on\nthe reaction position than that of the initial chlorine atoms from the chlorine\nsource. Chlorine KIEs vary during different chlorination reactions, leading to\ninconsistent chlorine isotope ratios on different reaction positions of\nasymmetric reaction intermediates and final products. If the rate-determining\nstep is the generation of reactive chlorine atoms and the initial isotope ratio\nof the chlorine source is constant, then the chlorine isotope ratios on the\nreaction positions of all intermediates and final products are equivalent,\ndemonstrating that the isotopologues follow binomial distribution. After\nphysical changes and dechlorination reactions, organochlorines in the\nenvironment are unlikely binomially distributed. Experimental data show that\nthe detected isotopologues of all the investigated organochlorines disobeyed\nbinomial distribution. This study may bring a new perspective about the\nchlorine isotopologue distributions of organochlorines, and the proposed\nsolutions may help to obtain better data for quantification and CSIA-Cl of\norganochlorines.\n", "  On 1977 August 15, the Ohio State University Radio Observatory detected a\nstrong narrowband signal northwest of the globular star cluster M55 in the\nconstellation Sagittarius. The frequency of the signal, which closely matched\nthe hydrogen line (1420.40575177 MHz), peaked at approximately 2316 EDT. Since\nthen, several investigations into the Wow signal have ruled out the source as\nterrestrial in origin or other objects such as satellites, planets and\nasteroids. From 1977 July 27 to 1977 August 15, comets 266P Christensen and\nP2008 Y2 (Gibbs) were transiting in the neighborhood of the Chi Sagittarii star\ngroup. Because the frequency for the Wow! signal fell close to the hydrogen\nline, and the hydrogen clouds of 266P/Christensen and P/2008 Y2 (Gibbs) were in\nthe proximity of the right ascension and declination values of the Wow signal,\nthe comet(s) and or their hydrogen clouds are strong candidates for the source\nof the 1977 Wow signal.\n", "  We present a numerical treatment of a novel non-perturbative lattice\nregularization of a $1+1d$ $SU(2)$ Chiral Gauge Theory. Our approach follows\nrecent proposals that exploit the newly discovered connection between anomalies\nand topological (or entangled) states to show how to create a lattice\nregularization of any anomaly-free chiral gauge theory. In comparison to other\nmethods, our regularization enjoys on-site fermions and gauge action, as well\nas a physically transparent fermion Hilbert space. We follow the `mirror\nfermion' approach, in which we first create a lattice regularization of both\nthe chiral theory and its mirror conjugate and then introduce interactions that\ngap out only the mirror theory. The connection between topological states and\nanomalies shows that such interactions exist if the chiral theory is free of\nall quantum anomalies. Instead of numerically intractable fermion-fermion\ninteractions, we couple the mirror theory to a Higgs field driven into a\nsymmetry-preserving, disordered, gapped phase.\n", "  In this work, a planar phased array antenna was engineered with\nultra-wideband (UWB) performance that covers portions of the L-, S-, and\nC-bands. The unit cell design contains a driven layer that is directly\nconnected to a single coaxial feed and a parasitic layer located above the\ndriven layer separated by free space. This design does not require a balun or\nany vias between the antenna ground plane and the driven layer, resulting in a\nsimple antenna stack-up consisting of only planar layers, aside from the feed\nstructure. As a consequence, the complexity, and potentially sensitivity to\nmechanical tolerances, is reduced. The simulated results of this unbalanced\nphased array are discussed and experimentally validated.\n", "  One of the major open problems in computer vision is detection of features in\nvisually impaired images. In this paper, we describe a potential solution using\nPhase Stretch Transform, a new computational approach for image analysis, edge\ndetection and resolution enhancement that is inspired by the physics of the\nphotonic time stretch technique. We mathematically derive the intrinsic\nnonlinear transfer function and demonstrate how it leads to (1) superior\nperformance at low contrast levels and (2) a reconfigurable operator for\nhyper-dimensional classification. We prove that the Phase Stretch Transform\nequalizes the input image brightness across the range of intensities resulting\nin a high dynamic range in visually impaired images. We also show further\nimprovement in the dynamic range by combining our method with the conventional\ntechniques. Finally, our results show a method for computation of mathematical\nderivatives via group delay dispersion operations.\n", "  QED in 1+1 dimensions possesses two rare and interesting properties - It is\nboth exactly solvable and confining. The combination of these two properties\nmakes it the perfect candidate for a toy model for QCD. We study this model on\nan interval, where new features of the theory are revealed. We show that on an\ninterval, the model admits charged states, which is unexpected for a confining\ntheory. We show that the charged states are boundary states, and calculate\ntheir mass. This result could lead one to expect a similar result in QCD, where\nsingle quarks could be isolated near a boundary.\n", "  Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy it is revealed that in the\nvicinity of optimal doping the electronic structure of La2-xSrxCuO4 cuprate\nundergoes an electronic reconstruction associated with a wave vector q_a=(pi,\n0). The reconstructed Fermi surface and folded band are distinct to the shadow\nbands observed in BSCCO cuprates and in underdoped La2-xSrxCuO4 with x <= 0.12,\nwhich shift the primary band along the zone diagonal direction. Furthermore the\nfolded bands appear only with q_a=(pi, 0) vector, but not with q_b= (0, pi). We\ndemonstrate that the absence of q_b reconstruction is not due to the\nmatrix-element effects in the photoemission process, which indicates the\nfour-fold symmetry is broken in the system.\n", "  The stationary Schroedinger equation of the harmonic oscillator is deformed\nby a Darboux transformation to construct time-dependent potentials with the\noscillator profile. The Darboux (supersymmetric or factorization) method is\nusually developed in the spatial variables of the Schroedinger equation. Here\nwe follow a variation introduced by Bagrov, Samsonov and Shekoyan to include\nthe time-variable as a parameter of the transformation.\n", "  Thermal rectification and negative differential thermal conductance were\nrealized in harmonic chains in this work. We used the generalized\nCaldeira-Leggett model to study the heat flow. In contrast to the most previous\nstudies considering only the linear system-bath coupling, we considered the\nnonlinear system-bath coupling based on recent experiment [A. Eichler \\emph{et\nal.}, Nat. Nanotech. \\textbf{6}, 339 (2011)]. When the linear coupling constant\nis weak, the multiphonon processes induced by the nonlinear coupling allow more\nphonons transport across the system-bath interface and hence the heat current\nis enhanced. Consequently, thermal rectification and negative differential\nthermal conductance are achieved when the nonlinear couplings are asymmetric.\nHowever, when the linear coupling constant is strong, the umklapp processes\ndominate the multiphonon processes. Nonlinear coupling suppresses the heat\ncurrent. Thermal rectification is also achieved. But the direction of\nrectification is reversed comparing to the results of weak linear coupling\nconstant.\n", "  The availability of big data recorded from massively multiplayer online\nrole-playing games (MMORPGs) allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the\npotential connection between individuals' network positions and their economic\noutputs. We use a statistical filtering method to construct dependence networks\nfrom weighted friendship networks of individuals. We investigate the 30\ndistinct motif positions in the 13 directed triadic motifs which represent\nmicroscopic dependences among individuals. Based on the structural similarity\nof motif positions, we further classify individuals into different groups. The\nnode position diversity of individuals is found to be positively correlated\nwith their economic outputs. We also find that the economic outputs of leaf\nnodes are significantly lower than that of the other nodes in the same motif.\nOur findings shed light on understanding the influence of network structure on\neconomic activities and outputs in socioeconomic system.\n", "  Using a solid electrolyte to tune the carrier density in thin-film materials\nis an emerging technique that has potential applications in both basic and\napplied research. Until now, only materials containing small ions, such as\nprotons and lithium ions, have been used to demonstrate the gating effect.\nHere, we report the study of a lab-synthesised sodium-ion-based solid\nelectrolyte, which shows a much stronger capability to tune the carrier density\nin graphene than previously reported lithium-ion-based solid electrolyte. Our\nfindings may stimulate the search for solid electrolytes better suited for\ngating applications, taking benefit of many existing materials developed for\nbattery research.\n", "  In this paper, it is established, in the case of graphs, that time-like\nextremal surfaces of dimension $1+n$ in the Minkowski space of dimension\n$1+n+m$ can be described by a symmetric hyperbolic system of PDEs with the very\nsimple structure (reminiscent of the inviscid Burgers equation)$$ \\partial\\_t W\n+ \\sum\\_{j=1}^n A\\_j(W)\\partial\\_{x\\_j} W\n=0,\\;\\;\\;W:\\;(t,x)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1+n}\\rightarrow\nW(t,x)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n+m+\\binom{m+n}{n}},$$where each $A\\_j(W)$ is just a\n$\\big(n+m+\\binom{m+n}{n}\\big)\\times\\big(n+m+\\binom{m+n}{n}\\big)$ symmetric\nmatrix dependinglinearly on $W$.\n", "  I examine a possible spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) due to its absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. I show that\neven subtle intergalactic opacity of $1 \\times 10^{-7}\\, \\mathrm{mag}\\, h\\,\n\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-1}$ at the CMB wavelengths in the local Universe causes\nnon-negligible CMB absorption and decline of the CMB intensity because the\nopacity steeply increases with redshift. The CMB should be distorted even\nduring the epoch of the Universe defined by redshifts $z < 10$. For this epoch,\nthe maximum spectral distortion of the CMB is at least $20 \\times 10^{-22}\n\\,\\mathrm{Wm}^{-2}\\, \\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}\\, \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ at 300 GHz being well\nabove the sensitivity of the COBE/FIRAS, WMAP or Planck flux measurements. If\ndust mass is considered to be redshift dependent with noticeable dust abundance\nat redshifts 2-4, the predicted CMB distortion is even higher. The CMB would be\ndistorted also in a perfectly transparent universe due to dust in galaxies but\nthis effect is lower by one order than that due to intergalactic opacity. The\nfact that the distortion of the CMB by dust is not observed is intriguing and\nquestions either opacity and extinction law measurements or validity of the\ncurrent model of the Universe.\n", "  In this work cotton and polyester fabric were coated with silica nano\nparticles using pad-dry-cure method. The prepared composite fabrics were\nanalyzed in terms of change in their thermal degradation properties. The\noxidative degradation characteristic of control and treated samples were\nstudied using Thermo Gravimetric technique. The mass loss profile of untreated\nfabric compared with treated fabric. The results indicate that the thermal\ndegradation rate was lower in treated sample as compare to control fabrics.\n", "  Combining large-area optical quasar surveys with the new far-infrared\nHerschel-ATLAS Data Release 1, we search for an observational signature\nassociated with the minority of quasars possessing bright far-infrared (FIR)\nluminosities. We find that FIR-bright quasars show broad CIV emission line\nblueshifts in excess of that expected from the optical luminosity alone,\nindicating particularly powerful nuclear outflows. The quasars show no signs of\nhaving redder optical colours than the general ensemble of optically-selected\nquasars, ruling out differences in line-of-sight dust within the host galaxies.\nWe postulate that these objects may be caught in a special evolutionary phase,\nwith unobscured, high black hole accretion rates and correspondingly strong\nnuclear outflows. The high FIR emission found in these objects is then either a\nresult of star formation related to the outflow, or is due to dust within the\nhost galaxy illuminated by the quasar. We are thus directly witnessing\ncoincident small-scale nuclear processes and galaxy-wide activity, commonly\ninvoked in galaxy simulations which rely on feedback from quasars to influence\ngalaxy evolution.\n", "  We report on tunnel ionization of Xe by 2-cycle, intense, infrared laser\npulses and its dependence on carrier-envelope-phase (CEP). At low values of\noptical field ($E$), the ionization yield is maximum for cos-like pulses with\nthe dependence becoming stronger for higher charge states. At higher\n$E$-values, the CEP dependence either washes out or flips. A simple\nphenomenological model is developed that predicts and confirms the observed\nresults. CEP effects are seen to persist for 8-cycle pulses. Unexpectedly,\nelectron rescattering plays an unimportant role in the observed CEP dependence.\nOur results provide fresh perspectives in ultrafast, strong-field ionization\ndynamics of multi-electron systems that lie at the core of attosecond science.\n", "  We show that an $n-n^{-}-n$ junction in 2D semiconductors can flexibly\nrealize two basic valleytronic functions, i.e. valley filter and valley source,\nwith gate controlled switchability between the two. Upon carrier flux passing\nthrough the junction, the valley filter and valley source functions are enabled\nrespectively by intra- and inter-valley scatterings, and the two functions\ndominate respectively at small and large band-offset between the $n$ and\n$n^{-}$ regions. It can be generally shown that, the valley filter effect has\nan angular dependent polarity and vanishes under angular integration, by the\nsame constraint from time-reversal symmetry that leads to its absence in\none-dimension. These findings are demonstrated for monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides and graphene using tight-binding calculations. We further show\nthat junction along chiral directions can concentrate the valley pump in an\nangular interval largely separated from the bias direction, allowing efficient\nhavest of valley polarization in a cross-bar device.\n", "  Nonlinear optics, especially frequency mixing, underpins modern optical\ntechnology and scientific exploration in quantum optics, materials and life\nsciences, and optical communications. Since nonlinear effects are weak,\nefficient frequency mixing must accumulate over large interaction lengths\nrestricting the integration of nonlinear photonics with electronics and\nestablishing limitations on mixing processes due to the requirement of phase\nmatching. In this work we report efficient four-wave mixing over micron-scale\ninteraction lengths at telecoms wavelengths. We use an integrated plasmonic gap\nwaveguide on silicon that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic\npolymer in the gap. Our approach is so effective because the gap waveguide\nintensifies light by efficiently nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a\nfew tens of nanometres, generating a nonlinear response so strong that\nefficient four-wave mixing accumulates in just a micron. This is significant as\nour technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime where phase matching and\ndispersion considerations are relaxed, giving rise to the possibility of\ncompact, broadband, and efficient frequency mixing on a platform that can be\nintegrated with silicon photonics.\n", "  It is now well established that laser plasma acceleration (LPA) is an\ninnovative and good candidate in the beam acceleration field. Relativistic\nbeams are indeed produced up to several GeV but their quality remains to be\ndemonstrated in the highly demanding case of Free Electron Lasers (FELs).\nSeveral experiments already showed the feasibility of synchrotron radiation\ndelivery based on a LPA but free electron lasing has still to be achieved.\nSince the quality of the LPA beam inside the undulator is the critical issue,\nany LPA based FEL experiment requires a refined characterization of the beam\nproperties along the transport line and of the photon beam at the undulator\nexit. This characterization relies on diagnostics which must be adapted to the\nLPA specificities. We will review the electron and photon diagnostics already\nused on LPAs and required for LPA based FELs, and illustrate the critical\npoints using recent experiments performed around the world.\n", "  A theoretical and phenomenological consideration is given to higher order,\nstrong field effects in electron/laser interactions. A consistent strong field\ntheory is the Furry interaction picture of intense field quantum field theory.\nIn this theory, fermions are embedded in the strong laser field and the Volkov\nwavefunction solutions that result, are exact with respect to the strong field.\nWhen these Volkov fermions interact with individual photons from other sources,\nthe transition probability is enhanced in a series of resonances when the\nkinematics allow the virtual fermion to go on-shell. An experiment is proposed\nin which, for the first time, resonances could be used to generate high energy\nphotons from relativistic electrons at rates orders of magnitude in excess of\nusual mechanisms.\n", "  In a four-dimensional space, I shall construct all of the conformally\ninvariant scalar-tensor field theories, which are flat space compatible; i.e.,\nwell-defined and differentiable when evaluated for a flat metric tensor and\nconstant scalar field. It will be shown that all such field theories must be at\nmost of fourth-order in the derivatives of the field variables. The Lagrangian\nof any such field theory can be chosen to be a linear combination of four\nconformally invariant scalar-tensor Lagrangians, with the coefficients being\nfunctions of the scalar field. Three of these \"generating\" Lagrangians are of\nsecond-order, while one of of third-order. However, the third-order Lagrangian\ndiffers from a non-conformally invariant second-order Lagrangian by a\ndivergence. Consequently, all of the conformally invariant, flat space\ncompatible, scalar-tensor field theories, can be obtained from a second-order\nLagrangian.\n", "  Here we discuss the standard model extension in the presence of CPT-odd\nLorentz violation (LV) sector and of a deformed Heisenberg algebra that leads\nto a non-commutative theory with minimum length (ML). We derive the set of\nMaxwell equations emerging from this theory and considered the consequences\nwith respect to the usual effects of electromagnetic waves and material media.\nWe then considered the set of modified equations in material media and\ninvestigate the metamaterial behaviour as a consequence of LV and ML. We show\nthat a negative index refraction can be derived from the presence of a\nnon-commutativity suitably tuned by the $\\beta$ parameter, while in the\npresence of LV, we obtained the set of modified Maxwell equation in terms of\nthe corresponding material fields with terms depending explicitly from the\nterms of interaction between the material fields depending on non-commutativity\nwith the background field due to CPT-odd LV. We conclude that a new set of\nmetamaterials can be derived as a consequence of CPT-odd LV and\nnon-commutativity with minimum length.\n", "  According to astrophysical observations value of recession velocity in a\ncertain point is proportional to a distance to this point. The proportionality\ncoefficient is the Hubble constant measured with 5% accuracy. It is used in\nmany cosmological theories describing dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and\ntheir relation with the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein.\n  In the present work we have determined a limit value of the global Hubble\nconstant (in a big distance from a point of observations) theoretically without\nusing any empirical constants on the base of our own fractal model used for the\ndescription a relation between distance to an observed galaxy and coordinate of\nits center. The distance has been defined as a nonlinear fractal measure with\nscale of measurement corresponding to a deviation of the measure from its fixed\nvalue (zero-gravity radius). We have suggested a model of specific anisotropic\nfractal for simulation a radial Universe expansion. Our theoretical results\nhave shown existence of an inverse proportionality between accuracy of\ndetermination the Hubble constant and accuracy of calculation a coordinates of\ngalaxies leading to ambiguity results obtained at cosmological observations.\n", "  The project involved the development of a precision radioactive\nSource-Positioning System to enable the absolute characterization of a\ngamma-ray Detector-Development Platform at the Division of Nuclear Physics at\nLund University in conjunction with the Detector Group of the European\nSpallation Source. The gamma-ray radiation associated with an\nactinide-Beryllium source was mapped using a cerium bromide scintillation\ncrystal coupled to photomultiplier tube at various relative source and detector\nconfigurations. The data obtained are used to determine the spatial and energy\nprofiles of the neutron/gamma-ray beams associated with the source. This will\nin turn enable the unfolding of detector responses via simulation toolkits such\nas Geant4 and may also facilitate the future design of a boron-carbide\nbeam-hardening sleeve.\n", "  A process based on the exactly solvable Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti model of\nheat conduction [J. Stat. Phys. 27 65 (1982)] is described whereby lattice\ncells share their energies among many identical degrees of freedom while, in\neach cell, only two of them are associated with energy exchanges connecting\nneighbouring cells. It is shown that, up to dimensional constants, the heat\nconductivity is half the interaction rate, regardless of the degrees of\nfreedom. Moreover, as this number becomes large, correlations between the\nenergy variables involved in the exchanges vanish. In this regime, the process\nthus boils down to the time-evolution of the local temperatures which is\nprescribed by the discrete heat equation.\n", "  Today 7.2 billion people inhabit the Earth and by 2050 this number will have\nrisen to around nine billion, of which about 70 percent will be living in\ncities. Hence, it is essential to understand drivers, dynamics, and impacts of\nthe human settlements development. A key component in this context is the\navailability of an up-to-date and spatially consistent map of the location and\ndistribution of human settlements. It is here that the Global Urban Footprint\n(GUF) raster map can make a valuable contribution. The new global GUF binary\nsettlement mask shows a so far unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.4 arcsec\n($\\sim12 m$) that provides - for the first time - a complete picture of the\nentirety of urban and rural settlements. The GUF has been derived by means of a\nfully automated processing framework - the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) -\nthat was used to analyze a global coverage of more than 180,000 TanDEM-X and\nTerraSAR-X radar images with 3m ground resolution collected in 2011-2012.\nVarious quality assessment studies to determine the absolute GUF accuracy based\non ground truth data on the one hand and the relative accuracies compared to\nestablished settlements maps on the other hand, clearly indicate the added\nvalue of the new global GUF layer, in particular with respect to the\nrepresentation of rural settlement patterns. Generally, the GUF layer achieves\nan overall absolute accuracy of about 85\\%, with observed minima around 65\\%\nand maxima around 98 \\%. The GUF will be provided open and free for any\nscientific use in the full resolution and for any non-profit (but also\nnon-scientific) use in a generalized version of 2.8 arcsec ($\\sim84m$).\nTherewith, the new GUF layer can be expected to break new ground with respect\nto the analysis of global urbanization and peri-urbanization patterns,\npopulation estimation or vulnerability assessment.\n", "  Let $H$ be a Schr\\\"odinger operator defined on a noncompact Riemannian\nmanifold $\\Omega$, and let $W\\in L^\\infty(\\Omega;\\mathbb{R})$. Suppose that the\noperator $H+W$ is critical in $\\Omega$, and let $\\varphi$ be the corresponding\nAgmon ground state. We prove that if $u$ is a generalized eigenfunction of $H$\nsatisfying $|u|\\leq \\varphi$ in $\\Omega$, then the corresponding eigenvalue is\nin the spectrum of $H$. The conclusion also holds true if for some $K\\Subset\n\\Omega$ the operator $H$ admits a positive solution in\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}=\\Omega\\setminus K$, and $|u|\\leq \\psi$ in $\\tilde{\\Omega}$,\nwhere $\\psi$ is a positive solution of minimal growth in a neighborhood of\ninfinity in $\\Omega$.\n  Under natural assumptions, this result holds true also in the context of\ninfinite graphs, and Dirichlet forms.\n", "  We have experimentally investigated a chaotic reverberation chamber in the\nregime of strong modal overlap ($1{<}d{<}150$) varying the opening as well as\nthe coupling strength $\\kappa$ of the two attached antennas. We find a good\nagreement with numerical distribution of the reflection $R=|S_{ii}|^2$ and\ntransmission $T=|S_{21}|^2$ obtained via the effective Hamiltonian formalism\nusing random matrix theory. The two parameters entering the numerics, $\\kappa$\nand the decay rate $\\tau$ were determined beforehand experimentally.\nAdditionally we verified the relation predicted by Schroeder and Kuttruff for\nacoustic rooms between the averaged frequency spacing of maximal transmission\n$\\langle\\delta f_{max}\\rangle$ and the decay rate.\n", "  Delay-coordinate maps have been widely used recently to study nonlinear\ndynamical systems, where there is only access to the time series of one of\ntheir variables. Here, we show how the partial control method can be applied in\nthis kind of framework in order to prevent undesirable situations for the\nsystem or even to reduce the variability of the observable time series\nassociated with it. The main advantage of this control method, is that it\nallows to control delay-coordinate maps even if the control applied is smaller\nthan the external disturbances present in the system. To illustrate how it\nworks, we have applied it to three well-known models in Nonlinear Dynamics with\ndifferent delays such as the two-dimensional cubic map, the standard map and\nthe three-dimensional hyperchaotic H\\'enon map. For the first time we show here\nhow hyperchaotic systems can be partially controlled.\n", "  Direct transport processes play an important role in wireless communications\nwhere an ideal setup uses microwave fields to establish reliable communication\nchannels between transmitter and receiver. But it is inherent to the problem\nthat one cannot fully control the environment. While the influence of a complex\nscattering surrounding can be very well described using Random Matrix Theory it\nis not always obvious how to combine this universal approach with concrete\ncommunication channels. In this work we present an approach introducing an\nenhanced path between two antennas to the Hamilton operator to account for a\nprototypical problem. In order to be able to describe the stability of wireless\nchip-to-chip communication, we analyze the transport properties and predict the\nstability of the transmission under increasing importance of the environment.\n", "  Analytic solutions of the quantum relativistic two-body problem are obtained\nfor an interaction potential modeled as a one-dimensional smooth square well.\nBoth stationary and moving pairs are considered and the limit of the\n{\\delta}-function interaction is studied in depth. Our result can be utilized\nfor understanding excitonic states in narrow-gap carbon nanotubes. We also show\nthe existence of bound states within the gap for a pair of particles of the\nsame charge.\n", "  A reversible handle on graphene carrier density, other than the gate electric\nfield, is desirable for memory applications of graphene. Our experiments show\nthat the commonly observed carrier density hysteresis in graphene on SiO$_2$\ndue to interface water/oxygen vanishes at temperatures below 250 K. The state\nof these species, which affects the graphene carrier density, at low\ntemperatures can be reversibly controlled by thermal cycling to room\ntemperature at different gate voltages. Further, devices prepared with\nrelatively dry interface, and thus showing negligible hysteresis at room\ntemperature, show a marked increase in hysteresis on heating above room\ntemperature. Thus thermal-cycling, to high temperatures and under gate-voltage,\nprovides a reversible handle on carrier density. These results are discussed in\nterms of temperature and interface-water density dependence of redox-reaction\nkinetics.\n", "  Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic\nevents in the solar system, impacting the near-Earth environment. Flare\nproductivity is empirically known to be correlated with the size and complexity\nof active regions. Several indicators, based on magnetic-field data from active\nregions, have been tested for flare forecasting in recent years. None of these\nindicators, or combinations thereof, have yet demonstrated an unambiguous\neruption or flare criterion. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been only\nbarely used to test the predictability of these parameters. In this context, we\nused the 3D parametric MHD numerical simulations of the self-consistent\nformation of the flux emergence of a twisted flux tube, inducing the formation\nof stable and unstable magnetic flux ropes of Leake (2013, 2014). We use these\nnumerical simulations to investigate the eruptive signatures observable in\nvarious magnetic scalar parameters and provide highlights on data analysis\nprocessing. Time series of 2D photospheric-like magnetograms are used from\nparametric simulations of stable and unstable flux emergence, to compute a list\nof about 100 different indicators. This list includes parameters previously\nused for operational forecasting, physical parameters used for the first time,\nas well as new quantities specifically developed for this purpose. Our results\nindicate that only parameters measuring the total non-potentiality of active\nregions associated with magnetic inversion line properties, such as the\nFalconer parameters $L_{ss}$, $WL_{ss}$, $L_{sg}$ and $WL_{sg}$, as well as the\nnew current integral $WL_{sc}$ and length $L_{sc}$ parameters, present a\nsignificant ability to distinguish the eruptive cases of the model from the\nnon-eruptive cases, possibly indicating that they are promising flare and\neruption predictors.\n", "  We decorate the one-dimensional conic oscillator $\\frac{1}{2}\n\\left[-\\frac{d^{2} }{dx^{2} } + \\left|x \\right| \\right]$ with a point impurity\nof either $\\delta$-type, or local $\\delta'$-type or even nonlocal\n$\\delta'$-type. All the three cases are exactly solvable models, which are\nexplicitly solved and analysed, as a first step towards higher dimensional\nmodels of physical relevance. We analyse the behaviour of the change in the\nenergy levels when an interaction of the type $-\\lambda\\,\\delta(x)$ or\n$-\\lambda\\,\\delta(x-x_0)$ is switched on. In the first case, even energy levels\n(pertaining to antisymmetric bound states) remain invariant with $\\lambda$\nalthough odd energy levels (pertaining to symmetric bound states) decrease as\n$\\lambda$ increases. In the second, all energy levels decrease when the form\nfactor $\\lambda$ increases. A similar study has been performed for the so\ncalled nonlocal $\\delta'$ interaction, requiring a coupling constant\nrenormalization, which implies the replacement of the form factor $\\lambda$ by\na renormalized form factor $\\beta$. In terms of $\\beta$, even energy levels are\nunchanged. However, we show the existence of level crossings: after a fixed\nvalue of $\\beta$ the energy of each odd level, with the natural exception of\nthe first one, becomes lower than the constant energy of the previous even\nlevel. Finally, we consider an interaction of the type\n$-a\\delta(x)+b\\delta'(x)$, and analyse in detail the discrete spectrum of the\nresulting self-adjoint Hamiltonian.\n", "  State-of-the-art technology for pulse counter electronics offers an important\nrange of commercial devices, but such systems are usually expensive due to the\ncomplex logic used for this task. The use of counting electronics in\nconjunction with photon counters can be used, for example, to perform\nexperimental tests in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Science. Here, we\npresent the development and implementation of a low cost module for multiphoton\ncoincidence statistics with detection windows of a few nanoseconds. The module\nconsists of an array of logic gates, with a frequency operation of 250 MHz that\ncorrects and amplifies the detectors signal. The device characterisation was\ndone by means of detection of Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) signals\nretrieved from a signal generator, and implemented in an optical setup. The\ndetected output signals (TTL pulses) were analysed and stored in a computer by\nmeans of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our module incorporates\nfundamental electronics that is currently used in the first experimental\nproof-of-principle tests in quantum information and molecular spectroscopy at\nCIBioFi.\n", "  The presence of a radio halo in the massive, merging cluster Abell 3667 has\nrecently become a focus of debate in the literature following a putative halo\ndetection at 2.4 GHz despite a lack of detection at a range of lower\nfrequencies between 120 MHz and 1.8 GHz. Here we develop a new method to place\nlimits on radio haloes via generation of a realistic synthetic halo based on\nthe brightness distribution of real haloes. The model generated extends on\nprevious methods in the literature producing a single elliptical halo model,\ncapable of being injected into mosaic as well as single observations. Applying\nthis model to the deepest data available 1.4 GHz data for A3667 we derive an\nupper limit halo power of P$_{1.4} \\leq 5.55 \\times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We\ndiscuss the result in the context of current scaling relation between the X-ray\nand radio properties of galaxy clusters and find that the lack of a halo in\nA3667 places the cluster on the border of the so-called `off-state' region in\nwhich clusters are expected not to host any diffuse emission.\n", "  High-resolution wide field-of-view (FOV) microscopic imaging plays an\nessential role in various fields of biomedicine, engineering, and physical\nsciences. As an alternative to conventional lens-based scanning techniques,\nlensfree holography provides a new way to effectively bypass the intrinsical\ntrade-off between the spatial resolution and FOV of conventional microscopes.\nUnfortunately, due to the limited sensor pixel-size, unpredictable disturbance\nduring image acquisition, and sub-optimum solution to the phase retrieval\nproblem, typical lensfree microscopes only produce compromised imaging quality\nin terms of lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we\npropose an adaptive pixel-super-resolved lensfree imaging (APLI) method which\ncan solve, or at least partially alleviate these limitations. Our approach\naddresses the pixel aliasing problem by Z-scanning only, without resorting to\nsubpixel shifting or beam-angle manipulation. Automatic positional error\ncorrection algorithm and adaptive relaxation strategy are introduced to enhance\nthe robustness and SNR of reconstruction significantly. Based on APLI, we\nperform full-FOV reconstruction of a USAF resolution target ($\\sim$29.85\n$m{m^2}$) and achieve half-pitch lateral resolution of 770 $nm$, surpassing\n2.17 times of the theoretical Nyquist-Shannon sampling resolution limit imposed\nby the sensor pixel-size (1.67 $\\mu m$). Full-FOV imaging result of a typical\ndicot root is also provided to demonstrate its promising potential applications\nin biologic imaging.\n", "  Short-length fiber lasers are key elements for device integration in fiber\nsystems. However, efficiently absorbing a pump beam in a short ion-doped fiber\nremains a challenge. We present an approach that renders a weakly absorbing\nshort-length Er-doped fiber completely absorbing. We exploit the concept of\ncoherent perfect absorption, whereby two appropriately designed fiber Bragg\ngratings define a short-length cavity that enforces complete absorption of an\nincident wave on resonance independently of the fiber intrinsic absorption.\nThis approach applies to any spectral window and may lead to efficient\nsingle-longitudinal-mode fiber lasers for applications in optical\ncommunication, sensing, and metrology.\n", "  If two quantum players at a nonlocal game G achieve a superclassical score,\nthen their measurement outcomes must be at least partially random from the\nperspective of any third player. This is the basis for device-independent\nquantum cryptography. In this paper we address a related question: does a\nsuperclassical score at G guarantee that one player has created randomness from\nthe perspective of the other player? We show that for complete-support games,\nthe answer is yes: even if the second player is given the first player's input\nat the conclusion of the game, he cannot perfectly recover her output. Thus\nsome amount of local randomness (i.e., randomness possessed by only one player)\nis always obtained when randomness is certified from nonlocal games with\nquantum strategies. This is in contrast to non-signaling game strategies, which\nmay produce global randomness without any local randomness. We discuss\npotential implications for cryptographic protocols between mistrustful parties.\n", "  We perform the first quantitative study of the sensitivity of Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis to variations in isospin breaking with precise input from\nlattice QCD calculations. The predicted light nuclear abundances are most\nsensitive to the neutron-proton mass splitting as both the initial relative\nabundance of neutrons to protons and the $n \\rightleftharpoons p$ weak reaction\nrates are very sensitive to this quantity. Lattice QCD has been used to\ndetermine this mass splitting to greater than 5-sigma, including contributions\nfrom both the down-quark up-quark mass splitting, $2\\delta = m_d-m_u$ and from\nelectromagnetic coupling of the quarks to the photons with a strength governed\nby the fine structure constant, $\\alpha_{fs}$. At leading order in isospin\nbreaking, the contribution of $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ to $M_n-M_p$ and the\nnuclear reaction rates can be varied independently. We use this knowledge and\ninput from lattice QCD to quantitatively study variations of the predicted\nlight nuclear abundances as $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ are varied. The change\nin the D and ${}^4$He abundances individually allow for potentially large\nsimultaneous variations in $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ while maintaining\nconsistency with the observed abundances, however the combined comparison\nrestricts variations in these sources of isospin breaking to less than\n$\\lesssim1.25\\%$ at the 3-sigma confidence level. This sensitivity can be used\nto place tight constraints on prospective beyond the Standard Model theories\nthat would modify these isospin breaking effects in the primordial Universe.\n"]}
