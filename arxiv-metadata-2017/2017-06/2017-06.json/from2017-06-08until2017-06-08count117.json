In a general part, we\ndiscuss useful theorems concerning group structure, conjugacy classes,\nrepresentations and character tables. In a specialized part, we attempt to give\na fairly comprehensive review of finite subgroups of SO(3) and SU(3), in which\nwe apply and illustrate the general theory. Moreover, we also provide a concise\ndescription of the symmetric and alternating groups and comment on the\nrelationship between finite subgroups of U(3) and finite subgroups of SU(3).\nThough in this review we give a detailed description of a wide range of finite\ngroups, the main focus is on the methods which allow the exploration of their\ndifferent aspects.\n", "  We consider random Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators on $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ when\nthe distribution of single site potentials is $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder continuous\n($0<\\alpha\\leq 1$). In localized regime we study the distribution of\neigenfunctions simultaneously in space and energy. In a certain scaling limit\nwe prove limits point are Poisson.\n", "  This paper studies the problem of designing networks of nonidentical coupled\noscillators in order to achieve a desired level of phase cohesiveness, defined\nas the maximum asymptotic phase difference across the edges of the network. In\nparticular, we consider the following two design problems: (i) the\nnodal-frequency design problem, in which we tune the natural frequencies of the\noscillators given the topology of the network, and (ii) the (robust)\nedge-weight design problem, in which we design the edge weights assuming that\nthe natural frequencies are given (or belong to a given convex uncertainty\nset). For both problems, we optimize an objective function of the design\nvariables while considering a desired level of phase cohesiveness as our design\nconstraint. This constraint defines a convex set in the nodal-frequency design\nproblem. In contrast, in the edge-weight design problem, the phase cohesiveness\nconstraint yields a non-convex set, unless the underlying network is either a\ntree or an arbitrary graph with identical edge weights. We then propose a\nconvex semidefinite relaxation to approximately solve the (non-convex)\nedge-weight design problem for general (possibly cyclic) networks with\nnonidentical edge weights. We illustrate the applicability of our results by\nanalyzing several network design problems of practical interest, such as power\nre-dispatch in power grids, sparse network design, (robust) network design for\ndistributed wireless analog clocks, and the detection of edges leading to the\nBraess' paradox in power grids.\n", "  Next-generation concepts for solid-state memory devices are based on\ncurrent-driven domain wall propagation, where the wall velocity governs the\ndevice performance. It has been shown that the domain wall velocity and the\ndirection of travel is controlled by the nature of the wall and its chirality.\nThis chirality is attributed to effects emerging from the lack of inversion\nsymmetry at the interface between a ferromagnet and a heavy metal, leading to\nan interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that can control the shape and\nchirality of the magnetic domain wall. Here we present direct imaging of domain\nwalls in Pt/Co/AlO$_x$ films using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy,\ndemonstrating the presence of homochiral, and thus topologically protected,\nN\\'{e}el walls. Such domain walls are good candidates for dense data storage,\nbringing the bit size down close to the limit of the domain wall width.\n", "  Massive stars are usually found in binaries, and binaries with periods less\nthan 10 days may have a preference for near equal component masses. In this\npaper we investigate the evolution of these binaries all the way to contact and\nthe possibility that these systems can be progenitors of double neutron star\nbinaries. The small orbital separations of observed double neutron star\nbinaries suggest that the progenitor systems underwent a common envelope phase\nat least once during their evolution. Bethe & Brown (1998) proposed that\nmassive binary twins will undergo a common envelope evolution while both\ncomponents are ascending the red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch\nsimultaneously, also known as double-core evolution. Using models generated\nfrom the stellar evolution code Evolve Zero Age Main Sequence, we determine the\nrange of mass ratios resulting in both components simultaneously ascending the\nRGB or AGB as a function of the difference in birth times, t. We find that,\neven for a generous t=5 Myr, the minimum mass ratio qmin=0.933 for an 8 Solar\nMass primary and increases for larger primaries. We use a hydrodynamics code,\nStarSmasher, to study specifically the evolution of q=1 common envelope systems\nas a function of initial component mass, age, and orbital separation. We find\nthe dynamical stability limit, the largest orbital separation where the binary\nbecomes dynamically unstable, as a function of the component mass and age.\nFinally, we calculate the efficiency of ejecting matter during the inspiral\nphase to extrapolate the properties of the remnant binary from our numerical\nresults, assuming the common envelope is completely ejected. We find that for\nthe nominal core masses, there is a minimum orbital separation for a given\ncomponent mass such that the helium cores survive common envelope evolution in\na tightly bound binary and are viable progenitors for double neutron stars.\n", "  Low-level \"adaptive\" and higher-level \"sophisticated\" human reasoning\nprocesses have been proposed to play opposing roles in the emergence of\nunpredictable collective behaviors like crowd panics, traffic jams, and market\nbubbles. While adaptive processes are ubiquitous in mechanistic theories of\nemergent social complexity, complementary theories understand incentives,\neducation, and other inducements to rationality as able to suppress such\noutcomes.\n  We show in a series of laboratory experiments that, rather than suppressing\ncomplex social dynamics, sophisticated reasoning processes can support them.\nOur experiments elicit flocking behavior in groups and show that it is driven\nby the human ability to recursively anticipate the reasoning of others. We\nidentify this sophisticated flocking in three different games---the Beauty\nPageant, Mod Game, and Runway Game---across which game theory predicts no\nformal similarity. The persistence of sophisticated flocking across unrelated\ngame types not only speaks to the phenomenon's robustness, it also suggests\nthat people are treating three supposedly different decision settings as\nconceptually similar, implicating a second sophisticated cognitive ability:\nhuman concept formation. We also find in participants' underlying reasoning\nthat the number of recursions they perform is limited not by any individual's\ncognitive abilities, but by a social norm that emerges during flocking.\n  By implicating both recursive reasoning and concept formation in complex\ndynamics, we support interdisciplinary perspectives that emergent complexity is\ntypical of even the most intelligent populations and carefully designed social\nsystems.\n", "  Gauge theories in the presence of codimension two vortex defects are known to\nbe related to the theories on orbifolds. By using this relation we study the\nlocalized path integrals of 2D N=(2,2) SUSY gauge theories with point-like\nvortex defects. We present a formula for the correlation functions of vortex\ndefects inserted at the north and the south poles of squashed spheres. For\nAbelian gauge theories the correlators are locally constant as functions of the\nparameters of the defect, but exhibit discontinuity at some threshold values\ndetermined by the deficit angle at the poles and the R-charges of the matter\nmultiplets. For non-Abelian gauge groups the correlators depend non-trivially\non the types of gauge symmetry breaking due to the defects.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic response of two- and quasi-two-dimensional\nhyperbolic materials, on which a simple dipole source can excite a\nwell-confined and tunable surface plasmon polariton (SPP). The analysis is\nbased on the Green's function for an anisotropic two-dimensional surface, which\nnominally requires the evaluation of a two-dimensional Sommerfeld integral. We\nshow that for the SPP contribution this integral can be evaluated efficiently\nin a mixed continuous-discrete form as a continuous spectrum contribution\n(branch cut integral) of a residue term, in distinction to the isotropic case,\nwhere the SPP is simply given as a discrete residue term. The regime of strong\nSPP excitation is discussed, and complex-plane singularities are identified,\nleading to physical insight into the excited SPP. We also present a stationary\nphase solution valid for large radial distances. Examples are presented using\ngraphene strips to form a hyperbolic metasurface, and thin-film black\nphosphorus. The Green's function and complex-plane analysis developed allows\nfor the exploration of hyperbolic plasmons in general 2D materials.\n", "  Pseudo-Newtonian potentials are a tool often used in theoretical astrophysics\nto capture some key features of a black-hole space-time in a Newtonian\nframework. As a result, one can use Newtonian numerical codes, and Newtonian\nformalism in general, in an effective description of important astrophysical\nprocesses such as accretion onto black holes.\n  In this paper we develop a general pseudo-Newtonian formalism which pertains\nto the motion of particles, light, and fluids in stationary space-times. In\nreturn, we are able to assess the applicability of the pseudo-Newtonian scheme.\nThe simplest and most elegant formulas are obtained in space-times without\ngravitomagnetic effects, such as the Schwarzschild rather than the Kerr\nspace-time; the quantitative errors are smallest for motion with low binding\nenergy. Included is a ready-to-use set of fluid equations in Schwarzschild\nspace-time in Cartesian and radial coordinates.\n", "  The organization of live cells to tissues is associated with the mechanical\ninteraction between cells, which is mediated through their elastic environment.\nWe model cells as spherical active force dipoles surrounded by an infinite\nelastic matrix, and analytically evaluate the interaction energy for different\nscenarios of their regulatory behavior. We obtain attraction for homeostatic\n(set point) forces and repulsion for homeostatic displacements. When the\ntranslational motion of the cells is regulated, the interaction energy decays\nwith distance as $1/d^4$, while when it is not regulated the energy decays as\n$1/d^6$. This arises from the same reasons as the van der Waals interaction\nbetween induced electric dipoles.\n", "  We investigate a three-dimensional kinetically-constrained model that\nexhibits two types of phase transitions at different densities. At the jamming\ndensity $ \\rho_J $ there is a mixed-order phase transition in which a finite\nfraction of the particles become frozen, but the other particles may still\ndiffuse throughout the system. At the caging density $ \\rho_C > \\rho_J $, the\nmobile particles are trapped in finite cages and no longer diffuse. The caging\ntransition occurs due to a percolation transition of the unfrozen sites, and we\nnumerically find that it is a continuous transition with the same critical\nexponents as random percolation.\n", "  It is well known that in general theories of gravity with the diffeomorphism\nsymmetry, the black hole entropy is a Noether charge. But what will happen if\nthe symmetry is explicitly broken? By investigating the covariant first law of\nblack hole mechanics with background fields, we show that the Noether entropy\nis still applicable due to the local nature of the black hole entropy.\nMoreover, motivated by the proposal that the cosmological constant behaves as a\nthermodynamic variable, we allow the non-dynamical background fields to be\nvaried. To illustrate this general formalism, we study a generic static black\nbrane in the massive gravity. Using the first law and the scaling argument, we\nobtain two Smarr formulas. We show that both of them can be retrieved without\nrelying on the first law, hence providing a self-consistent check of the\ntheory.\n", "  We have investigated the one-way surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the\ninterface of a continuous magneto-plasma material and metal. We demonstrated\nthat TM modes inside a continuous material can be assigned non-trivial Chern\nnumbers analogous to those of topological photonic crystals; moreover these\nChern numbers can be calculated analytically. This leads to the appearance of\ntopologically protected surface modes propagating at frequencies inside the\nbandgap of the magneto-plasma. Previous works considered 2D structures; here we\nconsider the effects of 3D defects, and show that, although backward\npropagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take place and it has\nsignificant effect on the propagation of the surface mode. Several different\nwaveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of\nside-scattering, and we also consider the effects of metal loss.\n", "  One of the most difficult problems in quantum mechanics is the analysis of\nthe measurement processes. In this paper, we point out that many of these\ndifficulties originate from the different roles of measurement outcomes and\nobservable quantities, which cannot simply be identified with each other. Our\nanalysis shows that the Hilbert space formalism itself describes a fundamental\nseparation between quantitative properties and qualitative outcomes that needs\nto be taken into account in an objective description of quantum measurements.\nWe derive fundamental relations between the statistics of measurement outcomes\nand the values of physical quantities that explain how the objective properties\nof a quantum system appear in the context of different measurement\ninteractions. Our results indicate that non-classical correlations can be\nunderstood in terms of the actual role of physical properties as quantifiable\ncauses of the external effects observed in a quantum measurement.\n", "  As the 2015 results of Plancks mission have recently been made available, it\nis interesting to check the evolution of the scale factor and of the Hubble\nparameter in the light of these results. Two models in line with Einsteins\nfield equations and with the hot big bang scenario for a flat Universe are used\nto allow a comparison : (1) the classical one using density parameters for\nmatter content (baryonic and dark matter) and dark energy ; (2) an alternative\nmodel, already used in the past, and assuming the Hubble parameter to contain a\nterm constant in time. Both models are coherent with each other except for some\ndiscrepancy about the density, which can be ascribed to the different\nhypotheses made. This opens a way for further interpretation of the origin of\ndark energy.\n", "  A semiconductor quintuple quantum dot with two charge sensors and an\nadditional contact to the center dot from an electron reservoir is fabricated\nto demonstrate the concept of scalable architecture. This design enables\nformation of the five dots as confirmed by measurements of the charge states of\nthe three nearest dots to the respective charge sensor. The gate performance of\nthe measured stability diagram is well reproduced by a capacitance model.These\nresults provide an important step towards realizing controllable large scale\nmultiple quantum dot systems.\n", "  We suggest to use the state $Y(4630)$, which decays predominantly to\n$\\Lambda_c\\bar\\Lambda_c$, as a window to the landscape of tetraquarks. We\npropose a simple criterion to decide whether a state is a genuine stringy\nexotic hadron - a tetraquark - or a \"molecule\". If it is the former it should\nbe on a (modified) Regge trajectory. We present the predictions of the mass and\nwidth of the higher excited states on the $Y(4630)$ trajectory. We argue that\nthere should exist an analogous \"$Y_b$\" state that decays to\n$\\Lambda_b\\bar\\Lambda_b$ and describe its trajectory. We conjecture also a\nsimilar trajectory for tetraquarks containing strange quarks, and the modified\nRegge trajectories can in fact be predicted for any resonances found decaying\nto a baryon-antibaryon pair. En route to the results regarding tetraquarks, we\nalso make some additional predictions on higher excited charmonium states. We\nbriefly discuss the zoo of exotic stringy hadrons and in particular we sketch\nall the possibilities of tetraquark states.\n", "  We explore the recently discovered solution of the driven Tavis-Cummings\nmodel (DTCM). It describes interaction of arbitrary number of two-level systems\nwith a bosonic mode that has linearly time-dependent frequency. We derive\ncompact and tractable expressions for transition probabilities in terms of the\nwell known special functions. In the new form, our formulas are suitable for\nfast numerical calculations and analytical approximations. As an application,\nwe obtain the semiclassical limit of the exact solution and compare it to prior\napproximations. We also reveal connection between DTCM and $q$-deformed\nbinomial statistics.\n", "  $ \\newcommand{\\eps}{\\varepsilon} $In learning theory, the VC dimension of a\nconcept class $C$ is the most common way to measure its \"richness.\" In the PAC\nmodel $$ \\Theta\\Big(\\frac{d}{\\eps} + \\frac{\\log(1/\\delta)}{\\eps}\\Big) $$\nexamples are necessary and sufficient for a learner to output, with probability\n$1-\\delta$, a hypothesis $h$ that is $\\eps$-close to the target concept $c$. In\nthe related agnostic model, where the samples need not come from a $c\\in C$, we\nknow that $$ \\Theta\\Big(\\frac{d}{\\eps^2} + \\frac{\\log(1/\\delta)}{\\eps^2}\\Big)\n$$ examples are necessary and sufficient to output an hypothesis $h\\in C$ whose\nerror is at most $\\eps$ worse than the best concept in $C$.\n  Here we analyze quantum sample complexity, where each example is a coherent\nquantum state. This model was introduced by Bshouty and Jackson, who showed\nthat quantum examples are more powerful than classical examples in some\nfixed-distribution settings. However, Atici and Servedio, improved by Zhang,\nshowed that in the PAC setting, quantum examples cannot be much more powerful:\nthe required number of quantum examples is $$\n\\Omega\\Big(\\frac{d^{1-\\eta}}{\\eps} + d + \\frac{\\log(1/\\delta)}{\\eps}\\Big)\\mbox{\nfor all }\\eta> 0. $$ Our main result is that quantum and classical sample\ncomplexity are in fact equal up to constant factors in both the PAC and\nagnostic models. We give two approaches. The first is a fairly simple\ninformation-theoretic argument that yields the above two classical bounds and\nyields the same bounds for quantum sample complexity up to a $\\log(d/\\eps)$\nfactor. We then give a second approach that avoids the log-factor loss, based\non analyzing the behavior of the \"Pretty Good Measurement\" on the quantum state\nidentification problems that correspond to learning. This shows classical and\nquantum sample complexity are equal up to constant factors.\n", "  We propose a way of formation of thin bilayer Pt$_3$Si/Pt$_2$Si films at room\ntemperature on poly-Si substrates by Pt magnetron sputtering and wet etching,\nobtain such film, investigate its structure and phase composition and estimate\nthe thickness of its layers. We verify by direct x-ray\nphotoelectron-spectroscopic measurements our previous observation of the\nPt$_2$Si layer formaton between Pt and poly-Si films as a result of Pt\nmagnetron sputtering at room temperature. This layer likely appears due to high\nenough temperature of Pt ions in the magnetron plasma sufficient for chemical\nreaction of the silicide film formation on the Si surface. The Pt$_3$Si layer\nlikely forms from the Pt--Pt$_3$Si layer (Pt$_{95}$Si$_5$), which arises under\nPt film during the magnetron sputtering, as a result of Pt removal by wet\netching.\n", "  We study the effect of a nearby planar wall on the propulsion of a spherical\nphoretic micro-swimmer driven by reactions on its surface. An asymmetric\ncoverage of catalysts on its surface which absorb reactants and generate\nproducts gives rise to an anisotropic interfacial flow that propels the\nswimmer. We analyse the near-wall dynamics of such a self-phoretic swimmer as a\nfunction of the asymmetric catalytic coverage of the surface. By an analysis of\nthe fundamental singularities of the flow and concentration or electrostatic\npotential gradients generated we are able to obtain and rationalise a phase\ndiagram of behaviours as a function of the characteristics of the swimmer\nsurface. We find a variety of possible behaviours, from \"bound states\" where\nthe swimmer remains near the wall to \"scattering\" or repulsive trajectories in\nwhich the swimmer ends far from the wall. The formation of some of the bound\nstates is a purely wall-phoretic effect and cannot be obtained by simply\nmapping a phoretic swimmer to a hydrodynamic one.\n", "  We use random matrix theory to study the spectrum of random geometric graphs,\na fundamental model of spatial networks. Considering ensembles of random\ngeometric graphs we look at short range correlations in the level spacings of\nthe spectrum via the nearest neighbour and next nearest neighbour spacing\ndistribution and long range correlations via the spectral rigidity Delta_3\nstatistic. These correlations in the level spacings give information about\nlocalisation of eigenvectors, level of community structure and the level of\nrandomness within the networks. We find a parameter dependent transition\nbetween Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics. That is the\nspectral statistics of spatial random geometric graphs fits the universality of\nrandom matrix theory found in other models such as Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert\nand Watts-Strogatz random graph.\n", "  We describe a compact and reliable method to calculate the Fisher information\nfor the estimation of a dynamical parameter in a continuously measured linear\nGaussian quantum system. Unlike previous methods in the literature, which\ninvolve the numerical integration of a stochastic master equation for the\ncorresponding density operator in a Hilbert space of infinite dimension, the\nformulas here derived depends only on the evolution of first and second moments\nof the quantum states, and thus can be easily evaluated without the need of any\napproximation. We also present some basic but physically meaningful examples\nwhere this result is exploited, calculating analytical and numerical bounds on\nthe estimation of the squeezing parameter for a quantum parametric amplifier,\nand of a constant force acting on a mechanical oscillator in a standard\noptomechanical scenario.\n", "  Within the Standard Model, the weak interaction of quarks and leptons is\ncharacterized by certain symmetry properties, such as maximal breaking of\nparity and favored helicity. These are related to the $V-A$ structure of the\nweak interaction. These characteristics were discovered by studying\ncorrelations in the directions of the outgoing leptons in nuclear beta decays.\nThese days, correlation measurements in nuclear beta decays are intensively\nstudied to probe for signatures for deviations from these symmetries, which are\nan indication of Beyond Standard Model physics. We show that the structure of\nthe energy spectrum of emitted electrons in unique first-forbidden\n$\\beta$-decays is sensitive to the symmetries of the weak interaction, and thus\ncan be used as a novel probe of physics beyond the standard model. Furthermore,\nthe energy spectrum gives constraints both in the case of right and left\ncoupling of the new symmetry currents. We show that a measurement with modest\nenergy resolution of about 20 keV is expected to lead to new constraints on\nbeyond the standard model interactions with tensor symmetry.\n", "  On-chip optical resonators have the promise of revolutionizing numerous\nfields including metrology and sensing; however, their optical losses have\nalways lagged behind their larger discrete resonator counterparts based on\ncrystalline materials and flowable glass. Silicon nitride (Si3N4) ring\nresonators open up capabilities for optical routing, frequency comb generation,\noptical clocks and high precision sensing on an integrated platform. However,\nsimultaneously achieving high quality factor and high confinement in Si3N4\n(critical for nonlinear processes for example) remains a challenge. Here, we\nshow that addressing surface roughness enables us to overcome the loss\nlimitations and achieve high-confinement, on-chip ring resonators with a\nquality factor (Q) of 37 million for a ring with 2.5 {\\mu}m width and 67\nmillion for a ring with 10 {\\mu}m width. We show a clear systematic path for\nachieving these high quality factors. Furthermore, we extract the loss limited\nby the material absorption in our films to be 0.13 dB/m, which corresponds to\nan absorption limited Q of at least 170 million by comparing two resonators\nwith different degrees of confinement. Our work provides a chip-scale platform\nfor applications such as ultra-low power frequency comb generation, high\nprecision sensing, laser stabilization and sideband resolved optomechanics.\n", "  We use dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) at liquid helium temperatures to directly detect hydrogen attached to the\nsurface of silicon microparticles. The proton NMR spectrum from a dry sample of\npolycrystalline silicon powder (1-5 $\\mu$m) shows a distinctively narrow\nLorentzian-shaped resonance with a width of 6.2 kHz, indicative of a very\nsparse distribution of protons attached to the silicon surface. These protons\nare within a few atomic monolayers of the silicon surface. The high sensitivity\nNMR detection of surface protons from low surface area ($0.26 - 1.3 \\: m^2/g$)\nparticles is enabled by an overall signal enhancement of 4150 over the room\ntemperature NMR signal at the same field. When the particles were suspended in\na solvent with 80% H2O and 20% D2O, the narrow peak was observed to grow in\nintensity over time, indicating growth of the sparse surface proton layer.\nHowever, when the particles were suspended in a solvent with 20% H2O and 80%\nD2O, the narrow bound-proton peak was observed to shrink due to exchange\nbetween the surface protons and the deuterium in solution. This decrease was\naccompanied by a concomitant growth in the intensity of the frozen solvent\npeak, as the relative proton concentration of the solvent increased. When the\nparticles were suspended in the organic solvent hexane, the proton NMR spectra\nremained unchanged over time. These results are consistent with the known\nchemisorption of water on the silicon surface resulting in the formation of\nhydride and hydroxyl species. Low-temperature DNP NMR can thus be used as a\nnon-destructive probe of surface corrosion for silicon in aqueous environments.\nThis is important in the context of using silicon MEMS and bioMEMS devices in\nsuch environments, for silicon micro- and nano-particle MRI imaging agents, and\nthe use of nanosilicon for splitting water in fuel cells.\n", "  We present a model of the analog geometry in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nflow. For the MHD flow with magnetic pressure-dominated and gas\npressure-dominated conditions, we obtain the magnetoacoustic metric for the\nfast MHD mode. For the slow MHD mode, on the other hand, the wave is governed\nby the advective-type equation without an isotropic dispersion term. Thus, the\n\"distance\" perpendicular to the wave propagation is not defined and the\nmagnetoacoustic metric cannot be introduced. To investigate the properties of\nthe magnetoacoustic geometry for the fast mode, we prepare a two-dimensional\naxisymmetric inflow and examine the behavior of magnetoacoustic rays which is a\ncounterpart of the MHD waves in the eikonal limit. We find that the\nmagnetoacoustic geometry is classified into three types depending on two\nparameters characterizing the background flow:~analog spacetimes of rotating\nblack holes, ultra spinning stars with ergoregions, and spinning stars without\nergoregions. We address the effects of the magnetic pressure on the effective\ngeometries.\n", "  This article outlines sufficient conditions under which a one-dimensional\nchain of identical nonlinear oscillators can display complex spatio-temporal\nbehavior. The units are described by phase equations and consist of excitable\noscillators. The interactions are local and the network is poised to a critical\nstate by balancing excitation and inhibition locally. The results presented\nhere suggest that in networks composed of many oscillatory units with local\ninteractions, excitability together with balanced interactions are sufficient\nto give rise to complex emergent features. For values of the parameters where\ncomplex behavior occurs, the system also displays a high-dimensional\nbifurcation where an exponentially large number of equilibria are borne in\npairs out of multiple saddle-node bifurcations.\n", "  The Materials Project crystal structure database has been searched for\nmaterials possessing layered motifs in their crystal structures using a\ntopology-scaling algorithm. The algorithm identifies and measures the sizes of\nbonded atomic clusters in a structure's unit cell, and determines their scaling\nwith cell size. The search yielded 826 stable layered materials, which are\nconsidered as candidates for the formation of two-dimensional monolayers via\nexfoliation. Density-functional theory calculates the exfoliation energy of\neach material and 681 monolayers are found to exhibit exfoliation energies\nbelow those of certain already-extant two-dimensional materials, indicating the\npossibility of exfoliating them from bulk phases. The crystal structures of\nthese two-dimensional materials provide templates for future theoretical\nsearches of stable two-dimensional materials. The optimized structures and\nother data for all 826 monolayers are provided at https://materialsweb.org .\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are textures behaving as quasiparticles which are\ntopologically different from other states. Their discovery in systems with\nbroken inversion symmetry sparked the search for materials containing such\nmagnetic phase at room temperature. Their topological properties combined with\nthe chirality-related spin-orbit torques make them interesting objects to\ncontrol the magnetization at nanoscale. Here we show that a pair of coupled\nskyrmions with the same topological charge and opposite chiralities can be\nstabilized in a symmetric magnetic bilayer system by combining\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and dipolar coupling effects. This\neffect opens a new path for skyrmion stabilization with much lower DMI. We then\ndemonstrate in a single device with two different electrodes that such\nskyrmions can be efficiently and independently written and shifted by electric\ncurrent at large velocities. The skyrmionic nature of the observed\nquasiparticles is further confirmed by using the gyrotropic force as a\ntopological filter. These results set the ground for emerging spintronic\ntechnologies where issues concerning skyrmion stability, nucleation, and\npropagation are paramount.\n", "  The properties that quantify photonic topological insulators (PTIs), Berry\nphase, Berry connection, and Chern number, are typically obtained by making\nanalogies between classical Maxwell's equations and the quantum mechanical\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, writing both in Hamiltonian form. However, the\naforementioned quantities are not necessarily quantum in nature, and for\nphotonic systems they can be explained using only classical concepts. Here we\nprovide a derivation and description of PTI quantities using classical\nMaxwell's equations, we demonstrate how an electromagnetic mode can acquire\nBerry phase, and we discuss the ramifications of this effect. We consider\nseveral examples, including wave propagation in a biased plasma, and radiation\nby a rotating isotropic emitter. These concepts are discussed without invoking\nquantum mechanics, and can be easily understood from an engineering\nelectromagnetics perspective.\n", "  We investigate how thin structures change their shape in response to\nnon-mechanical stimuli that can be interpreted as variations in the structure's\nnatural curvature. Starting from the theory of non-Euclidean plates and shells,\nwe derive an effective model that reduces a three-dimensional stimulus to the\nnatural fundamental forms of the mid-surface of the structure, incorporating\nexpansion, or growth, in the thickness. Then, we apply the model to a variety\nof thin bodies, from flat plates to spherical shells, obtaining excellent\nagreement between theory and numerics. We show how cylinders and cones can\neither bend more or unroll, and eventually snap and rotate. We also study the\nnearly-isometric deformations of a spherical shell and describe how this shape\nchange is ruled by the geometry of a spindle. As the derived results stem from\na purely geometrical model, they are general and scalable.\n", "  An algorithm for the generation of non-uniform, locally-orthogonal staggered\nunstructured spheroidal grids is described. This technique is designed to\ngenerate very high-quality staggered Voronoi/Delaunay meshes appropriate for\ngeneral circulation modelling on the sphere, including applications to\natmospheric simulation, ocean-modelling and numerical weather prediction. Using\na recently developed Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique, a method for the\nconstruction of high-quality unstructured spheroidal Delaunay triangulations is\nintroduced. A locally-orthogonal polygonal grid, derived from the associated\nVoronoi diagram, is computed as the staggered dual. It is shown that use of the\nFrontal-Delaunay refinement technique allows for the generation of very\nhigh-quality unstructured triangulations, satisfying a-priori bounds on element\nsize and shape. Grid-quality is further improved through the application of\nhill-climbing type optimisation techniques. Overall, the algorithm is shown to\nproduce grids with very high element quality and smooth grading\ncharacteristics, while imposing relatively low computational expense. A\nselection of uniform and non-uniform spheroidal grids appropriate for\nhigh-resolution, multi-scale general circulation modelling are presented. These\ngrids are shown to satisfy the geometric constraints associated with\ncontemporary unstructured C-grid type finite-volume models, including the Model\nfor Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-O). The use of user-defined mesh-spacing\nfunctions to generate smoothly graded, non-uniform grids for multi-resolution\ntype studies is discussed in detail.\n", "  We present a novel interpretation of the previously puzzling different\nbehaviours of stellar populations of the Milky Way's bulge. We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar. For the first time we are able to account for the bulge's main\ntrends via a model in which the bulge formed largely in situ. Since the model\nis generic, we also predict the general appearance of stellar population maps\nof external edge-on galaxies.\n", "  State of the art methods in astronomical image reconstruction rely on the\nresolution of a regularized or constrained optimization problem. Solving this\nproblem can be computationally intensive and usually leads to a quadratic or at\nleast superlinear complexity w.r.t. the number of pixels in the image. We\ninvestigate in this work the use of convolutional neural networks for image\nreconstruction in astronomy. With neural networks, the computationally\nintensive tasks is the training step, but the prediction step has a fixed\ncomplexity per pixel, i.e. a linear complexity. Numerical experiments show that\nour approach is both computationally efficient and competitive with other state\nof the art methods in addition to being interpretable.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain after a local\nquench in which two independently thermalised chains are joined together and\nare left to evolve unitarily. In the emerging non-equilibrium steady state the\nR\\'enyi mutual information with different indices are calculated between two\nadjacent segments of the chain, and are found to scale logarithmically in the\nsubsystem size. Surprisingly, for R\\'enyi indices $\\alpha>2$ we find cases\nwhere the prefactor of the logarithmic dependence is negative. The fact that\nthe naively defined R\\'enyi mutual information might be negative has been\npointed out before, however, we provide the first example for this scenario in\na realistic many-body setup. Our numerical and analytical results indicate that\nin this setup it can be negative for any index $\\alpha>2$ while it is always\npositive for $\\alpha <2.$ Interestingly, even for $\\alpha>2$ the calculated\nprefactors show some universal features: for example, the same prefactor is\nalso shown to govern the logarithmic time dependence of the R\\'enyi mutual\ninformation before the system relaxes locally to the steady state. In\nparticular, it can decrease in the non-equilibrium evolution after the quench.\n", "  We develop a mathematically rigorous path integral representation of the time\nevolution operator for a model of (1+1) quantum gravity that incorporates\nfactor ordering ambiguity. In obtaining a suitable integral kernel for the\ntime-evolution operator, one requires that the corresponding Hamiltonian is\nself-adjoint; this issue is subtle for a particular category of factor\norderings. We identify and parametrize a complete set of self-adjoint\nextensions and provide a canonical description of these extensions in terms of\nboundary conditions. Moreover, we use Trotter-type product formulae to\nconstruct path-integral representations of time evolution.\n", "  We introduce a model concerning radiational gaseous stars and establish the\nexistence theory of stationary solutions to the free boundary problem of\nhydrostatic equations describing the radiative equilibrium. We also concern the\nlocal well-posedness of the moving boundary problem of the corresponding\nNavier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system and construct a prior estimates of strong\nand classical solutions. Our results explore the vacuum behaviour of density\nand temperature near the free boundary for the equilibrium and capture such\ndegeneracy in the evolutionary problem.\n", "  We study the decays of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(3686)$ to the final states\n$\\Sigma(1385)^{0}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{0}$ and $\\Xi^0\\bar\\Xi^{0}$ based on a single\nbaryon tag method using data samples of $(1310.6 \\pm 7.0) \\times 10^{6}$\n$J/\\psi$ and $(447.9 \\pm 2.9) \\times 10^{6}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with\nthe BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. The decays to\n$\\Sigma(1385)^{0}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{0}$ are observed for the first time. The\nmeasured branching fractions of $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Xi^0\\bar\\Xi^{0}$ are in good agreement with, and much\nmore precise, than the previously published results. The angular parameters for\nthese decays are also measured for the first time. The measured angular decay\nparameter for $J/\\psi\\rightarrow\\Sigma(1385)^{0}\\bar\\Sigma(1385)^{0}$, $\\alpha\n=-0.64 \\pm 0.03 \\pm 0.10$, is found to be negative, different to the other\ndecay processes in this measurement. In addition, the \"12\\% rule\" and isospin\nsymmetry in the $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\Xi\\bar\\Xi$ and\n$\\Sigma(1385)\\bar{\\Sigma}(1385)$ systems are tested.\n", "  The effect of strong singularity in the calculation of range function for the\nRKKY interaction in 1D electron gas is discussed. The method of handling this\nsingularity is presented. A possible way of avoiding the singularity in the\nRuderman-Kittel perturbation theory in 1D is described.\n", "  Recent terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of ISIS on American and\nEuropean soil by lone wolf attackers or sleeper cells remind us of the\nimportance of understanding the dynamics of radicalization mediated by social\nmedia communication channels. In this paper, we shed light on the social media\nactivity of a group of twenty-five thousand users whose association with ISIS\nonline radical propaganda has been manually verified. By using a computational\ntool known as dynamical activity-connectivity maps, based on network and\ntemporal activity patterns, we investigate the dynamics of social influence\nwithin ISIS supporters. We finally quantify the effectiveness of ISIS\npropaganda by determining the adoption of extremist content in the general\npopulation and draw a parallel between radical propaganda and epidemics\nspreading, highlighting that information broadcasters and influential ISIS\nsupporters generate highly-infectious cascades of information contagion. Our\nfindings will help generate effective countermeasures to combat the group and\nother forms of online extremism.\n", "  Based on the results published recently [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 065201\n(2017)], the universal finite-size contributions to the free energy of the\nsquare lattice Ising model on the $L\\times M$ rectangle, with open boundary\nconditions in both directions, are calculated exactly in the finite-size\nscaling limit $L,M\\to\\infty$, $T\\to T_\\mathrm{c}$, with fixed temperature\nscaling variable $x\\propto(T/T_\\mathrm{c}-1)M$ and fixed aspect ratio\n$\\rho\\propto L/M$. We derive exponentially fast converging series for the\nrelated Casimir potential and Casimir force scaling functions. At the critical\npoint $T=T_\\mathrm{c}$ we confirm predictions from conformal field theory by\nCardy & Peschel [Nucl. Phys. B 300, 377 (1988)] and by Kleban & Vassileva [J.\nPhys. A: Math. Gen. 24, 3407 (1991)]. The presence of corners and the related\ncorner free energy has dramatic impact on the Casimir scaling functions and\nleads to a logarithmic divergence of the Casimir potential scaling function at\ncriticality.\n", "  We calculate the decay width and the $\\tau$-lepton energy distribution as\nwell as relevant moments for inclusive $\\bar B \\to X_c \\tau \\bar \\nu_\\tau$\nprocess including power corrections up to order $\\Lambda_{QCD}^3/m_b^3$ and QCD\ncorrections to the partonic level. We compare the result with the sum of the\nstandard-model predictions of the branching fractions of the exclusive\nsemileptonic $\\bar B \\to (D, D^*, D^{**}) \\tau \\bar \\nu_\\tau$ decays as well as\nwith the relevant experimental data. Our prediction is in agreement with the\nLEP measurement and is consistent with the standard-model calculation of the\nexclusive modes. We discuss the impact from physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a localized spin-1/2 driven by a time-periodic\nmagnetic field that undergoes a topological transition. Despite the strongly\nnon-adiabatic effects dominating the spin dynamics, we find that the field's\ntopology appears clearly imprinted in the Floquet spin states through an\neffective Berry phase emerging in the quasienergy. This has remarkable\nconsequences on the spin resonance condition suggesting a whole new class of\nexperiments to spot topological transitions in the dynamics of spins and other\ntwo-level systems, from nuclear magnetic resonance to strongly-driven\nsuperconducting qubits.\n", "  We demonstrate long trion spin lifetimes in a WSe$_2$ monolayer of up to 150\nns at 5 K. Applying a transverse magnetic field in time-resolved Kerr-rotation\nmeasurements reveals a complex composition of the spin signal of up to four\ndistinct components. The Kerr rotation signal can be well described by a model\nwhich includes inhomogeneous spin dephasing and by setting the trion spin\nlifetimes to the measured excitonic recombination times extracted from\ntime-resolved reflectivity measurements. We observe a continuous shift of the\nKerr resonance with the probe energy, which can be explained by an\nadsorbate-induced, inhomogeneous potential landscape of the WSe$_2$ flake. A\nfurther indication of extrinsic effects on the spin dynamics is given by a\nchange of both the trion spin lifetime and the distribution of g-factors over\ntime. Finally, we detect a Kerr rotation signal from the trion's higher-energy\ntriplet state when the lower-energy singlet state is optically pumped by\ncircularly polarized light. We explain this by the formation of dark trion\nstates, which are also responsible for the observed long trion spin lifetimes.\n", "  Can the theory that reality is a simulation be tested? We investigate this\nquestion based on the assumption that if the system performing the simulation\nis finite (i.e. has limited resources), then to achieve low computational\ncomplexity, such a system would, as in a video game, render content (reality)\nonly at the moment that information becomes available for observation by a\nplayer and not at the moment of detection by a machine (that would be part of\nthe simulation and whose detection would also be part of the internal\ncomputation performed by the Virtual Reality server before rendering content to\nthe player). Guided by this principle we describe conceptual wave/particle\nduality experiments aimed at testing the simulation theory.\n", "  Successful preparation of polymer nanocomposites, exploiting graphene-related\nmaterials, via melt mixing technology requires precise design, optimization and\ncontrol of processing. In the present work, the effect of different processing\nparameters during the preparation of poly (butylene terephthalate)\nnanocomposites, through ring-opening polymerization of cyclic butylene\nterephthalate in presence of graphite nanoplatelets (GNP), was thoroughly\naddressed. Processing temperature (240{\\deg}C or 260{\\deg}C), extrusion time (5\nor 10 minutes) and shear rate (50 or 100 rpm) were varied by means of a full\nfactorial design of experiment approach, leading to the preparation of\npolybutylene terephthalate/GNP nanocomposite in 8 different processing\nconditions. Morphology and quality of GNP were investigated by means of\nelectron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and\nRaman spectroscopy. Molecular weight of the polymer matrix in nanocomposites\nand nanoflake dispersion were experimentally determined as a function of the\ndifferent processing conditions. The effect of transformation parameters on\nelectrical and thermal properties was studied by means of electrical and\nthermal conductivity measurement. Heat and charge transport performance\nevidenced a clear correlation with the dispersion and fragmentation of the GNP\nnanoflakes; in particular, gentle processing conditions (low shear rate, short\nmixing time) turned out to be the most favourable condition to obtain high\nconductivity values.\n", "  In this work, the study of thermal conductivity before and after in-situ\nring-opening polymerization of cyclic butylene terephthalate into poly\n(butylene terephthalate) in presence of graphene-related materials (GRM) is\naddressed, to gain insight in the modification of nanocomposites morphology\nupon polymerization. Five types of GRM were used: one type of graphite\nnanoplatelets, two different grades of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and the\nsame rGO grades after thermal annealing for 1 hour at 1700{\\deg}C under vacuum\nto reduce their defectiveness. Polymerization of CBT into pCBT, morphology and\nnanoparticle organization were investigated by means of differential scanning\ncalorimetry, electron microscopy and rheology. Electrical and thermal\nproperties were investigated by means of volumetric resistivity and bulk\nthermal conductivity measurement. In particular, the reduction of nanoflake\naspect ratio during ring-opening polymerization was found to have a detrimental\neffect on both electrical and thermal conductivities in nanocomposites.\n", "  For a general spherically four--dimensional metric the notion of\n\"circularity\" of a family of equatorial geodesic trajectories is defined in\ngeometrical terms. The main object turns out to be the angular--momentum\nfunction $J$ obeying a consistency condition involving the mean extrinsic\ncurvature of the submanifold containing the geodesics. The ana\\-ly\\-sis of\nlinear stability is reduced to a simple dynamical system formally describing a\ndamped harmonic oscillator. For static metrics the existence of such geodesics\nis given when $J^2 > 0$, and $(J^2)' > 0$ for stability. The formalism is then\napplied to the Schwarzschild--de Sitter solution, both in its static and in its\ntime--dependent cosmological version, as well to the Kerr--de Sitter solution.\nIn addition we present an approximate solution to a cosmological metric\ncontaining a massive source and solving the Einstein field equation for a\nmassless scalar.\n", "  We consider the spreading of the wave packet in the generalized\nRosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble in the region of non-ergodic extended\nstates $1<\\gamma<2$. We show that despite non-trivial fractal dimensions $0 <\nD_{q}=2-\\gamma<1$ characterize wave function statistics in this region, the\nwave packet spreading $\\langle r^{2} \\rangle \\propto t^{\\beta}$ is governed by\nthe \"diffusion\" exponent $\\beta=1$ outside the ballistic regime $t>\\tau\\sim 1$\nand $\\langle r^{2}\\rangle \\propto t^{2}$ in the ballistic regime for\n$t<\\tau\\sim 1$. This demonstrates that the multifractality exhibits itself only\nin {\\it local} quantities like the wave packet survival probability but not in\nthe large-distance spreading of the wave packet.\n", "  We formulate large $N$ duality of $\\mathrm{U}(N)$ refined Chern-Simons theory\nwith a torus knot/link in $S^3$. By studying refined BPS states in M-theory, we\nprovide the explicit form of low-energy effective actions of Type IIA string\ntheory with D4-branes on the $\\Omega$-background. This form enables us to\nrelate refined Chern-Simons invariants of a torus knot/link in $S^3$ to refined\nBPS invariants in the resolved conifold. Assuming that the extra\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)$ global symmetry acts on BPS states trivially, the duality\npredicts graded dimensions of cohomology groups of moduli spaces of M2-M5 bound\nstates associated to a torus knot/link in the resolved conifold. Thus, this\nformulation can be also interpreted as a positivity conjecture of refined\nChern-Simons invariants of torus knots/links. We also discuss about an\nextension to non-torus knots.\n", "  The wealth of recent data from imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs),\nultra-high energy cosmic-ray experiments and neutrino telescopes have fuelled a\nrenewed interest in hadronic emission models for gamma-loud blazars. We explore\nphysically plausible solutions for a lepto-hadronic interpretation of the\nstationary emission from high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs). The\nmodelled spectral energy distributions are then searched for specific\nsignatures at very high energies that could help to distinguish the hadronic\norigin of the emission from a standard leptonic scenario. By introducing a few\nbasic constraints on parameters of the model, such as assuming the\nco-acceleration of electrons and protons, we significantly reduced the number\nof free parameters. We then systematically explored the parameter space of the\nsize of the emission region and its magnetic field for two bright gamma-loud\nHBLs, PKS 2155-304 and Mrk 421. For all solutions close to equipartition\nbetween the energy densities of protons and of the magnetic field, and with\nacceptable jet power and light-crossing timescales, we inspected the spectral\nhardening in the multi-TeV domain from proton-photon induced cascades and\nmuon-synchrotron emission inside the source. Very-high-energy spectra simulated\nwith the available instrument functions from the future Cherenkov Telescope\nArray (CTA) were evaluated for detectable features as a function of exposure\ntime, source redshift, and flux level. Over a large range of model parameters,\nthe spectral hardening due to internal synchrotron-pair cascades, the \"cascade\nbump\", should be detectable for acceptable exposure times with the future CTA\nfor a few nearby and bright HBLs.\n", "  We introduce and study the domain wall boundary partition function of the\nintegrable six-vertex model with triangular boundary. We first formulate the\ndomain wall boundary partition function with triangular boundary by using the\n$U_q(sl_2)$ $R$-matrix and a special class of the triangular $K$-matrix. By\nusing its graphical representation, we make the Izergin-Korepin analysis with\nthe help of the Yang-Baxter relation and the reflection equation to give a\ncharacterization of the partition function. The explict form of the symmetric\nfunction representing the partition function is presented by showing that it\nsatisfies all the required properties.\n", "  We present libvdwxc, a general library for evaluating the energy and\npotential for the family of vdW-DF exchange--correlation functionals. libvdwxc\nprovides an efficient implementation of the vdW-DF method and can be interfaced\nwith various general-purpose DFT codes. Currently, the GPAW and Octopus codes\nimplement interfaces to libvdwxc. The present implementation emphasizes\nscalability and parallel performance, and thereby enables \\textit{ab initio}\ncalculations of nanometer-scale complexes. The numerical accuracy is\nbenchmarked on the S22 test set whereas parallel performance is benchmarked on\nligand-protected gold nanoparticles\n($\\text{Au}_{144}(\\text{SC}_{11}\\text{NH}_{25})_{60}$) up to 9696 atoms.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate colloid-oil-water-interface\ninteractions of charged, sterically stabilized, poly(methyl-methacrylate)\ncolloidal particles dispersed in a low-polar oil (dielectric constant\n$\\epsilon=5-10$) that is in contact with an adjacent water phase. In this model\nsystem, the colloidal particles cannot penetrate the oil-water interface due to\nrepulsive van der Waals forces with the interface whereas the multiple salts\nthat are dissolved in the oil are free to partition into the water phase. The\nsign and magnitude of the Donnan potential and/or the particle charge is\naffected by these salt concentrations such that the effective interaction\npotential can be highly tuned. Both the equilibrium effective colloid-interface\ninteractions and the ion dynamics are explored within a Poisson-Nernst-Planck\ntheory, and compared to experimental observations.\n", "  We present basic data and modeling for a survey of the cool, photo-ionized\nCircum-Galactic Medium (CGM) of low-redshift galaxies using far-UV QSO\nabsorption line probes. This survey consists of \"targeted\" and \"serendipitous\"\nCGM subsamples, originally described in Stocke et al. (2013, Paper 1). The\ntargeted subsample probes low-luminosity, late-type galaxies at $z<0.02$ with\nsmall impact parameters ($\\langle\\rho\\rangle = 71$ kpc), and the serendipitous\nsubsample probes higher luminosity galaxies at $z\\lesssim0.2$ with larger\nimpact parameters ($\\langle\\rho\\rangle = 222$ kpc). HST and FUSE UV\nspectroscopy of the absorbers and basic data for the associated galaxies,\nderived from ground-based imaging and spectroscopy, are presented. We find\nbroad agreement with the COS-Halos results, but our sample shows no evidence\nfor changing ionization parameter or hydrogen density with distance from the\nCGM host galaxy, probably because the COS-Halos survey probes the CGM at\nsmaller impact parameters. We find at least two passive galaxies with H I and\nmetal-line absorption, confirming the intriguing COS-Halos result that galaxies\nsometimes have cool gas halos despite no on-going star formation. Using a new\nmethodology for fitting H I absorption complexes, we confirm the CGM cool gas\nmass of Paper 1, but this value is significantly smaller than found by the\nCOS-Halos survey. We trace much of this difference to the specific values of\nthe low-$z$ meta-galactic ionization rate assumed. After accounting for this\ndifference, a best-value for the CGM cool gas mass is found by combining the\nresults of both surveys to obtain $\\log{(M/M_{\\odot})}=10.5\\pm0.3$, or ~30% of\nthe total baryon reservoir of an $L \\geq L^*$, star-forming galaxy.\n", "  A procedure is presented that combines density functional theory computations\nof bulk semiconductor alloys with the semiconductor Bloch equations, in order\nto achieve an ab initio based prediction of the optical properties of\nsemiconductor alloy heterostructures. The parameters of an eight-band\nkp-Hamiltonian are fitted to the effective band structure of an appropriate\nalloy. The envelope function approach is applied to model the quantum well\nusing the kp-wave functions and eigenvalues as starting point for calculating\nthe optical properties of the heterostructure. It is shown that Luttinger\nparameters derived from band structures computed with the TB09 density\nfunctional reproduce extrapolated values. The procedure is illustrated by\ncomputing the absorption spectra for a (AlGa)As/Ga(AsP)/(AlGa)As quantum well\nsystem with varying phosphide content in the active layer.\n", "  We describe the magnetic phase of SU(N) $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Super Yang-Mills\ntheories in the self-dual Omega background in terms of a new class of multi-cut\nmatrix models. These arise from a non-perturbative completion of topological\nstrings in the dual four dimensional limit which engineers the gauge theory in\nthe strongly coupled magnetic frame. The corresponding spectral determinants\nprovide natural candidates for the tau functions of isomonodromy problems for\nflat spectral connections associated to the Seiberg-Witten geometry.\n", "  The Higgs potential consists of an unexplored territory in which the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is triggered, and it is moreover directly related\nto the nature of the electroweak phase transition. Measuring the Higgs boson\ncubic and quartic couplings, or getting equivalently information on the exact\nshape of the Higgs potential, is therefore an essential task. However, direct\nmeasurements beyond the cubic self-interaction of the Higgs boson consist of a\nhuge challenge, even for a future proton-proton collider expected to operate at\na center-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. We present a novel approach to extract\nmodel-independent constraints on the triple and quartic Higgs self-coupling by\ninvestigating triple Higgs-boson hadroproduction at a center-of-mass energy of\n100 TeV, focusing on the $\\tau \\tau b \\bar{b} b \\bar{b}$ channel that was\npreviously overlooked due to a supposedly too large background. It is thrown\ninto sharp relief that the assist from transverse variables such as $m_{T2}$\nand a boosted configuration ensures a high signal sensitivity. We derive the\nluminosities that would be required to constrain given deviations from the\nStandard Model in the Higgs self-interactions, showing for instance that a\n$2\\sigma$ sensitivity could be achieved for an integrated luminosity of 30\nab$^{-1}$ when Standard Model properties are assumed. With the prospects of\ncombining these findings with other triple-Higgs search channels, the Standard\nModel Higgs quartic coupling could in principle be reached with a significance\nbeyond the $3\\sigma$ level.\n", "  The classification of stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) is revisited\nusing modern data-sets. Spectra are analysed using an empirical method to\n\"blindly\" categorise SNe according to spectral feature strength and appearance.\nThis method makes a clear distinction between SNe that are He-rich (IIb/Ib) and\nHe-poor (Ic) and further analysis is performed on each subgroup. For He-rich\nSNe the presence of H becomes the focus. The strength, velocity, and ratio\nbetween absorption and emission of H$\\alpha$ is measured, along with additional\nanalysis of He I lines, in order to categorise the SNe. The He-poor SNe are\nordered according to the number of absorption features $N$ present in the\nspectra, which is a measure of the degree of line blending. The kinetic energy\nper unit mass $E_\\mathrm{k}/M_\\mathrm{ej}$ is strongly affected by mass at high\nvelocity and such situations principally occur when the outer density profile\nof the ejecta is shallow, leading to the blending of lines. Using the results,\nthe existing SE-SN taxonomic scheme is adapted. He-rich SNe are split into four\ngroups, IIb, IIb(I), Ib(II), and Ib, which represent H-rich to H-poor SNe. The\nSNe Ic category of broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) is abandoned in favour of quantifying\nthe line blending via $\\left<N\\right>$ before peak. To better reflect the\nphysical parameters of the explosions, the velocity of Si II at peak and the\nhalf-luminosity decay time $t_{+1/2}$ are included to give SNe Ic a designation\nof Ic-$\\left<N\\right>\\left(v_\\mathrm{p,SiII}/t_{+1/2}\\right)$.\n", "  We present the first ALMA observations of the closest known extrasolar debris\ndisc. This disc orbits the star $\\epsilon$ Eridani, a K-type star just 3.2pc\naway. Due to the proximity of the star, the entire disc cannot fit within the\nALMA field of view. Therefore, the observations have been centred 18\" North of\nthe star, providing us with a clear detection of the northern arc of the ring,\nat a wavelength of 1.3mm. The observed disc emission is found to be narrow with\na width of just 11-13AU. The fractional disc width we find is comparable to\nthat of the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and makes this one of the narrowest\ndebris discs known. If the inner and outer edges are due to resonances with a\nplanet then this planet likely has a semi-major axis of 48AU. We find tentative\nevidence for clumps in the ring, although there is a strong chance that at\nleast one is a background galaxy. We confirm, at much higher significance, the\nprevious detection of an unresolved emission at the star that is above the\nlevel of the photosphere and attribute this excess to stellar chromospheric\nemission.\n", "  The quasi-bound states of charged massive scalar fields in the near-extremal\ncharged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole spacetime are studied {\\it\nanalytically}. These discrete resonant modes of the composed black-hole-field\nsystem are characterized by the physically motivated boundary condition of\ningoing waves at the black-hole horizon and exponentially decaying (bounded)\nradial eigenfunctions at spatial infinity. Solving the Klein-Gordon wave\nequation for the linearized scalar fields in the black-hole spacetime, we\nderive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the complex frequency\nspectrum which characterizes the quasi-bound state resonances of the composed\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-black-hole-charged-massive-scalar-field system.\n", "  We develop a systematic procedure of constructing lepton mass matrices that\nsatisfy all the experimental constraints in the light lepton sector of the\nminimal left-right symmetric model with type-I seesaw dominance. This method is\nunique since it is applicable to the most general cases of type-I seesaw with\ncomplex electroweak vacuum expectation values in the model. With this method,\nwe investigate the TeV-scale phenomenology in the normal hierarchy without\nfine-tuning of model parameters, focusing on the charged lepton flavour\nviolation, neutrinoless double beta decay, and electric dipole moments of\ncharged leptons. We examine the predictions for typical ranges of associated\nobservables such as branching ratios of rare lepton decays, and study how those\nexperimental constraints affect the model parameter space. The most notable\nresult is that the regions of parameter space that allow small light neutrino\nmasses have been constrained by the present experimental bounds from charged\nlepton flavour violation. Furthermore, we also find that the mass of the\nlightest heavy neutrino should be relatively small in order to satisfy those\nexperimental constraints.\n", "  The existence of incompatible observables constitutes one of the most\nprominent characteristics of quantum mechanics (QM) and can be revealed and\nformalized through uncertainty relations. The\nHeisenberg-Robertson-Schr\\\"odinger uncertainty relation (HRSUR) was proved at\nthe dawn of quantum formalism and is ever-present in the teaching and research\non QM. Notwithstanding, the HRSUR possess the so called triviality problem.\nThat is to say, the HRSUR yields no information about the possible\nincompatibility between two observables if the system was prepared in a state\nwhich is an eigenvector of one of them. After about 85 years of existence of\nthe HRSUR, this problem was solved recently by Lorenzo Maccone and Arun K.\nPati. In this article, we start doing a brief discussion of general aspects of\nthe uncertainty principle in QM and recapitulating the proof of HRSUR.\nAfterwards we present in simple terms the proof of the Maccone-Pati uncertainty\nrelation, which can be obtained basically via the application of the\nparallelogram law and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n", "  In this essay, we study the sufficient and necessary conditions for a Randers\nmetrc to be of constant Ricci curvature without the restriction of strong\nconvexity (regularity). The classification result for the case\n$\\|\\beta\\|_{\\alpha}>1$ is provided, which is similar to the famous\nBao-Robles-Shen's result for strongly convex Randers metrics\n($\\|\\beta\\|_{\\alpha}<1$).\n  Based on some famous Einstein-Lorentz metrics in General Relativity, such as\nMinkowski metric, Sitter metric, anti de Sitter metric, Schwarzschild metric,\nKerr metric, C-metric, Kasner metric, Levi-Civita metric,\nCartor-Novotn\\'{y}-Horsk\\'{y} metric, etc., many non-regular Einstein-Randers\nmetrics are constructed.\n  Besides, we find that the case $\\|\\beta\\|_{\\alpha}\\equiv1$ is very\ndistinctive. These metrics will be called singular Randers metrics or parabolic\nFinsler metrics since their indicatrixs are parabolic hypersurface. A\npreliminary discussion for such metrics is provided.\n", "  The present work analyzes the distribution function of the finite scale local\nLyapunov exponent of a pair fluid particles trajectories in fully developed\nincompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence. According to the hypothesis of\nfully developed chaos, this PDF is reasonably estimated by maximizing the\nentropy associated to such distribution, resulting to be an uniform\ndistribution function in a proper interval of variation of the local Lyapunov\nexponents. From this PDF, we determine the relationship between the average and\nmaximum Lyapunov exponents and the longitudinal velocity correlation function.\nThis link, which leads to the closure of von K\\`arm\\`an--Howarth and Corrsin\nequations, agrees with the relation obtained in the previous work, supporting\nthe proposed PDF calculation, at least for the purposes of the energy cascade\neffect estimation. Furthermore, through the property that the Lyapunov vectors\ntend to align to the direction of the maximum growth rate of trajectories\ndistance, we obtain the link between maximum and average Lyapunov exponents in\nline with the previous result.\n", "  When families of quantum systems are equipped with a continuous family of\nHamiltonians such that there is a gap in the common spectrum one can define a\nnotion of a Berry connection. In this note we stress that, in general, since\nthe Hilbert bundle defining the family of quantum systems does not come with a\ncanonical trivialization there is in fact not a single Berry connection but\nrather a family of Berry connections. Two examples illustrate that this remark\ncan have physical consequences.\n", "  In this report, we compare the naturalness and Dark Matter (DM) properties of\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and the $B-L$ Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (BLSSM), with universality in both cases. We do this by adopting\nstandard measures for the quantitative analysis of the Fine-Tuning (FT), at\nboth low (i.e. supersymmetric (SUSY)) and high (i.e. unification) scales. We\nwill see a similar level of FT for both models in these scenarios, with a\nslightly better FT for the BLSSM at SUSY scales and MSSM at Grand Unification\nTheory (GUT) scales. When including DM relic constraints, we drastically\nconfine the MSSM's parameter space, whereas we still find a large parameter\nspace available for the non-minimal scenario.\n", "  The need for modification of the Huygens-Fresnel superposition principle\narises even in the description of the free fields of massive particles and,\nmore extensively, in nonlinear field theories. A wide range of formulations and\nsuperposition schemes for secondary waves are captured by Kirchhoff's integral\ntheorem. We discuss various versions of this theorem as well as its connection\nwith the superposition principle and the method of Green's functions. A\nsuperposition scheme inherent in linear field theories, which is not based on\nKirchhoff's integral theorem but instead relies on the completeness condition,\nis also discussed.\n", "  We have selected a sample of 41 extremely isolated galaxies (EIGs) from the\nlocal universe using both optical and HI ALFALFA redshifts (Spector & Brosch\n2016). Narrow band H$_\\alpha$ and wide band imaging along with public data were\nused to derive star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs),\nand morphological classifications for the EIGs. We have found that the extreme\nisolation of the EIGs does not affect considerably their star-formation\ncompared to field galaxies. EIGs are typically `blue cloud' galaxies that fit\nthe `main sequence of star forming galaxies' and may show asymmetric star\nformation and strong compact star-forming regions.\n  We discovered surprising environmental dependencies of the HI content,\nM$_{HI}$, and of the morphological type of EIGs; The most isolated galaxies (of\nsubsample EIG-1) have lower M$_{HI}$ on average (with $2.5\\,\\sigma$ confidence)\nand a higher tendency to be early-types (with 0.94 confidence) compared to the\nless isolated galaxies of subsample EIG-2. To the best of our knowledge this is\nthe first study that finds an effect in which an isolated sample shows a higher\nfraction of early-types compared to a less isolated sample.\n  Both early-type and late-type EIGs follow the same colour-to-M$_{*}$,\nSFR-to-M$_{*}$ (`main sequence') and M$_{HI}$-to-$M_{*}$ relations. This\nindicates that the mechanisms and factors governing star formation, colour and\nthe M$_{HI}$-to-M$_{*}$ relation are similar in early-type and late-type EIGs,\nand that the morphological type of EIGs is not governed by their M$_{HI}$\ncontent, colour or SFR.\n", "  The problem of predictability, or \"nature vs. nurture\", in both ordered and\ndisordered Ising systems following a deep quench from infinite to zero\ntemperature is reviewed. Two questions are addressed. The first deals with the\nnature of the final state: for an infinite system, does every spin flip\ninfinitely often, or does every spin flip only finitely many times, or do some\nspins flip infinitely often and others finitely often? Once this question is\ndetermined, the evolution of the system from its initial state can be studied\nwith attention to the issue of how much information contained in the final\nstate depends on that contained in the initial state, and how much depends on\nthe detailed history of the system. This problem has been addressed both\nanalytically and numerically in several papers, and their main methods,\nresults, and conclusions will be reviewed. The discussion closes with some open\nproblems that remain to be addressed.\n", "  Staggered grid finite difference scheme is widely used for the first order\nelastic wave equation, which constitutes the basis for least-squares reverse\ntime migration and full waveform inversion. It is of great importance to\nimprove the efficiency and accuracy of wave equation modeling. Usually the same\nstaggered grid finite difference scheme is used for all the spatial derivatives\nin the first order elastic wave equation. In this paper, we propose a new\nstaggered grid finite difference scheme which can improve the efficiency while\npreserving the same accuracy for the first order elastic wave equation\nsimulation. It uses second order staggered grid finite difference scheme for\nsome of the first order spatial derivatives while utilizing longer staggered\ngrid finite difference operator for other first order spatial derivatives. We\nThe staggered grid finite difference coefficients of the new finite difference\nscheme are determined in the space domain by a linear method. We demonstrate by\ndispersion analysis and numerical simulation the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n", "  We consider the variation of von Neumann entropy of subsystem reduced states\nof general many- body lattice spin systems due to local quantum quenches. We\nobtain Lieb-Robinson-like bounds that are independent of the subsystem volume.\nThe main assumptions are that the Hamiltonian satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound\nand that the volume of spheres on the lattice grows at most exponentially with\ntheir radius. More specifically, the bound exponentially increases with time\nbut exponentially decreases with the distance between the subsystem and the\nregion where the quench takes place. The fact that the bound is independent of\nthe subsystem volume leads to stronger constraints (than previously known) on\nthe propagation of information throughout many-body systems. In particular, it\nshows that bipartite entanglement satisfies an effective \"light cone\",\nregardless of system size. Further implications to t density-matrix\nrenormalization-group simulations of quantum spin chains and limitations to the\npropagation of information are discussed.\n", "  This work presents a generalization of the Koashi-Winter relation for\n$\\alpha$-Renyi entropies. This result is based on the Renyi\\apos s entropy\nversion of quantum Jensen Shannon divergence. By means of this definition, a\nclassical correlations quantifier $C_{\\alpha}(\\rho_{AB}) =\n\\sup_{\\xi_{AB}^{M_B}} Q_{\\alpha}(\\xi_{AB}^{M_B})$ is proposed, where the\noptimization is taken over the ensembles $\\xi_{AB}^{M_B}$ created by the\noutputs of the local measurement process. The main result is applied to the\ncapacity of a quantum classical channel over a tripartite pure state\n$\\psi_{ABE}$, that is rated above in function of the probability of success to\ndiscriminate the states in the ensemble $\\xi_{AE}^{M_E}$, created by the local\ndephasing over partition $E$, and the asymptotic log generalized robustness of\npartition $AB$. Some analytical results are calculated for classical\ncorrelations and entanglement of formation.\n", "  The magnetism in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ has been investigated using thermodynamic\nmeasurements, first principles calculations, neutron diffraction and diffuse\nneutron scattering on single crystals. These data confirm that\nMn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ is a ferrimagnet below a Curie temperature of $T_C$\napproximately 78K. The magnetism is anisotropic, with magnetization and neutron\ndiffraction demonstrating that the moments lie within the basal plane of the\ntrigonal structure. The saturation magnetization of approximately 1.6$\\mu_B$/Mn\nat 5K originates from the different multiplicities of the two\nantiferromagnetically-aligned Mn sites. First principles calculations reveal\nantiferromagnetic exchange for the three nearest Mn-Mn pairs, which leads to a\ncompetition between the ferrimagnetic ground state and three other magnetic\nconfigurations. The ferrimagnetic state results from the energy associated with\nthe third-nearest neighbor interaction, and thus long-range interactions are\nessential for the observed behavior. Diffuse magnetic scattering is observed\naround the 002 Bragg reflection at 120K, which indicates the presence of strong\nspin correlations well above $T_C$. These are promoted by the competing ground\nstates that result in a relative suppression of $T_C$, and may be associated\nwith a small ferromagnetic component that produces anisotropic magnetism below\n$\\approx$330K.\n", "  This is the second part of a three-volume guide to TLUSTY and SYNSPEC. It\npresents a detailed reference manual for TLUSTY, which contains a detailed\ndescription of basic physical assumptions and equations used to model an\natmosphere, together with an overview of the numerical methods to solve these\nequations.\n", "  This paper presents a detailed operational manual for TLUSTY. It provides a\nguide for understanding the essential features and the basic modes of operation\nof the program. To help the user, it is divided into two parts. The first part\ndescribes the most important input parameters and available numerical options.\nThe second part covers additional details and a comprehensive description of\nall physical and numerical options, and a description of all input parameters,\nmany of which needed only in special cases.\n", "  In this short review, we aim to provide a topical update on the status of\nefforts to understand the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4. We concentrate on the\nquest to identify a superconducting order parameter symmetry that is compatible\nwith all the major pieces of experimental knowledge of the material, and\nhighlight some major discrepancies that have become even clearer in recent\nyears. As the pun in the title suggests, we have tried to start the discussion\nfrom scratch, making no assumptions even about fundamental issues such as the\nparity of the superconducting state. We conclude that no consensus is currently\nachievable in Sr2RuO4, and that the reasons for this go to the heart of how\nwell some of the key probes of unconventional superconductivity are really\nunderstood. This is therefore a puzzle that merits continued in-depth study.\n", "  The detection of frauds in credit card transactions is a major topic in\nfinancial research, of profound economic implications. While this has hitherto\nbeen tackled through data analysis techniques, the resemblances between this\nand other problems, like the design of recommendation systems and of diagnostic\n/ prognostic medical tools, suggest that a complex network approach may yield\nimportant benefits. In this contribution we present a first hybrid data mining\n/ complex network classification algorithm, able to detect illegal instances in\na real card transaction data set. It is based on a recently proposed network\nreconstruction algorithm that allows creating representations of the deviation\nof one instance from a reference group. We show how the inclusion of features\nextracted from the network data representation improves the score obtained by a\nstandard, neural network-based classification algorithm; and additionally how\nthis combined approach can outperform a commercial fraud detection system in\nspecific operation niches. Beyond these specific results, this contribution\nrepresents a new example on how complex networks and data mining can be\nintegrated as complementary tools, with the former providing a view to data\nbeyond the capabilities of the latter.\n", "  An axiomatic approach is herein used to determine the physically acceptable\nforms for general $D$-dimensional kinetic energy density functionals (KEDF).\nThe resulted expansion captures most of the known forms of one-point KEDFs. By\nstatistically training the KEDF forms on a model problem of non-interacting\nkinetic energy in 1D (6 terms only), the mean relative accuracy for 1000\nrandomly generated potentials is found to be better than the standard KEDF by\nseveral orders of magnitudes. The accuracy improves with the number of occupied\nstates and was found to be better than $10^{-4}$ for a system with four\noccupied states. Furthermore, we show that free fitting of the coefficients\nassociated with known KEDFs approaches the exactly analytic values. The\npresented approach can open a new route to search for physically acceptable\nkinetic energy density functionals and provide an essential step towards more\naccurate large-scale orbital free density functional theory calculations.\n", "  An efficient descriptor model for fast screening of potential materials for\nsolar cell applications is presented. It works for both excitonic and\nnon-excitonic solar cells materials, and in addition to the energy gap it\nincludes the absorption spectrum ($\\alpha(E)$) of the material. The charge\ntransport properties of the explored materials are modeled using the\ncharacteristic diffusion length ($L_{d}$) determined for the respective family\nof compounds. The presented model surpasses the widely used Scharber model\ndeveloped for bulk-heterojunction solar cells [Scharber \\textit{et al.,\nAdvanced Materials}, 2006, Vol. 18, 789]. Using published experimental data, we\nshow that the presented model is more accurate in predicting the achievable\nefficiencies. Although the focus of this work is on organic photovoltaics\n(OPV), for which the original Scharber model was developed, the model presented\nhere is applicable also to other solar cell technologies. To model both\nexcitonic and non-excitonic systems, two different sets of parameters are used\nto account for the different modes of operation. The analysis of the presented\ndescriptor model clearly shows the benefit of including $\\alpha(E)$ and $L_{d}$\nin view of improved screening results.\n", "  We report a new scheme of realizing terahertz fingerprint detection with\nultrahigh sensitivity. Instead of using the direct absorption of terahertz\nthrough a bare sample in the regular transmission scheme, a cavity mode\nresonating at the characteristic frequency of the sample is used and due to the\nhigh dependence of the cavity mode transmission on the material loss, an\namplified transmission decaying is observed when the sample is loaded into the\ncavity. Furthermore, this scheme retains the feature of substance\nidentification. A one-dimensional photonic crystal cavity is used as the\nexample for the detection of {\\alpha}-lactose and an efficient detection of 7nm\n{\\alpha}-lactose can be achieved, which corresponds to 1/80000 of the free\nspace wavelength at the characteristic frequency of 0.529THz, exhibiting\nsensitivity 500 times higher than the regular method.\n", "  The ignition delay of a fuel/air mixture is an important quantity in\ndesigning combustion devices, and these data are also used to validate chemical\nkinetic models for combustion. One of the typical experimental devices used to\nmeasure the ignition delay is called a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). This\npaper presents UConnRCMPy, an open-source Python package to process\nexperimental data from the RCM at the University of Connecticut. Given an\nexperimental measurement, UConnRCMPy computes the thermodynamic conditions in\nthe reaction chamber of the RCM during an experiment along with the ignition\ndelay. UConnRCMPy implements an extensible framework, so that alternative\nexperimental data formats can be incorporated easily. In this way, UConnRCMPy\nimproves the consistency of RCM data processing and enables the community to\nreproduce data analysis procedures.\n", "  We propose and analyze a method for efficient dissipative preparation of\nmatrix product states that exploits their symmetry properties. Specifically, we\nconstruct an explicit protocol that makes use of driven-dissipative dynamics to\nprepare the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states, which features\nsymmetry-protected topological order and non-trivial edge excitations. We show\nthat the use of symmetry allows for robust experimental implementation without\nfine-tuned control parameters. Numerical simulations show that the preparation\ntime scales polynomially in system size $n$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthis scaling can be improved to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2n)$ by using parallel\npreparation of AKLT segments and fusing them via quantum feedback. A concrete\nscheme using excitation of trapped neutral atoms into Rydberg state via\nElectromagnetically Induced Transparency is proposed, and generalizations to a\nbroader class of matrix product states are discussed.\n", "  A Bell test separates quantum mechanics from a classical, local realist\ntheory of physics. However, a Bell test cannot separate quantum physics from\nall classical theories. Classical devices supplemented with non-signaling\ncorrelations, e.g., the Popescu-Rohrlich \"nonlocal box,\" can pass a Bell test\nwith probability at least as high as any quantum devices can. After all,\nquantum entanglement does not allow for signaling faster than the speed of\nlight, so in a sense is a weaker special case of non-signaling correlations. It\ncould be that underneath quantum mechanics is a deeper non-signaling theory.\n  We present a test to separate quantum theory from powerful non-signaling\ntheories. The test extends the CHSH game to involve three space-like separated\ndevices. Quantum devices sharing a three-qubit GHZ state can pass the test with\nprobability 5.1% higher than classical devices sharing arbitrary non-signaling\ncorrelations between pairs.\n  More generally, we give a test that k space-like separated quantum devices\ncan pass with higher probability than classical devices sharing arbitrary\n(k-1)-local non-signaling correlations.\n", "  Recent experiments on the National Ignition Facility [D.E. Hinkel et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 117, 225002 (2016)] demonstrates that utilizing a long, large\ncase-to-capsule ratio (=3) conventional cylindrical hohlraum at moderate\ngas-fill density (=0.6 mg/cm3 4He) improves the drive symmetry controaums has a\nlittle chance to achieve ignition at an acceptable energy level due to its\nsmall margin for the laser cone propagation. In this letter, a noncylindrical\nhohlraum, called as peanut hohlraum, using a larger case-to-capsule (=3.46) at\nlower gas-fill density (=0.3 mg/cm3 4He) is proposed to ignite a high-foot\npusher capsule with a shorter pulse (~9ns). The peanut hohlraum requires about\n2.5 MJ laser energy to achieve 306 eV peak drive temperature while the low-z\nplasma electron density on the inner cone path is maintained very low which\nresults in little simulated Raman backscattering and the high-z bubble still\nstays away from the inner cone path without the laser absorption in it, which\nfavor the drive symmetry control. Crossed-beam energy transfer is also\nneglectable because the crossing position is far away from the LEH. The peanut\nhohlraum can provide a good drive environment for capsule to achieve ignition,\nso it is undoubted that it will add to the diversity of ICF approaches.\n", "  The Van der Waals(VdW) phase transition in a hairy black hole is investigated\nby analogizing its charge, temperature, and entropy as the temperature,\npressure, and volume in the fluid respectively. The two point correlation\nfunction(TCF), which is dual to the geodesic length, is employed to probe this\nphase transition. We find the phase structure in the temperature$-$geodesic\nlength plane resembles as that in the temperature$-$thermal entropy plane\nbesides the scale of the horizontal coordinate. In addition, we find the equal\narea law(EAL) for the first order phase transition and critical exponent of the\nheat capacity for the second order phase transition in the\ntemperature$-$geodesic length plane are consistent with that in\ntemperature$-$thermal entropy plane, which implies that the TCF is a good probe\nto probe the phase structure of the back hole.\n", "  This paper addressed the issue of estimating the damage caused by a computer\nvirus. First, an individual-level delayed SIR model capturing the spreading\nprocess of a digital virus is derived. Second, the damage inflicted by the\nvirus is modeled as the sum of the economic losses and the cost for developing\nthe antivirus. Next, the impact of different factors, including the delay and\nthe network structure, on the damage is explored by means of computer\nsimulations. Thereby some measures of reducing the damage of a virus are\nrecommended. To our knowledge, this is the first time the antivirus-developing\ncost is taken into account when estimating the damage of a virus.\n", "  Gravitational deflection of starlight around the Sun during the 1919 total\nsolar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein's general theory of\nrelativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous\nprocess of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby star, the white dwarf\nStein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the\nbackground star's position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at\nmultiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B -- the sixth\nnearest white dwarf to the Sun -- as 0.675 +/- 0.051 solar masses. This mass\ndetermination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and\nlends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.\n", "  Butanol has received significant research attention as a second-generation\nbiofuel in the past few years. In the present study, skeletal mechanisms for\nfour butanol isomers were generated from two widely accepted, well-validated\ndetailed chemical kinetic models for the butanol isomers. The detailed models\nwere reduced using a two-stage approach consisting of the directed relation\ngraph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis. During the reduction\nprocess, issues were encountered with pressure-dependent reactions formulated\nusing the logarithmic pressure interpolation approach; these issues are\ndiscussed and recommendations made to avoid ambiguity in its future\nimplementation in mechanism development. The performance of the skeletal\nmechanisms generated here was compared with that of detailed mechanisms in\nsimulations of autoignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and perfectly\nstirred reactor temperature response curves and extinction residence times,\nover a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. The\ndetailed and skeletal mechanisms agreed well, demonstrating the adequacy of the\nresulting reduced chemistry for all the butanol isomers in predicting global\ncombustion phenomena. In addition, the skeletal mechanisms closely predicted\nthe time-histories of fuel mass fractions in homogeneous compression-ignition\nengine simulations. The performance of each butanol isomer was additionally\ncompared with that of a gasoline surrogate with an antiknock index of 87 in a\nhomogeneous compression-ignition engine simulation. The gasoline surrogate was\nconsumed faster than any of the butanol isomers, with tert-butanol exhibiting\nthe slowest fuel consumption rate. While n-butanol and isobutanol displayed the\nmost similar consumption profiles relative to the gasoline surrogate, the two\nliterature chemical kinetic models predicted different orderings.\n", "  Quantum Hall ferromagnetic transitions are typically achieved by increasing\nthe Zeeman energy through in-situ sample rotation, while transitions in systems\nwith pseudo-spin indices can be induced by gate control. We report here a\ngate-controlled quantum Hall ferromagnetic transition between two real spin\nstates in a conventional two-dimensional system without any in-plane magnetic\nfield. We show that the ratio of the Zeeman splitting to the cyclotron gap in a\nGe two-dimensional hole system increases with decreasing density owing to\ninter-carrier interactions. Below a critical density of $\\sim2.4\\times 10^{10}$\ncm$^{-2}$, this ratio grows greater than $1$, resulting in a ferromagnetic\nground state at filling factor $\\nu=2$. At the critical density, a resistance\npeak due to the formation of microscopic domains of opposite spin orientations\nis observed. Such gate-controlled spin-polarizations in the quantum Hall regime\nopens the door to realizing Majorana modes using two-dimensional systems in\nconventional, low-spin-orbit-coupling semiconductors.\n", "  A harmonic triangular lattice with a vacancy under imposed volumetric strain\nis considered. Simple asymptotic formula for the displacement field is derived.\nThe formula has reasonable accuracy at all lattice nodes. Strain concentration\nfactor, defined as the ratio of the maximal deformation of the bonds adjacent\nto the vacancy to the deformations of bonds at infinity, is calculated. It is\nshown that the asymptotic formula predicts the strain concentration factor with\n4% accuracy. The results are compared with predictions of continuum elasticity\ntheory. Effective diameter of the vacancy is calculated.\n", "  The existence of a new perturbation mode [`self-gravito-acoustic mode'\n(SGAM)] in cold self-gravitating degenerate quantum plasmas (SGDQPs) is\ntheoretically predicted. This new SGAM is developed in the perturbed SGDQPs, in\nwhich the compression is mainly provided by the self-gravitational pressure of\nthe heavy particle species, and the rarefaction is mainly provided by the\ndegenerate pressure of the light particle species. The SGAM is a new\nperturbation mode since it completely disappears if the degenerate pressure of\nthe light particle species is neglected. The prediction of this new SGAM is\napplied in a white dwarf SGDQP.\n", "  We study the collective dynamics of colloidal suspensions in the presence of\na time-dependent potential, by means of dynamical density functional theory. We\nconsider a non-linear diffusion equation for the density and show that spatial\npatterns emerge from a sinusoidal external potential with a time-dependent\nwavelength. These patterns are characterized by a sinusoidal density with the\naverage wavelength and a Bessel-function envelope with an induced wavelength\nthat depends only on the amplitude of the temporal oscillations. As a\ngeneralization of this result, we propose a design strategy to obtain a family\nof spatial patterns using time-dependent potentials of practically arbitrary\nshape.\n", "  Two-dimensional materials offer new opportunities for both fundamental\nscience and technological applications, by exploiting the electron spin. While\ngraphene is very promising for spin communication due to its extraordinary\nelectron mobility, the lack of a band gap restricts its prospects for\nsemiconducting spin devices such as spin diodes and bipolar spin transistors.\nThe recent emergence of 2D semiconductors could help overcome this basic\nchallenge. In this letter we report the first important step towards making 2D\nsemiconductor spin devices. We have fabricated a spin valve based on ultra-thin\n(5 nm) semiconducting black phosphorus (bP), and established fundamental spin\nproperties of this spin channel material which supports all electrical spin\ninjection, transport, precession and detection up to room temperature (RT).\nInserting a few layers of boron nitride between the ferromagnetic electrodes\nand bP alleviates the notorious conductivity mismatch problem and allows\nefficient electrical spin injection into an n-type bP. In the non-local spin\nvalve geometry we measure Hanle spin precession and observe spin relaxation\ntimes as high as 4 ns, with spin relaxation lengths exceeding 6 um. Our\nexperimental results are in a very good agreement with first-principles\ncalculations and demonstrate that Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism is\ndominant. We also demonstrate that spin transport in ultra-thin bP depends\nstrongly on the charge carrier concentration, and can be manipulated by the\nelectric field effect.\n", "  Stabilizing the magnetic signal of single adatoms is a crucial step towards\ntheir successful usage in widespread technological applications such as\nhigh-density magnetic data storage devices. The quantum mechanical nature of\nthese tiny objects, however, introduces intrinsic zero-point spin-fluctuations\nthat tend to destabilize the local magnetic moment of interest by dwindling the\nmagnetic anisotropy potential barrier even at absolute zero temperature. Here,\nwe elucidate the origins and quantify the effect of the fundamental ingredients\ndetermining the magnitude of the fluctuations, namely the ($i$) local magnetic\nmoment, ($ii$) spin-orbit coupling and ($iii$) electron-hole Stoner\nexcitations. Based on a systematic first-principles study of 3d and 4d adatoms,\nwe demonstrate that the transverse contribution of the fluctuations is\ncomparable in size to the magnetic moment itself, leading to a remarkable\n$\\gtrsim$50$\\%$ reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy. Our analysis gives\nrise to a comprehensible diagram relating the fluctuation magnitude to\ncharacteristic features of adatoms, providing practical guidelines for\ndesigning magnetically stable nanomagnets with minimal quantum fluctuations.\n", "  Closeness centrality is one way of measuring how central a node is in the\ngiven network. The closeness centrality measure assigns a centrality value to\neach node based on its accessibility to the whole network. In real life\napplications, we are mainly interested in ranking nodes based on their\ncentrality values. The classical method to compute the rank of a node first\ncomputes the closeness centrality of all nodes and then compares them to get\nits rank. Its time complexity is $O(n \\cdot m + n)$, where $n$ represents total\nnumber of nodes, and $m$ represents total number of edges in the network. In\nthe present work, we propose a heuristic method to fast estimate the closeness\nrank of a node in $O(\\alpha \\cdot m)$ time complexity, where $\\alpha = 3$. We\nalso propose an extended improved method using uniform sampling technique. This\nmethod better estimates the rank and it has the time complexity $O(\\alpha \\cdot\nm)$, where $\\alpha \\approx 10-100$. This is an excellent improvement over the\nclassical centrality ranking method. The efficiency of the proposed methods is\nverified on real world scale-free social networks using absolute and weighted\nerror functions.\n", "  In this work we aim to constrain the slope of the size distribution of\nmain-belt asteroids, at their primordial state. To do so we turn out attention\nto the part of the main asteroid belt between 2.82 and 2.96~AU, the so-called\n\"pristine zone\", which has a low number density of asteroids and few, well\nseparated asteroid families. Exploiting these unique characteristics, and using\na modified version of the hierarchical clustering method we are able to remove\nthe majority of asteroid family members from the region. The remaining,\nbackground asteroids should be of primordial origin, as the strong 5/2 and 7/3\nmean-motion resonances with Jupiter inhibit transfer of asteroids to and from\nthe neighboring regions. The size-frequency distribution of asteroids in the\nsize range $17<D(\\rm{km})<70$ has a slope $q\\simeq-1$. Using Monte-Carlo\nmethods, we are able to simulate, and compensate for the collisional and\ndynamical evolution of the asteroid population, and get an upper bound for its\nsize distribution slope $q=-1.43$. In addition, applying the same 'family\nextraction' method to the neighboring regions, i.e. the middle and outer belts,\nand comparing the size distributions of the respective background populations,\nwe find statistical evidence that no large asteroid families of primordial\norigin had formed in the middle or pristine zones.\n", "  While almost all potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) with a size larger\nthan one kilometre have been discovered, it is well-known that the vast\nmajority of the smaller ones are in fact yet to be found. There is therefore an\nexcellent motivation to consider at once all possible Earth-crossing orbits,\nand to undertake a systematic study of mitigation missions for the entire\nparameter space of orbital elements. It is shown that the whole parameter space\ncan be reduced, without loss of generality, to only three relevant\ndimensionless parameters: the eccentricity and inclination of the asteroid\norbit, and the asteroid true anomaly at impact. Ballistic kinetic-impactor\nmitigation missions are studied for the entire parameter space, considering\ncritical feasibility constraints such as the launcher performance and the\nillumination conditions at deflection. Different classes of optimal solutions\nare found to exist and can be directly linked to asteroid orbital properties.\nThe aim of this work is to help identify an appropriate response to the\npotential threat of a collision of a near-Earth object with our planet, to\nprovide a preliminary mission design, and to determine in which parts of\nparameter space difficulties may arise. (abridged)\n", "  A self-consistent, aeronomic model of the upper atmosphere of a \"hot Jupiter\"\nincluding reactions involving suprathermal photoelectrons is presented. This\nmodel is used to compute the height profiles of the gas density, velocity, and\ntemperature in the atmosphere of the exoplanet HD 209458b. It is shown that\nincluding suprathermal electrons when computing the heating and cooling\nfunctions reduces the mass loss rate of the atmosphere by a factor of five.\n", "  Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which\nstandards of time, length and fundamental constants are determined. Stable\nclocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy as they define the ultimate\nfrequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, where the phase\nof a qubit is used to detect external fields, the clock stability is defined by\nthe qubit coherence time, which determines the spectral linewidth and frequency\nprecision. Here we demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol where the spectral\nprecision goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the stability\nof a classical clock. Using this technique, we observe a precision in frequency\nestimation scaling in time $T$, as $T^{-3/2}$ for classical oscillating fields.\nThe narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to\nsense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency resolution of 607\n$\\mu$Hz, 8 orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.\n", "  During the last 50 years we have been witness of an extraordinary revolution\nin the knowledge and understanding of our star thanks to the development of\nHelioseismology, the study of solar oscillations. Similar to what happens on\nthe Earth during earthquakes, the interior of the Sun is continuously pervaded\nby seismic waves which produce small oscillations on the photosphere. These\noscillations bring the signature of several processes which happen in the\ninterior of the solar structure and the seismic frequencies of the oscillation\nmodes detected on the solar surface are directly related to physical parameters\nof the internal layers crossed by the seismic waves. The study of oscillations\nrepresents, then, the only method to infer directly the internal structure and\ndynamics of the Sun. This article will present the general characteristics of\nsolar oscillations, the main important results and the advances obtained in\nstellar physics thanks to the methods of Helioseismology.\n", "  This is the first part in a series of two papers that concern with the\nquantitative analysis of the electromagnetic field enhancement and anomalous\ndiffraction by a periodic array of subwavelength slits. The scattering problem\nin the diffraction regime is investigated in this part, for which the size of\nthe period is comparable to the incident wavelength. We distinguish scattering\nresonances and real eigenvalues, and derive their asymptotic expansions when\nthey are away from the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies. Furthermore, we present\nquantitative analysis of the field enhancement at resonant frequencies, by\nquantifying both the enhancement order and the associated resonant modes. The\nfield enhancement near the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies is also investigated.\nIt is demonstrated that the field enhancement becomes weaker at the resonant\nfrequency if it is close to the Rayleigh cut-off frequencies. Finally, we also\ncharacterize the embedded eigenvalues for the underlying periodic structure,\nand point out that transmission anomaly such as Fano resonant phenomenon does\nnot occur for the narrow slit array.\n", "  This is the second part in a series of two papers that concern with the\nquantitative analysis of the electromagnetic field enhancement and anomalous\ndiffraction by a periodic array of subwavelength slits. In this part, we\nexplore the scattering problem in the homogenization regimes, where the size of\nthe period is much smaller than the incident wavelength. In particular, two\nhomogenization regimes are investigated, where the size of the pattered slits\nhas the same order as the size of the period in the first configuration, and\nthe size of the slit is much smaller than the size of the period in the second\nconfiguration. By presenting rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that\nsurface plasmonic effect mimicking that of plasmonic metals occurs in the first\nhomogenization regime. The corresponding dispersion curve lies below the light\nline and the associated eigenmodes are surface bound sates. In addition, for\nthe incident plane wave, we discover and justify a novel phenomenon of total\ntransmission which occurs either at certain frequencies for all incident\nangles, or at a special incident angle but for all frequencies. For the second\nhomogenization regime, the non-resonant field enhancement is investigated, and\nit is shown that the fast transition of the magnetic field in the slit induces\nstrong electric field enhancement. Moreover, the enhancement becomes stronger\nwhen the coupling of the slits is weaker.\n", "  Multifunctional three-dimensional (3-D) nano-architectures, integrating all\ndevice components within tens of nanometers, offer great promise for next\ngeneration electrical energy storage applications, but have remained\nchallenging to achieve. The lack of appropriate synthesis methods, enabling\nprecise 3-D spatial control at the nanoscale, remains a key issue holding back\nthe development of such intricate architectures. Here we present an approach to\nsuch systems based on the bottom-up synthesis of penta-continuous nanohybrid\nmonoliths with four functional components integrated in a triblock terpolymer\nderived core-shell double gyroid architecture. Two distinct 3 D\ninterpenetrating networks serving as cathode and current collector are\nseparated from a carbon anode matrix by continuous, ultrathin polymer\nelectrolyte shells. All periodically ordered domains are less than 20 nm in\ntheir layer dimensions and integrated throughout the macroscopic monolith.\nInitial electrochemical measurements with the Li-ion/S system exhibit\nreversible battery-like charge-discharge characteristics with orders of\nmagnitude decreases in footprint area over conventional flat thin layer\ndesigns.\n", "  CELES is a freely available MATLAB toolbox to simulate light scattering by\nmany spherical particles. Aiming at high computational performance, CELES\nleverages block-diagonal preconditioning, a lookup-table approach to evaluate\ncostly functions and massively parallel execution on NVIDIA graphics processing\nunits using the CUDA computing platform. The combination of these techniques\nallows to efficiently address large electrodynamic problems ($>10^4$\nscatterers) on inexpensive consumer hardware. In this paper, we validate near-\nand far-field distributions against the well-established multi-sphere\n$T$-matrix (MSTM) code and discuss the convergence behavior for ensembles of\ndifferent sizes, including an exemplary system comprising $10^5$ particles.\n", "  Measures for research activity and impact have become an integral ingredient\nin the assessment of a wide range of entities (individual researchers,\norganizations, instruments, regions, disciplines). Traditional bibliometric\nindicators, like publication and citation based indicators, provide an\nessential part of this picture, but cannot describe the complete picture. Since\nreading scholarly publications is an essential part of the research life cycle,\nit is only natural to introduce measures for this activity in attempts to\nquantify the efficiency, productivity and impact of an entity. Citations and\nreads are significantly different signals, so taken together, they provide a\nmore complete picture of research activity. Most scholarly publications are now\naccessed online, making the study of reads and their patterns possible.\nClick-stream logs allow us to follow information access by the entire research\ncommunity, real-time. Publication and citation datasets just reflect activity\nby authors. In addition, download statistics will help us identify publications\nwith significant impact, but which do not attract many citations. Click-stream\nsignals are arguably more complex than, say, citation signals. For one, they\nare a superposition of different classes of readers. Systematic downloads by\ncrawlers also contaminate the signal, as does browsing behavior. We discuss the\ncomplexities associated with clickstream data and how, with proper filtering,\nstatistically significant relations and conclusions can be inferred from\ndownload statistics. We describe how download statistics can be used to\ndescribe research activity at different levels of aggregation, ranging from\norganizations to countries. These statistics show a correlation with\nsocio-economic indicators. A comparison will be made with traditional\nbibliometric indicators. We will argue that astronomy is representative of more\ngeneral trends.\n", "  The formation of the two: injected (\"coherent\") and \"thermally\" excited,\ndifferent in energies magnon subsystems and the influence of its interaction\nwith phonons and between on drag effect under spin Seebeck effect conditions in\nthe magnetic insulator part of the metal/ferromagnetic insulator/metal\nstructure is studied. An approximation of the effective parameters, when each\nof the interacting subsystems (\"injected\", \"thermal\" magnons, and phonons) is\ncharacterized by its own effective temperature and drift velocities have been\nconsidered. The analysis of the macroscopic momentum balance equations of the\nsystems of interest conducted for different ratios of the drift velocities of\nthe magnon and phonon currents show that the \"injected\" magnons relaxation on\nthe \"thermal\" ones is possible to be dominant over its relaxation on phonons.\nThis interaction will be the defining in the forming of the temperature\ndependence of the spin-wave current under spin Seebeck effect conditions, and\ninelastic part of the magnon-magnon interaction is the dominant spin relaxation\nmechanism.\n", "  Many of the basic ideas in multiparton interaction (MPI) phenomenology were\nfirst developed in the context of the PYTHIA event generator, and MPIs have\nbeen central in its modelling of both minimum-bias and underlying-event physics\nin one unified framework. This chapter traces the evolution towards an\nincreasingly sophisticated description of MPIs in PYTHIA, including topics such\nas the ordering of MPIs, the regularization of the divergent QCD cross section,\nthe impact-parameter picture, colour reconnection, multiparton PDFs and beam\nremnants, interleaved and intertwined evolution, and diffraction.\n", "  The significant halogenation effects on the essential properties of graphene\nare investigated by the first-principles method. The geometric structures,\nelectronic properties, and magnetic configurations are greatly diversified\nunder the various halogen adsorptions. Fluorination, with the strong\nmulti-orbital chemical bondings, can create the buckled graphene structure,\nwhile the other halogenations do not change the planar {\\sigma} bonding in the\npresence of single-orbital hybridization. Electronic structures consist of the\ncarbon-, adatom- and (carbon, adatom)-dominated energy bands. All halogenated\ngraphenes belong to hole-doped metals except that fluorinated systems are\nmiddle-gap semiconductors at sufficiently high concentration. Moreover, the\nmetallic ferromagnetism is revealed in certain adatom distributions. The\nunusual hybridization-induced features are clearly evidenced in many van Hove\nsingularities of the density of states. The structure- and adatom-enriched\nessential properties are compared with the measured results, and potential\napplications are also discussed.\n", "  In this article, we prove sub-ballisticity for a class of self-repelling\npolymers inZ^d. Self-repelling polymers are a two-way generalization of the\nmodel of self-avoiding walks, for which the sub-ballisticity was proved by H.\nDuminil-Copin and A. Hammond. Namely, we consider an arbitrary finite symmetric\ndistribution of steps and a more flexible penalization for self-intersections\nthan in the self-avoiding walks model.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics has an important role when designing modern synchrotron\nlattices. In this letter, we introduce a new method of using a square matrix to\nanalyze periodic nonlinear dynamical systems [1, 2]. Applying the method to the\nNational Synchrotron Light Source II storage ring lattice has helped to\nmitigate the chaotic motion within its dynamic aperture. For a given dynamical\nsystem, the vector space of a square matrix can be separated into different low\ndimension invariant subspaces according to their eigenvalues. When Jordan\ndecomposition is applied to one of the eigenspaces, it yields a set of accurate\naction-angle variables. The distortion of the new action-angle variables\nprovides a measure of the nonlinearity. Our studies show that the common\nconvention of confining the tune-shift with amplitude to avoid the crossing of\nresonance lines may not be absolutely necessary. We demonstrate that the third\norder resonance can be almost perfectly compensated with this technique. The\nmethod itself is general, and could be applied to other nonlinear systems.\n", "  Our aim is to evaluate fundamental parameters from the analysis of the\nelectromagnetic spectra of stars. We may use $10^3$-$10^5$ spectra; each\nspectrum being a vector with $10^2$-$10^4$ coordinates. We thus face the\nso-called \"curse of dimensionality\". We look for a method to reduce the size of\nthis data-space, keeping only the most relevant information.As a reference\nmethod, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.\nHowever, PCA is an unsupervised method, therefore its subspace was not\nconsistent with the parameter. We thus tested a supervised method based on\nSliced Inverse Regression (SIR), which provides a subspace consistent with the\nparameter. It also shares analogies with factorial discriminant analysis: the\nmethod slices the database along the parameter variation, and builds the\nsubspace which maximizes the inter-slice variance, while standardizing the\ntotal projected variance of the data. Nevertheless the performances of SIR were\nnot satisfying in standard usage, because of the non-monotonicity of the\nunknown function linking the data to the parameter and because of the noise\npropagation. We show that better performances can be achieved by selecting the\nmost relevant directions for parameter inference. Preliminary tests are\nperformed on synthetic pseudo-line profiles plus noise. Using one direction, we\nshow that compared to PCA, the error associated with SIR is 50$\\%$ smaller on a\nnon-linear parameter, and 70$\\%$ smaler on a linear parameter. Moreover, using\na selected direction, the error is 80$\\%$ smaller for a non-linear parameter,\nand 95$\\%$ smaller for a linear parameter.\n", "  A mirror that reflects light fully and yet is transparent appears\nparadoxical. Current so-called transparent or \"one-way\" mirrors are not\nperfectly reflective and thus can be distinguished from a standard mirror.\nConstructing a transparent \"perfect\" mirror has profound implications for\nsecurity, privacy, and camouflage. However, such a hypothetical device cannot\nbe implemented in a passive structure. We demonstrate here a transparent\nperfect mirror in a non-Hermitian configuration: an active optical cavity where\na certain prelasing gain extinguishes Poynting's vector at the device entrance.\nAt this threshold, all vestiges of the cavity's structural resonances are\neliminated and the device presents spectrally flat unity-reflectivity, thus,\nbecoming indistinguishable from a perfect mirror when probed optically across\nthe gain bandwidth. Nevertheless, the device is rendered transparent by virtue\nof persisting amplified transmission resonances. We confirm these predictions\nin two photonic realizations: a compact integrated active waveguide and a\nmacroscopic all-optical-fiber system.\n", "  We present a construction of the Jacobi-Maupertuis (JM) principle for an\nequation of the Lienard type, viz \\ddot{x} + f(x)x^2 + g(x) = 0 using Jacobi's\nlast multiplier. The JM metric allows us to reformulate the Newtonian equation\nof motion for a variable mass as a geodesic equation for a Riemannian metric.\nWe illustrate the procedure with examples of Painleve-Gambier XXI, the Jacobi\nequation and the Henon-Heiles system.\n", "  The study of the properties of quantum particles in a periodic potential\nsubject to a magnetic field is an active area of research both in physics and\nmathematics; it has been and it is still deeply investigated. In this review we\ndiscuss how to implement and describe tunable Abelian magnetic fields in a\nsystem of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. After discussing two of the main\nexperimental schemes for the physical realization of synthetic gauge potentials\nin ultracold set-ups, we study cubic lattice tight-binding models with\ncommensurate flux. We finally examine applications of gauge potentials in\none-dimensional rings.\n", "  The occurrence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is\ninvestigated in heavily boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond films through a\ncombination of current-voltage and resistance measurements. We observe a robust\nBKT transition in the nanocrystalline diamond films with smaller grain size\nalong with transport features related to vortex pinning. The vortex core energy\ndetermined through analysis of the resistance temperature curves was found to\nbe anti-correlated to the BKT transition temperatures. It is also observed that\nthe higher BKT temperature is related to an increased vortex-antivortex binding\nenergy derived from the activated transport regions. Further, the magnetic\nfield induced superconductor insulator transition shows the possibility of the\ncharge glass state. The consequences of granularity such as localization and\nvortex pinning can lead to tuneable BKT temperatures and strongly affects the\nfield induced insulating state.\n"]}
