Both the short-range (SR)\ncontribution, originating from the correlation between multiplicities produced\nfrom a single source, and the long-range (LR) contribution, originating from\nthe fluctuation in the number of sources, are taken into account. The\ndependencies of the FB correlation coefficient, $b$, on the windows' rapidity\nand azimuthal acceptance and the gaps between these windows are studied and\ncompared with the preliminary data of ALICE. The analysis of these dependencies\neffectively separates the contributions of two above mechanisms. It is also\ndemonstrated that traditional definitions of FB correlation coefficient $b$\nhave a strong nonlinear dependence on the acceptance of windows. Suitable\nalternative observables for the future FB correlation studies are proposed. The\nconnection between $b$ and the two-particle correlation function, $C_2$, is\ntraced, as well as its connection to the untriggered di-hadron correlation\nanalysis. Using a model independent analysis, it is shown that measurement of\nthe FB multiplicity correlations between two small windows separated in\nrapidity and azimuth fully determine the two-particle correlation function\n$C_2$, even if the particle distribution in rapidity is not uniform.\n", "  The nature of E1 low-energy strength (LES), often denoted as a \"pygmy dipole\nresonance\", is analyzed within the random-phase-approximation (RPA) in\n$^{208}$Pb using Skyrme forces in fully self-consistent manner. A first\noverview is given by the strength functions for the dipole, compressional and\ntoroidal operators. More detailed insight is gained by averaged transition\ndensities and currents where the latter provide very illustrative flow pattern.\nThe analysis reveals clear isoscalar toroidal flow in the low-energy bin\n6.0-8.8 MeV of the LES and a mixed isoscalar/isovector toroidal/compression\nflow in the higher bin 8.8-10.5 MeV. Thus the modes covered by LES embrace both\nvortical and irrotational motion. The simple collective picture of the LES as a\n\"pygmy\" mode (oscillations of the neutron excess against the nuclear core) is\nnot confirmed.\n", "  Using our anholonomic frame deformation method, we show how generic\noff-diagonal cosmological solutions depending, in general, on all spacetime\ncoordinates and undergoing a phase of ultra-slow contraction can be constructed\nin massive gravity. In this paper, there are found and studied new classes of\nlocally anisotropic and (in) homogeneous cosmological metrics with open and\nclosed spatial geometries. The late time acceleration is present due to\neffective cosmological terms induced by nonlinear off-diagonal interactions and\ngraviton mass. The off-diagonal cosmological metrics and related St\\\" uckelberg\nfields are constructed in explicit form up to nonholonomic frame transforms of\nthe Friedmann-Lama\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) coordinates. We show that the\nsolutions include matter, graviton mass and other effective sources modelling\nnonlinear gravitational and matter fields interactions in modified and/or\nmassive gravity, with polarization of physical constants and deformations of\nmetrics, which may explain certain dark energy and dark matter effects. There\nare stated and analyzed the conditions when such configurations mimic\ninteresting solutions in general relativity and modifications and recast the\ngeneral Painlev\\'e--ullstrand and FLRW metrics. Finally, we elaborate on a\nreconstruction procedure for a subclass of off-diagonal cosmological solutions\nwhich describe cyclic and ekpyrotic universes, with an emphasis on open issues\nand observable signatures.\n", "  Background: Theoretical calculations of the four-particle scattering above\nthe four-cluster breakup threshold are technically very difficult due to\nnontrivial singularities or boundary conditions. Further complications arise\nwhen the long-range Coulomb force is present.\n  Purpose: We aim at calculating proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering observables\nabove three- and four-cluster breakup threshold.\n  Methods: We employ Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations for the\nfour-nucleon transition operators and solve them in the momentum-space\nframework using the complex-energy method whose accuracy and practical\napplicability is improved by a special integration method.\n  Results: Using realistic nuclear interaction models we obtain fully converged\nresults for the proton-${}^3$He elastic scattering. The differential cross\nsection, proton and ${}^3$He analyzing powers, spin correlation and spin\ntransfer coefficients are calculated at proton energies ranging from 7 to 35\nMeV. Effective three- and four-nucleon forces are included via the explicit\nexcitation of a nucleon to a $\\Delta$ isobar.\n  Conclusions: Realistic proton-${}^3$He scattering calculations above the\nfour-nucleon breakup threshold are feasible. There is quite good agreement\nbetween the theoretical predictions and experimental data for the\nproton-${}^3$He scattering in the considered energy regime. The most remarkable\ndisagreements are the peak of the proton analyzing power at lower energies and\nthe minimum of the differential cross section at higher energies. Inclusion of\nthe $\\Delta$ isobar reduces the latter discrepancy.\n", "  The core excitation, being an important reaction mechanism, so far is not\nproperly included in most calculations of three-body nuclear reactions. We aim\nto include the excitation of the core nucleus using an exact Faddeev-type\nframework for nuclear reactions in the three-body (core + neutron + proton)\nsystem. We employ Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) integral equations for\nthe three-particle transition operators and solve them in the momentum-space\nframework. The Coulomb interaction is included via the method of screening and\nrenormalization. We calculate elastic, inelastic, and transfer reactions\ninvolving 10Be and 24Mg nuclear cores. Important effects of the core excitation\nare found, often improving the description of the experimental data. In the\nneutron transfer reactions the core excitation effect is by far not just a\nsimple reduction of the cross section by the respective spectroscopic factor.\nThis indicates that widely used extraction of the spectroscopic factors from\nthe ratio of the experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections is\nunreliable approach.\n", "  We consider the focusing 3D quantum many-body dynamic which models a dilute\nbose gas strongly confined in two spatial directions. We assume that the\nmicroscopic pair interaction is attractive and given by\n$a^{3\\beta-1}V(a^{\\beta}\\cdot)$ where $\\int V\\leqslant 0$ and $a$ matches the\nGross-Pitaevskii scaling condition. We carefully examine the effects of the\nfine interplay between the strength of the confining potential and the number\nof particles on the 3D $N$-body dynamic. We overcome the difficulties generated\nby the attractive interaction in 3D and establish new focusing energy\nestimates. We study the corresponding BBGKY hierarchy which contains a\ndiverging coefficient as the strength of the confining potential tends to\n$\\infty $. We prove that the limiting structure of the density matrices\ncounterbalances this diverging coefficient. We establish the convergence of the\nBBGKY sequence and hence the propagation of chaos for the focusing quantum\nmany-body system. We derive rigorously the 1D focusing cubic NLS as the\nmean-field limit of this 3D focusing quantum many-body dynamic and obtain the\nexact 3D to 1D coupling constant.\n", "  Exact four-body equations of Alt, Grassberger and Sandhas are solved for\nneutron-${}^3\\mathrm{He}$ and proton-${}^3\\mathrm{H}$ scattering in the energy\nregime above the four-nucleon breakup threshold. Cross sections and spin\nobservables for elastic, transfer, charge-exchange, and breakup reactions are\ncalculated using realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction models, including the\none with effective many-nucleon forces due to explicit $\\Delta$-isobar\nexcitation. The experimental data are described reasonably well with only few\nexceptions such as vector analyzing powers.\n", "  Microscopic calculations of four-body collisions become very challenging in\nthe energy regime above the threshold for four free particles. The\nneutron-${}^3$He scattering is an example of such process with elastic,\nrearrangement, and breakup channels. We aim to calculate observables for\nelastic and inelastic neutron-${}^3$He reactions up to 30 MeV neutron energy\nusing realistic nuclear force models. We solve the Alt, Grassberger, and\nSandhas (AGS) equations for the four-nucleon transition operators in the\nmomentum-space framework. The complex-energy method with special integration\nweights is applied to deal with the complicated singularities in the kernel of\nAGS equations. We obtain fully converged results for the differential cross\nsection and neutron analyzing power in the neutron-${}^3$He elastic scattering\nas well as the total cross sections for inelastic reactions. Several realistic\npotentials are used, including the one with an explicit $\\Delta$ isobar\nexcitation. There is reasonable agreement between the theoretical predictions\nand experimental data for the neutron-${}^3$He scattering in the considered\nenergy regime. The most remarkable disagreements are seen around the minimum of\nthe differential cross section and the extrema of the neutron analyzing power.\nThe breakup cross section increases with energy exceeding rearrangement\nchannels above 23 MeV.\n", "  We present a general parametrization for the leading order terms in a\nmomentum power expansion of a non-universal Lorentz-violating, but rotational\ninvariant, kinematics and its implications for two-body decay thresholds. The\nconsidered framework includes not only modified dispersion relations for\nparticles, but also modified energy-momentum conservation laws, something which\ngoes beyond effective field theory. As a particular and relevant example,\nbounds on the departures from special relativistic kinematics from the\nnon-observation of vacuum Cherenkov radiation are discussed and compared with\nthose obtained within the effective field theory scenario.\n", "  Proton-${}^3$H elastic scattering and charge-exchange reaction\n${}^3$H$(p,n){}^3$He in the energy regime above four-nucleon breakup threshold\nare described in the momentum-space transition operator framework. Fully\nconverged results are obtained using realistic two-nucleon potentials and\ntwo-proton Coulomb force as dynamic input.\n  Differential cross section, proton analyzing power, outgoing neutron\npolarization, and proton-to-neutron polarization transfer coefficients are\ncalculated between 6 and 30 MeV proton beam energy. Good agreement with the\nexperimental data is found for the differential cross section both in elastic\nand charge-exchange reactions; the latter shows a complicated energy and\nangular dependence. The most sizable discrepancies between predictions and data\nare found for the proton analyzing power and outgoing neutron polarization in\nthe charge-exchange reaction, while the respective proton-to-neutron\npolarization transfer coefficients are well described by the calculations.\n", "  Rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement factors for the identified\nparticles have been studied with the help of a string based hadronic transport\nmodel UrQMD-3.3 (Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) at FAIR\nenergies. A strong rapidity dependent strangeness enhancement could be observed\nwith our generated data for $Au + Au$ collisions at the beam energy of\n30\\textit{A} GeV. The strangeness enhancement is found to be maximum at\nmid-rapidity for the particles containing leading quarks while for particles\nconsisting of produced quarks only, the situation is seen to be otherwise. Such\nrapidity dependent strangeness enhancement could be traced back to the\ndependence of rapidity width on centrality or otherwise on the distribution of\nnet-baryon density.\n", "  The lowest quadrupole $\\gamma$-vibrational $K^{\\pi}=2^+$ states in axially\ndeformed rare-earth (Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb, Hf, W) and actinide (U) nuclei are\nsystematically investigated within the separable random-phase-approximation\n(SRPA) based on the Skyrme functional. The energies $E_{\\gamma}$ and reduced\ntransition probabilities $B(E2)$ of $2^+_{\\gamma}$-states are calculated with\nthe Skyrme forces SV-bas and SkM$^*$. The energies of two-quasiparticle\nconfigurations forming the SRPA basis are corrected by using the pairing\nblocking effect. This results in a systematic downshift of $E_{\\gamma}$ by\n0.3-0.5 MeV and thus in a better agreement with the experiment, especially in\nSm, Gd, Dy, Hf, and W regions. For other isotopic chains, a noticeable\noverestimation of $E_{\\gamma}$ and too weak collectivity of\n$2^+_{\\gamma}$-states still persist. It is shown that domains of nuclei with a\nlow and high $2^+_{\\gamma}$ -collectivity are related with the structure of the\nlowest 2-quasiparticle states and conservation of the Nilsson selection rules.\nThe description of $2^+_{\\gamma}$ states with SV-bas and SkM$^*$ is similar in\nlight rare-earth nuclei but deviates in heavier nuclei. However SV-bas much\nbetter reproduces the quadrupole deformation and energy of the isoscalar giant\nquadrupole resonance. The accuracy of SRPA is justified by comparison with\nexact RPA. The calculations suggest that a further development of the\nself-consistent calculation schemes is needed for a systematic satisfactory\ndescription of the $2^+_{\\gamma}$ states.\n", "  The system of three ${}^4\\mathrm{He}$ atoms with realistic interactions is\nstudied in the momentum-space framework. It is demonstrated that short and\nlong-range difficulties encountered in the coordinate-space calculations can be\nreliably resolved in the momentum-space calculations. Well-converged and\naccurate results are obtained for the ground and excited trimer energies,\natom-dimer scattering length, phase shifts, inelasticity parameters, and\nelastic and breakup cross sections. A significant correction to previously\npublished results is found for the elastic cross section at very low energy.\n", "  We argue that a finite iteration of any surface fractal can be composed of\nmass-fractal iterations of the same fractal dimension. Within this assertion,\nthe scattering amplitude of surface fractal is shown to be a sum of the\namplitudes of composing mass fractals. Various approximations for the\nscattering intensity of surface fractal are considered. It is shown that\nsmall-angle scattering (SAS) from a surface fractal can be explained in terms\nof power-law distribution of sizes of objects composing the fractal (internal\npolydispersity), provided the distance between objects is much larger than\ntheir size for each composing mass fractal. The power-law decay of the\nscattering intensity $I(q) \\propto q^{D_{\\mathrm{s}}-6}$, where $2 <\nD_{\\mathrm{s}} < 3$ is the surface fractal dimension of the system, is realized\nas a non-coherent sum of scattering amplitudes of three-dimensional objects\ncomposing the fractal and obeying a power-law distribution $d N(r) \\propto\nr^{-\\tau} dr$, with $D_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\tau-1$. The distribution is continuous for\nrandom fractals and discrete for deterministic fractals. We suggest a model of\nsurface deterministic fractal, the surface Cantor-like fractal, which is a sum\nof three-dimensional Cantor dusts at various iterations, and study its\nscattering properties. The present analysis allows us to extract additional\ninformation from SAS data, such us the edges of the fractal region, the fractal\niteration number and the scaling factor.\n", "  Fully converged calculations of deuteron-deuteron elastic scattering\nobservables are performed at energies above three- and four-body breakup\nthreshold. Differential cross sections and analyzing powers are obtained using\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon force models together with the Coulomb repulsion\nbetween protons. For all observables we find a very reasonable agreement with\nthe available experimental data limited to deuteron beam energies up to 25.3\nMeV.\n", "  The gravitational deflection of light ray is an important prediction of\nGeneral Theory of Relativity. In this paper we develop analytical expression of\nthe deflection of light ray without any weak field approximation due to a\ncharged gravitational body represented by Reissner_Nordstr\\\"om (RN) and\nJanis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) space time geometry, using material medium\napproach. It is concluded that although both the geometries represent the\ncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric gravitating body, but the effect\nof charge on the gravitational deflection is just opposite to each other. The\ngravitational deflection decreases with charge in the RN geometry and increases\nwith charge in the JNW geometry. The calculations obtained here are compared\nwith other methods done by different authors. The formalism is applied to an\narbitrary selected pulsar PSRB1937+21 as a gravitating body, as a test case.\n", "  We present a galaxy classification system for 238 (E1-Sdm) CALIFA (Calar Alto\nLegacy Integral Field Area) galaxies based on the shapes and amplitudes of\ntheir circular velocity curves (CVCs). We infer the CVCs from the de-projected\nsurface brightness of the galaxies, after scaling by a constant mass-to-light\nratio based on stellar dynamics - solving axisymmetric Jeans equations via\nfitting the second velocity moment $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}=\\sqrt{V^2+\\sigma^2}$ of\nthe stellar kinematics. We use principal component analysis (PCA) applied to\nthe CVC shapes to find characteristic features and use a $k$-means classifier\nto separate circular curves into classes. This objective classification method\nidentifies four different classes, which we name slow-rising (SR), flat (FL),\nround-peaked (RP) and sharp-peaked (SP) circular curves.\n  SR are typical for low-mass, late-type (Sb-Sdm), young, faint, metal-poor and\ndisc-dominated galaxies. SP are typical for high-mass, early-type (E1-E7), old,\nbright, metal-rich and bulge-dominated galaxies. FL and RP appear presented by\ngalaxies with intermediate mass, age, luminosity, metallicity, bulge-to-disk\nratio and morphologies (E4-S0a, Sa-Sbc). The discrepancy mass factor,\n$f_d=1-M_{*}/M_{dyn}$, have the largest value for SR and SP classes ($\\sim$ 74\nper cent and $\\sim$ 71 per cent, respectively) in contrast to the FL and RP\nclasses (with $\\sim$ 59 per cent and $\\sim$ 61 per cent, respectively).\nCircular curve classification presents an alternative to typical morphological\nclassification and appears more tightly linked to galaxy evolution.\n", "  We present a formulation of quantum molecular dynamics that includes electron\ncorrelation effects via the Gutzwiller method. Our new scheme enables the study\nof the dynamical behavior of atoms and molecules with strong electron\ninteractions. The Gutzwiller approach goes beyond the conventional mean-field\ntreatment of the intra-atomic electron repulsion and captures crucial\ncorrelation effects such as band narrowing and electron localization. We use\nGutzwiller quantum molecular dynamics to investigate the Mott transition in the\nliquid phase of a single-band metal and uncover intriguing structural and\ntransport properties of the atoms.\n", "  We study the Andrews-Gordon-Bressoud (AGB) generalisations of the\nRogers-Ramanujan q-series identities in the context of cylindric partitions. We\nrecall the definition of r-cylindric partitions, and provide a simple proof of\nBorodin's product expression for their generating functions, that can be\nregarded as a limiting case of an unpublished proof by Krattenthaler. We also\nrecall the relationships between the r-cylindric partition generating\nfunctions, the principal characters of affine sl_r algebras, the M^{r, r+d}_r\nminimal model characters of W_r algebras, and the r-string abaci generating\nfunctions, as well as the relationships between them, providing simple proofs\nfor each.\n  We then set r=2, and use 2-cylindric partitions to re-derive the AGB\nidentities as follows. Firstly, we use Borodin's product expression for the\ngenerating functions of the 2-cylindric partitions with infinitely-long parts,\nto obtain the product sides of the AGB identities, times a factor (q;\nq)_{\\infty}^{-1}, which is the generating function of ordinary partitions.\nNext, we obtain a bijection from the 2-cylindric partitions, via 2-string\nabaci, into decorated versions of Bressoud's restricted lattice paths.\nExtending Bressoud's method of transforming between restricted paths that obey\ndifferent restrictions, we obtain sum expressions with manifestly non-negative\ncoefficients for the generating functions of the 2-cylindric partitions which\ncontains a factor (q; q)_{\\infty}^{-1}. Equating the product and sum\nexpressions of the same 2-cylindric partitions, and canceling a factor of (q;\nq)_{\\infty}^{-1} on each side, we obtain the AGB identities.\n", "  Exact Faddeev-type three-body equations are applied to the study of the\nproton transfer reactions $(d,n)$ in the system consisting of a nuclear core\nand two nucleons. The integral equations for the three-body transition\noperators are solved in the momentum-space framework including the Coulomb\ninteraction via the screening and renormalization method. For a weakly bound\nfinal nucleus the calculation of the $(d,n)$ reaction is more demanding in\nterms of the screening radius as compared to the $(d,p)$ reaction. Well\nconverged differential cross section results are obtained for\n$^{7}{Be}(d,n)^{8}{B}$, $^{12}{C}(d,n)^{13}{N}$, and $^{16}{O}(d,n)^{17}{F}$\nreactions. A comparison with the corresponding $(d,p)$ reactions is made. The\ncalculations fail to reproduce the shape of the angular distribution for\nreactions on $^{12}{C}$ but provide quite successful description for reactions\non $^{16}{O}$, especially for the transfer to the $^{17}{F}$ excited state\n$1/2^+$ when using a nonlocal optical potential.\n", "  The evolution of the spatial degrees of freedom of a photon propagating\nthrough atmospheric turbulence is treated as a non-Markovian process. Here, we\nderive and solve the evolution equation for this process. The turbulent medium\nis modeled by a sequence of multiple phase screens for general turbulence\nconditions. The non-Markovian perspective leads to a second-order differential\nequation with respect to the propagation distance. The solution for this\ndifferential equation is obtained with the aid of a perturbative analysis,\nassuming the turbulence is relatively weak. We also provide another solution\nfor more general turbulence strength, but where we introduced a simplification\nto the differential equation.\n", "  We review a recent progress in investigation of the isoscalar toroidal dipole\nresonance (TDR). A possible relation of the TDR and low-energy dipole strength\n(also called a pygmy resonance) is analyzed. It is shown that the dipole\nstrength in the pygmy region can by understood as a local manifestation of the\ncollective vortical toroidal motion at the nuclear surface. Application of the\nTDR as a measure of the nuclear dipole vorticity is discussed. Finally, an\nanomalous splitting of the TDR in deformed nuclei is scrutinized.\n", "  Submerged granular hoppers exhibit an unexpected surge in discharge rate as\nthey empty [Wilson et al. 2015]. With a more sensitive apparatus, we find that\nthis surge depends on hopper diameter and also happens in air --- though the\neffect is smaller and previously unnoticed. We also find that the surge may be\nturned off by fixing the rate of fluid flow through the granular packing. With\nno flow control, dye injected on top of the packing gets drawn into the grains,\nat a rate that increases as the hopper empties. Thus we conclude that the surge\nis caused by a self-generated pumping of fluid through the packing. We\nsuccessfully model this effect via a driving pressure set by the dilation of\ngrains as they exit. This highlights a surprising and unrecognized role that\ninterstitial fluid plays in setting the discharge rate, and likely also in\ncontrolling clog formation, for granular hoppers whether in air or under water.\n", "  The association between polyelectrolytes (PEs) of the same size but opposite\ncharge is systematically studied in terms of the potential of mean force (PMF)\nalong their center-of-mass reaction coordinate via coarse-grained,\nimplicit-solvent, explicit-salt computer simulations. The focus is set on the\nonset and the intermediate, transient stages of complexation. At conditions\nabove the counterion-condensation threshold, the PE association process\nexhibits a distinct sliding-rod-like behavior where the polymer chains approach\neach other by first stretching out at a critical distance close to their\ncontour length, then 'shaking hand' and sliding along each other in a parallel\nfashion, before eventually folding into a neutral complex. The essential part\nof the PMF for highly charged PEs can be very well described by a simple theory\nbased on sliding charged `Debye--H\\\"uckel' rods with renormalized charges in\naddition to an explicit entropy contribution owing to the release of condensed\ncounterions. Interestingly, at the onset of complex formation, the mean force\nbetween the PE chains is found to be discontinuous, reflecting a bimodal\nstructural behavior that arises from the coexistence of interconnected-rod and\nisolated-coil states. These two microstates of the PE complex are balanced by\nsubtle counterion release effects and separated by a free-energy barrier due to\nunfavorable stretching entropy.\n", "  Photonic waveguide arrays provide an excellent platform for simulating\nconventional topological systems, and they can also be employed for the study\nof novel topological phases in photonics systems. However, a direct measurement\nof bulk topological invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study\ntopological features of generalized commensurate Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper (AAH)\nphotonic waveguide arrays and construct a topological phase diagram by\ncalculating all bulk Chern numbers, and then explore the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence by analyzing the topological edge states and their winding\nnumbers. In contrast to incommensurate AAH models, diagonal and off-diagonal\ncommensurate AAH models are not topologically equivalent. In particular, there\nappear nontrivial topological phases with large Chern numbers and topological\nphase transitions. By implementing Thouless pumping of light in photonic\nwaveguide arrays, we propose a simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers.\n", "  We present results for the three-cluster breakup in deuteron-deuteron\ncollisions at 130 and 270 MeV deuteron beam energy. The breakup amplitude is\ncalculated using the first term in the Neumann series expansion of the\ncorresponding exact four-nucleon equations. In analogy with nucleon-deuteron\nbreakup where an equivalent approximation is compared with exact calculations,\nwe expect this single-scattering approximation to provide a rough estimation of\nthree-body breakup observables in quasifree configurations. We predict the\nnucleon-deuteron and deuteron-deuteron three-cluster breakup cross sections to\nbe of a comparable size and thereby question the reliability of the recent\nexperimental data [A. Ramazani-Moghaddam-Arani, Ph.D. thesis, University of\nGroningen, 2009; A. Ramazani-Moghaddam-Arani et al., EPJ Web of Conferences 3,\n04012 (2010)] that is smaller by about three orders of magnitude. We also show\nthat an equivalent single-scattering approximation provides a reasonable\ndescription of deuteron-deuteron elastic scattering at forward scattering\nangles.\n", "  Granular conductors form an artificially engineered class of solid state\nmaterials wherein the microstructure can be tuned to mimic a wide range of\notherwise inaccessible physical systems. At the same time, topological\ninsulators (TIs) have become a cornerstone of modern condensed matter physics\nas materials hosting metallic states on the surface and insulating in the bulk.\nHowever it remains to be understood how granularity affects this new and exotic\nphase of matter. We perform electrical transport experiments on highly granular\ntopological insulator thin films of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and reveal remarkable\nproperties. We observe clear signatures of topological surface states despite\ngranularity with distinctly different properties from conventional bulk TI\nsystems including sharp surface state coupling-decoupling transitions, large\nsurface state penetration depths and exotic Berry phase effects. We present a\nmodel which explains these results. Our findings illustrate that granularity\ncan be used to engineer designer TIs, at the same time allowing easy access to\nthe Dirac-fermion physics that is inaccessible in single crystal systems.\n", "  Gravitational waves propagating through a stationary gauge field transform\ninto gauge field waves and back again. When multiple families of flavor-space\nlocked gauge fields are present, the gravitational and gauge field waves\nexhibit novel dynamics. At high frequencies, the system behaves like coupled\noscillators in which the gravitational wave is the central pacemaker. Due to\nenergy conservation and exchange among the oscillators, the wave amplitudes lie\non a multidimensional sphere, reminiscent of neutrino flavor oscillations. This\nphenomenon has implications for cosmological scenarios based on flavor-space\nlocked gauge fields.\n", "  Double Field Theory suggests to view the whole massless sector of closed\nstrings as the gravitational unity. The fundamental symmetries therein,\nincluding the $\\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ covariance, can determine unambiguously how the\nStandard Model as well as a relativistic point particle should couple to the\nclosed string massless sector. The theory also refines the notion of\nsingularity. We consider the most general, spherically symmetric,\nasymptotically flat, static vacuum solution to ${D=4}$ Double Field Theory,\nwhich contains three free parameters and consequently generalizes the\nSchwarzschild geometry. Analyzing the circular geodesic of a point particle in\nstring frame, we obtain the orbital velocity as a function of\n$R/(M_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\infty}}G)$ which is the dimensionless radial\nvariable normalized by mass. The rotation curve generically features a maximum\nand thus non-Keplerian over a finite range, while becoming asymptotically\nKeplerian at infinity, $R/(M_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\infty}}G)\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nThe adoption of the string frame rather than Einstein frame is the consequence\nof the fundamental symmetry principle. Our result opens up a new scheme to\nsolve the dark matter/energy problems by modifying General Relativity at\n`short' range of $R/(M_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\infty}}G)$.\n", "  We study the consistency of having Lorentz invariance as a low energy\napproximation within the quantum field theory framework. A model with a scalar\nand a fermion field is used to show how a Lorentz invariance violating high\nmomentum scale, a physical cutoff rendering the quantum field theory finite,\ncan be made compatible with a suppression of Lorentz invariance violations at\nlow momenta. The fine tuning required to get this suppression and to have a\nlight scalar particle in the spectrum is determined at one loop.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate a two-fold quantum delayed-choice\nexperiment where wave or particle nature of a superconducting interfering\ndevice can be post-selected twice after the interferometer. The wave-particle\ncomplementarity is controlled by a quantum which-path detector (WPD) in a\nsuperposition of its on and off states implemented through a superconducting\ncavity. The WPD projected to its on state records which-path information, which\nmanifests the particle nature and destroys the interference associated with\nwave nature of the system. In our experiment, we can recover the interference\nsignal through a quantum eraser even if the WPD has selected out the particle\nnature in the first round of delayed-choice detection, showing that a quantum\nWPD adds further unprecedented controllability to test of wave-particle\ncomplementarity through the peculiar quantum delayed-choice measurements.\n", "  We demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy based on difference frequency\ngeneration of frequency-agile near-infrared frequency combs, produced with the\nhelp of electro-optic modulators. The combs have a remarkably flat intensity\ndistribution and their positions and line spacings can be selected freely by\nsimply dialing a knob. We record, in the 3-micron region, Doppler-limited\nabsorption spectra with resolved comb lines within milliseconds. Precise\nmolecular line parameters are retrieved. Our technique holds promise for fast\nand sensitive time-resolved studies e.g. of trace gases.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the quantum motion of an impurity atom that is\nimmersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose liquid and is subject\nto an external force. We find that the momentum distribution of the impurity\nexhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin\nzone. While Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures,\nin our strongly correlated quantum liquid they result from the interplay of\nshort-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body\nscattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the\nimpurity exhibits periodic dynamics that we interpret as Bloch oscillations,\nwhich arise even though the quantum liquid is translationally invariant. Our\nobservations are supported by large-scale numerical simulations.\n", "  Optically levitated nanodiamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centers promise a\nhigh-quality hybrid spin-optomechanical system. However, the trapped\nnanodiamond absorbs energy form laser beams and causes thermal damage in\nvacuum. We propose to solve the problem by trapping a composite particle (a\nnanodiamond core coated with a less absorptive silica shell) at the center of\nstrongly focused doughnut-shaped laser beams. Systematical study on the\ntrapping stability, heat absorption, and oscillation frequency concludes that\nthe azimuthally polarized Gaussian beam and the linearly polarized\nLaguerre-Gaussian beam ${\\rm LG}_{03}$ are the optimal choices. With our\nproposal, particles with strong absorption coefficients can be trapped without\nobvious heating and, thus, the spin-optomechanical system based on levitated\nnanodiamonds are made possible in high vacuum with the present experimental\ntechniques.\n", "  We present the mass spectra of radial and orbital excited states of singly\nheavy bottom baryons; $\\Sigma_{b}^{+}, \\Sigma_{b}^-, \\Xi_b^-, \\Xi_b^0,\n\\Lambda_b^0$ and $\\Omega_b^-$. The QCD motivated hypercentral quark model is\nemployed for the three body description of baryons and the form of confinement\npotential is hyper coulomb plus linear. The first order correction to the\nconfinement potential is also incorporated in this work. The semi-electronic\ndecay of $\\Omega_b$ and $\\Xi_b$ are calculated using the spectroscopic\nparameters of the baryons. The computed results are compared with other\ntheoretical predictions as well as with the available experimental\nobservations. The Regge trajectories are plotted in (n, $M^2$) plane.\n", "  Pair production of Upsilon(1S) mesons is observed at the LHC in proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment in a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 inverse femtobarns. Both\nUpsilon(1S) candidates are fully reconstructed via their decays to mu+ mu-. The\nfiducial acceptance region is defined by an absolute Upsilon(1S) rapidity\nsmaller than 2.0. The fiducial cross section for the production of Upsilon(1S)\npairs, assuming that both mesons decay isotropically, is measured to be 68.8\n+/- 12.7 (stat) +/- 7.4 (syst) +/- 2.8 (B) pb, where the third uncertainty\ncomes from the uncertainty in the branching fraction of Upsilon(1S) decays to\nmu+ mu-. Assuming instead that the Upsilon(1S) mesons are produced with\ndifferent polarizations leads to variations in the measured cross section in\nthe range from -38% to +36%.\n", "  I present a model of discrete gravity, which is formulated in terms of a\ntopological gauge theory with defects. The theory has no local degrees of\nfreedom and the gravitational field is trivial everywhere except at a number of\ncolliding null surfaces, which represent a system of curvature defects\npropagating at the speed of light. The underlying action is local and it is\nstudied in both its Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation. The canonically\nconjugate variables on the null surfaces are a spinor and a spinor-valued\ntwo-surface density, which are coupled to a topological field theory for the\nLorentz connection in the bulk. I discuss the relevance of the model for\nnon-perturbative approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity,\nwhere similar variables have recently appeared as well.\n", "  We propose a novel concept of obtaining oscillations with frequencies in\nvery-high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands. A traditional\nspin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) consists of at least one pinned layer (PL)\nand one free layer (FL) which precesses in a fixed orbit, defined by a\nprecession angle, which results in magneto-resistance (MR) oscillations. In\nSTNO, with aligned or even orthogonal easy-axis of the magnetic layers and with\nor without external bias magnetic field, it is not possible to attain full MR\nswing. The constringed MR swing jeopardizes the extracted output power.\nFurthermore, the orbit is strongly disturbed by the thermal fluctuations\nresulting in strong magnetic noise. In stark contrast to the operation\nprinciple of a STNO, we theoretically demonstrate, with the practical\nparameters from the experiments, that with a unidirectional current in a dual\nasymmetric free-layers (with no pinned layer) based perpendicular magnetic\ntunnel junction (pMTJ), both of the free layers can attain a complete and\nout-of-phase self-sustained switching without the aid of any external magnetic\nfield. This design facilitates a switching based spin torque oscillator\n(SW-STO) with a full MR swing, and hence a larger output power, for stable and\nmore thermally robust free-running oscillations. Furthermore, the integration\nwith the n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) field-effect transistors at\n130, 65 and 14 nm node is appraised to expound its effect on the oscillator\nperformance, controllability with DC bias and the design constraints, to\ndemonstrate the viability of the design as a dynamically controllable\noscillator for practical on-chip implementation.\n", "  We describe an improved version of the quantum simulation method based on the\nimplementation of a truncated Taylor series of the evolution operator. The idea\nis to add an extra step to the previously known algorithm which implements an\noperator that corrects the weightings of the Taylor series. This way, the\ndesired accuracy is achieved with an improvement in the overall complexity of\nthe algorithm. This quantum simulation method is applicable to a wide range of\nHamiltonians of interest, including to quantum chemistry problems.\n", "  We study the static and dynamic interaction between a horizontal cylindrical\nnano-probe and a thin liquid film. The effects of the physical and geometrical\nparameters, with a special focus on the film thickness, the probe speed, and\nthe distance between the probe and the free surface are analyzed. Deformation\nprofiles have been computed numerically from a Reynolds lubrication equation,\ncoupled to a modified Young-Laplace equation, which takes into account the\nprobe/liquid and the liquid/substrate non-retarded van der Waals interactions.\nWe have found that the film thickness and the probe speed have a significant\neffect on the threshold separation distance below which the jump-to-contact\ninstability is triggered. These results encourage the use of horizontal\ncylindrical nano-probes to scan thin liquid films, in order to determine either\nthe physical or geometrical properties of the latter, through the measurement\nof interaction forces.\n", "  The primary sample of the {\\it Gaia} Data Release 1 is the Tycho-Gaia\nAstrometric Solution (TGAS): $\\approx$ 2 million Tycho-2 sources with improved\nparallaxes and proper motions relative to the initial catalog. This increased\nastrometric precision presents an opportunity to find new binary stars and\nmoving groups. We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by\nidentifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a\nmarginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs\nfrom the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-\ncorrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood\nratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of\nparallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and\n3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606\nunique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of\nthese pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these\npair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we\nalso report the discovery of several new comoving groups. Most surprisingly, we\nfind a large number of very wide ($>1$ pc) separation comoving star pairs, the\nnumber of which increases with increasing separation and cannot be explained\npurely by false-positive contamination. Our key result is a catalog of\nhigh-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS. We discuss the utility of this\ncatalog for making dynamical inferences about the Galaxy, testing stellar\natmosphere models, and validating chemical abundance measurements.\n", "  We extend our previous work (on $D=2$) to give an exact solution of the\n$\\Phi^3_D$ large-$\\mathcal{N}$ matrix model (or renormalised Kontsevich model)\nin $D=4$ and $D=6$ dimensions. Induction proofs and the difficult combinatorics\nare unchanged compared with $D=2$, but the renormalisation - performed\naccording to Zimmermann - is much more involved. As main result we prove that\nthe Schwinger 2-point function resulting from the $\\Phi^3_D$-QFT model on Moyal\nspace satisfies, for real coupling constant, reflection positivity in $D=4$ and\n$D=6$ dimensions. The K\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann mass spectrum of the associated\nWightman 2-point function describes a scattering part $|p|^2 \\geq 2\\mu^2$ and\nan isolated fuzzy mass shell around $|p|^2=\\mu^2$.\n", "  In this work we present a new computation of the lepton flavor violating\nHiggs boson decays that are generated radiatively to one-loop from heavy\nright-handed neutrinos. We work within the context of the inverse seesaw model\nwith three $\\nu_R$ and three extra singlets $X$, but the results could be\ngeneralized to other low scale seesaw models. The novelty of our computation is\nthat it uses a completely different method by means of the mass insertion\napproximation which works with the electroweak interaction states instead of\nthe usual 9 physical neutrino mass eigenstates of the inverse seesaw model.\nThis method also allows us to write the analytical results explicitly in terms\nof the most relevant model parameters, that are the neutrino Yukawa coupling\nmatrix $Y_\\nu$ and the right-handed mass matrix $M_R$, which is very convenient\nfor a phenomenological analysis. This $Y_\\nu$ matrix, being generically\nnondiagonal in flavor space, is the only responsible for the induced charged\nlepton flavor violating processes of our interest. We perform the calculation\nof the decay amplitude up to order ${\\cal O}(Y_\\nu^2+Y_\\nu^4)$. We also study\nnumerically the goodness of the mass insertion approximation results. In the\nlast part we present the computation of the relevant one-loop effective vertex\n$H\\ell_i\\ell_j$ for the lepton flavor violating Higgs decay which is derived\nfrom a large $M_R$ mass expansion of the form factors. We believe that our\nsimple formula found for this effective vertex can be of interest for other\nresearchers who wish to estimate the $H \\to \\ell_i \\bar \\ell_j$ rates in a fast\nway in terms of their own preferred input values for the relevant model\nparameters $Y_\\nu$ and $M_R$.\n", "  A detailed theoretical derivation of the cross sections of $e^+e^- \\to\ne^+e^-$ and $e^+e^- \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$ around the $J/\\psi$ resonance is reported.\nThe resonance and interference parts of the cross sections, related to $J/\\psi$\nresonance parameters, are calculated. Higher-order corrections for vacuum\npolarization and initial-state radiation are considered. An arbitrary upper\nlimit of radiative correction integration is involved. Full and simplified\nversions of analytic formulae are given with precision at the level of 0.1% and\n0.2%, respectively. Moreover, the results obtained in the paper can be applied\nto the case of the $\\psi(3686)$ resonance.\n", "  A search for $CP$ violation in $D^{\\pm}\\rightarrow \\eta^{\\prime} \\pi^{\\pm}$\nand $D^{\\pm}_{s}\\rightarrow \\eta^{\\prime} \\pi^{\\pm}$ decays is performed using\nproton-proton collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3$\nfb$^{-1}$, recorded by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7$\nand $8$ TeV. The measured $CP$-violating charge asymmetries are $A_{CP}(D^{\\pm}\n\\rightarrow \\eta^{\\prime} \\pi^{\\pm})=(-0.61\\pm 0.72 \\pm 0.53 \\pm 0.12)\\%$ and\n$A_{CP}(D^{\\pm}_{s}\\rightarrow \\eta^{\\prime} \\pi^{\\pm})=(-0.82\\pm 0.36 \\pm 0.22\n\\pm 0.27)\\%$, where the first uncertainties are statistical, the second\nsystematic, and the third are the uncertainties on the $A_{CP}(D^{\\pm}\n\\rightarrow K^0_S \\pi^{\\pm})$ and $A_{CP}(D^{\\pm}_{s}\\rightarrow \\phi\n\\pi^{\\pm})$ measurements used for calibration. The results represent the most\nprecise measurements of these asymmetries to date.\n", "  Most available studies of quasi-normal modes for Lifshitz black solutions are\nlimited to the neutral scalar perturbations. In this paper, we investigate the\nwave dynamics of massive charged scalar perturbation in the background of\n$(3+1)$-dimensional charged dilaton Lifshitz black branes/holes. We disclose\nthe dependence of the quasi-normal modes on the model parameters, such as the\nLifshitz exponent $z$, the mass and charge of the scalar perturbation field and\nthe charge of the Lifshitz configuration. In contrast with neutral\nperturbations, we observe the possibility to destroy the original Lifshitz\nbackground near the extreme value of charge where the temperature is low. We\nfind out that when the Lifshitz exponent deviates more from unity, it is more\ndifficult to break the stability of the configuration. We also study the\nbehavior of the real part of the quasi-normal frequencies. Unlike the neutral\nscalar perturbation around uncharged black branes where an overdamping was\nobserved to start at $z=2$ and independent of the value of scalar mass, our\nobservation discloses that the overdamping starting point is no longer at $z=2$\nand depends on the mass of scalar field for charged Lifshitz black branes. For\ncharged scalar perturbations, fixing $m_s$, the asymptotic value of $\\omega_R$\nfor high $z$ is more away from zero when the charge of scalar perturbation\n$q_s$ increases. There does not appear the overdamping.\n", "  The intimate interaction between phase-matched parametric amplification and\nstrong nonlinear mode coupling in a multimode optical fiber results in a\nsaturable spatial mode conversion that appears to violate the conservation of\nmomentum. We investigate, by theory and experiment, this new regime of strong\nnonlinear interaction in multimode optical fibers and show that the appearance\nof the non-conservation of linear momentum is merely a clever sleight of hand\nby nature. This novel saturable mode conversion can potentially be used in a\nvariety of applications including the generation of exotic quantum states of\nlight.\n", "  Nucleon transfer reactions in deuteron-deuteron collisions at energies above\nthe three- and four-body breakup threshold are described using exact four-body\nequations for transition operators that are solved in the momentum-space\nframework. Differential cross sections, analyzing powers, polarizations, and\nspin transfer coefficients are obtained using realistic two-nucleon potentials\nand including the Coulomb repulsion between protons. Overall good agreement\nbetween predictions and experimental data is found. Most remarkable\ndiscrepancies are seen around the minima of the differential cross section at\nhigher energies and in the outgoing nucleon polarization at lower energies.\n", "  We study the correlations of D mesons produced in $p$+$p$ and $p$+Pb\ncollisions. These are found to be sensitive to the effects of the cold nuclear\nmedium and the transverse momentum ($p_T$) regions we are looking into. In\norder to put this on a quantitative footing, as a first step we analyse the\nazimuthal correlations of D meson-charged hadron(Dh), and then predict the same\nfor D meson -anti D meson ($D\\overline{D}$) pairs in $p$+$p$ and $p$+Pb\ncollisions with strong coupling at leading order $\\cal{O}$($\\alpha_{s}^{2}$)\nand next to leading order $\\cal{O}$($\\alpha_{s}^{3}$) which includes space-time\nevolution (in both systems), as well cold nuclear matter effects (in $p$+Pb).\nThis also sets the stage and baseline for the identification and study of\nmedium modification of azimuthal correlations in relativistic collision of\nheavy nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Understanding excited carrier dynamics in semiconductors is crucial for the\ndevelopment of photovoltaics and efficient photonic devices. However,\noverlapping spectral features in optical/NIR pump-probe spectroscopy often\nrender assignments of separate electron and hole carrier dynamics ambiguous.\nHere, ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium nanocrystalline thin\nfilms are directly and simultaneously observed by attosecond transient\nabsorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in the extreme ultraviolet at the germanium\nM_{4,5}-edge (~30 eV). We decompose the ATAS spectra into contributions of\nelectronic state blocking and photo-induced band shifts at a carrier density of\n8*10^{20}cm^{-3}. Separate electron and hole relaxation times are observed as a\nfunction of hot carrier energies. A first order electron and hole decay of ~1\nps suggests a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination mechanism. The simultaneous\nobservation of electrons and holes with ATAS paves the way for investigating\nfew to sub-femtosecond dynamics of both holes and electrons in complex\nsemiconductor materials and across junctions.\n", "  Uncertainties in the frequency parameters of a frequency comb laser, causes\nit to represent a mixed quantum state. The formulation of such a quantum state\nis compounded by the fact that it contains both particle-number degrees of\nfreedom and temporal degrees of freedom. Here we develop a formalism in terms\nof which such a mixed quantum state can be expressed. For this purpose we also\nneed to compute the expression for the power spectral density of the frequency\ncomb laser. We do so by taking the uncertainties in the frequency parameters\ninto account.\n", "  We describe the purification of xenon from traces of the radioactive noble\ngas radon using a cryogenic distillation column. The distillation column is\nintegrated into the gas purification loop of the XENON100 detector for online\nradon removal. This enabled us to significantly reduce the constant $^{222}$Rn\nbackground originating from radon emanation. After inserting an auxiliary\n$^{222}$Rn emanation source in the gas loop, we determined a radon reduction\nfactor of R > 27 (95% C.L.) for the distillation column by monitoring the\n$^{222}$Rn activity concentration inside the XENON100 detector.\n", "  A memristor is one of four fundamental two-terminal solid elements in\nelectronics. In addition with the resistor, the capacitor and the inductor,\nthis passive element relates the electric charges to current in solid state\nelements. Here we report the existence of a thermal analog for this element\nmade with metal-insulator transition materials. We demonstrate that these\nmemristive systems can be used to create thermal neurons opening so the way to\nneuromophic networks for smart thermal management and information treatment.\n", "  We calculate the universal spectrum of trimer and tetramer states in\nheteronuclear mixtures of ultracold atoms with different masses in the vicinity\nof the heavy-light dimer threshold. To extract the energies, we solve the\nthree- and four-body problem for simple two- and three-body potentials tuned to\nthe universal region using the Gaussian expansion method. We focus on the case\nof one light particle of mass $m$ and two or three heavy bosons of mass $M$\nwith resonant heavy-light interactions. We find that trimer and tetramer cross\ninto the heavy-light dimer threshold at almost the same point and that as the\nmass ratio $M/m$ decreases, the distance between the thresholds for trimer and\ntetramer states becomes smaller. We also comment on the possibility of\nobserving exotic three-body states consisting of a dimer and two atoms in this\nregion and compare with previous work.\n", "  We address the issue of inter-particle dipolar interactions in the context of\nmagnetic hyperthermia. More precisely, the main question dealt with here is\nconcerned with the conditions under which the specific absorption rate is\nenhanced or reduced by dipolar interactions. For this purpose, we propose a\ntheory for the calculation of the AC susceptibility, and thereby the specific\nabsorption rate, for a monodisperse two-dimensional assembly of nanoparticles\nwith oriented anisotropy, in the presence of a DC magnetic field, in addition\nto the AC magnetic field. We also study the competition between the dipolar\ninteractions and the DC field, both in the transverse and longitudinal\nconfigurations. In both cases, we find that the specific absorption rate has a\nmaximum at some critical DC field that depends on the inter-particle\nseparation. In the longitudinal setup, this critical field falls well within\nthe range of experiments.\n", "  We propose an interpretation of the gauge coupling unification scale which is\nnot related to any new particle threshold. We revisit Grand Unified Theories\nand show that it is possible to completely eliminate the scalar as well as\nvector leptoquarks from the particle physics spectrum. As a consequence, in our\napproach the gauge hierarchy problem is put on different grounds, and the\nproton may be absolutely stable. In order to achieve that, we employ a number\nof nonlinear gauge-invariant constraints which only affect the superheavy\ndegrees of freedom. We illustrate our considerations in a model based on the\nSU(5) group, with the generalization to other groups being straightforward. We\ndiscuss how scale or conformal invariance may be added to our proposal.\n", "  Entanglement, a unique quantum resource with no classical counterpart,\nremains at the heart of quantum information. The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) and $W$ states are two inequivalent classes of multipartite entangled\nstates which can not be transformed into each other by means of local\noperations and classic communication. In this paper, we present the methods to\nprepare the GHZ and $W$ states via global controls on a long-range Ising spin\nmodel. For the GHZ state, general solutions are analytically obtained for an\narbitrary-size spin system, while for the $W$ state, we find a standard way to\nprepare the $W$ state that is analytically illustrated in three- and four-spin\nsystems and numerically demonstrated for larger-size systems. The number of\nparameters required in the numerical search increases only linearly with the\nsize of the system.\n", "  We report a novel, polarization dependent, femtosecond laser-induced\nmodification of surface nanostructures of indium, gallium, and arsenic grown on\nsilicon via molecular beam epitaxy, yielding shape control from linear and\ncircular polarization of laser excitation. Linear polarization causes an\nelongation effect, beyond the dimensions of the unexposed nanostructures,\nranging from 88 nm to over 1 um, and circular polarization causes the\nnanostructures to flatten out or form loops of material, to diameters of\napproximately 195 nm. During excitation, it is also observed that the generated\nsecond and third harmonic signals from the substrate and surface nanostructures\nincrease with exposure time.\n", "  Due to the lack of two-dimensional silicon-based semiconductors and the fact\nthat most of the components and devices are generated on single-crystal silicon\nor silicon-based substrates in modern industry, designing two-dimensional\nsilicon-based semiconductors is highly desired. With the combination of a swarm\nstructure search method and density functional theory in this work, a\nquaternary compound SiBCN with graphene-like structure is found and displays a\nwide direct band gap as expected. The band gap is of ~2.63 eV which is just\nbetween ~2.20 and ~3.39 eV of the highlighted semiconductors SiC and GaN.\nNotably, the further calculation reveals that SiBCN possesses high carrier\nmobility with ~5.14x10^3 and ~13.07x10^3 cm^2V^-1s^-1 for electron and hole,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations also\nshow that the graphene-like structure of SiBCN can be well kept even at an\nextremely high temperature of 2000 K. The present work tells that designing\nulticomponent silicides may be a practicable way to search for new\nsilicon-based low-dimensional semiconductors which can match well with the\nprevious Si-based substrates.\n", "  We use the time-dependent Bogoliubov de Gennes equations to study dark\nsolitons in three-dimensional spin-imbalanced superfluid Fermi gases. We\nexplore how the shape and dynamics of dark solitons are altered by the presence\nof excess unpaired spins which fill their low-density core. The unpaired\nparticles broaden the solitons and suppress the transverse snake instability.\nWe discuss ways of observing these phenomena in cold atom experiments.\n", "  The ingredients for a model with a TeV right-handed scale, gauge coupling\nunification, and suitable dark matter candidates lie at the heart of left-right\nsymmetry with broken D-parity. After detailing the contents of such a model,\nwith SU(2)R self-conjugate fermions at the right-handed scale aiding in\nunification of couplings, we explore its dark matter implications and collider\nsignatures.\n", "  We have performed a fully relativistic first-principles density functional\ncalculation examining the surface state of bismuth (Bi) (111) multi-layer\nnanofilm, with up to 20 Bi bilayers, and investigated the Rashba effect and\nspin texture on the Bi surfaces. We have revealed a giant out-of-plane spin\nstates on the Fermi lines, and the maximum value of the out-of-plane spin\ncomponent being approximately 40% of the magnitude of the total spin. We have\nalso evaluated the Rashba parameter $\\alpha_R \\simeq 1.9 {\\rm eV}\\cdot$\\AA\nusing the surface state bands which is buried in the bulk state, at -0.32 eV\nbelow the Fermi energy.\n", "  We measured phosphorus abundances in 22 FGK dwarfs and giants that span\n--0.55 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.2 using spectra obtained with the Phoenix high\nresolution infrared spectrometer on the Kitt Peak National Observatory Mayall\n4m telescope, the Gemini South Telescope, and the Arcturus spectral atlas. We\nfit synthetic spectra to the P I feature at 10581 $\\AA$ to determine abundances\nfor our sample. Our results are consistent with previously measured phosphorus\nabundances; the average [P/Fe] ratio measured in [Fe/H] bins of 0.2 dex for our\nstars are within $\\sim$ 1 $\\sigma$ compared to averages from other IR\nphosphorus studies. Our study provides more evidence that models of chemical\nevolution using the results of theoretical yields are under producing\nphosphorus compared to the observed abundances. Our data better fit a chemical\nevolution model with phosphorus yields increased by a factor of 2.75 compared\nto models with unadjusted yields. We also found average [P/Si] = 0.02 $\\pm$\n0.07 and [P/S] = 0.15 $\\pm$ 0.15 for our sample, showing no significant\ndeviations from the solar ratios for [P/Si] and [P/S] ratios.\n", "  After several decades of extensive research the mechanism driving\ncore-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is still unclear. A common mechanism is a\nneutrino driven outflow, but others have been proposed. Among those, a\nlong-standing idea is that jets play an important role in SN explosions.\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that accompany rare and powerful CCSNe, sometimes\ncalled \"hypernovae\", provide a clear evidence for a jet activity. The\nrelativistic GRB jet punches a hole in the stellar envelope and produces the\nobserved gamma-rays far outside the progenitor star. While SNe and jets coexist\nin long GRBs, the relation between the mechanisms driving the hypernova and the\njet is unknown. Also unclear is the relation between the rare hypernovae and\nthe more common CCSNe. Here we {present observational evidence that indicates}\nthat choked jets are active in CCSNe types that are not associated with GRBs. A\nchoked jet deposits all its energy in a cocoon. The cocoon eventually breaks\nout from the star releasing energetic material at very high, yet\nsub-relativistic, velocities. This fast moving material has a unique signature\nthat can be detected in early time SN spectra. We find a clear evidence for\nthis signature in several CCSNe, all involving progenitors that have lost all,\nor most, of their hydrogen envelope prior to the explosion. These include CCSNe\nthat don't harbor GRBs or any other relativistic outflows. Our findings suggest\na continuum of central engine activities in different types of CCSNe and call\nfor rethinking of the explosion mechanism of regular CCSNe\n", "  Neutrino self-interactions are known to lead to non-linear collective flavor\noscillations in a core-collapse supernova. We point out new possible effects of\nnon-standard self-interactions (NSSI) of neutrinos on flavor conversions in a\ntwo-flavor framework. We show that, for a single-energy neutrino-antineutrino\nensemble, a flavor instability is generated even in normal hierarchy for large\nenough NSSI. Using a toy model for the neutrino spectra, we show that\nflavor-preserving NSSI lead to pinching of spectral swaps, while\nflavor-violating NSSI cause swaps to develop away from a spectral crossing or\neven in the absence of a spectral crossing. Consequently, NSSI could give rise\nto collective oscillations and spectral splits even during neutronization\nburst, for both hierarchies.\n", "  Graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene is an excellent platform to study\nscattering processes of massless Dirac fermions by charged impurities, in which\nhigh mobility can be preserved due to the absence of lattice defects through\ndirect substitution of carbon atoms in the graphene lattice by nitrogen atoms.\nIn this work, we report on electrical and magnetotransport measurements of\nhigh-quality graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene. We show that the substitutional\nnitrogen dopants in graphene introduce atomically sharp scatters for electrons\nbut long-range Coulomb scatters for holes and, thus, graphitic nitrogen-doped\ngraphene exhibits clear electron-hole asymmetry in transport properties.\nDominant scattering processes of charge carriers in graphitic nitrogen-doped\ngraphene are analyzed. It is shown that the electron-hole asymmetry originates\nfrom a distinct difference in intervalley scattering of electrons and holes. We\nhave also carried out the magnetotransport measurements of graphitic\nnitrogen-doped graphene at different temperatures and the temperature\ndependences of intervalley scattering, intravalley scattering and phase\ncoherent scattering rates are extracted and discussed. Our results provide an\nevidence for the electron-hole asymmetry in the intervalley scattering induced\nby substitutional nitrogen dopants in graphene and shine a light on versatile\nand potential applications of graphitic nitrogen-doped graphene in electronic\nand valleytronic devices.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of how superconducting fluctuations in the\nnormal state contribute to the conductivity tensor in a thin (119 $\\AA$) film\nof NbN. It is shown how these fluctuations drive a sign change in the Hall\ncoefficient $R_\\mathrm{H}$ for low magnetic fields near the superconducting\ntransition. The scaling behaviours as a function of distance to the transition\n$\\epsilon=\\ln(T/T_\\mathrm{c})$ of the longitudinal ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{xx}$) and\ntransverse ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{xy}$) conductivity is found to be consistent with\nGaussian fluctuation theory. Moreover, excellent quantitative agreement between\ntheory and experiment is obtained without any adjustable parameters. Our\nexperimental results thus provide a case study of the conductivity tensor\noriginating from short-lived Cooper pairs.\n", "  Recent calculations have pointed to a 2.8 $\\sigma$ tension between data on\n$\\epsilon^{\\prime}_K / \\epsilon_K$ and the standard-model (SM) prediction.\nSeveral new physics (NP) models can explain this discrepancy, and such NP\nmodels are likely to predict deviations of $\\mathcal{B}(K\\to \\pi \\nu\n\\overline{\\nu})$ from the SM predictions, which can be probed precisely in the\nnear future by NA62 and KOTO experiments. We present correlations between\n$\\epsilon^{\\prime}_K / \\epsilon_K$ and $\\mathcal{B}(K\\to \\pi \\nu\n\\overline{\\nu})$ in two types of NP scenarios: a box dominated scenario and a\n$Z$-penguin dominated one. It is shown that different correlations are\npredicted and the future precision measurements of $K \\to \\pi \\nu\n\\overline{\\nu}$ can distinguish both scenarios.\n", "  Recent work using plasmonic nanosensors in a clinically relevant detection\nassay reports extreme sensitivity based upon a mechanism termed 'inverse\nsensitivity', whereby reduction of substrate concentration increases reaction\nrate, even at the single-molecule limit. This near-homoeopathic mechanism\ncontradicts the law of mass action. The assay involves deposition of silver\natoms upon gold nanostars, changing their absorption spectrum. Multiple\nadditional aspects of the assay appear to be incompatible with settled chemical\nknowledge, in particular the detection of tiny numbers of silver atoms on a\nbackground of the classic 'silver mirror reaction'. Finally, it is estimated\nhere that the reported spectral changes require some 2.5E11 times more silver\natoms than are likely to be produced. It is suggested that alternative\nexplanations must be sought for the original observations.\n", "  This study examines physics students' evaluations of identical,\nvideo-recorded lectures performed by female and male actors playing the role of\nprofessors. The results indicate that evaluations by male students show\nstatistically significant overall biases with male professors rated more\npositively than female professors. Female students tended to be egalitarian,\nexcept in two areas. Female students evaluated female professors'\ninterpersonal/communicative skills more positively than male professors'. They\nevaluated female professors' scientific knowledge and skills less positively\nthan that of male professors just as male students did. These findings are\nrelevant to two areas of research on bias in evaluation: rater-ratee similarity\nbias and stereotype confirmation bias. Results from this study have important\nimplications for efforts focused on educating students and mentoring faculty\nmembers in order to increase the representation of women in the physical\nsciences.\n", "  The Maxwell equations in the presence of sources are first derived without\nmaking use of the potentials and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for classical\nelectrodynamics is written down. The manifestly gauge invariant theory is then\nquantized to write down the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in quantum\nelectrodynamics. Finally, an interpolating field theory is proposed that\ndescribes continuous transitions between quantum and classical electrodynamics.\nIt is shown that energy flow lines are identical for quantum and classical\nfields in the case of the double-slit arrangement but differ in the case of\nvortex beams.\n", "  We derive an analytical approximation to the probability distribution\nfunction (pdf) for the response of Mathieu's equation under parametric\nexcitation by a random process with a spectrum peaked at the main resonant\nfrequency, motivated by the problem of large amplitude ship roll resonance in\nrandom seas. The inclusion of random stochastic excitation renders the\notherwise straightforward response to a system undergoing intermittent\nresonances: randomly occurring large amplitude bursts. Intermittent resonance\noccurs precisely when the random parametric excitation pushes the system into\nthe instability region, causing an extreme magnitude response. As a result, the\nstatistics are characterized by heavy-tails. We apply a recently developed\nmathematical technique, the probabilistic decomposition-synthesis method, to\nderive an analytical approximation to the non-Gaussian pdf of the response. We\nillustrate the validity of this analytic approximation through comparisons with\nMonte-Carlo simulations that demonstrate our result accurately captures the\nstrong non-Gaussianity of the response.\n", "  All-polarization-maintaining, single-port Er:fiber combs offer long-term\nrobust operation as well as high stability. We have built two such combs and\nevaluated the transfer noise for linking optical clocks. A uniformly broadened\nspectrum over 135-285 THz with a high signal-to-noise ratio enables the optical\nfrequency measurement of the subharmonics of strontium, ytterbium, and mercury\noptical lattice clocks with the fractional frequency-noise power spectral\ndensity of $(1-2)\\times 10^{-17}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 1 Hz. By applying a\nsynchronous clock comparison, the comb enables clock ratio measurements with\n$10^{-17}$ instability at 1 s, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the\nbest instability of the frequency ratio of optical lattice clocks.\n", "  X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) have been proven to generate short and\npowerful radiation pulses allowing for a wide class of novel experiments. If an\nXFEL facility supports the generation of two X-ray pulses with different\nwavelengths and controllable delay, the range of possible experiments is\nbroadened even further to include X-ray-pump/X-ray-probe applications. In this\nwork we discuss the possibility of applying a simple and cost-effective method\nfor producing two-color pulses at the SASE3 soft X-ray beamline of the European\nXFEL. The technique is based on the installation of a magnetic chicane in the\nbaseline undulator and can be accomplished in several steps. We discuss the\nscientific interest of this upgrade for the Small Quantum Systems (SQS)\ninstrument, in connection with the high-repetition rate of the European XFEL,\nand we provide start-to-end simulations up to the radiation focus on the\nsample, proving the feasibility of our concept.\n", "  We present an effective model where the inflaton is a relaxion that scans the\nHiggs mass and sets it at the weak scale. The dynamics consist of a long epoch\nin which inflation is due to the shallow slope of the potential, followed by a\nfew number of e-folds where slow-roll is maintained thanks to dissipation via\nnon-perturbative gauge-boson production. The same gauge bosons give rise to a\nstrong electric field that triggers the production of electron-positron pairs\nvia the Schwinger mechanism. The subsequent thermalization of these particles\nprovides a novel mechanism of reheating. The relaxation of the Higgs mass\noccurs after reheating, when the inflaton/relaxion stops on a local minimum of\nthe potential. We argue that this scenario may evade phenomenological and\nastrophysical bounds while allowing for the cutoff of the effective model to be\nclose to the Planck scale. This framework provides an intriguing connection\nbetween inflation and the hierarchy problem.\n", "  A theory of thermodynamics has been recently formulated and derived on the\nbasis of R\\'enyi entropy and its relative versions. In this framework, we\ndefine the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy, and\nfundamental quantum thermodynamical inequalities are deduced. In the context of\nR\\'enyi's thermodynamics, the variational Helmholtz principle is stated and the\ncondition of equilibrium is analyzed. The R\\'enyi maximum entropy principle is\nformulated and the equality case is discussed. The obtained results reduce to\nthe von Neumann ones when the R\\'enyi entropic parameter $\\alpha$ approaches 1.\nThe Heisenberg and Schr\\\"odinger uncertainty principles on the measurements of\nquantum observables are revisited. The presentation is self-contained and the\nproofs only use standard matrix analysis techniques.\n", "  The Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) was launched as one of\nthe scientific instruments on board of the space observatory Herschel. The\nSPIRE photometer opened up an entirely new window in the Submillimeter domain\nfor large scale mapping, that up to then was very difficult to observe. There\nare already several catalogs that were produced by individual Herschel science\nprojects. Yet, we estimate that the objects of only a fraction of these maps\nwill ever be systematically extracted and published by the science teams that\noriginally proposed the observations. The SPIRE instrument performed its\nstandard photometric observations in an optically very stable configuration,\nonly moving the telescope across the sky, with variations in its configuration\nparameters limited to scan speed and sampling rate. This and the scarcity of\nfeatures in the data that require special processing steps made this dataset\nvery attractive for producing an expert reduced catalog of point sources that\nis being described in this document. The Catalog was extracted from a total of\n6878 unmodified SPIRE scan map observations. The photometry was obtained by a\nsystematic and homogeneous source extraction procedure, followed by a rigorous\nquality check that emphasized reliability over completeness. Having to exclude\nregions affected by strong Galactic emission, that pushed the limits of the\nfour source extraction methods that were used, this catalog is aimed primarily\nat the extragalactic community. The result can serve as a pathfinder for ALMA\nand other Submillimeter and Far-Infrared facilities. 1,693,718 sources are\nincluded in the final catalog, splitting into 950688, 524734, 218296 objects\nfor the 250\\mu m, 350\\mu m, and 500\\mu m bands, respectively. The catalog comes\nwith well characterized environments, reliability, completeness, and\naccuracies, that single programs typically cannot provide.\n", "  We propose paramagnetic semiconductors as active media for refrigeration at\ncryogenic temperatures by adiabatic demagnetization. The paramagnetism of\nimpurity dopants or structural defects can provide the entropy necessary for\nrefrigeration at cryogenic temperatures. We present a simple model for the\ntheoretical limitations to specific entropy and cooling power achievable by\ndemagnetization of various semiconductor systems. Performance comparable to\nthat of the hydrate (CMN) is predicted.\n", "  The resource quality and the temporal generation pattern of variable\nrenewable energy sources vary significantly across Europe. In this paper\nspatial distributions of renewable assets are explored which exploit this\nheterogeneity to lower the total system costs for a high level of renewable\nelectricity in Europe. Several intuitive heuristic algorithms, optimal\nportfolio theory and a local search algorithm are used to find optimal\ndistributions of renewable generation capacities that minimise the total costs\nof backup, transmission and renewable capacity simultaneously. Using current\ncost projections, an optimal heterogeneous distribution favours onshore wind,\nparticularly in countries bordering the North Sea, which results in average\nelectricity costs that are up to 11% lower than for a homogeneous reference\ndistribution of renewables proportional to each country's mean load. The\nreduction becomes even larger, namely 18%, once the transmission capacities are\nput to zero in the homogeneous reference distribution. Heuristic algorithms to\ndistribute renewable capacity based on each country's wind and solar capacity\nfactors are shown to provide a satisfactory approximation to fully optimised\nrenewable distributions, while maintaining the benefits of transparency and\ncomprehensibility. The sensitivities of the results to changing costs of solar\ngeneration and gas supply as well as to the possible cross-sectoral usage of\nunavoidable curtailment energy are also examined.\n", "  Observations of the highly-eccentric (e~0.9) hot-Jupiter HD 80606b with\nSpitzer have provided some of best probes of the physics at work in exoplanet\natmospheres. By observing HD 80606b during its periapse passage, atmospheric\nradiative, advective, and chemical timescales can be directly measured and used\nto constrain fundamental planetary properties such as rotation period, tidal\ndissipation rate, and atmospheric composition (including aerosols). Here we\npresent three-dimensional general circulation models for HD 80606b that aim to\nfurther explore the atmospheric physics shaping HD 80606b's observed Spitzer\nphase curves. We find that our models that assume a planetary rotation period\ntwice that of the pseudo-synchronous rotation period best reproduce the phase\nvariations observed for HD~80606b near periapse passage with Spitzer.\nAdditionally, we find that the rapid formation/dissipation and vertical\ntransport of clouds in HD 80606b's atmosphere near periapse passage likely\nshapes its observed phase variations. We predict that observations near\nperiapse passage at visible wavelengths could constrain the composition and\nformation/advection timescales of the dominant cloud species in HD 80606b's\natmosphere. The time-variable forcing experienced by exoplanets on eccentric\norbits provides a unique and important window on radiative, dynamical, and\nchemical processes in planetary atmospheres and an important link between\nexoplanet observations and theory.\n", "  Crystal truncation rods are used to study surface and interface structure.\nSince real surfaces are always somewhat miscut from a low index plane, it is\nimportant to study the effect of miscut on crystal truncation rods. We develop\na model that describes the truncation rod scattering from miscut surfaces that\nhave steps and terraces. We show that non-uniform terrace widths and jagged\nstep edges are both forms of roughness that decrease the intensity of the rods.\nNon-uniform terrace widths also result in a broad peak that overlaps the rods.\nWe use our model to characterize the terrace width distribution and step edge\njaggedness on three SrTiO$_3$ (001) samples, showing excellent agreement\nbetween the model and the data, confirmed by atomic force micrographs of the\nsurface morphology. We expect our description of terrace roughness will apply\nto many surfaces, even those without obvious terracing.\n", "  We present a novel extended-focus optical coherence microscope (OCM)\nattaining 0.7 {\\mu}m axial and 0.4 {\\mu}m lateral resolution maintained over a\ndepth of 40 {\\mu}m, while preserving the advantages of Fourier domain OCM. Our\nmethod uses an ultra-broad spectrum from a super- continuum laser source. As\nthe spectrum spans from near-infrared to visible wavelengths (240 nm in\nbandwidth), we call the method visOCM. The combination of such a broad spectrum\nwith a high-NA objective creates an almost isotropic 3D submicron resolution.\nWe analyze the imaging performance of visOCM on microbead samples and\ndemonstrate its image quality on cell cultures and ex-vivo mouse brain tissue.\n", "  Atherosclerosis is a disease caused due to formation of plaque into the\nartery. Increase in plaque affects the wall shear stress. The present study is\nperformed to calculate wall shear stress in different geometries of stenosed\ncarotid artery. A 2D model of different geometries is generated using CFD for\nNon- Newtonian model. After this WSS of different geometries of stenosed\narteries is calculated and compared. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) of carotid\narteries with smooth plaque, irregular plaque, cosine plaque and artery with\nblood clot is calculated. It is found that with increase of plaque in common\ncarotid artery WSS increases. Irregular plaque causes highest WSS. Wall Shear\nStress of opposite walls of carotid artery is compared where one wall is having\nblood clot into it and other one is healthy.\n", "  Self-healing polymers crosslinked by solely reversible bonds are\nintrinsically weaker than common covalently crosslinked networks. Introducing\ncovalent crosslinks into a reversible network would improve mechanical\nstrength. It is challenging, however, to apply this design concept to dry\nelastomers, largely because reversible crosslinks such as hydrogen bonds are\noften polar motifs, whereas covalent crosslinks are non-polar motifs, and these\ntwo types of bonds are intrinsically immiscible without co-solvents. Here we\ndesign and fabricate a hybrid polymer network by crosslinking randomly branched\npolymers carrying motifs that can form both reversible hydrogen bonds and\npermanent covalent crosslinks. The randomly branched polymer links such two\ntypes of bonds and forces them to mix on the molecular level without\nco-solvents. This allows us to create a hybrid dry elastomer that is very tough\nwith a fracture energy $13,500J/m^2$ comparable to that of natural rubber;\nmoreover, the elastomer can self-heal at room temperature with a recovered\ntensile strength 4 MPa similar to that of existing self-healing elastomers. The\nconcept of forcing covalent and reversible bonds to mix at molecular scale to\ncreate a homogenous network is quite general and should enable development of\ntough, self-healing polymers of practical usage.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the orientation dependence of high-harmonic\ngeneration (HHG) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We find\nthat, unlike conventional solid-state and atomic layered materials such as\ngraphene, both parallel and perpendicular emissions with respect to the\nincident electric field exist in TMDCs. Interestingly, the parallel\n(perpendicular) emissions principally contain only odd-(even-) order harmonics.\nBoth harmonics show the same periodicity in the crystallographic orientations\nbut opposite phases. These peculiar behaviors can be understood on the basis of\nthe dipole moments in TMDCs, which reflect the symmetries of both atomic\norbitals and lattice structures. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with\nrecent experi- mental results and provide a possibility for high-harmonic\nspectroscopy of solid-state materials.\n", "  We present the deepest optical images of the COSMOS field based on a joint\ndataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) by the HSC Subaru Strategic Program\n(SSP) team and the University of Hawaii (UH). The COSMOS field is one of the\nkey extragalactic fields with a wealth of deep, multi-wavelength data. However,\nthe current optical data are not sufficiently deep to match with, e.g., the\nUltraVista data in the near-infrared. The SSP team and UH have joined forces to\nproduce very deep optical images of the COSMOS field by combining data from\nboth teams. The coadd images reach depths of g=27.8, r=27.7, i=27.6, z=26.8,\nand y=26.2 mag at 5 sigma for point sources based on flux uncertainties quoted\nby the pipeline and they cover essentially the entire COSMOS 2 square degree\nfield. The seeing is between 0.6 and 0.9 arcsec on the coadds. We perform\nseveral quality checks and confirm that the data are of science quality; ~2%\nphotometry and 30 mas astrometry. This accuracy is identical to the Public Data\nRelease 1 from HSC-SSP. We make the joint dataset including fully calibrated\ncatalogs of detected objects available to the community at\nhttps://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/.\n", "  The excitement and convergence of tweets on specific topics are well studied.\nHowever, by utilizing the position information of Tweet, it is also possible to\nanalyze the position-sensitive tweet. In this research, we focus on bomb\nterrorist attacks and propose a method for separately analyzing the number of\ntweets at the place where the incident occurred, nearby, and far. We made\nmeasurements of position-sensitive tweets and suggested a theory to explain it.\nThis theory is an extension of the mathematical model of the hit phenomenon.\n", "  High-order optical vortices are inherently unstable, as they tend to split up\nunder perturbation to a series of vortices with unity charge. Control over the\nperturbation opens up a new degree of freedom to control and tune their\nlocation in a 2D-space, with immediate implications on trapping, light-matter\ninteractions and super-resolution imaging. Here, we present a continuous\nnano-scale tuning of the spatial location of plasmonic vortices on metal-air\ninterface achieved by varying the polarization state of the light coupled to\nthe surface plasmons through a spiral slit. We demonstrate such a control at\nnano-scale resolution using phase-resolved near-field microscopy.\n", "  The potential of an efficient ride-sharing scheme to significantly reduce\ntraffic congestion, lower emission level, as well as facilitating the\nintroduction of smart cities has been widely demonstrated. This positive thrust\nhowever is faced with several delaying factors, one of which is the volatility\nand unpredictability of the potential benefit (or utilization) of ride-sharing\nat different times, and in different places. In this work the following\nresearch questions are posed: (a) Is ride-sharing utilization stable over time\nor does it undergo significant changes? (b) If ride-sharing utilization is\ndynamic, can it be correlated with some traceable features of the traffic? and\n(c) If ride-sharing utilization is dynamic, can it be predicted ahead of time?\nWe analyze a dataset of over 14 Million taxi trips taken in New York City. We\npropose a dynamic travel network approach for modeling and forecasting the\npotential ride-sharing utilization over time, showing it to be highly volatile.\nIn order to model the utilization's dynamics we propose a network-centric\napproach, projecting the aggregated traffic taken from continuous time periods\ninto a feature space comprised of topological features of the network implied\nby this traffic. This feature space is then used to model the dynamics of\nride-sharing utilization over time. The results of our analysis demonstrate the\nsignificant volatility of ride-sharing utilization over time, indicating that\nany policy, design or plan that would disregard this aspect and chose a static\nparadigm would undoubtably be either highly inefficient or provide insufficient\nresources. We show that using our suggested approach it is possible to model\nthe potential utilization of ride sharing based on the topological properties\nof the rides network. We also show that using this method the potential\nutilization can be forecasting a few hours ahead of time.\n", "  An array of a finite number waveguides, driven laterally by injecting light\nat the outer waveguides, is considered. The array is modeled by a discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. It has been shown [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94,\n243902 (2005)] that, when the injected light is in the proximity of a\nbifurcation point, such a system can be sensitive to small disturbances, making\nit possible to act as a light detector. Here, the optimum intensity of the\ninjected light is discussed, and an analytical approximation is presented.\n", "  Dimensionless ratios characterizing many-body systems are a powerful tool to\nreveal the main universal quantities involved. The recently-introduced\nlocalisation parameter allow to study the occurrence of crystal,\nclusterisation, and quantum liquid states in many-body systems such as nuclei.\nIts concomitant use with other dimensionless quantities such as the quantality,\nallows to pinpoint fundamental lengthscales and dimensionless ratios at work in\nnuclei. Within the present approach, the impact of delocalisation on nuclear\nsaturation is discussed. The transition from a homogeneous to a clusterised\nstate in low density systems is studied. The spin-orbit effect in nuclei and\nfermionic systems is also reviewed in the light of this analysis. A generalised\nlocalisation parameter is derived, showing that the delocalisation properties\nare not always driven by the quantality. The concepts of quantum fluidity and\nmobility are finally introduced.\n", "  In the light of recent results obtained for the prototype helimagnet MnSi we\nexamine the possible magnetic structures of compounds of the same family,\nconsistent with the crystal symmetries when the magnetic propagation vector is\nparallel to the [001] axis. The analysis of a published muon spin rotation\nspectrum recorded in MnGe [Phys. Rev. B 93, 174405 (2016)] shows no deviation\nfrom the canonical helimagnetic structure, unlike in MnSi. This qualitative\ndifference calls for further theoretical works on chiral magnets.\n", "  In this work we report about the fundamental correspondence between the high\nefficiency of the broadband quantum memory on multifrequency absorbers in the\nsingle-mode cavity and the topology of the observed frequency lines. We have\nfound the spectral-topological matching condition by using the multiparametric\noptimization of the absorber characteristics which makes it possible to improve\nconsiderably the spectral efficiency of quantum memory under conditions of a\nreal experiment. The elaborated approach opens the possibility for the creation\nof the broadband quantum interface consisting of a small number of the\nabsorbers and characterized by the super-high quantum efficiency of more than\n99.9%.\n", "  In this Letter, we report the discovery of a strong correlation between the\nvariability of narrow absorption lines (NALs) and the ionizing continuum from a\ntwo-epoch spectra sample of 40 quasars containing 52 variable C iv\n{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548; 1551 absorption doublets. According to the concordance\nindex, this sample is classified into two subsamples. Subsample I shows an\nanti-correlation between the variations of absorption lines and the continuum,\nwhile Subsample II exhibits a positive correlation. These results imply that\nthese variable C iv {\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548; 1551 absorption doublets are\nintrinsic to the corresponding quasars and that their variations are caused\nprimarily by the fluctuations of the ionizing continuum. Based on our analysis,\nwe propose that there might be two kinds of absorption gas: one that is very\nsensitive to the continuum variations, the another that is not. In addition, we\nsuggest that in many cases the emergence or disappearance of NALs is caused by\nfluctuations of the ionizing continuum.\n", "  Separating petroleum hydrocarbons from water is an important problem to\naddress in order to mitigate the disastrous effects of hydrocarbons on aquatic\necosystems. A rational approach to address the problem of marine oil water\nseparation is to disperse the oil with the aid of surfactants in order to\nminimize the formation of large slicks at the water surface and to maximize the\noil-water interfacial area. Here we investigate the fundamental wetting and\ntransport behavior of such surfactant-stabilized droplets and the flow\nconditions necessary to perform sieving and separation of these stabilized\nemulsions. We show that, for water soluble surfactants, such droplets are\ncompletely repelled by a range of materials (intrinsically underwater\nsuperoleophobic) due to the detergency effect; therefore, there is no need for\nsurface micro/nanotexturing or chemical treatment to repel the oil and prevent\nfouling of the filter. We then simulate and experimentally investigate the\neffect of emulsion flow rate on the transport and impact behavior of such\ndroplets on rigid meshes to identify the minimum pore opening (w) necessary to\nfilter a droplet with a given diameter (d) in order to minimize the pressure\ndrop across the mesh and therefore maximize the filtering efficiency, which is\nstrongly dependent on w. We define a range of flow conditions and droplet sizes\nwhere minimum droplet deformation is to be expected and therefore find that the\ncondition of is sufficient for efficient separation. With this new\nunderstanding, we demonstrate the use of a commercially available\nfilter--without any additional surface engineering or functionalization--to\nseparate oil droplets from a surfactant stabilized emulsion with a flux of\n11,000 L m$^{-2}$ hr$^{-1}$ bar$^{-1}$. We believe these findings can inform\nthe design of future oil separation materials.\n", "  We investigate the quark number density at finite imaginary chemical\npotential by using the Dirac-mode expansion. In the large quark mass region, it\nis found that the quark number density can be expressed by the Polyakov loop\nand its conjugate in all order of the large quark mass expansion. Then, there\nare no specific Dirac-modes which dominantly contribute to the quark number\ndensity. In comparison, the small quark mass region is explored by using the\nquenched lattice QCD simulation. We found that the absolute value of the quark\nnumber density strongly depends on the low-lying Dirac-modes, but its sign does\nnot. This means that the existence of the Roberge-Weiss transition which is\ncharacterized by the singular behavior of the quark number density is not\nsensitive to low-lying Dirac-modes. This property enables us to discuss the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition from the behavior of the quark number\ndensity via the quark number holonomy.\n", "  We present the temperature dependence of the thermal magnon density in a thin\nferromagnetic layer. By employing Brillouin light scattering and varying the\ntemperature, an increase of the magnon density accompanied by a lowering of the\nspin-wave frequency is observed with increasing temperature. The magnon density\nfollows the temperature according to the Bose-Einstein distribution function\nwhich leads to an approximately linear dependency. In addition, the influence\nof this effect in spin-transfer-torque-driven systems is presented. In\nparticular, the increase in the magnon density with temperature sets the limit\nfor a suppression of magnons in charge current-driven systems. Hence, the\nmaximum possible suppression of thermal magnons occurs at a finite current.\n", "  Electromechanical coupling through piezoelectric polymer chains allows the\nemission of organic molecules in active nanowires to be tuned. This effect is\nevidenced by highly bendable arrays of counter-ion dye-doped nanowires made of\na poly(vinylidenefluoride) copolymer. A reversible redshift of the dye emission\nis found upon the application of dynamic stress during highly accurate bending\nexperiments. By density functional theory calculations it is found that these\nphotophysical properties are associated with mechanical stresses applied to\nelectrostatically interacting molecular systems, namely to counterion-mediated\nstates that involve light-emitting molecules as well as charged regions of\npiezoelectric polymer chains. These systems are an electrostatic class of\nsupramolecular functional stress-sensitive units, which might impart new\nfunctionalities in hybrid molecular nanosystems and anisotropic nanostructures\nfor sensing devices and soft robotics.\n", "  The structural and electronic properties of germanene coated Ge$_2$Pt\nclusters have been determined by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy\nat room temperature. The interior of the germanene sheet exhibits a buckled\nhoneycomb structure with a lattice constant of 4.3 \\AA and a buckling of 0.2\n\\AA. The zigzag edges of germanene are reconstructed and display a 4$\\times$\nperiodicity. The differential conductivity of the interior of the germanene\nsheet has a V-shape, which is reminiscent of the density of states of a\ntwo-dimensional Dirac system. The minimum of the differential conductivity is\nlocated close to the Fermi level and has a non-zero value, which we ascribe to\nthe metallic character of the underlying Ge$_2$Pt substrate. Near the\nreconstructed germanene zigzag edges the shape of the differential conductivity\nchanges from a V-shape to a more parabolic-like shape, revealing that the\nreconstructed germanene zigzag edges do not exhibit a pronounced metallic edge\nstate.\n", "  Recently, a scheme based on the method of weak measurements to register the\ntrajectories of photons passing through a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nwas proposed [L. Vaidman, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{87}, 052104 (2013)] and then\nrealized [A. Danan, D. Farfurnik, S. Bar-Ad, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{111}, 240402 (2013)]. Interpreting the results of the experiment, the\nauthors concluded that \"the photons do not always follow continuous\ntrajectories\". It is shown in this work that these results can be easily and\nclearly explained in terms of traditional classical electrodynamics or quantum\nmechanics implying the continuity of all possible paths of photons.\nConsequently, a new concept of disconnected trajectories proposed by the\nauthors of work [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 240402 (2013)] is unnecessary.\n", "  Energy conversion in a physical system requires time-translation invariance\nbreaking according to Noether's theorem. Closely associated with this\nsymmetry-conservation relation, the frequencies of electromagnetic waves are\nfound to be converted as the waves propagate through a temporally varying\nmedium. Thus, effective temporal control of the medium, be it artificial or\nnatural, through which the waves are propagating, lies at the heart of linear\noptical frequency conversion. Here, we propose rapidly time-variant\nmetasurfaces as a frequency-conversion platform and experimentally demonstrate\ntheir efficacy at THz frequencies. The proposed metasurface is designed for the\nsudden merging of two distinct resonances into a single resonance upon\nultrafast optical excitation. From this spectrally-engineered temporal boundary\nonward, the merged-resonance frequency component is radiated. In addition,\ntemporal coherence of the two original resonating modes with respect to the\nabrupt temporal boundary is found to be strongly related to the amount of\nfrequency conversion as well as the phase of the converted wave. Due to their\ndesign flexibility, time-variant metasurfaces may become on-demand frequency\nsynthesizers for various frequency ranges.\n", "  How self-organized networks develop, mature and degenerate is a key question\nfor sociotechnical, cyberphysical and biological systems with potential\napplications from tackling violent extremism through to neurological diseases.\nSo far, it has proved impossible to measure the continuous-time evolution of\nany in vivo organism network from birth to death. Here we provide such a study\nwhich crosses all organizational and temporal scales, from individual\ncomponents (10^1) through to the mesoscopic (10^3) and entire system scale\n(10^6). These continuous-time data reveal a lifespan driven by punctuated,\nreal-time co-evolution of the structural and functional networks. Aging sees\nthese structural and functional networks gradually diverge in terms of their\nsmall-worldness and eventually their connectivity. Dying emerges as an extended\nprocess associated with the formation of large but disjoint functional\nsub-networks together with an increasingly detached core. Our mathematical\nmodel quantifies the very different impacts that interventions will have on the\noverall lifetime, period of initial growth, peak of potency, and duration of\nold age, depending on when and how they are administered. In addition to their\ndirect relevance to online extremism, our findings offer fresh insight into\naging in any network system of comparable complexity for which extensive in\nvivo data is not yet available.\n", "  The recent demonstrations of electrical manipulation and detection of\nantiferromagnetic spins have opened up a chapter in the spintronics story. In\nthis article, we review the emerging research field that is exploring synergies\nbetween antiferromagnetic spintronics and topological structures in real and\nmomentum space. Active topics include proposals to realize Majorana fermions in\nan antiferromagnetic topological superconductors, to control topological\nprotection of Dirac points by manipulating antiferromagnetic order parameters,\nand to exploit the anomalous and topological Hall effects of zero net moment\nantiferromagnets. We explain the basic physics concepts behind these proposals,\nand discuss potential applications of topological antiferromagnetic\nspintronics.\n", "  In the present paper we exhaustively examine the physical status of the\nsocalled Matese-Whitman mass function [J.J. Matese and P.G. Whitman, Phys. Rev.\nD, 22, 1270 (1980)]. As a first step, we construct the relevant Einstein field\nequations with an anisotropic matter distribution under the approach of\nConformal killing Vector. In the intermideate step we find a set of exact\nsolutions by using the Matese-Whitman mass function. Eventually we conduct\nseveral physical tests to explore features of the applied mass function in\nconnection to the specific compact stars. It can be observed that all the\nfeatures of the model based on the Matese-Whitman mass function are of physical\ninterests.\n", "  The structure and nature of water confined between hydrophobic molybdenum\ndisulfide (MoS2) and graphene (Gr) are investigated at room temperature by\nmeans of atomic force microscopy. We find the formation of two-dimensional (2D)\ncrystalline ice layers. In contrast to the hexagonal ice 'bilayers' of bulk\nice, these 2D crystalline ice phases consist of two planar hexagonal layers.\nAdditional water condensation leads to either lateral expansion of the ice\nlayers or to the formation of three-dimensional water droplets on top or at the\nedges of the two-layer ice, indicating that water does not wet these planar ice\nfilms. The results presented here are in line with a recent theory suggesting\nthat water confined between hydrophobic walls forms 2D crystalline two-layer\nice with a nontetrahedral geometry and intrahydrogen bonding. The lack of\ndangling bonds on either surface of the ice film gives rise to a hydrophobic\ncharacter. The unusual geometry of these ice films is of great potential\nimportance in biological systems with water in direct contact with hydrophobic\nsurfaces.\n", "  We develop an efficient numerical method for the probabilistic quantification\nof the response statistics of nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom structural\nsystems under extreme forcing events, emphasizing accurate heavy-tail\nstatistics. The response is decomposed to a statistically stationary part and\nan intermittent component. The stationary part is quantified using a\nstatistical linearization method while the intermittent part, associated with\nextreme transient responses, is quantified through i) either a few carefully\nselected simulations or ii) through the use of effective measures (effective\nstiffness and damping). The developed approach is able to accurately capture\nthe extreme response statistics orders of magnitude faster compared with direct\nmethods. The scheme is applied to the design and optimization of small\nattachments that can mitigate and suppress extreme forcing events delivered to\na primary structural system. Specifically, we consider the problem of\nsuppression of extreme responses in two prototype ocean engineering systems.\nFirst, we consider linear and cubic springs and perform parametric optimization\nby minimizing the forth-order moments of the response. We then consider a more\ngeneric, possibly asymmetric, piecewise linear spring and optimize its\nnonlinear characteristics. The resulting asymmetric spring design far\noutperforms the optimal cubic energy sink and the linear tuned mass dampers.\n", "  To date, germanene has only been synthesized on metallic substrates. A\nmetallic substrate is usually detrimental for the two-dimensional Dirac nature\nof germanene because the important electronic states near the Fermi level of\ngermanene can hybridize with the electronic states of the metallic substrate.\nHere we report the successful synthesis of germanene on molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS$_2$), a band gap material. Pre-existing defects in the MoS$_2$ surface act\nas preferential nucleation sites for the germanene islands. The lattice\nconstant of the germanene layer (3.8 $\\pm$ 0.2 \\AA) is about 20\\% larger than\nthe lattice constant of the MoS$_2$ substrate (3.16 \\AA). Scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal\nthat there are, besides the linearly dispersing bands at the $K$ points, two\nparabolic bands that cross the Fermi level at the $\\Gamma$ point.\n", "  Using a left multiplication defined on a right quaternionic Hilbert space, we\nshall demonstrate that pure squeezed states can be defined with all the desired\nproperties on a right quaternionic Hilbert space. Further, we shall also\ndemonstrate squeezed states can be defined on the same Hilbert space, but the\nnoncommutativity of quaternions prevent us in getting the desired results.\nHowever, we will show that if once considers the quaternionic slice wise\napproach, then the desired properties can be obtained for quaternionic squeezed\nstates.\n", "  We have investigated the growth of Pt on Ge(110) using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy. The deposition of several monolayers of Pt on\nGe(110) followed by annealing at 1100 K results in the formation of\nthree-dimensional metallic Pt-Ge nanocrystals. The outermost layer of these\ncrystals exhibits a honeycomb structure. The honeycomb structure is composed of\ntwo hexagonal sub-lattices that are displaced vertically by 0.2 {\\AA} with\nrespect to each other. The nearest-neighbor distance of the atoms in the\nhoneycomb lattice is 2.5${\\pm}$0.1 {\\AA}, i.e. very close to the predicted\nnearest-neighbor distance in germanene (2.4 {\\AA}). Scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy reveals that the atomic layer underneath the honeycomb layer is\nmore metallic than the honeycomb layer itself. These observations are in line\nwith a model recently proposed for metal di-(silicides/)germanides: a hexagonal\ncrystal with metal layers separated by semiconductor layers with a honeycomb\nlattice. Based on our observations we propose that the outermost layer of the\nGe2Pt nanocrystal is a germanene layer.\n", "  Guided modes in anisotropic two-dimensional van der Waals materials are\nexperimentally investigated and their refractive indices in visible wavelengths\nare extracted. Our method involves near-field scanning optical microscopy of\nwaveguide (transverse electric) and surface plasmon polariton (transverse\nmagnetic) modes in h-BN/SiO2/Si and Ag/h-BN stacks, respectively. We determine\nthe dispersion of these modes and use this relationship to extract anisotropic\nrefractive indices of h-BN flakes. In the wavelength interval 550-700 nm, the\nin-plane and out-of-plane refractive indices are in the range 1.98-2.12 and\n1.45-2.12, respectively. Our approach of using near-field scanning optical\nmicroscopy allows for direct study of interaction between light and\ntwo-dimensional van der Waals materials and heterostructures.\n", "  In the course of analyzing the axiomatic principles on which statistical\nphysics is based, the assumption of the limited correctness of the postulate\nthat all allowable microstates of a closed system are equally probable was\nchecked. This article reports the results of a study of a quasi-equivalent\nsystem within which isotropic radiation interacts with a phase diffraction\ngrating. A simulated computer model of such interaction showed that anisotropic\npolarization must arise in the diffracted radiation, which reduces the\nBoltzmann entropy of the entire system and allows an external observer to\nobtain information on the grating's surface topology. This prediction was\nconfirmed when it was experimentally checked directly on actual apparatus.\n", "  From a modern perspective cosmology is a historical science in so far that it\ndeals with the development of the universe since its origin some 14 billion\nyears ago. The origin itself may not be subject to scientific analysis and\nexplanation. Nonetheless, there are theories that claim to explain the ultimate\norigin or \"creation\" of the universe. As shown by the history of cosmological\nthought, the very concept of \"origin\" is problematic and can be understood in\ndifferent ways. While it is normally understood as a temporal concept, cosmic\norigin is not temporal by necessity. The universe can be assigned an origin\neven though it has no definite age. In order to clarify the question a view of\nearlier ideas will be helpful, these ideas coming not only from astronomy but\nalso from philosophy and theology.\n", "  Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs), which have the properties and\nfunctionalities of both semiconductors and ferromagnets, provide fascinating\nopportunities for basic research in condensed matter physics and device\napplications. Over the past two decades, however, intensive studies on various\nFMS materials, inspired by the influential mean-field Zener (MFZ) model have\nfailed to realise reliable FMSs that have a high Curie temperature (Tc > 300\nK), good compatibility with semiconductor electronics, and characteristics\nsuperior to those of their non-magnetic host semiconductors. Here, we\ndemonstrate a new n type Fe-doped narrow-gap III-V FMS, (In,Fe)Sb, in which\nferromagnetic order is induced by electron carriers, and its Tc is unexpectedly\nhigh, reaching ~335 K at a modest Fe concentration of 16%. Furthermore, we show\nthat by utilizing the large anomalous Hall effect of (In,Fe)Sb at room\ntemperature, it is possible to obtain a Hall sensor with a very high\nsensitivity that surpasses that of the best commercially available InSb Hall\nsensor devices. Our results reveal a new design rule of FMSs that is not\nexpected from the conventional MFZ model. (This work was presented at the JSAP\nSpring meeting, presentation No. E15a-501-2:\nhttps://confit.atlas.jp/guide/event/jsap2017s/subject/15a-501-2/advanced)\n", "  The laboratory work presented here, simulates the chemistry on icy dust\ngrains as typical for the 'CO freeze-out stage' in dark molecular clouds. It\ndiffers from previous studies in that solid-state hydrogenation and vacuum\nUV-photoprocessing are applied simultaneously to co-depositing molecules. In\nparallel, the reactions at play are described for fully characterized\nlaboratory conditions. The focus is on the formation of molecules containing\nboth carbon and nitrogen atoms, starting with NO in CO-, H2CO-, and CH3OH-rich\nices at 13 K. The experiments yield three important conclusions. 1. Without\nUV-processing hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is formed, as reported previously. 2. With\nUV-processing (energetic) NH2 is formed through photodissociation of NH2OH.\nThis radical is key in the formation of species with an N-C bond. 3. The\nformation of three N-C bearing species, HNCO, OCN- and NH2CHO is observed. The\nexperiments put a clear chemical link between these species; OCN- is found to\nbe a direct derivative of HNCO and the latter is shown to have the same\nprecursor as formamide (NH2CHO). Moreover, the addition of VUV competing\nchannels decreases the amount of NO molecules converted into NH2OH by at least\none order of magnitude. Consequently, this decrease in NH2OH formation yield\ndirectly influences the amount of NO molecules that can be converted into HNCO,\nOCN- and NH2CHO.\n", "  In this work we experimentally study a granular rotor which is similar to the\nfamous Smoluchowski-Feynman device and which consists of a rotor with four\nvanes immersed in a granular gas. Each side of the vanes can be composed of two\ndifferent materials, creating a rotational asymmetry and turning the rotor into\na ratchet. When the granular temperature is high, the rotor is in movement all\nthe time, and its angular velocity distribution is well described by the\nBrownian Limit discussed in previous works. When the granular temperature is\nlowered considerably we enter the so-called Single Kick Limit, where collisions\noccur rarely and the unavoidable external friction causes the rotor to be at\nrest for most of the time. We find that the existing models are not capable of\nadequately describing the experimentally observed distribution in this limit.\nWe trace back this discrepancy to the non-constancy of the deceleration due to\nexternal friction and show that incorporating this effect into the existing\nmodels leads to full agreement with our experiments. Subsequently, we extend\nthis model to describe the angular velocity distribution of the rotor for any\ntemperature of the gas, and obtain a very good agreement between the model and\nexperimental data.\n", "  Some of the most interesting quantities associated with a factor graph are\nits marginals and its partition sum. For factor graphs \\emph{without cycles}\nand moderate message update complexities, the sum-product algorithm (SPA) can\nbe used to efficiently compute these quantities exactly. Moreover, for various\nclasses of factor graphs \\emph{with cycles}, the SPA has been successfully\napplied to efficiently compute good approximations to these quantities. Note\nthat in the case of factor graphs with cycles, the local functions are usually\nnon-negative real-valued functions. In this paper we introduce a class of\nfactor graphs, called double-edge factor graphs (DE-FGs), which allow local\nfunctions to be complex-valued and only require them, in some suitable sense,\nto be positive semi-definite. We discuss various properties of the SPA when\nrunning it on DE-FGs and we show promising numerical results for various\nexample DE-FGs, some of which have connections to quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  System compliances of two testing machines (Keysight T150 and Instron 3365)\nwere studied for the tensile testing of carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers. Due to\nthe different gripping methods, the T150's system compliance was nearly zero,\nwhile that of the Instron was nonnegligible. By analyzing the data dispersion\nwith the Weibull theory, a safe gauge length of >10 mm was suggested for CNT\nfibers. Therefore, a standard test procedure should involve the compliance\nevaluation, choice of gauge length, and Weibull statistical analysis.\n", "  The stability against quench is one of the main issue to be pursued in a\nsuperconducting material which should be able to perform at very high levels of\ncurrent densities. Here we focus on the connection between the critical current\n$I_c$ and the quenching current $I^*$ associated to the so-called flux-flow\ninstability phenomenon, which sets in as an abrupt transition from the flux\nflow state to the normal state. To this purpose, we analyze several\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of three types of iron-based thin films,\nacquired at different temperature and applied magnetic field values. For these\nsamples, we discuss the impact of a possible coexistence of intrinsic\nelectronic mechanisms and extrinsic thermal effects on the quenching current\ndependence upon the applied magnetic field. The differences between the\nquenching current and the critical current are reported also in the case of\npredominant intrinsic mechanisms. Carrying out a comparison with\nhigh-temperature cuprate superconductors, we suggest which material can be the\nbest trade-off between maximum operating temperature, higher upper critical\nfield and stability under high current bias.\n"]}
