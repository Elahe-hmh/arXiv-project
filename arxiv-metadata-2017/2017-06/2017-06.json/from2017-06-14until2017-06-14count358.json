["  We use the exact renormalization group (ERG) perturbatively to construct the\nWilson action for the two-dimensional O(N) non-linear sigma model. The\nconstruction amounts to regularization of a non-linear symmetry with a momentum\ncutoff. A quadratically divergent potential is generated by the momentum\ncutoff, but its non-invariance is compensated by the jacobian of the non-linear\nsymmetry transformation.\n", "  A type Ia supernova is thought to be a thermonuclear explosion of either a\nsingle carbon-oxygen white dwarf or of a pair of merging white dwarfs. The\nexplosion fuses a large amount of radioactive 56Ni. After the explosion, the\ndecay chain from 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe generates gamma-ray photons, which are\nreprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission.\nHere we report the detection of 56Co lines at energies of 847 and 1238 keV and\na gamma-ray continuum in the 200-400 keV band from the type Ia supernova 2014J\nin the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar\nmasses of radioactive 56Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line\nbroadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of\n10000 +/- 3000 km/s. The observed gamma-ray properties are in broad agreement\nwith the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough\nto be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not immediately exclude more\ncomplicated merger scenarios, which fuse comparable amount of 56Ni.\n", "  We present a semi-classical analytic model for spherical core-shell surface\nplasmon lasers. Within this model, we drop the widely used one-mode\napproximations in favor of fully electromagnetic Mie theory. This allows for\nincorporation of realistic gain relaxation rates that so far have been\nmassively underestimated. Especially, higher order modes can undermine and even\nreverse the beneficial effects of the strong Purcell effect in such systems.\nOur model gives a clear view on gain- and resonator-requirements, as well as on\nthe output characteristics that will help experimenters to design more\nefficient particle-based spasers.\n", "  Explaining the origin and evolution of exoplanetary \"hot Jupiters\" remains a\nsignificant challenge. One possible mechanism for their production is\nplanet-planet interactions, which produces hot Jupiters from planets born far\nfrom their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. In the much\nmore likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, can\nhot Jupiters can be formed in star clusters? Our N-body simulations of\nplanetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative,\nand show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event. We detail three case\nstudies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on highly eccentric\norbits that can only occur inside star clusters. The hot Jupiters' orbits bear\nremarkable similarities to those of some of the most extreme exoplanets known:\nHAT-P-32 b, HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b and GJ 876 d. If stellar perturbations formed\nthese hot Jupiters then our simulations predict that these very hot, inner\nplanets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in highly\neccentric orbits.\n", "  The decay modes $\\bar{B}_s \\rightarrow \\pi^0(\\rho^0 )\\,\\eta^{(')} $ are\ndominated by electroweak penguins that are small in the standard model. In this\nwork we investigate the contributions to these penguins from a model with an\nadditional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and show there effects on the branching\nratios of $\\bar{B}_s \\rightarrow \\pi^0(\\rho^0 )\\,\\eta^{(')} $. In a scenario of\nthe model, where $Z^\\prime$ couplings to the left-handed quarks vanish, we show\nthat the maximum enhancement occurs in the branching ratio of $\\bar B^0_s\\to\n\\,\\pi^0\\,\\eta'$ where it can reach $6$ times the SM prediction. On the other\nhand, in a scenario of the model where $Z^\\prime$ couplings to both left-handed\nand right-handed quarks do not vanish, we find that $Z^\\prime$ contributions\ncan enhance the branching ratio of $B^0_s\\to\\,\\rho^0\\,\\eta$ up to one order of\nmagnitude comparing to the SM prediction for several sets of the parameter\nspace where both $ \\Delta M_{B_s}$ and $S_{\\psi\\phi}$ constraints are\nsatisfied. This kind of enhancement occurs for a rather fine-tuned point where\n$ \\Delta M_{B_s}$ constraint on $\\mid S_{SM} (B_s) + S_{Z'} (B_s)\\mid $ is\nfulfilled by overcompensating the SM via $S_{Z'} (B_s) \\simeq -2 S_{SM} (B_s)$.\n", "  We use canonically-twisted modules for a certain super vertex operator\nalgebra to construct the umbral moonshine module for the unique Niemeier\nlattice that coincides with its root sublattice. In particular, we give\nexplicit expressions for the vector-valued mock modular forms attached to\nautomorphisms of this lattice by umbral moonshine. We also characterize the\nvector-valued mock modular forms arising, in which four of Ramanujan's fifth\norder mock theta functions appear as components.\n", "  We propose a quantum voting system, in the spirit of quantum games such as\nthe quantum Prisoner's Dilemma. Our scheme enables a constitution to violate a\nquantum analog of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Arrow's Theorem is a claim\nproved deductively in economics: Every (classical) constitution endowed with\nthree innocuous-seeming properties is a dictatorship. We construct quantum\nanalogs of constitutions, of the properties, and of Arrow's Theorem. A quantum\nversion of majority rule, we show, violates this Quantum Arrow Conjecture. Our\nvoting system allows for tactical-voting strategies reliant on entanglement,\ninterference, and superpositions. This contribution to quantum game theory\nhelps elucidate how quantum phenomena can be harnessed for strategic advantage.\n", "  Distorted plane waves, sometimes called Eisenstein functions, are a family of\neigenfunctions of a Schr\\\"odinger operator that are not square integrable. More\nprecisely, they can be written as the sum of a plane wave and an outgoing wave.\nWe shall study distorted plane waves in the semiclassical limit, in a general\nsetting which includes manifolds that are Euclidean near infinity, under the\nhypothesis that the classical dynamics is hyperbolic close to the trapped set,\nand that some topological pressure is negative.\n", "  This paper concerns the questions of flexibility and rigidity of solutions to\nthe Monge-Amp\\`ere equation which arises as a natural geometrical constraint in\nprestrained nonlinear elasticity. In particular, we focus on anomalous i.e.\n\"flexible\" weak solutions that can be constructed through methods of convex\nintegration \\`a la Nash & Kuiper and establish the related h-principle for the\nMonge-Amp\\`ere equation in two dimensions\n", "  We here investigate the entanglement structure of the ground state of a\n(3+1)-dimensional U(1) quantum spin liquid, which is described by the\ndeconfined phase of a compact U(1) gauge theory. A gapless photon is the only\nlow-energy excitation, with matter existing as deconfined but gapped\nexcitations of the system. It is found that, for a given bipartition of the\nsystem, the elements of the entanglement spectrum can be grouped according to\nthe electric flux between the two regions, leading to a useful interpretation\nof the entanglement spectrum in terms of electric charges living on the\nboundary. The entanglement spectrum is also given additional structure due to\nthe presence of the gapless photon. Making use of the Bisognano-Wichmann\ntheorem and a local thermal approximation, these two contributions to the\nentanglement (particle and photon) are recast in terms of boundary and bulk\ncontributions, respectively. Both pieces of the entanglement structure give\nrise to universal subleading terms (relative to the area law) in the\nentanglement entropy, which are logarithmic in the system size (log L), as\nopposed to the subleading constant term in gapped topologically ordered\nsystems. The photon subleading logarithm arises from the low-energy conformal\nfield theory and is essentially local in character. The particle subleading\nlogarithm arises due to the constraint of closed electric loops in the\nwavefunction and is shown to be the natural generalization of topological\nentanglement entropy to the U(1) spin liquid. This contribution to the\nentanglement entropy can be isolated by means of the Grover-Turner-Vishwanath\nconstruction (which generalizes the Kitaev-Preskill scheme to three\ndimensions).\n", "  Superconductivity is an emergent phenomena in the sense that the energy scale\nassociated with Cooper pairing is generically much lower than the typical\nkinetic energy of electrons. Addressing the mechanism of Cooper pairing amounts\nto determine the effective interaction that operates at low energies. Deriving\nsuch an interaction from a bottom-up approach has not been possible for any\nsuperconductor, especially strongly correlated ones. Top-down approaches, where\none assumes an effective interaction, is plagued with the difficulty of\nextracting the implied electronic instabilities without uncontrolled\napproximations. These facts severely hinder our ability to determine the\npairing mechanism for high temperature superconductors. Here we perform\nlarge-scale sign-problem-free quantum Monte-Carlo simulations on an effective\ntheory, featured with antiferromagnetic and nematic fluctuations, to study the\nintertwined antiferromagnetic, superconducting, and charge density wave\ninstabilities of the cuprates. Our results suggest the inclusion of nematic\nfluctuations is essential in order to produce the observed type of charge\ndensity wave ordering. Interestingly we find that the d-wave Cooper pairing is\nenhanced by nematic fluctuations.\n", "  We consider the unsteady thin-film dynamics of a long bubble of negligible\nviscosity that advances at a uniform speed in a cylindrical capillary tube. The\nbubble displaces a viscous, nonwetting fluid, creating a thin film between its\ninterface and the tube walls. The film is considered thin enough that\nintermolecular forces in the form of van der Waals attractions are significant\nand thin-film rupture is possible. In the case of negligible intermolecular\nforces, a steady-state solution exits where a film of uniform thickness is\ndeposited in the annular region between the bubble interface and the tube\nwalls. However, once intermolecular interactions are important, the interface\nis perturbed out of its steady state and either (i) the perturbation grows\nsufficiently before reaching the rear meniscus of the bubble such that rupture\noccurs; or (ii) the perturbation remains small due to weak intermolecular\nforces until it leaves the bubble interface through the rear meniscus. We\nobtain, both numerically and asymptotically, the time-scale over which rupture\noccurs, and thus, we find a critical capillary number, depending on the bubble\nlength and the strength of the intermolecular forces, below which the film is\npredicted to rupture.\n", "  The model by Nieves, Ruiz-Simo, and Vicente-Vacas and their group (IFIC,\nValencia, Spain) for 2p2h reactions that produce QE-like (no pion) final states\nhas been implemented in GENIE. Since the model currently does not predict the\nkinematics of the outgoing hadrons, a simple two-nucleon system is grafted onto\nthe model's prediction of isospin, energy transfer, and momentum transfer.\nThese two nucleons are then given to the GENIE FSI models. This technical note\nis a guide to the kind of information available from this model and some\nlimitations. There are several figures that illustrate the output of the model,\nand detailed discussion of the physics context for this model. Finally, any\nother authors' model (or variations of this one) that can be expressed as\nhadronic tensors for total and pn initial state will be easy to incorporate\ninto this framework, or possibly be made available as a reweight to events\ngenerated with this model. The 2017 version of this document is updated to\nreflect the as-released GENIE 2.12.6 version of the code, which produces\nidentical results to the development versions.\n", "  Quantum quenches display universal scaling in several regimes. For quenches\nwhich start from a gapped phase and cross a critical point, with a rate slow\ncompared to the initial gap, many systems obey Kibble-Zurek scaling. More\nrecently, a different scaling behaviour has been shown to occur when the quench\nrate is fast compared to all other physical scales, but still slow compared to\nthe UV cutoff. We investigate the passage from fast to slow quenches in scalar\nand fermionic free field theories with time dependent masses for which the\ndynamics can be solved exactly for all quench rates. We find that renormalized\none point functions smoothly cross over between the regimes.\n", "  A discretization of the wave-number space is proposed, using nested\npolyhedra, in the form of alternating dodecahedra and icosahedra that are\nself-similarly scaled. This particular choice allows the possibility of forming\ntriangles using only discretized wave-vectors when the scaling between two\nconsecutive dodecahedra is equal to the golden ratio, and the icosahedron\nbetween the two dodecahedra is the dual of the inner dodecahedron.\nAlternatively, the same discretization can be described as a logarithmically\nspaced (with a scaling equal to the golden ratio), nested\ndodecahedron-icosahedron compounds. A wave-vector which points from the origin\nto a vertex of such a mesh, can always find two other discretized wave-vectors\nthat are also on the vertices of the mesh (which is not true for an arbitrary\nmesh). Thus, the nested polyhedra grid can be thought of as a reduction (or\ndecimation) of the Fourier space using a particular set of self-similar triads\naranged approximately in a spherical form. For each vertex (i.e. discretized\nwave-vector) in this space, there are either 9 or 15 pairs of vertices (i.e.\nwave-vectors) with which the initial vertex can interact to form a triangle.\nThis allows the reduction of the convolution integral in the Navier-Stokes\nequation to a sum over 9 or 15 interaction pairs. Transforming the equation in\nFourier space, to a network of interacting nodes, that can be constructed as a\nnumerical model, which evolves each component of the velocity vector on each\nnode of the network. Such a model gives the usual Kolmogorov spectrum. Since\nthe scaling is logarithmic, and the number of nodes for each scale is constant,\na very large inertial range can be considered with a much lower number of\ndegrees of freedom. Incidentally, by assuming isotropy and a certain relation\nbetween the phases, the model can be used to systematically derive three\ndimensional shell models.\n", "  We present two novel matter-wave Sagnac interferometers based on ring- shaped\ntime-averaged adiabatic potentials (TAAP). For both the atoms are put into a\nsuperposition of two different spin states and manipulated independently using\nelliptically polarized rf-fields. In the first interferometer the atoms are\naccelerated by spin-state-dependent forces and then travel around the ring in a\nmatter-wave guide. In the second one the atoms are fully trapped during the\nentire interferometric sequence and are moved around the ring in two\nspin-state-dependent \"buckets\". Corrections to the ideal Sagnac phase are\ninvestigated for both cases. We experimentally demonstrate the key atom-optical\nelements of the interferometer such as the independent manipulation of two\ndifferent spin states in the ring-shaped potentials under identical\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  We review the paradox of low energy excitations about an AdS black hole. An\nappropriately chosen unitary operator in the boundary theory can create a\nlocally strong excitation near the black hole horizon, whose global energy is\nsmall as a result of the gravitational redshift. The paradox is that this seems\nto violate a general rule of statistical mechanics, which states that an\noperator with energy parametrically smaller than $k T$ cannot create a\nsignificant excitation in a thermal system. When we carefully examine the\nposition dependence of the boundary unitary operator that produces the\nexcitation and the bulk observable necessary to detect the anomalously large\neffect, we find that they do not both fit in a single causal patch. This\nfollows from a remarkable property of position space AdS correlators that we\nestablish explicitly, and resolves the paradox in a generic state of the\nsystem, since no combination of observers can both create the excitation and\nobserve its effect. As a special case of our analysis, we show how this\nresolves the \"Born rule\" paradox of arXiv:1506.01337 and we verify our solution\nusing an independent calculation. We then consider boundary states that are\nfinely tuned to display a spontaneous excitation outside the causal patch of\nthe infalling observer, and we propose a version of causal patch\ncomplementarity in AdS/CFT that resolves the paradox for such states as well.\n", "  The band theory of solids is arguably the most successful theory of condensed\nmatter physics, providing the description of the electronic energy levels in a\nvariety of materials. Electronic wavefunctions obtained from the band theory\nallow for a topological characterization of the system and the electronic\nspectrum may host robust, topologically protected fermionic quasiparticles.\nMany of these quasiparticles are analogs of the elementary particles of the\nStandard Model, but others do not have a counterpart in relativistic\nhigh-energy theories. A full list of possible quasiparticles in solids is still\nunknown, even in the non-interacting case. Here, we report on a new type of\nfermionic excitation that appears in metals. This excitation forms a nodal\nchain -- a chain of connected loops in momentum space -- along which conduction\nand valence band touch. We prove that the nodal chain is topologically distinct\nfrom any other excitation reported before. We discuss the symmetry requirements\nfor the appearance of this novel excitation and predict that it is realized in\nan existing material IrF$_4$, as well as in other compounds of this material\nclass. Using IrF$_4$ as an example, we provide a detailed discussion of the\ntopological surface states associated with the nodal chain. Furthermore, we\nargue that the presence of the novel quasiparticles results in anomalous\nmagnetotransport properties, distinct from those of the known materials.\n", "  Kapustin-Witten (KW) equations are encountered in the localization of the\ntopological N=4 SYM theory. Mikhaylov has constructed model solutions of KW\nequations for the boundary 't~Hooft operators on a half space. Direct proof of\nthe solutions boils down to check a boundary condition. There are two\ncomputational difficulties in explicitly constructing the solutions to Lie\nalgebra of higher rank. The first one is related to the commutation of\ngenerators of Lie algebra. We derived an identity which effectively reduces\nthis computational difficulty. The second one involves the number of ways from\nthe highest weights to other weights in the fundamental representation. For\nADE-type gauge groups, we found an amazing formula which can be used to rewrite\nthe solutions of KW equations. This new formula of solutions bypass above two\ncomputational difficulties.\n", "  In an effort to derive temperature based criteria of habitability for\nmulticellular life, we investigated the thermal limits of terrestrial\npoikilotherms, i.e. organisms whose body temperature and the functioning of all\nvital processes is directly affected by the ambient temperature. Multicellular\npoikilotherms are the most common and evolutionarily ancient form of complex\nlife on earth. The thermal limits for their active metabolism and reproduction\nare bracketed by the temperature interval 0C<T<50C. The same interval applies\nto the photosynthetic production of oxygen, an essential ingredient of complex\nlife, and for the generation of atmospheric biosignatures. Analysis of the main\nmechanisms responsible for the thermal thresholds of terrestrial life suggests\nthat the same mechanisms would apply to other forms of chemical life. We\npropose a habitability index for complex life, h050, representing the mean\norbital fraction of planetary surface that satisfies the temperature limits\n0C<T<50C. With the aid of a climate model tailored for the calculation of the\nsurface temperature of Earth-like planets, we calculated h050 as a function of\nplanet insolation S, and atmospheric columnar mass Natm, for a few earth-like\natmospheric compositions. By displaying h050 as a function of S and Natm, we\nbuilt up an atmospheric mass habitable zone (AMHZ) for complex life. At\nvariance with the classic habitable zone, the inner edge of the complex life HZ\nis not affected by the uncertainties inherent to the calculation of the runaway\ngreenhouse limit. The complex life HZ is significantly narrower than the HZ of\ndry planets. Our calculations illustrate how changes in ambient conditions\ndependent on S and Natm, such as temperature excursions and surface dose of\nsecondary particles of cosmic rays, may influence the type of life potentially\npresent at different epochs of planetary evolution inside the AMHZ.\n", "  We use the Iyer-Wald formalism to derive an extended first law of\nentanglement that includes variations in the cosmological constant, Newton's\nconstant and --in the case of higher-derivative theories-- all the additional\ncouplings of the theory. In Einstein gravity, where the number of degrees of\nfreedom $N^2$ of the dual field theory is a function of $\\Lambda$ and $G$, our\napproach allows us to vary $N$ keeping the field theory scale fixed or to vary\nthe field theory scale keeping $N$ fixed. We also derive an extended first law\nof entanglement for Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity and show that in these\ncases all the extra variations reorganize nicely in terms of the central\ncharges of the theory. Finally, we comment on the implications for\nrenormalization group flows and c-theorems in higher dimensions.\n", "  Specific heat has had an important role in the study of superfluidity and\nsuperconductivity, and could provide important information about the fractional\nquantum Hall effect as well. However, traditional measurements of the specific\nheat of a two-dimensional electron gas are difficult due to the large\nbackground contribution of the phonon bath, even at very low temperatures.\nHere, we report measurements of the specific heat per electron in the second\nLandau level by measuring the thermalization time between the electrons and\nphonons. We observe activated behaviour of the specific heat of the 5/2 and 7/3\nfractional quantum Hall states, and extract the entropy by integrating over\ntemperature. Our results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements\nof the entropy via longitudinal thermopower. Extending the technique to lower\ntemperatures could lead to detection of the non-Abelian entropy predicted for\nbulk quasiparticles at 5/2 filling\n", "  Topological metals and semimetals (TMs) have recently drawn significant\ninterest. These materials give rise to condensed matter realizations of many\nimportant concepts in high-energy physics, leading to wide-ranging protected\nproperties in transport and spectroscopic experiments. The most studied TMs,\ni.e., Weyl and Dirac semimetals, feature quasiparticles that are direct\nanalogues of the textbook elementary particles. Moreover, the TMs known so far\ncan be characterized based on the dimensionality of the band crossing. While\nWeyl and Dirac semimetals feature zero-dimensional points, the band crossing of\nnodal-line semimetals forms a one-dimensional closed loop. In this paper, we\nidentify a TM which breaks the above paradigms. Firstly, the TM features\ntriply-degenerate band crossing in a symmorphic lattice, hence realizing\nemergent fermionic quasiparticles not present in quantum field theory.\nSecondly, the band crossing is neither 0D nor 1D. Instead, it consists of two\nisolated triply-degenerate nodes interconnected by multi-segments of lines with\ntwo-fold degeneracy. We present materials candidates. We further show that\ntriplydegenerate band crossings in symmorphic crystals give rise to a Landau\nlevel spectrum distinct from the known TMs, suggesting novel magneto-transport\nresponses. Our results open the door for realizing new topological phenomena\nand fermions including transport anomalies and spectroscopic responses in\nmetallic crystals with nontrivial topology beyond the Weyl/Dirac paradigm.\n", "  We show that Coulomb branches of quiver gauge theories of affine type $A$ are\nCherkis bow varieties, which have been introduced as ADHM type description of\nmoduli space of instantons on the Taub-NUT space equivariant under a cyclic\ngroup action.\n", "  Contact has been well established as an important quantity to govern dilute\nquantum systems, in which the pairwise correlation at short distance traces a\nbroad range of thermodynamic properties. So far, studies have been focusing on\ncontact in individual angular momentum channels. Here, we point out that, to\nhave a complete description of the pairwise correlation in a general dilute\nquantum systems, contact should be defined as a matrix. Whereas the diagonal\nterms of such matrix include contact of all partial wave scatterings, the\noff-diagonal terms, which elude previous studies in the literature,\ncharacterise the coherence of the asymptotic pairwise wavefunction in the\nangular momentum space and determine important thermodynamic quantities\nincluding the momentum distribution. Contact matrix allows physicists to access\nunexplored connections between short-range correlations and macroscopic quantum\nphenomena. As an example, we show the direct connection between contact matrix\nand order parameters of a superfluid with mixed partial waves.\n", "  Global maps of Jupiter's atmospheric temperatures, gaseous composition and\naerosol opacity are derived from a programme of 5-20 $\\mu$m mid-infrared\nspectroscopic observations using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph\n(TEXES) on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Image cubes from December\n2014 in eight spectral channels, with spectral resolutions of $R\\sim2000-12000$\nand spatial resolutions of $2-4^\\circ$ latitude, are inverted to generate 3D\nmaps of tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, 2D maps of upper\ntropospheric aerosols, phosphine and ammonia, and 2D maps of stratospheric\nethane and acetylene. The results are compared to a re-analysis of Cassini\nComposite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations acquired during Cassini's\nclosest approach to Jupiter in December 2000, demonstrating that this new\narchive of ground-based mapping spectroscopy can match and surpass the quality\nof previous investigations, and will permit future studies of Jupiter's\nevolving atmosphere. We identify mid-infrared signatures of Jupiter's 5-$\\mu$m\nhotspots via simultaneous M, N and Q-band observations, which are interpreted\nas temperature and ammonia variations in the northern Equatorial Zone and on\nthe edge of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). Equatorial plumes enriched in\nNH$_3$ gas are located south-east of NH$_3$-desiccated `hotspots' on the edge\nof the NEB. Comparison of the hotspot locations in several channels across the\n5-20 $\\mu$m range indicate that these anomalous regions tilt westward with\naltitude. Aerosols and PH$_3$ are both enriched at the equator but are not\nco-located with the NH$_3$ plumes. We find hemispheric asymmetries in the\ndistribution of tropospheric PH$_3$, stratospheric hydrocarbons and the 2D wind\nfield. Jupiter's stratosphere is notably warmer at northern mid-latitudes than\nin the south in both 2000 and 2014. [Abridged]\n", "  We discuss the issue of complementarity between the confining phase and the\nHiggs phase for gauge theories in which there are no light particles below the\nscale of confinement or spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show with a number of\nexamples that even though the low energy effective theories are the same (and\ntrivial), discontinuous changes in the structure of heavy stable particles can\nsignal a phase transition and thus we can sometimes argue that two phases which\nhave different structures of heavy particles cannot be continuously connected\nand thus the phases cannot be complementary. We discuss what this means and\nsuggest that such \"stability conditions\" can be a useful physical check for\ncomplementarity.\n", "  The next generation weak lensing surveys (i.e., LSST, Euclid and WFIRST) will\nrequire exquisite control over systematic effects. In this paper, we address\nshear calibration and present the most realistic forecast to date for\nLSST/Euclid/WFIRST and CMB lensing from a stage 4 CMB experiment (CMB S4). We\nuse the CosmoLike code to simulate a joint analysis of all the two-point\nfunctions of galaxy density, galaxy shear and CMB lensing convergence. We\ninclude the full Gaussian and non-Gaussian covariances and explore the\nresulting joint likelihood with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We constrain shear\ncalibration biases while simultaneously varying cosmological parameters, galaxy\nbiases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We find that CMB lensing from\nCMB S4 enables the calibration of the shear biases down to 0.2% - 3% in 10\ntomographic bins for LSST (below the ~0.5% requirements in most tomographic\nbins), down to 0.4% - 2.4% in 10 bins for Euclid and 0.6% - 3.2% in 10 bins for\nWFIRST. For a given lensing survey, the method works best at high redshift\nwhere shear calibration is otherwise most challenging. This self-calibration is\nrobust to Gaussian photometric redshift uncertainties and to a reasonable level\nof intrinsic alignment. It is also robust to changes in the beam and the\neffectiveness of the component separation of the CMB experiment, and slowly\ndependent on its depth, making it possible with third generation CMB\nexperiments such as AdvACT and SPT-3G, as well as the Simons Observatory.\n", "  Many features of charge-4e superconductors remain unknown because even the\n\"mean-field Hamiltonian\" describing them is an interacting model. Here we\nintroduce an interacting model to describe a charge-4e superconductor (SC) deep\nin the superconducting phase, and explore its properties using quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) simulations. The QMC is sign-problem-free, but only when a Majorana\nrepresentation is employed. As a function of the chemical potential we observe\ntwo sharply-distinct behaviors: a \"strong\" quarteting phase in which charge-4e\nquartets are tightly bound (like molecules) so that charge-2e pairing does not\noccur even in the temperature $T \\to 0$ limit, and a \"weak\" quarteting phase in\nwhich a further transition to a charge-2e superconducting phase occurs at a\nlower critical temperature. Analogous issues arise in a putative Z4 spin-liquid\nwith a pseudo-Fermi surface and in characterizing charge-2e SCs with \"odd\nfrequency pairing\" (or equivalently with a \"composite order parameter\") and\nmetallic spin-nematics. Under certain circumstances, we also identified a\nstable T=0 charge-4e SC phase with gapless nodal quasiparticles. We further\ndiscuss possible relevance of our results to various experimental observations\nin 1/8-doped LBCO.\n", "  The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) was launched as part of the\nmulti-wavelength Indian ASTROSAT mission on 28 September, 2015 into a low Earth\norbit. A 6-month performance verification (PV) phase ended in March 2016, and\nthe instrument is now in the general observing phase. UVIT operates in three\nchannels: visible, near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV), each with\na choice of broad and narrow band filters, and has NUV and FUV gratings for\nlow-resolution spectroscopy. We have written a software package (JUDE) to\nconvert the Level1 data from UVIT into scientifically useful photon lists and\nimages. The routines are written in the GNU Data Language (GDL) and are\ncompatible with the IDL software package. We use these programs in our own\nscientific work, and will continue to update the programs as we gain better\nunderstanding of the UVIT instrument and its performance. We have released JUDE\nunder an Apache License.\n", "  We calculate two- and three-body decays of the (lightest) vector glueball\ninto (pseudo)scalar, (axial-)vector, as well as pseudovector and excited vector\nmesons\\textbf{ }in the framework of a model of QCD. While absolute values of\nwidths cannot be predicted because the corresponding coupling constants are\nunknown, some interesting branching ratios can be evaluated\\textbf{ }by setting\nthe mass of the yet hypothetical vector glueball to $3.8$ GeV as predicted by\nquenched Lattice QCD\\textbf{.} We find that the decay mode $\\omega\\pi\\pi$\nshould be one of the largest (both through the decay chain\n$\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow b_{1}\\pi\\rightarrow$ $\\omega\\pi\\pi$ and through the\ndirect coupling $\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow\\omega\\pi\\pi$)$.$ Similarly, the (direct\nand indirect) decay into $\\pi KK^{\\ast}(892)$ is sizable. Moreover, the decays\ninto $\\rho\\pi$ and $K^{\\ast}(892)K$ are, although subleading, possible and\ncould play a role in explaining the $\\rho\\pi$ puzzle of the charmonium state\n$\\psi(2S)$ thank to a (small) mixing with the vector glueball. The vector\nglueball can be directly formed at the ongoing BESIII experiment as well as at\nthe future PANDA experiment at the FAIR facility. If the width is sufficiently\nsmall ($\\lesssim100$ MeV) it should not escape future detection. It should be\nstressed that the employed model is based on some inputs and simplifying\nassumptions: the value of glueball mass (at present, the quenched lattice value\nis used), the lack of mixing of the glueball with other quarkonium states, and\nthe use of few interaction terms. It then represents a first step toward the\nidentification of the main decay channels of the vector glueball, but shall be\nimproved when corresponding experimental candidates and/or new lattice results\nwill be available.\n", "  Alkaline-earth(-like) ultracold atoms, trapped in optical lattices and in the\npresence of an external gauge field, can stabilise Mott insulating phases\ncharacterised by density and magnetic order. We show that this property can be\nused to realise a topological fractional pump. Our analysis is based on a\nmany-body adiabatic expansion and on time-dependent matrix-product-states\nnumerical simulations. We characterise the pumping protocol by including both\nfinite-size and non-adiabatic corrections. For a specific form of atom-atom\ninteraction, we present an exactly-solvable model of a fractional pump.\nFinally, the numerical simulations allow us to thoroughly study a realistic\nsetup amenable of an experimental realisation.\n", "  Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies provide strong\nevidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy. They can also test\nits composition, probing the energy density and particle mass of different\ndark-matter and dark-energy components. CMB data have already shown that\nultra-light axions (ULAs) with mass in the range $10^{-32}~{\\rm eV} \\to\n10^{-26}~{\\rm eV}$ compose a fraction $< 0.01$ of the cosmological critical\ndensity. Here, the sensitivity of a proposed CMB-Stage IV (CMB-S4) experiment\n(assuming a 1 arcmin beam and $< 1~\\mu K{\\rm-arcmin}$ noise levels over a sky\nfraction of 0.4) to the density of ULAs and other dark-sector components is\nassessed. CMB-S4 data should be $\\sim 10$ times more sensitive to the ULA\nenergy-density than Planck data alone, across a wide range of ULA masses\n$10^{-32}< m_{a}< 10^{-23}~{\\rm eV}$, and will probe axion decay constants of\n$f_{a}\\approx 10^{16}~{\\rm GeV}$, at the grand unified scale. CMB-S4 could\nimprove the CMB lower bound on the ULA mass from $\\sim 10^{-25}~{\\rm eV}$ to\n$10^{-23}~{\\rm eV}$, nearing the mass range probed by dwarf galaxy abundances\nand dark-matter halo density profiles. These improvements will allow for a\nmulti-$\\sigma$ detection of percent-level departures from CDM over a wide range\nof masses. Much of this improvement is driven by the effects of weak\ngravitational lensing on the CMB, which breaks degeneracies between ULAs and\nneutrinos. We also find that the addition of ULA parameters does not\nsignificantly degrade the sensitivity of the CMB to neutrino masses. These\nresults were obtained using the axionCAMB code (a modification to the CAMB\nBoltzmann code), presented here for public use.\n", "  Slave-spin mean-field theory, a light and accurate technique to model\nelectronic correlations in Fermi-liquid phases of multi-orbital materials, is\npedagogically exposed in this chapter, with a focus on its recent successful\napplication to the physics of Iron-based superconductors. Beside introducing\nelectronic correlations and recalling the Fermi-liquid phenomenology, the\nmanuscript accompanies the step-by-step explanation of the slave-spin technique\nwith a set of useful complements providing analytical insight into Mott and\nHund's physics, which are at the heart of the physics of strongly correlated\nmaterials. Some original research material is also exposed, such as the\nHund-induced shrinking of the Hubbard bands flanking the gap of the half-filled\nMott insulator, and the low-energy description of the \"orbital-decoupling\"\nmechanism.\n", "  In this Letter we present a comprehensive study of topological magnon bands\nand thermal Hall effect in non-collinear antiferromagnetic systems on the\nhoneycomb lattice with an intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We\ntheoretically show that the system possesses topological magnon bands with\nChern number protected edge modes accompanied by a nonzero thermal magnon Hall\neffect. These features result from non-collinearity of the magnetic moments due\nto an applied out-of-plane magnetic field. Our results provide an experimental\nclue towards the realization of topological magnon transports in honeycomb\nantiferromagnetic compounds such as XPS$_3$ (X=Mn,Fe) and\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$.\n", "  In view of the recent high-statistic KLOE data for the $\\eta \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-\n\\pi^0$ decay, a new determination of the quark mass double ratio has been done.\nOur approach relies on a dispersive model that takes into account rescattering\neffects between three pions via subenergy unitarity. The latter is essential to\nreproduce the Dalitz plot distribution. A simultaneous description of the KLOE\nand WASA-at-COSY data is achieved in terms of just two real parameters. From a\nglobal fit, we determine $Q=21.6 \\pm 1.1$. The predicted slope parameter for\nthe neutral channel $\\alpha=-0.025\\pm 0.004$ is in reasonable agreement with\nthe PDG average value.\n", "  In 1877 James Clerk Maxwell and his student Donald MacAlister refined Henry\nCavendish's 1773 null experiment demonstrating the absence of electricity\ninside a charged conductor. This null result was a mathematical prediction of\nthe inverse square law of electrostatics, and both Cavendish and Maxwell took\nthe experiment as verifying the law. However, Maxwell had already expressed\nabsolute conviction in the law, based on results of Michael Faraday's. So, what\nwas the value to him of repeating Cavendish's experiment? After assessing\nwhether the law was as secure as he claimed, this paper explores its central\nimportance to the electrical programme that Maxwell was pursuing. It traces the\nhistorical and conceptual re-orderings through which Maxwell established the\nlaw by constructing a tradition of null tests and asserting the superior\naccuracy of the method. Maxwell drew on his developing 'doctrine of method' to\nidentify Cavendish's experiment as a member of a wider class of null methods.\nBy doing so, he appealed to the null practices of telegraph engineers, diverted\nattention from the flawed logic of the method, and sought to localise issues\naround the mapping of numbers onto instrumental indications, on the grounds\nthat 'no actual measurement ... was required'.\n", "  We study the remanent magnetization in antiferromagnetic, many-body localized\nquantum spin chains, initialized in a fully magnetized state. Its long time\nlimit is an order parameter for the localization transition, which is readily\naccessible by standard experimental probes in magnets. We analytically\ncalculate its value in the strong-disorder regime exploiting the explicit\nconstruction of quasi-local conserved quantities of the localized phase. We\ndiscuss analogies in cold atomic systems.\n", "  We present a counting of microstates of a class of dyonic BPS black holes in\nAdS$_4$ which precisely reproduces their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The\ncounting is performed in the dual boundary description, that provides a\nnon-perturbative definition of quantum gravity, in terms of a twisted and\nmass-deformed ABJM theory. We evaluate its twisted index and propose an\nextremization principle to extract the entropy, which reproduces the attractor\nmechanism in gauged supergravity.\n", "  We use effective field theory and thermal field theory to study the dynamical\nscreening effect in the QED plasma on the $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ scattering at the\n$^8$Be resonance. Dynamical screening leads to an imaginary part of the\npotential which results in a thermal width for the resonance and dominates over\nthe previously considered static screening effect. As a result, both the\nresonance energy and width increase with the plasma temperature. Furthermore,\ndynamical screening can have a huge impact on the $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ thermal\nnuclear scattering rate. For example, when the temperature is around $10$ keV,\nthe rate is suppressed by a factor of about $900$. We expect similar thermal\nsuppressions of nuclear reaction rates to occur in those reactions dominated by\nan above threshold resonance with a thermal energy. Dynamical screening effects\non nuclear reactions can be relevant to cosmology and astrophysics.\n", "  We use NuSTAR observations of the Galactic Center to search for X-ray lines\nfrom the radiative decay of sterile neutrino dark matter. Finding no evidence\nof unknown lines, we set limits on the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle.\nIn most of the mass range 10-50 keV, these are now the strongest limits, at\nsome masses improving upon previous limits by a factor of ~10. In the neutrino\nminimal standard model framework, where additional constraints from dark matter\nproduction and structure formation apply, the allowed parameter space is\nreduced by more than half. Future NuSTAR observations may be able to cover much\nof the remaining parameter space.\n", "  Theoretical treatment of the electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)\nspectra from polarons in a semiconducting $\\pi$- conjugated polymer is\npresented. The contact hyperfine coupling and the dipolar interaction between\nthe polaron and proton spins are found to have distinct contributions in the\nESEEM spectra. However, since the two contributions are spaced very closely,\nand the dipolar contribution is dominant, the detection of the contact\nhyperfine interaction is difficult. To resolve this problem, a recipe of\nprobing the contact hyperfine and dipolar interactions selectively is proposed,\nand a method for detecting the polaron contact hyperfine interaction is\nformulated. The ESEEM decay due to the polaron random hopping is analyzed, and\nthe robustness of the method against this decay is verified. Moreover, this\ndecay is linked to the transport properties of polarons, providing an auxiliary\nprobe for the polaron transport.\n", "  The exact renormalization group (ERG) for $O(N)$ vector models (at large $N$)\non flat Euclidean space can be interpreted as the bulk dynamics corresponding\nto a holographically dual higher spin gauge theory on $AdS_{d+1}$. This was\nestablished in the sense that at large $N$ the generating functional of\ncorrelation functions of single trace operators is reproduced by the on-shell\naction of the bulk higher spin theory, which is most simply presented in a\nfirst-order (phase space) formalism. In this paper, we extend the ERG formalism\nto the wave functionals of arbitrary states of the $O(N)$ vector model at the\nfree fixed point. We find that the ERG flow of the ground state and a specific\nclass of excited states is implemented by the action of unitary operators which\ncan be chosen to be local. Consequently, the ERG equations provide a continuum\nnotion of a tensor network. We compare this tensor network with the\nentanglement renormalization networks, MERA, and its continuum version, cMERA,\nwhich have appeared recently in holographic contexts. In particular the ERG\ntensor network appears to share the general structure of cMERA but differs in\nimportant ways. We comment on possible holographic implications.\n", "  We propose a new method of selection of high purity charge current\nquasielastic neutrino events with a good reconstruction of interacting neutrino\nenergy. Performance of the method was verified with several tests using GENIE,\nNEUT and NuWro Monte Carlo events generators with carbon and argon targets. The\nmethod can be useful in neutrino oscillation studies with a few GeV energy\nbeams.\n", "  It is well known that the quasinormal modes (or resonant states) of photonic\nstructures can be associated with the poles of the scattering matrix of the\nsystem in the complex-frequency plane. In this work, the inverse problem, i.e.,\nthe reconstruction of the scattering matrix from the knowledge of the\nquasinormal modes, is addressed. We develop a general and scalable\nquasinormal-mode expansion of the scattering matrix, requiring only the complex\neigenfrequencies and the far-field properties of the eigenmodes. The theory is\nvalidated by applying it to illustrative nanophotonic systems with multiple\noverlapping electromagnetic modes. The examples demonstrate that our theory\nprovides an accurate first-principle prediction of the scattering properties,\nwithout the need for postulating ad-hoc nonresonant channels.\n", "  Localized cavity resonances due to nanostructures at material surfaces can\ngreatly enhance radiative heat transfer (RHT) between two closely placed bodies\nowing to stretching of cavity states in momentum space beyond light line. Based\non such understanding, we numerically demonstrate the possibility of\nultra-broadband super-Planckian RHT between two plates patterned with\ntrapezoidal-shaped hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) arrays. The phenomenon is\nrooted not only in HMM's high effective index for creating sub-wavelength\nresonators, but also its extremely anisotropic isofrequency contour. The two\nproperties enable one to create photonic bands with a high spectral density to\npopulate a desired thermal radiation window. At sub-micron gap sizes between\nsuch two plates, the artificial continuum states extend outside light cone,\ntremendously increasing overall RHT. Our study reveals that structured HMM\noffers unprecedented potential in achieving a controllable super-Planckian\nradiative heat transfer for thermal management at nanoscale.\n", "  We explore AdS/CFT correspondence between geodesic Witten diagrams and\nconformal blocks (conformal partial waves) with an external symmetric traceless\ntensor field. We derive an expression for the conformal partial wave with an\nexternal spin-1 field and show that this expression is equivalent to the\namplitude of the geodesic Witten diagram. We also show the equivalence by using\nconformal Casimir equation in embedding formalism. Furthermore, we extend the\nconstruction of the amplitude of the geodesic Witten diagram to an external\narbitrary symmetric traceless tensor field. We show our construction agrees\nwith the known result of the conformal partial waves.\n", "  We define a new class of \"diagonal\" t-J ladders rotated by $\\pi$/4 relative\nto the canonical lattice directions of the square lattice, and study it using\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Here, we focus on the two-leg\ncylinder with a doped hole concentration near x = 1/4. At exactly x = 1/4, the\nsystem forms a period 4 charge density wave (CDW) and exhibits spin-charge\nseparation. Slightly away from 1/4 doping we observe several topologically\ndistinct types of solitons with well defined fractionalized quantum numbers.\nRemarkably, given the absence of any obvious small parameter, the effective\nmasses of the emergent solitons differ by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  A system of fermions forming a Fermi surface exhibits a large degree of\nquantum entanglement, even in the absence of interactions. In particular, the\nusual case of a codimension one Fermi surface leads to a logarithmic violation\nof the area law for entanglement entropy, as dictated by the Widom formula. We\nhere generalize this formula to the case of arbitrary codimension, which is of\nparticular interest for nodal lines in three dimensions. We first rederive the\nstandard Widom formula by calculating an entanglement Hamiltonian for Fermi\nsurface systems, obtained by repurposing a trick commonly applied to\nrelativistic theories. The entanglement Hamiltonian will take a local form in\nterms of a low-energy patch theory for the Fermi surface, though it is nonlocal\nwith respect to the microscopic fermions. This entanglement Hamiltonian can\nthen be used to derive the entanglement entropy, yielding a result in agreement\nwith the Widom formula. The method is then generalized to arbitrary\ncodimension. For nodal lines, the area law is obeyed, and the magnitude of the\ncoefficient for a particular partition is non-universal. However, the\ncoefficient has a universal dependence on the shape and orientation of the\nnodal line relative to the partitioning surface. By comparing the relative\nmagnitude of the area law for different partitioning cuts, entanglement entropy\ncan be used as a tool for diagnosing the presence and shape of a nodal line in\na ground state wavefunction.\n", "  We build a supersymmetric version with $SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(2)_L\\otimes\nU(1)_{Y^\\prime}\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, where $Y^\\prime$ is a new\ncharge and $B$ and $L$ are the usual baryonic and leptonic numbers. The model\nhas three right-handed neutrinos with identical $B-L$ charges, and can\naccommodate all fermion masses at the tree level. In particular, the type-I\nseesaw mechanism is implemented for the generation of the active neutrino\nmasses. We obtain the mass spectra of all sectors and for the scalar one we\nalso give the flat directions allowed by the model.\n", "  In this work we study the decay constants of $B$ and $B_s$ mesons based on\nthe wave function obtained in the relativistic potential model. Our results are\nin good agreement with experimental data which enables us to apply this method\nto the investigation of $B$-meson distribution amplitudes. A very compact form\nof the distribution amplitude is obtained. We also investigate the one-loop QCD\ncorrections to the pure leptonic decays of $B$ mesons. We find that, after\nsubtracting the infrared divergence in the one-loop corrections using the\nfactorization method, the QCD one-loop corrections to the hard amplitude of\nleptonic decay will be zero.\n", "  We formulate a general theory to study the time-dependent charge and energy\ntransport of an adiabatically driven interacting quantum dot in contact to a\nreservoir for arbitrary amplitudes of the driving potential. We study within\nthis framework the Anderson impurity model with a local ac gate voltage. We\nshow that the exact adiabatic quantum dynamics of this system is fully\ndetermined by the behavior of the charge susceptibility of the frozen problem.\nAt $T=0$, we evaluate the dynamic response functions with the numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG). The time-resolved heat production exhibits a\npronounced feature described by an instantaneous Joule law characterized by an\nuniversal resistance quantum $R_0=h/(2 e^2)$ for each spin channel. We show\nthat this law holds in non-interacting as well as in the interacting system and\nalso when the system is spin-polarized. In addition, in the presence of a\nstatic magnetic field, the interplay between many-body interactions and spin\npolarization leads to a non-trivial energy exchange between electrons with\ndifferent spin components.\n", "  We present a detailed NMR study of the insulator to metal transition induced\nby an applied pressure $p$ in the A15 phase of Cs$_{3}$C$_{60}$. We evidence\nthat the insulating antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) phases only\ncoexist in a narrow $p$ range. At fixed $p$, in the metallic state above the SC\ntransition $T_c$, the $^{133}$Cs and $^{13}$C NMR spin lattice relaxation data\nare seemingly governed by a pseudogap like feature. We prove that this feature,\nalso seen in the $^{133}$Cs NMR shift data is rather a signature of the Mott\ntransition, which broadens and smears out progressively for increasing $(p,T)$.\nThe analysis of the variation of the quadrupole splitting $\\nu _{Q}$ of the\n$^{133}$Cs NMR spectrum precludes any cell symmetry change at the Mott\ntransition and only monitors a weak variation of lattice parameter. These\nresults open an opportunity to consider theoretically the Mott transition in a\nmultiorbital three dimensional system well beyond its critical point.\n", "  We propose a two-qubit quantum logic gate between a superconducting atom and\na propagating microwave photon. The atomic qubit is encoded on its lowest two\nlevels and the photonic qubit is encoded on its carrier frequencies. The gate\noperation completes deterministically upon reflection of a photon, and various\ntwo-qubit gates (SWAP, $\\sqrt{\\rm SWAP}$, and Identity) are realized through\n{\\it in situ} control of the drive field. The proposed gate is applicable to\nconstruction of a network of superconducting atoms, which enables gate\noperations between non-neighboring atoms.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum control is a powerful tool for quantum engineering and a\nkey component in some quantum computation models, where accurate control over\nthe timing of the involved pulses is not needed. However, the adiabatic\ncondition requires that the process should be very slow and thus limits its\napplication in quantum computation, where quantum gates are preferred to be\nfast due to the limited coherent times of the quantum systems. Here, we propose\na feasible scheme to implement universal holonomic quantum computation based on\nnon-Abelian geometric phases with superadiabatic quantum control, where the\nadiabatic manipulation is sped up while retaining its robustness against errors\nin the timing control. Consolidating the advantages of both strategies, our\nproposal is thus both robust and fast. The quantum cavity QED system is adopted\nas a typical example to illustrate the merits, where the proposed scheme can be\nrealized in a tripod configuration by appropriately controlling the pulse\nshapes and their relative strength. To demonstrate the distinct performance of\nour proposal, we also compare our scheme with the conventional adiabatic\nstrategy.\n", "  One of the main goals of any resource theory such as entanglement, quantum\nthermodynamics, quantum coherence, and asymmetry, is to find necessary and\nsufficient conditions (NSC) that determine whether one resource can be\nconverted to another by the set of free operations. Here we find such NSC for a\nlarge class of quantum resource theories which we call affine resource theories\n(ART). ARTs include the resource theories of athermality, asymmetry, and\ncoherence, but not entanglement. Remarkably, the NSC can be expressed as a\nfamily of inequalities between resource monotones (quantifiers) that are given\nin terms of the conditional min entropy. The set of free operations is taken to\nbe (1) the maximal set (i.e. consists of all resource non-generating (RNG)\nquantum channels) or (2) the self-dual set of free operations (i.e. consists of\nall RNG maps for which the dual map is also RNG). As an example, we apply our\nresults to quantum thermodynamics with Gibbs preserving operations, and several\nother ARTs. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to resource\ntheories that are not affine, and along the way, provide the NSC that a quantum\nresource theory consists of a resource destroying map.\n", "  We study inflationary models with a Gauss-Bonnet term to reconstruct the\nscalar field potentials and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling functions from the\nobservable quantities. Using the observationally favored relations for both\n$n_s$ and $r$, we derive the expressions for both the scalar field potentials\nand the coupling functions. The implication of the blue-tilted spectrum,\n$n_t>0$, of the primordial tensor fluctuations is discussed for the\nreconstructed configurations of the scalar field potential and the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling.\n", "  We report the production of highly spin-polarized Deuterium atoms via\nphotodissociation of deuterium iodide at 270 nm. The velocity distribution of\nboth the deuterium and iodine photodissociation products is performed via\nvelocity mapping slice-imaging. Additionally, the angular momentum polarization\nof the iodine products is studied using polarization-sensitive ionization\nschemes. The results are consistent with excitation of the $A^1\\Pi_1$ state\nfollowed by adiabatic dissociation. The process produces $\\sim$100\\%\nelectronically polarized deuterium atoms at the time of dissociation, which is\nthen converted to $\\sim 60\\%$ nuclear D polarization after $\\sim 1.6$ ns. These\nproduction times for hyperpolarized deuterium allow collision-limited densities\nof $\\sim 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is $\\sim 10^6$ times higher than\nconventional (Stern-Gerlach separation) methods. We discuss how such\nhigh-density hyperpolarized deuterium atoms can be combined with laser fusion\nto measure polarized D-D fusion cross sections.\n", "  The spatial and velocity distributions of nuclear species synthesized in the\ninnermost regions of core-collapse supernovae can yield important clues about\nexplosion asymmetries and the operation of the still disputed explosion\nmechanism. Recent observations of radioactive $^{44}$Ti with high-energy\nsatellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL)\nhave measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of\nlarge-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even\nby mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR). Here we discuss a\n3D simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion, using a parameterized neutrino\nengine, whose $^{44}$Ti distribution is mostly concentrated in one hemisphere\npointing opposite to the neutron star (NS) kick velocity. Both exhibit\nintriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant,\nalthough neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect\nmatch. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetries observed in this remnant\ncan, in principle, be accounted for by a neutrino-driven explosion, and that\nthe high $^{44}$Ti abundance in Cas A may be explained without invoking rapid\nrotation or a jet-driven explosion, because neutrino-driven explosions\ngenerically eject large amounts of high-entropy matter. The recoil acceleration\nof the NS is connected to mass ejection asymmetries and is opposite to the\ndirection of the stronger explosion, fully compatible with the gravitational\ntugboat mechanism. Our results also imply that Cas A and SN 1987A could possess\nsimilarly \"one-sided\" Ti and Fe asymmetries, with the difference that Cas A is\nviewed from a direction with large inclination angle to the NS motion, whereas\nthe NS in SN 1987A should have a dominant velocity component pointing toward\nus.\n", "  Motivated by recently reported anomalies in a decay of an excited state of\nberyllium by the Atomki collaboration, we study a radiative seesaw model with\ngauged $B-L$ symmetry and a $Z_2$ parity. Assuming that the anomalies originate\nfrom the decay of the $B-L$ gauge boson followed by the nuclear decay, the mass\nof the lightest right-handed neutrino or the dark matter candidate can be\ndetermined below $10$ GeV. We show that for this mass range, the model can\nexplain the anomalies in the beryllium decay and the relic dark matter\nabundance consistent with neutrino masses. We also predict its spin-independent\ncross section in direct detection experiments for this mass range.\n", "  The two-photon dressing of a \"three-level ladder\" system, here the ground\nstate, the exciton and the biexciton of a semiconductor quantum dot, leads to\nnew eigenstates and allows one to manipulate the time ordering of the paired\nphotons without unitary post processing. We show that, after spectral\npost-selection of the single dressed states, the time ordering of the cascaded\nphotons can be removed or conserved. Our joint experimental and theoretical\nstudy demonstrates the high potential of a \"ladder\" system to be a versatile\nsource of orthogonally polarized, bunched or antibunched pairs of photons.\n", "  Galactic outflows are ubiquitously observed in star-forming disk galaxies and\nare critical for galaxy formation. Supernovae (SNe) play the key role in\ndriving the outflows, but there is no consensus as to how much energy, mass and\nmetal they can launch out of the disk. We perform 3D, high-resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations to study SNe-driven outflows from stratified media.\nAssuming SN rate scales with gas surface density $\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}$ as in the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, we find the mass loading factor, $\\eta_m$,\ndefined as the mass outflow flux divided by the star formation surface density,\ndecreases with increasing $\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}$ as $\\eta_m \\propto\n\\Sigma^{-0.61}_{\\rm{gas}}$. Approximately $\\Sigma_{\\rm{gas}}$ $\\lesssim$ 50\n$M_\\odot/\\rm{pc}^2$ marks when $\\eta_m \\gtrsim$1. About 10-50\\% of the energy\nand 40-80\\% of the metals produced by SNe end up in the outflows. The tenuous\nhot phase ($T>3\\times 10^5$ K), which fills 60-80\\% of the volume at mid-plane,\ncarries the majority of the energy and metals in outflows. We discuss how\nvarious physical processes, including vertical distribution of SNe,\nphotoelectric heating, external gravitational field and SN rate, affect the\nloading efficiencies. The relative scale height of gas and SNe is a very\nimportant factor in determining the loading efficiencies.\n", "  Ice-covered ocean worlds possess diverse energy sources and associated\nmechanisms that are capable of driving significant seismic activity, but to\ndate no measurements of their seismic activity have been obtained. Such\ninvestigations could probe their transport properties and radial structures,\nwith possibilities for locating and characterizing trapped liquids that may\nhost life and yielding critical constraints on redox fluxes, and thus on\nhabitability. Modeling efforts have examined seismic sources from tectonic\nfracturing and impacts. Here, we describe other possible seismic sources, their\nassociations with science questions constraining habitability, and the\nfeasibility of implementing such investigations. We argue, by analogy with the\nMoon, that detectable seismic activity on tidally flexed ocean worlds should\noccur frequently. Their ices fracture more easily than rocks, and dissipate\nmore tidal energy than the <1 GW of the Moon and Mars. Icy ocean worlds also\nshould create less thermal noise for a due to their greater distance and\nconsequently smaller diurnal temperature variations. They also lack substantial\natmospheres (except in the case of Titan) that would create additional noise.\nThus, seismic experiments could be less complex and less susceptible to noise\nthan prior or planned planetary seismology investigations of the Moon or Mars.\n", "  There is no guarantee that the violation of lepton number, assuming it\nexists, will primarily manifest itself in neutrinoless double beta decay\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$). Lepton-number violation and lepton-flavor violation may be\nrelated, and much-needed information regarding the physics that violates lepton\nnumber can be learned by exploring observables that violate lepton flavors\nother than electron flavor. One of the most promising observables is $\\mu^-\n\\rightarrow e^+$ conversion, which can be explored by experiments that are\nspecifically designed to search for $\\mu^- \\rightarrow e^-$ conversion. We\nsurvey lepton-number-violating dimension-five, -seven, and -nine effective\noperators in the standard model and discuss the relationships between Majorana\nneutrino masses and the rates for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and $\\mu^- \\rightarrow e^+$\nconversion. While $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ has the greatest sensitivity to new\nultraviolet energy scales, its rate might be suppressed by the new physics\nrelationship to lepton flavor, and $\\mu^- \\rightarrow e^+$ conversion offers a\ncomplementary probe of lepton-number-violating physics.\n", "  Accurate quantum gates are basic elements for building quantum computers.\nThere has been great interest in designing quantum logic gates by using\nblockade effect of Rydberg atoms recently. The fidelity and operation speed of\nthese gates, however, are fundamentally limited by an intrinsic blockade error.\nHere we propose a type of quantum gates, which are based on Rydberg blockade\neffect, yet free from any blockade error. In contrast to the \"blocking\" method\nin previous schemes, we use Rydberg energy shift to realize a rational\ngeneralized Rabi frequency so that a $\\pi$ phase for one input state of the\ngate emerges. This leads to an accurate Rydberg quantum logic gate that can\noperate on a 0.1-$\\mu s$ timescale or faster because it works by a Rabi\nfrequency which is comparable to the blockade shift.\n", "  Echoes of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at finite temperatures are\ntheoretically and experimentally challenging and unexplored topics.\nParticularly in metallic quantum ferromagnets the experimental investigations\nare hampered by an intricate preparation of sufficiently pure samples and the\naccess to the proper coordinates in parameter space. The present study shows\nthat it is possible to tune a specific system at easily accessible conditions\nto the vicinity of its quantum phase transition. The physics is demonstrated on\nRu-doped UCoAl, driven by pressure or substitution to and across the\ntricritical point and follows the first-order transition line to the\ntheoretically presumed QPT. These findings open the possibilities for further\nin-depth studies of classical and quantum critical phenomena at easily\nreachable conditions.\n", "  The probability distribution of the longest interval between two zeros of a\nsimple random walk starting and ending at the origin, and of its continuum\nlimit, the Brownian bridge, was analysed in the past by Ros\\'en and Wendel,\nthen extended by the latter to stable processes. We recover and extend these\nresults using simple concepts of renewal theory, which allows to revisit past\nor recent works of the physics literature.\n", "  Various theories beyond the Standard Model predict new particles with masses\nin the sub-eV range with very weak couplings to ordinary matter which can\npossess spin-dependent couplings to electrons and nucleons. Present laboratory\nconstraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions with pseudoscalar and axial\ncouplings for exchange boson masses between meV and eV are very poor compared\nto constraints on spin-independent interactions in the same mass range arising\nfrom spin-0 and spin-1 boson exchange. It is therefore interesting to analyze\nin a general way how one can use the strong experimental bounds on\nspin-independent interactions to also constrain spin-dependent interactions by\nconsidering higher-order exchange processes. The exchange of a pair of bosons\nbetween two fermions with spin-dependent couplings will possess contributions\nwhich flip spins twice and thereby generate a polarization-independent\ninteraction energy which can add coherently between two unpolarized objects. In\nthis paper we derive the dominant long-range contributions to the interaction\nenergy between two nonrelativistic spin-1/2 Dirac fermions from double exchange\nof spin-0 and spin-1 bosons proportional to couplings of the form $g_P^{4}$,\n$g_S^{2}g_P^{2}$, and $g_V^{2}g_A^{2}$. Our results for $g_P^{4}$ are in\nagreement with previous calculations that have appeared in the literature. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of this analysis to constrain spin-dependent\ncouplings by presenting the results of a reanalysis of data from a short-range\ngravity experiment to derive an improved constraint on $(g^N_{P})^2$, the\npseudoscalar coupling for nucleons, in the range between $40$ and $200~\\mu$m of\nabout a factor of 5 compared to previous limits. The spin-independent\ncontribution from 2-boson exchange with axial-vector couplings requires special\ntreatment and will be explored in another paper.\n", "  We investigate the impact of noise on a two-dimensional simple paradigmatic\npiecewise-smooth dynamical system. For that purpose we consider the motion of a\nparticle subjected to dry friction and coloured noise. The finite correlation\ntime of the noise provides an additional dimension in phase space, a nontrivial\nprobability current, and thus establishes a proper nonequilibrium regime.\nFurthermore, the finite noise correlation time allows for the study of\nstick-slip phenomena which show up as a singular component in the stationary\nprobability density. Analytic insight can be provided by application of the\nunified coloured noise approximation, developed by Jung and H\\\"anggi (Phys.\nRev. A 35, 4464 (R) (1987)). The analysis of probability currents and a closer\nlook at power spectral densities underpin the observed stick-slip transitions\nwhich are related with a critical value of the noise correlation time.\n", "  Trapped Rydberg ions are a promising new system for quantum information\nprocessing. They have the potential to join the precise quantum operations of\ntrapped ions and the strong, long-range interactions between Rydberg atoms.\nTechnically, the ion trap will need to stay active while exciting the ions into\nthe Rydberg state, else the strong Coulomb repulsion will quickly push the ions\napart. Thus, a thorough understanding of the trap effects on Rydberg ions is\nessential for future applications. Here we report the observation of two\nfundamental trap effects. First, we investigate the interaction of the Rydberg\nelectron with the quadrupolar electric trapping field. This effect leads to\nFloquet sidebands in the spectroscopy of Rydberg D-states whereas Rydberg\nS-states are unaffected due to their symmetry. Second, we report on the\nmodified trapping potential in the Rydberg state compared to the ground state\nwhich results from the strong polarizability of the Rydberg ion. We observe the\nresultant energy shifts as a line broadening which can be suppressed by cooling\nthe ion to the motional ground state in the directions orthogonal to the\nexcitation laser.\n", "  We present a novel scheme to accurately predict atomic forces as vector\nquantities, rather than sets of scalar components, by Gaussian Process (GP)\nRegression. This is based on matrix-valued kernel functions, on which we impose\nthe requirements that the predicted force rotates with the target configuration\nand is independent of any rotations applied to the configuration database\nentries. We show that such covariant GP kernels can be obtained by integration\nover the elements of the rotation group SO(d) for the relevant dimensionality\nd. Remarkably, in specific cases the integration can be carried out\nanalytically and yields a conservative force field that can be recast into a\npair interaction form. Finally, we show that restricting the integration to a\nsummation over the elements of a finite point group relevant to the target\nsystem is sufficient to recover an accurate GP. The accuracy of our kernels in\npredicting quantum-mechanical forces in real materials is investigated by tests\non pure and defective Ni, Fe and Si crystalline systems.\n", "  In projective measurements of energy, a target system is projected to an\neigenstate of the system Hamiltonian, and the measurement outcomes provide the\ninformation of corresponding eigen-energies. Recently, it has been shown that\nsuch a measurement can be in principle realized without detailed knowledge of\nthe Hamiltonian by using probe qubits. However, in the previous approach for\nthe energy measurement, the necessary size of the dimension for the probe\nincreases as we increase the dimension of the target system, and also\nindividual addresibility of every qubit is required, which may not be possible\nfor many experimental settings with large systems. Here, we show that a single\nprobe qubit is sufficient to perform such a projective measurement of energy if\nthe target system is composed of non-interacting qubits whose resonant\nfrequencies are unknown. Moreover, our scheme requires only global\nmanipulations where every qubit is subjected to the same control fields. These\nresults indicate the feasibility of our energy projection protocols.\n", "  The intermittent burst dynamics during the slow drainage of a porous medium\nis studied experimentally. We have shown that this system satisfies a set of\nconditions known to be true for critical systems, such as intermittent activity\nwith bursts extending over several time and length scales, self-similar\nmacroscopic fractal structure and $1/f^\\alpha$ power spectrum. Additionally, we\nhave verified a theoretically predicted scaling for the burst size\ndistribution, previously assessed via numerical simulations. The observation of\n$1/f^\\alpha$ power spectra is new for porous media flows and, for specific\nboundary conditions, we notice the occurrence of a transition from $1/f$ to\n$1/f^2$ scaling. An analytically integrable mathematical framework was employed\nto explain this behavior.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum dots are promising sources for polarization-entangled\nphotons. As an alternative to the usual cascaded biexciton-exciton emission,\ndirect two-photon emission from the biexciton can be used. With a high-quality\noptical resonator tuned to half the biexciton energy, a large proportion of the\nphotons can be steered into the two-photon emission channel. In this case the\ndegree of polarization entanglement is inherently insensitive to the exciton\nfine-structure splitting. In the present work we analyze the biexciton emission\nwith particular emphasis on the influence of coupling of the quantum-dot cavity\nsystem to its environment. Especially for a high-quality cavity, the coupling\nto the surrounding semiconductor material can open up additional\nphonon-assisted decay channels. Our analysis demonstrates that with the cavity\ntuned to half the biexciton energy, the potentially detrimental influence of\nthe phonons on the polarization entanglement is strongly suppressed -- high\ndegrees of entanglement can still be achieved. We further discuss spectral\nproperties and statistics of the emitted twin photons.\n", "  In this work, we introduce the Kaiser-Bessel interpolation basis for the\nparticle-mesh interpolation in the fast Ewald method. A reliable a priori error\nestimate is developed to measure the accuracy of the force computation in\ncorrelated charge systems, and is shown to be effective in optimizing the shape\nparameter of the Kaiser-Bessel basis in terms of accuracy. By comparing the\noptimized Kaiser-Bessel basis with the traditional B-spline basis, we\ndemonstrate that the former is more accurate than the latter in part of the\nworking parameter space, saying a relatively small real space cutoff, a\nrelatively small reciprocal space mesh and a relatively large truncation of\nbasis. In some cases, the Kaiser-Bessel basis is found to be more than one\norder of magnitude more accurate.\n", "  Dust attenuation in galaxies has been extensively studied nearby, however,\nthere are still many unknowns regarding attenuation in distant galaxies. We\ncontribute to this effort using observations of star-forming galaxies in the\nredshift range z = 0.05-0.15 from the DYNAMO survey. Highly star-forming DYNAMO\ngalaxies share many similar attributes to clumpy, star-forming galaxies at high\nredshift. Considering integrated Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations, trends\nbetween attenuation and other galaxy properties for DYNAMO galaxies are well\nmatched to star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Integrated gas attenuations\nof DYNAMO galaxies are 0.2-2.0 mags in the V-band, and the ratio of stellar\nE(B-V) and gas E(B-V) is 0.78-0.08 (compared to 0.44 at low redshift). Four\nhighly star-forming DYNAMO galaxies were observed at H-alpha using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope and at Pa-alpha using integral field spectroscopy at Keck. The\nlatter achieve similar resolution (~0.8-1 kpc) to our HST imaging using\nadaptive optics, providing resolved observations of gas attenuations of these\ngalaxies on sub-kpc scales. We find < 1.0 mag of variation in attenuation (at\nH-alpha) from clump to clump, with no evidence of highly attenuated star\nformation. Attenuations are in the range 0.3-2.2 mags in the V band, consistent\nwith attenuations of low redshift star-forming galaxies. The small spatial\nvariation on attenuation suggests that a majority of the star-formation\nactivity in these four galaxies occurs in relatively unobscured regions and,\nthus, star-formation is well characterised by our H-alpha observations.\n", "  We present a novel chiral sensing platform that combines a one-dimensional\nphotonic crystal design with a birefringent surface defect. The platform\nsustains simultaneous transverse electric and transverse magnetic surface\nmodes, which are exploited to generate chiral surface waves. The present design\nprovides homogeneous and superchiral fields of both handednesses over\narbitrarily large areas in a wide spectral range, resulting in the enhancement\nof the circular dichroism signal by two orders of magnitude, thus paving the\nroad toward the successful combination of surface-enhanced spectroscopies and\nelectromagnetic superchirality.\n", "  We use new Band-3 CO(1-0) observations taken with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the physical conditions in the\ninterstellar gas of a sample of 27 dusty main-sequence star-forming galaxies at\n0.03<$z$<0.2 present in the Valpara\\'iso ALMA Line Emission Survey (VALES). The\nsample is drawn from far-IR bright galaxies over $\\sim$160 deg$^{2}$ in the\nHerschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (HATLAS), which is covered\nby Herschel [CII] 158 $\\mu$m spectroscopy and far-infrared (FIR) photometry.\nThe [CII] and CO lines are both detected at >5$\\sigma$ in 26 sources. We find\nan average [CII] to CO(1-0) luminosity ratio of 3500$\\pm$1200 for our sample\nthat is consistent with previous studies. Using the [CII], CO and FIR\nmeasurements as diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar\nmedium, we compare these observations to the predictions of a photodissociation\nregion (PDR) model to determine the gas density, surface temperature, pressure,\nand the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field,\n$G_{0}$, normalised to the Habing Field. The majority of our sample exhibit\nhydrogen densities of 4 < $\\log n/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ < 5.5 and experience an\nincident FUV radiation field with strengths of 2 < $\\log G_0$ < 3 when adopting\nstandard adjustments. A comparison to galaxy samples at different redshifts\nindicates that the average strength of the FUV radiation field appears constant\nup to redshift $z\\sim$6.4, yet the neutral gas density increases with redshift\nby a factor of $\\sim$100, that persists regardless of various adjustments to\nour observable quantities. This evolution could provide an explanation for the\nobserved evolution of the star formation rate density with cosmic time, yet\ncould arise from a combination of observational biases when using different\nsuites of emission lines as diagnostic tracers of PDR gas.\n", "  We show that simple Two Higgs Doublet models still provide a viable\nexplanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe via electroweak\nbaryogenesis, even after taking into account the recent order-of-magnitude\nimprovement on the electron-EDM experimental bound by the ACME Collaboration.\nMoreover we show that, in the region of parameter space where baryogenesis is\npossible, the gravitational wave spectrum generated at the end of the\nelectroweak phase transition is within the sensitivity reach of the future\nspace-based interferometer LISA.\n", "  The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4-3658, shows a\npeculiar orbital evolution that proceeds at a much faster pace than predicted\nby conservative binary evolution models. It is important to identify the\nunderlying mechanism responsible for this behavior because it can help to\nunderstand how this system evolves. It has also been suggested that, when in\nquiescence, SAX J1808.4-3658 turns on as a radio pulsar, a circumstance that\nmight provide a link between AMXPs and black-widow radio pulsars. In this work\nwe report the results of a deep radio pulsation search at 2 GHz using the Green\nBank Telescope in August 2014 and an X-ray monitoring of the 2015 outburst with\nChandra, Swift, and INTEGRAL. In particular, we present the X-ray timing\nanalysis of a 30-ks Chandra observation executed during the 2015 outburst. We\ndetect no radio pulsations, and place the strongest limit to date on the pulsed\nradio flux density of any AMXP. We also find that the orbit of SAX J1808.4-3658\ncontinues evolving at a fast pace and we compare it to the bhevior of other\naccreting and non-accreting binaries. We discuss two scenarios: either the\nneutron star has a large moment of inertia (I>1.7x10^45 g cm^2) and is ablating\nthe donor (by using its spin-down power) thus generating mass-loss with an\nefficiency of 40% or the donor star is undergoing quasi-cyclic variations due\nto a varying mass-quadrupole induced by either a strong (1 kG) field or by some\nunidentified mechanism probably linked to irradiation.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the candidates to explain the\ngravitational wave (GW) signals observed by the LIGO detectors. Among several\nphenomena in the early Universe, cosmic inflation is a major example to\ngenerate PBHs from large primordial density perturbations. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the possibility to interpret the observed GW events as mergers of PBHs\nwhich are produced by cosmic inflation. The primordial curvature perturbation\nshould be large enough to produce a sizable amount of PBHs and thus we have\nseveral other probes to test this scenario. We point out that the current\npulsar timing array (PTA) experiments already put severe constraints on GWs\ngenerated via the second-order effects, and that the observation of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) puts severe restriction on its $\\mu$ distortion. In\nparticular, it is found that the scalar power spectrum should have a very sharp\npeak at $k \\sim 10^{6}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to fulfill the required abundance of PBHs\nwhile evading constraints from the PTA experiments together with the $\\mu$\ndistortion. We propose a mechanism which can realize such a sharp peak. In the\nfuture, simple inflation models that generate PBHs via almost Gaussian\nfluctuations could be probed/excluded.\n", "  The (111) surface of noble metals is usually treated as an isolated two\ndimensional (2D) triangular lattice completely decoupled from the bulk.\nHowever, unlike topological insulators, other bulk bands cross the Fermi level.\nWe here introduce an effective tight-binding model that accurately reproduces\nresults from first principles calculations, accounting for both surface and\nbulk states. We numerically solve the many-body problem of two quantum\nimpurities sitting on the surface by means of the density matrix\nrenormalization group. By performing simulations in a star geometry, we are\nable to study the non-perturbative problem in the thermodynamic limit with\nmachine precision accuracy. We find that there is a non-trivial competition\nbetween Kondo and RKKY physics and as a consequence, ferromagnetism is never\ndeveloped, except at short distances. The bulk introduces a variation in the\nperiod of the RKKY interactions, and therefore the problem departs considerably\nfrom the simpler 2D case. In addition, screening, and the magnitude of the\neffective indirect exchange is enhanced by the contributions from the bulk\nstates.\n", "  We propose that the flavor structure of the standard model is based on a\nhorizontal $SU(2)$ symmetry. It generically predicts (i) a parametrically small\nmass for the lightest charged fermions, (ii) small mixings in the quark sector,\nand (iii) suppression of flavor-changing neutral currents. Supplemented with\nthe assumption of a strong hierarchy between the second- and third- generation\nmasses, it also predicts (iv) a large $CP$-violating phase in the quark sector.\nOnly Majorana neutrinos allow for large mixings in the lepton sector. In this\ncase, this framework further predicts (v) near-maximal $\\theta_{23}^l$, (vi) a\nnormal hierarchy of neutrino masses, and (vii) large $CP$ violation in the\nlepton sector.\n", "  The $^{181}$Ta quadrupole resonance (NQR) technique has been utilized to\ninvestigate the microscopic magnetic properties of the Weyl semi-metal TaP. We\nfound three zero-field NQR signals associated with the transition between the\nquadrupole split levels for Ta with $I$=7/2 nuclear spin. A quadrupole coupling\nconstant, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{Q}}$ =19.250 MHz, and an asymmetric parameter of the\nelectric field gradient, $\\eta$ = 0.423 were extracted, in good agreement with\nband structure calculations. In order to examine the magnetic excitations, the\ntemperature dependence of the spin lattice relaxation rate\n(1/$T_{\\mathrm{1}}T$) has been measured for the $f_{\\mathrm{2}}$-line ($\\pm$5/2\n$\\leftrightarrow$ $\\pm$3/2 transition). We found that there exists two regimes\nwith quite different relaxation processes. Above $T\\text{*}$ $\\approx$ 30 K, a\npronounced (1/$T_{\\mathrm{1}}T$) $\\propto$ $T^{2}$ behavior was found, which is\nattributed to the magnetic excitations at the Weyl nodes with temperature\ndependent orbital hyperfine coupling. Below $T\\text{*}$, the relaxation is\nmainly governed by Korringa process with 1/$T_{\\mathrm{1}}T$ = constant,\naccompanied by an additional $T^{-1/2}$ type dependence to fit our experimental\ndata. We show that Ta-NQR is a novel probe for the bulk Weyl fermions and their\nexcitations.\n", "  Extensions of the photon and graviton soft theorems are derived in 4d local\neffective field theories with massless particles of arbitrary spin. We prove\nthat effective operators can result in new terms in the soft theorems at\nsubleading order for photons and subsubleading order for gravitons. The new\nsoft terms are unique and we provide a complete classification of all local\noperators responsible for such modifications. We show that no local operators\ncan modify the subleading soft graviton theorem. The soft limits are taken in a\nmanifestly on-locus manner using a complex double deformation of the external\nmomenta. In addition to the new soft theorems, the resulting master formula\nyields consistency conditions such as the conservation of electric charge, the\nEinstein equivalence principle, supergravity Ward identities, and the\nWeinberg-Witten theorem.\n", "  Symmetric electron-positron plasmas in inhomogeneous magnetic fields are\nintrinsically subject to interchange instability and transport. Scaling\nrelations for the propagation velocity of density blob perturbations relevant\nto transport in isothermal magnetically confined electron-positron plasmas are\ndeduced, including damping effects when Debye lengths are large compared to\nLarmor radii. The relations are verified by nonlinear full-F gyrofluid\ncomputations. Results are in favour of sufficient magnetic confinement for\nplanned electron-positron plasma experiments. The model is generalised to other\nmatter-antimatter plasmas. Magnetised electron-positron-proton-antiproton\nplasmas are susceptible to interchange driven local matter-antimatter\nseparation, which can be expected to impede (so far unrealised) sustained\nlaboratory magnetic confinement.\n", "  Shifting our electricity generation from fossil fuel to renewable energy\nsources introduces large fluctuations to the power system. Here, we demonstrate\nhow increased fluctuations, reduced damping and reduced intertia may undermine\nthe dynamical robustness of power grid networks. Focusing on fundamental noise\nmodels, we derive analytic insights into which factors limit the dynamic\nrobustness and how fluctuations may induce a system escape from an operating\nstate. Moreover, we identify weak links in the grid that make it particularly\nvulnerable to fluctuations. These results thereby not only contribute to a\ntheoretical understanding of how fluctuations act on distributed network\ndynamics, they may also help designing future renewable energy systems to be\nmore robust.\n", "  We develop the self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method, a general-purpose\nnumerical method recently introduced to simulate many-body systems, for\nstudying interacting fermion systems. Our method uses a highly-efficient update\nalgorithm, which we design and dub \"cumulative update\", to generate new\ncandidate configurations in the Markov chain based on a self-learned bosonic\neffective model. From general analysis and numerical study of the double\nexchange model as an example, we find the SLMC with cumulative update\ndrastically reduces the computational cost of the simulation, while remaining\nstatistically exact. Remarkably, its computational complexity is far less than\nthe conventional algorithm with local updates.\n", "  Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are sensitive to rare\ngamma-ray photons, buried in the background of charged cosmic-ray (CR)\nparticles, the flux of which is several orders of magnitude greater. The\nability to separate gamma rays from CR particles is important, as it is\ndirectly related to the sensitivity of the instrument. This\ngamma-ray/CR-particle classification problem in IACT data analysis can be\ntreated with the rapidly-advancing machine learning algorithms, which have the\npotential to outperform the traditional box-cut methods on image parameters. We\npresent preliminary results of a precise classification of a small set of muon\nevents using a convolutional neural networks model with the raw images as input\nfeatures. We also show the possibility of using the convolutional neural\nnetworks model for regression problems, such as the radius and brightness\nmeasurement of muon events, which can be used to calibrate the throughput\nefficiency of IACTs.\n", "  The tens of millions of radio sources to be detected with next-generation\nsurveys pose new challenges, quite apart from the obvious ones of processing\nspeed and data volumes. For example, existing algorithms are inadequate for\nsource extraction or cross-matching radio and optical/IR sources, and a new\ngeneration of algorithms are needed using machine learning and other\ntechniques. The large numbers of sources enable new ways of testing\nastrophysical models, using a variety of \"large-n astronomy\" techniques such as\nstatistical redshifts. Furthermore, while unexpected discoveries account for\nsome of the most significant discoveries in astronomy, it will be difficult to\ndiscover the unexpected in large volumes of data, unless specific software is\ndeveloped to mine the data for the unexpected.\n", "  Random non-commutative geometries are a novel approach to taking a\nnon-perturbative path integral over geometries. They were introduced in\narxiv.org/abs/1510.01377, where a first examination was performed. During this\nexamination we found that some geometries show indications of a phase\ntransition. In this article we explore this phase transition further for\ngeometries of type $(1,1)$, $(2,0)$, and $(1,3)$. We determine the pseudo\ncritical points of these geometries and explore how some of the observables\nscale with the system size. We also undertake first steps towards understanding\nthe critical behaviour through correlations and in determining critical\nexponents of the system.\n", "  Radio survey datasets comprise an increasing number of individual\nobservations stored as sets of multidimensional data. In large survey projects,\nastronomers commonly face limitations regarding: 1) interactive visual\nanalytics of sufficiently large subsets of data; 2) synchronous and\nasynchronous collaboration; and 3) documentation of the discovery workflow. To\nsupport collaborative data inquiry, we present encube, a large-scale\ncomparative visual analytics framework. Encube can utilise advanced\nvisualization environments such as the CAVE2 (a hybrid 2D and 3D virtual\nreality environment powered with a 100 Tflop/s GPU-based supercomputer and 84\nmillion pixels) for collaborative analysis of large subsets of data from radio\nsurveys. It can also run on standard desktops, providing a capable visual\nanalytics experience across the display ecology. Encube is composed of four\nprimary units enabling compute-intensive processing, advanced visualisation,\ndynamic interaction, parallel data query, along with data management. Its\nmodularity will make it simple to incorporate astronomical analysis packages\nand Virtual Observatory capabilities developed within our community. We discuss\nhow encube builds a bridge between high-end display systems (such as CAVE2) and\nthe classical desktop, preserving all traces of the work completed on either\nplatform -- allowing the research process to continue wherever you are.\n", "  We present quantum Monte Carlo calculations of few-neutron systems confined\nin external potentials based on local chiral interactions at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory. The energy and\nradial densities for these systems are calculated in different external\nWoods-Saxon potentials. We assume that their extrapolation to zero\nexternal-potential depth provides a quantitative estimate of three- and\nfour-neutron resonances. The validity of this assumption is demonstrated by\nbenchmarking with an exact diagonalization in the two-body case. We find that\nthe extrapolated trineutron resonance, as well as the energy for shallow well\ndepths, is lower than the tetraneutron resonance energy. This suggests that a\nthree-neutron resonance exists below a four-neutron resonance in nature and is\npotentially measurable. To confirm that the relative ordering of three- and\nfour-neutron resonances is not an artifact of the external confinement, we test\nthat the odd-even staggering in the helium isotopic chain is reproduced within\nthis approach. Finally, we discuss similarities between our results and\nultracold Fermi gases.\n", "  We complete the perturbative next-to-leading order corrections to the hard\nscattering amplitudes of deeply virtual meson leptoproduction processes at\nleading twist-two level by presenting the results for the production of flavor\nsinglet pseudoscalar mesons. The new results are given in the common momentum\nfraction representation and in terms of conformal moments. We also comment on\nthe flavor singlet results for deeply virtual vector meson production.\n", "  Silicon-on-chip (SOI) photonic circuit is the most promising platform for\nscalable quantum information technology for its low loss, small footprint,\nCMOS-compatible and telecom communications techniques compatible. Multiple\nmultiplexed entanglement sources include: energy-time, time-bin and\npolarization entangled sources based on 1-cm length single silicon nanowire,\nall these sources are compatible with (100GHz) dense-wave-division-multiplexing\n(DWDM) system. Different methods such as two photon interference pattern,\nBell-Inequality and quantum state tomography are used to characterize the\nquality of these entangled sources. Multiple entanglements are generated over\nmore than 5 channel pairs with high raw (net) visibilities around 97% (100%).\nThe emission spectral brightness of these entangled sources reaches 4.2*105\n/(s.nm.mW). The quality of the photon pair generated in continuous and pulse\npump regimes are compared. High qualities of these multiplexed entanglement\nsources make them very promising to be used in future minimized quantum\ncommunication and computation systems.\n", "  We develop analytic and numerical techniques for studying the statistics of\nslow-roll inflation in random Gaussian landscapes. As an illustration of these\ntechniques, we analyze small-field inflation in a one-dimensional landscape. We\ncalculate the probability distributions for the maximal number of e-folds and\nfor the spectral index of density fluctuations $n_s$ and its running\n$\\alpha_s$. These distributions have a universal form, insensitive to the\ncorrelation function of the Gaussian ensemble. We outline possible extensions\nof our methods to a large number of fields and to models of large-field\ninflation. These methods do not suffer from potential inconsistencies inherent\nin the Brownian motion technique, which has been used in most of the earlier\ntreatments.\n", "  With new catalogues arriving such as the Gaia DR1, containing more than a\nbillion objects, new methods of handling and visualizing these data volumes are\nneeded. In visualization, one problem is that the number of datapoints can\nbecome so large, that a scatter plot becomes cluttered. Another problem is that\nwith over a billion objects, only a few cpu cycles are available per object if\none wants to process them within a second, making traditional methods by\nrendering glyphs not viable. Instead, we show that by calculating statistics on\na regular (N-dimensional) grid, visualizations of a billion objects can be done\nwithin a second on a modern desktop computer. This is achieved using memory\nmapping of hdf5 files together with a simple binning algorithm, which are part\nof a Python library called vaex. This enables efficient exploration or large\ndatasets interactively, making science exploration of large catalogues\nfeasible. Vaex is a Python library, which also integrates well in the\nJupyter/Numpy/Astropy/matplotlib stack. Build on top of this is the vaex\napplication, which allows for interactive exploration and visualization. The\nmotivation for developing vaex is the catalogue of the Gaia satellite, however,\nvaex can also be used on SPH or N-body simulations, any other (future)\ncatalogues such as SDSS, Pan-STARRS, LSST, WISE, 2MASS, etc. or other tabular\ndata. The homepage for vaex is http://vaex.astro.rug.nl.\n", "  In this work we study various aspects of supersymmetric three-dimensional\nhigher-derivative field theories. We classify all possible models without\nderivative terms in the auxiliary field of the fermionic sector and find that\nscalar field theories of the form $P(X,\\phi)$, where $X=-(\\partial\\phi)^2/2$,\nbelong to this kind of models. A ghost-free supersymmetric extension of\nGalileon models is found in three spacetime dimensions. Finally, the auxiliary\nfield problem is discussed.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the next-generation optical\nimaging survey sited at Cerro Pachon in Chile, will provide an unprecedented\ndatabase of astronomical measurements. The LSST design, with an 8.4m (6.7m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 sq. deg. field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera, will allow about 10,000 sq. deg. of sky to be covered twice per night,\nevery three to four nights on average, with typical 5-sigma depth for point\nsources of $r$=24.5 (AB). With over 800 observations in $ugrizy$ bands over a\n10-year period, these data will enable a deep stack reaching $r$=27.5 (about 5\nmagnitudes deeper than SDSS) and faint time-domain astronomy. The measured\nproperties of newly discovered and known astrometric and photometric transients\nwill be publicly reported within 60 sec after observation. The vast database of\nabout 30 trillion observations of 40 billion objects will be mined for the\nunexpected and used for precision experiments in astrophysics. In addition to a\nbrief introduction to LSST, we discuss a number of astro-statistical challenges\nthat need to be overcome to extract maximum information and science results\nfrom LSST dataset.\n", "  Using recent data from photometric monitoring and data from the photographic\nplate archives we aim to study, the long-term photometric behavior of FUors.\nThe construction of the historical light curves of FUors could be very\nimportant for determining the beginning of the outburst, the time to reach the\nmaximum light, the rate of increase and decrease in brightness, the\npre-outburst variability of the star. Our CCD photometric observations were\nperformed with the telescopes of the Rozhen (Bulgaria) and Skinakas (Crete,\nGreece) observatories. Most suitable for long-term photometric study are the\nplate archives of the big Schmidt telescopes, as the telescopes at Kiso\nObservatory, Asiago Observatory, Palomar Observatory and others. In comparing\nour results with light curves of the well-studied FUors, we conclude that every\nnew FUor object shows different photometric behavior. Each known FUor has a\ndifferent rate of increase and decrease in brightness and a different light\ncurve shape.\n", "  Any particle that is charged under $SU(3)_C$ and $U(1)_{EM}$ can mediate the\n$gg \\rightarrow {\\gamma}{\\gamma}$ process through loops. Near the threshold for\nthe new particle pair production, gauge boson exchanges necessitate the\nresummation of ladder diagrams. We discuss the leading log order matching of\nthe one-loop result with non-relativistic effective theory resummed result. We\nshow how the diphoton invariant mass spectrum varies depending on decay width,\ncolor representation and electric charge of the new particle. The exclusion\nlimits on the product of $SU(3)_C$ and $U(1)_{EM}$ charges of the new scalar or\nfermion particle are obtained from current LHC data.\n", "  Future galaxy surveys promise to probe local primordial non-Gaussianity at\nunprecedented precision, $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}) \\lesssim 1$. We study the\nimplications for multifield inflation by considering spectator models, where\ninflation is driven by the inflaton field, but the primordial perturbations are\n(partially) generated by a second, spectator field. We perform an MCMC\nlikelihood analysis using Planck data to study quantitative predictions for\n$f_{\\rm NL}$ and other observables for a range of such spectator models. We\nshow that models where the primordial perturbations are dominated by the\nspectator field, while fine-tuned within the broader parameter space, typically\npredict $f_{\\rm NL}$ of order unity. Therefore, upcoming galaxy clustering\nmeasurements will constitute a stringent test of whether or not the generation\nof primordial perturbations and the accelerated expansion in the inflationary\nuniverse are due to separate phenomena.\n", "  We investigate the role of the Coulomb interaction on the liquid-gas phase\ntransition of nuclear matter with three different values of proton fraction\n($Y_p$=0.5,0.3 and 0.1), relevant for heavy-ion physics as well as various\nastrophysical scenarios, within the framework of quantum molecular dynamics. We\nperform simulations for a wide range of density and temperature with and\nwithout the Coulomb interaction and calculate the two-point correlation\nfunctions of nucleon density fluctuations for all the configurations to\ndetermine the phase transition region. We also determine the critical end point\nof the liquid-gas phase transition for all three values of proton fraction\nconsidered. We observe that the Coulomb interaction reduces the transition\ntemperature by about 2 MeV for nuclear matter with $Y_p$=0.5 and 0.3 and by\nabout 1 MeV for nuclear matter with $Y_p$=0.1. However, the critical density is\nfound to be more or less insensitive to the Coulomb interaction.\n", "  After its first implementation in 2003 the Astro-WISE technology has been\nrolled out in several European countries and is used for the production of the\nKiDS survey data. In the multi-disciplinary Target initiative this technology,\nnicknamed WISE technology, has been further applied to a large number of\nprojects. Here, we highlight the data handling of other astronomical\napplications, such as VLT-MUSE and LOFAR, together with some non-astronomical\napplications such as the medical projects Lifelines and GLIMPS, the MONK\nhandwritten text recognition system, and business applications, by amongst\nothers, the Target Holding. We describe some of the most important lessons\nlearned and describe the application of the data-centric WISE type of approach\nto the Science Ground Segment of the Euclid satellite.\n", "  The history and current status of the cross-disciplinary fields of\nastrostatistics and astroinformatics are reviewed. Astronomers need a wide\nrange of statistical methods for both data reduction and science analysis. With\nthe proliferation of high-throughput telescopes, efficient large scale\ncomputational methods are also becoming essential. However, astronomers receive\nonly weak training in these fields during their formal education. Interest in\nthe fields is rapidly growing with conferences organized by scholarly\nsocieties, textbooks and tutorial workshops, and research studies pushing the\nfrontiers of methodology. R, the premier language of statistical computing, can\nprovide an important software environment for the incorporation of advanced\nstatistical and computational methodology into the astronomical community.\n", "  We report the discovery of a substellar companion around the giant star\nHIP67537. Based on precision radial velocity measurements from CHIRON and FEROS\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic data, we derived the following orbital elements\nfor HIP67537$\\,b$: m$_b$sin$i$ = 11.1$^{+0.4}_{-1.1}$ M$_{\\rm {\\tiny jup}}$,\n$a$ = 4.9$^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ AU and $e$ = 0.59$^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$. Considering\nrandom inclination angles, this object has $\\gtrsim$ 65% probability to be\nabove the theoretical deuterium-burning limit, thus it is one of the few known\nobjects in the planet to brown-dwarf transition region. In addition, we\nanalyzed the Hipparcos astrometric data of this star, from which we derived a\nminimum inclination angle for the companion of $\\sim$ 2 deg. This value\ncorresponds to an upper mass limit of $\\sim$ 0.3 M$_\\odot$, therefore the\nprobability that HIP67537$\\,b$ is stellar in nature is $\\lesssim$ 7%. The large\nmass of the host star and the high orbital eccentricity makes HIP67537$\\,b$ a\nvery interesting and rare substellar object. This is the second candidate\ncompanion in the brown dwarf desert detected in the sample of intermediate-mass\nstars targeted by the EXPRESS radial velocity program, which corresponds to a\ndetection fraction of $f$ = 1.6$^{+2.0}_{-0.5}$%. This value is larger than the\nfraction observed in solar-type stars, providing new observational evidence of\nan enhanced formation efficiency of massive substellar companions in massive\ndisks. Finally, we speculate about different formation channels for this\nobject.\n", "  We investigate the temperature dependence of photon coherence properties\nthrough two photon interference (TPI) measurements from a single QD under\nresonant excitation. We show that the loss of indistinguishability is only\nrelated to the electron-phonon coupling without being affected by spectral\ndiffusion. Through these measurements, and a complementary microscopic theory,\nwe identify two independent separate decoherence processes each associated to\nphonons. Below 10K, we find that the relaxation of the vibrational lattice is\nthe dominant contribution to the loss of TPI visibility. This process is\nnon-Markovian in nature, and corresponds to real phonon transitions resulting\nin a broad phonon sideband in the QD emission spectra. Above 10K, virtual\nphonon transitions to higher lying excited states in the QD become the dominant\ndephasing mechanism, this leads to broadening of the zero phonon line, and a\ncorresponding rapid decay in the visibility. The microscopic theory we develop\nprovides analytic expressions for the dephasing rates for both virtual phonon\nscattering and non-Markovian lattice relaxation.\n", "  The time domain is the emerging forefront of astronomical research with new\nfacilities and instruments providing unprecedented amounts of data on the\ntemporal behavior of astrophysical populations. Dealing with the size and\ncomplexity of this requires new techniques and methodologies. Quasars are an\nideal work set for developing and applying these: they vary in a detectable but\nnot easily quantifiable manner whose physical origins are poorly understood. In\nthis paper, we will review how quasars are identified by their variability and\nhow these techniques can be improved, what physical insights into their\nvariability can be gained from studying extreme examples of variability, and\nwhat approaches can be taken to increase the number of quasars known. These\nwill demonstrate how astroinformatics is essential to discovering and\nunderstanding this important population.\n", "  The current archives of LAMOST multi-object spectrograph contain millions of\nfully reduced spectra, from which the automatic pipelines have produced\ncatalogues of many parameters of individual objects, including their\napproximate spectral classification. This is, however, mostly based on the\nglobal shape of the whole spectrum and on integral properties of spectra in\ngiven bandpasses, namely presence and equivalent width of prominent spectral\nlines, while for identification of some interesting object types (e.g. Be stars\nor quasars) the detailed shape of only a few lines is crucial. Here the machine\nlearning is bringing a new methodology capable of improving the reliability of\nclassification of such objects even in boundary cases.\n  We present results of Spark-based semi-supervised machine learning of LAMOST\nspectra attempting to automatically identify the single and double-peak\nemission of H alpha line typical for Be and B[e] stars. The labelled sample was\nobtained from archive of 2m Perek telescope at Ond\\v{r}ejov observatory. A\nsimple physical model of spectrograph resolution was used in domain adaptation\nto LAMOST training domain. The resulting list of candidates contains dozens of\nBe stars (some are likely yet unknown), but also a bunch of interesting objects\nresembling spectra of quasars and even blazars, as well as many instrumental\nartefacts. The verification of a nature of interesting candidates benefited\nconsiderably from cross-matching and visualisation in the Virtual Observatory\nenvironment.\n", "  Relaxor ferroelectrics are complex oxide materials which are rather unique to\nstudy the effects of compositional disorder on phase transitions. Here, we\nstudy the effects of quenched cubic random electric fields on the lattice\ninstabilities that lead to a ferroelectric transition and show that, within a\nmicroscopic model and a statistical mechanical solution, even weak\ncompositional disorder can prohibit the development of long-range order and\nthat a random field state with anisotropic and power-law correlations of\npolarization emerges from the combined effect of their characteristic dipole\nforces and their inherent charge disorder. We compare and reproduce several key\nexperimental observations in the well- studied relaxor\nPbMg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$.\n", "  In this short review I discuss how high energy (type I) seesaw models can be\nnicely embedded within grand-unified models and reproduce the observed\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry with leptogenesis. In particular, after discussing\ngeneral features and results in leptogenesis,\n  I focus on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis and on a particular solution, the\nstrong thermal $SO(10)$-inspired solution, that provides an interesting way to\nunderstand neutrino mixing parameters: the non-vanishing reactor mixing angle,\nthe emerging negative sign of $\\sin\\delta$ and the slight hints favouring\nnormally ordered neutrino masses and an atmospheric mixing angle in the first\noctant. I also briefly discuss leptogenesis within two right-handed seesaw\nneutrino models. In this case a a third decoupled right-handed neutrino can\nprovide a candidate for very heavy cold decaying dark matter produced from\nright-handed neutrino mixing with a mass in the TeV-EeV range and its decays\nwould give a contribution to the IceCube high energy neutrino events in\naddition to an astrophysical component.\n", "  Recent ab initio lattice studies have found that the interactions between\nalpha particles (4He nuclei) are sensitive to seemingly minor details of the\nnucleon-nucleon force such as interaction locality. In order to uncover the\nessential physics of this puzzling phenomenon without unnecessary\ncomplications, we study a simple model involving two-component fermions in one\nspatial dimension. We probe the interaction between two bound dimers for\nseveral different particle-particle interactions and measure an effective\npotential between the dimers using external point potentials which act as\nnumerical tweezers. We find that the strength and range of the local part of\nthe particle-particle interactions play a dominant role in shaping the\ninteractions between the dimers and can even determine the overall sign of the\neffective potential.\n", "  We investigate the critical properties of the Lee-Yang model in less than six\nspacetime dimensions using truncations of the functional renormalization group\nflow. We give estimates for the critical exponents, study the dependence on the\nregularization scheme, and show the convergence of our results for increasing\nsize of the truncations in four and five dimensions. While with our truncations\nit is numerically challenging to approach the three-dimensional case, we\nprovide a simple approximation which allows us to qualitatively study the\nLee-Yang model in two and three dimensions, and use it to argue the existence\nof further nonunitary multicritical theories including one which is relevant\nfor the universality class of the Blume-Capel model.\n", "  Context. Galactic structure studies can be used as a path to constrain the\nscenario of formation and evolution of our Galaxy. The dependence with the age\nof stellar population parameters would be linked with the history of star\nformation and dynamical evolution. Aims. We aim to investigate the structures\nof the outer Galaxy, such as the scale length, disc truncation, warp and flare\nof the thin disc and study their dependence with age by using 2MASS data and a\npopulation synthesis model (the so-called Besan\\c{c}on Galaxy Model). Methods.\nWe have used a genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters on the observed\ncolour-magnitude diagrams at longitudes 80 deg <= l <= 280 deg for |b| <= 5.5\ndeg. We explored parameter degeneracies and uncertainties. Results. We identify\na clear dependence of the thin disc scale length, warp and flare shapes with\nage. The scale length is found to vary between 3.8 kpc for the youngest to\nabout 2 kpc for the oldest. The warp shows a complex structure, clearly\nasymmetrical with a node angle changing with age from approximately 165 deg for\nold stars to 195 deg for young stars. The outer disc is also flaring with a\nscale height that varies by a factor of two between the solar neighbourhood and\na Galactocentric distance of 12 kpc. Conclusions. We conclude that the thin\ndisc scale length is in good agreement with the inside-out formation scenario\nand that the outer disc is not in dynamical equilibrium. The warp deformation\nwith time may provide some clues to its origin.\n", "  The glueball dark matter, in the pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, engenders dark\nSU(N) stars that comprise self-gravitating compact configurations of scalar\nglueball fields. Corrections to the highest frequency of gravitational wave\nradiation emitted by dark SU(N) star mergers on a fluid brane with variable\ntension, implemented by the minimal geometric deformation, are derived and\ntheir consequences analysed. Hence, dark SU(N) stars mergers on a fluid\nbrane-world are shown to be better detectable by the LIGO and the eLISA\nexperiments.\n", "  Based mostly on stellar models which do not include rotation, CO white dwarfs\nwhich accrete helium at rates of about $\\sim\n10^{-8}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot/\\mathrm{yr}$ have been put forward as candidate\nprogenitors for a number of transient astrophysical phenomena, including\nsupernovae of Type Ia, and the peculiar and fainter Type Iax supernovae. Here\nwe study the impact of accretion-induced spin-up including the subsequent\nmagnetic field generation, angular momentum transport, and viscous heating on\nthe white dwarf evolution up to the point of helium ignition. We resolve the\nstructure of the helium accreting white dwarf models with a one dimensional\nLangrangian hydrodynamic code, modified to include rotational and magnetic\neffects. We find magnetic angular momentum transport, which leads to quasi\nsolid-body rotation, profoundly impacts the evolution of the white dwarf\nmodels. Our rotating lower mass ($0.54$ and $0.82~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) models\naccrete up to 50\\% more mass up to ignition compared to the non-rotating case\nand the opposite for our more massive models. Furthermore, we find that\nrotation leads to up to 10-times smaller helium ignition densities, except for\nthe lowest adopted initial white dwarf mass. Ignition densities of order\n$10^6\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^3$ are only found for the lowest accretion rates and for\nlarge amounts of accreted helium $\\gtrsim 0.4\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. However,\ncorrespondingly massive donor stars would transfer mass at much higher rates.\nWe expect explosive He-shell burning to mostly occur as deflagrations and at\n$\\dot{M}>2\\cdot10^{-8}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot/\\mathrm{yr}$, regardless of white dwarf\nmass. Our results imply that helium accretion onto CO white dwarfs at the\nconsidered rates is unlikely to lead to explosions of the CO core or to\nclassical Type,Ia supernovae, but may instead produce events like faint and\nfast hydrogen-free supernovae.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on spin chain materials K$_2$CuSO$_4$Cl$_2$\nand K$_2$CuSO$_4$Br$_2$, we theoretically investigate the problem of weakly\ncoupled spin chains (chain exchange $J$, interchain $J'$) subject to a\n$\\textit{staggered between chains}$, but $\\textit{uniform}$ within a given\nchain, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction of magnitude $D$. In the\nexperimentally relevant limit $J' \\ll D \\ll J$ of strong DM interaction the\nspins on the neighboring chains are forced to rotate in opposite directions,\neffectively resulting in a cancelation of the interchain interaction between\ncomponents of spins in the plane normal to the vector ${\\pmb D}$. This has the\neffect of promoting two-dimensional collinear spin density wave (SDW) state,\nwhich preserves U(1) symmetry of rotations about the $\\pmb D$-axis. We also\ninvestigate response of this interesting system to an external magnetic field\n${\\pmb h}$ and obtain the $h-D$ phase diagrams for the two important\nconfigurations, ${\\pmb h} \\parallel {\\pmb D}$ and ${\\pmb h} \\perp {\\pmb D}$.\n", "  We describe here the parallels in astronomy and earth science datasets, their\nanalyses, and the opportunities for methodology transfer from astroinformatics\nto geoinformatics. Using example of hydrology, we emphasize how meta-data and\nontologies are crucial in such an undertaking. Using the infrastructure being\ndesigned for EarthCube - the Virtual Observatory for the earth sciences - we\ndiscuss essential steps for better transfer of tools and techniques in the\nfuture e.g. domain adaptation. Finally we point out that it is never a one-way\nprocess and there is enough for astroinformatics to learn from geoinformatics\nas well.\n", "  For applications exploiting the valley pseudospin degree of freedom in\ntransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, efficient preparation of electrons\nor holes in a single valley is essential. Here, we show that a magnetic field\nof 7 Tesla leads to a near-complete valley polarization of electrons in MoSe2\nmonolayer with a density 1.6x10^{12} cm^{-2}; in the absence of exchange\ninteractions favoring single-valley occupancy, a similar degree of valley\npolarization would have required a pseudospin g-factor exceeding 40. To\ninvestigate the magnetic response, we use polarization resolved\nphotoluminescence as well as resonant reflection measurements. In the latter,\nwe observe gate voltage dependent transfer of oscillator strength from the\nexciton to the attractive-Fermi-polaron: stark differences in the spectrum of\nthe two light helicities provide a confirmation of valley polarization. Our\nfindings suggest an interaction induced giant paramagnetic response of MoSe2,\nwhich paves the way for valleytronics applications.\n", "  We measured the magnetoresistance of the 2D electron liquid formed at the\n(111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. The hexagonal symmetry of the interface is\nmanifested in a six-fold crystalline component appearing in the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (AMR) and planar Hall data, which agree well with symmetry\nanalysis we performed. The six-fold component increases with carrier\nconcentration, reaching 15% of the total AMR signal. Our results suggest the\ncoupling between higher itinerant electronic bands and the crystal as the\norigin of this effect and demonstrate that the (111) oxide interface is a\nunique hexagonal system with tunable magnetocrystalline effects.\n", "  In order to localize fermions on branes with codimension one, one usually\nintroduces the Yukawa coupling between fermions and background scalar fields or\nthe recently proposed derivative fermion-scalar coupling in [Phys. Rev. D 89\n(2014) 086001]. In this paper, we explore the coupling between a spinor field\n$\\Psi$ and the scalar curvature of spacetime $R$, $\\eta\\Psi\\Gamma^M\\partial_M\nF(R)\\gamma^5\\bar{\\Psi}$ with $F(R)$ a function of $R$, to investigate\nlocalization of the fermion. Because of $Z_2$ symmetry of the extra dimension,\nthe new coupling mechanism proposed here can easily deal with the problem\nencountered in the Yukawa coupling with even background scalar fields. More\nimportantly, the new mechanism will also work for the branes without background\nscalar fields. By investigating three examples, we find that fermions can be\nlocalized on the branes with the new mechanism.\n", "  It is shown that several habitability conditions (in fact, at least seven\nsuch conditions) appear to be fulfilled automatically by circumbinary planets\nof main-sequence stars (CBP-MS), whereas on Earth these conditions are\nfulfilled only by chance. Therefore, it looks natural that most of the\nproduction of replicating biopolymers in the Galaxy is concentrated on\nparticular classes of CBP-MS, and life on Earth is an outlier, in this sense.\nIn this scenario, Lathe's mechanism for the tidal \"chain reaction\" abiogenesis\non Earth is favored as generic for CBP-MS, due to photo-tidal synchronization\ninherent to them. Problems with this scenario are discussed in detail.\n", "  Appealing to the 1902 Gibbs' formalism for classical statistical mechanics\n(SM), the first SM axiomatic theory ever that successfully explained\nequilibrium thermodynamics, we will here show that already at the classical\nlevel there is a strong correlation between the Renyi's exponent $\\alpha$ and\nthe number of particles for very simple systems. No reference to heat baths is\nneeded for such a purpose.\n", "  We investigate the contributions from the so-called elliptic gluon Wigner\ndistributions to the rapidity and azimuthal correlations of particles produced\nin high energy $pA$ collisions by applying the double parton scattering\nmechanism. We compute the `elliptic flow' parameter $v_2$ as a function of the\ntransverse momentum and rapidity, and find qualitative agreement with\nexperimental observations. This shall encourage further developments with more\nrigorous studies of the elliptic gluon distributions and their applications in\nhard scattering processes in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions.\n", "  We present analysis of RXTE--PCA observations of GX 1+4 between March 3, 2001\nand January 31, 2003 together with the CGRO--BATSE X-ray flux and frequency\nderivative time series between 1991 and 1999. From the timing analysis of\nRXTE-PCA observations, we are able to phase connect pulse arrival times of the\nsource within two different time intervals and obtain corresponding timing\nsolutions. Using these pulse arrival times, we contribute to long term pulse\nfrequency history of the source. We look for episodic correlations and\nanti-correlations between torque and X-ray luminosity using CGRO--BATSE X-ray\nflux and frequency derivative time series and find that correlation state of GX\n1+4 seems to change on $\\sim$ 100-200 days long intervals. We estimate torque\nnoise of the source and observe flickering noise ($f^{-1}$). We achieve to\nmeasure the longest observed timescale for a noise process among accretion\npowered X-ray pulsars by extending the noise estimate for a time scale ranging\nfrom 31 days to 44 years. Spectral analysis of individual RXTE-PCA observations\nindicates a significant correlation between iron line flux and unabsorbed X-ray\nflux. Pulse phase resolved spectra of the source indicate a broadening of iron\nline complex at the bin corresponding to the pulse minimum.\n", "  We present a generalized Landau-Brazovskii free energy for the solidification\nof chiral molecules on a spherical surface in the context of the assembly of\nviral shells. We encounter two types of icosahedral solidification transitions.\nThe first type is a conventional first-order phase transition from the uniform\nto the icosahedral state. It can be described by a single icosahedral spherical\nharmonic of even $l$. The chiral pseudo-scalar term in the free energy creates\nsecondary terms with chiral character but it does not affect the thermodynamics\nof the transition. The second type, associated with icosahedral spherical\nharmonics with odd $l$, is anomalous. Pure odd $l$ icosahedral states are\nunstable but stability is recovered if admixture with the neighboring $l+1$\nicosahedral spherical harmonic is included, generated by the non-linear terms.\nThis is in conflict with the principle of Landau theory that symmetry-breaking\ntransitions are characterized by only a \\textit{single} irreducible\nrepresentation of the symmetry group of the uniform phase and we argue that\nthis principle should be removed from Landau theory. The chiral term now\ndirectly affects the transition because it lifts the degeneracy between two\nisomeric mixed-$l$ icosahedral states. A direct transition is possible only\nover a limited range of parameters. Outside this range, non-icosahedral states\nintervene. For the important case of capsid assembly dominated by $l=15$, the\nintervening states are found to be based on octahedral symmetry.\n", "  We discuss the stability of highly degenerate zero-energy states tha appear\nat the surface of a nodal superconductor preserving time-reversal symmetry. The\nexistence of such surface states is a direct consequence of the nontrivial\ntopological numbers defined in the restricted Brillouin zones in the clean\nlimit. In experiments, however, potential disorder is inevitable near the\nsurface of a real superconductor, which may lift the high degeneracy at zero\nenergy. We show that an index defined in terms of the chiral eigenvalues of the\nzero-energy states can be used to measure the degree of degeneracy at zero\nenergy in the presence of potential disorder. We also discuss the relationship\nbetween the index and the topological numbers.\n", "  The $p\\bar{p}$ invariant mass spectra of the processes $J/\\psi\\to\np\\bar{p}\\omega$, $J/\\psi\\to p\\bar{p}\\rho$, and $J/\\psi\\to p\\bar{p}\\gamma$ close\nto the $p\\bar{p}$ threshold are calculated by means of the $N\\bar{N}$ optical\npotential. The potential model for $N\\bar{N}$ interaction in the $^{1}S_{0}$\nstate is proposed. The parameters of the model are obtained by fitting the\ncross section of $N\\bar{N}$ scattering together with the $p\\bar{p}$ invariant\nmass spectra of the $J/\\psi$ decays. Good agreement with the available\nexperimental data is achieved. Using our potential and the Green's function\napproach we also describe the peak in the $\\eta'\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ invariant mass\nspectrum in the decay $J/\\psi\\to\\gamma\\eta'\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ in the energy region\nnear the $N\\bar{N}$ threshold.\n", "  Establishing accurate morphological measurements of galaxies in a reasonable\namount of time for future big-data surveys such as EUCLID, the Large Synoptic\nSurvey Telescope or the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope is a challenge.\nBecause of its high level of abstraction with little human intervention, deep\nlearning appears to be a promising approach. Deep learning is a rapidly growing\ndiscipline that models high-level patterns in data as complex multilayered\nnetworks. In this work we test the ability of deep convolutional networks to\nprovide parametric properties of Hubble Space Telescope like galaxies\n(half-light radii, Sersic indices, total flux etc..). We simulate a set of\ngalaxies including point spread function and realistic noise from the CANDELS\nsurvey and try to recover the main galaxy parameters using deep-learning. We\ncom- pare the results with the ones obtained with the commonly used profile\nfitting based software GALFIT. This way showing that with our method we obtain\nresults at least equally good as the ones obtained with GALFIT but, once\ntrained, with a factor 5 hundred time faster.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of two interacting bosonic atoms confined\nin a one-dimensional anharmonic trap. The tunneling rate, an experimentally\nmeasurable parameter of the system, was calculated as a function of the\neffective coupling interatomic constant $g$ from the ground (n=N=0) and first\nexcited atomic states in the trap with respect to relative (n=2,N=0) and\ncenter-of-mass (n=0,N=2) atomic motion. This allows to investigate the initial\npopulation and pair correlation, as well as the effective coupling constant\n$g$, of the system by comparing the calculated tunneling rate with the\nexperimental one. We have observed that the only possible tunneling scenario is\na sequential particle tunneling in the cases we considered. We have also\nanalyzed a rearrangement $(0,2)\\rightleftarrows(2,0)$ of the spectrum in the\nlimit $g\\rightarrow \\pm 0$ of noninteracting atoms.\n", "  We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on ordered\ndouble perovskite samples containing Re$^{5+}$ and Ir$^{5+}$ with $5d^2$ and\n$5d^4$ electronic configurations respectively. In particular, the observed RIXS\nspectra of Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Sr$_2$MIrO$_6$ (M=Y, Gd) show sharp\nintra-t$_{2g}$ transitions, which can be quantitatively understood using a\nminimal `atomic' Hamiltonian incorporating spin-orbit coupling ($\\lambda$) and\nHund's coupling ($J_H$). Our analysis yields $\\lambda=0.38(2)$eV with\n$J_H=0.26(2)$eV for Re$^{5+}$, and $\\lambda=0.42(2)$eV with $J_H=0.25(4)$eV for\nIr$^{5+}$. Our results provide the first sharp estimates for the Hund's\ncoupling in $5d$ oxides, and suggest that it should be treated on equal footing\nwith spin-orbit interaction in multi-orbital $5d$ transition metal compounds.\n", "  Within the framework of the relativistic Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport\nmodel based on the relativistic nonlinear NL$\\rho$ interaction, we study pion\nin-medium effects on the $\\pi^-/\\pi^+$ ratio in Au+Au collisions at the energy\nof $E/A=400~\\mathrm{MeV}$. These effects include the isospin-dependent pion\ns-wave and p-wave potentials, which are taken from calculations based on the\nchiral perturbation theory and the $\\Delta$-hole model, respectively. We find\nthat the $\\pi^-/\\pi^+$ ratio in this collision is suppressed by the pion s-wave\npotential but enhanced by the p-wave potential, with a net effect of a\nsignificantly suppressed $\\pi^-/\\pi^+$ ratio. Including also the in-medium\nthreshold effects on $\\Delta$ resonance production and decay and using a\nnuclear symmetry energy with a slope parameter $L=59~\\mathrm{MeV}$ by reducing\nthe coupling of isovector-vector $\\rho$ meson to nucleon, our result is in good\nagreement with measured $\\pi^-/\\pi^+$ ratio from the FOPI Collaboration. We\nfurther investigate the pion in-medium effects on the ratio of charged pions as\na function of their kinetic energies.\n", "  We describe production of heavy quarkonia in pA collisions within the dipole\napproach, assuming dominance of the perturbative color-singlet mechanism (CSM)\nin the $p_T$-integrated cross section. Although accounting for a nonzero heavy\n$Q$-$\\bar Q$ separation is a higher twist correction, usually neglected, we\nfound it to be the dominant source of nuclear effects, significantly exceeding\nthe effects of leading twist gluon shadowing and energy loss. Moreover, this\ncontribution turns out to be the most reliably predicted, relying on the\nprecise measurements of the dipole cross section at HERA. The nuclear\nsuppression of quarkonia has been anticipated to become stronger with energy,\nbecause the dipole cross section steeply rises. However, the measured nuclear\neffects remain essentially unchanged within the energy range from RHIC to the\nLHC. A novel production mechanism is proposed, which enhances the charmonium\nyield. Nuclear effects for the production of $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$,\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ are calculated, in agreement with data from\nRHIC and LHC. The dipole description offers a unique explanation for the\nobserved significant nuclear suppression of $\\psi(2S)$ to $J/\\psi$ ratio,\nrelated to the nontrivial features of the $\\psi(2S)$ wave function.\n", "  Structure of light antikaon-nuclear quasi-bound states, which consist of an\nantikaon $(\\bar{K}=K^-,~\\bar{K}^0)$ and a few nucleons $(N=p,~n)$ such as\n$\\bar{K}NN$, $\\bar{K}NNN$, $\\bar{K}NNNN$ and $\\bar{K}NNNNNN$ systems, is\nstudied with full three- to seven-body calculations. Employing a realistic\n$\\bar{K}N$ potential based on the chiral SU(3) effective field theory with the\nSIDDHARTA constraint, we show that the central nucleon densities of these\nsystems increases when the antikaon is injected, by about factor of two at\nmaximum. The $\\bar{K}NNNN$ system shows the largest central density, about 0.74\nfm$^{-3}$ even with the phenomenological $\\bar{K}N$ potential, which are not as\nhigh as those suggested in previous studies with approximate treatments of the\nfew-body systems. We find the spin of the ground state of the $\\bar{K}NNNNNN$\nsystem depends on the strength of the $\\bar{K}N$ attraction. Thus, the quantum\nnumber of the ground state can be another constraint on the $\\bar{K}N$\ninteraction.\n", "  In the modern galaxy surveys photometric redshifts play a central role in a\nbroad range of studies, from gravitational lensing and dark matter distribution\nto galaxy evolution. Using a dataset of about 25,000 galaxies from the second\ndata release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) we obtain photometric redshifts\nwith five different methods: (i) Random forest, (ii) Multi Layer Perceptron\nwith Quasi Newton Algorithm, (iii) Multi Layer Perceptron with an optimization\nnetwork based on the Levenberg-Marquardt learning rule, (iv) the Bayesian\nPhotometric Redshift model (or BPZ) and (v) a classical SED template fitting\nprocedure (Le Phare). We show how SED fitting techniques could provide useful\ninformation on the galaxy spectral type which can be used to improve the\ncapability of machine learning methods constraining systematic errors and\nreduce the occurrence of catastrophic outliers. We use such classification to\ntrain specialized regression estimators, by demonstrating that such hybrid\napproach, involving SED fitting and machine learning in a single collaborative\nframework, is capable to improve the overall prediction accuracy of photometric\nredshifts.\n", "  Euclid is a Europe-led cosmology space mission dedicated to a visible and\nnear infrared survey of the entire extra-galactic sky. Its purpose is to deepen\nour knowledge of the dark content of our Universe. After an overview of the\nEuclid mission and science, this contribution describes how the community is\ngetting organized to face the data analysis challenges, both in software\ndevelopment and in operational data processing matters. It ends with a more\nspecific account of some of the main contributions of the Swiss Science Data\nCenter (SDC-CH).\n", "  We study quantum corrections to projectable Horava gravity with $z = 2$\nscaling in 2+1 dimensions. Using the background field method, we utilize a\nnon-singular gauge to compute the anomalous dimension of the cosmological\nconstant at one loop, in a normalization adapted to the spatial curvature term.\n", "  In this work we predict the existence of a novel species of Wannier excitons\nwhen exposed to crossed electric and magnetic fields. In particular, we present\na theory of giant-dipole excitons in $\\textrm{Cu}_2\\rm O$ in crossed fields.\nWithin our theoretical approach we perform a pseudoseparation of the\ncenter-of-mass motion for the field-dressed excitonic species, thereby\nobtaining an effective single-particle Hamiltonian for the relative motion. For\narbitrary gauge fields we exactly separate the gauge-dependent kinetic energy\nterms from the effective single-particle interaction potential. Depending on\nthe applied field strengths and the specific field orientation, the potential\nfor the relative motion of electron and hole exhibits an outer well at spatial\nseparations up to several micrometers and depths up to $380\\, \\mu \\rm eV$,\nleading to possible permanent excitonic electric dipole moments of around three\nmillion Debye.\n", "  Schroeder diffuser is a classical design, proposed over 40 years ago, for\nartificially creating optimal and predictable sound diffuse reflection. It has\nbeen widely adopted in architectural acoustics and it has also shown\nsubstantial potential in noise control, ultrasound imaging, microparticle\nmanipulation, among others. The conventional Schroeder diffuser, however, has a\nconsiderable thickness on the order of one wavelength, severely impeding its\napplications for low frequency sound. In this paper, a new class of ultra-thin\nand planar Schroeder diffusers are proposed based on the concept of acoustic\nmetasurface. Both numerical and experimental results demonstrate satisfactory\nsound diffuse reflection produced from the metasurface-based Schroeder diffuser\ndespite it being one order of magnitude thinner than the conventional one. The\nproposed design not only offer promising building blocks with great potential\nto profoundly impact architectural acoustics and related fields, but also\nconstitutes a major step towards real-world applications of acoustic\nmetasurfaces.\n", "  We examine integrable turbulence (IT) in the framework of the defocusing\ncubic one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. This is done\ntheoretically and experimentally, by realizing an optical fiber experiment in\nwhich the defocusing Kerr nonlinearity strongly dominates linear dispersive\neffects. Using a dispersive-hydrodynamic approach, we show that the development\nof IT can be divided into two distinct stages, the initial, pre-breaking stage\nbeing described by a system of interacting random Riemann waves. We explain the\nlow-tailed statistics of the wave intensity in IT and show that the Riemann\ninvariants of the asymptotic nonlinear geometric optics system represent the\nobservable quantities that provide new insight into statistical features of the\ninitial stage of the IT development by exhibiting stationary probability\ndensity functions.\n", "  Transport and magnetic studies of PbTaSe$_2$ under pressure suggest existence\nof two superconducting phases with the low temperature phase boundary at $\\sim\n0.25$ GPa that is defined by a very sharp, first order, phase transition. The\nfirst order phase transition line can be followed via pressure dependent\nresistivity measurements, and is found to be near 0.12 GPa near room\ntemperature. Transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction at elevated\ntemperatures confirm that this first order phase transition is structural and\noccurs at ambient pressure near $\\sim 425$ K. The new, high temperature / high\npressure phase has a similar crystal structure and slightly lower unit cell\nvolume relative to the ambient pressure, room temperature structure. Based on\nfirst-principles calculations this structure is suggested to be obtained by\nshifting the Pb atoms from the $1a$ to $1e$ Wyckoff position without changing\nthe positions of Ta and Se atoms. PbTaSe$_2$ has an exceptionally pressure\nsensitive, structural phase transition with $\\Delta T_s/\\Delta P \\approx -\n1700$ K/GPa near 4 K, this first order transition causes an $\\sim 1$ K ($\\sim\n25 \\%$) step - like decrease in $T_c$ as pressure is increased through 0.25\nGPa.\n", "  Exclusive $\\rho^0$-meson electroproduction is studied by the HERMES\nexperiment, using the 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron/positron beam\nof HERA and a transversely polarized hydrogen target, in the kinematic region\n1.0 GeV$^2$<Q$^2$<7.0 GeV$^2$, 3.0 GeV<W<6.3 GeV, and -t'<0.4 GeV$^2$. Using an\nunbinned maximum-likelihood method, 25 parameters are extracted. These\ndetermine the real and imaginary parts of the ratios of several helicity\namplitudes describing $\\rho^0$-meson production by a virtual photon. The\ndenominator of those ratios is the dominant amplitude, the\nnucleon-helicity-non-flip amplitude $F_{0\\frac{1}{2}0\\frac{1}{2}}$, which\ndescribes the production of a longitudinal $\\rho^{0}$-meson by a longitudinal\nvirtual photon. The ratios of nucleon-helicity-non-flip amplitudes are found to\nbe in good agreement with those from the previous HERMES analysis. The\ntransverse target polarization allows for the first time the extraction of\nratios of a number of nucleon-helicity-flip amplitudes to\n$F_{0\\frac{1}{2}0\\frac{1}{2}}$. Results obtained in a handbag approach based on\ngeneralized parton distributions taking into account the contribution from pion\nexchange are found to be in good agreement with these ratios. Within the model,\nthe data favor a positive sign for the $\\pi-\\rho$ transition form factor. By\nalso exploiting the longitudinal beam polarization, a total of 71 $\\rho^0$\nspin-density matrix elements is determined from the extracted 25 parameters, in\ncontrast to only 53 elements as directly determined in earlier analyses.\n", "  Lithium abundance A(Li) and surface rotation are good diagnostic tools to\nprobe the internal mixing and angular momentum transfer in stars. We explore\nthe relation between surface rotation, A(Li) and age in a sample of seismic\nsolar-analogue (SA) stars and study their possible binary nature. We select a\nsample of 18 SA observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis.\nTheir seismic properties and surface rotation are well constrained from\nprevious studies. About 53 hours of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained\nto derive fundamental parameters and A(Li). These values were combined and\nconfronted with seismic masses, radii and ages, as well as surface rotation\nperiods. We identify a total of 6 binary systems. A well-defined relation\nbetween A(Li) and rotation was obtained. With models constrained by the\ncharacterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we\nidentify a sequence of three SA with similar mass (~1.1Mo) and stellar ages\nranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of ~7% for the mass\nuncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the\npredicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the\nToulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal\nmixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We present A(Li) for\na consistent spectroscopic survey of SA with a mass of 1.00+/-0.15Mo, and\ncharacterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on\nKepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and P_rot supports the\ngyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun. The consensus between\nmeasured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated onto the Sun's\nchemical properties suggests that these targets share the same internal\nphysics. In this light, the solar Li and rotation rate appear to be normal for\na star like the Sun.\n", "  We present general relativistic radiation MHD simulations of super-Eddington\naccretion on a $10M_\\odot$ black hole. We consider a range of mass accretion\nrates, black hole spins, and magnetic field configurations. We compute the\nspectra and images of the models as a function of viewing angle, and compare\nthem with the observed properties of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The\nmodels easily produce apparent luminosities in excess of $10^{40}~{\\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}}$ for pole-on observers. However, the angle-integrated radiative\nluminosities rarely exceed $2.5\\times10^{39}~{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$ even for mass\naccretion rates of tens of Eddington. The systems are thus radiatively\ninefficient, though they are energetically efficient when the energy output in\nwinds and jets is also counted. The simulated models reproduce the main\nempirical types of spectra --- disk-like, supersoft, soft, hard --- observed in\nULXs. The magnetic field configuration, whether MAD (\"magnetically arrested\ndisk\") or SANE (\"standard and normal evolution\"), has a strong effect on the\nresults. In SANE models, the X-ray spectral hardness is almost independent of\naccretion rate, but decreases steeply with increasing inclination. MAD models\nwith non-spinning black holes produce significantly softer spectra at higher\nvalues of $\\dot{M}$, even at low inclinations. MAD models with rapidly spinning\nblack holes are quite different from all other models. They are radiatively\nefficient (efficiency factor $\\sim10-20\\%$), super-efficient when the\nmechanical energy output is also included ($70\\%$), and produce hard\nblazar-like spectra. In all models, the emission shows strong geometrical\nbeaming, which disagrees with the more isotropic illumination favored by\nobservations of ULX bubbles.\n", "  The detection of GW150914 by ground based gravitational wave observatories\nhas brought about a new era in astrophysics. At optimal sensitivity, these\nobservatories are expected to detect several events each year, with one or two\nof these occurring with non-negligible eccentricity. Such eccentric binaries\nwill emit bursts of gravitational radiation during every pericenter passage,\nwhere orbital velocities can reach greater than ten percent the speed of light.\nAs a result, such binaries may prove to be powerful probes of extreme\ngravitational physics and astrophysics. A promising method of achieving\ndetection of such binaries is through power stacking, where the power in each\nburst is added up in time-frequency space. This detection strategy requires a\ntheoretical prior of where the bursts will occur in time and frequency so that\none knows where to search for successive bursts. We here present a generic\npost-Newtonian formalism for constructing such time-frequency model priors at\ngeneric post-Newtonian order. We apply our formalism to generate a burst model\nat third post-Newtonian order, making it potentially the most accurate, fully\nanalytic model to date.\n", "  The properties of a phase with large correlation length can be strongly\ninfluenced by the underlying normal phase. We illustrate this by studying the\nhalf-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model using cellular dynamical mean-field\ntheory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. Sharp crossovers in the\nmechanism that favors antiferromagnetic correlations and in the corresponding\nlocal density of states are observed. These crossovers occur at values of the\ninteraction strength $U$ and temperature $T$ that are controlled by the\nunderlying normal-state Mott transition.\n", "  We present a detailed comparison between tidal effective-one-body (EOB)\nmodels and new state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations for\nnon-spinning binary neutron star systems. This comparison is the most extensive\none to date, covering a wide range in the parameter space and encompassing the\nenergetics of the binary, the periastron advance, the time and frequency\nevolution of the gravitational wave phase for the dominant mode, and several\nsubdominant modes. We consider different EOB models with tidal effects that\nhave been proposed, including the model with dynamical tides of [Phys.Rev.Lett.\n116 (2016) no.18, 181101] and the gravitational self-force (GSF) inspired tidal\nEOB model of [Phys.Rev.Lett. 114 (2015) no.16, 161103]. The EOB model with\ndynamical tides leads to the best representation of the systems considered\nhere, however, the differences to the GSF-inspired model are small. A common\nfeature is that for systems where matter effects are large, i.e. stiff\nequations of state or small total masses, all EOB models underestimate the\ntidal effects and differences to the results from numerical relativity\nsimulations become noticeable near the merger. We analyze this regime to\ndiagnose the shortcomings of the models in the late inspiral, where the two\nneutron stars are no longer isolated bodies moving in vacuum. Our work will\nserve to guide further advances in modeling these systems.\n", "  The intermediate-valence compound SmB6 is a well-known Kondo insulator, in\nwhich hybridization of itinerant 5d electrons with localized 4f electrons leads\nto a transition from metallic to insulating behavior at low temperatures.\nRecent studies suggest that SmB6 is a topological insulator, with topological\nmetallic surface states emerging from a fully insulating hybridized bulk band\nstructure. Here we locally probe the bulk magnetic properties of pure and 0.5 %\nFe-doped SmB6 by muon spin rotation/relaxation methods. Below 6 K the Fe\nimpurity induces simultaneous changes in the bulk local magnetism and the\nelectrical conductivity. In the low-temperature insulating bulk state we\nobserve a temperature-independent dynamic relaxation rate indicative of\nlow-lying magnetic excitations driven primarily by quantum fluctuations.\n", "  Recently found double-mode Cepheid with the shortest period in our galaxy and\nabnormal period ratio, V371 Per is investigated by linear nonadiabatic\npulsation models. V371 Per is likely to be crossing the instability strip for\nthe first time because mass derived from pulsation models is larger than the\nevolution mass for the second or higher crossing objects. This result seems to\nsupport the conclusion obtained from the spectroscopic observation. We also\nfound that models with observed period and period ratio of V371 Per need to\nhave mass and Teff in a narrow range which shifts as heavy element abundance Z\nchanges. We have checked the agreement between Teff ranges estimated\nobservationally and derived from pulsation models using observational Z. We\nfound that those ranges overlap marginally. We need more spectroscopic\nestimations of the Teff and [Fe/H], and more photometric monitoring to estimate\nthe evolutionally period change for confirmation of our result.\n", "  General quasi-probabilities are introduced to visualize time-dependent\nquantum correlations of light in phase space. They are based on the\ngeneralization of the Glauber-Sudarshan P function to a time-dependent P\nfunctional [W. Vogel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 013605 (2008)], which fully\ndescribes temporal correlations of radiation fields on the basis of continuous\nphase-space distributions. This approach is nontrivial as the P functional\nitself is highly singular for many quantum states and nonlinear processes. In\ngeneral, it neither yields a well-behaved nor an experimentally accessible\ndescription of quantum stochastic processes. Our regularized version of this\nmulti-time-dependent quasi-probability is a smooth function and applies to\nstronger divergences compared to the single-time and multi-mode scenario. The\ntechnique is used to characterize an optical parametric process with frequency\nmismatch. A measurement scheme, together with a sampling approach, is provided\nwhich yields direct experimental access to the regularized P functional from\nmeasured data.\n", "  We propose a novel type of tunable Yagi-Uda nanoantenna composed of\nmetal-dielectric (Ag-Ge) core-shell nanoparticles. We show that, due to the\ncombination of two types of resonances in each nanoparticle, such hybrid\nYagi-Uda nanoantenna can operate in two different regimes. Besides the\nconventional nonresonant operation regime at low frequencies, characterized by\nhighly directive emission in the forward direction, there is another one at\nhigher frequencies caused by hybrid magneto-electric response of the core-shell\nnanoparticles. This regime is based on the excitation of the van Hove\nsingularity, and emission in this regime is accompanied by high values of\ndirectivity and Purcell factor within the same narrow frequency range. Our\nanalysis reveals the possibility of flexible dynamical tuning of the hybrid\nnanoantenna emission pattern via electron-hole plasma excitation by 100\nfemtosecond pump pulse with relatively low peak intensities $\\sim$200\nMW/cm$^2$.\n", "  The astrophysics community uses different tools for computational tasks such\nas complex systems simulations, radiative transfer calculations or big data.\nProgramming languages like Fortran, C or C++ are commonly present in these\ntools and, generally, the language choice was made based on the need for\nperformance. However, this comes at a cost: safety. For instance, a common\nsource of error is the access to invalid memory regions, which produces random\nexecution behaviors and affects the scientific interpretation of the results.\n  In 2015, Mozilla Research released the first stable version of a new\nprogramming language named Rust. Many features make this new language\nattractive for the scientific community, it is open source and it guarantees\nmemory safety while offering zero-cost abstraction.\n  We explore the advantages and drawbacks of Rust for astrophysics by\nre-implementing the fundamental parts of Mercury-T, a Fortran code that\nsimulates the dynamical and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems.\n", "  We find the analytical solution to the time-dependent density-functional\ntheory (TDDFT) problem for the quasi-low-dimensional (2D and 1D) electron gas\n(QLDEG) with only one band filled in the direction perpendicular to the system\nextent. The theory is developed at the level of TD exact exchange and yields\nthe exchange potential as an explicit nonlocal operator of the spin-density.\nThe dressed interband (image states) excitation spectra of the Q2DEG are\ncalculated, while the comparison with the Kohn-Sham (KS) transitions provides\nthe insight into the qualitative and quantitative role of the many-body\ninteractions. Important cancellations between the Hartree $f_H$ and the\nexchange $f_x$ kernels are found in the low-density limit, shedding light on\nthe interrelations between the KS and many-body excitations.\n", "  Throughout the processing and analysis of survey data, a ubiquitous issue\nnowadays is that we are spoilt for choice when we need to select a methodology\nfor some of its steps. The alternative methods usually fail and excel in\ndifferent data regions, and have various advantages and drawbacks, so a\ncombination that unites the strengths of all while suppressing the weaknesses\nis desirable. We propose to use a two-level hierarchy of learners. Its first\nlevel consists of training and applying the possible base methods on the first\npart of a known set. At the second level, we feed the output probability\ndistributions from all base methods to a second learner trained on the\nremaining known objects. Using classification of variable stars and photometric\nredshift estimation as examples, we show that the hierarchical combination is\ncapable of achieving general improvement over averaging-type combination\nmethods, correcting systematics present in all base methods, is easy to train\nand apply, and thus, it is a promising tool in the astronomical \"Big Data\" era.\n", "  The dynamic response of dipole skyrmions in Fe/Gd multilayer films is\ninvestigated by ferromagnetic resonance measurements and compared to\nmicromagnetic simulations. We detail thickness and temperature dependent\nstudies of the observed modes as well as the effects of magnetic field history\non the resonant spectra. Correlation between the modes and the magnetic phase\nmaps constructed from real-space imaging and scattering patterns allows us to\nconclude the resonant modes arise from local topological features such as\ndipole skyrmions but does not depend on the collective response of a closed\npacked lattice of these chiral textures. Using, micromagnetic modeling, we are\nable to quantitatively reproduce our experimental observations which suggests\nthe existence of localized spin-wave modes that are dependent on the helicity\nof the dipole skyrmion. We identify four localized spin wave excitations for\nthe skyrmions that are excited under either in-plane or out-of-plane r.f.\nfields. Lastly we show that dipole skyrmions and non-chiral bubble domains\nexhibit qualitatively different localized spin wave modes.\n", "  Transmission-line waveguides can mediate long-range fluctuation-induced\nforces between neutral objects. We present two approaches for the description\nof these forces between electric components embedded in transmission-line\ncircuits. The first, following ordinary quantum electrodynamics (QED), consists\nof the quantization and scattering theory of voltage and current waves inside\ntransmission lines. The second approach relies on a simple circuit analysis\nwith additional noisy current sources due to resistors in the circuit, as per\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). We apply the latter approach to\nderive a general formula for the Casimir force induced by circuit fluctuations\nbetween any two impedances. The application of this formula, considering the\nsign of the resulting force, is discussed. While both QED and FDT approaches\nare equivalent, we conclude that the latter is simpler to generalize and solve.\n", "  We conduct a systematic search for galaxies at $z=0.1-1.5$ with\n[OII]$\\lambda3727$, [OIII]$\\lambda5007$, or H$\\alpha\\lambda6563$ emission lines\nextended over at least 30 kpc by using deep narrowband and broadband imaging in\nSubaru-XMM Deep Survey (SXDS) field. These extended emission-line galaxies are\ndubbed [OII], [OIII], or H$\\alpha$ blobs. Based on a new selection method that\nsecurely selects extended emission-line galaxies, we find 77 blobs at\n$z=0.40-1.46$ with the isophotal area of emission lines down to\n$1.2\\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Four of them are\nspectroscopically confirmed to be [OIII] blobs at $z=0.83$. We identify AGN\nactivities in 8 blobs with X-ray and radio data and find that the fraction of\nAGN contribution increases with increasing isophotal area of the extended\nemission. With the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Darling tests, we\nconfirm that the stellar-mass distributions of H$\\alpha$ and [OII] blobs are\nnot drawn from those of the emitters at the $>90$% confidence level in that\nH$\\alpha$ and [OII] blobs are located at the massive end of the distributions,\nbut cannot reject null hypothesis of being the same distributions in terms of\nthe specific star formation rates. It is suggested that galactic-scale outflows\ntend to be more prominent in more massive star-forming galaxies. Exploiting our\nsample homogeneously selected over the large area, we derive the number\ndensities of blobs at each epoch. The number densities of blobs decrease\ndrastically with redshifts at the rate that is larger than that of the decrease\nof cosmic star formation densities.\n", "  We combine space group representation theory together with scanning of closed\nsubdomains of the Brillouin zone with Wilson loops to algebraically determine\nglobal band structure topology. Considering space group #19 as a case study, we\nshow that the energy ordering of the irreducible representations at the\nhigh-symmetry points $\\{\\Gamma,S,T,U\\}$ fully determines the global band\ntopology, with all topological classes characterized through their simple and\ndouble Dirac-points.\n", "  We solve for all Szekeres metrics that have a single Killing vector. For\nquasi hyperboloidal ($\\epsilon = -1$) metrics, we find that translational\nsymmetries are possible, but only in metrics that have shell crossings\nsomewhere, while metrics that can be made free of shell crossings only permit\nrotations. The quasi planar metrics ($\\epsilon = 0$) either have no Killing\nvectors or they admit full planar symmetry. Single symmetries in quasi\nspherical metrics ($\\epsilon = +1$) are all rotations. The rotations correspond\nto a known family of axially symmetric metrics, which for each $\\epsilon$\nvalue, are equivalent to each other. We consider Szekeres metrics in which the\nline of dipole extrema is required to be geodesic in the 3-space, and show the\nsame set of families emerges. We investigate when two Szekeres metrics are\nphysically equivalent, and complete a previous list of transformations of the\narbitrary functions.\n", "  We extend our work on entanglement propagation following a local quench in\n2+1 dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We find that entanglement\npropagates along an emergent lightcone, whose speed of propagation $v_E$ seems\ndistinct from other measures of quantum information spreading. We compare the\nrelations we find to information and hydrodynamic velocities in strongly\ncoupled 2+1 dimensional theories. While early-time entanglement velocities\ncorresponding to small entangling regions are numerically close to the\nbutterfly velocity, late-time entanglement velocities for large regions show\nless regularity. We also generalize and extend our previous results regarding\nthe late-time decay of the entanglement entropy back to its equilibrium value.\n", "  We study the amplification of the electromagnetic fluctuations, and the\nproduction of \"seeds\" for the cosmic magnetic fields, in a class of string\ncosmology models whose scalar and tensor perturbations reproduce current\nobservations and satisfy known phenomenological constraints. We find that the\ncondition of efficient seeds production can be satisfied and compatible with\nall constraints only in a restricted region of parameter space, but we show\nthat such a region has significant intersections with the portions of parameter\nspace where the produced background of relic gravitational waves is strong\nenough to be detectable by aLIGO/Virgo and/or by eLISA.\n", "  Group sunspot number (GSN) series constitute the longest instrumental\nastronomical database providing information on solar activity. It is a\ncompilation of observations by many individual observers, and their\ninter-calibration has usually been performed using linear rescaling. There are\nmultiple published series that show different long-term trends for solar\nactivity. We aim at producing a GSN series, with a non-linear non-parametric\ncalibration. The only underlying assumptions are that the differences between\nthe various series are due to different acuity thresholds of the observers, and\nthat the threshold of each observer remains constant throughout the observing\nperiod. We use a daisy chain process with backbone (BB) observers and calibrate\nall overlapping observers to them. The calibration of each individual observer\nis performed with a probability distribution function (PDF) matrix, constructed\nconsidering all daily values for the overlapping period with the BB. The\ncalibration of the BBs is done in a similar manner. Propagation of errors is\nmodelled with Monte Carlo simulations. The final series extends back to 1739\nand includes data from 314 observers. It suggests moderate activity during the\n18th and 19th century, which is significantly lower than the high level of\nsolar activity predicted by other recent reconstructions applying linear\nregressions. The new series provides a robust reconstruction, based on modern\nand non-parametric methods, of sunspot group numbers since 1739, and it\nconfirms the existence of the Modern grand maximum of solar activity in the\nsecond half of the 20th century.\n", "  Understanding how quantum resources can be quantified and distributed over\nmany parties has profound applications in quantum communication. As one of the\nmost intriguing features of quantum mechanics, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nsteering is a useful resource for secure quantum networks. By reconstructing\nthe covariance matrix of a continuous variable four-mode square Gaussian\ncluster state subject to asymmetric loss, we quantify the amount of bipartite\nsteering with a variable number of modes per party, and verify recently\nintroduced monogamy relations for Gaussian steerability, which establish\nquantitative constraints on the security of information shared among different\nparties. We observe a very rich structure for the steering distribution, and\ndemonstrate one-way EPR steering of the cluster state under Gaussian\nmeasurements, as well as one-to-multi-mode steering. Our experiment paves the\nway for exploiting EPR steering in Gaussian cluster states as a valuable\nresource for multiparty quantum information tasks.\n", "  Using density functional theory combined with orbital-selective band\nunfolding techniques, we study the effective band structure of\nsilicene($3\\times3$)/Ag(111)($4\\times4$) structure. Consistent with the ARPES\nspectra recently obtained by Feng et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 113, 14656\n(2016)], we observe six pairs of Dirac cones near the boundary of the Brillouin\nzone (BZ) of Ag($1\\times1$), while no Dirac cone is observed inside the BZ.\nFurthermore, we find that these Dirac cones are induced by the interfacial\nSi-Ag hybridization, mainly composed of Si p$_z$ orbitals and Ag sp bands,\nwhich is intrinsically different from the Dirac cones in freestanding silicene.\n", "  Cross-section distributions are calculated for the reaction $e^+ e^-\n\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\bar{\\Lambda}(\\rightarrow \\bar{p}\\pi^+)\n\\Lambda(\\rightarrow p\\pi^-)$, and related annihilation reactions mediated by\nvector mesons. The hyperon-decay distributions depend on a number of structure\nfunctions that are bilinear in the, possibly complex, psionic form factors\n$G_M^\\psi$ and $G_E^\\psi$ of the Lambda hyperon. The relative size and relative\nphase of these form factors can be uniquely determined from the unpolarized\njoint-decay distributions of the Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons. Also the\ndecay-asymmetry parameters of Lambda and anti-Lambda hyperons can be\ndetermined.\n", "  The derivative coupling of baryonic current to the curvature scalar in\ngravitational baryogenesis scenarios leads to higher order equations for\ngravitational field. It is shown that these equations are strongly unstable and\ndestroy standard cosmology. This is a generalization of our earlier results\nobtained for scalar baryons to realistic fermions.\n", "  We revisit the study of the phenomenology associated to a burst of particle\nproduction of a field whose mass is controlled by the inflaton field and\nvanishes at one given instance during inflation. This generates a bump in the\ncorrelators of the primordial scalar curvature. We provide a unified formalism\nto compute various effects that have been obtained in the literature and\nconfirm that the dominant effects are due to the rescattering of the produced\nparticles on the inflaton condensate. We improve over existing results (based\non numerical fits) by providing exact analytic expressions for the shape and\nheight of the bump, both in the power spectrum and the equilateral bispectrum.\nWe then study the regime of validity of the perturbative computations of this\nsignature. Finally, we extend these computations to the case of a burst of\nparticle production in a sector coupled only gravitationally to the inflaton.\n", "  The Kepler space telescope has provided time series of red giants of such\nunprecedented quality that a detailed asteroseismic analysis becomes possible.\nFor a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation\nfrequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation\ncodes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The\nresults so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the\nrotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus\nindicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at\nwork. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13\nlow-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first\nnominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied\npreviously Corsaro et al. 2015, which not only have a large number of extracted\noscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications We aim to\nextend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by\ntheoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive\nthe rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these\nmethods with each other. We built seismic models using a grid search combined\nwith a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing\nBayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those\nobtained using a previously developed model-independent method. We find that\nthe cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster\nthan their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation\nrates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets,\nwhile some discrepancies exist for others.\n", "  Stochastic exponential growth is observed in a variety of contexts, including\nmolecular autocatalysis, nuclear fission, population growth, inflation of the\nuniverse, viral social media posts, and financial markets. Yet literature on\nmodeling the phenomenology of these stochastic dynamics has predominantly\nfocused on one model, Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which can be described\nas the solution of a Langevin equation with linear drift and linear\nmultiplicative noise. Using recent experimental results on stochastic\nexponential growth of individual bacterial cell sizes, we motivate the need for\na more general class of phenomenological models of stochastic exponential\ngrowth, which are consistent with the observation that the mean-rescaled\ndistributions are approximately stationary at long times. We show that this\nbehavior is not consistent with GBM, instead it is consistent with power law\nmultiplicative noise with positive fractional powers. Therefore, we consider\nthis general class of phenomenological models for stochastic exponential\ngrowth, provide analytical solutions, and identify the important dimensionless\ncombination of model parameters which determines the shape of the mean-rescaled\ndistribution. We also provide a prescription for robustly inferring model\nparameters from experimentally observed stochastic growth trajectories.\n", "  We consider the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of a nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) model incorporating linear and nonlinear gain/loss. First,\nwe describe analytically the dynamical regimes (depending on the gain/loss\nstrengths), for finite-time collapse, decay, and global existence of solutions\nin the dynamics. Then, for all the above parametric regimes, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to study the dynamics corresponding to algebraically\ndecaying initial data. We identify crucial differences between the dynamics of\nvanishing initial conditions, and those converging to a finite constant\nbackground: in the former (latter) case we find strong (weak) collapse or\ndecay, when the gain/loss parameters are selected from the relevant regimes.\nOne of our main results, is that in all the above regimes, non-vanishing\ninitial data transition through spatiotemporal, algebraically decaying\nwaveforms. While the system is nonintegrable, the evolution of these waveforms\nis reminiscent to the evolution of the Peregrine rogue wave of the integrable\nNLS limit. The parametric range of gain and loss for which this phenomenology\npersists is also touched upon.\n", "  We study giant molecular cloud (GMC) collisions and their ability to trigger\nstar cluster formation. We further develop our three dimensional magnetized,\nturbulent, colliding GMC simulations by implementing star formation sub-grid\nmodels. Two such models are explored: (1) \"Density-Regulated,\" i.e., fixed\nefficiency per free-fall time above a set density threshold; (2)\n\"Magnetically-Regulated,\" i.e., fixed efficiency per free-fall time in regions\nthat are magnetically supercritical. Variations of parameters associated with\nthese models are also explored. In the non-colliding simulations, the overall\nlevel of star formation is sensitive to model parameter choices that relate to\neffective density thresholds. In the GMC collision simulations, the final star\nformation rates and efficiencies are relatively independent of these\nparameters. Between non-colliding and colliding cases, we compare the\nmorphologies of the resulting star clusters, properties of star-forming gas,\ntime evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), spatial clustering of the\nstars, and resulting kinematics of the stars in comparison to the natal gas. We\nfind that typical collisions, by creating larger amounts of dense gas, trigger\nearlier and enhanced star formation, resulting in 10 times higher SFRs and\nefficiencies. The star clusters formed from GMC collisions show greater spatial\nsub-structure and more disturbed kinematics.\n", "  Current-induced spin polarization in a two-dimensional electron gas with\nRashba spin-orbit interaction is considered theoretically in terms of the\nMatsubara Green functions. This formalism allows to describe temperature\ndependence of the induced spin polarization. The electron gas is assumed to be\ncoupled to a magnetic substrate via exchange interaction. Analytical and\nnumerical results on the temperature dependence of spin polarization have been\nobtained in the linear response regime. The spin polarization has been\npresented as a sum of two terms - one proportional to the relaxation time and\nthe other related to the Berry phase corresponding to the electronic bands of\nthe magnetized Rashba gas. The spin-orbit torque due to Rashba interaction is\nalso discussed. Such a torque appears as a result of the exchange coupling\nbetween the non-equilibrium spin polarization and magnetic moment of the\nunderlayer.\n", "  Particles with a sub-millimeter decay length appear in many models of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. However, their longevity has been often ignored in\ntheir LHC searches and they have been regarded as promptly-decaying particles.\nIn this letter, we show that, by requiring displaced vertices on top of the\nevent selection criteria used in the ordinary search strategies for\npromptly-decaying particles, we can considerably extend the LHC reach for\nparticles with a decay length of $\\gtrsim 100~\\mu{\\rm m}$. We discuss a way of\nreconstructing sub-millimeter displaced vertices by exploiting the same\ntechnique used for the primary vertex reconstruction on the assumption that the\nmetastable particles are always pair-produced and their decay products contain\nhigh-$p_{\\rm T}$ jets. We show that, by applying a cut based on displaced\nvertices on top of standard kinematical cuts for the search of new particles,\nthe LHC reach can be significantly extended if the decay length is $\\gtrsim\n100~\\mu{\\rm m}$. In addition, we may measure the lifetime of the target\nparticle through the reconstruction of displaced vertices, which plays an\nimportant role in understanding the new physics behind the metastable\nparticles.\n", "  A quantum particle transport induced in a spatially-periodic potential by a\npropagating plane wave has a number important implications in a range of\ntopical physical systems. Examples include acoustically driven semiconductor\nsuperlattices and cold atoms in optical crystal. Here we apply kinetic\ndescription of the directed transport in a superlattice beyond standard linear\napproximation, and utilize exact path-integral solutions of the semiclassical\ntransport equation. We show that the particle drift and average velocities have\nnon-monotonic dependence on the wave amplitude with several prominent extrema.\nSuch nontrivial kinetic behaviour is related to global bifurcations developing\nwith an increase of the wave amplitude. They cause dramatic transformations of\nthe system phase space and lead to changes of the transport regime. We describe\ndifferent types of phase trajectories contributing to the directed transport\nand analyse their spectral content.\n", "  We propose a unique stellar model under the $f(R,\\mathcal{T})$ gravity by\nusing the conjecture of Mazur-Mottola [P. Mazur and E. Mottola, Report number:\nLA-UR-01-5067., P. Mazur and E. Mottola, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101, 9545\n(2004)] which is known as gravastar and a viable alternative to the black hole\nas available in literature. This gravastar is described by the three different\nregions, viz., (I) Interior core region, (II) Intermediate thin shell, and\n(III) Exterior spherical region. The pressure within the interior region is\nequal to the constant negative matter density which provides a repulsive force\nover the thin spherical shell. This thin shell is assumed to be formed by a\nfluid of ultra relativistic plasma and the pressure, which is directly\nproportional to the matter-energy density according to Zel'dovich's conjecture\nof stiff fluid [Y.B. Zel'dovich, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 160, 1 (1972)], does\ncounter balance the repulsive force exerted by the interior core region. The\nexterior spherical region is completely vacuum and assumed to be de Sitter\nspacetime which can be described by the Schwarzschild solution. Under this\nspecification we find out a set of exact and singularity-free solution of the\ncollapsing star which presents several other physically valid features within\nthe framework of alternative gravity.\n", "  Adding an extra singlet scalar $S$ to the Higgs sector can provide a barrier\nat tree level between a false vacuum with restored electroweak symmetry and the\ntrue one. This has been demonstrated to readily give a strong phase transition\nas required for electroweak baryogenesis. We show that with the addition of a\nfermionic dark matter particle $\\chi$ coupling to $S$, a simple UV-complete\nmodel can realize successful electroweak baryogenesis. The dark matter gets a\nCP asymmetry that is transferred to the standard model through a $CP\\ portal\\\ninteraction$, which we take to be a coupling of $\\chi$ to $\\tau$ leptons and an\ninert Higgs doublet. The CP asymmetry induced in left-handed $\\tau$ leptons\nbiases sphalerons to produce the baryon asymmetry. The model has promising\ndiscovery potential at the LHC, while robustly providing a large enough baryon\nasymmetry and correct dark matter relic density with reasonable values of the\ncouplings.\n", "  The Hubble Catalog of Variables (HCV) is a 3 year ESA funded project that\naims to develop a set of algorithms to identify variables among the sources\nincluded in the Hubble Source Catalog (HSC) and produce the HCV. We will\nprocess all HSC sources with more than a predefined number of measurements in a\nsingle filter/instrument combination and compute a range of lightcurve features\nto determine the variability status of each source. At the end of the project,\nthe first release of the Hubble Catalog of Variables will be made available at\nthe Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) and the ESA Science Archives.\nThe variability detection pipeline will be implemented at the Space Telescope\nScience Institute (STScI) so that updated versions of the HCV may be created\nfollowing the future releases of the HSC.\n", "  The field of visible-light continuous time series photometry is now at its\ngolden age, manifested by the continuum of past (CoRoT, Kepler), present (K2),\nand future (TESS, PLATO) space-based surveys delivering high precision data\nwith a long baseline for a large number of stars. The availability of the high\nquality data has enabled astrophysical studies not possible before, including\nfor example detailed asteroseismic investigations and the study of the\nexoplanet census including small planets. This has also allowed to study the\nminute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries\nand star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on\nsystems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small\nstar to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination\nof gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal\nellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the\nphase curve shape contains information about the companion's mass and\natmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool.\nFor example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of\nshort-period low-mass companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars, out of reach\nof other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is\nusing the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which\ncomprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems. We discuss the\nscience done with phase curves, the first results obtained so far, and the\ncurrent difficulties and open questions related to this young and evolving\nsubfield.\n", "  The appearance of a Nano-jet in the micro-sphere optical experiments is\nanalyzed by relating this effect to non-diffracting Bessel beams. By inserting\na circular aperture with a radius which is in the order of subwavelength in the\nEM waist, and sending the transmitted light into a confocal microscope, EM\nfluctuations by the different Bessel beams are avoided. On this constant EM\nfield evanescent waves are superposed. While this effect improves the\noptical-depth of the imaging process, the object fine-structures are obtained,\nfrom the modulation of the EM fields by the evanescent waves. The use of a\ncombination of the micro-sphere optical system with an interferometer for phase\ncontrast measurements is described.\n", "  This paper presents an architecture of high-resolution delay generator\nimplemented in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip by exploiting\nthe method of utilizing dedicated carry chains. It serves as the core component\nin various physical instruments. The proposed delay generator contains the\ncoarse delay step and the fine delay step to guarantee both large dynamic range\nand high resolution. The carry chains are organized in the Vernier delay loop\nstyle to fulfill the fine delay step with high precision and high linearity.\nThe delay generator was implemented in the EP3SE110F1152I3 Stratix III device\nfrom Altera on a self-designed test board. Test results show the obtained\nresolution is 38.6 ps, and the differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral\nnonlinearity (INL) is in the range of (-0.18 least significant bit (LSB),0.24\nLSB)\\(-0.02 LSB,0.01 LSB) under the nominal supply voltage of 1100 mV and\nenvironmental temperature of 20 degrees centigrade. The delay generator is also\nrather resource cost efficient which uses only 668 LUTs and 146 registers in\ntotal.\n", "  Precision measurements of ultra-small linear velocities of one of the mirrors\nin a Michelson interferometer are performed using two different weak-values\ntechniques. We show that the technique of Almost-Balanced Weak Values (ABWV)\noffers practical advantages over the technique of Weak-Value Amplification\n(WVA), resulting in larger signal-to-noise ratios and the possibility of longer\nintegration times due to robustness to slow drifts. As an example of the\nperformance of the ABWV protocol we report a velocity sensitivity of 60 fm/s\nafter 40 hours of integration time. The sensitivity of the Doppler shift due to\nthe moving mirror is of 150 nHz.\n", "  We report on numerical simulations of simple models of athermal, bidisperse,\nsoft-core, massive disks in two dimensions, as a function of packing fraction\n$\\phi$, inelasticity of collisions as measured by a parameter $Q$, and applied\nuniform shear strain rate $\\dot\\gamma$. Our particles have contact interactions\nconsisting of normally directed elastic repulsion and viscous dissipation, as\nwell as tangentially directed viscous dissipation, but no inter-particle\nCoulombic friction. Mapping the phase diagram in the $(\\phi,Q)$ plane for small\n$\\dot\\gamma$, we find a sharp first-order rheological phase transition from a\nregion with Bagnoldian rheology to a region with Newtonian rheology, and show\nthat the system is always Newtonian at jamming. We consider the rotational\nmotion of particles and demonstrate the crucial importance that the coupling\nbetween rotational and translational degrees of freedom has on the phase\nstructure at small $Q$ (strongly inelastic collisions). At small $Q$ we show\nthat, upon increasing $\\dot\\gamma$, the sharp Bagnoldian-to-Newtonian\ntransition becomes a coexistence region of finite width in the\n$(\\phi,\\dot\\gamma)$ plane, with coexisting Bagnoldian and Newtonian shear\nbands. Crossing this coexistence region by increasing $\\dot\\gamma$ at fixed\n$\\phi$, we find that discontinuous shear thickening can result if $\\dot\\gamma$\nis varied too rapidly for the system to relax to the shear-banded steady state\ncorresponding to the instantaneous value of $\\dot\\gamma$.\n", "  We characterize the ability of the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to perform\nrelative astrometry across its 500~Mpix, 3 deg^2 science field of view, and\nacross 4 years of operation. This is done using internal comparisons of ~4x10^7\nmeasurements of high-S/N stellar images obtained in repeat visits to fields of\nmoderate stellar density, with the telescope dithered to move the sources\naround the array. An empirical astrometric model includes terms for: optical\ndistortions; stray electric fields in the CCD detectors; chromatic terms in the\ninstrumental and atmospheric optics; shifts in CCD relative positions of up to\n~10 um when the DECam temperature cycles; and low-order distortions to each\nexposure from changes in atmospheric refraction and telescope alignment. Errors\nin this astrometric model are dominated by stochastic variations with typical\namplitudes of 10-30 mas (in a 30 s exposure) and 5-10 arcmin coherence length,\nplausibly attributed to Kolmogorov-spectrum atmospheric turbulence. The size of\nthese atmospheric distortions is not closely related to the seeing. Given an\nastrometric reference catalog at density ~0.7 arcmin^{-2}, e.g. from Gaia, the\ntypical atmospheric distortions can be interpolated to 7 mas RMS accuracy (for\n30 s exposures) with 1 arcmin coherence length for residual errors. Remaining\ndetectable error contributors are 2-4 mas RMS from unmodelled stray electric\nfields in the devices, and another 2-4 mas RMS from focal plane shifts between\ncamera thermal cycles. Thus the astrometric solution for a single DECam\nexposure is accurate to 3-6 mas (0.02 pixels, or 300 nm) on the focal plane,\nplus the stochastic atmospheric distortion.\n", "  We construct a candidate for the most general chiral higher spin theory with\nAdS$_3$ boundary conditions. In the Chern-Simons language, on the left it has\nthe Drinfeld-Sokolov reduced form, but on the right all charges and chemical\npotentials are turned on. Altogether (for the spin-3 case) these are $19$\nfunctions. Despite this, we show that the resulting metric has the form of the\n\"most general\" AdS$_3$ boundary conditions discussed by Grumiller and Riegler.\nThe asymptotic symmetry algebra is a product of a $\\mathcal{W}_3$ algebra on\nthe left and an affine $sl(3)_k$ current algebra on the right, as desired. The\nmetric and higher spin fields depend on all the $19$ functions. We compare our\nwork with previous results in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state properties of the XXZ model with\n$1/r^{\\alpha}$ interactions, describing spins interacting with long-range (LR)\ntransverse (XX) ferromagnetic interactions and longitudinal (Z)\nantiferromagnetic interactions, or hardcore bosons with LR repulsion and\nhopping. The LR nature of the couplings allows us to quantitatively study the\nspectral, correlation and entanglement properties of the system by making use\nof linear spin-wave theory, supplemented with density-matrix renormalization\ngroup in one-dimensional systems. Our most important prediction is the\nexistence of three distinct coupling regimes, depending on the decay exponent\n$\\alpha$ and number of dimensions $d$: 1) a short-range regime for $\\alpha > d\n+ \\sigma_c$ (where $\\sigma_c = 1$ in the gapped N\\'eel antiferromagnetic phase\nexhibited by the XXZ model, and $\\sigma_c = 2$ in the gapless XY ferromagnetic\nphase), sharing the same properties as those of finite-range interactions\n($\\alpha=\\infty$); 2) a long-range regime $\\alpha < d$, sharing the same\nproperties as those of the infinite-range interactions ($\\alpha=0$) in the\nthermodynamic limit; and 3) a most intriguing medium-range regime for $d <\n\\alpha < d+\\sigma_c$, continuously interpolating between the finite-range and\nthe infinite-range behavior. The latter regime is characterized by elementary\nexcitations with a long-wavelength dispersion relation $\\omega \\approx \\Delta_g\n+ ck^z$ in the gapped phase, and $\\omega \\sim k^z$ in the gapless phase,\nexhibiting a continuously varying dynamical exponent $z = (\\alpha - d) /\n\\sigma_c$. In the gapless phase of the model the $z$ exponent is found to\ncontrol the scaling of fluctuations, the decay of correlations, and a universal\nsub-dominant term in the entanglement entropy, leading to a very rich palette\nof behaviors for ground-state quantum correlations beyond what is known for\nfinite-range interactions.\n", "  The need for accurate photometric redshifts estimation is a topic that has\nfundamental importance in Astronomy, due to the necessity of efficiently\nobtaining redshift information without the need of spectroscopic analysis. We\npropose a method for determining accurate multimodal photo-z probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) using Mixture Density Networks (MDN) and Deep\nConvolutional Networks (DCN). A comparison with a Random Forest (RF) is\nperformed.\n", "  We present METAPHOR (Machine-learning Estimation Tool for Accurate\nPHOtometric Redshifts), a method able to provide a reliable PDF for photometric\ngalaxy redshifts estimated through empirical techniques. METAPHOR is a modular\nworkflow, mainly based on the MLPQNA neural network as internal engine to\nderive photometric galaxy redshifts, but giving the possibility to easily\nreplace MLPQNA with any other method to predict photo-z's and their PDF. We\npresent here the results about a validation test of the workflow on the\ngalaxies from SDSS-DR9, showing also the universality of the method by\nreplacing MLPQNA with KNN and Random Forest models. The validation test include\nalso a comparison with the PDF's derived from a traditional SED template\nfitting method (Le Phare).\n", "  The discovery that the centaur (10199) Chariklo possesses a ring system opens\nquestions about their origin. We here asses the plausibility of different\nscenarios for the origin of the observed ring system. We first consider the\npossibility that the material of the ring originated in the disruption of a\nsatellite that had reached a critical distance from the centaur. We discuss the\nconditions for the putative satellite to approach the centaur as a consequence\nof tidal interaction. A three-body encounter is also considered as a transport\nmechanism. In addition, we study the case in which the ring is formed by the\nejecta of a cratering collision on the centaur and we constrain the collision\nparameters and the size of the resulting crater of the event. Finally, we\nconsider that the ring material originates from a catastrophic collision\nbetween a background object and a satellite located at a distance corresponding\nto the the current location of the ring. We compute the typical timescales for\nthese scenarios. We estimate that in order to be tidally disrupted a satellite\nwould have had to be larger than approximately 6.5 km at the location of the\nrings. However the tidal interaction is rather weak for objects of the size of\nouter solar system bodies at the ring location, therefore we considered other\nmore effective mechanisms by which a satellite migt have approached the\ncentaur. Collisonal scenarios are both physically plausible for the formation,\nbut semianalytical estimations indicate that the probability of the\ncorresponding collisions is low under current conditions\n", "  We study the generation of planar quantum squeezed (PQS) states by quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) measurement of a cold ensemble of $^{87}$Rb atoms. Precise\ncalibration of the QND measurement allows us to infer the conditional\ncovariance matrix describing the $F_y$ and $F_z$ components of the PQS,\nrevealing the dual squeezing characteristic of PQS. PQS states have been\nproposed for single-shot phase estimation without prior knowledge of the likely\nvalues of the phase. We show that for an arbitrary phase, the generated PQS\ngives a metrological advantage of at least 3.1 dB relative to classical states.\nThe PQS also beats traditional squeezed states generated with the same QND\nresources, except for a narrow range of phase values. Using spin squeezing\ninequalities, we show that spin-spin entanglement is responsible for the\nmetrological advantage.\n", "  In the current data-driven science era, it is needed that data analysis\ntechniques has to quickly evolve to face with data whose dimensions has\nincreased up to the Petabyte scale. In particular, being modern astrophysics\nbased on multi-wavelength data organized into large catalogues, it is crucial\nthat the astronomical catalog cross-matching methods, strongly dependant from\nthe catalogues size, must ensure efficiency, reliability and scalability.\nFurthermore, multi-band data are archived and reduced in different ways, so\nthat the resulting catalogues may differ each other in formats, resolution,\ndata structure, etc, thus requiring the highest generality of cross-matching\nfeatures. We present $C^{3}$ (Command-line Catalogue Cross-match), a\nmulti-platform application designed to efficiently cross-match massive\ncatalogues from modern surveys. Conceived as a stand-alone command-line process\nor a module within generic data reduction/analysis pipeline, it provides the\nmaximum flexibility, in terms of portability, configuration, coordinates and\ncross-matching types, ensuring high performance capabilities by using a\nmulti-core parallel processing paradigm and a sky partitioning algorithm.\n", "  We study plasmonic excitations in the limit of few electrons, in one-atom\nthick sodium chains, and characterize them based on collectivity. We also\ncompare the excitations to classical localised plasmon modes and find for the\nlongitudinal mode a quantum-classical transition around 10 atoms. The\ntransverse mode appears at much higher energies than predicted classically for\nall chain lengths. The electric field enhancement is also considered which is\nmade possible by considering the effects of electron-phonon coupling on the\nbroadening of the electronic spectra. Large field enhancements are possible on\nthe molecular level allowing us to consider the validity of using molecules as\nthe ultimate small size limit of plasmonic antennas. Additionally, we consider\nthe case of a dimer system of two sodium chains, where the gap can be\nconsidered as a picocavity, and we analyse the charge-transfer states and their\ndependence on the gap size as well as chain size. Our results and methods are\nuseful for understanding and developing ultra-small, tunable and novel\nplasmonic devices that utilise quantum effects that could have applications in\nquantum optics, quantum metamaterials, cavity-quantum electrodynamics and\ncontrolling chemical reactions, as well as deepening our understanding of\nlocalised plasmons in low dimensional molecular systems.\n", "  We explore the interplay between tunneling and interatomic interactions in\nthe dynamics of a bosonic Josephson junction. We tune the scattering length of\nan atomic $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a double-well trap to\ninvestigate regimes inaccessible to other superconducting or superfluid\nsystems. In the limit of small-amplitude oscillations, we study the transition\nfrom Rabi to plasma oscillations by crossing over from attractive to repulsive\ninteratomic interactions. We observe a critical slowing down in the oscillation\nfrequency by increasing the strength of an attractive interaction up to the\npoint of a quantum phase transition. With sufficiently large initial\noscillation amplitude and repulsive interactions the system enters the\nmacroscopic quantum self-trapping regime, where we observe coherent undamped\noscillations with a self-sustained average imbalance of the relative well\npopulation. The exquisite agreement between theory and experiments enables the\nobservation of a broad range of many body coherent dynamical regimes driven by\ntunable tunneling energy, interactions and external forces, with applications\nspanning from atomtronics to quantum metrology.\n", "  In the context of dissipative systems, we show that for any quantum chaotic\nattractor a corre- sponding classical chaotic attractor can always be found. We\nprovide with a general way to locate them, rooted in the structure of the\nparameter space (which is typically bidimensional, accounting for the forcing\nstrength and dissipation parameters). In the cases where an approximate point\nlike quantum distribution is found, it can be associated to exceptionally large\nregular structures. Moreover, supposedly anomalous quantum chaotic behaviour\ncan be very well reproduced by the classical dynamics plus Gaussian noise of\nthe size of an effective Planck constant $\\hbar_{\\rm eff}$. We give support to\nour conjectures by means of two paradigmatic examples of quantum chaos and\ntransport theory. In particular, a dissipative driven system becomes\nfundamental in order to extend their validity to generic cases.\n", "  This paper presents the sharpest near-IR images of the massive cluster R136\nto date, based on the extreme adaptive optics of the SPHERE focal instrument\nimplemented on the ESO/VLT and operated in its IRDIS imaging mode. Stacking-up\na few hundreds of short exposures in J and Ks spectral bands over a FoV of\n10.9\"x12.3\" centered on the R136a1 stellar component, enabled us to carry a\nrefined photometric analysis of the core of R136. We detected 1110 and 1059\nsources in J and Ks images respectively with 818 common sources. Thanks to\nbetter angular resolution and dynamic range, we found that more than 62.6%\n(16.5%) of the stars, detected both in J and Ks data, have neighbours closer\nthan 0.2\" (0.1\"). Among resolved and detected sources R136a1 and R136c have\nvisual companions and R136a3 is resolved as two stars separated by 59mas. The\nnew set of detected sources were used to re-assess the age and extinction of\nR136 based on 54 spectroscopically stars that have been recently studied with\nHST slit-spectroscopy. Over 90% of these 54 sources identified visual\ncompanions (closer than 0.2\"). We found the most probable age and extinction\nfor these sources within the photometric and spectroscopic error-bars.\nAdditionally, using PARSEC evolutionary isochrones and tracks, we estimated the\nstellar mass range for each detected source (common in J and K data) and\nplotted the generalized histogram of mass (MF with error-bars). Using SPHERE\ndata, we have gone one step further and partially resolved and studied the IMF\ncovering mass range of (3-300) Msun at the age of 1 and 1.5 Myr. The density in\nthe core of R136 is estimated and extrapolated in 3D and larger radii (up to\n6pc). We show that the stars in the core are still unresolved due to crowding,\nand the results we obtained are upper limits. Higher angular resolution is\nmandatory to overcome these difficulties.\n", "  The order parameter of bulk two-dimensional superconductors is classified as\nnodal, if it vanishes for a direction in momentum space, or gapful if it does\nnot. Each class can be topologically nontrivial if Andreev bound states are\nformed at the edges of the superconductor. Non-magnetic impurities in the\nsuperconductor affect the formation of Andreev bound states and can drastically\nchange the tunneling spectra for small voltages. Here, we investigate the mean\ncurrent and its fluctuations for two-dimensional tunnel junctions between a\nnormal-metal and unconventional superconductors by solving the quasi-classical\nEilenberger equation self-consistently, including the presence of non-magnetic\nimpurities in the superconductor. As the impurity strength increases, we find\nthat superconductivity is suppressed for almost all order parameters since (i)\nat zero applied bias, the effective transferred charge calculated from the\nnoise-current ratio tends to the electron charge $e$ and (ii) for finite bias,\nthe current-voltage characteristics follows that of a normal state junction.\nThere are notable exceptions to this trend. First, gapful nontrivial (chiral)\nsuperconductors are very robust against impurity scattering due to the linear\ndispersion relation of their surface Andreev bound states. Second, for nodal\nnontrivial superconductors, only p_x-wave pairing is almost immune to the\npresence of impurities due to the emergence of odd-frequency s-wave Cooper\npairs near the interface. Owing to their anisotropic dependence on the wave\nvector, impurity scattering is an effective pair breaking mechanism for the\nrest of nodal superconductors. All these behaviors are neatly captured by the\nnoise-current ratio, providing a useful guide to find experimental signatures\nfor unconventional superconductivity.\n", "  The fast radio bursts (FRBs) 110220 and 140514 were detected at telescope\npointing locations within 9 arcmin of each other over three years apart, both\nwithin the same 14.4 arcmin beam of the Parkes radio telescope. Nevertheless,\nthey generally have not been considered to be from the same source because of a\nvastly different dispersion measure (DM) for the two bursts by over $380\\,{\\rm\npc\\,cm^{-3}}$. Here we consider the hypothesis that these two FRBs are from the\nsame neutron star embedded within a supernova remnant (SNR) that provides an\nevolving DM as the ejecta expands and becomes more diffuse. Using such a model\nand the observed DM change, it can be argued that the corresponding SN must\nhave occurred within $\\approx10.2$ years of FRB 110220. Furthermore,\nconstraints can be placed on the SN ejecta mass and explosion energy, which\nappear to require a stripped envelope (Type Ib/c) SN and/or a very energetic\nexplosion. A third FRB from this location would be even more constraining,\nallowing the component of the DM due to the SNR to be separated from the\nunchanging DM components due to the host galaxy and intergalactic medium. In\nthe future, if more FRBs are found to repeat, the sort of arguments presented\nhere can be used to test the young neutron star progenitor hypothesis for FRBs.\n", "  Measurements of quantum systems can be used to generate classical data that\nis truly unpredictable for every observer. However, this true randomness needs\nto be discriminated from randomness due to ignorance or lack of control of the\ndevices. We analyze the randomness gain of a measurement-device-independent\nsetup, consisting of a well-characterized source of quantum states and a\ncompletely uncharacterized and untrusted detector. Our framework generalizes\nprevious schemes as arbitrary input states and arbitrary measurements can be\nanalyzed. Our method is used to suggest simple and realistic implementations\nthat yield high randomness generation rates of more than one random bit per\nqubit for detectors of sufficient quality.\n", "  We have investigated the global dynamical state of the Integral Shaped\nFilament in the Orion A cloud using new N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) large-scale, IRAM30m\nobservations. Our analysis of its internal gas dynamics reveals the presence of\naccelerated motions towards the Orion Nebula Cluster, showing a characteristic\nblue-shifted profile centred at the position of the OMC-1 South region. The\nproperties of these observed gas motions (profile, extension, and magnitude)\nare consistent with the expected accelerations for the gravitational collapse\nof the OMC-1 region and explain both the physical and kinematic structure of\nthis cloud.\n", "  We observe variation in the resistively-detected nuclear magnetic resonance\n(RDNMR) lineshapes in quantum Hall breakdown. The breakdown is locally occurred\nin a gate-defined quantum point contact (QPC) region. Of particular interest is\nthe observation of a dispersive lineshape occured when the bulk 2D electron gas\n(2DEG) is set to $\\nu_{\\rm{b}} = 2$ and the QPC filling factor to the vicinity\nof $\\nu_{\\rm{QPC}} = 1$, strikingly resemble the dispersive lineshape observed\non a 2D quantum Hall state. This previously unobserved lineshape in a QPC\npoints to simultaneous occurrence of two hyperfine-mediated spin flip-flop\nprocesses within the QPC. Those events give rise to two different sets of\nnuclei polarized in the opposite direction and positioned at a separate region\nwith different degree of electronic polarizations.\n", "  By applying Berry-phase theory for the effective half-filled Hubbard model,\nwe derive an analytical expression for the electronic polarization driven by\nthe relativistic spin-orbit (SO) coupling. The model itself is constructed in\nthe Wannier basis, using the input from the first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations in the local-density approximation, and then treated in\nthe spirit of the superexchange theory. The obtained polarization has the\nfollowing form: ${\\bf P}_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ji} \\boldsymbol{\\cal\nP}_{ij} \\cdot [\\boldsymbol{e}_i \\times \\boldsymbol{e}_j]$, where\n$\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ji}$ is the direction of the bond $\\langle ij \\rangle$,\n$\\boldsymbol{e}_i$ and $\\boldsymbol{e}_j$ are the directions of spins in this\nbond, and $\\boldsymbol{\\cal P}_{ij}$ is the pseudovector containing all the\ninformation about the crystallographic symmetry of the considered system. The\nexpression describes the ferroelectric activity in various magnets with\nnoncollinear but otherwise nonpolar magnetic structures, which would yield no\npolarization without SO interaction, including the magnetoelectric (ME) effect,\ncaused by the ferromagnetic canting of spins in the external magnetic field,\nand spin-spiral multiferroics. The abilities of this theory are demonstrated\nfor the the analysis of linear ME effect in Cr$_2$O$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$ and\nproperties multiferroic MnWO$_4$ and $\\beta$-MnO$_2$. In all considered\nexamples, the theory perfectly describes the symmetry properties of the induced\npolarization. However, in some cases, the values of this polarization are\nunderestimated, suggesting that other effects, besides the spin and electronic\nones, can also play an important role.\n", "  The 80 high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) pulsars that are known to reside in the\nMagellanic Clouds (MCs) have been observed by the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\ntelescopes on a regular basis for 15 years, and the XMM-Newton and Chandra\narchives contain nearly complete information about the duty cycles of the\nsources with spin periods P_S < 100 s. We have rerprocessed the archival data\nfrom both observatories and we combined the output products with all the\npublished observations of 31 MC pulsars with P_S < 100 s in an attempt to\ninvestigate the faintest X-ray emission states of these objects that occur when\naccretion to the polar caps proceeds at the smallest possible rates. These\nstates determine the so-called propeller lines of the accreting pulsars and\nyield information about the magnitudes of their surface magnetic fields. We\nhave found that the faintest states of the pulsars segregate into five discrete\ngroups which obey to a high degree of accuracy the theoretical relation between\nspin period and X-ray luminosity. So the entire population of these pulsars can\nbe described by just five propeller lines and the five corresponding magnetic\nmoments (0.29, 0.53, 1.2, 2.9, and 7.3, in units of 10^30 G cm^3).\n", "  We study the transport of a single photon in two coupled one-dimensional\nsemi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguides (CRWs), in which both end sides are\ncoupled to a dissipative cavity. We demonstrate that a single photon can\ntransfer from one semi-infinite CRW to the other nonreciprocally. Based on such\nnonreciprocity, we further construct a three-port single-photon circulator by a\nT-shaped waveguide, in which three semi-infinite CRWs are pairwise mutually\ncoupled to each other. The single-photon nonreciprocal transport is induced by\nthe breaking of the time-reversal symmetry and the optimal conditions for these\nphenomena are obtained analytically. The CRWs with broken time-reversal\nsymmetry will open up a kind of quantum devices with versatile applications in\nquantum networks.\n", "  The optical vortex coronagraph (OVC) is one of the promising ways for direct\nimaging exoplanets because of its small inner working angle and high\nthroughput. This paper presents the design and laboratory demonstration\nperformance at 633nm and 1520nm of the OVC based on liquid crystal polymers\n(LCP). Two LCPs has been manufactured in partnership with a commercial vendor.\nThe OVC can deliver a good performance in laboratory test and achieve the\ncontrast of the order 10^-6 at angular distance 3{\\lambda}/D, which is able to\nimage the giant exoplanets at a young stage in combination with extreme\nadaptive optics.\n", "  Star formation from the interstellar medium of galactic disks is a basic\nprocess controlling the evolution of galaxies. Understanding the star formation\nrate in a local patch of a disk with a given gas mass is thus an important\nchallenge for theoretical models. Here we simulate a kiloparsec region of a\ndisk, following the evolution of self-gravitating molecular clouds down to\nsubparsec scales, as they form stars that then inject feedback energy by\ndissociating and ionizing UV photons and supernova explosions. We assess the\nrelative importance of each feedback mechanism. We find that $\\rm\nH_2$-dissociating feedback results in the largest absolute reduction in star\nformation compared to the run with no feedback. Subsequently adding\nphotoionization feedback produces a more modest reduction. Our fiducial models\nthat combine all three feedback mechanisms yield, without fine-tuning, star\nformation rates that are in excellent agreement with observations, with $\\rm\nH_2$-dissociating photons playing a crucial role. Models that only include\nsupernova feedback---a common method in galaxy evolution simulations---settle\nto similar star formation rates, but with very different temperature and\nchemical states of the gas, and with very different spatial distributions of\nyoung stars.\n", "  We present muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR) measurements on the\nnoncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe$_2$. From measurements in an applied\ntransverse field between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, we extract the superfluid\ndensity as a function of temperature in the vortex state. This data can be fit\nwith a fully gapped two-band model, consistent with previous evidence from\nARPES, thermal conductivity, and resistivity. Furthermore, zero field\nmeasurements show no evidence for a time reversal symmetry breaking field\ngreater than 0.05~G in the superconducting state. This makes exotic fully\ngapped spin-triplet states unlikely, and hence we contend that PbTaSe$_2$ is\ncharacterized by conventional BCS s-wave superconductivity in multiple bands.\n", "  We investigate the shifts of the core-level binding energies in small gold\nnanoclusters by using {\\it ab initio} density functional theory calculations.\nThe shift of the 4$f$ states is calculated for magic number nanoclusters in a\nwide range of sizes and morphologies. We find a non-monotonous behavior of the\ncore-level shift in nanoclusters depending on the size. We demonstrate that\nthere are three main contributions to the Au 4$f$ shifts, which depend\nsensitively on the interatomic distances, coordination and quantum confinement.\nThey are identified and explained by the change of the on-site electrostatic\npotential.\n", "  Nowadays there is no field research which is not flooded with data. Among the\nsciences, Astrophysics has always been driven by the analysis of massive\namounts of data. The development of new and more sophisticated observation\nfacilities, both ground-based and spaceborne, has led data more and more\ncomplex (Variety), an exponential growth of both data Volume (i.e., in the\norder of petabytes), and Velocity in terms of production and transmission.\nTherefore, new and advanced processing solutions will be needed to process this\nhuge amount of data. We investigate some of these solutions, based on machine\nlearning models as well as tools and architectures for Big Data analysis that\ncan be exploited in the astrophysical context.\n", "  The generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is a modification of standard\nquantum mechanics due to Planck scale effects. The GUP has recently been used\nto improve the short distance behaviour of classical black hole spacetimes by\ninvoking nonlocal modifications of the gravity action. We present the problem\nof extending such a GUP scenario to higher dimensional spacetimes and we\ncritically review the existing literature on the topic.\n", "  Holographic cosmology offers a novel framework for describing the very early\nUniverse in which cosmological predictions are expressed in terms of the\nobservables of a three dimensional quantum field theory (QFT). This framework\nincludes conventional slow-roll inflation, which is described in terms of a\nstrongly coupled QFT, but it also allows for qualitatively new models for the\nvery early Universe, where the dual QFT may be weakly coupled. The new models\ndescribe a universe which is non-geometric at early times. While standard\nslow-roll inflation leads to a (near-)power-law primordial power spectrum,\nperturbative superrenormalizable QFT's yield a new holographic spectral shape.\nHere, we compare the two predictions against cosmological observations. We use\nCosmoMC to determine the best fit parameters, and MultiNest for Bayesian\nEvidence, comparing the likelihoods. We find that the dual QFT should be\nnon-perturbative at the very low multipoles ($l \\lesssim 30$), while for higher\nmultipoles ($l \\gtrsim 30$) the new holographic model, based on perturbative\nQFT, fits the data just as well as the standard power-law spectrum assumed in\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This finding opens the door to applications of\nnon-perturbative QFT techniques, such as lattice simulations, to observational\ncosmology on gigaparsec scales and beyond.\n", "  R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system consisting of a mira variable, a hot\ncompanion with a spectacular jet outflow, and an extended emission line nebula.\nWe have used R Aqr as test target for the visual camera subsystem ZIMPOL, which\nis part of the new extreme adaptive optics (AO) instrument SPHERE at the Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT).\n  We compare our observations with data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nand illustrate the complementarity of the two instruments. We determine from\nthe Halpha emission the position, size, geometric structure, and line fluxes of\nthe jet source and the clouds in the innermost region (<2\") of R Aqr and\ndetermine Halpha emissivities mean density, mass, recombination time scale, and\nother cloud parameters.\n  Our data resolve for the first time the R Aqr binary and we measure for the\njet source a relative position 46+/-1 mas West of the mira. The central jet\nsource is the strongest Halpha component. North east and south west from the\ncentral source there are many clouds with very diverse structures. We see in\nthe SW a string of bright clouds arranged in a zig-zag pattern and, further\nout, more extended bubbles. In the N and NE we see a bright, very elongated\nfilamentary structure and faint perpendicular \"wisps\" further out. Some jet\nclouds are also detected in the ZIMPOL [OI] and He I filters, as well as in the\nHST line filters for Halpha, [OIII], [NII], and [OI]. We determine jet cloud\nparameters and find a very well defined anti-correlation between cloud density\nand distance to the central binary. Future Halpha observations will provide the\norientation of the orbital plane of the binary and allow detailed\nhydrodynamical investigations of this jet outflow and its interaction with the\nwind of the red giant companion.\n", "  The sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E\\gtrsim10^{19}$ eV) is still\nan open question in astroparticle physics and in the last years some efforts\nwere made to understand its origin. In this work we consider white dwarf\npulsars (WDPs) as possible sources of these ultra energetic particles. If some\nSoft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) are considered\nas white dwarf pulsars, these sources can achieve large electromagnetic\npotentials on its surface and possibly accelerate particle almost of speed of\nlight and with energies $E \\sim 10^{20-21}$ eV. We show that the new scale of\nstar surface magnetic field and size of SGRs/AXPs as very magnetized white\ndwarfs are well described in the Hillas diagram together with the AR Sorpii and\nAE Aquarii white dwarf pulsars recently found. SGRs/AXPs described as magnetars\nare much above the Hillas line and out of it is expected for normal neutron\nstar pulsars.\n", "  It has recently been found that quasinormal modes of asymptotically anti-de\nSitter (AdS) black holes in theories with higher curvature corrections may help\nto describe the regime of intermediate 't Hooft coupling in the dual field\ntheory. Here, we consider quasinormal modes of a scalar field in the background\nof spherical Gauss--Bonnet--anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. In general, the\neigenvalues of wave equations are found here numerically, but at a fixed\nGauss-Bonnet constant $\\alpha = R^2/2$ (where $R$ is the AdS radius), an exact\nsolution of the scalar field equation has been obtained. Remarkably, the purely\nimaginary modes, which are usually appropriate only to some gravitational\nperturbations, were found here even for a test scalar field. These purely\nimaginary modes of the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet theory do not have the\nEinsteinian limits, because their damping rates grow, when $\\alpha$ is\ndecreasing. Thus, these modes are nonperturbative in $\\alpha$. The real\noscillation frequencies of the perturbative branch are linearly related to\ntheir Schwarzschild-AdS limits $Re (\\omega_{GB}) = Re (\\omega_{SAdS}) (1+ K(D)\n(\\alpha/R^2))$, where $D$ is the number of spacetime dimensions. Comparison of\nthe analytical formula with the frequencies found by the shooting method allows\nus to test the latter. In addition, we found exact solutions to the master\nequations for gravitational perturbations at $\\alpha=R^2/2$ and observed that\nfor the scalar type of gravitational perturbations an eikonal instability\ndevelops.\n", "  Our Cycle 0 ALMA observations confirmed that the Boomerang Nebula is the\ncoldest known object in the Universe, with a massive high-speed outflow that\nhas cooled significantly below the cosmic background temperature. Our new CO\n1-0 data reveal heretofore unseen distant regions of this ultra-cold outflow,\nout to $\\gtrsim120,000$ AU. We find that in the ultra-cold outflow, the\nmass-loss rate (dM/dt) increases with radius, similar to its expansion velocity\n($V$) - taking $V\\propto r$, we find $dM/dt \\propto r^{0.9-2.2}$. The mass in\nthe ultra-cold outflow is $\\gtrsim3.3$ Msun, and the Boomerang's main-sequence\nprogenitor mass is $\\gtrsim4$ Msun. Our high angular resolution ($\\sim$0\".3) CO\nJ=3-2 map shows the inner bipolar nebula's precise, highly-collimated shape,\nand a dense central waist of size (FWHM) $\\sim$1740 AU$\\times275$ AU. The\nmolecular gas and the dust as seen in scattered light via optical HST imaging\nshow a detailed correspondence. The waist shows a compact core in thermal dust\nemission at 0.87-3.3 mm, which harbors $(4-7)\\times10^{-4}$ Msun~of very large\n($\\sim$mm-to-cm sized), cold ($\\sim20-30$ K) grains. The central waist\n(assuming its outer regions to be expanding) and fast bipolar outflow have\nexpansion ages of $\\lesssim1925$ yr and $\\le1050$ yr: the \"jet-lag\" (i.e.,\ntorus age minus the fast-outflow age) in the Boomerang supports models in which\nthe primary star interacts directly with a binary companion. We argue that this\ninteraction resulted in a common-envelope configuration while the Boomerang's\nprimary was an RGB or early-AGB star, with the companion finally merging into\nthe primary's core, and ejecting the primary's envelope that now forms the\nultra-cold outflow.\n", "  We present results from daily monitoring of gamma rays in the energy range\n$\\sim0.5$ to $\\sim100$ TeV with the first 17 months of data from the High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Its wide field of view of 2\nsteradians and duty cycle of $>95$% are unique features compared to other TeV\nobservatories that allow us to observe every source that transits over HAWC for\nup to $\\sim6$ hours each sidereal day. This regular sampling yields\nunprecedented light curves from unbiased measurements that are independent of\nseasons or weather conditions. For the Crab Nebula as a reference source we\nfind no variability in the TeV band. Our main focus is the study of the TeV\nblazars Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501. A spectral fit for Mrk 421 yields a\npower law index $\\Gamma=2.21 \\pm0.14_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ and\nan exponential cut-off $E_0=5.4 \\pm 1.1_{\\mathrm{stat}}\\pm 1.0_{\\mathrm{sys}}$\nTeV. For Mrk 501, we find an index $\\Gamma=1.60\\pm 0.30_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm\n0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ and exponential cut-off $E_0=5.7\\pm 1.6_{\\mathrm{stat}}\n\\pm 1.0_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ TeV. The light curves for both sources show clear\nvariability and a Bayesian analysis is applied to identify changes between flux\nstates. The highest per-transit fluxes observed from Mrk 421 exceed the Crab\nNebula flux by a factor of approximately five. For Mrk 501, several transits\nshow fluxes in excess of three times the Crab Nebula flux. In a comparison to\nlower energy gamma-ray and X-ray monitoring data with comparable sampling we\ncannot identify clear counterparts for the most significant flaring features\nobserved by HAWC.\n", "  We study the ultrafast Kerr effect and high-harmonic generation in type-II\nsuperconductors by formulating a new model for a time-varying electromagnetic\npulse normally incident on a thin-film superconductor. It is found that type-II\nsuperconductors exhibit exceptionally large $\\chi^{(3)}$ due to the progressive\ndestruction of Cooper pairs, and display high-harmonic generation at low\nincident intensities, and the highest nonlinear susceptibility of all known\nmaterials in the THz regime. Our theory opens up new avenues for accessible\nanalytical and numerical studies of the ultrafast dynamics of superconductors.\n", "  We present candidate members of the Pal 5, GD-1, Cetus Polar, and Orphan\ntidal stellar streams found in LAMOST DR3, SDSS DR9 and APOGEE catalogs. In\nLAMOST DR3, we find 20, 4, 24 high confidence candidates of tidal streams GD-1,\nCetus Polar and Orphan respectively. We also list from the SDSS DR9\nspectroscopic catalog 59, 118, 10 high confidence candidates of tidal streams\nCetus Polar, Orphan and Pal 5, respectively. Furthermore, we find 7 high\nconfidence candidates of the Pal 5 tidal stream in APOGEE data. Compared with\nSDSS, the new candidates from LAMOST DR3 are brighter, so that together, more\nof the color-magnitude diagram, including the giant branch can be explored.\nAnalysis of SDSS data shows that there are 3 metallicity peaks of the Orphan\nstream and also shows some spatial separation. LAMOST data confirms multiple\nmetallicities in this stream. The metallicity, given by the higher resolution\nAPOGEE instrument, of the Pal 5 tidal stream is [Fe/H] $\\sim -1.2$, higher than\nthat given earlier by SDSS spectra. Many previously unidentified stream members\nare tabulated here for the first time, along with existing members, allowing\nfuture researchers to further constrain the orbits of these objects as they\nmove within the Galaxy's dark matter potential.\n", "  We introduce a new local symmetry into the fermion sector of a gauge\ninvariant Lagrangian which may or may not contain a scalar or spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. The Standard Model in the unitary gauge and QCD are\nparticular cases where this symmetry may apply. We determine the associated\nvector and axial vector currents and their conservation laws. We show that a\nsingle current conservation law may lead to multiple Ward-Takahashi identities.\nOur results can potentially have important consequences for effective models of\nlow-energy QCD and hadron structure. As an specific example, we discuss the\nconstruction of tetraquark states within a generalized linear sigma model and\nshow that this new symmetry probes the tetraquarks in a manner that is\nconsistent with the large $N_c$ limit of QCD.\n", "  We calculate ionization energies and fundamental vibrational transitions for\nH$_2^+$, D$_2^+$, and HD$^+$ molecular ions. The NRQED expansion for the energy\nin terms of the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ is used. Previous calculations\nof orders $m\\alpha^6$ and $m\\alpha^7$ are improved by including second-order\ncontributions due to the vibrational motion of nuclei. Furthermore, we evaluate\nthe largest corrections at the order $m\\alpha^8$. That allows to reduce the\nfractional uncertainty to the level of $7\\cdot10^{-12}$ for fundamental\ntransitions and to $4\\cdot10^{-12}$ for the ionization energies.\n", "  We examine the validity of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and probe for the dynamics\nof dark energy using latest astronomical observations. Using the $Om(z)$\ndiagnosis, we find that different kinds of observational data are in tension\nwithin the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. We then allow for dynamics of dark energy\nand investigate the constraint on dark energy parameters. We find that for two\ndifferent kinds of parametrisations of the equation of state parameter $w$, a\ncombination of current data mildly favours an evolving $w$, although the\nsignificance is not sufficient for it to be supported by the Bayesian evidence.\nA forecast of the DESI survey shows that the dynamics of dark energy could be\ndetected at $7\\sigma$ confidence level, and will be decisively supported by the\nBayesian evidence, if the best fit model of $w$ derived from current data is\nthe true model.\n", "  The recent discoveries of pulsed X-ray emission from three ultraluminous\nX-ray (ULX) sources have finally enabled us to recognize a subclass within the\nULX class: the great pretenders, neutron stars (NSs) that appear to emit X-ray\nradiation at isotropic luminosities $L_X = 7\\times 10^{39}$~erg~s$^{-1}-1\\times\n10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ only because their emissions are strongly beamed toward\nour direction and our sight lines are offset by only a few degrees from their\nmagnetic-dipole axes. The three known pretenders appear to be stronger emitters\nthan the presumed black holes of the ULX class, such as Holmberg II \\& IX X-1,\nIC10 X-1, and NGC300 X-1. For these three NSs, we have adopted a single\nreasonable assumption, that their brightest observed outbursts unfold at the\nEddington rate, and we have calculated both their propeller states and their\nsurface magnetic-field magnitudes. We find that the results are not at all\ndifferent from those recently obtained for the Magellanic Be/X-ray pulsars: the\nthree NSs reveal modest magnetic fields of about 0.3-0.4~TG and beamed\npropeller-line X-ray luminosities of $\\sim 10^{36-37}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,\nsubstantially below the Eddington limit.\n", "  Nuclear resonant x-ray diffraction in grazing incidence geometry is used to\ndetermine the lateral magnetic configuration in a one-dimensional lattice of\nferromagnetic nanostripes. During magnetic reversal, strong nuclear\nsuperstructure diffraction peaks appear in addition to the electronic ones due\nto an antiferromagnetic order in the nanostripe lattice. We show that the\nanalysis of the angular distribution of the resonantly diffracted x-rays\ntogether with the time-dependence of the coherently diffracted nuclear signal\nreveals surface spin structures with very high sensitivity. This novel\nscattering technique provides a unique access to laterally correlated spin\nconfigurations in magnetically ordered nanostructures and, in perspective, also\nto their dynamics.\n", "  We study an extension of the Inert Higgs Doublet Model (IHDM) by three copies\nof right handed neutrinos and heavy charged leptons such that both the inert\nHiggs doublet and the heavy fermions are odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry of the\nmodel. The neutrino masses are generated at one loop in the scotogenic fashion.\nAssuming the neutral scalar of the inert Higgs to be the dark matter candidate,\nwe particularly look into the region of parameter space where dark matter relic\nabundance is primarily governed by the inert Higgs coupling with the leptons.\nThis corresponds to tiny Higgs portal coupling of dark matter as well as large\nmass splitting within different components of the inert Higgs doublet\nsuppressing the coannihilations. Such lepton portal couplings can still produce\nthe correct relic abundance even if the Higgs portal couplings are arbitrarily\nsmall. Such tiny Higgs portal couplings may be responsible for suppressed dark\nmatter nucleon cross section as well as tiny invisible branching ratio of the\nstandard model Higgs, to be probed at ongoing and future experiments. We also\nbriefly discuss the collider implications of such a scenario.\n", "  We investigate the role of secular and mean motion resonances on the water\ntransport from a belt of icy asteroids onto planets or embryos orbiting inside\nthe circumprimary habitable zone (HZ) of a binary star system. In addition, the\nhost-star has an accompanying gas giant planet. For a comparison, we perform\ntwo case studies where a secular resonance (SR) is located either inside the HZ\nclose to 1.0 au (causing eccentric motion of a planet or embryos therein) or in\nthe asteroid belt, beyond the snow line. In the latter case, a higher flux of\nicy objects moving towards the HZ is expected. Collisions between asteroids and\nobjects in the HZ are treated analytically. Our purely dynamical study shows\nthat the SR in the HZ boosts the water transport; however, collisions can occur\nat very high impact speeds. In this paper, we treat for the first time,\nrealistic collisions using a GPU 3D-SPH code to assess the water loss in the\nprojectile. Including the water loss into the dynamical results, we get more\nrealistic values for the water mass fraction of the asteroid during an impact.\nWe highlight that collisions occurring at high velocities greatly reduce the\nwater content of the projectile and thus the amount of water transported to\nplanets or embryos orbiting inside the HZ. Moreover, we discuss other effects\nthat could modify our results, namely the asteroid's surface rate recession due\nto ice sublimation and the atmospheric drag contribution on the asteroids' mass\nloss.\n", "  The Carina nebula hosts a large number of globulettes. The majority are of\nplanetary mass, but there are also those with masses of several tens up to a\nfew hundred Jupiter masses. We carried out radio observations of molecular line\nemission in 12CO and 13CO (2-1) and (3-2) of 12 larger objects in addition of\npositions in adjacent shell structures using APEX. All selected objects were\ndetected with radial velocities shifted relative to the emission from related\nshell structures and background molecular clouds. Globulettes along the western\npart of an extended dust shell show a small spread in velocity with small\nvelocity shifts relative to the shell. This system of globulettes and shell\nstructures in the foreground of the bright nebulosity surrounding the cluster\nTrumpler 14 is expanding with a few km/s relative to the cluster. The Carina\nglobulettes are compact and denser than objects of similar mass studied\npreviously in the Rosette nebula. Some globulettes in Tr 14 are located far\nfrom any shell structures. These objects move at a similar speed as the\nglobulettes along the shell. The distribution and velocities of the globulettes\nstudied suggest that they have originated from eroding shells and elephant\ntrunks.\n", "  (abridged) We study the composition of the faint radio population selected\nfrom the VLA-COSMOS 3GHz Large Project. The survey covers a 2.6sq.deg. area\nwith a mean rms of ~2.3uJy/b, cataloging 10830 sources (>5sigma). Combining\nthese radio data with optical, near-infrared (UltraVISTA), mid-infrared\n(Spitzer/IRAC) data, and X-ray data (Chandra), we find counterparts to radio\nsources for ~93% of the radio sample (in the areas of the COSMOS field not\naffected by saturated or bright sources in the optical to NIR bands), reaching\nout to z<6. We further classify the sources as star forming galaxies or AGN\nbased on various criteria, such as X-ray luminosity, observed MIR color, UV-FIR\nspectral-energy distribution, rest-frame NUV-optical color corrected for dust\nextinction, and radio-excess relative to that expected from the hosts'\nstar-formation rate. We separate the AGN into sub-samples dominated by\nlow-to-moderate and moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN, candidates for\nhigh-redshift analogues to local low- and high-excitation emission line AGN,\nrespectively. We study the fractional contributions of these sub-populations\ndown to radio flux levels of ~11uJy at 3GHz (or ~20uJy at 1.4GHz assuming a\nspectral index of -0.7). We find that the dominant fraction at 1.4GHz flux\ndensities above ~200uJy is constituted of low-to-moderate radiative luminosity\nAGN. Below densities of ~100uJy the fraction of star-forming galaxies increases\nto ~60%, followed by the moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (~20%), and\nlow-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN (~20%). Based on this observational\nevidence, we extrapolate the fractions down to sensitivities of the SKA. Our\nestimates suggest that at the faint flux limits to be reached by the SKA1\nsurveys, a selection based only on radio flux limits can provide a simple tool\nto efficiently identify samples highly (>75%) dominated by star-forming\ngalaxies.\n", "  We explore the multiwavelength properties of AGN host galaxies for different\nclasses of radio-selected AGN out to z$\\lesssim$6 via a multiwavelength\nanalysis of about 7700 radio sources in the COSMOS field. The sources were\nselected with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 3 GHz (10 cm) within the VLA-COSMOS\n3 GHz Large Project, and cross-matched with multiwavelength ancillary data.\nThis is the largest sample of high-redshift (z$\\lesssim$6) radio sources with\nexquisite photometric coverage and redshift measurements available. We\nconstructed a sample of moderate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN (HLAGN) via\nspectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition combined with standard X-ray\nand mid-infrared diagnostics. Within the remainder of the sample we further\nidentified low-to-moderate radiative luminosity AGN (MLAGN) via excess in radio\nemission relative to the star formation rates in their host galaxies. We show\nthat AGN power in HLAGN occurs predominantly in radiative form, while MLAGN\ndisplay a substantial mechanical AGN luminosity component. We found significant\ndifferences in the host properties of the two AGN classes, as a function of\nredshift. At z$<$1.5, MLAGN appear to reside in significantly more massive and\nless star-forming galaxies compared to HLAGN. At z$>$1.5, we observed a\nreversal in the behaviour of the stellar mass distributions with the HLAGN\npopulating the higher stellar mass tail. We interpret this finding as a\npossible hint of the downsizing of galaxies hosting HLAGN, with the most\nmassive galaxies triggering AGN activity earlier than less massive galaxies,\nand then fading to MLAGN at lower redshifts. Our conclusion is that HLAGN and\nMLAGN samples trace two distinct galaxy and AGN populations in a wide range of\nredshifts, possibly resembling the radio AGN types often referred to as\nradiative- and jet-mode (or high- and low-excitation), respectively.\n", "  We examine the behaviour of the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) over the\nrange $0<z<6$ using new, highly sensitive 3GHz observations with the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (VLA) and infrared data from the Herschel Space\nObservatory in the 2deg$^{2}$ COSMOS field. We distinguish between objects\nwhere emission is believed to arise solely from star-formation, and those where\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) is thought to be present. We account for\nnon-detections in the radio or in the infrared using a doubly-censored survival\nanalysis. We find that the IRRC of star-forming galaxies, quantified by the\ninfrared-to-1.4GHz radio luminosity ratio ($q_{\\rm TIR}$), decreases with\nincreasing redshift: $q_{\\rm TIR}(z)=(2.88\\pm0.03)(1+z)^{-0.19\\pm0.01}$.\nModerate-to-high radiative luminosity AGN do not follow the same $q_{\\rm\nTIR}$$(z)$ trend, having a lower normalisation and steeper decrease with\nredshift. We cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified AGN\ncontributions only to the radio regime may be steepening the observed $q_{\\rm\nTIR}(z)$ trend of the star-forming population. An increasing fractional\ncontribution to the observed 3GHz flux by free-free emission of star-forming\ngalaxies may also affect the derived evolution. However, we find that the\nstandard (M82-based) assumption of the typical radio spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) for star-forming galaxies is inconsistent with our results.\nThis suggests a more complex shape of the typical radio SED for star-forming\ngalaxies, and that imperfect $K$ corrections in the radio may govern the\nderived redshift trend of $q_{\\rm TIR}$. Lastly, we present a\nredshift-dependent relation between rest-frame 1.4GHz radio luminosity and star\nformation rate taking the derived redshift trend into account.\n", "  We make use of the deep Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) COSMOS radio\nobservations at 3 GHz to infer radio luminosity functions of star-forming\ngalaxies up to redshifts of z~5 based on approximately 6000 detections with\nreliable optical counterparts. This is currently the largest radio-selected\nsample available out to z~5 across an area of 2 square degrees with a\nsensitivity of rms=2.3 ujy/beam. By fixing the faint and bright end shape of\nthe radio luminosity function to the local values, we find a strong redshift\ntrend that can be fitted with a pure luminosity evolution L~(1+z)^{(3.16 +-\n0.2)-(0.32 +- 0.07) z}. We estimate star formation rates (SFRs) from our radio\nluminosities using an infrared (IR)-radio correlation that is redshift\ndependent. By integrating the parametric fits of the evolved luminosity\nfunction we calculate the cosmic SFR density (SFRD) history since z~5. Our data\nsuggest that the SFRD history peaks between 2<z<3 and that the ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies (ULIRGs; 100 Msol/yr<SFR<1000 Msol/yr) contribute up to ~25%\nto the total SFRD in the same redshift range. Hyperluminous infrared galaxies\n(HyLIRGs; SFR>1000 Msol/yr) contribute an additional <2% in the entire observed\nredshift range. We find evidence of a potential underestimation of SFRD based\non ultraviolet (UV) rest-frame observations of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at\nhigh redshifts (z>4) on the order of 15-20%, owing to appreciable star\nformation in highly dust-obscured galaxies, which might remain undetected in\nsuch UV observations.\n", "  In this paper, we report a significant recovery of the linear baryonic\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) signature by applying the isobaric reconstruction\nalgorithm to the non-linear matter density field. Assuming only the\nlongitudinal component of the displacement being cosmologically relevant, this\nalgorithm iteratively solves the coordinate transform between the Lagrangian\nand Eulerian frames without requiring any specific knowledge of the dynamics.\nFor dark matter field, it produces the non-linear displacement potential with\nvery high fidelity. The reconstruction error at the pixel level is within a few\npercent, and is caused only by the emergence of the transverse component after\nthe shell-crossing. As it circumvents the strongest non-linearity of the\ndensity evolution, the reconstructed field is well-described by linear theory\nand immune from the bulk-flow smearing of the BAO signature. Therefore this\nalgorithm could significantly improve the measurement accuracy of the sound\nhorizon scale. For a perfect large-scale structure survey at redshift zero\nwithout Poisson or instrumental noise, the fractional error is reduced by a\nfactor of 2.7, very close to the ideal limit with linear power spectrum and\nGaussian covariance matrix.\n", "  We aim to characterize the relationship between dust properties. We also aim\nto provide equations to estimate accurate dust properties from limited\nobservational datasets.\n  We assemble a sample of 1,630 nearby (z<0.1) galaxies-over a large range of\nMstar, SFR - with multi-wavelength observations available from wise, iras,\nplanck and/or SCUBA. The characterization of dust emission comes from SED\nfitting using Draine & Li dust models, which we parametrize using two\ncomponents (warm and cold ). The subsample of these galaxies with global\nmeasurements of CO and/or HI are used to explore the molecular and/or atomic\ngas content of the galaxies.\n  The total Lir, Mdust and dust temperature of the cold component (Tc) form a\nplane that we refer to as the dust plane. A galaxy's sSFR drives its position\non the dust plane: starburst galaxies show higher Lir, Mdust and Tc compared to\nMain Sequence and passive galaxies. Starburst galaxies also show higher\nspecific Mdust (Mdust/Mstar) and specific Mgas (Mgas/Mstar). The Mdust is more\nclosely correlated with the total Mgas (atomic plus molecular) than with the\nindividual components. Our multi wavelength data allows us to define several\nequations to estimate Lir, Mdust and Tc from one or two monochromatic\nluminosities in the infrared and/or sub-millimeter.\n  We estimate the dust mass and infrared luminosity from a single monochromatic\nluminosity within the R-J tail of the dust emission, with errors of 0.12 and\n0.20dex, respectively. These errors are reduced to 0.05 and 0.10 dex,\nrespectively, if the Tc is used. The Mdust is correlated with the total Mism\n(Mism \\propto Mdust^0.7). For galaxies with Mstar 8.5<log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.9,\nthe conversion factor \\alpha_850mum shows a large scatter (rms=0.29dex). The SF\nmode of a galaxy shows a correlation with both the Mgass and Mdust: high\nMdust/Mstar galaxies are gas-rich and show the highest SFRs.\n", "  Gravitational radiation is an excellent field for testing theories of gravity\nin strong gravitational fields. The current observations on the\ngravitational-wave (GW) bursts by LIGO have already placed various constraints\non the alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate the\npossible bounds which could be placed on the Brans-Dicke gravity using GW\ndetection from inspiralling compact binaries with the proposed Einstein\nTelescope, a third-generation GW detector. We first calculate in details the\nwaveforms of gravitational radiation in the lowest post-Newtonian\napproximation, including the tensor and scalar fields, which can be divided\ninto the three polarization modes, i.e. \"plus mode\", \"cross mode\" and\n\"breathing mode\". Applying the stationary phase approximation, we obtain their\nFourier transforms, and derive the correction terms in amplitude, phase and\npolarization of GWs, relative to the corresponding results in General\nRelativity. Imposing the noise level of Einstein Telescope, we find that the GW\ndetection from inspiralling compact binaries, composed of a neutron star and a\nblack hole, can place stringent constraints on the Brans-Dicke gravity. The\nbound on the coupling constant $\\omega_{\\rm BD}$ depends on the mass,\nsky-position, orbital angle, polarization angle, luminosity distance, redshift\ndistribution and total observed number $N_{\\rm GW}$ of the binary systems.\nTaking into account all the burst events up to redshift $z=5$, we find that the\nbound could be $\\omega_{\\rm BD}\\gtrsim 10^{6}\\times(N_{\\rm GW}/10^4)^{1/2}$.\nEven for the conservative estimation with $10^{4}$ observed events, the bound\nis still more than one order tighter than the current limit from Solar System\nexperiments. So, we conclude that Einstein Telescope will provide a powerful\nplatform to test alternative theories of gravity.\n", "  Quantum gravitational effects in black hole spacetimes with a cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$ are considered. The effective quantum spacetimes for the\nblack holes are constructed by taking into account the renormalization group\nimprovement of classical solutions obtained in the framework of Unimodular\nGravity (a theory which is identical to General Relativity at a classical\nlevel). This allows us to avoid the usual divergences associated with the\npresence of a running $\\Lambda$. The horizons and causal structure of the\nimproved black holes are discussed taking into account the current\nobservational bounds for the cosmological constant. It is shown that the\nresulting effective quantum black hole spacetimes are always devoid of\nsingularities.\n", "  We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the CO J=3-2 emission line\nin two massive galaxies at z=2.5 on the star-forming main sequence. Both\ngalaxies have compact dusty star-forming cores with effective radii of Re=1.3\nkpc and Re=1.2 kpc in the 870 um continuum emission. The spatial extent of\nstar-forming molecular gas is also compact with Re=1.9 kpc and Re=2.3 kpc, but\nmore extended than the dust emission. Interpreting the observed\nposition-velocity diagrams with dynamical models, we find the starburst cores\nto be rotation-dominated with the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity to the\nlocal velocity dispersion of v/sigma=7.0 (v=386 km/s) and v/sigma_0=4.1 (v=391\nkm/s). Given that the descendants of these massive galaxies in the local\nuniverse are likely ellipticals with v/sigma nearly an order of magnitude\nlower, the rapidly rotating galaxies would lose significant net angular\nmomentum in the intervening time. The comparisons among dynamical, stellar,\ngas, and dust mass suggest that the starburst CO-to-H2 conversion factor of\nalpha_CO=0.8 Msun/(K km/s/pc2) is appropriate in the spatially resolved cores.\nThe dense cores are likely to be formed in extreme environments similar to the\ncentral regions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Our work also\ndemonstrates that a combination of medium-resolution CO and high-resolution\ndust continuum observations is a powerful tool for characterizing the dynamical\nstate of molecular gas in distant galaxies.\n", "  We theoretically study the conductivity in arrays of metallic grains due to\nthe variable-range multiple cotunneling of electrons with short-range\n(screened) Coulomb interaction. The system is supposed to be coupled to random\nstray charges in the dielectric matrix that are only loosely bounded to their\nspatial positions by elastic forces. The flexibility of the stray charges gives\nrise to a polaronic effect, which leads to the onset of Arrhenius-like\nconductivity behavior at low temperatures, replacing conventional Mott\nvariable-range hopping. The effective activation energy logarithmically depends\non temperature due to fluctuations of the polaron barrier heights. We present\nthe unified theory that covers both weak and strong polaron effect regimes of\nhopping in granular metals and describes the crossover from elastic to\ninelastic cotunneling.\n", "  Investigation of the resonances $X(4140)$ and $X(4274)$, which were recently\nconfirmed by the LHCb Collaboration [1], is carried out by treating them as the\ncolor triplet and sextet $[cs][\\bar{c}\\bar {s}]$ diquark-antidiquark states\nwith the spin-parity $J^{P}=1^{+}$, respectively. We calculate the masses and\nmeson-current couplings of these tetraquarks in the context of QCD two-point\nsum rule method by taking into account the quark, gluon and mixed vacuum\ncondensates up to eight dimensions. We also study the vertices\n$X(4140)J/\\psi\\phi$ and $X(4274)J/\\psi\\phi$, and evaluate corresponding strong\ncouplings $g_{X(4140)J/\\psi\\phi}$ and $ g_{X(4274)J/\\psi\\phi}$ by means of QCD\nlight-cone sum rule method, and a technique of the soft-meson approximation. In\nturn, these couplings contain a required information to determine the width of\nthe $X(4140)\\to J/\\psi\\phi$ and $X(4274) \\to J/\\psi\\phi$ decay channels. We\ncompare our results for the masses and decay widths of the $X(4140)$ and\n$X(4274)$ resonances with the LHCb data, and alternative theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  In this work we introduce the Rytov approximation in the scope of high-energy\nelectron scattering with the motivation of developing better linear models for\nelectron scattering. Such linear models play an important role in tomography\nand similar reconstruction techniques. Conventional linear models, such as the\nPhase Grating Approximation, have reached their limits in current and forsee-\nable applications, most importantly in achieving three-dimensional atomic\nresolution using electron holographic tomography. The Rytov approximation\nincorporates propagation effects which are the most pressing limitation of\nconventional models. While predominately used in the weak-scattering regime of\nlight microscopy we show that the Rytov approximation can give reasonable\nresults in the inherently strong-scattering regime of transmission electron\nmicroscopy.\n", "  Optically levitated nanoparticles in vacuum are a promising model system to\ntest physics beyond our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Such\nexperimental tests require extreme control over the dephasing of the levitated\nparticle's motion. If the nanoparticle carries a finite net charge, it\nexperiences a random Coulomb force due to fluctuating electric fields. This\ndephasing mechanism can be fully excluded by discharging the levitated\nparticle. Here, we present a simple and reliable technique to control the\ncharge on an optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum. Our method is based on\nthe generation of charges in an electric discharge and does not require\nadditional optics or mechanics close to the optical trap.\n", "  Fluctuation-induced forces are investigated for ideal and imperfect Bose\ngases confined to $d$-dimensional films of size $\\infty^{d-1}\\times D$ under\nperiodic (P), antiperiodic (A), Dirichlet-Dirichlet (DD), Neumann-Neumann (NN),\nand Robin (R) boundary conditions (BCs). The full scaling functions\n$\\Upsilon^{\\text{BC}}_d(x_\\lambda=D/\\lambda_{th},{x_\\xi=D/\\xi})$ of the\nresidual reduced grand potential per area,\n$\\varphi_{\\text{res},d}^{\\text{BC}}(T,\\mu,D)=D^{-(d-1)}\\Upsilon_d^{\\text{BC}}(x_\\lambda,x_\\xi)$,\nare determined for the ideal gas case with these BCs, where $\\lambda_{th}$ and\n$\\xi$ are the thermal de-Broglie wavelength and the bulk correlation length,\nrespectively. The scaling functions $\\Theta^{\\text{BC}}_d(x_\\xi)\\equiv\n\\Upsilon_d^{\\text{BC}}(\\infty,x_\\xi)$ describing the critical behavior at the\nbulk condensation transition are shown to agree with those previously\ndetermined from a massive free $O(2)$ theory for\n$\\text{BC}=\\text{P},\\text{A},\\text{DD},\\text{DN},\\text{NN}$. For $d=3$, they\nare expressed in closed analytical form. The analogous functions\n$\\Upsilon_d^{\\text{BC}}(x_\\lambda,x_\\xi,c_1D,c_2D)$ and\n$\\Theta^{\\text{R}}_d(x_\\xi,c_1D,c_2D)$ under the RBCs\n$(\\partial_z-c_1)\\phi|_{z=0}=(\\partial_z+c_2)\\phi|_{z=D}=0$ with $c_1\\ge 0$ and\n$c_2\\ge 0$ are also determined. The functions\n$\\Upsilon_{\\infty,d}^{\\text{P}}(x_\\lambda,x_\\xi)$ and\n$\\Phi_{\\infty,d}^{\\text{P}}(x_\\xi)$ for the imperfect Bose gas are shown to\nagree with those of the interacting Bose gas with $n\\to\\infty$ internal degrees\nof freedom. Hence for ${d=3}$, $\\Phi_{\\infty,d}^{\\text{P}}(x_\\xi)$ is known\nexactly in closed analytic form. A modified imperfect Bose-gas model with free\nBC is introduced that corresponds to the limit $n\\to\\infty$ of this interacting\nBose gas. Exact results for the function\n$\\Theta_{\\infty,3}^{\\mathbb{DD}}(x_\\xi)$ therefore follow from those of the\n$O(2n)$ $\\phi^4$ model for $n\\to\\infty$.\n", "  We discuss an application of dynamical multi-parton interaction model, tuned\nto measurements of underlying event topology, for a description of destroying\nrapidity gaps in the jet-gap-jet processes at the LHC. We concentrate on the\ndynamical origin of the mechanism of destroying the rapidity gap. The cross\nsection for jet-gap-jet is calculated within LL BFKL approximation. We discuss\nthe topology of final states without and with the MPI effects. We discuss some\nexamples of selected kinematical situations (fixed jet rapidities and\ntransverse momenta) as distributions averaged over the dynamics of the\njet-gap-jet scattering. The color-singlet ladder exchange amplitude for the\npartonic subprocess is implemented into the \\textsc{Pythia 8} generator, which\nis then used for hadronisation and for the simulation of the MPI effects.\nSeveral differential distributions are shown and discussed. We present the\nratio of cross section calculated with and without MPI effects as a function of\nrapidity gap in between the jets.\n", "  We present a numerical computation of overlaps in mass quenches in\nsine-Gordon quantum field theory using truncated conformal space approach\n(TCSA). To improve the cut-off dependence of the method, we use a novel running\ncoupling definition which has a general applicability in free boson TCSA. The\nnumerical results are used to confirm the validity of a previously proposed\nanalytical Ansatz for the initial state in the sinh-Gordon quench.\n", "  Recent detailed observations of the radio-loud quasar 3C 186 indicate the\npossibility that a supermassive recoiling black hole is moving away from the\nhost galaxy at a speed of nearly 2100km/s. If this is the case, we can model\nthe mass ratio and spins of the progenitor binary black hole using the results\nof numerical relativity simulations. We find that the black holes in the\nprogenitor must have comparable masses with a mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2>1/4$ and\nthe spin of the primary black hole must be $\\alpha_2=S_2/m_2^2>0.4$. The final\nremnant of the merger is bounded by $\\alpha_f>0.45$ and at least $4\\%$ of the\ntotal mass of the binary system is radiated into gravitational waves. We\nconsider four different pre-merger scenarios that further narrow those values.\nAssuming, for instance, a cold accretion driven merger model, we find that the\nbinary had comparable masses with $q=0.70^{+0.29}_{-0.21}$ and the normalized\nspins of the larger and smaller black holes were\n$\\alpha_2=0.94^{+0.06}_{-0.22}$ and $\\alpha_1=0.95^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$. We can\nalso estimate the final recoiling black hole spin\n$\\alpha_f=0.93^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ and that the system radiated\n$9.6^{+0.8}_{-1.4}\\%$ of its total mass, making the merger of those black holes\nthe most energetic event ever observed.\n", "  We theoretically consider ultracold polar molecules in a wave guide. The\nparticles are bosons, they experience a periodic potential due to an optical\nlattice oriented along the wave guide and are polarised by an electric field\northogonal to the guide axis. The array is mechanically unstable by opening the\ntransverse confinement in the direction orthogonal to the polarizing electric\nfield and can undergo a transition to a double-chain (zigzag) structure. For\nthis geometry we derive a multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model for\ndetermining the quantum phases of the gas at the mechanical instability taking\ninto account the quantum fluctuations in all directions of space. Our model\nlimits the dimension of the numerically relevant Hilbert subspace by means of\nan appropriate decomposition of the field operator, which is obtained from a\nfield theoretical model of the linear-zigzag instability. We determine the\nphase diagrams of small systems using exact diagonalization and find that, even\nfor tight transverse confinement, the aspect ratio between the two transverse\ntrap frequencies controls not only the classical but also the quantum\nproperties of the ground state in a non-trivial way. Convergence tests at the\nlinear-zigzag instability demonstrate that our multi-mode generalized\nBose-Hubbard model can catch the essential features of the quantum phases of\ndipolar gases in confined geometries with a limited computational effort.\n", "  Solid-density plasmas driven by intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL)\nradiation are seeded by sources of non-thermal photoelectrons and Auger\nelectrons that ionize and heat the target via collisions. Simulation codes that\nare commonly used to model such plasmas, such as collisional-radiative (CR)\ncodes, typically assume a Maxwellian distribution and thus instantaneous\nthermalization of the source electrons. In this study, we present a detailed\ndescription and initial applications of a collisional particle-in-cell code,\nPICLS, that has been extended with a self-consistent radiation transport model\nand Monte-Carlo models for photoionization and KLL Auger ionization, enabling\nthe fully kinetic simulation of XFEL-driven plasmas. The code is used to\nsimulate two experiments previously performed at the Linac Coherent Light\nSource investigating XFEL-driven solid-density Al plasmas. It is shown that\nPICLS-simulated pulse transmissions using the Ecker-Kr\\\"oll continuum-lowering\nmodel agree much better with measurements than do simulations using the\nStewart-Pyatt model. Good quantitative agreement is also found between the\ntime-dependent PICLS results and those of analogous simulations by the CR code\nSCFLY, which was used in the analysis of the experiments to accurately\nreproduce the observed K{\\alpha} emissions and pulse transmissions. Finally, it\nis shown that the effects of the non-thermal electrons are negligible for the\nconditions of the particular experiments under investigation.\n", "  A hidden-variable model is explicitly constructed by use of a Liouvillian\ndescription for the dynamics of two coupled spin-1/2 particles. In this model,\nthe underlying Hamiltonian trajectories play the role of deterministic hidden\nvariables, whereas the shape of the initial probability distribution figures as\na hidden variable that regulates the capacity of the model in producing\ncorrelations. We show that even though the model can very well describe the\nshort-time entanglement dynamics of initially separated pure states, it is\nincapable of violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. Our work\nsuggests that, if one takes the reluctance of a given quantum resource to be\nemulated by a local-hidden-variable model as a signature of its nonclassicality\ndegree, then one can conclude that entanglement and nonlocality are\nnonequivalent even in the context of two-qubit pure states.\n", "  Since a large population of massive O/B stars and putative neutron stars\n(NSs) located in the vicinity of the Galactic center (GC), intermediate-mass\nX-ray binaries (IMXBs) constituted by a NS and a B-type star probably exist\nhere. We investigate the evolutions of accreting NSs in IMXBs (similar to M82\nX-2) with a $\\sim5.2M_\\odot$ companion, and orbit period $\\simeq2.53$ day. By\nadopting an mildly super-Eddington rate $\\dot{M}=6\\times10^{-8}M_\\odot~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ for the early Case B Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) accretion, we find\nonly in accreting NSs with quite elastic crusts (slippage factor $s=0.05$), the\ntoroidal magnetic fields can be amplified within 1 Myrs, which is assumed to be\nthe longest duration of the RLOF. These IMXBs will evolve into NS+white dwarf\n(WD) binaries if they are dynamical stable. However, before the formation of\nNS+WD binaries, the high stellar density in the GC will probably lead to\nfrequent encounters between the NS+evolved star binaries (in post-early Case B\nmass transfer phase) and NSs or exchange encounters with other stars, which may\nproduce single NSs. These NSs will evolve into magnetars when the amplified\npoloidal magnetic fields diffuse out to the NS surfaces. Consequently, our\nresults provide a possible explanation for the origin of the GC magnetar SGR\n1745-2900. Moreover, the accreting NSs with $s>0.05$ will evolve into\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs). Therefore, our model reveals the GC magnetars and\nMSPs could both originate from the special kind of IMXBs.\n", "  In this paper, I construct a class of everywhere regular geometric sigma\nmodels that possess bouncing solutions. Precisely, I show that every bouncing\nmetric can be made a solution of such a model. My previous attempt to do so by\nemploying one scalar field has failed due to the appearance of harmful\nsingularities near the bounce. In this work, I use four scalar fields to\nconstruct a class of geometric sigma models which are free of singularities.\nThe models within the class are parametrized by their background geometries. I\nprove that, whatever background is chosen, the dynamics of its small\nperturbations is classically stable on the whole time axes. Contrary to what\none expects from the structure of the initial Lagrangian, the physics of\nbackground fluctuations is found to carry 2 tensor, 2 vector and 2 scalar\ndegrees of freedom. The graviton mass, that naturally appears in these models,\nis shown to be several orders of magnitude smaller than its experimental bound.\nI provide three simple examples to demonstrate how this is done in practice. In\nparticular, I show that graviton mass can be made arbitrarily small.\n", "  We study how the synergetic effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Zeeman\nsplitting (ZS) affects the optical conductivity in the one-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel using the Kubo formula. We focus on two phenomena: (1) the electric\ndipole spin resonance (EDSR) in the metallic regime and (2) the optical\nconductivity in the Mott-insulating phase above the optical gap. In both cases,\nwe calculate qualitatively the effects of SOC and ZS and how they depend on the\nrelative angle between the SOC vector and the magnetic field direction. First,\nwe investigate the spin resonance without electron correlation (the Hubbard\nparameter $U=0$). Although, neither SOC nor ZS causes any resonance by itself\nin the optical conductivity, the EDSR becomes possible when both of them exist.\nThe resulting contribution to the optical conductivity is analyzed\nanalytically. The effect of $U$ on the spin resonance is also studied with a\nnumerical method. It is found that at half-filling, the resonance is first\nenhanced for small $U$ and then suppressed when the optical gap is large\nenough. In the strong coupling limit $U \\rightarrow \\infty$ at half-filling, we\nalso refer to the resonance between the lower and upper Hubbard bands appearing\nat $\\omega \\sim U$, above the optical gap. A large magnetic field tends to\nsuppress the signal while it is recovered thanks to SOC depending on the\nrelative angle of the magnetic field.\n", "  Van der Waals interactions between two neutral but polarizable systems at a\nseparation $R$ much larger than the typical size of the systems are at the core\nof a broad sweep of contemporary problems in settings ranging from atomic,\nmolecular and condensed matter physics to strong interactions and gravity. We\nreexamine the dispersive van der Waals interactions between two hydrogen atoms.\nThe novelty of the analysis resides in the usage of nonrelativistic EFTs of\nQED. In this framework, the van der Waals potential acquires the meaning of a\nmatching coefficient in an EFT suited to describe the low energy dynamics of an\natom pair. It may be computed systematically as a series in $R$ times some\ntypical atomic scale and in the fine structure constant $\\alpha$. The van der\nWaals potential gets short range contributions and radiative corrections, which\nwe compute in dimensional regularization and renormalize here for the first\ntime. Results are given in $d$ spacetime dimensions. One can distinguish among\ndifferent regimes depending on the relative size between $1/R$ and the typical\natomic bound state energy $m\\alpha^2$. Each regime is characterized by a\nspecific hierarchy of scales and a corresponding tower of EFTs. The short\ndistance regime is characterized by $1/R \\gg m\\alpha^2$ and the LO van der\nWaals potential is the London potential. We compute also NNNLO corrections. In\nthe long distance regime we have $1/R\\ll m\\alpha^2$. In this regime, the van\nder Waals potential contains contact terms, which are parametrically larger\nthan the Casimir-Polder potential that describes the potential at large\ndistances. In the EFT the Casimir-Polder potential counts as a NNNLO effect. In\nthe intermediate distance regime, $1/R\\sim m\\alpha^2$, a significantly more\ncomplex potential is obtained which we compare with the two previous limiting\ncases. We conclude commenting on the hadronic van der Waals case.\n", "  The relativistic jets created by some active galactic nuclei are important\nagents of AGN feedback. In spite of this, our understanding of what produces\nthese jets is still incomplete. X-ray observations, which can probe the\nprocesses operating in the central regions in immediate vicinity of the\nsupermassive black hole, the presumed jet launching point, are potentially\nparticularly valuable in illuminating the jet formation process. Here, we\npresent the hard X-ray NuSTAR observations of the radio-loud quasar 4C 74.26 in\na joint analysis with quasi-simultaneous, soft X-ray Swift observations. Our\nspectral analysis reveals a high-energy cut-off of 183$_{-35}^{+51}$ keV and\nconfirms the presence of ionized reflection in the source. From the average\nspectrum we detect that the accretion disk is mildly recessed with an inner\nradius of $R_\\mathrm{in}=4-180\\,R_\\mathrm{g}$. However, no significant\nevolution of the inner radius is seen during the three months covered by our\nNuSTAR campaign. This lack of variation could mean that the jet formation in\nthis radio-loud quasar differs from what is observed in broad-line radio\ngalaxies.\n", "  Topological metals with protected band-crossing points have been attracting\ngreat interest. Here we report novel topological band features in a family of\nmetal diboride materials. Using first- principles calculations, we show that\nthese materials are metallic, and close to Fermi level, there appears\ncoexistence of one pair of nodal rings and one pair of triply-degenerate nodal\npoints (TNPs). The nodal ring here is distinct from the previously studied ones\nin that its formation requires four entangled bands, not just two as in\nprevious cases, hence it is termed as a four-band nodal ring (FNR). Remarkably,\nwe show that FNR features Dirac-cone-like surface states, in contrast to the\nusual drumhead surface states for two-band nodal rings. Due to the presence of\ninversion symmetry, the TNP here is also different from those discussed\npreviously in inversion-asymmetric systems. Especially, when spin-orbit\ncoupling is included, the TNP here transforms into a novel Dirac point that is\nclose to the borderline between the type-I and type-II Dirac point categories.\nWe discuss their respective symmetry protections, and construct effective\nmodels for their characterization. The large linear energy range (> 2 eV) in\nthese materials should facilitate the experimental detection of the signatures\nof these nontrivial band crossings.\n", "  As we enter the era of gravitational wave astronomy, we are beginning to\ncollect observations which will enable us to explore aspects of astrophysics of\nmassive stellar binaries which were previously beyond reach. In this paper we\ndescribe COMPAS (Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics and\nStatistics), a new platform to allow us to deepen our understanding of isolated\nbinary evolution and the formation of gravitational-wave sources. We describe\nthe computational challenges associated with their exploration, and present\npreliminary results on overcoming them using Gaussian process regression as a\nsimulation emulation technique.\n", "  Neutral hydrogen clouds are known to exist in the Universe, however their\nspatial distributions and physical properties are poorly understood. Such\nmissing information can be studied by the new generation Chinese radio\ntelescopes through a blind searching of 21-cm absorption systems. We forecast\nthe capabilities of surveys of 21-cm absorption systems by two representative\nradio telescopes in China -- Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio\nTelescope (FAST) and Tianlai 21-cm cosmology experiment (Tianlai). Facilitated\nby either the high sensitivity (FAST) or the wide field of view (Tianlai) of\nthese telescopes, more than a thousand 21-cm absorption systems can be\ndiscovered in a few years, representing orders of magnitude improvement over\nthe cumulative discoveries in the past half a century.\n", "  We use exact diagonalization to study the quantum phases and phase\ntransitions when a single species of fermionic atoms at Landau level filling\nfactor $\\nu_f = 1$ in a rotating trap interact through a p-wave Feshbach\nresonance. We show that under weak pairing interaction, the system undergoes a\nsecond order quantum phase transition from $\\nu_{f} = 1$ fermionic integer\nquantum Hall (FIQH) state at positive detuning, to $\\nu_{b} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nbosonic fractional quantum Hall (BFQH) state at negative detuning. However,\nwhen the pairing interaction increases, a new phase between them emerges,\ncorresponding to a fraction of fermionic atoms stay in a coherent superposition\nof bosonic molecule state and an unbound pair. The phase transition from FIQH\nphase to the new phase is of second order and that from the new phase to BFQH\nphase is of first order.\n", "  We compute the net electric current generated during a first order\nelectroweak phase transition when fermions transit from the false to the true\nvacuum. This current is generated by the CP-violating fermion interaction with\nthe Higgs during the phase transition and is quantified in terms of a\nCP-violating phase in the bubble wall separating the symmetric from the\nsymmetry-broken phases. We comment on the seed magnetic field that this current\nis able to generate and it is possible implications for magnetogenesis in the\nearly universe during the electroweak phase transition.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the transit timing variations displayed by the\nextrasolar planet Kepler-410Ab. We obtained and improved orbital and physical\nparameters for the planet and analysed 70 transit times obtained by the Kepler\nsatellite. In our analysis of the O-C diagram (Observed-Calculated), we assumed\nthat the observed changes in the transit times are probably caused by the\ngravitational influence of another body in the system. To determine the mass of\nthe perturbing body, we have considered the light-time effect and an analytical\napproximation of the perturbation model. The solutions resulting from both\nmethods give comparable results, with an orbital period $P_3\\sim$970 days and a\nslightly eccentric orbit of the third body. We also showed that this orbit is\nnearly coplanar with the orbit of the Neptune-like planet Kepler-410Ab (orbital\nperiod 17.8 days). We propose two possible models for the perturbing body\norbiting a common barycentre with Kepler-410A: (i) a single star with mass at\nleast 0.906 M$_{\\odot}$, (ii) a binary star with the total mass of its\ncomponents of at least 2.15 M$_{\\odot}$. In both cases the star Kepler-410B is\non a long orbit (period more than 2200 years). Small amplitude variations\n($\\sim$ 5-8 minutes) detected in O-C residuals can be explained by the stellar\nactivity of the host star (spots and pulsations), which affects the shape of\nthe light curve during the transit. The presence of single or binary companion\nof mentioned masses heavily affects the total observed flux from the system.\nAfter removing of the flux contamination from Kepler-410A light curve we found\nthat radius of the transiting planet Kepler-410Ab should be in the range from\nabout 3.7 to 4.2 R$_{\\oplus}$.\n", "  In the last few years, integrated optics (IO) beam combiners have facilitated\nthe emergence of 4-telescope interferometers such as PIONIER or GRAVITY,\nboosting the imaging capabilities of the VLTI. However, the spectral range\nbeyond 2.2microns is not ideally covered by the conventional silica based IO.\nHere, we propose to consider new laser-written IO prototypes made of GLS\nglasses, a material that permits access to the mid-infrared spectral regime.\nOur goal is to conduct a full characterization of our mid-IR IO 2-telescope\ncoupler in order to measure the performance levels directly relevant for\nlong-baseline interferometry. We focus in particular on the exploitation of the\nL and M astronomical bands. We use a dedicated Michelson-interferometer setup\nto perform Fourier Transform spectroscopy on the coupler and measure its\nbroadband interferometric performance. We also analyze the polarization\nproperties of the coupler, the differential dispersion and phase degradation as\nwell as the modal behavior and the total throughput. We measure broadband\ninterferometric contrasts of 94.9% and 92.1% for unpolarized light in the L and\nM bands. Spectrally integrated splitting ratios are close to 50% but show\nchromatic dependence over the considered bandwidths. Additionally, the phase\nvariation due to the combiner is measured and does not exceed 0.04rad and\n0.07rad across the band L and M band, respectively. The total throughput of the\ncoupler including Fresnel and injection losses from free-space is 25.4%. The\nlaser-written IO GLS prototype combiners prove to be a reliable technological\nsolution with promising performance for mid-infrared long-baseline\ninterferometry. In the next steps, we will consider more advanced optical\nfunctions as well as a fiber-fed input and revise the optical design parameters\nin order the further enhance the total throughput and achromatic behavior.\n", "  Aims: Changes of the magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocities in the\nphotosphere are being reported for an M-class flare that originated at a\n$\\delta$-spot belonging to active region NOAA 11865.\n  Methods: High-resolution ground-based near-infrared spectropolarimetric\nobservations were acquired simultaneously in two photospheric spectral lines,\nFe I 10783 \\AA\\ and Si I 10786 \\AA, with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at\nthe Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) in Tenerife on 2013 October 15. The\nobservations covered several stages of the M-class flare. Inversions of the\nfull-Stokes vector of both lines were carried out and the results were put into\ncontext using (extreme)-ultraviolet filtergrams from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO).\n  Results: The active region showed high flaring activity during the whole\nobserving period. After the M-class flare, the longitudinal magnetic field did\nnot show significant changes along the polarity inversion line (PIL). However,\nan enhancement of the transverse magnetic field of approximately 550 G was\nfound that bridges the PIL and connects umbrae of opposite polarities in the\n$\\delta$-spot. At the same time, a newly formed system of loops appeared\nco-spatially in the corona as seen in 171 \\AA\\ filtergrams of the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO. However, we cannot exclude that the\nmagnetic connection between the umbrae already existed in the upper atmosphere\nbefore the M-class flare and became visible only later when it was filled with\nhot plasma. The photospheric Doppler velocities show a persistent upflow\npattern along the PIL without significant changes due to the flare.\n  Conclusions: The increase of the transverse component of the magnetic field\nafter the flare together with the newly formed loop system in the corona\nsupport recent predictions of flare models and flare observations.\n", "  Determining the velocity distribution of halo stars is essential for\nestimating the mass of the Milky Way and for inferring its formation history.\nSince the stellar halo is a dynamically hot system, the velocity distribution\nof halo stars is well described by the 3-dimensional velocity dispersions\n$(\\sigma_r, \\sigma_\\theta, \\sigma_\\phi)$, or by the velocity anisotropy\nparameter $\\beta=1-(\\sigma_\\theta^2+\\sigma_\\phi^2)/(2\\sigma_r^2)$. Direct\nmeasurements of $(\\sigma_r, \\sigma_\\theta, \\sigma_\\phi)$ consistently suggest\n$\\beta =0.5$-$0.7$ for nearby halo stars. In contrast, the value of $\\beta$ at\nlarge Galactocentric radius $r$ is still controversial, since reliable proper\nmotion data are available for only a handful of stars. In the last decade,\nseveral authors have tried to estimate $\\beta$ for distant halo stars by\nfitting the observed line-of-sight velocities at each radius with simple\nvelocity distribution models (local fitting methods). Some results of local\nfitting methods imply $\\beta<0$ at $r \\gtrsim 20 \\;\\rm{kpc}$, which is\ninconsistent with recent predictions from cosmological simulations. Here we\nperform mock-catalogue analyses to show that the estimates of $\\beta$ based on\nlocal fitting methods are reliable only at $r \\leq 15 \\;\\rm{kpc}$ with the\ncurrent sample size ($\\sim10^3$ stars at a given radius). As $r$ increases, the\nline-of-sight velocity (corrected for the Solar reflex motion) becomes\nincreasingly closer to the Galactocentric radial velocity, so that it becomes\nincreasingly more difficult to estimate tangential velocity dispersion\n$(\\sigma_\\theta, \\sigma_\\phi)$ from line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our\nresults suggest that the forthcoming Gaia data will be crucial for\nunderstanding the velocity distribution of halo stars at $r \\geq 20\\;\\rm{kpc}$.\n", "  A new algorithm is developed allowing the Monte Carlo study of a 1 + 1\ndimensional theory in real time. The main algorithmic development is to avoid\nthe explicit calculation of the Jacobian matrix and its determinant in the\nupdate process. This improvement has a wide applicability and reduces the cost\nof the update in thimble-inspired calculations from O(N^3) to less than O(N^2).\nAs an additional feature, the algorithm leads to improved Monte Carlo\nproposals. We exemplify the use of the algorithm to the real time dynamics of a\nscalar {\\phi}^4 theory with weak and strong couplings.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological insulators host surface states with linear\ndispersion, which manifest as a Dirac cone. Nanoscale transport measurements\nprovide direct access to the transport properties of the Dirac cone in real\nspace and allow the detailed investigation of charge carrier scattering. Here,\nwe use scanning tunnelling potentiometry to analyse the resistance of different\nkinds of defects at the surface of a (Bi0.53Sb0.47)2Te3 topological insulator\nthin film. The largest localized voltage drop we find to be located at domain\nboundaries in the topological insulator film, with a resistivity about four\ntimes higher than that of a step edge. Furthermore, we resolve resistivity\ndipoles located around nanoscale voids in the sample surface. The influence of\nsuch defects on the resistance of the topological surface state is analysed by\nmeans of a resistor network model. The effect resulting from the voids is found\nto be small compared to the other defects.\n", "  A key goal of the Stage IV dark energy experiments Euclid, LSST and WFIRST is\nto measure the growth of structure with cosmic time from weak lensing analysis\nover large regions of the sky. Weak lensing cosmology will be challenging: in\naddition to highly accurate galaxy shape measurements, statistically robust and\naccurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimates for billions of faint\ngalaxies will be needed in order to reconstruct the three-dimensional matter\ndistribution. Here we present an overview of and initial results from the\nComplete Calibration of the Color-Redshift Relation (C3R2) survey, designed\nspecifically to calibrate the empirical galaxy color-redshift relation to the\nEuclid depth. These redshifts will also be important for the calibrations of\nLSST and WFIRST. The C3R2 survey is obtaining multiplexed observations with\nKeck (DEIMOS, LRIS, and MOSFIRE), the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC; OSIRIS),\nand the Very Large Telescope (VLT; FORS2 and KMOS) of a targeted sample of\ngalaxies most important for the redshift calibration. We focus spectroscopic\nefforts on under-sampled regions of galaxy color space identified in previous\nwork in order to minimize the number of spectroscopic redshifts needed to map\nthe color-redshift relation to the required accuracy. Here we present the C3R2\nsurvey strategy and initial results, including the 1283 high confidence\nredshifts obtained in the 2016A semester and released as Data Release 1.\n", "  Galactic star formation scaling relations show increased scatter from kpc to\nsub-kpc scales. Investigating this scatter may hold important clues to how the\nstar formation process evolves in time and space. Here, we combine different\nmolecular gas tracers, different star formation indicators probing distinct\npopulations of massive stars, and knowledge on the evolutionary state of each\nstar forming region to derive star formation properties of $\\sim$150 star\nforming complexes over the face of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find that the\nrate of massive star formation ramps up when stellar clusters emerge and boost\nthe formation of subsequent generations of massive stars. In addition, we\nreveal that the star formation efficiency of individual GMCs declines with\nincreasing cloud gas mass ($M_\\mathrm{cloud}$). This trend persists in Galactic\nstar forming regions, and implies higher molecular gas depletion times for\nlarger GMCs.\n  We compare the star formation efficiency per freefall time\n($\\epsilon_\\mathrm{ff}$) with predictions from various widely-used analytical\nstar formation models. We show that while these models can produce large\ndispersions in $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{ff}$ similar to observations, the origin of\nthe model-predicted scatter is inconsistent with observations. Moreover, all\nmodels fail to reproduce the observed decline of $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{ff}$ with\nincreasing $M_\\mathrm{cloud}$ in the LMC and the Milky Way. We conclude that\nanalytical star formation models idealizing global turbulence levels, cloud\ndensities, and assuming a stationary SFR are inconsistent with observations\nfrom modern datasets tracing massive star formation on individual cloud scales.\nInstead, we reiterate the importance of local stellar feedback in shaping the\nproperties of GMCs and setting their massive star formation rate.\n", "  We calculate moment of inertia of neutron star with different exotic\nconstituents such as hyperons and (anti)kaon condensates and study its\nvariation with mass and spin frequency. The sets of equation of state,\ngenerated within the framework of relativistic mean field model with\ndensity-dependent couplings are adopted for the purpose. We follow the\nquasi-stationary evolution of rotating stars along the constant rest mass\nsequences, that varies considerably with different constituents in the equation\nof state. We also explore the universal relations associated with some of the\nnormalised properties, such as critical mass and moment of inertia for specific\nEoS or as a matter of fact constituents of the dense matter. Deviations in the\nuniversal relations for moment of inertia are observed at higher compactness.\nThis study presents important results concerning the properties of neutron\nstars, that could be observationally verified in the near future using Square\nKilometer Array telescope.\n", "  We report on large thermoelectric effects in superconductor-ferromagnet\ntunnel junctions in proximity contact with the ferromagnetic insulator europium\nsulfide. The combination of a spin-splitting field and spin-polarized tunnel\nconductance in these systems breaks the electron-hole symmetry and leads to\nspin-dependent thermoelectric currents. We show that the exchange splitting\ninduced by the europium sulfide boosts the thermoelectric effect in small\napplied fields and can therefore eliminate the need to apply large magnetic\nfields, which might otherwise impede applications in thermometry or cooling.\n", "  We report the results of three Chandra observations covering most of the\nextent of the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1616-508 and a search for a lower\nenergy counterpart to this source. We detect 56 X-ray sources, of which 37 have\ncounterparts at lower frequencies, including a young massive star cluster, but\nnone of them appears to be a particularly promising counterpart to the TeV\nsource. The brightest X-ray source, CXOU J161423.4-505738 with a flux of\n5x10^{-13} c.g.s. in the 0.5-7.0 keV band, has a hard spectrum that is well fit\nby a power-law model with a photon index of 0.2+/-0.3 and is a likely\nintermediate polar CV candidate. No counterparts of this source were detected\nat other wavelengths. CVs are not known to produce extended TeV emission, and\nthe source is also largely offset (19') from HESS J1616-508, making them\nunlikely to be associated. We have also set an upper limit on the X-ray flux of\nPSR J1614-5048 in the 0.5-8 keV band (F<5x10^{-15} c.g.s. at a 90% confidence\nlevel). This makes PSR J1614-5048 one of the least X-ray efficient pulsars\nknown, with an X-ray efficiency {\\eta}=L_x/Edot < 2x10^{-5} in the 0.5-8 keV\nband. We find no evidence supporting the association between the pulsar and the\nTeV source. We rule out a number of X-ray sources as possible counterparts to\nthe TeV emission and do not find a plausible counterpart among the other\nsources. Lastly, we discuss the possible relation of PSR J1617-5055 to HESS\nJ1616-508 in light of the new observations.\n", "  We compare the existent methods including the minimum spanning tree based\nmethod and the local stellar density based method, in measuring mass\nsegregation of star clusters. We find that the minimum spanning tree method\nreflects more the compactness, which represents the global spatial distribution\nof massive stars, while the local stellar density method reflects more the\ncrowdedness, which provides the local gravitational potential information. It\nis suggested to measure the local and the global mass segregation\nsimultaneously. We also develop a hybrid method that takes both aspects into\naccount. This hybrid method balances the local and the global mass segregation\nin the sense that the predominant one is either caused either by dynamical\nevolution or purely accidental, especially when such information is unknown a\npriori. In addition, we test our prescriptions with numerical models and show\nthe impact of binaries in estimating the mass segregation value. As an\napplication, we use these methods on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)\nobservations and the Taurus cluster. We find that the ONC is significantly mass\nsegregated down to the 20th most massive stars. In contrast, the massive stars\nof the Taurus cluster are sparsely distributed in many different subclusters,\nshowing a low degree of compactness. The massive stars of Taurus are also found\nto be distributed in the high-density region of the subclusters, showing\nsignificant mass segregation at subcluster scales. Meanwhile, we also apply\nthese methods to discuss the possible mechanisms of the dynamical evolution of\nthe simulated substructured star clusters.\n", "  Fast radio bursts, or FRBs, are transient sources of unknown origin. Recent\nradio and optical observations have provided strong evidence for an\nextragalactic origin of the phenomenon and the precise localization of the\nrepeating FRB 121102. Observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA) and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) have revealed the existence\nof a continuum non-thermal radio source consistent with the location of the\nbursts in a dwarf galaxy. All these new data rule out several models that were\npreviously proposed, and impose stringent constraints to new models. We aim to\nmodel FRB 121102 in light of the new observational results in the active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) scenario. We propose a model for repeating FRBs in which\na non-steady relativistic $e^\\pm$-beam, accelerated by an impulsive\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-driven mechanism, interacts with a cloud at the\ncentre of a star-forming dwarf galaxy. The interaction generates regions of\nhigh electrostatic field called cavitons in the plasma cloud. Turbulence is\nalso produced in the beam. These processes, plus particle isotropization, the\ninteraction scale, and light retardation effects, provide the necessary\ningredients for short-lived, bright coherent radiation bursts. The mechanism\nstudied in this work explains the general properties of FRB 121102, and may\nalso be applied to other repetitive FRBs. Coherent emission from electrons and\npositrons accelerated in cavitons provides a plausible explanation of FRBs.\n", "  SS~433 is an X-ray binary and the source of sub-relativistic, precessing,\nbaryonic jets. We present high-resolution spectrograms of SS 433 in the\ninfrared H and K bands. The spectrum is dominated by hydrogen and helium\nemission lines. The precession phase of the emission lines from the jet\ncontinues to be described by a constant period, P_jet= 162.375 d. The limit on\nany secularly changing period is $|\\dot P| \\lesssim 10^{-5}$. The He I 2.0587\nmicron line has complex and variable P Cygni absorption features produced by an\ninhomogeneous wind with a maximum outflow velocity near 900 km/s. The He II\nemission lines in the spectrum also arise in this wind. The higher members of\nthe hydrogen Brackett lines show a double-peaked profile with symmetric wings\nextending more than +/-1500 km/s from the line center. The lines display radial\nvelocity variations in phase with the radial velocity variation expected of the\ncompact star, and they show a distortion during disk eclipse that we interpret\nas a rotational distortion. We fit the line profiles with a model in which the\nemission comes from the surface of a symmetric, Keplerian accretion disk around\nthe compact object. The outer edge of the disk has velocities that vary from\n110 to 190 km/s. These comparatively low velocities place an important\nconstraint on the mass of the compact star: Its mass must be less than 2.2\nM_solar and is probably less than 1.6 M_solar.\n", "  The Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G028.23-00.19 hosts a massive (1,500 Msun),\ncold (12 K), and 3.6-70 um IR dark clump (MM1) that has the potential to form\nhigh-mass stars. We observed this prestellar clump candidate with the SMA\n(~3.5\" resolution) and JVLA (~2.1\" resolution) in order to characterize the\nearly stages of high-mass star formation and to constrain theoretical models.\nDust emission at 1.3 mm wavelength reveals 5 cores with masses <15 Msun. None\nof the cores currently have the mass reservoir to form a high-mass star in the\nprestellar phase. If the MM1 clump will ultimately form high-mass stars, its\nembedded cores must gather a significant amount of additional mass over time.\nNo molecular outflows are detected in the CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) transitions,\nsuggesting that the SMA cores are starless. By using the NH3 (1,1) line, the\nvelocity dispersion of the gas is determined to be transonic or mildly\nsupersonic (DeltaV_nt}/DeltaV_th ~1.1-1.8). The cores are not highly supersonic\nas some theories of high-mass star formation predict. The embedded cores are 4\nto 7 times more massive than the clump thermal Jeans mass and the most massive\ncore (SMA1) is 9 times less massive than the clump turbulent Jeans mass. These\nvalues indicate that neither thermal pressure nor turbulent pressure dominates\nthe fragmentation of MM1. The low virial parameters of the cores (0.1-0.5)\nsuggest that they are not in virial equilibrium, unless strong magnetic fields\nof ~1-2 mG are present. We discuss high-mass star formation scenarios in a\ncontext based on IRDC G028.23-00.19, a study case believed to represent the\ninitial fragmentation of molecular clouds that will form high-mass stars.\n", "  While studying supersymmetric $G$-gauge theories, one often observes that a\nzero-radius limit of the twisted partition function $\\Omega^G$ is computed by\nthe partition function ${\\cal Z}^G$ in one less dimensions. We show that this\ntype of identification fails generically due to integrations over Wilson lines.\nTracing the problem, physically, to saddles with reduced effective theories, we\nrelate $\\Omega^G$ to a sum of distinct ${\\cal Z}^H$'s and classify the latter,\ndubbed $H$-saddles. This explains why, in the context of pure Yang-Mills\nquantum mechanics, earlier estimates of the matrix integrals ${\\cal Z}^{G}$ had\nfailed to capture the recently constructed bulk index ${\\cal I}^G_{\\rm bulk}$.\nThe purported agreement between 4d and 5d instanton partition functions,\ndespite such subtleties also present in the ADHM data, is explained.\n", "  While the notion of open quantum systems is itself old, most of the existing\nstudies deal with quantum mechanical systems rather than quantum field\ntheories. After a brief review of field theoretical/path integral tools\ncurrently available to deal with open quantum field theories, we go on to apply\nthese tools to an open version of $\\phi^3$ + $\\phi^4$ theory in four spacetime\ndimensions and demonstrate its one loop renormalizability (including the\nrenormalizability of the Lindblad structure).\n", "  We study winds in 12 X-ray AGN host galaxies at z ~ 1. We find, using the\nlow-ionization Fe II 2586 absorption in the stacked spectra, that the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of the centroid velocity shift in AGN\nhas a median, 16th and 84th percentiles of (-87, -251, +86) km/s respectively.\nThe PDF of the velocity dispersion in AGN has a median, 84th and 16th\npercentile of (139, 253, 52) km/s respectively. The centroid velocity and the\nvelocity dispersions are obtained from a two component (ISM+wind) absorption\nline model. The equivalent width PDF of the outflow in AGN has median, 84th and\n16th percentiles of (0.4, 0.8, 0.1) Angstrom. There is a strong ISM component\nin Fe II 2586 absorption with (1.2, 1.5, 0.8) Angstrom, implying presence of\nsubstantial amount cold gas in the host galaxies. For comparison, star-forming\nand X-ray undetected galaxies at a similar redshift, matched roughly in stellar\nmass and galaxy inclination, have a centroid velocity PDF with percentiles of\n(-74, -258, +90) km/s, and a velocity dispersion PDF percentiles of (150, 259,\n57) km/s. Thus, winds in the AGN are similar to star-formation-driven winds,\nand are too weak to escape and expel substantial cool gas from galaxies. Our\nsample doubles the previous sample of AGN studied at z ~ 0.5 and extends the\nanalysis to z ~ 1. A joint reanalysis of the z ~ 0.5 AGN sample and our sample\nyields consistent results to the measurements above.\n", "  Planets are thought to form via accretion from a remnant disk of gas and\nsolids around a newly formed star. During this process material in the disk\neither remains bound to the star as part of either a planet, a smaller\ncelestial body, or makes up part of the interplanetary medium; falls into the\nstar; or is ejected from the system. Herein we use dynamical models to probe\nthe abundance and properties of ejected material during late-stage planet\nformation and estimate their contribution to the free-floating planet\npopulation. We present 300 N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation\naround a solar-type star, with and without giant planets present, using a model\nthat accounts for collisional fragmentation. In simulations with Jupiter and\nSaturn analogs, about one-third of the initial (~5 Mearth) disk mass is\nejected, about half in planets more massive than Mercury but less than 0.3\nMearth, and the remainder in smaller bodies. Most ejections occur within 25\nMyr, which is shorter than the timescale typically required for Earth-mass\nplanets to grow (30-100 Myr). When giant planets are omitted from our\nsimulations, almost no material is ejected within 200 Myr and only about 1% of\nthe initial disk is ejected by 2 Gyr. We show that about 2.5 terrestrial-mass\nplanets are ejected per star in the Galaxy. We predict that the space-borne\nmicrolensing search for free-floating planets from the Wide-Field Infra-Red\nSpace Telescope (WFIRST) will discover up to 15 Mars-mass planets, but few\nfree-floating Earth-mass planets.\n", "  The ages of the components in very short period pre-main sequence (PMS)\nbinaries are essential to an understanding of their formation. We considered a\nsample of 7 PMS eclipsing binaries (EBs) with ages 1 to 6.3 MY and component\nmasses 0.2 to 1.4 Msun The very high precision with which their masses and\nradii have been measured, and the capability provided by the {\\it Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)} to calculate their evolutionary\ntracks at exactly the measured masses, allows the determination of age\ndifferences of the components independent of their luminosities and effective\ntemperatures. We found that the components of 5 EBs, ASAS J052821+0338.5,\nParenago 1802, JW 380, CoRoT 223992193, and UScoCTIO 5, formed within 0.3 MY of\neach other. The parameters for the components of V1174 Ori, imply an\nimplausible large age difference of 2.7 MY and should be reconsidered. The 7th\nEB in our sample, RX J0529.4+0041 fell outside the applicability of our\nanalysis.\n", "  We present results based on the observations of the blazar 3C 66A from 2005\nNovember 06 to 2016 February 14 in the BVR and I broadbands using 1.2m\ntelescope of the Mt. Abu InfraRed Observatory (MIRO). The source was observed\non 160 nights out of which on 89 nights it was monitored for more than 1 hr to\ncheck for the presence of any intra-day variability (IDV). The blazar 3C 66A\nexhibited significant variations in the optical flux on short and long term\ntime scales. However, unlike highly variable S5 0716+71, it showed IDV duty\ncycle of about 8% only. Our statistical studies suggest the IDV time scales\nranging from $\\sim$ 37 min to about 3.12 hours and, in one case, a possibility\nof the quasi-periodic variations with characteristic timescale of $\\sim$ 1.4\nhrs. The IDV amplitudes in R$-$band were found to vary from 0.03 mag to as much\nas 0.6 mag, with larger amplitude of variation when the source was relatively\nfainter. The typical rate of the flux variation was estimated to be $\\sim$0.07\nmag hr$^{-1}$ in both, the rising and the falling phases. However, the rates of\nthe brightness variation as high as 1.38 mag/hr were also detected. The\nshortest timescale of the variation, 37 min, sets an upper limit of $6.92\n\\times 10^{14}$ cm on the size of the emission region and about $3.7 \\times\n10^8\\ \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ as an estimate of the mass of the black hole,\nassuming the origin of the rapid optical variability is in close vicinity of\nthe central SMBH. The long-term study suggests a mild bluer-when-brighter\nbehavior, typical for BL Lacs.\n", "  Upcoming HI surveys will deliver such large datasets that automated\nprocessing using the full 3-D information to find and characterize HI objects\nis unavoidable. Full 3-D visualization is an essential tool for enabling\nqualitative and quantitative inspection and analysis of the 3-D data, which is\noften complex in nature. Here we present $\\tt{SlicerAstro}$, an open-source\nextension of 3DSlicer, a multi-platform open source software package for\nvisualization and medical image processing, which we developed for the\ninspection and analysis of HI spectral line data. We describe its initial\ncapabilities, including 3-D filtering, 3-D selection and comparative modelling.\n", "  Boson stars, self-gravitating objects made of a complex scalar field, have\nbeen proposed as simple models for very different scenarios, ranging from\ngalaxy dark matter to black hole mimickers. Here we focus on a very compact\ntype of boson stars to study binary mergers by varying different parameters,\nnamely the phase shift, the direction of rotation and the angular momentum. Our\naim is to investigate the properties of the object resulting from the merger in\nthese different scenarios by means of numerical evolutions. These simulations,\nperformed by using a modification of the covariant conformal Z4 (CCZ4)\nformalism of the Einstein Equations that does not require the algebraic\nenforcing of any constraint, indicate that the final state after a head-on\ncollision of low mass boson stars is another boson star. However, almost\ncomplete annihilation of the stars occurs during the merger of a\nboson-antiboson pair. The merger of orbiting boson stars form a rotating bar\nthat quickly relaxes to a non-rotating boson star.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of the multiferroic quantum-spin\nsystem LiCu$_2$O$_2$ by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements at $X$- and\n$Q$-band frequencies in a wide temperature range $(T_{\\rm N1} \\leq T \\leq\n300$\\,K). The observed anisotropies of the $g$ tensor and the ESR linewidth in\nuntwinned single crystals result from the crystal-electric field and from local\nexchange geometries acting on the magnetic Cu$^{2+}$ ions in the zigzag-ladder\nlike structure of LiCu$_2$O$_2$. Supported by a microscopic analysis of the\nexchange paths involved, we show that both the symmetric anisotropic exchange\ninteraction and the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction provide the\ndominant spin-spin relaxation channels in this material.\n", "  This study investigates the ultraslow diffusion by a spatial structural\nderivative, in which the exponential function exp(x)is selected as the\nstructural function to construct the local structural derivative diffusion\nequation model. The analytical solution of the diffusion equation is a form of\nBiexponential distribution. Its corresponding mean squared displacement is\nnumerically calculated, and increases more slowly than the logarithmic function\nof time. The local structural derivative diffusion equation with the structural\nfunction exp(x)in space is an alternative physical and mathematical modeling\nmodel to characterize a kind of ultraslow diffusion.\n", "  The properties of disks around brown dwarfs and very-low mass stars\n(hereafter VLMOs) provide important boundary conditions on the process of\nplanet formation and inform us about the numbers and masses of planets than can\nform in this regime. We use the Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectrometer to\nmeasure the continuum and [OI] 63um line emission towards 11 VLMOs with known\ndisks in the Taurus and Chamaeleon I star-forming regions. We fit radiative\ntransfer models to the spectral energy distributions of these sources.\nAdditionally, we carry out a grid of radiative transfer models run in a regime\nthat connects the luminosity of our sources with brighter T~Tauri stars. We\nfind VLMO disks with sizes [1.3--78] au, smaller than typical T~Tauri disks,\nfit well the spectral energy distributions assuming disk geometry and dust\nproperties are stellar-mass independent. Reducing the disk size increases the\ndisk temperature and we show that VLMOs do not follow previously derived disk\ntemperature-stellar luminosity relationships if the disk outer radius scales\nwith stellar mass. Only 2 out of 11 sources are detected in [OI] despite a\nbetter sensitivity than was achieved for T Tauri stars, suggesting that VLMO\ndisks are underluminous. Using thermochemical models we show that smaller disks\ncan lead to the unexpected [OI] non-detections in our sample. The disk outer\nradius is an important factor in determining the gas and dust observables.\nHence, spatially resolved observations with ALMA -- to establish if and how\ndisk radii scale with stellar mass -- should be pursued further.\n", "  We present new theoretical period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations for\nRR Lyrae stars (RRL) at Spitzer and WISE wavelengths. The PLZ relations were\nderived using nonlinear, time-dependent convective hydrodynamical models for a\nbroad range in metal abundances (Z=0.0001 to 0.0198). In deriving the light\ncurves, we tested two sets of atmospheric models (Brott & Hauschildt 2005,\nCastelli & Kurucz 2003) and found no significant difference between the\nresulting mean magnitudes. We also compare our theoretical relations to\nempirical relations derived from RRL in both the field and in the globular\ncluster M4. Our theoretical PLZ relations were combined with multi-wavelength\nobservations to simultaneously fit the distance modulus, mu_0, and extinction,\nAv, of both the individual Galactic RRL and of the cluster M4. The results for\nthe Galactic RRL are consistent with trigonometric parallax measurements from\nGaia's first data release. For M4, we find a distance modulus of $\\mu_0=11.257\n\\pm 0.035$ mag with $A_V = 1.45 \\pm 0.12$ mag, which is consistent with\nmeasurements from other distance indicators. This analysis has shown that when\nconsidering a sample covering a range of iron abundances, the metallicity\nspread introduces a dispersion in the PL relation on the order of 0.13 mag.\nHowever, if this metallicity component is accounted for in a PLZ relation, the\ndispersion is reduced to ~0.02 mag at MIR wavelengths.\n", "  We present a study of the effective (half-light) radii and other structural\nproperties of a systematically selected sample of young, massive star clusters\n(YMCs, $\\geq$$5\\times10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $\\leq$200 Myr) in two nearby spiral\ngalaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 1313. We use Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS and\narchival ACS/WFC data obtained by the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS),\nan HST Treasury Program. We measure effective radii with GALFIT, a\ntwo-dimensional image-fitting package, and with a new technique to estimate\neffective radii from the concentration index (CI) of observed clusters. The\ndistribution of effective radii from both techniques spans $\\sim$0.5-10 pc and\npeaks at 2-3 pc for both galaxies. We find slight positive correlations between\neffective radius and cluster age in both galaxies, but no significant\nrelationship between effective radius and galactocentric distance. Clusters in\nNGC 1313 display a mild increase in effective radius with cluster mass, but the\ntrend disappears when the sample is divided into age bins. We show that the\nvast majority of the clusters in both galaxies are much older than their\ndynamical times, suggesting they are gravitationally bound objects. We find\nthat about half of the clusters in NGC 628 are underfilling their Roche lobes,\nbased on their Jacobi radii. Our results suggest that the young, massive\nclusters in NGC 628 and NGC 1313 are expanding due to stellar mass loss or\ntwo-body relaxation and are not significantly influenced by the tidal fields of\ntheir host galaxies.\n", "  This article reports the results of X-ray studies of the extended TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray source VER J2019+368. Suzaku observations conducted to examine\nproperties of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) around PSR J2021+3651 revealed\nthat the western region of the X-ray PWN has a source extent of $15' \\times\n10'$ with the major axis oriented to that of the TeV emission. The PWN-west\nspectrum was closely fitted by a power-law for absorption at $N({\\rm H}) =\n(8.2^{+1.3}_{-1.1}) \\times 10^{21}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$ and a photon index of $\\Gamma\n= 2.05\\pm0.12$, with no obvious change in the index within the X-ray PWN. The\nmeasured X-ray absorption indicates that the distance to the source is much\nless than $10~{\\rm kpc}$ inferred by radio data. Aside from the PWN, no\nextended emission was observed around PSR J2021+3651 even by Suzaku. Archival\ndata from the XMM-Newton were also analyzed to complement the Suzaku\nobservations, indicating that the eastern region of the X-ray PWN has a similar\nspectrum ($N(\\rm H)=(7.5 \\pm 0.9) \\times 10^{21}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$ and\n$\\Gamma=2.03 \\pm 0.10$) and source extent up to at least $12'$ along the major\naxis. The lack of significant change in the photon index and the source extent\nin X-ray are used to constrain the advection velocity or the diffusion\ncoefficient for accelerated X-ray-producing electrons. A mean magnetic field of\n${\\sim}3~\\mu{\\rm G}$ is required to account for the measured X-ray spectrum and\nreported TeV $\\gamma$-ray spectrum. A model calculation of synchrotron\nradiation and inverse Compton scattering was able to explain ${\\sim}80\\%$ of\nthe reported TeV flux, indicating that the X-ray PWN is a major contributor of\nVER J2019+368.\n", "  Present-day semi-empirical models of solar irradiance (SI) variations employ\nspectra computed on one-dimensional atmosphere models (1D models)\nrepresentative of various solar surface features to reconstruct SI changes\nmeasured on timescales greater than a day. Various recent studies have,\nhowever, pointed out that the spectra synthesized on 1D models do not reflect\nthe radiative emission of the inhomogenous atmosphere revealed by\nhigh-resolution solar observations. We aimed to derive observational-based\natmospheres from such observations and test their accuracy for SI estimates. We\nanalysed spectro-polarimetric data of the Fe I 630 nm line pair on photospheric\nregions representative of the granular, quiet Sun pattern (QS) and of small-\nand large-scale magnetic features, both bright and dark with respect to the QS.\nThe data were taken on 2011 August 6, with the CRISP at the Swedish Solar\nTelescope, under excellent seeing conditions. We derived atmosphere models of\nthe observed regions from data inversion with the SIR code. We studied the\nsensitivity of results to spatial resolution and temporal evolution, and\ndiscussed the obtained atmospheres with respect to several 1D models. The\natmospheres derived from our study agree well with most of the compared 1D\nmodels, both qualitatively and quantitatively (differences are within 10%), but\nfor pore regions. Spectral synthesis computations on the atmosphere obtained\nfrom the QS observations return SI between 400 nm and 2400 nm that agrees, on\naverage, within 2.2% with standard reference measurements, and within -0.14%\nwith the SI computed on the quiet Sun atmosphere employed by the most advanced\nsemi-empirical model of SI variations.\n", "  We present the analysis of high-resolution optical spectra of four transits\nof 55Cnc e, a low-density, super-Earth that orbits a nearby Sun-like star in\nunder 18 hours. The inferred bulk density of the planet implies a substantial\nenvelope, which, according to mass-radius relationships, could be either a\nlow-mass extended or a high-mass compact atmosphere. Our observations\ninvestigate the latter scenario, with water as the dominant species. We take\nadvantage of the Doppler cross-correlation technique, high-spectral resolution\nand the large wavelength coverage of our observations to search for the\nsignature of thousands of optical water absorption lines. Using our\nobservations with HDS on the Subaru telescope and ESPaDOnS on the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we are able to place a 3-sigma lower limit of\n10 g/mol on the mean-molecular weight of 55Cnc e's water-rich (volume mixing\nratio >10%), optically-thin atmosphere, which corresponds to an atmospheric\nscale-height of ~80 km. Our study marks the first high-spectral resolution\nsearch for water in a super-Earth atmosphere and demonstrates that it is\npossible to recover known water-vapour absorption signals, in a nearby\nsuper-Earth atmosphere, using high-resolution transit spectroscopy with current\nground-based instruments.\n", "  New eclipse timings of the Z Cam-type dwarf nova AY Psc were measured and the\norbital ephemeris was revised. Based on the long-term AAVSO data, moreover, the\noutburst behaviors were also explored. Our analysis suggests that the normal\noutbursts are quasi-periodic, with an amplitude of $\\sim2.5(\\pm0.1)$ mag and a\nperiod of $\\sim18.3(\\pm0.7)$ days. The amplitude vs. recurrence-time relation\nof AY Psc is discussed, and we concluded that this relation may represents\ngeneral properties of dwarf nova (DN) outbursts. The observed standstill ends\nwith an outburst, which is inconsistent with the general picture of Z Cam-type\nstars. This unusual behavior was considered to be related to the mass-transfer\noutbursts. Moreover, the average luminosity is brighter during standstills than\nduring outburst cycles. The changes in brightness marks the variations in\n$\\dot{M}_{2}$ due to the disc of AY Psc is nearly steady state. $\\dot{M}_{2}$\nvalue was limited to the range from $6.35\\times10^{-9}$ to\n$1.18\\times10^{-8}M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. More detailed examination shows that there\nare a few small outbursts presence during standstills. These events with\namplitudes of $\\sim0.5-0.9$ mag are very similar to the stunted outbursts\nreported in some NLs. We discussed several possible mechanisms and suggested\nthat the most reasonable mechanism for these stunted outbursts is a changing\nmass-transfer rate.\n", "  The formation of deuterated molecules is favoured at low temperatures and\nhigh densities. Therefore, the deuteration fraction D$_{frac}$ is expected to\nbe enhanced in cold, dense prestellar cores and to decrease after protostellar\nbirth. Previous studies have shown that the deuterated forms of species such as\nN2H+ (formed in the gas phase) and CH3OH (formed on grain surfaces) can be used\nas evolutionary indicators and to constrain their dominant formation processes\nand time-scales. Formaldehyde (H2CO) and its deuterated forms can be produced\nboth in the gas phase and on grain surfaces. However, the relative importance\nof these two chemical pathways is unclear. Comparison of the deuteration\nfraction of H2CO with respect to that of N2H+, NH3 and CH3OH can help us to\nunderstand its formation processes and time-scales. With the new SEPIA Band 5\nreceiver on APEX, we have observed the J=3-2 rotational lines of HDCO and D2CO\nat 193 GHz and 175 GHz toward three massive star forming regions hosting\nobjects at different evolutionary stages: two High-mass Starless Cores (HMSC),\ntwo High-mass Protostellar Objects (HMPOs), and one Ultracompact HII region\n(UCHII). By using previously obtained H2CO J=3-2 data, the deuteration\nfractions HDCO/H2CO and D2CO/HDCO are estimated. Our observations show that\nsingly-deuterated H2CO is detected toward all sources and that the deuteration\nfraction of H2CO increases from the HMSC to the HMPO phase and then sharply\ndecreases in the latest evolutionary stage (UCHII). The doubly-deuterated form\nof H2CO is detected only in the earlier evolutionary stages with D2CO/H2CO\nshowing a pattern that is qualitatively consistent with that of HDCO/H2CO,\nwithin current uncertainties. Our initial results show that H2CO may display a\nsimilar D$_{frac}$ pattern as that of CH3OH in massive young stellar objects.\nThis finding suggests that solid state reactions dominate its formation.\n", "  We report precise mass and density measurements of two extremely hot\nsub-Neptune-size planets from the K2 mission using radial velocities, K2\nphotometry, and adaptive optics imaging. K2-66 harbors a close-in\nsub-Neptune-sized (2.49$^{+0.34}_{-0.24} R_\\oplus$) planet (K2-66b) with a mass\nof 21.3 $\\pm$ 3.6 $M_\\oplus$. Because the star is evolving up the sub-giant\nbranch, K2-66b receives a high level of irradiation, roughly twice the main\nsequence value. K2-66b may reside within the so-called \"photoevaporation\ndesert\", a domain of planet size and incident flux that is almost completely\ndevoid of planets. Its mass and radius imply that K2-66b has, at most, a meager\nenvelope fraction (< 5%) and perhaps no envelope at all, making it one of the\nlargest planets without a significant envelope. K2-106 hosts an\nultra-short-period planet ($P$ = 13.7 hrs) that is one of the hottest\nsub-Neptune-size planets discovered to date. Its radius (1.82$^{+0.20}_{-0.14}\nR_\\oplus$) and mass (9.0 $\\pm$ 1.6 $M_\\oplus$) are consistent with a rocky\ncomposition, as are all other small ultra-short-period planets with\nwell-measured masses. K2-106 also hosts a larger, longer-period planet (Rp =\n2.77$^{+0.37}_{-0.23} R_\\oplus$, $P$ = 13.3 days) with a mass less than 24.4\n$M_\\oplus$ at 99.7% confidence. K2-66b and K2-106b probe planetary physics in\nextreme radiation environments. Their high densities reflect the challenge of\nretaining a substantial gas envelope in such extreme environments.\n", "  We investigate the star formation properties of a large sample of ~2300\nX-ray-selected Type 2 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) host galaxies out to z~3 in\nthe Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey in order to understand the connection between\nthe star formation and nuclear activity. Making use of the existing\nmulti-wavelength photometric data available in the COSMOS field, we perform a\nmulti-component modeling from far-infrared to near-ultraviolet using a nuclear\ndust torus model, a stellar population model and a starburst model of the\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs). Through detailed analysis of SEDs, we\nderive the stellar masses and the star formation rates (SFRs) of Type 2 AGN\nhost galaxies. The stellar mass of our sample is in the range 9 < log\nM_{stellar}/M_{\\odot} < 12 with uncertainties of ~0.19 dex. We find that Type 2\nAGN host galaxies have, on average, similar SFRs compared to the normal\nstar-forming galaxies with similar M_{stellar} and redshift ranges, suggesting\nno significant evidence for enhancement or quenching of star formation. This\ncould be interpreted in a scenario, where the relative massive galaxies have\nalready experienced substantial growth at higher redshift (z>3), and grow\nslowly through secular fueling processes hosting moderate-luminosity AGNs.\n", "  We modeled the radio non-detection of two Type Ia supernovae (SNe) 2011fe and\n2014J considering synchrotron emission from the interaction between SN ejecta\nand the circumstellar medium. For an ejecta with the outer part having a power\nlaw density structure we compare synchrotron emission with radio observations.\nAssuming that 20$\\%$ of the bulk shock energy is being shared equally between\nelectrons and magnetic fields we found a very low density medium around both\nthe SNe. A less tenuous medium with particle density $\\sim$ 1 $\\rm cm^{-3}$,\nwhich could be expected around both SNe, can be estimated when the magnetic\nfield amplification is less than that presumed for energy equipartition. This\nconclusion also holds if the progenitor of SN 2014J was a rigidly rotating\nwhite dwarf (WD) with a main sequence (MS) or red giant companion. For a He\nstar companion, or a MS for SN 2014J, with 10$\\%$ and 1$\\%$ of bulk kinetic\nenergy in magnetic fields, we obtain a mass loss rate $< 10^{-9}$ and $< \\sim\n4\\times 10^{-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for a wind velocity of 100 km/s. The\nformer requires a mass accretion efficiency $>$ 99$\\%$ onto the WD, but is less\nrestricted for the latter case. However, if the tenuous medium is due to a\nrecurrent nova it is difficult from our model to predict synchrotron\nluminosities. Although the formation channels of SNe 2011fe and 2014J are not\nclear, the null detection in radio wavelengths could point toward a low\namplification efficiency for magnetic fields in SN shocks.\n", "  Although it is well known that all quantum states can be produced by single\nqubit measurements on the cluster states, it is not a simple task to explicitly\nfind which measurement patterns on the cluster states can generate different\nquantum states. In this paper we introduce a general scheme to find measurement\npatterns corresponding to different topological CSS states containing Kitaev's\ntoric code states and color code states on different lattices and in different\ndimensions. Furthermore, we find a measurement pattern for generating non\nabelian anyons where measurement induced defects on a toric code state play the\nrole of Ising anyons. We also support our scheme by a graphical notation where,\nby following a few simple graphical transformations, one will be able to\nconvert a CSS topological state to a cluster state. Our scheme can be also used\nfor experimental realization of anyons on cluster states.\n", "  In this article, we present a gravitational collapse null dust solution of\nthe Einstein field equations. The spacetime is regular everywhere except on the\nsymmetry axis where it possesses a naked curvature singularity, and admits one\nparameter isometry group, a generator of axial symmetry along the cylinder\nwhich has closed orbits. The space- time admits closed timelike curves (CTCs)\nwhich develop at some particular moment in a causally well-behaved manner and\nmay represent a Cosmic Time Machine. The radial geodesics near to the\nsingularity, and the gravitational Lensing (GL) will be discussed. The physical\ninterpretation of this solution, based on the study of the equation of the\ngeodesic deviation, will be presented. It was demonstrated that, this solution\ndepends on the local gravitational field consisting of two components with\namplitude $\\Psi_2$, $\\Psi_4$.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a fascinating platform\nfor room-temperature quantum photonics due to the discovery of robust visible\nlight single-photon emitters. In order to utilize these emitters, it is\nnecessary to have a clear understanding of their atomic structure and the\nassociated excitation processes that give rise to this single photon emission.\nHere we perform density-functional theory (DFT) and constrained DFT\ncalculations for a range of hBN point defects in order to identify potential\nemission candidates. By applying a number of criteria on the electronic\nstructure of the ground state and the atomic structure of the excited states of\nthe considered defects, and then calculating the Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, we\nfind that the CBVN defect, in which a carbon atom substitutes a boron atom and\nthe opposite nitrogen atom is removed, is a potential emission source with a HR\nfactor of 1.66, in good agreement with the experimental HR factor. We calculate\nthe photoluminescence (PL) line shape for this defect and find that it\nreproduces a number of key features in the the experimental PL lineshape.\n", "  Bilayered Sr3Ru2O7 is an unusual metamagnetic metal with inherently\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations. Partial\nsubstitution of Ru by Mn results in the establishment of metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT) at TMIT and AFM ordering at TM in Sr3(Ru1-xMnx)2O7. Using\nelastic neutron scattering we determined the effect of Mn doping on the\nmagnetic structure and in-plane magnetic correlation lengths in\nSr3(Ru1-xMnx)2O7 (x = 0.06 and 0.12). With increasing Mn doping (x) from 0.06\nto 0.12 or decreasing temperatures for x=0.12, an evolution from an in-plane\nshort-range to long-range double-stripe AFM ground state occurs. For both\ncompounds, the onset of magnetic correlation with an anisotropic behavior\ncoincides with the sharp rise of the electrical resistivity and the specific\nheat. Since it does not induce measurable lattice distortion, the double-stripe\nmagnetic order with anisotropic spin texture breaks the symmetry from C4v\ncrystal lattice to C2v magnetic sublattice. These observations shed new light\non an age-old question of Slater versus Mott-type MIT.\n", "  The Aubry unpinned--pinned transition in the sliding of two incommensurate\nlattices occurs for increasing mutual interaction strength in one dimension\n($1D$) and is of second order at $T=0$, turning into a crossover at nonzero\ntemperatures. Yet, real incommensurate lattices come into contact in two\ndimensions ($2D$), at finite temperature, generally developing a mutual\nNovaco-McTague misalignment, conditions in which the existence of a sharp\ntransition is not clear. Using a model inspired by colloid monolayers in an\noptical lattice as a test $2D$ case, simulations show a sharp Aubry transition\nbetween an unpinned and a pinned phase as a function of corrugation. Unlike\n$1D$, the $2D$ transition is now of first order, and, importantly, remains well\ndefined at $T>0$. It is heavily structural, with a local rotation of moir\\'e\npattern domains from the nonzero initial Novaco-McTague equilibrium angle to\nnearly zero. In the temperature ($T$) -- corrugation strength ($W_0$) plane,\nthe thermodynamical coexistence line between the unpinned and the pinned phases\nis strongly oblique, showing that the former has the largest entropy. This\nfirst-order Aubry line terminates with a novel critical point $T=T_c$, marked\nby a susceptibility peak. The expected static sliding friction upswing between\nthe unpinned and the pinned phase decreases and disappears upon heating from\n$T=0$ to $T=T_c$. The experimental pursuit of this novel scenario is proposed.\n", "  The search for habitable exoplanets and life beyond the Solar System is one\nof the most compelling scientific opportunities of our time. Nevertheless, the\nhigh cost of building facilities that can address this topic and the keen\npublic interest in the results of such research requires the rigorous\ndevelopment of experiments that can deliver a definitive advance in our\nunderstanding. Most work to date in this area has focused on a \"systems\nscience\" approach of obtaining and interpreting comprehensive data for\nindividual planets to make statements about their habitability and the\npossibility that they harbor life. This strategy is challenging because of the\ndiversity of exoplanets, both observed and expected, and the limited\ninformation that can be obtained with astronomical instruments. Here we propose\na complementary approach that is based on performing surveys of key planetary\ncharacteristics and using statistical marginalization to answer broader\nquestions than can be addressed with a small sample of objects. The fundamental\nprinciple of this comparative planetology approach is maximizing what can be\nlearned from each type of measurement by applying it widely rather than\nrequiring that multiple kinds of observations be brought to bear on a single\nobject. As a proof of concept, we outline a survey of terrestrial exoplanet\natmospheric water and carbon dioxide abundances that would test the habitable\nzone hypothesis and lead to a deeper understanding of the frequency of\nhabitable planets. We also discuss ideas for additional surveys that could be\ndeveloped to test other foundational hypotheses is this area.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of Dirac magneto-plasmons in topological\ninsulator nanowires. We discuss a cylindrical geometry where Berry phase\neffects induce the opening of a gap at the neutrality point. By taking into\naccount surface electron wave functions introduced in previous papers and\nwithin the random phase approximation, we provide an analytical form of the\ndynamic structure factor. Dispersions and spectral weights of Dirac plasmons\nare studied with varying the radius of the cylinder, the surface doping, and\nthe strength of an external magnetic field. We show that, at zero surface\ndoping, inter-band damped plasmon-like excitations form at the surface and\nsurvive at low electron surface dopings ($\\sim 10^{10} cm^{-2} $). Then, we\npoint out that the plasmon excitations are sensitive to the Berry phase gap\nclosure when an external magnetic field close to half quantum flux is\nintroduced. Indeed, a well-defined magneto-plasmon peak is observed at lower\nenergies upon the application of the magnetic field. Finally, the increase of\nthe surface doping induces a crossover from damped inter-band to sharp\nintra-band magneto-plasmons which, as expected for large radii and dopings\n($\\sim 10^{12} cm^{-2}$), approach the proper limit of a two-dimensional\nsurface.\n", "  Single photon emitters with narrow linewidths are highly sought after for\napplications in quantum information processing and quantum communications. In\nthis letter, we report on a bright, highly polarized near infrared single\nphoton emitter embedded in diamond nanocrystals with a narrow, sub GHz optical\nlinewidths at 10K. The observed zero phonon line at ~ 780 nm is optically\nstable under low power resonant excitation and blue shifts as the excitation\npower increases. Our results highlight the prospect for using new near infrared\ncolor centers in nanodiamonds for quantum applications.\n", "  We present the results of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations of gamma-ray bright blazar S5 0716+714 using the Korean VLBI\nNetwork (KVN) at the 22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz bands, as part of the\nInterferometric Monitoring of Gamma-ray Bright AGNs (iMOGABA) KVN key science\nprogram. Observations were conducted in 29 sessions from January 16, 2013 to\nMarch 1, 2016, with the source being detected and imaged at all available\nfrequencies. In all epochs, the source was compact on the milliarcsecond (mas)\nscale, yielding a compact VLBI core dominating the synchrotron emission on\nthese scales. Based on the multi-wavelength data between 15 GHz (Owens Valley\nRadio Observatory) and 230 GHz (Submillimeter Array), we found that the source\nshows multiple prominent enhancements of the flux density at the centimeter\n(cm) and millimeter (mm) wavelengths, with mm enhancements leading cm\nenhancements by -16$\\pm$8 days. The turnover frequency was found to vary\nbetween 21 to 69GHz during our observations. By assuming a synchrotron\nself-absorption model for the relativistic jet emission in S5 0716+714, we\nfound the magnetic field strength in the mas emission region to be $\\le$5 mG\nduring the observing period, yielding a weighted mean of 1.0$\\pm$0.6 mG for\nhigher turnover frequencies (e.g., >45 GHz).\n", "  Based on a sample of over 1,800 radio AGN at redshifts out to z~5, which have\ntypical stellar masses within ~3x(10^{10}-10^{11}) Msol, and 3 GHz radio data\nin the COSMOS field, we derived the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions for\nradio AGN (L_1.4GHz ~ 10^{22}-10^{27} W/Hz) out to z~5. We constrained the\nevolution of this population via continuous models of pure density and pure\nluminosity evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of\nPhi*~(1+z)^{(2.00+/-0.18)-(0.60+/-0.14)z}, and\nL*~(1+z)^{(2.88+/-0.82)-(0.84+/-0.34)z}, respectively, with a turnover in\nnumber and luminosity densities of the population at z~1.5. We converted 1.4\nGHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking uncertainties of the scaling\nrelation used into account. We thereby derived the cosmic evolution of the\nkinetic luminosity density provided by the AGN and compared this luminosity\ndensity to the radio-mode AGN feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy\nEvolution (SAGE) model, i.e., to the redshift evolution of the central\nsupermassive black hole accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source\nof heating that offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and\nthereby limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that\nthe kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to balance\nthe radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since z~5. However,\nalthough our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN feedback as a\ncosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy formation, many\nsimplifications in both the observational and semi-analytic approaches still\nremain and need to be resolved before robust conclusions can be reached.\n", "  Using MUSE on the ESO-VLT, we obtained a 4 hour exposure of the z=3.12 radio\ngalaxy MRC0316-257. We detect features down to ~10^-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 with\nthe highest surface brightness regions reaching more than a factor of 100\nhigher. We find Ly-alpha emission out to ~250 kpc in projection from the active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). The emission shows arc-like morphologies arising at\n150-250 kpc from the nucleus in projection with the connected filamentary\nstructures reaching down into the circum-nuclear region. The most distant arc\nis offset by 700 km/s relative to circum-nuclear HeII 1640 emission, which we\nassume to be at the systemic velocity. As we probe emission closer to the\nnucleus, the filamentary emission narrows in projection on the sky, the\nrelative velocity decreases to ~250 km/s, and line full-width at half maximum\nrange from 300-700 km/s. From UV line ratios, the emission on scales of 10s of\nkpc from the nucleus along a wide angle in the direction of the radio jets is\nclearly excited by the radio jets and ionizing radiation of the AGN. Assuming\nionization equilibrium, the more extended emission outside of the axis of the\njet direction would require 100% or more illumination to explain the observed\nsurface brightness. High speed (>300 km/s) shocks into rare gas would provide\nsufficiently high surface brightness. We discuss the possibility that the arcs\nof Ly-alpha emission represent accretion shocks and the filamentary emission\nrepresent gas flows into the halo, and compare our results with gas accretion\nsimulations.\n", "  A simple model is constructed based on the gauge symmetry $SU(3)_c \\times\nSU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y \\times SU(2)_\\ell$, with only the leptons transforming\nnontrivially under $SU(2)_\\ell$. The extended symmetry is broken down to the\nStandard Model gauge group at TeV-scale energies. We show that this model\nprovides a mechanism for baryogenesis via leptogenesis in which the lepton\nnumber asymmetry is generated by $SU(2)_\\ell$ instantons. The theory also\ncontains a dark matter candidate - the $SU(2)_\\ell$ partner of the right-handed\nneutrino.\n", "  Concordance $\\Lambda$CDM universe is the simplest model that is consistent\nwith a large variety of cosmological observations till date. But few recent\nobservations indicate inconsistencies in $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we\nconsider the combination of recent SnIa+Bao+Cmb+Growth+$H(z)$+$H_{0}$\nmeasurements to revisit the constraints on the dark energy evolution using the\nwidely studied CPL parametrisation for the dark energy equation of state.\nAlthough the reconstructed behaviour for the dark energy equation of state\nconfirms the inconsistency of $\\Lambda$CDM at $95\\%$ confidence level, the\nreconstructed $Om$ diagnostic which is a {\\it null test} for $\\Lambda$CDM,\nstill allows the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour with a lower range of\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ than that obtained by Planck-2015. {\\it This confirms that\n$\\Lambda$CDM is still the best choice for the dark energy model}. We also\nmeasure the parameter $S = \\sigma_{8}\\sqrt{\\Omega_{m0}/0.3} = 0.728 \\pm 0.023$\nwhich is consistent with its recent measurement by KiDS survey. The confidence\ncontour in the $\\Omega_{m0}-\\sigma_{8}$ parameter plane is also fully\nconsistent with KiDS survey measurement.\n", "  We calculate the gauge invariant cumulants (and moments) associated with the\nZak phase in the Rice-Mele model. We reconstruct the underlying probability\ndistribution by maximizing the information entropy and applying the moments as\nconstraints. When the Wannier functions are localized within one unit cell, the\nprobability distribution so obtained corresponds to that of the Wannier\nfunction. We show that in the fully dimerized limit the magnitude of the\nmoments are all equal. In this limit, if the on-site interaction is decreased\ntowards zero, the distribution shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,\nbut the overall shape of the distribution remains the same. Away from this\nlimit, if alternate hoppings are finite, and the on-site interaction is\ndecreased, the distribution also shifts towards the midpoint of the unit cell,\nbut it does this by changing shape, by becoming asymmetric around the maximum,\nas well as by shifting. We also follow the probability distribution of the\npolarization in cycles around the topologically non-trivial point of the model.\nThe distribution moves across to the next unit cell, its shape distorting\nconsiderably in the process. If the radius of the cycle is large, the shift of\nthe distribution is accompanied by large variations in the maximum.\n", "  Studying the dynamics of filaments at pre-eruption phase can shed light on\nthe precursor of eruptive events. Such studies in high-resolution (in the order\nof 0.1\") are highly desirable yet very rare so far. In this work, we present a\ndetailed observation of a pre-eruption evolution of a filament obtained by the\n1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). One end\nof the filament is anchored at the sunspot in NOAA active region (AR) 11515,\nwhich is well observed by NST H$\\alpha$ off-bands four hours before till one\nhour after the filament eruption. A M1.6 flare is associated with the eruption.\nWe observed persistent downflowing materials along the H$\\alpha$ multi-threaded\ncomponent of the loop towards the AR end during the pre-eruption phase. We\ntraced the trajectories of plasma blobs along the H$\\alpha$ threads and\nobtained the plane-of-sky velocity of 45 km s$^{-1}$ on average. We further\nestimated the real velocities of the downflows and the altitude of the filament\nby matching the observed H$\\alpha$ threads with magnetic field lines\nextrapolated from a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model. Observation of\nchromospheric brightenings (BZs) at the footpoints of the falling plasma blobs\nis also presented in the paper. The lower limit of the kinetic energy per\nsecond of the downflows through the BZs is found to be $\\sim$ 10$^{21}$ erg.\nLarger FOV observations from BBSO full disk H$\\alpha$ images show that the AR\nend of the filament started ascending four hours before the flare. We attribute\nthe observed downflows at the AR end of the filament to the draining effect of\nthe filament rising prior to its eruption. During the slow-rise phase, the\ndownflows continuously drained away $\\sim$ 10$^{15}$g mass from the filament\nover a few hours, which is believed to be essential for the instability at\nlast, and could be an important precursor of eruptive events.\n", "  We perform controlled N-body simulations of disc galaxies growing within live\ndark matter (DM) haloes to present-day galaxies that contain both thin and\nthick discs. We consider two types of models: a) thick-disc initial conditions\nto which stars on near-circular orbits are continuously added over ~10 Gyr and\nb) models in which the birth velocity dispersion of stars decreases\ncontinuously over the same time-scale. We show that both schemes produce\ndouble-exponential vertical profiles similar to that of the Milky Way (MW). We\nindicate how the spatial age structure of galaxies can be used to discriminate\nbetween scenarios. We show that the presence of a thick disc significantly\nalters and delays bar formation and thus makes possible models with a realistic\nbar and a high baryon-to-DM mass ratio in the central regions, as required by\nmicrolensing constraints. We examine how the radial mass distribution in stars\nand DM is affected by disc growth and non-axisymmetries. We discuss how bar\nbuckling shapes the vertical age distribution of thin- and thick-disc stars in\nthe bar region. The extent to which the combination of observationally\nmotivated inside-out growth histories and cosmologically motivated dark halo\nproperties leads to the spontaneous formation of non-axisymmetries that steer\nthe models towards present-day MW-like galaxies is noteworthy.\n", "  Aims. Our new program with HARPS aims to detect mean motion resonant\nplanetary systems around stars which were previously reported to have a single\nbona fide planet, often based only on sparse radial velocity data. Methods.\nArchival and new HARPS radial velocities for the K2V star HD 27894 were\ncombined and fitted with a three-planet self-consistent dynamical model. The\nbest-fit orbit was tested for long-term stability. Results. We find clear\nevidence that HD 27894 is hosting at least three massive planets. In addition\nto the already known Jovian planet with a period $P_{\\rm b}$ $\\approx$ 18 days\nwe discover a Saturn-mass planet with $P_{\\rm c}$ $\\approx$ 36 days, likely in\na 2:1 mean motion resonance with the first planet, and a cold massive planet\n($\\approx$ 5.3 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$) with a period $P_{\\rm d}$ $\\approx$ 5170\ndays on a moderately eccentric orbit ($e_{\\rm d}$ = 0.39). Conclusions. HD\n27894 is hosting a massive, eccentric giant planet orbiting around a tightly\npacked inner pair of massive planets likely involved in an asymmetric 2:1 mean\nmotion resonance. HD 27894 may be an important milestone for probing planetary\nformation and evolution scenarios.\n", "  Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has robust feature in suppressing\ncontrol errors because of its holonomic feature. However, this kind of robust\nfeature is challenged since the usual way of realizing nonadiabatic holonomic\ngates introduces errors due to systematic errors in the control parameters. To\nresolve this problem, we here propose a composite scheme to realize\nnonadiabatic holonomic gates. Our scheme can suppress systematic errors while\npreserving holonomic robustness. It is particularly useful when the evolution\nperiod is shorter than the coherence time. We further show that our composite\nscheme can be protected by decoherence-free subspaces. In this case, the\nstrengthened robust feature of our composite gates and the coherence\nstabilization virtue of decoherence-free subspaces are combined.\n", "  In this paper, we study the development of anisotropy in strong MHD\nturbulence in the presence of a large scale magnetic field B 0 by analyzing the\nresults of direct numerical simulations. Our results show that the developed\nanisotropy among the different components of the velocity and magnetic field is\na direct outcome of the inverse cascade of energy of the perpendicular velocity\ncomponents u? and a forward cascade of the energy of the parallel component u k\n. The inverse cascade develops for a strong B0, where the flow exhibits a\nstrong vortical structure by the suppression of fluctuations along the magnetic\nfield. Both the inverse and the forward cascade are examined in detail by\ninvestigating the anisotropic energy spectra, the energy fluxes, and the shell\nto shell energy transfers among different scales.\n", "  Geometrical and topological phases play a fundamental role in quantum theory.\nGeometric phases have been proposed as a tool for implementing unitary gates\nfor quantum computation. A fractional topological phase has been recently\ndiscovered for bipartite systems. The dimension of the Hilbert space determines\nthe topological phase of entangled qudits under local unitary operations. Here\nwe investigate fractional topological phases acquired by photonic entangled\nqudits. Photon pairs prepared as spatial qudits are operated inside a Sagnac\ninterferometer and the two-photon interference pattern reveals the topological\nphase as fringes shifts when local operations are performed. Dimensions $d = 2,\n3$ and $4$ were tested, showing the expected theoretical values.\n", "  Electron tomography has been studied in various fields. Various methods have\nbeen developed to align projection sets to construct ideally focused\nreconstruction. In this paper, we present how to align the projection set to\ndistinguish whether it has an ideal sinogram pattern or not by removing\ntranslation errors and vertical tilt errors. We also analyze some important\nproperties for certain types of samples to identify whether the reconstruction\nimage can be made through an ideal sinogram pattern. We provide a guideline for\nhow to construct a better reconstruction image by scanning the sample through\nthese properties.\n", "  A galaxy's orientation is one of its most basic observable properties.\nAstronomers once assumed that galaxies are randomly oriented in space, however\nit is now clear that some have preferred orientations with respect to their\nsurroundings. Chief among these are giant elliptical galaxies found in the\ncenters of rich galaxy clusters. Numerous studies have shown that the major\naxes of these galaxies often share the same orientation as the surrounding\nmatter distribution on larger scales. Using Hubble Space Telescope observations\nof 65 distant galaxy clusters, we show for the first time that similar\nalignments are seen at earlier epochs when the universe was only one-third its\ncurrent age. These results suggest that the brightest galaxies in clusters are\nthe product of a special formation history, one influenced by development of\nthe cosmic web over billions of years.\n", "  We outline a general procedure for simulating the surface brightness of\nastrophysical jets (and other astronomical objects) by post-processing gas\ndynamical simulations of densities and temperatures using spectral line\nemission data from the astrophysical spectral synthesis package {\\em Cloudy}.\nThen we validate the procedure by comparing the simulated surface brightness of\nthe HH~30 astrophysical jet in the forbidden [O~I], [N~II], and [S~II] doublets\nwith {\\em Hubble Space Telescope}\\/ observations of Hartigan and Morse and\nmultiple-ion magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Tesileanu et al. The general\ntrend of our simulated surface brightness in each doublet using the gas\ndynamical/{\\em Cloudy}\\/ approach is in excellent agreement with the\nobservational data.\n", "  The Bremermann-Bekenstein bound is a fundamental bound on the maximal rate\nwith which information can be transmitted. However, its derivation relies on\nrather weak estimates and plausibility arguments, which make the application of\nthe bound impractical in the laboratory. In this paper, we revisit the bound\nand extend its scope by explicitly accounting for the back action of quantum\nmeasurements and refined expressions of the quantum speed limit. Our result can\nbe interpreted as an upper bound on the maximal rate of quantum learning, and\nwe show that the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound follows as a particular limit. Our\nresults are illustrated, by first deriving a tractable expression from\ntime-dependent perturbation theory, and then evaluating the bound for two\ntime-dependent systems -- the harmonic oscillator and the P\\\"oschl-Teller\npotential.\n", "  This article is proposed to investigate the impacts of heat and mass transfer\nin magnetohydrodynamic casson fluid embedded in porous medium. The generalized\nsolutions have been traced out for the temperature distribution, mass\nconcentration and velocity profiles under the existence and non-existence of\ntransverse magnetic field, permeability and porosity. The corresponding\nsolutions of temperature distribution and mass concentration, velocity profiles\nare expressed in terms of newly defined generalized Robotnov-Hartley function,\nwright function and Mittage-Leffler function respectively. All the\ncorresponding solutions fulfill necessary conditions (initial, natural and\nboundary conditions) as well. Caputo Fractionalized solutions have been\nconverted for ordinary solutions by substituting {\\zeta}=1. Some similar\nsolutions for the temperature distribution, mass concentration and velocity\nprofiles have been particularized form generalized solutions. Owing to the\nrheology of problem, graphical illustrations of distinct parameters are\ndiscussed in detail by depicting figures using Mathcad software (15).\n", "  Many glass-formers exhibit phase transitions between two distinct liquid\nstates. For some metallic glass-formers, the liquid-liquid transition is\nexperimentally found in the supercooled liquid at intermediate temperature\nbetween the melting point and the glass transition temperature Tg. We report\nhere on a liquid-liquid transition in an ultra-viscous metallic glass-former,\naccessed during long-time annealing. This study is conducted on the\nAu49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 composition with a liquid-liquid transition\ntemperature slightly lower than Tg. The consequence is that the\nhigh-temperature kinetically fragile liquid freezes into the glass during\nconventional processing and the underlying liquid-liquid transition is thus\naccessed by the system during annealing below Tg. Upon reheating, the reverse\ntransformation is observed by calorimetry. This conclusion is supported by a\nbroad collection of complementary laboratory and synchrotron-based techniques,\nsuch as differential- and fast- scanning calorimetry, and x-ray photon\ncorrelation spectroscopy. Our findings support the big-picture proposed by\nAngell that liquids with different fragility occupy different flanks of an\nunderlying order-disorder transition. Furthermore, our multiscale analysis\nreveals the existence of multiple decays of the enthalpy recovery, which is\nreflected in the observed microscopic ordering and aging mechanism of the glass\nthrough distinct stationary regimes interconnected by abrupt dynamical aging\nregimes.\n", "  Increasing evidence suggests that cortical dynamics during wake exhibits\nlong-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended\nperiods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision-making and\nworking memory tasks. Accordingly, sleep has been suggested as a state\ncharacterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations; detailed measurements\nof neuronal timescales that support this view, however, have so far been\nlacking. Here we show that the long timescales measured at the individual\nneuron level in freely-behaving rats during the awake state are abrogated\nduring non-REM (NREM) sleep. We provide evidence for the existence of two\ndistinct states in terms of timescale dynamics in cortex: one which is\ncharacterized by long timescales which dominate during wake and REM sleep, and\na second one characterized by the absence of long-range temporal correlations\nwhich characterizes NREM sleep. We observe that both timescale regimes can\nco-exist and, in combination, lead to an apparent gradual decline of long\ntimescales during extended wake which is restored after sleep. Our results\nprovide a missing link between the observed long timescales in individual\nneuron fluctuations during wake and the reported absence of long-term\ncorrelations during deep sleep in EEG and fMRI studies. They furthermore\nsuggest a network-level function of sleep, to reorganize cortical networks\ntowards states governed by slow cortex dynamics to ensure optimal function for\nthe time awake.\n", "  We report on the result of a campaign to monitor 25 HATSouth candidates using\nthe K2 space telescope during Campaign 7 of the K2 mission. We discover\nHATS-36b (EPIC 215969174b), a hot Jupiter with a mass of 2.79$\\pm$0.40 M$_J$\nand a radius of 1.263$\\pm$0.045 R$_J$ which transits a solar-type G0V star\n(V=14.386) in a 4.1752d period. We also refine the properties of three\npreviously discovered HATSouth transiting planets (HATS-9b, HATS-11b, and\nHATS-12b) and search the K2 data for TTVs and additional transiting planets in\nthese systems. In addition we also report on a further three systems that\nremain as Jupiter-radius transiting exoplanet candidates. These candidates do\nnot have determined masses, however pass all of our other vetting observations.\nFinally we report on the 18 candidates which we are now able to classify as\neclipsing binary or blended eclipsing binary systems based on a combination of\nthe HATSouth data, the K2 data, and follow-up ground-based photometry and\nspectroscopy. These range in periods from 0.7 days to 16.7 days, and down to\n1.5 mmag in eclipse depths. Our results show the power of combining\nground-based imaging and spectroscopy with higher precision space-based\nphotometry, and serve as an illustration as to what will be possible when\ncombining ground-based observations with TESS data.\n", "  We developed and applied a computer analysis method to detect ring galaxy\ncandidates in the first data release of PanSTARRS. The method works by applying\na low-pass filter, followed by dynamic global thresholding to search for closed\nregions in the binary mask of each galaxy image. Applying the method to ~3*10^6\nPanSTARRS galaxy images produced a catalog of 185 ring galaxy candidates based\non their visual appearance.\n", "  How to calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) of\nExtreme-mass-ratio-inspirals (EMRIs) in a highly accurate and efficient way\nstill keeps a challenge. In this paper, we present a so-called fully\nrecalibrated waveforms for EMRIs with high accuracy. Based on the numerical\ndata by solving the Teukolsky equations, we recalibrate all mass-ratio\nindependent coefficients of the factorized waveforms which are used in the\neffective-one-body (EOB) models. Due to these new coefficients, the precision\nof waveforms is improved enormously, and is much higher than the original forms\nand at the same time higher than other existing calibration models. We believe\nour model will play an important role in the waveform-template construction of\nthe space-based GW detectors.\n", "  The precise nature of complex structural relaxation as well as an explanation\nfor the precipitous growth of relaxation time in cooling glass-forming liquids\nare essential to the understanding of vitrification of liquids. The dramatic\nincrease of relaxation time is believed to be caused by the growth of one or\nmore correlation lengths, which has received much attention recently. Here, we\nreport a direct link between the growth of a specific local-geometrical-order\nand an increase of dynamic-length-scale as the atomic dynamics in metallic\nglass-forming liquids slow down. Although several types of local\ngeometrical-orders are present in these metallic liquids, the growth of\nicosahedral ordering is found to be directly related to the increase of the\ndynamic-length-scale. This finding suggests an intriguing scenario that the\ntransient icosahedral ordering could be the origin of the dynamic-length-scale\nin metallic glass-forming liquids.\n", "  Highly precise weak lensing shear measurement is required for statistical\nweak gravitational lensing analysis such as cosmic shear measurement to achieve\nsevere constrain on the cosmological parameters. For this purpose any\nsystematic error in the measurement should be corrected. One of the main\nsystematic error comes from Pixel noise which is Poisson noise of flux from\natmosphere. We investigate how the pixel noise makes systematic error in shear\nmeasurement based on ERA method and develop the correction method. This method\nis tested by simulations with various conditions and it is confirmed that the\ncorrection method can correct $80 \\sim 90\\%$ of the systematic error except\nvery low signal to noise ratio galaxies.\n", "  The physical properties of single-crystalline SmBe$_{13}$ with a\nNaZn$_{13}$-type cubic structure have been studied by electrical resistivity\n($\\rho$), specific heat ($C$), and magnetization ($M$) measurements in magnetic\nfields of up to 9 T. The temperature ($T$) dependence of $\\rho$ shows normal\nmetallic behavior without showing the Kondo -ln$T$ behavior, suggesting the\nweak hybridization effect in this system. Analyses of the temperature\ndependence of $C$ suggest that the Sm ions of this compound are trivalent and\nthat the crystalline-electric-field (CEF) ground state is a $\\Gamma_8$ quartet\nwith a first-excited state of a $\\Gamma_7$ doublet located at the energy scale\nof $\\sim$ 90 K. Mean-field calculations based on the suggested CEF level scheme\ncan reasonably well reproduce the $T$ dependence of magnetic susceptibility\n($\\chi$) below $\\sim$ 70 K. These results in the paramagnetic state strongly\nindicate that the 4$f$ electrons are well localized with the Sm$^{3+}$\nconfiguration. At low temperatures, the 4$f$ electrons undergo a magnetic order\nat $T_{\\rm M}$ $\\sim$ 8.3 K, where $\\chi$($T$) shows an antiferromagnetic-like\ncusp anomaly. From the positive Curie--Weiss temperature obtained from the\nmean-field calculations and from a constructed magnetic phase diagram with\nmultiple regions, we discussed the magnetic structure of SmBe$_{13}$ below\n$T_{\\rm M}$, by comparing with other isostructural MBe$_{13}$ compounds showing\nhelical-magnetic ordering.\n", "  The Cu/Fe/Pd multilayers were transformed into L10-ordered FePdCu alloy by\npulsed laser annealing. The initial multilayers were irradiated with 1, 10,\n100, and 1000 laser pulses with duration time of 10 ns and energy density of\n235 mJ/cm2. The gradual change of the number of laser pulses allowed to\ninvestigate the structural and magnetic properties at early stages of the\ntransformation and L10-ordering processes. The measurements were carried out\nusing X-Ray Diffraction, SQUID magnetometry, and Magnetic Force Microscopy. We\nfound that L10 FePdCu (111)-oriented nanograins are formed by ordering of the\ncoherent domains present in the as-deposited multilayer. The irradiation does\nnot change the vertical size of the (111) crystallites. The L10 (002)-oriented\ngrains appear at the later stages of the transformation and their size\nincreases with the number of applied laser pulses. Additionally, the laser\nannealing induces the magnetic ordering of the irradiated material, which was\nobserved as an increase of the saturation magnetisation and the Curie\ntemperature with the rising number of pulses. We also observed, that\nirradiation with 1000 pulses leads to the loss of order, which is reflected in\nthe drop of the Curie temperature.\n", "  An integrable generalization of the super Kaup-Newell(KN) isospectral problem\nis introduced and its corresponding generalized super KN soliton hierarchy are\nestablished based on a Lie super-algebra B(0,1) and super-trace identity in\nthis paper. And the resulting super soliton hierarchy can be put into a super\nbi-Hamiltonian form. In addition, a generalized super KN soliton hierarchy with\nself-consistent sources is also presented.\n", "  New upper limit on a mixing parameter for hidden photons with a mass from 5\neV till 10 keV has been obtained from the results of measurements during 78\ndays in two configurations R1 and R2 of a multicathode counter. For a region of\na maximal sensitivity from 10 eV till 30 eV the upper limit obtained is less\nthan 4 x 10-11. The measurements have been performed at three temperatures:\n26C, 31C and 36C. A positive effect for the spontaneous emission of single\nelectrons has been obtained at the level of more than 7{\\sigma}. A falling\ntendency of a temperature dependence of the spontaneous emission rate indicates\nthat the effect of thermal emission from a copper cathode can be neglected.\n", "  We consider a dynamical method of storage of quantum states based on the\nspin-1/2 systems with the dipole-dipole interactions in a strong external\nmagnetic field { supplemented with the special time-reversion procedure}. The\nstored information can be extracted at certain time instants.\n", "  By developing the preceding work on the fast forward of transient phenomena\nof quantum tunneling by Khujakulov and Nakamura (Phys. Rev. {\\bf A 93}, 022101\n(2016) ), we propose a scheme of the exact fast forward of adiabatic control of\nstationary tunneling states with use of the electromagnetic field. The idea\nallows the acceleration of both the amplitude and phase of wave functions\nthroughout the fast-forward time range. The scheme realizes the fast-forward\nobservation of the transport coefficients under the adiabatically-changing\nbarrier with the fixed energy of an incoming particle. As typical examples we\nchoose systems with (1) Eckart's potential with tunable asymmetry and (2)\ndouble $\\delta$-function barriers under tunable relative height. We elucidate\nthe driving electric field to guarantee the stationary tunneling state during a\nrapid change of the barrier and evaluate both the electric-field-induced\ntemporary deviation of transport coefficients from their stationary values and\nthe modulation of the phase of complex scattering coefficients\n", "  The Be X-ray binary pulsar EXO 2030+375, first detected in 1985, has shown a\nsignificant detected X-ray outburst at nearly every periastron passage of its\n46-day orbit for the past ~25 years, with one low state accompanied by a torque\nreversal in the 1990s. In early 2015 the outbursts progressively became fainter\nand less regular while the monotonic spin-up flattened. At the same time a\ndecrease in the H$\\alpha$ line equivalent width was reported, indicating a\nchange in the disk surrounding the mass donor.\n  In order to explore the source behaviour in the poorly explored low-flux\nstate with a possible transition to a state of centrifugal inhibition of\naccretion we have undertaken an observing campaign with Swift/XRT, NuSTAR and\nthe Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). This conference contribution reports the\npreliminary results obtained from our campaign.\n", "  A brief survey is given of the dynamical phenomena accompanying the collapse\nof cavitation bubbles. The discussion includes shock waves, microjets and the\nvarious ways in which collapsing bubbles produce damage.\n", "  We describe an easy-to-implement technique that allows for a complete\nexperimental characterization of sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical\nfibers. Our method is based on a direct and fast numerical analysis of the\nbackward Brillouin spectrum measured using a highly sensitive single-ended\nheterodyne coherent detection. It can be performed in situ without any\nmanipulation nor optical alignment of optical microfibers. Sensitivity as high\nas a few nanometer for fiber diameter ranging from 500 nm to 1.2 micron is\nreported. This new method may help for the design and characterization of\noptical fiber tapers widely used in many applications such as optical sensing,\natom trapping, quantum optics, and plasmonics.\n", "  Inhomogeneous electric fields generated above two-dimensional electrode\nstructures have been used to transversely split beams of helium Rydberg atoms\ninto pairs of spatially separated components. The atomic beams had initial\nlongitudinal speeds of between 1700 and 2000 m/s and were prepared in Rydberg\nstates with principle quantum number $n=52$ and electric dipole moments of up\nto 8700 D by resonance-enhanced two-color two-photon laser excitation from the\nmetastable 1s2s $^3$S$_1$ level. Upon exiting the beam splitter the ensembles\nof Rydberg atoms were separated by up to 15.6 mm and were detected by pulsed\nelectric field ionization. Effects of amplitude modulation of the electric\nfields of the beam splitter were shown to cause particle losses through\ntransitions into unconfined Rydberg-Stark states.\n", "  Textbooks in applied mathematics often use graphs to explain the meaning of\nformulae, even though their benefit is still not fully explored. To test\nprocesses underlying this assumed multimedia effect we collected performance\nscores, eye movements, and think-aloud protocols from students solving problems\nin vector calculus with and without graphs. Results showed no overall\nmultimedia effect, but instead an effect to confirm statements that were\naccompanied by graphs, irrespective of whether these statements were true or\nfalse. Eye movement and verbal data shed light on this surprising finding.\nStudents looked proportionally less at the text and the problem statement when\na graph was present. Moreover, they experienced more mental effort with the\ngraph, as indicated by more silent pauses in thinking aloud. Hence, students\nactively processed the graphs. This, however, was not sufficient. Further\nanalysis revealed that the more students looked at the statement, the better\nthey performed. Thus, in the multimedia condition the graph drew students'\nattention and cognitive capacities away from focusing on the statement. A good\nalternative strategy in the multimedia condition was to frequently look between\ngraph and problem statement, and thus to integrate their information. In\nconclusion, graphs influence where students look and what they process, and may\neven mislead them into believing accompanying information. Thus, teachers and\ntextbook designers should be very critical on when to use graphs and carefully\nconsider how the graphs are integrated with other parts of the problem.\n", "  We explore the effects induced by a finite width in processes of pair\nproduction of a heavy top-quark partner and its subsequent decay into a bosonic\nDark Matter (DM) candidate -- either scalar or vector -- and a SM up-type quark\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We discuss the configurations of masses,\nwidths and couplings where this phenomenology can be important in a simple\nmodel with just one such objects. Finally, we emphasise the correct definition\nof signal and background to be adopted as well as stress the importance of new\ndedicated experimental searches.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of magnetic vortices in type II superconductors\nwith normal state pinning sites using the Ginzburg-Landau equations. Simulation\nresults demonstrate hopping of vortices between pinning sites, influenced by\nexternal magnetic fields and external currents. The system is highly nonlinear\nand the vortices show complex nonlinear dynamical behaviour.\n", "  The recent results on net-proton and net-charge multiplicity fluctuations\nfrom the beam energy scan program at RHIC have drawn much attention to explore\nthe critical point in the QCD phase diagram. Experimentally measured protons\ncontain contribution from various processes such as secondaries from higher\nmass resonance decay, production process, and protons from the baryon stopping.\nFurther, these contributions also fluctuate from event to event and can\ncontaminate the dynamical fluctuations due to the critical point. We present\nthe contribution of stopped proton and produced proton fluctuations in the\nnet-proton multiplicity fluctuation in \\auau collisions measured by STAR\nexperiment at RHIC. The produced net-proton multiplicity fluctuations using\ncumulants and their ratios are studied as a function collision energies. After\nremoving the stopped proton contribution from the inclusive proton multiplicity\ndistribution, a non-monotonic behavior is even more pronounced in the\nnet-proton fluctuations around \\sqsn = 19.6 GeV, both in $S\\sigma$ and\n$\\kappa\\sigma^2$. The present study will be useful to understand the\nfluctuations originating due to critical point.\n", "  We have identified two channels for the formation of compact dwarf galaxies\nin the Illustris simulation by reconstructing mass and distance histories of\ncandidates located in the vicinity of the simulation's most massive cluster\ngalaxies. One channel is tidal stripping of Milky Way mass galaxies that form\noutside of clusters and eventually sink into them, spiraling in toward central\nmassive objects. Second channel of formation is an in-situ formation (in\nreference to the parent cluster) of dwarf mass galaxies, with negligible\nevolution and limited change in stellar mass. We find 19 compact dwarf galaxies\nat the centers of 14 clusters, consistent with observations. 30% of them have\nexternal origin while 70% are formed in-situ.\n", "  The collective phenomena are observed not only in heavy ion collisions, but\nalso in the proton-nucleus and in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions. The latest\nresults from this area obtained in ATLAS are presented. In $p$+Pb collisions\nthe emission source of particles is measured using the HBT method. The analysis\nof $p$+Pb data collected in 2016 provides information on the elliptic flow of\ncharged hadrons and muons. Low multiplicity events from $pp$, $p$+Pb and\nperipheral Pb+Pb collisions are studied with the cumulant methods. A deeper\nunderstanding of Pb+Pb collisions is provided by the analysis of longitudinal\nfluctuations of the collective flow parameters.\n", "  The $T$-matrix, often obtained with Waterman's extended boundary condition\nmethod (EBCM), is a widely-used tool for fast calculations of electromagnetic\nscattering by particles. Here we investigate the quasistatic or long-wavelength\nlimit of this approach, where it reduces to an electrostatics problem. We first\npresent a fully electrostatic version of the EBCM/T-matrix method (dubbed\nES-EBCM). Explicit expressions are then given to quantitatively express the\nlong-wavelength limit of the EBCM matrix elements in terms of those of the\nES-EBCM formalism. From this connection we deduce a number of symmetry\nproperties of the ES-EBCM matrices. We then investigate the matrix elements of\nthe ES-EBCM formalism in the special case of prolate spheroids. Using the\ngeneral electrostatic solution in spheroidal coordinates, we derive fully\nanalytic expressions (in the form of finite sums) for all matrix elements.\nThose can be used for example for studies of the convergence of the $T$-matrix\nformalism. We illustrate this by discussing the validity of the Rayleigh\nhypothesis, where analytical expressions highlight clearly the link with\nanalytical continuation of series.\n", "  We analyse disc heating and radial migration in N-body models of growing disc\ngalaxies with thick and thin discs. Similar to thin-disc-only models, galaxies\nwith appropriate non-axisymmetric structures reproduce observational\nconstraints on radial disc heating in and migration to the Solar Neighbourhood\n(Snhd). The presence of thick discs can suppress non-axisymmetries and thus\nhigher baryonic-to-dark matter fractions are required than in models that only\nhave a thin disc. Models that are baryon-dominated to roughly the Solar radius\nR_0 are favoured, in agreement with data for the Milky Way. For inside-out\ngrowing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards\nmigrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators\ndepends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.\nThere is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars\nborn in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the\nfading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0. Our models compare well to Snhd\nkinematics from RAVE-TGAS. For such comparisons it is important to take into\naccount the azimuthal variation of kinematics at R ~ R_0 and biases from survey\nselection functions. The vertical heating of thin disc stars by giant molecular\nclouds is only mildly affected by the presence of thick discs. Our models\npredict higher vertical velocity dispersions for the oldest stars than found in\nthe Snhd age-velocity dispersion relation, possibly because of measurement\nuncertainties or an underestimation of the number of old cold stars in our\nmodels.\n", "  The n-type tensile-strained Ge can be used as high-efficient light-emitting\nmaterials. To reveal the influence of n-type doping on the electronic structure\nof Ge, we have computed the electronic structure of P, As and Sb doped Ge using\nfirst-principles calculation and band unfolding technique. We find that these\nn-type doping can induce both indirect and direct band gap narrowing, which\nwell reproduce experimental observation that red-shifts occur in\nphotoluminescence spectra of Ge with n-type doping. We reveal that the indirect\nband gap narrowing is mainly caused by impurity state, while the direct band\ngap narrowing is a result of lattice distortion induced by the dopant atom.\nMoreover, we find that it can use E_g^{\\Gamma}-E_g^L to explain the voltage\nincrease was needed to reach the same current densities of light emission\nthrough the different samples with increasing doping concentrations.\n", "  Collisionless space plasma turbulence can generate reconnecting thin current\nsheets as suggested by recent results of numerical magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations. The MMS mission provides the first serious opportunity to check if\nsmall ion-electron-scale reconnection, generated by turbulence, resembles the\nreconnection events frequently observed in the magnetotail or at the\nmagnetopause. Here we investigate field and particle observations obtained by\nthe MMS fleet in the turbulent terrestrial magnetosheath behind quasi-parallel\nbow shock geometry. We observe multiple small-scale current sheets during the\nevent and present a detailed look of one of the detected structures. The\nemergence of thin current sheets can lead to electron scale structures where\nions are demagnetized. Within the selected structure we see signatures of ion\ndemagnetization, electron jets, electron heating and agyrotropy suggesting that\nMMS spacecraft observe reconnection at these scales.\n", "  A physical realization of scattering by ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric potentials is\nprovided: we show that the Maxwell equations for an electromagnetic wave\ntravelling along a planar slab waveguide filled with gain and absorbing media\nin contiguous regions, can be approximated in a parameter range by a\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with a ${\\cal{PT}}$-symmetric scattering potential.\n", "  X-ray energy spectrum plays an essential role in computed tomography (CT)\nimaging and related tasks. Due to the high photon flux of clinical CT scanners,\nmost of spectrum estimation methods are indirect and usually suffered from\nvarious limitations. In this study, we aim to provide a segmentation-free\nindirect transmission measurement-based energy spectrum estimation method using\ndual-energy material decomposition. The general principle of the method is to\nminimize the quadratic error between the polychromatic forward projection and\nthe raw projection to calibrate a set of unknown weights which are used to\nexpress the unknown spectrum together with a set of model spectra. The\npolychromatic forward projection is performed using material-specific images\nwhich are obtained using dual-energy material decomposition. The algorithm has\nbeen evaluated using numerical simulations, experimental phantom data as well\nas realistic patient data. The results show the estimated spectrum matches the\nreference spectrum quite well and the method is robust. Extensive studies\nsuggest the method provides accurate estimate of the CT spectrum without\ndedicated physical phantom and prolonged work flow. This paper may be\nattractive for CT dose calculations, artifacts reduction, polychromatic image\nreconstruction and other spectrum-involved CT applications.\n", "  We formulate extensions to Data Driven Computing for both distance minimizing\nand entropy maximizing schemes to incorporate time integration. Previous works\nfocused on formulating both types of solvers in the presence of static\nequilibrium constraints. Here formulations assign data points a variable\nrelevance depending on distance to the solution and on maximum-entropy\nweighting, with distance minimizing schemes discussed as a special case. The\nresulting schemes consist of the minimization of a suitably-defined free energy\nover phase space subject to compatibility and a time-discretized momentum\nconservation constraint. The present selected numerical tests that establish\nthe convergence properties of both types of Data Driven solvers and solutions.\n", "  A new approximating technique is developed so as to study the quantum\nferromagnetic spin-1 Blume-Capel model in the presence of a transverse crystal\nfield in the square lattice. Our proposal consists of approaching the spin\nsystem by considering islands of finite clusters whose frontiers are surrounded\nby non-interacting spins that are treated by the effective-field theory. The\nresulting phase diagram is qualitatively correct, in contrast to most\neffective-field treatments, in which the first-order line exhibits spurious\nbehavior by not being perpendicular to the anisotropy axis at low temperatures.\nThe effect of the transverse anisotropy is also verified by the presence of\nquantum phase transitions. The possibility of using larger sizes constitutes an\nadvantage to other approaches where the implementation of larger sizes is\ncostly computationally.\n", "  Magnetic response of the spin-$1/2$ cylindrical nanowire to the propagating\nmagnetic field wave has been investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulation\nmethod based on Metropolis algorithm. The obtained microscopic spin\nconfigurations suggest that the studied system exhibits two types of dynamical\nphases depending on the considered values of system parameters: Coherent\npropagation of spin bands and spin-frozen or pinned phases, as in the case of\nthe conventional bulk systems under the influence of a propagating magnetic\nfield. By benefiting from the temperature dependencies of variances of dynamic\norder parameter, internal energy and the derivative of dynamic order parameter\nof the system, dynamic phase diagrams are also obtained in related planes for\nvarying values of the wavelength of the propagating magnetic field. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that as the strength of the field amplitude is\nincreased, the phase transition points tend to shift to the relatively lower\ntemperature regions. Moreover, it has been observed that dynamic phase boundary\nline shrinks inward when the value of wavelength of the external field\ndecreases.\n", "  This paper aims to revisit the mathematical foundations of both General\nRelativity and Electromagnetism after one century, in the light of the formal\ntheory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups (D.C.\nSpencer, 1970) or Algebraic Analysis, namely a mixture of differential geometry\nand homological algebra (M. Kashiwara, 1970). Among the new results obtained,\nwe may quote: 1) In dimension 4 only, the 9 Bianchi identities that must be\nsatisfied by the 10 components of the Weyl tensor are described by a second\norder operator and have thus nothing to do with the 20 first order Bianchi\nidentities for the 20 components of the Riemann tensor. This result, not known\nafter one century, has been recently confirmed by A. Quadrat (INRIA) using new\ncomputer algebra packages. 2) The Ricci tensor R is a section of the Ricci\nbundle of symmetric covariant 2-tensors which is the kernel of the canonical\nprojection of the Riemann bundle onto the Weyl bundle, induced by the canonical\ninclusion of the classical Killing system (Poincare group) into the conformal\nKilling system (Conformal group). It has only to do with the second order jets\n(elations) of the conformal Killing system because any 1-form with value in the\nbundle of elations can be decomposed in the direct sum (R,F) where the\nelectromagnetic field F is a section of the vector bundle of skewsymmetric\ncovariant 2-tensors. It follows therefore that electromagnetism and gravitation\nhave only to do with second order jets. 3) The 10 linearized second order\nEinstein equations are parametrizing the 4 first order Cauchy stress equations\nbut cannot be parametrized themselves. As a byproduct of this negative result,\nthese 4 Cauchy stress equations have nothing to do with the 4 divergence-type\nequations usually obtained from the 20 Bianchi identities by contraction of\nindices.\n", "  Community detection is a commonly used technique for identifying groups in a\nnetwork based on similarities in connectivity patterns. To facilitate community\ndetection in large networks, we recast the network to be partitioned into a\nsmaller network of 'super nodes', each super node comprising one or more nodes\nin the original network. To define the seeds of our super nodes, we apply the\n'CoreHD' ranking from dismantling and decycling. We test our approach through\nthe analysis of two common methods for community detection: modularity\nmaximization with the Louvain algorithm and maximum likelihood optimization for\nfitting a stochastic block model. Our results highlight that applying community\ndetection to the compressed network of super nodes is significantly faster\nwhile successfully producing partitions that are more aligned with the local\nnetwork connectivity, more stable across multiple (stochastic) runs within and\nbetween community detection algorithms, and overlap well with the results\nobtained using the full network.\n", "  We further elaborate on a phase-space picture for a system of $N$ qubits and\nexplore the structures compatible with the notion of unbiasedness. These\nconsist of bundles of discrete curves satisfying certain additional properties\nand different entanglement properties. We discuss the construction of discrete\ncovariant Wigner functions for these bundles and provide several illuminating\nexamples.\n", "  We find the form of the refractive index such that a solution, $S$, of the\neikonal equation yields an exact solution, $\\exp ({\\rm i} k_{0} S)$, of the\ncorresponding Helmholtz equation.\n", "  The motion of electrons in or near solids, liquids and gases can be tracked\nby forcing their ejection with attosecond x-ray pulses, derived from\nfemtosecond lasers. The momentum of these emitted electrons carries the imprint\nof the electronic state. Aberration corrected transmission electron microscopes\nhave observed individual atoms, and have sufficient energy sensitivity to\nquantify atom bonding and electronic configurations. Recent developments in\nultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction indicate that spatial and\ntemporal information can be collected simultaneously. In the present work, we\npush the capability of femtosecond transmission electron microscopy (fs-TEM)\ntowards that of the state of the art in ultrafast lasers and electron\nmicroscopes. This is anticipated to facilitate unprecedented elucidation of\nphysical, chemical and biological structural dynamics on electronic time and\nlength scales. The fs-TEM numerically studied employs a nanotip source,\nelectrostatic acceleration to 70 keV, magnetic lens beam transport and\nfocusing, a condenser-objective around the sample and a terahertz temporal\ncompressor, including space charge effects during propagation. With electron\nemission equivalent to a 20 fs laser pulse, we find a spatial resolution below\n10 nm and a temporal resolution of below 10 fs will be feasible for pulses\ncomprised of on average 20 electrons. The influence of a transverse electric\nfield at the sample is modelled, indicating that a field of 1 V/$\\mu$m can be\nresolved.\n", "  Laser produced high-energy-density plasmas may contain strong magnetic fields\nthat affect the energy transport, which can be nonlocal. Models which describe\nthe magnetized nonlocal transport are formally complicated and based on many\napproximations. This paper presents a more straightforward approach to the\ndescription of the electron transport in this regime, based on the extension of\na reduced entropic model. The calculated magnetized heat fluxes are compared\nwith the known asymptotic limits and applied for studying of a magnetized\nnonocal plasma thermalization.\n", "  We combine precision radial velocity data from four different published works\nof the stars in the Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This yields a dataset that\nspans 19 years, has 14 different epochs of observation, and contains 372 unique\nred giant branch stars, 196 of which have repeat observations. Using this\nmulti-epoch dataset, we constrain the binary fraction for Leo II. We generate a\nsuite of Monte Carlo simulations that test different binary fractions using\nBayesian analysis and determine that the binary fraction for Leo II ranges from\n$0.30^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ to $0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$, depending on the\ndistributions of binary orbital parameters assumed. This value is smaller than\nwhat has been found for the solar neighborhood (~0.4-0.6) but falls within the\nwide range of values that have been inferred for other dwarf spheroidals\n(0.14-0.69). The distribution of orbital periods has the greatest impact on the\nbinary fraction results. If the fraction we find in Leo II is present in\nlow-mass ultra-faints, it can artificially inflate the velocity dispersion of\nthose systems and cause them to appear more dark matter rich than in actuality.\nFor a galaxy with an intrinsic dispersion of 1 km/s and an observational sample\nof 100 stars, the dispersion can be increased by a factor of 1.5-2 for Leo\nII-like binary fractions or by a factor of 3 for binary fractions on the higher\nend of what has been seen in other dwarf spheroidals.\n", "  It is argued that the tight interconnection between biological,\nclimatological, and geophysical factors in the history of the terrestrial\nbiosphere can teach us something of wider importance regarding the general\nastrobiological evolution of planets in the Galactic habitable zone of the\nMilky Way. Motivated by a recent debate on the future of Earth's biosphere, we\nsuggest an additional reason why the impact of plate tectonics on the\nbiological evolution is significant on the global Galactic level.\n", "  Examining the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with the wavevector\ndirected in opposition to the time-averaged Poynting vector in cosmological\nspacetime with piecewise uniform metric, we show that such\nnegative-phase-velocity (NPV) propagation is possible in certain de Sitter\nspacetimes but not in anti-de Sitter spacetimes. This difference suggests the\npossibility of an optical/electromagnetic experiment to discern the\ncosmological constant of a four-dimensional universe stemming from a\nfive-dimensional brane universe.\n", "  The propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with negative phase velocity\n(NPV) is considered in Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. It is\ndemonstrated that NPV propagation occurs in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime\nat lower values of the cosmological constant than is the case for de Sitter\nspacetime. Furthermore, we report that neither is NPV propagation observed in\nSchwarzschild-anti-de Sitter spacetime, nor is it possible outside the event\nhorizon of a Schwarzschild blackhole.\n", "  The propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with negative phase velocity\n(NPV) in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole has recently been reported. A\ncomparison of NPV propagation and superradiance is presented. We show that,\nalthough both phenomenons involve negative energy densities, there are two\nsignificant differences between them.\n"]}
