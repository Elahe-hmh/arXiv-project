measuring\nthe sputtered ions in collisions of highly charged ions with solid surface is\ndescribed. The nonlinear relationship between the point of fall versus the\nionic energy, the blurring of the point of fall caused by the divergence of\nincident angle and the finite entrance aperture, the transform from a position\nspectrum to an energy spectrum, as well as the influence of the fringing fields\nare discussed.\n", "  Quantum correlations and entanglement are fundamental resources for quantum\ninformation and quantum communication processes. Developments in these fields\nnormally assume these resources stable and not susceptible of distortion. That\nis not always the case, Heisenberg interactions between qubits can produce\ndistortion on entangled pairs generated for engineering purposes (e. g. for\nquantum computation or quantum cryptography). Experimental work shows how to\nproduce entangled spin qubits in quantum dots and electron gases, so its\nidentification and control are crucial for later applications. The presence of\nparasite magnetic fields modifies the expected properties and behavior for\nwhich the pair was intended. Quantum measurement and control help to\ndiscriminate the original state in order to correct it or, just to try of\nreconstruct it using some procedures which do not alter their quantum nature.\n  Two different kinds of quantum entangled pairs driven by a Heisenberg\nHamiltonian with an additional inhomogeneous magnetic field which becoming\nself-distorted, can be reconstructed without previous discrimination by adding\nan external magnetic field, with fidelity close to 1 (with respect to the\noriginal state, but without discrimination). After, each state can be more\nefficiently discriminated. The aim of this work is to show how combining both\nprocesses, first reconstruction without discrimination and after discrimination\nwith adequate non-local measurements, it's possible a) improve the\ndiscrimination, and b) reprepare faithfully the original states. The complete\nprocess gives fidelities better than 0.9. In the meanwhile, some results about\na class of equivalence for the required measurements were found. This property\nlets us select the adequate measurement in order to ease the repreparation\nafter of discrimination, without loss of entanglement.\n", "  The peak energy resolution of germanium detectors deteriorates with\nincreasing neutron fluence. This is due to hole capture at neutron-created\ndefects in the crystal which prevents the full energy of the gamma-ray from\nbeing recorded by the detector. A phenomenological model of coaxial HPGe\ndetectors is developed that relies on a single, dimensionless parameter that is\nrelated to the probability for immediate trapping of a mobile hole in the\ndamaged crystal. As this trap parameter is independent of detector dimensions\nand type, the model is useful for predicting energy resolution as a function of\nneutron fluence.\n", "  With the advent of laser frequency combs, coherent light sources that offer\nequally-spaced sharp lines over a broad spectral bandwidth have become\navailable. One decade after revolutionizing optical frequency metrology,\nfrequency combs hold much promise for significant advances in a growing number\nof applications including molecular spectroscopy. Despite its intriguing\npotential for the measurement of molecular spectra spanning tens of nanometers\nwithin tens of microseconds at Doppler-limited resolution, the development of\ndual-comb spectroscopy is hindered by the extremely demanding high-bandwidth\nservo-control conditions of the laser combs. Here we overcome this difficulty.\nWe experimentally demonstrate a straightforward concept of real-time dual-comb\nspectroscopy, which only uses free-running mode-locked lasers without any\nphase-lock electronics, a posteriori data-processing, or the need for expertise\nin frequency metrology. The resulting simplicity and versatility of our new\ntechnique of adaptive dual-comb spectroscopy offer a powerful transdisciplinary\ninstrument that may spark off new discoveries in molecular sciences.\n", "  FePd thin films have been recently considered as promising material for\nhigh-density magnetic storage devices. However, it is necessary to find a\nproper method of fabrication for the (001)-textured and chemically well-ordered\nalloy. In this paper, we present the detailed investigations of lattice\nparameters, chemical order degree, grain sizes and crystallographic texture,\ncarried out on FePd alloys with 10 at.% of Cu addition. The initial [Cu(0.2\nnm)/Fe(0.9 nm)/Pd(1.1 nm)]x5 multilayers were thermally evaporated in an\nultra-high vacuum on MgO(100), Si(100), Si(111) and Si(100) covered by 100 nm\nthick layer of amorphous SiO2. In order to obtain homogeneous FePd:Cu alloy,\nthe multilayers were annealed in two different ways. First, the samples were\nrapidly annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 600oC for 90 seconds. Next, the long\nannealing in a high vacuum for 1 hour at 700oC was done. This paper focuses on\nquantitative investigations of the chemical order degree and crystallographic\ntexture of ternary FePd:Cu alloys deposited on four different substrates. In\norder to obtain both quantities we have taken a novel approach to consider the\nproblem of dopant atoms located in the FePd structure. The studies of the\nstructure were done using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) performed with synchrotron\nradiation and pole figures measurements. We have found that the addition of Cu\nchanges the FePd lattice parameters and lattice distortion. We have also shown,\nthat using different substrates it is possible to obtain a FePd:Cu alloy with\ndifferent chemical order and texture. Moreover, it was observed that texture\ncategory is substrate dependent.\n", "  The rates of chemical reactions are not absolute but their magnitude depends\nupon the relative speeds of the moving observers. This has been proved by\nunifying theories of chemical kinetics, which are transition state theory,\ncollision theory, RRKM and Marcus theory, with the special theory of\nrelativity. Boltzmann constant and energy spacing between permitted quantum\nlevels of molecules are quantum mechanically proved to be Lorentz variant. The\nrelativistic statistical thermodynamics has been developed to explain\nquasiequilibrium existing between reactants and activated complex. The newly\nformulated Lorentz transformation of the rate constant from Arrhenius Equation,\nof the collision frequency and of the Eyring and Marcus equations renders the\nrate law also Lorentz variant. For a moving observer moving at fractions of the\nspeed of light along the reaction coordinate the transition state possess less\nkinetic energy to sweep translation over it. This results in the slower\ntransformation of reactants into products and in a stretched time frame for the\nchemical reaction. Lorentz transformation of the half-life equation explains\ntime dilation of the half life period of chemical reactions and proves special\ntheory of relativity and presents theory of relativistic chemical kinetics in\naccord with each other. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present theory,\nthe enzymatic reaction of methylamine dehydrogenase and radioactive\ndisintegration of Astatine are considered as numerical examples.\n", "  Laser frequency combs are coherent light sources that emit a broad spectrum\nconsisting of discrete, evenly spaced narrow lines, each having an absolute\nfrequency measurable within the accuracy of an atomic clock. Their development,\na decade ago, in the near-infrared and visible domains has revolutionized\nfrequency metrology with numerous windfalls into other fields such as astronomy\nor attosecond science. Extension of frequency comb techniques to the\nmid-infrared spectral region is now under exploration. Versatile mid-infrared\nfrequency comb generators, based on novel laser gain media, nonlinear frequency\nconversion or microresonators, promise to significantly expand the tree of\napplications of frequency combs. In particular, novel approaches to molecular\nspectroscopy in the fingerprint region, with dramatically improved precision,\nsensitivity, recording time and/or spectral bandwidth may spark off new\ndiscoveries in the various fields relevant to molecular sciences.\n", "  We report on the first demonstration of nonlinear dual-frequency-comb\nspectroscopy. In multi-heterodyne femtosecond Raman-induced Kerr-effect\nspectroscopy, the Raman gain resulting from the coherent excitation of\nmolecular vibrations by a spectrally-narrow pump is imprinted onto the\nfemtosecond laser frequency comb probe spectrum. The birefringence signal\ninduced by the nonlinear interaction of these beams and the sample is\nheterodyned against a frequency comb local oscillator with a repetition\nfrequency slightly different from that of the comb probe. Such time-domain\ninterference provides multiplex access to the phase and amplitude Raman spectra\nover a broad spectral bandwidth within a short measurement time. Experimental\ndemonstration, at a spectral resolution of 200 GHz, a measurement time of 293\n{\\mu}s and a sensitivity of 10^-6, is given on liquid samples exhibiting a C-H\nstretch Raman shift.\n", "  Dual-comb spectroscopy is extended to the visible spectral range with a\nset-up based on two frequency-doubled femtosecond ytterbium-doped fiber lasers.\nThe dense rovibronic spectrum of iodine around 19240 cm-1 is recorded within 12\nms at Doppler-limited resolution with a simple scheme that only uses\nfree-running femtosecond lasers.\n", "  We present boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields on a\n\\delta-function plate, having both electric and magnetic properties, sandwiched\nbetween two magneto-electric semi-infinite half spaces. The optical properties\nfor an isolated \\delta-function plate are shown to be independent of the\nlongitudinal material properties of the plate. The Casimir-Polder energy\nbetween an isotropically polarizable atom and a magneto-electric\n\\delta-function plate is attractive for a purely electric \\delta-function\nplate, repulsive for a purely magnetic \\delta-function plate, and vanishes for\nthe simultaneous perfect conductor limit of both electric and magnetic\nproperties of the \\delta-function plate. The interaction energy between two\nidentical \\delta-function plates is always attractive. It can be attractive or\nrepulsive when the plates have electric and magnetic properties interchanged\nand reproduces Boyer's result for the interaction energy between perfectly\nconducting electric and magnetic plates. The change in the Casimir-Polder\nenergy in the presence of a \\delta-function plate on a magneto-electric\nsubstrate is substantial when the substrate is a weak dielectric.\n", "  Optical spectroscopy and imaging of microscopic samples have opened up a wide\nrange of applications throughout the physical, chemical, and biological\nsciences. High chemical specificity may be achieved by directly interrogating\nthe fundamental or low-lying vibrational energy levels of the compound\nmolecules. Amongst the available prevailing label-free techniques, coherent\nRaman scattering has the distinguishing features of high spatial resolution\ndown to 200 nm and three-dimensional sectioning. However, combining fast\nimaging speed and identification of multiple - and possibly unexpected-\ncompounds remains challenging: existing high spectral resolution schemes\nrequire long measurement times to achieve broad spectral spans. Here we\novercome this difficulty and introduce a novel concept of coherent anti-Stokes\nRaman scattering (CARS) spectro-imaging with two laser frequency combs. We\nillustrate the power of our technique with high resolution (4 cm-1) Raman\nspectra spanning more than 1200 cm-1 recorded within less than 15 microseconds.\nFurthermore, hyperspectral images combining high spectral (10 cm-1) and spatial\n(2 micrometers) resolutions are acquired at a rate of 50 pixels per second.\nReal-time multiplex accessing of hyperspectral images may dramatically expand\nthe range of applications of nonlinear microscopy.\n", "  We have developed a real-time beam current density meter for charged particle\nbeams. It measures the mean current density by collimating a uniform and large\ndiameter primary beam. The suppression of the secondary electrons and the\ndeflection of the beam were simulated, and it was tested with a 105 keV Ar7+\nion beam.\n", "  Adopting the throat quantization pioneered by Louko and M\\\"akel\\\"a, we derive\nthe mass and area spectra for the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and its\nanti-de~Sitter (AdS) generalization in arbitrary dimensions. We obtain exact\nspectra in three special cases: the three-dimensional BTZ black hole, toroidal\nblack holes in any dimension, and five-dimensional\nSchwarzshild-Tangherlini(-AdS) black holes. For the remaining cases the spectra\nare obtained for large mass using the WKB approximation. For asymptotically\nflat black holes, the area/entropy has an equally spaced spectrum, as expected\nfrom previous work. In the asymptotically AdS case on the other hand, it is the\nmass spectrum that is equally spaced. Our exact results for the BTZ black hole\nwith Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are consistent with the spacing\nof the spectra of the corresponding operators in the dual CFT.\n", "  We study modifications of general relativity, GR, with nonlinear dispersion\nrelations which can be geometrized on tangent Lorentz bundles. Such modified\ngravity theories, MGTs, can be modeled by gravitational Lagrange density\nfunctionals $f(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{T},F)$ with generalized/ modified scalar\ncurvature $\\mathbf{R}$, trace of matter field tensors $\\mathbf{T}$ and modified\nFinsler like generating function $F$. In particular, there are defined\nextensions of GR with extra dimensional \"velocity/ momentum\" coordinates. For\nfour dimensional models, we prove that it is possible to decouple and integrate\nin very general forms the gravitational fields for\n$f(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{T},F)$-modified gravity using nonholonomic 2+2 splitting\nand nonholonomic Finsler like variables $F$. We study the modified motion and\nNewtonian limits of massive test particles on nonlinear geodesics approximated\nwith effective extra forces orthogonal to the four--velocity. We compute the\nconstraints on the magnitude of extra-accelerations and analyze perihelion\neffects and possible cosmological implications of such theories. We also derive\nthe extended Raychaudhuri equation in the framework of a tangent Lorentz\nbundle. Finally, we speculate on effective modelling of modified theories by\ngeneric off-diagonal configurations in Einstein and/or MGTs and Finsler\ngravity. We provide some examples for modified stationary (black) ellipsoid\nconfigurations and locally anisotropic solitonic backgrounds.\n", "  We study how massive ghost-free gravity $f(R)$-modified theories, MGFTs, can\nbe encoded into generic off-diagonal Einstein spaces. Using \"auxiliary\"\nconnections completely defined by the metric fields and adapted to nonholonomic\nframes with associated nonlinear connection structure, we decouple and\nintegrate in certain general forms the field equations in MGFT. Imposing\nadditional nonholonomic constraints, we can generate Levi-Civita, LC,\nconfigurations and mimic MGFT effects via off-diagonal interactions of\neffective Einstein and/or Einstein-Cartan gravity with nonholonomically induced\ntorsion. We show that imposing nonholonomic constraints it is possible\nreproduce very specific models of massive $f(R)$ gravity studied in\n\\cite{sarid,odintsr}. The cosmological evolution of ghost-free off-diagonal\nEinstein spaces is investigated. Certain compatibility of MGFT cosmology to\nsmall off--diagonal deformations of $\\Lambda $CDM models is established.\n", "  Dielectric behavior and conductivity mechanism in lead-free\n(100-x)(Li0.12Na0.88)NbO3-xBaTiO3 (0 to x to 40) piezoelectric ceramics were\ninvestigated using impedance spectroscopy over a wide temperature (-100 oC\nto500 oC) and frequency range (0.1 Hz to1 MHz). The grain and grain boundary\nresponse as well as the relaxation processes at different frequencies and\ntemperatures were also discussed. A low frequency dispersion in dielectric\npermittivity (LFDD), a typical characteristic of high-temperature behavior was\nobserved both below and above the ferro-paraelectric phase transition\ntemperature, Tm. Oxygen-defect-related complexes generated due to acceptor type\ndoping were found to play an important role in LFDD and hopping conduction. The\ndielectric relaxation follows Jonscher universal law, however LFDD is found to\nbe associated with quasi-DC process (QCD). The activation energies of DC\nconduction confirm the mechanism as the thermal motion (short range hopping) of\ndoubly ionized oxygen vacancies. At high temperature, the conductivity\nrelaxation mechanism is dominated by grain boundary conduction through hopping\nelectron created by the charge compensating oxygen vacancies.\n", "  We prove a linear inequality between the entropy and entropy dissipation\nfunctionals for the linear Boltzmann operator (with a Maxwellian equilibrium\nbackground). This provides a positive answer to the analogue of Cercignani's\nconjecture for this linear collision operator. Our result covers the physically\nrelevant case of hard-spheres interactions as well as Maxwellian kernels, both\nwith and without a cut-off assumption. For Maxwellian kernels, the proof of the\ninequality is surprisingly simple and relies on a general estimate of the\nentropy of the gain operator due to Matthes and Toscani (2012) and Villani\n(1998). For more general kernels, the proof relies on a comparison principle.\nFinally, we also show that in the grazing collision limit our results allow to\nrecover known logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.\n", "  Heralded generation and manipulation of quantum entanglement between two\nmacroscopic and spatially separated crystals at room temperature is\ntheoretically studied. We show that by combining an x-ray parametric\ndown-conversion source and x-ray interferometry with nuclear resonant\nscattering techniques, two macroscopic crystals hosting M\\\"ossbauer nuclei\nlocated each on an interferometer arm can be entangled for few tens of\nnanoseconds. The coherence time of the entanglement state can be prolonged up\nto values comparable to the lifetime of a single nuclear excited state, on the\norder of hundred nanoseconds. A non-mechanical magnetic control of the quantum\nphase between the two spatially separated entangled nuclear crystals is put\nforward.\n", "  The hypothesis that Earth was intentionally seeded with life by a preceding\nextraterrestrial civilization is believed to be currently untestable. However,\nanalysis of the situation where humans themselves embark on seeding other\nplanetary systems motivated by survival and propagation of life reveals at\nleast two ethical issues calling for specific solutions. Assuming that\ngenerally intelligence evolves ethically as it evolves technologically, the\nsame considerations might be applied to test the hypothesis of directed\npanspermia: if life on Earth was seeded intentionally, the two ethical\nrequirements are expected to be satisfied, what appears to be the case.\n", "  Entanglement is considered as a basic physical resource for modern quantum\napplications in Quantum Information and Quantum Computation theories.\nInteractions able to generate and sustain entanglement are subject to deep\nresearch in order to have understanding and control on it, based on specific\nphysical systems. Atoms, ions or quantum dots are considered a key piece in\nquantum applications because is a basic piece of developments towards a\nscalable spin-based quantum computer through universal and basic quantum\noperations. Ising model is a type of interaction which generates and modifies\nentanglement properties of quantum systems based on matter. In this work, a\ngeneral anisotropic three dimensional Ising model including an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field is analyzed to obtain their evolution and then, their algebraic\nproperties which are controlled through a set of physical parameters. Evolution\ndenote remarkable group properties when is analyzed in a non local basis, in\nparticular those related with entanglement. These properties give a fruitful\narena for further quantum applications and their control.\n", "  Control of quantum entanglement has been considered as elemental physical\nresource for quantum applications in Quantum Information and Quantum\nComputation. Control of entangled states on a couple of atoms, ions or quantum\ndots are milestones in almost all quantum applications towards a scalable\nspin-based quantum computers or quantum devices. For magnetic systems, Ising\nmodel is an interaction which generates and modifies entanglement properties of\nquantum systems based on matter. In addition, when this interaction includes\ndriven magnetic fields, it can be controlled to sustain, characterize or modify\nentanglement and other quantum properties. In this work, recent results about\nevolution in a general anisotropic three dimensional Ising model including an\ninhomogeneous magnetic field is considered to obtain some general quantum\ncontrol effects for their sustainability, programmed evolution or\ntransformation: Evolution loops and Exchange operations. This control is\nachievable through a set of physical parameters, whose prescriptions are\nreported. The use of a non local basis in the model to express time evolution\nlets take advantage to describe and control the system, in particular with\nthose issues associated with entanglement and operations mentioned before.\nFinally, some analysis about equivalent gates based on our development is made\nincluding an example with teleportation, using one of the gates constructed.\n", "  Possibly, teleportation is the most representative quantum algorithm in the\npublic domain. Nevertheless than this quantum procedure transmits only\ninformation than objects, its coverage is still very limited and easily subject\nto errors. Based on a fine control of quantum resources, particularly those\nentangled, the research to extend its coverage and flexibility is open, in\nparticular on matter based quantum systems. This work shows how anisotropic\nIsing interactions could be used as natural basis for this procedure, based on\na sequence of magnetic pulses driving Ising interaction, stating results in\nspecialized quantum gates designed for magnetic systems.\n", "  We study transport in a Weyl semimetal with donor and acceptor impurities.\n  At sufficiently high temperatures transport is dominated by electron-electron\ninteractions, while the low-temperature resistivity comes from the scattering\nof quasiparticles on screened impurities.\n  Using the diagrammatic technique, we calculate the conductivity\n$\\sigma(T,\\omega,n_A,n_D)$ in the impurities-dominated regime as a function of\ntemperature $T$, frequency $\\omega$, and the concentrations $n_A$ and $n_D$ of\ndonors and acceptors and discuss the crossover behaviour between the regimes of\nlow and high temperatures and impurity concentrations.\n  In a sufficiently compensated material [$|n_A-n_D|\\ll(n_A+n_D)$] with a small\neffective fine structure constant $\\alpha$, $\\sigma(\\omega,T)\\propto\nT^2/(T^{-2}-i\\omega\\cdot\\text{const})$ in a wide interval of temperatures.\n  For very low temperatures or in the case of an uncompensated material the\ntransport is effectively metallic. We discuss experimental conditions necessary\nfor realising each regime.\n", "  The main advantage of quantum metrology relies on the effective use of\nentanglement, which indeed allows us to achieve strictly better estimation\nperformance over the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we propose an\nanalogous method uti- lizing entanglement for the purpose of feedback control.\nThe system considered is a general linear dynamical quantum system, where the\ncontrol goal can be systemati- cally formulated as a linear quadratic Gaussian\ncontrol problem based on the quantum Kalman filtering method; in this setting,\nan entangled input probe field is effectively used to reduce the estimation\nerror and accordingly the control cost function. In par- ticular, we show that,\nin the problem of cooling an opto-mechanical oscillator, the\nentanglement-assisted feedback control can lower the stationary occupation\nnumber of the oscillator below the limit attainable by the controller with a\ncoherent probe field and furthermore beats the controller with an optimized\nsqueezed probe field.\n", "  We exactly analyze the vibrational properties of a chain of harmonic\noscillators in contact with local Langevin heat baths. Nonequilibrium\nsteady-state fluctuations are found to be described by a set of\nmode-temperatures, independent of the strengths of both the harmonic\ninteraction and the viscous damping. Energy is equally distributed between the\nconjugate variables of a given mode but differently among different modes, in a\nmanner which depends exclusively on the bath temperatures and on the boundary\nconditions. We outline how bath-temperature profiles can be designed to enhance\nor reduce fluctuations at specific frequencies in the power spectrum of the\nchain length.\n", "  The nuclear modification factor, $R_{\\rm AA}$, of the prompt charmed mesons\n${\\rm D^0}$, ${\\rm D^+}$ and ${\\rm D^{*+}}$, and their antiparticles, was\nmeasured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV in two transverse momentum intervals, $5<p_{\\rm\nT}<8$ GeV/$c$ and $8<p_{\\rm T}<16$ GeV/$c$, and in six collision centrality\nclasses. The $R_{\\rm AA}$ shows a maximum suppression of a factor of 5-6 in the\n10% most central collisions. The suppression and its centrality dependence are\ncompatible within uncertainties with those of charged pions. A comparison with\nthe $R_{\\rm AA}$ of non-prompt ${\\rm J}/\\psi$ from B meson decays, measured by\nthe CMS Collaboration, hints at a larger suppression of D mesons in the most\ncentral collisions.\n", "  We discuss how a cyclic model for the flat universe can be constructively\nderived from Loop Quantum Gravity. This model has a lower bounce, at small\nvalues of the scale factor, which shares many similarities with that of Loop\nQuantum Cosmology. We find that quantum gravity corrections can be also\nrelevant at energy densities much smaller than the Planckian one and that they\ncan induce an upper bounce at large values of the scale factor.\n", "  We construct a 2-parameter family of unitarily equivalent irreducible\nrepresentations of the triply extended group $\\g$ of translations of\n$\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ associated with a family of its 4-dimensional coadjoint orbits\nand show how a continuous 2-parameter family of gauge potentials emerges from\nthese unitarly equivalent representations. We show that the Landau and the\nsymmetric gauges of noncommutative quantum mechanics, widely used in the\nliterature, in fact, belong to this 2-parameter family of gauges. We also\nprovide an explicit construction of noncommutative 4-tori and compute the\nassociated star products using the unitary dual of the group $\\g$ that was\nstudied at length in an earlier paper (\\cite{ncqmjpa}). Finally, we construct\nprojective modules over such noncommutative 4-tori and compute constant\ncurvature connections on them using Rieffel's method.\n", "  A factor-graph representation of quantum-mechanical probabilities (involving\nany number of measurements) is proposed. Unlike standard statistical models,\nthe proposed representation uses auxiliary variables (state variables) that are\nnot random variables. All joint probability distributions are marginals of some\ncomplex-valued function $q$, and it is demonstrated how the basic concepts of\nquantum mechanics relate to factorizations and marginals of $q$.\n", "  The search for new control methods over light-matter interactions is one of\nthe engines that advances fundamental physics and applied science alike. A\nspecific class of light-matter interaction interfaces are setups coupling\nphotons of distinct frequencies via matter. Such devices, nontrivial in design,\ncould be endowed with multifunctional tasking. Here we envisage for the first\ntime an optomechanical system that bridges optical and robust, high-frequency\nx-ray photons, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to control. The\nx-ray-optical system comprises of an optomechanical cavity and a movable\nmicrolever interacting with an optical laser and with x-rays via resonant\nnuclear scattering. We show that optomechanically induced transparency of a\nbroad range of photons (10 eV-100 keV) is achievable in this setup, allowing to\ntune nuclear x-ray absorption spectra via optomechanical control. This paves\nways for metrology applications, e.g., the detection of the $^{229}$Thorium\nclock transition, and an unprecedentedly precise control of x-rays using\noptical photons.\n", "  The aim of the current paper is to clarify some aspects of the formalism used\nfor describing the scalar-tensor gravity characterized by four arbitrary local\nfunctionals of the scalar field. We recall the objects that are invariant with\nrespect to a spacetime point under the local Weyl rescaling of the metric and\nunder the scalar field redefinition. We phrase and prove a theorem that allows\nto link such an object to each quantity in a theory where two out of the four\narbitrary local functionals of the scalar field are specified in a suitable\nmanner. Based on these results we phrase and reason the existence of the so\ncalled translation rules.\n", "  We construct a two-dimensional action that is an extension of spherically\nsymmetric Einstein-Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. The action contains arbitrary\nfunctions of the areal radius and the norm squared of its gradient, but the\nfield equations are second order and obey Birkhoff's theorem. In complete\nanalogy with spherically symmetric Einstein-Lanczos-Lovelock gravity, the field\nequations admit the generalized Misner-Sharp mass as the first integral that\ndetermines the form of the vacuum solution. The arbitrary functions in the\naction allow for vacuum solutions that describe a larger class of interesting\nnonsingular black-hole spacetimes than previously available.\n", "  A 128-channel picoammeter system is constructed based on instrumentation\namplifiers. Taking the advantages of high electric potential and narrow\nbandwidth in DC energetic charged beam measurements, current resolution better\nthan 5 fA can be achieved. Two 128-channel Faraday cup arrays are built, and\nare employed for ion and electron beam current distribution measurements. Tests\nwith 60 keV O3+ ions and 2 keV electrons show that it can provide exact\nboundaries when a positive charged particle beam current distribution is\nmeasured.\n", "  The standard paradigm to describe seismicity induced by fluid injection is to\napply nonlinear diffusion dynamics in a poroelastic medium. I show that the\nspatiotemporal behaviour and rate evolution of induced seismicity can, instead,\nbe expressed by geometric operations on a static stress field produced by\nvolume change at depth. I obtain laws similar in form to the ones derived from\nporoelasticity while requiring a lower description length. Although fluid flow\nis known to occur in the ground, it is not pertinent to the behaviour of\ninduced seismicity. The proposed model is equivalent to the static stress model\nfor tectonic foreshocks generated by the Non- Critical Precursory Accelerating\nSeismicity Theory. This study hence verifies the explanatory power of this\ntheory outside of its original scope.\n", "  We generalize techniques previously used to compute ground-state properties\nof one-dimensional noninteracting quantum gases to obtain exact results at\nfinite temperature. We compute the order-n R\\'enyi entanglement entropy to all\norders in the fugacity in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In all\nspatial dimensions, we provide closed-form expressions for its virial expansion\nup to next-to-leading order. In all of our results, we find explicit volume\nscaling in the high-temperature limit.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the effects of helical primordial magnetic\nfields (PMFs) on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) reduced bispectrum. We\nderive the full three-point statistics of helical magnetic fields and\nnumerically calculate the even contribution in the collinear configuration. We\nthen numerically compute the CMB reduced bispectrum induced by passive and\ncompensated PMF modes on large angular scales. There is a negative signal on\nthe bispectrum due to the helical terms of the fields and we also observe that\nthe biggest contribution to the bispectrum comes from the non-zero IR cut-off\nfor causal fields, unlike the two-point correlation case. For negative spectral\nindices, the reduced bispectrum is enhanced by the passive modes. This gives a\nlower value of the upper limit for the mean amplitude of the magnetic field on\na given characteristic scale. However, high values of IR cut-off in the\nbispectrum, and the helical terms of the magnetic field relaxes this bound.\nThis demonstrates the importance of the IR cut-off and helicity in the study of\nthe nature of PMFs from CMB observations.\n", "  Motivated by the search for new gravity duals to M2 branes with $N>4$\nsupersymmetry --- equivalently, M-theory backgrounds with Killing superalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{osp}(N|4)$ for $N>4$ --- we classify homogeneous M-theory\nbackgrounds with symmetry Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n) \\oplus\n\\mathfrak{so}(3,2)$ for $n=5,6,7$. We find that there are no new backgrounds\nwith $n=6,7$ but we do find a number of new (to us) backgrounds with $n=5$. All\nbackgrounds are metrically products of the form $\\operatorname{AdS}_4 \\times\nP^7$, with $P$ riemannian and homogeneous under the action of\n$\\operatorname{SO}(5)$, or $S^4 \\times Q^7$ with $Q$ lorentzian and homogeneous\nunder the action of $\\operatorname{SO}(3,2)$. At least one of the new\nbackgrounds is supersymmetric (albeit with only $N=2$) and we show that it can\nbe constructed from a supersymmetric Freund--Rubin background via a Wick\nrotation. Two of the new backgrounds have only been approximated numerically.\n(The second version of this paper includes an appendix by Alexander~S.~Haupt,\nclosing a gap in our original analysis.)\n", "  We derive a class of mesoscopic virial equations governing energy partition\nbetween conjugate position and momentum variables of individual degrees of\nfreedom. They are shown to apply to a wide range of nonequilibrium steady\nstates with stochastic (Langevin) and deterministic (Nos\\'e--Hoover) dynamics,\nand to extend to collective modes for models of heat-conducting lattices. A\ngeneralised macroscopic virial theorem ensues upon summation over all degrees\nof freedom. This theorem allows for the derivation of nonequilibrium state\nequations that involve dissipative heat flows on the same footing with state\nvariables, as exemplified for inertial Brownian motion with solid friction and\noverdamped active Brownian particles subject to inhomogeneous pressure.\n", "  We briefly review the effective field theory of massive composite particles,\ntheir gauge couplings and characteristic energy scale in the UV-domain of\nUV-stable fixed point of strong four-fermion coupling, then mainly focus the\ndiscussions on the decay channels of composite particles into the final states\nof the SM gauge bosons, leptons and quarks. We calculate the rates of composite\nbosons decaying into two gauge bosons $\\gamma\\gamma$, $\\gamma Z^0$, $W^+W^-$,\n$Z^0Z^0$ and give the ratios of decay rates of different channels depending on\ngauge couplings only. It is shown that a composite fermion decays into an\nelementary fermion and a composite boson, the latter being an intermediate\nstate decays into two gauge bosons, leading to a peculiar kinematics of final\nstates of a quark (or a lepton) and two gauge bosons. These provide\nexperimental implications of such an effective theory of composite particles\nbeyond the SM. We also present some speculative discussions on the channels of\ncomposite fermions decaying into $WW$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$ two boson-tagged jets with\nquark jets, or to four-quark jets. Moreover, at the same energy scale of\ncomposite particles produced in high-energy experiments, composite particles\nare also produced by high-energy sterile neutrino (dark matter) collisions,\ntheir decays lead to excesses of cosmic ray particles in space and signals of\nSM particles in underground laboratories.\n", "  We reveal the universality of short-term anisotropic inflation. As a\ndemonstration, we study inflation with an exponential type gauge kinetic\nfunction which is ubiquitous in models obtained by dimensional reduction from\nhigher dimensional fundamental theory. It turns out that an anisotropic\ninflation universally takes place in the later stage of conventional inflation.\nRemarkably, we find that primordial gravitational waves with a peak amplitude\naround $10^{-26}$ ~ $10^{-27}$ are copiously produced in high-frequency bands\n10MHz~100MHz. If we could detect such gravitational waves in future, we would\nbe able to probe higher dimensional fundamental theory.\n", "  We show that a wide class of quantum systems with translational invariance\ncan host dispersionless, soliton-like, wave packets. We focus on the setting\nwhere the effective, two-dimensional Hamiltonian acquires the form of the Dirac\noperator. The proposed framework for construction of the dispersionless wave\npackets is illustrated on silicene-like systems with topologically nontrivial\neffective mass. Our analytical predictions are accompanied by a numerical\nanalysis and possible experimental realizations are discussed.\n", "  We study the ADHM construction of (anti-)self-dual instantons in eight\ndimensions. We propose the general scheme to construct the (anti-)self-dual\ngauge field configurations $F \\wedge F = \\pm *_8 F \\wedge F$ whose finite\ntopological charges are given by the fourth Chern number. We show that our\nconstruction reproduces the known $\\text{SO}(8)$ one-instanton solution. We\nalso construct multi-instanton solutions of 't Hooft and Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbi\n(JNR) types in the dilute instanton gas approximation. The well-separated\nconfigurations of multi-instantons reproduce the correct topological charges\nwith high accuracy. We also show that our construction is generalized to\n(anti-)self-dual instantons in $4n \\ (n=3,4, \\ldots)$ dimensions.\n", "  Two recent publications have reported intriguing analyses, tentatively\nsuggesting that some aspects of IceCube data might be manifestations of\nquantum-gravity-modified laws of propagation for neutrinos. We here propose a\nstrategy of data analysis which has the advantage of being applicable to\nseveral alternative possibilities for the laws of propagation of neutrinos in a\nquantum spacetime. In all scenarios here of interest one should find a\ncorrelation between the energy of an observed neutrino and the difference\nbetween the time of observation of that neutrino and the trigger time of a GRB.\nWe select accordingly some GRB-neutrino candidates among IceCube events, and\nour data analysis finds a rather strong such correlation. This sort of studies\nnaturally lends itself to the introduction of a \"false alarm probability\",\nwhich for our analysis we estimate conservatively to be of 1%. We therefore\nargue that our findings should motivate a vigorous program of investigation\nfollowing the strategy here advocated.\n", "  Lensing of the CMB is affected by post-Born lensing, producing corrections to\nthe convergence power spectrum and introducing field rotation. We show\nnumerically that the lensing convergence power spectrum is affected at the\n$\\lesssim 0.2\\%$ level on accessible scales, and that this correction and the\nfield rotation are negligible for observations with arcminute beam and noise\nlevels $\\gtrsim 1 \\mu {\\text{K}}\\,{\\text{arcmin}} $. The field rotation\ngenerates $\\sim 2.5\\%$ of the total lensing B-mode polarization amplitude\n($0.2\\%$ in power on small scales), but has a blue spectrum on large scales,\nmaking it highly subdominant to the convergence B modes on scales where they\nare a source of confusion for the signal from primordial gravitational waves.\nSince the post-Born signal is non-linear, it also generates a bispectrum with\nthe convergence. We show that the post-Born contributions to the bispectrum\nsubstantially change the shape predicted from large-scale structure\nnon-linearities alone, and hence must be included to estimate the expected\ntotal signal and impact of bispectrum biases on CMB lensing reconstruction\nquadratic estimators and other observables. The field-rotation power spectrum\nonly becomes potentially detectable for noise levels $\\ll 1 \\mu\n{\\text{K}}\\,{\\text{arcmin}}$, but its bispectrum with the convergence may be\nobservable at $\\sim 3\\sigma$ with Stage IV observations. Rotation-induced and\nconvergence-induced B modes are slightly correlated by the bispectrum, and the\nbispectrum also produces additional contributions to the lensed BB power\nspectrum.\n", "  In this article, we first employ the concentration compactness techniques to\nprove existence and stability results of standing waves for nonlinear\nfractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Choquard equation \\[ i\\partial_t\\Psi +\n(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha}\\Psi = a |\\Psi|^{s-2}\\Psi+\\lambda \\left(\n\\frac{1}{|x|^{N-\\beta}} \\star |\\Psi|^p \\right)|\\Psi|^{p-2}\\Psi\\ \\ \\\n\\mathrm{in}\\ \\mathbb{R}^{N+1}, \\] where $N\\geq 2$, $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$, $\\beta\\in\n(0, N)$, $s\\in (2, 2+\\frac{4\\alpha}{N})$, $p\\in [2,\n1+\\frac{2\\alpha+\\beta}{N})$, and the constants $a, \\lambda$ are nonnegative\nsatisfying $a+\\lambda > 0.$ We then extend the arguments to establish similar\nresults for coupled standing waves of nonlinear fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nsystems of Choquard type. The same argument works for equations with an\narbitrary number of combined nonlinearities and when $|x|^{\\beta-N}$ is\nreplaced by a more general convolution potential $\\mathcal{K}:\\mathbb{R}^N\\to\n[0, \\infty)$ under certain assumptions. The same arguments can be applied and\nthe results are identical for the case $\\alpha=1$ as well.\n", "  We study charge transport in a source-channel-drain system with a\ntime-varying applied gate potential acting on the channel. We calculate both\nthe current flowing from the source into the channel and out of the channel\ninto the drain. The current is expressed in terms of nonequilibrium Green's\nfunctions. These nonequilibrium Green's functions can be determined from the\nsteady-state Green's functions and the equilibrium Green's functions of the\nfree leads. We find that the application of the gate potential can induce\ncurrent to flow even when there is no source-drain bias potential. However, the\ndirection of the current from the source and the current to the drain are\nopposite, thereby resulting in no net current flowing within the channel. When\na source-drain bias potential is present, the net current flowing to the source\nand drain can either be attenuated or amplified depending on the sign of the\napplied gate potential. We also find that the response of the system to a\ndynamically changing gate potential is not instantaneous, i.e., a relaxation\ntime has to pass before the current settles into a steady value. In particular,\nwhen the gate potential is in the form of a step function, the current first\novershoots to a maximum value, oscillates, and then settles down to a\nsteady-state value.\n", "  Network science investigates methodologies that summarise relational data to\nobtain better interpretability. Identifying modular structures is a fundamental\ntask, and assessment of the coarse-grain level is its crucial step. Here, we\npropose principled, scalable, and widely applicable assessment criteria to\ndetermine the number of clusters in modular networks based on the leave-one-out\ncross-validation estimate of the edge prediction error.\n", "  In this work we present a general construction of integrable models for boson\ntunneling in multi-well systems. We show how the models may be derived through\nthe Quantum Inverse Scattering Method and solved by algebraic Bethe ansatz\nmeans. From the transfer matrix we find only two conserved operators. However,\nwe construct additional conserved operators through a different method. As a\nconsequence the models admit multiple pseudovacua, each associated to a set of\nBethe ansatz equations. We show that all sets of Bethe ansatz equations are\nneeded to obtain a complete set of eigenstates.\n", "  We study a theory of gravity in which the action is a result from the general\npurely disformal transformation on the Einstein-Hilbert action. This theory is\na sub-class of GLPV theory which is the the generalization of covariant\nGalileon. Nevertheless, we find that the self accelerating solution for the\nbackground universe disappears in this theory. We also find that, for this\ntheory, the Vainshtein mechanism is absent. However, the Vainshtein mechanism\nis not necessary for this theory, because this theory can nearly mimic the\nEinstein theory of gravity at all scales inside the Huble radius without this\nmechanism.\n", "  This paper studies the Kalman decomposition for linear quantum systems.\nContrary to the classical case, the coordinate transformation used for the\ndecomposition must belong to a specific class of transformations as a\nconsequence of the laws of quantum mechanics. We propose a construction method\nfor such transformations that put the system in a Kalman canonical form.\nFurthermore, we uncover an interesting structure for the obtained\ndecomposition. In the case of passive systems, it is shown that there exist\nonly controllable/observable and uncontrollable/unobservable subsystems. In the\ngeneral case, controllable/unobservable and uncontrollable/observable\nsubsystems may also be present, but their respective system variables must be\nconjugate variables of each other. This decomposition naturally exposes\ndecoherence-free modes, quantum-nondemolition modes, quantum-mechanics-free\nsubsystems, and back-action evasion measurements in the quantum system, which\nare useful resources for quantum information processing, and quantum\nmeasurements. The theory developed is applied to physical examples.\n", "  A new analytical 3D model of interstellar extinction within 500 pc of the Sun\nas a function of the Galactic spherical coordinates is suggested. This model is\nphysically more justified than the widely used Arenou model, since it takes\ninto account the presence of absorbing matter both in the layer along the\nequatorial Galactic plane and in the Gould Belt. The extinction in the\nequatorial layer varies as the sine of the Galactic longitude and in the Gould\nBelt as the sine of twice the longitude in the Belt plane. The extinction\nacross the layers varies according to a barometric law. It has been found that\nthe absorbing layers intersect at an angle of 17 deg and that the Sun is\nlocated near the axial plane of the absorbing layer of the Gould Belt and is\nprobably several parsecs below the axial plane of the equatorial absorbing\nlayer but above the Galactic plane. The model has been tested using the\nextinction of real stars from three catalogs.\n", "  The presence of knots has been observed in a small fraction of single-domain\nproteins and related to their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. The\nexchanging of identical structural elements, typical of domain-swapped\nproteins, make such dimers suitable candidates to validate the possibility that\nmutual entanglement between chains may play a similar role for protein\ncomplexes. We suggest that such entanglement is captured by the linking number.\nThis represents, for two closed curves, the number of times that each curve\nwinds around the other. We show that closing the curves is not necessary, as a\nnovel parameter $G'$, termed Gaussian entanglement, is strongly correlated with\nthe linking number. Based on $110$ non redundant domain-swapped dimers, our\nanalysis evidences a high fraction of chains with a significant intertwining,\nthat is with $|G'| > 1$. We report that Nature promotes configurations with\nnegative mutual entanglement and surprisingly, it seems to suppress\nintertwining in long protein dimers. Supported by numerical simulations of\ndimer dissociation, our results provide a novel topology-based classification\nof protein-swapped dimers together with some preliminary evidence of its impact\non their physical and biological properties.\n", "  Solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation provide a systematic method\nto construct integrable quantum systems in an algebraic manner. A Lie algebra\ncan be associated with any solution of the classical Yang--Baxter equation,\nfrom which commuting transfer matrices may be constructed. This procedure is\nreviewed, specifically for solutions without skew-symmetry. A particular\nsolution with an exotic symmetry is identified, which is not obtained as a\nlimiting expansion of the usual Yang--Baxter equation. This solution\nfacilitates the construction of commuting transfer matrices which will be used\nto establish the integrability of a multi-species boson tunneling model. The\nmodel generalises the well-known two-site Bose-Hubbard model, to which it\nreduces in the one-species limit. Due to the lack of an apparent reference\nstate, application of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz to solve the model is\nprohibitive. Instead, the Bethe Ansatz solution is obtained by the use of\noperator identities and tensor product decompositions.\n", "  This study presents a generalization for a method examining the correlation\nfunction of an arbitrary system with interactions in an Ising model to obtain a\nvalue of correlation between two arbitrary points on a network. The\nestablishment of a network clarifies the type of calculations necessary for the\ncorrelation values between secondary and tertiary nodes. Moreover, it is\npossible to calculate the correlation values of the target that are interlinked\nin a complex manner by proposing a network analysis method to express the same\nas a network with mutual linkages between the target of each field.\n", "  Nowadays random number generation plays an essential role in technology with\nimportant applications in areas ranging from cryptography, which lies at the\ncore of current communication protocols, to Monte Carlo methods, and other\nprobabilistic algorithms. In this context, a crucial scientific endeavour is to\ndevelop effective methods that allow the characterization of random number\ngenerators. However, commonly employed methods either lack formality (e.g. the\nNIST test suite), or are inapplicable in principle (e.g. the characterization\nderived from the Algorithmic Theory of Information (ATI)). In this letter we\npresent a novel method based on Bayesian model selection, which is both\nrigorous and effective, for characterizing randomness in a bit sequence. We\nderive analytic expressions for a model's likelihood which is then used to\ncompute its posterior probability distribution. Our method proves to be more\nrigorous than NIST's suite and the Borel-Normality criterion and its\nimplementation is straightforward. We have applied our method to an\nexperimental device based on the process of spontaneous parametric\ndownconversion, implemented in our laboratory, to confirm that it behaves as a\ngenuine quantum random number generator (QRNG). As our approach relies on\nBayesian inference, which entails model generalizability, our scheme transcends\nindividual sequence analysis, leading to a characterization of the source of\nthe random sequences itself.\n", "  Controllable arrays of ions and ultra-cold atoms can simulate complex\nmany-body phenomena and may provide insights into unsolved problems in modern\nscience. To this end, experimentally feasible protocols for quantifying the\nbuildup of quantum correlations and coherence are needed, as performing full\nstate tomography does not scale favorably with the number of particles. Here we\ndevelop and experimentally demonstrate such a protocol, which uses time\nreversal of the many-body dynamics to measure out-of-time-order correlation\nfunctions (OTOCs) in a long-range Ising spin quantum simulator with more than\n100 ions in a Penning trap. By measuring a family of OTOCs as a function of a\ntunable parameter we obtain fine-grained information about the state of the\nsystem encoded in the multiple quantum coherence spectrum, extract the quantum\nstate purity, and demonstrate the buildup of up to 8-body correlations. Future\napplications of this protocol could enable studies of many-body localization,\nquantum phase transitions, and tests of the holographic duality between quantum\nand gravitational systems.\n", "  This article proposes an efficient way of calculating the geometric measure\nof entanglement using tensor decomposition methods. The connection between\nthese two concepts is explored using the tensor representation of the\nwavefunction. Numerical examples are benchmarked and compared. Furthermore, we\nsearch for highly entangled qubit states to show the applicability of this\nmethod.\n", "  In a very recent paper, the current authors (arXiv:gr-qc/1609.01477) have\nproposed and analyzed in detail the logarithmic form of Brans-Dicke scalar\nfield $\\phi$ as $\\phi \\propto ln(\\alpha+\\beta a)$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$\nare positive constants, to alleviate the problems of interacting holographic\ndark energy models in Brans-Dicke theory. In this paper, the cosmological\nevolution of a new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) model within the framework of\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe is analyzed with the same form of scalar\nfield in Brans-Dicke theory. We derive the equation of state parameter $w_D$\nand deceleration parameter $q$ of NADE model. It is observed that\n$w_D\\rightarrow -1$ when $a\\rightarrow \\infty$, i.e., the NADE mimics\ncosmological constant in the late time evolution. Indeed, due to the assumption\nof logarithmic form of Brans-Dicke scalar field the NADE in Brans-Dicke theory\nbehaves like NADE in general relativity in the late time evolution. The NADE\nmodel shows a phase transition from matter dominated phase in early time to\naccelerated phase in late time. We further extend NADE model by including the\ninteraction between dark matter and NADE. In this case, $w_D$ definitely\ncrosses the phantom divide line ($w_D=-1$) in the late time evolution. The\nphase transition from matter dominated to NADE dominated phase may be achieved\nat early stage in interacting model. Further, we show that the interacting NADE\nmodel resolves the cosmic coincidence problem as the energy density ratio may\nevolve sufficiently slow at present.\n", "  In the teleparallel framework of cosmology, a quintessence with non-minimal\ncouplings to the scalar torsion and a boundary term is considered. A conformal\ncoupling to matter density is also taken into account. It is shown that the\nmodel can describe the onset of cosmic acceleration after an epoch of matter\ndominated era, where dark energy is negligible, via $Z_2$ symmetry breaking.\nWhile the conformal coupling holds the Universe in a state with zero dark\nenergy density in the early epoch, the non-minimal couplings lead the Universe\nto a stable state with de Sitter expansion at the late time.\n", "  The effect of a change of noise amplitudes in overdamped diffusive systems is\nlinked to their unperturbed behavior by means of a nonequilibrium\nfluctuation-response relation. This formula holds also for systems with\nstate-independent nontrivial diffusivity matrices, as we show with an\napplication to an experiment of two trapped and hydrodynamically coupled\ncolloids, one of which is subject to an external random forcing that mimics an\neffective temperature. The nonequilibrium susceptibility of the energy to a\nvariation of this driving is an example of our formulation, which improves an\nearlier version, as it does not depend on the time-discretization of the\nstochastic dynamics. This scheme holds for generic systems with additive noise\nand can be easily implemented numerically, thanks to matrix operations.\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved in the framework of unitary\ncoupled-channel approximation by using the pseudoscalar meson-baryon octet\ninteraction. The loop function of the intermediate meson and baryon is deduced\nin a dimensional regularization scheme, where the relativistic kinetic effect\nand off-shell corrections are taken into account. According to the experimental\ndata at the $K^- p$ threshold, the subtraction constants in the loop function\nare determined. The squared amplitude is suppressed strongly and only one\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ state is generated dynamically in the strangeness $S=-1$ and\nisospin $I=0$ sector.\n", "  The optical emission efficiency of two dimensional layered transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) is one of the most important parameter that affects\ntheir optoelectronic performance. Optimization of growth parameters of chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD) to achieve optoelectronics-grade quality TMDs is\ntherefore highly desirable. Here, we present a systematic photoluminescence\n(PL) spectroscopic approach to assess the intrinsic optical and crystalline\nquality of CVD grown MoS2. We suggest that the intensity ratio between PL\nmeasured in air and vacuum could be used as an effective way to monitor the\nintrinsic optical quality of CVD MoS2. Low temperature PL measurements are also\nused to evaluate the structural defects in MoS2 by defect-associated bound\nexciton emission, which is well correlated with the field effect carrier\nmobilities of MoS2 grown at different temperatures. This work therefore\nprovides a sensitive, noninvasive method to characterize the optical properties\nof TMDs, allow tuning of growth parameters for the development of\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  The local physical properties of an isolated quantum statistical system in\nthe stationary state reached long after a quench are generically described by\nthe Gibbs ensemble, which involves only its Hamiltonian and the temperature as\na parameter. If the system is instead integrable, additional quantities\nconserved by the dynamics intervene in the description of the stationary state.\nThe resulting generalized Gibbs ensemble involves a number of temperature-like\nparameters, the determination of which is practically difficult. Here we argue\nthat in a number of simple models these parameters can be effectively\ndetermined by using fluctuation-dissipation relationships between response and\ncorrelation functions of natural observables, quantities which are accessible\nin experiments.\n", "  The so-called \"flat optics\" that shapes the phase of an incident wave in free\nspace through subwavelength structures has a venerable history. In that domain,\nachieving high efficiency at large deflection angles requires a low absorption\nmaterial, a suitable technological process, as well as suitably engineered\nnanostructures that makes them electromagnetically independent despite the\nsmall spacing required to spatially sample a rapidly varying phase.\n", "  Mass measurement of a particle whose decay products including invisible\nparticles is a challenging task at colliders. For a new physics model involving\na dark matter candidate $N$ and a $Z_2$ symmetry that stabilizes it, a typical\nnew process at $e^+e^-$ colliders is the pair production $e^+e^- \\to Y\\bar{Y}$\nfollowed by decay processes $Y\\to aN$ and $\\bar{Y}\\to b\\bar{N}$, where $a$ and\n$b$ are visible but $N$ is invisible. In this work, we propose a new method to\nmeasure the physical masses in this topology by making use of the kinematic\nequations given by momentum-energy conservation and on-shell conditions. For\neach event, the solvability of these equations determines a limited region on\nthe trial $m_Y$-$m_N$ plane. The edge of this region can be used to define two\nvariables, $m_Y^\\mathrm{edge}$ and $m_N^\\mathrm{edge}$, whose distributions are\nutilized to derive the measurement values of $m_Y$ and $m_N$. The measurement\ndeviations and uncertainties are also estimated after including detector\neffects and background contamination.\n", "  We study 100 images of early LHC collisions that were recorded by the ATLAS\nexperiment and made public for outreach purposes, and extract the charged\nparticle multiplicity as a function of momentum for proton-proton collisions at\nsqrt(s) = 7 TeV. As the collisions we study have already been pre-processed by\nthe ATLAS Collaboration, the tracks are visible, but are available to the\npublic only in the form of low-resolution bitmaps. We employ two separate image\nprocessing methods, one based on the industry-standard OpenCV library and C++,\nanother based on self-developed algorithms in Python. We present the transverse\nmomentum and azimuthal angle distributions of the particles obtained through\nboth methods, in agreement with the literature.\n", "  Proton-rich nuclei, the so-called p-nuclei, are made in photodisintegration\nprocesses in outer shells of massive stars in the course of the final supernova\nexplosion. Nuclear uncertainties in the production of these nuclei have been\nquantified in a Monte Carlo procedure. Bespoke temperature-dependent\nuncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei\nfrom Fe to Bi and all rates were varied randomly within the uncertainties. The\nresulting total production uncertainties of the p-nuclei are below a factor of\ntwo, with few exceptions. Key reactions dominating the final uncertainties have\nbeen identified in an automated procedure using correlations between rate and\nabundance uncertainties. Our results are compared to those of a previous study\nmanually varying reaction rates.\n", "  We calculate the contributions of a general non-vacuum conformal family to\nR\\'enyi entropy in two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). The primary\noperator of the conformal family can be either non-chiral or chiral, and we\ndenote its scaling dimension by $\\Delta$. For the case of two short intervals\non complex plane, we expand the R\\'enyi mutual information by the cross ratio\n$x$ to order $x^{2\\Delta+2}$. For the case of one interval on torus with the\ntemperature being low, we expand the R\\'enyi entropy by $q=\\exp(-2\\pi\\beta/L)$,\nwith $\\beta$ being the inverse temperature and $L$ being the spatial period, to\norder $q^{\\Delta+2}$. To make the result meaningful, we require that the\nscaling dimension $\\Delta$ cannot be too small. For two intervals on complex\nplane we need $\\Delta>1$, and for one interval on torus we need $\\Delta>2$. We\nwork in small Newton constant limit in gravity side and so large central charge\nlimit in CFT side, and find matches of gravity and CFT results.\n", "  The spectrum of an exactly solvable non-relativistic system of a charged\nparticle interacting with a quantized electromagnetic mode is studied with\nvarious polarizations. Quasiparticle dispersion relations can be derived from\nthe diagonalized Hamiltonian which, in the case of a linearly polarized field,\nindicates a bulk plasmon excitation, whereas in the elliptically and circularly\npolarized cases the dispersions exhibit a global minimum and show a singular\nbehavior as the wavenumber tends to zero. These new type of dispersion\nrelations lead to modified plasma frequencies and reflectivities, as well as to\nnegative group velocities. It is shown that the zero-point energy of the system\nimplies a repulsive force between two parallel plates, which vanishes when the\ncharge is set to zero.\n", "  Physics laboratory courses have been generally acknowledged as an important\ncomponent of the undergraduate curriculum, particularly with respect to\ndeveloping students' interest in, and understanding of, experimental physics.\nThere are a number of possible learning goals for these courses including\nreinforcing physics concepts, developing laboratory skills, and promoting\nexpert-like beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. However, there is\nlittle consensus among instructors and researchers interested in the laboratory\nlearning environment as to relative importance of these various learning goals.\nHere, we contribute data to this debate through the analysis of students'\nresponses to the laboratory-focused assessment known as the Colorado Learning\nAttitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a\nlarge, national data set of students' responses, we compare students' E-CLASS\nperformance in classes in which the instructor self-reported focusing on\ndeveloping skills, reinforcing concepts, or both. As the classification of\ncourses was based on instructor self-report, we also provide additional\ndescription of these course with respect to how often students engage in\nparticular activities in the lab. We find that courses that focus specifically\non developing lab skills have more expert-like postinstruction E-CLASS\nresponses than courses that focus either on reinforcing physics concepts or on\nboth goals. Within first-year courses, this effect is larger for women.\nMoreover, these findings hold when controlling for the variance in\npostinstruction scores that is associated with preinstruction E-CLASS score,\nstudent major, and student gender.\n", "  We investigate the time-frequency signatures of an on-chip biphoton frequency\ncomb (BFC) generated from a silicon nitride microring resonator. Using a\nFranson interferometer, we examine the multifrequency nature of the photon pair\nsource in a time entanglement measurement scheme; having multiple frequency\nmodes from the BFC results in a modulation of the interference pattern. This\nmeasurement together with a Schmidt mode decomposition shows that the generated\ncontinuous variable energy-time entangled state spans multiple pair-wise modes.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate nonlocal dispersion cancellation, a foundational\nconcept in time-energy entanglement, suggesting the potential of the chip-scale\nBFC for large-alphabet quantum key distribution.\n", "  We study eigenstate thermalization and related signatures of quantum chaos in\nthe one-dimensional ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with power-law\ninteractions. The presence of long-range interactions allows for a\nfinite-temperature phase transition despite the one-dimensional geometry of the\nmodel. Unlike previous studies of eigenstate thermalization in non-disordered\nsystems with finite temperature phase transitions, our model possesses\nsufficiently many energy eigenstates below the critical energy density to allow\nus to make a definitive statement about the presence of eigenstate\nthermalization and chaotic level statistics in the broken-symmetry phase.\n", "  We propose a new approach for studying pion fluctuation for deeper\nunderstanding of the dynamical process involved, from a perspective of\nfBm-based complex network analysis method called Visibility graph Analysis.\nThis chaos-based, rigorous, non-linear technique is applied to study the\nerratic behavior of multipion production in \\pi^{-}-Ag/Br interactions at 350\nGeV. This method can offer reliable results with finite data points. The Power\nof Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph denoted by-PSVG is a measure of\nfractality, which can be used as a quantitative parameter for the assessment of\nthe state of a chaotic system. The event-wise fluctuation of the multipion\nproduction process can be described by this parameter-PSVG. From the analysis\nof the PSVG parameter, we can quantitatively confirm that fractal behavior of\nthe particle production process depends on the target excitation and also the\nfractality decreases with the increase of target excitation.\n", "  A new detector, the Fermilab Holometer, consists of separate yet identical\n39-meter Michelson interferometers. Strain sensitivity achieved is better than\n$10^{-21} /{\\sqrt{\\rm{Hz}}}$ between 1 to 13 MHz from a 130-hr dataset. This\nmeasurement exceeds the sensitivity and frequency range made from previous high\nfrequency gravitational wave experiments by many orders of magnitude.\nConstraints are placed on a stochastic background at 382 Hz resolution. The\n3$\\sigma$ upper limit on $\\Omega_{\\rm{GW}}$, the gravitational wave energy\ndensity normalized to the closure density, ranges from $5.6 \\times 10^{12}$ at\n1 MHz to $8.4 \\times 10^{15}$ at 13 MHz. Another result from the same dataset\nis a search for nearby primordial black hole binaries (PBHB). There are no\ndetectable monochromatic PBHBs in the mass range $0.83$ - $3.5 \\times 10^{21}$g\nbetween the earth and the moon. Projections for a chirp search with the same\ndataset increases the mass range to $0.59 - 2.5 \\times 10^{25}$g and distances\nout to Jupiter. This result presents a new method for placing limits on a\npoorly constrained mass range of primordial black holes. Additionally, solar\nsystem searches for PBHBs place limits on their contribution to the total dark\nmatter fraction.\n", "  The gate version of quantum computation exploits several quantum key\nresources as superposition and entanglement to reach an outstanding\nperformance. In the way, this theory was constructed adopting certain supposed\nprocesses imitating classical computer gates. As for optical as well as\nmagnetic systems, those gates are obtained as quantum evolutions. Despite, in\ncertain cases they are attained as an asymptotic series of evolution effects.\nThe current work exploits the direct sum of the evolution operator on a\nnon-local basis for the driven bipartite Heisenberg-Ising model to construct a\nset of equivalent universal gates as straight evolutions for this interaction.\nThe prescriptions to get these gates are reported as well as a general\nprocedure to evaluate their performance.\n", "  We present polarization resolved Raman scattering study of surface vibration\nmodes in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ single crystal and thick films.\nBesides the four Raman active bulk phonons, we observed four additional modes\nwith much weaker intensity and slightly lower energy than the bulk\ncounterparts. Using symmetry analysis, we assigned these additional modes to\nout-of-plane surface phonons. Comparing with first principle calculations, we\nconclude that the appearance of these modes is due to $c$-axis lattice\ndistortion and van der Waals gap expansion near the crystal surface. Two of the\nsurface modes at 60 and 173 cm$^{-1}$ are associated with Raman active $A_{1g}$\nbulk phonon modes, the other two at 136 and 158 cm$^{-1}$ are associated with\ninfrared active bulk phonons with $A_{2u}$ symmetry. The latter become Raman\nallowed due to reduction of crystalline symmetry from $D_{3d}$ in the bulk to\n$C_{3v}$ on the crystal surface. In particular, the 158 cm$^{-1}$ surface\nphonon mode shows a Fano lineshape under resonant excitation, suggesting\ninterference in the presence of electron-phonon coupling of the surface\nexcitations.\n", "  Novelty attracts attention like popularity. Hence predicting novelty is as\nimportant as popularity. Novelty is the side effect of competition and aging in\nevolving systems. Recent behavior or recent link gain in networks plays an\nimportant role in emergence or trend. We exploited this wisdom and came up with\ntwo models considering different scenarios and systems. Where recent behavior\ndominates over total behavior (total link gain) in the first one, and recent\nbehavior is as important as total behavior for future link gain in second one.\nIt suppose that random walker walks on a network and can jump to any node, the\nprobablity of jumping or making connection to other node is based on which node\nis recently more active or receiving more links. In our assumption random\nwalker can also jump to node which is already popular but recently not popular.\nWe are able to predict rising novelties or popular nodes which is generally\nsuppressed under preferential attachment effect. To show performance of our\nmodel we have conducted experiments on four real data sets namely, MovieLens,\nNetflix, Facebook and Arxiv High Energy Physics paper citation. For testing our\nmodel we used four information retrieval indices namely Precision, Novelty,\nArea Under Receiving Operating Characteristic(AUC) and Kendal's rank\ncorrelation coefficient. We have used four benchmark models for validating our\nproposed models. Although our model doesn't perform better in all the cases\nbut, it has theoretical significance in working better for recent behavior\ndominant systems.\n", "  We examine if the cosmological relaxation mechanism, which was proposed\nrecently as a new solution to the hierarchy problem, can be compatible with\nhigh reheating temperature well above the weak scale. As the barrier potential\ndisappears at high temperature, the relaxion rolls down further after the\nreheating, which may ruin the successful implementation of the relaxation\nmechanism. It is noted that if the relaxion is coupled to a dark gauge boson,\nthe new frictional force arising from dark gauge boson production can\nefficiently slow down the relaxion motion, which allows the relaxion to be\nstabilized after the electroweak phase transition for a wide range of model\nparameters, while satisfying the known observational constraints.\n", "  We show that Spatially Inhomogeneous (SI) and Irrotational dust models admit\na \\emph{6-dimensional algebra } of \\emph{Intrinsic Conformal Vector Fields}\n(ICVFs) $\\mathbf{X}_{\\alpha }$ satisfying\n$p_{a}^{c}p_{b}^{d}\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathbf{X}_{\\alpha }}p_{cd}=2\\phi\n(\\mathbf{X}_{\\alpha })p_{ab}$ where $p_{ab}$ is the associated metric of the 2d\ndistribution $\\mathcal{X}$ normal to the fluid velocity $u^{a}$ and the radial\nunit spacelike vector field $x^{a}$. The Intrinsic Conformal (IC) algebra is\ndetermined for each of the curvature value $\\epsilon $ that characterizes the\nstructure of the screen space $\\mathcal{X}$. In addition the conformal flatness\nof the hypersurfaces $\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{0}$ indicates the existence of a\n\\emph{% 10-dimensional algebra} of ICVFs of the 3d metric $h_{ab}$. We\nillustrate this expectation and propose a method to derive them by giving\nexplicitly the \\emph{7 proper} ICVFs of the Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB)\nmodel which represents the simplest subclass within the Szekeres family.\n", "  It is expected that in a hot QCD system, a local parity-odd domain can be\nproduced due to nonzero chirality, which is induced from the difference of\nwinding numbers carried by the gluon topological configuration (QCD sphaleron).\nThis local domain is called the chiral-imbalance medium characterized by\nnonzero chiral chemical potential, which can be interpreted as the time\nvariation of the strong CP phase. We find that the chiral chemical potential\ngenerates the parity breaking term in the electromagnetic form factor of\ncharged pions. Heavy ion collision experiments could observe the\nphenomenological consequence of this parity-odd form factor through the elastic\nscattering of a pion and a photon in the medium. Then we quantify the asymmetry\nrate of the parity violation by measuring the polarization of the photon\nassociated with the pion, and discuss how it could be measured in a definite\nlab frame. We roughly estimate the typical size of the asymmetry, just by\npicking up the pion resonant process, and find that the signal can be\nsufficiently larger than possible background events from parity-breaking\nelectroweak process. Our findings might provide a novel possibility to make a\nmanifest detection for the remnant of the strong CP violation.\n", "  We study thermodynamical structure of Einstein black holes in the presence of\npower Maxwell invariant nonlinear electrodynamics for two different cases. The\nbehavior of the temperature and conditions regarding the stability of these\nblack holes are investigated. Since the language of geometry is an effective\nmethod in general relativity, we concentrate on the geometrical thermodynamics\nto build a phase space for studying phase transition. In addition, taking into\naccount the denominator of the heat capacity, we use the proportionality\nbetween cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure to extract the\ncritical values for these black holes. Besides, the effects of the variation of\ndifferent parameters on thermodynamical structure of these black holes are\ninvestigated. In addition, some thermodynamical properties such as volume\nexpansion coefficient, speed of sound and isothermal compressibility\ncoefficient are calculated and some remarks regarding these quantities are\ngiven.\n", "  Accurate forward modeling of weak lensing (WL) observables from cosmological\nparameters is necessary for upcoming galaxy surveys. Because WL probes\nstructures in the non-linear regime, analytical forward modeling is very\nchallenging, if not impossible. Numerical simulations of WL features rely on\nray-tracing through the outputs of $N$-body simulations, which requires\nknowledge of the gravitational potential and accurate solvers for light ray\ntrajectories. A less accurate procedure, based on the Born approximation, only\nrequires knowledge of the density field, and can be implemented more\nefficiently and at a lower computational cost. In this work, we use simulations\nto show that deviations of the Born-approximated convergence power spectrum,\nskewness and kurtosis from their fully ray--traced counterparts are consistent\nwith the smallest non-trivial $O(\\Phi^3)$ post-Born corrections (so-called\ngeodesic and lens-lens terms). Our results imply a cancellation among the\nlarger $O(\\Phi^4)$ (and higher order) terms, consistent with previous analytic\nwork. We also find that cosmological parameter bias induced by the Born\napproximated power spectrum is negligible even for an LSST-like survey, once\ngalaxy shape noise is considered. When considering higher order statistics such\nas the $\\kappa$ skewness and kurtosis, however, we find significant bias of up\nto 2.5$\\sigma$. Using the LensTools software suite, we show that the Born\napproximation saves a factor of 4 in computing time with respect to the full\nray-tracing in reconstructing the convergence.\n", "  Over the last 15 years there has been considerable interest in the\npossibility of quantum-gravity-induced in-vacuo dispersion, the possibility\nthat spacetime itself might behave essentially like a dispersive medium for\nparticle propagation. Two very recent studies have exposed what might be\nin-vacuo dispersion features for GRB (gamma-ray-burst) neutrinos of energy in\nthe range of 100 TeV and for GRB photons with energy in the range of 10 GeV. We\nhere show that these two features are roughly compatible with a description\nsuch that the same effects apply over 4 orders of magnitude in energy. We also\ncharacterize quantitatively how rare it would be for such features to arise\naccidentally, as a result of (still unknown) aspects of the mechanisms\nproducing photons at GRBs or as a result of background neutrinos accidentally\nfitting the profile of a GRB neutrino affected by in-vacuo dispersion.\n", "  We show that the stellar surface-brightness profiles in disc\ngalaxies---observed to be approximately exponential---can be explained if\nradial migration efficiently scrambles the individual stars' angular momenta\nwhile conserving the circularity of the orbits and the total mass and angular\nmomentum. In this case the disc's distribution of specific angular momenta $j$\nshould be near a maximum-entropy state and therefore approximately exponential,\n$dN\\propto\\exp(-j/\\langle j\\rangle)dj$. This distribution translates to a\nsurface-density profile that is generally not an exponential function of\nradius: $\\Sigma(R)\\propto\\exp[-R/R_e(R)]/(RR_e(R))(1+d\\log v_c(R)/d\\log R)$,\nfor a rotation curve $v_c(R)$ and $R_e(R)\\equiv\\langle j\\rangle/v_c(R)$. We\nshow that such a profile matches the observed surface-brightness profiles of\ndisc-dominated galaxies as well as the empirical exponential profile. Disc\ngalaxies that exhibit population gradients cannot have fully reached a\nmaximum-entropy state but appear to be close enough that their\nsurface-brightness profiles are well-fit by this idealized model.\n", "  Hadronic observables in the final stage of heavy ion collision can be\ndescribed well by fluid dynamics or blast wave parameterizations. We improve\nexisting blast wave models by adding shear viscous corrections to the particle\ndistributions in the Navier-Stokes approximation. The specific shear viscosity\n$\\eta/s$ of a hadron gas at the freeze-out temperature is a new parameter in\nthis model. We extract the blast wave parameters with viscous corrections from\nexperimental data which leads to constraints on the specific shear viscosity at\nkinetic freeze-out. Preliminary results show $\\eta/s$ is rather small.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dispersion relation of small-amplitude\noptical waves superimposing upon a beam of polarized monochromatic light\npropagating along a single-mode channel waveguide characterized by an\ninstantaneous and spatially local Kerr nonlinearity. These small luminous\nfluctuations propagate along the waveguide as Bogoliubov elementary excitations\non top of a one-dimensional dilute Bose quantum fluid evolve in time. They\nconsequently display a strongly renormalized dispersion law, of Bogoliubov\ntype. Analytical and numerical results are found in both the absence and the\npresence of one- and two-photon losses. Silicon and silicon-nitride waveguides\nare used as examples. We finally propose an experiment to measure this\nBogoliubov dispersion relation, based on a stimulated four-wave mixing and\ninterference spectroscopy techniques.\n", "  The manipulation of the magnetization by spin-orbit torques (SOTs) has\nrecently been extensively studied due to its potential for efficiently writing\ninformation in magnetic memories. Particular attention is paid to\nnon-centrosymmetric systems with space inversion asymmetry, where SOTs emerge\neven in single-layer materials. The half-metallic half-Heusler PtMnSb is an\ninteresting candidate for studies of this intrinsic SOT. Here, we report on the\ngrowth and epitaxial properties of PtMnSb thin films and PtMnSb/Pt bilayers\ndeposited on MgO(001) substrates by dc magnetron co-sputtering at high\ntemperature in ultra-high vacuum. The film properties were investigated by\nx-ray diffraction, x-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, and electron\nmicroscopy. Thin PtMnSb films present a monocrystalline C1b phase with (001)\norientation, coexisting at increasing thickness with a polycrystalline phase\nwith (111) texture. Films thinner than about 5 nm grow in islands, whereas\nthicker films grow layer-by-layer, forming a perfect MgO/PtMnSb interface. The\nthin PtMnSb/Pt bilayers also show island growth and a defective transition\nzone, while thicker films grow layer-by-layer and Pt grows epitaxially on the\nhalf-Heusler compound without significant interdiffusion.\n", "  Turbulence intensity profiles are compared for smooth- and rough-wall pipe\nflow measurements made in the Princeton Superpipe. The profile development in\nthe transition from hydraulically smooth to fully rough flow displays a\npropagating sequence from the pipe wall towards the pipe axis. The scaling of\nturbulence intensity with Reynolds number shows that the smooth- and rough wall\nlevel deviates with increasing Reynolds number. We quantify the correspondence\nbetween turbulence intensity and the friction factor.\n", "  Material losses in metals are a central bottleneck in plasmonics for many\napplications. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that metal losses\ncan be successfully mitigated with dielectric particles on metallic films,\ngiving rise to hybrid dielectric--metal resonances. In the far field, they\nyield strong and efficient scattering, beyond even the theoretical limits of\nall-metal and all-dielectric structures. In the near field, they offer\nhigh-Purcell-factor (${>}5000$), high-quantum-efficiency (${>}90\\%$), and\nhighly directional emission at visible and infrared wavelengths. Their quality\nfactors can be readily tailored from plasmonic-like (${\\sim}10$) to\ndielectric-like (${\\sim}10^3$), with wide control over the individual resonant\ncoupling to photon, plasmon, and dissipative channels. Compared with\nconventional plasmonic nanostructures, such resonances show robustness against\ndetrimental nonlocal effects and provide higher field enhancement at extreme\nnanoscopic sizes and spacings. These hybrid resonances equip plasmonics with\nhigh efficiency, which has been the predominant goal since the field's\ninception.\n", "  Many existing schemes for linear-optical quantum computing (LOQC) depend on\nmultiplexing (MUX), which uses dynamic routing to enable near-deterministic\ngates and sources to be constructed using heralded, probabilistic primitives.\nMUXing accounts for the overwhelming majority of active switching demands in\ncurrent LOQC architectures. In this manuscript, we introduce relative\nmultiplexing (RMUX), a general-purpose optimization which can dramatically\nreduce the active switching requirements for MUX in LOQC, and thereby reduce\nhardware complexity and energy consumption, as well as relaxing demands on\nperformance for various photonic components. We discuss the application of RMUX\nto the generation of entangled states from probabilistic single-photon sources,\nand argue that an order of magnitude improvement in the rate of generation of\nBell states can be achieved. In addition, we apply RMUX to the proposal for\npercolation of a 3D cluster state in [PRL 115, 020502 (2015)], and we find that\nRMUX allows a 2.4x increase in loss tolerance for this architecture.\n", "  Based on the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of cosmological perturbations, we\nexplicitly clarify the pathology in nonsingular cubic Galileon models and show\nhow to cure it in EFT with new insights into this issue. With the least set of\nEFT operators that are capable to avoid instabilities in nonsingular\ncosmologies, we construct a nonsingular model dubbed the Genesis-inflation\nmodel, in which a slowly expanding phase (namely, Genesis) with increasing\nenergy density is followed by slow-roll inflation. The spectrum of the\nprimordial perturbation may be simulated numerically, which shows itself a\nlarge-scale cutoff, as the large-scale anomalies in CMB might be a hint for.\n", "  In this paper we review various models of curvature singularity free black\nholes. In the first part of the review we describe semi-classical solutions of\nthe Einstein equations which, however, contains a \"quantum\" input through the\nmatter source. We start by reviewing the early model by Bardeen where the\nmetric is regularized by-hand through a short-distance cut-off, which is\njustified in terms of non-linear electro-dynamical effects. This a toy-model\nmodel useful to point-out the common features shared by all regular\nsemi-classical black holes. Then, we solve Einstein equations with a Gaussian\nsource encoding the quantum spread of an elementary particle. We identify, the\na priori arbitrary, Gaussian width with the Compton wavelength of the quantum\nparticle. This Compton-Gauss model leads to the estimate of a terminal density\nthat a gravitationally collapsed object can achieve. We identify this density\nto be the Planck density, and reformulate the Gaussian model assuming this as\nits peak density. All these models, are physically reliable as long as the\nblack hole mass is big enough with respect to the Planck mass. In the truly\nPlanckian regime, the semi-classical approximation breaks down. In this case, a\nfully quantum black hole description is needed. In the last part of this paper,\nwe propose a non-geometrical quantum model of Planckian black hole implementing\nthe Holographic Principle and realizing the \"classicalization\" scenario\nrecently introduced by Dvali and collaborators. The classical relation between\nthe mass and radius of the black hole emerges only in the classical limit, far\naway from the Planck scale.\n", "  Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation properties,\nwith a promise for many applications. However, their use in ion sieving and\ndesalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of ~9 Angstrom,\nwhich is larger than hydrated ion diameters for common salts. The cutoff is\ndetermined by the interlayer spacing d ~13.5 Angstrom, typical for graphene\noxide laminates that swell in water. Achieving smaller d for the laminates\nimmersed in water has proved to be a challenge.Here we describe how to control\nd by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tuneable ion sieving.\nMembranes with d from ~ 9.8 Angstrom to 6.4 Angstrom are demonstrated,\nproviding the sieve size smaller than typical ions' hydrated diameters.In this\nregime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers\nof ~10-100 kJ/mol depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease\nexponentially with decreasing the sieve size but water transport is weakly\naffected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for\nwater molecules entry and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.\nBuilding on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain\ngraphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for\nNaCl.\n", "  Virtually all real-world networks are dynamical entities. In social networks,\nthe propensity of nodes to engage in social interactions (activity) and their\nchances to be selected by active nodes (attractiveness) are heterogeneously\ndistributed. Here, we present a time-varying network model where each node and\nthe dynamical formation of ties are characterised by these two features. We\nstudy how these properties affect random walk processes unfolding on the\nnetwork when the time scales describing the process and the network evolution\nare comparable. We derive analytical solutions for the stationary state and the\nmean first passage time of the process and we study cases informed by empirical\nobservations of social networks. Our work shows that previously disregarded\nproperties of real social systems such heterogeneous distributions of activity\nand attractiveness as well as the correlations between them, substantially\naffect the dynamical process unfolding on the network.\n", "  We present a first model-independent calculation of $\\pi\\pi$ intermediate\nstates in the hadronic-light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the muon $(g-2)_\\mu$ that goes beyond the scalar QED pion\nloop. To this end we combine a recently developed dispersive description of the\nHLbL tensor with a partial-wave expansion and demonstrate that the known\nscalar-QED result is recovered after partial-wave resummation. Using dispersive\nfits to high-statistics data for the pion vector form factor, we provide an\nevaluation of the full pion box, $a_\\mu^{\\pi\\text{-box}}=-15.9(2)\\times\n10^{-11}$. We then construct suitable input for the $\\gamma^*\\gamma^*\\to\\pi\\pi$\nhelicity partial waves based on a pion-pole left-hand cut and show that for the\ndominant charged-pion contribution this representation is consistent with the\ntwo-loop chiral prediction and the COMPASS measurement for the pion\npolarizability. This allows us to reliably estimate $S$-wave rescattering\neffects to the full pion box and leads to our final estimate for the sum of\nthese two contributions: $a_\\mu^{\\pi\\text{-box}} +\na_{\\mu,J=0}^{\\pi\\pi,\\pi\\text{-pole LHC}}=-24(1)\\times 10^{-11}$.\n", "  We evaluated the uncertainty relevant to s-process nucleosynthesis using a\nMonte-Carlo centred approach. We are based on a realistic and general\nprescription of temperature dependent uncertainty for the reactions. We\nconsidered massive stars for the weak s-process and AGB stars for the main\ns-process. We found that the adopted uncertainty for (n,$\\gamma$) rates, tens\nof per cent on average, affect the production of s-process nuclei along the\n$\\beta$-stability line, while for $\\beta$-decay, for which contributions from\nexcited states enhances the uncertainty, has the strongest impact on branching\npoints.\n", "  We introduce a new set of simplified models to address the effects of 3-point\ninteractions between the dark matter particle, its dark co-annihilation\npartner, and the Standard Model degree of freedom, which we take to be the tau\nlepton. The contributions from dark matter co-annihilation channels are highly\nrelevant for a determination of the correct relic abundance. We investigate\nthese effects as well as the discovery potential for dark matter\nco-annihilation partners at the LHC. A small mass splitting between the dark\nmatter and its partner is preferred by the co-annihilation mechanism and\nsuggests that the co-annihilation partners may be long-lived (stable or\nmeta-stable) at collider scales. It is argued that such long-lived electrically\ncharged particles can be looked for at the LHC in searches of anomalous charged\ntracks. This approach and the underlying models provide an\nalternative/complementarity to the mono-jet and multi-jet based dark matter\nsearches widely used in the context of simplified models with the s-channel\nmediators. We consider four types of simplified models with different particle\nspins and coupling structures. Some of these models are manifestly gauge\ninvariant and renormalizable, others would ultimately require a UV completion.\nThese can be realised in terms of supersymmetric models in the neutralino-stau\nco-annihilation regime, as well as models with extra dimensions or composite\nmodels.\n", "  We report on the controllable pinning of domain walls in stripes with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy by magnetostatic coupling to magnetic\nvortices in disks located above the stripe. Pinning mechanisms and depinning\nfields are reported. This novel pinning strategy, which can be realized by\ncurrent nanofabrication techniques, opens up new possibilities for the\nnon-destructive control of domain wall mobility in domain wall based spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  We calculate the two leading-twist transverse momentum dependent distribution\nfunctions of the pion meson, the unpolarized distribution\n$f_{1\\pi}(x,\\bm{k}^2_T)$ and the Boer-Mulders function $h_{1\\pi}^\\perp\n(x,\\bm{k}^2_T)$, using the pion wave functions derived from a light-cone\napproach. The evolution effect of the first $\\bm k_T$-moment of the pion\nBoer-Mulders function is studied by employing an approximate evolution kernel.\nUsing the model resulting distributions, we predict the transverse momentum\nweighted $\\cos2\\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in the unpolarized $\\pi^- p$ Drell-Yan\nprocess which can be measured at COMPASS in the near future.\n", "  Recognized as important interstellar constituents, polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) have been intensively studied in astrochemistry and their\nspectroscopy, thermodynamics, dynamics, and fragmentations are now amply\ndocumented. There exists typical alternatives to the ground-state regular\nplanar structures of PAHs, as long as they bear internal energies in the range\n1-10 eV. Resulting from intramolecular rearrangements, such high-lying minima\non the potential- energy surfaces should be taken into consideration in the\nstudies of PAH processing in astrophysical conditions. Resting upon DFT\ncalculations mainly performed on two emblematic PAH representatives, coronene\nand pyrene, in their neutral and mono and multi-cationic states, this second\nsurvey addresses the following alternatives: (1) opened forms containing\nethynyl or 2- butynyl groups, (2) vinylidene isomers, in which phenanthrene\npatterns are reorganized into dibenzofulvene ones, (3) twisted forms, where\nexternal CH=CH bonds can be partly twisted, and (4) bicyclobutane forms, in\nwhich the latter are integrated in saturated bicyclic forms. A few scenarios\nfor elimination of fragments H, H2, C2H2 and C2H4 are explored. As far as\npossible, familiar concepts of organic chemistry, such as aromaticity or Clar's\nrules, are invoked for interpretations.\n", "  The PAH family of organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons),\ninvolved in several fields of chemistry, has received particular attention in\nastrochemistry, where their vibrational spectroscopy, thermodynamic, dynamic,\nand fragmentation properties are now abundantly documented. This survey aims at\ndrawing trends for low spin-multiplicity surfaces of PAHs bearing internal\nenergies in the range 1-10 eV. It addresses some typical alternatives to the\nground-state regular structures of PAHs, making explicit possible\nintramolecular rearrangements leading to high-lying minima. These\nisomerisations should be taken into consideration when addressing PAH\nprocessing in astrophysical conditions. The first part of this double-entry\nstudy focuses on the hydrogen-shifted forms, which bear both a carbene center\nand a saturated carbon. It rests upon DFT calculations mainly performed on two\nemblematic PAH representatives, coronene and pyrene, in their neutral and mono\nand multi-cationic states. Systematically searched for in neutral species,\nthese H-shifted minima are lying 4-5 eV above the regular all-conjugated forms,\nand are separated by barriers of about one eV. General hydrogen-shifting is\nfound to be easier for cationic species as the relative energies of their\nH-shifted minima are 1-1.5 eV lower than those for neutral species. As much as\npossible, classical knowledge and concepts of organic chemistry such as\naromaticity and Clar's rules are invoked for result interpretation.\n", "  Numerical heating in particle-in-cell (PIC) codes currently precludes the\naccurate simulation of cold, relativistic plasma over long periods, severely\nlimiting their applications in astrophysical environments. We present a\nspatially higher-order accurate relativistic PIC algorithm in one spatial\ndimension, which conserves charge and momentum exactly. We utilize the\nsmoothness implied by the usage of higher-order interpolation functions to\nachieve a spatially higher-order accurate algorithm (up to fifth order). We\nvalidate our algorithm against several test problems -- thermal stability of\nstationary plasma, stability of linear plasma waves, and two-stream instability\nin the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. Comparing our simulations to\nexact solutions of the dispersion relations, we demonstrate that SHARP can\nquantitatively reproduce important kinetic features of the linear regime. Our\nsimulations have a superior ability to control energy non-conservation and\navoid numerical heating in comparison to common second-order schemes. We\nprovide a natural definition for convergence of a general PIC algorithm: the\ncomplement of physical modes captured by the simulation, i.e., those that lie\nabove the Poisson noise, must grow commensurately with the resolution. This\nimplies that it is necessary to simultaneously increase the number of particles\nper cell and decrease the cell size. We demonstrate that traditional ways for\ntesting for convergence fail, leading to plateauing of the energy error. This\nnew PIC code enables us to faithfully study the long-term evolution of plasma\nproblems that require absolute control of the energy and momentum conservation.\n", "  Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) in nonlinear optical media is a powerful\ntool for temporal-mode selective manipulation of light. Recent attempts at\nachieving high mode selectivities and/or fidelities have had to resort to\nmulti-dimensional optimization schemes to determine the system's natural\nSchmidt modes. Certain combinations of relative-group velocities between the\nrelevant frequency bands, medium length, and temporal pulse widths have been\nknown to achieve good selectivities (exceeding 80%) for temporal modes that are\nnearly identical to pump pulse shapes, even for high conversion efficiencies.\nWorking in this parameter regime using an off-the-shelf, second-harmonic\ngeneration, MgO:PPLN waveguide, and with pulses on the order of 500 fs at\nwavelengths around 800 nm, we verify experimentally that model-predicted\nSchmidt modes provide the high temporal-mode selectivity expected. This paves\nthe way to the implementation of a proposed two-stage QFC scheme that is\npredicted to reach near-perfect (100%) selectivity.\n", "  Atoms in high-finesse optical resonators interact via the photons they\nmultiply scatter into the cavity modes. The dynamics is characterized by\ndispersive and dissipative optomechanical long-range forces, which are mediated\nby the cavity photons, and exhibits a steady state for certain parameter\nregimes. In standing-wave cavities the atoms can form stable spatial gratings.\nMoreover, their asymptotic distribution is a Maxwell-Boltzmann whose effective\ntemperature is controlled by the laser parameters. In this work we show that in\na two-mode standing-wave cavity the stationary state possesses the same\nproperties and phases of the Generalized Hamiltonian Mean Field model in the\ncanonical ensemble. This model has three equilibrium phases: a paramagnetic, a\nnematic, and a ferromagnetic one, which here correspond to different spatial\norders of the atomic gas and can be detected by means of the light emitted by\nthe cavities. We further discuss perspectives for investigating in this setup\nthe ensemble inequivalence predicted for the Generalized Hamiltonian Mean Field\nmodel.\n", "  The complete spectrum of $c\\bar{b}$ states is obtained in a phenomenological\nnon relativistic quark model(NRQM), which consists of a confinement potential\nand one gluon exchange potential (OGEP) as effective quark - antiquark\npotential with coupled channel effects. We make predictions for the radiative\ndecay (E1 and M1) widths and weak decay widths of $c\\bar{b}$ states in the\nframework of NRQM formalism.\n", "  To reduce the level of thermally generated electrical noise transmitted to\nsuperconducting quantum devices operating at 20 mK, we have developed thin-film\nmicrowave power attenuators operating from 1 to 10 GHz. The 20 dB and 30 dB\nattenuators are built on a quartz substrate and use 75 nm thick films of\nnichrome for dissipative components and 0.001 mm thick silver films as hot\nelectron heat sinks. The noise temperature of the attenuators was quantified by\nconnecting the output to a 3D cavity containing a transmon qubit and extracting\nthe dephasing rate of the qubit as a function of temperature and dissipated\npower P_d in the attenuator. The minimum noise temperature T_n of the output\nfrom the 20 dB attenuator was T_n less than and equal to 53 mK for no\nadditional applied power and T_n about 120 mK when dissipating 30 nW. In the\nlimit of large dissipated power (P_d > 1 nW) we find T_n proportional to\nP_d^(1/5.4), consistent with detailed thermal modeling of heat flow in the\nattenuators.\n", "  When a droplet gently lands on an atomically smooth substrate, it will most\nlikely contact the underlying surface in about 0.1 s. However, theoretical\nestimation from fluid mechanics predicts a contact time of 10 to 100 s. What\ncauses this large discrepancy, and how does nature speed up contact by 2 orders\nof magnitude? To probe this fundamental question, we prepare atomically smooth\nsubstrates by either coating a liquid film on glass or using a freshly cleaved\nmica surface, and visualize the droplet contact dynamics with 30 nm resolution.\nInterestingly, we discover two distinct speed-up approaches: (1) droplet\nskidding due to even minute perturbations breaks rotational symmetry and\nproduces early contact at the thinnest gap location, and (2) for the\nunperturbed situation with rotational symmetry, a previously unnoticed boundary\nflow around only 0.1 mm/s expedites air drainage by over 1 order of magnitude.\nTogether, these two mechanisms universally explain general contact phenomena on\nsmooth substrates. The fundamental discoveries shed new light on contact and\ndrainage research.\n", "  Based on the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic quantum\nchromodynamics (NRQCD), we calculate the production cross section for the\ncharmonium and the bottomonium produced by the hard photoproduction processes\nand fragmentation processes in relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is shown\nthat the existing experimental data on heavy quarkonium production at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) can be described in the framework of the NRQCD formalism,\nand the phenomenological values of matrix elements for color-singlet and\ncolor-octet components give the main contribution. The numerical results of\nphotoproduction processes and fragmentation processes for the heavy quarkonium\nproduction become prominent in p-p collisions and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC\nenergies.\n", "  We study atypically large fluctuations of height $H$ in the 1+1-dimensional\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation at long times $t$, when starting from a\n\"droplet\" initial condition. We derive exact large deviation function of height\nfor $\\lambda H<0$, where $\\lambda$ is the nonlinearity coefficient of the KPZ\nequation. This large deviation function describes a crossover from the\nTracy-Widom distribution tail at small $|H|/t$, which scales as $|H|^3/t$, to a\ndifferent tail at large $|H|/t$, which scales as $|H|^{5/2}/t^{1/2}$. The\nlatter tail exists at all times $t>0$. It was previously obtained in the\nframework of the optimal fluctuation method. It was also obtained at short\ntimes from exact representation of the complete height statistics. The\ncrossover between the two tails, at long times, occurs at $|H|\\sim t$ as\npreviously conjectured. Our analytical findings are supported by numerical\nevaluations using exact representation of the complete height statistics.\n", "  3D-Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) reconstructs nerve fibers in histological\nbrain sections by measuring their birefringence. This study investigates\nanother effect caused by the optical anisotropy of brain tissue -\ndiattenuation. Based on numerical and experimental studies and a complete\nanalytical description of the optical system, the diattenuation was determined\nto be below 4 % in rat brain tissue. It was demonstrated that the diattenuation\neffect has negligible impact on the fiber orientations derived by 3D-PLI. The\ndiattenuation signal, however, was found to highlight different anatomical\nstructures that cannot be distinguished with current imaging techniques, which\nmakes Diattenuation Imaging a promising extension to 3D-PLI.\n", "  Phase compensated optical fiber links enable high accuracy atomic clocks\nseparated by thousands of kilometers to be compared with unprecedented\nstatistical resolution. By searching for a daily variation of the frequency\ndifference between four strontium optical lattice clocks in different locations\nthroughout Europe connected by such links, we improve upon previous tests of\ntime dilation predicted by special relativity. We obtain a constraint on the\nRobertson--Mansouri--Sexl parameter $|\\alpha|\\lesssim 1.1 \\times10^{-8}$\nquantifying a violation of time dilation, thus improving by a factor of around\ntwo the best known constraint obtained with Ives--Stilwell type experiments,\nand by two orders of magnitude the best constraint obtained by comparing atomic\nclocks. This work is the first of a new generation of tests of fundamental\nphysics using optical clocks and fiber links. As clocks improve, and as fiber\nlinks are routinely operated, we expect that the tests initiated in this paper\nwill improve by orders of magnitude in the near future.\n", "  Hybrid structures of quantum spin-Hall insulators (QSHIs) and superconductors\n(Ss) present a unique opportunity to access dissipationless topological states\nof matter, which, however, is frequently hindered by the lack of control over\nthe spin polarization in QSHIs. We propose a very efficient spin-polarization\nmechanism based on the magnetoelectric (Edelstein) effect in superconducting\nQSHI structures. It acts akin to the Zeeman splitting in an external magnetic\nfield, but with an effective $g$-factor of order of 1000, resulting in an\nunprecedented spin-splitting effect. It allows a magnetic control of the QSHI/S\nhybrids without destroying superconductivity. As an example, we demonstrate a\nrecurrent crossover from $\\Phi_0$ - to $\\Phi_0/2$ - periodic oscillations of\nthe Josephson current in an rf superconducting quantum interference device\n($\\Phi_0=h/2e$ is the magnetic flux quantum). The predicted period halving is a\nstriking manifestation of $0-\\pi$ Josephson transitions with a superharmonic\n$\\pi$-periodic current-phase relationship at the transition. Such controllable\n$0-\\pi$ transitions may offer new perspectives for dissipationless spintronics\nand engineering flux qubits.\n", "  In quantum computation with continous-variable systems, quantum advantage can\nonly be achieved if some non-Gaussian resource is available. Yet, non-Gaussian\nunitary evolutions and measurements suited for computation are challenging to\nrealize in the lab. We propose and analyze two methods to apply a polynomial\napproximation of any unitary operator diagonal in the amplitude quadrature\nrepresentation, including non-Gaussian operators, to an unknown input state.\nOur protocols use as a primary non-Gaussian resource a single-photon counter.\nWe use the fidelity of the transformation with the target one on Fock and\ncoherent states to assess the quality of the approximate gate.\n", "  Clustering methods are an important tool to enumerate and describe the\ndifferent coherent kinds of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). But their performance can\nbe affected by a number of factors such as the choice of clustering algorithm\nand inherent associated assumptions, the inclusion of variables in clustering,\nnature of initialization methods used or the iterative algorithm or the\ncriterion used to judge the optimal number of groups supported by the data. We\nanalyzed GRBs from the BATSE 4Br catalog using $k$-means and Gaussian Mixture\nModels-based clustering methods and found that after accounting for all the\nabove factors, all six variables -- different subsets of which have been used\nin the literature -- and that are, namely, the flux duration variables\n($T_{50}$, $T_{90}$), the peak flux ($P_{256}$) measured in 256-millisecond\nbins, the total fluence ($F_t$) and the spectral hardness ratios ($H_{32}$ and\n$H_{321}$) contain information on clustering. Further, our analysis found\nevidence of five different kinds of GRBs and that these groups have different\nkinds of dispersions in terms of shape, size and orientation. In terms of\nduration, fluence and spectrum, the five types of GRBs were characterized as\nintermediate/faint/intermediate, long/intermediate/soft,\nintermediate/intermediate/intermediate, short/faint/hard and\nlong/bright/intermediate.\n", "  A tunable, all-optical, coupling method has been realized for a\nhigh-\\textit{Q} silica microsphere and an optical waveguide. By means of a\nnovel optical nanopositioning method, induced thermal expansion of an\nasymmetric microsphere stem for laser powers up to 171~mW has been observed and\nused to fine tune the microsphere-waveguide coupling. Microcavity displacements\nranging from (0.612~$\\pm$~0.13) -- (1.5 $\\pm$ 0.13) $\\mu$m and nanometer scale\nsensitivities varying from (2.81 $\\pm$ 0.08) -- (7.39 $\\pm$ 0.17) nm/mW, with\nan apparent linear dependency of coupling distance on stem laser heating, were\nobtained. Using this method, the coupling was altered such that different\ncoupling regimes could be explored for particular samples. This tunable\ncoupling method, in principle, could be incorporated into lab-on-a-chip\nmicroresonator systems, photonic molecule systems, and other nanopositioning\nframeworks.\n", "  The ARGO-YBJ detector, located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300\nm a. s. l., Tibet, China), was a full coverage air shower array dedicated to\ngamma ray astronomy and cosmic ray studies. The wide field of view (~ 2 sr) and\nhigh duty cycle (> 86%), made ARGO-YBJ suitable to search for short and\nunexpected gamma ray emissions like gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Between 2007\nNovember 6 and 2013 February 7, 156 satellite-triggered GRBs (24 of them with\nknown redshift) occurred within the ARGO-YBJ field of view. A search for\npossible emission associated to these GRBs has been made in the two energy\nranges 10-100 GeV and 10-1000 GeV. No significant excess has been found in time\ncoincidence with the satellite detections nor in a time window of one hour\nafter the bursts. Taking into account the EBL absorption, upper limits to the\nenergy fluence at 99% of confidence level have been evaluated,with values\nranging from ~ 10-5 erg cm-2 to ~10-1 erg cm-2.\n", "  Entanglement appears to be a fundamental building block of quantum gravity\nleading to new principles underlying the nature of quantum space-time. One such\nprinciple is the ER-EPR duality. While supported by our present intuition, a\nproof is far from obvious. In this article I present a first step towards such\na proof, originating in what is known to algebraic topologists as the\nMayer-Vietoris theorem. The main result of this work is the re-interpretation\nof the various morphisms arising when the Mayer-Vietoris theorem is used to\nassemble a torus-like topology from more basic subspaces on the torus in terms\nof quantum information theory resulting in a quantum entangler gate (Hadamard\nand c-NOT).\n", "  It is commonly believed that in quantum Monte Carlo approaches to fermionic\nmany- body problems, the infamous sign problem generically implies\nprohibitively large computational times for obtaining thermodynamic-limit\nquantities. We point out that for convergent Feynman diagrammatic series\nevaluated with the Monte Carlo algorithm of [Rossi, arXiv:1612.05184], the\ncomputational time increases only polynomially with the inverse error on\nthermodynamic-limit quantities.\n", "  In order to measure the total cross section for thermal neutrons, a\nphotoneutron source (PNS, phase 1) has been developed for the acquisition of\nnuclear data for the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) at the Shanghai\nInstitute of Applied Physics (SINAP). PNS is an electron LINAC pulsed neutron\nfacility that uses the time-of-flight (TOF) technique. It records the neutron\nTOF and identifies neutrons and $\\gamma$-rays by using a digital signal\nprocessing technique. The background is obtained by using a combination of\nemploying 12.8 cm boron-loaded polyethylene(PEB) (5$\\%$ w.t.) to block the\nflight path and Monte Carlo methods. The neutron total cross sections of\nnatural beryllium are measured in the neutron energy region from 0.007 to 0.1\neV. The present measurement result is compared with the fold Harvey data with\nthe response function of PNS.\n", "  The layered misfit cobaltate Ca$_3$Co$_4$O$_9$, also known as\nCa$_2$CoO$_3$[CoO$_2$]$_{1.62}$, is a promising p-type thermoelectric oxide.\nEmploying density functional theory, we study its electronic structure and\ndetermine, on the basis of Boltzmann theory within the constant-relaxation-time\napproximation, the thermoelectric transport coefficients. The dependence on\nstrain and temperature is determined. In particular, we find that the\n$xx$-component of the thermopower is strongly enhanced, while the\n$yy$-component is strongly reduced, when applying 2% tensile strain. A similar\nanisotropy is also found in the power factor. The temperature dependence of the\nconductivity in the $a$-$b$ plane is found to be rather weak above 200 K, which\nclearly indicates that the experimentally observed transport properties are\ndominated by inhomogeneities arising during sample growth, i.e., are not\nintrinsic.\n", "  We report the fabrication and photoresponse of 5 nm thick\nLa$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4}$ nanostrip with a width of 100nm. The I-V\ncharacteristics of the nanostrip show a hysteresis and a sharp voltage jump at\n$I_{c}$. The $J_{c}$(3K) of the nanostrip is 2.3 x 10$^{7}$ A/cm$^{2}$. The\nnanostrip exhibits photoresponse signals when illuminated by a pulse laser at\n1560 nm wavelength with a bias current just below $I_{c}$. The height of the\nsignal reduces as the optical intensity decreases and disappears below -10 dBm.\nThe signal also decreases as the temperature increases, but it exists up to 30\nK. These results suggest the possibility of La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4}$\nnanostrip as single-photon detector (SSPD, SNSPD) working at high temperature\nby further reducing the cross-section of the strip.\n", "  While electron kinetic effects are well known to be of fundamental importance\nin several situations, the electron mean-flow inertia is often neglected when\nlengthscales below the electron skin depth become irrelevant. This has led to\nthe formulation of different reduced models, where electron inertia terms are\ndiscarded while retaining some or all kinetic effects. Upon considering general\nfull-orbit particle trajectories, this paper compares the dispersion relations\nemerging from such models in the case of the Weibel instability. As a result,\nthe question of how lengthscales below the electron skin depth can be neglected\nin a kinetic treatment emerges as an unsolved problem, since all current\ntheories suffer from drawbacks of different nature. Alternatively, we discuss\nfully kinetic theories that remove all these drawbacks by restricting to\nfrequencies well below the plasma frequency of both ions and electrons. By\ngiving up on the lengthscale restrictions appearing in previous works, these\nmodels are obtained by assuming quasi-neutrality in the full Maxwell-Vlasov\nsystem.\n", "  We use hydrodynamical simulations to construct a new coherent picture for the\ngas flow in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), the region of our Galaxy within\n$R\\leq 500\\, \\mathrm{pc}$. We relate connected structures observed in $(l,b,v)$\ndata cubes of molecular tracers to nuclear spiral arms. These arise naturally\nin hydrodynamical simulations of barred galaxies, and are similar to those that\ncan be seen in external galaxies such as NGC4303 or NGC1097. We discuss a\nface-on view of the CMZ including the position of several prominent molecular\nclouds, such as Sgr B2, the $20\\,{\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$ and $50\\,{\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$\nclouds, the polar arc, Bania Clump 2 and Sgr C. Our model is also consistent\nwith the larger scale gas flow, up to $R\\simeq 3\\,\\rm kpc$, thus providing a\nconsistent picture of the entire Galactic bar region.\n", "  In five-dimensional minimal supergravity, there are spherical black holes\nwith nontrivial topology outside the horizon which have the same conserved\ncharges at infinity as the BMPV solution. We show that some of these black\nholes have greater entropy than the BMPV solution. These spacetimes are all\nasymptotically flat, stationary, and supersymmetric. We also show that there is\na limit in which the black hole shrinks to zero size and the solution becomes a\nnonsingular \"bubbling\" geometry. Thus, these solutions provide explicit\nanalytic examples of placing black holes inside solitons.\n", "  Current simulations of hot accretion flows around black holes assume either a\nsingle-temperature gas or, at best, a two-temperature gas with thermal ions and\nelectrons. However, processes like magnetic reconnection and shocks can\naccelerate electrons into a nonthermal distribution, which will not quickly\nthermalise at the very low densities found in many systems. Such nonthermal\nelectrons have been invoked to explain the infrared and X-ray spectra and\nstrong variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the black hole at the Galactic\nCenter. We present a method for self-consistent evolution of a nonthermal\nelectron population in the GRMHD code KORAL. The electron distribution is\ntracked across Lorentz factor space and is evolved in space and time, in\nparallel with thermal electrons, thermal ions, and radiation. In the present\nstudy, for simplicity, energy injection into the nonthermal distribution is\ntaken as a fixed fraction of the local electron viscous heating rate. Numerical\nresults are presented for a model with a low mass accretion rate similar to\nthat of Sgr A*. We find that the presence of a nonthermal population of\nelectrons has negligible effect on the overall dynamics of the system. Due to\nour simple uniform particle injection prescription, the radiative power in the\nnonthermal simulation is enhanced at large radii. The energy distribution of\nthe nonthermal electrons shows a synchrotron cooling break, with the break\nLorentz factor varying with location and time, reflecting the complex interplay\nbetween the local viscous heating rate, magnetic field strength, and fluid\nvelocity.\n", "  In this note we confront the research conducted in \\cite{Hoang:2017suc} with\nresults previously obtained by the author, and critically examine some of their\nclaimed findings.\n", "  The reduced magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transition probabilities\nfor the radiative decay of the $^{229}$Th 7.8 eV isomer to the ground state are\npredicted within a detailed nuclear-structure model approach. We show that the\npresence and decay of this isomer can only be accounted for by the Coriolis\nmixing emerging from a remarkably fine interplay between the coherent\nquadrupole-octupole motion of the nuclear core and the single-nucleon motion\nwithin a reflection-asymmetric deformed potential. We find that the magnetic\ndipole transition probability which determines the radiative lifetime of the\nisomer is considerably smaller than presently estimated. The so-far disregarded\nelectric quadrupole component may have non-negligible contributions to the\ninternal conversion channel. These findings support new directions in the\nexperimental search of the $^{229}$Th transition frequency for the development\nof a future nuclear frequency standard.\n", "  The search for patterns in time series is a very common task when dealing\nwith complex systems. This is usually accomplished by employing a complexity\nmeasure such as entropies and fractal dimensions. However, such measures\nusually only capture a single aspect of the system dynamics. Here, we propose a\nfamily of complexity measures for time series based on a generalization of the\ncomplexity-entropy causality plane. By replacing the Shannon entropy by a\nmono-parametric entropy (Tsallis $q$-entropy) and after considering the proper\ngeneralization of the statistical complexity ($q$-complexity), we build up a\nparametric curve (the $q$-complexity-entropy curve) that is used for\ncharacterizing/classifying time series. Based on simple exact results and\nnumerical simulations of stochastic processes, we show that these curves can\ndistinguish among different long-range, short-range and oscillating correlated\nbehaviors. Also, we verify that simulated chaotic and stochastic time series\ncan be distinguished based on whether these curves are open or closed. We\nfurther test this technique in experimental scenarios related to chaotic laser\nintensity, stock price, sunspot, and geomagnetic dynamics, confirming its\nusefulness. Finally, we prove that these curves enhance the automatic\nclassification of time series with long-range correlations and interbeat\nintervals of healthy subjects and patients with heart disease.\n", "  Let X be a smooth projective curve over a field of characteristic zero. We\ncalculate the motivic class of the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles on\nX. We also calculate the motivic class of the moduli stack of vector bundles\nwith connections by showing that it is equal to the class of the stack of\nsemistable Higgs bundles of the same rank and degree zero.\n  We follow the strategy of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann for counting Higgs bundles\nover finite fields. The main new ingredient is a motivic version of a theorem\nof Harder about Eisenstein series claiming that all vector bundles have\napproximately the same motivic class of Borel reductions as the degree of Borel\nreduction tends to $-\\infty$.\n", "  We report on a metal-insulator transition (MIT) that is observed in an\nelectron system at the SmTiO3/SrTiO3 interface. This MIT is characterized by an\nabrupt transition at a critical temperature, below which the resistance changes\nby more than an order of magnitude. The temperature of the transition\nsystematically depends on the carrier density, which is tuned from ~ 1x10^14\ncm^-2 to 3x10^14 cm^-2 by changing the SmTiO3 thickness. Analysis of the\ntransport properties shows non-Fermi liquid behavior and mass enhancement as\nthe carrier density is lowered. We compare the MIT characteristics with those\nof known MITs in other materials systems and show that they are distinctly\ndifferent in several aspects. We tentatively conclude that both long range\nCoulomb interactions and the fixed charge at the polar interface are likely to\nplay a role in this MIT. The strong dependence on the carrier density makes\nthis MIT of interest for field-tunable devices.\n", "  We report the electronic transport properties of a new photo-addressable\nmolecular switch. The switching process relies on a new concept based on linear\n{\\pi}-conjugated dynamic systems, in which the geometry and hence the\nelectronic properties of an oligothiophene chain can be reversibly modified by\nthe photochemical trans-cis isomerization of an azobenzene unit fixed in a\nlateral loop. Electron transport measurements through self-assembled monolayers\non gold, contacted with eGaIn top contact, show switching with a conductance\nratio up to 1E3. Ab initio calculations have been used to identify the most\nenergetically stable conformations of the molecular switch, the corresponding\ncalculated conductances qualitatively explain the trend observed in the\nphoto-switching experiments.\n", "  The majority of stars are now thought to support exoplanets. Many of those\nexoplanets discovered thus far are categorized as rocky objects with an\natmosphere. Most of these objects are however hot due to their short orbital\nperiod. Models suggest that water is the dominant species in their atmospheres.\nThe hot temperatures are expected to turn these atmospheres into a (high\npressure) steam bath containing remains of melted rock. The spectroscopy of\nthese hot rocky objects will be very different from that of cooler objects or\nhot gas giants. Molecules suggested to be important for the spectroscopy of\nthese objects are reviewed together with the current status of the\ncorresponding spectroscopic data. Perspectives of building a comprehensive\ndatabase of linelist/cross sections applicable for atmospheric models of rocky\nsuper-Earths as part of the ExoMol project are discussed. The\nquantum-mechanical approaches used in linelist productions and their challenges\nare summarized.\n", "  Refraction represents one of the most fundamental operations that may be\nperformed by a metasurface. However, simple phasegradient metasurface designs\nsuffer from restricted angular deflection due to spurious diffraction orders.\nIt has been recently shown, using a circuit-based approach, that refraction\nwithout spurious diffraction, or diffraction-free, can fortunately be achieved\nby a transverse metasurface exhibiting either loss-gain or bianisotropy. Here,\nwe rederive these conditions using a medium-based - and hence more insightfull\n- approach based on Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) and surface\nsusceptibility tensors, and experimentally demonstrate two diffraction-free\nrefractive metasurfaces that are essentially lossless, passive, bianisotropic\nand reciprocal.\n", "  The starting point in this note is $f(R)$ modified gravity in a cosmological\nsetting. We assume a spatially flat Universe to describe late-time cosmology\nand the perfect-fluid equation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ to model the\nhypothesized dark energy. Given that on a cosmological scale, $f(R)$ modified\ngravity must remain close to Einstein gravity to be consistent with\nobservation, it was concluded that either (1) Einstein's cosmological constant\nis the only acceptable model for the accelerated expansion or (2) that the\nequation of state for dark energy is far more complicated than the\nperfect-fluid model and may even exclude a constant $\\omega$.\n", "  We construct three-qubit entanglement witnesses with relatively simple\nstructures. Despite their simplicity, these witnesses are capable of detecting\na number of bound entangled states more effectively. To illustrate this, two\nfamilies of bound entangled three-qubit states, introduced by Kay [Phys. Rev. A\n83, 020303 (2011)] and Kye [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48, 235303 (2015)], are\nconsidered and it is shown that these witnesses are able to detect the\nentanglement of all states in the families.\n", "  The study of LFV decays of the Higgs boson, $h\\to \\ell_i \\ell_j$, has become\nan active research subject both from the experimental and theoretical points of\nview. Such decays vanish within the SM and are highly suppressed in several\ntheoretical extensions. Due to its relevance and relative simplicity to\nreconstruct the signal at future colliders, it is an important tool to probe SM\nextensions where it could reach detectable levels. Here we identify a mechanism\nthat induces LFV Higgs interactions, by linking it with the appearance of CP\nviolation in the scalar sector, within the context of general multi-Higgs\nmodels. We then focus on the simplest model of this type to study its\nphenomenology. The scalar sector of this minimal model consisting of a Higgs\ndoublet and a Froggatt--Nielsen (FN) (complex) singlet is studied thoroughly,\nincluding the scalar spectrum and the Yukawa interactions. Constraints on the\nparameters of the model are derived from low-energy observables and LHC Higgs\ndata, which is then applied to study the resulting predicted rates for the\ndecay $h\\rightarrow \\tau \\mu$. Overall, branching ratios for $h \\rightarrow\n\\tau \\mu$ of the order $10^{-3}$ are obtained within this approach consistent\nwith all known constraints.\n", "  Usually the study of energy-transfer in the light harvesting complex is\nlimited by a single-exciton motion along the antenna. Starting from the\nmany-body Schr\\\"odinger equation, we derived Lindblad-type Master equations\ndescribing the cyclic exciton-electron dynamics of the light harvesting\ncomplex, originated from charge reduction of a donor. These equations,\nresembling the Master equations for the electric current in mesoscopic systems,\ngo beyond the single-exciton description by accounting for the multi-exciton\nstates accumulated in the antenna, as well as the charge-separation,\nfluorescence and initial photo-absorption. Although these effects take place on\nvery different time-scales, we demonstrate that their inclusion is necessary\nfor a consistent description of the exciton dynamics. We applied our results to\nevaluate the energy (exciton) current and for the fluorescent current depending\non the light-intensity.\n", "  Recent results have shown the stability of frustration-free Hamiltonians to\nweak local perturbations, assuming several conditions. In this paper, we prove\nthe stability of free fermion Hamiltonians which are gapped and local. These\nfree fermion Hamiltonians are not necessarily frustration-free, but we are able\nto adapt previous work to prove stability. The key idea is to add an additional\ncopy of the system to cancel topological obstructions. We comment on\napplications to quantization of Hall conductance in such systems.\n", "  The World Space Observatory - Ultraviolet (WSO-UV) space telescope is\nequipped with high dispersion (55,000) spectrographs working in the 1150-3100\n{\\AA} spectral range. To evaluate the impact of the design on the scientific\nobjectives of the mission, a simulation software tool has been developed. This\nsimulator builds on the development made for the PLATO space mission, and it is\ndesigned to generate synthetic time-series of images by including models of all\nimportant noise sources. In this article, we describe its design and\nperformance. Moreover, its application to the detectability of important\nspectral features for star formation and exoplanetary research is addressed.\n", "  We describe a new mechanism of decoherence in excited atoms as a result of\nthermal particles scattering by the atomic nucleus. It is based on the idea\nthat a single scattering will produce a sudden displacement of the nucleus,\nwhich will be perceived by the electron in the atom as an instant shift in the\nelectrostatic potential. This will leave the atom's wave-function partially\nprojected into lower-energy states which will lead to decoherence of the atomic\nstate. The decoherence is calculated to increase with the excitation of the\natom, making observation of the effect easier in Rydberg atoms. We estimate the\norder of the decoherence for photons and massive particles scattering,\nanalyzing several commonly presented scenarios. Our scheme can be applied to\nthe detection of weakly-interacting particles, like those which may be the\nconstituents of Dark Matter, which interaction was calculated to have a more\nprominent effect that the background radiation.\n", "  Currently two factors hinder the use of collagen as building block of\nregenerative devices: the potential antigenicity, and limited mechanical\nstrength in aqueous environment. Polymeric collagen is naturally found in the\ncross-linked state and is mechanically tougher than the monomeric,\ncross-link-free (acid-soluble) collagen ex vivo. The antigenicity of collagen,\non the other hand, is mainly ascribed to inter-species variations in amino acid\nsequences, which are primarily located in the non-helical terminal\ntelopeptides. Although these can be removed through enzymatic treatment to\nproduce atelocollagen, the effect of telopeptide removal on triple helix\norganization, amino acidic composition and thermal properties is often\ndisregarded. Here, we compare the structural, chemical and physical properties\nof polymeric and monomeric type I collagen with and without telopeptides, in an\neffort to elucidate the influence that either covalent crosslinks or\ntelopeptides possess. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to examine the triple\nhelical conformation and quantify the denaturation temperature (Td) of both\nmonomeric collagen (36.5 {\\deg}C) and monomeric atelocollagen (35.5 {\\deg}C).\nCD measurements were combined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in\norder to gain insight into the triple helix-to-coil thermal transition and\nshrinkage temperature (Ts) of polymeric atelo collagen (44.8 {\\deg}C),\npolymeric collagen (62.7 {\\deg}C), monomeric atelo collagen (51.4 {\\deg}C) and\nmonomeric collagen (66.5 {\\deg}C). Structural and thermal analyses were\ncombined with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the\ncontent of specific collagen amino acidic residues used as markers for the\npresence of telopeptides and mature crosslinks.\n", "  The hadronic jets in a micro-quasar stellar system are modelled with the\nrelativistic hydrocode PLUTO. We focus on neutrino emission from such jets\nproduced by fast proton (non-thermal) collisions on thermal ones within the\nhadronic jet. We adopt a semi-analytical approximation for the description of\nthe secondary particles produced from p-p collisions and develop appropriate\nalgorithms using the aforementioned injected protons as input. As a concrete\nexample we consider the SS-433 X-ray binary system for which several\nobservations have been performed the last decades. In contrast to the pre-set\ndistribution of the fast protons along the jet employed in our previous works,\nin the present paper we simulated it by using a power-law fast proton\ndistribution along the PLUTO hydro-code. This distribution gradually sweeps\naside the surrounding winds, during the jet advance through the computational\ngrid. As a first step, in the present work the neutrino energy spectrum is\nextracted from the model jet, facilitating a range of potential dynamical\nsimulations in currently interesting microquasar jet systems.\n", "  The strain incompatibility equations are discussed for nonlinear\nKirchhoff-Love shells with sources of inhomogeneity arising due to a\ndistribution of topological defects, such as dislocations and disclinations,\nand metric anomalies, such as point defects, thermal strains, and biological\ngrowth. The incompatibility equations are given for all topological surfaces,\nwith or without boundary, which are isometrically embeddable in a 3-dimensional\nEuclidean space.\n", "  The Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs provides the\nmost influential framework for studying collective dynamics and\nsynchronization. It exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical regimes. Since the\nwork of Strogatz and Mirollo, the mean field equation derived in the limit as\nthe number of oscillators in the KM goes to infinity, has been the key to\nunderstanding a number of interesting effects, including the onset of\nsynchronization and chimera states. In this work, we study the mathematical\nbasis of the mean field equation as an approximation of the discrete KM.\nSpecifically, we extend the Neunzert's method of rigorous justification of the\nmean field equation to cover interacting dynamical systems on graphs. We then\napply it to the KM on convergent graph sequences with non-Lipschitz limit. This\nfamily of graphs includes many graphs that are of interest in applications,\ne.g., nearest-neighbor and small-world graphs.\n", "  We review some concepts and properties of quantum correlations, in particular\nmultipartite measures, geometric measures and monogamy relations. We also\ndiscuss the relation between classical and total correlations\n", "  In this thesis, we construct an approximate series solution of the Wigner\nequation in terms of Airy functions, which are semiclassically concentrated on\ncertain Lagrangian curves in two-dimensional phase space. These curves are\ndefined by the eigenvalues and the Hamiltonian function of the associated\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operator, and they play a crucial role in the\nquantum interference mechanism in phase space. We assume that the potential of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger operator is a single potential well, such that the spectrum\nis discrete.\n  The construction starts from an eigenfunction series expansion of the\nsolution, which is derived here for first time in a systematic way, by\ncombining the elementary technique of separation of variables with involved\nspectral results for the Moyal star exponential operator. The eigenfunctions of\nthe Wigner equation are the Wigner transforms of the Schr\\\"odinger\neigenfunctions, and they are approximated in terms of Airy functions by a\nuniform stationary phase approximation of the Wigner transforms of the WKB\nexpansions of the Schr\\\"odinger eigenfunctions.\n  The approximation of the eigenfunction series is an approximated solution of\nthe Wigner equation, which by projection onto the configuration space provides\nan approximate wave amplitude, free of turning point singularities. It is\ngenerally expected that, the derived wave amplitude is bounded, and correctly\nscaled, even on caustics, since only finite terms of the approximate terms are\nsignificant for WKB initial wave functions with finite energy.\n  The details of the calculations are presented for the simple potential of the\nharmonic oscillator, in order to be able to check our approximations\nanalytically. But, the same construction can be applied to any potential well,\nwhich behaves like the harmonic oscillator near the bottom of the well.\n", "  It is shown that gravitational radiation can bind two initially unbound\nbodies; no third body is needed. Such captured bodies will almost always\ninspiral and merge due to further gravitational radiation on cosmologically\nnegligible time scales (e.g., @ 5 years for GW150914). The capture\ncross-section $\\sigma$ for such \"capture and inspiraling\" is far larger, for\ninitial relative speed of the two objects $v_\\infty\\ll c$, than that\n$\\sigma_{d}$ for \"direct capture\": $\\sigma\\propto\\left(c /\nv_\\infty\\right)^{18/7}$, while $\\sigma_{d}\\propto\\left(c / v_\\infty\\right)^2$.\nImplications of these results for black hole binary mergers, and giant black\nholes at galactic centers, are discussed.\n", "  We consider the Gaussian unitary ensemble perturbed by a Fisher-Hartwig\nsingularity simultaneously of both root type and jump type. In the critical\nregime where the singularity approaches the soft edge, namely, the edge of the\nsupport of the equilibrium measure for the Gaussian weight, the asymptotics of\nthe Hankel determinant and the recurrence coefficients, for the orthogonal\npolynomials associated with the perturbed Gaussian weight, are obtained and\nexpressed in terms of a family of smooth solutions to the Painlev\\'{e} XXXIV\nequation and the $\\sigma$-form of the Painlev\\'{e} II equation. In addition, we\nfurther obtain the double scaling limit of the distribution of the largest\neigenvalue in a thinning procedure of the conditioning Gaussian unitary\nensemble, and the double scaling limit of the correlation kernel for the\ncritical perturbed Gaussian unitary ensemble. The asymptotic properties of the\nPainlev\\'{e} XXXIV functions and the $\\sigma$-form of the Painlev\\'{e} II\nequation are also studied.\n", "  The condition for the existence of self-gravitational solitary waves (SGSWs),\nand their polarity in any astrophysical compact object are theoretically found\nfor the first time. The pseudo-potential approach, which is valid for arbitrary\namplitude SGSWs, is emplyed. The general analytical results are applied in\nwhite dwarfs and neutron stars to identify the basic features (polarity,\namplitude, and width) of the SGSWs formed in them. It found for the first time\nthat the SGSWs exist with negative self-gravitational potential in perturbed\nstates of white dwarfs and neutron stars. It is also estimated that for their\ntypical degenerate plasma parmeters, the amplitude and the width of the SGSWs\n(moving with the speed 2 cm/s) in white dwarfs are $\\sim -1.5$ ergs/gm and\n$\\sim 50$ cm, respectively, and those of the SGSWs (moving with the speed $\\sim\n27$ m/s) in neutron stars are $\\sim -7.76\\times 10^4$ Joules/kg, and $5.5$ km,\nrespectively.\n", "  The interdiffusion of six major elements (Si, Ti, Fe, Mg, Ca, K) between\nnatural shoshonite and a high-K calc-alkaline rhyolite (Vulcano island, Aeolian\narchipelago, Italy) has been experimentally measured by the diffusion couple\ntechnique at 1200{\\deg}C, pressures from 50 to 500 MPa and water contents from\n0.3 (nominally dry) to 2 wt%. The experiments were carried out in an internally\nheated pressure vessel, and major element profiles were later acquired by\nelectron probe microanalysis. The concentration-distance profiles are evaluated\nusing a concentration-dependent diffusivity approach. Effective binary\ndiffusion coefficients for four intermediate silica contents are obtained by\nthe Sauer-Freise modified Boltzmann-Matano method. At the experimental\ntemperature and pressures, the diffusivity of all studied elements notably\nincreases with dissolved H2O content. Particularly, diffusion is up to 1.4\norders of magnitude faster in a melt containing 2 wt.% H2O than in nominally\ndry melts. This effect is slightly enhanced in the more mafic compositions.\nUphill diffusion was observed for Al, while all other elements can be described\nby the concept of effective binary interdiffusion. Ti is the slowest diffusing\nelement through all experimental conditions and compositions, followed by Si.\nFe, Mg, Ca and K diffuse at similar rates but always more rapidly than Si and\nTi. This trend suggests a strong coupling between melt components. Since\neffects of composition (including water content) are dominant, a pressure\neffect on diffusion cannot be clearly resolved in the experimental pressure\nrange.\n", "  Shor's algorithm can find prime factors of a large number more efficiently\nthan any known classical algorithm. Understanding the properties that gives the\nspeedup is essential for a general and scalable construction. Here we present a\nrealization of Shor's algorithm, that does not need any of the simplifications\npresently needed in current experiments and also gives smaller systematic\nerrors than any former experimental implementation. Our realization is based on\nclassical pass-transistor logic, runs at room temperature, and uses the same\namount of resources as a scalable quantum computer. In this paper, the focus is\nnot on the result of the factorization, but to compare our realization with\ncurrent state-of-the-art experiment, factoring 15. Our result gives further\ninsight to the resources needed for quantum computation, aiming for a true\nunderstanding of the subject.\n", "  SITELLE is an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer installed at the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope since July 2015. It delivers spectral cubes\ncovering an 11'x11' field-of-view with a seeing-limited spatial resolution and\na tunable spectral resolution (R=1-10 000) in selected passbands of the visible\nband (350-900 nm). We present an accurate picture of the calibration accuracy\nof SITELLE's first data release. To this purpose, most of the operations of the\nreduction pipeline (ORBS) are described in details.\n", "  Holographic display can show pictures in the way that looks like the same\nwith the real world, and is thought as the ultimate display technology. But due\nto the complexity of the traditional holographic technique, it can hardly be\napplied to commercial display systems. In this paper, the field reconstruction\nof holograms (or real-time reconstruction of holograms) method, which is more\npractical and better than traditional holographic technique in image quality,\nis first proposed for realizing the display of true 3D image at free space. By\ncombining the advantages of geometrical optics and the wave optics, a true 3D\ndisplay is successfully designed. And by designing an interactive image\ngeneration chip, the designed 3D display allows user to interact with the 3D\nimage in the style that's natural to them.\n", "  Quantum secure direct communication is one of the important mode of quantum\ncommunication, which sends secret information through a quantum channel\ndirectly without setting up a prior key. Over the past decade, numerous\nprotocols have been proposed, and part of them have been experimentally\ndemonstrated. However, the strict security proof is still in suspense. Two-way\nprotocol is seen as one of the most practical protocol, in this paper, the\nsecurity of the two-way quantum secure direct communication protocol will be\nproved against general attacks when the noisy and lossy channel is taken into\naccount. There are two steps included in the proof, firstly, we need to prove\nthat the mutual information between Alice and Bob is larger than the mutual\ninformation shared between Alice and the eavesdropper when the error rate in\ncontrol mode is less than the predetermined threshold. Secondly, once the error\nrate is lower than the threshold, one can always find out a forward error\ncorrection code to guarantee the security of information transmission.\n", "  The response of the Timepix detector to neon ions with kinetic energy 77 and\n158.4 MeV has been studied at the cyclotron U-400M of the JINR Flerov\nLaboratory of Nuclear Reaction. Sensors produced from gallium arsenide\ncompensated by chromium and from silicon are used for these measurements. While\nin Timepix detector with Si sensor the well-known so-called \"volcano effect\"\nobserved, in Timepix detector with GaAs:Cr sensor such effect was completely\nabsent.\n  In the work the behavior of the Timepix detector with GaAs:Cr sensor under\nirradiation with heavy ions is described in comparison with the detector based\non Si sensor. Also the possible reason for absence of \"volcano\" effect in\nGaAs:Cr detector is proposed.\n", "  We analysed how the active galactic nucleus (AGN) X-ray primary continuum\ndepends on AGN activity in radio, using the data of RXTE Spectral & Timing\nDatabase (Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer) and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory). Our aim is to test the relation between spectral\nshapes of these AGNs and the prediction of the \"spin-paradigm\" model of the AGN\n\"central engine\". We have found that for the major part of radio-quiet (RQ)\nAGNs the value of high-energy exponential cut-off in primary spectrum appears\nto be significantly higher than 100 keV and thus follows the \"spin-paradigm\"\npredictions. In the same time, near 25% of radio-loud (RL) AGNs demonstrate the\nhigh-energy cut-off at the energies above 150 keV, contradicting the \"spin\nparadigm\". We have composed a sample of \"peculiar\" 69 RQ and 10 RL AGNs that\nseem to contradict to the \"spin paradigm\" for further individual studies of\nthese objects.\n", "  Starting from the continuum definition of helicity, we derive from first\nprinciples its different contributions for superfluid vortices. Our analysis\nshows that an internal twist contribution emerges naturally from the\nmathematical derivation. This reveals that the spanwise vector that is used to\ncharacterise the twist contribution must point in the direction of a surface of\nconstant velocity potential. An immediate consequence of the Seifert framing is\nthat the continuum definition of helicity for a superfluid is trivially zero at\nall times. It follows that the Gauss-linking number is a more appropriate\ndefinition of helicity for superfluids. Despite this, we explain how a\nquasiclassical limit can arise in a superfluid in which the continuum\ndefinition for helicity can be used. This provides a clear connection between a\nmicroscopic and a macroscopic description of a superfluid as provided by the\nHall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov equations. This leads to consistency with the\ndefinition of helicity used for classical vortices.\n", "  In 2016, the Center for Planetary Science proposed a hypothesis arguing a\ncomet and/or its hydrogen cloud were a strong candidate for the source of the\nWow! Signal. From 27 November 2016 to 24 February 2017, the Center for\nPlanetary Science conducted 200 observations in the radio spectrum to validate\nthe hypothesis. The investigation discovered that comet 266/P Christensen\nemitted a radio signal at 1420.25 MHz. The results of this investigation,\ntherefore, conclude that cometary spectra are detectable at 1420 MHz and, more\nimportantly, that the 1977 Wow! Signal was a natural phenomenon from a Solar\nSystem body.\n", "  This review describes our current understanding of interstellar extinction.\nThis differ substantially from the ideas of the 20th century. With infrared\nsurveys of hundreds of millions of stars over the entire sky, such as 2MASS,\nSPITZER-IRAC, and WISE, we have looked at the densest and most rarefied regions\nof the interstellar medium at distances of a few kpc from the sun. Observations\nat infrared and microwave wavelengths, where the bulk of the interstellar dust\nabsorbs and radiates, have brought us closer to an understanding of the\ndistribution of the dust particles on scales of the Galaxy and the Universe. We\nare in the midst of a scientific revolution in our understanding of the\ninterstellar medium and dust. Progress in, and the key results of, this\nrevolution are still difficult to predict. Nevertheless, (a) a physically\njustified model has been developed for the spatial distribution of absorbing\nmaterial over the nearest few kiloparsecs, including the Gould belt as a dust\ncontainer, which gives an accurate estimate of the extinction for any object\njust in terms of its galactic coordinates. It is also clear that (b) the\ninterstellar medium makes up roughly half the mass of matter in the galactic\nvicinity of the solar system (the other half is made up of stars, their\nremnants, and dark matter) and (c) the interstellar medium and, especially,\ndust, differ substantially in different regions of space, and deep space cannot\nbe understood by only studying nearby space.\n", "  In this report, it is shown that Cr doped into the bulk and Cr deposited on\nthe surface of Bi2Se3 films produced by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have\nstrikingly different effects on both the electronic structure and chemical\nenvironment.\n", "  The current-voltage characteristics of a new range of devices built around\nWeyl semimetals has been predicted using the Landauer formalism. The potential\nstep and barrier have been reconsidered for a three-dimensional Weyl\nsemimetals, with analogies to the two-dimensional material graphene and to\noptics. With the use of our results we also show how a Veselago lens can be\nmade from Weyl semimetals, e.g. from NbAs and NbP. Such a lens may have many\npractical applications and can be used as a probing tip in a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM). The ballistic character of Weyl fermion transport inside the\nsemimetal tip, combined with the ideal focusing of the Weyl fermions (by\nVeselago lens) on the surface of the tip may create a very narrow electron beam\nfrom the tip to the surface of the studied material. With a Weyl semimetal\nprobing tip the resolution of the present STMs can be improved significantly,\nand one may image not only individual atoms but also individual electron\norbitals or chemical bonding and therewith to resolve the long-term issue of\nchemical and hydrogen bond formation. We show that applying a pressure to the\nWeyl semimental, having no centre of spacial inversion one may model matter at\nextreme conditions such as those arising in the vicinity of a black hole. As\nthe materials Cd3As2 and Na3Bi show an asymmetry in their Dirac cones, a\nscaling factor was used to model this asymmetry. The scaling factor created\nadditional regions of no propagation and condensed the appearance of\nresonances. We argue that under an external pressure there may arise a\ntopological phase transition in Weyl semimetals, where the electron transport\nchanges character and becomes anisotropic. There a hyperbolic Dirac phases\noccurs where there is a strong light absorption and photo-current generation.\n", "  Using continuum elasticity theory, we describe the elastic behavior of\nhelical coils with an asymmetric double-helix structure and identify\nconditions, under which they become very rigid. Theoretical insight gained for\nmacro-structures including a stretched telephone cord and an unsupported\nhelical staircase is universal and of interest for the elastic behavior of\nhelical structures on the micro- and nanometer scale.\n", "  We present BVRI photometry of supernova (SN) 2016coj in NGC 4125 from $9$\ndays before to $57$ days after its $B$-band maximum light. Our light curves and\ncolor curves suggest that this event belongs to the \"normal\" class of type Ia\nSNe, with a decline rate parameter $\\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.32 \\pm 0.10$, and that\nit suffers little extinction. Adopting a distance modulus to its host galaxy of\n$(m - M) = 31.89$ mag, we compute extinction-corrected peak absolute magnitudes\nof $M_B = -19.01$, $M_V = -19.05$, $M_R = -19.03$, and $M_I = -18.79$. The\nexplosion occurred close enough to the nucleus of NGC 4125 to hinder the\nmeasurement of its brightness. We describe our methods to reduce the effect of\nsuch host-galaxy contamination, but it is clear that our latest values suffer\nfrom systematic bias.\n", "  Carbon, the basic building block of our universe, enjoys a vast number of\nallotropic structures. Owing to its bonding characteristic, most carbon\nallotropes possess the motif of hexagonal rings. Here, with first-principles\ncalculations, we discover a new metastable three-dimensional carbon allotrope\nentirely composed of pentagon rings. The unique structure of this \"Pentagon\nCarbon\" leads to extraordinary electronic properties, making it a cornucopia of\nemergent topological fermions. Under lattice strain, Pentagon Carbon exhibits\ntopological phase transitions, generating a series of novel quasiparticles,\nfrom isospin-1 triplet fermions, to triply-degenerate fermions, and further to\nconcatenated Weyl-loop fermions. Its Landau level spectrum also exhibits\ndistinct features, including a huge number of almost degenerate chiral Landau\nbands, implying pronounced magneto-transport signals. Our work not only\ndiscovers a remarkable carbon allotrope with highly rare structural motifs, it\nalso reveals a fascinating hierarchical particle genesis with novel topological\nfermions beyond the Dirac and Weyl paradigm.\n", "  We present hemispherically resolved spectra of the surface of Europa from\n~3.1--4.13 microns, which we obtained using the near infrared spectrometer\nNIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. These include the first high-quality L-band\nspectra of the surface to extend beyond 4 microns. In our data we identify a\npreviously unseen spectral feature at 3.78 microns on the trailing hemisphere.\nThe longitudinal distribution of the feature is consistent with that of a\nradiolytic product created by electron or Iogenic ion bombardment. This feature\nis coincident with an absorption feature of SO2 frost seen in both laboratory\nspectra and spectra of Io. However, the corresponding, typically stronger 4.07\nmicron feature of SO2 frost is absent from our data. This result is contrary to\nthe suggested detection of SO2 at 4.05 microns in Galileo NIMS data of the\ntrailing hemisphere, which was severely affected by radiation noise. We use\nsimple spectral modeling to argue that the 3.78 micron feature is not easily\nexplained by the presence of SO2 frost on the surface. We explore alternative\nexplanations and discuss other potential candidate species.\n", "  We comparatively studied the critical current density, magnetization and\nspecific heat of the rolled and the hot-pressed Sr1-xKxFe2As2 tapes. The\nSchottky anomaly that is obvious in the specific heat of the rolled tape\ndisappears in the hot-pressed tape. Moreover, the hot-pressed tape has a higher\nfraction of superconductivity and a narrower distribution of superconducting\ntransition temperature than the rolled tape. Combined with the magnetization\ndata, we conclude that sintering under high pressure provides a better\nenvironment for complete chemical reaction and more homogenous dopant\ndistribution, which is beneficial to the global current of a superconductor.\n", "  Metal nanoparticles are excellent light absorbers. The absorption processes\ncreate highly excited electron-hole pairs and recently there has been interest\nin harnessing these hot charge carriers for photocatalysis and solar energy\nconversion applications. The goal of this Perspectives article is to describe\nthe dynamics and energy distribution of the charge carriers produced by photon\nabsorption, and the implications for the photocatalysis mechanism. We will also\ndiscuss how spectroscopy can be used to provide insight into the coupling\nbetween plasmons and molecular resonances. In particular, the analysis shows\nthat the choice of material and shape of the nanocrystal can play a crucial\nrole in hot electron generation and coupling between plasmons and molecular\ntransitions. The detection and even calculation of many-body hot-electron\nprocesses in the plasmonic systems with continuous spectra of electrons and\nshort lifetimes are challenging, but at the same time very interesting from the\npoint of view of both potential applications and fundamental physics. We\npropose that developing an understanding of these processes will provide a\npathway for improving the efficiency of plasmon-induced photocatalysis.\n", "  Theoretical investigation of structural, elastic, electronic and bonding\nproperties of A-15 Nb-based intermetallic compounds Nb3B (B = Pt, Os) have been\nperformed using first principles calculations based on the density functional\ntheory (DFT). Optimized cell parameters are found to be in good agreement with\navailable experimental and theoretical results. The elastic constants at zero\npressure and temperature are calculated and the anisotropic behaviors of the\ncompounds are studied. Both the compounds are mechanically stable and ductile\nin nature. Other elastic properties such as Pugh's ratio, Cauchy pressure,\nmachinability index are derived for the first time. Nb3Os is expected to have\ngood lubricating properties compared to Nb3Pt. The electronic band structure\nand energy density of states (DOS) have been studied with and without\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC). The band structures of both the compounds are spin\nsymmetric. Electronic band structure and DOS reveal that both the compounds are\nmetallic and the conductivity mainly arise from the Nb 4d states. The Fermi\nsurface features have been studied for the first time. The Fermi surfaces of\nNb3B contain both hole- and electron-like sheets which change as one replaces\nPt with Os. The electronic charge density distribution shows that Nb3Pt and\nNb3Os both have a mixture of ionic and covalent bonding. The charge transfer\nbetween atomic species in these compounds has been explained by the Mulliken\nbond population analysis.\n", "  Micromagnetic simulations are used to investigate the effects of different\nabsorbing boundary layers (ABLs) on spin waves (SWs) reflected from the edges\nof a magnetic nano-structure. We define the conditions that a suitable ABL must\nfulfill and compare the performance of abrupt, linear, polynomial and tan\nhyperbolic damping profiles in the ABL. We first consider normal incidence in a\npermalloy stripe and propose a transmission line model to quantify reflections\nand calculate the loss introduced into the stripe due to the ABL. We find that\na parabolic damping profile absorbs the SW energy efficiently and has a low\nreflection coefficient, thus performing much better than the commonly used\nabrupt damping profile. We then investigated SWs that are obliquely incident at\n26.6, 45 and 63.4 degrees on the edge of a yttrium-iron-garnet film. The\nparabolic damping profile again performs efficiently by showing a high SW\nenergy transfer to the ABL and a low reflected SW amplitude.\n", "  Following the method of Seifert surfaces in knot theory, we define arithmetic\nlinking numbers and height pairings of ideals using arithmetic duality\ntheorems, and compute them in terms of n-th power residue symbols. This\nformalism leads to a precise arithmetic analogue of a 'path-integral formula'\nfor linking numbers.\n", "  An improved version of the 3D stellar reddening map in a space with a radius\nof 1200 pc around the Sun and within 600 pc of the Galactic midplane is\npresented. As in the previous 2010 and 2012 versions of the map, photometry\nwith an accuracy better than $0.05^m$ in the $J$ and $K_s$ bands for more than\n70 million stars from the 2MASS catalogue is used in the new version. However,\nthe data reduction technique is considerably more complicated. As before, an\nanalysis of the distribution of stars near the main-sequence turnoff on the\n$(J-K_s)$ - $K_s$ diagram, where they form a distribution maximum, provides a\nbasis for the method. The shift of this maximum, i.e., the $mode(J-K_s)$, along\n$(J-K_s)$ and $K_s$, given the spatial variations of the mean de-reddened color\n$(J-K_s)_0$ of these stars, is interpreted as a growth of the reddening with\nincreasing distance. The main distinction of the new method is that instead of\nthe fixed mean absolute magnitude, de-reddened color, distance, and reddening\nfor each cell, the individual values of these quantities are calculated for\neach star by iterations when solving the system of equations relating them.\nThis has allowed one to increase the random accuracy of the map to $0.01^m$ and\nits spatial resolution to 20 pc in coordinates and distance and to $1^{\\circ}$\nin longitude and latitude. Comparison with other reddening estimates for the\nsame spatial cells and Gaia DR1 TGAS stars shows that the constructed map is\none of the best maps for the space under consideration. Its systematic errors\nhave been estimated to be $\\sigma(E(J-K_s))=0.025^m$, or\n$\\sigma(E(B-V))=0.04^m$. The main purpose of the map is to analyze the\ncharacteristics of Galactic structures, clouds, and cloud complexes. For this\npurpose, the reddening map within each spatial cell has also been computed by\nanalyzing the reddening along each line of sight.\n", "  We consider a second degree algebraic curve describing a general conic\nconstraint imposed on the motion of a massive spinless particle. The problem is\ntrivial at classical level but becomes involved and interesting in its quantum\ncounterpart with subtleties in its symplectic structure and symmetries. The\nmodel is used here to investigate quantization issues related to the\nHamiltonian constraint structure, Dirac brackets, gauge symmetry and BRST\ntransformations. We pursue the complete constraint analysis in phase space and\nperform the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic quantization following the\nBarcelos-Wotzasek iteration program to unravel the fine tuned and more relevant\naspects of the constraint structure. A comparison with the longer usual\nDirac-Bergmann algorithm, still more well established in the literature, is\nalso presented. While in the standard DB approach there are four second class\nconstraints, in the FJBW they reduce to two. By using the symplectic potential\nobtained in the last step of the FJBW iteration process we construct a gauge\ninvariant model exhibiting explicitly its BRST symmetry. Our results reproduce\nand neatly generalize the known BRST symmetry of the rigid rotor showing that\nit constitutes a particular case of a broader class of theories.\n", "  Bismuth substituted lutetium iron garnet (BLIG) films exhibit larger Faraday\nrotation, and have a higher Curie temperature than yttrium iron garnet. We have\nobserved magnetic stripe domains and measured domain widths of 1.4 {\\mu}{\\mu}m\nusing Fourier domain polarization microscopy, Faraday rotation experiments\nyield a coercive field of 5 Oe. These characterizations form the basis of\nmicromagnetic simulations that allow us to estimate and compare spin wave\nexcitations in BLIG films. We observed that these films support thermal magnons\nwith a precessional frequency of 7 GHz with a line width of 400 MHz. Further,\nwe studied the dependence of precessional frequency on the externally applied\nmagnetic field. Brillouin light scattering experiments and precession\nfrequencies predicted by simulations show similar trend with increasing field.\n", "  We have elucidated the dynamic phase transition features and finite-size\nscaling analysis of the triangular lattice system under the presence of a\nsquare-wave magnetic field. It has been found that as the value of half-period\nof the external field reaches its critical value, whose location is estimated\nby means of Binder cumulant, the system presents a dynamic phase transition\nbetween dynamically ordered and disordered phases. Moreover, at the dynamic\nphase transition point, finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo results for the\ndynamic order parameter and susceptibility give the critical exponents\n$\\beta/\\nu=0.143\\pm0.004$ and $\\gamma/\\nu=1.766\\pm0.036$, respectively. The\nobtained critical exponents show that present magnetic system belongs to same\nuniversality class with the two-dimensional equilibrium Ising model.\n", "  HETE J1900.1--2455 is a peculiar accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP)\nbecause it has shown intermittent pulsations after 22 days from the beginning\nof its outburst. The origin of intermittent pulses in accreting systems remains\nto be understood. To better investigate the phenomenon of intermittent\npulsations here we present an analysis of 7 years of X-ray data collected with\nthe Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer and focus on the aperiodic variability. We show\nthat the power spectral components follow the same frequency correlations as\nthe non-pulsating atoll sources. We also study the known kHz QPO and we show\nthat it reaches a frequency of up to approximately 900 Hz, which is the highest\nfrequency observed for any kHz QPO in an AMXP. We also report the discovery of\na new kHz QPO at ~500 Hz. Finally, we discuss in further detail the known pulse\nphase drift observed in this source, which so far has no explanation. We\ninterpret the behavior of the aperiodic variability, the high frequency of the\n900 kHz QPO and the presence of the pulse drift as three independent pieces of\nevidence for a very weak neutron star magnetosphere in HETE J1900.1--2455.\n", "  Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory are used to examine the hot\ngas properties within a sample of 10 galaxy groups selected from the Galaxy And\nMass Assembly survey's optical Friends-of-Friends group catalogue. Our groups\nhave been screened to eliminate spurious and unrelaxed systems, and the\neffectiveness of this procedure is demonstrated by the detection of\nintergalactic hot gas in 80 per cent of our sample. However, we find that 9 of\nthe 10 are X-ray underluminous by a mean factor of $\\sim$4 compared to typical\nX-ray-selected samples. Consistent with this, the majority of our groups have\ngas fractions that are lower and gas entropies somewhat higher than those seen\nin typical X-ray-selected samples. Two groups, which have high 2{\\sigma} lower\nlimits on their gas entropy, are candidates for the population of high-entropy\ngroups predicted by some active galactic nucleus feedback models.\n", "  A high-resolution spectrum of the helium-rich `hot subdwarf' GALEX\nJ184559.8-413827 (J1845-4138) obtained with SALT HRS demonstrates it to be the\nfirst extreme helium (EHe) star to be discovered in nearly 40 years. A\nquantitative analysis demonstrates it to have an atmosphere described by Teff =\n26 170 +/- 750 K, log g /(cm s^-2) = 4.22 +/- 0.10, and a surface chemistry\ncharacterised by CNO-processed helium, a 1% contamination of hydrogen (by\nnumber), and a metallicity 0.4 dex subsolar. Its distance and position are\nconsistent with membership of the Galactic bulge. Its sharp absorption lines\nplace strong constraints on both the rotation and microturbulent velocities.\nSpectroscopically, J1845-4138 closely resembles the pulsating EHe star V652\nHer, generally considered to be the product of a double helium white dwarf\nmerger evolving to become a helium-rich sdO star.\n", "  The stellar composition of the Tycho-2 Catalogue in the range $0.75<B-V<1.25$\nhas been reproduced through Monte Carlo simulations. For young and old stars of\nthe red giant clump (RGC), the red giant branch, subgiants, red dwarfs, and\nthick-disk giants, we have specified the distributions in coordinates,\nvelocities, $B-V$, and $M_V$ as a function of $B-V$ and calculated their\nreduced proper motions, photometric distances from the $(B-V)-M_V$ calibration,\nand photoastrometric distances from the reduced proper motion -- $M_V$\ncalibration. Our simulations have shown the following: (1) a sample of\nthin-disk giants within 500 pc with an admixture of less than 10\\% of other\nstars can be produced; (2) a sample of dwarfs within 100 pc almost without any\nadmixture of other stars can be produced; (3) the Local Spiral Arm affects the\nRGC composition of any magnitude-limited catalog in favor of giants younger\nthan 2 Gyr; (4) the samples produced using reduced proper motions can be used\nfor kinematic studies, provided that the biases of the quantities being\ndetermined are simulated and taken into account; (5) the photometric distances\ncorrelate with the photoastrometric ones because of the correlation between the\nproper motion and magnitude; (6) the photometric distances are closer to the\ntrue ones for the red giant branch and red dwarfs as the categories of stars\nwith a clear $(B-V)-M_V$ relation, while the photoastrometric distances are\ncloser to the true ones for the RGC, subgiants, and thick-disk giants; (7) the\ncalculated distances differ systematically from the true ones, but they can be\nused to analyze the three-dimensional distribution of stars. Our simulations\nconfirm the validity of our previous selection of RGC stars from Tycho-2.\n", "  We evaluate the number of monic polynomials (of arbitrary degree $N$) the\nzeros of which equal their coefficients when these are allowed to take\narbitrary complex values. In the following, we call polynomials with this\nproperty {\\em peculiar\\/} polynomials. We further show that the problem of\ndetermining the peculiar polynomials of degree $N$ simplifies when any of the\ncoefficients is either 0 or 1. We proceed to estimate the numbers of peculiar\npolynomials of degree $N$ having one coefficient zero, or one coefficient equal\nto one, or neither.\n", "  Iterative construction of a Sierpinski carpet or sponge is regarded as a\ncritical phenomenon analogous to uncorrelated percolation. Critical exponents\nare derived or calculated that are related by equations identical to those\nobtained from percolation theory. Finite-size scaling then gives accurate\nvalues for the conductivity of the carpet or sponge at any stage of iteration.\n", "  Integer arithmetic is the underpinning of many quantum algorithms, with\napplications ranging from Shor's algorithm over HHL for matrix inversion to\nHamiltonian simulation algorithms. A basic objective is to keep the required\nresources to implement arithmetic as low as possible. This applies in\nparticular to the number of qubits required in the implementation as for the\nforeseeable future this number is expected to be small. We present a reversible\ncircuit for integer multiplication that is inspired by Karatsuba's recursive\nmethod. The main improvement over circuits that have been previously reported\nin the literature is an asymptotic reduction of the amount of space required\nfrom $O(n^{1.585})$ to $O(n^{1.427})$. This improvement is obtained in exchange\nfor a small constant increase in the number of operations by a factor less than\n$2$ and a small asymptotic increase in depth for the parallel version. The\nasymptotic improvement are obtained from analyzing pebble games on complete\nternary trees.\n", "  A novel nanostructured cemented carbide formed from WC-5%Co-20%BNi2 brazing\nalloy is described. During sintering, the BNi2 alloy is infiltrated into a\ngreen compact of WC-5%Co at 1050-1100 {\\deg}C for 2-60 minutes. Perfect wetting\nbehavior and a zero contact angle are achieved after only 40 s. Relative\ndensities of 98.5% and 100% and microhardness values of above 1500HV1 and\n1800HV1 are obtained after 2 and 30 minutes, respectively. A change in mean\nparticle size of about 600 nm in the precursor to a bimodal distribution of\n350-400 nm and 10-20 nm is explained by a solution/reprecipitation mechanism.\n", "  Very few exact solutions are known for the non-linear Vialov ordinary\ndifferential equation describing the longitudinal profiles of alpine glaciers\nand ice caps under the assumption that the ice deforms according to Glen's\nconstitutive relationship. Using a simple, yet wide, class of models for the\naccumulation rate of ice and Chebysev's theorem on the integration of binomial\ndifferentials, many new exact solutions of the Vialov equations are obtained in\nterms of elementary functions.\n", "  In recent years there have appeared in the literature a large number of\nstatic, spherically symmetric metrics, which are regular at the origin,\nasymptotically flat, and have both an event and a Cauchy horizon for certain\nrange of the parameters. They have been interpreted as regular black hole (BH)\nspacetimes, and their physical source attributed to electric or magnetic\nmonopoles in a suitable chosen nonlinear electrodynamics. Here we show that\nthese metrics can also be interpreted as exact solutions of the Einstein\nequations coupled to ordinary linear electromagnetism{\\textemdash}i.e., as\nsources of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) spacetime{\\textemdash}provided the\ncomponents of the effective energy-momentum tensor satisfy the dominant energy\ncondition (DEC). We use some well-known regular BH metrics to construct\nnonsingular RN black holes, where the singularity at the RN center is replaced\nby a regular perfect fluid charged sphere (whose charge-to-mass ratio is not\ngreater than $1$) which is inside the RN inner horizon.\n", "  Topological data analysis is an emerging mathematical concept for\ncharacterizing shapes in multi-scale data. In this field, persistence diagrams\nare widely used as a descriptor of the input data, and can distinguish robust\nand noisy topological properties. Nowadays, it is highly desired to develop a\nstatistical framework on persistence diagrams to deal with practical data. This\npaper proposes a kernel method on persistence diagrams. A theoretical\ncontribution of our method is that the proposed kernel allows one to control\nthe effect of persistence, and, if necessary, noisy topological properties can\nbe discounted in data analysis. Furthermore, the method provides a fast\napproximation technique. The method is applied into several problems including\npractical data in physics, and the results show the advantage compared to the\nexisting kernel method on persistence diagrams.\n", "  The authors argue that the calculated $^6$He binding energies by the solution\nof the coupled Yakubovsky integral equation in a partial wave decomposition\nreported by E. Ahmadi Pouya and A. A. Rajabi [Eur. Phys. J. Plus (2016) 131:\n240] are incorrect. The formalism of the paper has serious mistakes and the\nnumerical results are not reproducible and cannot be validated.\n", "  Photometric redshifts (photo-z's) provide an alternative way to estimate the\ndistances of large samples of galaxies and are therefore crucial to a large\nvariety of cosmological problems. Among the various methods proposed over the\nyears, supervised machine learning (ML) methods capable to interpolate the\nknowledge gained by means of spectroscopical data have proven to be very\neffective. METAPHOR (Machine-learning Estimation Tool for Accurate PHOtometric\nRedshifts) is a novel method designed to provide a reliable PDF (Probability\ndensity Function) of the error distribution of photometric redshifts predicted\nby ML methods. The method is implemented as a modular workflow, whose internal\nengine for photo-z estimation makes use of the MLPQNA neural network (Multi\nLayer Perceptron with Quasi Newton learning rule), with the possibility to\neasily replace the specific machine learning model chosen to predict photo-z's.\nAfter a short description of the software, we present a summary of results on\npublic galaxy data (Sloan Digital Sky Survey - Data Release 9) and a comparison\nwith a completely different method based on Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\ntemplate fitting.\n", "  This paper demonstrates designing and developing of an Ultra-Low Noise\nAmplifier which should potentially increase the sensitivity of the existing\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems. The Design of the LNA is fabricated\nand characterized including matching and input high power protection circuits.\nThe estimate improvement of SNR of the LNA in comparison to room temperature\noperation is taken here. The Cascode amplifier topology is chosen to be\ninvestigated for high performance Low Noise amplifier design and for the\nfabrication. The fabricated PCB layout of the Cascode LNA is tested by using\nmeasurement instruments Spectrum Analyser and Vector Network analyzer. The\nmeasurements of fabricated PCB layout of the Cascode LNA at room temperature\nhad the following performance, the operation frequency is 32 MHz, the noise\nfigure is 0.45 dB at source impedance 50 {\\Omega}, the gain is 11.6 dB, the\noutput return loss is 21.1 dB, and the input return loss 0.12 dB and it is\nunconditionally stable for up to 6 GHz band. The goal of the research is\nachieved where the Cascode LNA had improvement of SNR.\n", "  Commuting and noncommuting space-time coordinates in a class of deformed\nspecial relativity theories are investigated. Their momentum space\nrepresentation, transformation behaviour, space-time algebra, invariants and\nthe corresponding field theories are derived. Several coordinates require as a\nnovel feature the introduction of deformed plane waves.\n", "  Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG) is a categorical version of\ndifferential geometry based on enriching the real line with infinitesimals and\nweakening of classical logic to intuitionistic logic. We show that SDG provides\nan effective mathematical tool to formulate general relativity in\ninfinitesimally small domains. Such a domain is modelled by a monad around a\npoint $x$ of a manifold $M$, defined as a collection of points in $M$ that\ndiffer from $x$ by an infinitesimal value. Monads have rich enough matematical\nstructure to allow for the existence of all geomeric quantities necesary to\nconstruct general relativity \"in the smallest\". We focus on connection and\ncurvature. We also comment on the covariance principle and the equivalence\nprinciple in this context. Identification of monads with what happens \"beneath\nthe Planck threshold\" could open new possibilities in our search for quantum\ngravity theory.\n", "  Liquid-phase-exfoliation is a technique capable of producing large quantities\nof two-dimensional material in suspension. Despite many efforts in the\noptimization of the exfoliation process itself not much has been done towards\nthe integration of liquid-phase-exfoliated materials in working solid-state\ndevices. In this article, we use dielectrophoresis to direct the assembly of\nliquid-phase-exfoliated TiS3 nanoribbons between two gold electrodes to produce\nphotodetectors working in the visible. Through electrical and optical\nmeasurements we characterize the responsivity of the device and we find values\nas large as 3.8 mA/W, which improve of more than one order of magnitude on the\nstate-of-the-art for devices based on liquid-phase-exfoliated two-dimensional\nmaterials assembled by drop-casting or ink-jet methods.\n", "  Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have demonstrated that shock waves\ncould be produced in the intergalactic medium by supersonic flow motions during\nthe course of hierarchical clustering of the large-scale-structure in the\nUniverse. Similar to interplanetary shocks and supernova remnants (SNRs), these\nstructure formation shocks can accelerate cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons\nvia diffusive shock acceleration. External accretion shocks, which form in the\noutermost surfaces of nonlinear structures, are as strong as SNR shocks and\ncould be potential accelerations sites for high energy CR protons up to\n$10^{18}$ eV. But it could be difficult to detect their signatures due to\nextremely low kinetic energy flux associated with those accretion shocks. On\nthe other hand, radiative features of internal shocks in the hot intracluster\nmedium have been identified as temperature and density discontinuities in X-ray\nobservations and diffuse radio emission from accelerated CR electrons. However,\nthe non-detection of gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters due to $\\pi^0$\ndecay still remains to be an outstanding problem.\n", "  We introduce the open source parameter estimation tool \\textit{awkt}. It is\nprimarily aimed at assisting in the characterization and identification of\nglobular proteins using capillary zone electrophoresis. The program untangles a\nproteins' charge-to-size ratio by applying nonlinear least-squares optimization\nto a particular closed-form solution of the Nernst-Planck equation. Numerical\nestimates for the diffusion coefficient, the hydrodynamic radius and the net\nelectric charge are computed for all molecular entities that are being detected\nduring the electropherogram analysis process. The program offers control\nparameters for various operational features, including hypothesis testing and\nmodel selection, peak detection, baseline correction and concurrent file\nprocessing.\n", "  Nonaromatic amino acids are generally believed to be nonemissive, owing to\ntheir lack of apparently remarkable conjugation within individual molecules.\nHere we report the intrinsic visible emission of nonaromatic amino acids and\npoly(amino acids) in concentrated solutions and solid powders. This unique and\nwidespread luminescent characteristic can be well rationalized by the\nclustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, namely the clustering of\nnonconventional chromophores (i.e. amino, carbonyl, and hydroxyl) and\nsubsequent electron cloud overlap with simultaneously conformation\nrigidification. Such CTE mechanism is further supported by the single crystal\nstructure analysis. Besides prompt fluorescence, room temperature\nphosphorescence (RTP) are also detected from the solids. Moreover, persistent\nRTP is observed in the powders of exampled poly(amino acid) of\n{\\epsilon}-poly-L-lysine ({\\epsilon}-PLL) after ceasing UV irradiation. These\nresults not only illustrate the feasibility of employing the building blocks of\nnonaromatic amino acids in the exploration of new luminescent biomolecules, but\nalso provide significant implications for the RTP of peptides and proteins at\naggregated or crystalline states.\n", "  We compute the polarization function in a doped three-dimensional\nanisotropic-Weyl semimetal, in which the fermion energy dispersion is linear in\ntwo components of the momenta and quadratic in the third. Through detailed\ncalculations, we find that the long wavelength plasmon mode depends on the\nfermion density $n_e$ in the form $\\Omega_{p}^{\\bot}\\propto n_{e}^{3/10}$\nwithin the basal plane and behaves as $\\Omega_{p}^{z}\\propto n_{e}^{1/2}$ along\nthe third direction. This unique characteristic of the plasmon mode can be\nprobed by various experimental techniques, such as electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy. The Debye screening at finite chemical potential and finite\ntemperature is also analyzed based on the polarization function.\n", "  In 8 years of operation, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi\nsatellite has impacted our understanding of gamma-ray pulsars dramatically. The\nLAT now sees over two hundred pulsars: the largest class of GeV sources in the\nMilky Way. They are diverse -- radio loud versus quiet, young versus\nmillisecond, in evolving binary systems versus isolated, and so on. Relatively\nfew of the GeV pulsars have also been seen in soft gamma rays. After an\noverview, we present 10 new radio pulsars, six young and four recycled, for\nwhich we detect gamma-ray pulsations.\n", "  The irradiation with the 10 ns pulsed infrared Nd:YAG laser was applied to\ntransform FePdCu multilayers into chemically ordered L10 phase. The X-ray\ndiffraction methods (Theta/2Theta scan, psi-scan, omega-scan) were used to\ntrace the presence of L10 phase after laser annealing with different number of\npulses. The size and shape of crystallites was determined depending on their\norientation with respect to film plane. The (111) oriented crystallites of\nconstituent metals were built as coherent domains spreading through multilayers\nduring deposition of films. Laser annealing induced the transformation of\nmultilayers to alloy, and the ordering of (111) oriented crystallites.\nSimultaneously, the (002) oriented crystallites appeared confirming the\ntransformation to L10 alloy.\n", "  The realization of reliable single photon emitters operating at high\ntemperature and located at predetermined positions still presents a major\nchallenge for the development of solid-state systems for quantum light\napplications. We demonstrate single-photon emission from two-dimensional\nordered arrays of GaN nanowires containing InGaN nano-disks. The structures\nwere fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on (0001) GaN-on-sapphire templates\npatterned with nanohole masks prepared by colloidal lithography.\nLow-temperature cathodoluminescence measurements reveal the spatial\ndistribution of light emitted from a single nanowire heterostructure. The\nemission originating from the topmost part of the InGaN regions covers the\nblue-to-green spectral range and shows intense and narrow quantum dot-like\nphotoluminescence lines. These lines exhibit an average linear polarization\nratio of 92%. Photon correlation measurements show photon antibunching with a\ng(2)(0) values well below the 0.5 threshold for single photon emission. The\nantibunching rate increases linearly with the optical excitation power,\nextrapolating to the exciton decay rate of ~1 ns-1 at vanishing pump power.\nThis value is comparable with the exciton lifetime measured by time-resolved\nphotoluminescence. Fast and efficient single photon emitters with controlled\nspatial position and strong linear polarization are an important step towards\nhigh-speed on-chip quantum information management.\n", "  Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are at the basis of many applications for\nquantum information management. Semiconductor-based SPEs are best suited for\npractical implementations because of high design flexibility, scalability and\nintegration potential in practical devices. Single-photon emission from ordered\narrays of InGaN nano-disks embedded in GaN nanowires is reported. Intense and\nnarrow optical emission lines from quantum dot-like recombination centers are\nobserved in the blue-green spectral range. Characterization by electron\nmicroscopy, cathodoluminescence and micro-photoluminescence indicate that\nsingle photons are emitted from regions of high In concentration in the\nnano-disks due to alloy composition fluctuations. Single-photon emission is\ndetermined by photon correlation measurements showing deep anti-bunching minima\nin the second-order correlation function. The present results are a promising\nstep towards the realization of on-site/on-demand single-photon sources in the\nblue-green spectral range operating in the GHz frequency range at high\ntemperatures.\n", "  The optical emission of InGaN quantum dots embedded in GaN nanowires is\ndynamically controlled by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). The emission energy of\nboth the exciton and biexciton lines is modulated over a 1.5 meV range at ~330\nMHz. A small but systematic difference in the exciton and biexciton spectral\nmodulation reveals a linear change of the biexciton binding energy with the SAW\namplitude. The present results are relevant for the dynamic control of\nindividual single photon emitters based on nitride semiconductors.\n", "  Since its discovery in 1966, the photorefractive effect, i.e. the change of\nthe refractive index upon illumination with light, has been studied extensively\nin various materials and has turned out to play a key role in modern optical\ntechnologies like photonics. This article focuses on substances that change\ntheir refractive index for neutrons when irradiated with light. In analogy to\nlight optics, we call them photo-neutronrefractive. After a short introduction\nto the relevant concepts of neutron optics, two materials exhibiting that\neffect, a photopolymer and an electrooptic crystal, are presented. Further, we\ndiscuss the the progress made concerning the development of creating\nlight-induced gratings for neutron diffraction, which culminated in the setup\nof an interferometer for cold neutrons. Experiments performed on\nphoto-neutronrefractive materials are surveyed and the variety of corresponding\nresults obtained is presented, including a discussion of their impact on\nmaterial science, neutron optics, and the foundations of physics.\n", "  The Belle II experiment is under construction at the KEK laboratory in Japan.\nBelle II will study e+e- collisions at or near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with\nthe goal of collecting 50 ab-1 of data, which is a large increase over that\nrecorded by the Belle and BaBar experiments. This data will provide a large\nsample of charm meson decays. In this report we present the expected\nsensitivity of Belle II for measuring time-dependent mixing and CP violation in\nthe D0-D0bar system. We focus on measurements of D0-> K+ pi-, D0-> K+ pi- pi0,\nand D0-> K0_S pi+ pi- decays.\n", "  A novel methodology to analyze non-Gaussian probability distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) of intermittent turbulent transport in global full-f\ngyrokinetic simulations is presented. In this work, the Auto-Regressive\nIntegrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is applied to time series data of\nintermittent turbulent heat transport to separate noise and oscillatory trends,\nallowing for the extraction of non-Gaussian features of the PDFs. It was shown\nthat non-Gaussian tails of the PDFs from first principles based gyrokinetic\nsimulations agree with an analytical estimation based on a two fluid model.\n", "  Ion acoustic (IA) solitons are accompanied by vortex-shaped nonlinear\nstructures (e.g. hollows, plateaus or humps) in the electron distribution\nfunction, called electron holes, portraying trapped electrons. These structures\nappear as charged flexible clouds (shielded by the background plasma) in the\nphase space with their own inertia, depending on the number of trapped\nelectrons. According to simulation studies, electron holes tend to merge in\npairs until one accumulative hole remains in the simulation box. This tendency\nhas been analytically and qualitatively explained in the frame of the energy\nconservation principle. However, electron holes accompanying IA solitons should\nnot merge due to stability of IA solitons against mutual collisions. In this\nreport based on a fully kinetic simulation approach, detailed study of the\ncollisions of IA solitons reveals the behavior of electron holes under these\ntwo conflicting predictions, i.e. stability against mutual collisions and\nmerging tendency. Four main results are reported here. Firstly, we find that\namong the three different types of collisions possible for electron holes, just\ntwo of them happen for electron holes accompanying IA solitons. We present\ndifferent collisions, e.g. two large/small and large versus small holes, to\ncover all the these three different types of collisions. Secondly, we show that\nalthough electron holes merge during collisions of IA solitons, the stability\nof IA solitons forces the merged hole to split and form new electron holes.\nThirdly, we reveal that holes share their trapped population during collisions.\nPost-collision holes incorporate some parts of the oppositely propagating\nbefore-collision holes. Finally, it is shown that the newly added population of\ntrapped electrons goes through a spiral path inside the after-collision holes\nhole because of dissipative effects.\n", "  In this paper we construct a solution of the two-dimensional problem of the\nelasticity theory (plane deformation) on pressing of the flat stamp in the\nrectangular plate by using the symbolic method and the exact solution of the\nharmonic equation for a rectangle. The substitution of symbolic functions that\nsatisfy the harmonic equation, with relevant solutions of harmonic functions\nallows obtaining the exact solution of the problem.\n", "  Low temperature thermochronology plays a key role in the study of tectonic\nevolution of the upper crust. The general application of thermal history\nmodelling of apatite fission-track analysis requires both the parameters of the\napparent age together with the confined track-length distribution of the\nspontaneous tracks. However, obtaining length data is relatively easy and does\nnot require either irradiation or LA-ICP-MS commonly used for determining the\nuranium content of the grains for age dating. This leads to a shorter\nlaboratory process. For this purpose, based on apatite U-Th/He method, this\npaper attempts to decouple apatite fission-track age from apatite fission-track\nlength, and then combine the lengths with the respective apatite U-Th/He age to\nmodel the thermal history. Therefore, experiments were designed and conducted\nusing a new program \"Low-T Thermo\". Results of this modelling are presented\nfrom the following experiments: apatite fission-track age combined with apatite\nU-Th/He age; apatite fission-track confined track-length distribution plus\napatite U-Th/He age. The modelling precision using this method is related to\nthe relative errors of the apatite U-Th/He ages and the helium diffusion model.\nThis combination of apatite fission-track length and apatite U-Th/He ages has\nnot been implemented before but is presented here as an alternative way of\ndetermining thermal histories without the addition of apatite fission-track\nages.\n", "  The chance (or probability) of a dam failure can change for various reasons\nsuch as structural degradation, the impacts of climate change and land-use\nchange. Similarly the consequences of dam failure (flooding) can change for\nmany reasons such as growth in the population in areas below a dam.\nConsequently both the chance that a dam might fail and the likely consequences\nof that failure can change over time. It is therefore crucial that reservoir\nsafety risk analysis methods and decision-making processes are able to support\n(as a minimum) what-if testing (or sensitivity testing) to take into account\nthese changes over time to gauge their effect on the estimated risk of dam\nfailure. The consequences of a dam failure relate to the vulnerability and\nexposure of the receptors (for example, people, property and environment) to\nfloodwater. Also the probability of dam failure varies with age, design and\nconstruction of the dam. Spillway failure may be caused by the dissipation of\nenergy from water flowing down the spillway, and embankment erosion (scour) may\nbe caused by a dam overtopping. The occurrence of these events depends upon the\ndam design and the likelihood of extreme rainfall, also in the case of\novertopping wind-driven waves on the reservoir surface. In this study the\nmeteorological situations of notable recent events i.e. the Boltby, North\nYorkshire incident, 19 June 2005 in which the dam almost overtopped, and the\nspillway failure of the Ulley Dam near Rotherham at the end of June 2007, are\nstudied. The WRF numerical model will be used to indicate how these\nmeteorological situations might be maximized, and be coupled with the\noccurrence of other failure modes such as the likelihood of internal dam\nfailure assessed from previous work by government panel engineers.\n", "  Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) seen in the time derivative of the GOES soft\nX-ray light curves are analyzed for the near-limb X3.2 event on 14 May 2013.\nThe pulsations are apparent for a total of at least two hours from the\nimpulsive phase to well into the decay phase, with a total of 163 distinct\npulses evident to the naked eye. A wavelet analysis shows that the\ncharacteristic time scale of these pulsations increases systematically from\n$\\sim$25 s at 01:10 UT, the time of the GOES peak, to $\\sim$100 s at 02:00 UT.\nA second ridge in the wavelet power spectrum, most likely associated with\nflaring emission from a different active region, shows an increase from\n$\\sim$40 s at 01:40 UT to $\\sim$100 s at 03:10 UT. We assume that the QPP that\nproduced the first ridge result from vertical kink-mode oscillations of the\nnewly formed loops following magnetic reconnection in the coronal current\nsheet. This allows us to estimate the magnetic field strength as a function of\naltitude given the density, loop length, and QPP time scale as functions of\ntime determined from the GOES light curves and RHESSI images. The calculated\nmagnetic field strength of the newly formed loops ranges from about $\\sim$500 G\nat an altitude of 24 Mm to a low value of $\\sim$10 G at 60 Mm, in general\nagreement with the expected values at these altitudes. Fast sausage mode\noscillations are also discussed and cannot be ruled out as an alternate\nmechanism for producing the QPP.\n", "  We investigate the conditions under which the fluting ($m = 2$), $m = 3$, and\n$m = 12$ magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in a uniformly twisted flux tube\nmoving along its axis become unstable in order to model the Kelvin--Helmholtz\n(KH) instability in a twisting solar coronal hole jet near the northern pole of\nthe Sun. Using a twisting jet of 2010 August 21 by \\emph{SDO}/AIA and other\nobservations of coronal jets we set the parameters of our theoretical model and\nhave obtained that in a twisted magnetic flux tube of radius of $9.8$~Mm, at a\ndensity contrast of $0.474$ and fixed Alfv\\'en Mach number of ${\\cong}0.76$,\nfor three MHD modes there exist instability windows whose width crucially\ndepends upon the internal magnetic field twist. It is found that for the\nconsidered modes an azimuthal magnetic field of $1.3$--$1.4$~G (computed at the\ntube boundary) makes the width of the instability windows equal to zero, that\nis, it suppress the KH instability onset. On the other hand, the times for\ndeveloping KH instability of the $m = 12$ MHD mode at instability wavelengths\nbetween $15$ and $12$~Mm turn out to be in the range of $1.9$ to $4.7$~minutes\nthat is in agreement with the growth rates estimated from the temporal\nevolution of the observed unstable jet's blobs in their initial stage.\n", "  The metallicity gradients of the stellar populations in disc galaxies and\ntheir evolution store relevant information on the disc formation history and on\nthose processes which could mix stars a posteriori, such as migration, bars\nand/or galaxy-galaxy interactions. We aim to investigate the evolution of the\nmetallicity gradients of the whole stellar populations in disc components of\nsimulated galaxies in a cosmological context. We analyse simulated disc\ngalaxies selected from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that includes\nchemical evolution and a physically motivated Supernova feedback capable of\ndriving mass-loaded galactic winds. We detect a mild evolution with redshift in\nthe metallicity slopes of $-0.02 \\pm 0.01$ dex~kpc$^{-1}$ from $z\\sim 1$. If\nthe metallicity profiles are normalised by the effective radius of the stellar\ndisc, the slopes show no clear evolution for $z < 1$, with a median value of\napproximately $-0.23$ dex ~$r_{\\rm reff}^{-1}$. As a function of stellar mass,\nwe find that metallicity gradients steepen for stellar masses smaller than\n$\\sim 10^{10.3} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ while the trend reverses for higher stellar\nmasses, in the redshift range $z=[0,1]$. Galaxies with small stellar masses\nhave discs with larger $r_{\\rm reff}$ and flatter metallicity gradients than\nexpected. We detect migration albeit weaker than in previous works. Our stellar\ndiscs show a mild evolution of the stellar metallicity slopes up to $z\\sim 1,$\nwhich is well-matched by the evolution calculated archeologically from the\nabundance distributions of mono-age stellar populations at $z\\sim 0$. Overall,\nSupernova feedback could explain the trends but an impact of migration can not\nbe totally discarded. Galaxy-galaxy interactions or small satellite accretions\ncan also contribute to modify the metallicity profiles in the outer parts.\n[abridged]\n", "  The Global Exploration Roadmap indicates the need for increased human\nexploration of under-sampled regions of our solar system in order to make new\nscientific discoveries. The high costs and dangers of sending humans deeper\ninto our solar system necessitates the use of human-robotic partnerships,\nespecially in transitioning from low-Earth orbit to deep-space operations.\nLow-latency planetary surface exploration is an example of a human-robotic\npartnership that provides an exciting option for effective, low-cost\nexploration of our solar system. However, low-latency telerobotic exploration\nis a new concept for space exploration and needs to be tested for its limits\nand effectiveness. This paper focuses on a human operator's ability to identify\nexploration targets in an unfamiliar environment using real-time low-latency\ntelerobotics under various frame rate conditions. This relationship was\ninvestigated using a Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS). The frame rates were\nvaried and the order of the exploration tasks were randomized for each\noperator. The rover operated at peak speeds of one meter per second with a\nvideo stream resolution of 640x480 and colorscale of 24 bits. The results from\nthis experiment indicate that 5 frames per second is the minimum necessary\nframe rate for effective exploration.\n"]}
