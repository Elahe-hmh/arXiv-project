These $Z_N$-invariant subgroups are phenomenologically\nimportant and in some cases they resemble the gauge groups of our real world.\nWe present a specific example of $Z_7$-invariant subgroups of $E_8$, which turn\nup in orbifold compactification of M-theory. Moreover, the procedure can be\napplied for any $Z_N$ group that acts by shifts (translations) in the root\nlattice of semisimple Lie groups with $A_n,B_n,C_n,D_n,E_6,E_7$ and $E_8$\nfactors.\n", "  Motivated by the recent numerical evidence[1] of a short-range resonating\nvalence bond state in the honeycomb lattice Hubbard model, we consider\nSchwinger boson mean field theories of possible spin liquid states on honeycomb\nlattice. From general stability considerations the possible spin liquids will\nhave gapped spinons coupled to Z$_2$ gauge field. We apply the projective\nsymmetry group(PSG) method to classify possible Z$_2$ spin liquid states within\nthis formalism on honeycomb lattice. It is found that there are only two\nrelevant Z$_2$ states, differed by the value of gauge flux, zero or $\\pi$, in\nthe elementary hexagon. The zero-flux state is a promising candidate for the\nobserved spin liquid and continuous phase transition into commensurate N\\'eel\norder. We also derive the critical field theory for this transition, which is\nthe well-studied O(4) invariant theory[2-4], and has an irrelevant coupling\nbetween Higgs and boson fields with cubic power of spatial derivatives as\nrequired by lattice symmetry. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional\ntheory[5], where such transition generically leads to non-colinear\nincommensurate magnetic order. In this scenario the Z$_2$ spin liquid could be\nclose to a tricritical point. Soft boson modes will exist at seven different\nwave vectors. This will show up as low frequency dynamical spin susceptibility\npeaks not only at the $\\Gamma$ point (the N\\'eel order wave vector) but also at\nBrillouin zone edge center $M$ points and twelve other points. Some simple\nproperties of the $\\pi$-flux state are studies as well. Symmetry allowed\nfurther neighbor mean field ansatz are derived in Appendix which can be used in\nfuture theoretical works along this direction.\n", "  We studied the pairing instabilities in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ using a two\nstage functional renormalization group (FRG) method. Our results suggest the\nleading and subleading pairing symmetries are nodeless $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and nodal\nextended $s$ respectively. In addition, despite having no Fermi surfaces we\nfind the buried hole bands make important contributions to the final effective\ninteraction. From the bandstructure, spin susceptibility and the FRG results we\nconclude that the low energy effective interaction in K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ is\nwell described by a $J_1-J_2$ model with dominant nearest-neighbor\nantiferromagnetic interaction $J_1$ (at least as far as the superconducting\npairing is concerned). In the end we briefly mention several obvious\nexperiments to test whether the pairing symmetry is indeed $d_{x^2-y^2}$.\n", "  If $X$ is a graph with adjacency matrix $A$, then we define $H(t)$ to be the\noperator $\\exp(itA)$. We say that we have perfect state transfer in $X$ from\nthe vertex $u$ to the vertex $v$ at time $\\tau$ if the $uv$-entry of\n$|H(\\tau)_{u,v}|=1$. This concept has potential applications in quantum\ncomputing. We offer a survey of some of the work on perfect state transfer and\nrelated questions. The emphasis is almost entirely on the mathematics.\n", "  We prove that if $p\\ge 1$ and $0< r\\le p$ then the sequence\n$\\binom{mp+r}{m}\\frac{r}{mp+r}$, $m=0,1,2,...$, is positive definite, more\nprecisely, is the moment sequence of a probability measure $\\mu(p,r)$ with\ncompact support contained in $[0,+\\infty)$. This family of measures encompasses\nthe multiplicative free powers of the Marchenko-Pastur distribution as well as\nthe Wigner's semicircle distribution centered at $x=2$. We show that if $p>1$\nis a rational number, $0<r\\le p$, then $\\mu(p,r)$ is absolutely continuous and\nits density $W_{p,r}(x)$ can be expressed in terms of the Meijer and the\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions. In some cases, including the\nmultiplicative free square and the multiplicative free square root of the\nMarchenko-Pastur measure, $W_{p,r}(x)$ turns out to be an elementary function.\n", "  The dynamics of Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as a lump of deconfined free quarks\nand gluons is elaborated. Based on the first principal we construct the\nLagrangian that represents the dynamics of QGP. To induce a hydrodynamics\napproach, we substitute the gluon fields with flow fields. As a result, the\nderived equation of Motion (E.O.M) for gluon dominated QGP shows the form that\nsimilar to Euler equation, and the energy momentum tensor also represents\nexplicitly the system of ideal fluid. Combining the E.O.M and energy momentum\ntensor, the pressure and energy density distribution as the equation of states\nare analytically derived.\n", "  This letter is my comment about the opinion paper: Transdisciplinary electric\npower grid science (PNAS, 2013 -\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/110/30/12159.full). [arXiv:1307.7305].\n", "  The existence of a quantum bounce in isotropic spacetimes is a key result in\nloop quantum cosmology (LQC), which has been demonstrated to arise in all the\nmodels studied so far. In most of the models, the bounce has been studied using\nnumerical simulations involving states which are sharply peaked and which\nbounce at volumes much larger than the Planck volume. An important issue is to\nconfirm the existence of the bounce for states which have a wide spread, or\nwhich bounce closer to the Planck volume. Numerical simulations with such\nstates demand large computational domains, making them very expensive and\npractically infeasible with the techniques which have been implemented so far.\nTo overcome these difficulties, we present an efficient hybrid numerical scheme\nusing the property that at the small spacetime curvature, the quantum\nHamiltonian constraint in LQC, which is a difference equation with uniform\ndiscretization in volume, can be approximated by a Wheeler-DeWitt differential\nequation. By carefully choosing a hybrid spatial grid allowing the use of\npartial differential equations at large volumes, and with a simple change of\ngeometrical coordinate, we obtain a surprising reduction in the computational\ncost. This scheme enables us to explore regimes which were so far unachievable\nfor the isotropic model in LQC. Our approach also promises to significantly\nreduce the computational cost for numerical simulations in anisotropic LQC\nusing high performance computing.\n", "  Berglund-H\\\"ubsch duality is an example of mirror symmetry between orbifold\nLandau-Ginzburg models. In this paper we study a D-module-theoretic variant of\nBorisov's proof of Berglund-H\\\"ubsch duality. In the $p$-adic case, the\nD-module approach makes it possible to endow the orbifold chiral rings with the\naction of a non-trivial Frobenius endomorphism. Our main result is that the\nFrobenius endomorphism commutes with Berglund-H\\\"ubsch duality up to an\nexplicit diagonal operator.\n", "  Considering quantum gravity effect, we investigate the quantum tunneling from\nhigh dimensional Kerr-G\\\"odel black hole using generalized Dirac equation. As a\nresult, revised tunneling probability is obtained, and the corrected Hawking\ntemperature is also presented.\n", "  We derive a model of dark energy which evolves with time via the scale\nfactor. The equation of state $\\omega=(1-2\\alpha)/(1+2\\alpha)$ is studied as a\nfunction of a parameter $\\alpha$ introduced in this model. In addition to the\nrecent accelerated expansion, the model predicts another decelerated phase. The\nage of the universe is found to be almost consistent with observation. In the\nlimiting case, the cosmological constant model, we find that vacuum energy\ngravitates with a gravitational strength, different than Newton's constant.\nThis enables degravitation of the vacuum energy which in turn produces the tiny\nobserved curvature, rather than a 120 orders of magnitude larger value.\n", "  We present the measurements of scatter broadening time-scales ($\\tau_{sc}$)\nfor 124 pulsars at 327 MHz, using the upgraded Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT).\nThese pulsars lie in the dispersion measure range of 37 $-$ 503 pc cm$^{-3}$\nand declination ($\\delta$) range of $-$57$^{\\circ} < \\delta< 60^{\\circ}$. New\n$\\tau_{sc}$ estimates for 58 pulsars are presented, increasing the sample of\nall such measurements by about 40% at 327 MHz. Using all available $\\tau_{sc}$\nmeasurements in the literature, we investigate the dependence of $\\tau_{sc}$ on\ndispersion measure. Our measurements, together with previously reported values\nfor $\\tau_{sc}$, affirm that the ionized interstellar medium upto 3 kpc is\nconsistent with Kolmogorov spectrum, while it deviates significantly beyond\nthis distance.\n", "  Designing networks with specified collective properties is useful in a\nvariety of application areas, enabling the study of how given properties affect\nthe behavior of network models, the downscaling of empirical networks to\nworkable sizes, and the analysis of network evolution. Despite the importance\nof the task, there currently exists a gap in our ability to systematically\ngenerate networks that adhere to theoretical guarantees for the given property\nspecifications. In this paper, we propose the use of Mixed-Integer Linear\nOptimization modeling and solution methodologies to address this Network\nGeneration Problem. We present a number of useful modeling techniques and apply\nthem to mathematically express and constrain network properties in the context\nof an optimization formulation. We then develop complete formulations for the\ngeneration of networks that attain specified levels of connectivity, spread,\nassortativity and robustness, and we illustrate these via a number of\ncomputational case studies.\n", "  We show that the ratio between the stellar mass of central galaxy and the\nmass of its host halo, $f_c \\equiv M_{*,c}/M_{\\rm h}$, can be used as an\nobservable proxy of halo assembly time, in that galaxy groups with higher $f_c$\nassembled their masses earlier. Using SDSS groups of Yang et al., we study how\n$f_c$ correlates with galaxy properties such as color, star formation rate,\nmetallicity, bulge to disk ratio, and size. Central galaxies of a given stellar\nmass in groups with $f_c>0.02$ tend to be redder in color, more quenched in\nstar formation, smaller in size, and more bulge dominated, as $f_c$ increases.\nThe trends in color and star formation appear to reverse at $f_c<0.02$,\nreflecting a down-sizing effect that galaxies in massive halos formed their\nstars earlier although the host halos themselves assembled later (lower $f_c$).\nNo such reversal is seen in the size of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that\ntheir assembly follows halo growth more closely than their star formation.\nSatellite galaxies of a given stellar mass in groups of a given halo mass tend\nto be redder in color, more quenched in star formation and smaller in size as\n$f_c$ increases. For a given stellar mass, satellites also tend to be smaller\nthan centrals. The trends are stronger for lower mass groups. For groups more\nmassive than $\\sim 10^{13}{\\rm M}_\\odot$, a weak reversed trend is seen in\ncolor and star formation. The observed trends in star formation are\nqualitatively reproduced by an empirical model based on halo age abundance\nmatching, but not by a semi-analytical model tested here.\n", "  Various forms of carbon based complexes in GaN are studied with\nfirst-principles calculations employing Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid\nfunctional within the framework of density functional theory. We consider\ncarbon complexes made of the combinations of single impurities, i.e.\n$\\mathrm{C_N-C_{Ga}}$, $\\mathrm{C_I-C_N}$ and $\\mathrm{C_I-C_{Ga}}$, where\n$\\mathrm{C_N}$, $\\mathrm{C_{Ga}}$ and $\\mathrm{C_I}$ denote C substituting\nnitrogen, C substituting gallium and interstitial C, respectively, and of\nneighboring gallium/nitrogen vacancies ($\\mathrm{V_{Ga}}$/$\\mathrm{V_N}$), i.e.\n$\\mathrm{C_N-V_{Ga}}$ and $\\mathrm{C_{Ga}-V_N}$. Formation energies are\ncomputed for all these configurations with different charge states after full\ngeometry optimizations. From our calculated formation energies, thermodynamic\ntransition levels are evaluated, which are related to the thermal activation\nenergies observed in experimental techniques such as deep level transient\nspectroscopy. Furthermore, the lattice relaxation energies (Franck-Condon\nshift) are computed to obtain optical activation energies, which are observed\nin experimental techniques such as deep level optical spectroscopy. We compare\nour calculated values of activation energies with the energies of\nexperimentally observed C-related trap levels and identify the physical origins\nof these traps, which are unknown before.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that (quasi-)crystalline phases of\nRydberg-dressed quantum many-body systems in optical lattices (OL) are within\nreach. Rydberg systems naturally possess strong long-range interactions due to\nthe large polarizability of Rydberg atoms. Thus a wide range of quantum phases\nhave been predicted, such as a devil's staircase of lattice incommensurate\ndensity wave phases as well as more exotic lattice supersolid order for bosonic\nsystems, as considered in our work. Guided by results in the \"frozen\" gas\nlimit, we study the ground state phase diagram at finite hopping amplitudes and\nin the vicinity of resonant Rydberg driving, while fully including the\nlong-range tail of the van der Waals interaction. Simulations within real-space\nbosonic dynamical mean-field theory (RB-DMFT) yield an extension of the devil's\nstaircase into the supersolid regime where the competition of condensation and\ninteraction leads to a sequence of crystalline phases.\n", "  Dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical\nentities and Einstein insisted that physics should describe \"the real states of\nthe real systems\". While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of\nstates, modern device-independent approaches do away with the idea of entities:\nphysical theory may contain no physical systems. Focusing on the correlations\nbetween operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods\npromote a view more distant from the conventional one than Einstein's\n'principle theories' were from 'constructive theories'. On the examples of\nindefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling\nquestion: if physical theory is not about systems, then what is it about? The\nanswer given by the device-independent models is that physics is about\nlanguages. In moving away from the information-theoretic reconstructions of\nquantum theory, this answer marks a new conceptual development in the\nfoundations of physics.\n", "  In this paper we give a derivation of a system of equations to describe the\nelectrodynamics of s-wave superconductors. First, we consider a\nrelativistically covariant theory in terms of gauge four-vector electromagnetic\npotential and scalar complex field. We use the first-order formalism to obtain\nthe supplemented Maxwell equations for gauge invariant electric, magnetic,\nfour-vector fields and the modulus of the superconducting order parameter. The\nnew four-vector field appears in some of the equations as a gauge invariant\nsuper-current and in other ones, while gauge invariant, as a four-vector\nelectromagnetic potential. This dual contribution of the new four-vector field\nis the basis of the electrodynamics of superconductors. We focus on the system\nof equations with time-independent fields. The qualitative analysis shows that\nthe applied magnetic field suppresses the superconductivity, while the applied\nelectric field impacts appositely, supporting it. Second we consider\ntime-dependent non-relativistic Ginzburg-Landau theory.\n", "  The onset and development of instabilities is one of the central problems in\nfluid mechanics. Here we develop a connection between instabilities of free\nfluid interfaces and inverted pendula. When acted upon solely by the\ngravitational force, the inverted pendulum is unstable. This position can be\nstabilised by the Kapitsa phenomenon, in which high-frequency low-amplitude\nvertical vibrations of the base creates a fictitious force which opposes the\ngravitational force. By transforming the dynamical equations governing a fluid\ninterface into an appropriate pendulum, we demonstrate how stability can be\ninduced in fluid systems by properly tuned vibrations. We construct a\n\"dictionary\"-type relationship between various pendula and the classical\nRayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Plateau and the self-gravitational\ninstabilities. This makes several results in control theory and dynamical\nsystems directly applicable to the study of \"tunable\" fluid instabilities,\nwhere the critical wavelength depends on the external forces or the instability\nis suppressed entirely. We suggest some applications and instances of the\neffect ranging in scale from microns to the radius of a galaxy.\n", "  We construct a closed system of equations describing the quark--anti-quark\npotential at any coupling in planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. It is\nbased on the Quantum Spectral Curve method supplemented with a novel type of\nasymptotics. We present a high precision numerical solution reproducing the\nclassical and one-loop string predictions very accurately. We also analytically\ncompute the first 7 nontrivial orders of the weak coupling expansion.\n  Moreover, we study analytically the generalized quark--anti-quark potential\nin the limit of large imaginary twist to all orders in perturbation theory. We\ndemonstrate how the QSC reduces in this case to a one-dimensional Schrodinger\nequation. In the process we establish a link between the Q-functions and the\nsolution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation.\n", "  We study how an arbitrary Gaussian state of two localized wave packets,\nprepared in an inertial frame of reference, is described by a pair of uniformly\naccelerated observers. We explicitly compute the resulting state for\narbitrarily chosen proper accelerations of the observers and independently\ntuned distance between them. To do so, we introduce a generalized Rindler frame\nof reference and analytically derive the corresponding state transformation as\na Gaussian channel. Our approach provides several new insights into the\nphenomenon of vacuum entanglement such as the highly non-trivial effect of\nspatial separation between the observers including sudden death of\nentanglement. We also calculate the fidelity of the two-mode channel for\nnon-vacuum Gaussian states and obtain bounds on classical and quantum\ncapacities of a single-mode channel. Our framework can be directly applied to\nany continuous variable quantum information protocol in which the effects of\nacceleration or gravity cannot be neglected.\n", "  The accurate calibration of photomultiplier tubes is critical in a wide\nvariety of applications for which it is necessary to know the absolute number\nof detected photons or precisely determine the resolution of the signal.\nConventional calibration methods rely on fitting the photomultiplier response\nto a low intensity light source with analytical approximations to the single\nphotoelectron distribution. We show that this approach often leads to biased\nestimates due to an inability to model the full distribution accurately,\nespecially at low charge values. We present a simple statistical method to\nextract the relevant single photoelectron calibration parameters (first two\ncentral moments) without making any assumptions about the underlying single\nphotoelectron distribution. We illustrate the use of this method through the\ncalibration of a Hamamatsu R11410 photomultiplier tube and study the accuracy\nand precision of the method using Monte Carlo simulations. The method is found\nto have significantly reduced bias compared to conventional methods and works\nunder a wide range of light intensities, making it suitable for the\nsimultaneous calibration of large arrays of photomultiplier tubes where uniform\nillumination may not be possible.\n", "  For each of the $8$ isotropy classes of elastic materials, we consider a\nhomogeneous random field taking values in the fixed point set $\\mathsf{V}$ of\nthe corresponding class, that is isotropic with respect to the natural\northogonal representation of a group lying between the isotropy group of the\nclass and its normaliser. We find the general form of the correlation tensors\nof orders $1$ and $2$ of such a field, and the field's spectral expansion.\n", "  [Background] The electromagnetic form factors of the proton measured by\nunpolarized and polarized electron scattering experiments show a significant\ndisagreement that grows with the squared four momentum transfer ($Q^{2}$).\nCalculations have shown that the two measurements can be largely reconciled by\naccounting for the contributions of two-photon exchange (TPE). TPE effects are\nnot typically included in the standard set of radiative corrections since\ntheoretical calculations of the TPE effects are highly model dependent, and,\nuntil recently, no direct evidence of significant TPE effects has been\nobserved.\n  [Purpose] We measured the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton\nelastic-scattering cross sections in order to determine the TPE contribution to\nelastic electron-proton scattering and thereby resolve the proton electric form\nfactor discrepancy.\n  [Methods] We produced a mixed simultaneous electron-positron beam in\nJefferson Lab's Hall B by passing the 5.6 GeV primary electron beam through a\nradiator to produce a bremsstrahlung photon beam and then passing the photon\nbeam through a convertor to produce electron/positron pairs. The mixed\nelectron-positron (lepton) beam with useful energies from approximately 0.85 to\n3.5 GeV then struck a 30-cm long liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$) target located within\nthe CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). By detecting both the scattered\nleptons and the recoiling protons we identified and reconstructed elastic\nscattering events and determined the incident lepton energy. A detailed\ndescription of the experiment is presented.\n", "  We use the most recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations to perform a\nstatistical comparison between the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model and its\nextensions [$w$CDM and $w(z)$CDM] and some alternative cosmologies: namely, the\nDvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) model, a power-law $f(R)$ scenario in the\nmetric formalism and an example of vacuum decay [$\\Lambda(t)$CDM] cosmology in\nwhich the dilution of pressureless matter is attenuated with respect to the\nusual $a^{-3}$ scaling due to the interaction of the dark matter and dark\nenergy fields. We perform a Bayesian model selection analysis using the\n\\textsc{MultiNest} algorithm. To obtain the posterior distribution for the\nparameters of each model, we use the joint light-curve analysis (JLA) SNe Ia\ncompilation containing 740 events in the interval $0.01 < z < 1.3$ along with\ncurrent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The JLA data are\nanalyzed with the SALT2 light-curve fitter and the model selection is then\nperformed by computing the Bayesian evidence of each model and the Bayes factor\nof the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology related to the other models. The results indicate\nthat the JLA data alone are unable to distinguish the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel from some of its alternatives but its combination with current\nmeasurements of baryon acoustic oscillations shows up an ability to distinguish\nthem. In particular, the DGP model is practically not supported by both the BAO\nand the joint JLA + BAO data sets compared to the standard scenario. Finally,\nwe provide a rank order for the models considered.\n", "  We effect thermodynamical formalism for the non-uniformly hyperbolic\n$C^\\infty$ map of the two dimensional torus known as the Katok map. It is a\nslowdown of a linear Anosov map near the origin and it is a local (but not\nsmall) perturbation. We prove the existence of equilibrium measures for any\ncontinuous potential function and obtain uniqueness of equilibrium measures\nassociated to the geometric $t$-potential $\\varphi_t=-t\\log |df|_{E^u(x)}|$ for\nany $t\\in(t_0,\\infty)$, $t\\neq 1$ where $E^u(x)$ denotes the unstable\ndirection. We show that $t_0$ tends to $-\\infty$ as the size of the\nperturbation tends to zero. Finally, we establish exponential decay of\ncorrelations as well as the Central Limit Theorem for the equilibrium measures\nassociated to $\\varphi_t$ for all values of $t\\in (t_0, 1)$.\n", "  We consider {\\em non-selective} continuous measurements of a particle\ntunneling to a reservoir of finite band-width ($\\Lambda$). The particle is\ncontinuously monitored by frequent projective measurements (\"quantum\ntrajectory\"), separated by a time-interval $\\tau$. A simple analytical\nexpression for the decay rate has been obtained. For Markovian reservoirs\n($\\Lambda\\to\\infty$), no effect of the measurements is found. Otherwise for a\nfinite $\\Lambda$, the decay rate always depends on the measurement time $\\tau$.\nThis result is compared with alternative calculations, with no intermediate\nmeasurements, but when the measurement device is included in the Schr\\\"odinger\nevolution. We found that the detector affects the system by the decoherence\nrate ($\\Gamma_d$), related to the detector's signal. Although both treatments\nare different, the final results become very close for $\\tau=2/\\Gamma_d$. This\n$\\tau$ corresponds to the minimal time for which the detector's signal can be\ndistinguished by an \"observer\". This indicates a fundamental role of\ninformation in quantum motion and can be used for the extension of the quantum\ntrajectory method for non-Markovian environments.\n", "  We provide a theory for quantum-optical realizations of the open Dicke model\nwith internal, atomic spin states subject to spontaneous emission with rate\n$\\gamma$. This introduces a second decay channel for excitations to\nirreversibly dissipate into the environment, in addition to the photon loss\nwith rate $\\kappa$, which is composed of individual atomic decay processes and\na collective atomic decay mechanism. The strength of the latter is determined\nby the cavity geometry. We compute the mean-field non-equilibrium steady states\nfor spin and photon observables in the long-time limit, $t\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nAlthough $\\gamma$ does not conserve the total angular momentum of the spin\narray, we argue that our solution is exact in the thermodynamic limit, for the\nnumber of atoms $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. In light of recent and upcoming\nexperiments realizing superradiant phase transitions using internal atomic\nstates with pinned atoms in optical lattices, our work lays the foundation for\nthe pursuit of a new class of open quantum magnets coupled to quantum light.\n", "  Two testable schemes for quantum heat engines are investigated under the\nquantization framework of noncommutative (NC) quantum mechanics (QM). By\nidentifying the phenomenological connection between the phase-space NC driving\nparameters and an effective external magnetic field, the NC effects on the\nefficiency coefficient, \\mathcal{N} , of quantum engines can be quantified for\ntwo different cycles: an isomagnetic one and an isoenergetic one. In addition,\npaying a special attention to the quantum Carnot cycle, one notices that the\ninclusion of NC effects does not affect the maximal (Carnot) efficiency,\n\\mathcal{N}^C, ratifying the robustness of the second law of thermodynamics.\n", "  Resorting to a recently developed theoretical device called dimensional\nregularization for quantum criticality with a Fermi surface, we examine a\nmetal-insulator quantum phase transition from a Landau's Fermi-liquid state to\na U(1) spin-liquid phase with a spinon Fermi surface in two dimensions.\nUnfortunately, we fail to approach the spin-liquid Mott quantum critical point\nfrom the U(1) spin-liquid state within the dimensional regularization\ntechnique. Self-interactions between charge fluctuations called holons are not\nscreened, which shows a run-away renormalization group flow, interpreted as\nholons remain gapped. This leads us to consider another fixed point, where the\nspinon Fermi surface can be destabilized across the Mott transition. Based on\nthis conjecture, we reveal the nature of the spin-liquid Mott quantum critical\npoint: Dimensional reduction to one dimension occurs for spin dynamics\ndescribed by spinons. As a result, Landau damping for both spin and charge\ndynamics disappear in the vicinity of the Mott quantum critical point. When the\nflavor number of holons is over its critical value, an interacting fixed point\nappears to be identified with an inverted XY universality class, controlled\nwithin the dimensional regularization technique. On the other hand, a\nfluctuation-driven first order metal-insulator transition results when it is\nbelow the critical number. We propose that the destabilization of a spinon\nFermi surface and the emergence of one-dimensional spin dynamics near the\nspin-liquid Mott quantum critical point can be checked out by spin\nsusceptibility with a $2 k_{F}$ transfer momentum, where $k_{F}$ is a Fermi\nmomentum in the U(1) spin-liquid state: The absence of Landau damping in U(1)\ngauge fluctuations gives rise to a divergent behavior at zero temperature while\nit vanishes in the presence of a spinon Fermi surface.\n", "  We report on the construction and testing of a vacuum-gap Fabry-P\\'erot\netalon calibrator for high precision radial velocity spectrographs. Our etalon\nis traced against a rubidium frequency standard to provide a cost effective,\nyet ultra-precise wavelength reference. We describe here a turn-key system\nworking at 500 nm to 900 nm, ready to be installed at any current and next\ngeneration radial velocity spectrograph that requires calibration over a wide\nspectral bandpass. Where appropriate, we have used off-the-shelf, commercial\ncomponents with demonstrated long-term performance to accelerate the\ndevelopment timescale of this instrument. Our system combines for the first\ntime the advantages of passively stabilized etalons for optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths with the laser-locking technique demonstrated for\nsingle-mode fiber etalons. We realize uncertainties in the position of one\netalon line at the 10 cm/s level in individual measurements taken at 4 Hz. When\nbinning the data over 10 s, we are able to trace the etalon line with a\nprecision of better than 3 cm/s . We present data obtained during a week of\ncontinuous operation where we detect (and correct for) the predicted, but\npreviously unobserved shrinking of the etalon Zerodur spacer corresponding to a\nshift of 13 cm/s per day.\n", "  Using a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy, we report the observation of\ntopologically nontrivial superconductivity on a single material of \\beta-Bi2Pd\nfilms grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The superconducting gap associated with\nspinless odd-parity pairing opens on the surface and appears much larger than\nthe bulk one due to the Dirac-fermion enhanced parity mixing of surface pair\npotential. Majorana zero modes (MZMs), supported by such superconducting\nstates, are identified at magnetic vortices. The superconductivity and MZMs\nexhibit resistance to nonmagnetic defects, characteristic of\ntime-reversal-invariant topological superconductors. Our results demonstrate a\nsimple platform to generate, manipulate and braid MZMs for quantum computation.\n", "  We investigate the sample complexity of Hamiltonian simulation: how many\ncopies of an unknown quantum state are required to simulate a Hamiltonian\nencoded by the density matrix of that state? We show that the procedure\nproposed by Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost [Nat. Phys., 10(9):631--633, 2014]\nis optimal for this task. We further extend their method to the case of\nmultiple input states, showing how to simulate any Hermitian polynomial of the\nstates provided. As applications, we derive optimal algorithms for commutator\nsimulation and orthogonality testing, and we give a protocol for creating a\ncoherent superposition of pure states, when given sample access to those\nstates. We also show that this sample-based Hamiltonian simulation can be used\nas the basis of a universal model of quantum computation that requires only\npartial swap operations and simple single-qubit states.\n", "  We extend a recent approach to Deformed Special Relativity based on deformed\ndispersion laws, entailing modified Lorentz transformations and, at the same\ntime, noncommutative geometry and intrinsically discrete spacetime. In so doing\nwe obtain the explicit form of the modified Lorentz transformations for a\nspecial class of modified momentum-energy relations often found in literature\nand arising from elementary particle physics. Actually, our theory looks as a\nvery simple and natural extension of special relativity to include a momentum\ncut-off at the Planck scale. In particular, the new Lorentz transformations do\nimply that for high boost speed ($V \\sim c$) the deformed Lorentz factor does\nnot diverge as in ordinary relativity, but results to be upperly bounded by a\nlarge finite value of the order of the ratio between the Planck mass and the\nparticle mass. We also predict that a generic boost leaves unchanged Planck\nenergy and momentum, which result invariant with respect to any reference\nframe.\n", "  The symmetry requirement and the origin of magnetic orders coexisting with\nsuperconductivity have been strongly debated issues of iron-based\nsuperconductors (FeSCs). Observation of C$_4$-symmetric antiferromagnetism in\nviolation of the inter-band nesting condition of spin-density waves in\nsuperconducting ground state will require significant change in our\nunderstanding of the mechanism of FeSC. The superconducting material\nSr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs, a bulk version of monolayer FeSC in contact with a perovskite\nlayer with its magnetism (T$_N$ ~ 50 K) and superconductivity (T$_c$ ~ 37 K)\ncoexisting at parent state, has no reported structural orthorhombic distortion\nand thus makes a perfect system to look for theoretically expected C$_4$\nmagnetisms. Based on variable temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (SPSTM) with newly discovered imaging mechanism that removes the\nstatic surface reconstruction (SR) pattern by fluctuating it rapidly with\nspin-polarized tunneling current, we could visualize underlying C$_4$ symmetric\n(2$\\times$2) magnetic domains and its phase domain walls. We find that this\nmagnetic order is perfectly consistent with the plaquette antiferromagnetic\norder in tetragonal Fe spin lattice expected from theories based on the\nHeisenberg exchange interaction of local Fe moments and the quantum order by\ndisorder. The inconsistency of its modulation Q vectors from the nesting\ncondition also implies that the nesting-based C$_2$ symmetric magnetism is not\na unique prerequisite of high-T$_c$ FeSC. Furthermore, the plaquette\nantiferromagnetic domain wall dynamics under the influence of small spin torque\neffect of spin-polarized tunneling current are shown to be consistent with\ntheoretical simulation based on the extended Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the magnetic moments and magnetic form\nfactors of the decuplet baryons to the next-to-next-leading order in the\nframework of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. Our calculation\nincludes the contributions from both the intermediate decuplet and octet baryon\nstates in the loops. We also calculate the charge and magnetic dipole form\nfactors of the decuplet baryons. Our results may be useful to the chiral\nextrapolation of the lattice simulations of the decuplet electromagnetic\nproperties.\n", "  We show that although the prominent centrality measures in network analysis\nmake use of different information about nodes' positions, they all process that\ninformation in a very restrictive and identical way. They all spring from a\ncommon family that are characterized by the same axioms. In particular, they\nare all based on a additively separable and linear treatment of a statistic\nthat captures a node's position in the network. Using such statistics on nodes'\npositions, we also characterize networks on which centrality measures all\nagree.\n", "  We present measurements of a combination of the decay constants of the light\npseudoscalar mesons and the gradient flow scale $t_0$, which allow to set the\nscale of the lattices generated by CLS with $2 + 1$ flavors of\nnon-perturbatively improved Wilson fermions. Mistunings of the quark masses are\ncorrected for by measuring the derivatives of observables with respect to the\nbare quark masses.\n", "  We analyze the resource overhead of recently proposed methods for universal\nfault-tolerant quantum computation using concatenated codes. Namely, we examine\nthe concatenation of the 7-qubit Steane code with the 15-qubit Reed-Muller\ncode, which allows for the construction of the 49 and 105-qubit codes that do\nnot require the need for magic state distillation for universality. We compute\na lower bound for the adversarial noise threshold of the 105-qubit code and\nfind it to be $8.33\\times 10^{-6}.$ We obtain a depolarizing noise threshold\nfor the 49-qubit code of $9.69\\times 10^{-4}$ which is competitive with the\n105-qubit threshold result of $1.28\\times 10^{-3}$. We then provide lower\nbounds on the resource requirements of the 49 and 105-qubit codes and compare\nthem with the surface code implementation of a logical $T$ gate using magic\nstate distillation. For the sampled input error rates and noise model, we find\nthat the surface code achieves a smaller overhead compared to our concatenated\nschemes.\n", "  ThCr2Si2-type Ru-based superconductors LaRu2P2 and LaRu2As2 with Tc ~ 4 K and\n7.8 K respectively have been reported very recently. Using the first principles\nmethod we investigate the details physical and superconducting properties\nincluding the structural properties, electronic properties, elastic properties\nand Thermodynamic properties of these newly discovered superconductors. Our\ninvestigated lattice parameters accord well with the experimental result. The\nanalysis of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) indicates\nthe metallic nature of both the compounds emerges from the La and Ru and the\nstudy of chemical bonding implies that a mixture of covalent, ionic and\nmetallic bonds exist in both the compounds. The study of the mechanical\nproperties revels that LaRu2P2 is brittle in nature while LaRu2As2 demonstrates\nthe ductile nature and both the compounds show anisotropic characteristics.\nFinally we determine the Debye temperature and details superconducting\nparameters indicating that both the compounds under study are phonon-mediated\nmedium coupled BCS superconductors.\n", "  We investigate the spacetime properties of BTZ black holes in the presence of\nthe Maxwell field and Born-Infeld field and find rich properties in the\nspacetime structures when the model parameters are varied. Employing the\nLandau-Lifshitz theory, we examine the thermodynamical phase transition in the\ncharged BTZ black holes. We further study the dynamical perturbation in the\nbackground of the charged BTZ black holes and find different properties in the\ndynamics when the thermodynamical phase transition occurs.\n", "  X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are the only sources currently able to\nproduce bright few-fs pulses with tunable photon energies from 100 eV to more\nthan 10 keV. Due to the stochastic SASE operating principles and other\ntechnical issues the output pulses are subject to large fluctuations, making it\nnecessary to characterize the x-ray pulses on every shot for data sorting\npurposes. We present a technique that applies machine learning tools to predict\nx-ray pulse properties using simple electron beam and x-ray parameters as\ninput. Using this technique at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), we\nreport mean errors below 0.3 eV for the prediction of the photon energy at 530\neV and below 1.6 fs for the prediction of the delay between two x-ray pulses.\nWe also demonstrate spectral shape prediction with a mean agreement of 97%.\nThis approach could potentially be used at the next generation of\nhigh-repetition-rate XFELs to provide accurate knowledge of complex x-ray\npulses at the full repetition rate.\n", "  Color centers in silicon carbide have increasingly attracted attention in\nrecent years owing to their excellent properties such as single photon\nemission, good photostability, and long spin coherence time even at room\ntemperature. As compared to diamond which is widely used for holding\nNitrogen-vacancy centers, SiC has the advantage in terms of large-scale,\nhigh-quality and low cost growth, as well as advanced fabrication technique in\noptoelectronics, leading to the prospects for large scale quantum engineering.\nIn this paper, we report experimental demonstration of the generation of\nnanoscale $V_{Si}$ single defect array through ion implantation without the\nneed of annealing. $V_{Si}$ defects are generated in pre-determined locations\nwith resolution of tens of nanometers. This can help in integrating $V_{Si}$\ndefects with the photonic structures which, in turn, can improve the emission\nand collection efficiency of $V_{Si}$ defects when it is used in spin photonic\nquantum network. On the other hand, the defects are shallow and they are\ngenerated $\\sim 40nm$ below the surface which can serve as critical resources\nin quantum sensing application.\n", "  Benchmark stars with known angular diameters are key to calibrating\ninterferometric observations. With the advent of optical interferometry, there\nis a need for suitably bright, well-vetted calibrator stars over a large\nportion of the sky. We present a catalog of uniformly computed angular\ndiameters for 1523 stars in the northern hemisphere brighter than V = 6 and\nwith declinations $-15^\\circ < \\delta < 82^\\circ$. The median angular stellar\ndiameter is 0.527 mas. The list has been carefully cleansed of all known binary\nand multiple stellar systems. We derive the angular diameters for each of the\nstars by fitting spectral templates to the observed spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) from literature fluxes. We compare these derived angular\ndiameters against those measured by optical interferometry for 75 of the stars,\nas well as to 176 diameter estimates from previous calibrator catalogs, finding\nin general excellent agreement. The final catalog includes our goodness-of-fit\nmetrics as well as an online atlas of our SED fits. The catalog presented here\npermits selection of the best calibrator stars for current and future\nvisible-light interferometric observations.\n", "  We report simultaneous conjugate Ramsey-Bord\\'e interferometers with a sample\nof low-mass (lithium-7) atoms at 50 times the recoil temperature. We optically\npump the atoms to a magnetically insensitive state using the $2S_{1/2} -\n2P_{1/2}$ line. Fast stimulated Raman beam splitters address a broad velocity\nclass and unavoidably drive two conjugate interferometers that overlap\nspatially. We show that detecting the summed interference signals of both\ninterferometers, using state labeling, allows recoil measurements and\nsuppression of phase noise from vibrations. The use of \"warm\" atoms allows for\nsimple, efficient, and high-flux atom sources and broadens the applicability of\nrecoil-sensitive interferometry to particles that remain difficult to trap and\ncool.\n", "  We show that the local observables of the curved beta gamma system encode the\nsheaf of chiral differential operators using the machinery of the book\n\"Factorization algebras in quantum field theory\", by Kevin Costello and the\nsecond author, which combines renormalization, the Batalin-Vilkovisky\nformalism, and factorization algebras. Our approach is in the spirit of\ndeformation quantization via Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry. We begin by\nconstructing a quantization of the beta gamma system with an n-dimensional\nformal disk as the target. There is an obstruction to quantizing equivariantly\nwith respect to the action of formal vector fields on the target disk, and it\nis naturally identified with the first Pontryagin class in Gelfand-Fuks\ncohomology. Any trivialization of the obstruction cocycle thus yields an\nequivariant quantization with respect to an extension of formal vector fields\nby the closed 2-forms on the disk. By results in the book listed above, we then\nnaturally obtain a factorization algebra of quantum observables, which has an\nassociated vertex algebra easily identified with the formal beta gamma vertex\nalgebra. Next, we introduce a version of Gelfand-Kazhdan formal geometry\nsuitable for factorization algebras, and we verify that for a complex manifold\nwith trivialized first Pontryagin class, the associated factorization algebra\nrecovers the vertex algebra of CDOs on the complex manifold.\n", "  We analyze the role of spectral diffusion in the problem of many-body\ndelocalization in quantum dots and in extended systems. The spectral diffusion\nparametrically enhances delocalization, modifying the scaling of the\ndelocalization threshold with the interaction coupling constant.\n", "  This paper presents a comprehensive review of the wave-function approach for\nderivation of the number-resolved Master equations, used for description of\ntransport and measurement in mesoscopic systems. The review contains important\namendments, clarifying subtle points in derivation of the Master equations and\ntheir validity. This completes the earlier works on the subject. It is\ndemonstrated that the derivation does not assume weak coupling with the\nenvironment and reservoirs, but needs only high bias condition. This condition\nis very essential for validity of the Markovian Master equations, widely used\nfor a phenomenological description of different physical processes.\n", "  The linearization of a type of $f(R)$ gravity is studied directly in the\nhigher-order frame for an arbitrary five-dimensional warped space-time\nbackground. The quadratic actions of the normal modes of the scalar, vector,\nand tensor perturbations are derived by taking the curvature gauge, under which\nthe linear perturbation of the scalar curvature is zero, and all the\nperturbation equations reduce to second order. By comparing our results to\nthose obtained in the Einstein frame, we find that the quadratic actions of the\nnormal modes are equivalent for these two frames.\n", "  We present an estimation of the average velocity of a network of global\nmonopoles in a cosmological setting using large numerical simulations. In order\nto obtain the value of the velocity, we improve some already known methods, and\npresent a new one. This new method estimates individual global monopole\nvelocities in a network, by means of detecting each monopole position in the\nlattice and following the path described by each one of them. Using our new\nestimate we can settle an open question previously posed in the literature:\nvelocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) models for global monopoles predict two\nbranches of scaling solutions, one with monopoles moving at subluminal speeds\nand one with monopoles moving at luminal speeds. Previous attempts to estimate\nmonopole velocities had large uncertainties and were not able to settle that\nquestion. Our simulations find no evidence of a luminal branch. We also\nestimate the values of the parameters of the VOS model. With our new method we\ncan also study the microphysics of the complicated dynamics of individual\nmonopoles. Finally we use our large simulation volume to compare the results\nfrom the different estimator methods, as well as to asses the validity of the\nnumerical approximations made.\n", "  We present the black hole accretion code (BHAC), a new multidimensional\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics module for the MPI-AMRVAC framework.\nBHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh\nrefinement techniques with an efficient block-based approach. Several\nspacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test\nproblems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the\ncase of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent\naccretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find\naccretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few\npercent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves\nthe study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed\nby means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The\nresulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to\nbe convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial\nrole in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming\nradio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall (QSH) system can exhibit exotic spin transport phenomena,\nmediated by its topological edge states. Here a novel concept of bending strain\nengineering to tune the spin transport properties of a QSH system is\ndemonstrated by both model and first-principles calculations. Interestingly, we\ndiscover that bending strain can be used to mitigate the spin conservation of a\nQSH system to generate a non-zero spin current (SC), meanwhile the preservation\nof time reversal symmetry renders its edge states topologically protected to\ntransport robust SC without back scattering. This novel physics mechanism can\nbe applied to effectively tune the SC and spin Hall current in a QSH system by\ncontrol of its bending curvature. Furthermore, the realization of QSH systems\nwith controllable curvature can be achieved by the concept of \"topological\nnanomechnical architecture\". Taking Bi/Cl/Si(111) as a material example, we\ndemonstrate that the relative spin orientations between two edge states of a\nBi/Cl/Si(111) film can indeed be tuned dramatically by its self-bending\nbehaviors induced by the pre-designed inherent strain. Therefore, this concept\nof \"bending strain engineering of spins\" via topological nanomechanical\narchitecture affords a promising route towards the realization of topological\nnano-mechanospintronics.\n", "  We solve the generalized relativistic harmonic oscillator in 1+1 dimensions\nin the presence of a minimal length. Using the momentum space representation,\nwe explore all the possible signs of the potentials and discuss their\nbound-state solutions for fermion and antifermions. Furthermore, we also find\nan isolated solution from the Sturm-Liouville scheme. All cases already\nanalyzed in the literature, are obtained as particular cases.\n", "  A system scheme is presented which allows non-reciprocal wave transmission or\ndirectional amplification of electromagnetic signals, using a boxed four-node\nmethod. Edges represent strong hopping interactions and diagonals stand for\nweak parametric interactions. Using careful optimization of values for design\nparameters, we are able to obtain non-reciprocity in excess of 12dB and 130dB\nfor intrinsic and extrinsic configurations at identical input/output\nfrequencies. For the directional amplification, an isolation as high as 40dB is\ndemonstrated with forward/backward gains of $\\pm$20dB. Cascading two such\nsystems potentially can offer high isolations at high gains.\n", "  We investigate the long-range interactions between two neutrons utilizing\nrecent data on the neutron static and dynamic electric and magnetic dipole\npolarizabilities. The resulting long-range potentials are used to make\nquantitative comparisons between the collisions of a neutron with a neutron and\na neutron with a proton. We also assess the importance of the first pion\nproduction threshold and first excited state of the nucleon, the\n$\\Delta$-resonance ($J^{\\pi}$ = + 3/2, I = 3/2). We found both dynamical\neffects to be quite relevant for distances r between ~ 50 fm up to ~$10^3$ fm\nin the nn system, the neutron-wall system and in the wall-neutron-wall system,\nreaching the expected asymptotic limit beyond that. Relevance of our findings\nto the confinement of ultra cold neutrons inside bottles is discussed.\n", "  In this paper we show how to obtain the heterotic double field theory from\nexceptional field theory by breaking half of the supersymmetry. We focus on the\n$\\mathrm{SL}(5)$ exceptional field theory and show that when the extended space\ncontains a generalised $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure manifold one can define a\nreduction to obtain the heterotic $\\mathrm{SO}(3,n)$ double field theory. In\nthis picture, the reduction on the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure breaks half of\nthe supersymmetry of the exceptional field theory and the gauge group of the\nheterotic double field theory is given by the embedding tensor of the reduction\nused. Finally, we study the example of a consistent truncation of M-theory on\nK3 and recover the duality with the heterotic string on $T^3$. This suggests\nthat the extended space can be made sense of even in the case of non-toroidal\ncompactifications.\n", "  Precise device characterization is a fundamental requirement for a large\nrange of applications using photonic hardware, and constitutes a\nmulti-parameter estimation problem. Estimates based on measurements using\nsingle photons or classical light have precision which is limited by\nshot-noise, while quantum resources can be used to achieve sub-shot-noise\nprecision. However, there are many open questions with regard to the best\nquantum protocols for multi-parameter estimation, including the ultimate limits\nto achievable precision, as well as optimal choices for probe states and\nmeasurements. In this paper, we develop a formalism based on Fisher information\nto tackle these questions for set-ups based on linear-optical components and\nphoton-counting measurements. A key ingredient of our analysis is a mapping for\nequivalent protocols defined for photonic and spin systems, which allows us to\ndraw upon results in the literature for general finite-dimensional systems.\nMotivated by the protocol in X.-Q. Zhou, et al., Optica 2, 510 (2015), we\npresent new results for quantum-enhanced tomography of unitary processes,\nincluding a comparison of Holland-Burnett and NOON probe states.\n", "  Precise knowledge of a quantum system's Hamiltonian is a critical\npre-requisite for its use in many quantum information technologies. Here, we\nreport a method for the precise characterization of the non-secular part of the\nexcited-state Hamiltonian of an electronic-nuclear spin system in diamond. The\nmethod relies on the investigation of the dynamic nuclear polarization mediated\nby the electronic spin, which is currently exploited as a primary tool for\ninitializing nuclear qubits and performing enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance.\nBy measuring the temporal evolution of the population of the ground-state\nhyperfine levels of a nitrogen-vacancy center, we obtain the first direct\nestimation of the excited-state transverse hyperfine coupling between its\nelectronic and nitrogen nuclear spin. Our method could also be applied to other\nelectron-nuclear spin systems, such as those related to defects in silicon\ncarbide.\n", "  We investigate the origin of imperfections in the fidelity of a two-photon\ncontrolled-phase gate based on two-level-emitter non-linearities. We focus on a\npassive system that operates without external modulations to enhance its\nperformance. We demonstrate that the fidelity of the gate is limited by\nopposing requirements on the input pulse width for one- and two-photon\nscattering events. For one-photon scattering, the spectral pulse width must be\nnarrow compared to the emitter linewidth, while two-photon scattering processes\nrequire the pulse width and emitter linewidth to be comparable. We find that\nthese opposing requirements limit the maximum fidelity of the two-photon\ncontrolled-phase gate for Gaussian photon pulses to 84%.\n", "  A simulation study of measurements of neutral current structure functions of\nthe nucleon at the future high-energy and high-luminosity polarized\nelectron-ion collider (EIC) is presented. A new series of $\\gamma-Z$\ninterference structure functions, $F_1^{\\gamma Z}$, $F_3^{\\gamma Z}$,\n$g_1^{\\gamma Z}$, $g_5^{\\gamma Z}$ become accessible via parity-violating\nasymmetries in polarized electron-nucleon deep inelastic scattering (DIS).\nWithin the context of the quark-parton model, they provide a unique and, in\nsome cases, yet-unmeasured combination of unpolarized and polarized parton\ndistribution functions. The uncertainty projections for these structure\nfunctions using electron-proton collisions are considered for various EIC beam\nenergy configurations. Also presented are uncertainty projections for\nmeasurements of the weak mixing angle $\\sin^2 \\theta_W$ using electron-deuteron\ncollisions which cover a much higher $Q^2$ than that is accessible in fixed\ntarget measurements. QED and QCD radiative corrections and effects of detector\nsmearing are included with the calculations.\n", "  Optical isolation, non-reciprocal phase transmission and topological phases\nfor light based on synthetic gauge fields have been raising significant\ninterest in the recent literature. Cavity-optomechanical systems that involve\ntwo optical modes coupled to a common mechanical mode form an ideal platform to\nrealize these effects, providing the basis for various recent demonstrations of\noptomechanically induced non-reciprocal light transmission. Here, we establish\na unifying theoretical framework to analyze optical non-reciprocity and\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry in multimode optomechanical systems. We\nhighlight two general scenarios to achieve isolation, relying on either optical\nor mechanical losses. Depending on the loss mechanism, our theory defines the\nultimate requirements for optimal isolation and the available operational\nbandwidth in these systems. We also analyze the effect of sideband resolution\non the performance of optomechanical isolators, highlighting the fact that\nnon-reciprocity can be preserved even in the unresolved sideband regime. Our\nresults provide general insights into a broad class of parametrically modulated\nnon-reciprocal devices, paving the way towards optimal non-reciprocal systems\nfor low-noise integrated nanophotonics.\n", "  We review the realization of Starobinsky-type inflation within\ninduced-gravity Supersymmetric (SUSY) and non-SUSY models. In both cases,\ninflation is in agreement with the current data and can be attained for\nsubplanckian values of the inflaton. The corresponding effective theories\nretain perturbative unitarity up to the Planck scale and the inflaton mass is\npredicted to be 3x10^13 GeV. The supergravity embedding of these models is\nachieved by employing two gauge singlet chiral supefields, a superpotential\nthat is uniquely determined by a continuous R and a discrete Zn symmetry, and\nseveral (semi)logarithmic Kaehler potentials that respect these symmetries.\nChecking various functional forms for the non-inflaton accompanying field in\nthe Kaehler potentials, we identify four cases which stabilize it without\ninvoking higher order terms.\n", "  We present synthetic observations for the first generations of galaxies in\nthe Universe and make predictions for future deep field observations for\nredshifts greater than 6. Due to the strong impact of nebular emission lines\nand the relatively compact scale of HII regions, high resolution cosmological\nsimulations and a robust suite of analysis tools are required to properly\nsimulate spectra. We created a software pipeline consisting of FSPS, Hyperion,\nCloudy and our own tools to generate synthetic IR observations from a fully\nthree-dimensional arrangement of gas, dust, and stars. Our prescription allows\nus to include emission lines for a complete chemical network and tackle the\neffect of dust extinction and scattering in the various lines of sight. We\nprovide spectra, 2-D binned photon imagery for both HST and JWST IR filters,\nluminosity relationships, and emission line strengths for a large sample of\nhigh redshift galaxies in the Renaissance Simulations. Our resulting synthetic\nspectra show high variability between galactic halos with a strong dependence\non stellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction, and formation history. Halos\nwith the lowest stellar mass have the greatest variability in [OIII]/H$\\beta$,\n[OIII] and CIII] while halos with higher masses are seen to show consistency in\ntheir spectra and [OIII] equivalent widths (EW) between 1\\AA\\ and 10\\AA.\nViewing angle accounted for three-fold difference in flux due to the presence\nof ionized gas channels in a halo. Furthermore, JWST color plots show a\ndiscernible relationship between redshift, color, and mean stellar age.\n", "  We examine dense self-gravitating stellar systems dominated by a central\npotential, such as nuclear star clusters hosting a central supermassive black\nhole. Different dynamical properties of these systems evolve on vastly\ndifferent timescales. In particular, the orbital-plane orientations are\ntypically driven into internal thermodynamic equilibrium by vector resonant\nrelaxation before the orbital eccentricities or semimajor axes relax. We show\nthat the statistical mechanics of such systems exhibit a striking resemblance\nto liquid crystals, with analogous ordered-nematic and disordered-isotropic\nphases. The ordered phase consists of bodies orbiting in a disk in both\ndirections, with the disk thickness depending on temperature, while the\ndisordered phase corresponds to a nearly isotropic distribution of the orbit\nnormals. We show that below a critical value of the total angular momentum, the\nsystem undergoes a first-order phase transition between the ordered and\ndisordered phases. At the critical point the phase transition becomes\nsecond-order while for higher angular momenta there is a smooth crossover. We\nalso find metastable equilibria containing two identical disks with mutual\ninclinations between $90^{\\circ}$ and $180^\\circ$.\n", "  The statistical distribution of galaxies is a powerful probe to constrain\ncosmological models and gravity. In particular the matter power spectrum $P(k)$\nbrings information about the cosmological distance evolution and the galaxy\nclustering together. However the building of $P(k)$ from galaxy catalogues\nneeds a cosmological model to convert angles on the sky and redshifts into\ndistances, which leads to difficulties when comparing data with predicted\n$P(k)$ from other cosmological models, and for photometric surveys like LSST.\nThe angular power spectrum $C_\\ell(z_1,z_2)$ between two bins located at\nredshift $z_1$ and $z_2$ contains the same information than the matter power\nspectrum, is free from any cosmological assumption, but the prediction of\n$C_\\ell(z_1,z_2)$ from $P(k)$ is a costly computation when performed exactly.\nThe Angpow software aims at computing quickly and accurately the auto\n($z_1=z_2$) and cross ($z_1 \\neq z_2$) angular power spectra between redshift\nbins. We describe the developed algorithm, based on developments on the\nChebyshev polynomial basis and on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature method. We\nvalidate the results with other codes, and benchmark the performance. Angpow is\nflexible and can handle any user defined power spectra, transfer functions, and\nredshift selection windows. The code is fast enough to be embedded inside\nprograms exploring large cosmological parameter spaces through the\n$C_\\ell(z_1,z_2)$ comparison with data. We emphasize that the Limber's\napproximation, often used to fasten the computation, gives wrong $C_\\ell$\nvalues for cross-correlations.\n", "  Proteins are biological polymers that underlie all cellular functions. The\nfirst high-resolution protein structures were determined by x-ray\ncrystallography in the 1960s. Since then, there has been continued interest in\nunderstanding and predicting protein structure and stability. It is\nwell-established that a large contribution to protein stability originates from\nthe sequestration from solvent of hydrophobic residues in the protein core. How\nare such hydrophobic residues arranged in the core? And how can one best model\nthe packing of these residues? Here we show that to properly model the packing\nof residues in protein cores it is essential that amino acids are represented\nby appropriately calibrated atom sizes, and that hydrogen atoms are explicitly\nincluded. We show that protein cores possess a packing fraction of $\\phi\n\\approx 0.56$, which is significantly less than the typically quoted value of\n0.74 obtained using the extended atom representation. We also compare the\nresults for the packing of amino acids in protein cores to results obtained for\njammed packings from disrete element simulations composed of spheres, elongated\nparticles, and particles with bumpy surfaces. We show that amino acids in\nprotein cores pack as densely as disordered jammed packings of particles with\nsimilar values for the aspect ratio and bumpiness as found for amino acids.\nKnowing the structural properties of protein cores is of both fundamental and\npractical importance. Practically, it enables the assessment of changes in the\nstructure and stability of proteins arising from amino acid mutations (such as\nthose identified as a result of the massive human genome sequencing efforts)\nand the design of new folded, stable proteins and protein-protein interactions\nwith tunable specificity and affinity.\n", "  Measurements of element abundances in galaxies from astrophysical\nspectroscopy depend sensitively on the atomic data used. With the goal of\nmaking the latest atomic data accessible to the community, we present a\ncompilation of selected atomic data for resonant absorption lines at\nwavelengths longward of 911.753 {\\AA} (the \\ion{H}{1} Lyman limit), for key\nheavy elements (heavier than atomic number 5) of astrophysical interest. In\nparticular, we focus on the transitions of those ions that have been observed\nin the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM), the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of\nthe Milky Way and/or other galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM).\n  We provide wavelengths, oscillator strengths, associated accuracy grades, and\nreferences to the oscillator strength determinations. We also attempt to\ncompare and assess the recent oscillator strength determinations. For about\n22\\% of the lines that have updated oscillator strength values, the differences\nbetween the former values and the updated ones are $\\gtrsim$~0.1 dex.\n  Our compilation will be a useful resource for absorption line studies of the\nISM, as well as studies of the CGM and IGM traced by sight lines to quasars and\ngamma-ray bursts. Studies (including those enabled by future generations of\nextremely large telescopes) of absorption by galaxies against the light of\nbackground galaxies will also benefit from our compilation.\n", "  Thermodynamical properties of black holes in gravitational theories without\nLocal Lorentz invariance have been subject to intense investigation in the past\nyears due to the presence of universal horizons, which are strong causal\nbarriers even for superluminal signals. Here we present a novel general method\nfor deriving the Smarr formula for this class of theories: in particular we\nshow that the Smarr formulae for Einstein-Aether theory and infrared Horava\ngravity follow from scale invariance. We not only reproduce straightforwardly\nprevious findings for static black hole solutions, but we are also able to\ngeneralise them to the case of stationary rotating black holes. Finally, we\napply our results to the rotating black holes with universal horizon as found\nin three dimensions, from which we shall draw some lessons on the viability of\nblack hole thermodynamics for black hole solutions endowed with universal\nhorizons.\n", "  We prove the Wegner bounds for the one-dimensional interacting multi-particle\nAnderson models in the continuum. The results apply to singular probability\ndistribution functions such as the Bernoulli's measures. The proofs need the\namplitude of the inter-particle interaction potential to be sufficiently weak.\nAs a consequence, the results imply the Anderson localization via the\nmulti-scale analysis.\n", "  We study the entanglement entropy and particle number cumulants for a system\nof disordered noninteracting fermions in $d$ dimensions. We show, both\nanalytically and numerically, that for a weak disorder the entanglement entropy\nand the second cumulant (particle number variance) are proportional to each\nother with a universal coefficient. The corresponding expressions are analogous\nto those in the clean case but with a logarithmic factor regularized by the\nmean free path rather than by the system size. We also determine the scaling of\nhigher cumulants by analytical (weak disorder) and numerical means. Finally, we\npredict that the particle number variance and the entanglement entropy are\nnonanalytic functions of disorder at the Anderson transition.\n", "  The experiment was conducted to synthesize carbon nanospheres of different\nsizes by controlling the temperature in polycondensation reaction of glucose\nunder hydrothermal process. The surface morphology, structural, optical, and\nthermal properties of as synthesized particles were characterized using TEM,\nSEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, and DSC. The particles morphology and\ndispersity were modified and reduced their size after calcination at $500^{o}\nC$ in comparison to those without calcinated. Thermal study also indicates\nparticles change their phase from amorphous to crystalline and achieve thermal\nstability after $520^{o}C$, which can also be verified by presence of D-band\nand G-band in Raman spectrum. Overall results indicate that the carbon\nnanospheres are hard solids and highly dispersed with size ranges from 50 nm to\n300 nm.\n", "  We present a brief review on integrability of multispecies zero range process\nin one dimension introduced recently. The topics range over stochastic $R$\nmatrices of quantum affine algebra $U_q (A^{(1)}_n)$, matrix product\nconstruction of stationary states for periodic systems, $q$-boson\nrepresentation of Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra, etc. We also introduce new\ncommuting Markov transfer matrices having a mixed boundary condition and prove\nthe factorization of a family of $R$ matrices associated with the tetrahedron\nequation and generalized quantum groups at a special point of the spectral\nparameter.\n", "  I present the reconstruction of the involvement of Karl Popper in the\ncommunity of physicists concerned with foundations of quantum mechanics, in the\n1980s. At that time Popper gave active contribution to the research in physics,\nof which the most significant is a new version of the EPR thought experiment,\nalleged to test different interpretations of quantum mechanics. The genesis of\nsuch an experiment is reconstructed in detail, and an unpublished letter by\nPopper is reproduced in the present paper to show that he formulated his\nthought experiment already two years before its first publication in 1982. The\ndebate stimulated by the proposed experiment as well as Popper's role in the\nphysics community throughout 1980s is here analysed in detail by means of\npersonal correspondence and publications.\n", "  For models in which dark matter annihilation is Sommerfeld-enhanced, the\nannihilation cross section increases at low relative velocities. Dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have low characteristic dark matter particle\nvelocities and are thus ideal candidates to study such models. In this paper we\nmodel the dark matter phase space of dSphs as isotropic and\nspherically-symmetric, and determine the $J$-factors for several of the most\nimportant targets for indirect dark matter searches. For Navarro-Frenk-White\ndensity profiles, we quantify the scatter in the $J$-factor arising from the\nastrophysical uncertainty in the dark matter potential. We show that, in\nSommerfeld-enhanced models, the ordering of the most promising dSphs may be\ndifferent relative to the standard case of velocity-independent cross sections.\nThis result can have important implications for derived upper limits on the\nannihilation cross section, or on possible signals, from dSphs.\n", "  The invariant differential cross sections for inclusive $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$\nmesons at midrapidity were measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV for\ntransverse momenta $0.4<p_{\\rm T}<40$ GeV/$c$ and $0.6<p_{\\rm T}<20$ GeV/$c$,\nrespectively, using the ALICE detector. This large range in $p_{\\rm T}$ was\nachieved by combining various analysis techniques and different triggers\ninvolving the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal). In particular, a new\nsingle-cluster, shower-shape based method was developed for the identification\nof high-$p_{\\rm T}$ neutral pions, which exploits that the showers originating\nfrom their decay photons overlap in the EMCal. The measured cross sections are\nfound to exhibit a similar power-law behavior with an exponent of about $6.3$.\nNext-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations differ from the measured\ncross sections by about $30$% for the $\\pi^0$, and between $30$-$50$% for the\n$\\eta$ meson, while generator-level simulations with PYTHIA 8.2 describe the\ndata to better than $10$-$30$%, except at $p_{\\rm T}<1$ GeV/$c$. The new data\ncan therefore be used to further improve the theoretical description of\n$\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ meson production.\n", "  The production of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in p-Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{{\\textit s}_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV was studied for $2 < p_{\\rm T} < 16$\nGeV/$c$ with the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC. The measurement was performed\nat forward (p-going direction) and backward (Pb-going direction) rapidity, in\nthe ranges of rapidity in the center-of-mass system (cms) $2.03<y_{\\rm\ncms}<3.53$ and $-4.46<y_{\\rm cms}<-2.96$, respectively. The production cross\nsections and nuclear modification factors are presented as a function of\ntransverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$). At forward rapidity, the nuclear\nmodification factor is compatible with unity while at backward rapidity, in the\ninterval $2.5<p_{\\rm T}<3.5$ GeV/$c$, it is above unity by more than 2$\\sigma$.\nThe ratio of the forward-to-backward production cross sections is also measured\nin the overlapping interval $2.96 < \\vert y_{\\rm cms} \\vert < 3.53$ and is\nsmaller than unity by 3.7$\\sigma$ in $2.5<p_{\\rm T}<3.5$ GeV/$c$. The data are\ndescribed by model calculations including cold nuclear matter effects.\n", "  We argue that the Hamiltonians for A_{2n}^(2) open quantum spin chains\ncorresponding to two choices of integrable boundary conditions have the\nsymmetries U_q(B_n) and U_q(C_n), respectively. We find a formula for the\nDynkin labels of the Bethe states (which determine the degeneracies of the\ncorresponding eigenvalues) in terms of the numbers of Bethe roots of each type.\nWith the help of this formula, we verify numerically (for a generic value of\nthe anisotropy parameter) that the degeneracies and multiplicities of the\nspectra implied by the quantum group symmetries are completely described by the\nBethe ansatz.\n", "  We investigate the lower bounds of sfermion masses from the constraints of\nchromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) in the natural SUSY-type sfermion mass\nspectrum, in which stop mass $m_{\\tilde t}$ is much smaller than the other\nsfermion masses $m_0$. The natural SUSY-type sfermion mass spectrum has been\nstudied since the supersymmetric (SUSY) flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC)\nare suppressed because of large sfermion masses of the first two generations,\nand the weak scale is stabilized because of the light stop. However, this type\nof sfermion mass spectrum is severely constrained by CEDM, because the light\nstop contributions to the up quark CEDM are not decoupled in the limit\n$m_0\\rightarrow\\infty$, while the down quark CEDM is decoupled in the limit. It\nis important that the constraints are severe even if SUSY-breaking parameters\n(and Higgsino mass) are taken to be real because complex diagonalizing matrices\nof Yukawa matrices, which are from complex Yukawa couplings, generate\nnonvanishing CP phases in off-diagonal elements of sfermion mass matrices. We\ncalculate the CEDM of up and down quarks numerically in the minimal SUSY\nstandard model, and give the lower bounds for stop mass and the other sfermion\nmasses. We show that the lower bound of stop mass becomes 7 TeV to satisfy the\nCEDM constraints from Hg EDM. The result is not acceptable if the weak scale\nstability is considered seriously. We show that if the up-type Yukawa couplings\nare taken to be real at the grand unification scale, the CEDM constraints are\nsatisfied even if $m_{\\tilde t}\\sim 1$ TeV.\n", "  Concepts and tools from network theory, the so-called Lagrangian Flow Network\nframework, have been successfully used to obtain a coarse-grained description\nof transport by closed fluid flows. Here we explore the application of this\nmethodology to open chaotic flows, and check it with numerical results for a\nmodel open flow, namely a jet with a localized wave perturbation. We find that\nnetwork nodes with high values of out-degree and of finite-time entropy in the\nforward-in-time direction identify the location of the chaotic saddle and its\nstable manifold, whereas nodes with high in-degree and backwards finite-time\nentropy highlight the location of the saddle and its unstable manifold. The\ncyclic clustering coefficient, associated to the presence of periodic orbits,\ntakes non-vanishing values at the location of the saddle itself.\n", "  Students face diverse pathways as they journey through undergraduate study.\nThe analysis of student course records can untangle common patterns in course\nprogression, and identify group trends in student outcomes. The current work\nexamines the relationship between gender and undergraduate physics study, using\ncourse records from over nine thousand students who enrolled in physics at the\nUniversity of Auckland, spanning a six year period.\n  Physics students' demographic and course records were analyzed to find out\nwhether there were gender differences in subject selection, course performance,\nand confidence. Subsequent to taking a first year physics course, female\nstudents were more likely to take further courses in life science subjects,\nwhile male students were more likely to take physical science subjects. In\nfirst year courses, gender differences were not present among highly\nacademically prepared students, for whom school type (single-sex or\ncoeducational) was a better predictor of course outcome. However, of those\nstudents who were less academically prepared in their first year, male students\ntended to outperform female students. Female students were also more likely to\ntake an introductory physics course before an advancing course, compared to\nmale students, after controlling for academic preparation. Science capital, a\nconcept related to Pierre Bourdieu's notions of capital and habitus, was\nemployed as an interpretive research framework. Habitus, the system of\ndispositions one uses to interpret the world, is largely influenced by the\nsocio-cultural context in which an individual builds their identity. The\nfollowing study explains how an interaction between science capital and an\nindividual's habitus may lead to gender disparities in student outcomes in the\nfield of physics.\n", "  In this paper, we study a model of opinion dynamics in a social network in\nthe presence increasing interpersonal influence, i.e., increasing peer\npressure. Each agent in the social network has a distinct social stress\nfunction given by a weighted sum of internal and external behavioral pressures.\nWe assume a weighted average update rule and prove conditions under which a\nconnected group of agents converge to a fixed opinion distribution, and under\nwhich conditions the group reaches consensus. We show that the update rule is a\ngradient descent and explain its transient and asymptotic convergence\nproperties. Through simulation, we study the rate of convergence on a\nscale-free network and then validate the assumption of increasing peer pressure\nin a simple empirical model.\n", "  The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong $CP$ problem requires an\nanomalous global $U(1)$ symmetry, the PQ symmetry. The origin of such a\nconvenient global symmetry is quite puzzling from the theoretical point of view\nin many aspects. In this paper, we propose a simple prescription which provides\nan origin of the PQ symmetry. There, the global $U(1)$ PQ symmetry is virtually\nembedded in a gauged $U(1)$ PQ symmetry. Due to its simplicity, this mechanism\ncan be implemented in many conventional models with the PQ symmetry.\n", "  GISAXS is often used as a versatile tool for the contactless and\ndestruction-free investigation of nanostructured surfaces. However, due to the\nshallow incidence angles, the footprint of the X-ray beam is significantly\nelongated, limiting GISAXS to samples with typical target lengths of several\nmillimetres. For many potential applications, the production of large target\nareas is impractical, and the targets are surrounded by structured areas.\nBecause the beam footprint is larger than the targets, the surrounding\nstructures contribute parasitic scattering, burying the target signal. In this\npaper, GISAXS measurements of isolated as well as surrounded grating targets in\nSi substrates with line lengths from $50\\,{\\rm\\mu m}$ down to $4\\,{\\rm\\mu m}$\nare presented. For the isolated grating targets, the changes in the scattering\npatterns due to the reduced target length are explained. For the surrounded\ngrating targets, the scattering signal of a $15\\,{\\rm\\mu\nm}\\,\\times\\,15\\,{\\rm\\mu m}$ target grating structure is separated from the\nscattering signal of $100\\,{\\rm\\mu m}\\,\\times\\,100\\,{\\rm\\mu m}$ nanostructured\nsurroundings by producing the target with a different orientation with respect\nto the predominant direction of the surrounding structures. The described\ntechnique allows to apply GISAXS, e.g. for characterization of metrology fields\nin the semiconductor industry, where up to now it has been considered\nimpossible to use this method due to the large beam footprint.\n", "  In this paper we study a mixed system of bosons and fermions with up to six\nparticles in total. All particles are assumed to have the same mass. The\ntwo-body interactions are repulsive and are assumed to have equal strength in\nboth the Bose-Bose and the Fermi-Boson channels. The particles are confined\nexternally by a harmonic oscillator one-body potential. For the case of four\nparticles, two identical fermions and two identical bosons, we focus on the\nstrongly interacting regime and analyze the system using both an analytical\napproach and DMRG calculations using a discrete version of the underlying\ncontinuum Hamiltonian. This provides us with insight into both the ground state\nand the manifold of excited states that are almost degenerate for large\ninteraction strength. Our results show great variation in the density profiles\nfor bosons and fermions in different states for strongly interacting mixtures.\nBy moving to slightly larger systems, we find that the ground state of balanced\nmixtures of four to six particles tends to separate bosons and fermions for\nstrong (repulsive) interactions. On the other hand, in imbalanced Bose-Fermi\nmixtures we find pronounced odd-even effects in systems of five particles.\nThese few-body results suggest that question of phase separation in\none-dimensional confined mixtures are very sensitive to system composition,\nboth for the ground state and the excited states.\n", "  We consider coherent feedback control of quantum transport and focus on the\napplication of simple controllers and the effects of a finite bias voltage. We\nshow that simple single-parameter controllers can give rise to a range of\nuseful effects such as amplification of changes in plant transmission,\nincreased resolution of energy filtration, and the detection of differences\nbetween otherwise indistinguishable plants. We explore how these effects are\nimpacted by the phase-averaging effects associated with the application of a\nfinite bias and identify important voltage scales for the maintenance of the\nfunctionalities achieved through feedback control.\n", "  In this work, we present a method for targeted, maskless, and scalable\nfabrication of single silicon vacancy (VSi) defect arrays in silicon carbide\n(SiC) using focused ion beam. The resolution of implanted VSi defects is\nlimited to a few tens of nanometers, defined by the diameter of the ion beam.\nFirstly, we studied the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and optically detected\nmagnetic resonance (ODMR) of the generated defect spin ensemble, confirming\nthat the synthesized centers were in the desired defect state. Then we\ninvestigated the fluorescence properties of single VSi defects and our\nmeasurements indicate the presence of a photostable single photon source.\nFinally, we find that the Si++ ion to VSi defect conversion yield increases as\nthe implanted dose decreases. The reliable production of VSi defects in silicon\ncarbide could pave the way for its applications in quantum photonics and\nquantum information processing.\n", "  I study the process of dark matter capture by the Sun, under the assumption\nof a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), in the framework of\nnon-relativistic effective field theory. Hypothetically, WIMPs from the\ngalactic halo can scatter against atomic nuclei in the solar interior, settle\nto thermal equilibrium with the solar core and annihilate to produce an\nobservable flux of neutrinos. In particular, I examine the thermalization\nprocess using Monte-Carlo integration of WIMP trajectories. I consider WIMPs in\na mass range of 10--1000 GeV and WIMP-nucleon interaction operators with\ndifferent dependence on spin and transferred momentum. I find that the density\nprofiles of captured WIMPs are in accordance with a thermal profile described\nby the Sun's gravitational potential and core temperature. Depending on the\noperator that governs the interaction, the majority of the thermalization time\nis spent in either the solar interior or exterior. If normalizing the\nWIMP-nuclei interaction strength to a specific capture rate, I find that the\nthermalization time differs at most by 3 orders of magnitude between operators.\nIn most cases of interest, the thermalization time is many orders of magnitude\nshorter than the age of the solar system.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for producing new, light, hidden states at a\nfuture $e^+ e^-$ collider in a Higgsed dark $U(1)_D$ model, which we call the\nDouble Dark Portal model. The simultaneous presence of both vector and scalar\nportal couplings immediately modifies the Standard Model Higgsstrahlung\nchannel, $e^+ e^- \\to Zh$, at leading order in each coupling. In addition, each\nportal leads to complementary signals which can be probed at direct and\nindirect detection dark matter experiments. After accounting for current\nconstraints from LEP and LHC, we demonstrate that a future $e^+ e^-$ Higgs\nfactory will have unique and leading sensitivity to the two portal couplings by\nstudying a host of new production, decay, and radiative return processes.\nBesides the possibility of exotic Higgs decays, we highlight the importance of\ndirect dark vector and dark scalar production at $e^+ e^-$ machines, whose\ninvisible decays can be tagged from the recoil mass method.\n", "  We consider inflationary magnetogenesis where the conformal symmetry is\nbroken by the term $f^2(\\phi) F_{\\alpha\\beta} F^{\\alpha\\beta}$. We assume that\nthe magnetic field power spectrum today between 0.1 and $10^4$ Mpc is a power\nlaw, with upper and lower limits from observation. This fixes $f$ to be close\nto a power law in conformal time in the window during inflation when the modes\nobserved today are generated. In contrast to previous work, we do not make any\nassumptions about the form of $f$ outside these scales. We cover all possible\nreheating histories, described by an average equation of state $-1/3 <\\bar{w}\n<1$. Requiring that strong coupling and large backreaction are avoided both at\nthe background and perturbative level, we find the bound $\\delta_{B_0} < 5\n\\times10^{-15} \\left( \\frac{r}{0.07} \\right)^{1/2} \\kappa \\mathrm{G}$ for the\nmagnetic field generated by inflation, where $r$ is the tensor-to-scalar ratio\nand $\\kappa$ is a constant related to the form of $f$. This estimate has an\nuncertainty of one order of magnitude related to our approximations. The\nparameter $\\kappa$ is $<100$, and values $\\gtrsim1$ require a highly fine-tuned\nform of $f$; typical values are orders of magnitude smaller.\n", "  Experimentally observed X-ray and neutron emissions by acoustic perturbations\nof liquids and solids look paradoxical. All acoustically driven effects are\nextremely adiabatic with respect to typical times $\\hbar/1keV\\sim 10^{-18}s$\nfor X-ray and $\\hbar/1MeV\\sim 10^{-21}s$ for neutron processes. A direct\napplication of this mechanism would result in negligible (exponentially small)\nemission probabilities. As argued in this paper, high energy process of X-ray\nand neutron emissions are caused by electron transitions in deep ($\\sim 1MeV$)\nand narrow ($\\sim 10^{-11}cm$) anomalous well created by the local reduction of\nelectromagnetic zero point energy. The formation of anomalous states cannot be\ndescribed solely by quantum electrodynamics since the mechanism of electron\nmass generation is involved.\n", "  We perform a full amplitude analysis of the process $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi D \\bar{D}$, where $D$ refers to either $D^0$ or $D^+$. A new\ncharmoniumlike state $X^*(3860)$ that decays to $D \\bar{D}$ is observed with a\nsignificance of $6.5\\sigma$. Its mass is ($3862^{+26}_{-32}{}^{+40}_{-13}$)\nMeV/$c^2$ and width is ($201^{+154}_{-67}{}^{+88}_{-82}$) MeV. The\n$J^{PC}=0^{++}$ hypothesis is favored over the $2^{++}$ hypothesis at the level\nof $2.5\\sigma$. The analysis is based on the 980 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ data sample\ncollected by the Belle detector at the asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider\nKEKB.\n", "  The real Scarf II potential is discussed as a radial problem. This potential\nhas been studied extensively as a one-dimensional problem, and now these\nresults are used to construct its bound and resonance solutions for $l=0$ by\nsetting the origin at some arbitrary value of the coordinate. The solutions\nwith appropriate boundary conditions are composed as the linear combination of\nthe two independent solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation. The asymptotic\nexpression of these solutions is used to construct the $S_0(k)$ s-wave\n$S$-matrix, the poles of which supply the $k$ values corresponding to the\nbound, resonance and anti-bound solutions. The location of the discrete energy\neigenvalues is analyzed, and the relation of the solutions of the radial and\none-dimensional Scarf II potentials is discussed. It is shown that the\ngeneralized Woods--Saxon potential can be generated from the Rosen--Morse II\npotential in the same way as the radial Scarf II potential is obtained from its\none-dimensional correspondent. Based on this analogy, possible applications are\nalso pointed out.\n", "  Our research is related to the employment of photoplethysmography (PPG) and\nlaser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) techniques (measuring the blood volume and flux,\nrespectively) for the peripheral vascular system. We derive the governing\nequations of the wave dynamics for the case of extremely inhomogeneous\nparameters. We argue for the conjecture that the blood-vascular system as a\nwave-conducting medium should be nearly reflection-free. With the\nreflectionlessness condition, one can find the general solution to the\ngoverning equation and, on the basis of this solution, analyse the\nrelationships between PPG- and LDF-signals.\n", "  For well-stirred multiphase fluid systems the mean interface area per unit\nvolume, or \"specific interface area\" $S_V$, is a significant characteristic of\nthe system state. In particular, it is important for the dynamics of systems of\nimmiscible liquids experiencing interfacial boiling. We estimate the value of\nparameter $S_V$ as a function of the heat influx $\\dot{Q}_V$ to the system or\nthe average system overheat $\\langle\\Theta\\rangle$ above the interfacial\nboiling point. The derived results can be reformulated for the case of an\nendothermic chemical reaction between two liquid reagents with the gaseous form\nof one of the reaction products. The final results are restricted to the case\nof thin layers, where the potential gravitational energy of bubbles leaving the\ncontact interface is small compared to their surface tension energy.\n", "  We report on the dynamics of thermalization by extending a generalization of\nthe Caldeira-Leggett model, developed in the context of cold atomic gases\nconfined in a harmonic trap, to higher dimensions. Universal characteristics en\nroute to thermalization which appear to be independent of dimensionality are\nhighlighted, which additionally suggest a scaling analogous to turbulent mixing\nin fluid dynamics. We then focus on features dependent on dimensionality, with\nparticular regard to the role of angular momentum of the two atomic clouds,\nhaving in mind the goal of efficient thermalization between the two species.\nFinally, by considering asymmetry in species numbers, we find that nonlinear\ninter-species interactions provide a mode locking mechanism between the\nmajority and minority species, relevant to recent experiments involving\nFermi-Bose mixtures in the normal phase.\n", "  The spectra of 413 star-forming (or HII) regions in M33 (NGC 598) were\nobserved by using the multifiber spectrograph of Hectospec at the 6.5-m\nMultiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). By using this homogeneous spectra sample, we\nmeasured the intensities of emission lines and some physical parameters, such\nas electron temperatures, electron densities, and metallicities. Oxygen\nabundances were derived via the direct method (when available) and two\nempirical strong-line methods, namely, O3N2 and N2. In the high-metallicity\nend, oxygen abundances derived from O3N2 calibration were higher than those\nderived from N2 index, indicating an inconsistency between O3N2 and N2\ncalibrations. We presented a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of\ngas-phase oxygen abundances in M33 and confirmed the existence of the\naxisymmetric global metallicity distribution widely assumed in literature.\nLocal variations were also observed and subsequently associated with spiral\nstructures to provide evidence of radial migration driven by arms. Our O/H\ngradient fitted out to 1.1 $R_{25}$ resulted in slopes of $-0.17\\pm0.03$,\n$-0.19\\pm0.01$, and $-0.16\\pm0.17$ dex $R_{25}^{-1}$ utilizing abundances from\nO3N2, N2 diagnostics, and direct method, respectively.\n", "  We study the main options for a unitary and renormalizable, local quantum\nfield theory of the gravitational interactions. The first model is a Lee-Wick\nsuperrenormalizable higher-derivative gravity, formulated as a nonanalytically\nWick rotated Euclidean theory. We show that, under certain conditions, the $S$\nmatrix is unitary when the cosmological constant vanishes. The model is the\nsimplest of its class. However, infinitely many similar options are allowed,\nwhich raises the issue of uniqueness. To deal with this problem, we propose a\nnew quantization prescription, by doubling the unphysical poles of the\nhigher-derivative propagators and turning them into Lee-Wick poles. The\nLagrangian of the simplest theory of quantum gravity based on this idea is the\nlinear combination of $R$, $R_{\\mu \\nu }R^{\\mu \\nu }$, $R^{2}$ and the\ncosmological term. Only the graviton propagates in the cutting equations and,\nwhen the cosmological constant vanishes, the $S$ matrix is unitary. The theory\nsatisfies the locality of counterterms and is renormalizable by power counting.\nIt is unique in the sense that it is the only one with a dimensionless gauge\ncoupling.\n", "  Exact solutions for laminar stratified flows of Newtonian/non-Newtonian\nshear-thinning fluids in horizontal and inclined channels are presented. An\niterative algorithm is proposed to compute the laminar solution for the general\ncase of a Carreau non-Newtonian fluid. The exact solution is used to study the\neffect of the rheology of the shear-thinning liquid on two-phase flow\ncharacteristics considering both gas/liquid and liquid/liquid systems.\nConcurrent and counter-current inclined systems are investigated, including the\nmapping of multiple solution boundaries. Aspects relevant to practical\napplications are discussed, such as the insitu hold-up, or lubrication effects\nachieved by adding a less viscous phase. A characteristic of this family of\nsystems is that, even if the liquid has a complex rheology (Carreau fluid), the\ntwo-phase stratified flow can behave like the liquid is Newtonian for a wide\nrange of operational conditions. The capability of the two-fluid model to yield\nsatisfactory predictions in the presence of shear-thinning liquids is tested,\nand an algorithm is proposed to a priori predict if the Newtonian (zero shear\nrate viscosity) behaviour arises for a given operational conditions in order to\navoid large errors in the predictions of flow characteristics when the\npower-law is considered for modelling the shear-thinning behaviour. Two-fluid\nmodel closures implied by the exact solution and the effect of a turbulent gas\nlayer are also addressed.\n", "  Lattice dynamics in a sigma-Fe60V40 compound, which shows a re-entrant\nmagnetism and orders ferromagnetic ally at ca. 170K, was investigated with the\nMossbauer spectroscopy in the temperature interval of 5-300 K. Two relevant\nspectral parameters viz. the average center shift, <CS>, and the relative\nrecoil-free fraction, f/fo, were explored. The former yielded the Debye\ntemperature, T_D1, and the mean-square velocity of vibration, <v^2>, while the\nlatter T_D2 and the mean-square amplitude of vibrations, <x^2>. Significant\ndifferences in the lattice-dynamical behaviors in the magnetic and paramagnetic\nphases were revealed. In particular, the values of T_D were notably lower and\nthose of f/fo greatly higher in the former. This anomalous result has likely\nits origin in a remarkably high inharmonic contribution to the vibrations found\nfor the ground magnetic state (spin-glass). Especially anomalous behavior vs.\ntemperature exhibits <x^2> where four well defined ranges could have been\nidentified and ascribed to the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and two spin-glass\nphases. Linear correlations between <v^2>-<x^2> were found within each of the\nfour ranges. They enabled determination of force constants, hence a change of\nthe potential energy, Ep, in each of the ranges. The total change of Ep=30 meV\nwhile the corresponding one of the kinetic energy, determined from the\nknowledge of <v^2>, was Ek=21 meV. The lack of balance between Ep and Ek\nfollows from the anharmonic lattice-dynamical behavior observed in the\nspin-glass state. The results give a strong evidence that magnetism can\nsignificantly affect the lattice dynamics.\n", "  In order to meet its cutting-edge scientific objectives, the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) telescope requires high-precision frequency references to be\ndistributed to each of its antennas. The frequency references are distributed\nvia fiber-optic links and must be actively stabilized to compensate for\nphase-noise imposed on the signals by environmental perturbations on the links.\nSKA engineering requirements demand that any proposed frequency reference\ndistribution system be proved in \"astronomical verification\" tests. We present\nresults of the astronomical verification of a stabilized frequency reference\ntransfer system proposed for SKA-mid. The dual-receiver architecture of the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array was exploited to subtract the phase-noise of\nthe sky signal from the data, allowing the phase-noise of observations\nperformed using a standard frequency reference, as well as the stabilized\nfrequency reference transfer system transmitting over 77 km of fiber-optic\ncable, to be directly compared. Results are presented for the fractional\nfrequency stability and phase-drift of the stabilized frequency reference\ntransfer system for celestial calibrator observations at 5 GHz and 25 GHz.\nThese observations plus additional laboratory results for the transferred\nsignal stability over a 166 km metropolitan fiber-optic link are used to show\nthat the stabilized transfer system under test exceeds all SKA phase-stability\nrequirements under a broad range of observing conditions. Furthermore, we have\nshown that alternative reference dissemination systems that use multiple\nsynthesizers to supply reference signals to sub-sections of an array may limit\nthe imaging capability of the telescope.\n", "  Measurements of the anisotropic properties of single crystals play a crucial\nrole in probing the physics of new materials. Determining a growth protocol\nthat yields suitable high-quality single crystals can be particularly\nchallenging for multi-component compounds. Here we present a case study of how\nwe refined a procedure to grow single crystals of CaKFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$ from a\nhigh temperature, quaternary liquid solution rich in iron and arsenic (\"FeAs\nself-flux\"). Temperature dependent resistance and magnetization measurements\nare emphasized, in addition to the x-ray diffraction, to detect inter-grown\nCaKFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$, CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ within, what\nappear to be, single crystals. Guided by the rules of phase equilibria and\nthese data, we adjusted growth parameters to suppress formation of the impurity\nphases. The resulting optimized procedure yielded phase-pure single crystals of\nCaKFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$. This optimization process offers insight into the growth\nof quaternary compounds and a glimpse of the four-component phase diagram in\nthe pseudo-ternary FeAs-CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$-KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ system.\n", "  We discuss the complete sets of the off-shell nilpotent (i.e. s^2_{(a)b} = 0)\nand absolutely anticommuting (i.e. s_b s_{ab} + s_{ab} s_b = 0)\nBecchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) (s_b) and anti-BRST (s_{ab}) symmetries for\nthe (3+1)-dimensional (4D) gauge-invariant massive 2-form theory within the\nframework of augmented superfield approach to BRST formalism. In this\nformalism, we obtain the coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities which\nrespect both BRST and anti-BRST symmetries on the constrained hypersurface\ndefined by the Curci-Ferrari type conditions. The absolute anticommutativity\nproperty of the (anti-)BRST transformations (and corresponding generators) is\nensured by the existence of the Curci-Ferrari type conditions which emerge very\nnaturally in this formalism. Furthermore, the gauge-invariant restriction plays\na decisive role in deriving the proper (anti-)BRST transformations for the\nSt{\\\"u}ckelberg-like vector field.\n", "  The VSiPMT (Vacuum Silicon PhotoMultiplier Tube) is an original design for an\ninnovative light detector we proposed with the aim to create new scientific\ninstrumentation for industrial applications and physics research. The idea\nbehind this device is to replace the classical dynode chain of a\nphotomultiplier tube with a silicon photomultiplier, the latter acting as an\nelectron detector and amplifier. The VSiPMT offers very attractive features and\nunprecedented performance, definitely superior to every other photodetector\nwith comparable sensitive surface, such as: negligible power cosumption,\nexcellent photon counting, easy low-voltage-based stabilization and very good\ntime performance. After the feasibility test of the idea, Hamamatsu Photonics\nrealized for our research group two VSiPMT industrial prototypes, that have\nbeen fully characterized. The results of the full characterization of the\n1-inch industrial prototype are presented in this work.\n", "  A hypothetical photon mass, $m_\\gamma$, gives an energy-dependent light speed\nin a Lorentz-invariant theory. Such a modification causes an additional time\ndelay between photons of different energies when they travel through a fixed\ndistance. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their short time duration and\ncosmological propagation distance, are excellent astrophysical objects to\nconstrain $m_\\gamma$. Here for the first time we develop a Bayesian framework\nto study this problem with a catalog of FRBs. Those FRBs with and without\nredshift measurement are both useful in this framework, and can be combined in\na Bayesian way. A catalog of 21 FRBs (including 20 FRBs without redshift\nmeasurement, and one, FRB 121102, with a measured redshift $z=0.19273 \\pm\n0.00008$) give a combined limit $m_\\gamma \\leq 8.7 \\times 10^{-51}\\, {\\rm kg}$,\nor equivalently $m_\\gamma \\leq 4.9 \\times 10^{-15}\\, {\\rm eV}/c^2$ ($m_\\gamma\n\\leq 1.5\\times10^{-50} \\, {\\rm kg}$, or equivalently $m_\\gamma \\leq 8.4 \\times\n10^{-15} \\,{\\rm eV}/c^2$) at 68% (95%) confidence level, which represents the\nbest limit that comes purely from kinematics. The framework proposed here will\nbe valuable when FRBs are observed daily in the future. Increment in the number\nof FRBs, and refinement in the knowledge about the electron distributions in\nthe Milky Way, the host galaxies of FRBs, and the intergalactic median, will\nfurther tighten the constraint.\n", "  Traditional studies of chaos in conservative and driven dissipative systems\nhave established a correspondence between sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions and fractal basin boundaries, but much less is known about the\nrelation between geometry and dynamics in undriven dissipative systems. These\nsystems can exhibit a prevalent form of complex dynamics, dubbed doubly\ntransient chaos because not only typical trajectories but also the (otherwise\ninvariant) chaotic saddles are transient. This property, along with a manifest\nlack of scale invariance, has hindered the study of the geometric properties of\nbasin boundaries in these systems--most remarkably, the very question of\nwhether they are fractal across all scales has yet to be answered. Here we\nderive a general dynamical condition that answers this question, which we use\nto demonstrate that the basin boundaries can indeed form a true fractal; in\nfact, they do so generically in a broad class of transiently chaotic undriven\ndissipative systems. Using physical examples, we demonstrate that the\nboundaries typically form a slim fractal, which we define as a set whose\ndimension at a given resolution decreases when the resolution is increased. To\nproperly characterize such sets, we introduce the notion of equivalent\ndimension for quantifying their relation with sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions at all scales. We show that slim fractal boundaries can exhibit\ncomplex geometry even when they do not form a true fractal and fractal scaling\nis observed only above a certain length scale at each boundary point. Thus, our\nresults reveal slim fractals as a geometrical hallmark of transient chaos in\nundriven dissipative systems.\n", "  Recent outbreaks of Ebola, H1N1 and other infectious diseases have shown that\nthe assumptions underlying the established theory of epidemics management are\ntoo idealistic. For an improvement of procedures and organizations involved in\nfighting epidemics, extended models of epidemics management are required. The\nnecessary extensions consist in a representation of the management loop and the\npotential frictions influencing the loop. The effects of the non-deterministic\nfrictions can be taken into account by including the measures of robustness and\nrisk in the assessment of management options. Thus, besides of the increased\nstructural complexity resulting from the model extensions, the computational\ncomplexity of the task of epidemics management - interpreted as an optimization\nproblem - is increased as well. This is a serious obstacle for analyzing the\nmodel and may require an additional pre-processing enabling a simplification of\nthe analysis process. The paper closes with an outlook discussing some\nforthcoming problems.\n", "  Acquiring quantitative information on charge transfer (CT) dynamics at the\nnanoscale remains an important scientific challenge. In particular, CT\nprocesses in single molecules at surfaces needs to be investigated to be\nproperly controlled in various devices. To address this issue, the dynamics of\nswitching molecules can be exploited. Here, a Nickel-tetraphenylporphyrin\nadsorbed on the Si(100) surface is used to study the CT process ruling the\nreversible activation of two chiral molecular conformations. Via the electrons\nof a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), a statistical study of the molecular\nswitching reveals two specific locations of the molecule for which their\nefficiency is optimized. The CT mechanism is shown to propagate from two\nlateral aryls groups towards the porphyrin macrocycle inducing an\nintramolecular movement of two symmetric pyrroles. The measured switching\nefficiencies can thus be related with a Markus-Jordner model to estimate\nrelevant parameters that describe the dynamics of the CT process. Numerical\nsimulations provide a precise description of the molecular conformations and\nunveil the molecular energy levels that are involved in the CT process. This\nquantitative method opens a completely original approach to study CT at the\nnanoscale.\n", "  Multicomponent nanoparticles can be synthesized with either homogeneous or\nphase-segregated architectures depending on the synthesis conditions and\nelements incorporated. To understand the parameters that determine their\nstructural fate, multicomponent metal-oxide nanoparticles consisting of\ncombinations of Co, Ni, and Cu were synthesized via scanning probe block\ncopolymer lithography and characterized using correlated electron microscopy.\nThese studies revealed that the miscibility, ratio of the metallic components,\nand the synthesis temperature determine the crystal structure and architecture\nof the nanoparticles. A Co-Ni-O system forms a rock salt structure largely due\nto the miscibility of CoO and NiO, while Cu-Ni-O, which has large miscibility\ngaps, forms either homogeneous oxides, heterojunctions, or alloys depending on\nthe annealing temperature and composition. Moreover, a higher ordered\nstructure, Co-Ni-Cu-O, was found to follow the behavior of lower ordered\nsystems.\n", "  In the power spectra of oscillating red giants, there are visually distinct\nfeatures defining stars ascending the red giant branch from those that have\ncommenced helium core burning. We train a one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetwork by supervised learning to automatically learn these visual features\nfrom images of folded oscillation spectra. By training and testing on\n\\textit{Kepler} red giants, we achieve an accuracy of up to 99\\% in separating\nhelium-burning red giants from those ascending the red giant branch. The\nconvolutional neural network additionally shows capability in accurately\npredicting the evolutionary states of 5379 previously unclassified\n\\textit{Kepler} red giants, by which we now have greatly increased the number\nof classified stars.\n", "  An instructive paradox concerning classical description of energy and\nmomentum of extended physical systems in special relativity theory is explained\nusing an elementary example of two point-like massive bodies rotating on a\ncircle in their center-of-mass frame of reference, connected by an arbitrarily\nlight and infinitesimally thin string. Namely, from the point of view of the\ninertial observers who move with respect to the rotating system, the sums of\nenergies and momenta of the two bodies oscillate, instead of being constant in\ntime. This result is understood in terms of the mechanism that binds the\nbodies: the string contributes to the system total energy and momentum no\nmatter how light it is. Its contribution eliminates the unphysical oscillations\nfrom the system total four-momentum. Generality of the relativistic approach,\napplied here to the rotor example, suggests that in every extended physical\nsystem its binding mechanism contributes to its total energy and momentum.\n", "  Based on the analysis of the data on the behavior of electric conductivity at\nthe detonation of condensed high explosives (HEs) with the composition CHNO and\nthe carbon mass fraction higher than 0.1, the conclusion was made of the\npresence of long carbon nanostructures. These structures penetrate all the\nspace of reacting HE. The structures are formed already in the chemical peak\nregion, and they evolve along the detonation wave.\n", "  Using a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations we show that\nduring the rapid growth of high-redshift (z > 5) galaxies, reserves of\nmolecular gas are consumed over a time-scale of 300Myr, almost independent of\nfeedback scheme. We find that there exists no such simple relation for the\ntotal gas fractions of these galaxies, with little correlation between gas\nfractions and specific star formation rates. The bottleneck or limiting factor\nin the growth of early galaxies is in converting infalling gas to cold\nstar-forming gas. Thus, we find that the majority of high redshift dwarf\ngalaxies are effectively in recession, with demand (of star formation) never\nrising to meet supply (of gas), irrespective of the baryonic feedback physics\nmodelled. We conclude that the basic assumption of self-regulation in galaxies\n- that they can adjust total gas consumption within a Hubble time - does not\napply for the dwarf galaxies thought to be responsible for providing most UV\nphotons to reionize the high redshift Universe. We demonstrate how this rapid\nmolecular time-scale improves agreement between semi-analytic model predictions\nof the early Universe and observed stellar mass functions.\n", "  A scenario has recently been reported in which in order to stabilize complete\nsynchronization of an oscillator network---a symmetric state---the symmetry of\nthe system itself has to be broken by making the oscillators nonidentical. But\nhow often does such behavior---which we term asymmetry-induced synchronization\n(AISync)---occur in oscillator networks? Here we present the first general\nscheme for constructing AISync systems and demonstrate that this behavior is\nthe norm rather than the exception in a wide class of physical systems that can\nbe seen as multilayer networks. Since a symmetric network in complete synchrony\nis the basic building block of cluster synchronization in more general\nnetworks, AISync should be common also in facilitating cluster synchronization\nby breaking the symmetry of the cluster subnetworks.\n", "  We study the simultaneous effects of the symmetry energy and temperature on\nthe crust-core transition of a magnetar. The dynamical and the thermodynamical\nspinodals are used to calculate the transition region within a relativistic\nmean-field approach for the equation of state. Quantizing magnetic fields with\nintensities in the range of $ 2\\times 10^{15}<B<5\\times 10 ^{16}$G are\nconsidered. Under these strong magnetic fields, the crust extension is very\nsensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy, and the properties\nthat depend on the crust thickness could set a constraint on the equation of\nstate. It is shown that the effect on the extension of the crust-core\ntransition is washed out for temperatures above $10^{9}$ K. However, for\ntemperatures below that value, a noticeable effect exists that grows as the\ntemperature decreases and which should be taken into account when the evolution\nof magnetars is studied.\n", "  This paper studies change point detection on networks with community\nstructures. It proposes a framework that can detect both local and global\nchanges in networks efficiently. Importantly, it can clearly distinguish the\ntwo types of changes. The framework design is generic and as such several\nstate-of-the-art change point detection algorithms can fit in this design.\nExperiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that this framework\ncan accurately detect changes while achieving up to 800X speedup.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic and optical properties of\n(Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$)$_2$IrO$_4$ (x= 0 - 0.375) and\n(Sr$_{1-y}$Ba$_y$)$_2$IrO$_4$ (y= 0 - 0.375) epitaxial thin-films, in which the\nbandwidth is systematically tuned via chemical substitutions of Sr ions by Ca\nand Ba. Transport measurements indicate that the thin-film series exhibits\ninsulating behavior, similar to the J$_{eff}$= 1/2 spin-orbit Mott insulator\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$. As the average A-site ionic radius increases from\n(Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$)$_2$IrO$_4$ to (Sr$_{1-y}$Ba$_y$)$_2$IrO$_4$, optical\nconductivity spectra in the near-infrared region shift to lower energies, which\ncannot be explained by the simple picture of well-separated J$_{eff}$= 1/2 and\nJ$_{eff}$= 3/2 bands. We suggest that the two-peak-like optical conductivity\nspectra of the layered iridates originates from the overlap between the\noptically-forbidden spin-orbit exciton and the inter-site optical transitions\nwithin the J$_{eff}$= 1/2 band. Our experimental results are consistent with\nthis interpretation as implemented by a multi-orbital Hubbard model\ncalculation: namely, incorporating a strong Fano-like coupling between the\nspin-orbit exciton and inter-site d-d transitions within the J$_{eff}$= 1/2\nband.\n", "  The general solution of the system of General Relativity equations has been\nfound for isotropic Universe with the flat spatial distribution and\nsynchronized time taking into account a perfect dust and the cosmological\nconstant. Schwarzschild, Friedmann and Einstein-de Sitter solutions (as well as\nall of their fusion with each other) are special cases of the found general\nsolution. A method of generating an infinite number of Tolman's like solutions\nhas been found. Exact solutions has been found for the spherically symmetric\ngravitational field of perfect dust clouds in the expanding Universe filled\nwith radiation. A system of ordinary differential equations has been obtained\nfor the spherically symmetric gravitational field of perfect dust clouds in the\nexpanding Universe filled with radiation and nonrelativistic gas. A system of\nequations has been obtained for the spherically symmetric gravitational field\nof ultrarelativistic celestial body explosion (supernova, quasar). The problem\nof a negative density of a perfect dust cloud in General Relativity has been\nconsidered.\n", "  The application of principles of Quantum Mechanics in areas outside of\nphysics has been getting increasing attention in the scientific community in an\nemergent discipline called Quantum Cognition. These principles have been\napplied to explain paradoxical situations that cannot be easily explained\nthrough classical theory. In quantum probability, events are characterised by a\nsuperposition state, which is represented by a state vector in a\n$N$-dimensional vector space. The probability of an event is given by the\nsquared magnitude of the projection of this superposition state into the\ndesired subspace. This geometric approach is very useful to explain paradoxical\nfindings that involve order effects, but do we really need quantum principles\nfor models that only involve projections?\n  This work has two main goals. First, it is still not clear in the literature\nif a quantum projection model has any advantage towards a classical projection.\nWe compared both models and concluded that the Quantum Projection model\nachieves the same results as its classical counterpart, because the quantum\ninterference effects play no role in the computation of the probabilities.\nSecond, it intends to propose an alternative relativistic interpretation for\nrotation parameters that are involved in both classical and quantum models. In\nthe end, instead of interpreting these parameters as a similarity measure\nbetween questions, we propose that they emerge due to the lack of knowledge\nconcerned with a personal basis state and also due to uncertainties towards the\nstate of the world and towards the context of the questions.\n", "  Infrared-Faint Radio Sources (IFRSs) are an unusual class of objects that are\nrelatively bright at radio wavelengths but have faint or undetected infrared\ncounterparts even in deep surveys. We identify and investigate the nature of\nIFRSs using deep radio (S$_{\\rm 1.4~GHz}$ $\\sim$ 100 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at\n5$\\sigma$), optical (m$_{\\rm r}$ $\\sim$ 26 - 27.7 at 5$\\sigma$), and near-IR\n(S$_{\\rm 3.6~{\\mu}m}$ $\\sim$ 1.3 - 2.0 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 5$\\sigma$) data\navailable in two deep fields namely the Subaru X-ray Deep Field (SXDF) and the\nVery Large Array - VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VLA-VVDS) field. In 1.8 deg$^{2}$ of\nthe two fields we identify a total of nine confirmed and ten candidate IFRSs.\nWe find that our IFRSs are high-redshift radio-loud AGN, with 12/19 sources\nhaving redshift estimates in the range of $z$ $\\sim$ 1.7 - 4.3, while a limit\nof $z$ $\\geq$ 2.0 is placed for the remaining seven sources. Notably, our study\nfinds, for the first time, IFRSs with measured redshift $>$ 3.0, and also, the\nredshift estimates for IFRSs in the faintest 3.6 $\\mu$m flux regime i.e.,\nS$_{\\rm 3.6~{\\mu}m}$ $<$ 1.3 ${\\mu}$Jy. Radio observations show that our IFRSs\nexhibit both compact unresolved as well as extended double-lobe morphologies,\nand have predominantly steep radio spectra between 1.4 GHz and 325 MHz. The\nnon-detection of all but one IFRSs in the X-ray band and the optical-to-MIR\ncolour (m$_{\\rm r}$ - m$_{\\rm 24~{\\mu}m}$) suggest that a significant fraction\nof IFRSs are likely to be hosted in dusty obscured galaxies.\n", "  High-level vibrational calculations have been used to investigate\nanharmonicity in a wide variety of materials using density-functional-theory\n(DFT) methods. We have developed a new and efficient approach for describing\nstrongly-anharmonic systems using a vibrational self-consistent-field (VSCF)\nmethod. By far the most computationally expensive part of the calculations is\nthe mapping of an accurate Born-Oppenheimer (BO) energy surface within the\nregion of interest. Here we present an improved method which reduces the\ncomputational cost of the mapping. In this approach we use data from a set of\nenergy calculations for different vibrational distortions of the materials and\nthe corresponding forces on the atoms. Results using both energies and forces\nare presented for the test cases of the hydrogen molecule, solid hydrogen under\nhigh pressure including mapping of two-dimensional subspaces of the BO surface,\nand the bcc phases of the metals Li and Zr. The use of forces data speeds up\nthe anharmonic calculations by up to 40%.\n", "  We introduce the qubit representation by complex numbers on the set of\nApollonius circles with common symmetric points at $0$ and $1$, related with\n$|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states. For one qubit states we find that the\nShannon entropy as a measure of randomness is a constant along Apollonius\ncircles. For two qubit states, the concurence as a characteristic of\nentanglement is taking constant value for the states on the same Apollonius\ncircle. Geometrical meaning of concurence as an area and as a distance in the\nApollonius representation are found. Then we generalize our results to\narbitrary $n$-qubit Apollonius states and show that the fidelity between given\nstate and the symmetric one, as reflected in an axes, is a constant along\nApollonius circles. For two qubits it coinsides with the concurence. For\ngeneric two qubit states we derived Apollonius representation by three complex\nparameters and show that the determinant formula for concurence is related with\nfidelity for symmetric states by two reflections in a vertical axis and\ninversion in a circle. We introduce the complex concurence and an addition\nformula for Apollonius states and show that for generic two qubit states its\nmodulus satisfies the law of cosine. Finally, we show that for two qubit\nApollonius state in bipolar coordinates, the complex concurence is decribed by\nstatic one soliton solution of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  Recent applications of machine learning and statistical inference provide\ncase studies demonstrating how such approaches can accelerate the discovery\nprocess in physical chemistry and related fields. Examples discussed in this\nreview include the introduction of automated approaches to systematically\nimprove experimental design, increase the efficiency of computationally\nexpensive molecular simulations, facilitate construction of predictive models\nfor complex biological processes, and discover interparticle potentials that\nlead to materials which meet specified design goals. A common theme is the\nsynergy between experiment and computation enabled by such approaches.\n", "  The aim of this thesis is to investigate the absence of pulses in pulsar, a\nphenomena also know as pulsar nulling. The motivation for the work done in\nthesis is listed in Chapter 2. A detailed discussion on the previous work\ncarried out to investigate pulsar nulling phenomena is also included in Chapter\n2. Chapter 3 discusses in details all the observations carried out for the\nthesis. In Chapter 4, details regarding the nulling behaviour of various\npulsars are listed. Chapter 4 highlights the fact that nulling is\nunpredictable. Chapter 5 presents a comparison between two pulsars with high\nNFs. It is shown that both the pulsars exhibit similar bursting behaviour, but\nstrikingly different quasi-periodicities and emission properties. Chapter 6\ndiscusses the details regarding the simultaneous observations of two nulling\npulsars at four different frequencies. These observations suggest that nulling\nis a frequency independent phenomena simultaneous occuring over a decade of\nfrequency. Chapter 7 summaries the results obtained in three different studies\nalong with their implications. The future work to extend the work carried out\nin the thesis is also listed in Chapter 7. The main conclusions of the thesis\nare as follow, (1) NF is not an ideal parameter to quantify nulling behaviour,\nconfirmed firmly by comparing low NF pulsars as well as high NF pulsars, (2)\nNulling occurs randomly with unpredictable length durations.\nQuasi-periodicities seen in the high NF pulsars can also be explained by the\nMarkov models with a forcing function, (3) Nulling is an extreme form of\nmode-changing phenomena which occurs on a global magnetospheric scale, (4)\nGeometric reasons are less favoured as a likely cause of nulling phenomena due\nto the randomness and broadband behaviour reported in this thesis.\n", "  Strong interplay of fundamental order parameters in complex oxides are known\nto give rise to exotic physical phenomena. The 4d transition metal oxide SrRhO3\nhas generated much interest, but advances have been hindered by difficulties in\npreparing single crystalline phases. Here, we have epitaxially stabilized high\nquality single crystalline SrRhO3 films and investigated their structural,\nelectronic, and magnetic properties. We determine that their properties\nsignificantly differ from the paramagnetic metallic ground state that governs\nbulk samples and are strongly related to rotations of the RhO6 octahedra.\n", "  While model-based reconstruction methods have been successfully applied to\nflat-panel cone-beam CT (FP-CBCT) systems, typical implementations ignore both\nspatial correlations in the projection data as well as system blurs due to the\ndetector and focal spot in the x-ray source. In this work, we develop a forward\nmodel for flat-panel-based systems that includes blur and noise correlation\nassociated with finite focal spot size and an indirect detector (e.g.,\nscintillator). This forward model is used to develop a staged reconstruction\nframework where projection data are deconvolved and log-transformed, followed\nby a generalized least-squares reconstruction that utilizes a non-diagonal\nstatistical weighting to account for the correlation that arises from the\nacquisition and data processing chain. We investigate the performance of this\nnovel reconstruction approach in both simulated data and in CBCT test-bench\ndata. In comparison to traditional filtered backprojection and model-based\nmethods that ignore noise correlation, the proposed approach yields a superior\nnoise-resolution tradeoff. For example, for a system with 0.34 mm FWHM\nscintillator blur and 0.70 FWHM focal spot blur, using the a correlated noise\nmodel instead of an uncorrelated noise model increased resolution by 42% (with\nvariance matched at 6.9 x 10^-8 mm^-2 ). While this advantage holds across a\nwide range of systems with differing blur characteristics, the improvements are\ngreatest for systems where source blur is larger than detector blur.\n", "  The analysis of a hot loop oscillation event using SOHO/SUMER, GOES/SXI, and\nRHESSI observations is presented. Damped Doppler shift oscillations were\ndetected in the Fe XIX line by SUMER, and interpreted as a fundamental standing\nslow mode. The evolution of soft X-ray emission from GOES/SXI and hard X-ray\nsources from RHESSI suggests that the oscillations of a large loop are\ntriggered by a small flare, which may be produced by interaction (local\nreconnection) of this large loop with a small loop at its footpoint. This study\nprovides clear evidence supporting our early conjecture that the slow-mode\nstanding waves in hot coronal loops are excited by impulsive heating (small or\nmicroflares) at the loop's footpoint.\n", "  The collisions between high-energy ions and solids can result in significant\nphysical and chemical changes to the material. These effects are potentially\nimportant for better understanding the chemistry of interstellar and planetary\nbodies, which are exposed to cosmic radiation and the solar wind, respectively,\nhowever, modeling such collisions on a detailed microscopic basis has thus far\nbeen largely unsuccessful. To that end, a new model, entitled CIRIS: the\nChemistry of Ionizing Radiation in Solids, was created to calculate the\nphysical and chemical effects of the irradiation of solid materials. With the\nnew code, we simulate O2 ice irradiated with 100 keV protons. Our models are\nable to reproduce the measured ozone abundances of a previous experimental\nstudy, as well as independently predict the approximate thickness of the ice\nused in that work.\n", "  We experimentally study a Stub photonic lattice and excite their localized\nlinear states originated from an isolated Flat Band at the center of the linear\nspectrum. By exciting these modes in different regions of the lattice, we\nobserve that they do not diffract across the system and remain well trapped\nafter propagating along the crystal. By using their wave nature, we are able to\ncombine -- in phase and out of phase -- two neighbor states into a coherent\nsuperposition. These observations allow us to propose a novel setup for\nperforming three different all-optical logical operations such as OR, AND, and\nXOR, positioning Flat Band systems as key setups to perform concrete\napplications at any level of power.\n", "  A functional form I_{max}(R)=kR^{-\\alpha}, where R is the radial distance of\nspacecraft, was usually used to model the radial dependence of peak intensities\nI_{max}(R) of solar energetic particles (SEPs). In this work, the\nfive-dimensional Fokker-Planck transport equation incorporating perpendicular\ndiffusion is numerically solved to investigate the radial dependence of SEP\npeak intensities. We consider two different scenarios for the distribution of\nspacecraft fleet: (1) along the radial direction line, (2) along the Parker\nmagnetic field line. We find that the index \\alpha in the above expression\nvaries in a wide range, primarily depending on the properties (e.g., location,\ncoverage) of SEP sources and on the longitudinal/latitudinal separations\nbetween the sources and the magnetic footpoints of the observers. Particularly,\nthe situation that whether the magnetic footpoint of the observer is located\ninside or outside of the SEP source is a crucial factor determining the values\nof index \\alpha. A two-phase phenomenon is found in the radial dependence of\npeak intensities. The \"position\" of the breakpoint (transition point/critical\npoint) is determined by the magnetic connection status of the observers. This\nfinding suggests that a very careful examination of magnetic connection between\nSEP source and each spacecraft should be taken in the observational studies. We\nobtain a lower limit of R^{-1.7\\pm0.1} for empirically modelling the radial\ndependence of SEP peak intensities. Our findings in this work can be used to\nexplain the majority of the previous multispacecraft survey results, and\nespecially to reconcile the different/conflicting empirical values of index\n\\alpha in the literature.\n", "  Nitrate is an important pollutant in drinking water worldwide, and a number\nof methods exist for the removal of nitrate from water including ion exchange\nand reverse osmosis. However, these approaches suffer from a variety of\ndisadvantages including requirements for supply and disposal of brine used for\nregeneration in ion exchange and low water recovery ratio for reverse osmosis.\nHere, we demonstrate the use of high surface area activated carbon electrodes\nfunctionalized with moieties having high affinity for adsorption of nitrate\nfrom aqueous solution, such as those used in ion exchange. Adsorption of\nsurfactant molecules having a quaternary amine ionic group to the activated\ncarbon surfaces provides functionalization of the surfaces without complex\nchemistries. The functionalized electrodes have adsorption capacities of about\n80 mg NaNO$_3$ per gram of activated carbon material. Unlike a traditional ion\nexchanger, the functionalized surfaces can be repeatedly regenerated by the\napplication of an electrostatic potential which displaces the bound NO$_3^-$\nwhile leaving an excess of electronic charge on the electrode. The cell is\ncompleted by an inert counter electrode where Faradaic reactions occur during\nregeneration. Up to approximately 40% of the initial capacity of the electrode\nis accessible following electrical regeneration.\n", "  We have performed angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nexperiments on the surface states of SrTiO$_3$(001) using linearly and\ncircularly polarized light to investigate the subband structures of\nout-of-plane $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals and chiral orbital angular momentum (OAM).\nThe data taken in the first Brillouin zone reveal new subbands for $d_{xz/yz}$\norbitals with Fermi wave vectors of 0.25 and 0.45 $\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$ in\naddition to the previously reported ones. As a result, there are at least two\nsubbands for all the Ti 3d t$_{2g}$ orbitals. Our circular dichroism ARPES data\nis suggestive of a chiral OAM structure in the surface states and may provide\nclues to the origin of the linear Rashba-like surface band splitting.\n", "  We present a highly accurate method for solving single-active-electron (SAE)\natomic eigenset in momentum space. The trouble of Coulomb kernel singularity is\nbypassed with numerical quadrature, which is simple but effective. The\ncomplicated Lande regularization method is no longer necessary. The data of\naccuracy for some low-lying states of the hydrogen and SAE helium atom were\ntabulated. Two examples of using the generated eigenset to solve the hydrogen\natom under strong-field laser pulses were shown. The momentum and the\ncoordinate representation are complementary to each other in quantum mechanics.\nThe simple method to generate eigenstates and the localized behavior of wave\nfunctions in momentum space would be useful in the study of quantum mechanical\nproblems involving continuous states.\n", "  Based on the KP hierarchy reduction method, the general bright-dark mixed\nmulti-soliton solution of the multi-component Maccari system is constructed.\nThe multi-component Maccari system considered comprised of multiple (say $M$)\nshort-wave components and one long-wave component with all possible\ncombinations of nonlinearities including all-focusing, all-defocusing and mixed\ntypes. We firstly derive the two-bright-one-dark (2-b-1-d) and\none-bright-two-dark (1-b-2-d) mixed multi-soliton solutions to the\nthree-component Maccari system in detail. For the interaction between two\nsolitons, the asymptotic analysis shows that inelastic collision can take place\nin a $M$-component Maccari system with $M \\geq 3$ only if the bright parts of\nthe mixed solitons appear at least in two short-wave components. The\nenergy-exchanging inelastic collision characterized by an intensity\nredistribution among the bright parts of the mixed solitons. While the dark\nparts of the mixed solitons and the solitons in the long-wave component always\nundergo elastic collision which just accompanied by a position shift. In the\nend, we extend the corresponding analysis to the $M$-component Maccari system\nto obtain its mixed multi-soliton solution. The formula obtained unifies the\nall-bright, all-dark and mixed multi-soliton solutions.\n", "  In this contribution we report the current stage of the MOLecular\nDissociation (MOL-D) database which is a web service within the Serbian virtual\nobservatory (SerVO) and node within Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Center\n(VAMDC). MOL-D is an atomic and molecular (A&M) database devoted to the\nmodelling of stellar atmospheres, laboratory plasmas, industrial plasmas etc.\nThe initial stage of development was done at the end of 2014, when the service\nfor data connected with hydrogen and helium molecular ions was done. In the\nnext stage of the development of MOL-D, we include new cross-sections and rate\ncoefficients for processes which involve species such as XH+, where X is atom\nof some metal. Data are important for the exploring of the interstellar medium\nas well as for the early Universe chemistry and for the modeling of stellar and\nsolar atmospheres. In this poster, we present our ongoing work and plans for\nthe future.\n", "  In the recent years a significant progress was achieved in the field of\ndesign and fabrication of optical systems based on freeform optical surfaces.\nThey provide a possibility to build fast, wide-angle and high-resolution\nsystems, which are very compact and free of obscuration. However, the field of\nfreeform surfaces design techniques still remains underexplored. In the present\npaper we use the mathematical apparatus of orthogonal polynomials defined over\na square aperture, which was developed before for the tasks of wavefront\nreconstruction, to describe shape of a mirror surface. Two cases, namely\nLegendre polynomials and generalization of the Zernike polynomials on a square,\nare considered. The potential advantages of these polynomials sets are\ndemonstrated on example of a three-mirror unobscured telescope with F/#=2.5 and\nFoV=7.2x7.2{\\deg}. In addition, we discuss possibility of use of curved\ndetectors in such a design.\n", "  Quantum computing for machine learning attracts increasing attention and\nrecent technological developments suggest that especially adiabatic quantum\ncomputing may soon be of practical interest. In this paper, we therefore\nconsider this paradigm and discuss how to adopt it to the problem of binary\nclustering. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of our approach\nand illustrate how systems of qubits adiabatically evolve towards a solution.\n", "  The performed magnetohydrodynamic simulation examines the importance of\nmagnetofluid evolution which naturally leads to current sheets in the presence\nof three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls. Initial magnetic field is constructed\nby superposing a 3D force-free field on a constant axial magnetic field. The\ninitial field supports 3D magnetic nulls having classical spine axis and\ndome-shaped fan surface; and exerts non-zero Lorentz force on the magnetofluid.\nImportantly, the simulation identifies the development of current sheets near\nthe 3D magnetic nulls. The morphology of the current sheets is similar to a\ncylindrical surface where the surface encloses the spine axis. The development\nis because of favorable deformation of magnetic field lines constituting the\ndome-shaped fan surface. The deformation of field lines is found to be caused\nfrom the flow generated by magnetic reconections at current sheets which are\nlocated away from the cylindrically-shaped current sheets.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger cat states, constructed from Glauber coherent states and\napplied for description of qubits, are generalized to the kaleidoscope of\ncoherent states related with regular n-polygon symmetry and the roots of unity.\nThe cases of the trinity states and the quartet states are described in\ndetails. Normalization formula for these states requires introduction of\nspecific combinations of exponential functions with mod 3 and mod 4 symmetry.\nWe show that for an arbitrary $n$, these states can be generated by the Quantum\nFourier transform and can provide qutrits, ququats and in general, qudit units\nof quantum information. Relations with quantum groups and quantum calculus are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In a magnetic field two-dimensional (2d) electron systems host, with quenched\nkinetic energy, a variety of many-body correlation phenomena, such as\ninteraction-driven new states and associated collective excitations over them.\nIn a magnetic field the two-body operators pertinent to the 2d Coulomb\ninteraction obey a crossing relation, with which the Coulomb interaction is\nalso cast into the form of manifest exchange interaction. It is shown that\nactive use of this direct/exchange duality of the interaction allows one to\ndevelop, within the framework of the single-mode approximation, a new efficient\nalgorithm for handling a wide class of collective excitations. The utility of\nour algorithm is demonstrated by studying some examples of inter- and\nintra-Landau-level collective excitations in graphene and in conventional\nelectron systems.\n", "  We develop a 3D porous medium model for sap flow within a tree stem, which\nconsists of a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation with a suitable\ntranspiration source term. Using an asymptotic analysis, we derive approximate\nseries solutions for the liquid saturation and sap velocity for a general class\nof coefficient functions. Several important non-dimensional parameters are\nidentified that can be used to characterize various flow regimes. We\ninvestigate the relative importance of stem aspect ratio versus anisotropy in\nthe sapwood hydraulic conductivity, and how these two effects impact the radial\nand vertical components of sap velocity. The analytical results are validated\nby means of a second-order finite volume discretization of the governing\nequations, and comparisons are drawn to experimental results on Norway spruce\ntrees.\n", "  This work presents an in-depth investigation of the properties of complexes\ncomposed of hydrogen, silicon or oxygen with carbon, which are major\nunintentional impurities in undoped GaN. This manuscript is a complement to our\nprevious work on carbon--carbon and carbon-vacancy complexes. We have employed\na first-principles method using Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functionals\nwithin the framework of generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory. Two\nH--C, four Si--C and five O--C complexes in different charge states have been\nconsidered. After full geometry relaxations, formation energies, binding\nenergies and both thermal and optical transition levels were obtained. The\ncalculated energy levels have been systematically compared with the\nexperimentally observed carbon related trap levels. Furthermore, we computed\nvibrational frequencies for selected defect complexes and defect concentrations\nwere estimated in the low, mid and high carbon doping scenarios considering two\ndifferent cases where electrically active defects: (a) only carbon and\nvacancies and (b) not only carbon and vacancies but also hydrogen, silicon and\noxygen. We confirmed that $\\mathrm{C_N}$ is a dominant acceptor in GaN. In\naddition to it, substantial amount of $\\mathrm{Si_{Ga}-C_N}$ complex exists in\na neutral form. This complex is a likely candidate for unknown form of carbon\nobserved in undoped $n$-type GaN.\n", "  As a method of analyzing and predicting social phenomena using social media\nas data, we propose a method using a mathematical model of hit phenomenon which\nis the theory of social physics. I could explain the transition of the number\nof social media written in movies, TV dramas, Music Concerts, Pokemon GO and\nproposed a method that can be used for analysis and prediction of social\nphenomena.\n", "  The existence of self-gravito-acoustic (SGA) shock signals (SSs) associated\nwith negative self-gravitational potential in the perturbed state of the\nastrophysical compact objects (ACOs) (viz. white dwarfs, neutron stars, black\nholes, etc.) is predicted for the first time. A modified Burgers equation (MB),\nwhich is valid for both planar and non-planar spherical geometries, by the\nreductive perturbation method. It is shown that the longitudinal viscous force\nacting in the medium of any ACO is the source of dissipation, and is\nresponsible for the formation of these SGA SSs. The time evolution of these SGA\nSSs is also shown for different values (viz. $0.5$, $1$, and $2$ ) of the ratio\nof nonlinear coefficient to dissipative coefficient in the MB equation. The\ntheory presented here is so general that it can be applied in any ACO of planar\nor non-planar spherical shape.\n", "  On the basis of the qualitative analysis and numerical simulation of\ncosmological models with classical and phantom scalar fields with self-action\nthere have been revealed and refined such models' distinctive features and\npotential possibilities for their usage as basic models in cosmology.\n", "  Many doctors although they have not firsthand experience of judo, describe it\nas a sport unsuitable for children. Theoretically speaking falls derived by\nJudo throwing techniques,could be potentially dangerous,especially for kids,if\npoorly managed.A lot of researches were focalized on trauma or injuries taking\nplace in judo, both during training and competition The goal of this Research\nis to define and apply a scientific methodology to evaluate the hazard in falls\nby judo throws for children during training.By organizing the research there\nare defined: Five throws with different falls and flight time. The maximum\nimpact forces and velocities. The contact surfaces of bodies on the Tatami. The\nElastocaloric effect to evaluate the energy absorption by Tatami Materials. The\nmaximum Strain on the Tatami. The impact reaction Stress on the children\nbodies. After valuated the mechanic of falls.Is performed the evaluation of\ncontact body surfaces on the Tatami, by a Japanese AVIO Thermal Camera. To\nconnect the impact biomechanics with the potential trauma, the only worldwide\naccepted methodology both from Medical and Engineering people is the Crash test\nMethodology. Connecting in this way, the mechanical results with the resulting\nphysiological hazard of Judo throwing techniques. With this use it is proved\nthat correct falls of judo throws are safe for judo boy, on IJF approved\nTatami.The last two troubles that our analysis has singled out about still judo\nthrowing techniques training for kids are: The wrong combination of kids during\ntraining and the potential long term trauma that have for organ target both\nLiver and Spleen. These unevaluated problems are present in kids training, in\nsuch delicate issues a Digital Assistant named (Hazard Training Sentinel) that\nis able to alert if cumulative stress for spleen and liver could be dangerous\nfor a specific boy.\n", "  Ferroelectricity is usually found in compound materials composed by different\nelements. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we reveal the first\nexample of spontaneous electrical polarization and ferroelectricity in stable\ntwo-dimensional elemental materials: elemental Group-V (As, Sb, and Bi)\nmonolayers. The polarization is due to the spontaneous lattice distortion with\natomic layer buckling. Interestingly, for Bi monolayer, apart from the\nferroelectric phase, we find that it can also host an antiferroelectric phase.\nThe Curie temperatures of these elemental materials can be higher than room\ntemperature, making them promising for realizing ultrathin ferroelectric\ndevices of broad interest.\n", "  The mean field approximation results in the mixed spin 1/2 Ising model and\nspin 1 Blume-Capel model, in the hexagonal nanowire system, are obtained from\nthe Bogoliubov inequality. The Gibbs free energy, magnetization and critical\nfrontiers are obtained. Besides the stable branches of the order parameters, we\nobtain the metastable and unstable parts of these curves and also find phase\ntransitions of the metastable branches of the order parameters. The\nclassification of the stable, metastable and unstable states is made by\ncomparing the free energy values of these states.\n", "  The basic features of nucleus-acoustic (NA) envelope bright and dark\nsolitons, which exist in degenerate quantum plasmas, have been theoretically\ninvestigated by deriving the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation. The\nreductive perturbation method, which is valid for a small but finite amplitude\nlimit, is employed. It is found that the bright envelope solitons are\nmodulationally unstable, whereas the dark ones are stable. It is also observed\nthat the fundamental properties (viz. Modulational instability (MI) growth\nrate, width and energy concentration of NA waves, etc.) of NA unstable bright\nenvelope solitons are significantly modified by constituent particles number\ndensity. The implications of our results obtained from our present\ninvestigation in astrophysical compact objects like white dwarfs and neutron\nstars are briefly discussed.\n", "  Modulational instability (MI) of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) has been\ntheoretically investigated in a plasma system which is composed of inertial\nwarm adiabatic ions, isothermal positrons, and two temperature superthermal\nelectrons. A nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation is derived by using\nreductive perturbation method that governs the MI of the IAWs. The numerical\nanalysis of the solution of NLS equation shows the existence of both stable\n(dark envelope solitons exist) and unstable (bright envelope solitons exist)\nregimes of IAWs. It is observed that the basic features (viz. stability of the\nwave profile and MI growth rate) of the IAWs are significantly modified by the\nsuperthermal parameter ($\\kappa$) and related plasma parameters. The results of\nour present investigation should be useful for understanding different\nnonlinear phenomena in both space and laboratory plasmas.\n", "  Comprehensive understanding of the world's most energy efficient powerful\ncomputer, the human brain, is an elusive scientific issue. Still, already\ngained knowledge indicates memristors can be used as a building block to model\nthe brain. At the same time, brain cortex is folded allowing trillions of\nneurons to be integrated in a compact volume. Therefore, we report flexible\naluminium oxide based memristive devices fabricated and then derived from\nwidely used bulk mono-crystalline silicon (100). We use complementary metal\noxide semiconductor based processes to layout the foundation for ultra large\nscale integration (ULSI) of such memory devices to advance the task of\ncomprehending a physical model of human brain.\n", "  We analyzed the NANTEN2 13CO (J=2-1 and 1-0) datasets in NGC 2024. We found\nthat the cloud consists of two velocity components, whereas the cloud shows\nmostly single-peaked CO profiles. The two components are physically connected\nto the HII region as evidenced by their close correlation with the dark lanes\nand the emission nebulosity. The two components show complementary distribution\nwith a displacement of 0.4 pc. Such complementary distribution is typical to\ncolliding clouds discovered in regions of high-mass star formation. We\nhypothesize that cloud-cloud collision between the two components triggered the\nformation of the late O stars and early B stars localized within 0.3 pc of the\ncloud peak. The collision timescale is estimated to be ~ 10^5 yrs from a ratio\nof the displacement and the relative velocity 3-4 km s-1 corrected for probable\nprojection. The high column density of the colliding cloud 1023 cm-2 is similar\nto those in the other massive star clusters in RCW 38, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603,\nand M42, which are likely formed under trigger by cloud-cloud collision. The\npresent results provide an additional piece of evidence favorable to high-mass\nstar formation by a major cloud-cloud collision in Orion.\n", "  We derive macroscopic dynamics for self-propelled particles in a fluid. The\nstarting point is a coupled Vicsek-Stokes system. The Vicsek model describes\nself-propelled agents interacting through alignment. It provides a\nphenomenological description of hydrodynamic interactions between agents at\nhigh density. Stokes equations describe a low Reynolds number fluid. These two\ndynamics are coupled by the interaction between the agents and the fluid. The\nfluid contributes to rotating the particles through Jeffery's equation.\nParticle self-propulsion induces a force dipole on the fluid. After\ncoarse-graining we obtain a coupled Self-Organised Hydrodynamics (SOH)-Stokes\nsystem. We perform a linear stability analysis for this system which shows that\nboth pullers and pushers have unstable modes. We conclude by providing\nextensions of the Vicsek-Stokes model including short-distance repulsion,\nfinite particle inertia and finite Reynolds number fluid regime.\n", "  The spreading dynamics of Newtonian liquids have been extensively studied in\nhydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces and its behavior has been extensively\nexplored over the last years. However, drop impact of Non-Newtonian liquids\nstill needs further study. Luu and Forterre (J. Fluid Mech., 632, 2009)\nsuccessfully found scaling laws for yield-stress fluids on hydrophilic\nsurfaces. They also uncovered interesting and yet unexplained regimes when the\nimpact was performed on a superhydrophobic surface. In this work, we perform\ndrop impact experiments on micro-patterned surfaces with two types of\nnon-Newtonian liquids: one showing shear-thickening behavior and another one\nshowing shear-thinning. Our results show that a typical shear-thickening liquid\nas cornstarch -at least a the relatively low concentration of 30\\%w/w- spreads\naccording to the scaling laws of Newtonian liquids, whereas visco-elastic\nliquids as Carbopol behave as predicted by Luu and Forterre for impact on\nhydrophilic surfaces, but show different scaling laws when they impact on\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces.\n", "  The aim of this thesis is to analyze part of the results presented by R.E.\nBorcherds in his article on renormalization and quantum field theories. To\nfacilitate this, the first chapter presents the basic facts on category theory,\nsheaf theory and the theory of distributions on a manifold. In the particular\ncase of distributions on manifolds we differentiate between the H-distribution\n(introduced by H\\\"ormander) and the D-distributions (described in the book of\nDieudonn{\\'e}) and extend the product of distributions defined by H\\\"ormander\nonly for H-distibution, to an action from H-distributions over D-distributions.\n  Each one of these facts will be used along the thesis in order to exhibit\nmore detailed descriptions and explanations for the results. In Chapter 2 the\nconcepts of spacetime, fields, Lagrangians, propagators and Feynman measure are\ndefined. The notion of Feynman measure is introduced with a more detailed\nexplanation of the Gaussian condition and its relation with the cut propagator.\nIn the last chapter we define the renormalization group and immediately\ncharacterize it using the results from Chapter 1. The algebraic structure of\nthis group is described in detail. We present a descending filtration of the\nrenormalization group by normal subgroups, compute the corresponding quotients\nand commutators, and show that any element of the renormalization group can be\nwritten as an infinite product of elements each one living in one of the\naforementioned subgroups. Lastly we show that an action from the\nrenormalization group over the set of Feynman measures is well defined and\nprove that this action is transitive over the Feynman measures associated with\na given cut local propagator.\n", "  We study conformal defects in two important examples of string theory\norbifolds. First, we show that topological defects in the language of\nLandau-Ginzburg models carry information about the RG flow between the\nnon-compact orbifolds $\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}_d$. Such defects are shown to\ncorrectly implement the bulk-induced RG flow on the boundary. Secondly, we\nstudy what the possible conformal defects are between the $c=1$ bosonic 2D\nconformal field theories with target space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The defects\ncataloged here are obtained from boundary states corresponding to D-branes in\nthe $c=2$ free theory with target space $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times\nS^1/\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Via the unfolding procedure, such boundary states are later\nmapped to defects between the circle orbifolds. Furthermore, we compute the\nalgebra of the topological class of defects at different radii.\n", "  We approach the discretisation of Maxwell's equations directly in space-time\nwithout making any non-relativistic assumptions with the particular focus on\nsimulations in rotating reference frames. As a research example we study\nSagnac's effect in a rotating ring resonator. After the discretisation, we\nexpress the numerical scheme in a form resembling 3D FIT with leapfrog. We\ncompare the stability and convergence properties of two 4D approaches, namely\nFIT and FEM, both using Whitney interpolation.\n", "  Interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM), or proposals for underlying\ntheories, that attempt to present a definite realist picture, such as Bohmian\nmechanics, require strong non-local effects. Naively, these effects would\nviolate causality and contradict special relativity. However if the theory\nagrees with QM the violation cannot be observed directly. Here, we demonstrate\nexperimentally such an effect: we steer the velocity and trajectory of a\nBohmian particle using a remote measurement. We use a pair of photons and\nentangle the spatial transverse position of one with the polarization of the\nother. The first photon is sent to a double-slit-like apparatus, where its\ntrajectory is measured using the technique of Weak Measurements. The other\nphoton is projected to a linear polarization state. The choice of polarization\nstate, and the result, steer the first photon in the most intuitive sense of\nthe word. The effect is indeed shown to be dramatic, while being easy to\nvisualize. We discuss its strength and what are the conditions for it to occur.\n", "  The topology and dynamics of the three-dimensional magnetic field in the\nsolar atmosphere govern various solar eruptive phenomena and activities, such\nas flares, coronal mass ejections, and filaments/prominences. We have to\nobserve and model the vector magnetic field to understand the structures and\nphysical mechanisms of these solar activities. Vector magnetic fields on the\nphotosphere are routinely observed via the polarized light, and inferred with\nthe inversion of Stokes profiles. To analyze these vector magnetic fields, we\nneed first to remove the 180$^\\circ$ ambiguity of the transverse components and\ncorrect the projection effect. Then, the vector magnetic field can be served as\nthe boundary conditions for a force-free field modeling after a proper\npreprocessing. The photospheric velocity field can also be derived from a time\nsequence of vector magnetic fields. Three-dimensional magnetic field could be\nderived and studied with theoretical force-free field models, numerical\nnonlinear force-free field models, magnetohydrostatic models, and\nmagnetohydrodynamic models. Magnetic energy can be computed with\nthree-dimensional magnetic field models or a time series of vector magnetic\nfield. The magnetic topology is analyzed by pinpointing the positions of\nmagnetic null points, bald patches, and quasi-separatrix layers. As a well\nconserved physical quantity, magnetic helicity can be computed with various\nmethods, such as the finite volume method, discrete flux tube method, and\nhelicity flux integration method. This quantity serves as a promising parameter\ncharacterizing the activity level of solar active regions.\n", "  The correlation between magnetic properties and microscopic structural\naspects in the diluted magnetic semiconductor Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Te is\ninvestigated by x-ray diffraction and magnetization as a function of the Mn\nconcentration $x$. The occurrence of high ferromagnetic-transition temperatures\nin the rhombohedrally distorted phase of slowly-cooled Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Te is\nshown to be directly correlated with the formation and coexistence of\nstrongly-distorted Mn-poor and weakly-distorted Mn-rich regions. It is\ndemonstrated that the weakly-distorted phase fraction is responsible for the\noccurrence of high-transition temperatures in Ge$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Te. When the Mn\nconcentration becomes larger, the Mn-rich regions start to switch into the\nundistorted cubic structure, and the transition temperature is suppressed\nconcurrently. By identifying suitable annealing conditions, we successfully\nincreased the transition temperature to above 200 K for Mn concentrations close\nto the cubic phase. Structural data indicate that the weakly-distorted phase\nfraction can be restored at the expense of the cubic regions upon the\nenhancement of the transition temperature, clearly establishing the direct link\nbetween high-transition temperatures and the weakly-distorted Mn-rich phase\nfraction.\n", "  Electrolyte decomposition reactions on Li-ion battery electrodes contribute\nto the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. These SEI layers\nare one of the known causes for the loss in battery voltage and capacity over\nrepeated charge/discharge cycles. In this work, density functional theory\n(DFT)-based ab-initio calculations are applied to study the initial steps of\nthe decomposition of the organic electrolyte component ethylene carbonate (EC)\non the (10-14) surface of a layered Li(Nix,Mny,Co1-x-y)O2 (NMC) cathode\ncrystal, which is commonly used in commercial Li-ion batteries. The effects on\nthe EC reaction pathway due to dissolved Li+ ions in the electrolyte solution\nand different NMC cathode surface terminations containing absorbed hydroxyl -OH\nor fluorine -F species are explicitly considered. We predict a very fast\nchemical reaction consisting of an EC ring-opening process on the bare cathode\nsurface, the rate of which is independent of the battery operation voltage.\nThis EC ring-opening reaction is unavoidable once the cathode material contacts\nwith the electrolyte because this process is purely chemical rather than\nelectrochemical in nature. The -OH and -F adsorbed species display a\npassivation effect on the surface against the reaction with EC, but the extent\nis limited except for the case of -OH bonded to a surface transition metal\natom. Our work implies that the possible rate-limiting steps of the electrolyte\nmolecule decomposition are the reactions on the decomposed organic products on\nthe cathode surface rather than on the bare cathode surface.\n", "  Distant luminous quasars provide important information on the growth of the\nfirst supermassive black holes, their host galaxies and the epoch of\nreionization. The identification of quasars is usually performed through\ndetection of their Lyman-$\\alpha$ line redshifted to $\\sim$ 0.9 microns at\nz>6.5. Here, we report the discovery of a very Lyman-$\\alpha$ luminous quasar,\nPSO J006.1240+39.2219 at redshift z=6.618, selected based on its red colour and\nmulti-epoch detection of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission in a single near-infrared\nband. The Lyman-$\\alpha$-line luminosity of PSO J006.1240+39.2219 is unusually\nhigh and estimated to be 0.8$\\times$10$^{12}$ Solar luminosities (about 3% of\nthe total quasar luminosity). The Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission of PSO\nJ006.1240+39.2219 shows fast variability on timescales of days in the quasar\nrest frame, which has never been detected in any of the known high-redshift\nquasars. The high luminosity of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line, its narrow width and\nfast variability resemble properties of local Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies\nwhich suggests that the quasar is likely at the active phase of the black hole\ngrowth accreting close or even beyond the Eddington limit.\n", "  Magnetotransport measurements are presented on paramagnetic (Hg,Mn)Te quantum\nwells (QWs) with an inverted band structure. Gate-voltage controlled density\ndependent measurements reveal an unusual behavior in the transition regime from\nn- to p-type conductance: A very small magnetic field of approximately 70 mT is\nsufficient to induce a transition into the nu = -1 quantum Hall state, which\nextends up to at least 10 Tesla. The onset field value remains constant for a\nunexpectedly wide gate-voltage range. Based on temperature and angle-dependent\nmagnetic field measurements we show that the unusual behavior results from the\nrealization of the quantum anomalous Hall state in these magnetically doped\nQWs.\n", "  We report comprehensive angle-resolved photoemission investigations on the\nelectronic structure of single crystal multiple-layer FeSe films grown on CaF2\nsubstrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Measurements on FeSe/CaF2\nsamples with different superconducting transition temperatures Tc of 4 K, 9 K\nand 14 K reveal electronic difference in their Fermi surface and band\nstructure. Indication of the nematic phase transition is observed from\ntemperature-dependent measurements of these samples; the nematic transition\ntemperature is 140-160 K, much higher than 90 K for the bulk FeSe. Potassium\ndeposition is applied onto the surface of these samples; the nematic phase is\nsuppressed by potassium deposition which introduces electrons to these FeSe\nfilms and causes a pronounced electronic structure change. We compared and\ndiscussed the electronic structure and superconductivity of the FeSe/CaF2 films\nby PLD method with the FeSe/SrTiO3 films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method\nand bulk FeSe. The PLD-grown multilayer FeSe/CaF2 is more hole-doped than that\nin MBE-grown multiple-layer FeSe films. Our results on FeSe/CaF2 films by PLD\nmethod establish a link between bulk FeSe single crystal and FeSe/SrTiO3 films\nby MBE method, and provide important information to understand\nsuperconductivity in FeSe-related systems.\n", "  We have carried out high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements\non the Cebased heavy fermion compound CePt2In7 that exhibits stronger\ntwo-dimensional character than the prototypical heavy fermion system CeCoIn5.\nMultiple Fermi surface sheets and a complex band structure are clearly\nresolved. We have also performed detailed band structure calculations on\nCePt2In7. The good agreement found between our measurements and the\ncalculations suggests that the band renormalization effect is rather weak in\nCePt2In7. A comparison of the common features of the electronic structure of\nCePt2In7 and CeCoIn5 indicates that CeCoIn5 shows a much stronger band\nrenormalization effect than CePt2In7. These results provide new information for\nunderstanding the heavy fermion behaviors and unconventional superconductivity\nin Ce-based heavy fermion systems.\n", "  With continued improvement in telescope sensitivity and observational\ntechniques, the search for rocky planets in stellar habitable zones is entering\nan exciting era. With so many exoplanetary systems available for follow-up\nobservations to find potentially habitable planets, one needs to prioritise the\never-growing list of candidates. We aim to determine which of the known\nplanetary systems are dynamically capable of hosting rocky planets in their\nhabitable zones, with the goal of helping to focus future planet search\nprograms. We perform an extensive suite of numerical simulations to identify\nregions in the habitable zones of single Jovian planet systems where Earth mass\nplanets could maintain stable orbits, specifically focusing on the systems in\nthe Catalog of Earth-like Exoplanet Survey Targets (CELESTA). We find that\nsmall, Earth-mass planets can maintain stable orbits in cases where the\nhabitable zone is largely, or partially, unperturbed by a nearby Jovian, and\nthat mutual gravitational interactions and resonant mechanisms are capable of\nproducing stable orbits even in habitable zones that are significantly or\ncompletely disrupted by a Jovian. Our results yield a list of 13 single Jovian\nplanet systems in CELESTA that are not only capable of supporting an Earth-mass\nplanet on stable orbits in their habitable zone, but for which we are also able\nto constrain the orbits of the Earth-mass planet such that the induced radial\nvelocity signals would be detectable with next generation instruments.\n", "  The SU(3) symmetry realized by J. P. Elliott in the sd nuclear shell is\ndestroyed in heavier shells by the strong spin-orbit interaction. However, the\nSU(3) symmetry has been used for the description of heavy nuclei in terms of\nbosons in the framework of the Interacting Boson Approximation, as well as in\nterms of fermions using the pseudo-SU(3) approximation. We introduce a new\nfermionic approximation, called the proxy-SU(3), and we comment on its\nsimilarities and differences with the other approaches.\n", "  An approximate SU(3) symmetry appears in heavy deformed even-even nuclei, by\nomitting the intruder Nilsson orbital of highest total angular momentum and\nreplacing the rest of the intruder orbitals by the orbitals which have escaped\nto the next lower major shell. The approximation is based on the fact that\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between the orbitals of the two sets,\nbased on pairs of orbitals having identical quantum numbers of orbital angular\nmomentum, spin, and total angular momentum. The accuracy of the approximation\nis tested through calculations in the framework of the Nilsson model in the\nasymptotic limit of large deformations, focusing attention on the changes in\nselection rules and in avoided crossings caused by the opposite parity of the\nproxies with respect to the substituted orbitals.\n", "  Using a new approximate analytic parameter-free proxy-SU(3) scheme, we make\npredictions of shape observables for deformed nuclei, namely beta and gamma\ndeformation variables, and compare these with empirical data and with\npredictions by relativistic and non-relativistic mean-field theories.\n", "  The importance of snow cover and ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere was\nrecognized by various authors leading to a positive feedback of surface\nreflectivity on climate. In fact, the retreat of Arctic sea ice is accompanied\nby enhanced solar input in the Arctic region, i.e. a decrease of the\nterrestrial albedo. We have studied this effect for the past six decades and\nestimate the corresponding global warming in the northern hemisphere. A simple\n1-dimensional model is used that includes the simultaneous increase of the\ngreenhouse gases. Our results indicate that the latter directly cause a\ntemperature rise of only 0.2 K in 1955 to 2015, while a notably larger effect\n0.7 +/- 0.2 K is found for the loss of Arctic sea ice in the same time. These\nnumbers comprise most of the reported mean temperature rise of 1.2 +/- 0.2 K of\nthe northern hemisphere. The origin of the sea-ice retreat is discussed, e.g.\ninternal variability or feedback by the CO2 concentration increase. Our data\nalso suggest a delayed response of the global surface temperature rise to the\nloss of sea ice with a time constant of approximately 10 to 20 years.\n", "  Bubbly flows, as present in bubble column reactors, can be simulated using a\nvariety of simulation techniques. In order to gain high resolution CFD methods\nare used to simulate a pseudo 2D bubble column using EL and EE techniques. The\nforces on bubble dynamics are solved within open access software OpenFOAM with\nbubble interactions computed via Monte Carlo methods. The estimated bubble size\ndistribution and the predicted hold-up are compared to experimental data and\nother simulative work using EE approach and show reasonable consensus for both.\nBenchmarks with state of the art EE simulations shows that the EL approach is\nadvantageous if the bubble number stays at a certain level, as the EL approach\nscales linearly with the number of bubbles simulated. Therefore, different\ncomputational meshes have been used to also account for influence of the\nresolution quality. The EL approach indicated faster solution for all realistic\ncases, only deliberate decrease of coalescence rates could push CPU time to the\nlimits. Critical bubble number - when EE becomes advantageous over the EL\napproach - was estimated to be 40.000 in this particular case.\n", "  Using a new approximate analytic parameter-free proxy-SU(3) scheme, we make\nsimple predictions for the global feature of prolate dominance in deformed\nnuclei and the locus of the prolate-oblate shape transition and compare these\nwith empirical data.\n", "  In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of 481 weak solar\nflares, from A0.01 to the B \\textit{GOES} class, that were observed during the\nperiod of extremely low solar activity from 2009 April to July. For all flares\nwe measured the temperature of the plasma in the isothermal and two-temperature\napproximations and tried to fit its relationship with the X-ray class using\nexponential and power-law functions. We found that the whole temperature\ndistribution in the range from A0.01 to X-class cannot be fit by one\nexponential function. The fitting for weak flares below A1.0 is significantly\nsteeper than that for medium and large flares. The power-law approximation\nseems to be more reliable: the corresponding functions were found to be in good\nagreement with experimental data both for microflares and for normal flares.\nOur study predicts that the evidence of plasma heating can be found in flares\nstarting from the A0.0002 X-ray class. Weaker events presumably cannot heat the\nsurrounding plasma. We also estimated emission measures for all flares studied\nand the thermal energy for 113 events.\n", "  The fabrication of artificial materials by stacking of individual\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials is amongst one of the most promising research\navenues in the field of 2D materials. Moreover, this strategy to fabricate new\nman-made materials can be further extended by fabricating hybrid stacks between\n2D materials and other functional materials with different dimensionality\nmaking the potential number of combinations almost infinite. Among all these\npossible combinations, mixing 2D materials with transition metal oxides can\nresult especially useful because of the large amount of interesting physical\nphenomena displayed separately by these two material families. We present a\nhybrid device based on the stacking of a single layer MoS2 onto a lanthanum\nstrontium manganite (La0.7Sr0.3MnO3) thin film, creating an atomically thin\ndevice. It shows a rectifying electrical transport with a ratio of 103, and a\nphotovoltaic effect with Voc up to 0.4 V. The photodiode behaviour arises as a\nconsequence of the different doping character of these two materials. This\nresult paves the way towards combining the efforts of these two large materials\nscience communities.\n", "  The usual Langevin approach to describe systems driven by noise fails to\ndescribe the long time behavior of systems with multiple attractors. The\nsolution of the associated linear Fokker-Planck equation is always unique, even\nthough it might show one or more maxima. In this context, it is customary to\ncall transitions to changes in the shape of the equilibrium distribution\nfunction and relate the maxima to the attractors. Some years ago, a theory was\ndeveloped for a system with interacting elements or subunits that, starting\nfrom the Langevin description of all the variables, leads to bifurcating\n\\textquotedblleft one-particle\\textquotedblright\\, distribution functions when\nthe number of elements tends to infinity. In this paper, a mean-field\nhypothesis has been used to deal with systems with a finite number of elements.\nWe carry out numerical simulations yielding bifurcation solutions for the\nprobability density of a collective variable. We also compare the results of\nthe mean-field hypothesis with those obtained with the Langevin approach for\nfinite systems.\n", "  We have used recently published data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and\nthe Telescope Array Project to conclude some inferences concerning the origin\nand composition of ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). We advocate for model\nthe UHECR flux as a combination of the Galactic and Extragalactic components\nexchanging the dominant role at the famous feature of the energy spectrum\ncalled 'the ankle'. We put a special emphasis on the individual experiment\nenergy resolution and possible biases it introduces. We have eventually\ncombined the data from both big experiments to the one 'world average' UHECR\nspectrum and we used it, supported by the analysis of the distribution of the\nExtensive Air Shower (EAS) development maximum depth to find the UHECR mass\ncomposition of both: Galactic and Extragalactic components. We studied the\ndependence of the on mass composition on the cosmic ray source distribution in\nspace. We present results for some models existing in the literature. We found\nthe evidence of the deficit of Extragalactic sources in the vicinity of the\nGalaxy of the the UHECR, what is in concordance with the small scale anisotropy\nanalysis results.\n", "  Spin waves are perturbations in the relative orientation of magnetic moments\nin a continuous magnetic system, which have been proposed as a new kind of\ninformation carrier for spin-based low power applications. For this purpose, a\nmajor obstacle to overcome is the energy-efficient excitation of coherent short\nwavelength spin waves and alternatives to excitation via the Oersted field of\nan alternating current need to be explored. Here we show, by means of\nmicromagnetic simulations, how, in a perpendicularly magnetized thin strip, a\ndomain wall pinned at a geometrical constriction emits spin waves when forced\nto rotate by the application of a low direct current flowing along the strip.\nSpin waves propagate only in the direction of the electron's flow at the first\nodd harmonic of the domain wall rotation frequency for which propagation is\nallowed. Excitation is due to in-plane dipolar stray field of the rotating\ndomain wall and that the resulting unidirectionality is a consequence of the\ndomain wall displacement at the constriction. On the other hand, the\napplication of an external field opposing domain wall depinning breaks the\nsymmetry for spin wave propagation in the two domains, allowing emission in\nboth directions but at different frequencies. The results presented define a\nnew approach to produce tunable high frequency spin wave emitters of easy\nfabrication and low power consumption.\n", "  Ice-templating is a simple materials processing and shaping route where the\ngrowth of crystals from a solvent template the porosity. Although the\nprinciples of ice-templating were established a long time ago, it has lured\nconsiderable attention over the past 5 years to become a well-established\nprocessing route for porous materials of all kinds. In this viewpoint, I\nsummarize the current status and recent trends of ice-templating studies. I\nthen review the unique assets of ice-templating and propose a roadmap of the\nmost promising or pressing questions and opportunities in this domain.\n", "  The paper discusses the magnetic state of zeta phase of iron nitride viz.\n$\\zeta$-Fe$_2$N on the basis of spin polarized first principles electronic\nstructure calculations together with a review of already published data.\nResults of our first principles study suggest that the ground state of\n$\\zeta$-Fe$_2$N is ferromagnetic (FM) with a magnetic moment of 1.528\n$\\mu_\\text{B}$ on the Fe site. The FM ground state is lower than the\nanti-ferromagnetic (AFM) state by 8.44 meV and non-magnetic(NM) state by 191\nmeV per formula unit. These results are important in view of reports which\nclaim that $\\zeta$-Fe$_2$N undergoes an AFM transition below 10K and others\nwhich do not observe any magnetic transition up to 4.2K. We argue that the\nexperimental results of AFM transition below 10K are inconclusive and we\npropose the presence of competing FM and AFM superexchange interactions between\nFe sites mediated by nitrogen atoms, which are consistent with\nGoodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. We find that the anti-ferromagnetically\ncoupled Fe sites are outnumbered by ferromagnetically coupled Fe sites leading\nto a stable FM ground state. A Stoner analysis of the results also supports our\nclaim of a FM ground state.\n", "  In order to identify complicated systems, more prominent and promising\nmethods are needed among which we may refer to fractional order differential\nequations. The aim of this paper is to propose a fractional order nonlinear\nmodel to predict the vertical position of a plasma column system in a Tokamak\nby using real data from Damavand Tokamak. The system is identified based on a\nnewly introduced fractional order dynamic neural network. The proposed\nfractional order dynamic neural network (FODNN) is an extension of the integer\norder dynamic neural network that employs the so called fractional-order\noperators. FODNN is implemented and comparison of the numerical simulation\nresults with experimental results shows that performance of the proposed method\nby using fractional order neural network is preferred to the integer neural\nnetwork.\n", "  Winds of cool dwarfs are difficult to observe, with only a few M dwarfs\npresenting observationally-derived mass-loss rates (Mdot), which span several\norders of magnitude. Close-in exoplanets are conveniently positioned in the\ninner regions of stellar winds and can, thus, be used to probe the\notherwise-unobservable local properties of their host-stars' winds. Here, we\nuse local stellar wind characteristics observationally-derived in the studies\nof atmospheric evaporation of the warm-neptune GJ436 b to derive the global\ncharacteristics of the wind of its M-dwarf host. Using an isothermal wind\nmodel, we constrain the stellar wind temperature to be in the range [0.36,0.43]\nMK, with Mdot=[0.5,2.5] x 10^{-15} Msyn/yr. By computing the pressure balance\nbetween the stellar wind and the interstellar medium, we derive the size of the\nastrophere of GJ436 to be around 25 au, significantly more compact than the\nheliosphere. We demonstrate in this paper that transmission spectroscopy,\ncoupled to planetary atmospheric evaporation and stellar wind models, can be a\nuseful tool for constraining the large-scale wind structure of planet-hosting\nstars. Extending our approach to future planetary systems discoveries will open\nnew perspectives for the combined characterisation of planetary exospheres and\nwinds of cool dwarf stars.\n", "  Drug resistant focal epilepsy can be treated by resecting the epileptic focus\nrequiring a precise focus localization using stereoelectroencephalography\n(SEEG) probes. As commercial SEEG probes offer only a limited spatial\nresolution, probes of higher channel count and design freedom enabling the\nincorporation of macro and microelectrodes would help increasing spatial\nresolution and thus open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms\nunderlying focal epilepsy and its treatment. This work describes a new\nfabrication process for SEEG probes with materials and dimensions similar to\nclinical probes enabling recording single neuron activity at high spatial\nresolution. Polyimide is used as a biocompatible flexible substrate into which\nplatinum electrodes and leads are...\n  The resulting probe features match those of clinically approved devices.\nTests in saline solution confirmed the probe stability and functionality.\nProbes were implanted into the brain of one monkey (Macaca mulatta), trained to\nperform different motor tasks. Suitable configurations including up to 128\nelectrode sites allow the recording of task-related neuronal signals. Probes\nwith 32 and 64 electrode sites were implanted in the posterior parietal cortex.\nLocal field potentials and multi-unit activity were recorded as early as one\nhour after implantation. Stable single-unit activity was achieved for up to 26\ndays after implantation of a 64-channel probe. All recorded signals showed\nmodulation during task execution. With the novel probes it is possible to\nrecord stable biologically relevant data over a time span exceeding the usual\ntime needed for epileptic focus localization in human patients. This is the\nfirst time that single units are recorded along cylindrical polyimide probes\nchronically implanted 22 mm deep into the brain of a monkey, which suggests the\npotential usefulness of this probe for human applications.\n", "  A broad brush impressionistic view of physics from the vantage point of she\nliving on a nearby dark-planet Zimpok is presented so as to argue that the\nobserved and the observer are reflected in quantum gravity through a universal\nmass shared by neurones and a unification scale of the high energy physics.\n", "  The occurrence of metallic film deposition without external power supply on\nthe copper current collector of a zinc air battery half-cell containing zinc\nslurry is investigated. Therefore, test specimens of miscellaneous materials\nrepresenting the current collector are immersed in a commercial available zinc\nslurry as well as an in self-prepared zinc slurry. In case of copper and metals\nwhich are more noble (silver and gold), a coating on the respective specimen is\nobtained. An element mapping of the coated copper specimen is performed by\nmeans of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray\nspectroscopy (EDX) identifying that the coating layer consists of zinc and\noxygen. In order to clarify the crystal structure and the exact composition,\nfocused ion beam (FIB) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements\nare applied, proving that the layer consists of elemental zinc, which, is\nmerely oxidized on the surface. Finally, a reaction mechanism for the\nreversible zinc film deposition is proposed.\n", "  Besides their huge technological importance, fluidized beds have attracted a\nlarge amount of research because they are perfect playgrounds to investigate\nhighly dynamic particulate flows. Their over-all behavior is determined by\nshort-lasting particle collisions and the interaction between solid and gas\nphase. Modern simulation techniques that combine computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) and discrete element methods (DEM) are capable of describing their\nevolution and provide detailed information on what is happening on the particle\nscale. However, these approaches are limited by small time steps and large\nnumerical costs, which inhibits the investigation of slower long-term processes\nlike heat transfer or chemical conversion.\n  In a recent study (Lichtenegger and Pirker, 2016), we have introduced\nrecurrence CFD (rCFD) as a way to decouple fast from slow degrees of freedom in\nsystems with recurring patterns: A conventional simulation is carried out to\ncapture such coherent structures. Their re-appearance is characterized with\nrecurrence plots that allow us to extrapolate their evolution far beyond the\nsimulated time. On top of these predicted flow fields, any passive or weakly\ncoupled process can then be investigated at fractions of the original\ncomputational costs.\n  Here, we present the application of rCFD to heat transfer in a lab-scale\nfluidized bed. Initially hot particles are fluidized with cool air and their\ntemperature evolution is recorded. In comparison to conventional CFD-DEM, we\nobserve speed-up factors of about two orders of magnitude at very good accuracy\nwith regard to recent measurements.\n", "  We constrain the amount of event-by-event fluctuations of the proton by\ncomparing with the HERA coherent and incoherent diffractive $J/\\Psi$ production\ndata. We find that the HERA measurements prefer large geometric fluctuations.\nWe then include the constrained fluctuating proton shapes in viscous\nhydrodynamical simulations of the proton-nucleus collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, and find a good description of the mean transverse\nmomentum and flow harmonics measured at the LHC.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials have considerably expanded the field of\nmaterials science in the last decade. Even more recently, various 2D materials\nhave been assembled into vertical van der Waals heterostacks, and it has been\nproposed to combine them with other low- dimensional structures to create new\nmaterials with hybridized properties. Here, we demonstrate the first direct\nimages of a suspended 0D/2D heterostructure incorporating $C_{60}$ molecules\nbetween two graphene layers in a buckyball sandwich structure. We find clean\nand ordered $C_{60}$ islands with thicknesses down to one molecule, shielded by\nthe graphene layers from the microscope vacuum and partially protected from\nradiation damage during scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging. The\nsandwich structure serves as a 2D nanoscale reaction chamber allowing the\nanalysis of the structure of the molecules and their dynamics at atomic\nresolution.\n", "  Propagation of the surface waves on the interface between an uniaxial\nhyperbolic material and an isotopical topological insulator is studied. The\ncases of the anisotropy axes is normal to interface or one is coplanar to\ninterface are discussed. The dispersion relations are derived and analyzed. The\nconditions of the existence of the surface waves are established.\n", "  A family of repressor networks is proposed as a simple model of gene\nregulatory networks. We analytically show three topological classes of the\nrepressor networks, each of which exhibits distinctly growing complexity of\nspatiotemporal expressions starting from nearly homogeneous states. Further, by\nfocusing on locally interacting cases such as chain networks, including a\ngeneralized repressilator, or feedforward(back)-loop networks, spatiotemporal\nexpressions in the long time regime and elusive relationships between such\ndifferent networks are discussed in detail.\n", "  We consider a single-level quantum dot coupled to magnetic insulators\n(magnonic reservoirs) and magnetic metals (electronic reservoirs). The whole\nsystem is in an external magnetic field. In a general case, the system includes\ntwo magnonic and two electronic reservoirs, but we also present results for\nsome specific situations, where only two or three reservoirs are effectively\nconnected to the dot. The main objective is the analysis of the conversion of\nmagnon current to electronic spin and charge currents, and {\\it vice versa}. We\nconsider the limiting case of large Coulomb energy in the dot (Coulomb\nblockade), as well as the case when the Coulomb energy is finite and double\noccupancy is allowed.\n", "  By a detailed study of the mathematical structure of the cumulant generating\nfunction (CGF) of particle transfer in the non-interacting case we show that it\nsatisfies duality relations connecting the CGFs of two different realizations\nof the same system. Employing these identities we derive an infinite number of\nrelations between different cumulants, which amounts to a generalization of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem to non-equilibrium situations. We generalize\nthe concept to multi-terminal set-ups and show that duality relations also\nexist for genuinely interacting systems by explicitly deriving one of them for\nthe two-terminal anisotropic Kondo impurity model and discussing other\nimportant examples. The discovered identities are useful tools in the ongoing\ninvestigation of the analytical properties of the cumulant generating functions\nof charge transport.\n", "  Experiments, numerical simulations and an analytic model were developed to\nelucidate the effects of noise in the synchronized state of a tunnel junction\nbased spin torque nano oscillator (STNO). It is demonstrated that in the in\nplane magnetized structure, while the frequency is locked, much higher\nreference currents are needed to reduce the noise by phase locking. Our\nanalysis shows that it is possible to control the phase noise by the reference\nmicrowave current (IRF) and that it can be further reduced by increasing the\nbias current (IDC) of the oscillator, keeping the reference current in feasible\nlimits for applications.\n", "  M16, the Eagle Nebula, is an outstanding HII region where extensive high-mass\nstar formation is taking place in the Sagittarius Arm, and hosts the remarkable\n\"pillars\" observed with HST. We made new CO observations of the region in the\n12CO J=1--0 and J=2--1 transitions with NANTEN2. These observations revealed\nfor the first time that a giant molecular cloud of $\\sim 1.3 \\times 10^5$ \\Msun\n\\ is associated with M16, which is elongated vertically to the Galactic plane\nover 35 pc at a distance of 1.8 kpc. We found a cavity of the molecular gas of\n$\\sim 10$ pc diameter toward the heart of M16 at \\lbeq (16.95\\degree,\n0.85\\degree), where more than 10 O-type stars and $\\sim 400$ stars are\nassociated, in addition to a close-by molecular cavity toward a Spitzer bubble\nN19 at \\lbeq (17.06\\degree, 1.0\\degree). We found three velocity components\nwhich show spatially complementary distribution in the entire M16 giant\nmolecular cloud (GMC) including NGC6611 and N19, suggesting collisional\ninteraction between them. Based on the above results we frame a hypothesis that\ncollision between the red-shifted and blue-shifted components at a relative of\n$\\sim 10$ \\kms \\ triggered formation of the O-type stars in the M16 GMC in the\nlast 1-2 Myr. The collision is two fold in the sense that one of the\ncollisional interactions is major toward the M16 cluster and the other toward\nN19 with a RCW120 type, the former triggered most of the O star formation with\nalmost full ionization of the parent gas, and the latter an O star formation in\nN19.\n", "  General self-consistent expressions for the coefficients of diffusion and\ndynamical friction in a stable, bound, multicomponent self-gravitating and\ninhomogeneous system are derived. They account for the detailed dynamics of the\ncolliding particles and their self-consistent dressing by collective\ngravitational interactions. The associated Fokker-Planck equation is shown to\nbe fully consistent with the corresponding inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard\nequation and, in the weak self-gravitating limit, to the inhomogeneous Landau\nequation. Hence it provides an alternative derivation to both and demonstrates\ntheir equivalence. The corresponding stochastic Langevin equations are\npresented: they can be a practical alternative to numerically solving the\ninhomogeneous Fokker-Planck and Balescu-Lenard equations. The present formalism\nallows for a self-consistent description of the secular evolution of different\npopulations covering a spectrum of masses, with a proper accounting of the\ninduced secular mass segregation, which should be of interest to various\nastrophysical contexts, from galactic centers to protostellar discs.\n", "  We introduce a new application of measuring symplectic generators to\ncharacterize and control the linear betatron coupling in storage rings. From\nsynchronized and consecutive BPM (Beam Position Monitor) turn-by-turn (TbT)\nreadings, symplectic Lie generators describing the coupled linear dynamics are\nextracted. Four plane-crossing terms in the generators directly characterize\nthe coupling between the horizontal and the vertical planes. Coupling control\ncan be accomplished by utilizing the dependency of these plane-crossing terms\non skew quadrupoles. The method has been successfully demonstrated to reduce\nthe vertical effective emittance down to the diffraction limit in the newly\nconstructed National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) storage ring. This\nmethod can be automatized to realize linear coupling feedback control with\nnegligible disturbance on machine operation.\n", "  I present briefly some facts about nonequilibrium renormalized perturbation\ntheory, correcting recent misleading statements in [E. Mu\\~noz, F. Zamani, L.\nMerker, T. A. Costi, and S. Kirchner, Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 807,\n092001 (2017)], and discuss some results of this work using rSPT at\nequilibrium.\n", "  Semiconductor microcavities are often influenced by structural imperfections,\nwhich can disturb the flow and dynamics of exciton-polariton condensates.\nAdditionally, in exciton-polariton condensates there is a variety of dynamical\nscenarios and instabilities, owing to the properties of the incoherent\nexcitonic reservoir. We investigate the dynamics of an exciton-polariton\ncondensate which emerges in semiconductor microcavity subject to disorder,\nwhich determines its spatial and temporal behaviour. Our experimental data\nrevealed complex burst-like time evolution under non-resonant optical pulsed\nexcitation. The temporal patterns of the condensate emission result from the\nintrinsic disorder and are driven by properties of the excitonic reservoir,\nwhich decay in time much slower with respect to the polariton condensate\nlifetime. This feature entails a relaxation oscillation in polariton condensate\nformation, resulting in ultrafast emission pulses of coherent polariton field.\nThe experimental data can be well reproduced by numerical simulations, where\nthe condensate is coupled to the excitonic reservoir described by a set of rate\nequations. Theory suggests the existence of slow reservoir temporarily emptied\nby stimulated scattering to the condensate, generating ultrashort pulses of the\ncondensate emission.\n", "  This work has as the main aim to explore the nature of the fermionic fields,\nthrough a classification of spinor fields about physical space of interest,\nsuch as the bulk and the compactified space $S^7$ from the supergravity\ntheories. This classification has an extreme utility in the exploration and in\nthe search for new type of particles, whose observables correspond to bilinear\ncovariants. In this way, these fields are classified into classes, through\nconstraints obtained by means of the Fierz-Pauli-Kofink identities and the\nbilinear symmetries. We found the Lagrangian terms for the free spinor fields\non spaces of seven compactified dimension in supergravity and, as application\nof our spinor fields classification on the bulk, we associate the invariants on\naxisymmetric black holes to the components of the bilinear covariants of the\ncorrespondent fermionic field. Besides, we found that a type of spinor\ndenominated flag-dipole does not generate a brane, but degenerate itself in\nother type of spinor called dipole and, in compactification theories, we\nobtained the expression to the quantum field on compactified spaces for low\nenergies in terms of creation and annihilation operators.\n", "  Exciton dissociation at heterojunctions in photovoltaic devices is not\ncompletely understood despite being fundamentally necessary to generate\nelectrical current. One of the fundamental issues for ab initio calculations is\nthat hybrid interfaces combining materials with Wannier-Mott excitons and those\nwith Frenkel excitons can easily require thousands of atoms to encompass the\nexciton-wave function. The problem is further exacerbated by a large\npermittivity difference at the interface, which requires meso-scale boundary\nconditions to accurately predict electrostatic potentials. For these reasons,\nwe have constructed a model of excited states at hybrid interfaces based on an\neffective mass Schroedinger equation. In this continuum model, carrier wave\nfunctions are represented by their envelope function rather than resolving the\natomic scale variations. Electrostatic interactions are accounted for using the\nPoisson equation. For our model system, we use a pentacene/silicon interface.\nBecause carrier mobility is low in pentacene relative to silicon, the hole is\nfrozen such that it only interacts with the electron though an immobile\npositive charge density. The inputs to this model are as follows: dielectric\npermittivities, electron effective masses, interfacial width, band alignment,\nand the hole wave function. We find that the energetic favorability of charge\ntransfer states relative to bulk excitons is most easily controlled by band\nalignment. However, when both states have similar energies, interface proximity\nand electrostatics become important secondary means of tuning the relative\nstability of these states.\n", "  Using a semiclassical Green's function formalism, we discover the emergence\nof chiral and topological orbital magnetism in two-dimensional chiral spin\ntextures by explicitly finding the corrections to the orbital magnetization,\nproportional to the powers of the gradients of the texture. We show that in the\nabsence of spin-orbit coupling, the resulting orbital moment can be understood\nas the electronic response to the emergent magnetic field associated with the\nreal-space Berry curvature. By referring to the Rashba model, we demonstrate\nthat by tuning the parameters of surface systems the engineering of emergent\norbital magnetism in spin textures can pave the way to novel concepts in\norbitronics.\n", "  We apply the free product construction to various local algebras in algebraic\nquantum field theory.\n  If we take the free product of infinitely many identical half-sided modular\ninclusions with ergodic canonical endomorphism, we obtain a half-sided modular\ninclusion with ergodic canonical endomorphism and trivial relative commutant.\nOn the other hand, if we take M\\\"obius covariant nets with trace class\nproperty, we are able to construct an inclusion of free product von Neumann\nalgebras with large relative commutant, by considering either a finite family\nof identical inclusions or an infinite family of inequivalent inclusions. In\ntwo dimensional spacetime, we construct Borchers triples with trivial relative\ncommutant by taking free products of infinitely many, identical Borchers\ntriples. Free products of finitely many Borchers triples are possibly\nassociated with Haag-Kastler net having S-matrix which is nontrivial and non\nasymptotically complete, yet the nontriviality of double cone algebras remains\nopen.\n", "  A polarity-dependent reversible change in the current-voltage characteristics\nbetween states corresponding to different values of the excess current Iexc is\nobserved for bias voltages of several hundred millivolts in YBaCuO-Ag point\ncontacts in the current-carrying state.\n"]}
